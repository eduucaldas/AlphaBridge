nt|Walddk2: Jo, de kan cykle hjem|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ligesom du gjorde i morges|pg||
nt|roswolf: we are off again|pg||
nt|sheila a: Hallo Beryl|pg||
nt|lark20: Sorry McGowan and Punch are playing weak no trump, 4 card majors and weak twos in 3 suits|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Welcome all|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|galadriel: Afternoon all and welcome back to the second half of this match between Scotland and Northern Ireland|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good evening everyone!|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 4s look likely here|pg||
nt|lark20: 20-21|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yorkbeach:  hopefully we will get South's name corrected shortly|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy n/s to play in @S at some level|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: NS play weak notrump but north must have decided that is too good, with 14 and 5 good diamonds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: these good 14 counts are always difficult, do you upgrade to 15?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hej Chick!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yorkbeach:  with bare spade honours and no tens?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Good morning.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Good Morning and welcome to the Lady Milne from Belfast|pg||
nt|sheila a: We seem to be summarising the auction|pg||
nt|galadriel: Match 2 - Scotland v Northern ireland|pg||
nt|sheila a: If Ns are playing weak NT it might have gone 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good 4@S for EW subject to @H play.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Scotland are EW but we don't have names yet|pg||
nt|sheila a: It's not always straightforward to cash all your @s in this situation|pg||
nt|galadriel: The event is taking place in Belfast|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as west|pg||
nt|chick: Hejjjj Ralf, Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|coch draig: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: The Law - 4@S |pg||
nt|jbgood: Roland vil gjerne (be)vise at også dansker har humoristisk sans - well done R:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes that's a good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: morning Michael|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Germ|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good sequence|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  those trump intermeiates are useful|pg||
nt|roswolf: south bid 4@S I suspect|pg||
nt|galadriel: This will be a few down|pg||
nt|roswolf: if real|pg||
nt|galadriel: By North, obviously|pg||
nt|sheila a: Was 4@h the opening bid or just the final contract?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3@D from North might have shut East out|pg||
nt|lark20: Hi|pg||
pc|s5|nt|simonr: Should get there with west taking the bull by the horns|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to stay out of game anyway|pg||
nt|simonr: Fourth suit forcing to set up the force|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is never stopping in a partscore once East opens, misfit in @d or not|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT is also making|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wondering now whether to bid 3@S or 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt south is wondering what to do|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Må være skuffende for Vest ikke at kunne bete 4@S, og da har makker endda et trumfstik!|pg||
nt|sharkey: På en god dag slem ØV|pg||
nt|athene: well they opened 1nt in the other room - maybe that was 14-16|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S has some good fortune  J10@S doubleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I understand the vugraph operator often waits until the tray moves across|pg||
nt|simonr: 3@s would be forcing and East might have Q@s and some goodies for slam - but unlikely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy start with 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  card says 2hx shows 6@h and 5-9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not wise to give them a push here mrs caplan|pg||
nt|athene: if west bids 3@S now and then 4@S later that definitely sounds like more hand than she has|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @sQ and singleton @h would ideal|pg||
nt|roswolf: operator are you sure east is playing it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Final contract|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: so if she wants to commit to spades she had better bid four right away|pg||
nt|sheila a: Nash-Connelly play strong NT, 5 card majors and 3 weak 2s|pg||
nt|kemperg: can make |pg||
nt|mikeirl: unusual not to dbl with N hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: Jeg syns S skal melde 4@S første gang|pg||
nt|baardolav: Dårlig bruk av svak løft|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S er helt ude i hampen. Hvad hedder det på norsk?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@s er ok... svak løft gjør du på 3kortstøtte|pg||
nt|jbgood: kan si det, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: helt på vidda   hører jeg|pg||
nt|sharkey: Om S har noen quacks i tillegge betyr omtrent ingen ting - styrken hans er i trumfen - svakhet ingen motspillstikk|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  surprised South bid not bid 3@h given her extra heart|pg||
nt|roswolf: what west played small !? - sacre bleu|pg||
nt|galadriel: Did West really duck?|pg||
nt|chick: NS are playing a 4 card major weak NT ACOL system|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: ignoring that seventh heart not a good idea|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's the strongest weak jump shift i have ever seen|pg||
nt|simonr: East is hating it!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with no @h stopper East was reluctant to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|galadriel: J from Jx would be a very unusual lead|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah, no|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: She didn't :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: but if north had bid a gentle 3@H right away over 2@H, even if that was not theoretically constructive, south might have given it a fourth|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yorkbeach:  need @s guess to make 4@h|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|yorkbeach:  convention card for EW http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/kaye-youngs.pdf|pg||
nt|athene: of course a lot depends on what 1@D - 2@S would mean|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  convention card for NS http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/ingham-woodruff.pdf|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kemperg: !J is the entry|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: N tror S had 3@S også...|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: no guess now|pg||
nt|simonr: They play weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|kemperg: @HJ|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I was expecting South to high-low in trumps|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: For resten, da skal man ikke grine af mig, når jeg foreslår, at bergenserne skal cykle hjem. et er vel en dejlig tur op ad kysten, ikke sandt?|pg||
nt|baardolav: Burde være greitt å ta en lav finesse i hjerter nå|pg||
nt|baardolav: Å sikre 4 hjerterstikk|pg||
nt|sharkey: blir litt vått etter hvert ellen laaaang omvei|pg||
nt|sheila a: a @c to the Q should bring this home|pg||
pc|h5|nt|coch draig: 4@c was a slam try of course and 4@h a cue|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: now @S's|pg||

nt|athene: a very good hand for a 3@S opener, but maybe 2nd seat at adverse it's ok|pg||
nt|athene: usually with a sound 7-4 you open 4|pg||
nt|simonr: Depends on how weak they are!|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's sensible yes 1@D 1@S 2@C 3@S should be forcing if playing WJS but it's not standard for sure|pg||
nt|sheila a: I will flick back and forward and see what I can find out re scores in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: Results and other good info here:  http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good afternoon Peter, good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|petepunt: welcome back for the final session|pg||
nt|petepunt: any running scores|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good afternoon operator (sorry your name is not showing)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Kennewell would open 4@s |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@d-2@s = weak, 1@d-1@s-2someting-2@s = invitational?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West's name is spelt  Connolly, operator, and East has an Iceland flag|pg||
mb|2D|an|multi weak version|nt|baardolav: Skulle være mulig å unngå utgang på disse kortene?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: ja|pg||
nt|simonr: 15-17 NT here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well game is easy to bid for e/w|pg||
nt|sheila a: slam in @d possible for NS|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3c both minors|pg||
nt|coch draig: looks like a run of a mill auction to 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: spesielt etter 1nt åpning|pg||
nt|jbgood: litt oppvurdering fra begge sider i lukket rom|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S should be good at adverse vulnerability|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is assuming that her partner has what she would have :(|pg||
nt|sheila a: We seem to have had some difficulties with the first board - hope to find out what happened later|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: yes i think most are raising 3@S there with three quick tricks and two trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks cold to us but the English south went 2 down |pg||
nt|athene: looks as though you should lose just the two trumps and @CQ, doesn't it|pg||
nt|sheila a: The rooms seem to be linked now - got an imp showing|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3nt good here ns|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@D is poss.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like Wennell and Shea have decided to change compass positions but otherwise the linep is the same as the last stanza|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think Rolnd will give us them soon|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Scotland were in contention last time I saw them|pg||
nt|petepunt: are we sure Shelia shea is East ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  have you seen the bidding :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Mest af Øst|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes @h goes on the @dA|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H makable     but not guaranteed|pg||
nt|athene: i would expect just 4@D from west over a strong notrump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h suit combo to make 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H will come down to how you play the trumps - double finesse is normal isn't it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: This isn't the boards they are playing...|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: result to follow shortly :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: Interestingly, it seems 3NT made in both rooms on board 1?|pg||
nt|sheila a: The defence had 5 @s to cash if they did the right things|pg||
nt|galadriel: There seems to be some debate about whether the scores are accurate|pg||
nt|sheila a: Is it just this board (2) that's come out wrong?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: N hadde meldt @H forrige spill som kibs sier så 3 NT hadde gått hjem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does the encyclopedia say?|pg||
nt|lark20: That should encourage McGowan|pg||
nt|mikeirl: or d pre empt|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: Hi all ungagged now|pg||
nt|sheila a: N has some useful cards |pg||
nt|kemperg: no courage by S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: no no|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|sheila a: This isn't right - wrong board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: seems some boards are wrong...back with u shortly we hope :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Putting us to test:)|pg||
nt|galadriel: Thanks June - do we have names?|pg||
nt|sheila a: I have done the vugraph operation and it can be a nightmare if the set up isn't right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Agree, tricky assignment.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the Wales npc may have changed their seats in the hope of changing luck|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Det er vel meget rimeligt at opvurdere Vests hånd til 18-19|pg||
nt|simonr: They play Texas transfers so this should show mild slam interest. Should have just bid 4@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not according to suitplay|pg||
nt|athene: especially since there might be issues of trying to lose a trick to north rather than south, to protect the @SK (you might set up clubs for a spade pitch)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  surprised East has not X 5@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  going to be expensive failing to do so|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yorkbeach:  suitplay says to lead the 10|pg||
nt|kemperg: but even on 3@D N had the problem|pg||
nt|coch draig: both pairs playing 4 card majors and a weak nt|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jbgood: ofte greit med EN hardmelder i et par - med begge kan det gå litt for fort i svingene|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi germ|pg||
nt|coch draig: so 2N here is forcing 15-19|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kemperg: Hi Geoffry|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoops|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  300 instead of 800|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: i looked at the play record and it seems declarer did all sensible things and then claimed|pg||
nt|athene: well leading the ten works ok if you guarantee to pick the position later, but double finesse makes your life easier? nothing to think about :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it surprises me too - but never known suitplay to be wrong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  running the 10 gains if North has 4@h|pg||
nt|simonr: Suitplay is a useful freeware program - http://home.planet.nl/ narcis45/SuitPlay/|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 404  play the ace  and lead small to Q  = 78%|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the fact that it is more convenient to start @h from East may tip the odds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, not so many entries to dummy, so i don't think running the ten is really an option here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sheila a: I'm not sure whether 4@d was keycard|pg||
nt|chick: South might regret calling Jxxx a stopper|pg||
nt|coch draig: McGowan could of bid 3@h on the way but all roads lead to 3N this time|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: maybe it was just some error in recording - she surely claimed 10, not 8|pg||
nt|petepunt: 88 scot (assume 16vp) 87 eng (assume 22vp)  from current match|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is there a defence for 4 off?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West ruffs the @h even when declarer ducks and then plays a trump?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with AK A East really should have doubled|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: ah, a spec tells me that declarer revoked|pg||
nt|roswolf: small club was a practical shot|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petepunt: A@D before the QC|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: For kibs looking for commentaries in English go to Closed Room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did declarer really throw a @C on the @DA?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the pressures of playing with screens|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: This is Nordanian, horrible language|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|sheila a: No problems on the actual layout|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  dare I ask about the bottom of the table?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do any of us think cashing the ace is right?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|jbgood: glad dette er skriftlig - så vi alle skjønner Roland:)|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|yo_yo: what are they?   most players like screens|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe but they do not use them very often|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  for some it is twice a year, once in trials, once in event|pg||
nt|sheila a: Ah - this is the hand that goes with the previous auction|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S bid 2nt and has shown @sAK and @hK. If also @cA - not 2nt....|pg||
nt|chick: according to their CC, it should have been a count signal|pg||
nt|the saint: Hi, just in time for some action|pg||
nt|coch draig: taking the losing @s finesse handed the defence the momentum|pg||
nt|coch draig: hi Alan|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  missed opprtunity for Wales there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  the encylopedia does not have the 8, which perhaps tips the odds|pg||
nt|simonr: The weak NT (12-14) but they will open most 11 counts NV|pg||
mb|6N|nt|jbgood: har du ekskludert søta bror, Roland?|pg||
nt|athene: the english NPC should have laid down ground rules at the start:- revokes are ok, but keep them for the partscores :)|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20    but n/s have 4@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  especailly with three 10s|pg||
nt|roswolf: will n/s attempt game here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, East's name is Wennell|pg||
nt|the saint: Realistically with this shape and the double fits coming to light, EW should easily get to 6D and NS should haveno problem saving in 6S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good afternoon Mark, good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|coch draig: bizarely according to their cc 2N shows both minors 7-11!!|pg||
nt|coch draig: hi Julian|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Han er i lukket rom|pg||
nt|sheila a: The natural weak 2 in @d has its uses but it won't put Nash off bidding here|pg||
nt|the saint: The East hand is an Easy 1C opener and then keep bidding diamonds until P gets the picture|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hehe|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: another good 14 gets upgraded|pg||
nt|athene: this one is better than the earlier hand, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the 5-card suit is way better and no ugly KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agree with the upgrade this time - decent intermediates as well as 14 HCp + 5 card suit |pg||
nt|yo_yo: revokes are common,  i  unfortunately do them quite often :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: yes  agree with the upgrade this time|pg||
nt|athene: if north tries 3@S then south should go to game even with the 12 count i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: will n/s get into the bidding even:)|pg||
nt|petepunt: misunderstanding here|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk7: Jeg er faktisk den søteste af dem alle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: nr. 7|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hva er det som forgår her... Skal du si 1nt på 16 hp i andre melderunde... så får du heller åpne 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: with AAK and a spade fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  very favourable lie of the cards for NS|pg||
nt|ady: north declined to go further  with good shape     maybe decided would need a transfer brake to consider game|pg||
nt|athene: north would have bid game after a super-accept but otherwise stop in 2; that is reasonable, so you play 2 or 4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no one has bid so the @S are likely to split|pg||
nt|simonr: Should be a routine 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dK lead expected|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is W asking questions?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i feel sorry for the TD already|pg||
nt|athene: not an ideal 2@D opener with four spades, but maybe she will anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: that was so I could put in score|pg||
nt|ady: looks like east will play in 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: west will be transferring surely?|pg||
nt|ady: make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C 2@D 2N 3@D 3@H errrr think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: agree|pg||
nt|sheila a: moving swiftly on ...|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|chick: EW play a 3-way multi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -2 in 3nt oc previous board was a difference of 20 IMPs|pg||
nt|chick: this is obviously the weak 2 in major one|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon Michael and specs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: Høyland med en "heavy" 2@S LR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Men V åpnet|pg||
nt|kemperg: possible slam |pg||
nt|petepunt: may get too high here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yorkbeach:  having the ace in your own suit is  a factor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh i see Pat , what was the lead?|pg||
nt|simonr: East play 2NT as 20-22 but will she upgrade?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  sorry South's name is still incorrect - should be Ingham, not Ingram|pg||
nt|simonr: No|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told that EW play 3@D - 3@H shows a fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with the @C10 she might have|pg||
nt|sheila a: Both pairs here are highly experienced|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks a simple 4@H but is it to bid!?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@d = Multi|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@d is making|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS have had three hands so far where they could open 1nt playing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the weak notrump was suppose to come up lots, or something|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common these days to give up on stopping in 3major facing a 2nt opener to clarify the degree of fit right away|pg||
nt|sheila a: Grant-Macdonald play Weak NT, Multi-Lucas|pg||
nt|ralfwil: depending on what kind of multi - pass is an alternative|pg||
nt|mikeirl: no - at this stage ew are in 5@CX which is the normal save|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  normally it does|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  England South on board 3 opened 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult bid for North|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@C is a bit of an underbid|pg||
nt|sheila a: NIBU go into the lead |pg||
nt|sheila a: Yvonne Wiseman took an inferior line in 3NT on board 1, it seems|pg||
nt|sheila a: not sure why W didn't open 1NT on this|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure Millership isn't happy with herself|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  minimum and poor suit|pg||
nt|coch draig: 3@d min with @s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  correction any weak 2 in @s|pg||
nt|petepunt: probalby not now N has overcalled vul|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yorkbeach:  3@d stopper ask?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  some pairs play that 2NT-3@d-3@h promises 3 @h|pg||
nt|simonr: Completing the transfer with 3 cards is becoming popular|pg||
nt|athene: i think it makes more sense to play that 3@H actually denies a fit though? then you only force to game with at least a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like they are doing that|pg||
nt|mikeirl: bid by North|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East is not going to care whether West is max or min this time|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@d will help put on the brakes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Burns and Greenwood play strong NT, 5card majors and Multi-Lucas|pg||
nt|galadriel: I'm sure Greenwood would have preferred to defend with that nice @D suit|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks best spot to me|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yo_yo: or is it a @C raise?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I assume 3@h is asking but surely she is alwasy bidding game|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a bit difficult here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  from South over 3@c|pg||
nt|athene: north would like to cue the diamonds to show a good raise in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but 3@D cue takes her past the level of 3@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North could bid 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt would get the job done|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@d stopper would be enough as the cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: you can use 2nt as a good raise also when the cue is too expensive just in general|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting idea|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT should be 1 down|pg||
nt|simonr: Once you have established a fit it avoids the two way new suit bid - is it a new suit or a cue problem?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@c + 2@s + 2@d = 8|pg||
nt|kemperg: they play 4crd major?|pg||
nt|roswolf: over a simple preference will east bid on|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes germ|pg||
nt|sheila a: wow|pg||
nt|petepunt: danger time ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Sjanse her for Kristiansand|pg||
nt|sheila a: 2@s from Burns is @s and a minor|pg||
nt|galadriel: But nowadays, everyone likes to compete over the opps 1NT|pg||
nt|galadriel: even a strong one|pg||
nt|sheila a: Nash obviously expecting more from the W hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry 5@C on board 1|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  inconsistent to bid only 2@d and then look for a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: ikke det...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Veldig hardt å komme i 4@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: Enig|pg||
nt|baardolav: Du har ikke anledning til å finne at 4@s er spillbart på så dårlig tilpasning som her|pg||
nt|sheila a: Greenwood can guess which minor :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes she will:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Ok otherwise 2@H was the proper bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@h might have allowed NS into the auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  now we know - thinking of a slam|pg||
nt|the saint: Can East construct a min hand that makes slam good?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c2|nt|henryb:  Connolly added a point for good play, and Nash added three more|pg||
nt|henryb:  :)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes 10 tricks no game on|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sheila a: This may go 2 off|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah west not in the mood - may cost her side a bushel of imps|pg||
nt|coch draig: 3@h advanced cue perhaps|pg||
nt|the saint: Depending on their ranges of course|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|the saint: If not, then no point in going through the relays|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @sKxxxxx singleton @c red ace|pg||
pc|s2|nt|coch draig: good lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  need to play A as card lie|pg||
nt|the saint: If that fits their minimum then that is the one|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sheila a: Can get the majors going but still a trick short?|pg||
nt|coch draig: still can't make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: e.g. (1@S) 2@H (2@S) 2NT is a good raise to 3@H|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  struggling to avoid 4 losers anyway|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South will not be underleading the @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as she can see two aces and a trump trick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  poor bid by East|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should have bid 4@s over 3@d|pg||
nt|coch draig: 1 trick in every suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  one of the advantages of a Multi is that the strong hand usually becomes declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  thrown away that advantage|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer's best hope i that whoever has 3@d throws one on the @c|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: south just has to hang on to her @DQxx when declarer runs the clubs|pg||
nt|sheila a: When it goes 1NT P P you know you have roughly half the points at least|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for results and standings after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|mikeirl: cards lie very favourably for N/S|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|petepunt: may paly N for Kx@D  but not 2day :(|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|yorkbeach:  I am sure 2NT would have been natrual for N|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes. she needs two of three finesses (50%) but something more in @s, so a less than even money slam|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kemperg: S has nothing to think about|pg||
nt|mikeirl: poor % slam|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: oh yes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer would need a singlton in each minor for the @dA to be running away|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: North can signal a high heart|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have considered ducking that trick just to tighten the position up a little, but perhaps she wants to keep the option of exiting in spades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  operator - please could you check that you have E and W the right way round|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: also the hearts are wide open and could go 2 down ducking|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yorkbeach:  North should throw a @d|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: men selv med minimum hos nord er det spillbart så lange han har kløver ess|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tells South to keep them|pg||
nt|sheila a: but vulnerable you risk going for 200 opposite nothing in particular|pg||
nt|roswolf: in 3@H to take the first round trump finesse is reasonable play i think|pg||
nt|mikeirl: a quick claim|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you do not want to be looking for a slam when eevn game is uncertain|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  England NS bid 3NT in the other room after West opened 1@d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not a good contract after a 1@d opening as West likley to hold the @sA|pg||
nt|athene: now there are diamond endplays|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: east should definitely not have passed 1@D, in my view|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: a 5-card major and an ace|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: after cash @DA|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  Now of course it has gotten worse, since she can't take all of the finesses|pg||
nt|sheila a: It would have been better to duck the 2nd @s to improve her communications|pg||
nt|henryb:  Scotland well in the lead after proving that there is little luck of the Irish at the moment|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: Selv om syd inviterer igjen slår vel N av|pg||
nt|jbgood: så mange med syds kort ville nok ha gamblet på soneutgangen|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: defence has communication in spades if they jnow it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard work to flatten 3@h one off at the other table :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  No!|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sheila a: luck can only do so much|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h6|mc|10|nt|sheila a: or 300|pg||

nt|chick: 2N = 19-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: hvis S kalkulerer med 3/% så burde vel ytgang meldes...|pg||
nt|sharkey: 37%|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yorkbeach:  they had the clue of @d length in the North hand there too|pg||
nt|athene: a good 17 with 5major is too strong for 1nt usually, but there the @HQJ are not so great|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have seen players pass with south's hand type|pg||
nt|kemperg: problems now|pg||
nt|mikeirl: a par scorce in @s or @c|pg||
mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  an understatement|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    e/w have the balance of poer   but n/s can make 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: awful in fact on this hand :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: or no trumps!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|simonr: 15-17 again - upgrade for the AQJxx in @s but down grade of the QJ @H|pg||
nt|athene: they are especially not great facing @H64|pg||
nt|sheila a: It doesn't feel right to have to open that hand 1@s|pg||
nt|sheila a: That's why some people play a 5 card @s suit and open 1@c on this hand type|pg||
nt|roswolf: east should pass this and then we could see some blood split|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would ALWAYS rdbl for rescue here|pg||
nt|kemperg: everybody for 1NT?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the 10987 sold it to me - but agreed close|pg||
nt|coch draig: aggressive from S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3rd in hand opening light|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  some lively boards this set|pg||
nt|petepunt: this is not a forcing pass |pg||
nt|petepunt: prob 1 off but south should go quitely|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  true :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the vampires gather|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 tricks on that lead|pg||
nt|petepunt: J@S lead will give the contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East might manage a double if South bid 5@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @cK lead expected though|pg||
nt|petepunt: may give it!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yorkbeach:  play should be quick|pg||
nt|roswolf: well defence will now know how to defend the hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  for the lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  well predicted|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but couldnt declarer have thrown a @c on the @sA and just lost 1@d + 1@h anyway?|pg||
nt|petepunt: QS and then KH,  N may have to duck  good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  two aces to lose|pg||
nt|athene: east might sort of think about doubling|pg||
nt|galadriel: If you play 4 card majors...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i mean assuming it isn't penalty|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders lost the @hA in the other room when West led ace and another club|pg||
nt|athene: then west bids 4NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@h went on the @cKQ9|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she decided to trust her opponents as they are vul against not|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the @cK is declarer's 7th trick|pg||
nt|sheila a: This would have been much more comfortable in NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: Although everything is lying wrong regardless of where you play|pg||
nt|sheila a: E has been put off her natural @h lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  Will East lead a @h anyway?|pg||
nt|sheila a: might find a @d?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Nothing else is any better|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: 10 IMP tilbake|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ø oppvuderte til 18-19 i LR - forskjellen her|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: I stad kritiserte dere lukket rom for å oppvurdere 17 til 18-19. Dere klager ikke på Nils i dette spillet?|pg||
nt|sheila a: luckily for McGowan, W has no entry|pg||
nt|lark20: Best lead for E/W|pg||
nt|mikeirl: no real alterative except pass|pg||
pc|c2|nt|coch draig: 8 tricks here however they are played|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West has shown a hand too strong for a 1NT overcall, which seems a reasonable description|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  8 top tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play should be quick|pg||
nt|petepunt: 8H better|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: should really play the king  to have a chance of success|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: very hard for south to tackle hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  why? She has a double stopper|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a @D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  so defenders need to cash out|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  5@d doubled looks like two down|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north can find the heart at trick 2|pg||
nt|simonr: Looks like it is making now they haven't found their hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: At least it's only 50s|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass for me|pg||
nt|lestergold: time for a more exciting deal?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  little scope for more|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: assuming 4th best leads she knows her partner has only 54 clubs|pg||
nt|sheila a: East's original lead problem only postponed |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|baardolav: Har ikke klaga på 18-19 og femkort nei|pg||
nt|baardolav: Men mere tvil om denne handa|pg||
nt|petepunt: still makeable|pg||
pc|h8|nt|baardolav: 17 og 5kort er 18-19|pg||
nt|baardolav: Men to fillcard i to forskjellige farger gir vel nesten 18 hvertfall|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: Lukket er tre spill etter igjen. Blir noen småpauser her|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yorkbeach:  @d3-2 is more likley that @sK with North of course|pg||
nt|athene: only 4 clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: ONLY -2 PROBABLY|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h8 is missing, so no idea to enter dummy for @h10/9|pg||
nt|mikeirl: a few imps back here|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u they made an exciting dwal of it in the open room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sheila a: @s seems the defence's best hope for more tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c9|pc|sJ|nt|yorkbeach:  + time to test bith suits|pg||
nt|athene: so they are not beating it on clubs alone|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lark20: I expected a spade but not the K|pg||
nt|sheila a: McGowan must suspect E has @h length here|pg||
nt|mikeirl: the defence is very good here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could try giving up a @c and see whether a suicide squeeze develops|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|roswolf: east must come to 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at IMPs I would be saving my brain more a more interesting board|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  wise :)|pg||
nt|coch draig: and on we go|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: can alwasy try spades later if diamonds dont behave|pg||
nt|galadriel: Apparently there will be a problem with the scoring throughout the match, so we will be seeing 0-0 all the time|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sheila a: needs to duck|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yorkbeach:  EW bid to 5@d in the other room but NS bid 5@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer has left  herself a @d guess but the J-x will resolve it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: when people start out at bridge they get shouted at to a) lead partner's suit and b) return partner's suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: North's somewaht wild 2@h opener heloing NIBU overboard|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: should she finesse @S when she has 7 tricks?|pg||
nt|athene: and sometimes the trauma persists :) and they can't stop doing it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would have led a @h as South|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: competing to 5@D gives north a bit of a problem|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  prefer A-10-9-7 to A-J-x-x|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yorkbeach:  and it is a major|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  If she is watching, the only high spade left is the  J|pg||
nt|sheila a: odd discard|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|simonr: Put me down for a @h lead too|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yorkbeach:  unimportant with two discards coming|pg||

nt|vugraphzbj: Spillerne avtaler å ta 10 minutters pause. Det blir feil å vente på spill, fordi da skjønner de om det er et lett eller et vanskelig spill..|pg||
nt|sharkey: God stamp LR - 4@S står|pg||
nt|jbgood: lurer på hvorfor ikke Eide overførte og meldte kløver på det forrige - slem er ikke umulig å nå selv om øst åpner med 1 grand|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 ruter var en god stamp i ugunstig|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: 5 min igjen av pausen|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: jeg skulle ikke tatt fram spillet, beklager det.|pg||
nt|jbgood: gjør ingen ting Snorre |pg||
nt|baardolav: Par score fra lukket rom på spillet her... |pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: Vi er klare|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dAxx is good if you think partner is short|pg||
nt|athene: the play there was interesting|pg||
nt|simonr: Two flat boards so far - and there were only three in the first 16 boards!|pg||
nt|ady: which heart last hand?    could get blocked|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely no upgrade this time|pg||
nt|athene: objectively declarer should maybe try rising the @CK at trick 1?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  expecting Wales to gain an IMP on 21|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be a big gain for N/S|pg||
nt|petepunt: S glad she didnt double as laydown on any lead with fav @D pos|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  26-0 so far this set to Scotland and potentially more on 20|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: yes, sure, there are lots of ways NS can get into 5@S, but at least that makes them work for their 650|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it was S who bid 5@s at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: she can see it's down if she ducks, on best defence|pg||
nt|simonr: Sorry - correct three|pg||
nt|mikeirl: amazing result on B oard 2 in the other room - cannot understand why S does not raise|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzbj: Jeg tipper Nils meldte 5ru fordi han håpet det sto..   :)|pg||
nt|simonr: WJO here by South?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: lucky for EW to make 3nt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4 was flat Laura Woodruff for Wales also foun the @c10 lead against 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  a weak 1NT for you :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: they need some imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: INDEED BUT THEY HAVE A SOLID START IN THIS ROOM I THINK|pg||
mb|3C|an|transfer na kara|mb|p|nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: finis|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a missed opportunity nonetheless|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rnmalik: Routine 3NT here for NS.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yuk i hate 2@D|pg||
nt|sheila a: 109 doubleton of @c is handy for declarer|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass by W correct, he'l get his chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes weak NV|pg||
nt|ady: n/s kept out of their heart fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  chance of getting @s right after East's opening|pg||
nt|athene: pim the jack offside not such good odds as drop the stiff king either side|pg||
nt|simonr: Not sure I like 4@S though especially when they overcall so aggressively|pg||
nt|athene: but the opening big changes things a bit|pg||
nt|athene: opening bid|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club lead  to beat 4@H     south can ruff 3rd round|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dQx @c 4-4 and @sA in front|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Actually, it was North that passed the raise - North opened 1@D and treated her hand as a minimum obviously|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  how are you playing the @d?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the 9th trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: WHATEVER IT MEANS/SHOWS|pg||
nt|sheila a: and the natural @s lead takes out East's potential entry for @h tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl now|pg||
nt|mikeirl: no pass is missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  I doubt EW would bid 4@h even in an uncontested auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: low to J i assume|pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbj: samme som her|pg||
nt|jbgood: legg merke til at begge sydspillerne meldte sparfargen fremfor å doble opplysende |pg||
nt|athene: with this diamond suit you lead small to the jack then back and lead the queen|pg||
nt|thedoc: undo operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont thinkl east bid 2@s here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no shape but no @c stopper - close choice|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|kemperg: she, sorry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you are playing that 3@c/3@d from West would carry a serious suggestion of playing in the minor, East has more reason to choose the spade game - West could be 5-4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: if you lead the Q first time you lose to stiff king onside|pg||
nt|coch draig: i always prefer the major fit in principal|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|simonr: East has a weak NT so will not get too excited|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard not to give  atrick on the lead here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|baardolav: Endel spiller ut konge for å få fordelingskast på 4trinnet og over, tieren viser bare flere enn to|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  that is what I thought|pg||
nt|henryb:  but even without the club position, declarer could win the heart, play a @c and take a @d finesse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  cashing the @sA wil give marked finesse|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: if you lead to the jack then to the ten you lose to K9xx onside|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ady: low spade is best    could be sing king in either hand   where as playing the Queen  gains on against stiff jack with west|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even if declarer picked the trumps, it is hard to avoid 2@d losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: with the @cx providing 3 tricks this should not prove a difficult contract|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mikeirl: perhaps not easy to bid 5@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will get a shock though if sge tries to return to hand with a @d finesse|pg||
nt|coch draig: now duck a @s|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb:  would give her 3@s, 2@d, 1@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|coch draig: sry scratch that no need|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is going to get a @d ruff, so it is going to make no difference|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will not be using the @hA as an entry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I suppose she could actually|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ady: might get some sort of end play to only lose 1 diamond|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if East had actually opened a weak 1NT, leading the Q would be right|pg||
nt|lestergold: difference in hand evaluation has led to a swing|pg||
pc|s8|nt|baardolav: Hvis du kan melde 2 ganger på hånden så melder du 1sp, svakere så er det vel mere popå doble|pg||
nt|baardolav: på essutspill|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a strong NT |pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 count with a couple of tens a lor of players would not split hairs and consider that good enuf to raise a strong no trump to game|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|sheila a: overtricks a-plenty|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: duck a heart now and ruff a heart   and should get out for 1 diamond loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: north's ultra conservatism here gaining a swing|pg||
nt|jferg: 2d from opener shows min and no 5 caed major|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yorkbeach:  @h ruff in dummy as an entry for a @d finesse|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  needed a @c continuation to stop 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  endplay is possible for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mikeirl: fortune favours the brave!|pg||

pc|c7|nt|yorkbeach:  not needed now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  could claim but may be as quick to play out|pg||
nt|petepunt: Wal gained 3 on the 6@D hand as scot dbled in same|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: playing opener for @DAx|pg||
nt|kemperg: was 3@D positive , lebensohl?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yo_yo: she has to hope one hand has AX in @D|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: well the actual @DJ10 doubleton would do |pg||
nt|yo_yo: but not to be|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: unfortunately played from wrong hand as they lay    likely played east for ace doubleton|pg||
nt|simonr: Is that right - surely two down?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: west did better to duck the club but she wasn't beating 3nt whatever she did|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  how did declarer get out for 1 down?|pg||
nt|simonr: 5@D here looks the spot|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes & followed by 4d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Wales gained 1 IMP on 5 when Scotland not unreasonably played in their 5-4 @d fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but only the same 8 tricks as in 1NT|pg||
nt|petepunt: predict scot need another 3 VPs to win the event|pg||
nt|marekw: running scores http://kongres.brydz.wlkp.pl/wyniki2011/sb1.html|pg||

mb|p|nt|simonr: Need to avoid two @H loser though|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: 5/4 in the blacks,  i thought south might open|pg||
nt|galadriel: Multi from Grant|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: support x ?|pg||
nt|athene: yes we are homing in steadily on Par Bridge :)|pg||
nt|ady: decent contract    but should bed down 1|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  has South really opend the bidding?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could well happen the way things are going :(|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yorkbeach:  not this South|pg||
nt|sheila a: 4@h is a good spot|pg||
nt|sheila a: Liz will get pretty excited now|pg||
nt|sheila a: But a count of Aces should keep them under control|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  suspect X = strong NT with no @h stopper|pg||
nt|athene: support doubles are not that common in a weak notrump base|pg||
nt|mikeirl: are men more aggressive when a fit is found.........|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  how many do Wales need to avoid losing to avoid the wooden spoon?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  Woodruff might have opened the South cards|pg||
nt|simonr: Not playing with this North!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or Shea|pg||
nt|athene: east might just bash 3nt now for want of a better bid|pg||
nt|galadriel: Burns not pre-empting first in hand with a hand playable in a major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @DK is nicely placed.|pg||
nt|sheila a: trumps aren't behaving as well as you'd like|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h a considerably inferior contract to 5@c|pg||
nt|petepunt: not so goof on a @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you need the double to show a strong notrump in a lot of auctions|pg||
nt|ady: ceertain to get to game|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to bid 2@H as that sort of sounds like 5-4 majors|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @s switch takes this a lot off|pg||
mb|1N|nt|baardolav: Sparutspill holdt NS nede på 9 stikk i lukket rom. Ellers så blir det 11|pg||
nt|ady: and should be in it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agricultural|pg||
nt|sheila a: issues with getting back to hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: a firm 3nt should be enough|pg||
nt|mikeirl: two yesses so far from kibs :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I woudl be bidding 3@c as West|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: ok, not that excite d :)|pg||
nt|chick: everything is right for declarer|pg||
nt|mikeirl: I'll be getting a John Comyn reputation :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  4 top winners for NS barring accidents|pg||
nt|athene: interesting lead problem for south|pg||
nt|simonr: East now needs to invent a forcing bid|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to bid 3@C because that's not the suit she has stopped, apart from anything|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S and a @H only losers.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  N may need to find a way to signal for @c|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to lead unsupported aces|pg||
nt|simonr: Too late - on the other side of the pond she could have raised to 3D forcing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ! don´t like @s2 fron 8752...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: and of course a singleton trump is a bad lead too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lucky for EW that the @hK is wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: today both make|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the question then is whether Easr bashed 3NT or gets scientific with 3@d|pg||
pc|h6|nt|baardolav: 2 imp å slåss om|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is it true?|pg||
nt|sheila a: undo - 4@h by E|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzbj: Fila claimer...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 3 aces I would have been doubling 4@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what now ?|pg||
nt|athene: i think passing it was ok|pg||
nt|athene: no-one forced opps to bid game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if @s4 is suit prefernce, is easy|pg||
nt|athene: so if you assume they sort of know what they are doing, making is more likely than -2, surely?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you are probably right|pg||
nt|athene: double might have a big upside if it caused declarer to play you for trump length and go down in a makeable contract i suppose|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  all I need is a singleton in either minor in partner's hand for 2 off|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  may be falt with 5@d - 1 in the other room|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: ikke rart de tar igjen lukket rom|pg||
nt|ady: yes     |pg||
nt|galadriel: 5@C would be a good save - only one down , unless West finds an inspired @D lead|pg||
nt|chick: might tempt W to lead back the @SJ giving another uptrick|pg||
nt|mikeirl: needs to play Hq from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: not difficult|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yorkbeach:  no justice sometimes :(|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with @d4-4, 3NT makes from either side |pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  I seem to remember an old saying "6-5 come alive". Connolly seems to have forgotten it|pg||
nt|mikeirl: they missed the 6@S on Board 4 in Open|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: you could bid 2@H and then if partner raises, you just bid 5@D and put the bidding boxes away to stop her going back to hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldwin this nin dummy and play @h immediately|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes|pg||
nt|petepunt: N may have held qx@H,  need to underlead KH later -|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: just down 1    so should be a push    unlucky for Wales  if they play in 5@D in OR|pg||
nt|simonr: Playing with screens she can't see that!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont blame her for bashing, why tell opps what to lead?|pg||
nt|chick: safety play in @Ds necessary mostly because declarer can't get to hand enough|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kemperg: @DK 9th trick|pg||
nt|kemperg: I had been in 3, not very good here|pg||
nt|lestergold: for some reason hasn't|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  low @h needed now|pg||
nt|petepunt: even when N holds the poss qx @H west should prob play a @S first to clear things up|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live IN RUNNING LADY MILNE SCORES - http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yorkbeach:  + @c could yield several tricks without any ruffs|pg||
nt|sheila a: swings and roundabouts of disciplined pre-empting|pg||
nt|sheila a: Once Burns didn't open it was impossible to come back in|pg||
nt|galadriel: I agree with her pass|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: yes true, double could strike oil|pg||
nt|athene: yes 3nt was not a ridiculous bid, for sure|pg||
nt|coch draig: or even 2N|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if I rebid NT as West It would be 2NT, not 1NT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|chick: you were right, Ralf|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  unusual for Sheila Shea to underbid|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: one slight problem with bashing 3nt on that hand|pg||

nt|athene: i assumed NS bid 4@S over 4@H in the other room but they went there on their own|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@h is an artificial force|pg||
nt|athene: is that west might have four hearts but she will have four clubs less often|pg||
nt|ady: since you know from the bidding the opps have 9+ clubs  that is the likely lead evenif you dont tell them|pg||

nt|athene: i am not saying you should not open it, just that it's a bad hand :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: Not sure how wide-ranging the 2NT rebid is|pg||
nt|sheila a: Probably 15-19; Macdonald will be wondering if slam is on|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think it's 15-17|pg||
nt|petepunt: X unlikely here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbj: de stresser litt for å rekke fly...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would not open|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 4@d as W = @d and @h support|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: 7 eller 8 stikk i 1nt etter alle solemerker|pg||
nt|sheila a: In that case should sign off in 3NT with so little distribution|pg||
nt|galadriel: So she shouldn't get too excited|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  some chance of making 3NT if declarer knocks out the @cA early|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Another 1NT that should play well|pg||
nt|chick: now N needs to shut this down fast, with an opening as bad as that :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also help E with the lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yorkbeach:  EW are consistent|pg||
nt|galadriel: A coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4NT why the hurry?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3@D seemed automatic from east, followed by 3@H from partner|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
nt|mikeirl: you would like @Hs played to protect @S King, but doesn't actually matter on this layout|pg||
nt|kemperg: now she has no clue with @S Hx|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW are gald they are NV|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: W tej sesji bêdziemy mieli okazjê zobaczyæ grê wielu zawodników, gdy¿ co ka¿d¹ rundê nowe pary zasiadaj¹ przy stole :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|simonr: It is a style thing - if partner expects you to routinely open bad 11 counts then it is not a problem - but you need to be consistent|pg||
nt|yo_yo: briony youngs hoping they dont win the first 5 @H tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if the @cK is offside, 5@c is not making either|pg||
nt|sheila a: Greenwood reluctant to underlead her K@c into the strong hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: its a great small slam good enuf grand for Roland and the rabbi|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East might have rather more than 15|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h lead ducked |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  encouraged|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS play reverse, so expecting 9 from S, 2 from North|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  AQ109 well worth the upgrade|pg||
nt|mikeirl: lucky here to get plus score|pg||
nt|jferg: and lose 10 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: well playing a cold,grand in a dodgy 3N is not mtoo impressive|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if declarer goes for spades, South needs to grab the ace and continue hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2NT = both minors weak|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yorkbeach:  laydown without the @d lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on @s finesse now|pg||
nt|ady: this time if 3NT fails   then so foes 5@C|pg||
nt|mikeirl: it'll b a sweat now on the Q@S lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: W nastêpnej sesji bêdziemy towarzyszyæ parze Tuszyñski-Nowosadzki|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  Scotland had a string of above average results in this room|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mikeirl: n room|pg||
nt|coch draig: @c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good play to win trick 1 in dummy - North might have a bare @cA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  card perfect so far for both sides :0|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|coch draig: i think she'll find the @c now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes - in the wrong hand for playing @s|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Brock-Gross have bid game on 9 out of the first 10 boards|pg||
pc|hK|nt|baardolav: spørs om svindahl legger liten spar når det blir spilt... og det gjorde han...|pg||
nt|athene: yes but 3nt might fail a lot more|pg||
nt|kemperg: just made:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yorkbeach:  5@c is less down|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kemperg: well deserved sweat|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if North has !k_x, declarer might not need the spades, so right to play clubs|pg||
nt|coch draig: can take @d finesse anytime|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if South had the @cA she would take it and play a heart|pg||
nt|petepunt: really want to get to 2H but N/S play in @S very well after auction 1@C pass 1@H.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do not think I would want to play them at rubber bridge :)|pg||
nt|ady: this time 11 tricks in 3!T|pg||
nt|lestergold: after the jump Finn was surely worth showing some @d support|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East should trust the defence and continue clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: ¯yczê wszystkim wspania³ych wra¿eñ :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: well, they are only little 50s|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|athene: even if the trump finesse lost you would have chances|pg||
nt|lestergold: lazy bidding in my view|pg||
nt|mikeirl: well bid in open room|pg||
pc|d9|nt|galadriel: The local website for schedule and results :http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: draw trumps, cash hearts, play two rounds of clubs and hope for a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|athene: if you cashed the @CA early someone might have to get cute and throw their king from Kx|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: well done N/S in both rooms|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|yorkbeach:  ruffing the @s did not look right|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why not pitch small @C and play for @S 3/3.|pg||
nt|sheila a: You couldn't totally disagree with someone who upgraded the N hand to a strong NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  plus declarer has cut herself off from the hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: we might see a claim now|pg||
nt|lestergold: what cost exploring slam when pard has shown a big hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: pressure on N|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for round 1 results|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not convinced that was the right way to play @s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North's failure to continue @h marked South with the ace|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  1 more trick for declarer|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: would we say that if @S was wrong, i wonder :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  however, if she played a heart, North could set up a long diamond for South|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sheila a: The score on board 5 was entered on the wrong side.|pg||
nt|coch draig: N could not have 3 aces too|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Briony they wont throw away @HA|pg||
nt|athene: north should wave the @HA around and look bored|pg||
mc|8|nt|jbgood: sesjonens 3. flate spill|pg||

nt|ralfwil: a 3@s opening from N?|pg||
nt|chick: I would think so|pg||
nt|jferg: think 9 tricks in dias is limit|pg||
nt|mikeirl: competitive par score @S & @D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  playing a spade to the king risked losing two spades if North had two low|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yorkbeach:  so maybe right after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  discipline from Woodruff|pg||
nt|athene: 5431 usually you try to open at the 1 level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they play Lucas as 5-5|pg||
nt|athene: if it's close|pg||
nt|simonr: hate these South hands - they are what strong club systems were made for!|pg||
nt|athene: because these are complex hands so you need room to investigate|pg||
nt|athene: but if you have to just jump shift of course you might run out of room anyway|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT     no easy ride|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am a fan of 2@c openings|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too|pg||
nt|galadriel: 4@H for NS|pg||
mb|3C|an|dowolny splinter |nt|sharkey: Slemsonen her...|pg||
nt|athene: also you much prefer to open 1@C on a very strong hand than 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S can get passed out way too easily|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  prefer 1@s to 2NT if they are my only choices|pg||
nt|simonr: That just delays the problem to the rebid|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w hold the power on this hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@C here, but will end with 3NT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes automatic, good save if i down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  expected 10 IMPs to Scotland on 7 when Wiseman-McQuaker bid to 3NT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sheila a: 3NT = a balanced raise to game|pg||
nt|galadriel: high card raise in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: ingen dårlig slem dette her?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Presumably limited|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and then 4@h would be making so on all grounds it was right to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 12 sammenligninger gjenstår - og 30 imp skal hentes inn... |pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know, the Lady Milne is an annual competition, all female.|pg||
nt|athene: i would open that 2@C but close|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT rebid?|pg||
nt|lestergold: on thse hnads you bid to the 4 level and let the opps guess about the 5 level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West rebid 3@c and East probed with 3@d to show the stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not everyone's 1@H overcall at adverse|pg||
nt|athene: it wasn't east's in the other room anyway|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no 2@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  why say the hand is balanced when it is not?|pg||
nt|roswolf: wesy mighr regret opening|pg||
nt|mikeirl: my philosophy 2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sheila a: Play looks straightforward|pg||

nt|sheila a: Careful, you'll end up wired|pg||
nt|galadriel: De-caff :)|pg||

nt|the saint: Looks like South's aggression will cost 800 though|pg||
nt|coch draig: on 7 in other room 3@C was rebid rather than the underbid 1N in here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could still be 800|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT for EW, so not a huge loss even if it is 800|pg||
nt|petepunt: bail out time,  yes|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is going to end up as declarer but unlucky|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they can investigate for a 5 card major|pg||
nt|simonr: Hate showing a game force in spades with such a poor suit. i would show this as balanced and hope to show the 5@S via 5-card stayman|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open 4@s bid poorly judged aceless flat hand|pg||
nt|jferg: lead as expected|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  3@d is pushy, imo. this is either a dead minimum 3@d or a maximum 2@d rebid|pg||
nt|sheila a: Punch encouraged to go on by her Q@d|pg||
nt|the saint: But if West gets her ruff, is there a loser on loser on the 4th round of the suit?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: Hvis Sven Olai cuer nå er de i slem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Anita :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: East can easily be kept from enjoying her @h|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yorkbeach:  might have anyway if North bid 2NT over 2@s|pg||
nt|athene: with a different 5431 i might pretend i was balanced but that one it doesn't look like a necessary distortion|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as a believer in suit quality, I would open 1@d as North|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: I slem er @CK kanskje utspillet?|pg||
nt|sharkey: LR spilt av V...|pg||
nt|jbgood: og de har fått den på rett hånd hvis syd forsøker et kløverutspill|pg||
nt|athene: slightly tricky now on the entries front|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lead resolves the @c suit nicely but declarer still a trick short|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Best for brYony not to cover|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might think the @cK is offside and try a @d to the king|pg||
nt|athene: declarer doesn't know the @CK is right so might not use her dummy entry to repeat the club hook|pg||
nt|athene: yes, there are lots of options, not trivial to play|pg||
pc|d5|nt|baardolav: Men vil vel gå bet... det er ingen vinnende variant enn å spille AK i hj to runder trumf og tre runder ruter, så innspill i kløver|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  1@h would not have occured to me|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: you need a spade as entry to the diamonds but that means you can't untangle 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s + 2@h + 2@d + 2@c = 9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if E does not cash the @hK, time to set up @d|pg||
nt|athene: spade return now would be my guess|pg||
nt|athene: east has taken long enough now that she obviously hasn't got the @CA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is a first cap for West, Dinah Caplan, a rubber bridge player, i believe|pg||
nt|athene: with the @CA she would have cleared the hearts a long time ago|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  long pause is telling declarer who has the @cA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East would be playing @h if holding a sure entry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ahh  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  entries now to set up a @h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 2@H tricks now|pg||

pc|d8|pg||

nt|sheila a: wondering about a @c hook now|pg||
nt|lark20: It is now or never|pg||
nt|sheila a: she could knock out the @d A and come back to dummy with A@s later|pg||

nt|marekw: running scores http://kongres.brydz.wlkp.pl/wyniki2011/sb1.html|pg||
mb|2D|an|odwrotka|nt|simonr: Double first and then bid NTs at the lowest level to show this hand|pg||
nt|athene: you double and hope partner has the common courtesy to bid 1@S so you can bid 1nt rather than having to bid 2nt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not this time|pg||
nt|ady: again 3NT   or 5of a minor|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@d seems obvious|pg||
nt|simonr: South thinking about 1NT or 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: south considering 1nt?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  once you subtract a king, the hand is definietly not worth 3@d|pg||
nt|galadriel: Scotland's intrepid young South found the pre-empt|pg||
nt|coch draig: will still get to 3N|pg||
nt|petepunt: S may X this |pg||
nt|petepunt: good card fro a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  lead directing overcall :)|pg||
nt|athene: East is a regular Overcalls R Us 24/7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  assume that West is the one thinking|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though not clear why|pg||
nt|simonr: Ax could result in wrong siding 1NT so 2@D is prefered|pg||
nt|athene: south decides she can't have that much as she didn't overcall 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: likely to be 3NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: I'd have bid 1@s with the West hand|pg||
nt|chick: NS play weak NTs|pg||
mb|2S|an|silna 4|nt|yo_yo: 3@H usually preemptive...|pg||
nt|lestergold: good enuf on a finesse basically little less than 50% |pg||
nt|mikeirl: ? pass from W|pg||
nt|jferg: not geting any encouragement to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Burns-Greenwood play that a 2 over 1 response is game forcing|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: they might reach 3nt|pg||
nt|sheila a: not a sequence that comes up every day|pg||
nt|lark20: most would but in this instance may regret it|pg||
nt|henryb:  one of those bids that work out sometimes and produce a disaster sometimes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  alwasy bidding game once North does not pass 1NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would be a bit of view to pass, even with 4333 shape |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  AK ruff|pg||
nt|petepunt: always likely to get to 3@S but cards are very badly placed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @H switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: Yes, N.I. bid to 5@D on Board 6|pg||
mb|6N|nt|sharkey: Kopi av meldingene i LR|pg||
nt|yo_yo: obviously not for the welsh NS|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South has a tough call|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s is better but the hand has a lot of losers|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might put up the @SQ confidently on a small spade lead and lose all faith in human nature :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT might make if declarer picks the clubs, as she might given the opening bid|pg||
nt|sheila a: In the other room they may not be able to stop so low|pg||
nt|roswolf: no 41H|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel n/s are encouraging it .... in a way...|pg||
nt|mikeirl: hard to watch - |pg||
nt|lestergold: unbelievable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade lead  holds to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here's the 9th trick assuming she ducks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  who is ducking and risking a @s switch?|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might rise ace, scared of a spade shift?|pg||
nt|ady: might go up with ace |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but if West has a @h honour, it will be tough for her to switch|pg||
nt|ady: would worry about a spade switch  beffore clubs are set up|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  remember North has made a TOD|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and E has shown 5+ @h|pg||
nt|athene: interesting though - if you think east would lead a spade from @SKQJ on this bidding, then she pretty much has to have both hearts for the opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: SHOULD MAKE SHOULDNT IT!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cannot think there is more chance of beating 4@h than amking 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: yes, opps didn't interfere|pg||
nt|coch draig: 2@s invitational with 4 spades (nf)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes it sounds like NS are playing non-promissory Stayman|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will be pleased with the size of teh club led|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  must be 4-4 as East did not double 2@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  still scope to misguess @h|pg||
nt|coch draig: the hearts could not lay better|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should you lead the J - catering for AQ or Q9 onside?|pg||

nt|lestergold: well west must come to a @d trick so looks like 1 off|pg||
pc|s5|nt|coch draig: i'd lead the @h2|pg||
nt|petepunt: @D loser will go away|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|galadriel: I understand you have to bid 1NT in the system, but I'd feel uncomfortable about not bidding that nice @C suit|pg||
nt|sheila a: The defence blissfully unaware of N's 6 card suit|pg||
nt|sheila a: Although this sequence normally shows some @c length|pg||
nt|pfbr: what would q@cs mean?|pg||
nt|galadriel: Give partner Qx and 3NT could be rolling home|pg||
nt|chick: it's still possible for N to go wrong, but not easy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suitplay does not have enough memoery for the @h combo|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|simonr: Going down now. Wrong minor to play on|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yorkbeach:  yes only 1 down|pg||
nt|petepunt: where are the K@S K@D is Norths question|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do not understand this line of play|pg||
nt|sheila a: Q asks for attitude so might have been from KQ|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: even if you put in the @S10 and then set up the diamond for a spade pitch, you still have to negotiate the clubs for one loser|pg||

nt|yo_yo: do we open the south hand?|pg||
nt|athene: that was a very pushy 3@H bid in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not for me, by a long shot|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not me|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not this S either|pg||
nt|kemperg: bossy like mine|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  welcome to Peter Goodman|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so could not hold both kings|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  amazingly low scoring second half|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3nt ew here?|pg||
nt|petepunt: aft all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  strong notrumps tend to open all 5332 hands that are in range 1NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but most weak notrumpers would open 1@s on the South hand|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yorkbeach:  3 IMps in 8 boards|pg||
nt|ady: once trhe diamonds went 5-1   should have played a low club  frather than ace  to keep communications|pg||
nt|roswolf: possible slam hand now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: A Roland slam in @ds probably too good fro him|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: can the defence come to a spade ruff to beat 4@H here?|pg||
nt|sheila a: EW will escape to @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H looks obvious for north|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This board suits my system. 2@s forcing with 4+@h support and no @s control, 2nt forcing with @s control|pg||
nt|mikeirl: hard to find @D fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h partial for NS|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  EW bid 5@d in the other room|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT looks a more likley resting place|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  simplifies the auction :0|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|coch draig: speclative 5@d|pg||
nt|petepunt: a big bid|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: one of my pet hates, that   - rebidding 1NT with a singleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes but it shwos the values, whereas 2@c does not|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4N quanti, paas?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: NIBI bid more aggressively to 3NT on board 6|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it could be a very awkward slam if the clubs were not dropping|pg||
nt|mikeirl: or D not breaking :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i assume after 1nt rebid north is bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to beleive North is not bidding 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: that north hand doesn't say "3nt" to me, i must admit|pg||
nt|galadriel: Greenwood has a very minimum X - poor 15 and horrible lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may raise quantitatively|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: quickly|pg||
nt|lark20: In the other room N/S were in 3NT on board 6|pg||

nt|athene: 1nt rebid weak for this pair|pg||

nt|yo_yo: no|pg||
nt|simonr: Checkback to look for 2|pg||

pc|s4|nt|sheila a: But it gets them into a good part-score|pg||

nt|simonr: 26|pg||
nt|yo_yo: undo again |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT will not be a success|pg||
nt|simonr: Undo again - 3NT by West!!!!!!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  whichever side plays it :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: this is no picknick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lack of entries to the @h is the main problem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: north must think she has entries|pg||
nt|athene: well this auction does have one advantage which is that west has no idea what to lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could be a big swing on this board|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H looks also to be down 1|pg||
nt|simonr: t dosen't matter though - off on any lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  why is 4@h down one?|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H would make surely played by north|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is 4@H down?|pg||
nt|simonr: $@H makes with the fortunate spade position|pg||
nt|yo_yo: look at the @S position|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  unclear why South played the K when dummy did not cover|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: if played by south then maybe the @SJ lead would give a spade ruff to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|simonr: Getting late - too many typing errors!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  how could South get to play 4@h?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: jims åpning i lukket fikk farten opp på Nils - med rundsits i minor (som han vet det ikke kan være) hadde han vunnet 6|pg||
nt|athene: open a strong notrump?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yorkbeach:  hard to blame West|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK ik wist niet wat de blauwe kleur precie betekent. nu wel, bedankt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is this play right?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I can understand playing the K first becuase a ruff in dummy is possible|pg||
nt|petepunt: i think a big thankyou will be given to het partner for the dummy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  these repeat plays suggest West actually played the J first|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I hate leading from J-x-x|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: Selv med 21 HCP åpnet Ø med 1@D - vanskelig å vise 2 fargehender etter 2@C åpning|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|athene: that's what south did, isn't it? :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no singleton kings this time|pg||
nt|sheila a: Nash obviously unaware that McGowan opens light regularly in this position|pg||
nt|sheila a: double would have worked well|pg||

nt|ady: J10@S stiff helps 4@H     agreed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we do not have the result from the other table on this board as yet|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer has one entry to dummy now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petepunt: suspect paly recorded wronh here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a great achievement |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I hope to break the record some day too :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|simonr: England Coach suggested it was certifiable to opne or rebid 2NT on Board 25 with this type of shape so strong NT would be similar!|pg||
nt|roswolf: well maybe only 10 now|pg||
nt|petepunt: scot have dripped 12 imps so all close again.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kemperg: entry killing play:(|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hoping this is a mistake by the operator rather than declarer|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sheila a: It can be off-putting to double 1NT with no tempting lead|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  the record I am trying to avoid is playing junior camrose and senior camrose but not in between :)|pg||
nt|chick: NIBU has closed the gap to 9 IMPs|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that sort of statement sounds like an english coach :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard 2 @c on thi high @s and claim 12 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: what?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West must have lost track of the spades|pg||
nt|athene: west decided that the north hand was getting a bit left out of proceedings|pg||
nt|simonr: Certifiable!|pg||
nt|athene: so invited her back into the party|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d3|nt|ady: cant really see any merit in the heart switch|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  now we know why North bid 3NT|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|sheila a: Burns finally gets into her hand to take the finesse|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|galadriel: Although more people are using the "let's get into the auction" style of X of NT rather than penalties|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h3|nt|athene: maybe west thought that declarer was out of spades |pg||

nt|simonr: Can we get a score manually entered for Board 26?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they cannot have played it - there would have been a long pause|pg||
nt|simonr: Another 11pt opening here?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not for me|pg||
nt|athene: if you open 24|pg||
nt|athene: then you open this one for sure|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Q1098 is worth more than 2 points I imagine|pg||
nt|athene: that west hand way better than board 24|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 24 has more shape|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with @d 2-2, 3NT is looking good|pg||
nt|simonr: If 1@c is your opening then I am there.|pg||
nt|roswolf: now west has a nice hand but east doesnt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s now on EW|pg||
nt|petepunt: 91 scot 90 eng|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: looks like 450 here - is there some reason for avoiding the trump finesse?|pg||
nt|athene: ok i really don't understand that |pg||
nt|mikeirl: good game to have bid;  may be missed in Open|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer should have played the second @s from hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: ni/wal/nibu all so close at other end too.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: best is a diamond part score for e/w   |pg||
nt|simonr: You will quickly find if you have a major fit |pg||
nt|petepunt: or put in the J@S|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 1@c = 2+ for EW|pg||
nt|sheila a: It doesn't feel reasonable to have to pass the West hand|pg||
nt|lark20: Will Connolly prefer to "come alive" with her 7/5 shape|pg||
nt|sheila a: As it happens, they have no good fit|pg||
nt|petepunt: as we know bridge 60% concentation 20% technique and then the skill and luck is a small factor|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  25 was another 6 to Wales Woodruff-Ingham bid and made 4@h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  wonder whether EW have any system here|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  I think there were enough points missing for North to have had the @sQ|pg||
mb|2C|an|transfer to 2 diamond|nt|yorkbeach:  if you cross with a @d and the finesse loses, you may suffer a ruff|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  unlikely to reach game now|pg||

nt|sheila a: no signs of life so far|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  all the players must be feeling the pressure|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: she|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have been so tempted to pass as east opposite a multi|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS have done well to find the sacrifice at adverse vulnerability|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mikeirl: now a good chance 4@H will b missed|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@D and then??|pg||
nt|petepunt: sure @SK + another is best but @SK and then @D is a no play line.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would have passed 1@c with the East cards but I know some players hate to pass|pg||
mb|3H|an|inwit do koñcówki;nie musi miec 4 kierów|nt|simonr: No opening - not sure this is a consistent approach. QT98 looks more than 2 points|pg||
nt|athene: west can just bid 3nt now to catch up|pg||
nt|sheila a: Macdonald's dredged up 1@s bid has kept Burns out of hte auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the blocked diamond position however means 5@h is on|pg||
mb|4D|nt|yorkbeach:  if you cross by ruffing a @c, it promotes South's @s9|pg||
nt|sheila a: Playing 5 card majors it's easy to respond 2@h of course|pg||
nt|petepunt: i passed once came out in a rash:)  very tempting to bid at this vul|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it will take a @h lead to beat 4@s I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  + you cannot pick u the trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: caplan plays rubber bridge,  she wont finesse|pg||
nt|athene: aggressive 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: why open balanced 11 counts, not for me|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS can't really make anything|pg||
nt|chick: one keycard may give E pause|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  make all 13 double dummy unless N leads a @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it would be inconsistent to pass as dealer and then rebid 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: hang partner for a 3rd hand opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: do EW play multi?|pg||
nt|athene: i thought three weak-twos|pg||
nt|athene: if east has 2@D opener available then 1@D-2@D should be a hand, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS play a Multi but not EW|pg||
nt|simonr: You need to cut partner some slack if they open in third at this vulnerability - East must be the one to move on|pg||
nt|galadriel: Some Souths might overcall 1NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: Better was 2@H by N|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will need careful play with spades 4-1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  much more careful than on the previous board|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: this is not trivial|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a heart lead the diamond guess is needed|pg||
nt|kemperg: right|pg||
nt|kemperg: normal start against a strong hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: def. not @S|pg||
nt|kemperg: or @DJ:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: north thinking about the lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: still!?|pg||
nt|chick: this would have been much better with a cuebidding sequence|pg||
nt|petepunt: no 4@S at this table!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: now problem for south|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have lead @H10|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Using cuebids will work much better here than 4nt|pg||

nt|galadriel: Given the rubbish that people open ( and respond) on - you may get robbed|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  North should know her partner has 4 trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no of X 5@d either :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yorkbeach:  same play to the first two tricks in the other room|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2 aces and four trumps would be enough for m,e|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: clubs cleared then would hold to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North could have stopped 9 tricks by playing king and another club|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another finesse coming up|pg||
pc|c9|nt|galadriel: Although it's bot a great 15 count - maybe would prefer another point..|pg||
nt|sheila a: or two|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: of course not ace and another, losing to @SK9xx|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: after 4@s - 5@c - 5@d, 5@h, - 6@s|pg||

pc|sT|pc|d8|pg||

nt|athene: wow, NS in the other room scored 170|pg||
nt|athene: what went wrong!?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and why 6@s? singleton @c and @dK|pg||
nt|chick: right|pg||
nt|chick: both of which have not yet been shown|pg||
nt|kemperg: only possibility|pg||
nt|eamongall: some Norths would hit on a lucky 2@h bid which would have helped South ...mind you ruffing  2nd @S and a good @C guess was 5@D |pg||
nt|petepunt: may gain as 4@S may well be let thru' other way.|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: czekamy na przeciwników..|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: I think North will open this - not my style though|pg||
nt|sheila a: On board 10 Wiseman-Mcquaker got to 3NT. Going quite a few off, I think.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is interesting|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yorkbeach:  club forces needed to stop 10 tricks|pg||
nt|petepunt: new leaders i suspect are ENG|pg||
mb|2C|nt|simonr: Wrong - good job I did not do the lottery this week|pg||
nt|ady: diamond partial |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  horrible spade intermediates|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  excpet spades outrank diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: NS will end up in 3@S i expect?|pg||
nt|simonr: Doesn't always stop Laura though|pg||
nt|galadriel: This is a tricky hand for NS|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  E switched to a trump|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: this board will go in their memoires: "2011: a good year on the whole, but i missed a vul game in april"|pg||
nt|sheila a: was it S who opened 1@h?|pg||
nt|galadriel: That may not be the auction :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR getting far behind|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: wow, no overcall|pg||
nt|sheila a: Not sure why x and not just 3@h|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yorkbeach:  out of character for Brock-Gross to stop in a partial|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no stopping this NS|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: is that 3@H a one-round force or GF?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would not bid 3@h but I would bid on after 1@s-1NT-2@h-2@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you cannot be serious|pg||
nt|ady: still thinks spade pips bad|pg||
nt|simonr: She needs a nicotine fix!|pg||
nt|lestergold: auction in closed suggested the need for a @d lead as clubs wasnt doubled and hearts had been bid|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough choice for East here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yo_yo: undo|pg||
mb|d|nt|simonr: .|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  operator, we do not believe North's bidding|pg||
nt|athene: and she didn't double 1nt for the black suits either|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or rather lack of it|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she has given up dubious competitive actions for Lent|pg||
nt|lark20: 4@H would have been safer|pg||
nt|sheila a: the @c position is a gift for declarer|pg||
nt|sheila a: You never know whether to lead your suit into declarer's known K so that it's set up|pg||
nt|sheila a: or to look for partner's entry|pg||
nt|mikeirl: message from Open that Patsy (South) has left the table feeling unwell|pg||
nt|kemperg: pity|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: She was maybe a bit too strong in points to open that at the one level|pg||
nt|sheila a: she's done well|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Scotland gained the expected 10 on 11 - South went in with the @sA but Wiseman was surely makinh anyway|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  show the sixth spade|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Ingham and Woodruff are finding the form that won them the trials|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  time to switch even if East does not lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have a lot of aces|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what is 2@c?|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2-way checkback, forcing 2@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East does not appear to be worth a game try|pg||
nt|roswolf: no this will fizzle out assuming east leads @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: MIGHT WELL TRY A SPADE|pg||
nt|petepunt: just the 3 losers it seems here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT would be East good as it happens|pg||
nt|petepunt: A good reason NOT to play strong 10s as North is unsure where the a@C is|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so they have time to get a third club trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: no this contract is doomed|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C hook is needed, but not normal play|pg||
nt|lestergold: Robert Ewen recommends attacking lweads against small suit slams on these tyope of auctions as more likely to give the contract than give an essential trick by leadiing from an ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: honour in an unbid suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  too unliateral for me - hope Hamman fans will forgive|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now north is in the pre-balancing seat|pg||
nt|sheila a: Obviously didn't want to call it a balanced hand and open some form of 2NT equivalent|pg||
nt|lestergold: great classic on opening leads|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and surely must double 2@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: checkback - 7 loser hand  ?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C forces 2@D|pg||
nt|simonr: Checkback? They play two-way checkback|pg||
nt|athene: either to play or to make an invitational bid|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is not optimal when you are a passed hand facing a weak notrump rebid and hence can't really game force|pg||
nt|sheila a: no value in overtaking - need partner to have 2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play @dK and N should follow with @d10|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yorkbeach:  totally out of character for North|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess it's easiest to just keep the same methods throughout|pg||
nt|ady: should make 9 tricks   so might be a part score swing for england|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|simonr: We have had a 6 IMP swing on the previosu board but Wales went off in 3NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: decalrer's only chance is to duck a club and then hope the defence don't work out to cash the @HA after @SA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lizzie might switch now |pg||
nt|athene: then she might make 4 spades, 2 clubs and 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not as easy here wbuty @h is surfely wrong|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: she knows declarer has 5@C|pg||
nt|eamongall: whats the rules for a player unfit to continue ... not sure you can change a pair in |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: ok, difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats is taking passivity to extremes o0n the wrong kind of situation|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|yorkbeach:  guess which major to play|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mikeirl: another flat bd :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@h would be even more unilateral|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yorkbeach:  defenders took 3@c 1@d 1@h|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yorkbeach:  W entry gone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no point ducking with 3 tricks lost already|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petepunt: think she is playing E for A@C|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North will be feeling gloomy at this point|pg||
nt|athene: she has to decide now whether to play the legitimate line (win and hope the @HA is not with the club)|pg||
nt|kemperg: she's back i believe|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: or the sneaky line|pg||
nt|athene: of ducking the club and hoping for no heart shift|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C now and  a @C on the 3rd @H|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kemperg: other pair might have seen the hands|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  spelt it right second time :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|petepunt: as I said all 3 bids possible.  3N only good cos of partenrs 9@D|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  why not cross o the @cA and throw a @h on the @d9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  low @s now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yorkbeach:  if they still have 5 boards to play, the players will be doing well to avoid a time penalty|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  pause is good news for declarer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she'll start cheering up about now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now it was a guess instead of knowledge|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jbgood: likespill - hjelper lite for Kristiansand|pg||
nt|petepunt: ...|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: yes, and claiming right about now :)|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  England gained 11 on 15 when Godfrey played Lane|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of 4@S you tend to wander into, i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: as expected NS found a 5-4 spade fit in the other room and bid what larry would want them to bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  correction 4 boards|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but still a tall order in 18 minutes|pg||
nt|simonr: Three more - 30 - 32|pg||
nt|ady: rngland now a useful lead  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 29 the England NS competed to 3@s|pg||
nt|galadriel: They did very well to stay so low|pg||
nt|sheila a: partner's @s values were useless without an entry|pg||
nt|kemperg: ???|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@H in OR much better:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: This is surely a hand in which north needs to pklay partner for a major suit trick probably heart 1a and help in @ds|pg||
nt|lestergold: what otyher hope can there be on the auction?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe some back for Scotland there|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 5-4 spade fit and some hcp|pg||
nt|petepunt: we may have jsut seen the hand that wins the LMilne |pg||
mb|1C|nt|yorkbeach:  EW bid a very aggressive 4@s at the other table|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  standard law of total tricks stuff |pg||
nt|galadriel: They have scored board 10 as Scotland making 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: conservative pass|pg||
nt|kemperg: from East|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: yup suprising|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  routine 3NT for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 140 ser ut som en bra score for Bergen|pg||
nt|athene: they might stop out of it here though if west only makes a try|pg||
nt|ady: mis fit    wuill play 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Kennewell viewed not to open 1NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: It seemed the defence should have been able to defeat that|pg||
nt|sheila a: Punch may have been considering a 1NT opening|pg||
mb|3N|an|4hearts-3-3-3;18-20PC|nt|yorkbeach:  if it is not making even with the @cKJ onside, it is a poor contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  allowd Brock an easy 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is the only board the other room has not played|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: now she wanders in|pg||
nt|lark20: with 1/4/4/4 hand they like to have 13+ points to open|pg||
nt|petepunt: not been a good day for the weak NT although west should now offer NTs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @c lead beats 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT   a struggle|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think the auction is wrong here, no?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: hmmm, looks like W thinks this is puppet?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not 3nt?|pg||
nt|chick: and their CC says puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: fall of the @C10 is nice|pg||
nt|chick: because if puppet, then 3@D shows a 4 card major and 4@D shows both|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: 2NT forcing   after 2 level response|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer reads the suit|pg||
nt|simonr: 2/1 FG style so 2NT is forcing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kaye might consider a slam now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there ought to be a law that all English players should play Acol :)|pg||
nt|ady: might get a diamond lead in 3NT     then better|pg||
nt|simonr: ...and still drive in the slow lane!|pg||
nt|simonr: West must be thinking about a slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3@H is a gross overbid by East - X would seem normal|pg||
nt|mikeirl: as partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is an example when p may have a yarboro|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should X 1@s to show a strong NT hand with no suitable bid?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  ie. no @s stopper|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but @d is coming for sure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yorkbeach:  I realise I am a bit of hypocrite|pg||
nt|roswolf: going boldly where angels fear to tread is a recipe for disaster|pg||
nt|roswolf: hnmmmm why didnt north double?|pg||
nt|kemperg: lady heard our former comment:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do the defence have time to switch to @h?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yorkbeach:  a difference in system results in a different declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  easy for South to lead the @dQ|pg||
nt|athene: a cautious view from west but of course playing a strong notrump, this sequence typically shows a weak notrump from opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: caramba|pg||
nt|chick: I think they have a misunderstanding going here, where E forgot puppet :(|pg||
nt|mikeirl: lucky not to be doubled|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sheila a: 2@c checkback, so that Greenwood can invite |pg||
nt|sheila a: I'd rather be in @s than NT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yo_yo: very wise|pg||
nt|simonr: Well judged by Kaye|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I have not played the defence to 1NT that my brother and I invented for a long time|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead  could be best    other  leads clould cost|pg||
nt|sheila a: has effectively shown this as  strong NT|pg||
nt|eamongall: I suspect this is doomed for several 50s |pg||
nt|petepunt: as E/w playu a weak NT they dont play support dbls so this hand is tough |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West could have rebid 2NT or 3NT to give her partner the choice|pg||
pc|d2|nt|simonr: You mean Cappaletti!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tough to find the @s lead unless South doubles|pg||
nt|yo_yo: landy?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes he has taken over the name :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 hearts and a spade should be easy enough i think|pg||
nt|chick: E now thinks they are cuebidding, and W thinks they are trying to choose a major :(|pg||
nt|chick: our operator can tell us afterward what happened :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: heart back and then J@S  |pg||
nt|athene: sure, but you just rise ace and play clubs to keep north out|pg||
nt|sheila a: bidding this way guarantees 5@s|pg||
nt|galadriel: North implying a 5th @S by going through checkback|pg||
nt|galadriel: otherwise she could bid a direct 2NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: Greenwood will probably ruff a @d in dummy and consequently get @s wrong.|pg||
nt|galadriel: This should make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: many times it´s better to bid 3nt as well as asking for majors|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2NT is what I would have bid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: well jim this is bridge but not as we know it!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbgood: sjelden rett å selge ut til 1 grand hvis du har en unnskyldning for å melde|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: kløver 6 er Lavinthal i avkast.. Jon tegner og forklarer|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  this was not the moment for a count signal in @c|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sheila a: A@c onside means all well|pg||
nt|galadriel: Or - could make|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West has 2 @c entries|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: maybe go up with A@S    and play the clubs to keep north off lerad|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yorkbeach:  would you be playing higher @s as East trying to show the @hK?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|simonr: 18-12 to England in VPs at present|pg||
nt|ady: sorry William   you were first|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the other table has now finished|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: north can see the pitch coming on the long club so gets active|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think this can be made by careful play declarer can afford to lose two trump tricks but jmust arrnage to organise two ruffs somehow|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|thedoc: has this table actually played board 26 yet?|pg||
nt|petepunt: still has chances with @D blocked|pg||
nt|petepunt: East needs kH lese making|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: now decalrer's problem is just keeping an entry to the @HJ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yorkbeach:  West can afford to cash the @d and get a signal|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jbgood: tegningen er postlagt - forklaringen: Gjør hva du vil makker - jeg har alt du ikke har:)|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have done better to just lead hearts towards dummy for a club pitch|pg||
nt|athene: would make 9 that way|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  thanks everyone - see you a bit later|pg||
nt|athene: just rely on the @CK onside|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: east maybe intending to bid 3@S over 3red|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only 9 HCP but controls in every suit and a fifth trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: needed to make sure she got 5@h, 3@s and 2@c|pg||
nt|kemperg: for me too strong for 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: but works well here|pg||
nt|petepunt: eng have max so scot need 18VPs. about 16imps i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Macdonald seduced by the vulnerability into bidding one more|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  brave bid by Sheila Shea when she knows teh suit is breaking badly|pg||
nt|petepunt: is this a forcing pass situation ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think so|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  splinter should make it so|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  England made 90|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so this baord cannot be flat|pg||
nt|petepunt: cam make on @D guess|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: that typically shows a strong but flexible hand these days rather than just a really big one-suiter|pg||
nt|simonr: Should make 140 if you find the @SJ so a small swing here to Wales|pg||
pc|c4|nt|galadriel: perhaps EW have the agreement that Michaels is weak or strong|pg||
nt|sheila a: Never mind, next door NS have missed game on board 10 and chosen instead to play in a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|sheila a: I like 4@s much better than 3NT|pg||
nt|lark20: infinitely better|pg||
nt|lestergold: the defence will get tyhe first 6 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jbgood: vanskelig å vinne imp her og for vertene, er vel bare teori som kan hindre Bergen å reise hjem med seier|pg||
nt|athene: club to ace, trump to king, trump?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might pitch a @s on the @d an avoid the @s guess|pg||
nt|sheila a: It looks as if in the other room McQuaker was trying to re-transfer but Wiseman didn't take the hint|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mikeirl: yes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sheila a: shortage of entries means Grant has to play for trumps behaving |pg||
nt|sheila a: defence can socre a ruff now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: this will be tricky - in big danger of losing three trumps and a heart|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@H a surprise but could be right choice|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4 brds to score|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: could lose 3@H, 2@S and 1@C on a bad day|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  most play that pass then pull shows a slam try|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sheila a: difficult for declarer - if lead was a singleton, need to go up with A|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|simonr: Then where does the @C go?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if that is what North has done, she is an optimist|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d5|pc|sA|nt|galadriel: so with intermediate hands like this one, just have to overcall|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|athene: i think the only winning line was to get some sort of endplay on south in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but that would mean cashing the top diamonds without playing a second round of trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good evening everyone|pg||
nt|athene: and of course you might then run into a ruff just on normal breaks|pg||
nt|sheila a: are you sure?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: so i think no reason to get this one right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from manchester|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: sure, the pre-empt makes bad breaks more likely but you can't play for 4-1 trumps right from the start|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|athene: hi :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|petepunt: 12imps back to Wales |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW did not find the sacrifice in the other room|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yorkbeach:  will need to guess @s for 140|pg||
nt|lestergold: nibu still gains on board|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sheila a: That should perhaps have warned E that partner might have defence?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Easy for us to say|pg||
nt|galadriel: So, a few much needed imps for Ireland|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: back to the endplay working now|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  not going to be very exciting|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT or 4@s with overtricks|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last board of this session|pg||
nt|petepunt: 29 30 figure to be good for scot though|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: Siste spill nå ved dette bordet, takk til Snorre for fin jobb som organisator, videoprodusent og operatør!  |pg||
nt|simonr: Operator - can you check the players card for the correct score on 30?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sheila a: EW got a little over-excited in the other room but managed to stop in time|pg||
nt|chick: Many thanks to our excellent operator, Joan Baird!|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4@S normal to bid here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S+1, flat board, yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do you treat the four 5@s as 4?|pg||
nt|simonr: Played 26 in 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Wales have bid and made 4@h in the other room|pg||
nt|galadriel: @H and a minor|pg||
nt|sheila a: 3@s is GF playing lebensohl|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator. Great Job! Our appreciation to the organisers, the NIBU and BGB for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Germ and Anne for their company and perceptive comments. Also to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
mb|1N|an|forcing|nt|yo_yo: give him a chance, he's doing this board :)|pg||

nt|chick: Great job by my fellow commentator, Ralf Willqvist of Sweden. |pg||
nt|chick: And thanks to all the kibs who send us good comments :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes but a lot of cards wrong for declarer|pg||
mb|2C|an|dubel w jednymz kolorów;brak 4 kar|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 4@s better - just testing :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead through the queen makes life harder in 4@H now|pg||
nt|simonr: Support double?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s-4@s from here?|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@S as AQ@C not full value now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  exactly|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: support double|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they play in 3nt|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3N has some chances by S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this may wrong side 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Shows three 1h|pg||
nt|athene: from east's side of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes scheduled re-start in approx 1hr and 5 mins from now|pg||
nt|chick: This event was brought to us by Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and the NIBU (Robin Burns),  and with the excellent support of Roland Wald, our coordinator :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i dont know how e/w managed to stay out of game on this board altho it doesnt happen to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: Takk også til BBO og uoppslitelige Roland Wald (som har holdt på siden 8 i dag tidlig - og som har tatt en pause), og kommentatorer Carl Mathiesen og Baard Olav Aasan!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at the other table North did not lead her partner's suit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i suggest because s bid in the open room|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kemperg: 1 off|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@d belongs to North we assume|pg||
nt|petepunt: plays better by S but still off i suspect|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  29 and 30 are both potentail games for Scotland|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: it might be slightly tricky for declarer to reach dummy twice for this spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: assuming we get a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: she might just finesse once then cash the ace|pg||
nt|chick: I don't see any 23 IMP swing here, so Congratulations to Scotland for winning this match.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: Og takk til tilskuere for interessante innspill - og tålmodighet:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gratulerer til Bergen - og lykke til videre|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't really want to spend half an hour ducking hearts for a heart ruff to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: that might incur diamond ruffs and all sorts|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok|pg||
nt|athene: well that makes life easy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@h is trick on a @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: it does work well to put the overcaller on lead, which is why many pairs play a lot of transfers after overcalls|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. 1@C (1@D) X is hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  correction - South did not overcall at the other table|pg||
nt|sheila a: With a couple of careless efforts there, it's no bad thing that this is the last board of the set|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and 3@s to South|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: well perhaps not the best game but it makes easily enough here|pg||
nt|sheila a: This should take it off|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: right - that's why north didn't lead her suit :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 11 tricks |pg||
nt|roswolf: 10|pg||
nt|chick: Full results can be found at   http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and 4@s to North|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: a reasonable lead, to be fair - on this auction you expect declarer to have three trumps and quite possibly a ruff in hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 10 now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if XX of 2@c would have shown a @c honour, it should be clera to West not to lead a @c|pg||
pc|hK|nt|simonr: Spade laed here would not be a success. We are all taught to laed partrner's suit!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  poor lead here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: partner why dont you lead my  xxxx suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: east still held 3 buillets opposite an opening bid and made no try|pg||
nt|petepunt: now chances exist|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yorkbeach:  @d my choice|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: because it was an xxxxx suit last time!|pg||
nt|chick: Restart tomorrow at 9:00 GMT, 10:00 BST, 11:00 CET, 7:00 pm Sydney|pg||
nt|chick: Hope to see you all here! :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S will make and 4 IMPs to NIBU. Thanks all and good night from Sweden:)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: disastrous bidding by Irish on Board 10 in Open;  playin in 4@S instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h to 9 might well do it|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: yes but this time it's a KJ10xx suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  second chance to lead it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  players getting tired|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sheila a: Yvonne has scooshed home in 3NT on board 13|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if there is a tie in Victory Points both teams receive the award for winning.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: another swing for wales|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: not sure it's wise to finesse again|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is why you should not overcall on xxxxx|pg||
nt|simonr: Got it right this time|pg||
nt|ady: will take the lead on last hand if the scores are correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: seems that south wants to let this thru|pg||
nt|lestergold: if thats at all possible|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|galadriel: On board 13 Scotland made another "unmakable" 3NT|pg||

pc|h7|nt|chick: Thanks everyone :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mikeirl: re|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @hA + ruff looks good enough here|pg||
nt|petepunt: as long as Ruff Small|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even a spade to the king first would be OK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: luckily for south east doesn't hold the curse of scotland|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should be 2 off|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petepunt: rare to lead a single trump when opps only in 4-4 fit.|pg||

pc|s8|nt|yorkbeach:  Rudd and discard|pg||
