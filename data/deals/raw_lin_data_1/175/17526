nt|sga1: Four session to go, only 8 imps difference, any thing possible.|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari should have exited with @ck on winning @SK in last deal, SS was one 1 down|pg||
nt|rv: all 3 teams in the trials are fairly evenly matched though Formidables have the best form in recent months, I anticipate semis and finals to be very close and go down to the wire|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables have been seeded to finals because they won 2 of the 3main qualifying events for the trials, both Summer and Winter Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: Texans won 3rd qualifying event National Masters with very different quorum of team, hence had to pay 5 lacks as direct entry to participate here|pg||
nt|rv: DSM qualified as runner-up of Summer Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: runner-up of Winter Nationals, Poddar Developers did not field team here because of some internal issues, very sad indeed|pg||
nt|rv: 5 lacks translates to 0.5 million rupees, about 10,000 USD:)|pg||
nt|rv: as per current exchange rate approx 11,000 USD|pg||
nt|rv: we have power failure at the venue, lost internet connectivity which means access to game and for Subhash Gupta to be ungagged|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables represented India the maximum times in last decade or so, they have won BFAME 4 times, reached QFs of Bermuda Bowl twice as well as R16 in Rosenblum during this period|pg||
nt|rv: apologies folks, waiting for power and connectivity to be back|pg||
nt|rv: I am not at the venue, doing commentary from home|pg||
nt|rv: P.Sridhar has won silver and bronze medal as part of Texan Aces in 2 successive European Open tournies, SS was part of team when they won bronze and Sumit was part of team when ...|pg||
nt|rv: they silver|pg||
nt|rv: pls stick around, let me call up folks at venue and check|pg||
nt|rv: power just back|pg||
nt|rv: we should be on in a couple of mins|pg||
nt|rv: they do have power back-up / generator at the venue, surprising it is taking awhile|pg||
nt|rv: according to BFI MPs, Pritish Kushari must be amongst the top 3 or 4 MPs holder in the country, he has earned most of the points as part of all-conquering Indian Railways team|pg||
nt|panja: symmetric North hand in blacks....difficult for W to know the best shift unless E could guid|pg||
nt|panja: guide even|pg||
nt|subhranp: slam board early in the day|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rv: for nearly a decade from mid-90s, Indian Railways used to have monopoly of all National team events|pg||
nt|panja: light opening...|pg||
mb|d|nt|sarkar_suk: neck to neck fight nice to watch sudhir :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|chilloncan: S should open with that hand|pg||
nt|sga1: How many would open 3@d with that hand vul, literally 9 loser hand. I would not.|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes :)|pg||
nt|rv: great, we are back on and hi again to Subhash Gupta|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|subhranp: 3nt easier here than 4h|pg||
mb|r|nt|chilloncan: when you dont have spades, you have to get in early or they may make it too awkward for you to compete|pg||
nt|sga1: Doesn't fall into any rule 2-3-4 or not even for aggressive players with 2-3-4-5 rule.|pg||
nt|offthebend: hi all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|alamiro: Excelente Resultado para N-S en la otra sala|pg||
nt|panja: true...with extra strength...and near balanced hands..it is always worthwhile exploring 3N in preference to 4 of a Major|pg||
nt|panja: here though, with all the Aces, North is likely to prefer a @S game|pg||
mb|d|nt|sarkar_suk: thats a good lead for declarer :)|pg||
nt|sga1: 4 quick tricks for defense.|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: 2n presumably jacoby, 3h probably showing 6carder heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: nw trump shift shd be :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: tightly contested semi final so far and I am sure it is going that way till the end |pg||
nt|rv: I might have bid 2n or 3@h with Sridhar's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: But trump shift can only help if N switches to @d after winning @sK|pg||
nt|sga1: so that 2nd trump can also be removed.|pg||
nt|panja: there was that other issue....did S show 5@S with this bidding? his next bid gives us the answer...NO|pg||
nt|panja: so 4@S, it will be...or will it go further?|pg||
nt|subhranp: could go higher|pg||
nt|panja: BTW Subhran, what is 2@D for you?|pg||
nt|panja: 12+?|pg||
nt|subhranp: this could prove costly for DSM|pg||
pc|s5|nt|subhranp: yes|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: both 3n and 4@h have excellent play for N-S|pg||
nt|panja: I was wondering whey Keyzad bid 2@D rather than 2@S|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S would have shown 9-10 or so....|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chilloncan: S actually is not even minimum by Losing Trick Count standards, has playabiulity in at least 2 suits, only mild rebid problems, and can open the suit she wants led. all that adds ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: up to a clear opening bid|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|panja: if he guesses everything right, this could make|pg||
nt|panja: but that is rather unlikely|pg||
nt|panja: on the @CK lead...with correct @S view..there is a red suit squeeze on West|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes right panja..|pg||
nt|subhranp: one can trust keyzad to find those lines|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|panja: Williaim Watson suggests that is the only option.....@CKQ must be in, W must hold 5 @D 4!M..so East must hold 4 Spades to make!|pg||
nt|panja: 5@H4@H, that is|pg||
nt|panja: Keyzad could conjure all that up..he is quite capable of thinking of a way to make this|pg||
nt|panja: and E's first @D will tell him W holds 5@D|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sga1: now -2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|rv: Sundarram is possibly abs minimum for his double and 2@h especially with modern style of O/Cs till 17/18 hcp|pg||
nt|subhranp: laltu not showing any kings so that should end the auction|pg||
nt|ayan: N-S play 2nt as Natural promising 2 + trump|pg||

nt|rv: Subhash Gupta is affectinately called Guruji (master) in Indian bridge circles:)|pg||
nt|rv: Guruji what would be your recommended auction in last deal?|pg||
nt|subhranp: well..i wouldnt bet against a DSM vs Form final now|pg||
nt|subhranp: form getting a few imps back on that one|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: interesting board|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ayan: Hi Subs, looks like we will have a full house pretty soon|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW have 5D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sga1: it could be 2@h/3@H depending on whether NS would compete to 3@C or not.|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor sridhar already stretched his 5 points to make a noise|pg||
nt|subhranp: venky could have continue hearts there to put some more pressure|pg||
mb|2C|nt|subhranp: NS are odds on to make 4S here|pg||
nt|ayan: looks like 3 @c is rev bergen |pg||
nt|subhranp: well both Venky and Subhash quiet so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: ok back to this one, Kushari's 2n is jacoby, 4+@h, semibal hand, GF|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sarkar_suk: ofcourse no question of game reach :)|pg||
nt|subhranp: venky coming in aggressively here, finding the spade fit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sga1: 2NT here was natural, opening hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: i think the format of this event this time puts formidables at a bit of disadvantage to start with. they dont have time to settle down|pg||
nt|subhranp: quiet partial this time|pg||
nt|subhranp: 2nt also makes as cards are|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sga1: not Jacoby which many prefer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Jacoby responses have been tailored a lot by different partnerships, traditionally 3 level bids show stiff and 4 level second 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ayan: Very unlike Guruzi Bid, I must admit|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: kushari should find the heart lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: looks like Kushari-Laltu have their own home-grown method here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|subhranp: possibly the vulnerability made them keep quiet|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|offthebend: sry -- I did miss -- PS was forced to bid 2D over the T/O dbl -- in that case , he could take one more bid -- like 2S  over 2H|pg||
nt|subhranp: assuming DSM goes through, they should look to capitalize on the initial rustiness (if any) of Formidables today|pg||
nt|ayan: now Venky may try for the @c J|pg||
nt|subhranp: trump back also should be ok here|pg||

nt|subhranp: since as the match progresses DSM could tire having played longer and Form would begin to get into groove|pg||

nt|vugraphzvz: pl stand bye|pg||
nt|rv: deal where Kushari's misdefense against 2n will now be replayed?|pg||
nt|rv: that will mean 6 IMPs less for Texans and DSM still in lead?|pg||
nt|offthebend: I have just been informed that bd 71 has been cancelled but they will play one extra board |pg||
nt|rv: Pramod, can we adjust the scores here even if we can't watch action on replayed brd?|pg||
nt|rv: possibly deal 71 was foul board because of duplication related issues|pg||
nt|rv: this is not real bidding on this deal, Pramod is getting us back on track|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: sure i shall put the score manually after the board 71 is over|pg||
nt|offthebend: effectively the score stands at 104 -109 in favour of DSM as Mr.Sunit choksi has been fined 2 imps penalty for mobile ringing and bd 71 has to be replayed |pg||

nt|rv: great, we are back on|pg||
nt|ayan: yes Subs, nice to see Harbhajan and Symonds hugging each other|pg||
nt|babs59: Subhash always complains he never holds any cards... so far all contracts here to NS|pg||

nt|babs59: though admittedly EW could make 5D on board 3|pg||
mb|1N|nt|subhranp: i hope not..|pg||

nt|subhranp: NS should bid this slam now|pg||
nt|kareno: Subhash and I owned a rubber bridge club in Toronto many years ago :)|pg||
nt|subhranp: 2c probably transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|2C|nt|panja: one has to be careful about this dbl..seems the normal thing to do..but S will not opt to defend a @S contract after that double|pg||
nt|babs59: yes 2@C = @D suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: 3S here is puppet to 3NT to startwith |pg||
nt|subhranp: 3h cue |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|chilloncan: when playing against opps who use support doubles, there is a reason to bid 2S on the E hand rather than 1S.  a support double typically can be used over 1S but not over 2S|pg||
nt|panja: as I suspected...|pg||
nt|subhranp: laltu thinking of 6?|pg||
nt|panja: this will come down to @D guess in the end|pg||

nt|panja: right....5 is cold|pg||
nt|subhranp: unless club is led|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 2Nt showing some 5-card Major|pg||

nt|offthebend: oh no - looks like it is TRF to Clubs|pg||
nt|subhranp: with those controls, N could have bid 3s|pg||
nt|subhranp: i'm not sure if we are watching the right cards here|pg||
nt|panja: that seems to be their method|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: club continuation could put some pressure on declarer|pg||

nt|panja: going by his tendency..from last session|pg||
nt|subhranp: toss up between minors|pg||
nt|panja: similar bidding last session|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rv: 4@c shows some @c fit possibly, 4@d/4@h cues, 4n is RKC in @Cs, 5@D is 0 or 3 keys|pg||
nt|subhranp: you are bang on panja, venky finds the killer lead|pg||
nt|panja: there is very good rationale behind the choice..|pg||
nt|panja: and Venky is one of the  smartest when it comes to understanding opponent's or any bidding method|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes as partha pointed out, no dbl of 2c or 3c by subhash|pg||
nt|panja: W bid Spades...for 2@C sequence, E is likely to have Hearts...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|rv: sry 5@d is 1 or 4 keys, they play 0314|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chilloncan: with only 3 small trumps and some doubtful values, W was not really orth more than a game invitation. 3H would have  expressed her values more accurately|pg||

nt|panja: most 1Nt opening sequences are pretty bad at finding out 5 of a minor game...especially if the weak suit is other minor|pg||
nt|subhranp: with such a 2 suiter hand, laltu could have considered a safer suit contract|pg||

nt|panja: 6@D if NS escape @S lead..|pg||
nt|panja: if N begins with 2@C.....the minor suits will come out in the bidding...|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: and now I have to leave...thx Subhran, Pramod (great to have a top class bridge player to operate Vugraph) and all, bye|pg||
nt|ayan: Laltu is always the busy guy at table and Kushari just the complement |pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: thanks panja|pg||
nt|panja: so..if N gets to play a @D contract...50% chance of making the slam..(escaping @S lead)..|pg||
nt|subhranp: what would you open panja with Venky's hand?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|sga1: This set DSM got 13 imps in 2 boards, many boards no swing.|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|panja: 4@H again..|pg||
pc|s6|nt|alamiro: En este caso no deberia preocuparle decir 1@D inicialmente con su mano gf, podria luego hacer un reverse y mostraria de una manera mas adecuada su mano!|pg||

nt|ayan: Strange pass from Venky|pg||
nt|panja: EW have many tricks in Hearts.....|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rv: many in India play X of strong nt opening as showing 5+m+4M, to be best of my knowledge this NS pair play double as values |pg||
nt|panja: which bid killed the exploration? 1Nt or W's Pass?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sga1: cold with good @C position.|pg||
nt|rv: PS had poor 16 hcp with no good lead and poor intermediates and wisely decided to pass|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW playing a bit of subdued game, they are still warming up..better get onto the pitch very fast|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|subhranp: this should make with cards favourably placed|pg||
nt|panja: with a 55 fit...to guard against !KQx in inside..declarer must finesse first time which Kushari will do by force of habit|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|offthebend: now 9 tricks |pg||

nt|chilloncan: spec suggests deal generator is programmed for goulasch|pg||
nt|panja: tricky for South..|pg||
nt|panja: he is likely to think he can defend 4@H..and that 5@D might not be a pucca proposition|pg||
nt|subhranp: subhash could have played second round of diamonds before playing clubs|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|rv: scores may not be right here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Like to stay out there|pg||
nt|panja: now, after 1Nt...N will raise..|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: deal 71 might need to manually corrected|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: many pairs play two way weak 2s -- 2M is close to an opening bid, and 2D is a truly weak 2 in one majopr|pg||
nt|alamiro: Cuando se abre de preventiva los valores deberian estar concentrados en el palo de apertura, tiene algunos extras laterales|pg||
nt|alamiro: supongo que 3@s es buen palo y buena mano|pg||
nt|alamiro: Norte debe rematar 6nt para proteger su K@d|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for me S has a 1H opener, but even without the 2-tiered weak 2s, there is an ultraconservative school of weak 2s that the S hand fits perfectlt. Matt Granovetter for example uses ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this style, which derives from the dawn of weak 2s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this looks like Ogust|pg||
nt|panja: Sorry missed the play of the last deal....|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: and 2Nt might be too high, even 1Nt might not make on a bad day|pg||
nt|panja: excellent lead..|pg||

nt|rodal f: QJ block @D make it a -10 for me|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|panja: the @DA....improves the combination..|pg||

nt|rodal f: But @D could been 3-3|pg||
nt|panja: difficult lead problem..I guess small @H best choice|pg||
nt|subhranp: this would be interesting|pg||
nt|subhranp: kushari will signal clubs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: and @H Q could get played here..|pg||
nt|panja: because S wants to tackle @D asap|pg||
pc|c8|nt|alamiro: En mi opinion si voy abrir 1 mano de 11 ptos a nivel de 1, es porque tengo un 2do canto sin ninguna dificultad, en este caso Sur pudo abrir de 1@h y luego rematar 2@h y problema ...|pg||
nt|alamiro: resuelto, mano totalmente descrita!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chilloncan: very surprising for N to pass after a 3S reply to Ogust showing super maximum|pg||
nt|alamiro: Ahora pueden ganar 7 si encuentra la Q@C|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe N should have only invited once 2@h was doubled|pg||
nt|panja: W might shift..|pg||
pc|hA|pc|dJ|nt|offthebend: hard to say --- rather play in 6-1 than 4-3 fit with such hands |pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
nt|panja: it is a toss up between @ST, and @H9...|pg||

nt|panja: right..@H continuation is right...because @ST is seen in the dummy|pg||
nt|subhranp: should be -1|pg||

nt|subhranp: venkatesh not sure if Keyzad has HA or not and might be considering knocking out HA if Kushari has it|pg||
mc|10|nt|chilloncan: after all, if N was not going to move towards slam over the strongest rebid that S could make, why on earth bid 2N in the first place?|pg||

mb|p|nt|alamiro: no 5@C por East en serio?|pg||

nt|panja: if E had @C Ace, this would have gone down from cold status|pg||
nt|panja: but possibly, some early carding gave away @C interest of W?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: this should be cold 4@H..will S ruff @C or @S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: N was worth a raise to 3S after the 4 card drury|pg||
nt|panja: or both?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|subhranp: meanwhile DSM have increased their lead thanks to the twin blunders on both tables by Form|pg||
nt|panja: 13 even|pg||
nt|viren169: obvious Spade or Diamond lead ahead of the club.|pg||
nt|panja: because two Spades can be ruffed now...|pg||
nt|viren169: but may choose a @C in a slam!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|d4|nt|chilloncan: in general, the players here seem to be bidding as if the form of scoring were matchpoints or Point-a-Board (where the priority is going plus) rather than IMPs which reward games ...|pg||

nt|key1809: easy slam, but funny things can happen|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|woozle: The only way they can miss a slam is a misunderstanding, after that start (like West passing blackwood)|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: after 2nt, question is 6/7, with 1 ace missing ,will settle in 6s|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|woozle: Someone suggesting that East might panic about his club holding and miss slam that way. If East is going to worry that much, he'll never get from one side of a street to the other|pg||
nt|key1809: prabhakar thinking ,not good |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|key1809: and yes now a chance they might be in grand|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|key1809: alls well that ends well, maybe they knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't know what happened here. Did Praba answer for the wrong suit?|pg||
nt|key1809: maybe it was  DKC  auction|pg||
nt|key1809: but am sure this will be discussed during the break|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: aybe  3@S likes @S?|pg||
nt|woozle: Diamond finesse for the overtrick if Bhabesh doesn't lead the club ace|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|key1809: 4nt was DKC, but the problem is if prabhakar had club ace instead of dmd king, they wd have missed a grand|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|key1809: not a good auction i guess,but we can only speculate as we dont have meanings of all the bids|pg||

nt|rv: other table nearly completed, Sumit and Anil are very fast players|pg||
nt|subhranp: NS close to 3n here|pg||

nt|viren169: another slam here|pg||
nt|panja: 6Nt good here...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|babs59: last board of the day|pg||
nt|rodal f: An interesting one seen from the specs side. Defence and end|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|panja: I doubt this will end up in a game|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: sorry I got the tables wrong, this table has finished earlier|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rv: Barbara is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: but RV, I said that privately :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: open room is playing slow bec of some lighting problems |pg||
nt|rv: thanks to my excellent commentators, Guruji Subhash Gupta and Barbara and insightful comments by all specs|pg||
nt|babs59: and this board doesn't look like Texans can recover IMPs|pg||
nt|subhranp: i guess 2c is other two suits|pg||
nt|subhranp: last board of SF coming up|pg||
mb|4N|nt|panja: 4Nt next?|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: you'd better not play in the Open Room then Subhash :)|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@s most likely|pg||
mb|5H|nt|babs59: you've mis-seen a few bids tonight!|pg||
nt|subhranp: well played DSM|pg||
nt|subhranp: finals starting tomorrow at 9:30 AM IST|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: NS will do well to take out trumps|pg||
nt|subhranp: one spade can be ruffed in dummy and should make|pg||
nt|viren169: no reason for either player to suggest nt|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rv: excellent job done by Vugraph operator Pramod Samant and good organization by Pradeep and KSBA team and Kiruba and BFI team|pg||
nt|offthebend: I would have slept enough tonite to keep my eyes wide awake  :)|pg||
nt|panja: good lead|pg||
nt|subhranp: texans couldnt make 4h on B97 so lead has widened again|pg||
nt|panja: this could go two down now..as W will play @D to K first time..., likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: is this right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: last deal of this set :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: of course there is reason..|pg||
nt|viren169: really?|pg||
nt|panja: W could hae 5 Diamonds...and in 6@S, there could be @D ruff..|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: could be another swing for DSM here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|panja: seems this will be nine tricks..not 11 or 10 as GIB would like us to believe|pg||
pc|s8|nt|subhranp: Formidables directly seeded to Finals|pg||
nt|panja: whereas 6Nt...is not likely to have that risk..|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|panja: but EW can make 11...by using three entries in Dummy to play @S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|babs59: and I just expected a flat board|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|chilloncan: this is one of these rare cases where N can use KC with a small doubleton -- S has shown  4342 shape and a c;ub stop, so she has to have the clubs controlled herself, either ace or ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: king|pg||
nt|panja: interesting..that seemed cold|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|alamiro: Que peculiar criterio al momento de abrir esta mano! en manos anteriores abrio de 2@h una mejor mano que esta!, ahora no paso y abrio de 1@D|pg||
nt|rv: momentum clearly with DSM now and they must be favorites to meet Formidables in finals|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panja: playing @HT to K, @H9 to Q and then @H5 to 8..that was the way to make 11...crazy double dummy way|pg||
pc|h9|nt|viren169: true... but neither player can be sure of the @C suit|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|panja: even 93 for that matter|pg||
pc|hK|nt|babs59: the preemptive 3@C overcall with negative double endplayed North into 3NT at the other table|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chilloncan: yes, the evaluations do seem inconsistent. but this S hand is an opening bid because:|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|psyck: both Souths chose not to look for an 8 card @s fit with a balanced hand|pg||
nt|subhranp: thanks everyone..bye|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chilloncan: 1) the Losing Trick Count is about right     2) there is playability in 3 suits including both majors    3) there is no rebid problem     4) you get to openm a suit you want led|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|panja: ok let us try to make up a combination where 6Nt will fail....|pg||
nt|viren169: it is too bigger risk to take... especially at teams|pg||
nt|panja: as seen by East..|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rv: for all the neutrals, let us hope Texans mount a fightback in 7th segment|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rv: next segment at 10 AM tom morning, 5.30 AM London time|pg||
