nt|Gerben42:  here goes :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcp: we don't wait for the end of 1 board indeed, we wait 10 minutes|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  if you are underdog, better do the same 1 less board where you can lose on|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  which against Fantunes is almost everyone|pg||

nt|ianmcc: except grey hair|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: haha|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one is 20-20 game a stretch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a keep out of trouble hand to start with|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi John :) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may need these,  since this is "not standard" |pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a horrible bunch of misfits - not us - the hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be us also LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if all stay low |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would open N hand  |pg||
nt|sybarra: ak, a|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strong club for N-S|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge: I enjoyed watching Braithwaite & Richman|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Precision a la Angelini|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45: N/S can make a very lucky 3 NT here, but hardly bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: 4H is fair (but down)...vulnerable I'd definitely want to be there|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: can NS really make 3nt? how do they get to dummy to finesse diamonds?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen might very reasonably drive to game here, particularly considering the hands that this pair haven't overcalled|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now what?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be played doubled? |pg||
nt|psyck: 1N=@c or puppet to @c i guess|pg||
nt|athene: maybe in spades, given time :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: @S Jack is the entry|pg||
nt|hawe45: - but I said: VERY lucky|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt might be some either/or bid - those are sort of the norm after strong club|pg||
nt|athene: so clubs or something else, maybe|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: source of tricks very scarc e here|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 @D should end the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, could be a suction variant with @c or red suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and getting scarcer|pg||
nt|sybarra: was typing,  "not sure this is success either"|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 @D is jumping into fire |pg||
nt|sybarra: (out of frying pan)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: best to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ not an entry for trump finesse playing in diamonds :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hawe45: Will be defeated - with the @S-ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45: - not any longer|pg||
nt|athene: now he can just play ace and a diamond, lose @SAK, @DK, @CA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: and its "good luck pard" with a smile |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no double no trouble|pg||
pc|cA|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4S bid is very loose, and possibly down more than one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: rescue|pg||
nt|woozle: Likely phantom|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: only way the contract might go down is spade shift and then try to ruff a club|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: right John!  this can not be worse  (only 50's) |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: then @DK overruff, @S ruff|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|woozle: diamond, diamond ruff, club, diamond ruff, club or heart to come (if the defense don't cash the HA the heart runs away...if they do, two clubs run away)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|athene: but fall of @CQ ought to change declarer's mind|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: ace and a diamond completely safe now|pg||
nt|hawe45: North will hardly ruff @C - seeing the @C Queen coming down |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|d3|nt|woozle: Good hand to show off the law - EW make 9 tricks in their nine card fit, NS make8 tricks in their eight card fit. If 4H was making, 4S would be -500|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @hA what else?|pg||
nt|athene: no way anyone can win the @DK and give his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: well|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: if he had cashed the @CK and seen the queen fall, yes|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: I think we call these kind of hand "buzz sawa" |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: but the way it went it was not so obvious that the @CQ was stiff|pg||
nt|athene: but still|pg||
nt|athene: ace and a diamond was 100% to make 3@D at that point|pg||
nt|hawe45: This will not be the best played hand of the tournament|pg||
nt|athene: definitely very bad play|pg||
nt|athene: i guess "first board syndrome"|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north thought that west had the clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: All beginning is difficult|pg||
nt|athene: since west bid them|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: maybe he did not check what 1nt meant|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: *buzz saws"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: get out fast before you lose your head|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: could have been a lot worse|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: and he did not bother to even ruff high first time|pg||
nt|athene: so he must have been really sure west had club length|pg||
nt|athene: that suggests he just did not pay attention to the bidding|pg||
nt|hawe45: Would not have helped|pg||
nt|hawe45: ruffing high|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: no, of course not, but the fact that he didn't does show he didn't even consider that east might be the one with the long clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: Fred madea point in rec.games.bridge recently avout arriving early to a tournament to free your mind of clutter before the 1st board... :)|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  EW open a weak NT on as many hands as Meckwell 1@D|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This one is very sound|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: their openings at level one are forcing, so thay have to open 1NT any hand that does not match the required strenght|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|c2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: they can but try|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @DA was a good try |pg||
nt|cuttysark: And it may well slow down play :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: if Q@S is in S AND K@D he can still make 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now he will be worried but cannot change it anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: by making 4@ss 2@hs and 3@cs|pg||

nt|woozle: On a good, day, 4H NS might make ten tricks. This is not a good day.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec points out that East's low @d was spot on|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: first board and last board are the killers for keeping concentration|pg||
nt|athene: the ones in between, they are hard too|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: fantoni nunes defended better as usual in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so -2!|pg||
nt|athene: but still should have been a much bigger swing|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D was cold|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: dealer having fun today?|pg||
nt|athene: at the point he won the second club|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 NT better be played by East - only @D-lead brings trouble|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: 1 @S denies 4 sp |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: West not worth 2 bids|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so 1NT shows 4 s then?|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me look for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: hitting the deck again? |pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: he knows E opened 1 @C a "good hand" |pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead and heart back, ducked|pg||
nt|athene: if NS find that you call the director|pg||
nt|hawe45: and the police|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the vul got him|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: good spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades might have been @D,  I am still chedking |pg||
pc|dK|nt|woozle: I'm all for supporting with support, but West's 4D looks excessive with the secondary misfit|pg||
nt|athene: worth pointing out that if north at any points found the @H7 lead(and south had not led the suit) and declarer plays the king, south has to duck|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: very common to duck the first round if you have AJx(xx) over KQx|pg||
nt|athene: keep communications open|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ianmcc: this could make to min the loss|pg||
nt|hawe45: 9 tricks without the @S-guess|pg||
nt|athene: you wait for partner to get in again and everything is happy|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45: South thinking - telling: I do NOT have the @D Ace...|pg||
nt|athene: what is south thinking about? his partner can't have @HQ left can he?|pg||

mb|2H!|an|good raise|nt|ritong: he might go down|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: looks a very sound 3-card raise - though it is quite quacky|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: so @d lead, Q from dummy, @h Q, uncovered and tank|pg||
nt|cuttysark: May be a temptation to play ace other heart, but West is quite likely to have 3 hearts if he has the single diamond and East surely has a club entry|pg||

nt|hawe45: 4 @H 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: missing DK will hardly bid 7|pg||
nt|hawe45: With N/S bidding the 3 other suits, West will find the @C-lead|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psyck: 1@s followed by 3@h would be normal by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: This time EW might reasonably attempt 5D|pg||
nt|athene: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: north is intending to just show a heart raise so not bothering with the spades|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen's 2D overcall a little ugly with only a five card suit, but the excellent hand and unsuitability of every other call justify it|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie, unfortunately, doesn't know what a vul v not 2-level overcall looks like|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd sooner bid 5D than pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Povl Sommer|pg||
nt|jcomyn: does s hand not qualify for 1c|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: hmmm, 2@c playing a strong @c system...|pg||
nt|athene: usually you do that with a game force which i don't think north really has|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: hi Povl,  welcome |pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: too early in the day to try swingy bids|pg||
nt|hawe45: Depuis 40 ans...|pg||
nt|hawe45: Sorry, privat|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sommer: ..4@D now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: a bold X pls don't convert|pg||
nt|sybarra: N will make a slam try with 4 @d |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @S |pg||
nt|sommer: ..and they should be there|pg||
nt|athene: so, a spade lead and a club loser goes away|pg||
nt|hawe45: 2 @S for the lead???|pg||
pc|d7|nt|woozle: Buchen steps out a little with a reopening double, diagnosing the short hearts opposite. Christie still thinks that he has a balanced yarborough and just returns to diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: N was too strong for his action after all :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: This cuts communication a little|pg||
nt|athene: ok now declarer can't get to dummy for a pitch on the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: sensible lead|pg||
nt|athene: lead the singleton with a weak hand|pg||
nt|psyck: @h will be entry later|pg||
nt|hawe45: Listen folks - does 2 @S mean: Lead what you like?|pg||
nt|athene: Garozzo said "if you don't lead your singleton, pd shld assume u don't have one"|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sommer: 4@S.. now|pg||
nt|sybarra: up the line cues I guess |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: that doesn't quite mean "always lead your singleton" as people sometimes say|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: but it is fairly close :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Still 12 tricks possible|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: @D set as trump |pg||
nt|jcomyn: that dk still missing though|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are off to the races |pg||

pc|h2|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45: Now 11½|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|hawe45: Even if East ducks the first @H, still 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: east covers in case his pd has @H109x or something|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kiwibridge: still a plus with Klinger stealing 3@H|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and as WE see, it makes 13 tricks fast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this WONT take long|pg||
nt|athene: always hard to duck with a doubleton honour|pg||
nt|hawe45: Hmm...!|pg||

nt|athene: @D8 nice entry|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK - that´s better|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|c2|nt|woozle: I shouldn't be so harsh - Christie couldn't have known that he had four trumps, a king and a key singleton|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
mc|12|nt|kiwibridge: that is being harsh|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is NS play 2@C as natural or a 3-card limit raise |pg||
nt|athene: quite common idea so you can stop at the 2-level when partner has a really bad hand|pg||
nt|psyck: that would be a likely explanation|pg||

nt|ianmcc: this 4@s could make needs W to break @d?|pg||
nt|woozle: EW can put on some pressure by bidding to 5C here, which needs hearts led at trick one or two to beat it|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S, meanwhile, appears to need a diamond shift to beat it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nor should this|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is a good sac against 4@H here|pg||
nt|hawe45: Only game here is 3 @D doubled|pg||
nt|athene: nunes obviously did not think his hand quite good enough for a 2@D opener|pg||

nt|psyck: not with all values outside i guess|pg||
nt|athene: a 9 that is basically a 12 :)|pg||
nt|psyck: we will have to wait a little longer for the imps to flow|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: With +600/620 or -100 as the options, I'd much rather be playing than defending|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice to be spectating this one|pg||
nt|woozle: Sorry, not so sure that the diamond shift is necessary to beat 4S - discard is in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but endplay?|pg||
nt|sommer: this?..this may be a swing|pg||
nt|sommer: ..if N dares to bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 18-19 i take it|pg||
nt|sybarra: X will now = @D I suspect |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|woozle: but if the defense never break diamonds, a one-suit squeeze on east will work|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D interesting - sometimes you have to open 1@D with various "loose" hands in a strong club system|pg||
nt|athene: but usually with 6 clubs you can open 2@C!|pg||
nt|athene: maybe their 2@C opener denies a 4 card major|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sommer: 2@S may be 2 controls|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt think sacrifice now|pg||
nt|sommer: nope..very passive by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i really must hunt out a CC for NS :) then i could actually stop just guessing haha|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|psyck: Usually, in a strong @c system, it is the long relays we cannot make sense of, here even their natual bids are unnatural :(|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D is always a bit of an amorphous blob in 5-card major strong 1@C systems|pg||
nt|athene: just not usually this sort of blob :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sommer: got a chance there too, to X|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|woozle: Perhaps not. My imagination is getting ahead of me. East will be endplayed if he comes down to KJT of diamonds, but if he keeps the 6 and ditches a minor honour then West's diamond ...|pg||
nt|woozle: pips will save him|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i dont like this style of bidding with this kind of shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: we can just ignore the 1st round of bids & it looks fine though...|pg||
nt|hawe45: With an easy @H-guess, East can make 4 @D - if N/S do not find the @H-ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is tak 'em or dont get 'em |pg||
nt|athene: not trivial perhaps to bid 3@D with east |pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: only in nt |pg||
nt|sommer: sry..I'm told, E showed 5c@H|pg||
nt|athene: might feel he is just hanging partner for a good balancing action|pg||
nt|psyck: E was afraid of crucifying pd for balancing|pg||
nt|athene: also he might just assume that north has implied some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: since usually you will do if you open 1@D and rebid clubs, even if you might have longer clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: I also have to sleep some time, this contract is a 2-minut-one...!|pg||

nt|athene: so it looks like some sort of suction|pg||
nt|athene: probably showing the next suit up or some other 2 suiter|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe just simple transfers but that is a little passé surely|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: having an actual anchor suit! that's bordering on natural bidding|pg||

mb|5C|nt|sommer: ..he felt maybe too strong for jump to 4@S??|pg||
nt|athene: at club level, it only takes a slight variation in tempo|pg||
nt|athene: for west to double fast with a trump trick and slightly slower with values outside spades|pg||

nt|athene: i see so many pairs doing this and they might not even realise it is dodgy :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: how about "wuction"? stands for wet suction  - you don't bid on 4-4 shapes|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen (foolishly to my mind) tries doubling 3NT, but a spade lead could be the last thing that he needs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Buchen making it worse|pg||
nt|athene: interesting 1nt here - i wonder is this a forcing notrump?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Today, it's cold on any lead and he turns -7 imps into -9, but another non-rare outcome will be to talk his partner off the killing lead|pg||
nt|woozle: Smolanko runs. That didn't occur to me, with good spades and the doubler not on lead|pg||
nt|athene: looks strange otherwise with 3-card support|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|kiwibridge: so it was a good X after all?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: and picked up 1 on 31|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mr duboin giving it plenty of thought|pg||

pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: I goe an aspect from  a kib - 5@s is a very bad contract. either 4@s or 6@s|pg||

nt|athene: of the minor and it's possible to lose the major fit|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: also making 1@S forcing makes it easier to deal with some strong hands of course|pg||

mb|d|nt|sommer: I dont - exactly..wasnt W big favorite to hold @HAx(x) and @Cx instead?|pg||

nt|woozle: Buchen's 2NT is a thoughtful effort, although if I were to reach 3NT with this hand I'd rather be dummy (a try like 2S might achieve that)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: doesnt matter much in this case, I guess..they are off 2 aces and rest in 4|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 2@s show or ask?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..making 11 even with the plague:)|pg||
nt|psyck: will end in 3N i guessa|pg||
pc|sK|nt|woozle: some kind of length try|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie might push harder for game if vulnerable|pg||
nt|psyck: not that it mattes much with the score to be compared with|pg||
nt|1den1e: diðer konuya gelince dün geldi|pg||
nt|athene: EW don't really lose much by missing game :) that's something i suppose|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|woozle: This should score 140, maybe 170 on soft defense|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: that discard helped declarer|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: of course Fantoni Nunes can go for penalties a lot with their super-sound 1-level openers |pg||
nt|athene: but still it was a view from east with all that stuff in hearts facing possibly 4 hearts in west's hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was only a couple of imps at stake wonce E chose not to pass 1st|pg||

nt|woozle: SJ from hand now for ten tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ianmcc: he needs to lead @sJ? after trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: ok, there is one interesting point worth a mention from the open room auction|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|woozle: auction points heavily to that, and Buchen won't miss a clue that big|pg||
nt|athene: opener doubles there even with only two in the other major|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|psyck: W could well have rebid 2@c instead of x|pg||
pc|s9|nt|woozle: That could be six imps either way|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nicely|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: i see a lot of less experienced players not re-opening with double in that position because they "don't have four in the other major" - with three it's just routine and even with ...|pg||
nt|athene: two sometimes|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: because you are mainly catering for the penalty pass with partner|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|ritong: yes, and bardin will be relieved this is the last board  he is in pain|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unfortunate wrong-siding - but even a spade from West and diamond switch sees it off|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Another point is that South did not raise spades or bid something else|pg||
nt|athene: the danger of partner pulling your re-opening double to a 4-card heart suit is very low in fact|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with 4 hearts he would double 1@S himself|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: if he doesn't have a trap pass that is|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ianmcc: 3NT doesn't look good|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1nt "12+-15"|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcomyn: and 6 in a row|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|woozle: I'm having difficulty believing Buchen's first round pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that's a fairly horrible 11 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Notrump wrong-sided but it would likely go down anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Spade lead, diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: take a point off for 4333, take another point off for the diamond spots, and take another point off for partner playing them better :) and what do you have left?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|woozle: Smolanko declining many opportunities to bid notrumps could cost dearly if Christie hits on the heart lead|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal.  Thanks to my co-commentators Bill & Roland.  Well done Operator. Thanks kibs for joining us & for their inputs.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: my tip is@c|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|woozle: Certainly, when your partner, marked with all of the values, didn't overcall over 1C, the only good suit he can have is clubs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|woozle: Thoughtful lead, but it leaves the result in limbo for the moment. Still probably down|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|woozle: Down two at best|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sommer: @DQ..now or never|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|mc|8|nt|woozle: Maybe more...declarer might try to endplay East for the SQ, knowing that with KQTxx heart and the spade ace he would have overcalled|pg||
nt|athene: down 3 surely|pg||
nt|athene: maybe east overtook the @D9 to be sure of beating one?|pg||
nt|athene: ok well thanks all anyway, lots of entertainment there :)|pg||
