nt|sybarra: hi Joe :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: NS - standard - EW = precision|pg||
nt|hawe45: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks operators, appreciated information|pg||
nt|hawe45: Excuse me - can one play precision and be late for the start...?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No you haven't|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now you have|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Good bidding - up to now|pg||
nt|peachy: operator seems to have some practicing session going, no cards :)  Hang on, I'm sure we will be on shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hmmm....|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The bidding has not been like this :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You need to redeal to a board first|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You can't bid with a blank screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I have the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Ian |pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45: Good luck to everybody|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mgb81: That's an odd choice of take out double from south I must say- makes it hard to express her hand type|pg||
nt|athene: yet another good hand for the "4333 plays in notrumps" rule|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if it gets them to 3NT...|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks as though it definitely ought to have chances|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS have the chance for a brilliancy by bidding 3NT...seems a bit far fetched though|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed how well 3nt scores over 4major when you have a 4333|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: a not so easy 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mgb81: North can try eliminating and messing around a bit but with everyone balanced there isn't any chance of a defensive screw up|pg||
nt|athene: you really want to be facing a 1-suiter though - not so good if the long spades are part of a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|mgb81: or is there...?|pg||
nt|copeyj: @DA lead should eliminate the problems at trick 1, 2 and 3 Michaerl|pg||
nt|copeyj: or even Michael|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence can begin with three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: and if they get endplayed after that, they deserve to get endplayed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a bit desperate if @h led|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you could endplay them after that and force them to give a ruff and discard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ht it is (was certainly likely) |pg||
nt|santyclz: I would have led a @c, probably the only lead that lets it make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think the only way it might make is if west somehow loses her clubs and then east gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks for coming to cheer for your favorites|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|mgb81: In the other room it looks like Susannah Gross pulled off a pseudo squeeze as Ruth Connelly sitting west pitched two clubs, squeezing her partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: @H - @D-ruff - and then @S from the defence|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|athene: but since west hasn't got anything to keep but her clubs....|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ianmcc: don't like that @h8 but still 5 tx for defence|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|hawe45: @D Jack was a partner-test..|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mgb81: However declarer then claimed one down, so maybe the play record is inaccurate.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|hawe45: @S now, what else could work well?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hawe45: Claim|pg||
nt|hawe45: Trump back would have defeated this contract|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|athene: the problem with stripping side-suits and hoping for some elimination is that it's always really obvious what you are doing|pg||
nt|athene: so opps know to throw their kings brilliantly from Kx and stuff like that when it's needed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: looks like making now|pg||
nt|santyclz: @s pitch may have let it through.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: Well, the hearts come in so I don't think so|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|s4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d3|pc|sT|nt|hawe45: OK - the defence should have played @S earlier instead of @H|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c6|pc|s6|pc|d4|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4S82HQJ8DJ53CAT952,ST65HT9765DAQTCQ6,SKJ7HAK4DK9874CJ3,SAQ943H32D62CK874|sv|n|nt|mgb81: ok flat board, onto the next more exciting one|pg||
nt|mgb81: we can see that the defence lost its way in the other room|pg||
nt|mgb81: 4S looks booked for at least two down but west played ace and another diamond and declarer got a club away|pg||
nt|santyclz: And a quick lead for the team I'll not try to type.|pg||
nt|peachy: Then he does not lose the DK to ruff, tricky hand to defend|pg||
nt|hawe45: One @H to the 10, @D-ruff and trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east played the @D5 on the ace|pg||
nt|mgb81: with 5H cold (North is squeezedin the minors on an unlikely trump lead) there are several ways for this to gain a swing to England|pg||
nt|mgb81: will kelly bid 4S or 1S?|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT overcall definitely a bit whimsical|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we can just call them SS |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: or pronounce|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: asking partner to have an ace out of the blue is a bit much|pg||
nt|santyclz: (It being only 7:15 here my fingers aren't awake yet.)|pg||
mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|vugraphzdh: 20-21|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of us up much earlier watching the royal wedding :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/s could maybe make 4@s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|santyclz: I figured since they didn't invite me I wasn't obligated to watch.|pg||
nt|peachy: Often the defense indeed does well to start trumps early, the reason they play in trump contract is so they can ruff something :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Exactly|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mgb81: this is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: what????????|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mgb81: literally what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|athene: west has decided that she can get lots of heart ruffs|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South really bid 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: why would you ever reopen with a double on the east cards?|pg||
nt|athene: best would be an SOS redouble from north|pg||
nt|ianmcc: howcome they left you out?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think being vul, N/S do not get in|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: south might decide to float that too|pg||
nt|mgb81: well this looks to be 7 tricks on accurate defence i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: is this definitely the auction, operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I fear it is|pg||
nt|mgb81: I just cant imagine what goes through the mind of someone that wants to double 1S for take out when they are 7-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: it definitely is :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: :):)|pg||
nt|athene: well, received wisdom is that you strain to re-open with double as often as possible, but "possible" doesn't cover 0-7-2-4|pg||
nt|mgb81: I'm not sure why youre smiling Stephen - looks painful to me|pg||
nt|santyclz: An oversight, I'm sure.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: seems like it should make 6 but I guess that needs the @H's played correctly|pg||
nt|hawe45: No double? - but undertricks "en masse" as they say in France|pg||
pc|s3|nt|copeyj: he is smiling because he is scottish|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: absolutely|pg||
nt|hawe45: E/W will come closer to 9 tricks than North...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hawe45: Come on, North - take some tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps there was some misunderstanding in NS auction|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|steshome:  Passing the double with the West hand is a bit odd though|pg||
nt|athene: that's one way of putting it, yes|pg||
nt|mgb81: yes it's the bid of someone who is going for the quick kiil|pg||
nt|mgb81: hoping partner is 2524 with a goodish hand say|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d3|nt|mgb81: Declarer is going to bash out a few trumps now and make her 7 top tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|peachy: 2NT seems like transfer to clubs, meybe they were not on same page asto what bid "likes clubs"|pg||
nt|hawe45: Do´nt forget, that the lead gave one trick away from the defence!|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mgb81: west should have count now and not uck the diamond|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c5|pc|h5|nt|mgb81: often its the vul overtrick that really costs. -790 when teammates make 620 isnt a disaster but -990 is|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|mgb81: here -160 wont be the end of the world, though with game cold EW might think it is|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|hawe45: One more gift - play the Queen, you must|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|copeyj: oh dear|pg||

nt|mgb81: are you sure it's 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|athene: if you go all the way round the bend, that's 360 degrees isn't it :)|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - East didn't overtake @cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: yes...I'm sure :)|pg||
nt|dburn: so a heart loser went away|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Still sure...|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think we should just rely on Stephen to have it right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: was also the auction...lol|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Don't tell anybody|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: when you have a 7-4 as opener on that sort of auction do you just lose the 4-card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: too late|pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: lots for N/S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so opener just bids 4@H or something over 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: yes Bill|pg||
nt|athene: these actions aren't discussed much - e.g. what is a cue-bid by opener|pg||
nt|mgb81: it looks like declarer mistimed the play in the other room here. She allowed north to pitch her diamond and ruff away the ace|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here the spot is 3 NT - to avoid cross-ruffing defence|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Is the grand biddable?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45: West took my advice|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: What do you call AQJ9xxxx?  Trumps!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: even ith one card less|pg||
nt|athene: yes 4@H doesn't look too tricky|pg||
nt|copeyj: can just get a @C trick in the bank and cross ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
nt|athene: make four tricks in the side suits and some number of trumps on a crossruff|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will be a good text of alice and bryonys temperament if they can get back on te horse and get a solid game under lock and key|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: North seems intent|pg||
nt|santyclz: If that is exclusion s should bid it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: voidwood |pg||
nt|sybarra: or exclusion |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was an ask. Could 5@c be an answer?|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerted at voidwood |pg||
nt|santyclz: N chose not to answer the "ask", that shows a suit whose loser(s) can be determined by b'wood.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Quite reasonably|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: I think S has to bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|hawe45: Without pre-empt, 4 @H is the normal contract to bid - not to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4th lead, udca|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|athene: people sometimes panic when they hit a 5-0 trump break|pg||
nt|copeyj: they shouldnt find out about ot until it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|copeyj: just cash winners and x ruff|pg||
nt|ianmcc: agree, source of tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: but they only bid 6 in the other room so a push|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, it's easy to bid from up here but they didn't find it at either table.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|copeyj: 2@D 1@S 1@C and at least 6 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: sure|pg||
nt|athene: but playing one round of trumps would have been ok if declarer had then remembered rule 1 of crossruffing (take side suit tricks early)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|copeyj: hmm|pg||
nt|copeyj: better start ruffing things |pg||
nt|athene: if you never touch trumps here you make 11 without too much difficulty, but still 10 should be ok|pg||
nt|copeyj: no more trumpies :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Just in case the @hs only provide 4 tricks.  |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mgb81: good work|pg||

nt|copeyj: and another good result for England from next door here|pg||
nt|copeyj: E/W got way overboard and Sally Brock told them it wasn't making|pg||
nt|athene: ok a classic misunderstanding here i think|pg||
nt|athene: if you double then bid a new suit that should not be natural and strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: because with a strong shapely hand you start by bidding your suits not by neg Xing|pg||
nt|mgb81: ouch|pg||
nt|athene: so nash's 4@C really caused a lot of problems|pg||
nt|athene: probably interpreted as a cue bid supporting diamonds|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to the movie Gross as south doubled 7@D|pg||
nt|copeyj: I doubt it :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mgb81: well its less likely that Sally passed it as north!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ianmcc: N/S probably 10 tx in @h but not enough in high cards to bid it|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here we might have our fun|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45: Solid 1 @S - I love it...!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mgb81: "I didn't want to push the opponents into 7NT partner"|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mgb81: Alice Kaye will do well to take the low road and bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: well everyone will remember a 7@D not too long ago where the defender with the @DA had to double to gain on the board|pg||
nt|athene: and it wasn't at a humble level either|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Or the 7@D this EW pair bid against Scotland earlier today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Made on a finesse|pg||
nt|copeyj: Well it was a quasi marked finesse Roland|pg||
nt|copeyj: the hand under AQ@S had overcalled a vulnerable @S|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Yes, they surely knew that :)|pg||
nt|dburn: very good auction, that was|pg||
nt|mgb81: one of the juniors watching has just quoted the old rhyming adage "Misfit -time to quit"|pg||
nt|copeyj: Let's not talk about slams anyway after the one in the first stanza of the day today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Simon forgets to tell that the hand with @HQxxx bid the grand slam although her partner never cuebid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: But she found a void opposite|pg||
nt|dburn: her partner had guaranteed first-round control in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: When did she do that?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She never bid hearts|pg||
nt|mgb81: is Alice really still in the tank?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D looks pushy here and east hasn't got any easy way to just invite it based on the diamond suit quality, has she?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She jumped from 3NT to 6@C|pg||
nt|dburn: when she bid six clubs as a grand slam try opposite a partner who had cue-bid 4@s when she could have cue-bid 4@h|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bill tries unsuccessfully to get us back on track|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Well, not much action right now, Sarah :)|pg||
nt|athene: there is a lot of action|pg||
nt|athene: but it's all in east's mind at the moment|pg||
nt|athene: she sees a big, fat 920 at the end of the rainbow|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hawe45: Par is 5 @S doubled 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: sorry 1370 even|pg||
nt|mgb81: as predicted she wheels out the woolley cue bid|pg||
nt|steshome:  East's first Lady Milne, I do believe, and the first of many, I'm sure|pg||
nt|copeyj: true speak Sarah|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Absolutely, she is only 24|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: likely to be duplicate auction in other room |pg||
nt|santyclz: You wouldn't really want to be there seeing both hands single dummy, even vul at imps.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45: Surprising, that South with 10  HCP and an opening bid from partner, just sells out to 4 @S undoubled|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mgb81: yes East was a reserve last year just misisng out on her first lady milne but this year she and Bryony qualified comfortably in the trials|pg||
nt|mgb81: good work|pg||
nt|athene: now east still might not want to bid 4@D because that might sound as though she looked for 3nt, didn't find a stop, and gave up|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live IN RUNNING LADY MILNE SCORES - http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: and partner might sometimes pass it or something horrible|pg||
nt|hawe45: He must have seen many bad openings from partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: One more  @H from North  = 620|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I prefer a direct 4@S bid on the East hand. Don't want the ops to find out about both strength and fit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|santyclz: Needs @ds and @hs both 3-3.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk1: Scotland currently +23 against Wales|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: EW in the other room will be hoping that their counterparts bid 6@D, of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they never are for me|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|athene: 2 down in a grand isn't always so bad|pg||
nt|copeyj: Scotland are currently 33 up|pg||
nt|athene: it's rarely a cause for celebration, of course|pg||
nt|copeyj: not 23|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Someone surely knows how many IMPs Scotland need if England get 23, 24, 25 VPs|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live IN RUNNING LADY MILNE SCORES - http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|dburn: 23 IMPs is 19-11 - Scotland need to win 18-12 to be sure of the Lady Milne|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|hawe45: Agree|pg||
pc|h8|nt|peachy: Anything might have worked at this table where N and S were rather timid|pg||
