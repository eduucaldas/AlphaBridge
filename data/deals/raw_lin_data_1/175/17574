nt|vugrapha2: haha|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one is 20-20 game a stretch|pg||

nt|jcomyn: a keep out of trouble hand to start with|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi John :) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may need these,  since this is "not standard" |pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a horrible bunch of misfits - not us - the hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be us also LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if all stay low |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would open N hand  |pg||
nt|sybarra: ak, a|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strong club for N-S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Daniela|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Bob, Bill and Andy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I enjoyed watching Braithwaite & Richman|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Precision a la Angelini|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45: N/S can make a very lucky 3 NT here, but hardly bid it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|woozle: 4H is fair (but down)...vulnerable I'd definitely want to be there|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: can NS really make 3nt? how do they get to dummy to finesse diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen might very reasonably drive to game here, particularly considering the hands that this pair haven't overcalled|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now what?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be played doubled? |pg||
nt|psyck: 1N=@c or puppet to @c i guess|pg||
nt|athene: maybe in spades, given time :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: @S Jack is the entry|pg||
nt|hawe45: - but I said: VERY lucky|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt might be some either/or bid - those are sort of the norm after strong club|pg||
nt|athene: so clubs or something else, maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: strong enough for one try ?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcomyn: source of tricks very scarc e here|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 @D should end the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, could be a suction variant with @c or red suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and getting scarcer|pg||
nt|sybarra: was typing,  "not sure this is success either"|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 @D is jumping into fire |pg||
nt|sybarra: (out of frying pan)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: best to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ not an entry for trump finesse playing in diamonds :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  may not have to try anymore|pg||
nt|bobholl: double all pass :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45: Will be defeated - with the @S-ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45: - not any longer|pg||
nt|athene: now he can just play ace and a diamond, lose @SAK, @DK, @CA|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and its "good luck pard" with a smile |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no double no trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4S bid is very loose, and possibly down more than one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: rescue|pg||
nt|woozle: Likely phantom|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|athene: only way the contract might go down is spade shift and then try to ruff a club|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: right John!  this can not be worse  (only 50's) |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: then @DK overruff, @S ruff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|woozle: diamond, diamond ruff, club, diamond ruff, club or heart to come (if the defense don't cash the HA the heart runs away...if they do, two clubs run away)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  2@s very limited in range...3-7 hcp which may be reason for lack of try by S...W's balance will not meet with teammate approval|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|athene: but fall of @CQ ought to change declarer's mind|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: ace and a diamond completely safe now|pg||
nt|hawe45: North will hardly ruff @C - seeing the @C Queen coming down |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|woozle: Good hand to show off the law - EW make 9 tricks in their nine card fit, NS make8 tricks in their eight card fit. If 4H was making, 4S would be -500|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @hA what else?|pg||
nt|athene: no way anyone can win the @DK and give his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: well|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: if he had cashed the @CK and seen the queen fall, yes|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c4|nt|sybarra: I think we call these kind of hand "buzz sawa" |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: but the way it went it was not so obvious that the @CQ was stiff|pg||
nt|athene: but still|pg||
nt|athene: ace and a diamond was 100% to make 3@D at that point|pg||
nt|hawe45: This will not be the best played hand of the tournament|pg||
nt|athene: definitely very bad play|pg||
nt|athene: i guess "first board syndrome"|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north thought that west had the clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: All beginning is difficult|pg||
nt|athene: since west bid them|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: maybe he did not check what 1nt meant|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: *buzz saws"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: get out fast before you lose your head|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: could have been a lot worse|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: and he did not bother to even ruff high first time|pg||
nt|athene: so he must have been really sure west had club length|pg||
nt|athene: that suggests he just did not pay attention to the bidding|pg||
nt|hawe45: Would not have helped|pg||
nt|hawe45: ruffing high|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: no, of course not, but the fact that he didn't does show he didn't even consider that east might be the one with the long clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: Fred madea point in rec.games.bridge recently avout arriving early to a tournament to free your mind of clutter before the 1st board... :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|nt|woozle: 8 imps to EW, richly deserved by NS|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|c7|pc|hQ|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|an|strong club|mb|p|nt|fann4: Having said that. though West made a pushy bid, he was unlucky that South passed 2@S with 18pts and then ran into a @H stack over him.|pg||

nt|woozle: On a good, day, 4H NS might make ten tricks. This is not a good day.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec points out that East's low @d was spot on|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: first board and last board are the killers for keeping concentration|pg||
nt|athene: the ones in between, they are hard too|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  -800 usually not what you expect when opps are not in game|pg||
nt|athene: i think that possibly east should bid 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: the point being it's very likely his partner might balance disastrously|pg||
nt|athene: east is a passed hand - how bad can 3@C be?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is just with benefit of hindsight|pg||
nt|andyv:  but in imps, is there a reason for W to balance?|pg||
nt|andyv:  poor quality suit, and, except for 6th @h, the hand is balanced|pg||
nt|athene: well the hand does go to prove one point which is that just because opps have stopped low, doesn't mean it's safe to come in|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, the severity was pretty extreme|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: fantoni nunes defended better as usual in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so -2!|pg||
nt|athene: but still should have been a much bigger swing|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D was cold|pg||
nt|athene: it's almost always safer to act aggressively earlier rather than pass and back in|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: dealer having fun today?|pg||
nt|athene: at the point he won the second club|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 NT better be played by East - only @D-lead brings trouble|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 1 @S denies 4 sp |pg||
nt|athene: but that was a particularly tough one |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@C is natural (ish) and 14+|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: West not worth 2 bids|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so 1NT shows 4 s then?|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me look for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: hitting the deck again? |pg||
nt|athene: 2@S just a natural game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: he knows E opened 1 @C a "good hand" |pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead and heart back, ducked|pg||
nt|athene: if NS find that you call the director|pg||
nt|hawe45: and the police|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: they play transfer responses so 1@S response would be limited with no major|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt stronger than 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|athene: basically if anyone has not seen NS before, they play an unusual system|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ianmcc: the vul got him|pg||
nt|athene: fairly strong, forcing 1 level bids|pg||
nt|athene: 14+ or thereabouts|pg||
nt|athene: weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: 2-level bids are 10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that @d suit is never mentioned.|pg||
nt|athene: so after the 1-level openers, responder can force to game on ten counts|pg||
nt|athene: and they can set up a game force quickly and often|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessed east would lead red but this is better|pg||
nt|athene: normally you would prefer to have the lead running up to a strong notrump rather than through it|pg||
nt|athene: but here the red tenaces are protected at least|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcomyn: good spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades might have been @D,  I am still chedking |pg||
pc|sK|nt|woozle: I'm all for supporting with support, but West's 4D looks excessive with the secondary misfit|pg||
nt|athene: worth pointing out that if north at any points found the @H7 lead(and south had not led the suit) and declarer plays the king, south has to duck|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see 52 cards the 8 is so obvious :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: very common to duck the first round if you have AJx(xx) over KQx|pg||
nt|athene: keep communications open|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ianmcc: this could make to min the loss|pg||
nt|hawe45: 9 tricks without the @S-guess|pg||
nt|athene: you wait for partner to get in again and everything is happy|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hawe45: South thinking - telling: I do NOT have the @D Ace...|pg||
nt|athene: what is south thinking about? his partner can't have @HQ left can he?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h7|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: lot to do  but looks doable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good word that - brave bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: grand is there,  (per many specs)  but not sure I want to be there |pg||
nt|jcomyn: me nayther|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this could take a while|pg||
nt|psyck: may fin @s into safe hand & be forced to set up @d later|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: 6 @d 4 @c 2 @s 1 @h|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|fann4: Wonder what 3@H shows here?|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@h some kind of reverse Jordan maybe, showing a good raise|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Obvious 2 losers in 4@H. NO swing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: Reverse Jordan has the advantage of right siding NT occasionally|pg||
nt|fann4: Don't think South cared particularly, with the 6-4 hand.|pg||
nt|fann4: Reverse Jordan more popular over a minor suit opening though, to get NT played from the other side.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck: true, not often do you play NT with 9 card maj fit|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Jordan is also known as Truscott. Not sure who came first|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Running scores at   http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html |pg||
nt|hawe45: No comments|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @H 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|jcomyn: missing DK will hardly bid 7|pg||
nt|hawe45: With N/S bidding the 3 other suits, West will find the @C-lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: their "strong" weak twos often score well (especially against the dutch:)) |pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 1, in OR, 4@h was played by N|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so this north hand is a game force for Fantoni i am sure|pg||
mb|2N|nt|psyck: 1@s followed by 3@h would be normal by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: This time EW might reasonably attempt 5D|pg||
nt|athene: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: north is intending to just show a heart raise so not bothering with the spades|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen's 2D overcall a little ugly with only a five card suit, but the excellent hand and unsuitability of every other call justify it|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie, unfortunately, doesn't know what a vul v not 2-level overcall looks like|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd sooner bid 5D than pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Povl Sommer|pg||
nt|jcomyn: does s hand not qualify for 1c|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: hmmm, 2@c playing a strong @c system...|pg||
nt|athene: usually you do that with a game force which i don't think north really has|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: hi Povl,  welcome |pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: too early in the day to try swingy bids|pg||
nt|hawe45: Depuis 40 ans...|pg||
nt|hawe45: Sorry, privat|pg||
nt|bobholl: some kind of truscott i guess|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sommer: ..4@D now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: a bold X pls don't convert|pg||
nt|sybarra: N will make a slam try with 4 @d |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @S |pg||
nt|sommer: ..and they should be there|pg||
nt|athene: so, a spade lead and a club loser goes away|pg||
nt|hawe45: 2 @S for the lead???|pg||
pc|s6|nt|woozle: Buchen steps out a little with a reopening double, diagnosing the short hearts opposite. Christie still thinks that he has a balanced yarborough and just returns to diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: N was too strong for his action after all :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: This cuts communication a little|pg||
nt|athene: ok now declarer can't get to dummy for a pitch on the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: sensible lead|pg||
nt|athene: lead the singleton with a weak hand|pg||
nt|psyck: @h will be entry later|pg||
nt|hawe45: Listen folks - does 2 @S mean: Lead what you like?|pg||
nt|athene: Garozzo said "if you don't lead your singleton, pd shld assume u don't have one"|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 aces away and claim |pg||
pc|sT|nt|sommer: 4@S.. now|pg||
nt|sybarra: up the line cues I guess |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: that doesn't quite mean "always lead your singleton" as people sometimes say|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: but it is fairly close :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Still 12 tricks possible|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: @D set as trump |pg||
nt|jcomyn: that dk still missing though|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are off to the races |pg||

pc|s2|pc|d4|nt|hawe45: Even if East ducks the first @H, still 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: east covers in case his pd has @H109x or something|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: still a plus with Klinger stealing 3@H|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and as WE see, it makes 13 tricks fast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this WONT take long|pg||
nt|athene: always hard to duck with a doubleton honour|pg||
nt|hawe45: Hmm...!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: nunes fantoni didn't take their tricks against 4@H either|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: another one where we can't see what happened in the CR|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this 4@s could make needs W to break @d?|pg||
nt|woozle: EW can put on some pressure by bidding to 5C here, which needs hearts led at trick one or two to beat it|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S, meanwhile, appears to need a diamond shift to beat it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nor should this|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is a good sac against 4@H here|pg||
nt|hawe45: Only game here is 3 @D doubled|pg||
nt|athene: nunes obviously did not think his hand quite good enough for a 2@D opener|pg||
nt|athene: (10-13, unbalanced, 5+@D)|pg||
nt|athene: they tend to be ultra disciplined with those|pg||
nt|athene: so it has to be a ridiculously good 9|pg||
nt|psyck: not with all values outside i guess|pg||
nt|athene: a 9 that is basically a 12 :)|pg||
nt|psyck: we will have to wait a little longer for the imps to flow|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: With +600/620 or -100 as the options, I'd much rather be playing than defending|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice to be spectating this one|pg||
nt|woozle: Sorry, not so sure that the diamond shift is necessary to beat 4S - discard is in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but endplay?|pg||
nt|sommer: this?..this may be a swing|pg||
nt|sommer: ..if N dares to bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 18-19 i take it|pg||
nt|sybarra: X will now = @D I suspect |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|woozle: but if the defense never break diamonds, a one-suit squeeze on east will work|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: 1@D interesting - sometimes you have to open 1@D with various "loose" hands in a strong club system|pg||
nt|athene: but usually with 6 clubs you can open 2@C!|pg||
nt|athene: maybe their 2@C opener denies a 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 2@S may be 2 controls|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt think sacrifice now|pg||
nt|sommer: nope..very passive by N|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: i really must hunt out a CC for NS :) then i could actually stop just guessing haha|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|psyck: Usually, in a strong @c system, it is the long relays we cannot make sense of, here even their natual bids are unnatural :(|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D is always a bit of an amorphous blob in 5-card major strong 1@C systems|pg||
nt|athene: just not usually this sort of blob :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't know their system (yet) but looks like strong club with conventional answers |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sommer: got a chance there too, to X|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Perhaps not. My imagination is getting ahead of me. East will be endplayed if he comes down to KJT of diamonds, but if he keeps the 6 and ditches a minor honour then West's diamond ...|pg||
nt|woozle: pips will save him|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i dont like this style of bidding with this kind of shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: we can just ignore the 1st round of bids & it looks fine though...|pg||
nt|hawe45: With an easy @H-guess, East can make 4 @D - if N/S do not find the @H-ruff|pg||
nt|athene: i assumed it was just 1@C natural, 1@H transfer, 1nt natural, new minor forcing|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: this is tak 'em or dont get 'em |pg||
nt|athene: not trivial perhaps to bid 3@D with east |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT much better than 4@S @C lead and swiftly 1 down |pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: only in nt |pg||
nt|sommer: sry..I'm told, E showed 5c@H|pg||
nt|athene: might feel he is just hanging partner for a good balancing action|pg||
nt|psyck: E was afraid of crucifying pd for balancing|pg||
nt|athene: also he might just assume that north has implied some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: since usually you will do if you open 1@D and rebid clubs, even if you might have longer clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: I also have to sleep some time, this contract is a 2-minut-one...!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://bridgetopics.com/news/2011/apr/fantunes-and-garozzo-play-angelini-salsomaggiore is about this match|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d looks like xfer to @hs, otherwise 3N doesn't make sense with E hand|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: i'm told that 1@D generally promises a 4-card major in the NS methods, so 2@C showed 4 spades|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: i was wondering why he ignored the spades, but if he has implied them, that is ok :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sommer: ..the 3@C did|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|woozle: It would all work if the D8 was in North|pg||
nt|sommer: 2@S was "wheater/or"..and then 3@C showed 5c @H|pg||

nt|fann4: Possible swing time here. In the CR NS (Fantunes) are in 5@H, going to make on @CQ lead and a @D switch ).|pg||

nt|granguru:  can play 10 different full systems today 29 April 2011...|pg||
nt|psyck: Ghestem style bid with known 2 suiters|pg||
nt|fann4: Amazing, NS never mentioned @H!|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: Running scores at   http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html |pg||
nt|sommer: EW missed even 6@D at the other table in b 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 2..sry|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|psyck: x wide ranging opp a nebulous opening|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the double of 1@D just says "i am doubling whatever minor he has for takeout " :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will they miss @H now ?|pg||
nt|athene: many people bid 1@S with that west sort of hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: these nebulous minor openers cause a whole lot of interesting problems for both sides|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: you see it a lot more with short 1@C openers|pg||
nt|hawe45: In fact, best game is 3 NT - with @S 5-1, 4 @H might be a looser|pg||
nt|athene: but they they are stuck when the bidding comes back to them in 4@H or something|pg||
nt|athene: they have to bid 5@C and now partner can't go back to 4@S if he wants to|pg||
nt|athene: much more descriptive to bid clubs first then spades|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jcomyn: could be lively auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: and some were worried about missing 7,  John and I were both chickens  and happy to be in 6 |pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcomyn: right pair of chickens we are shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: that ok |pg||
nt|bobholl: now N has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that nunes splinters for hearts with no more than a minimum opener (in their style)|pg||
nt|athene: the italians generally lay great stress on showing the shape in competition like this |pg||
nt|bobholl: will bid 5@D now i guess|pg||
nt|athene: two small in clubs looks very bad from north's point of view - but not if you know partner has a singleton :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but may be not strong enough sure :)|pg||
nt|athene: will west lightner double hearts?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would force NS to find the better spot in @hs|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: over 900 watching this match now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 8 to go after this one|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: at the end of the last hand Buchen just showed his kj10x @d to Smolanko, and they both agreed 1 off|pg||
nt|hawe45: I think is says "nolo comprendo" - or so - in Italian. What could 3 @C mean???|pg||
nt|athene: @C2 lead now maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nunes should convert this|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry|pg||
nt|bobholl: has to underlead in @C to deafeat 5@H|pg||
mb|5H|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4H almost looks like an underbid, but if you're going to stop low, that North hand won't disappoint|pg||
nt|sybarra: wtih no apologies to mates :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: no chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: not much point west underleading since he is on lead against diamonds not hearts :)|pg||
nt|athene: east might deduce the diamond void from the auction|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psyck: i donno what 4@c is either|pg||
nt|athene: but a diamond lead could be wrong in many ways - if partner doesn't ruff you just gave a vital tempo away|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 5@H is made|pg||
nt|andyv:  he'll deduce it now but it's too late|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  you are right...no reason not to try|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: of course, "Normally", you only lightner double at the slam level|pg||
nt|bobholl: not the ace :)|pg||
nt|athene: but there are other times when perhaps it might apply|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that it does interfere with when you just want to double for penalty because opps are saccing|pg||
nt|andyv:  in imps, I think E had enough to go on to try a @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: so you can only really use it when you are known from the previous auction not to be strong enough to need to double just to protect your equity on the deal|pg||
nt|andyv:  and question for W was whether to bid on, to dbl for lead direction, or to pass....this time pass looks costly|pg||
nt|bobholl: he didn't know for sure his P had @C Q|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bobholl: and may be someone has no @C|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sommer: closer to 8 than to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
mc|11|nt|woozle: ducking the opening heart lead is leaving Smolanko poorly placed - it's hard to see him going down if he rises with the ace and knocks out the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just pitch|pg||

nt|athene: "i'm not opening 1@D with 1 diamond and six clubs!"|pg||
nt|athene: quite right too|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: S had a chance to find 5@C by bidding 2@C....|pg||

nt|athene: 3@H "hearts"|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H "game"|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|woozle: Someone asked about a low spade instead of the queen. That's complex, and I think that Smolanko would have had to find the weird play of the jack from dummy to make|pg||

nt|athene: so it looks like some sort of suction|pg||

pc|cK|nt|hawe45: Look at this board, no mistake possible in the play|pg||
nt|athene: only three trumps and two clubs to lose here|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|fann4: 4@H in the CR - looks like 1 down, with @CA and @SQ offside. But on the singleton @S7 lead it is makeable, perhaps double dummy.|pg||
nt|psyck: Multi 2@d|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fann4: Needs a @C lead to sink 4@H.|pg||

nt|woozle: 4H looks excellent NS - the clubs establish with one ruff|pg||
nt|woozle: Hard to reach though - someone has to bid an awful lot|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I have a spec says it's off|pg||
nt|sommer: Bocchi/Madala bid the 6@D too..of course|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs (lauria versace i think) play for example that 1nt - 2@H double is takeout of spades|pg||
nt|hawe45: One looser in each suit, seems correct|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H being a transfer i mean|pg||
nt|athene: EW might well try 5minor|pg||
nt|athene: east surely isn't passing anything but a pure penalty double?|pg||
nt|athene: @SA lead against 5@C would be unfortunate perhaps|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C wasn't exactly best in trick 2|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can perhaps still survive by ruffing hearts and unblocking the diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and then lead the @DQ forcing west to ruff with a trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: tap tap|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but they didnt find the sacrifice, despite Bocchi bid both @D and @S!!|pg||
nt|athene: giving declarer a pitch for a diamond - then if he can ruff two hearts he can make|pg||
nt|hawe45: They will not bid 5@C before midnight...|pg||
nt|athene: and throwing a club loser from dummy when he does|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|woozle: So do I. I don't think that anybody figured out the diamond tap thing without Deep Finesse though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Double?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..in b 4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another slam but can it be bid|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: you surely have to do something over 3@S with that east hand?|pg||
nt|psyck: this better|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sommer: this X is outside my knowledge:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: easy 4@S bid now for south - in fact larry thinks he should bid 5@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: ("bid to the level of your fit")|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: i predict 5@C from east now|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of situation where it's much better to have screens|pg||
nt|bobholl: not strong enough for a "normal" weak 2|pg||
nt|athene: many would overcall 1@S with that east hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: repsonsive type |pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..he felt maybe too strong for jump to 4@S??|pg||
nt|athene: at club level, it only takes a slight variation in tempo|pg||
nt|athene: for west to double fast with a trump trick and slightly slower with values outside spades|pg||
nt|athene: and E knows when to leave and when to pull :)|pg||
nt|athene: i see so many pairs doing this and they might not even realise it is dodgy :)|pg||
nt|athene: decent suit texture|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|woozle: Smolanko's raise to 2H inadequate - that's what he would bid with a balanced minimum, and this hand is anything but|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|psyck: could be the 1st big swing now|pg||
nt|athene: never lead unsupported aces just because partner bid the suit! :) ok this was a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo tends to overcall aggressively at the 1-level so he might well|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C preclude to invite in @H i guess|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|woozle: 3H initially should incite Anderson to bid game, diagnosing the short diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|woozle: Still, making 3 or 4 will be worth 1-2 imps, potentially vlauable|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: taking a long time to find that big s fit|pg||
nt|athene: now the problem is if declarer uses the @DA to lead a heart up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, it was certainly an uncomfortable lead situation for S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..and this slam isn't good...but it makes|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|athene: NS would open 1@C with any balanced hand i think|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|woozle: Klinger's "raise" to 2H in the other room just as bad, but then he compounded it by defending 3D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|athene: so they can use the 1nt rebid artificially|pg||
nt|bobholl: a@S 2@C and a@D to loose|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: no good|pg||
nt|athene: he is banking on the diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45: Not the winning line here|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he could never make it with heart ruffs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|psyck: we will not see a new leader yet|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|athene: he doesn't expect the @HA to be onside|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d5|nt|sommer: it is close to 50% after S opened and nothing tells that @H are 5-1, so ok...close to 50%|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|hawe45: Expensive now|pg||
nt|athene: if north had doubled (an ace facing an opening bid) that might have tipped declarer off to the winning line|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s8|nt|woozle: Klinger seems to be toying with a 54321 point count...armed with that method, the North hand is just average in high cards (15)|pg||
nt|andyv:  can S strip the read suits and duck a @s to E hand?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45: How can you possibly play trumps - with 3-4 @H-loosers|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out that if declarer is going to rely on 2-2 diamonds he could just as well do that before drawing trumps|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|woozle: When I adopt a point-count like that, check my pulse|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  will be interesting if they get there|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: east knows he wants to sac in 4@S over 4@H and perhaps is trying a sort of semi-psychic bid suggesting a strong raise|pg||
nt|athene: in the hope of not getting doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: I've looked in vain in the bidding boxes|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: 3NT will certainly be reached...Brown will be happy for a certainly flat board...Klinger won't be|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: on a @S lead it makes but on @D ??|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks a little pushy, especially NV|pg||
nt|athene: but he has all four tens|pg||
nt|athene: and all four are potentially working very hard|pg||
nt|athene: for example give partner @HJxx on a  heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: and the @H10 saves your skin|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: Uggeri will finally get on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead might be worst for N|pg||

nt|andyv:  after cashing @hs, @d switch should set this|pg||
nt|athene: no play for this as long as someone keeps spades and someone keeps diamonds|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: cash the @CK and run the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: cash  both clubs and run the hearts you might as well|pg||

nt|fann4: sorry, misread the hand. 6@C on always.|pg||
nt|jbennet: given a free run EW can easyly find 6 clubs.|pg||
nt|psyck: passed pd & fav vul enabled S to get into the auction|pg||
nt|psyck: some may have tried 3@d instead|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fann4: Over 3@C by West, Opener decided to gamble the @H and bid 3N|pg||
nt|granguru:  couldnt see how could it be beated...only singleton is in trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: or as we play 2NT (showing 4h+longer D).|pg||
nt|fann4: I said so, John:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  yup :) made me work hard ...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbennet: but perhaops W is planning to bid 4 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  surely...|pg||
nt|jbennet: setting clubs as suit, and start control showing??|pg||
nt|psyck: cannot hide 7 carder|pg||
nt|granguru:  needs only @C support for 6|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes if he did bid 3 D he his compelled to show his suit now.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|jbennet: now 4 Hearts good bid.|pg||
nt|granguru:  a kib mentions that if 1NT raptor overcall would have been made by S the @H defense could have been made at the 4 level and even the 6 level|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|psyck: Raptor shows 4 card other major & 5+ card minor on maj openings|pg||
nt|fann4: Anyone know what 3@C would have meant 1st time around, over 2@D?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|granguru:  4@H is strategically wrong at this moment|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jbennet: why is 4 hearts wrong?|pg||
nt|psyck: guess he just wanted to go slow|pg||
nt|psyck: this enables him to show @s's too|pg||
nt|granguru:  describes the hand ..does not give any lead ...does not perturbate opponents bidding...too late, too risky.|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 heart from east would tell west "i have a) cooperastive values b) heart control and c) i fear the diamonds.|pg||
nt|granguru:  probably the lead will be made by N|pg||
nt|psyck: Maybe W should have just blasted after 4@s, tuf now|pg||
nt|jbennet: it is possible that EW have agreements that we dont know about.|pg||
nt|fann4: What does East know here? His partner has a likely 7+@C, and controls in the red suits.|pg||
nt|psyck: true, they probably play Turbo instead of rkc for example|pg||
nt|jbennet: for example the first 3 D bid perhaps showed that he can stop diamonds.|pg||
nt|granguru:  N has no really @D fit, another negative consideration to bid 5 cards at the 4-level at the third round of the bidding|pg||
nt|fann4: Easy for us to see it's right to go on, but these auctions are very difficult.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcp: Garozzo is trance-thinking|pg||
nt|jbennet: garozzo will ponder for another 13,5 seconds and then pass|pg||
nt|fann4: The top @S, singleton @H and @CQ10x are huge cards though.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: I think W is showing a control, bidding 3@D and then pulling 3N to 4@C, but it may not be that way for them.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: no i was wrong.|pg||

nt|bobholl: aq or 9 of @D ?|pg||

nt|fann4: Another big swing potential hand.|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like 3 losers in 5@c|pg||
nt|fann4: In the CR EW had a disaster. Against 5@C after the @DK lead, W had to switch to a @S to beat it, but instead played a @H.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|granguru:  5@C can be made only if NS establishes a@D for a @H discard...(or a @H lead)|pg||

mb|2H!|an|!S|mb|p|nt|granguru:  4@S seems hard to win|pg||
nt|jbennet: from wests point of view it might be necarry to cash heart trick before D is established.|pg||
nt|fann4: 2@H clearly showing a @S suit here.|pg||
nt|jbennet: so to avoid this East play on the first D should not be attitude showing for Diamonds.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fann4: What a difference in evaluation. in the CR, N jumped to 4@C |pg||

nt|chilloncan: or is it "majors-or-minors" or something of that ilk?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: lead change|pg||
nt|woozle: Smolanko's 4C doesn't really do justice to his playing strength...Anderson didn't know how good his hand was (there didn't have to be a stiff spade opposite)|pg||
nt|psyck: likely a suction variant, but other possibilities too maybe|pg||
nt|chilloncan: NS well on their way|pg||
nt|athene: might be "spades or..."|pg||
nt|athene: it has certainly caused some confusion, which is the general idea :)|pg||
nt|psyck: suction would be @s or the next two suits (minors) here|pg||

nt|andyv:  looks like down 1 territory|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ianmcc: The auction went very nicely in OR|pg||
nt|woozle: EW had the early running in the auction in the other room - East showed both majors, West jumped to 3S...North judged aggressively (and successfully) to double...but 4S from West ...|pg||
nt|woozle: might have stolen the pot|pg||
nt|athene: north must think that 2@S set up a game force?|pg||
nt|athene: he would surely not bid 3@D there with so good a hand if he thought it was not forcing|pg||
nt|psyck: S has a maximum|pg||
nt|psyck: asuming pass of 1@h was les than 8 hcp|pg||

pc|h7|nt|athene: something must have gone wrong if 1400 vs nothing :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the auction developed extremely well for S here. was able to pass first, and then in that context could bid strongly|pg||
nt|athene: i mean surely you could have escaped for only 11 :)|pg||
nt|athene: east was perhaps wondering if his diamond spot there was suit preference|pg||

nt|woozle: It's easy to be critical, but it would be shortsighted to deny Five Card Standard some of the blame - North had to tread very carefully lest he be facing a balanced minimum with ...|pg||
nt|woozle: three clubs (and potentially, spade wastage)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe there are layouts where it is necessary|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|woozle: Who's bidding 4S?|pg||
nt|athene: another strong club for north|pg||
nt|athene: but this time east can't weave his evil spells|pg||
nt|athene: not having a 5-card suit :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: garazzo still thinking in other room at 5 level in @C|pg||
nt|athene: but in general it's wrong to attack any suit where dummy has a decent holding|pg||
nt|bobholl: (previous board)|pg||
nt|athene: because declarer can't get rid of his losers there anyway|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: admittedly, the lack of a 5-card suit doesn't stop many people from weaving over strong clubs|pg||

mb|2S|nt|ianmcc: you just suggested it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: stiff sk again. slams are growing out of ther woodwork|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: sorry, last hand....who's doubling and who's passing the double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting gain of 3 imps for Fornaciari on board 8..3N by NS, 1@h there by EW|pg||
nt|athene: NS cheerfully play weak (and offshape) notrump throughout|pg||
nt|athene: and they seem to escape disaster most of the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: another slam 6@s on a finess (but a stiff @sK in front)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: how about "wuction"? stands for wet suction  - you don't bid on 4-4 shapes|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wouldn't describe Claudio as cheerful:)|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|woozle: Buchen (foolishly to my mind) tries doubling 3NT, but a spade lead could be the last thing that he needs|pg||

nt|athene: interesting 1nt here - i wonder is this a forcing notrump?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|woozle: Today, it's cold on any lead and he turns -7 imps into -9, but another non-rare outcome will be to talk his partner off the killing lead|pg||
nt|woozle: Smolanko runs. That didn't occur to me, with good spades and the doubler not on lead|pg||
nt|athene: looks strange otherwise with 3-card support|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: north obviously didn't think it was a forcing notrump|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sommer: cant be bid|pg||

nt|sommer: so he must jump now to 6@S... I doubt that|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: so it was a good X after all?|pg||

nt|psyck: true Jeff, S knows cards working|pg||

nt|athene: this is soemthing that people often get wrong|pg||
nt|athene: they feel it's like a takeout double so they tend to bid their suits|pg||

mb|2S|nt|sommer: I dont - exactly..wasnt W big favorite to hold @HAx(x) and @Cx instead?|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|athene: many specs point out north hasn't got 8-12|pg||
nt|athene: well, he has 11, but only if you count in base 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did Angelini really bid 2@D? Must be true, hard to believe|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he meant to bid 1@D and pulled the wrong card|pg||
nt|athene: the wrong bidding card|pg||

pc|h8|nt|athene: the cards do lie well for declarer - IF he reads them|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He did, surely|pg||
nt|athene: you rarely find you really needed 1nt natural to avoid missing a game|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|athene: depends if he wants entries to hand|pg||
nt|athene: or if he wants to be able to cash the clubs smoothly any time|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||

nt|granguru:  the eternal question from xxx what to lead...but 98x deserves the 9 instead of 2nd best?|pg||
nt|jbennet: but as north had played messing around in all the suits, it was crystall clear that he had stiff A10 in spades.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|psyck: 8 clear if playing 2/4 in NT|pg||

nt|psyck: not an easy game to reach, or make (need @c guess rite)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It' easy when @CJ is covered|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: well i know there are many strong players who like it to be natural|pg||
nt|athene: i see helgemo bidding it all the time|pg||
mb|r|nt|jcomyn: some number of S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Interesting board 9 - 7@s down 2!|pg||
nt|athene: but i just think the risk/reward ratio is not good|pg||
nt|athene: or at least you have to make it more like 17-19|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural or not, the bid still needed a source of tricks|pg||
nt|athene: good playing strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: that helps i guess :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sommer: ..yes..they went for the 33% grandslam|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  change the @c and @s suit around, and 1N looks much better|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: now north will double for takeout |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you double 1nt for penalty and opps run, your next double is takeout|pg||
nt|athene: i remember david burn saying very firmly why this was a bad idea|pg||
nt|athene: but everyone plays this way and it seems sensible to me|pg||
mb|2H|nt|woozle: I predict 11 tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|sommer: ..a little less than 30% rather, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: I think Christie had to enquire to choose between 3NT and 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in the other room surely east had showed long clubs at some point so covering the club looks less appealing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: getting pushy|pg||
nt|sommer: after S' opening, W can upgrade his controlcards a lot|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and will raise...or should|pg||
nt|athene: sadly i wasn't really listening to david so i can't say what his reasoning was :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|woozle: With no singleton, 11 tricks in diamonds looks very distant|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|sommer: ..hmm|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|woozle: With North guarding hearts and diamonds, and South spades, there's no squeeze for 12|pg||
nt|athene: if you know hearts are 4-4, why shouldn't you play for the @DQ onside just as much as the @CQ?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|sommer: still 10, tho|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cA and another @c...|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|andyv:  trying for trump promotion still was best defense|pg||
nt|athene: on board board 5 and 10, garozzo made 4@S and fantnues made game the other way|pg||

nt|athene: so 1@C for south now i think|pg||

nt|bobholl: 1@C 1@S 1NT all pass|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, unfortunate to be so badly punished|pg||
nt|athene: having length and no strength in diamonds is a bad weakness in the hand, to be sure|pg||
nt|athene: but still who would not bid 1@S?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: or is it pests|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: very beatable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: although the auction will tip declarer off that he should start spades from dummy|pg||
nt|ianmcc: too much in oppo suits|pg||
nt|woozle: The values are poorly located (NS have too many)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: doing well for 140|pg||
nt|woozle: Buchen's 2NT is a thoughtful effort, although if I were to reach 3NT with this hand I'd rather be dummy (a try like 2S might achieve that)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Another point is that South did not raise spades or bid something else|pg||
nt|athene: the danger of partner pulling your re-opening double to a 4-card heart suit is very low in fact|pg||
nt|bobholl: but he won't|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with 4 hearts he would double 1@S himself|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ianmcc: 3NT doesn't look good|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1nt "12+-15"|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a reasonable 1nt bid for west there over 1@S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit ligth :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W agrees with you Bob:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it's V with AJ sec|pg||
nt|athene: west just has 1400 in the wrong column on his scorecard :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will make a game try|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT might be their strong 4-card raise|pg||
nt|athene: that's quite common|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jcomyn: and 6 in a row|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D would be mixed|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  and before that a 1370 too|pg||
mb|2H|nt|woozle: I'm having difficulty believing Buchen's first round pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that's a fairly horrible 11 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Notrump wrong-sided but it would likely go down anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  which turns out to be 13 imps for Angelini as OR only got to 5@c|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Spade lead, diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: take a point off for 4333, take another point off for the diamond spots, and take another point off for partner playing them better :) and what do you have left?|pg||
nt|andyv:  @hs can be guessed for one loser but bad @s break will sink 4@s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|woozle: Smolanko declining many opportunities to bid notrumps could cost dearly if Christie hits on the heart lead|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal.  Thanks to my co-commentators Bill & Roland.  Well done Operator. Thanks kibs for joining us & for their inputs.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: my tip is@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Certainly, when your partner, marked with all of the values, didn't overcall over 1C, the only good suit he can have is clubs|pg||
