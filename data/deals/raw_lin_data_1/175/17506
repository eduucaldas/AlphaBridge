mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jron: efter en stærk sans skal man prioritere kampen om delkontrakten frem for at melde udgang. 3@H er i min bog derfor en overmeldng|pg||

nt|jron: Øst troede åbenbart at det var krav...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|monsted: ja :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: en hånd som viser enten neste farge eller de to høyere er ikke uvanlig mot sterk kløver - jeg tror ikke jeg har sett den som her - med så gode kort|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||

nt|hesse: ØV har vi Norge U20 som vant sin åpningskamp mot Norge U25 med 17-13 i går|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS can make 3@C - but how do they get there?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|jr7: Good morning all|pg||
nt|jr7: Maria and Matias baybee the best DKpair|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 9 tricks the limit for n/s in hearts|pg||

nt|jr7: maybee|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|sybarra: yes, I was looking for 10 also |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  welcome back|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yuval10: if 3@s is weak, quite surprising that E didn't X for TO|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4@S making if trumps aren't played|pg||
nt|hesse: Good morning :)|pg||
nt|hesse: Swedn with a 14 imp lead before the last 14 boards of the match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, this may be a way|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: you have to guess the @d's too|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Gerben42:  welcome back :)|pg||
nt|hesse: *Sweden|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about nt? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or we may play a quiet 2 @H |pg||
nt|ady: no realy play for game in no-trump either|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  very solid 1@H opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Arild Jakobsen and Gerben Dirksen|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: hi all welcome to the 2. half of the Nordic junior matck denmark U-20 - denmark U-25|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Preempt with 5c support might not always be the right descision, they should read Mike Lawrence books|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Urban - do u realy belive in the LAW?|pg||
nt|pelu: a guide-line, but not the 8. wonder of the world :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: not even the 7th :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Not necessary Peter but it can be a guide in difficult situations if you know how many trumphs both side have|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Scores after 1st half: Finland vs Faroes Islands 90-6 - Sweden U25 vs Sweden U20 50-19 - Norway U25 vs Norway U20 26-36|pg||
nt|hesse: Norway U20 won the first match yesterday against Norway U25 17-13|pg||
nt|pelu: good morning|pg||
nt|hesse: Sweden won their first match last evening with 25-0 and has started off well|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  they are a very experienced team|pg||
nt|hesse: Norway U20 won 17-13 against Norway U25 last night|pg||
nt|sater1957: this opening might lead to a 4@h game|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 3@h should make when @d 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: NS 5 card major, EW 5 card @s and 4 card @h - both strong NT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jr7: 1 x@S and then @H = 1 down|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|hesse: Sweden U25 won 25-0 against Sweden U20|pg||
nt|peachy: nice jacking up the auction by N|pg||
nt|jr7: very dificult to get 1 down - had to attack @H|pg||
nt|jr7: 3@D|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sater1957: which happens to make, if you do things right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everyone!|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  dont take it as a proof that you should open this|pg||
nt|jr7: a lot af things must he do right :-)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: should lose 2 spade  1 diamond and 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|ady: difficult for east to play the 8 on first trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: after the 10, not sure he should |pg||
nt|ady: sorry should lose 1 spade  not 2|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  because I think you shouldnt, if East opens you are still very much in the race|pg||
nt|jr7: 4@C 1 down|pg||
nt|peachy: Maria attempts a cunning underlead,|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I need more coffee, don't y'all think so....|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: for sure :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Gerben42:  Gundesen wants to play this hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sater1957: this should solve the @c|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you never know what do do with the North hand - picture partner with @CJx and 3@c may not be so hot |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: sorry 10 played|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: Still, impressive that the Faroe Islands can field a team, with just 50,000 inhabitants|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: Many cities with more than 50,000 don't even have one junior in the clubs|pg||
nt|sater1957: North was thrown in at trick 0|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Gerben42:  might as well be in 5 then, same finesse|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: normal play after E has show: @HAK + @C QJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, you're not doing anything over 3@H, so it doesn't really matter|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  better hand for chinese poker than for leading against 4@H|pg||
nt|sater1957: now a small @S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this safety play in trumps will set W on a @s guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: So I think it´s better to win with @hA and play another @c|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but still guesses in @s and @d|pg||
nt|sater1957: @d goes on @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: pergaps I should have said @s or @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps....|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: @s goes on @c @d he can always guess right while if @s AQ on back|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Gerben42:  oops :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes But S will return a @c|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|peachy: 4C is easier to set than 3D|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|h5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there might be a defence to beat 3@h, but this isn't it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Gerben42:  its convenient to get @D right on this line|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|hesse: declearer has to get a @d trick|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  in this situation they could play good/bad then 3@D shows a "real hand" and E can cooperate|pg||

nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Good evening Hedy|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 5@d seemes like a fair shot here... Either no @h lead or @d K in place:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Hey Hedy|pg||
nt|jr7: 5@C|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Gerben42:  tough @H break here...|pg||
nt|jr7: or 4@H|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @H is good also|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@dx even better :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Hey Yuval|pg||
nt|jr7: a lot af loosers in 5@D :)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|jr7: yes 5@D is good|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: 1@H or 2NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: what do u prefer?|pg||
nt|jr7: I dont like 2 x A|pg||
nt|peachy: Definitely worth biddingm vulnerable, if N knew South's had is that good|pg||
nt|hawe45: An awful 2 NT - but what is better?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: 2NT probably specific - hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@h?|pg||
nt|jr7: Dbl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: shows 4@s|pg||
nt|hesse: I think I would have bid 2NT|pg||
nt|hesse: Bakke showing a decent @h raise|pg||
nt|hesse: yes, and the @s break is not much better, so E/W better stay at low level|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  slam-killing 2NT opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: N should be desciplined and pass here|pg||
nt|pelu: when close I perfer the bid with max presure on opp|pg||
nt|pelu: = 2NT|pg||
nt|jr7: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: An easy 4@h here irrespective of the lead, E can get back in tr to ruff last @d|pg||
nt|yuval10: otherwise he can find himself very quickly in a hopeless 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: make a note - Jørgen agree with me :):)|pg||
nt|hesse: :)|pg||
nt|jr7: never happend again :)|pg||
nt|hesse: Hagen is showing minimum values|pg||
nt|ady: n/s could make 5@D as they lay    but would have to guess diamond position   and club finesse has to be right   so poos contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: i bet he doesnt either , but that is what they gave him|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h probably best from South as his defensive assets are rather poor, else bid 4@d|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pass...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|milton_se: hopeless, yes, but a good result|pg||
nt|ady: this is hopless on a heart lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will scare the declarer to death |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: only chance now should be to play for @c Kj in place|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Gerben42:  but systemic for most of the planet|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: in fact I do not see how to make it|pg||
nt|sater1957: 6@c is not *that* good|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|nubmaster: It's not "that" hopeless Yuval... as a spectator said, even with tr lead 4@h makes because of the good @c break so it is a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|yuval10: especially since unoubled|pg||
nt|pelu: I might be wrong, but a @H-lead will defeat 4@h??|pg||
nt|nubmaster: nope, you can play on @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: well usually not too many good things can do when you stretch your hand like N did here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good evening|pg||
nt|pelu: interesting point: what is the weakest bid by E? Pass or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jr7: with @H 4-1 is this not good|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yuval10: you could very well play in 4@h X|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H is -1 or making depends on @D ruff|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: can happen even|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so probably making|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hesse: good morning :)|pg||
nt|hesse: good spot for E/W, should be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hesse: a @c lead may set it|pg||
nt|pelu: my ex partner, Thomas Berg had a rule. when pass is an option its the weakest bid!|pg||
nt|hesse: this may be 2 down at best defence|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jr7: 4@D wins|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: but 2h weaker than 2d|pg||
nt|sybarra: and its not |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  good point|pg||
nt|jr7: 1 down|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jr7: I agree with Berg - but Roland means not|pg||
nt|pelu: but over the X of 2@D?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2h is weaker than pass usually|pg||
nt|pelu: FOR SURE ITS AN EASY RULE - EASY TO REMEMBER AND EASY TO FOLLOW|pg||
nt|jr7: I bid 3@D after D|pg||
nt|pelu: sorre caps lock:(:(|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  trump promotion?|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5 first tricks to the defense plus the @hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: take 2@d As K and a @s more|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: A K*|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Henry |pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS are twins - born in 1995|pg||

mb|p|nt|hesse: what rebid do you prefer in north?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so they dont play drury..|pg||
nt|hedyg: why is 2@H alerted ?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzct: Yes now they are both blond|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzct: No i dont think that there have been any penalties yet|pg||
nt|hesse: Not easy for E/W to win the part score contract|pg||
nt|hesse: ...after 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: hey they are jrs.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: I dont know :) he alerted it so..|pg||
nt|jr7: 8-11|pg||
nt|jr7: and only xxx @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: how is 3NT? - make on @H or @S leads - @Ds blocked forNS, so a bad contract with a lot of play|pg||
nt|blum1956: if they play 2/1 2@c may be not that disappointing|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  what other than 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: 4@c showes the void|pg||
nt|ady: some might raise only to 2@H with north hand  with a number of soft value cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this could lead to 2@Cx|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hesse: they may end in slam now|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  recently we had a long discussion on what 2NT should show here in a standard bidding context|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  12-14 or 15-17|pg||
nt|ralfwil: i dont´t like that 2nt on N with only @c10x. 3@d is better|pg||
nt|jr7: I agree|pg||
nt|ralfwil: AQJ is as good as a 4-card support|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D is probably best then S bids 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, not doubled. No trouble then|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nubmaster: Easy 4@s with probably 4 tricks only|pg||
nt|sybarra: sad news for all of us,  Mike Gold (lestergold) a fellow commentator from England, died yestereay |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: claimed 9|pg||
nt|jr7: easy play|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jr7: 2Cx = 7 tricks (I think)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure the TDs shal push the players - but I still dont understand why the scedule are so gard - only 110 min for 14 boards - international standard = 119 (indl 1 min pr. bords ...|pg||
nt|pelu: with screens) and only 10 min break???|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 2@h alert mas misswrite sry:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: might play AK@H now to avoid a @d ruff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|ady: got easier with diamond discards on spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW need to get the diamond ruff|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|blum1956: The @dJ may look as a keycard feom S's point of  view...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jr7: 6 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hesse: with an opening pass in south, som pairs may end in 3NT|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|pelu: why help S to get ruffs? - EW know that NS are on a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|hesse: but this should be -2 and a "good part score" for E/W|pg||
nt|jr7: @H is better|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Agree Peter, these guys and girls are often more unexperienced than 26+ players representing their country in bigger events so give them the time|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  anyone has the result site?|pg||

mb|p|nt|jr7: 3@S against 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c|pg||
nt|jr7: 6@C ? |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as unless the 1Nt bidder has diamonds, it is highly likely that his only suit is clubs|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|ady: another game for n/s   either 4@H   or 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Very hard to bid now A nice bid from Maria!|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|henryb:  With good guesses N-S can make 6@h or 6N. Not likely to bid either|pg||
nt|sybarra: my thought would be, N will opted for 4 @H|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  pass|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  the question is, what should W do now|pg||
nt|sater1957: Hand plays bad for NS, might as well let EW play :-)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: pragmatic 4@s bid, has my sympathy|pg||

pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: not seo very often, but once I had that @h and rebid. after that we played the only game in 4@h|pg||

nt|sater1957: Now S has the blocking hand to play. Luckily he is only in 1NT|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jr7: @s from N and I think alså 11|pg||

nt|peachy: or any NT :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: indeed he did|pg||
nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at favourable it is acceptable to give up some bidding precision to make opponent's life tough|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hesse: bold call from west|pg||
nt|blum1956: The defense needs the club lead to beat this|pg||
nt|granguru: 24 combined points and only 6 visiblee tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: what do you think of norths opening bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: fits the system|pg||
nt|pelu: its there system - so..:)|pg||
nt|ady: might get overboard here|pg||
nt|jr7: 2nt must show @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: @D lead = 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: 3s better be forcing though, not clear to me it should be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  normal contract reached though|pg||
nt|hesse: and a very aggressive double from north|pg||
nt|jr7: sorry 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 8 if @c guess |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h presumably shows some values|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nubmaster: Only 800 vs 1370, amazing 4@d bid...|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 2 @D sort of slowed everything down |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|nubmaster: Well, it is juniors...|pg||
nt|ady: slam mainly on diamond finesse and brake|pg||
nt|jr7: He can not win this 3NT - I think so! :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  probably best try is to duck a @C and hope for good breaks elsewhere|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  which of course are not there|pg||
nt|sater1957: I was just wondering if EW, top of their form, can let this make....|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, by either side, actually|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|pelu: N has a passed partner, but still: 4@D for major is not in my book :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: he might regret his 4@d bid if his team-mates bids to the grand on the OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: but of course it's a great result|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But N thought that... (my partner passed and I have 6 p in non vul and 5440... let's make a try to preempt)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Hans this is a good start :)|pg||
nt|jr7: maybee first a small @H from both hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  beer card in first trick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: I meant N or S|pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for the @d suit..|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Might get a dbl here..?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT over 2@s would have described the hand perfectly in N|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: and he can complain to pd: u sh have Q10 in @C not in @d :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 3@c @s KQ and J back for @h J ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 1100 then :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Now youre faddish :) But it is correct|pg||
nt|henryb:  and finding a place for declarer's third spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: i assume that 2@H by E shows a good raise in @s|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: asking for the minor and the bid @S either F or strong invit depending on agreements|pg||
nt|jr7: 5@C = 1 ace|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  can only count on about 10 HCP from partner, two Aces might not beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: What a waste!|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  gotta be a prize for that too|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  duck a @H next|pg||
nt|granguru: 8 tricks possible now|pg||
nt|sater1957: could this lead to a @h @c squeeze on East?|pg||
nt|granguru: playing @HAK and @D...fouble dummy of course|pg||
nt|granguru: double*|pg||
nt|granguru: now he needs only @C 3-3 to get 9|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  is it that double dummy? W bid @S and led @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think the best play is ducking a @c but will not succed this time|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  what does he have|pg||
nt|jr7: after @D lead he know the hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  duck @C and duck @S - gotta get your loser count right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but W can have a 2-card @c and a stiff @h|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  probably best is to duck TWO @S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  lose 2@D 2@S and turn the table on E|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D rebid kept them out of trouble    some might rebid 3@D|pg||
pc|c6|nt|granguru: @S7?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this wasn´t a winning line|pg||
nt|jr7: intra-finess in @H and 3@S maybee 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzct: ohh well..:)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: not now then|pg||
nt|hedyg: who will let them play 3@s?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: wd|pg||
nt|hesse: good spot for N/S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok excellent auction|pg||
nt|blum1956: still may switch to clubs|pg||

nt|jr7: no one :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|hesse: I would not have doubled with a pd showing 9-12|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @HK and play a @D?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: duplicated across the field no doubt (not)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d6|nt|pelu: pass in N and 2@C by S not so easy|pg||
nt|granguru: dont forget S does not know opponents exact distribution ...he can still expect @C 3-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  after the @D lead its safe to assume that is not the case|pg||
nt|granguru: it is against odds I agree|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  another @S seems best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some players use Lebensohl (2NT) in these auctions. That has a weakness in that if opener raises responder's suit, it can be awkward for the defence to sort out which suit they ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: have and whether to bid on or not      |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @C 3-3?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: in standard 2c by south and later splinter by north accomplishes the same|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: doesnt need a place for 3rd sp |pg||
pc|s9|nt|Gerben42:  W cant lead @S back so will turn on @H|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another diamond....|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jr7: No more @S|pg||
nt|pelu: place sweden Ew then Pass i N and 2@H in East - and then bid trouble for NS|pg||
nt|pelu: 1 more is Ok - can still ruff 2 x@C and discard on @DAK|pg||
nt|jr7: I dont think he will win - @D 4-3 and @C 5-3 or catch @DJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: has to ruff 2 clubs and tak pitches before drawing rest of trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: he will make - a bet? :) a coke?|pg||
nt|jr7: Y|pg||
nt|fabsayc: make mine bourbon and coke|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  very close contract - down 1|pg||
nt|hesse: but well defended, and 200 instead of 100 for Sweden :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  why?|pg||
nt|sybarra: he got a spade lead and has 3 sp tricks|pg||
nt|ady: hearts were 3-3   and jack could have been doubleton|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Gerben42:  then you play @D|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|hesse: Sweden won 11 imps on their good 6@s in board 17|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: not that it will matter|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jr7: V has only 13 cards - dont play @C|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: also chances of a club trick    apart from the opening spade lead   and a possible opening heart lead|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hesse: and they are now ahead|pg||
nt|hesse: west have to play @d to the 10 now, but that will fail|pg||
nt|blum1956: If South has a club less and a spade more the contract could come home. But it may be 2 off if declarer plays for that distribution|pg||
nt|hesse: west probably counting points now, and find that south has to have @dK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d5|nt|blum1956: No reason for the diamond finesse, the @dK being with South for sure|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: hand 3   $@H was not bid in OR   auction started 1@H    2@H   not 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 4@s can make here ?|pg||
nt|jr7: on no hp|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: and so can &d?|pg||
nt|hedyg: you mean 6 @c/@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 6@d*|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: 4@H not bid|pg||
nt|jr7: sory - wrong|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes and @c to @c10|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yuval10: the light overcall here can result a disaster for Denmark|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: 4 imps for Norway in board 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm 3@d would not be forcing for EW?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: some would bid 1@D in West|pg||
nt|hesse: Sweden made 4@h+1|pg||
nt|henryb:  also not made|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play transfers in so many situations and no Rubensohl here :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Rubensohl?|pg||
nt|hedyg: okok i will find it for you|pg||
nt|peachy: Opener has a supernax for suitplay, 14 of his 16 HCP are in controls and he has 5-4-22|pg||
nt|peachy: *max|pg||
nt|jr7: nor many in DK play Rubensohl - but Lebensohl|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgehands.com/R/Rubinsohl_Rubensohl_Transfer_Lebensohl.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: anyone for double as South over 1NT?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jr7: good start|pg||
nt|pelu: down 1 look normal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: win and low diamond might work, else likely down one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: playing 2/1 many would respond 2@H|pg||
nt|henryb:  only if also playing sound opening bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: 2@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: cooomon 2@s  :)))|pg||
nt|yuval10: good possibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: to come to 7 tricks S will play for the drop of @Dq|pg||
nt|sater1957: 4@s coming up|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if we play it here |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Lebensohl i do know ;) Ty Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: some play lebensohl, some rubensohl|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  If you open the west hand you cannot game force with East|pg||
nt|yuval10: how to find the @s fit in EW....perhaps if E can bid 1@s as 4+|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzct: This is where Maria should say ok.. if you cant play 3nt lets try 6@d :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mentioned Rubensohl because their CC says they play a lot of transfer bids|pg||
nt|jr7: I dont like Matias 1 nt - he had a good revers|pg||
nt|peachy: Neither of EW was able to count 12 top tricks, understandably|pg||
nt|hedyg: 16 is a bit short..|pg||
nt|peachy: The controls alone IMO speak strongly, so not too weak at all, combines with good suits|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hesse: E/W playing puppet stayman|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jr7: good lead|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|hesse: west showing 4 card @s with his 3@h-bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: E was worth a 4NT bid here|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: So this will problebly be a big swing for sweeden..|pg||
nt|hedyg: this will not be a success|pg||
nt|peachy: EW must get a heart ruff, otherwise this will a very sad ending|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Wow They might just do that!|pg||
nt|peachy: Sweden has a chance of big swing here if they get to the slam|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jr7: 7@D|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|blum1956: NS with their 16 PC may probably make 4@h while for EW  8 tricks in spades is a top|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt anybody can get to a slam with the EW hands|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: should just get home  though could make an overtrick ruff finessing the 3rd round of spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: does N get out with club now? or ? |pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer will make his contract easily|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: even if small @d i think he would finesse|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: Opening 1NT it will be difficult|pg||
nt|jr7: why not 1@C -> 2@D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hesse: DJ in @h is not worth much for E/W in this deal|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: problem was there is no sure fast entry to south hand on this line|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|hedyg: and N will slip under the table?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|peachy: There should be a way to identify 12 top tricks, somehow :)|pg||
nt|jr7: why not try|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|sT|pc|d5|nt|hedyg: he will not pass a 1@c opening either?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt look right |pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzct: no problebly was not either..|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: sry|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|peachy: No, he wont|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: when both opps are preempting you have very space to find your tricks in|pg||
nt|jr7: it is very wrong to open 1NT on that hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: GREAT Defence here!|pg||
nt|peachy: Indeed, however, opening a control-rich 5-4 and maximum with 1NT seldom is right|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|peachy: W had nothing to say, and E vulnerable against not.  Normallyu the hand with shortness in their suit has to be aggressive, but here, passing is normal, too risky to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Partial? i dont know.. im not rooting for anyone... but you must admit.. It would be cool to see perfect defence again:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: whatever 3@C is, i dont like it|pg||
nt|hesse: 1@d is showing @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a later @d bid will show a stronger 2-suiter as I bid|pg||

nt|jr7: Treldes 10 show @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: still can beat it|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|athene: maybe 3@C = any minimum? that's quite common these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the hand is not minimum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 54 automatically one extra trick|pg||
nt|athene: true, but as far as slam potential goes it's pretty bad, with those minor suits|pg||
nt|ady: club lead ducked best|pg||
nt|yuval10: 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hesse: if 3@c=minimum, then north has to have a better bid over 3@d|pg||
nt|jr7: yes, but 2 x Qx is not the best|pg||
nt|fabsayc: plenty of time to sort that out if you dont rush to game|pg||

pc|sA|nt|nubmaster: Good|pg||
nt|pelu: after 4. suit (for me GF) 3Nt is the weakest bid in the book (11-12)|pg||
nt|hesse: I normally prefer 2NT as the stronger hand after 4th suit |pg||
nt|jr7: so must 4.color = game|pg||
nt|pelu: tes|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: Sabine Auken's advice is to bid 2C over their 1D whenever it is remotely possible, few partnerships are well equipped to bid over that|pg||
nt|jr7: @DQ ??? - now they can clean the other colors|pg||
nt|jr7: sorry - no|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: im guessing @d ace was a downer on his minimum hand..|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|nubmaster: But dont understand W's 4NT bid with 4333, what has he shown first two rounds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 2nt showed 14+|pg||
nt|hesse: but my prefered system makes my rebid 2@s after the @h response to show reverse with this distribution|pg||
nt|pelu: when u play WJS (weak jump shift) - here 2@H first time, then 3@H would be forcing and a better bid for Ns hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: i think only 27 minuts left for these 5 boards not sure tho..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C only slam that makes|pg||
nt|pelu: only slam with a chance is 6@C, but - as I se - a @S lead will defeat|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the idea is to knock out late entry to dummy, yes spade leads beat 6@C|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|nubmaster: Oh, I see, only 14+ vs a GF 2-over-1 bid I suppose|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||

nt|jr7: UPS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|blum1956: diabolic lead! Now the trump switch beats the contract|pg||
nt|granguru: @DK instead of @CK would have been better|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|hedyg: was it 2@c over 1@d only or any suit?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: usually you lead passively against 6nt but perhaps there was a case for an active lead here with dummy known to have a trick source in hearts|pg||
nt|hesse: Hagen with a very aggressive and unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|athene: but still south insisting on notrumps he really has to have a double diamond stopper|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|pelu: 2@C = GF with +4 @C|pg||

nt|vugraphzct: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 1 sec|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: needed a spade lead versus 6nt also to break up any squeeze|pg||
nt|hesse: Norway did not find the @s lead in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@H or X?|pg||
nt|jr7: 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
nt|peachy: That is the age-old question.  For me, I bid 1S when 5-4 and Dbl when 4-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: might get Q@C lead|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzct: 6@d is a good spot here|pg||
nt|sater1957: sorry, got to go, have a good match|pg||
nt|granguru: good luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: actually maybe 6nt was cold anyway|pg||
nt|pelu: No - West has to discard after S - so no @s-@d squeeze|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c= @D+@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: there was a three suit squeeze without spade lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: might |pg||
nt|henryb:  Q or low makes no difference|pg||
nt|ady: with the diamond situation should make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: I like Fit Jumps in competition, takes away room and allows to identify side fit if any|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: I would dbl.. giving pd some cards so he can bid his suit.. |pg||
nt|hedyg: W pulling the emergency brakes|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely E in the tank|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzct: an easy dbl from Mikael in my book..|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hesse: Information and results og this Championship can be found here: http://www2.bridge.dk/NBU.aspx?ID=5456|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the 3-suit squeeze might work even on a spade lead but it doesn't quite|pg||
nt|blum1956: There was time to recover - it is not necessary to make a FIRST spade lead|pg||
nt|hesse: so this could be a crucial point of the match|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  double game swing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7@D even better than 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: If 1NT shows at least 2c @h, do you agree bidding 2@h over 1Nt?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not N|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: A good 7@d and an even better 6@d ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Slam only need  club queento be found|pg||
nt|hedyg: no! not a good grand!|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Both hengs on same so might aswell bid 7|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's more of a X than the last board...|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Exacly :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You need some fairly firm agreements about splinter jumps in that kind of auction - one requirement should be a pretty good first suit |pg||
pc|c3|nt|granguru: better is normally to lead second high from xxxx(x)|pg||
nt|jr7: and Dbl gave them the way :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and @ds no worse than 3-1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: no Andi|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: goes all out and played hearts twice from the north hand  can make 11   but that is too risly|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|peachy: The power of controls again (Aces and kings and good suits)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nubmaster: A fairly good tr and points in only two suits will often be better in tr play|pg||
nt|pelu: 76-27 is a big diff - but in 3 boards U20-team has lost 57 IMPs on tecnical errors - board 18 cost 22 - the 6@S was home but.. -11/+11|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In fact the decl only finessed @h ONCE Peter on the 6@s board... amazing, he had entries|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but lead comes thru strong hand & 5332 is not that good for suit play, and your outside queen is in pds suit so maybe 4-5 tricks ther|pg||
nt|jr7: who has @CQ|pg||
nt|granguru: so here N goes with the odds playing the @CJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  Only risky if West, strangely, did not lead a @h from AQJxx|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes - not bad getting 790 when opps are cold for a grand|pg||
nt|ady: yes   true|pg||
nt|jr7: a lot af people play 1-3-5|pg||
nt|peachy: plus, a doublefit, to boot|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hesse: Norway made the @s-slam, and got ahead of the match|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@D 4@H p p X p p p - who should have done more?|pg||
nt|granguru: and losing  at rick|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: however i dislike the 5@D bid, there is no rush! bid 3@H and lets see|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nubmaster: Down 2 now with correct defence while 2@h probably makes|pg||

nt|marlowepi: lucky game here|pg||
nt|athene: but here there was more - with @CQ east might make a negative double of 1@S for a start|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  or was this a case of "preempts work"|pg||
nt|sybarra: low scoring match so far|pg||
nt|ady: wonder how 3NT was reached in OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: a chance for a swing here in favour of Denmark|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957: the latter I am afraid|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @C-2 nt -3nt|pg||
nt|henryb:  East was in a "mystery squeeze". Did not know whether South had four hearts AK or three diamonds A|pg||
nt|yuval10: East on the OR didn't jump with the A@c for the defeating @d switch|pg||
mb|1C|an|alert|nt|marlowepi: have to guess spades though|pg||
nt|granguru: they must read Lajos Linczmayer "Natural therapy for defense disorders" |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  1@D = @H again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  N can Dbl this for T/O|pg||

nt|ralfwil: a lucku 3nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting. Presumably Easy led a spade against 3NT - so how did it make....   |pg||
nt|yuval10: E didn't jump with the A@c when N smartly played @c frum dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, East only has one entry |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|pelu: no can discard a @S on 4. @c|pg||

mb|p|nt|sater1957: NS in possible trouble|pg||
nt|ady: north opened 1@C open room  east passed  and south responded 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would double also with N hand|pg||
nt|granguru: a 344 pages book which analyzes all defensive signals situations...a marvelous book|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, you were faster, sry|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nubmaster: try @c first|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this should keep EW out of game|pg||

nt|hesse: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: u still have lot of sopades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh, sry Peter :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: That's  why I strictly prefer the systems with 11-16 opening range - in that kind of system the 5@d (or4@s) bid from South after partner's double is clear|pg||
nt|ady: trying some evasive action if e/w had game    not wise red against green|pg||
nt|hedyg: 11-13 balancing 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: 2@c probably showing equal legth in the two unbid suits|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this auction is why transfer walsh belongs on the front page of the int. CC|pg||
nt|hedyg: N a bit optimistic|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: u dont get to discard a spade from S hand on the long club in S hand|pg||

nt|granguru: dont forget this tip if you are an expert and want to became a world champion|pg||

pc|s2|nt|hesse: I got the systemcard here, and they have specified this auction|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jr7: small spade from S|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hesse: the 3@s looks hard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then over 2s west should try with 3d not 3s|pg||
nt|sater1957: should be a wash afte3r all|pg||
nt|jr7: E had to use @SK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|peachy: Whn all or most of the HCP outstanding are in one hand, it is wise to bid to aggressive bames, but I think N went too far in that :)|pg||

nt|peachy: games|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: the 5@D in OR look like a misunderstanding - 4@D x by N and many players would just pass in S|pg||

nt|yuval10: now an easy double-squeeze for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: At this time no.. but if yo think about it.. if S only needed K he would prob place East with it and go on @h and finesse ..|pg||
nt|yuval10: Denmark scored a very surprising 12 imps on board 25|pg||
nt|yuval10: 23 rather|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yuval10: declarer played small @h over the lead and that gives the def. the tempo to play @s before A@c was knocked-out|pg||

nt|hedyg: partner i opened 1@d, not 1@H :(|pg||

nt|mdgraham: where's Roland? How good is 6@s? |pg||
mb|3H|nt|hesse: they got a @d-lead too|pg||
nt|jr7: 4@H must be easy to get|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT= @c|pg||
mb|4S|nt|nubmaster: Correct Marshall but it was a beautiful play in the other room, elimitated @cs and @hs and opps tr and then played K of @s fron N... E was endplayed... wery well done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 5D can be  beaten if E unblocks trump king under ace? entry issues....anyway unlikely plays w/o DD access:)|pg||
nt|milton_se: anyone more than me who dislikes X?|pg||
nt|hesse: so the match tightens up|pg||
nt|hedyg: transfer bid|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand now, second half begins shortly, scheduled in 20 minutes http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|jr7: 2nt = @H|pg||
nt|jr7: I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: maybee 4 loosers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might make on this lead|pg||
nt|hesse: @h is not a good lead, you cant expect your pd to have @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 6@s is a very good slam.. either you missing an ace and have to finesse for @s Q or you missing @s KQ and only need them not to sit Kqx behins ace|pg||
mb|4N|nt|marlowepi: the possibility of that  line is why i said at the outset that NS have a lucky game here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: vwd indeed|pg||
nt|granguru: so Norway took the lead now by 6 imps|pg||
nt|peachy: sorry, 14 is last. Where is that coffee when I need it :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: N pass: no @c fit ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957: 3@c, junior bridge|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe he doesnt believe his eyes, partner shows hearts and he is staring ar AKJ109|pg||
nt|peachy: just kidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Shows xx in @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Andi :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|fabsayc: probably double dummy though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yikes|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like more than 50%, especially after the 3@h|pg||
nt|jr7: had to play @s from home|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Andres, do  we have a site for results?|pg||
nt|granguru: this hand should be a tie|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i confess i would bid 3N rather than X|pg||
nt|milton_se: any day in the week|pg||
nt|pelu: I am glad that this is 2. last board - back to the 5@D : very well played and very diff to defeat - sleep well - I do :)|pg||
nt|granguru: good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Looks like a probable down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c looks like  a @d cue IF 2NT was @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: 2 x A but nor Q|pg||
nt|yuval10: both players in W go "by the book" , they missed a key-card and the Q of trump so they stopped in 5|pg||
nt|jr7: not Q|pg||
pc|hT|nt|nubmaster: Agree Marshall... pass or 3NT in a sunny day|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe i'd pass at my funeral, but facing a PH it could certainly be the winner:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cannot go wrong in @s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: too many hearts, danger dummy wins for pitch, the reason for the preempt|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: west very quiet here    might have offered red card|pg||
nt|jr7: they cant hurt the contrakt|pg||
nt|hedyg: so a quiet push|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|nubmaster: hahaha|pg||
nt|sater1957: difficult to score better than -2 I would guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  -2 would be a success with this dummy wont you think|pg||
nt|sater1957: Exactly|pg||
nt|sater1957: but heart finess on, A@S bare ...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42:  i was thinking 2@C-2 but it's 3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  trumps 3-3|pg||
nt|henryb:  and seen them run to 2@h?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|granguru: s goes again with the odds playing a @C honor from dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: OR bad result on 24 - 3NT-1|pg||
nt|yuval10: E being too practical with the 3NT bid... don't need to rush|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|nubmaster: in the other room East ducked first @c so K and A fell on second one for +3 in 3NT|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes...with 6430 shape, West might have removed it |pg||
pc|dA|nt|milton_se: 3NT often makes even when it's chanceless with open cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: going back to 5D, declarer did play nicely but the real star was E, who according to the hand record did indeed go up with D king on first round of suit. when declarer won this in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dummy, contract can now be defeated. W needed to led nine of spades but continued hearts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: u are right - but decl can duck @DK - so 51D is cold :)|pg||
nt|hesse: the @h switch may give Sweden some well deserved imps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: nobody likes this defense, to the point of SHOUTING|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub17/Turneringer/KampResultat925.html  site for results|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: when E played D king , declarer needed to duck....really have nothing to losde by doing so and nothing to gain by winning ace. so declarer's performance was flawed...only E rang ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the bell|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s6|nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, right, my point was that if hand record is accurate then it is E who deserves the primary kudos on the hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: now the last board |pg||
pc|s7|nt|granguru: best is @D and @D |pg||
pc|s8|nt|hesse: probably -4|pg||
nt|granguru: now @C|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jr7: well played|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|hesse: I guess Flått will get a bidding lesson from the captain before the next match|pg||
pc|s9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|pelu: fore sure, but the play of !K = endplay om East also very nice|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pelu: @sK|pg||
nt|ady: e/w should certainly either be playing the hand or doubling opps with their values|pg||
nt|granguru: now declarer depends on @S split|pg||
nt|granguru: claim time|pg||
pc|c3|mc|12|nt|vugraphzct: So.. This will be the last board of the match and the last board for today!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Almost the end now, so time for a few words of thanks: to our excellent operator Andreas Plejdrup, to the Nordic Bridge Union, and to the Danish Bridge Federation (Charlotte ...|pg||

nt|fabsayc: as i said might make was not sure he would find the club finesse|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3@c just made|pg||
nt|sater1957: brutal punishment, but just punishment|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  educational punishment|pg||

nt|mdgraham: perceptive comments. |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|nubmaster: But if you decide to bid 4@d then probably 5@c will works and it did on this deal|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last hand of the segment |pg||
mb|2D|nt|nubmaster: x now for a push?|pg||
nt|ady: suppose +200  for e/w was a reasonable scorfe   and a good one in the light of their team mates pick up 100|pg||
nt|hedyg: and thanks to Andreas Plejdrup our outstanding operator who has been at it since over 12 hours today! well done Andi :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Ty :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: thanks all|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|hesse: Bakke showing 3 card @h|pg||
nt|jr7: 1 looser in each color in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: EW will not arrive at 4@H here |pg||
nt|granguru: which is in fact an exagerated contract|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hesse: 2@h weaker @s raise then 2@d it lookes like..|pg||
nt|yuval10: good judgment by the Swede EW to reach 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx to andres our brilliant operator.  great job  |pg||
nt|hedyg: as well to my fellow commentors Raija and Joergen for donating their time and sharing their wisdom :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks Hedy!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: interesting gamble by S, whose limited values he knows will all be working|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Well N get punished for his micro opening in vul vs nonvul...|pg||
nt|sater1957: NS have no reason to do anything wild, so probably no slam|pg||
nt|jr7: very good start - he looked enemies card :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: E/W will probably end in @d at the 4 level|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are running a bit late. The second half is supposed to start in 2 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: p-----a---s----s|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks for joining us, we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|jr7: 4@C and 4@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can't defeat 3NT with that lay of the cards, it seem|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hesse: this match will end with a comfortable victory to the swedes|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes a victory but lots of swings - exciting junior bridge|pg||
nt|jr7: a red squeeze against N = 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: punishment is +3|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Henry and David, my co commentators.  We appreciate your insights |pg||
nt|ady: 5@D a decent save   though 5@S makes|pg||

nt|sater1957: brrr....|pg||
nt|granguru: great plays by Simonsen|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@c looks challenging as opposite to 3NT|pg||
nt|hesse: @s ace onside helps|pg||
nt|sater1957: might just make, but is iffy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unblock?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: y|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jr7: he must play @h now - yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nubmaster: wasn't|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3 ways to win by bidding|pg||
nt|hesse: this contract need careful play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hesse: spade continuation is probably best for the defence|pg||
nt|granguru: another @C and an uppercut for the defensive hand of the year|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: 5h makes, 4s makes, or they save in 5s at the colors|pg||
