nt|sga1: Four session to go, only 8 imps difference, any thing possible.|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari should have exited with @ck on winning @SK in last deal, SS was one 1 down|pg||
nt|rv: all 3 teams in the trials are fairly evenly matched though Formidables have the best form in recent months, I anticipate semis and finals to be very close and go down to the wire|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables have been seeded to finals because they won 2 of the 3main qualifying events for the trials, both Summer and Winter Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: Texans won 3rd qualifying event National Masters with very different quorum of team, hence had to pay 5 lacks as direct entry to participate here|pg||
nt|rv: DSM qualified as runner-up of Summer Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: runner-up of Winter Nationals, Poddar Developers did not field team here because of some internal issues, very sad indeed|pg||
nt|rv: 5 lacks translates to 0.5 million rupees, about 10,000 USD:)|pg||
nt|rv: as per current exchange rate approx 11,000 USD|pg||
nt|rv: we have power failure at the venue, lost internet connectivity which means access to game and for Subhash Gupta to be ungagged|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables represented India the maximum times in last decade or so, they have won BFAME 4 times, reached QFs of Bermuda Bowl twice as well as R16 in Rosenblum during this period|pg||
nt|rv: apologies folks, waiting for power and connectivity to be back|pg||
nt|rv: I am not at the venue, doing commentary from home|pg||
nt|rv: P.Sridhar has won silver and bronze medal as part of Texan Aces in 2 successive European Open tournies, SS was part of team when they won bronze and Sumit was part of team when ...|pg||
nt|rv: they silver|pg||
nt|rv: pls stick around, let me call up folks at venue and check|pg||
nt|rv: power just back|pg||
nt|rv: we should be on in a couple of mins|pg||
nt|rv: they do have power back-up / generator at the venue, surprising it is taking awhile|pg||
nt|rv: according to BFI MPs, Pritish Kushari must be amongst the top 3 or 4 MPs holder in the country, he has earned most of the points as part of all-conquering Indian Railways team|pg||
nt|panja: symmetric North hand in blacks....difficult for W to know the best shift unless E could guid|pg||
nt|panja: guide even|pg||
nt|subhranp: slam board early in the day|pg||
nt|figo: and 13 tricks on top :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rv: for nearly a decade from mid-90s, Indian Railways used to have monopoly of all National team events|pg||
nt|panja: light opening...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: play was lost due to some disturbance sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: neck to neck fight nice to watch sudhir :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|figo: EW here is a relatively new partnership |pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: S should open with that hand|pg||
nt|sga1: How many would open 3@d with that hand vul, literally 9 loser hand. I would not.|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes :)|pg||
nt|rv: great, we are back on and hi again to Subhash Gupta|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Six @ds looks like the spot here.|pg||
nt|key1809: 6d making , lest see ,they can reach or not|pg||
mb|3N|nt|subhranp: 3nt easier here than 4h|pg||
nt|figo: A Goel is also the sponsor of  DSM team ( dhampur sugar mills )|pg||
nt|panja: hi all again, hi Arvind|pg||
nt|figo: hi Prakash |pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand, this one, B72|pg||
nt|figo: indeed |pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: when you dont have spades, you have to get in early or they may make it too awkward for you to compete|pg||
nt|sga1: Doesn't fall into any rule 2-3-4 or not even for aggressive players with 2-3-4-5 rule.|pg||
nt|offthebend: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt will make though because of 33 Club break|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: Excelente Resultado para N-S en la otra sala|pg||
nt|panja: true...with extra strength...and near balanced hands..it is always worthwhile exploring 3N in preference to 4 of a Major|pg||
nt|panja: here though, with all the Aces, North is likely to prefer a @S game|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: thats a good lead for declarer :)|pg||
nt|sga1: 4 quick tricks for defense.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|subhranp: 2n presumably jacoby, 3h probably showing 6carder heart|pg||
nt|panja: what is 3@H by Suhas?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sarkar_suk: nw trump shift shd be :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: tightly contested semi final so far and I am sure it is going that way till the end |pg||
nt|rv: I might have bid 2n or 3@h with Sridhar's hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sga1: But trump shift can only help if N switches to @d after winning @sK|pg||
nt|sga1: so that 2nd trump can also be removed.|pg||
nt|panja: there was that other issue....did S show 5@S with this bidding? his next bid gives us the answer...NO|pg||
nt|panja: so 4@S, it will be...or will it go further?|pg||
nt|subhranp: could go higher|pg||
nt|panja: BTW Subhran, what is 2@D for you?|pg||
nt|panja: 12+?|pg||
nt|subhranp: this could prove costly for DSM|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rv: both 3n and 4@h have excellent play for N-S|pg||
nt|panja: I was wondering whey Keyzad bid 2@D rather than 2@S|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S would have shown 9-10 or so....|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chilloncan: S actually is not even minimum by Losing Trick Count standards, has playabiulity in at least 2 suits, only mild rebid problems, and can open the suit she wants led. all that adds ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: up to a clear opening bid|pg||
nt|panja: if they escape @H lead...@H can be thrown on Clubs|pg||
nt|panja: but @HJ is far more likely lead than any other card..|pg||
nt|figo: 3D must be D + Major|pg||
nt|panja: if so, Suhash should have rebid 3Nt|pg||
nt|figo: I am guessing|pg||
nt|panja: why 3@H? it must be part of some convention|pg||
pc|d7|nt|figo: 3H puppet of sorts ; then 3S /3NT show major may be |pg||
nt|panja: Pramod, can you tell us?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panja: if he guesses everything right, this could make|pg||
nt|panja: but that is rather unlikely|pg||
nt|panja: on the @CK lead...with correct @S view..there is a red suit squeeze on West|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes right panja..|pg||
nt|subhranp: one can trust keyzad to find those lines|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: play on deal 1 was lost due to some disterbunce sorry all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panja: Williaim Watson suggests that is the only option.....@CKQ must be in, W must hold 5 @D 4!M..so East must hold 4 Spades to make!|pg||
nt|panja: 5@H4@H, that is|pg||
nt|panja: Keyzad could conjure all that up..he is quite capable of thinking of a way to make this|pg||
nt|panja: and E's first @D will tell him W holds 5@D|pg||
nt|panja: and 3@H?|pg||
nt|panja: W does not need to know Major..|pg||
nt|figo: I was just guessing from the bids|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sga1: now -2|pg||
nt|panja: ok, thx|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rv: Sundarram is possibly abs minimum for his double and 2@h especially with modern style of O/Cs till 17/18 hcp|pg||
nt|subhranp: laltu not showing any kings so that should end the auction|pg||
nt|ayan: N-S play 2nt as Natural promising 2 + trump|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sarkar_suk: thats not good line i think sudhir :)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|sga1: yes|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: Sridhar took a very pessmistic view in my opinion|pg||
nt|subhranp: play should be very quick|pg||
nt|ayan: Kushari will play for the @s Q |pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: Suhas must have judged that either Clubs wont break of the second Major will be wide open|pg||
nt|panja: so 12 IMps back to Formidable|pg||
nt|figo: did u find out what was 3D/3H etc ?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h4|pg||

pc|d6|pc|c4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|alamiro: Ultima mano del torneo|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and the very predictable result of passing has in fact befallen S. big pickup, and a badly  needed one,  for the trailing team|pg||

nt|rv: Subhash Gupta is affectinately called Guruji (master) in Indian bridge circles:)|pg||
nt|rv: Guruji what would be your recommended auction in last deal?|pg||
nt|subhranp: well..i wouldnt bet against a DSM vs Form final now|pg||
nt|subhranp: form getting a few imps back on that one|pg||
nt|key1809: subhash thought it more important to show his 6s, rather than 4c dmd support|pg||
mb|1S|nt|subhranp: interesting board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ayan: Hi Subs, looks like we will have a full house pretty soon|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW have 5D|pg||
nt|figo: DSM in OR did very well to bid a grand |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sga1: it could be 2@h/3@H depending on whether NS would compete to 3@C or not.|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor sridhar already stretched his 5 points to make a noise|pg||
nt|subhranp: venky could have continue hearts there to put some more pressure|pg||
mb|3S|nt|subhranp: NS are odds on to make 4S here|pg||
nt|ayan: looks like 3 @c is rev bergen |pg||
nt|subhranp: well both Venky and Subhash quiet so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: ok back to this one, Kushari's 2n is jacoby, 4+@h, semibal hand, GF|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sarkar_suk: ofcourse no question of game reach :)|pg||
nt|subhranp: venky coming in aggressively here, finding the spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: 2NT here was natural, opening hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: i think the format of this event this time puts formidables at a bit of disadvantage to start with. they dont have time to settle down|pg||
nt|subhranp: quiet partial this time|pg||
nt|subhranp: 2nt also makes as cards are|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|sga1: not Jacoby which many prefer.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rv: Jacoby responses have been tailored a lot by different partnerships, traditionally 3 level bids show stiff and 4 level second 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ayan: Very unlike Guruzi Bid, I must admit|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|subhranp: kushari should find the heart lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: looks like Kushari-Laltu have their own home-grown method here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|subhranp: possibly the vulnerability made them keep quiet|pg||
nt|panja: not sure about 3@H..last hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: I read recently that it's right to rebid a 5 card major on these auctions on the grounds that pd may have 3.  I remain unconvinced.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|offthebend: sry -- I did miss -- PS was forced to bid 2D over the T/O dbl -- in that case , he could take one more bid -- like 2S  over 2H|pg||
nt|subhranp: assuming DSM goes through, they should look to capitalize on the initial rustiness (if any) of Formidables today|pg||
nt|ayan: now Venky may try for the @c J|pg||
nt|subhranp: trump back also should be ok here|pg||

nt|subhranp: good lead sets up heart winner for defence|pg||
nt|dslee: 2NT is a special bid here from Kushari which shows a speciality hand 14-15 points with 5-5|pg||
nt|dslee: 4@C from Laltu is a relay to know the other 5 cards|pg||

nt|sga1: Actually they can make this as well :)|pg||
nt|ayan: Both Sumit and Bhabesh are agressive bidders |pg||

nt|panja: and N could have led a trump...the auction kind of suggeted a trump lead..|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S for EW on B47|pg||
nt|dslee: should be a 4@S contract for DSM |pg||
mb|2N|nt|babs59: it was a good lead, but they all know each other's style and less likely to lead trump from the trump queen|pg||

nt|panja: 5@D for EW on B48|pg||
nt|panja: or close to 5@D..|pg||
nt|panja: there is a kind of twisted logic to this finesse|pg||
nt|panja: with the deficit....if you believe opps will be in 6@C|pg||
nt|panja: it might be a good strategy to play anti% and hope for a pick up|pg||
nt|panja: but Prabha bid 6@C with that idea in mind in the first place..|pg||
nt|panja: so this was testing one's luck and going too far for it|pg||
nt|panja: the % play with a 9-card fit..is to play for dropping the Queen|pg||
nt|figo: difficult to play if deficit governs both bidding and card play at this stage of the match ; quite a few boards yet to be played |pg||
nt|panja: true...but give credit to opps..they have forced this situation..|pg||
nt|panja: this is like having to score 15 per hour for last 6 overs..in an IPL match..you got to take chances, play anti%, whatever....|pg||

nt|subhranp: had 10 tricks, went for 11th and lost one wicket|pg||

nt|alok_daga: Sumit Bhabesh have played almost non stop over the last few days,a tremendous display of stamina|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: and will this be a routine 4@H for EW, B76, or will NS try their luck with Club preemption?|pg||

mb|d|nt|Rafa: East is Rosita Berdichevsky|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry for the belated commentary but i had to make a visit to the kitchen|pg||
nt|babs59: Roland is asleep Subs, no need for cricket analogies :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rv: Laltu has upgarded his hand though he has only 14 hcp, I might have stuck to 1@c opening|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt preempted NS out of a @H contract|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW should reach to 3n here|pg||
nt|panja: and 3Nt will go down on a @S lead..say @ST from South|pg||
mb|d|nt|babs59: though to me 'wicket' sounds more like the contract, 'run' sounds more like the overtrick|pg||
nt|panja: note the 3-card 1@S takeout...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|subhranp: dbl now from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: hi panja|pg||
nt|panja: W cannot pass for penalty..he is too weak for 1Nt...so 1@S is the best option...although he has only 3 Spades|pg||
nt|panja: hi Subhran|pg||
nt|panja: great point Arvind...that is why bridge is more difficult...|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: well not sure what dbl is from North hand here|pg||
nt|subhranp: balancing position can dbl in most conventions|pg||
nt|panja: risky for N to come in..@H Q lead requesting unblock of @HJ if N had it..|pg||
nt|panja: was 2Nt by North?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|alamiro: Ganan 5@h E-W |pg||
nt|sga1: Easy 11 tricks for NS|pg||
nt|offthebend: the upgrade here is not working well for laltu |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|rv: this will not be a success with all cards not lying well and could be many down|pg||
nt|ayan: yes, next time like IPL, we will hire Barbara for our selection trial|pg||
nt|subhranp: hit the right suit, H8 could have been much better|pg||
nt|santyclz: Didn't anticipate this contract...|pg||
nt|dslee: this is an interesting auction, Formi trying to pull back whatever they can |pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: looks like advance over overcall is forcing for NS..so 2@H was F1R..|pg||
nt|panja: but with bowlers mixing up speed these days, % element is playing a lot of part..|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: I think East has not taken best options here..|pg||
nt|panja: on 2@C....why not 2@H? or even 2@D  to hear partner's choice?|pg||
nt|figo: suprising dble by E with this shape |pg||
nt|panja: Suhas is under the impression E has 4 Spades..|pg||
nt|alok_daga: another xledigit 2 DSM|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|panja: holding @HJ..if N ducked it....he has to be very sure it won't hurt later|pg||
nt|subhranp: declarer could make this if he manages to ruff heart in dummy|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|subhranp: venky should have played on trumps|pg||
pc|d3|nt|panja: perhaps, a little less risky for South to come in even with his meagre 8 HCP hand....but there is risk in any intervention|pg||

nt|rv: Pramod, can we adjust the scores here even if we can't watch action on replayed brd?|pg||

nt|vugraphzvz: sure i shall put the score manually after the board 71 is over|pg||

nt|panja: W could hold @DKTx, for example|pg||
nt|subhranp: Form slowly narrowing the gap here|pg||
nt|panja: that wouls make 5@C impossible...and 4Major shaky|pg||
nt|panja: 6@C for EW?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cold as :)|pg||
nt|panja: will not be easy to bid though...|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes, requires both minors to break|pg||
nt|panja: let us see if @S shortness comes out soon enough|pg||
nt|sunit:  why should he be in a hurry to claim, 9 tricks possible|pg||
nt|sunit:  the way they are playing is a sign of giving up, not the best of practise|pg||
nt|panja: hi Sunit, all|pg||
nt|sunit:  hi panja, welcome|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no fight left dont think there would be a last segment here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi panja|pg||
nt|panja: hi Raju|pg||
nt|sunit:  i completely agree raju|pg||
nt|sunit:  i still feel kiran made a tactical blunder, she should have played Tewari and Prabhakar instead of Subash and Venky|pg||
nt|sunit:  in this session|pg||
nt|suketbombi: well sunit .......|pg||
nt|panja: if at all, it would have mattered if the scores were close|pg||
nt|sunit:  Since Subash and Venky have not been playing to their potential since yesterday|pg||
nt|suketbombi: my philosophy is to let the guys who have dropped go and play again (Tumi ne Dard diya hai tumi Dawa Dena)|pg||
nt|panja: 6@C or 6Nt for NS here...and 7@C/Nt if you wish to play for a swing.....not the underdog's deal, this one|pg||
nt|sunit:  actually u mean to say play again and that is your punishment, am i right raju??|pg||
nt|sunit:  in that case players like me will get to play the entire tournament!!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: looking at that W hand, it is not even automatic that 3S will make facing certain perfectly respectable 1S overcalls|pg||
nt|alamiro: Zona de grand slam para E-W|pg||
nt|panja: so..+450 instead of +500 because S took out 4@S dbl..and of course he did that because of the first 1@S dbl|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H for EW....tricky to bid..|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no i feel the law of average would catch up and they would recover given the normal conditions tho not here I guess|pg||
mb|1N|nt|offthebend: such hurriedly bid hands can cost 2 imps which mean a lot in such tight matches |pg||
nt|panja: interesting hand...11-card @H fit for NS, and 10-card @C fit for EW....but Total Tricks are much less than 21|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|alamiro: aunque con esta apertura muy dificil declararlo!|pg||
nt|subhranp: huu8[|pg||
nt|panja: @D 32 is sufficient I guess..@C41 can be handled|pg||
nt|figo: 54 diff now ; overnight it was 56|pg||
nt|sunit:  i need to play on a team with a captain like you|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|panja: 4@H cold for NS I guess...yet again 1Nt opening ahead of their turn|pg||
nt|panja: EW might make 9 tricks in Clubs, NS, 8 or 9 in Hearts|pg||
nt|suketbombi: you always show that Carrot :(:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: it nees 3-2 @H break..and a few positions in Clubs..|pg||
nt|panja: so just about 35-40%.....borderline bet at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|subhranp: i think they should bid these vul games|pg||
nt|panja: the trouble, for E, is 1@C is non-natural..just 3 cards..|pg||
nt|panja: to begin with..|pg||
nt|subhranp: sorry, yes you are right|pg||
nt|panja: so E does not know the fit yet...|pg||
nt|panja: She is likely to focus on @D...|pg||
nt|panja: the 2/1 freaks have this issue|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: slam this time for EW|pg||
nt|panja: EW are unlikely to venture into a game....because it is only a minor...and W has poor picture..but NS might want to try 4@H|pg||
nt|dslee: they surely wont, I am sure DSM will be playing more safe from here|pg||
nt|dslee: and probably they will follow the Bhikari sangh principle :)|pg||
nt|panja: her 2@C showed @D suit, didn't it?|pg||
nt|figo: lots of imps exchanged inbetween |pg||
nt|sunit:  on board 77 ashok passed over 1sp, so they played in 3cl for a 5imp pickup for dhampur|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rv: flat brd here, easy 3n, matter of OTs|pg||
nt|rv: South bid 3n and not East|pg||
nt|panja: dbl one suiter?|pg||
nt|panja: possibly, South has already overbid..2@S is a little too strong a bid for the 5332 hand......|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes|pg||
nt|panja: and W could likely sit for this?|pg||
nt|subhranp: i dont agree with the dbl|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panja: the @H suit is lost then..|pg||
nt|panja: what if W started with, say 3433? with KJx of Spades, say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: having shown @D suit could surely bid 4@C JUST in case pard actually has them?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rv: minimum and possibly max of 10 tricks for N-S|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|panja: 3@H will be unlucky to go down...but seems it will go down|pg||
nt|panja: this should be routine 3Nt|pg||
nt|sunit:  lol|pg||
mc|12|nt|panja: 1@S bid makes it slightly easier..|pg||
nt|dslee: well now no|pg||
nt|panja: oh well..on this lead, it will make|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 loser hand.  Doesn't seem worth a q.|pg||

mb|1D|nt|panja: and now I have to leave...thx Subhran, Pramod (great to have a top class bridge player to operate Vugraph) and all, bye|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sga1: This set DSM got 13 imps in 2 boards, many boards no swing.|pg||
nt|ayan: Both Laltu and Sumit are Kushari's student |pg||
mb|1N|nt|panja: 4@S for NS...|pg||

pc|c2|nt|sga1: heading for 3NT here.|pg||
nt|subhranp: this should be an easy 3n|pg||
nt|panja: much better to begin low.....except when your partner is known to be an ultraconservative player|pg||
nt|panja: isn't this worth 3Nt?|pg||
nt|panja: no...|pg||
nt|panja: not|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S? no, one short|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S is making in OR..could be tricky here|pg||
nt|panja: @C lead and return...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|panja: 4@H again..|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|alamiro: En este caso no deberia preocuparle decir 1@D inicialmente con su mano gf, podria luego hacer un reverse y mostraria de una manera mas adecuada su mano!|pg||
nt|alamiro: Afortunadamente East tiene 4 cartas en @ds |pg||
nt|ayan: Strange pass from Venky|pg||
nt|panja: EW have many tricks in Hearts.....|pg||
nt|panja: if E held three Aces and @SKx, but not the @HQ..prospects of a slam..|pg||
nt|subhranp: hopefully they will check for aces|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: many in India play X of strong nt opening as showing 5+m+4M, to be best of my knowledge this NS pair play double as values |pg||
nt|panja: which bid killed the exploration? 1Nt or W's Pass?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sga1: cold with good @C position.|pg||
nt|rv: PS had poor 16 hcp with no good lead and poor intermediates and wisely decided to pass|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW playing a bit of subdued game, they are still warming up..better get onto the pitch very fast|pg||
nt|panja: but they seem to have ended here by accident|pg||
nt|panja: Satya wants to explore that possibility...I am sure Kiran won't be interested|pg||
nt|subhranp: 4d might interest satya|pg||
nt|alok_daga: if 2nt showed minimum of the nt range a slam try seems optimistic|pg||
nt|kemperg: will loose 2@S then|pg||
nt|panja: that releases a trick for W's @S987 combination|pg||
nt|panja: the 1@D bid misguided everyone...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|figo: bridge partners and teamates need good chemistry ...... organic or inorganic|pg||
nt|panja: true...but you could also collect 6 protons and hope to keep them together and win..many seem to try that|pg||
nt|panja: and the positive charge almost always shows its force..|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|subhranp: this should make with cards favourably placed|pg||
nt|panja: with a 55 fit...to guard against !KQx in inside..declarer must finesse first time which Kushari will do by force of habit|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|chilloncan: excellent old-fashioned auction |pg||

pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|offthebend: find 3 heart tricks fast to hold to 8 tricks |pg||

pc|dT|nt|panja: KISS |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ayan: Looks like Subs is in IPL mood|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chilloncan: normally, though, one would respond in the suit that is both longest and strongest|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: with @CKQJxxx, S has to respond 1Nt..rather unnatural move..|pg||
nt|panja: Keep It Simple...|pg||
nt|panja: Subhash Gupta ducked @HA in the other room|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|offthebend: now 9 tricks |pg||
nt|panja: he will now wonder whether @S guess could be saved..|pg||
pc|sT|nt|panja: @HA, @C finesse, @CA, ruff, @D ruff and then @H|pg||
nt|ayan: Looks like Venky sacrified his ruff tricks |pg||
nt|panja: Venky rates @H to be with North...@D and @S bid...so Clubs...but surely, W would have bid Clubs if he had a good suit..he is rated to have about opening strength|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|subhranp: ??|pg||
pc|d5|nt|alamiro: agree|pg||
nt|panja: The two teams on view here are two of the top teams in India at present|pg||

mb|1D|nt|panja: I doubt..|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: 6NT by N|pg||

nt|chilloncan: spec suggests deal generator is programmed for goulasch|pg||
nt|panja: tricky for South..|pg||
nt|panja: he is likely to think he can defend 4@H..and that 5@D might not be a pucca proposition|pg||
nt|subhranp: subhash could have played second round of diamonds before playing clubs|pg||
nt|panja: 15 opposite 9...routine 3Nt if N begins 1N|pg||
nt|panja: routine @H partial in normal situations....NS might try a game here though|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rv: scores may not be right here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Like to stay out there|pg||
nt|panja: now, after 1Nt...N will raise..|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: deal 71 might need to manually corrected|pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt to show Club suit? |pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: many pairs play two way weak 2s -- 2M is close to an opening bid, and 2D is a truly weak 2 in one majopr|pg||
nt|alamiro: Cuando se abre de preventiva los valores deberian estar concentrados en el palo de apertura, tiene algunos extras laterales|pg||
nt|alamiro: supongo que 3@s es buen palo y buena mano|pg||
nt|alamiro: Norte debe rematar 6nt para proteger su K@d|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for me S has a 1H opener, but even without the 2-tiered weak 2s, there is an ultraconservative school of weak 2s that the S hand fits perfectlt. Matt Granovetter for example uses ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this style, which derives from the dawn of weak 2s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this looks like Ogust|pg||
nt|panja: Sorry missed the play of the last deal....|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: and 2Nt might be too high, even 1Nt might not make on a bad day|pg||
nt|panja: excellent lead..|pg||
nt|panja: notice the motivation..|pg||
nt|panja: and now 3@H showing shortness|pg||
nt|panja: so this should end in 3Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: he wants to shift after winning this one|pg||
nt|panja: and he will now shift to Clubs..|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Guruji will you bid 2@c or 2@S with North hand, I might have tried 2@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: QJ block @D make it a -10 for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: the @DA....improves the combination..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seen from N Y|pg||
nt|panja: change it to @SA in N hand..and there would have been more trouble|pg||
nt|rodal f: But @D could been 3-3|pg||
nt|panja: difficult lead problem..I guess small @H best choice|pg||
nt|subhranp: this would be interesting|pg||
nt|subhranp: kushari will signal clubs|pg||
nt|panja: interesting 3@S bid...can S rebid 3N now?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|panja: and @H Q could get played here..|pg||
nt|panja: because S wants to tackle @D asap|pg||
nt|panja: this is a tricky situation...N is thinking about 44 fit..S, about @H check...|pg||
nt|panja: exchange South's @CA for @DA...and you will see why 3Nt could be a problem...|pg||
nt|dslee: :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|alamiro: En mi opinion si voy abrir 1 mano de 11 ptos a nivel de 1, es porque tengo un 2do canto sin ninguna dificultad, en este caso Sur pudo abrir de 1@h y luego rematar 2@h y problema ...|pg||
nt|alamiro: resuelto, mano totalmente descrita!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chilloncan: very surprising for N to pass after a 3S reply to Ogust showing super maximum|pg||
nt|alamiro: Ahora pueden ganar 7 si encuentra la Q@C|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe N should have only invited once 2@h was doubled|pg||
nt|panja: W might shift..|pg||
nt|subhranp: on a club lead, N should win with CK|pg||
nt|panja: @C lead? I think with long trump..best bet|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|offthebend: hard to say --- rather play in 6-1 than 4-3 fit with such hands |pg||
nt|panja: he knows @HA is with S, he has heard 1@H bid..he won't take a chance on @H9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am not shure if that was at the hurry|pg||
nt|panja: that is why none of NS want to settle in 3Nt|pg||
nt|panja: 3@C as in Ogust?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|panja: no way to make now..|pg||
nt|dslee: deal 50 tewari lead a @H|pg||
nt|panja: The Spade suit undisclosed...so that makes Declarer's job easier|pg||
nt|panja: that allows all @H to come in with @H9 pinning|pg||
nt|kemperg: something like bad suit, bad hand?|pg||
nt|panja: run @S9 now..this is hopeless as the cards lie..but who know, if E does not defend carefully...it could make|pg||
nt|figo: and still 4S ? looks like he always wanted to bid it :)|pg||
nt|panja: Pramod, what did 3@C show?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|dslee: 4@D was slam indication|pg||

nt|dslee: again a loss for formidables|pg||

pc|c7|nt|kemperg: S could not stay out of game|pg||
nt|figo: kibs who are recently taught weaks 2s may wonder why 2S here |pg||
nt|panja: This could be the last session if Formidables concede..|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|ayan: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|panja: he cannot ruff three cards in Dummy, so needs to get @H ruffs going soon|pg||
nt|panja: or..run the @S9|pg||
nt|panja: @SAK will not do..I guess|pg||
nt|panja: are you sure about that slam invitation?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|panja: it is a toss up between @ST, and @H9...|pg||
nt|panja: if S had later..@SQ shift would have worked better|pg||
nt|subhranp: heart shift was right even if N had H9 doubleton|pg||
nt|panja: oh..I forgot N is the Declarer..|pg||
nt|panja: right..@H continuation is right...because @ST is seen in the dummy|pg||
nt|subhranp: should be -1|pg||
nt|subhranp: defence should look to get their 4 tricks in red-suits|pg||
nt|subhranp: venkatesh not sure if Keyzad has HA or not and might be considering knocking out HA if Kushari has it|pg||
nt|panja: and what if North started with nothing in Spades? or just one control?|pg||
nt|panja: hereafter, all the initial moves and many final choices of NS will be somewhat anti%....and hopeful|pg||

nt|subhranp: yes good defence here by Laltu|pg||

nt|panja: 16 opp 13 HCP...|pg||
nt|panja: slam will make because @S are 33, Club honours divided..|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@H from senior can be interpreted in two ways: if you have a @H stopper, bid 3NT , or I have absolute @C with a cue bid, I think the latter wsa true|pg||
nt|dslee: might be Dhadi should had bid 3NT and closed|pg||
nt|panja: slam on one of two finesses...|pg||

nt|subhranp: tough to reach those|pg||
nt|panja: Prabhakar took the @H finesse using @DA entry..and then it worked..simply banged @SA to make 13 tricks..|pg||
mb|2H|nt|alamiro: 2nt es menores!|pg||
nt|figo: match slipping away from  Formidables ?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: but u get ten tricks without the squeeze|pg||
mb|2N|nt|alamiro: no 5@C por East en serio?|pg||
nt|subhranp: while DSM have played very well, the resounding win here has also been due to some below par performance from Texans in the last 3 sets|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt will be the the normal spot though|pg||
nt|panja: 2@D opening by S helped them find the spot, no doubt|pg||
mb|3H|nt|panja: I don't know their methods..but 3@H looked like short suit...and later a doubt was natural..as I explained...so I am not sure N really was angling for a slam...but I don't know ...|pg||
nt|panja: their methods...so IMHO..|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 tricks, where is the 9th|pg||

mb|p|nt|offthebend: I agree that still more than 2 sessions to go --- but momentum seems to be in DSM's favour right now |pg||
nt|rv: what would X be from SS in bal seat, does it shows minors or values with some @s length?|pg||
nt|panja: this will be touch and go 3Nt..|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: @H lead?|pg||

pc|c6|nt|panja: this isn't going too well here I am afraid|pg||
nt|alok_daga: will laltu proceed?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|panja: no point in leading @D, North's first bid suit..|pg||
nt|panja: right, no 9th trick in normal situations...|pg||
nt|panja: 9 tricks in 3@C counting 2 in Hearts...|pg||
nt|panja: W is likely to lead @HJ|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: this was a 3@S partial for EW..1Nt opening seems to have stolen that|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|panja: I don't know why N went through Stayman|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: drury should be reanamed dreary|pg||
nt|suketbombi: not of any interest for any of them there|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|subhranp: this lead might just sell the contract|pg||
nt|panja: @H is better than Spades..because E knows W has 4+ Hearts|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: with my regular partner, I play this X as t/o showing minors, PS-SS prefer to play it as bal 10 hcp with @S length/card|pg||
nt|offthebend: sadly not too many people compete with minors after a NT O/call|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|offthebend: I must be seeing things -- I thought there was a NT O/call somewhere and SS had both minors :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|panja: but 1Nt will go down some|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chilloncan: i would indeed bid 5C, but E is hoping for a defeat of 4H|pg||
nt|panja: @C switch, I would think now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|subhranp: any reason to lead diamonds here panja?|pg||
nt|panja: in the OR, S rebid 3@S...to leave some space for exploration....but 4@S doesn't seem to have deterred them here..|pg||
nt|panja: @H finesse is needed anyway....so N has to think of a way to try both Major suit finesses..|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rv: only 7 tricks for Kushari here, still might pick up a swing if Sumit-Bhabesh bid upto 3@c|pg||
pc|h6|nt|subhranp: heart shift could have been better|pg||
nt|panja: look out for @H signal from E|pg||
nt|dslee: 1NT is not a comfortable auction to be in - |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ayan: To find out if S has a 5 card M|pg||
nt|panja: high @D will show @H?|pg||
nt|panja: and now, it should be @H first..|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panja: I can't see a very strong one|pg||
nt|subhranp: D5 a vital card here|pg||
nt|subhranp: looks like some misunderstanding on B22 between prabh-tewary|pg||
nt|panja: @D switch was cheeky...too smart perhaps|pg||
nt|panja: B22, I think Nandu revaluated his hand brilliantly...|pg||
nt|dslee: pich low @H|pg||
nt|panja: small @H shows @H...|pg||
nt|panja: direct approach|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|panja: Nandu is the nickname of Kushari.......|pg||
nt|suketbombi: would you advice them to concede or fight for another set? panja? Sunit?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dslee: udca carding and discards I think for whole of the field|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|babs59: but equally he's curious to see who his opposition will be in 2 days time|pg||
nt|offthebend: for NS to find C fit , SS could have doubled 2S --- as a T/O for minors and he had a good enough hand to do it |pg||
nt|panja: and a mentor of many members of his team here..|pg||
nt|subhranp: that will be last trick for defence|pg||

mb|2S|nt|subhranp: they may settle for 400|pg||
nt|panja: this will not be easy|pg||
nt|panja: 8 clear tricks for N|pg||
nt|panja: on B51...Sumit opened 3@C light as in this room, but did not drop partner's forcing 3@S bid like a hot cake|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Kushari retired from Indian Railways a couple of years ago...an organisation that employed and encouraged dozen+ bridge players..and ruled Indian bridge almost for a decade|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Rafa: El equipo Severin se tituló campeón, 2do Alti, el 3er puesto no ha terminado|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 2 Spades, 4 Hearts, two Diamonds..|pg||
nt|panja: but Indian boundaries was the limit of their support.......that is why they did not participate too often as Railway on the international stage..|pg||
nt|panja: Kushari passed whereas Tewari bid 2Nt in this sequence...a bit of a stretch, 2Nt seems to be.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|offthebend: PS may be regretting his opening NOW |pg||
nt|babs59: seems perfectly respectable to me though|pg||
nt|rv: SS might pass this and they might be just about ok|pg||
nt|subhranp: this is another potential swing board for Texans|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5 aces the problem here|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|subhranp: declarer will have to endplay venky in diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|panja: ninth can come from some kind of endplay...but it won't be easy to figure out single Dummy|pg||
nt|viren169: fortunately 6@h also makes here... but they should come to rest in 6@d|pg||
nt|panja: this will be interesting play..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chilloncan: diamonds likely to be 22 after non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|offthebend: Not going to be a success here for texan |pg||
nt|offthebend: when he takes the D finesse ( from the bidding ) -- the roof will cave in |pg||
pc|d3|nt|panja: meanwhile, on to present biddng...|pg||

nt|panja: bidding even|pg||
nt|subhranp: i think this DSM team has many members of Indian Railways|pg||
nt|panja: note the raise to 2@H..with 3 cards...and the 2@S continuation to force..all good choices IMHO|pg||
nt|subhranp: well bid, clinically reached there|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panja: this is more likely to fail rather than make|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|subhranp: pramod indicating 4 members of DSM part of Indian Railways. So this team is re-incarnation of Indian Railways|pg||
nt|panja: true..|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panja: looks like a misunderstanding..|pg||
nt|viren169: Need some sponsor(s) to take the Indian team(s) onto the world stage!|pg||
nt|panja: and disc a @C on third|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|babs59: only went -2 in OR with D finesse.   but here Sunderram seems not to be taking that line|pg||
nt|rv: SS might have chanced 3n because he felt they were trailing and need IMPs|pg||
nt|babs59: and now he has real prospects!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ayan: Laultu will perhaps end play with the 12th @d |pg||
nt|panja: small @S would be a good shift|pg||
nt|alok_daga: y wud work like a charm|pg||
nt|panja: @SK allows N to win @SA and enjoy @H ruff..small @S doesn't allow him that liberty|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dslee: 52 n 53 will also be DSM pickups|pg||
nt|panja: has Ashok Goel played two sessions? or one?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|offthebend: Laltu in a hurry -- the Club suit may play for few more tricks |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|babs59: not enough entries to establish clubs now|pg||
nt|panja: Did S come to know N's 15 HCP?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|panja: y, !AK and then a @D|pg||
nt|panja: but there are many other possibilities|pg||
nt|panja: now...E needs to ruff with @SQ..and then get her @C ruff I guess|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|babs59: so he had to try for 3-2 break|pg||
nt|panja: are there any rules about minimum boards to be played by everyone?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|psyck: Landy for both majors is commonly employed on 1NT openings, some use it in this sequence with agreement|pg||
nt|panja: he might just play a @C to King|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|panja: and what happens in case a match is conceded?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :):) yes they have played their quota and have earned their Imps while doing so|pg||
nt|panja: I mean....if the match can be conceded withouth affecting anyone's chance..time to concede|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chilloncan: i wonder why N led the club ace|pg||

pc|c4|nt|panja: forced endplay now|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|babs59: he didn't have 3 clubs tricks if they broke 4-1 though.|pg||

nt|panja: tricky...looks like NS will run away with this game|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: 2@D es apoyo 4to a @s y 10-11 ptos|pg||
nt|rv: another flat brd, good for the side in the lead|pg||
nt|panja: NS can make 3@C...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|panja: will go 2 down|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H is cold, so is 4@S|pg||
nt|dslee: shd be a good formi score, EW has a cold 5@H and this lead is friendly too|pg||
nt|panja: EW cannot make 3@D on @H ruff..|pg||
nt|panja: one of those hands where you have to bid 4@H even if you suspect it might go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: that 1@S, that is|pg||
nt|panja: but @SK needs to be dropped..is that likely?|pg||
nt|dslee: not sure if senior would had taken the @C this way, he had a guess - even now, he has a guess in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Is the non-@h honor lead enough of a clue to drop the @sk?|pg||
nt|kemperg: specs think 5@H better then 4NT on previous hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: this should be cold 4@H..will S ruff @C or @S?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chilloncan: N was worth a raise to 3S after the 4 card drury|pg||
nt|panja: or both?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|subhranp: meanwhile DSM have increased their lead thanks to the twin blunders on both tables by Form|pg||
nt|panja: 13 even|pg||
nt|viren169: obvious Spade or Diamond lead ahead of the club.|pg||
nt|panja: because two Spades can be ruffed now...|pg||
nt|viren169: but may choose a @C in a slam!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|panja: of course, with top class opponents, you expect them to cash their winners ..|pg||
nt|sunit:  i am not sure 4h is a good bid, 5/4/2/2 opp a preemptive raise, dia q worthless|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they have to cash 4 tricks first|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|chilloncan: her partner was 3rd seat, yes, but vulnerable, and N has clearly invitational values|pg||
nt|rv: 3@d shows 5+@hs|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|panja: @DQ, @SA ruff, @H, @S ruff..Trumps, Diamonds|pg||
nt|sunit:  yes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: I'm just ruffed by my nice lady.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|subhranp: should be down on passive def|pg||
nt|dslee: thats what makes him Senior or Guruji as we lovingly call him in the circuit|pg||
nt|sunit:  difficult defense, i must say|pg||
pc|hT|nt|suketbombi: gone|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|panja: NS started with too many @H rounds..N could have pushed @D early instead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Answer cometh there - Yes.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|psyck: aambitious to bid on after 4@s|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sarkar_suk: :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: cards lay fine here, but once E denied interest after the superacceptance with 4@d...there was no clear reason to crossss 4@s...|pg||
nt|rv: all bids on 1x-1y-2n are transfers (3@s shows @Cs playable upto 5@c)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@SX-2 and 8IMP|pg||
nt|panja: both, it looks like|pg||
pc|hK|nt|subhranp: this is giving chance to declarer now|pg||
nt|panja: He didn't opt for that play..lost a trick there I think|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rv: very popular treatment played by many partnerships in this part of the world|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sunit:  i think there is a scoring error on board 95, kushari had gone 1 down in 3h, entered as 2 down -200|pg||
mc|10|nt|suketbombi: may be subhash ducked the @S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: on bd 95|pg||
nt|sunit:  but the play shows spade king won |pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|rv: it might be cancelled if Formidables concede or start a bit earlier if both captains and organizers agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunit:  i just heard from pramod that if the lead is over 100 they might concede, even if they it wont be covered on bbo|pg||
nt|rv: many players have booked tickets in late evening flights, Bangalore airport is very far from city, will take time in evening traffic|pg||
nt|sunit:  even if they dont concede no coverage on bbo for the last session|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|suketbombi: ok|pg||

nt|alamiro: 6@D para N-S?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if they lead a club you might as well play 7D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 5 or 7 hand|pg||
nt|rv: other table nearly completed, Sumit and Anil are very fast players|pg||
nt|subhranp: NS close to 3n here|pg||
nt|subhranp: last board coming up..should be an easy 3n for EW|pg||
nt|viren169: another slam here|pg||
nt|panja: 6Nt good here...|pg||
nt|dslee: had suket been around, you would have heard another terminilogy called the bhosale lead - am sure few of it knows the meaning of that :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'll bet west isn't feeling particularly loving at the moment.|pg||
nt|panja: last board of S7 coming up..and could well turn out to be the last played board of this trial|pg||
mb|1C|nt|babs59: last board of the day|pg||
nt|rodal f: An interesting one seen from the specs side. Defence and end|pg||
mb|p|nt|alok_daga: these 4IMPS,2IMPS can prove 2 be costly in a tight match|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: I doubt this will end up in a game|pg||
nt|panja: what is Bhosale lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: sorry I got the tables wrong, this table has finished earlier|pg||
nt|kemperg: lots of remarks from people of India, much more then I'm used to in Europe|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes either that is the mistake or the score pramod Please clarify|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rv: Barbara is right|pg||
nt|kemperg: I like that:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: but RV, I said that privately :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: open room is playing slow bec of some lighting problems |pg||
nt|rv: thanks to my excellent commentators, Guruji Subhash Gupta and Barbara and insightful comments by all specs|pg||
nt|babs59: and this board doesn't look like Texans can recover IMPs|pg||
nt|subhranp: i guess 2c is other two suits|pg||
nt|subhranp: last board of SF coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4Nt next?|pg||
nt|dslee: Bhosale is a singleton lead, rev Bhosale lead is a lead through which you try and find our ptr's singleton|pg||
nt|panja: EW are likely to overreach on this one|pg||
nt|dslee: your ptr singleton I meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: you'd better not play in the Open Room then Subhash :)|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@s most likely|pg||
nt|panja: my impression is that DSM have displayed their consistency and superiority througout this match...and their bidding and play has been high class in both the KO matches of this ...|pg||
nt|panja: trial|pg||
pc|c4|nt|babs59: you've mis-seen a few bids tonight!|pg||
nt|subhranp: well played DSM|pg||
nt|subhranp: finals starting tomorrow at 9:30 AM IST|pg||
nt|dslee: likely 3NT bid panja from laltu?|pg||
nt|panja: W should devalue his hand holding two loose Jacks..and not accept any invitation|pg||
nt|panja: and on B70 with 24 HCP combined holding , but rather an indifferent one, NS ventured into 6@S in OR..|pg||
nt|alok_daga: another 13 to DSM|pg||
nt|panja: well...I must correct that....6@S has a good % on paper..|pg||
nt|alok_daga: SRRY 11|pg||
mc|9|nt|panja: NS will do well to take out trumps|pg||
nt|subhranp: one spade can be ruffed in dummy and should make|pg||
nt|viren169: no reason for either player to suggest nt|pg||
nt|panja: Kushari does well to disregard the 1@C opening that looks like it was a minor psyche|pg||
nt|panja: thx Sunit, Raju, Pramod, all, will we know the decision now?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Thx Panja Sunit Pramod & Buddy|pg||
nt|sunit:  Thanks to Buddy, Pramod Samant, my fellow commentators, Rajuji and Prakash Paranjpe, BBO and all the wonderful kibitzers for their patience|pg||
nt|panja: bye|pg||
