mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: North must have misunderstood 2NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Seems to be a bidding misunderstanding at the other table, otherwise 3@C is hard to understand.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: 3NT clear now|pg||
nt|chilloncan: some might double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double would not cross my mind|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kemperg: all's possible|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: you are not "some" |pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT is the most likely game and only you can bid it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The best you can say about 3NT is that it's not doubled|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chilloncan: some pressure can be exerted on W i think, but still nine tricks seem a bit past horizon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It won't go 4 down, though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a nice hand to play. Win, cross to dummy with a club and take a diamond finesse looks pretty normal|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: Declarer is unlikely to make it unless he can score 5 diamond tricks. He would not be allowed to endplay West to give the dummy two spades.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i don;t think EW can stop dummy from making 2 spades, can they?|pg||
nt|kemperg: w endplayed:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No need to hold up any more. West can't have more hearts|pg||
nt|chilloncan: no, but holding up forcies more discards|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and risks a shift he may not like|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not know about declarer's diamonds, of course.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chilloncan: but i suppose it could be right to let E win only one trick, planning to lose several to W|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|brolucius: West is more worried about the spades (which he can see) than the diamonds.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clever move after all, it already made West pitch one of his diamonds|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: 3@C corrected to down 3 now. Did they negotiate?|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever of West to play a spade. He cannot imagine declarer will finesse while there is still a chance of the diamonds coming in. But he has finessed!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not sure it is best to burn the club entries so early. W is a favorite to have D king for several reasons. there is a fair case for leading D queen from hand  -- i think it is ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: worth the minor risk of E having it after all, in order to preserve options for later|pg||

mb|d|nt|woozle: 4H is fair (but down)...vulnerable I'd definitely want to be there|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen might very reasonably drive to game here, particularly considering the hands that this pair haven't overcalled|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now what?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be played doubled? |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: source of tricks very scarc e here|pg||

nt|Vugraphzcp: down 2|pg||
nt|kemperg: more to follow, computer give nice distributions|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|2C|an|!d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 7@D is a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is a transfer response. Very useful, because you have the chance on some deals of stopping in 2@D.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East is much too strong to bid 2@D, of course.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because West's diamonds are this good. Still, good effort to get to 6|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East can see the chance of a slam if West's diamonds are good (by establishing the clubs for several tricks).|pg||
nt|kemperg: to see bidding in CR hover over the contract with your mouse|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has to decide whether he should go past 3NT. But 5@D is probably OK, if they decide not to bid a slam (from his point of view).|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Just as well Kowalski did not pass 3@C. He was pretty close to doing that I am told by a reliable source. He had the pass card in his hand first|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5NT bid in CR was perhaps a grandslam try?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|chilloncan: surely E can cunt on W fopr good diamonds after the 3D call. that could hardly be more than one loser in the suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C showed diamonds already|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems unlikely that E/W do not know if 3@C is forcing, however reliable your source.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes i had already been wondering if 3C was forcing, and if not why E bid it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 3@D more diamonds, so yes, he has more than 4 babies|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@C ??|pg||
nt|kemperg: don't have their CC|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S keeps the bidding below 3NT, giving partner one more chance to bid that.|pg||
mb|r|nt|Walddk2: I found the EW CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/SeniorTeams/poland/kowalski-ramanski.pdf|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||

nt|brolucius: North and South will show them how diamond slams ought to be bid...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In the days of regular Blackwood you might be able to bid the grand slam, but not today when 'everyone' uses Roman Keycard Blackwood|pg||
mb|2D!|an|4!H|nt|chilloncan: this one is easier i think|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: when in Rome....and Roman is part of his name too.....any other method would be unthinkable:)|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: RKC will discover that N-S are off 1 keycard for diamonds and then they will stop in 6@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: 'Ski' is part of his name too. That is why they slipped up on that slam.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kemperg: 2@C 18-19 bal|pg||
mb|4H|an|2 aces|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Bocchi has shown exactly 4 hearts and longer diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's no lie|pg||
nt|brolucius: Awkward if a slow 5@D now.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: presumably S unambiguously cuebidding for Ds, as he did not show interest in hearts earlier|pg||
nt|brolucius: South is still pretty good opposite 4-6 shape in the reds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He knows that North must hold at least one black singleton (or void) and has chosen not to show it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North's shape is commonly known as the 'perfume shape'. Some of you may be able to figure out why|pg||
nt|chilloncan: seems odd for N to  d 5D with an extra trump and controls in all suits|pg||
nt|brolucius: Cologne.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|woozle: This time EW might reasonably attempt 5D|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen's 2D overcall a little ugly with only a five card suit, but the excellent hand and unsuitability of every other call justify it|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie, unfortunately, doesn't know what a vul v not 2-level overcall looks like|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd sooner bid 5D than pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Povl Sommer|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @S |pg||
nt|sommer: ..and they should be there|pg||
mb|4H|nt|woozle: Buchen steps out a little with a reopening double, diagnosing the short hearts opposite. Christie still thinks that he has a balanced yarborough and just returns to diamonds|pg||

nt|ianmcc: this 4@s could make needs W to break @d?|pg||
nt|woozle: EW can put on some pressure by bidding to 5C here, which needs hearts led at trick one or two to beat it|pg||

mb|2D|nt|woozle: With +600/620 or -100 as the options, I'd much rather be playing than defending|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice to be spectating this one|pg||

nt|chilloncan: well, if he knew that N had taken 2 vulnerable calls facing a silent partner against 2 bidding opponents with zero defense in his hand, he might have. but sometimes partners who ...|pg||

nt|jcomyn: and another s game|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|woozle: EW might try a beatable 4H here|pg||
nt|sommer: we have had BIG cards this session|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4-nil breaks are a pest|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: or is it pests|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: very beatable|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|woozle: although the auction will tip declarer off that he should start spades from dummy|pg||
nt|ianmcc: too much in oppo suits|pg||
nt|woozle: The values are poorly located (NS have too many)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: doing well for 140|pg||
nt|woozle: Buchen's 2NT is a thoughtful effort, although if I were to reach 3NT with this hand I'd rather be dummy (a try like 2S might achieve that)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sommer: doesnt matter much in this case, I guess..they are off 2 aces and rest in 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|ianmcc: 2@s show or ask?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..making 11 even with the plague:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|woozle: some kind of length try|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie might push harder for game if vulnerable|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|woozle: This should score 140, maybe 170 on soft defense|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: my tip is@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Certainly, when your partner, marked with all of the values, didn't overcall over 1C, the only good suit he can have is clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|woozle: Thoughtful lead, but it leaves the result in limbo for the moment. Still probably down|pg||
