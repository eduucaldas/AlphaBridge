nt|pelu: just a joke - u look like 45 :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i don't think you want to be there|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp 3Nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: north perhaps hoping to trap west here|pg||
nt|hawe45: @H-quess is not avoidable, so the rest is "easy". But do we count 12 tricks then?|pg||
nt|pelu: would u overcall 2@S . not me and not Hans - for sure|pg||
nt|hawe45: Never - for me it shows a @S-suit - and where is East´s SUIT?|pg||
nt|pelu: prob S reopen with D - and N? Pass?|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@sx wont be a disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And we don't like to go for 1100|pg||
nt|mrdct: only 300 i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 300?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hawe45: Might be 500|pg||
nt|pelu: no 500|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: yeah - the defence are destined to score 4 trumps|pg||

nt|hawe45: As you know my age allready, I must admit: This is NO 1 @S vulnerable with a rather weak suit...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrdct: 3NT looks to have 8 tricks - can a 9th be scrounged anywhere?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: Maria Dam Mortensen - Matias Rohrberg|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now 9 easy tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||

nt|hawe45: This was a blind spot, with the 9 - or 10 - of @C dropping from West, you just must play on|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Crocodile Coup!|pg||

nt|pelu: can u tell me: will all results count for nordic or only the results against U-25 teams?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT made at one table, went down at the other on board 2|pg||
mb|4C|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Only against the other U25 teams|pg||
nt|mrdct: can pick up the @d suit for no losers|pg||
nt|pelu: so the "real standing is: NO 36, SW 34, DEN 32|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pre-empting the opponents into game|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: Well, there's two tournaments|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also bid 4@C, mind you|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @C was no pre-empt - 5 @C would (should) have been|pg||
nt|mrdct: one of those rare profitable vul vs non-vul saves|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: In the main one, all results count|pg||

pc|sA|nt|hawe45: WHAT a lead|pg||

nt|hawe45: Ruffing with teh 8 - and not the King - to give West a short-lasting hope...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't imagine that Fagerlund will go for the drop in diamonds. That would be against the odds by a margin|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|hawe45: 9th trick in 3 NT on the @S-lead - lead the other black suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT could be beaten here if the defence bag 4@c tricks and then sit back for an inevitable setting trick|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45: Passing over the Double is not at all excluded - or?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leading a club from that West holding is not realistic|pg||
nt|mrdct: the @s raise greatly increases the likelihood of a @s lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It will be a spade for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: normal bid and @s normal lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: It would not be bridge to lead anything but a spade|pg||
nt|mrdct: 100% cold now|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although 11,912 BBO users would not lead a spade, of course|pg||
nt|mrdct: i wonder if he'll fiddle around in @h to try to make an overtrick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No further comment|pg||

nt|hawe45: One down in a moment|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: oh no|pg||
nt|mrdct: this seems quite high risk|pg||
nt|hawe45: I bet, he is down |pg||
nt|pelu: but can East se the @C shift - I doubt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He forgot to count his tricks|pg||
nt|mrdct: will east be up for flying @HQ AND switching to low @c?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|mrdct: he's probably counting his tricks now and feeling a bit ill|pg||

nt|mrdct: EW found a good save in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: even though I'm sure Dennis saw it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good result for Finland next door. 6@S is makeable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Again a passive Danish pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Selling out to 5@C with a double fit|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C X and 5@C by East?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: South is not going to pass that|pg||
mb|5S|nt|pelu: who i playing in CR for Denmark?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maria and Matias|pg||
nt|hawe45: Look higher, peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: at least EW have succeeded here in taking up the space NS needed to make a slam try|pg||
nt|pelu: I just look down :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: I agree with 2@s rather than double from north|pg||
nt|hawe45: So does our team at the moment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a feeling that North doubled 2@C in the other room and than had to settle for 5@CX later|pg||
nt|pelu: @H-lead will defeat 6@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: north having a good think about it|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: could be east|pg||
nt|mrdct: and generally the longer they think the more likely they are to bid|pg||
nt|hawe45: Bidding 6 for one down is 200 % BAD LUCK|pg||
nt|pelu: but X 5@C - P - P D still take out|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: I'm on the S/W side of the screen|pg||
nt|mrdct: ah i see - i usually straddle the screen when operating|pg||
nt|pelu: so 6@C and P from S? - could tempt N to bid 6@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is Peter, but how else can you explain that they decided to defend?|pg||
nt|hawe45: If I had no 6 @S in the box, I woukd as North bid 7 - rather than stay in 5...|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: yeah, that's what I've done before as well, but this seems better, actually|pg||
nt|pelu: I cant explain :):)|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@C from Dennis will almost win the board - keep the lost to 5 IMP or gain 7|pg||
nt|mrdct: you seem very sure that west will find the @h lead PO|pg||
nt|hawe45: East is on lead...|pg||
nt|pelu: East to lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think Fagerlund is thinking. He passed some time ago is my guess|pg||
nt|mrdct: ah so he is :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: BIlde thinking of saving|pg||
nt|Walddk2: either against 5 or 6@S, that we don't know|pg||
nt|mrdct: the tension is killing me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fact, we know nothing :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Merely speculating|pg||
nt|pelu: we have not been impressed by the results from CR - but ontil now Maria-Mathias has beenthe best danish pair: Multi-score 18,79 - No 2. over all, Dennis Emil 17,50 and Niclas-Lars ...|pg||
nt|pelu: 16,29|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: especially me - i don't even know who's on lead vs n@s|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: South making a forcing pass, showing 1st round club control|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzcv: But in this very mixed field, the multi can be misleading|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: why only down 1 in 5@cX?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must have set up the diamonds for a spade discard|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: I see - now :(|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||

nt|vugraphzcv: lucky that they are playing strong nts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agree, no one rebids those clubs, surely, not even Peter|pg||
nt|mrdct: nowhere near reversing values and can't rebid xxxxx|pg||
nt|hawe45: But E/W here would (both) rebid the @C-suit...! (You got it?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: if they play check back then 2@H is the weak bid - max 3@H by N|pg||
nt|mrdct: now north sits up in his chair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My guess is that Maria also rebid 1NT and that Matias invited game with 5-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C  2@D  ;  3@H  4@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: if 2@h shows less than invitational values it seems a bit of an underbid with 5-5 in the Majors and a void|pg||
nt|pelu: the normal danish style here is that 2@D = GF, 2@C relay to 2@D and next bid invit|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|hawe45: North shall bid on, because South counts of lost @C.values in North, which is not so...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: And a very good morning to Brit Johansen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Denmark slight favourites I would say, as Sweden has a very tough match against Norway U25|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW might get to a practical 3NT contract after this start|pg||
nt|hawe45: Please Roland - put the runniing score from N-S into the left corner of the screen... |pg||
nt|hawe45: Norway-Sweden, not N/S|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: although a possibiloity to miss game if west overcalls 2@h|pg||
nt|hawe45: 1 @S D is no pleasure - for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The software does not allow that, but Walddk3 and 5 are there, so I'll keep you posted|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|hawe45: The @H-suit is too bad and too short for an overcall|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|hawe45: Thanks to Roland - I knew, he would fix it |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mrdct: but good enough to introduce at the 3-level|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|hawe45: Dennis Bilde will receive a mail from me. If THAST is not e forcing pass to 1 @S, I have never seen such a hand|pg||
nt|hawe45: THAT|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: easy enough to come to 2@s, 1@h, 2@d and 4@c|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrdct: perhaps 3@s for an overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: Can be tricky to get to the last club|pg||
nt|mrdct: he does have some commination problems though|pg||
nt|hawe45: 600 are easy - but in 1 S D you are close to 2 x 600|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||

nt|Walddk2: There ought to be a law against playing serious bridge at 8:30 on a Sunday morning|pg||
nt|hawe45: This should bring 4 @S one down at both tables|pg||
nt|mrdct: so 3@s the limit here in theory|pg||
nt|hawe45: In german they call it "Mitten in der Nacht..."|pg||
nt|mrdct: but the defence need to be sharp as switching to @c won't be an attractive option for east when he wins the @hA|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|hawe45: But I have seen better 18 HCP-hands than this North-hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: a free bid of 3@s here will surely get raised to 4@s|pg||
nt|hawe45: Maybe we play 3 @C now|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hawe45: - or 4|pg||
nt|mrdct: nice obstructive 4@c bid by west|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mrdct: and north gets cornered into treating himself as a GF|pg||
nt|mrdct: which is a slight overbid imho|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hawe45: Defence against 4 @C D is not so easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: @CQJ aren't great and if partner had anything decent with a 4 card Major he would've done something over 3@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|hawe45: Agree - second Double showed the same as the first Double|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mrdct: of course with the auction there is very little chance of the defence not getting their cashing @c tricks and then the other 2 defensive tricks will be automatic for -1|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
