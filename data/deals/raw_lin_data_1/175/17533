nt|sga1: Four session to go, only 8 imps difference, any thing possible.|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari should have exited with @ck on winning @SK in last deal, SS was one 1 down|pg||
nt|rv: all 3 teams in the trials are fairly evenly matched though Formidables have the best form in recent months, I anticipate semis and finals to be very close and go down to the wire|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables have been seeded to finals because they won 2 of the 3main qualifying events for the trials, both Summer and Winter Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: Texans won 3rd qualifying event National Masters with very different quorum of team, hence had to pay 5 lacks as direct entry to participate here|pg||
nt|rv: DSM qualified as runner-up of Summer Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: runner-up of Winter Nationals, Poddar Developers did not field team here because of some internal issues, very sad indeed|pg||
nt|rv: 5 lacks translates to 0.5 million rupees, about 10,000 USD:)|pg||
nt|rv: as per current exchange rate approx 11,000 USD|pg||
nt|rv: we have power failure at the venue, lost internet connectivity which means access to game and for Subhash Gupta to be ungagged|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables represented India the maximum times in last decade or so, they have won BFAME 4 times, reached QFs of Bermuda Bowl twice as well as R16 in Rosenblum during this period|pg||
nt|rv: apologies folks, waiting for power and connectivity to be back|pg||
nt|rv: I am not at the venue, doing commentary from home|pg||
nt|rv: P.Sridhar has won silver and bronze medal as part of Texan Aces in 2 successive European Open tournies, SS was part of team when they won bronze and Sumit was part of team when ...|pg||
nt|rv: they silver|pg||
nt|rv: pls stick around, let me call up folks at venue and check|pg||
nt|rv: power just back|pg||
nt|rv: we should be on in a couple of mins|pg||
nt|rv: they do have power back-up / generator at the venue, surprising it is taking awhile|pg||
nt|rv: according to BFI MPs, Pritish Kushari must be amongst the top 3 or 4 MPs holder in the country, he has earned most of the points as part of all-conquering Indian Railways team|pg||
nt|panja: symmetric North hand in blacks....difficult for W to know the best shift unless E could guid|pg||
nt|panja: guide even|pg||
nt|subhranp: slam board early in the day|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: for nearly a decade from mid-90s, Indian Railways used to have monopoly of all National team events|pg||
nt|panja: light opening...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: play was lost due to some disturbance sry|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sarkar_suk: neck to neck fight nice to watch sudhir :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|chilloncan: S should open with that hand|pg||
nt|sga1: How many would open 3@d with that hand vul, literally 9 loser hand. I would not.|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes :)|pg||
nt|rv: great, we are back on and hi again to Subhash Gupta|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|santyclz: Six @ds looks like the spot here.|pg||
nt|key1809: 6d making , lest see ,they can reach or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: 3nt easier here than 4h|pg||
mb|4N|nt|chilloncan: when you dont have spades, you have to get in early or they may make it too awkward for you to compete|pg||
nt|sga1: Doesn't fall into any rule 2-3-4 or not even for aggressive players with 2-3-4-5 rule.|pg||
nt|offthebend: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: Excelente Resultado para N-S en la otra sala|pg||
nt|panja: true...with extra strength...and near balanced hands..it is always worthwhile exploring 3N in preference to 4 of a Major|pg||
nt|panja: here though, with all the Aces, North is likely to prefer a @S game|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: .|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sarkar_suk: thats a good lead for declarer :)|pg||
nt|sga1: 4 quick tricks for defense.|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: 2n presumably jacoby, 3h probably showing 6carder heart|pg||
mb|5N|nt|sarkar_suk: nw trump shift shd be :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: tightly contested semi final so far and I am sure it is going that way till the end |pg||
nt|rv: I might have bid 2n or 3@h with Sridhar's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: But trump shift can only help if N switches to @d after winning @sK|pg||
nt|sga1: so that 2nd trump can also be removed.|pg||
nt|panja: there was that other issue....did S show 5@S with this bidding? his next bid gives us the answer...NO|pg||
nt|panja: so 4@S, it will be...or will it go further?|pg||
nt|subhranp: could go higher|pg||
nt|panja: BTW Subhran, what is 2@D for you?|pg||
nt|panja: 12+?|pg||
nt|subhranp: this could prove costly for DSM|pg||
mb|6H|nt|subhranp: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: both 3n and 4@h have excellent play for N-S|pg||
nt|panja: I was wondering whey Keyzad bid 2@D rather than 2@S|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S would have shown 9-10 or so....|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: S actually is not even minimum by Losing Trick Count standards, has playabiulity in at least 2 suits, only mild rebid problems, and can open the suit she wants led. all that adds ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: up to a clear opening bid|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|panja: if he guesses everything right, this could make|pg||
nt|panja: but that is rather unlikely|pg||
nt|panja: on the @CK lead...with correct @S view..there is a red suit squeeze on West|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes right panja..|pg||
nt|subhranp: one can trust keyzad to find those lines|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: play on deal 1 was lost due to some disterbunce sorry all|pg||
pc|c6|nt|panja: Williaim Watson suggests that is the only option.....@CKQ must be in, W must hold 5 @D 4!M..so East must hold 4 Spades to make!|pg||
nt|panja: 5@H4@H, that is|pg||
nt|panja: Keyzad could conjure all that up..he is quite capable of thinking of a way to make this|pg||
nt|panja: and E's first @D will tell him W holds 5@D|pg||

nt|rv: Prabhakar should have bid appropriate @s try bid as per his system|pg||

nt|rv: Subhash Gupta is affectinately called Guruji (master) in Indian bridge circles:)|pg||
nt|rv: Guruji what would be your recommended auction in last deal?|pg||
nt|subhranp: well..i wouldnt bet against a DSM vs Form final now|pg||
nt|subhranp: form getting a few imps back on that one|pg||
nt|key1809: subhash thought it more important to show his 6s, rather than 4c dmd support|pg||
mb|1D|nt|subhranp: interesting board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ayan: Hi Subs, looks like we will have a full house pretty soon|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW have 5D|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|sga1: it could be 2@h/3@H depending on whether NS would compete to 3@C or not.|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor sridhar already stretched his 5 points to make a noise|pg||
nt|subhranp: venky could have continue hearts there to put some more pressure|pg||
mb|3N|nt|subhranp: NS are odds on to make 4S here|pg||
nt|ayan: looks like 3 @c is rev bergen |pg||
nt|subhranp: well both Venky and Subhash quiet so far|pg||

mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: ofcourse no question of game reach :)|pg||
nt|subhranp: venky coming in aggressively here, finding the spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: 2NT here was natural, opening hand.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|subhranp: i think the format of this event this time puts formidables at a bit of disadvantage to start with. they dont have time to settle down|pg||
nt|subhranp: quiet partial this time|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|sga1: not Jacoby which many prefer.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rv: Jacoby responses have been tailored a lot by different partnerships, traditionally 3 level bids show stiff and 4 level second 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ayan: Very unlike Guruzi Bid, I must admit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|subhranp: kushari should find the heart lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: looks like Kushari-Laltu have their own home-grown method here|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|subhranp: possibly the vulnerability made them keep quiet|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz: I read recently that it's right to rebid a 5 card major on these auctions on the grounds that pd may have 3.  I remain unconvinced.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- I did miss -- PS was forced to bid 2D over the T/O dbl -- in that case , he could take one more bid -- like 2S  over 2H|pg||
nt|subhranp: assuming DSM goes through, they should look to capitalize on the initial rustiness (if any) of Formidables today|pg||
nt|ayan: now Venky may try for the @c J|pg||
nt|subhranp: trump back also should be ok here|pg||

nt|subhranp: good lead sets up heart winner for defence|pg||
nt|dslee: 2NT is a special bid here from Kushari which shows a speciality hand 14-15 points with 5-5|pg||
nt|dslee: 4@C from Laltu is a relay to know the other 5 cards|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, that makes a big difference.|pg||

nt|rv: he can predict bids of Guruji and Venky (Sr) better than each other since he has played a lot with both of them:)|pg||
nt|key1809: satya is sitting in Sumit's place, and he will be the one who will have to make the o/c unless afcourse,M/s Nadar decide a t/o x|pg||
nt|sunit:  vulnerable its always better to balance with 5sp since partner may not have enough values for a 2 level double|pg||

nt|babs59: Roland is asleep Subs, no need for cricket analogies :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Laltu has upgarded his hand though he has only 14 hcp, I might have stuck to 1@c opening|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt preempted NS out of a @H contract|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW should reach to 3n here|pg||
nt|panja: and 3Nt will go down on a @S lead..say @ST from South|pg||
mb|1N|nt|babs59: though to me 'wicket' sounds more like the contract, 'run' sounds more like the overtrick|pg||

mb|p|nt|subhranp: dbl now from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: hi panja|pg||
nt|panja: W cannot pass for penalty..he is too weak for 1Nt...so 1@S is the best option...although he has only 3 Spades|pg||
nt|panja: hi Subhran|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: well not sure what dbl is from North hand here|pg||
nt|subhranp: balancing position can dbl in most conventions|pg||
nt|panja: risky for N to come in..@H Q lead requesting unblock of @HJ if N had it..|pg||
nt|panja: was 2Nt by North?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|alamiro: Ganan 5@h E-W |pg||
nt|sga1: Easy 11 tricks for NS|pg||
nt|offthebend: the upgrade here is not working well for laltu |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rv: this will not be a success with all cards not lying well and could be many down|pg||
nt|ayan: yes, next time like IPL, we will hire Barbara for our selection trial|pg||
nt|subhranp: hit the right suit, H8 could have been much better|pg||
nt|santyclz: Didn't anticipate this contract...|pg||
nt|dslee: this is an interesting auction, Formi trying to pull back whatever they can |pg||
pc|s5|nt|panja: looks like advance over overcall is forcing for NS..so 2@H was F1R..|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|panja: holding @HJ..if N ducked it....he has to be very sure it won't hurt later|pg||
nt|subhranp: declarer could make this if he manages to ruff heart in dummy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|subhranp: yes risky but then i believe no pain no gain|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|subhranp: venky should have played on trumps|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|panja: perhaps, a little less risky for South to come in even with his meagre 8 HCP hand....but there is risk in any intervention|pg||
nt|panja: so S. Gupta seems to have solved EW's problem..|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|nt|panja: I wonder why S did not lead a Diamond|pg||

nt|vugraphzvz: pl stand bye|pg||
nt|rv: deal where Kushari's misdefense against 2n will now be replayed?|pg||
nt|rv: that will mean 6 IMPs less for Texans and DSM still in lead?|pg||
nt|offthebend: I have just been informed that bd 71 has been cancelled but they will play one extra board |pg||
nt|rv: Pramod, can we adjust the scores here even if we can't watch action on replayed brd?|pg||
nt|rv: possibly deal 71 was foul board because of duplication related issues|pg||
nt|rv: this is not real bidding on this deal, Pramod is getting us back on track|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: sure i shall put the score manually after the board 71 is over|pg||
nt|offthebend: effectively the score stands at 104 -109 in favour of DSM as Mr.Sunit choksi has been fined 2 imps penalty for mobile ringing and bd 71 has to be replayed |pg||

nt|babs59: though admittedly EW could make 5D on board 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: i hope not..|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 3@S is transfer to @C|pg||
nt|subhranp: NS should bid this slam now|pg||
nt|kareno: Subhash and I owned a rubber bridge club in Toronto many years ago :)|pg||
nt|subhranp: 2c probably transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|d|nt|panja: one has to be careful about this dbl..seems the normal thing to do..but S will not opt to defend a @S contract after that double|pg||
nt|babs59: yes 2@C = @D suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: 3S here is puppet to 3NT to startwith |pg||
nt|subhranp: 3h cue |pg||
mb|2D|nt|dslee: 4@H |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: when playing against opps who use support doubles, there is a reason to bid 2S on the E hand rather than 1S.  a support double typically can be used over 1S but not over 2S|pg||
nt|panja: as I suspected...|pg||
nt|subhranp: laltu thinking of 6?|pg||
nt|panja: this will come down to @D guess in the end|pg||
nt|subhranp: not required|pg||
nt|panja: right....5 is cold|pg||
nt|subhranp: unless club is led|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 2Nt showing some 5-card Major|pg||
nt|dslee: ideal lead from laltu ? According to me, it shd be @H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: Guruji, PS-SS methods are all transfers including 3@s to @c, 4@c to @d etc|pg||
nt|offthebend: oh no - looks like it is TRF to Clubs|pg||
nt|subhranp: with those controls, N could have bid 3s|pg||
nt|subhranp: i'm not sure if we are watching the right cards here|pg||
nt|panja: that seems to be their method|pg||
pc|c2|nt|subhranp: club continuation could put some pressure on declarer|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|offthebend: sry about that folks |pg||
nt|panja: is that spelling right for Kaizad? I thought it was Keyzad|pg||
nt|ayan: This is the last deal|pg||
nt|panja: @CQ makes sense too..he is unlikely to get in again..|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|panja: Good Morning, all|pg||
pc|d2|nt|subhranp: Form pulling back a few imps on the last couple of boards|pg||
nt|subhranp: hi panja|pg||
pc|d6|nt|panja: Venky will lead a @D|pg||
nt|panja: going by his tendency..from last session|pg||
nt|subhranp: toss up between minors|pg||
nt|panja: similar bidding last session|pg||
nt|panja: if S holds @CKxx...and W, ATxx, there might be three tricks to begin with...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rv: 4@c shows some @c fit possibly, 4@d/4@h cues, 4n is RKC in @Cs, 5@D is 0 or 3 keys|pg||
nt|subhranp: you are bang on panja, venky finds the killer lead|pg||
nt|panja: there is very good rationale behind the choice..|pg||
nt|panja: and Venky is one of the  smartest when it comes to understanding opponent's or any bidding method|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes as partha pointed out, no dbl of 2c or 3c by subhash|pg||
nt|panja: W bid Spades...for 2@C sequence, E is likely to have Hearts...|pg||
nt|dslee: even though 4 rounds of the game left tomorrow, DSM are likely to break the 50 IMP lead today itself, they have been fantastic the whole of last three days.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|panja: it seems NS have missed a 2@H partial|pg||
nt|panja: but of course 2@D could go down...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rv: sry 5@d is 1 or 4 keys, they play 0314|pg||
nt|panja: and S would have doubled 2@C if he had good Clubs|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panja: that leaves @D suit as the best bet..|pg||
pc|d7|nt|alamiro: Probablemente sea -2 al menos que encuentre el K seco|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|subhranp: this lead its easy. only club lead and continuation would have put kushari on a guess|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|panja: and Tewari-Prabhakar are in 4@H ...it will go down|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|nt|panja: true..but after the second Club..he would have had to come back to hand with a @S ruff..and then @D guess was much more likely to succeed|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|subhranp: will make now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|panja: thx to their mentor..Nandu Kushari..|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chilloncan: with only 3 small trumps and some doubtful values, W was not really orth more than a game invitation. 3H would have  expressed her values more accurately|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|babs59: 4@H not likely to make with the trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|dslee: 48 looks like a pickup form formidables|pg||

pc|h7|nt|subhranp: 5c is probably the best spot here|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H would have been a god spot....5@C, too...|pg||
nt|panja: most 1Nt opening sequences are pretty bad at finding out 5 of a minor game...especially if the weak suit is other minor|pg||
nt|subhranp: with such a 2 suiter hand, laltu could have considered a safer suit contract|pg||

nt|rv: np Buddy, you are doing a fantastic job, incidentally Buddy has be on for all 13 segments so far|pg||
nt|key1809: can make 6c here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|rv: @s bump could make it difficult for E-W|pg||
nt|key1809: splinter of spades at some stage might encourage west to cue hearts, and that might lead em to slam|pg||
mb|2C|an|ALERTED|nt|rv: is 2@c transfer to @ds?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rv: yes according to knowledgable kibitzer who plays same system|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunit:  2cl is diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|key1809: i guess they play trf overcalls after 1s overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|key1809: hence 2c=dmds|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I would have bid 3@s with Tewari's hand|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|rv: too much room given, against good opps they will get it right more often than not|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: commentators curse|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunit:  so formidables are back in business|pg||
nt|key1809: big misunderstanding, good to discuss forcing n nonforcing bids:)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|rv: I have been praising Sumit-Bhabesh since morning and this is what happens, all DSM supporters asking me not to praise them anymore:)|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h6|mc|13|nt|rv: Tewari's 2@s worked a charm if he had bid 3@s , Bhabhes may have bid 4@s and they would have got to even slam|pg||
pg||

nt|panja: W could hold @DKTx, for example|pg||
nt|subhranp: Form slowly narrowing the gap here|pg||
nt|panja: that wouls make 5@C impossible...and 4Major shaky|pg||
nt|panja: 6@C for EW?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cold as :)|pg||
nt|panja: will not be easy to bid though...|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes, requires both minors to break|pg||
nt|panja: let us see if @S shortness comes out soon enough|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chilloncan: looking at that W hand, it is not even automatic that 3S will make facing certain perfectly respectable 1S overcalls|pg||
nt|alamiro: Zona de grand slam para E-W|pg||
nt|panja: so..+450 instead of +500 because S took out 4@S dbl..and of course he did that because of the first 1@S dbl|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H for EW....tricky to bid..|pg||
mb|1S|nt|offthebend: such hurriedly bid hands can cost 2 imps which mean a lot in such tight matches |pg||
nt|panja: interesting hand...11-card @H fit for NS, and 10-card @C fit for EW....but Total Tricks are much less than 21|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!d|nt|alamiro: aunque con esta apertura muy dificil declararlo!|pg||
nt|subhranp: huu8[|pg||
nt|panja: @D 32 is sufficient I guess..@C41 can be handled|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|panja: 4@H cold for NS I guess...yet again 1Nt opening ahead of their turn|pg||
nt|panja: EW might make 9 tricks in Clubs, NS, 8 or 9 in Hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: it nees 3-2 @H break..and a few positions in Clubs..|pg||
nt|panja: so just about 35-40%.....borderline bet at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|subhranp: i think they should bid these vul games|pg||
nt|panja: the trouble, for E, is 1@C is non-natural..just 3 cards..|pg||
nt|panja: to begin with..|pg||
nt|subhranp: sorry, yes you are right|pg||
nt|panja: so E does not know the fit yet...|pg||
nt|panja: She is likely to focus on @D...|pg||
nt|panja: the 2/1 freaks have this issue|pg||
mb|d|nt|subhranp: slam this time for EW|pg||
nt|panja: EW are unlikely to venture into a game....because it is only a minor...and W has poor picture..but NS might want to try 4@H|pg||
nt|dslee: they surely wont, I am sure DSM will be playing more safe from here|pg||
nt|dslee: and probably they will follow the Bhikari sangh principle :)|pg||
nt|panja: her 2@C showed @D suit, didn't it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: flat brd here, easy 3n, matter of OTs|pg||
nt|rv: South bid 3n and not East|pg||
nt|panja: dbl one suiter?|pg||
nt|panja: possibly, South has already overbid..2@S is a little too strong a bid for the 5332 hand......|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes|pg||
nt|panja: and W could likely sit for this?|pg||
nt|subhranp: i dont agree with the dbl|pg||
mb|4H|nt|panja: the @H suit is lost then..|pg||
nt|panja: what if W started with, say 3433? with KJx of Spades, say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: having shown @D suit could surely bid 4@C JUST in case pard actually has them?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: minimum and possibly max of 10 tricks for N-S|pg||
mb|4N|nt|panja: 3@H will be unlucky to go down...but seems it will go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 1@S bid makes it slightly easier..|pg||
nt|dslee: well now no|pg||
nt|panja: oh well..on this lead, it will make|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 loser hand.  Doesn't seem worth a q.|pg||
nt|dslee: I was thinking about this lead from laltu to be honest|pg||
mb|5D|nt|subhranp: EW might end in 6s but spades are 3-3 so its safe|pg||
nt|panja:  E ccould upgrade his hand because of 1@S|pg||
nt|panja: what if W started with @SKJx@HKQxx @DQxx@CKxx?|pg||
nt|panja: formidables seem already to have won this board...|pg||
nt|panja: other room EW stopped in 4@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|panja: unlikely to make this one|pg||
nt|panja: Keyzad should have doubled, I thought...|pg||
nt|panja: 40 down...opportunity to score some|pg||
nt|panja: he needs to pitch two losers, 1 in Spade and 1 in DIamond..although @D is not really needed...can take finesse too|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: 3nt es bal de 24-25?|pg||
nt|panja: @C next|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: presumably E and W would have discussed what a 3N opener means prior to competing in this event. if it is a traditional balanced hand, as W clearly intended it, then pass by E is ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unthinkable, so clearly E though it was some other type of hand|pg||
nt|alamiro: Realmente no tengo claro que muestra esta apertura de 3nt, pero si 2nt es conocida como la apertura mata slam |pg||
nt|alamiro: ahora podremos decir que 3nt mata los grand slams :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: should get 10 tricks --- boring hand |pg||
nt|rv: Laltu's @s7 is second best from poor suit, hence Kushari shifted|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: at least they played in @C lol whata travesty to play a slam in Gerber|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow Mrs Nadar has done well here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|panja: trump was much safer..no need for an aggresive lead|pg||
nt|panja: so that will be 15 IMPS to formidables|pg||
pc|s2|nt|subhranp: declarer has to be careful here|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|panja: and can make 13 or red suit squeeze?|pg||
nt|panja: just win any lead remove trumps, cash @DA, finish trumps, and get to w hand with Club winners..|pg||
pc|h7|nt|alok_daga: hi all|pg||
nt|alok_daga: this brd OR in 4clubs|pg||
nt|subhranp: looks like a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|alok_daga: now with the gap narrowing match shud be a keenly fought 1|pg||
pc|hT|nt|subhranp: yes, i agree panja. i think Texans havent shown the required level of aggression so far in this set|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|subhranp: trump promotion coming|pg||
nt|subhranp: satya probably thinking of the best line of play if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|alok_daga: think as per their methods Bhabesh had 2 make it GF via a 3spades|pg||
pc|c5|nt|subhranp: i personally feel bhabhesh has bid strong enough for 4C to be GF|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|panja: this will now go many down...force the Declarer..keep playing Clubs|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|subhranp: yes panja..he should find that play after Kezad's dbl|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s9|nt|panja: he will|pg||
nt|dslee: things have not gone in the formidable way today - now the lead is slowly climbing to 60|pg||
nt|dslee: 3NT was not bid in deal 48|pg||
pc|cK|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|subhranp: right now, venky-subhash finding laltu-kushari too hot to handle|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|panja: gone now|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|panja: there is so much 'opportunity' to score |pg||
nt|subhranp: may be they dont want to pile on the agony on their opponents|pg||
nt|panja: 6@D if NS escape @S lead..|pg||
nt|panja: if N begins with 2@C.....the minor suits will come out in the bidding...|pg||
nt|alok_daga: a 4hrts cums up ,likely push|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: and now I have to leave...thx Subhran, Pramod (great to have a top class bridge player to operate Vugraph) and all, bye|pg||
nt|ayan: Laltu is always the busy guy at table and Kushari just the complement |pg||
mb|1N|nt|subhranp: thanks panja|pg||
nt|panja: so..if N gets to play a @D contract...50% chance of making the slam..(escaping @S lead)..|pg||
nt|subhranp: what would you open panja with Venky's hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|sga1: This set DSM got 13 imps in 2 boards, many boards no swing.|pg||
nt|ayan: Both Laltu and Sumit are Kushari's student |pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|rv: not safe for PS to get in on 15-17 1n opening even with 16 hcp|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|ayan: Hi|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D is fine..|pg||
nt|panja: DSM have played superb bridge, too, give credit where it is due...many brilliant moves..|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 2Nt promises some 5-card Major, I guess|pg||
mb|3C|nt|alamiro: Particularmente siempre prefiero mostrar mis palos mas largos, ahora para mostrar el @D, siempre mostrara primero mas cartas en @h|pg||
nt|subhranp: hi panja|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr:    |pg||
mb|3H|nt|sga1: heading for 3NT here.|pg||
nt|subhranp: this should be an easy 3n|pg||
nt|panja: much better to begin low.....except when your partner is known to be an ultraconservative player|pg||
nt|panja: isn't this worth 3Nt?|pg||
nt|panja: no...|pg||
nt|panja: not|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S? no, one short|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4@H again..|pg||
mb|3S|nt|alamiro: En este caso no deberia preocuparle decir 1@D inicialmente con su mano gf, podria luego hacer un reverse y mostraria de una manera mas adecuada su mano!|pg||
nt|alamiro: Afortunadamente East tiene 4 cartas en @ds |pg||
nt|ayan: Strange pass from Venky|pg||
nt|panja: EW have many tricks in Hearts.....|pg||
nt|panja: if E held three Aces and @SKx, but not the @HQ..prospects of a slam..|pg||
nt|subhranp: hopefully they will check for aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: many in India play X of strong nt opening as showing 5+m+4M, to be best of my knowledge this NS pair play double as values |pg||
nt|panja: which bid killed the exploration? 1Nt or W's Pass?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sga1: cold with good @C position.|pg||
nt|rv: PS had poor 16 hcp with no good lead and poor intermediates and wisely decided to pass|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW playing a bit of subdued game, they are still warming up..better get onto the pitch very fast|pg||
nt|panja: but they seem to have ended here by accident|pg||
nt|panja: Satya wants to explore that possibility...I am sure Kiran won't be interested|pg||
nt|subhranp: 4d might interest satya|pg||
nt|alok_daga: if 2nt showed minimum of the nt range a slam try seems optimistic|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|subhranp: this should make with cards favourably placed|pg||
nt|panja: with a 55 fit...to guard against !KQx in inside..declarer must finesse first time which Kushari will do by force of habit|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|chilloncan: excellent old-fashioned auction |pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|offthebend: find 3 heart tricks fast to hold to 8 tricks |pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: the 1Nt response in Standard...is a weak link of the method|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|ayan: Looks like Subs is in IPL mood|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: normally, though, one would respond in the suit that is both longest and strongest|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panja: with @CKQJxxx, S has to respond 1Nt..rather unnatural move..|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c5|nt|offthebend: now 9 tricks |pg||
nt|panja: he will now wonder whether @S guess could be saved..|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|panja: @HA, @C finesse, @CA, ruff, @D ruff and then @H|pg||
nt|ayan: Looks like Venky sacrified his ruff tricks |pg||
pc|h8|nt|subhranp: ??|pg||
pc|h7|nt|alamiro: agree|pg||
nt|panja: The two teams on view here are two of the top teams in India at present|pg||
nt|panja: Formidables..have reached QF in World championships at least thrice in last 10 years..|pg||
nt|subhranp: blunder by S?|pg||
nt|panja: Texan Aces finished second in European championships a couple of year ago|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||

nt|rv: both|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|mc|9|nt|figo: yes , to lesser extent though|pg||
nt|rv: psycologically and tactically recovering a sizeble chunk of IMPs in this segment is good for Formidables a) they have more time to recover remaining deficit b) it puts more ...|pg||

nt|panja: thx Pramod|pg||
nt|rodal f: 17HP and all on.|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW|pg||
nt|panja: so -90 rather than +140 if EW had bid 2@H or 3@H|pg||
nt|ayan: 4 @H went down in OR, Sumit got tempted by the lead of @d 2|pg||
nt|panja: they might not reach there..because if N begins low......he might not want to bid 4..or might get passed out early|pg||
nt|alok_daga: srry push|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: slams occurring with a remarkable frequency. one is temopted to question whether the deal generator is really set to "random"|pg||
nt|panja: will this go all pass?|pg||
nt|subhranp: would you open with S hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: I doubt..|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: 6NT by N|pg||
nt|alamiro: Me parece que tiene mucho para una apertura de 2@h|pg||
nt|chilloncan: spec suggests deal generator is programmed for goulasch|pg||
nt|panja: tricky for South..|pg||
nt|panja: he is likely to think he can defend 4@H..and that 5@D might not be a pucca proposition|pg||
nt|subhranp: subhash could have played second round of diamonds before playing clubs|pg||
nt|panja: 15 opposite 9...routine 3Nt if N begins 1N|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rv: scores may not be right here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Like to stay out there|pg||
nt|panja: now, after 1Nt...N will raise..|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rv: deal 71 might need to manually corrected|pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt to show Club suit? |pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: many pairs play two way weak 2s -- 2M is close to an opening bid, and 2D is a truly weak 2 in one majopr|pg||
nt|alamiro: Cuando se abre de preventiva los valores deberian estar concentrados en el palo de apertura, tiene algunos extras laterales|pg||
nt|alamiro: supongo que 3@s es buen palo y buena mano|pg||
nt|alamiro: Norte debe rematar 6nt para proteger su K@d|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for me S has a 1H opener, but even without the 2-tiered weak 2s, there is an ultraconservative school of weak 2s that the S hand fits perfectlt. Matt Granovetter for example uses ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this style, which derives from the dawn of weak 2s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this looks like Ogust|pg||
nt|panja: Sorry missed the play of the last deal....|pg||
mb|2H|nt|panja: and 2Nt might be too high, even 1Nt might not make on a bad day|pg||
nt|panja: excellent lead..|pg||
nt|panja: notice the motivation..|pg||
nt|panja: and now 3@H showing shortness|pg||
nt|panja: so this should end in 3Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: he wants to shift after winning this one|pg||
nt|panja: and he will now shift to Clubs..|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rv: Guruji will you bid 2@c or 2@S with North hand, I might have tried 2@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: QJ block @D make it a -10 for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: the @DA....improves the combination..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seen from N Y|pg||
nt|panja: change it to @SA in N hand..and there would have been more trouble|pg||
nt|rodal f: But @D could been 3-3|pg||
nt|panja: difficult lead problem..I guess small @H best choice|pg||
nt|subhranp: this would be interesting|pg||
nt|subhranp: kushari will signal clubs|pg||
nt|panja: interesting 3@S bid...can S rebid 3N now?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: and @H Q could get played here..|pg||
nt|panja: because S wants to tackle @D asap|pg||
nt|panja: this is a tricky situation...N is thinking about 44 fit..S, about @H check...|pg||
nt|panja: exchange South's @CA for @DA...and you will see why 3Nt could be a problem...|pg||
nt|dslee: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: En mi opinion si voy abrir 1 mano de 11 ptos a nivel de 1, es porque tengo un 2do canto sin ninguna dificultad, en este caso Sur pudo abrir de 1@h y luego rematar 2@h y problema ...|pg||
nt|alamiro: resuelto, mano totalmente descrita!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: very surprising for N to pass after a 3S reply to Ogust showing super maximum|pg||
nt|alamiro: Ahora pueden ganar 7 si encuentra la Q@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe N should have only invited once 2@h was doubled|pg||
nt|panja: W might shift..|pg||
nt|subhranp: on a club lead, N should win with CK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|offthebend: hard to say --- rather play in 6-1 than 4-3 fit with such hands |pg||
nt|panja: he knows @HA is with S, he has heard 1@H bid..he won't take a chance on @H9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am not shure if that was at the hurry|pg||
nt|panja: that is why none of NS want to settle in 3Nt|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|panja: no way to make now..|pg||
nt|dslee: deal 50 tewari lead a @H|pg||
nt|panja: The Spade suit undisclosed...so that makes Declarer's job easier|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|dslee: 4@D was slam indication|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|ayan: 9 tricks|pg||

nt|panja: @SAK will not do..I guess|pg||
nt|panja: are you sure about that slam invitation?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|panja: it is a toss up between @ST, and @H9...|pg||
nt|panja: if S had later..@SQ shift would have worked better|pg||
nt|subhranp: heart shift was right even if N had H9 doubleton|pg||
nt|panja: oh..I forgot N is the Declarer..|pg||
nt|panja: right..@H continuation is right...because @ST is seen in the dummy|pg||
nt|subhranp: should be -1|pg||
nt|subhranp: defence should look to get their 4 tricks in red-suits|pg||
nt|subhranp: venkatesh not sure if Keyzad has HA or not and might be considering knocking out HA if Kushari has it|pg||
nt|panja: and what if North started with nothing in Spades? or just one control?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chilloncan: after all, if N was not going to move towards slam over the strongest rebid that S could make, why on earth bid 2N in the first place?|pg||

nt|subhranp: yes good defence here by Laltu|pg||

pc|c7|nt|panja: how is N to know 3Nt is a good spot?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

nt|rv: there is a bit of psychology in that as well, each team trying to outsmart other by guessing who is likely to play and where|pg||

nt|panja: 16 opp 13 HCP...|pg||
nt|panja: slam will make because @S are 33, Club honours divided..|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@H from senior can be interpreted in two ways: if you have a @H stopper, bid 3NT , or I have absolute @C with a cue bid, I think the latter wsa true|pg||
nt|dslee: might be Dhadi should had bid 3NT and closed|pg||
nt|panja: slam on one of two finesses...|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: on B21, Tewari-Prabha bid 4@S..and scored to win 11 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: En la seleccion del equipo de libres para el sudamericano hice la peticion de la maquina generadora de manos! Rafa podrias ayudarme con eso? Quiero 1 igual para Ecuador :)|pg||
nt|subhranp: tough to reach those|pg||
nt|panja: Prabhakar took the @H finesse using @DA entry..and then it worked..simply banged @SA to make 13 tricks..|pg||
mb|1S|nt|alamiro: 2nt es menores!|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: no 5@C por East en serio?|pg||
nt|subhranp: while DSM have played very well, the resounding win here has also been due to some below par performance from Texans in the last 3 sets|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt will be the the normal spot though|pg||
nt|panja: 2@D opening by S helped them find the spot, no doubt|pg||
mb|2D|an|drury 4 trumps|nt|panja: I don't know their methods..but 3@H looked like short suit...and later a doubt was natural..as I explained...so I am not sure N really was angling for a slam...but I don't know ...|pg||
nt|panja: their methods...so IMHO..|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: If u like to watch more than one table: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|subhranp: 2s-dbl could make|pg||
mb|2H|nt|offthebend: I agree that still more than 2 sessions to go --- but momentum seems to be in DSM's favour right now |pg||
nt|rv: what would X be from SS in bal seat, does it shows minors or values with some @s length?|pg||
nt|panja: this will be touch and go 3Nt..|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: @H lead?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|panja: this isn't going too well here I am afraid|pg||
nt|alok_daga: will laltu proceed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: no point in leading @D, North's first bid suit..|pg||
mb|5C|nt|panja: this was a 3@S partial for EW..1Nt opening seems to have stolen that|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: I don't know why N went through Stayman|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: drury should be reanamed dreary|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|subhranp: this lead might just sell the contract|pg||
nt|panja: @H is better than Spades..because E knows W has 4+ Hearts|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rv: with my regular partner, I play this X as t/o showing minors, PS-SS prefer to play it as bal 10 hcp with @S length/card|pg||
nt|offthebend: sadly not too many people compete with minors after a NT O/call|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: I must be seeing things -- I thought there was a NT O/call somewhere and SS had both minors :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: but 1Nt will go down some|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: i would indeed bid 5C, but E is hoping for a defeat of 4H|pg||
nt|panja: @C switch, I would think now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|subhranp: any reason to lead diamonds here panja?|pg||
nt|panja: in the OR, S rebid 3@S...to leave some space for exploration....but 4@S doesn't seem to have deterred them here..|pg||
nt|panja: @H finesse is needed anyway....so N has to think of a way to try both Major suit finesses..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rv: only 7 tricks for Kushari here, still might pick up a swing if Sumit-Bhabesh bid upto 3@c|pg||
pc|d3|nt|subhranp: heart shift could have been better|pg||
nt|panja: look out for @H signal from E|pg||
nt|dslee: 1NT is not a comfortable auction to be in - |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ayan: To find out if S has a 5 card M|pg||
nt|panja: high @D will show @H?|pg||
nt|panja: and now, it should be @H first..|pg||
pc|s8|nt|panja: I can't see a very strong one|pg||
nt|subhranp: D5 a vital card here|pg||
nt|subhranp: looks like some misunderstanding on B22 between prabh-tewary|pg||
nt|panja: @D switch was cheeky...too smart perhaps|pg||
nt|panja: B22, I think Nandu revaluated his hand brilliantly...|pg||
nt|dslee: pich low @H|pg||
nt|panja: small @H shows @H...|pg||
nt|panja: direct approach|pg||
pc|s6|nt|panja: Nandu is the nickname of Kushari.......|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dslee: udca carding and discards I think for whole of the field|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rv: Guruji you are tired and need some sleep after 4 days of WC bridge in Yeh Bros and travel|pg||
pc|dT|nt|offthebend: correct |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|panja: but Venky spurned @H because of the Stayman sequence|pg||
nt|subhranp: did venky think that North has 4+hearts?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|chilloncan: small compensation for the EW game|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Agree with u Subhransu. 2@S was very makeable, but...|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|panja: to continue with team descriptions......Kushari is a veteran...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h4|nt|babs59: but equally he's curious to see who his opposition will be in 2 days time|pg||
nt|offthebend: for NS to find C fit , SS could have doubled 2S --- as a T/O for minors and he had a good enough hand to do it |pg||
nt|panja: and a mentor of many members of his team here..|pg||
nt|subhranp: that will be last trick for defence|pg||
nt|viren169: Hello all...|pg||
nt|panja: Subhran..pl add if you can...|pg||
nt|panja: high @D now...and small Heart from Nandu in a microsecond..|pg||

mb|d|nt|subhranp: they may settle for 400|pg||
nt|panja: this will not be easy|pg||
nt|panja: 8 clear tricks for N|pg||
nt|panja: on B51...Sumit opened 3@C light as in this room, but did not drop partner's forcing 3@S bid like a hot cake|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Kushari retired from Indian Railways a couple of years ago...an organisation that employed and encouraged dozen+ bridge players..and ruled Indian bridge almost for a decade|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Rafa: El equipo Severin se tituló campeón, 2do Alti, el 3er puesto no ha terminado|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 2 Spades, 4 Hearts, two Diamonds..|pg||
nt|panja: but Indian boundaries was the limit of their support.......that is why they did not participate too often as Railway on the international stage..|pg||
nt|panja: Kushari passed whereas Tewari bid 2Nt in this sequence...a bit of a stretch, 2Nt seems to be.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|offthebend: PS may be regretting his opening NOW |pg||
nt|babs59: seems perfectly respectable to me though|pg||
nt|rv: SS might pass this and they might be just about ok|pg||
nt|subhranp: this is another potential swing board for Texans|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|subhranp: declarer will have to endplay venky in diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|panja: ninth can come from some kind of endplay...but it won't be easy to figure out single Dummy|pg||
nt|viren169: fortunately 6@h also makes here... but they should come to rest in 6@d|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chilloncan: diamonds likely to be 22 after non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|offthebend: Not going to be a success here for texan |pg||
nt|offthebend: when he takes the D finesse ( from the bidding ) -- the roof will cave in |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|panja: meanwhile, on to present biddng...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|alok_daga: making 2spades will also be a task will get tapped|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|subhranp: should just make on club guess|pg||
nt|panja: bidding even|pg||
nt|subhranp: i think this DSM team has many members of Indian Railways|pg||
nt|panja: note the raise to 2@H..with 3 cards...and the 2@S continuation to force..all good choices IMHO|pg||
nt|subhranp: well bid, clinically reached there|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|panja: this is more likely to fail rather than make|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|subhranp: pramod indicating 4 members of DSM part of Indian Railways. So this team is re-incarnation of Indian Railways|pg||
nt|panja: true..|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|viren169: Need some sponsor(s) to take the Indian team(s) onto the world stage!|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c3|pc|h2|nt|babs59: only went -2 in OR with D finesse.   but here Sunderram seems not to be taking that line|pg||
nt|rv: SS might have chanced 3n because he felt they were trailing and need IMPs|pg||
nt|babs59: and now he has real prospects!|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ayan: Laultu will perhaps end play with the 12th @d |pg||
nt|panja: small @S would be a good shift|pg||
nt|alok_daga: y wud work like a charm|pg||
nt|panja: @SK allows N to win @SA and enjoy @H ruff..small @S doesn't allow him that liberty|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s6|nt|dslee: 52 n 53 will also be DSM pickups|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|offthebend: Laltu in a hurry -- the Club suit may play for few more tricks |pg||
pc|h7|pc|dT|nt|babs59: not enough entries to establish clubs now|pg||
nt|panja: Did S come to know N's 15 HCP?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|panja: y, !AK and then a @D|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|babs59: so he had to try for 3-2 break|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|psyck: Landy for both majors is commonly employed on 1NT openings, some use it in this sequence with agreement|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|babs59: he didn't have 3 clubs tricks if they broke 4-1 though.|pg||
nt|babs59: not unless Laltu split which he wasn't doing|pg||

pc|h8|nt|rodal f: I'm just ruffed by my nice lady.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|subhranp: should be down on passive def|pg||
nt|dslee: thats what makes him Senior or Guruji as we lovingly call him in the circuit|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: NS started with too many @H rounds..N could have pushed @D early instead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Answer cometh there - Yes.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|mc|7|nt|psyck: aambitious to bid on after 4@s|pg||

mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: there is a thin line between being dropped & rested Chote:)|pg||
nt|rv: combined hands for N-S, decent slam with perfect fitting cards, 3-0 @s break scuttles it though|pg||
nt|rv: :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rv: Prabhakar's 3@s shows 3 card limit raise, I thought Honey might have bid 4@h as last train|pg||
nt|rv: Prabhakar had 3 gold cards @SK, @CK and @CJ as well, I might have bid 4@h as last train (no convenient cue/can't cross 4M)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes the slam seems to be cold on 2/1 @S break would be unfortunate result for those who bid this 78% slam|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|rv: good slam bad luck|pg||
pc|h2|nt|suketbombi: very cruel result but may be other room may bid as well and quit this bd|pg||

nt|alamiro: 6@D para N-S?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if they lead a club you might as well play 7D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 5 or 7 hand|pg||
nt|rv: other table nearly completed, Sumit and Anil are very fast players|pg||
nt|subhranp: NS close to 3n here|pg||
nt|subhranp: last board coming up..should be an easy 3n for EW|pg||
nt|viren169: another slam here|pg||
nt|panja: 6Nt good here...|pg||
nt|dslee: had suket been around, you would have heard another terminilogy called the bhosale lead - am sure few of it knows the meaning of that :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'll bet west isn't feeling particularly loving at the moment.|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: last board of the day|pg||
nt|rodal f: An interesting one seen from the specs side. Defence and end|pg||
mb|1S|nt|alok_daga: these 4IMPS,2IMPS can prove 2 be costly in a tight match|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: I doubt this will end up in a game|pg||
nt|panja: what is Bhosale lead?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rv: sorry I got the tables wrong, this table has finished earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Barbara is right|pg||
mb|4S|nt|babs59: but RV, I said that privately :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: open room is playing slow bec of some lighting problems |pg||
nt|rv: thanks to my excellent commentators, Guruji Subhash Gupta and Barbara and insightful comments by all specs|pg||
nt|babs59: and this board doesn't look like Texans can recover IMPs|pg||
nt|subhranp: i guess 2c is other two suits|pg||
nt|subhranp: last board of SF coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4Nt next?|pg||
nt|dslee: Bhosale is a singleton lead, rev Bhosale lead is a lead through which you try and find our ptr's singleton|pg||
nt|panja: EW are likely to overreach on this one|pg||
nt|dslee: your ptr singleton I meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: you'd better not play in the Open Room then Subhash :)|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@s most likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: you've mis-seen a few bids tonight!|pg||
nt|subhranp: well played DSM|pg||
nt|subhranp: finals starting tomorrow at 9:30 AM IST|pg||
nt|dslee: likely 3NT bid panja from laltu?|pg||
nt|panja: W should devalue his hand holding two loose Jacks..and not accept any invitation|pg||
nt|panja: and on B70 with 24 HCP combined holding , but rather an indifferent one, NS ventured into 6@S in OR..|pg||
nt|alok_daga: another 13 to DSM|pg||
nt|panja: well...I must correct that....6@S has a good % on paper..|pg||
nt|alok_daga: SRRY 11|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panja: NS will do well to take out trumps|pg||
nt|subhranp: one spade can be ruffed in dummy and should make|pg||
nt|viren169: no reason for either player to suggest nt|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rv: excellent job done by Vugraph operator Pramod Samant and good organization by Pradeep and KSBA team and Kiruba and BFI team|pg||
nt|offthebend: I would have slept enough tonite to keep my eyes wide awake  :)|pg||
nt|panja: good lead|pg||
nt|subhranp: texans couldnt make 4h on B97 so lead has widened again|pg||
nt|panja: this could go two down now..as W will play @D to K first time..., likely|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S shows minimum?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: is this right?|pg||
nt|panja: pass then|pg||
nt|dslee: hmm|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: last deal of this set :)|pg||
nt|dslee: lead is not heading to 70|pg||
nt|dslee: now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panja: of course there is reason..|pg||
nt|viren169: really?|pg||
nt|panja: W could hae 5 Diamonds...and in 6@S, there could be @D ruff..|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rv: could be another swing for DSM here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panja: seems this will be nine tricks..not 11 or 10 as GIB would like us to believe|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|subhranp: Formidables directly seeded to Finals|pg||
nt|panja: whereas 6Nt...is not likely to have that risk..|pg||
pc|s2|nt|panja: but EW can make 11...by using three entries in Dummy to play @S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|babs59: and I just expected a flat board|pg||
pc|sA|mc|11|nt|chilloncan: this is one of these rare cases where N can use KC with a small doubleton -- S has shown  4342 shape and a c;ub stop, so she has to have the clubs controlled herself, either ace or ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: king|pg||
nt|panja: interesting..that seemed cold|pg||
nt|panja: thx all, bye|pg||
