nt|mdgraham: NS can make 3@C - but how do they get there?|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: thin game is possible i suppose but this should be played in a partscore|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jr7: Good morning all|pg||
nt|jr7: Maria and Matias baybee the best DKpair|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 9 tricks the limit for n/s in hearts|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: if 3@s is weak, quite surprising that E didn't X for TO|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4@S making if trumps aren't played|pg||

nt|hesse: Swedn with a 14 imp lead before the last 14 boards of the match|pg||

nt|sybarra: or we may play a quiet 2 @H |pg||

nt|Gerben42:  very solid 1@H opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Arild Jakobsen and Gerben Dirksen|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: hi all welcome to the 2. half of the Nordic junior matck denmark U-20 - denmark U-25|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Preempt with 5c support might not always be the right descision, they should read Mike Lawrence books|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Urban - do u realy belive in the LAW?|pg||
nt|pelu: a guide-line, but not the 8. wonder of the world :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: not even the 7th :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Not necessary Peter but it can be a guide in difficult situations if you know how many trumphs both side have|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Scores after 1st half: Finland vs Faroes Islands 90-6 - Sweden U25 vs Sweden U20 50-19 - Norway U25 vs Norway U20 26-36|pg||
nt|hesse: Norway U20 won the first match yesterday against Norway U25 17-13|pg||
nt|pelu: good morning|pg||
nt|hesse: Sweden won their first match last evening with 25-0 and has started off well|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  they are a very experienced team|pg||
nt|hesse: Norway U20 won 17-13 against Norway U25 last night|pg||
nt|sater1957: this opening might lead to a 4@h game|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 3@h should make when @d 3-3|pg||
nt|kemperg: system includes light opening:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure this age group play partscores...|pg||
nt|roswolf: a featureless 10hcp - hmmm we are in the nursey ok:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: NS 5 card major, EW 5 card @s and 4 card @h - both strong NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: cards lie favorably so may make|pg||
nt|roswolf: north is a girl - how many more at the table/event?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maria is the only one|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: I think there is 4-5 girls in the event nor more at the table|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow - she needs to make an impression then|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At the table that is. A few more in the tournament|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jr7: 1 x@S and then @H = 1 down|pg||

pc|c6|nt|sater1957: which happens to make, if you do things right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everyone!|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  dont take it as a proof that you should open this|pg||
nt|jr7: a lot af things must he do right :-)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: should lose 2 spade  1 diamond and 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|ady: difficult for east to play the 8 on first trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: after the 10, not sure he should |pg||
nt|ady: sorry should lose 1 spade  not 2|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  because I think you shouldnt, if East opens you are still very much in the race|pg||
nt|jr7: 4@C 1 down|pg||
nt|peachy: Maria attempts a cunning underlead,|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I need more coffee, don't y'all think so....|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: for sure :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Gerben42:  Gundesen wants to play this hand|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sater1957: this should solve the @c|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: you never know what do do with the North hand - picture partner with @CJx and 3@c may not be so hot |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: sorry 10 played|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: strange @CK|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Still, impressive that the Faroe Islands can field a team, with just 50,000 inhabitants|pg||
nt|sharkey: So the Swedes play "standard" system - transfer bids after 1@C opening |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: Many cities with more than 50,000 don't even have one junior in the clubs|pg||
nt|sater1957: North was thrown in at trick 0|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Gerben42:  might as well be in 5 then, same finesse|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pelu: normal play after E has show: @HAK + @C QJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, you're not doing anything over 3@H, so it doesn't really matter|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42:  better hand for chinese poker than for leading against 4@H|pg||
nt|sater1957: now a small @S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this safety play in trumps will set W on a @s guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: So I think it´s better to win with @hA and play another @c|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: but still guesses in @s and @d|pg||
nt|sater1957: @d goes on @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: pergaps I should have said @s or @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps....|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: @s goes on @c @d he can always guess right while if @s AQ on back|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Gerben42:  oops :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes But S will return a @c|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: 4C is easier to set than 3D|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: there might be a defence to beat 3@h, but this isn't it|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Gerben42:  its convenient to get @D right on this line|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|hesse: declearer has to get a @d trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer not fooled by the ¬@SQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: the Danes' system also standard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub17/Turneringer/KampResultat927.html  for results and standing after round 4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Gerben42:  in this situation they could play good/bad then 3@D shows a "real hand" and E can cooperate|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: is declarer really playing this way?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: yes|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kemperg: will make|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - she will prevail as impossible go down|pg||
nt|roswolf: should make|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|pelu: Ew use a very special 2major-opening: 4card and 5+ in minor - yesterday Karlson open 2@S on @S9 x x x - and after a few bidingrounds he was in 7@s - making!|pg||
nt|roswolf: now no heroics ruff low -taking a trump finesse without trumps - cool|pg||
nt|sharkey: or - can she go down?|pg||
nt|sharkey: may ruff high and play for 1-1...|pg||
nt|roswolf: she can but she has a full count and therefore shouldnt|pg||
pc|c8|pc|dA|pc|hT|nt|sharkey: if she plays @C can't go wrong |pg||

nt|jr7: not down that way :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Good evening Hedy|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 5@d seemes like a fair shot here... Either no @h lead or @d K in place:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Hey Hedy|pg||
nt|jr7: 5@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing the heart king first would have guaranteed it without anguish|pg||
nt|roswolf: how restrained will east be!?|pg||
nt|sharkey: so a good start for the Danes - may not be bid next door|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Gerben42:  tough @H break here...|pg||
nt|jr7: or 4@H|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @H is good also|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@dx even better :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Hey Yuval|pg||

nt|kemperg: nice hand for a Raptor 1NT in S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes agood start to the morning|pg||
mb|d|nt|jr7: yes 5@D is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1@H or 2NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: what do u prefer?|pg||
nt|jr7: I dont like 2 x A|pg||
nt|peachy: Definitely worth biddingm vulnerable, if N knew South's had is that good|pg||
nt|hawe45: An awful 2 NT - but what is better?|pg||
nt|pelu: 25 HCP by NS - can they stay out of 3NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 1Nt by N now|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mdgraham: 2NT probably specific - hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@h?|pg||
nt|jr7: Dbl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: shows 4@s|pg||
nt|hesse: I think I would have bid 2NT|pg||
nt|hesse: Bakke showing a decent @h raise|pg||
nt|hesse: yes, and the @s break is not much better, so E/W better stay at low level|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  slam-killing 2NT opening bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: Raptor 1NT = 4 card M + 5+ minor|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|yuval10: N should be desciplined and pass here|pg||
nt|pelu: when close I perfer the bid with max presure on opp|pg||
nt|pelu: = 2NT|pg||
nt|jr7: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: An easy 4@h here irrespective of the lead, E can get back in tr to ruff last @d|pg||
nt|yuval10: otherwise he can find himself very quickly in a hopeless 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: make a note - Jørgen agree with me :):)|pg||
nt|hesse: :)|pg||
nt|jr7: never happend again :)|pg||
nt|hesse: Hagen is showing minimum values|pg||
nt|ady: n/s could make 5@D as they lay    but would have to guess diamond position   and club finesse has to be right   so poos contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: i bet he doesnt either , but that is what they gave him|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h probably best from South as his defensive assets are rather poor, else bid 4@d|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pass...|pg||
nt|pelu: 1Nt in N sh show 8-10 - exatly her hand :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: they are into a murky swamp now|pg||
mb|2N|nt|milton_se: hopeless, yes, but a good result|pg||
nt|ady: this is hopless on a heart lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will scare the declarer to death |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: only chance now should be to play for @c Kj in place|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  but systemic for most of the planet|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: in fact I do not see how to make it|pg||
nt|sater1957: 6@c is not *that* good|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: It's not "that" hopeless Yuval... as a spectator said, even with tr lead 4@h makes because of the good @c break so it is a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|yuval10: especially since unoubled|pg||
nt|pelu: I might be wrong, but a @H-lead will defeat 4@h??|pg||
nt|nubmaster: nope, you can play on @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: well usually not too many good things can do when you stretch your hand like N did here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good evening|pg||
nt|pelu: interesting point: what is the weakest bid by E? Pass or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jr7: with @H 4-1 is this not good|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT shud be off 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: very difficult to stay out of game i think|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed - especially VUL |pg||
nt|kemperg: @D K onside is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: you could very well play in 4@h X|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H is -1 or making depends on @D ruff|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: can happen even|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so probably making|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: good morning :)|pg||
nt|hesse: good spot for E/W, should be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hesse: a @c lead may set it|pg||
nt|pelu: my ex partner, Thomas Berg had a rule. when pass is an option its the weakest bid!|pg||
nt|hesse: this may be 2 down at best defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: 4@D wins|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but unlikely after the opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ouch a tiger double?|pg||
nt|sharkey: any explanation of 2@D Andreas?|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: but 2h weaker than 2d|pg||
nt|sybarra: and its not |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  good point|pg||
nt|jr7: 1 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Ehh yes.. But i dont know it :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jr7: I agree with Berg - but Roland means not|pg||
nt|pelu: but over the X of 2@D?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2h is weaker than pass usually|pg||
nt|pelu: FOR SURE ITS AN EASY RULE - EASY TO REMEMBER AND EASY TO FOLLOW|pg||
nt|jr7: I bid 3@D after D|pg||

nt|vugraphzct: Td saying that they have to hurry started to late..|pg||
nt|hesse: good defence by Rimstedt, and Norway is -200 in a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|blum1956: a cold slam for NS but not straightforward to bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably not easy at the table to put the k of @D on the table|pg||
nt|henryb:  straight guess, Shirley|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a decent game for n/s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt on NS|pg||

nt|sharkey: well judged by Maria|pg||

mb|1N|nt|pelu: 4+@H and 5+minor weak|pg||
nt|hesse: Gullberg showing 4 card@h+5+ minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: must be 4@H and longer minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  so much easier from here|pg||
nt|ady: only 21 hcp between them   might not reach game|pg||
nt|yuval10: Mikael used to have a dark hair when i played with him back in the 2008 Orebro Bridgefestivallen, and Ola had a blond. Was easy to differ between them that time :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 30 min: 2 boards :(:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: how many @D will east bid eventually|pg||
nt|sharkey: I note following on the Swedes cc: "Sound openings, 11 HCP balanced is usually passed"...|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3D|nt|pelu: try to type faster :)|pg||
nt|hesse: :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  especially since 2@C wont excite N|pg||
nt|hedyg: drury?|pg||
nt|jr7: maybee 10 tricks in @H - if they play right|pg||
nt|yuval10: not anymore|pg||
nt|pelu: NS will prob bid to 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: I dont know anyone to play that in DK|pg||
nt|hesse: Hagen did not find his hand good enough for 3@c, and I do agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is why we watch junior bridge :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: what rebid do you prefer in north?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so they dont play drury..|pg||
nt|hedyg: why is 2@H alerted ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: last weekend a ladies international teams event was tied because one of the leaders suffered a slow play penalty|pg||
nt|pelu: X sh be takeout here|pg||
nt|sharkey: we'll see if NS are in tune now - agreements in order|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D at red - juniors know no fear|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl is clear cut here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzct: Yes now they are both blond|pg||
nt|pelu: ???|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|sharkey: from our vantage point it is...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzct: No i dont think that there have been any penalties yet|pg||
nt|hesse: Not easy for E/W to win the part score contract|pg||
nt|hesse: ...after 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: hey they are jrs.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: I dont know :) he alerted it so..|pg||
nt|jr7: 8-11|pg||
nt|jr7: and only xxx @H|pg||
nt|kemperg: sensible pass, Chance majors are 41|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has 8 points and may not have been sure - downside may also be minimal|pg||
nt|sharkey: pd may not have Major either...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: how is 3NT? - make on @H or @S leads - @Ds blocked forNS, so a bad contract with a lot of play|pg||
nt|blum1956: if they play 2/1 2@c may be not that disappointing|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  what other than 2@H?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hesse: 4@c showes the void|pg||
nt|ady: some might raise only to 2@H with north hand  with a number of soft value cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this could lead to 2@Cx|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hesse: they may end in slam now|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  recently we had a long discussion on what 2NT should show here in a standard bidding context|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  12-14 or 15-17|pg||
nt|ralfwil: i dont´t like that 2nt on N with only @c10x. 3@d is better|pg||
nt|jr7: I agree|pg||
nt|ralfwil: AQJ is as good as a 4-card support|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D is probably best then S bids 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, not doubled. No trouble then|pg||
nt|roswolf: well if north had doubled at the colours south has a classic pass|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nubmaster: Easy 4@s with probably 4 tricks only|pg||
nt|sybarra: sad news for all of us,  Mike Gold (lestergold) a fellow commentator from England, died yestereay |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: claimed 9|pg||
nt|jr7: easy play|pg||
nt|pelu: she also risk that 3@D making - and gameNS - a pass here is = guessing game :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jr7: 2Cx = 7 tricks (I think)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: for sure the TDs shal push the players - but I still dont understand why the scedule are so gard - only 110 min for 14 boards - international standard = 119 (indl 1 min pr. bords ...|pg||
nt|pelu: with screens) and only 10 min break???|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 2@h alert mas misswrite sry:)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|hesse: with an opening pass in south, som pairs may end in 3NT|pg||

nt|jr7: @H is better|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h2|nt|nubmaster: Agree Peter, these guys and girls are often more unexperienced than 26+ players representing their country in bigger events so give them the time|pg||

nt|jr7: hi|pg||

nt|ralfwil: hi|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  i wonder how 1@Dx or 1@Hx would have done|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 5@c seems  to make here altho hengs on @cK in place..|pg||
nt|jr7: Told ya :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: West had to ditch the @H losers on @S and @CK - overtake @SQ|pg||
nt|pelu: not the best play - could discard 2 @H on black Kings|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|pelu: unlucky for EW if they bid 71D and find @Ds 3-0|pg||
nt|milton_se: unlucky 3-0 break in @Ds sets a good grand|pg||
nt|yuval10: very unlucky grand here|pg||
nt|pelu: N cant play @DJ = 2 discards for @c-losers|pg||
nt|hesse: 1NT= 9-12|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  i very much like this mini NT at this vuln.|pg||
nt|sater1957: THis prob is 3NT, not playing well|pg||
nt|granguru: 1NT is probable the best play here--not easy to stop there|pg||
nt|jr7: I have bid pass on S|pg||
nt|jr7: or 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: ;)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice direct auction there|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: 6@s is enough|pg||
nt|hesse: this opening will help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lol 2 bid auction?|pg||
nt|roswolf: an invite or punt?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pelu: would u bid 1@H in N - for me an easy 1@H - good suit |pg||
nt|nubmaster: I think N will join the bidding|pg||
nt|hesse: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely 3 nt here |pg||
nt|hedyg: and finding @hs|pg||
nt|peachy: The trick is, to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|peachy: or any NT :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: NV - punt...|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: indeed he did|pg||
nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at favourable it is acceptable to give up some bidding precision to make opponent's life tough|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hesse: bold call from west|pg||
nt|blum1956: The defense needs the club lead to beat this|pg||
nt|granguru: 24 combined points and only 6 visiblee tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: a natural invite - hmm a rare bird nowadays|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: what do you think of norths opening bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: fits the system|pg||
nt|pelu: its there system - so..:)|pg||
nt|ady: might get overboard here|pg||
nt|jr7: 2nt must show @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: @D lead = 7 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: 3s better be forcing though, not clear to me it should be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  normal contract reached though|pg||
nt|hesse: and a very aggressive double from north|pg||
nt|jr7: sorry 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 8 if @c guess |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h presumably shows some values|pg||
nt|sharkey: i miscounted - think you have to invite with 9 vs 15-17|pg||
nt|sharkey: just have to locate @CJ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah in my youthful days there was no such thing as an invite|pg||
pc|sT|nt|nubmaster: Only 800 vs 1370, amazing 4@d bid...|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 2 @D sort of slowed everything down |pg||
nt|kemperg: surely with two important 9''\s:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nubmaster: Well, it is juniors...|pg||
nt|ady: slam mainly on diamond finesse and brake|pg||
nt|jr7: He can not win this 3NT - I think so! :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  probably best try is to duck a @C and hope for good breaks elsewhere|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  which of course are not there|pg||
nt|sater1957: I was just wondering if EW, top of their form, can let this make....|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, by either side, actually|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|pelu: N has a passed partner, but still: 4@D for major is not in my book :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: he might regret his 4@d bid if his team-mates bids to the grand on the OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: but of course it's a great result|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But N thought that... (my partner passed and I have 6 p in non vul and 5440... let's make a try to preempt)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Hans this is a good start :)|pg||
nt|jr7: maybee first a small @H from both hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  beer card in first trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: I meant N or S|pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for the @d suit..|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Might get a dbl here..?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT over 2@s would have described the hand perfectly in N|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: and he can complain to pd: u sh have Q10 in @C not in @d :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 3@c @s KQ and J back for @h J ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 1100 then :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Now youre faddish :) But it is correct|pg||
nt|henryb:  and finding a place for declarer's third spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: i assume that 2@H by E shows a good raise in @s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: asking for the minor and the bid @S either F or strong invit depending on agreements|pg||
nt|jr7: 5@C = 1 ace|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  can only count on about 10 HCP from partner, two Aces might not beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: What a waste!|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  gotta be a prize for that too|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  duck a @H next|pg||
nt|granguru: 8 tricks possible now|pg||
nt|sater1957: could this lead to a @h @c squeeze on East?|pg||
nt|granguru: playing @HAK and @D...fouble dummy of course|pg||
nt|granguru: double*|pg||
nt|granguru: now he needs only @C 3-3 to get 9|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  is it that double dummy? W bid @S and led @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think the best play is ducking a @c but will not succed this time|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  what does he have|pg||
nt|jr7: after @D lead he know the hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  duck @C and duck @S - gotta get your loser count right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but W can have a 2-card @c and a stiff @h|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  probably best is to duck TWO @S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  lose 2@D 2@S and turn the table on E|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D rebid kept them out of trouble    some might rebid 3@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: 9s wud be upgraded to game...|pg||
nt|kemperg: you mkust be younger then me:)|pg||
nt|pelu: have to knock out @CA and then finess to N - to keep S out of his long @ss|pg||
nt|roswolf: style over substance - hippys and the summer of love :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|granguru: @S7?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this wasn´t a winning line|pg||
nt|jr7: intra-finess in @H and 3@S maybee 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzct: ohh well..:)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: not now then|pg||
nt|hedyg: who will let them play 3@s?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: wd|pg||
nt|hesse: good spot for N/S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok excellent auction|pg||
nt|blum1956: still may switch to clubs|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  there isnt really one because you need EW help to rectify the count|pg||
nt|jr7: no one :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hesse: I would not have doubled with a pd showing 9-12|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @HK and play a @D?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: duplicated across the field no doubt (not)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|pelu: pass in N and 2@C by S not so easy|pg||
nt|granguru: dont forget S does not know opponents exact distribution ...he can still expect @C 3-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  after the @D lead its safe to assume that is not the case|pg||
nt|granguru: it is against odds I agree|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  another @S seems best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some players use Lebensohl (2NT) in these auctions. That has a weakness in that if opener raises responder's suit, it can be awkward for the defence to sort out which suit they ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: have and whether to bid on or not      |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  @C 3-3?|pg||
nt|kemperg: ??|pg||
nt|roswolf: age memories:)|pg||
nt|pelu: S tryed to make a "smart" defense, but with @Cq in dummy?? |pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: in standard 2c by south and later splinter by north accomplishes the same|pg||
nt|kemperg: no clue why|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: doesnt need a place for 3rd sp |pg||
pc|s3|nt|Gerben42:  W cant lead @S back so will turn on @H|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another diamond....|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jr7: No more @S|pg||
nt|pelu: place sweden Ew then Pass i N and 2@H in East - and then bid trouble for NS|pg||
nt|pelu: 1 more is Ok - can still ruff 2 x@C and discard on @DAK|pg||
nt|jr7: I dont think he will win - @D 4-3 and @C 5-3 or catch @DJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: has to ruff 2 clubs and tak pitches before drawing rest of trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: he will make - a bet? :) a coke?|pg||
nt|jr7: Y|pg||
nt|fabsayc: make mine bourbon and coke|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  very close contract - down 1|pg||
nt|hesse: but well defended, and 200 instead of 100 for Sweden :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: should play a spade in order to create an illusion|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim now|pg||
nt|pelu: just a gift to decl|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  why?|pg||
nt|sybarra: he got a spade lead and has 3 sp tricks|pg||
nt|ady: hearts were 3-3   and jack could have been doubleton|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer not claiming?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Gerben42:  then you play @D|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|hesse: Sweden won 11 imps on their good 6@s in board 17|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: not that it will matter|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jr7: V has only 13 cards - dont play @C|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkey: why is East wasting time - cant get rid of @D loser - Next...|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ady: also chances of a club trick    apart from the opening spade lead   and a possible opening heart lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: win some time:(|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hesse: and they are now ahead|pg||
nt|hesse: west have to play @d to the 10 now, but that will fail|pg||
nt|blum1956: If South has a club less and a spade more the contract could come home. But it may be 2 off if declarer plays for that distribution|pg||
nt|hesse: west probably counting points now, and find that south has to have @dK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|blum1956: No reason for the diamond finesse, the @dK being with South for sure|pg||
nt|hesse: yes|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|sybarra: wonder if 2 @C is drury bid, or if clubs |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Maria's and Matias System|pg||
nt|hedyg: great! ty Andreas :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the real game try - let the man TRY to make it|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: the alert on 1@S = 9+ black cards|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3NT might work, probably a @h lead from S and then it's diffucult to defeat|pg||
nt|nubmaster: difficult|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D very favorable|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: with 4-4 in @c+@s East has to rebid 1NT - not my style, but very popular  among some "experts"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: plenty of work to do even after i heart lead i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Was not alerted so..|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: problebly @c|pg||
nt|jr7: what now - 4@D color or cue?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: No alert.. but then again it is on 4'th level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: We all know people who would bid 2@h as South over 1@s |pg||
nt|vugraphzct: To high now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jr7: 5@H could be very wrong - gambling :)|pg||
nt|pelu: @DA and @d will cost NS a number|pg||
nt|ady: spades kind so should do well|pg||
nt|hedyg: can you get NS as well?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Hagen was about to lead when pd did it ;)|pg||
nt|sater1957: This is with screens, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: yes|pg||
nt|granguru: N hand is worth 25 points..If 2NT is a nat bid, it does not make honor to it... |pg||
nt|sater1957: Thyen alerts above 3NT also need to be made|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: those guys are aggressive alright|pg||
nt|sharkey: this shud make - lose 2@C and a @D|pg||
nt|pelu: why 2 @Cs?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: Aggression is ok if you have something to be aggressive with |pg||
nt|mdgraham: like a large stick, for example |pg||
pc|h6|nt|granguru: Said...|pg||
nt|granguru: the 2NT produced this disaster|pg||
nt|roswolf: the power of the beer card|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sater1957: South's call is slighly pessimistic, but as it happens rightly so on this hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  welcome Hans - if the computer makes mad distributions - it's Hans' fault as he wrote one of the most used computer dealing programs in the world|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: in my opp u mis some @s-partscores and the gain is very ??|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: may well make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jr7: Raulund shows 22+|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: sry - 1 @C|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hesse: 2@d is a bit too hard when @d K is 3 of 9 points yes, but with the points elsewhere south may show a good raise|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/CCSS.pdf|pg||
nt|jr7: 2@C is invit - 3@S is too hard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: was that Roosevelt? - speak softly and carry a big stick |pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|nt|jr7: 4 clubloosers|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Gerben42:  South was spot on with 2@H, I would have guessed N might bid again |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|granguru: it was then s mistake|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s6|mc|11|nt|vugraphzct: Ohh well.. you found it :)|pg||

nt|hesse: north maybe passed due to all the small @ds?|pg||
nt|hesse: but surely worth a gameinvite|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 9.. He claimed wrong.. and so did i:)|pg||
nt|sater1957: South probably thought 4NT was minimum|pg||
nt|granguru: if 2@D doesnt show a positive hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT was a bit on the heavy side..|pg||
nt|jr7: sorry - yes|pg||

nt|roswolf: more fun |pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C or 3 NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|nubmaster: N "knows" that W cannot have 6c @d with KQJxxx and also the ace of @s |pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 4@H where S "forgot" to tahe @SA - 11 imp for Norway - sh have been +5 for Sweden - sp @sA to 16 IMP :)|pg||
nt|hesse: yes, Norway played 3@c-1|pg||
nt|hesse: Norway stopped in 6@s in open room|pg||
nt|jr7: normaly must say 2@D|pg||
nt|sater1957: come on, defend one....|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  apparently the story of the grand slam on the 4-2 fit is no longer online|pg||
nt|jr7: 8 tricks in 2@S|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C 1@S 3@C P, 3@S P 3NT?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Gerben42:  now we can ask if N should raise - I say no|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: "Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far". Theodore Roosevelt, Chicago, 1903 |pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, did his very best|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|hesse: (board 5)|pg||
nt|jr7: why not 2@D in N|pg||
nt|sater1957: not if the last board is an indication|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: and a 13 imp gain for the grand slam|pg||
nt|granguru: NS might win 3NT here|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|fabsayc: vul and no singleton, bad bid :)|pg||
nt|hesse: I think pass is the best bid in north|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  did W penalty pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  wow N will like this|pg||
nt|sater1957: all the more reason for North not to raise :-)|pg||
nt|granguru: 5@D 2@S and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|granguru: with a lucky lie of the cards....|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  might stay in 2@Sx also|pg||
nt|sater1957: Can go two down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Dbl must show a penalty pass of 1@H|pg||
nt|granguru: which will permit them to win 3@D 2@S and 2@C now in defense|pg||
nt|jr7: I dont think Dbl mens @H - he bid 2@C - after pas - Yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: N must compete to 2@s, he knows about the 8 cards fit|pg||
nt|yuval10: not that defending will be so bad for NS either...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2!Q = 20-21 bal|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Gerben42:  quite a view, @H65 are not good intermediates|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  still this is not made yet|pg||
nt|blum1956: I would have preferred 2NT with West's hand|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  looks ok for n/s  but will have to contend with a bad side suit split|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= 6+ @ss or 17+ any|pg||
nt|roswolf: science being applied|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@C|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C = 20+|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|sybarra: and bad @D breaka as well |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzct: Td saying we are passed half time mark..|pg||
nt|hesse: @s lead had probably been better|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay|pg||
nt|jr7: OK - 1 nt Better :)|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|Gerben42:  btw its in spanish but here is the story from Helgemo & Groetheim: http://jredard.blogspot.com/2008/06/grand-slam-en-el-fit-4-2.html|pg||
nt|granguru: but they must hurry their tricks in order not to give W the chance to  discard on @HK|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957: West put himself in a problem: calling 1NT, or optimistically 2NT at first round would solve his problem|pg||
nt|ady: the good news is that east will be ruffing with 3 trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm dont like the upgrade|pg||
nt|kemperg: I do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jr7: it crashes abyway|pg||
nt|granguru: juan pablo redard is a chilean player|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok , everybody knows W did NOT lead from the Q@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's good enough|pg||
nt|pelu: @S to J and @hJ back = first 5 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think north may progress|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think many would rebid 2 NT after 1@C - 1@S with Soth's hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: :(|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Gerben42:  3NT is making EW|pg||
nt|pelu: ned to take @SK to win|pg||
nt|roswolf: all comes down to finesses|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: yes, that's enough bidding|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jr7: anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 2@c 2 @s to lose...nice lead by East either way|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kemperg: 59 Kleinmann points = a good 19|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Not home yet|pg||
nt|kemperg: too good for a 2NT rebid in my system|pg||
nt|sharkey: and then guess where to get 9th trick from - @D finesse or @HA favorable|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 x @C and follow the discards - some information|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: He was afraid of @h tru his hand so should play for @d Q then|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - West likely to pitch @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: cash out a few winners shrug your shoulders and take the finesse like a man and :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: another @h to @dJ|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The evening match at 19.30 local time will be Denmark U25 vs Sweden U20|pg||
nt|granguru: an uppercut might be produced here|pg||
nt|jr7: he play small from table|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and N will discard|pg||
nt|granguru: but N must discard a @C if W ruffs high|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after @dAK play @hQ and discard...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: E squeezed|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|blum1956: NS with their 16 PC may probably make 4@h while for EW  8 tricks in spades is a top|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt anybody can get to a slam with the EW hands|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: should just get home  though could make an overtrick ruff finessing the 3rd round of spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: does N get out with club now? or ? |pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer will make his contract easily|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: even if small @d i think he would finesse|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: Opening 1NT it will be difficult|pg||
nt|jr7: why not 1@C -> 2@D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hesse: DJ in @h is not worth much for E/W in this deal|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c3|pc|h6|nt|hedyg: when both opps are preempting you have very space to find your tricks in|pg||
nt|jr7: it is very wrong to open 1NT on that hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: GREAT Defence here!|pg||
nt|peachy: Indeed, however, opening a control-rich 5-4 and maximum with 1NT seldom is right|pg||

nt|roswolf: @dK TO 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@S by east looks the bid|pg||
nt|pelu: some would bid 4@C (splinter) but west only have 1 real H-card|pg||
nt|roswolf: being a junior it is automatic|pg||

nt|hedyg: tststs  Andi, are you partial?|pg||
nt|hedyg: she will lead..........the A@S!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|peachy: W had nothing to say, and E vulnerable against not.  Normallyu the hand with shortness in their suit has to be aggressive, but here, passing is normal, too risky to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Partial? i dont know.. im not rooting for anyone... but you must admit.. It would be cool to see perfect defence again:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: SOUTH WILL LEAD 1 OF HIS ACES I THINK|pg||
mb|5S|nt|fabsayc: whatever 3@C is, i dont like it|pg||

nt|pelu: but Carl - he dont need to find @HK - there are just 12 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||

nt|sharkey: of course |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a later @d bid will show a stronger 2-suiter as I bid|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|athene: maybe 3@C = any minimum? that's quite common these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the hand is not minimum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 54 automatically one extra trick|pg||
nt|athene: true, but as far as slam potential goes it's pretty bad, with those minor suits|pg||
nt|ady: club lead ducked best|pg||
nt|yuval10: 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|roswolf: sneaky|pg||
nt|pelu: still only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: with 6 @Ss W could have bid 6 now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hesse: if 3@c=minimum, then north has to have a better bid over 3@d|pg||
nt|jr7: yes, but 2 x Qx is not the best|pg||

nt|yuval10: some pairs who plays 2/1 prefer playing 2@c as 2+ , whereas 2@d is 5+|pg||

nt|mdgraham: oh well|pg||

nt|roswolf: another tiger double|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3 aces and1 king was enough on the last board|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be an endplay on S - x may give clue|pg||
pc|s9|nt|nubmaster: Good|pg||
nt|pelu: after 4. suit (for me GF) 3Nt is the weakest bid in the book (11-12)|pg||
nt|hesse: I normally prefer 2NT as the stronger hand after 4th suit |pg||
nt|jr7: so must 4.color = game|pg||
nt|pelu: tes|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: Sabine Auken's advice is to bid 2C over their 1D whenever it is remotely possible, few partnerships are well equipped to bid over that|pg||
nt|jr7: @DQ ??? - now they can clean the other colors|pg||
nt|jr7: sorry - no|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: im guessing @d ace was a downer on his minimum hand..|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But dont understand W's 4NT bid with 4333, what has he shown first two rounds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 2nt showed 14+|pg||
nt|hesse: but my prefered system makes my rebid 2@s after the @h response to show reverse with this distribution|pg||
nt|pelu: when u play WJS (weak jump shift) - here 2@H first time, then 3@H would be forcing and a better bid for Ns hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: i think only 27 minuts left for these 5 boards not sure tho..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C only slam that makes|pg||
nt|pelu: only slam with a chance is 6@C, but - as I se - a @S lead will defeat|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the idea is to knock out late entry to dummy, yes spade leads beat 6@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: really?|pg||
nt|sharkey: hmmm|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Oh, I see, only 14+ vs a GF 2-over-1 bid I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: ya|pg||
nt|hesse: south makes a practical bid, but he will probably go down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  you think Hamman would have bid 1@S - 2@S again 50 years ago?|pg||
nt|sater1957: no ruffs for EW, this should come in|pg||
pc|c9|nt|nubmaster: Then I agree with his last slamtry|pg||
nt|athene: might make on a major-suit squeeze against west|pg||
nt|athene: ....ok, or on a diamond lead :)|pg||
nt|jr7: UPS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|blum1956: diabolic lead! Now the trump switch beats the contract|pg||
nt|granguru: @DK instead of @CK would have been better|pg||
nt|granguru: and the 4333 pattern diminishes S hand value as I am correctly told|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like -1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry -2|pg||
nt|jr7: he had to find the Lady|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think W is really a minimum for a 4@d bid|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yuval10: and if you're making a slam against a mere minimum....|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|hedyg: was it 2@c over 1@d only or any suit?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: usually you lead passively against 6nt but perhaps there was a case for an active lead here with dummy known to have a trick source in hearts|pg||
nt|hesse: Hagen with a very aggressive and unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|athene: but still south insisting on notrumps he really has to have a double diamond stopper|pg||
nt|sharkey: makes now...|pg||
nt|roswolf: well  |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|peachy: Over 1D|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he was afraid of the hearts but i think there were clues to normal passive lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CK first|pg||
nt|roswolf: no needed to cash the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: He should have drawed @c  K to win|pg||
nt|roswolf: club exit is very obvious|pg||
nt|roswolf: why the thought?|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR decl in trick 2 played @D10 from dummy to King and S then had 2 exit-cards in@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: south is likely to do the wrtong thing if he thinks for much longer|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: but the pace of play is far too slow - |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  too late now but nice move by Gundesen|pg||
nt|hesse: yes, he found the magic lead|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry small @D to J and later @D to 10 and @HJ to king - and was endplayed to open @Cs from hand - not the best play when S has overcalled|pg||

nt|peachy: The power of controls again (Aces and kings and good suits)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nubmaster: A fairly good tr and points in only two suits will often be better in tr play|pg||

nt|nubmaster: In fact the decl only finessed @h ONCE Peter on the 6@s board... amazing, he had entries|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but lead comes thru strong hand & 5332 is not that good for suit play, and your outside queen is in pds suit so maybe 4-5 tricks ther|pg||
nt|jr7: who has @CQ|pg||

mb|1N|nt|nubmaster: Correct Marshall but it was a beautiful play in the other room, elimitated @cs and @hs and opps tr and then played K of @s fron N... E was endplayed... wery well done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 5D can be  beaten if E unblocks trump king under ace? entry issues....anyway unlikely plays w/o DD access:)|pg||
nt|milton_se: anyone more than me who dislikes X?|pg||
nt|hesse: so the match tightens up|pg||
nt|hedyg: transfer bid|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand now, second half begins shortly, scheduled in 20 minutes http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|jr7: 2nt = @H|pg||
nt|jr7: I think|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jr7: maybee 4 loosers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might make on this lead|pg||
nt|hesse: @h is not a good lead, you cant expect your pd to have @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: 6@s is a very good slam.. either you missing an ace and have to finesse for @s Q or you missing @s KQ and only need them not to sit Kqx behins ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the possibility of that  line is why i said at the outset that NS have a lucky game here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: vwd indeed|pg||
nt|granguru: so Norway took the lead now by 6 imps|pg||
nt|peachy: sorry, 14 is last. Where is that coffee when I need it :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: N pass: no @c fit ?|pg||
nt|pelu: try again Andreas :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957: 3@c, junior bridge|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe he doesnt believe his eyes, partner shows hearts and he is staring ar AKJ109|pg||
nt|peachy: just kidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Shows xx in @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Andi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: probably double dummy though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yikes|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like more than 50%, especially after the 3@h|pg||
nt|jr7: had to play @s from home|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: sry..|pg||
nt|pelu: np|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: Andres, do  we have a site for results?|pg||
nt|granguru: this hand should be a tie|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: i confess i would bid 3N rather than X|pg||
nt|milton_se: any day in the week|pg||
nt|pelu: I am glad that this is 2. last board - back to the 5@D : very well played and very diff to defeat - sleep well - I do :)|pg||
nt|granguru: good lead|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  Looks like a probable down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c looks like  a @d cue IF 2NT was @cs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jr7: 2 x A but nor Q|pg||
nt|yuval10: both players in W go "by the book" , they missed a key-card and the Q of trump so they stopped in 5|pg||
nt|jr7: not Q|pg||
pc|dT|nt|nubmaster: Agree Marshall... pass or 3NT in a sunny day|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe i'd pass at my funeral, but facing a PH it could certainly be the winner:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cannot go wrong in @s|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: too many hearts, danger dummy wins for pitch, the reason for the preempt|pg||
nt|roswolf: still 1 bd to play|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: west very quiet here    might have offered red card|pg||
nt|jr7: they cant hurt the contrakt|pg||
nt|hedyg: so a quiet push|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|nubmaster: hahaha|pg||
nt|sater1957: difficult to score better than -2 I would guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  -2 would be a success with this dummy wont you think|pg||
nt|sater1957: Exactly|pg||
nt|sater1957: but heart finess on, A@S bare ...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  i was thinking 2@C-2 but it's 3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  trumps 3-3|pg||
nt|henryb:  and seen them run to 2@h?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|granguru: s goes again with the odds playing a @C honor from dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: OR bad result on 24 - 3NT-1|pg||
nt|yuval10: E being too practical with the 3NT bid... don't need to rush|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|nubmaster: in the other room East ducked first @c so K and A fell on second one for +3 in 3NT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: yes...with 6430 shape, West might have removed it |pg||
pc|s3|nt|milton_se: 3NT often makes even when it's chanceless with open cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: going back to 5D, declarer did play nicely but the real star was E, who according to the hand record did indeed go up with D king on first round of suit. when declarer won this in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dummy, contract can now be defeated. W needed to led nine of spades but continued hearts|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: u are right - but decl can duck @DK - so 51D is cold :)|pg||
nt|hesse: the @h switch may give Sweden some well deserved imps|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nobody likes this defense, to the point of SHOUTING|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub17/Turneringer/KampResultat925.html  site for results|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: when E played D king , declarer needed to duck....really have nothing to losde by doing so and nothing to gain by winning ace. so declarer's performance was flawed...only E rang ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the bell|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: yes, right, my point was that if hand record is accurate then it is E who deserves the primary kudos on the hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: now the last board |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|granguru: best is @D and @D |pg||
pc|s4|nt|hesse: probably -4|pg||
nt|granguru: now @C|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jr7: well played|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s6|nt|hesse: I guess Flått will get a bidding lesson from the captain before the next match|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pelu: fore sure, but the play of !K = endplay om East also very nice|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: @sK|pg||
nt|ady: e/w should certainly either be playing the hand or doubling opps with their values|pg||
nt|granguru: now declarer depends on @S split|pg||
nt|granguru: claim time|pg||
pc|s8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: So.. This will be the last board of the match and the last board for today!|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|nubmaster: But if you decide to bid 4@d then probably 5@c will works and it did on this deal|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last hand of the segment |pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks all, nice work Andreas|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: x now for a push?|pg||
nt|ady: suppose +200  for e/w was a reasonable scorfe   and a good one in the light of their team mates pick up 100|pg||

mb|1S|nt|yuval10: thanks all|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: Bakke showing 3 card @h|pg||
nt|jr7: 1 looser in each color in 4@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|granguru: EW will not arrive at 4@H here |pg||
nt|granguru: which is in fact an exagerated contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: 2@h weaker @s raise then 2@d it lookes like..|pg||
nt|yuval10: good judgment by the Swede EW to reach 3NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: thx to andres our brilliant operator.  great job  |pg||
nt|hedyg: as well to my fellow commentors Raija and Joergen for donating their time and sharing their wisdom :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks Hedy!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: interesting gamble by S, whose limited values he knows will all be working|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Well N get punished for his micro opening in vul vs nonvul...|pg||
nt|sater1957: NS have no reason to do anything wild, so probably no slam|pg||
nt|jr7: very good start - he looked enemies card :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: E/W will probably end in @d at the 4 level|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are running a bit late. The second half is supposed to start in 2 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: p-----a---s----s|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks for joining us, we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|jr7: 4@C and 4@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can't defeat 3NT with that lay of the cards, it seem|pg||
mb|d|nt|hesse: this match will end with a comfortable victory to the swedes|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes a victory but lots of swings - exciting junior bridge|pg||
nt|jr7: a red squeeze against N = 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: tiger double again -  3 this session....|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: punishment is +3|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Henry and David, my co commentators.  We appreciate your insights |pg||
nt|ady: 5@D a decent save   though 5@S makes|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru: @H return is confusing|pg||

nt|peachy: Spectators were awfully quiet today, please remember that the commentators are here only for you, messages and questions are welcome!|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Last session today|pg||

pc|d4|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs, of offer advice and humor  |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|nubmaster: But 5@h from S was that clever either... as Marshall said... mor elike a gambling, hoping to get the bonus in vul|pg||
nt|sater1957: brrr....|pg||
nt|granguru: great plays by Simonsen|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@c looks challenging as opposite to 3NT|pg||
nt|hesse: @s ace onside helps|pg||
nt|sater1957: might just make, but is iffy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unblock?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jr7: he must play @h now - yes|pg||
pc|d7|nt|nubmaster: wasn't|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3 ways to win by bidding|pg||
nt|hesse: this contract need careful play|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hesse: spade continuation is probably best for the defence|pg||
nt|granguru: another @C and an uppercut for the defensive hand of the year|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
