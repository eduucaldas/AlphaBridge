nt|Walddk2: right|pg||
nt|woozle: fair 4H here|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|pelu: a good board - in bidding (problem with 3@d) and the unic@sueeze position to set up @D7|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva doesn't regard it as a barrier to opening that he has neither a hand nor a suit|pg||

nt|woozle: sorry they didn't stop in 2S then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last Lars made a mistake was in 1994, so we'll forgive him|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: I'm entering the results of the closed room manually - entered it for open by mistake|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: But they did play 2@s in the closed room|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Disappointing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am fairly sure I can guess the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pass  1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S  2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play 4-card hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45: One can hardly imagine a bidding sequence ending up in 2 @S|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|pelu: Idont like to support on 3 card when I have a very normal 2@C bid|pg||
nt|hawe45: In that sequence, South has a clear-cut 3 @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We know, Peter, and I am with you here|pg||

mb|1D|nt|woozle: I prefer (strongly) 2S with this shape and a minimum...I must show the fit at some point|pg||
nt|woozle: With a stronger hand, 2C then 2S is fine|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but when u pass in S u are free to bid more that 1 time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but South was stuck as they play 5443|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|hawe45: DK will hope for 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|woozle: With south a passed hand, passing 1S is fine|pg||
nt|woozle: Fagerlund's skewed 3C overcall will strike gold...NS can make 5C (but not 4H)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if they have 15 cards. No, 5443 stands for opening with 5 spades, 4 hearts, 4 diamonds and 3 clubs (only with 4333)|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|Walddk2: 16 cards even|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hawe45: You want 500?|pg||
nt|woozle: 800 if you like|pg||
nt|pelu: after 2@S from N he can have 4-4 in major or 3-5 as here - in both cased S can bid 3@H over 2@S wth almost an opening hand|pg||
nt|woozle: h, ruff, c, h ruff, spade to come|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are E-W on the same wavelength I wonder|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: If 3@D is a hand like this, 5@D is silly at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: One points out, that 800 is possible. - but one loser in each suit should be all|pg||
nt|woozle: Mortensen needs a beast of a hand to make 5D, and this is a poor vulnerability to bid things you don't intend making|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva's good 4D bid permits Fagerlund to double 5D|pg||
nt|woozle: With two aces, Orkoneva should be happy with this development|pg||
nt|woozle: making 5H or 6C is farfetched|pg||
nt|pelu: can go for 800 - if only 500 Ok with the chance to push NS in 6@cs = -2 / +10|pg||
mb|6C|nt|pelu: see!|pg||
mb|d|nt|woozle: Orkoneva, who won the auction with his last bid, loses it with this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why do you think 5@D was bid? To make?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: What a brave 5 @D-bid from Maria...!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45: Will she find the defence...?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Results merchant!!|pg||
nt|woozle: For Mortensen, 5DX is a dreadful position - -500 can be against a failing game. Only the opponents' appalling judgement saved her|pg||
nt|hawe45: Probably this boeard might switch some medals...|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem for S is that he expect a weaker hand and 7 card @C by partner - N should have bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will pretend that I did not see that|pg||
nt|woozle: North is at favourable, so expecting seven is absurd. And north did double 5D - and 6C is almost certainly down|pg||
nt|hawe45: @C-lead out of question - so odds are 2-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I fear a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leaning back .....|pg||
nt|pelu: what wrong with 2@C over 1@D?|pg||
nt|hawe45: I would lead the @S Queen, asking partner to take the @D Ace (also...)|pg||
nt|woozle: The horrible thing about this board is that somebody will score well for terrible bidding...we just don't know who yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's junior bridge for you, never a dull moment|pg||
nt|pelu: a @D cant cost|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm feeling really old here|pg||
nt|hawe45: The double was a BIG mistak!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|woozle: any assertions about which suit "can't cost" are ridiculous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: phew|pg||
nt|woozle: might be vital to cash two spades, or two hearts, or to cut down ruffs|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

nt|hawe45: 430 is a good result for N/S here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|woozle: Orkoneva starts with 1NT, a mild underbid with the good controls and good five card suit|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Mortensen's best start is the ST, and I think it's suggested by the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, a major after 1NT  3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Major-lead anytime from the West-hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|woozle: Dummy is unlikely to have a major, but could have a lot of cards in one or both minors|pg||
nt|hawe45: Normally such a lead costs the contract|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|woozle: Mortensen ignores the warning signs and leads a diamond...at least it doesn't directly cost a trick|pg||
nt|pelu: @S9 would be my lead|pg||
nt|woozle: To appreciate the true horror of the lead, notice how bad a club lead would have been...and there's no reason to hope for longer  diamonds than clubs opposite|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As you please, but a spade|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: If @S9 promises the 10, then fine|pg||
pc|s4|nt|woozle: Rohrberg switches to a spade, but from the wrong side|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not playing with Peter Gill you aren't|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|woozle: I've never downgraded a hand out of a strong notrump, but this South hand might be it|pg||
nt|pelu: a slam on finess of @sK - bid by Sweden (6NT) so they didnt miss 2 keycards|pg||
nt|woozle: I think we've worked out what about that situation is different|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|woozle: Fagerlund is worth a try...I play 1NT:2H,2S:4NT as quantitive - perfect!|pg||

nt|woozle: Orkoneva should stop bidding as soon as she's allowed to|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45: Fast board|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|d|an|3!s|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The textbooks recommend that you pass 1@C; there must be something wrong|pg||
nt|woozle: Fagerlund finds the featherweight response...Orkoneva is grateful to the 2D overcall which simplified his rebid|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|woozle: The textbooks are wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Textbooks say 6+ for a response|pg||
nt|woozle: Only Granovetter tip worth reading - never pass your partner's 1C at favourable|pg||
mb|3D|nt|woozle: That's an error in the textbooks - a far better way to describe it is "6 points is the amount with which you must respond"|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Did his hand improve after 3@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 small ones in East's suit|pg||
nt|woozle: Do you think that North had not described the full majesty of his hand?|pg||
nt|pelu: agree with 3@s by N - only game if S can bid 4@s|pg||
nt|hawe45: No - but South first showed 3-card support, then received the message from North: I am weak - ant THEN overbid on the 3-level. Now North must bid 4 @S  |pg||

mb|4N|nt|Walddk2: Well, 2NT would also have been forcing. Some play that 3@D is passable, and others play Ingberman 2NT|pg||

mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|woozle: Rohrberg starts with an unlovely 1H overcall, Mortensen with a meek pass (to be fair, nothing fits), and Fagerlund reopens with 1S. I think that reopening is heavily antipercentage ...|pg||
nt|woozle: - partner had an easy opportunity to show spades over 1H, so spade fits will be very rare.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you have 2 events going, Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: I dislike 2@c - surely pd isn't balanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Overall and among U25's|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: then he would dbl|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|woozle: Mortensen, who apparently hasn't seen her partner's overcalls before, takes an unlawful push to 2H and buys it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She has seen plenty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: even on 10xxxx|pg||
nt|pelu: so S can almost see his partner with 4-3-5-1|pg||

nt|hawe45: J x x x x is maximum quality under the youngsters|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|woozle: North should be much better than this to reopen holding three hearts. Either partner has heart length or rubbish - either way defending looks recommended|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c6|nt|hawe45: But you do´nt pass 1 @H against juniors - you invite them to bid 2 @H...|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|hawe45: 1 @S by North is to say to your partner. I better bid your cards also...!|pg||
nt|woozle: so, what sort of hand with spades are you expecting to buy opposite?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hawe45: The answer is: A hand with 26 cards|pg||
pc|h8|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||

nt|woozle: No reason for Rohrberg to panic here - North kind of needs the heart ace for his opening, so 4351 at most - diamond ruff will live|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3NT is the practical bid|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Now he hopes 4NT is natural|pg||
nt|pelu: last stop?|pg||
nt|hawe45: He should not have thought before 3 @D - he should not have bid it|pg||
nt|woozle: sounds farfetched to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and maybe 4NT *should* be a sign off|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: 4nt is natural in my book|pg||
nt|woozle: This is a good case for a forcing 2NT - East really did care if his partner had six spades or five hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: Maria alerts 4nt now|pg||
mb|5C|an|1 ace|nt|Walddk2: 4NT is natural if not preceded by a cuebid|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Dreadful auction|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|woozle: over a natural 2NT, you know that your partner is really bidding out shape - they don't have to make up a bid with no stopper|pg||

nt|woozle: start with 1NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzcv: and if you have the @hJ?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|woozle: same. or force to game like a man. Stopping in 2NT is a poor thing to aspire to.|pg||
nt|woozle: sorry to any non-men who are offended by that last line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT is something you bid, not a place to play|pg||
nt|woozle: This is easier in a strong notrump framework|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How often did you make exactly 8 tricks in 2NT?|pg||
nt|woozle: 2NT is like Heathrow - it's somewhere you travel through, not somewhere you plan on ending up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I beg your pardon|pg||

nt|Walddk2: why?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can't he play a trump now?|pg||
nt|woozle: does leave him a little short of tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But then South is squeezed without the count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: if Fagerlund wins and plays a trump back|pg||
nt|woozle: south pitches two diamonds, but then a diamond trick can be established|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: A squeeze without the count then|pg||
