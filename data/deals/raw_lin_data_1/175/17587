pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|andyv:  @h to Q, @d to A and @h to J, then play 3 rounds of @cs and ruff|pg||
nt|patricck: 10 Imps to PD from Board 22, the difference is now 34|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: i wouldnt fancy this as declarer|pg||
nt|cicus: good lead, one entry taken away|pg||
nt|cicus: unless E takes this with the ace|pg||
nt|cicus: which also has its problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: he can play on clubs and still make it ..|pg||
nt|roswolf: if he plays on clubs he has an easy 9 tricks but he has alternatives|pg||
nt|ady: can certainly make knowing the hands    but no clear cut line|pg||
nt|cicus: shall he play @CA small @C?|pg||
nt|ady: how would he play on clubs   ace and another?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: I like A and @C more so that S has Kx and you want him on lead ;) |pg||
nt|cicus: what if S throws @CK under the A?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no small club ducked all round is better i think -he has no entry worries to his hand|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|kemperg: will do that, they play well|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: absolutely correct line andy :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: this is ok since the 9 falls - but didnt need to be|pg||

nt|cicus: to create a problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: very interesting hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: very difficult for the declarer for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: most hands are interesting - getting them right is difficult but instructive|pg||
nt|andyv:  but not done:)|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: lol:)|pg||

nt|roswolf: this wont help their cause|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm sure South won't like his quacks, but hard not to bid with that shape|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like a push - W has 7 top tricks and 2 more - natural came in majors |pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  I wonder in what system|pg||
nt|patricck: if you can throw a @H after setting up a @D, then the fortunate @C position might be enough|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  here, they may find 6@s|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, very true|pg||
nt|r_tibre: right.. and can be reasonably sure the contract will be duplicated|pg||
pc|hA|nt|shevek: entries might be a problem for declarer|pg||
pc|h3|nt|patricck: In the other room they failed because they never led a club to the 19 while they were in hand|pg||
nt|patricck: a club to the 10 :)|pg||
nt|shevek: clear cut :)|pg||
nt|patricck: I just made the game a whole lot harder.... 19 cards per suit :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4-1 break should doom it|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|vugraphzku: brave 1NT overcall |pg||

nt|vugraphzku: 14 sry|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT vul with 14 HCP - and what a success!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes earnt a swing for his team|pg||
nt|ady: can really fault the lead    unforunate|pg||
nt|cicus: on a major suit lead 4 tricks difference|pg||
nt|roswolf: the die seems cast|pg||
nt|cicus: simply incredible, that 1NT - it would not occur to me even after thinking a week|pg||
nt|roswolf: cometh the hour cometh the man|pg||
nt|patricck: North's values being KQ@C and one other card are the worst possible from declarer's point of view|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  and 6@h has no play|pg||
nt|andyv:  flannery people (Roland's favorite opening), would have to problem getting to 6@s|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kemperg: NS in OR will be pleased with the result|pg||
nt|andyv:  so despite missing game and slam, Poddar will get imps out of this|pg||
pc|cK|nt|shevek: I think he'll make it|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: to bid that at this time takes a lot of courage|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for now, it's hard to imagine NS can do something|pg||

nt|andyv:  it's reflexive to duck, the A@h but I can't see where it's beneficial to do that.|pg||
nt|patricck: oops, we never got to that stage because Shrikant have just gained 11 on board 24|pg||
nt|patricck: so 6 to PD, but 11 to Shrikant and the lead is 39|pg||
nt|patricck: 41 even|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good vul for sac|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need a @S lead for make EW down at 6|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sfoxa:  but in practice they will rather land in 3NT, like next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Agree|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  moreover, S has to get inspired for leading @s K after E opening|pg||
mb|3N|nt|patricck: oic, only 1 down in 3 hearts for 4 imps..... busy typing and missed something in the play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: vuln multi|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 3N has play here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  can't touch this|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: 8 imp to poddar :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  should win the A@c and play K@h|pg||
nt|shevek: 13 imps to Shrikant in bd 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  so, should be one more push after nornal @h lead|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|kemperg: OK|pg||

pc|c2|nt|patricck: one would think so|pg||

nt|roswolf: @CJ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: everyone wonders about the meaning of 3@H even Mihov :) |pg||
nt|cicus: small club, deblock @CJ|pg||
nt|shevek: if the contract was 6@d that is|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cicus: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: Mihov said that it should offer partner a choice between 3NT and 4@S|pg||
nt|cicus: but even then @Ds can be played into the safe hand|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D could be made    but  needs luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 3 finesses ? :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzku: and @S break :)|pg||
nt|shevek: there are some problems with the comparison|pg||
nt|r_tibre: that should nail it for Shrikant|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|shevek: 3NT has chances here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|patricck: take the @C finesse now and claim|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|ady: dont think heart finesse needed in a diamond contract the with spades easily set up|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|shevek: maybe take the @s finesse now|pg||
nt|patricck: very odd @H play in the other room that led to declarer going down|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|doks: strong @C here|pg||

nt|vugraphzku: they are discussing the board with a @C lead|pg||
nt|shevek: they did well to bid 6@h here|pg||
nt|shevek: very poor slam|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm....that is one way of looking at....I'd prefer to say that they were lucky to make an anti-percentage slam|pg||
nt|shevek: on the @h finesse and 3-2|pg||
nt|patricck: no, it isn't quite as bad as that because the @H pips give you extra chances|pg||
nt|patricck: K@H onside, or J10@H onside|pg||
nt|patricck: run the 9@H to begin with and then finesse the Q@H the second time|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 6 comparisons to go, and 48 to recover|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or so, indeed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this one looks better for kibs|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ady: 3NT bound to be bid e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Second segment is scheduled to start about now, so we are running 20-25 mins late|pg||
nt|shevek: still...|pg||
nt|shevek: doesn't look like a good one to me|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: time is running out for G-DKR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2 boards to go and then they have to score up|pg||
nt|patricck: I don't think there is any way back for PD now, even if they bid the grand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, still less than 50%..... but quite a bit better than 34% which is K@H and the 3-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: pass was also alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  pretty decent slam here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E will definitely bid once more|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: spade lead  might have a chance for defence|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: 20-25 minutes almost as being on time in India where time is not much of an issue|pg||
nt|kemperg: :))|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: How was the def at 3@S in the OR?. NS have 2.7@S on.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cicus: it may be a @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: well might be found|pg||
nt|ady: not a clear cut make|pg||
nt|cicus: @H lead requires less support from partner|pg||
nt|ady: still not a definate make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|cicus: he might as well lead his suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tell them that they are off two keycards for spades and that they should stop in 4, then give them 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead only thing that makes it difficult|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cicus: now Nanev already knows there are no 5-carders against him|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: This is excruciatingly slow|pg||
nt|patricck: 57 to recover now|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: even on this lead  might try spade finesse for 9th trick   still not home|pg||
nt|cicus: might duck @H10 first|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: @H ducks seems safe enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5IMP for NS?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has to park his fourth @d or ruff it - lot of work, actually|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|ady: well if defence wins heart   and cash clubs and play spade from south   then what?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|shevek: In bd 3, 4 & 5 Shrikant got 37 imps|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cicus: if I-VVU wins, who is going to be the 3rd pair?|pg||
nt|cicus: a valid point, David|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: how do you cash clubs? no it is safety again to raise with the A|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  and this plan promotes second trump trick for W|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|ady: sorry   since south has won heart needs spade now|pg||
nt|patricck: There are vacant spaces issues which complicate the maths, but I'll take a stab at 43%|pg||
pc|h3|nt|shevek: ok, patrick I go with that :)|pg||
nt|shevek: so much for our analysis|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|patricck: after finding that South has only 1 spade and 2 hearts it should be easy to guess to finesse the Q@D that way|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  and here defenders will get one more @d trick|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4IMP now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|patricck: South will be known to have 10 minor suit cards to North's 5 which essentially gives you 2 to 1 odds|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: another push|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|patricck: that makes against k@H signleton offside, but it wasn't the best percentage play|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|patricck: don't tell me declarer is talking himself into a losing line ??|pg||
pc|h4|nt|patricck: ah, finally|pg||
nt|shevek: ah well, they can afford it now|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|r_tibre: @C discards by N putting additional pressure on S?|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  or @h game for EW?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: 2NT IS PRECISELY?|pg||
nt|cicus: precision players often assign this type of hand to 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|cicus: strong 6-card suit, balanced maximum|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kaubash in the other room was 99% certain that he could beat 5@H because partner had shown diamonds, so he doubled and did indeed defeat it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzku: without 3 cards in spade |pg||
nt|ady: problem is if 3T the contract  may be wrong sided|pg||
nt|kemperg: E could have been much stronger|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now E can be reluctant to introduce his @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: will east compete as happened in the other room?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|cicus: some pair play that it evenpromises 3-card support as well|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and when in with @HA he underled diamonds to the king and got a spade ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Well thought out|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: obviously was an error by operator|pg||

mb|2S|nt|andyv:  5@h by W|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: perhaps East, knowing that hos side has 31 Imps to recover threw in an early psyche to make things happen?|pg||

pc|c5|nt|patricck: There are 6 possible losers, but declarer should be able to either ruff a club or pitch one on a dimaond|pg||

nt|patricck: I would have liked to see more pre-emption in @S by NS, but then maybe EW would have played in a minor as they should have done|pg||
nt|patricck: PD's best hope is that in the other room the EW pair reach 6@C which can be beaten with a @D ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: Choti is thinking hard|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Was a bitr quick. E needed to use K for 140 at trick one|pg||
