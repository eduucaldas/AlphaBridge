nt|sga1: Four session to go, only 8 imps difference, any thing possible.|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari should have exited with @ck on winning @SK in last deal, SS was one 1 down|pg||
nt|rv: all 3 teams in the trials are fairly evenly matched though Formidables have the best form in recent months, I anticipate semis and finals to be very close and go down to the wire|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables have been seeded to finals because they won 2 of the 3main qualifying events for the trials, both Summer and Winter Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: Texans won 3rd qualifying event National Masters with very different quorum of team, hence had to pay 5 lacks as direct entry to participate here|pg||
nt|rv: DSM qualified as runner-up of Summer Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: runner-up of Winter Nationals, Poddar Developers did not field team here because of some internal issues, very sad indeed|pg||
nt|rv: 5 lacks translates to 0.5 million rupees, about 10,000 USD:)|pg||
nt|rv: as per current exchange rate approx 11,000 USD|pg||
nt|rv: we have power failure at the venue, lost internet connectivity which means access to game and for Subhash Gupta to be ungagged|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables represented India the maximum times in last decade or so, they have won BFAME 4 times, reached QFs of Bermuda Bowl twice as well as R16 in Rosenblum during this period|pg||
nt|rv: apologies folks, waiting for power and connectivity to be back|pg||
nt|rv: I am not at the venue, doing commentary from home|pg||
nt|rv: P.Sridhar has won silver and bronze medal as part of Texan Aces in 2 successive European Open tournies, SS was part of team when they won bronze and Sumit was part of team when ...|pg||
nt|rv: they silver|pg||
nt|rv: pls stick around, let me call up folks at venue and check|pg||
nt|rv: power just back|pg||
nt|rv: we should be on in a couple of mins|pg||
nt|rv: they do have power back-up / generator at the venue, surprising it is taking awhile|pg||
nt|rv: according to BFI MPs, Pritish Kushari must be amongst the top 3 or 4 MPs holder in the country, he has earned most of the points as part of all-conquering Indian Railways team|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: for nearly a decade from mid-90s, Indian Railways used to have monopoly of all National team events|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|chilloncan: when you dont have spades, you have to get in early or they may make it too awkward for you to compete|pg||

mb|p|pc|dT|nt|sarkar_suk: nw trump shift shd be :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: tightly contested semi final so far and I am sure it is going that way till the end |pg||
nt|rv: I might have bid 2n or 3@h with Sridhar's hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sga1: But trump shift can only help if N switches to @d after winning @sK|pg||
nt|sga1: so that 2nd trump can also be removed.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rv: both 3n and 4@h have excellent play for N-S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chilloncan: S actually is not even minimum by Losing Trick Count standards, has playabiulity in at least 2 suits, only mild rebid problems, and can open the suit she wants led. all that adds ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rv: slightly aggressive action by Sundarrem, maybe he feels time has come for slog overs|pg||

nt|offthebend: to push the board -- other table has to beat 1NT by 1 trick which is quite possible as the cards were|pg||

nt|vugraphzvz: pl stand bye|pg||
nt|rv: deal where Kushari's misdefense against 2n will now be replayed?|pg||
nt|rv: that will mean 6 IMPs less for Texans and DSM still in lead?|pg||
nt|offthebend: I have just been informed that bd 71 has been cancelled but they will play one extra board |pg||
nt|rv: Pramod, can we adjust the scores here even if we can't watch action on replayed brd?|pg||
nt|rv: possibly deal 71 was foul board because of duplication related issues|pg||
nt|rv: this is not real bidding on this deal, Pramod is getting us back on track|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: sure i shall put the score manually after the board 71 is over|pg||
nt|offthebend: effectively the score stands at 104 -109 in favour of DSM as Mr.Sunit choksi has been fined 2 imps penalty for mobile ringing and bd 71 has to be replayed |pg||

mb|d|nt|offthebend: 3S here is puppet to 3NT to startwith |pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: when playing against opps who use support doubles, there is a reason to bid 2S on the E hand rather than 1S.  a support double typically can be used over 1S but not over 2S|pg||
nt|panja: as I suspected...|pg||
nt|subhranp: laltu thinking of 6?|pg||
nt|panja: this will come down to @D guess in the end|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: Guruji, PS-SS methods are all transfers including 3@s to @c, 4@c to @d etc|pg||

pc|s7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|rv: 4@c shows some @c fit possibly, 4@d/4@h cues, 4n is RKC in @Cs, 5@D is 0 or 3 keys|pg||

mb|1N|nt|chilloncan: looking at that W hand, it is not even automatic that 3S will make facing certain perfectly respectable 1S overcalls|pg||
nt|alamiro: Zona de grand slam para E-W|pg||
nt|panja: so..+450 instead of +500 because S took out 4@S dbl..and of course he did that because of the first 1@S dbl|pg||

nt|panja: now, after 1Nt...N will raise..|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rv: deal 71 might need to manually corrected|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: many pairs play two way weak 2s -- 2M is close to an opening bid, and 2D is a truly weak 2 in one majopr|pg||
nt|alamiro: Cuando se abre de preventiva los valores deberian estar concentrados en el palo de apertura, tiene algunos extras laterales|pg||
nt|alamiro: supongo que 3@s es buen palo y buena mano|pg||
nt|alamiro: Norte debe rematar 6nt para proteger su K@d|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for me S has a 1H opener, but even without the 2-tiered weak 2s, there is an ultraconservative school of weak 2s that the S hand fits perfectlt. Matt Granovetter for example uses ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this style, which derives from the dawn of weak 2s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this looks like Ogust|pg||

nt|panja: change it to @SA in N hand..and there would have been more trouble|pg||
nt|rodal f: But @D could been 3-3|pg||
nt|panja: difficult lead problem..I guess small @H best choice|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panja: and @H Q could get played here..|pg||
nt|panja: because S wants to tackle @D asap|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|alamiro: En mi opinion si voy abrir 1 mano de 11 ptos a nivel de 1, es porque tengo un 2do canto sin ninguna dificultad, en este caso Sur pudo abrir de 1@h y luego rematar 2@h y problema ...|pg||
nt|alamiro: resuelto, mano totalmente descrita!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chilloncan: very surprising for N to pass after a 3S reply to Ogust showing super maximum|pg||
nt|alamiro: Ahora pueden ganar 7 si encuentra la Q@C|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe N should have only invited once 2@h was doubled|pg||
nt|panja: W might shift..|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|offthebend: hard to say --- rather play in 6-1 than 4-3 fit with such hands |pg||

nt|panja: oh..I forgot N is the Declarer..|pg||
nt|panja: right..@H continuation is right...because @ST is seen in the dummy|pg||

nt|chilloncan: in general, the players here seem to be bidding as if the form of scoring were matchpoints or Point-a-Board (where the priority is going plus) rather than IMPs which reward games ...|pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|nt|suketbombi: yes offcolour ps and ss today|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: I am hearing news that DSM's penalty of 2 IMPs per session played by Bhabesh-Sumit waived for last 2 segments of semis and finals as well|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rv: net-net they were penalized 10 IMPs for 5 sessions played by pair on first 2 days|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: in my view, BFI has taken correct decision since penalty was too harsh|pg||
nt|suketbombi: i told you chote more they played they were entitiled for that discount:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rv: :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rv: incidentally penalty was imposed for 3 day late (Apr 18th instead of Apr 15th) submission of CC by Sumit-Bhabesh|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: pair doesn't play any HUM system or Brown sticker conventions, hence view was 2 IMPs penalty per session played by the pair till finals seems extremely harsh|pg||

nt|alamiro: 6@D para N-S?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if they lead a club you might as well play 7D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 5 or 7 hand|pg||
nt|rv: other table nearly completed, Sumit and Anil are very fast players|pg||
nt|subhranp: NS close to 3n here|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: last board of the day|pg||
nt|rodal f: An interesting one seen from the specs side. Defence and end|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|panja: I doubt this will end up in a game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: sorry I got the tables wrong, this table has finished earlier|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rv: Barbara is right|pg||
mb|d|nt|babs59: but RV, I said that privately :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: open room is playing slow bec of some lighting problems |pg||
nt|rv: thanks to my excellent commentators, Guruji Subhash Gupta and Barbara and insightful comments by all specs|pg||
nt|babs59: and this board doesn't look like Texans can recover IMPs|pg||
nt|subhranp: i guess 2c is other two suits|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|babs59: you'd better not play in the Open Room then Subhash :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: you've mis-seen a few bids tonight!|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: NS will do well to take out trumps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: excellent job done by Vugraph operator Pramod Samant and good organization by Pradeep and KSBA team and Kiruba and BFI team|pg||
nt|offthebend: I would have slept enough tonite to keep my eyes wide awake  :)|pg||
nt|panja: good lead|pg||
nt|subhranp: texans couldnt make 4h on B97 so lead has widened again|pg||
nt|panja: this could go two down now..as W will play @D to K first time..., likely|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: is this right?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sarkar_suk: last deal of this set :)|pg||

pc|d8|nt|rv: could be another swing for DSM here|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|babs59: and I just expected a flat board|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|chilloncan: this is one of these rare cases where N can use KC with a small doubleton -- S has shown  4342 shape and a c;ub stop, so she has to have the clubs controlled herself, either ace or ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: king|pg||
nt|panja: interesting..that seemed cold|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|alamiro: Que peculiar criterio al momento de abrir esta mano! en manos anteriores abrio de 2@h una mejor mano que esta!, ahora no paso y abrio de 1@D|pg||
nt|rv: momentum clearly with DSM now and they must be favorites to meet Formidables in finals|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|panja: even 93 for that matter|pg||
pc|hT|nt|babs59: the preemptive 3@C overcall with negative double endplayed North into 3NT at the other table|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chilloncan: yes, the evaluations do seem inconsistent. but this S hand is an opening bid because:|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|psyck: both Souths chose not to look for an 8 card @s fit with a balanced hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chilloncan: 1) the Losing Trick Count is about right     2) there is playability in 3 suits including both majors    3) there is no rebid problem     4) you get to openm a suit you want led|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rv: for all the neutrals, let us hope Texans mount a fightback in 7th segment|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: next segment at 10 AM tom morning, 5.30 AM London time|pg||
