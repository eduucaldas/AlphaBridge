nt|sga1: Four session to go, only 8 imps difference, any thing possible.|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari should have exited with @ck on winning @SK in last deal, SS was one 1 down|pg||
nt|rv: all 3 teams in the trials are fairly evenly matched though Formidables have the best form in recent months, I anticipate semis and finals to be very close and go down to the wire|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables have been seeded to finals because they won 2 of the 3main qualifying events for the trials, both Summer and Winter Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: Texans won 3rd qualifying event National Masters with very different quorum of team, hence had to pay 5 lacks as direct entry to participate here|pg||
nt|rv: DSM qualified as runner-up of Summer Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: runner-up of Winter Nationals, Poddar Developers did not field team here because of some internal issues, very sad indeed|pg||
nt|rv: 5 lacks translates to 0.5 million rupees, about 10,000 USD:)|pg||
nt|rv: as per current exchange rate approx 11,000 USD|pg||
nt|rv: we have power failure at the venue, lost internet connectivity which means access to game and for Subhash Gupta to be ungagged|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables represented India the maximum times in last decade or so, they have won BFAME 4 times, reached QFs of Bermuda Bowl twice as well as R16 in Rosenblum during this period|pg||
nt|rv: apologies folks, waiting for power and connectivity to be back|pg||
nt|rv: I am not at the venue, doing commentary from home|pg||
nt|rv: P.Sridhar has won silver and bronze medal as part of Texan Aces in 2 successive European Open tournies, SS was part of team when they won bronze and Sumit was part of team when ...|pg||
nt|rv: they silver|pg||
nt|rv: pls stick around, let me call up folks at venue and check|pg||
nt|rv: power just back|pg||
nt|rv: we should be on in a couple of mins|pg||
nt|rv: they do have power back-up / generator at the venue, surprising it is taking awhile|pg||
nt|rv: according to BFI MPs, Pritish Kushari must be amongst the top 3 or 4 MPs holder in the country, he has earned most of the points as part of all-conquering Indian Railways team|pg||
nt|panja: symmetric North hand in blacks....difficult for W to know the best shift unless E could guid|pg||
nt|panja: guide even|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rv: for nearly a decade from mid-90s, Indian Railways used to have monopoly of all National team events|pg||
nt|panja: light opening...|pg||
mb|d|nt|sarkar_suk: neck to neck fight nice to watch sudhir :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|chilloncan: S should open with that hand|pg||
nt|sga1: How many would open 3@d with that hand vul, literally 9 loser hand. I would not.|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes :)|pg||
nt|rv: great, we are back on and hi again to Subhash Gupta|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|subhranp: 3nt easier here than 4h|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chilloncan: when you dont have spades, you have to get in early or they may make it too awkward for you to compete|pg||
nt|sga1: Doesn't fall into any rule 2-3-4 or not even for aggressive players with 2-3-4-5 rule.|pg||
nt|offthebend: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: Excelente Resultado para N-S en la otra sala|pg||
nt|panja: true...with extra strength...and near balanced hands..it is always worthwhile exploring 3N in preference to 4 of a Major|pg||
nt|panja: here though, with all the Aces, North is likely to prefer a @S game|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sarkar_suk: thats a good lead for declarer :)|pg||
nt|sga1: 4 quick tricks for defense.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sarkar_suk: nw trump shift shd be :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: tightly contested semi final so far and I am sure it is going that way till the end |pg||
nt|rv: I might have bid 2n or 3@h with Sridhar's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: But trump shift can only help if N switches to @d after winning @sK|pg||
nt|sga1: so that 2nd trump can also be removed.|pg||
nt|panja: there was that other issue....did S show 5@S with this bidding? his next bid gives us the answer...NO|pg||
nt|panja: so 4@S, it will be...or will it go further?|pg||
nt|subhranp: could go higher|pg||
nt|panja: BTW Subhran, what is 2@D for you?|pg||
nt|panja: 12+?|pg||
mb|5N|nt|subhranp: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: both 3n and 4@h have excellent play for N-S|pg||
nt|panja: I was wondering whey Keyzad bid 2@D rather than 2@S|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S would have shown 9-10 or so....|pg||
mb|6S|nt|chilloncan: S actually is not even minimum by Losing Trick Count standards, has playabiulity in at least 2 suits, only mild rebid problems, and can open the suit she wants led. all that adds ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: up to a clear opening bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: if he guesses everything right, this could make|pg||
nt|panja: but that is rather unlikely|pg||
nt|panja: on the @CK lead...with correct @S view..there is a red suit squeeze on West|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes right panja..|pg||
nt|subhranp: one can trust keyzad to find those lines|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panja: Williaim Watson suggests that is the only option.....@CKQ must be in, W must hold 5 @D 4!M..so East must hold 4 Spades to make!|pg||
nt|panja: 5@H4@H, that is|pg||
nt|panja: Keyzad could conjure all that up..he is quite capable of thinking of a way to make this|pg||
nt|panja: and E's first @D will tell him W holds 5@D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sga1: now -2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|rv: Sundarram is possibly abs minimum for his double and 2@h especially with modern style of O/Cs till 17/18 hcp|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sarkar_suk: thats not good line i think sudhir :)|pg||

nt|subhranp: well..i wouldnt bet against a DSM vs Form final now|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sga1: it could be 2@h/3@H depending on whether NS would compete to 3@C or not.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sga1: 2NT here was natural, opening hand.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sga1: not Jacoby which many prefer.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rv: Jacoby responses have been tailored a lot by different partnerships, traditionally 3 level bids show stiff and 4 level second 5 card suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzvz: sure i shall put the score manually after the board 71 is over|pg||
nt|offthebend: effectively the score stands at 104 -109 in favour of DSM as Mr.Sunit choksi has been fined 2 imps penalty for mobile ringing and bd 71 has to be replayed |pg||

mb|p|nt|chilloncan: many pairs play two way weak 2s -- 2M is close to an opening bid, and 2D is a truly weak 2 in one majopr|pg||
nt|alamiro: Cuando se abre de preventiva los valores deberian estar concentrados en el palo de apertura, tiene algunos extras laterales|pg||
nt|alamiro: supongo que 3@s es buen palo y buena mano|pg||
nt|alamiro: Norte debe rematar 6nt para proteger su K@d|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for me S has a 1H opener, but even without the 2-tiered weak 2s, there is an ultraconservative school of weak 2s that the S hand fits perfectlt. Matt Granovetter for example uses ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this style, which derives from the dawn of weak 2s|pg||

nt|subhranp: this would be interesting|pg||
pc|s6|nt|panja: and @H Q could get played here..|pg||
nt|panja: because S wants to tackle @D asap|pg||
pc|s2|nt|alamiro: En mi opinion si voy abrir 1 mano de 11 ptos a nivel de 1, es porque tengo un 2do canto sin ninguna dificultad, en este caso Sur pudo abrir de 1@h y luego rematar 2@h y problema ...|pg||

nt|alamiro: 6@D para N-S?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if they lead a club you might as well play 7D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 5 or 7 hand|pg||
nt|rv: other table nearly completed, Sumit and Anil are very fast players|pg||
nt|subhranp: NS close to 3n here|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: last board of the day|pg||
nt|rodal f: An interesting one seen from the specs side. Defence and end|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: I doubt this will end up in a game|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rv: sorry I got the tables wrong, this table has finished earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Barbara is right|pg||
mb|4H|nt|babs59: but RV, I said that privately :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: open room is playing slow bec of some lighting problems |pg||
nt|rv: thanks to my excellent commentators, Guruji Subhash Gupta and Barbara and insightful comments by all specs|pg||
nt|babs59: and this board doesn't look like Texans can recover IMPs|pg||
nt|subhranp: i guess 2c is other two suits|pg||
nt|subhranp: last board of SF coming up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: you'd better not play in the Open Room then Subhash :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: you've mis-seen a few bids tonight!|pg||
nt|subhranp: well played DSM|pg||
nt|subhranp: finals starting tomorrow at 9:30 AM IST|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: NS will do well to take out trumps|pg||
nt|subhranp: one spade can be ruffed in dummy and should make|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rv: excellent job done by Vugraph operator Pramod Samant and good organization by Pradeep and KSBA team and Kiruba and BFI team|pg||
nt|offthebend: I would have slept enough tonite to keep my eyes wide awake  :)|pg||
nt|panja: good lead|pg||
nt|subhranp: texans couldnt make 4h on B97 so lead has widened again|pg||
nt|panja: this could go two down now..as W will play @D to K first time..., likely|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: is this right?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: last deal of this set :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|rv: could be another swing for DSM here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|subhranp: Formidables directly seeded to Finals|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|babs59: and I just expected a flat board|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this is one of these rare cases where N can use KC with a small doubleton -- S has shown  4342 shape and a c;ub stop, so she has to have the clubs controlled herself, either ace or ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: king|pg||
nt|panja: interesting..that seemed cold|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cJ|nt|alamiro: Que peculiar criterio al momento de abrir esta mano! en manos anteriores abrio de 2@h una mejor mano que esta!, ahora no paso y abrio de 1@D|pg||
nt|rv: momentum clearly with DSM now and they must be favorites to meet Formidables in finals|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: even 93 for that matter|pg||
pc|hK|nt|babs59: the preemptive 3@C overcall with negative double endplayed North into 3NT at the other table|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chilloncan: yes, the evaluations do seem inconsistent. but this S hand is an opening bid because:|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|mc|10|nt|psyck: both Souths chose not to look for an 8 card @s fit with a balanced hand|pg||
