nt|Walddk2: Our first 1NT opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: yes Liz|pg||
mb|1N!|an|12-14|nt|athene: 1nt from east and now south has a "double or show the hearts?" decision|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|athene: 2@D multi-landy i assume, showing one major|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: N-S European Senior champions from Belgium last summer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: representing Poland|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: nunes doesn't look for 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: and give NS time to sort out what is going on|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not with a perfume shape|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Practical shot from Nunes - 3NT also makes, but both contracts need some finessing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4711  Eau de Cologne|pg||
nt|athene: i thought 7411 was called the "swan"|pg||
nt|athene: because josephine culbertson thought it looked like a swam|pg||
nt|athene: swan|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly she had been in the bar for several hours when she came out with that one|pg||
nt|athene: nasty decision for north|pg||
nt|athene: usually you don't bid 5 over 5, but he has zero tricks and a known fit for his partner, so...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He can lose 550 or 500, I think|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: looks like a possible misunderstanding in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo made an intermediate jump overcall and west transferred to diamonds then bid 4@C|pg||
nt|athene: surely intending it as forcing?|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo one of the few players still to favour intermediate jump overcalls|pg||
nt|athene: hi |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks as though East forgot the transfer - makes us all feel better|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know that he forgot - his partner showed diamonds and clubs and he expressed a preference by passing|pg||
nt|athene: but i bet west thought he had forced to game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is often game-forcing|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: Looks like a no cost 4@D just in case|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are in 800 territory|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: passing 4@C looked a bit dodgy to me|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not a big fan of saves at love all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And he will pay the price|pg||
nt|athene: well i don't think north was exactly a fan of the whole business|pg||
nt|kit: South wasn't exactly thinking save when he doubled|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This was not a voluntary save - North really though his hand was worth about -2 tricks in defence|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: north's dilemma reminds me of a humorous anecdote from cambridge - one player in the 1980s was renowned for making light penalty doubles|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: and his partner once was discussing the boards after an evening's duplicate|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: and they said ok what did you do on board 1|pg||
nt|athene: and he said i did well i opened 4@S and only went for 500|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|d4|nt|athene: "what's so good about that?" they asked|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: because on board 1 it is love all|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|kit: Unfortunate choice -- he could have gotten out for down 3 by playing clubs from dummy, but he chose reasonably to play for ace of clubs onside|pg||
nt|athene: "opps were cold for 590" he said|pg||
pc|c6|mc|7|pg||

nt|jcomyn: what a horrible bunch of misfits - not us - the hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be us also LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if all stay low |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would open N hand  |pg||

nt|Walddk4: Commentators Bob, Bill and Andy|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Good evening |pg||
nt|psyck: we have the 2nd & 3rd place teams here: http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 5@d on EW|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kiwibridge: I enjoyed watching Braithwaite & Richman|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Precision a la Angelini|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45: N/S can make a very lucky 3 NT here, but hardly bid it|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S or 5@D |pg||
mb|2H|nt|woozle: 4H is fair (but down)...vulnerable I'd definitely want to be there|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: can NS really make 3nt? how do they get to dummy to finesse diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT would be my (bad resulting) bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is -1, but I think they will take a sacrifie - which will make|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen might very reasonably drive to game here, particularly considering the hands that this pair haven't overcalled|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now what?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be played doubled? |pg||
nt|psyck: 1N=@c or puppet to @c i guess|pg||
nt|athene: maybe in spades, given time :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: @S Jack is the entry|pg||
nt|hawe45: - but I said: VERY lucky|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt might be some either/or bid - those are sort of the norm after strong club|pg||
nt|athene: so clubs or something else, maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning all|pg||
nt|bobholl: typical screen wait :)|pg||
nt|psyck: @d's put to sleep|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: strong enough for one try ?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jcomyn: source of tricks very scarc e here|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 @D should end the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, could be a suction variant with @c or red suits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and getting scarcer|pg||
nt|sybarra: was typing,  "not sure this is success either"|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 @D is jumping into fire |pg||
nt|sybarra: (out of frying pan)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: best to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ not an entry for trump finesse playing in diamonds :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  may not have to try anymore|pg||
nt|bobholl: double all pass :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Will be defeated - with the @S-ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45: - not any longer|pg||
nt|athene: now he can just play ace and a diamond, lose @SAK, @DK, @CA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: and its "good luck pard" with a smile |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like 1 down with 5@d cold!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Henry!|pg||
nt|henryb:  I wonder why West did not raise diamonds|pg||
pc|dA|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4S bid is very loose, and possibly down more than one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: rescue|pg||
nt|woozle: Likely phantom|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: only way the contract might go down is spade shift and then try to ruff a club|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: right John!  this can not be worse  (only 50's) |pg||
nt|psyck: S will have to provide an entry to dec hand for @c fin|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: then @DK overruff, @S ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: Sometimes I think dbl is used very bad instead of supporting|pg||
pc|c5|nt|woozle: diamond, diamond ruff, club, diamond ruff, club or heart to come (if the defense don't cash the HA the heart runs away...if they do, two clubs run away)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s very limited in range...3-7 hcp which may be reason for lack of try by S...W's balance will not meet with teammate approval|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: playing 4@C no risk on card play playing for 10 tricks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: S can not find his parner entry for a ruff but might try it |pg||
mc|11|nt|jameslee 2: claim  for 10 not 11 should be |pg||
pg||
qx|o2|st||md|4SAT75HAKQ2DAK4C65,SQJ643H65DQTCKQ92,S9HT9873D986CJT73,SK82HJ4DJ7532CA84|sv|n|nt|Vugraphzcp: polish dispute...|pg||
nt|athene: interesting choice of super-accept from garozzo in the other room, "wrongsiding" hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an|12-14 bal, 15+ with clubs or any 18+|nt|athene: but maybe he does it deliberately, knowing he does not have any positional cards|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Polish Club, 12-14 balanced, 15+ with clubs or any 18+|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: he wants the lead to run up to his partner's stray honours|pg||
nt|athene: north in the other room must be a good declarer if garozzo deliberately chooses to be dummy :)|pg||
nt|kit: may be difficult to get to 4@H now|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, not quite the standard Polish Club|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Yes, double shows 18+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 2NT is Lebensohl, bad cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Will South respect this and bid 3@C?|pg||
nt|athene: well, his hands are getting better|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or perhaps 2 places to play?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kit: East's double solved that problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nice surprise for Kowalski|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He was convinced partner had clubs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: south would have respected the 2nt bid i think - assuming X was 18+ he does not have that many extras does he|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT is not passable|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, the double of 2@S works fine when partner has hearts, and really did have to be made.  But it could have turned out badly.|pg||
nt|athene: so he would just have bid 3@C|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But when partner shows 5 hearts.... things are looking up|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|h3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H is cold when hearts are 2-2 -- 7 trumps, 2 diamonds, 1 spade.  But declarer doesn't know hearts are 2-2|pg||
nt|athene: a spec asks whether EW might consider sacrificing in 4@S - i don't they are nearly sure enough that 4@H is making to consider a sacrifice|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|h8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: that's sort of the first requirement :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|d9|nt|kit: His plan is to discard diamond, then ruff diamond|pg||
nt|kit: This way he gets 3 ruffs in hand, 4 trumps in dummy to get his 7 trump tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: east thinking about pitching a club to try to get a trump promotion?|pg||
nt|kit: Of course this approach could have turned out badly if West had jack of hearts, with diamonds 5-2|pg||
nt|kit: I think the plan was right, but not the execution -- should not have cashed AK of diamonds -- could then play 2nd trump first|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
mc|10|nt|kit: admittedly it is complicated|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SAT75HAKQ2DAK4C65,SQJ643H65DQTCKQ92,S9HT9873D986CJT73,SK82HJ4DJ7532CA84|sv|n|nt|kiwibridge: in the context of the match a huge plus|pg||
nt|woozle: On a good, day, 4H NS might make ten tricks. This is not a good day.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec points out that East's low @d was spot on|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: first board and last board are the killers for keeping concentration|pg||
nt|athene: the ones in between, they are hard too|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  -800 usually not what you expect when opps are not in game|pg||
nt|athene: i think that possibly east should bid 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: the point being it's very likely his partner might balance disastrously|pg||
nt|athene: east is a passed hand - how bad can 3@C be?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is just with benefit of hindsight|pg||
nt|andyv:  but in imps, is there a reason for W to balance?|pg||
nt|andyv:  poor quality suit, and, except for 6th @h, the hand is balanced|pg||
nt|athene: well the hand does go to prove one point which is that just because opps have stopped low, doesn't mean it's safe to come in|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, the severity was pretty extreme|pg||
nt|psyck: unlikely S would try pd entry with all hcp marked though|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: fantoni nunes defended better as usual in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so -2!|pg||
nt|athene: but still should have been a much bigger swing|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D was cold|pg||
nt|athene: it's almost always safer to act aggressively earlier rather than pass and back in|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a rather easy 4@h on EW|pg||
nt|henryb:  good thing E-W missing 2 aces. otherwise W might drive to a no-play slam|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: dealer having fun today?|pg||
nt|athene: at the point he won the second club|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 NT better be played by East - only @D-lead brings trouble|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 1 @S denies 4 sp |pg||
nt|athene: but that was a particularly tough one |pg||
nt|psyck: no problems in 4@h with trump breaking if they can get there|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi Kristina have we got our vugrapher around to ask for any doubts?|pg||
nt|psyck: I don't know, we can try :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi all.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi Jeff|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Jeff|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi again Krishna:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a good 4@H contract |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@C is natural (ish) and 14+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: West not worth 2 bids|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so 1NT shows 4 s then?|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me look for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: hitting the deck again? |pg||
nt|athene: 2@S just a natural game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: he knows E opened 1 @C a "good hand" |pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead and heart back, ducked|pg||
nt|athene: if NS find that you call the director|pg||
nt|hawe45: and the police|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@D control & slam prop that N will decline |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H end |pg||
nt|fann4: Not good to have North playing it.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10 tricks could be claim soon after 2 round @H |pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: I'm told 3@c was transfer last deal, that makes sense|pg||
nt|psyck: Common to play transfers after intervention|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H = 2/2 help to make contract easy |pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: they play transfer responses so 1@S response would be limited with no major|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt stronger than 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|athene: basically if anyone has not seen NS before, they play an unusual system|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a fast claim I hope|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ianmcc: the vul got him|pg||
nt|athene: fairly strong, forcing 1 level bids|pg||
nt|athene: 14+ or thereabouts|pg||
nt|athene: weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: 2-level bids are 10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that @d suit is never mentioned.|pg||
nt|athene: so after the 1-level openers, responder can force to game on ten counts|pg||
nt|athene: and they can set up a game force quickly and often|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessed east would lead red but this is better|pg||
nt|athene: normally you would prefer to have the lead running up to a strong notrump rather than through it|pg||
nt|athene: but here the red tenaces are protected at least|pg||
nt|bobholl: will be so !|pg||
nt|henryb:  At my local club :) there would be two pairs in 5@h and at least one in a partial|pg||
nt|henryb:  also, probably, one in 3N|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades might have been @D,  I am still chedking |pg||
pc|s5|nt|woozle: I'm all for supporting with support, but West's 4D looks excessive with the secondary misfit|pg||
nt|athene: worth pointing out that if north at any points found the @H7 lead(and south had not led the suit) and declarer plays the king, south has to duck|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see 52 cards the 8 is so obvious :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|nt|athene: very common to duck the first round if you have AJx(xx) over KQx|pg||
nt|athene: keep communications open|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this could make to min the loss|pg||
nt|hawe45: 9 tricks without the @S-guess|pg||
nt|athene: you wait for partner to get in again and everything is happy|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hawe45: South thinking - telling: I do NOT have the @D Ace...|pg||
nt|athene: what is south thinking about? his partner can't have @HQ left can he?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: right|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|h8|nt|sybarra: lot to do  but looks doable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good word that - brave bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: grand is there,  (per many specs)  but not sure I want to be there |pg||
nt|jcomyn: me nayther|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this could take a while|pg||
nt|psyck: may fin @s into safe hand & be forced to set up @d later|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: 6 @d 4 @c 2 @s 1 @h|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: now we get the costly lead a couple of tricks earlier :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Could still be endplayed with a spade after the diamnd break comes to light|pg||
nt|kit: Very friendly lead -- might not have made without this|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: After club to ace, diamond ruff, club, could declarer survive?|pg||
nt|athene: well he can then pick up the trumps|pg||
nt|athene: lead to the queen dropping the jack|pg||
nt|kit: right -- he will have diamond entry to dummy after 1 round of trumps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And exit in spades - a bit sweaty :)|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond ruff does not hurt declarer because it just uses the defence's natural trump trick on a losing diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcp: Kowalski is checking the CC of EW for the leads|pg||
nt|athene: that is often the way - one ruff is either costing the defence a trump trick or a trick in the suit itself|pg||
nt|kit: so best defense then is club and a club I guess|pg||
nt|athene: it's the second ruff that is costly|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: West began the best in the other room|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: club to ace and club|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: then he should win the trump finesse with the jack and just exit a trump|pg||

nt|hawe45: No comments|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @H 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@h NO PROBLEM THANKS TO @d t |pg||
nt|psyck: W's sequence on deal 1 was likely game forcing, E may have forgotten|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: missing DK will hardly bid 7|pg||
nt|hawe45: With N/S bidding the 3 other suits, West will find the @C-lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: their "strong" weak twos often score well (especially against the dutch:)) |pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 1, in OR, 4@h was played by N|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so this north hand is a game force for Fantoni i am sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on NS?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psyck: 1@s followed by 3@h would be normal by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: This time EW might reasonably attempt 5D|pg||
nt|athene: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: north is intending to just show a heart raise so not bothering with the spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 1nt on N even if only 14|pg||
nt|bobholl: won't bid it if he doesn't guess to bid 1 nt now (too ligth imo)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen's 2D overcall a little ugly with only a five card suit, but the excellent hand and unsuitability of every other call justify it|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie, unfortunately, doesn't know what a vul v not 2-level overcall looks like|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd sooner bid 5D than pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Povl Sommer|pg||
nt|jcomyn: does s hand not qualify for 1c|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: hmmm, 2@c playing a strong @c system...|pg||
nt|athene: usually you do that with a game force which i don't think north really has|pg||
nt|henryb:  not so easy to reach unless N overcalls a weak 1NT |pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: hi Povl,  welcome |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: too early in the day to try swingy bids|pg||
nt|hawe45: Depuis 40 ans...|pg||
nt|hawe45: Sorry, privat|pg||
nt|bobholl: some kind of truscott i guess|pg||
nt|henryb:  Especially if E elects to respond|pg||
nt|henryb:  which I would|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: stayman & a 4@H shoot |pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..4@D now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H both majors nice convention but now ?! :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: a bold X pls don't convert|pg||
nt|sybarra: N will make a slam try with 4 @d |pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: 4 @S |pg||
nt|sommer: ..and they should be there|pg||
nt|athene: so, a spade lead and a club loser goes away|pg||
nt|hawe45: 2 @S for the lead???|pg||
pc|cA|nt|woozle: Buchen steps out a little with a reopening double, diagnosing the short hearts opposite. Christie still thinks that he has a balanced yarborough and just returns to diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: N was too strong for his action after all :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: This cuts communication a little|pg||
nt|athene: ok now declarer can't get to dummy for a pitch on the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: sensible lead|pg||
nt|athene: lead the singleton with a weak hand|pg||
nt|psyck: @h will be entry later|pg||
nt|hawe45: Listen folks - does 2 @S mean: Lead what you like?|pg||
nt|athene: Garozzo said "if you don't lead your singleton, pd shld assume u don't have one"|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 aces away and claim |pg||
nt|henryb:  they might beat this enough to compensate for the game!|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S.. now|pg||
nt|sybarra: up the line cues I guess |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: danger hand with @D 5/0 Q@S off side & a @H looser |pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|athene: that doesn't quite mean "always lead your singleton" as people sometimes say|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: but it is fairly close :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Still 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|bobholl: wasn't it the Q he led ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  so what?|pg||
nt|bobholl: otherwise i didn't understand the duck :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D set as trump |pg||
nt|jcomyn: that dk still missing though|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are off to the races |pg||
pc|s7|nt|woozle: EW will win seven imps, but a completely worthwhile vulnerable game has gone begging|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sommer: nice and easy, wd|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|hawe45: Now 11½|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe he took the pitch earlier|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hawe45: Even if East ducks the first @H, still 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|athene: east covers in case his pd has @H109x or something|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still a plus with Klinger stealing 3@H|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and as WE see, it makes 13 tricks fast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this WONT take long|pg||
nt|athene: always hard to duck with a doubleton honour|pg||
nt|hawe45: Hmm...!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: nunes fantoni didn't take their tricks against 4@H either|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: ok, 8 will be entry now :)|pg||
nt|athene: @D8 nice entry|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK - that´s better|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|woozle: I shouldn't be so harsh - Christie couldn't have known that he had four trumps, a king and a key singleton|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no entry in dummy for the 2 finnesse |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|kiwibridge: that is being harsh|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is NS play 2@C as natural or a 3-card limit raise |pg||
nt|athene: quite common idea so you can stop at the 2-level when partner has a really bad hand|pg||
nt|psyck: that would be a likely explanation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c to shorten dummys trumph|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c5|pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: another @c|pg||

nt|kit: Seems like 5@D in other room should make with diamond hook on|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that hand must be worth a 12 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes could have upgraded to 1NT but decided against|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess, vulnerable, he doesn't want to push it|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: but declarer thought that West had to have king of diamonds for opening bid, so played to drop it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not unreasonable|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: I think unreasonable -- would having stiff king vs. stiff small really have affected opening bid decision?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: A10xx  AQxx  K  xxxx|pg||
nt|athene: it's worth noting how west doesn't lead a heart - not prepared to give up a trick to declarer's likely king just to set up a 4-card suit|pg||
nt|kit: That's assuming no Jack of hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He would not open that hand with a stiff x|pg||
nt|athene: setting up a 5-card suit and a 4-card suit against 3nt are two very different things|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|athene: a 4-card suit isn't beating 3nt on its own|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Must be nice to trust partner to make the right shift if he gets in|pg||

qx|c4|st||md|2SKQJ94HK4DA96CA74,SAT62HAQJTD82CT92,S75H3DQJT743CKQJ8,S83H987652DK5C653|sv|b|nt|woozle: With the pressure off, Buchen guesses the trumps...perhaps the 3H bid implies some shape|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another one where we can't see what happened in the CR|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this 4@s could make needs W to break @d?|pg||
nt|woozle: EW can put on some pressure by bidding to 5C here, which needs hearts led at trick one or two to beat it|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S, meanwhile, appears to need a diamond shift to beat it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nor should this|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is a good sac against 4@H here|pg||
nt|hawe45: Only game here is 3 @D doubled|pg||
nt|athene: nunes obviously did not think his hand quite good enough for a 2@D opener|pg||
nt|athene: (10-13, unbalanced, 5+@D)|pg||
nt|athene: they tend to be ultra disciplined with those|pg||
nt|athene: so it has to be a ridiculously good 9|pg||
nt|psyck: not with all values outside i guess|pg||
nt|athene: a 9 that is basically a 12 :)|pg||
nt|psyck: we will have to wait a little longer for the imps to flow|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so as well as 3nt|pg||
nt|psyck: the least you would expect from this legend :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 84 year old think|pg||
nt|psyck: the @s return probably tipped him off to play that way|pg||
nt|psyck: 83|pg||
mb|1C|nt|woozle: With +600/620 or -100 as the options, I'd much rather be playing than defending|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice to be spectating this one|pg||
nt|woozle: Sorry, not so sure that the diamond shift is necessary to beat 4S - discard is in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but endplay?|pg||
nt|sommer: this?..this may be a swing|pg||
nt|sommer: ..if N dares to bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 18-19 i take it|pg||
nt|sybarra: X will now = @D I suspect |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: :) ty not far |pg||
nt|psyck: 84 later this year i think|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|woozle: but if the defense never break diamonds, a one-suit squeeze on east will work|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D interesting - sometimes you have to open 1@D with various "loose" hands in a strong club system|pg||
nt|athene: but usually with 6 clubs you can open 2@C!|pg||
nt|athene: maybe their 2@C opener denies a 4 card major|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sommer: 2@S may be 2 controls|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt think sacrifice now|pg||
nt|sommer: nope..very passive by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i really must hunt out a CC for NS :) then i could actually stop just guessing haha|pg||
nt|psyck: Papi has been practicing with N quite a bit on BBO recently, you can catch him with the id sillafu here often|pg||
nt|fann4: Clearly 1@S would not have been forcing by S here.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not bad hands for a start for Benito 16/18/17/19 in 4 hands :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: Bridggida, the goddess of Bridge, clearly favors him :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Usually, in a strong @c system, it is the long relays we cannot make sense of, here even their natual bids are unnatural :(|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D is always a bit of an amorphous blob in 5-card major strong 1@C systems|pg||
nt|athene: just not usually this sort of blob :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't know their system (yet) but looks like strong club with conventional answers |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sommer: got a chance there too, to X|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|woozle: Perhaps not. My imagination is getting ahead of me. East will be endplayed if he comes down to KJT of diamonds, but if he keeps the 6 and ditches a minor honour then West's diamond ...|pg||
nt|woozle: pips will save him|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i dont like this style of bidding with this kind of shape|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D making N 3Nt only by S|pg||
nt|fann4: maybe heading to 3N by S, if N bids 3@H now.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|psyck: we can just ignore the 1st round of bids & it looks fine though...|pg||
nt|hawe45: With an easy @H-guess, East can make 4 @D - if N/S do not find the @H-ruff|pg||
nt|athene: i assumed it was just 1@C natural, 1@H transfer, 1nt natural, new minor forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is tak 'em or dont get 'em |pg||
nt|athene: not trivial perhaps to bid 3@D with east |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT much better than 4@S @C lead and swiftly 1 down |pg||
nt|fann4: Down a lot if the @DK offside - 5@D much better|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sybarra: only in nt |pg||
nt|sommer: sry..I'm told, E showed 5c@H|pg||
nt|athene: might feel he is just hanging partner for a good balancing action|pg||
nt|psyck: E was afraid of crucifying pd for balancing|pg||
nt|athene: also he might just assume that north has implied some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: since usually you will do if you open 1@D and rebid clubs, even if you might have longer clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: I also have to sleep some time, this contract is a 2-minut-one...!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://bridgetopics.com/news/2011/apr/fantunes-and-garozzo-play-angelini-salsomaggiore is about this match|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d looks like xfer to @hs, otherwise 3N doesn't make sense with E hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i'm told that 1@D generally promises a 4-card major in the NS methods, so 2@C showed 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i was wondering why he ignored the spades, but if he has implied them, that is ok :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems they are heding to a good 5@D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sommer: ..the 3@C did|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H lead expected |pg||
pc|hK|nt|woozle: It would all work if the D8 was in North|pg||
nt|sommer: 2@S was "wheater/or"..and then 3@C showed 5c @H|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: this double specifically denies a major, does it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, and is positive|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: so East can just bid 2NT now?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But 1@H has no cost as it's forcing|pg||
nt|athene: no double of 2@D from north - but south will surely go for the diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: not much else to do|pg||
nt|athene: poor Romanski|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: he had a 1 the first two boards and it has got worse|pg||

nt|sommer: EW missed even 6@D at the other table in b 3|pg||
nt|fann4: Certainly a big swing possibility. West may not open in the other room or declarer may still take the @D finesse.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sommer: 2..sry|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H or 3@S the limit but ???|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|psyck: x wide ranging opp a nebulous opening|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the double of 1@D just says "i am doubling whatever minor he has for takeout " :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will they miss @H now ?|pg||
nt|athene: many people bid 1@S with that west sort of hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@s from S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: these nebulous minor openers cause a whole lot of interesting problems for both sides|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: you see it a lot more with short 1@C openers|pg||
nt|hawe45: In fact, best game is 3 NT - with @S 5-1, 4 @H might be a looser|pg||
nt|athene: but they they are stuck when the bidding comes back to them in 4@H or something|pg||
nt|athene: they have to bid 5@C and now partner can't go back to 4@S if he wants to|pg||
nt|athene: much more descriptive to bid clubs first then spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @C lead 4@S migth make|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes match can get closer |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: could be lively auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: and some were worried about missing 7,  John and I were both chickens  and happy to be in 6 |pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: right pair of chickens we are shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: that ok |pg||
nt|bobholl: now N has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that nunes splinters for hearts with no more than a minimum opener (in their style)|pg||
nt|athene: the italians generally lay great stress on showing the shape in competition like this |pg||
nt|bobholl: will bid 5@D now i guess|pg||
nt|athene: two small in clubs looks very bad from north's point of view - but not if you know partner has a singleton :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but may be not strong enough sure :)|pg||
nt|athene: will west lightner double hearts?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would force NS to find the better spot in @hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: over 900 watching this match now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 8 to go after this one|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: at the end of the last hand Buchen just showed his kj10x @d to Smolanko, and they both agreed 1 off|pg||
nt|hawe45: I think is says "nolo comprendo" - or so - in Italian. What could 3 @C mean???|pg||
nt|athene: @C2 lead now maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nunes should convert this|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry|pg||
nt|bobholl: has to underlead in @C to deafeat 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4H almost looks like an underbid, but if you're going to stop low, that North hand won't disappoint|pg||
nt|sybarra: wtih no apologies to mates :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: not any more|pg||
nt|fann4: 1NT probably 18-20|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sommer: no chance|pg||
nt|psyck: can set up an extra @s trick as cards are to get home|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: J@D lead or 10@D with agreement |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|athene: not much point west underleading since he is on lead against diamonds not hearts :)|pg||
nt|athene: east might deduce the diamond void from the auction|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|psyck: i donno what 4@c is either|pg||
nt|athene: but a diamond lead could be wrong in many ways - if partner doesn't ruff you just gave a vital tempo away|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 5@H is made|pg||
nt|andyv:  he'll deduce it now but it's too late|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but no entry in parner to make damagge |pg||
nt|psyck: actully not, cannot afford it now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psyck: but can endplay S |pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|andyv:  you are right...no reason not to try|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: of course, "Normally", you only lightner double at the slam level|pg||
nt|bobholl: not the ace :)|pg||
nt|athene: but there are other times when perhaps it might apply|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that it does interfere with when you just want to double for penalty because opps are saccing|pg||
nt|andyv:  in imps, I think E had enough to go on to try a @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: so you can only really use it when you are known from the previous auction not to be strong enough to need to double just to protect your equity on the deal|pg||
nt|andyv:  and question for W was whether to bid on, to dbl for lead direction, or to pass....this time pass looks costly|pg||

nt|athene: 4@H "game"|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7@D or 7@H even|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|woozle: Someone asked about a low spade instead of the queen. That's complex, and I think that Smolanko would have had to find the weird play of the jack from dummy to make|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: NO|pg||
nt|athene: so east bid 1nt over a strong club with clubs, now 1@H with spades|pg||
nt|hawe45: I´am proud of the fact, that I do´nt understand one single of these bids|pg||
nt|athene: so it looks like some sort of suction|pg||
nt|athene: probably showing the next suit up or some other 2 suiter|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe just simple transfers but that is a little passé surely|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo east in 4@S here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but if they are too sophisticated they'l discover missing @D Q|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: @D finessed in board 4 hedding to a confortable 630 swing |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: having an actual anchor suit! that's bordering on natural bidding|pg||
nt|hawe45: Can one open 4th in hand - and let the opponents play - undoubled|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi peter|pg||
nt|fann4: the dbl presumably showed @H, and 2@H showed 4 card support.|pg||

nt|psyck: there is a defense to strong @c called DONTTON where 1 level bids are transfers showing length or shortness in the next suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: claim :(|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: easy grand - more interestig to bid without @cA |pg||

nt|psyck: and Pass lead directional in Pointed suits, & Double lead directional in Rounded suits :)|pg||
nt|psyck: So far we have been able to follow NS bidding anyway, usually they are more esoteric :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H 3/2 no problem in 4@H = or Q@C placed for +1|pg||
pc|d5|nt|woozle: The defense here seem to have taken to heart Zia's tip "always play the nine"|pg||
nt|athene: you can't really hope to make use of the diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: all the grandmothers in the audience are shaking their heads|pg||

pc|s5|nt|athene: basically there is a big practical advantage in complicated artificial schemes of interference|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @S & J@C |pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: but in practice it just gives them more room to mess up|pg||

nt|fann4: On bd 5 EW also in 3N in the OR.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: now ruff the @H8 and west must overruff with a trump trick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kiwibridge: slipped it thru|pg||
nt|athene: if you double a transfer is that showing the suit bid, or takeout of the suit shown, or what?|pg||
nt|athene: or penalty interest?|pg||
nt|athene: it all needs agreements|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i assume west actually overruffed that|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: but now the defence can't stop the @S8 scoring|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: this might catch a raise from north|pg||
nt|athene: sort of a 2-way shot|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Though it is not exactly a good 3NT contract|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT a lucky make -- split and finesse, with every card pulling full weight|pg||
nt|athene: you might want to do it to stop opps bidding 2@S|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: that is very aggressive 3@D call, and quite successful this time|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: the @D10 is in the "wrong" hand too to pick up 4-1 splits - would be better if south had it as you are ok against @DJxxx with east|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: not without peeking anyway|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence get too busy in clubs you don't need the heart finesse|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe this game is within the odds, vulnerable|pg||
nt|kit: East knows he is doomed -- declarer must have ace of spades and king of diamonds for 3@D call|pg||
nt|athene: (if they cash out all the clubs your long club is the ninth trick)|pg||
nt|kit: So maybe he should shift to a hearts, as how could he possible do this with the king looking at dummy?|pg||
nt|kit: It could conceivably talk declarer into a losing line of play -- I don't see any other chance he has.|pg||
nt|athene: he is trying to work out what losing alternative lines declarer might have|pg||

pc|c9|pc|h7|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: in many ways very thin contracts are relatively easy to play|pg||

nt|ianmcc: I have a spec says it's off|pg||
nt|sommer: Bocchi/Madala bid the 6@D too..of course|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs (lauria versace i think) play for example that 1nt - 2@H double is takeout of spades|pg||
nt|hawe45: One looser in each suit, seems correct|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H being a transfer i mean|pg||
nt|athene: EW might well try 5minor|pg||
nt|athene: east surely isn't passing anything but a pure penalty double?|pg||
nt|athene: @SA lead against 5@C would be unfortunate perhaps|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C wasn't exactly best in trick 2|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can perhaps still survive by ruffing hearts and unblocking the diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: lucky 3N for NS but will not get there|pg||

nt|athene: giving declarer a pitch for a diamond - then if he can ruff two hearts he can make|pg||
nt|hawe45: They will not bid 5@C before midnight...|pg||
nt|athene: and throwing a club loser from dummy when he does|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobholl: east has a nice hand but no bid :)|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: there he goes |pg||

nt|athene: ("bid to the level of your fit")|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: i predict 5@C from east now|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of situation where it's much better to have screens|pg||
nt|bobholl: not strong enough for a "normal" weak 2|pg||
nt|athene: many would overcall 1@S with that east hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: repsonsive type |pg||
nt|fann4: But here it's neither|pg||
nt|psyck: likely stop here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..he felt maybe too strong for jump to 4@S??|pg||
nt|athene: at club level, it only takes a slight variation in tempo|pg||
nt|athene: for west to double fast with a trump trick and slightly slower with values outside spades|pg||
nt|athene: and E knows when to leave and when to pull :)|pg||
nt|athene: i see so many pairs doing this and they might not even realise it is dodgy :)|pg||
nt|athene: decent suit texture|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: even over 1@s pas he has no good bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Smolanko's raise to 2H inadequate - that's what he would bid with a balanced minimum, and this hand is anything but|pg||
nt|psyck: strong being 15+ maybe|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: end 2@D |pg||
pc|sT|nt|fann4: A spectator just messged that it shows 15-17 with 5@D and 4@H.|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: making 11 ruff a @S & K@H placed |pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: could be the 1st big swing now|pg||
nt|athene: never lead unsupported aces just because partner bid the suit! :) ok this was a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo tends to overcall aggressively at the 1-level so he might well|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C preclude to invite in @H i guess|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jameslee 2: @H 3/3 for the 11 trick |pg||
nt|psyck: Papi understandably did not want to play in 1N with an unbalanced hand|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|woozle: 3H initially should incite Anderson to bid game, diagnosing the short diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|woozle: Still, making 3 or 4 will be worth 1-2 imps, potentially vlauable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree peter. I cannot see any reason for 2@c|pg||
nt|pelu: @DQ is the 100% normal lead - but - again - a trump would have worked better|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: taking a long time to find that big s fit|pg||
nt|athene: now the problem is if declarer uses the @DA to lead a heart up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, it was certainly an uncomfortable lead situation for S|pg||
nt|fann4: Many would just pass 1N, on the basis that pard is likely to have some @C, having skipped both majors.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sommer: ..and this slam isn't good...but it makes|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: NS would open 1@C with any balanced hand i think|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|woozle: Klinger's "raise" to 2H in the other room just as bad, but then he compounded it by defending 3D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: agree again, but @c10 can solve the trumph suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: but can't west have akxxxx ax x xxx thats enough for 4@S|pg||

pc|h3|nt|psyck: we will not see a new leader yet|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|d4|nt|fann4: On bd 6 in the OR, N very conservatively passed 2@H (here N jumped straight to 4@H), so a missed game for MIR|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|woozle: Klinger seems to be toying with a 54321 point count...armed with that method, the North hand is just average in high cards (15)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 13 and 4333 is|pg||
nt|cuttysark: nearly half the points tied up in AQ doubleton?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|no maj|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But also one 10 and all those 9's|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|an|cue bid heart fit|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Now we will see if Nunes treats his hand as a minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He doesn't|pg||
nt|kit: Is there a way to make 12 tricks here?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kit: Yes, on squeeze -- but might not be found|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: north gets squeezed in the minors|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: if declarer works it all out|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|kit: Interesting --on club lead vs. 6@H, sets up ruffing finesse.  Without club led, squeeze is there|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|athene: 4nt might be Turbo|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: (even number of keycards)|pg||
nt|kit: likely will get spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One thing is certain; it will take Fantoni a while to play this|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So what do I know :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You will have time to walk your turtle, specs|pg||
nt|kit: king of hearts right way to start hearts, since heart spots good enough to pick up 108xx in North hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: well, small heart might be ok too, since if north plays the queen you can finesse the 9, but then you lose out to north being brilliant from @HQ10 doubleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Low from a doubleton in Poland|pg||
nt|kit: This will help declarer's entry situation -- and when spades show to be 6-2, squeeze will be sure thing.|pg||
nt|athene: yes this lead might well give declarer the information he needs|pg||
nt|kit: he could safely play queen from Q10x if East has shown 5-card suit|pg||
nt|athene: one thing i know from watching fantoni a lot is, if he manages to get to about trick 8 with a winning line there, he will almost always find it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcp: ===@S@S == Running Ranking ==@S@S===|pg||
nt|kit: Why not play the 7 -- -- lead might have been from 8x|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Vugraphzcp: 1. Sbarigia (104)        6. Fornaciari (74)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Vugraphzcp: 2. Miroglio (95)         7. Lavazza (69)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzcp: 5. Sabbatini (72)      10. Nostro (48)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcp: ===================================|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Now it's likely to be from shortness. Not many like to lead from Jxx or Jxxx|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, we can expect Fulvio to make this - but perhaps not soon|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: if he reads the lead as a doubleton that is all that is needed to get it all right|pg||
nt|athene: everything else follows from that as he will find the spade count|pg||
nt|kit: when he gets the major-suit count, he can't go wrong I don't think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Fantoni finesses hearts next, Kowalski will probably exit a heart in order not to give Fantoni clues as to the diamond layout|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: no way small heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The @D6 next would be revealing|pg||
nt|kit: that can never be right -- North wouldn't have played 8 of hearts from Q108|pg||
nt|athene: @HJ- @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Ba|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: that was the jack i would have thought|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: now @SAQ and it's all revealed|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer may think of ruffing out queen of clubs while spade entries in dummy, but that doesn't look percentage|pg||
nt|athene: usually the "easy" discard is your long card from a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|athene: i think north deliberately did NOT throw a club|pg||
nt|athene: because a club pitch there|pg||
nt|athene: with those clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: just says to the world "i have five"|pg||
nt|kit: good point about the discard -- could throw declarer off|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s3|pc|d2|nt|athene: but my money is on +980|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: North discarding very deceptively -- might work|pg||
nt|athene: if any specs are not sure about the winning line - declarer just has to work out that north has both minors held|pg||
nt|athene: he cashes all his major suit winners and north must give something up|pg||
nt|athene: north can see what is coming and is trying to put declarer off|pg||
nt|ritong: figuring long @ss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks for explaining that. Many specs are not familiar with squeezes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I got 3 questions about it already|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is a squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: some people might think that all north has to do is keep the clubs and diamonds and whatever is thrown from dummy; he can throw the same|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer thinks North started with 4 clubs and the diamond guard, he will still play for squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: but|pg||
nt|athene: that @D3 in east's hand is the killer|pg||
nt|athene: north has to keep two diamonds even if dummy has not|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||

nt|psyck: surprising to get comparisions here, considering that they both started with same boards & Fantoni playing other room :)|pg||
nt|athene: where you want to play is 3nt from the north seat|pg||

nt|athene: (board 7)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@c trick + 2 tricks in major = 7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must be -2 as I see it|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bobholl: rigth but very difficult with KQJ 6th |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2 or 3@h from N?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: nunes couldn't open a weak-2 of course as 2@S for him is 10-13|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 4@S ew|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@h would be my bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|andyv:  will be interesting if they get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east knows he wants to sac in 4@S over 4@H and perhaps is trying a sort of semi-psychic bid suggesting a strong raise|pg||
nt|athene: in the hope of not getting doubled|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ianmcc: I've looked in vain in the bidding boxes|pg||
nt|andyv:  they might now|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C 10-13 unbalanced with 5+@C; 2@D ask; 2@H 3 or 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: welcome Ralf |pg||
mb|2H|nt|woozle: 3NT will certainly be reached...Brown will be happy for a certainly flat board...Klinger won't be|pg||
nt|bobholl: but should go down|pg||
nt|fann4: This is not a particularly great slam, but EW could climb quite high here.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if they try to go to 6@H |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d either nmf or some kind of GF checkback|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 2@D may be GF relais (stronger than 2@C)|pg||
nt|sommer: "double check-back|pg||
nt|athene: 5-level is wrong yet again|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobholl: on a @S lead it makes but on @D ??|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks a little pushy, especially NV|pg||
nt|athene: but he has all four tens|pg||
nt|athene: and all four are potentially working very hard|pg||
nt|athene: for example give partner @HJxx on a  heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: and the @H10 saves your skin|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Uggeri will finally get on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead might be worst for N|pg||
nt|andyv:  S|pg||
nt|athene: sadly partner doesn't have @HJxx :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: It´s a long way... Why not a direct 4@h after the rebid 1nt from W?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 3 nt will be ok |pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H made in other room on previous hand so angelini loses|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good stop |pg||
nt|fann4: On bd 7 in the OR, NS amazingly reached the cold 3N.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: as the cards lay down|pg||
nt|fann4: 22 high card points between them, no particularly long suits and it's cold.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: duck first @s and partner will show his entry|pg||
nt|bobholl: ay ay now even 2 down but not bad play|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||

pc|h9|nt|athene: is there any chance to make this?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: cash @CAK and play ace and a diamond, hope for a ruff and discard?|pg||
nt|fann4: And it's vul too, so new leader coming up.|pg||
nt|psyck: could afford safety play in @h|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if other team go & make as spec tell me 12 is cold on a squeeze |pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: or hope for a minor suit squeeze now|pg||
nt|andyv:  after cashing @hs, @d switch should set this|pg||
nt|athene: no play for this as long as someone keeps spades and someone keeps diamonds|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could be a big swing here |pg||
nt|psyck: only after @c lead|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: cash the @CK and run the hearts|pg||

mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: You may be able to figure out who that person is|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an|FG, maybe without !c if !d support|nt|athene: interesting 2@C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: obviously no forcing diamond raise available|pg||
nt|athene: well, either that or it's a tactical move heading for 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told it's artificial GF - that's sort of normal these days i guess|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|3N|nt|ritong: also, a player of this caliber avoids " tactical" moves without apparent reason|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: feeding part with wrong info at early stage of the auction is extremely dangerous|pg||
nt|athene: nunes isn't put off by the announcement of strength|pg||
nt|athene: he knows that 2@C is just a diamond raise|pg||
nt|athene: and he trusts his shape|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: west obviously thought 4@S was making or one down - and 5-5 shape does have a lot of playing strength once you catch a 4-card fit|pg||
nt|athene: still quite aggressive though|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: swing on which side played from -- in other room South declared, so king of spades was protected.|pg||
nt|athene: of course diamonds better played from south as in the other room, no way for the defence to attack the spades so declarer can set up either a heart or club for a discard|pg||
nt|kit: beat you by 2 seconds :)|pg||

nt|chilloncan: hi krishna:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board 7 swing for Miro playing 3nt |pg||

mb|1C|nt|ianmcc: the clock is ticking|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: slams a plenty today|pg||
nt|athene: so best is diamond ruff, then spade shift, for -2?|pg||
nt|athene: (i am talking about the defence to 4@H of course sorry)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s?|pg||
nt|bobholl: the first 4@S on this table until now the only sizeable difference :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobholl: 4@S good save |pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobholl: much less easy to reach 3NT now|pg||
nt|andyv:  slam depends on lead....unless E can get to play 6@c|pg||
nt|athene: east would like to splinter now except he really hates that diamond lead coming through his @DKJxx|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 6@C now ?|pg||
nt|pelu: strange that Giubilo only bid 2@S - green against red|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fann4: No game makes here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: 4@s has its chances|pg||
nt|fann4: I meant NS:)|pg||
nt|psyck: rite :)|pg||
nt|fann4: hang on, in 3N on a @S lead, won't W get squeezed on 6 rounds of @D?|pg||
nt|psyck: it would be a good vul 'sac' to find though :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: hard-ish for north to find the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: but the defence might get a second chance if declarer tries an immediate club|pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead |pg||
nt|bobholl: aq or 9 of @D ?|pg||
nt|athene: of course there is risk in this bid especially as partner will tend not to have four hearts (no negative double)|pg||
nt|andyv:  3NT a bit myopic (as well as where is the @h stopper?)|pg||
nt|athene: but it looks reasonable enough|pg||
nt|athene: if the play with KJxx in opp's suit doesn't bid notrumps who is going to?|pg||
nt|athene: the player|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 2@s leavs a wideopen way for EW|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: over 3@S N could bid 4@S|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|woozle: Anderson bids his spades...with 4162 or 4072 it would be more tempting to respond 1NT (to give a chance of bidding diamonds later) but this hand can pass a 2C rebid in comfort|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: woe|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie's bold opening lead will permit at least one overtrick|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: look like it Jeff|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 5@C exclusion?|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he sees he has missed 6@C despite the bad @D points|pg||
nt|andyv:  old fashioned here Bill, I'd like a better stopper in unbid suit than the stiff 9 of @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: A club looks more ordinary, but maybe he fancied his chances of catching dummy with 4531.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: bold=?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..nope..just the shot|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt agree with that leap|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as I play 3@d shows a 5(+) -5and after 3@s from N 4@h describes a good hanf with 5350|pg||
nt|sommer: Exclusion, no?|pg||
nt|sommer: I would for sure bid 5@C...but thats me:)|pg||

nt|sommer: S may get shortened, yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cdant see how he can drop S|pg||

nt|jcomyn: wrong again jeepers|pg||
nt|sommer: ..for an overtrick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This is a typical hand where you should play 6@h because of ruffing @c with the short trumphlength|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also han play 7@h|pg||

nt|athene: what was west thinking?|pg||

nt|athene: how you going to make 3nt when partner could not open the bidding?|pg||
nt|athene: i like 4@C|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: you have a good offence-defence ratio|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|athene: your hand is worth 6 1/2 tricks in clubs and about zero in any other suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very little defence, certainly|pg||

pc|s3|nt|athene: Fantoni nunes seem to get a lot of big penalties|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You may like 4@C better than 3, but this worked beautifully|pg||
nt|kit: On this hand the 3@C call worked better, as it gave opponents room to hang themselves.  Opening 4@Cmight have ended in 4@C doubled|pg||
nt|athene: didn't they take someone for 1400 and 800 earlier today|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If only we knew when to double, as they seem to do unerringly|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: One with a trap pass at the 1 level, the other one after a 0-11 hcp response|pg||

nt|athene: one thing about 3nt is it's harder to double|pg||
nt|athene: unless someone really has the world it can be hard for him to know you have not got nine tricks somewhere|pg||
nt|ritong: the idea being that, particularly against guys who seldom open 6 baggers at the three level, you will know how many times ducking is needed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And harder to defend, as a rule|pg||

nt|andyv:  did W hand have to be that good?  could W have bid 3@c on Qx, Kxx, x, AKJxxxx?|pg||
nt|athene: and the answer is, you will find out when you score up :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: we will see that shortly :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the result ok - but the play :(:(|pg||
nt|fann4: I think 6@H always makes - N gets caught in a minor suit squeeze if declarer can read the situation.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: bidding starts the same way at his table|pg||
mb|1H|nt|woozle: Christie overcalls with a rather less good hand than the one which Buchen passed earlier|pg||
nt|fann4: Note the pass by E on an 8 card suit. Very disciplined.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 5@d would be more interesting to watch than 3N here...may require @dJ finess in 5@d...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobholl: i would say :(:(:(|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, but may just take finesses instead of playing for squeeze|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|woozle: Smolanko starts with 2S...a 3S splinter or fit jump in diamonds might have been better options, if available|pg||
nt|sommer: it is best chance|pg||
nt|chilloncan: transfer overcall it seems|pg||
nt|psyck: @c fin that is|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|psyck: we have been speculating quite a vit on their string @c defense :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: or is it "majors-or-minors" or something of that ilk?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ianmcc: lead change|pg||
nt|woozle: Smolanko's 4C doesn't really do justice to his playing strength...Anderson didn't know how good his hand was (there didn't have to be a stiff spade opposite)|pg||
nt|psyck: likely a suction variant, but other possibilities too maybe|pg||
nt|chilloncan: NS well on their way|pg||
nt|athene: might be "spades or..."|pg||
nt|athene: it has certainly caused some confusion, which is the general idea :)|pg||
nt|psyck: suction would be @s or the next two suits (minors) here|pg||
nt|fann4: Agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: but his partner bid 3@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like down 1 territory|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ianmcc: The auction went very nicely in OR|pg||
nt|woozle: EW had the early running in the auction in the other room - East showed both majors, West jumped to 3S...North judged aggressively (and successfully) to double...but 4S from West ...|pg||
nt|woozle: might have stolen the pot|pg||
nt|athene: north must think that 2@S set up a game force?|pg||
nt|athene: he would surely not bid 3@D there with so good a hand if he thought it was not forcing|pg||
nt|psyck: S has a maximum|pg||
nt|psyck: asuming pass of 1@h was les than 8 hcp|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i played suction ONCE. ishmael delmonte said "you are going to LOVE this". it came up, and when the smoke cleared we were -1400 againt a partial. i couldnt remember the details of ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it. so i said "got any more  gadgets i will love?":)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: made is fairly good possible|pg||
nt|athene: was west going to bid 4@S over 4@D, i wonder?|pg||
nt|athene: that would be a bit of a view|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Try DONTTON next time Marshall :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W needs to shift now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C was gazilli i suppose ?|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 4@S down 2 on @H-ruff? - Verdace in 3NT - @H-lead and S has to find @d10 in on @SA - adn N has to take the 2. @D with @dA - very difficult defense|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: something must have gone wrong if 1400 vs nothing :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the auction developed extremely well for S here. was able to pass first, and then in that context could bid strongly|pg||
nt|athene: i mean surely you could have escaped for only 11 :)|pg||
nt|athene: east was perhaps wondering if his diamond spot there was suit preference|pg||
nt|athene: in case the @DK was a singleton|pg||
nt|andyv:  but this won't do it|pg||
nt|bobholl: even the 8 helps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: Suction variants: http://bridge.thomasoandrews.com/psycho.html|pg||
nt|chilloncan: endplayed opp for -14|pg||
nt|fann4: I can't understand why W continued to 3N over a passed partner who bid 2@C then 3@C|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sommer: he has 73% chance of making by taking @SA|pg||
nt|athene: south was a bit stuck if his partner bid hearts over 2@S, wasn't he?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nunes  started slam board 8 with a weak 1nt fantoni going for a @H slam invitation on the way to 6|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|fann4: What was he expecting opposite?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|woozle: 10 imps to Klinger, now in the lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bobholl: now you should have another @C to lead but alas|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: they are in controls position & 4nt call |pg||
nt|psyck: we are all foxed Jeff :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: does he just bid 3@S as a sort of "do something intelligent, partner" noise?|pg||
nt|psyck: I think needs !j fin now as i mentioned earlier|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|andyv:  750|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: can it ever be necessary to attack hearts there?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is worried declarer is getting rid of a heart with the ruffing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|athene: give declarer @HAx(x) or something|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chilloncan: presumably 2S meant something like "2+ places to play"|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fann4: The commentators busy discussing the play possibilities on bd 9 in 6@H, where Fantunes are beginning to get to.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: they @@h plays means he can manage with @h fin too|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c7|nt|athene: he needs the heart finesse, now, yes|pg||
nt|psyck: 6@h|pg||
mc|8|nt|jameslee 2: 6@H  in open room board 8  starting the card play |pg||
nt|fann4: yes, and Kit Woolsey has mentioned the squeeze, if declarer can figure it all out.|pg||
nt|psyck: If fantoni is playing it, it will take a while before we see the score :)|pg||
pg||

nt|ritong: our pole friends are having real bad time|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|ritong: polish*|pg||
nt|kit: Likely raise, and West will re-open |pg||
nt|athene: north might just show a sound 3-card raise immediately here|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@H is a common way|pg||
nt|kit: so they should get to same 3@D contract|pg||
nt|athene: playing transfers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Some play redbl to show the 3card raise|pg||
nt|athene: well people often redouble and then bid spades to show a strong 3-card raise - that's the normal way with no special methods|pg||
nt|kit: All these artificial raises make life easier for opponents, giving them things to double, room to bid at low levels|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe east is pondering right now|pg||
nt|ritong: north has not a very toàugh bid|pg||
nt|athene: well, in theory they may do, but in practice i think giving people more room just means they have more room for misunderstandings :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't you like to distinguish between a bad and constructive raise, Kit?|pg||
mb|2H|an|weak or GF with !S|nt|Walddk2: 2@H is the constructive raise|pg||
nt|athene: he does it by not accepting a game try with the bad raise :)|pg||
nt|athene: obviously they play 1@S X 2@S as constructive|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I do Roland if I really have game interest, but I'm pointing out that there is a price tag.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: oh, ok, interesting twist on a familiar idea|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H as weak or strong - fair enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 3@D??? no way|pg||
nt|ritong: weird|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i don't believe 3@D there|pg||
nt|athene: i believe X pass 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Vugraphzcp: sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: np ba|pg||
nt|athene: it might seem odd to have two very different strenths in the same bid but it actually makes a lot of sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you have two widely disparate hand types it's easy to differentiate between them later one|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: later on|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: with rubbish you just pass, with a game force you bid game, or double opps, or something :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Yes, but giving opponents a free double of 2@H with the weak hand gives away a lot!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: yes, it does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unlawful 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: not mentioning pass first reopening later, as fantoni just did|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: as you said, there is a price tag|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Fantoni would have doubled at MP but of course not at IMPs|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps people feel that letting opps make a lead directing double in a suit which is lower-ranking than yours - well, that's not so bad|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: you are going to outbid them anyway|pg||
nt|kit: Are you (at 3-level)?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: well that is the rationale, i am not saying it's clearly correct|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||

nt|woozle: It's easy to be critical, but it would be shortsighted to deny Five Card Standard some of the blame - North had to tread very carefully lest he be facing a balanced minimum with ...|pg||
nt|woozle: three clubs (and potentially, spade wastage)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe there are layouts where it is necessary|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: fantoni declarer |pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|woozle: Who's bidding 4S?|pg||
nt|athene: another strong club for north|pg||
nt|athene: but this time east can't weave his evil spells|pg||
nt|athene: not having a 5-card suit :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: garazzo still thinking in other room at 5 level in @C|pg||
nt|athene: but in general it's wrong to attack any suit where dummy has a decent holding|pg||
nt|bobholl: (previous board)|pg||
nt|athene: because declarer can't get rid of his losers there anyway|pg||
nt|psyck: 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: and bad 5/0 distribution suit @S |pg||
nt|psyck: 4@s does look ok seeing just NS cards :)|pg||
mb|r|nt|jameslee 2: 6@H fantoni ,lead  4@D |pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: admittedly, the lack of a 5-card suit doesn't stop many people from weaving over strong clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: Well, we will be avle to rule out DONTTON & narrow down on Suction if E doesnt act :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|ianmcc: you just suggested it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: stiff sk again. slams are growing out of ther woodwork|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: sorry, last hand....who's doubling and who's passing the double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting gain of 3 imps for Fornaciari on board 8..3N by NS, 1@h there by EW|pg||
nt|athene: NS cheerfully play weak (and offshape) notrump throughout|pg||
nt|athene: and they seem to escape disaster most of the time|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@C - if u only see the EW-cards|pg||
nt|fann4: The smart money is on E to make 6@H on bd 8|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: another slam 6@s on a finess (but a stiff @sK in front)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: how about "wuction"? stands for wet suction  - you don't bid on 4-4 shapes|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wouldn't describe Claudio as cheerful:)|pg||
nt|athene: haha|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Fantoni is already counting 12 tricks on @h fin then :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|woozle: Buchen (foolishly to my mind) tries doubling 3NT, but a spade lead could be the last thing that he needs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Buchen making it worse|pg||
nt|athene: interesting 1nt here - i wonder is this a forcing notrump?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Today, it's cold on any lead and he turns -7 imps into -9, but another non-rare outcome will be to talk his partner off the killing lead|pg||
nt|woozle: Smolanko runs. That didn't occur to me, with good spades and the doubler not on lead|pg||
nt|athene: looks strange otherwise with 3-card support|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: north obviously didn't think it was a forcing notrump|pg||
nt|fann4: These days, many pairs play that over the x, 2@H is a sound 2@S raise.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: cant be bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt bet the way things are going|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2 control cards ar missing, so....|pg||
nt|sommer: I take the chance of commentators curse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..2 aces missing|pg||
nt|sommer: so he must jump now to 6@S... I doubt that|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1Nt and not 2@C by East?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C better than 3nt but wouldn't have made either|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: so it was a good X after all?|pg||
nt|woozle: 4C will make four, for a flat board an Klinger still in the lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and picked up 1 on 31|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mr duboin giving it plenty of thought|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S was forcing one round, might be only 4 spades|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, & 2@s a weaker raise|pg||
nt|fann4: right|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: is this a victim for the 5-carnd major opening?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fann4: so redouble and then support is a little more than 9|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|woozle: Someone suggested that the doubler might have solid hearts, but HE'S NOT ON LEAD|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Klinger also pulled out of the X|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to say who was at fault here without knowing the details of the system|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks after a @c lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: card... |pg||
pc|c5|nt|psyck: very few top losers, but very few tricks too here|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|fann4: Will 3@D make? GIB says no, but things can change.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: Now E known that it´s a finess slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry knows...|pg||
nt|sommer: yes...W told that nicely|pg||
nt|sommer: ..If I understood the bidding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I love even money |pg||
nt|jcomyn: my slams are usually about 20 per cent|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: still looks normal to rebid 2@c on 1N|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: if passing 1nt with that north hand was right, then south had to find a stronger bid with his hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: looks so :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck: trumps will cut down dec's trciks|pg||
nt|fann4: Now GIB says makeable - but remember that GIB is a double dummy analyser, seeing all 4 hands.|pg||
nt|psyck: now dec likely will cash @hk & x ruff|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|athene: meckstroth-rodwell play this style of 1major rebids after a strong club|pg||
nt|fann4: But declarer must play a @C or @HK now to make.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|psyck: as long as he does not try @h fin...|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: but responder shows right away the hcp count and whether 3 card support|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 5@c will also go down, because of the 3-0 in @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: did S count the @S ?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|athene: so 2@D would be 5-7 hcp with 3 spades here,for them, over 1@S, i think|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I goe an aspect from  a kib - 5@s is a very bad contract. either 4@s or 6@s|pg||
nt|athene: that would make north's life very easy|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|psyck: home now|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|d9|nt|athene: you might ask "well why not just have 1@S promise 5?" you can do that of course but then you are a bit stuck with hands with 4 spades and a 5- or 6-card minor - you have to rebid 2 ...|pg||
nt|athene: of the minor and it's possible to lose the major fit|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|ritong: difficult hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: megafit, two keys off but a void|pg||
nt|athene: but the wrong void|pg||
nt|kit: could easily get too high -- and diamond lead beats 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Note Garozzo's 2@C in the other room, showing both majors|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kit: worked very well, getting North to declare|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C bids are never natural these days|pg||
nt|athene: south bid 2@C here with a diamond raise a moment ago|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: garozzo doing it with 6-5 majors|pg||
nt|athene: what is the world coming to?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: now a negative double will right-side it|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: even better at that point|pg||
nt|ritong: but well judged|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Kowalski not going anywhere with two small diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that 1@C is normally 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|ritong: two imps away, though|pg||
nt|athene: would nunes lead @D6 from @D632?|pg||
nt|athene: i think he would|pg||
nt|athene: so not too east for fantoni here|pg||
nt|kit: Of course make North's king of diamonds the ace, throw away the queen of clubs, and slam is cold.  Would North have bid 4@D with that?|pg||
nt|ritong: or not, since fantoni might try a small @s|pg||
nt|kit: He has to cash ace of diamonds -- lead might be a stiff|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||

nt|sommer: ..and there was a risk of 6+% for @D 4-0 too...so..|pg||
nt|athene: after 1@C - 1@D, you are a bit behind standard bidders as you haven't shown any suits and you are a bit higher up|pg||
nt|psyck: I didn't exactly mean to make a prediction when I said we will have to wait longer for a new leader, but it seems to have worked out that way|pg||
nt|bobholl: alas the great garazzo passed 5@C|pg||
nt|fann4: NS need to steer clear of the 5 level here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I really agree with that aspect!|pg||

nt|jcomyn: mine either unduectaed yoke|pg||

nt|psyck: NS should not get overboard with no fit here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|woozle: No 7C for me today|pg||
nt|athene: north should definitely have passed the double of 1nt in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: he is balanced with values|pg||
nt|athene: this is soemthing that people often get wrong|pg||
nt|athene: they feel it's like a takeout double so they tend to bid their suits|pg||
nt|athene: but with strong balanced hand you just pass the double as a first action|pg||
nt|psyck: have ther reversed the cards?|pg||
nt|psyck: unless they can get N to play it :)|pg||

mb|2C|nt|sommer: I dont - exactly..wasnt W big favorite to hold @HAx(x) and @Cx instead?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding over the nature of the double - lots play X as artificial over strong notrump but you really want it as penalty over weak|pg||

nt|psyck: sensible stop, albeit helped by opps|pg||
nt|fann4: Swing potential on this board - NS did well to stay low, and also they right sided it.|pg||

nt|ritong: this guy does not waste so-called "baby imps"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So Fantoni knew there was one more diamond to cash|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: cashing ace of diamonds clear -- lead could be stiff, easy way to beat contract|pg||

nt|bobholl: he doubles 100% |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 8 tricks  we can see directly the 9th not easy |pg||
nt|fann4: East has to switch to the @S2 to beat this now|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: correct Povi! S is squeezed .|pg||
nt|athene: east can see no point plodding on with diamonds with no entry|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: I have a very simple rule. Act as early as possible ans don´t balance if you not are very sure that it is correct|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: so he tries to help his partner out a bit|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|athene: many specs point out north hasn't got 8-12|pg||
nt|athene: well, he has 11, but only if you count in base 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did Angelini really bid 2@D? Must be true, hard to believe|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he meant to bid 1@D and pulled the wrong card|pg||
nt|athene: the wrong bidding card|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sommer: ..and finesse!!:) ..of course|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but not any longer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He counted his kings twice I suppose|pg||
nt|bobholl: an overtrick even |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|psyck: ya, interesting @s position :)|pg||
nt|fann4: So said GIB. But I think declarer has to find the @HJ still to make.|pg||
nt|fann4: Bd 9 in the OR - same 5@D doubled.|pg||
nt|fann4: But played by N, so going  300 for another 5imps to ANG|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sommer: a shame|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: the cards do lie well for declarer - IF he reads them|pg||
nt|psyck: may have been trying to swing due to a couple of bad boards i guess|pg||
nt|athene: west endplayed in three suits now|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed how bad these natural sandwich notrumps are|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: the odds of partner being broke are just so high|pg||
nt|bobholl: prevents often stealing but now ??!!|pg||
nt|athene: even if you are worried about people responding on air all the time|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: contract home |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9 th trick a @S |pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: now declarer can unblock his @C8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: if he wants|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: more elegent than finesse but makes life simpler|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and S is endplayed for -1|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did, surely|pg||
nt|athene: you rarely find you really needed 1nt natural to avoid missing a game|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|athene: depends if he wants entries to hand|pg||
nt|athene: or if he wants to be able to cash the clubs smoothly any time|pg||
nt|athene: i suspect he would have unblocked the 8|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: east gets squeezed in spades and diamonds now|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|psyck: only 8 with the @s's|pg||
nt|athene: oh no sorry he needed another trick|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he could have guessed spades from west leading that club|pg||

nt|ritong: nunes' hand belongs to the " it makes or not" category facing a weak NT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: 4@D South African Texas = spades. 4@C would show hearts|pg||
nt|athene: well west might have given some thought to 3nt perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: that certainly would not have worked here, though :)|pg||
nt|kit: or even just transfer and invite -- if partner is passing the invite, do you really want to be in game?|pg||
nt|athene: a spec is asking if fantoni really opened 1nt|pg||
nt|cuttysark: of course he did :)|pg||
nt|ritong: well, his scorecard is bright, to say the least, perhaps he did not bother trying something " fancy"|pg||
nt|athene: yes, they play 1nt as a "catchall" for all the weak balanced-ish hands|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It' easy when @CJ is covered|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well i know there are many strong players who like it to be natural|pg||

mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: some number of S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Interesting board 9 - 7@s down 2!|pg||
nt|athene: but i just think the risk/reward ratio is not good|pg||
nt|athene: or at least you have to make it more like 17-19|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural or not, the bid still needed a source of tricks|pg||
nt|athene: good playing strength|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sometimes bridge is easy like on this board:)|pg||

nt|athene: i remember david burn saying very firmly why this was a bad idea|pg||
nt|athene: but everyone plays this way and it seems sensible to me|pg||
nt|pelu: sometimes the players makes easy to difficult :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Even without a @H ruff, 4@S goes 1 off here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: I predict 11 tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|sommer: ..a little less than 30% rather, I think|pg||
mb|3S|nt|woozle: I think Christie had to enquire to choose between 3NT and 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in the other room surely east had showed long clubs at some point so covering the club looks less appealing|pg||
nt|fann4: So long as NS don't wait too long to play @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: getting pushy|pg||
nt|sommer: after S' opening, W can upgrade his controlcards a lot|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and will raise...or should|pg||
nt|athene: sadly i wasn't really listening to david so i can't say what his reasoning was :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s true Peter:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @D now|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: With no singleton, 11 tricks in diamonds looks very distant|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Yes, thank you all - and the helpful spectators|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: 3nt on a diamond lead?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: heart lead beats it, but that's pretty double-dummy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: his problem is rather " what @d should i lead"  here, no matter|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Another point is that South did not raise spades or bid something else|pg||
nt|athene: the danger of partner pulling your re-opening double to a 4-card heart suit is very low in fact|pg||
nt|bobholl: but he won't|pg||
nt|fann4: clearly declarer did not play a low @H from hand |pg||
nt|fann4: Last board here now|pg||
nt|psyck: Well EW sure deserved to lose imps on 10 they way they handled it here :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Absolutely|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with 4 hearts he would double 1@S himself|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  didn't want to give up 3 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if he doesn't have a trap pass that is|pg||
nt|bobholl: dutch 2 (muiderberg) migth have kept NS out of @S |pg||
nt|fann4: It was 12 imps:)|pg||
nt|psyck: the more the merrier...for the kibs|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ianmcc: 3NT doesn't look good|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1nt "12+-15"|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a reasonable 1nt bid for west there over 1@S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit ligth :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W agrees with you Bob:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it's V with AJ sec|pg||
nt|athene: west just has 1400 in the wrong column on his scorecard :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will make a game try|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT might be their strong 4-card raise|pg||
nt|athene: that's quite common|pg||
nt|psyck: the boards have certainly been interesting this set|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: and 6 in a row|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D would be mixed|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  and before that a 1370 too|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: last board here ty to all Jeff&Krishna&specs|pg||
mb|2D|nt|woozle: I'm having difficulty believing Buchen's first round pass|pg||
nt|fann4: South 2@D and West 3@C?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: that's a fairly horrible 11 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Notrump wrong-sided but it would likely go down anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  which turns out to be 13 imps for Angelini as OR only got to 5@c|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Jeff & James.  Good job by our unnamed Operator. Thanks to the kibs for joinnig us & for their inputs.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Spade lead, diamond switch|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: take a point off for 4333, take another point off for the diamond spots, and take another point off for partner playing them better :) and what do you have left?|pg||
nt|andyv:  @hs can be guessed for one loser but bad @s break will sink 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Smolanko declining many opportunities to bid notrumps could cost dearly if Christie hits on the heart lead|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal.  Thanks to my co-commentators Bill & Roland.  Well done Operator. Thanks kibs for joining us & for their inputs.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H - P - P 2@S by S - and N will b9id 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fann4: Thanks Krishna and all.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ianmcc: my tip is@c|pg||
pc|sK|nt|woozle: Certainly, when your partner, marked with all of the values, didn't overcall over 1C, the only good suit he can have is clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: but E could bid 2nt :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|woozle: Thoughtful lead, but it leaves the result in limbo for the moment. Still probably down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the curse strikes again|pg||
