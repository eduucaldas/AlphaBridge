nt|sunit:  still low dia is good defense|pg||
nt|henryb:  I tnink declarer should get @d right because there was no diamond lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  a defender with the @dQ and nothing in clubs would be more likely to lead a diamond at trick 1|pg||
nt|sunit:  prabhakar is a very sharp player, he might get it right|pg||
nt|sunit:  the only time it will cost when his partner was dealt with kj in the trump suit|pg||

nt|rv: P.Sridhar and Sundarram are most long running partnership in Indian bridge|pg||
nt|rv: they have been playing together for nearly 25 yrs|pg||
nt|rv: Pritish Kushari used to work and play for Indian Railways and has won Ruia trophy 5 times|pg||

nt|key1809: after the 4th suit auction, what will south bid is the question, will he show the 6th spade, which subhash did in the closed room, or the dmd support|pg||
mb|2H|nt|key1809: but prabhakar opens 2h spoiling an uncontested auction|pg||
nt|sunit:  if declarer was 5/5 difficult to beat |pg||
nt|henryb:  just became even more difficult|pg||
mb|3H!|an|m+m|nt|Walddk2: Diamond support as 2 spade unlikely after North shows at least 5-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|sunit:  now 6d possible|pg||
nt|key1809: sumit might already be considering 6d |pg||
nt|sunit:  if east bids 4h|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h is any 2-suiter?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|key1809: that will make it easier i guess, on their way now|pg||
nt|sunit:  both minors i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you show spades and another?|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Leaping Michaels, maybe?|pg||
nt|key1809: 12 to DSM|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If strong enough, yes|pg||
nt|sunit:  huge pick up for dsm|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How good is 6@D?|pg||
nt|key1809: V good, as its making:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  with the weak 2, fairly good, because it makes the @s finesse a big favorite|pg||
nt|sunit:  sumit and bhabhesh have been playing really well in this tournament|pg||
pc|d5|nt|key1809: yes, sumit will finesse spapdes, rather than ruffing em out, as the cards lie, whatever he does succeeds|pg||
nt|henryb:  Interesting problem for W: might have to cash partner's @sA in case it could disappear on dummy's clubs|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|sunit:  as long as he decides to play on spades good chance of making unless he takes a ruffing hook which is unlikely|pg||

nt|sga1: Four session to go, only 8 imps difference, any thing possible.|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari should have exited with @ck on winning @SK in last deal, SS was one 1 down|pg||
nt|rv: all 3 teams in the trials are fairly evenly matched though Formidables have the best form in recent months, I anticipate semis and finals to be very close and go down to the wire|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables have been seeded to finals because they won 2 of the 3main qualifying events for the trials, both Summer and Winter Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: Texans won 3rd qualifying event National Masters with very different quorum of team, hence had to pay 5 lacks as direct entry to participate here|pg||
nt|rv: DSM qualified as runner-up of Summer Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: runner-up of Winter Nationals, Poddar Developers did not field team here because of some internal issues, very sad indeed|pg||
nt|rv: 5 lacks translates to 0.5 million rupees, about 10,000 USD:)|pg||
nt|rv: as per current exchange rate approx 11,000 USD|pg||
nt|rv: we have power failure at the venue, lost internet connectivity which means access to game and for Subhash Gupta to be ungagged|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables represented India the maximum times in last decade or so, they have won BFAME 4 times, reached QFs of Bermuda Bowl twice as well as R16 in Rosenblum during this period|pg||
nt|rv: apologies folks, waiting for power and connectivity to be back|pg||
nt|rv: I am not at the venue, doing commentary from home|pg||
nt|rv: P.Sridhar has won silver and bronze medal as part of Texan Aces in 2 successive European Open tournies, SS was part of team when they won bronze and Sumit was part of team when ...|pg||
nt|rv: they silver|pg||
nt|rv: pls stick around, let me call up folks at venue and check|pg||
nt|rv: power just back|pg||
nt|rv: we should be on in a couple of mins|pg||
nt|rv: they do have power back-up / generator at the venue, surprising it is taking awhile|pg||
nt|rv: according to BFI MPs, Pritish Kushari must be amongst the top 3 or 4 MPs holder in the country, he has earned most of the points as part of all-conquering Indian Railways team|pg||
nt|panja: symmetric North hand in blacks....difficult for W to know the best shift unless E could guid|pg||
nt|panja: guide even|pg||
nt|subhranp: slam board early in the day|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: for nearly a decade from mid-90s, Indian Railways used to have monopoly of all National team events|pg||
nt|panja: light opening...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: play was lost due to some disturbance sry|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sarkar_suk: neck to neck fight nice to watch sudhir :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|chilloncan: S should open with that hand|pg||
nt|sga1: How many would open 3@d with that hand vul, literally 9 loser hand. I would not.|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes :)|pg||
nt|rv: great, we are back on and hi again to Subhash Gupta|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|santyclz: Six @ds looks like the spot here.|pg||
nt|key1809: 6d making , lest see ,they can reach or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: 3nt easier here than 4h|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|chilloncan: when you dont have spades, you have to get in early or they may make it too awkward for you to compete|pg||
nt|sga1: Doesn't fall into any rule 2-3-4 or not even for aggressive players with 2-3-4-5 rule.|pg||
nt|offthebend: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: Excelente Resultado para N-S en la otra sala|pg||
nt|panja: true...with extra strength...and near balanced hands..it is always worthwhile exploring 3N in preference to 4 of a Major|pg||
nt|panja: here though, with all the Aces, North is likely to prefer a @S game|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: .|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sarkar_suk: thats a good lead for declarer :)|pg||
nt|sga1: 4 quick tricks for defense.|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: 2n presumably jacoby, 3h probably showing 6carder heart|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sarkar_suk: nw trump shift shd be :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: tightly contested semi final so far and I am sure it is going that way till the end |pg||
nt|rv: I might have bid 2n or 3@h with Sridhar's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: But trump shift can only help if N switches to @d after winning @sK|pg||
nt|sga1: so that 2nd trump can also be removed.|pg||
nt|panja: there was that other issue....did S show 5@S with this bidding? his next bid gives us the answer...NO|pg||
nt|panja: so 4@S, it will be...or will it go further?|pg||
nt|subhranp: could go higher|pg||
nt|panja: BTW Subhran, what is 2@D for you?|pg||
nt|panja: 12+?|pg||
nt|subhranp: this could prove costly for DSM|pg||
mb|4C|nt|subhranp: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: both 3n and 4@h have excellent play for N-S|pg||
nt|panja: I was wondering whey Keyzad bid 2@D rather than 2@S|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S would have shown 9-10 or so....|pg||
mb|5D|nt|chilloncan: S actually is not even minimum by Losing Trick Count standards, has playabiulity in at least 2 suits, only mild rebid problems, and can open the suit she wants led. all that adds ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: up to a clear opening bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: if he guesses everything right, this could make|pg||
nt|panja: but that is rather unlikely|pg||
nt|panja: on the @CK lead...with correct @S view..there is a red suit squeeze on West|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes right panja..|pg||
nt|subhranp: one can trust keyzad to find those lines|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: play on deal 1 was lost due to some disterbunce sorry all|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panja: Williaim Watson suggests that is the only option.....@CKQ must be in, W must hold 5 @D 4!M..so East must hold 4 Spades to make!|pg||
nt|panja: 5@H4@H, that is|pg||
nt|panja: Keyzad could conjure all that up..he is quite capable of thinking of a way to make this|pg||
nt|panja: and E's first @D will tell him W holds 5@D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sga1: now -2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rv: Sundarram is possibly abs minimum for his double and 2@h especially with modern style of O/Cs till 17/18 hcp|pg||
nt|subhranp: laltu not showing any kings so that should end the auction|pg||
nt|ayan: N-S play 2nt as Natural promising 2 + trump|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sarkar_suk: thats not good line i think sudhir :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h3|nt|sga1: yes|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|rv: Sridhar took a very pessmistic view in my opinion|pg||
nt|subhranp: play should be very quick|pg||
nt|ayan: Kushari will play for the @s Q |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|santyclz: It happens, pramod.  Nothing to worry about.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|c3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|alamiro: Ultima mano del torneo|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and the very predictable result of passing has in fact befallen S. big pickup, and a badly  needed one,  for the trailing team|pg||
pc|s7|nt|alamiro: Felicitaciones al equipo Cuevas proximo representante de Chile en categoria damas oara el sudamericano ha realizarse en paraguay del 11 al 18 de junio |pg||

nt|rv: Subhash Gupta is affectinately called Guruji (master) in Indian bridge circles:)|pg||
nt|rv: Guruji what would be your recommended auction in last deal?|pg||
nt|subhranp: well..i wouldnt bet against a DSM vs Form final now|pg||
nt|subhranp: form getting a few imps back on that one|pg||
nt|key1809: subhash thought it more important to show his 6s, rather than 4c dmd support|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: interesting board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ayan: Hi Subs, looks like we will have a full house pretty soon|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW have 5D|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|sga1: it could be 2@h/3@H depending on whether NS would compete to 3@C or not.|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor sridhar already stretched his 5 points to make a noise|pg||
nt|subhranp: venky could have continue hearts there to put some more pressure|pg||
mb|1H|nt|subhranp: NS are odds on to make 4S here|pg||
nt|ayan: looks like 3 @c is rev bergen |pg||
nt|subhranp: well both Venky and Subhash quiet so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: ok back to this one, Kushari's 2n is jacoby, 4+@h, semibal hand, GF|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sarkar_suk: ofcourse no question of game reach :)|pg||
nt|subhranp: venky coming in aggressively here, finding the spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: 2NT here was natural, opening hand.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|subhranp: i think the format of this event this time puts formidables at a bit of disadvantage to start with. they dont have time to settle down|pg||
nt|subhranp: quiet partial this time|pg||
nt|subhranp: 2nt also makes as cards are|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sga1: not Jacoby which many prefer.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rv: Jacoby responses have been tailored a lot by different partnerships, traditionally 3 level bids show stiff and 4 level second 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ayan: Very unlike Guruzi Bid, I must admit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|subhranp: kushari should find the heart lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: looks like Kushari-Laltu have their own home-grown method here|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|subhranp: possibly the vulnerability made them keep quiet|pg||
pc|h7|nt|santyclz: I read recently that it's right to rebid a 5 card major on these auctions on the grounds that pd may have 3.  I remain unconvinced.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- I did miss -- PS was forced to bid 2D over the T/O dbl -- in that case , he could take one more bid -- like 2S  over 2H|pg||
nt|subhranp: assuming DSM goes through, they should look to capitalize on the initial rustiness (if any) of Formidables today|pg||
nt|ayan: now Venky may try for the @c J|pg||
nt|subhranp: trump back also should be ok here|pg||
nt|subhranp: if venky backs a trump then declarer should look to setup hearts|pg||

mb|3S|nt|rv: Lavazza won Yeh Bros earlier after crushing performance against Sweden in finals, Sweden conceded match after trailing by more than 100 IMPs after 3rd segment|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sga1: Is it forcing pass?|pg||
nt|ayan: Nice contract|pg||
nt|subhranp: kushari should make this|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Debgiri.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: ofcourse yes :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Now they r heading for 6@S which is cold.|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes|pg||
nt|dslee: was watching in the open room, deal 44 is a huge pick up for DSM, Sumit has bid 6@D and in all possibilities it would make|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|babs59: hi.  Board 3 in Open Room Bhabesh couldn't be stopped from coming in with 3@D, so now in 5@D|pg||
nt|dslee: Hi Joe|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt wouldn't have occurred to me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I was aware of protest given by Ashok Goel on the strictness of penalty of 2 IMPs in every session played the pair, BFI is yet to revert back|pg||
nt|subhranp: good lead sets up heart winner for defence|pg||
nt|dslee: 2NT is a special bid here from Kushari which shows a speciality hand 14-15 points with 5-5|pg||
nt|dslee: 4@C from Laltu is a relay to know the other 5 cards|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, that makes a big difference.|pg||
nt|dslee: was in the venue till last round - Sumit and Bhabesh in great spirits - they are playing very well in this tournament|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|chilloncan: i wonder what 4C was|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|sarkar_suk: uff :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Actually they can make this as well :)|pg||
nt|ayan: Both Sumit and Bhabesh are agressive bidders |pg||
nt|subhranp: as I said yesterday, Formidables are getting straight into the finals. so they dont have time to settle down. So DSM should exploit this in the initial couple of sets|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Rafa: el equipo ganador de este match representará a Chile el 11 de Junio en Asunción, Paraguay|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|sarkar_suk: gr8:)|pg||
nt|sga1: only 1 rnd of trump|pg||
nt|sga1: Needs absolutely Double Dummy play which seems possible here.|pg||
nt|sga1: Surprising part is N preferred to play is 5-card suit headed by 9 in comparison to a 7-card suit headed by AQJ :)|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Rafa: Welcome to the chilean women teams trials final|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|chilloncan: please excuse any terrible spanish i might accidentally use:)|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|santyclz: They've gotten the tap going and the 4-1 break will make this a problem.|pg||

nt|panja: and N could have led a trump...the auction kind of suggeted a trump lead..|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S for EW on B47|pg||
nt|dslee: should be a 4@S contract for DSM |pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: it was a good lead, but they all know each other's style and less likely to lead trump from the trump queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: but same play, so will be same result.|pg||

mb|p|nt|subhranp: is it 2S by laltu or Gupta?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|2H|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Why 2@h and not 2@s? When you open in fourth one of the considerations is to prevent the opponents from getting together; when you have spades you can outbid them at the same level. When they have spades ..|pg||

nt|subhranp: had 10 tricks, went for 11th and lost one wicket|pg||
nt|babs59: he could have waited and exerted more pressure on Venky to unguard the @HK|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt will be better in fact...S has no entry to cash @H...|pg||
nt|dslee: lucky 3NT too as cards are|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Rafa: East is Rosita Berdichevsky|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry for the belated commentary but i had to make a visit to the kitchen|pg||
nt|babs59: Roland is asleep Subs, no need for cricket analogies :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: Laltu has upgarded his hand though he has only 14 hcp, I might have stuck to 1@c opening|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt preempted NS out of a @H contract|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW should reach to 3n here|pg||
nt|panja: and 3Nt will go down on a @S lead..say @ST from South|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: though to me 'wicket' sounds more like the contract, 'run' sounds more like the overtrick|pg||
nt|panja: note the 3-card 1@S takeout...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|subhranp: dbl now from N|pg||
mb|d|nt|subhranp: hi panja|pg||
nt|panja: W cannot pass for penalty..he is too weak for 1Nt...so 1@S is the best option...although he has only 3 Spades|pg||
nt|panja: hi Subhran|pg||
mb|3H|nt|subhranp: well not sure what dbl is from North hand here|pg||
nt|subhranp: balancing position can dbl in most conventions|pg||
nt|panja: risky for N to come in..@H Q lead requesting unblock of @HJ if N had it..|pg||
nt|panja: was 2Nt by North?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|alamiro: Ganan 5@h E-W |pg||
nt|sga1: Easy 11 tricks for NS|pg||
nt|offthebend: the upgrade here is not working well for laltu |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: this will not be a success with all cards not lying well and could be many down|pg||
nt|ayan: yes, next time like IPL, we will hire Barbara for our selection trial|pg||
nt|subhranp: hit the right suit, H8 could have been much better|pg||
nt|santyclz: Didn't anticipate this contract...|pg||
nt|dslee: this is an interesting auction, Formi trying to pull back whatever they can |pg||
pc|dA|nt|panja: looks like advance over overcall is forcing for NS..so 2@H was F1R..|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|panja: holding @HJ..if N ducked it....he has to be very sure it won't hurt later|pg||
nt|subhranp: declarer could make this if he manages to ruff heart in dummy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|subhranp: yes risky but then i believe no pain no gain|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|babs59: I'm an Aussie - just like Indians, love cricket|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: Laltu will do well to make tricks than N-S here, my prediction 7 to N-S|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|subhranp: venky should have played on trumps|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|panja: perhaps, a little less risky for South to come in even with his meagre 8 HCP hand....but there is risk in any intervention|pg||
nt|panja: so S. Gupta seems to have solved EW's problem..|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|panja: I wonder why S did not lead a Diamond|pg||
nt|panja: oh..sorry..North was on lead|pg||
nt|panja: else...E would have been in 3Nt and S would have been leading @ST for 1 down|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||

pc|cA|nt|rv: yes|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||

nt|offthebend: to push the board -- other table has to beat 1NT by 1 trick which is quite possible as the cards were|pg||
nt|panja: if S opens 4@H on B91, will W feel like competing?|pg||
nt|subhranp: meanwhile texans picking some IMPs on the prev board..too little too late though|pg||

nt|subhranp: ayan, look at it another way IPL is uniting the world..)|pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand B21|pg||
nt|panja: on @D lead..3Nt will not make..but there is no 8-card Major suit fit...15 opp 11 HCP...|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H seems the best spot...or perhaps 4@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: If he plays for the @ha onside rather than the @dq.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rv: are we playing the right board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: deal 71 is redealt and so is being played right now|pg||

mb|1S|nt|rv: yes SS was too much in a hurry, could have waited with @DA control|pg||
nt|rv: pls undo, North should have opened 2n?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: 77 will come later|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: pl stand bye|pg||
nt|rv: deal where Kushari's misdefense against 2n will now be replayed?|pg||
nt|rv: that will mean 6 IMPs less for Texans and DSM still in lead?|pg||
nt|offthebend: I have just been informed that bd 71 has been cancelled but they will play one extra board |pg||
nt|rv: Pramod, can we adjust the scores here even if we can't watch action on replayed brd?|pg||
nt|rv: possibly deal 71 was foul board because of duplication related issues|pg||
nt|rv: this is not real bidding on this deal, Pramod is getting us back on track|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: sure i shall put the score manually after the board 71 is over|pg||
nt|offthebend: effectively the score stands at 104 -109 in favour of DSM as Mr.Sunit choksi has been fined 2 imps penalty for mobile ringing and bd 71 has to be replayed |pg||
nt|rv: thanks|pg||
nt|rv: great, we are back on|pg||
nt|ayan: yes Subs, nice to see Harbhajan and Symonds hugging each other|pg||
nt|babs59: Subhash always complains he never holds any cards... so far all contracts here to NS|pg||
nt|ayan: dbl is 4 @s, 1 @s is 5 + |pg||
nt|babs59: though admittedly EW could make 5D on board 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: i hope not..|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: 3@S is transfer to @C|pg||
nt|subhranp: NS should bid this slam now|pg||
nt|kareno: Subhash and I owned a rubber bridge club in Toronto many years ago :)|pg||
nt|subhranp: 2c probably transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: one has to be careful about this dbl..seems the normal thing to do..but S will not opt to defend a @S contract after that double|pg||
nt|babs59: yes 2@C = @D suit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|offthebend: 3S here is puppet to 3NT to startwith |pg||
nt|subhranp: 3h cue |pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: 4@H |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: when playing against opps who use support doubles, there is a reason to bid 2S on the E hand rather than 1S.  a support double typically can be used over 1S but not over 2S|pg||
nt|panja: as I suspected...|pg||
nt|subhranp: laltu thinking of 6?|pg||
nt|panja: this will come down to @D guess in the end|pg||
nt|subhranp: not required|pg||
nt|panja: right....5 is cold|pg||
nt|subhranp: unless club is led|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|panja: 2Nt showing some 5-card Major|pg||
nt|dslee: ideal lead from laltu ? According to me, it shd be @H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: Guruji, PS-SS methods are all transfers including 3@s to @c, 4@c to @d etc|pg||
nt|offthebend: oh no - looks like it is TRF to Clubs|pg||
nt|subhranp: with those controls, N could have bid 3s|pg||
nt|subhranp: i'm not sure if we are watching the right cards here|pg||
nt|panja: that seems to be their method|pg||
pc|c4|nt|subhranp: club continuation could put some pressure on declarer|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|offthebend: sry about that folks |pg||
nt|panja: is that spelling right for Kaizad? I thought it was Keyzad|pg||
nt|ayan: This is the last deal|pg||
nt|panja: @CQ makes sense too..he is unlikely to get in again..|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|panja: Venky will lead a @D|pg||
nt|panja: going by his tendency..from last session|pg||
nt|subhranp: toss up between minors|pg||
nt|panja: similar bidding last session|pg||
nt|panja: if S holds @CKxx...and W, ATxx, there might be three tricks to begin with...|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rv: 4@c shows some @c fit possibly, 4@d/4@h cues, 4n is RKC in @Cs, 5@D is 0 or 3 keys|pg||
nt|subhranp: you are bang on panja, venky finds the killer lead|pg||
nt|panja: there is very good rationale behind the choice..|pg||
nt|panja: and Venky is one of the  smartest when it comes to understanding opponent's or any bidding method|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes as partha pointed out, no dbl of 2c or 3c by subhash|pg||
nt|panja: W bid Spades...for 2@C sequence, E is likely to have Hearts...|pg||
nt|dslee: even though 4 rounds of the game left tomorrow, DSM are likely to break the 50 IMP lead today itself, they have been fantastic the whole of last three days.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|rv: sry 5@d is 1 or 4 keys, they play 0314|pg||
nt|panja: and S would have doubled 2@C if he had good Clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|panja: that leaves @D suit as the best bet..|pg||
pc|d4|nt|alamiro: Probablemente sea -2 al menos que encuentre el K seco|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|subhranp: this lead its easy. only club lead and continuation would have put kushari on a guess|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|panja: true..but after the second Club..he would have had to come back to hand with a @S ruff..and then @D guess was much more likely to succeed|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|s2|nt|panja: thx to their mentor..Nandu Kushari..|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with only 3 small trumps and some doubtful values, W was not really orth more than a game invitation. 3H would have  expressed her values more accurately|pg||
pc|hT|nt|babs59: 4@H not likely to make with the trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|dslee: 48 looks like a pickup form formidables|pg||

nt|panja: W could hold @DKTx, for example|pg||
nt|subhranp: Form slowly narrowing the gap here|pg||
nt|panja: that wouls make 5@C impossible...and 4Major shaky|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chilloncan: looking at that W hand, it is not even automatic that 3S will make facing certain perfectly respectable 1S overcalls|pg||
nt|alamiro: Zona de grand slam para E-W|pg||
nt|panja: so..+450 instead of +500 because S took out 4@S dbl..and of course he did that because of the first 1@S dbl|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H for EW....tricky to bid..|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: such hurriedly bid hands can cost 2 imps which mean a lot in such tight matches |pg||
nt|panja: interesting hand...11-card @H fit for NS, and 10-card @C fit for EW....but Total Tricks are much less than 21|pg||
mb|1S|nt|alamiro: aunque con esta apertura muy dificil declararlo!|pg||
nt|subhranp: huu8[|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|panja: 4@H cold for NS I guess...yet again 1Nt opening ahead of their turn|pg||
nt|panja: EW might make 9 tricks in Clubs, NS, 8 or 9 in Hearts|pg||
mb|2S|nt|panja: it nees 3-2 @H break..and a few positions in Clubs..|pg||
nt|panja: so just about 35-40%.....borderline bet at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|subhranp: i think they should bid these vul games|pg||
mb|3C|nt|subhranp: slam this time for EW|pg||
nt|panja: EW are unlikely to venture into a game....because it is only a minor...and W has poor picture..but NS might want to try 4@H|pg||
nt|dslee: they surely wont, I am sure DSM will be playing more safe from here|pg||
nt|dslee: and probably they will follow the Bhikari sangh principle :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rv: flat brd here, easy 3n, matter of OTs|pg||
nt|rv: South bid 3n and not East|pg||
nt|panja: dbl one suiter?|pg||
nt|panja: possibly, South has already overbid..2@S is a little too strong a bid for the 5332 hand......|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: the @H suit is lost then..|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: minimum and possibly max of 10 tricks for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 3@H will be unlucky to go down...but seems it will go down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|panja: 1@S bid makes it slightly easier..|pg||
nt|dslee: well now no|pg||
nt|panja: oh well..on this lead, it will make|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 loser hand.  Doesn't seem worth a q.|pg||
nt|dslee: I was thinking about this lead from laltu to be honest|pg||
pc|d6|nt|subhranp: EW might end in 6s but spades are 3-3 so its safe|pg||
nt|panja:  E ccould upgrade his hand because of 1@S|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|panja: unlikely to make this one|pg||
nt|panja: Keyzad should have doubled, I thought...|pg||
nt|panja: 40 down...opportunity to score some|pg||
nt|panja: he needs to pitch two losers, 1 in Spade and 1 in DIamond..although @D is not really needed...can take finesse too|pg||
pc|s4|nt|alamiro: 3nt es bal de 24-25?|pg||
nt|panja: @C next|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chilloncan: presumably E and W would have discussed what a 3N opener means prior to competing in this event. if it is a traditional balanced hand, as W clearly intended it, then pass by E is ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unthinkable, so clearly E though it was some other type of hand|pg||
nt|alamiro: Realmente no tengo claro que muestra esta apertura de 3nt, pero si 2nt es conocida como la apertura mata slam |pg||
nt|alamiro: ahora podremos decir que 3nt mata los grand slams :)|pg||

nt|ayan: Strange pass from Venky|pg||
nt|panja: EW have many tricks in Hearts.....|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: many in India play X of strong nt opening as showing 5+m+4M, to be best of my knowledge this NS pair play double as values |pg||
nt|panja: which bid killed the exploration? 1Nt or W's Pass?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sga1: cold with good @C position.|pg||
nt|rv: PS had poor 16 hcp with no good lead and poor intermediates and wisely decided to pass|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW playing a bit of subdued game, they are still warming up..better get onto the pitch very fast|pg||
nt|panja: but they seem to have ended here by accident|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|subhranp: this should make with cards favourably placed|pg||

nt|chilloncan: spec suggests deal generator is programmed for goulasch|pg||
nt|panja: tricky for South..|pg||

mb|3C|nt|rv: deal 71 might need to manually corrected|pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt to show Club suit? |pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: many pairs play two way weak 2s -- 2M is close to an opening bid, and 2D is a truly weak 2 in one majopr|pg||
nt|alamiro: Cuando se abre de preventiva los valores deberian estar concentrados en el palo de apertura, tiene algunos extras laterales|pg||
nt|alamiro: supongo que 3@s es buen palo y buena mano|pg||
nt|alamiro: Norte debe rematar 6nt para proteger su K@d|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for me S has a 1H opener, but even without the 2-tiered weak 2s, there is an ultraconservative school of weak 2s that the S hand fits perfectlt. Matt Granovetter for example uses ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this style, which derives from the dawn of weak 2s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this looks like Ogust|pg||
nt|panja: Sorry missed the play of the last deal....|pg||
mb|3H|nt|panja: and 2Nt might be too high, even 1Nt might not make on a bad day|pg||

mb|3S|nt|rv: Guruji will you bid 2@c or 2@S with North hand, I might have tried 2@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: QJ block @D make it a -10 for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: the @DA....improves the combination..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seen from N Y|pg||
nt|panja: change it to @SA in N hand..and there would have been more trouble|pg||
nt|rodal f: But @D could been 3-3|pg||
nt|panja: difficult lead problem..I guess small @H best choice|pg||

nt|subhranp: kushari will signal clubs|pg||
nt|panja: interesting 3@S bid...can S rebid 3N now?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: and @H Q could get played here..|pg||
nt|panja: because S wants to tackle @D asap|pg||

nt|panja: exchange South's @CA for @DA...and you will see why 3Nt could be a problem...|pg||
nt|dslee: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: En mi opinion si voy abrir 1 mano de 11 ptos a nivel de 1, es porque tengo un 2do canto sin ninguna dificultad, en este caso Sur pudo abrir de 1@h y luego rematar 2@h y problema ...|pg||
nt|alamiro: resuelto, mano totalmente descrita!|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe N should have only invited once 2@h was doubled|pg||
nt|panja: W might shift..|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|offthebend: hard to say --- rather play in 6-1 than 4-3 fit with such hands |pg||

nt|panja: slam will make because @S are 33, Club honours divided..|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@H from senior can be interpreted in two ways: if you have a @H stopper, bid 3NT , or I have absolute @C with a cue bid, I think the latter wsa true|pg||
nt|dslee: might be Dhadi should had bid 3NT and closed|pg||

mb|p|nt|alamiro: no 5@C por East en serio?|pg||
nt|subhranp: while DSM have played very well, the resounding win here has also been due to some below par performance from Texans in the last 3 sets|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt will be the the normal spot though|pg||
nt|panja: 2@D opening by S helped them find the spot, no doubt|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: I don't know their methods..but 3@H looked like short suit...and later a doubt was natural..as I explained...so I am not sure N really was angling for a slam...but I don't know ...|pg||

nt|panja: @H lead?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|panja: no point in leading @D, North's first bid suit..|pg||
pc|s4|nt|panja: this was a 3@S partial for EW..1Nt opening seems to have stolen that|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|panja: I don't know why N went through Stayman|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|subhranp: this lead might just sell the contract|pg||
nt|panja: @H is better than Spades..because E knows W has 4+ Hearts|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: with my regular partner, I play this X as t/o showing minors, PS-SS prefer to play it as bal 10 hcp with @S length/card|pg||

pc|s3|nt|panja: but 1Nt will go down some|pg||

pc|s9|nt|subhranp: any reason to lead diamonds here panja?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rv: only 7 tricks for Kushari here, still might pick up a swing if Sumit-Bhabesh bid upto 3@c|pg||

pc|h3|nt|panja: I can't see a very strong one|pg||
nt|subhranp: D5 a vital card here|pg||
nt|subhranp: looks like some misunderstanding on B22 between prabh-tewary|pg||

nt|panja: B22, I think Nandu revaluated his hand brilliantly...|pg||

nt|chilloncan: small compensation for the EW game|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rodal f: Agree with u Subhransu. 2@S was very makeable, but...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panja: to continue with team descriptions......Kushari is a veteran...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|babs59: but equally he's curious to see who his opposition will be in 2 days time|pg||
nt|offthebend: for NS to find C fit , SS could have doubled 2S --- as a T/O for minors and he had a good enough hand to do it |pg||
nt|panja: and a mentor of many members of his team here..|pg||
nt|subhranp: that will be last trick for defence|pg||

nt|panja: on B51...Sumit opened 3@C light as in this room, but did not drop partner's forcing 3@S bid like a hot cake|pg||

nt|rv: thanks to my excellent commentators, Guruji Subhash Gupta and Barbara and insightful comments by all specs|pg||
nt|babs59: and this board doesn't look like Texans can recover IMPs|pg||
nt|subhranp: i guess 2c is other two suits|pg||
nt|subhranp: last board of SF coming up|pg||
mb|2C|nt|panja: 4Nt next?|pg||
nt|dslee: Bhosale is a singleton lead, rev Bhosale lead is a lead through which you try and find our ptr's singleton|pg||
nt|panja: EW are likely to overreach on this one|pg||
nt|dslee: your ptr singleton I meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: you'd better not play in the Open Room then Subhash :)|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@s most likely|pg||
mb|2S|nt|babs59: you've mis-seen a few bids tonight!|pg||
nt|subhranp: well played DSM|pg||
nt|subhranp: finals starting tomorrow at 9:30 AM IST|pg||
nt|dslee: likely 3NT bid panja from laltu?|pg||
nt|panja: W should devalue his hand holding two loose Jacks..and not accept any invitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: NS will do well to take out trumps|pg||
nt|subhranp: one spade can be ruffed in dummy and should make|pg||
nt|viren169: no reason for either player to suggest nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: excellent job done by Vugraph operator Pramod Samant and good organization by Pradeep and KSBA team and Kiruba and BFI team|pg||
nt|offthebend: I would have slept enough tonite to keep my eyes wide awake  :)|pg||
nt|panja: good lead|pg||
nt|subhranp: texans couldnt make 4h on B97 so lead has widened again|pg||
nt|panja: this could go two down now..as W will play @D to K first time..., likely|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S shows minimum?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: is this right?|pg||
nt|panja: pass then|pg||
nt|dslee: hmm|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sarkar_suk: last deal of this set :)|pg||
nt|dslee: lead is not heading to 70|pg||
nt|dslee: now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panja: of course there is reason..|pg||
nt|viren169: really?|pg||
nt|panja: W could hae 5 Diamonds...and in 6@S, there could be @D ruff..|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rv: could be another swing for DSM here|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|panja: seems this will be nine tricks..not 11 or 10 as GIB would like us to believe|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|subhranp: Formidables directly seeded to Finals|pg||
nt|panja: whereas 6Nt...is not likely to have that risk..|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: but EW can make 11...by using three entries in Dummy to play @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|babs59: and I just expected a flat board|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chilloncan: this is one of these rare cases where N can use KC with a small doubleton -- S has shown  4342 shape and a c;ub stop, so she has to have the clubs controlled herself, either ace or ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: king|pg||
nt|panja: interesting..that seemed cold|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|alamiro: Que peculiar criterio al momento de abrir esta mano! en manos anteriores abrio de 2@h una mejor mano que esta!, ahora no paso y abrio de 1@D|pg||
nt|rv: momentum clearly with DSM now and they must be favorites to meet Formidables in finals|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|panja: playing @HT to K, @H9 to Q and then @H5 to 8..that was the way to make 11...crazy double dummy way|pg||
pc|h7|nt|viren169: true... but neither player can be sure of the @C suit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panja: even 93 for that matter|pg||
pc|h5|nt|babs59: the preemptive 3@C overcall with negative double endplayed North into 3NT at the other table|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, the evaluations do seem inconsistent. but this S hand is an opening bid because:|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|psyck: both Souths chose not to look for an 8 card @s fit with a balanced hand|pg||
nt|subhranp: thanks everyone..bye|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chilloncan: 1) the Losing Trick Count is about right     2) there is playability in 3 suits including both majors    3) there is no rebid problem     4) you get to openm a suit you want led|pg||
pc|hA|nt|panja: ok let us try to make up a combination where 6Nt will fail....|pg||
nt|viren169: it is too bigger risk to take... especially at teams|pg||
nt|panja: as seen by East..|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: for all the neutrals, let us hope Texans mount a fightback in 7th segment|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rv: next segment at 10 AM tom morning, 5.30 AM London time|pg||
nt|rv: bye all|pg||
nt|babs59: let's hope so anyway, for a more exciting match|pg||
nt|rv: gn|pg||

pc|sK|pc|h4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s3|nt|panja: but EW removed a round of trumps in OR..|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|subhranp: thanks all|pg||
nt|subhranp: DSM have extended their lead and now lead looks formidable enough to challenge formidables in the finals|pg||
nt|panja: thx all, bye|pg||
