nt|rv: pranam Rajuji|pg||
nt|suketbombi: pranam|pg||
nt|rv: GS time here?|pg||
nt|key1809: Its amazing , at some stage one felt , Formidables were having a huge set, but at the end DSM still has 47 implead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: baby Grand in NT should be flad or a 2 imp exchange here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Flat|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: Formadibles were surely unlucky with the @S slam on bd 70|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|rv: @hQ is a crucial card here, if South takes control and not sure, could it be tough to bid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|key1809: if hearts are not introduced, finding H q might bcome an issue, for bidding grrand|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|key1809: puppet stayman will help, if they are playing that|pg||
nt|rv: yes Formidables were unlucky on brd 70, I suppose luck evens out in long matches of 100+ brds like here, next 3 segments will answer that question to an extent|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: if they play puppet stayman should be easy  otherwise have to find the @H queen|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|rv: 2@d is 4+hcp, 2@h is @h or bal (Kokish), 2@s is puppet, 2n shows balanced hand |pg||
mb|3S|nt|suketbombi: is it puppet Buddy?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|key1809: seems like puppet, 3s might be agreeing hearts, now they shd bid grand|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: i presume  as ALERTED|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: if yes they have a easy ride from here|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|rv: incidentally Ashok-Suhas are playing their mandatory second segment here in CR|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|rv: all pairs from both teams have played their minimum quota for this match|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: Bhabesh's 5n promises all keys as well as @hQ|pg||
nt|suketbombi: was told or in 6|pg||
nt|rv: well bid by Sumit-Bhabesh here|pg||
nt|key1809: Sumit can count 12 tricks, after 5nt,and bids the practical 7h, well done|pg||
nt|key1809: and they start with slam swing|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will loose 12 imps here and things getting very tuff for fomadibles from here|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: Prabhakar-Tewari possibly don't discuss and prepare enough, accurate slam bidding is not strength|pg||

nt|rv: P.Sridhar and Sundarram are most long running partnership in Indian bridge|pg||
nt|rv: they have been playing together for nearly 25 yrs|pg||
nt|rv: Pritish Kushari used to work and play for Indian Railways and has won Ruia trophy 5 times|pg||
nt|rv: Debrata Majumdar's nickname is laltu and currently works and play bridge for Indian Railways|pg||

nt|rv: Thane/Dombivili are suburbs in Mumbai (erstwhile Bombay)|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|subhranp: welcome back everyone|pg||

mb|2S|nt|subhranp: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|subhranp: off to a quick start here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|rv: Kushari's pass of double possibly denies 3@h|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|rv: PS's double was very aggressive especially with stiff @SA|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|figo: for kibs who r new to this bidding : 2D/2H/2S were all ART bids|pg||
nt|figo: 2NT here showed 23-24 bal|pg||
pc|d8|nt|subhranp: laltu not accepting with the min|pg||
nt|figo: or 24-25|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: Laltu doesn't have enough entries to set-up and enjoy @hs, on this deal SS is favorite to set-up @cs|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|figo: enough for N to bid 6NT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|subhranp: could have made an extra trick if he had put the HJ|pg||
nt|subhranp: form have fielded tewari-prabhakar in the other room|pg||

nt|suketbombi: yes with well behaved @Cs|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|rv: Subhash hates to open 1n with these hands with long minor suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 1c-followed  by a timid 2c, will not help here|pg||
nt|rv: many of us would open 1n with West hand|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: :) subhash will bid 3@C|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|suketbombi: i am not sure yes u have 2 kings to protect but the trick potential of this hand is much higher than a NT opening|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|key1809: its close call between 1c, followed by 3c, and 1nt opening,but i agree Raju, showing clubs is important|pg||
nt|rv: yes agree with panel's view on second thought|pg||

pc|c4|nt|suketbombi: yes|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|rv: here Venky could have bid 3@s and Subhash could have bid 3n if Venky didn't have @HQX|pg||

nt|sga1: Four session to go, only 8 imps difference, any thing possible.|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari should have exited with @ck on winning @SK in last deal, SS was one 1 down|pg||
nt|rv: all 3 teams in the trials are fairly evenly matched though Formidables have the best form in recent months, I anticipate semis and finals to be very close and go down to the wire|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables have been seeded to finals because they won 2 of the 3main qualifying events for the trials, both Summer and Winter Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: Texans won 3rd qualifying event National Masters with very different quorum of team, hence had to pay 5 lacks as direct entry to participate here|pg||
nt|rv: DSM qualified as runner-up of Summer Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: runner-up of Winter Nationals, Poddar Developers did not field team here because of some internal issues, very sad indeed|pg||
nt|rv: 5 lacks translates to 0.5 million rupees, about 10,000 USD:)|pg||
nt|rv: as per current exchange rate approx 11,000 USD|pg||
nt|rv: we have power failure at the venue, lost internet connectivity which means access to game and for Subhash Gupta to be ungagged|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables represented India the maximum times in last decade or so, they have won BFAME 4 times, reached QFs of Bermuda Bowl twice as well as R16 in Rosenblum during this period|pg||
nt|rv: apologies folks, waiting for power and connectivity to be back|pg||
nt|rv: I am not at the venue, doing commentary from home|pg||
nt|rv: P.Sridhar has won silver and bronze medal as part of Texan Aces in 2 successive European Open tournies, SS was part of team when they won bronze and Sumit was part of team when ...|pg||
nt|rv: they silver|pg||
nt|rv: pls stick around, let me call up folks at venue and check|pg||
nt|rv: power just back|pg||
nt|rv: we should be on in a couple of mins|pg||
nt|rv: they do have power back-up / generator at the venue, surprising it is taking awhile|pg||
nt|rv: according to BFI MPs, Pritish Kushari must be amongst the top 3 or 4 MPs holder in the country, he has earned most of the points as part of all-conquering Indian Railways team|pg||
nt|panja: symmetric North hand in blacks....difficult for W to know the best shift unless E could guid|pg||
nt|panja: guide even|pg||
nt|subhranp: slam board early in the day|pg||
nt|figo: and 13 tricks on top :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rv: for nearly a decade from mid-90s, Indian Railways used to have monopoly of all National team events|pg||
nt|panja: light opening...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: play was lost due to some disturbance sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: neck to neck fight nice to watch sudhir :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|figo: EW here is a relatively new partnership |pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: S should open with that hand|pg||
nt|sga1: How many would open 3@d with that hand vul, literally 9 loser hand. I would not.|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes :)|pg||
nt|rv: great, we are back on and hi again to Subhash Gupta|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Six @ds looks like the spot here.|pg||
nt|key1809: 6d making , lest see ,they can reach or not|pg||
mb|3N|nt|subhranp: 3nt easier here than 4h|pg||
nt|figo: A Goel is also the sponsor of  DSM team ( dhampur sugar mills )|pg||
nt|panja: hi all again, hi Arvind|pg||
nt|figo: hi Prakash |pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand, this one, B72|pg||
nt|figo: indeed |pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: when you dont have spades, you have to get in early or they may make it too awkward for you to compete|pg||
nt|sga1: Doesn't fall into any rule 2-3-4 or not even for aggressive players with 2-3-4-5 rule.|pg||
nt|offthebend: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt will make though because of 33 Club break|pg||
mb|4D|nt|alamiro: Excelente Resultado para N-S en la otra sala|pg||
nt|panja: true...with extra strength...and near balanced hands..it is always worthwhile exploring 3N in preference to 4 of a Major|pg||
nt|panja: here though, with all the Aces, North is likely to prefer a @S game|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: thats a good lead for declarer :)|pg||
nt|sga1: 4 quick tricks for defense.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|subhranp: 2n presumably jacoby, 3h probably showing 6carder heart|pg||
nt|panja: what is 3@H by Suhas?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: nw trump shift shd be :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: tightly contested semi final so far and I am sure it is going that way till the end |pg||
nt|rv: I might have bid 2n or 3@h with Sridhar's hand|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sga1: But trump shift can only help if N switches to @d after winning @sK|pg||
nt|sga1: so that 2nd trump can also be removed.|pg||
nt|panja: there was that other issue....did S show 5@S with this bidding? his next bid gives us the answer...NO|pg||
nt|panja: so 4@S, it will be...or will it go further?|pg||
nt|subhranp: could go higher|pg||
nt|panja: BTW Subhran, what is 2@D for you?|pg||
nt|panja: 12+?|pg||
nt|subhranp: this could prove costly for DSM|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: both 3n and 4@h have excellent play for N-S|pg||
nt|panja: I was wondering whey Keyzad bid 2@D rather than 2@S|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S would have shown 9-10 or so....|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: S actually is not even minimum by Losing Trick Count standards, has playabiulity in at least 2 suits, only mild rebid problems, and can open the suit she wants led. all that adds ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: up to a clear opening bid|pg||
nt|panja: if they escape @H lead...@H can be thrown on Clubs|pg||
nt|panja: but @HJ is far more likely lead than any other card..|pg||
nt|figo: 3D must be D + Major|pg||
nt|panja: if so, Suhash should have rebid 3Nt|pg||
nt|figo: I am guessing|pg||
nt|panja: why 3@H? it must be part of some convention|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|figo: 3H puppet of sorts ; then 3S /3NT show major may be |pg||
nt|panja: Pramod, can you tell us?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|panja: if he guesses everything right, this could make|pg||
nt|panja: but that is rather unlikely|pg||
nt|panja: on the @CK lead...with correct @S view..there is a red suit squeeze on West|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes right panja..|pg||
nt|subhranp: one can trust keyzad to find those lines|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: play on deal 1 was lost due to some disterbunce sorry all|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|panja: Williaim Watson suggests that is the only option.....@CKQ must be in, W must hold 5 @D 4!M..so East must hold 4 Spades to make!|pg||
nt|panja: 5@H4@H, that is|pg||
nt|panja: Keyzad could conjure all that up..he is quite capable of thinking of a way to make this|pg||
nt|panja: and E's first @D will tell him W holds 5@D|pg||
nt|panja: and 3@H?|pg||
nt|panja: W does not need to know Major..|pg||
nt|figo: I was just guessing from the bids|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sga1: now -2|pg||
nt|panja: ok, thx|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|rv: Sundarram is possibly abs minimum for his double and 2@h especially with modern style of O/Cs till 17/18 hcp|pg||
nt|subhranp: laltu not showing any kings so that should end the auction|pg||
nt|ayan: N-S play 2nt as Natural promising 2 + trump|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: thats not good line i think sudhir :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|sga1: yes|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|rv: Sridhar took a very pessmistic view in my opinion|pg||
nt|subhranp: play should be very quick|pg||
nt|ayan: Kushari will play for the @s Q |pg||
mc|10|nt|panja: Suhas must have judged that either Clubs wont break of the second Major will be wide open|pg||
nt|panja: so 12 IMps back to Formidable|pg||
nt|figo: did u find out what was 3D/3H etc ?|pg||

mb|d|nt|key1809: well timed 3d here by Sumit|pg||
nt|rv: this is dream seat, vulnerability and minor length to pre-empt to the hilt|pg||
nt|suketbombi: subhash n venky wud do well to reach 6@H here very tuff as Bhabesh will bid 5@D for sure|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: but they can collect 1100|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: likely contract will be 5@d double all pass|pg||
nt|key1809: i presume 5dx , will be the final contract|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 800 sorry|pg||
nt|rv: Venky won't bid at the 5 level with a semibal hand|pg||
nt|key1809: some play pass here as forcing|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rv: if Subhash bids 5@h, will Venky consider a raise, I doubt that as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|rv: good point by Key, I like to play pass as forcing here as well in which case Venky should have doubled|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|key1809: we play that as forcing, and hence would x from east with that hand, and then west would pass, tough to reach slam after this auction|pg||
nt|rv: CR in same contract on possibly identical bidding|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|suketbombi: yes but the question is he has both majors and PD is known @D void on the auction shd he not pass then asking him to bid on?|pg||

nt|rv: Subhash Gupta is affectinately called Guruji (master) in Indian bridge circles:)|pg||
nt|rv: Guruji what would be your recommended auction in last deal?|pg||
nt|subhranp: well..i wouldnt bet against a DSM vs Form final now|pg||
nt|subhranp: form getting a few imps back on that one|pg||
nt|key1809: subhash thought it more important to show his 6s, rather than 4c dmd support|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: interesting board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ayan: Hi Subs, looks like we will have a full house pretty soon|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW have 5D|pg||
nt|figo: DSM in OR did very well to bid a grand |pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|sga1: it could be 2@h/3@H depending on whether NS would compete to 3@C or not.|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor sridhar already stretched his 5 points to make a noise|pg||
nt|subhranp: venky could have continue hearts there to put some more pressure|pg||
mb|5D|nt|subhranp: NS are odds on to make 4S here|pg||
nt|ayan: looks like 3 @c is rev bergen |pg||
nt|subhranp: well both Venky and Subhash quiet so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: ok back to this one, Kushari's 2n is jacoby, 4+@h, semibal hand, GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: ofcourse no question of game reach :)|pg||
nt|subhranp: venky coming in aggressively here, finding the spade fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|sga1: 2NT here was natural, opening hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: i think the format of this event this time puts formidables at a bit of disadvantage to start with. they dont have time to settle down|pg||
nt|subhranp: quiet partial this time|pg||
nt|subhranp: 2nt also makes as cards are|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|sga1: not Jacoby which many prefer.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: Jacoby responses have been tailored a lot by different partnerships, traditionally 3 level bids show stiff and 4 level second 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ayan: Very unlike Guruzi Bid, I must admit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|subhranp: kushari should find the heart lead|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rv: looks like Kushari-Laltu have their own home-grown method here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|subhranp: possibly the vulnerability made them keep quiet|pg||
nt|panja: not sure about 3@H..last hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|santyclz: I read recently that it's right to rebid a 5 card major on these auctions on the grounds that pd may have 3.  I remain unconvinced.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|offthebend: sry -- I did miss -- PS was forced to bid 2D over the T/O dbl -- in that case , he could take one more bid -- like 2S  over 2H|pg||
nt|subhranp: assuming DSM goes through, they should look to capitalize on the initial rustiness (if any) of Formidables today|pg||
nt|ayan: now Venky may try for the @c J|pg||
nt|subhranp: trump back also should be ok here|pg||
nt|subhranp: if venky backs a trump then declarer should look to setup hearts|pg||

nt|sarkar_suk: 450|pg||
nt|subhranp: since as the match progresses DSM could tire having played longer and Form would begin to get into groove|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rv: that is what I though, another bid either 2@s, 2n or even 3@h|pg||

nt|panja: another tough one for EW..no game seems possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: aggressive bidding by venky-gupta here saving couple of imps here but more importantly signalling that they are now well and truly onto their game now|pg||

mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: ofcourse yes :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Now they r heading for 6@S which is cold.|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes|pg||
nt|dslee: was watching in the open room, deal 44 is a huge pick up for DSM, Sumit has bid 6@D and in all possibilities it would make|pg||
mb|3H|nt|panja: this should get passed..|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: hi.  Board 3 in Open Room Bhabesh couldn't be stopped from coming in with 3@D, so now in 5@D|pg||
nt|dslee: Hi Joe|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt wouldn't have occurred to me.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rv: I was aware of protest given by Ashok Goel on the strictness of penalty of 2 IMPs in every session played the pair, BFI is yet to revert back|pg||
nt|subhranp: good lead sets up heart winner for defence|pg||
nt|dslee: 2NT is a special bid here from Kushari which shows a speciality hand 14-15 points with 5-5|pg||
nt|dslee: 4@C from Laltu is a relay to know the other 5 cards|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, that makes a big difference.|pg||

nt|ayan: Both Sumit and Bhabesh are agressive bidders |pg||
nt|subhranp: as I said yesterday, Formidables are getting straight into the finals. so they dont have time to settle down. So DSM should exploit this in the initial couple of sets|pg||
mb|p|nt|Rafa: el equipo ganador de este match representará a Chile el 11 de Junio en Asunción, Paraguay|pg||

pc|d2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|panja: reaching the same spot eventually|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panja: now all that North needs to do is cash tops and exit with a Major suit card|pg||
nt|panja: Prabhakaran must figure out whether W started with two Clubs or singleton...|pg||
nt|figo: note Suhas didnt cash 1 more rd of trump , lest one of them get a chance to give count in clubs|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|sarkar_suk: gr8:)|pg||
nt|sga1: only 1 rnd of trump|pg||
nt|sga1: Needs absolutely Double Dummy play which seems possible here.|pg||
nt|sga1: Surprising part is N preferred to play is 5-card suit headed by 9 in comparison to a 7-card suit headed by AQJ :)|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: :)|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|santyclz: They've gotten the tap going and the 4-1 break will make this a problem.|pg||

nt|rv: even 6@c makes here?|pg||
nt|key1809: bhabhesh might be worried about a heart stopper, hence might try 3d, |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@C if they are agressive to bid with an ace and tr queen missing|pg||
nt|rv: Bhabesh is considering varous options a) 3@d b) 3@s c) 4@c, he may not want to cross 3n level|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Sumit is likely to show Tr queen if asked|pg||
nt|rv: since 2@d was artificial, he will rather bid 3@d now showing values instead of 3@h as 4th suit|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: 4@C auto RKC? but knowing that sumit had passed previous 4@C Bhabeah is weary:)|pg||

nt|panja: and N could have led a trump...the auction kind of suggeted a trump lead..|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S for EW on B47|pg||
nt|dslee: should be a 4@S contract for DSM |pg||
mb|1C|nt|babs59: it was a good lead, but they all know each other's style and less likely to lead trump from the trump queen|pg||
nt|panja: after a strong 1@C opening, perhaps 2@h rebid was a bit too strong for the hand I thought..|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: but same play, so will be same result.|pg||
nt|santyclz: They found 6@d  on bd 44 at the other table after a wild and wooly auction.|pg||

mb|2D|nt|panja: could make 12 tricks...|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: well..W opened 2@H in OR..and the bidding kind of gravitated towards 6@D..|pg||
mb|2H|nt|subhranp: is it 2S by laltu or Gupta?|pg||
nt|panja: but a game is what is biddable...|pg||
nt|panja: 5@S is the best and the safest spot....|pg||
nt|panja: 5@C rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this lead should make declarer's life easy, he potentially had 4 losers|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|subhranp: Form fighting back with 6 more IMPs on the previous one|pg||

nt|rv: I would have led the same as well|pg||
nt|subhranp: keyzad could have passed here and allowed his partner to bid his 4 carder|pg||
nt|dslee: quick claim from Laltu now|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: and it was a steep descent...in one round, they were in 6@D|pg||
nt|panja: now..if N started with say @SKQxxx and @DKJxx....S should pass 3Nt...|pg||
nt|panja: against the present hand, S should bid 5@C, and Tewari has guessed well...or so I would think|pg||

nt|panja: touch and go 4@H on B90|pg||
nt|ayan: Looks like Kushari got some hint from the pause for @h fin|pg||
nt|panja: 5@D for EW on B48|pg||
nt|panja: or close to 5@D..|pg||
nt|panja: there is a kind of twisted logic to this finesse|pg||
nt|panja: with the deficit....if you believe opps will be in 6@C|pg||
nt|panja: it might be a good strategy to play anti% and hope for a pick up|pg||
nt|panja: but Prabha bid 6@C with that idea in mind in the first place..|pg||
nt|panja: so this was testing one's luck and going too far for it|pg||
nt|panja: the % play with a 9-card fit..is to play for dropping the Queen|pg||
nt|figo: difficult to play if deficit governs both bidding and card play at this stage of the match ; quite a few boards yet to be played |pg||
nt|panja: true...but give credit to opps..they have forced this situation..|pg||
nt|panja: this is like having to score 15 per hour for last 6 overs..in an IPL match..you got to take chances, play anti%, whatever....|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: On  20 Berdichevs suffered the frequent fate of a trump lead against a small slam|pg||
nt|subhranp: kibitzers indicating 3n could make on 89|pg||
nt|panja: cold if N plays it|pg||
nt|subhranp: had 10 tricks, went for 11th and lost one wicket|pg||
nt|babs59: he could have waited and exerted more pressure on Venky to unguard the @HK|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt will be better in fact...S has no entry to cash @H...|pg||
nt|dslee: lucky 3NT too as cards are|pg||
mb|1C|nt|panja: and will this be a routine 4@H for EW, B76, or will NS try their luck with Club preemption?|pg||
nt|figo: bat and ball are seen but cards are not ; there is no open and closed room as well :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|Rafa: East is Rosita Berdichevsky|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry for the belated commentary but i had to make a visit to the kitchen|pg||
nt|babs59: Roland is asleep Subs, no need for cricket analogies :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Laltu has upgarded his hand though he has only 14 hcp, I might have stuck to 1@c opening|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt preempted NS out of a @H contract|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW should reach to 3n here|pg||
nt|panja: and 3Nt will go down on a @S lead..say @ST from South|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|babs59: though to me 'wicket' sounds more like the contract, 'run' sounds more like the overtrick|pg||
nt|panja: note the 3-card 1@S takeout...|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: dbl now from N|pg||
mb|2S|nt|subhranp: hi panja|pg||
nt|panja: W cannot pass for penalty..he is too weak for 1Nt...so 1@S is the best option...although he has only 3 Spades|pg||
nt|panja: hi Subhran|pg||
nt|panja: great point Arvind...that is why bridge is more difficult...|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: well not sure what dbl is from North hand here|pg||
nt|subhranp: balancing position can dbl in most conventions|pg||
nt|panja: risky for N to come in..@H Q lead requesting unblock of @HJ if N had it..|pg||
nt|panja: was 2Nt by North?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|alamiro: Ganan 5@h E-W |pg||
nt|sga1: Easy 11 tricks for NS|pg||
nt|offthebend: the upgrade here is not working well for laltu |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rv: this will not be a success with all cards not lying well and could be many down|pg||
nt|ayan: yes, next time like IPL, we will hire Barbara for our selection trial|pg||
nt|subhranp: hit the right suit, H8 could have been much better|pg||
nt|santyclz: Didn't anticipate this contract...|pg||
nt|dslee: this is an interesting auction, Formi trying to pull back whatever they can |pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: looks like advance over overcall is forcing for NS..so 2@H was F1R..|pg||
nt|panja: but with bowlers mixing up speed these days, % element is playing a lot of part..|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: I think East has not taken best options here..|pg||
nt|panja: on 2@C....why not 2@H? or even 2@D  to hear partner's choice?|pg||
nt|figo: suprising dble by E with this shape |pg||
nt|panja: Suhas is under the impression E has 4 Spades..|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d2|nt|panja: holding @HJ..if N ducked it....he has to be very sure it won't hurt later|pg||
nt|subhranp: declarer could make this if he manages to ruff heart in dummy|pg||

pc|s2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|panja: I wonder why S did not lead a Diamond|pg||

nt|vugraphzck: 3 mnts break|pg||
nt|rv: Subhash took Venky's 2@c very seriously, hence he pushed for game|pg||

nt|key1809: maybe if Subhash was brave enough to bid 3nt by himself, might have escaped a heart lead, but its all we can only dream off|pg||
nt|rv: not talking about combined hands, just as a single dummy problem what would you bid with Venky's hand on 1@S?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: meanwhils Suhas n ashok bid a wrong game and 10 imps to formadibles|pg||
nt|rv: Subhash-Ashok clearly have to a discuss and sort out their new partnership|pg||

nt|offthebend: to push the board -- other table has to beat 1NT by 1 trick which is quite possible as the cards were|pg||
nt|panja: if S opens 4@H on B91, will W feel like competing?|pg||
nt|subhranp: meanwhile texans picking some IMPs on the prev board..too little too late though|pg||

nt|panja: on @D lead..3Nt will not make..but there is no 8-card Major suit fit...15 opp 11 HCP...|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: yes SS was too much in a hurry, could have waited with @DA control|pg||
nt|rv: pls undo, North should have opened 2n?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: 77 will come later|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: pl stand bye|pg||
nt|rv: deal where Kushari's misdefense against 2n will now be replayed?|pg||
nt|rv: that will mean 6 IMPs less for Texans and DSM still in lead?|pg||
nt|offthebend: I have just been informed that bd 71 has been cancelled but they will play one extra board |pg||
nt|rv: Pramod, can we adjust the scores here even if we can't watch action on replayed brd?|pg||
nt|rv: possibly deal 71 was foul board because of duplication related issues|pg||
nt|rv: this is not real bidding on this deal, Pramod is getting us back on track|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: sure i shall put the score manually after the board 71 is over|pg||
nt|offthebend: effectively the score stands at 104 -109 in favour of DSM as Mr.Sunit choksi has been fined 2 imps penalty for mobile ringing and bd 71 has to be replayed |pg||
nt|rv: thanks|pg||
nt|rv: great, we are back on|pg||
nt|ayan: yes Subs, nice to see Harbhajan and Symonds hugging each other|pg||
nt|babs59: Subhash always complains he never holds any cards... so far all contracts here to NS|pg||
nt|ayan: dbl is 4 @s, 1 @s is 5 + |pg||
nt|babs59: though admittedly EW could make 5D on board 3|pg||
mb|2D|nt|subhranp: i hope not..|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 3@S is transfer to @C|pg||
nt|subhranp: NS should bid this slam now|pg||
nt|kareno: Subhash and I owned a rubber bridge club in Toronto many years ago :)|pg||
nt|subhranp: 2c probably transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|3C|nt|panja: one has to be careful about this dbl..seems the normal thing to do..but S will not opt to defend a @S contract after that double|pg||
nt|babs59: yes 2@C = @D suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: 3S here is puppet to 3NT to startwith |pg||
nt|subhranp: 3h cue |pg||
nt|panja: Ashok has passed with a good suit...good he didn't pass again...|pg||
nt|panja: 3@C is a good spot..|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: 4@H |pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|chilloncan: when playing against opps who use support doubles, there is a reason to bid 2S on the E hand rather than 1S.  a support double typically can be used over 1S but not over 2S|pg||
nt|panja: as I suspected...|pg||
nt|subhranp: laltu thinking of 6?|pg||
nt|panja: this will come down to @D guess in the end|pg||
nt|subhranp: not required|pg||
nt|panja: right....5 is cold|pg||
nt|subhranp: unless club is led|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panja: 2Nt showing some 5-card Major|pg||
nt|dslee: ideal lead from laltu ? According to me, it shd be @H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: Guruji, PS-SS methods are all transfers including 3@s to @c, 4@c to @d etc|pg||
nt|offthebend: oh no - looks like it is TRF to Clubs|pg||
nt|subhranp: with those controls, N could have bid 3s|pg||
nt|subhranp: i'm not sure if we are watching the right cards here|pg||
nt|panja: that seems to be their method|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|subhranp: club continuation could put some pressure on declarer|pg||
pc|dT|nt|offthebend: sry about that folks |pg||
nt|panja: is that spelling right for Kaizad? I thought it was Keyzad|pg||
nt|ayan: This is the last deal|pg||
nt|panja: @CQ makes sense too..he is unlikely to get in again..|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: Good Morning, all|pg||
pc|dA|nt|subhranp: Form pulling back a few imps on the last couple of boards|pg||
nt|subhranp: hi panja|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|panja: Venky will lead a @D|pg||
nt|panja: going by his tendency..from last session|pg||
nt|subhranp: toss up between minors|pg||
nt|panja: similar bidding last session|pg||
nt|panja: if S holds @CKxx...and W, ATxx, there might be three tricks to begin with...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: 4@c shows some @c fit possibly, 4@d/4@h cues, 4n is RKC in @Cs, 5@D is 0 or 3 keys|pg||
nt|subhranp: you are bang on panja, venky finds the killer lead|pg||
nt|panja: there is very good rationale behind the choice..|pg||
nt|panja: and Venky is one of the  smartest when it comes to understanding opponent's or any bidding method|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes as partha pointed out, no dbl of 2c or 3c by subhash|pg||
nt|panja: W bid Spades...for 2@C sequence, E is likely to have Hearts...|pg||
nt|dslee: even though 4 rounds of the game left tomorrow, DSM are likely to break the 50 IMP lead today itself, they have been fantastic the whole of last three days.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|panja: it seems NS have missed a 2@H partial|pg||
nt|panja: but of course 2@D could go down...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rv: sry 5@d is 1 or 4 keys, they play 0314|pg||
nt|panja: and S would have doubled 2@C if he had good Clubs|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|panja: that leaves @D suit as the best bet..|pg||
nt|panja: E is going to try to ruff his fourth Spade..|pg||
nt|panja: N can play a Club now...and then get to S hand by underleading @H for another trump push|pg||
nt|panja: else 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|alamiro: Probablemente sea -2 al menos que encuentre el K seco|pg||
pc|c3|nt|subhranp: this lead its easy. only club lead and continuation would have put kushari on a guess|pg||
pc|c8|nt|panja: and Tewari-Prabhakar are in 4@H ...it will go down|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|panja: true..but after the second Club..he would have had to come back to hand with a @S ruff..and then @D guess was much more likely to succeed|pg||
nt|panja: South is ahead of the curve..|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|nt|subhranp: will make now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|panja: he is going to remove trumps himself|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|panja: thx to their mentor..Nandu Kushari..|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chilloncan: with only 3 small trumps and some doubtful values, W was not really orth more than a game invitation. 3H would have  expressed her values more accurately|pg||
pc|cA|nt|babs59: 4@H not likely to make with the trumps 4-1|pg||

nt|panja: W could hold @DKTx, for example|pg||
nt|subhranp: Form slowly narrowing the gap here|pg||
nt|panja: that wouls make 5@C impossible...and 4Major shaky|pg||
nt|panja: 6@C for EW?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cold as :)|pg||
nt|panja: will not be easy to bid though...|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes, requires both minors to break|pg||
nt|panja: let us see if @S shortness comes out soon enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: looking at that W hand, it is not even automatic that 3S will make facing certain perfectly respectable 1S overcalls|pg||
nt|alamiro: Zona de grand slam para E-W|pg||
nt|panja: so..+450 instead of +500 because S took out 4@S dbl..and of course he did that because of the first 1@S dbl|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H for EW....tricky to bid..|pg||
mb|1D|nt|offthebend: such hurriedly bid hands can cost 2 imps which mean a lot in such tight matches |pg||
nt|panja: interesting hand...11-card @H fit for NS, and 10-card @C fit for EW....but Total Tricks are much less than 21|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: aunque con esta apertura muy dificil declararlo!|pg||
nt|subhranp: huu8[|pg||
nt|panja: @D 32 is sufficient I guess..@C41 can be handled|pg||
nt|figo: 54 diff now ; overnight it was 56|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|panja: 4@H cold for NS I guess...yet again 1Nt opening ahead of their turn|pg||
nt|panja: EW might make 9 tricks in Clubs, NS, 8 or 9 in Hearts|pg||
mb|1N|nt|panja: it nees 3-2 @H break..and a few positions in Clubs..|pg||
nt|panja: so just about 35-40%.....borderline bet at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|subhranp: i think they should bid these vul games|pg||
nt|panja: the trouble, for E, is 1@C is non-natural..just 3 cards..|pg||
nt|panja: to begin with..|pg||
nt|subhranp: sorry, yes you are right|pg||
nt|panja: so E does not know the fit yet...|pg||
nt|panja: She is likely to focus on @D...|pg||
nt|panja: the 2/1 freaks have this issue|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: slam this time for EW|pg||
nt|panja: EW are unlikely to venture into a game....because it is only a minor...and W has poor picture..but NS might want to try 4@H|pg||
nt|dslee: they surely wont, I am sure DSM will be playing more safe from here|pg||
nt|dslee: and probably they will follow the Bhikari sangh principle :)|pg||
nt|panja: her 2@C showed @D suit, didn't it?|pg||
nt|figo: lots of imps exchanged inbetween |pg||
nt|sunit:  on board 77 ashok passed over 1sp, so they played in 3cl for a 5imp pickup for dhampur|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rv: flat brd here, easy 3n, matter of OTs|pg||
nt|rv: South bid 3n and not East|pg||
nt|panja: dbl one suiter?|pg||
nt|panja: possibly, South has already overbid..2@S is a little too strong a bid for the 5332 hand......|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes|pg||
nt|panja: and W could likely sit for this?|pg||
nt|subhranp: i dont agree with the dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: the @H suit is lost then..|pg||
nt|panja: what if W started with, say 3433? with KJx of Spades, say|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: having shown @D suit could surely bid 4@C JUST in case pard actually has them?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: minimum and possibly max of 10 tricks for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 3@H will be unlucky to go down...but seems it will go down|pg||
nt|panja: this should be routine 3Nt|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panja: 1@S bid makes it slightly easier..|pg||
nt|dslee: well now no|pg||
nt|panja: oh well..on this lead, it will make|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 loser hand.  Doesn't seem worth a q.|pg||
nt|dslee: I was thinking about this lead from laltu to be honest|pg||
pc|hT|nt|subhranp: EW might end in 6s but spades are 3-3 so its safe|pg||
nt|panja:  E ccould upgrade his hand because of 1@S|pg||
nt|panja: what if W started with @SKJx@HKQxx @DQxx@CKxx?|pg||
nt|panja: formidables seem already to have won this board...|pg||
nt|panja: other room EW stopped in 4@C|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|panja: unlikely to make this one|pg||
nt|panja: Keyzad should have doubled, I thought...|pg||
nt|panja: 40 down...opportunity to score some|pg||
nt|panja: he needs to pitch two losers, 1 in Spade and 1 in DIamond..although @D is not really needed...can take finesse too|pg||
pc|d5|nt|alamiro: 3nt es bal de 24-25?|pg||
nt|panja: @C next|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chilloncan: presumably E and W would have discussed what a 3N opener means prior to competing in this event. if it is a traditional balanced hand, as W clearly intended it, then pass by E is ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unthinkable, so clearly E though it was some other type of hand|pg||
nt|alamiro: Realmente no tengo claro que muestra esta apertura de 3nt, pero si 2nt es conocida como la apertura mata slam |pg||
nt|alamiro: ahora podremos decir que 3nt mata los grand slams :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: should get 10 tricks --- boring hand |pg||
nt|rv: Laltu's @s7 is second best from poor suit, hence Kushari shifted|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: at least they played in @C lol whata travesty to play a slam in Gerber|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow Mrs Nadar has done well here|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|panja: trump was much safer..no need for an aggresive lead|pg||

pc|h9|nt|subhranp: declarer has to be careful here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|panja: and can make 13 or red suit squeeze?|pg||

nt|panja: 6@D if NS escape @S lead..|pg||
nt|panja: if N begins with 2@C.....the minor suits will come out in the bidding...|pg||
nt|alok_daga: a 4hrts cums up ,likely push|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: and now I have to leave...thx Subhran, Pramod (great to have a top class bridge player to operate Vugraph) and all, bye|pg||
nt|ayan: Laltu is always the busy guy at table and Kushari just the complement |pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: thanks panja|pg||
nt|panja: so..if N gets to play a @D contract...50% chance of making the slam..(escaping @S lead)..|pg||
nt|subhranp: what would you open panja with Venky's hand?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|sga1: This set DSM got 13 imps in 2 boards, many boards no swing.|pg||
nt|ayan: Both Laltu and Sumit are Kushari's student |pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|rv: not safe for PS to get in on 15-17 1n opening even with 16 hcp|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|ayan: Hi|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D is fine..|pg||
nt|panja: DSM have played superb bridge, too, give credit where it is due...many brilliant moves..|pg||
mb|4S|nt|panja: 2Nt promises some 5-card Major, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: Particularmente siempre prefiero mostrar mis palos mas largos, ahora para mostrar el @D, siempre mostrara primero mas cartas en @h|pg||
nt|subhranp: hi panja|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr:    |pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: heading for 3NT here.|pg||
nt|subhranp: this should be an easy 3n|pg||
nt|panja: much better to begin low.....except when your partner is known to be an ultraconservative player|pg||
nt|panja: isn't this worth 3Nt?|pg||
nt|panja: no...|pg||
nt|panja: not|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S? no, one short|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S is making in OR..could be tricky here|pg||
nt|panja: @C lead and return...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panja: 4@H again..|pg||
pc|c6|nt|alamiro: En este caso no deberia preocuparle decir 1@D inicialmente con su mano gf, podria luego hacer un reverse y mostraria de una manera mas adecuada su mano!|pg||
nt|alamiro: Afortunadamente East tiene 4 cartas en @ds |pg||
nt|ayan: Strange pass from Venky|pg||
nt|panja: EW have many tricks in Hearts.....|pg||
nt|panja: if E held three Aces and @SKx, but not the @HQ..prospects of a slam..|pg||
nt|subhranp: hopefully they will check for aces|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: many in India play X of strong nt opening as showing 5+m+4M, to be best of my knowledge this NS pair play double as values |pg||
nt|panja: which bid killed the exploration? 1Nt or W's Pass?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sga1: cold with good @C position.|pg||
nt|rv: PS had poor 16 hcp with no good lead and poor intermediates and wisely decided to pass|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW playing a bit of subdued game, they are still warming up..better get onto the pitch very fast|pg||
nt|panja: but they seem to have ended here by accident|pg||
nt|panja: Satya wants to explore that possibility...I am sure Kiran won't be interested|pg||
nt|subhranp: 4d might interest satya|pg||
nt|alok_daga: if 2nt showed minimum of the nt range a slam try seems optimistic|pg||
nt|kemperg: will loose 2@S then|pg||
nt|panja: that releases a trick for W's @S987 combination|pg||
pc|dT|nt|figo: bridge partners and teamates need good chemistry ...... organic or inorganic|pg||
nt|panja: true...but you could also collect 6 protons and hope to keep them together and win..many seem to try that|pg||
nt|panja: and the positive charge almost always shows its force..|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|subhranp: this should make with cards favourably placed|pg||
nt|panja: with a 55 fit...to guard against !KQx in inside..declarer must finesse first time which Kushari will do by force of habit|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|chilloncan: excellent old-fashioned auction |pg||
pc|h2|nt|alamiro: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: still time for the second @C|pg||
nt|panja: Suhas will not waste time..@HA and @C?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|offthebend: find 3 heart tricks fast to hold to 8 tricks |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|panja: the 1Nt response in Standard...is a weak link of the method|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: KISS |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ayan: Looks like Subs is in IPL mood|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chilloncan: normally, though, one would respond in the suit that is both longest and strongest|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|panja: with @CKQJxxx, S has to respond 1Nt..rather unnatural move..|pg||
nt|panja: Keep It Simple...|pg||
nt|panja: Subhash Gupta ducked @HA in the other room|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|offthebend: now 9 tricks |pg||
nt|panja: he will now wonder whether @S guess could be saved..|pg||
pc|s2|nt|panja: @HA, @C finesse, @CA, ruff, @D ruff and then @H|pg||
nt|ayan: Looks like Venky sacrified his ruff tricks |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|subhranp: ??|pg||
pc|s3|nt|alamiro: agree|pg||
nt|panja: The two teams on view here are two of the top teams in India at present|pg||
nt|panja: Formidables..have reached QF in World championships at least thrice in last 10 years..|pg||
nt|subhranp: blunder by S?|pg||
nt|panja: Texan Aces finished second in European championships a couple of year ago|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|alok_daga: 1 to Formidables|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|figo: this is huge for DSM |pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: good...going for ruff and discard .......this could lead to 2 down...let us see|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: on a @H now..W will get out with a @C|pg||
nt|subhranp: but will be endplayed again|pg||
pc|d5|nt|panja: interesting, without a working @C finesse the contract cannot be scored..|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rv: plenty of soft IMPs (OTs/UTs) conceded by N-S in this set, might come back to haunt them as suggested by Guruji|pg||
nt|figo: South's failure to win D in dummy to play S was an indication that his trumps were weak|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunit:  another case for us to tell subash trumps leads are not always the best, he got a second chance also by hopping up with heart ace and switching to a club|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rv: maybe fatigue has set in for Subhash as well after playing 4 days of much tougher bridge at Yeh Bros , China and travelling straight back to Bangalore to play this event|pg||

nt|panja: thx Pramod|pg||
nt|rodal f: 17HP and all on.|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW|pg||
nt|panja: so -90 rather than +140 if EW had bid 2@H or 3@H|pg||
nt|ayan: 4 @H went down in OR, Sumit got tempted by the lead of @d 2|pg||
nt|panja: they might not reach there..because if N begins low......he might not want to bid 4..or might get passed out early|pg||
nt|alok_daga: srry push|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: slams occurring with a remarkable frequency. one is temopted to question whether the deal generator is really set to "random"|pg||
nt|panja: will this go all pass?|pg||
nt|subhranp: would you open with S hand?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|panja: I doubt..|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: 6NT by N|pg||
nt|alamiro: Me parece que tiene mucho para una apertura de 2@h|pg||
nt|chilloncan: spec suggests deal generator is programmed for goulasch|pg||
nt|panja: tricky for South..|pg||
nt|panja: he is likely to think he can defend 4@H..and that 5@D might not be a pucca proposition|pg||
nt|subhranp: subhash could have played second round of diamonds before playing clubs|pg||
nt|panja: 15 opposite 9...routine 3Nt if N begins 1N|pg||
nt|panja: routine @H partial in normal situations....NS might try a game here though|pg||
nt|kemperg: that's a second hand weak two:)|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt? 4@S? Pass? which anti% way do you go?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|rv: scores may not be right here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Like to stay out there|pg||
nt|panja: now, after 1Nt...N will raise..|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rv: deal 71 might need to manually corrected|pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt to show Club suit? |pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: many pairs play two way weak 2s -- 2M is close to an opening bid, and 2D is a truly weak 2 in one majopr|pg||
nt|alamiro: Cuando se abre de preventiva los valores deberian estar concentrados en el palo de apertura, tiene algunos extras laterales|pg||
nt|alamiro: supongo que 3@s es buen palo y buena mano|pg||
nt|alamiro: Norte debe rematar 6nt para proteger su K@d|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for me S has a 1H opener, but even without the 2-tiered weak 2s, there is an ultraconservative school of weak 2s that the S hand fits perfectlt. Matt Granovetter for example uses ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this style, which derives from the dawn of weak 2s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this looks like Ogust|pg||
nt|panja: Sorry missed the play of the last deal....|pg||
mb|3D|nt|panja: and 2Nt might be too high, even 1Nt might not make on a bad day|pg||
nt|panja: excellent lead..|pg||
nt|panja: notice the motivation..|pg||
nt|panja: and now 3@H showing shortness|pg||
nt|panja: so this should end in 3Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: he wants to shift after winning this one|pg||
nt|panja: and he will now shift to Clubs..|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rv: Guruji will you bid 2@c or 2@S with North hand, I might have tried 2@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: QJ block @D make it a -10 for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: the @DA....improves the combination..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seen from N Y|pg||
nt|panja: change it to @SA in N hand..and there would have been more trouble|pg||
nt|rodal f: But @D could been 3-3|pg||
nt|panja: difficult lead problem..I guess small @H best choice|pg||
nt|subhranp: this would be interesting|pg||
nt|subhranp: kushari will signal clubs|pg||
nt|panja: interesting 3@S bid...can S rebid 3N now?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|panja: and @H Q could get played here..|pg||
nt|panja: because S wants to tackle @D asap|pg||
nt|panja: this is a tricky situation...N is thinking about 44 fit..S, about @H check...|pg||
nt|panja: exchange South's @CA for @DA...and you will see why 3Nt could be a problem...|pg||
nt|dslee: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: En mi opinion si voy abrir 1 mano de 11 ptos a nivel de 1, es porque tengo un 2do canto sin ninguna dificultad, en este caso Sur pudo abrir de 1@h y luego rematar 2@h y problema ...|pg||
nt|alamiro: resuelto, mano totalmente descrita!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: very surprising for N to pass after a 3S reply to Ogust showing super maximum|pg||
nt|alamiro: Ahora pueden ganar 7 si encuentra la Q@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe N should have only invited once 2@h was doubled|pg||
nt|panja: W might shift..|pg||
nt|subhranp: on a club lead, N should win with CK|pg||
nt|panja: @C lead? I think with long trump..best bet|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|offthebend: hard to say --- rather play in 6-1 than 4-3 fit with such hands |pg||
nt|panja: he knows @HA is with S, he has heard 1@H bid..he won't take a chance on @H9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am not shure if that was at the hurry|pg||
nt|panja: that is why none of NS want to settle in 3Nt|pg||
nt|panja: 3@C as in Ogust?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|panja: no way to make now..|pg||
nt|dslee: deal 50 tewari lead a @H|pg||
nt|panja: The Spade suit undisclosed...so that makes Declarer's job easier|pg||
nt|panja: that allows all @H to come in with @H9 pinning|pg||
nt|kemperg: something like bad suit, bad hand?|pg||
nt|panja: run @S9 now..this is hopeless as the cards lie..but who know, if E does not defend carefully...it could make|pg||
nt|figo: and still 4S ? looks like he always wanted to bid it :)|pg||
nt|panja: Pramod, what did 3@C show?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|dslee: 4@D was slam indication|pg||
nt|panja: right...that was a good lead...Laltu missed that..|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rv: Pramod, are scores displayed right?|pg||
nt|dslee: again a loss for formidables|pg||
nt|alok_daga: preferred the OR auction 2 introduce a 109xx suit seems unworthy|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kemperg: S could not stay out of game|pg||
nt|figo: kibs who are recently taught weaks 2s may wonder why 2S here |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|ayan: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|panja: he cannot ruff three cards in Dummy, so needs to get @H ruffs going soon|pg||
nt|panja: or..run the @S9|pg||
nt|panja: @SAK will not do..I guess|pg||
nt|panja: are you sure about that slam invitation?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|panja: it is a toss up between @ST, and @H9...|pg||
nt|panja: if S had later..@SQ shift would have worked better|pg||
nt|subhranp: heart shift was right even if N had H9 doubleton|pg||
nt|panja: oh..I forgot N is the Declarer..|pg||
nt|panja: right..@H continuation is right...because @ST is seen in the dummy|pg||
nt|subhranp: should be -1|pg||
nt|subhranp: defence should look to get their 4 tricks in red-suits|pg||
nt|subhranp: venkatesh not sure if Keyzad has HA or not and might be considering knocking out HA if Kushari has it|pg||
nt|panja: and what if North started with nothing in Spades? or just one control?|pg||
nt|panja: hereafter, all the initial moves and many final choices of NS will be somewhat anti%....and hopeful|pg||
nt|figo: well , there r 2 types of weak 2s : for learners min req is 6 cards , for experts 5 are enough|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chilloncan: after all, if N was not going to move towards slam over the strongest rebid that S could make, why on earth bid 2N in the first place?|pg||
nt|babs59: yes  bd 73 was a double game swing|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes good defence here by Laltu|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H was a make on the guess of @ST..|pg||

nt|panja: right, no 9th trick in normal situations...|pg||
nt|panja: 9 tricks in 3@C counting 2 in Hearts...|pg||
nt|panja: W is likely to lead @HJ|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|panja: this was a 3@S partial for EW..1Nt opening seems to have stolen that|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: I don't know why N went through Stayman|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: drury should be reanamed dreary|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|subhranp: this lead might just sell the contract|pg||
nt|panja: @H is better than Spades..because E knows W has 4+ Hearts|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rv: with my regular partner, I play this X as t/o showing minors, PS-SS prefer to play it as bal 10 hcp with @S length/card|pg||
nt|offthebend: sadly not too many people compete with minors after a NT O/call|pg||
pc|c3|nt|offthebend: I must be seeing things -- I thought there was a NT O/call somewhere and SS had both minors :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panja: but 1Nt will go down some|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i would indeed bid 5C, but E is hoping for a defeat of 4H|pg||
nt|panja: @C switch, I would think now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|subhranp: any reason to lead diamonds here panja?|pg||
nt|panja: in the OR, S rebid 3@S...to leave some space for exploration....but 4@S doesn't seem to have deterred them here..|pg||
nt|panja: @H finesse is needed anyway....so N has to think of a way to try both Major suit finesses..|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rv: only 7 tricks for Kushari here, still might pick up a swing if Sumit-Bhabesh bid upto 3@c|pg||
pc|cA|nt|subhranp: heart shift could have been better|pg||
nt|panja: look out for @H signal from E|pg||
nt|dslee: 1NT is not a comfortable auction to be in - |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ayan: To find out if S has a 5 card M|pg||
nt|panja: high @D will show @H?|pg||
nt|panja: and now, it should be @H first..|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|panja: I can't see a very strong one|pg||
nt|subhranp: D5 a vital card here|pg||
nt|subhranp: looks like some misunderstanding on B22 between prabh-tewary|pg||
nt|panja: @D switch was cheeky...too smart perhaps|pg||
nt|panja: B22, I think Nandu revaluated his hand brilliantly...|pg||
nt|dslee: pich low @H|pg||
nt|panja: small @H shows @H...|pg||
nt|panja: direct approach|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panja: Nandu is the nickname of Kushari.......|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dslee: udca carding and discards I think for whole of the field|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rv: Guruji you are tired and need some sleep after 4 days of WC bridge in Yeh Bros and travel|pg||
pc|hT|nt|offthebend: correct |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|panja: but Venky spurned @H because of the Stayman sequence|pg||
nt|subhranp: did venky think that North has 4+hearts?|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|figo: SJ was pinned by SK |pg||

nt|figo: bye , gtg too|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: Agree with u Subhransu. 2@S was very makeable, but...|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|panja: to continue with team descriptions......Kushari is a veteran...|pg||
nt|figo: thanks buddy , pramod , all specs |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s5|nt|babs59: but equally he's curious to see who his opposition will be in 2 days time|pg||
nt|offthebend: for NS to find C fit , SS could have doubled 2S --- as a T/O for minors and he had a good enough hand to do it |pg||
nt|panja: and a mentor of many members of his team here..|pg||
nt|subhranp: that will be last trick for defence|pg||
nt|viren169: Hello all...|pg||
nt|panja: Subhran..pl add if you can...|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: good slam here|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@H with only 22 pts, will they reach that:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|panja: Sumit did bid 4@S..|pg||
nt|dslee: as I said, sumit & bhabesh would bid 4@S , the smallest chance of a game they see, they have been bidding them|pg||

mb|4N|nt|subhranp: they may settle for 400|pg||
nt|panja: this will not be easy|pg||
nt|panja: 8 clear tricks for N|pg||
nt|panja: on B51...Sumit opened 3@C light as in this room, but did not drop partner's forcing 3@S bid like a hot cake|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Kushari retired from Indian Railways a couple of years ago...an organisation that employed and encouraged dozen+ bridge players..and ruled Indian bridge almost for a decade|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Rafa: El equipo Severin se tituló campeón, 2do Alti, el 3er puesto no ha terminado|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 2 Spades, 4 Hearts, two Diamonds..|pg||
nt|panja: but Indian boundaries was the limit of their support.......that is why they did not participate too often as Railway on the international stage..|pg||
nt|panja: Kushari passed whereas Tewari bid 2Nt in this sequence...a bit of a stretch, 2Nt seems to be.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|offthebend: PS may be regretting his opening NOW |pg||
nt|babs59: seems perfectly respectable to me though|pg||
nt|rv: SS might pass this and they might be just about ok|pg||
nt|subhranp: this is another potential swing board for Texans|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5 aces the problem here|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|subhranp: declarer will have to endplay venky in diamonds|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|panja: ninth can come from some kind of endplay...but it won't be easy to figure out single Dummy|pg||
nt|viren169: fortunately 6@h also makes here... but they should come to rest in 6@d|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chilloncan: diamonds likely to be 22 after non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|offthebend: Not going to be a success here for texan |pg||
nt|offthebend: when he takes the D finesse ( from the bidding ) -- the roof will cave in |pg||

mb|p|nt|chilloncan: N was worth a raise to 3S after the 4 card drury|pg||

nt|rodal f: An interesting one seen from the specs side. Defence and end|pg||
mb|p|nt|alok_daga: these 4IMPS,2IMPS can prove 2 be costly in a tight match|pg||
mb|2N|nt|panja: I doubt this will end up in a game|pg||
nt|panja: what is Bhosale lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: sorry I got the tables wrong, this table has finished earlier|pg||
nt|kemperg: lots of remarks from people of India, much more then I'm used to in Europe|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rv: Barbara is right|pg||
nt|kemperg: I like that:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: but RV, I said that privately :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: open room is playing slow bec of some lighting problems |pg||
nt|rv: thanks to my excellent commentators, Guruji Subhash Gupta and Barbara and insightful comments by all specs|pg||
nt|babs59: and this board doesn't look like Texans can recover IMPs|pg||
nt|subhranp: i guess 2c is other two suits|pg||
nt|subhranp: last board of SF coming up|pg||
mb|3D|nt|panja: 4Nt next?|pg||
nt|dslee: Bhosale is a singleton lead, rev Bhosale lead is a lead through which you try and find our ptr's singleton|pg||
nt|panja: EW are likely to overreach on this one|pg||
nt|dslee: your ptr singleton I meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: you'd better not play in the Open Room then Subhash :)|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@s most likely|pg||
mb|3H|nt|babs59: you've mis-seen a few bids tonight!|pg||
nt|subhranp: well played DSM|pg||
nt|subhranp: finals starting tomorrow at 9:30 AM IST|pg||
nt|dslee: likely 3NT bid panja from laltu?|pg||
nt|panja: W should devalue his hand holding two loose Jacks..and not accept any invitation|pg||
nt|panja: and on B70 with 24 HCP combined holding , but rather an indifferent one, NS ventured into 6@S in OR..|pg||
nt|alok_daga: another 13 to DSM|pg||
nt|panja: well...I must correct that....6@S has a good % on paper..|pg||
nt|alok_daga: SRRY 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: NS will do well to take out trumps|pg||
nt|subhranp: one spade can be ruffed in dummy and should make|pg||
nt|viren169: no reason for either player to suggest nt|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: excellent job done by Vugraph operator Pramod Samant and good organization by Pradeep and KSBA team and Kiruba and BFI team|pg||
nt|offthebend: I would have slept enough tonite to keep my eyes wide awake  :)|pg||
nt|panja: good lead|pg||
nt|subhranp: texans couldnt make 4h on B97 so lead has widened again|pg||
nt|panja: this could go two down now..as W will play @D to K first time..., likely|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S shows minimum?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: is this right?|pg||
nt|panja: pass then|pg||
nt|dslee: hmm|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@H is that majors? don't have a CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: last deal of this set :)|pg||
nt|dslee: lead is not heading to 70|pg||
nt|dslee: now|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: of course there is reason..|pg||
nt|viren169: really?|pg||
nt|panja: W could hae 5 Diamonds...and in 6@S, there could be @D ruff..|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: could be another swing for DSM here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: seems this will be nine tricks..not 11 or 10 as GIB would like us to believe|pg||
pc|d5|nt|subhranp: Formidables directly seeded to Finals|pg||
nt|panja: whereas 6Nt...is not likely to have that risk..|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|panja: but EW can make 11...by using three entries in Dummy to play @S|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec tells 4414 or 4405 11-15|pg||
nt|kemperg: and 3@C 4414  11-13|pg||
nt|kemperg: also our operetor Pramod finds the time to give information|pg||
pc|c2|nt|babs59: and I just expected a flat board|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|chilloncan: this is one of these rare cases where N can use KC with a small doubleton -- S has shown  4342 shape and a c;ub stop, so she has to have the clubs controlled herself, either ace or ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: king|pg||
nt|panja: interesting..that seemed cold|pg||
nt|panja: thx all, bye|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|alamiro: Que peculiar criterio al momento de abrir esta mano! en manos anteriores abrio de 2@h una mejor mano que esta!, ahora no paso y abrio de 1@D|pg||
nt|rv: momentum clearly with DSM now and they must be favorites to meet Formidables in finals|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panja: playing @HT to K, @H9 to Q and then @H5 to 8..that was the way to make 11...crazy double dummy way|pg||
pc|h3|nt|viren169: true... but neither player can be sure of the @C suit|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|panja: even 93 for that matter|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|babs59: the preemptive 3@C overcall with negative double endplayed North into 3NT at the other table|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chilloncan: yes, the evaluations do seem inconsistent. but this S hand is an opening bid because:|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|psyck: both Souths chose not to look for an 8 card @s fit with a balanced hand|pg||
nt|subhranp: thanks everyone..bye|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chilloncan: 1) the Losing Trick Count is about right     2) there is playability in 3 suits including both majors    3) there is no rebid problem     4) you get to openm a suit you want led|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|panja: ok let us try to make up a combination where 6Nt will fail....|pg||
nt|viren169: it is too bigger risk to take... especially at teams|pg||
nt|panja: as seen by East..|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rv: for all the neutrals, let us hope Texans mount a fightback in 7th segment|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rv: next segment at 10 AM tom morning, 5.30 AM London time|pg||
nt|rv: bye all|pg||
nt|babs59: let's hope so anyway, for a more exciting match|pg||
nt|rv: gn|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|santyclz: This is the last bd of the session, thanks all.  Bye for now.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dslee: next session tomorrow morning at 9:30 AM|pg||
pc|s6|nt|panja: thx all, bye|pg||
nt|ayan: bye|pg||
nt|subhranp: tks all..see you all next session|pg||
nt|panja: when does next session start?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kemperg: contract a bit optimistic:)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|panja: but EW removed a round of trumps in OR..|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s7|nt|subhranp: thanks all|pg||
nt|subhranp: DSM have extended their lead and now lead looks formidable enough to challenge formidables in the finals|pg||
nt|panja: thx all, bye|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d6|pg||
mc|8|nt|kemperg: spec think optimistic is too nice:(|pg||
