nt|varange: hi Henry|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kemperg: Hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 420 is a very good result|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|3S|nt|henryb:  indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am proud of my ex partner, Sævar, in the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  140 rates to be pretty good also|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: He used to live in Denmark|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: We're all moving away from here :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|varange: so we hope for Aron to win, yes?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|varange: I thought you were in London  Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, that is my point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Moveing away from DK|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|varange: any place that has weddings will do :)'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some are still celebrating and the night was awful|pg||
nt|henryb:  It keeps a lid on the domestic population, which is a good idea in a small country|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: London is the 7th largest Danish city with 65,000 inhabitants|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s9|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|varange: I'm still coming to terms with the 2@s overcall. Is that common?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think they all work|pg||
nt|henryb:  Meanwhile declarer is making heavy work of this hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S intermediate perhaps|pg||
nt|kemperg: or no interest, partner had no opening|pg||
nt|kemperg: to strong for the second remark|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  Do your partners open @sQ , @cAK and out?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|varange: gustmannus tells me that they open 2@s 10-13, mabe the overcall is just the same|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kemperg: No they don't|pg||
nt|varange: hope not|pg||
mc|8|nt|henryb:  which would have ten tricks with the @hA onside|pg||
pg||

nt|sybarra: hi Joe :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: NS - standard - EW = precision|pg||
nt|hawe45: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks operators, appreciated information|pg||
nt|hawe45: Excuse me - can one play precision and be late for the start...?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No you haven't|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now you have|pg||
nt|hawe45: This board was played two hours ago|pg||
nt|hawe45: 100 % sure - director|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good hands to start with tho.. what happend on the board?|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur both world champions from Yokohama 1991|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var and Karl have both often represented in open teams for Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think we start with board 1 in this room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15 and 126 in the open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15-16|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sry folks, need to restart|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur play relay system|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Good bidding - up to now|pg||
nt|peachy: operator seems to have some practicing session going, no cards :)  Hang on, I'm sure we will be on shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hmmm....|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The bidding has not been like this :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You need to redeal to a board first|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You can't bid with a blank screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I have the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Ian |pg||
mb|1D|nt|hawe45: Good luck to everybody|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mgb81: That's an odd choice of take out double from south I must say- makes it hard to express her hand type|pg||
nt|athene: yet another good hand for the "4333 plays in notrumps" rule|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dburn: well, if it gets them to 3NT...|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks as though it definitely ought to have chances|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS have the chance for a brilliancy by bidding 3NT...seems a bit far fetched though|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed how well 3nt scores over 4major when you have a 4333|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: a not so easy 3 nt|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mgb81: North can try eliminating and messing around a bit but with everyone balanced there isn't any chance of a defensive screw up|pg||
nt|athene: you really want to be facing a 1-suiter though - not so good if the long spades are part of a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|mgb81: or is there...?|pg||
nt|copeyj: @DA lead should eliminate the problems at trick 1, 2 and 3 Michaerl|pg||
nt|copeyj: or even Michael|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence can begin with three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: and if they get endplayed after that, they deserve to get endplayed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a bit desperate if @h led|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you could endplay them after that and force them to give a ruff and discard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ht it is (was certainly likely) |pg||
nt|santyclz: I would have led a @c, probably the only lead that lets it make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think the only way it might make is if west somehow loses her clubs and then east gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks for coming to cheer for your favorites|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|mgb81: In the other room it looks like Susannah Gross pulled off a pseudo squeeze as Ruth Connelly sitting west pitched two clubs, squeezing her partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: @H - @D-ruff - and then @S from the defence|pg||
pc|hK|nt|iceak:  could have a chance because of favourable @d lay|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I guess that Jón Baldursson's @S2 in first trick meant that he wanted a @C switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They play udca, so low card is usually encouraging, which in the case of a singleton in dummy usually calls for a trump|pg||
nt|iceak:  difficult not to find a trump switch|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|athene: but since west hasn't got anything to keep but her clubs....|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ianmcc: don't like that @h8 but still 5 tx for defence|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|hawe45: @D Jack was a partner-test..|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mgb81: However declarer then claimed one down, so maybe the play record is inaccurate.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|hawe45: @S now, what else could work well?|pg||
nt|iceak:  declarer maybe on his way|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But it is very common to play Lavintahl when dummy shows with a singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late |pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi all|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: High @S would have called for @D, small for @C, middle for more @S or trump|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Shirley Ybarra|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Dima Nikolenkov|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hi there :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI Dima Isak & Shirley:)|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The defence stands no chance now, should I tell Þorlákur :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Do pairs use some special systems?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|hawe45: Claim|pg||
nt|hawe45: Trump back would have defeated this contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iceak:  EW use relays|pg||
mc|10|nt|dima:  Ina strong clubs context?|pg||
pg||

mb|2C|mb|d|nt|varange: bjarni will like his clubs after that dbl|pg||
nt|henryb:  An easy hand to bid and maybe he should redouble 2@c|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kemperg: rdl |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: N-S close to making 6@H but only close|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|henryb:  Do you all have agreements after the double? I had a partner who suggested that pass or redouble should promise a stopper and bidding immediately deny one|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kemperg: same, but rdl 4 good @C's|pg||
nt|varange: no specific agreement here, alas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I play pass as a stopper, bid no stopper|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|varange: and rdbl?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: To play|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|henryb:  suggestion to play|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kemperg: we all do the same:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|varange: suppose we do, even without specific agreements|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|henryb:  what about after a transfer gets doubled? same idea or does accepting the transfer show 3(+) in the suit|pg||

nt|mgb81: we can see that the defence lost its way in the other room|pg||
nt|mgb81: 4S looks booked for at least two down but west played ace and another diamond and declarer got a club away|pg||
nt|santyclz: And a quick lead for the team I'll not try to type.|pg||
nt|peachy: Then he does not lose the DK to ruff, tricky hand to defend|pg||
nt|hawe45: One @H to the 10, @D-ruff and trump|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think especially at pairs you want your systems in working order |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes E-W play strong @C, N-S standard 2/1|pg||
nt|iceak:  Think strong club |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east played the @D5 on the ace|pg||
nt|mgb81: with 5H cold (North is squeezedin the minors on an unlikely trump lead) there are several ways for this to gain a swing to England|pg||
nt|mgb81: will kelly bid 4S or 1S?|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT overcall definitely a bit whimsical|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we can just call them SS |pg||
nt|dima:  ok|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ianmcc: or pronounce|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: asking partner to have an ace out of the blue is a bit much|pg||
nt|santyclz: (It being only 7:15 here my fingers aren't awake yet.)|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzdh: 20-21|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of us up much earlier watching the royal wedding :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/s could maybe make 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I figured since they didn't invite me I wasn't obligated to watch.|pg||
nt|peachy: Often the defense indeed does well to start trumps early, the reason they play in trump contract is so they can ruff something :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Exactly|pg||
nt|dima:  looks like negative double will get NS to 4@h|pg||
nt|iceak:  How strong is NS NT?|pg||
nt|dima:  likely 12-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S use weak NT in 1st and 2nd|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mgb81: this is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: what????????|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: making 5 moving right along |pg||
nt|iceak:  no problems to win this|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 6@H actually can be made on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And Sævar has a bit of a problem, because he does not quite know partners hand type|pg||
nt|iceak:  My guess he will pass|pg||
nt|dima:  surely they would have some slam try bid (like 4@d) on the way available|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Does he have 15-17 balanced? Even 18-19? Or maybe 14-17 unbalanced?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: literally what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|athene: west has decided that she can get lots of heart ruffs|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South really bid 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: why would you ever reopen with a double on the east cards?|pg||
nt|athene: best would be an SOS redouble from north|pg||
nt|ianmcc: howcome they left you out?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think being vul, N/S do not get in|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: I am not sure you can ever make 6 with a @D lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont see that,, unless you are talking about judging the spade position immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Double dummy you can, by finessing @S at first opportunity|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Does not help|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: West has 3 trumps and 2 spades|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then use entries to play @Cs twice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How do you get your diamond loser away in time?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: south might decide to float that too|pg||
nt|mgb81: well this looks to be 7 tricks on accurate defence i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: is this definitely the auction, operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I fear it is|pg||
nt|mgb81: I just cant imagine what goes through the mind of someone that wants to double 1S for take out when they are 7-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: it definitely is :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: :):)|pg||
nt|athene: well, received wisdom is that you strain to re-open with double as often as possible, but "possible" doesn't cover 0-7-2-4|pg||
nt|mgb81: I'm not sure why youre smiling Stephen - looks painful to me|pg||
nt|santyclz: An oversight, I'm sure.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|sybarra: seems like it should make 6 but I guess that needs the @H's played correctly|pg||
nt|hawe45: No double? - but undertricks "en masse" as they say in France|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|copeyj: he is smiling because he is scottish|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: absolutely|pg||
nt|hawe45: E/W will come closer to 9 tricks than North...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|dima:  In Imps seems to be pretty easy board|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|hawe45: Come on, North - take some tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps there was some misunderstanding in NS auction|pg||
pc|cK|nt|steshome:  Passing the double with the West hand is a bit odd though|pg||
nt|athene: that's one way of putting it, yes|pg||
nt|mgb81: yes it's the bid of someone who is going for the quick kiil|pg||
nt|mgb81: hoping partner is 2524 with a goodish hand say|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mgb81: Declarer is going to bash out a few trumps now and make her 7 top tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|peachy: 2NT seems like transfer to clubs, meybe they were not on same page asto what bid "likes clubs"|pg||
nt|hawe45: Do´nt forget, that the lead gave one trick away from the defence!|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|dima:  If West overtakes to return a trump East is sqeezed in black suits|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|mgb81: west should have count now and not uck the diamond|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mgb81: often its the vul overtrick that really costs. -790 when teammates make 620 isnt a disaster but -990 is|pg||

nt|varange: oops|pg||
nt|varange: sry|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I find it more useful to play pass = doubleton in the transfer suit and accept the transfer = 3(+) card support|pg||
mb|1H|an|alert|mb|2D|nt|varange: hmmm, we may change our system for that then|pg||
nt|varange: transfer after 1@c it seems|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass dobleton is what we did, but nowadays we transfer to 4 card|pg||
nt|henryb:  reason is to give better basis for competitive decisions later|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb:  So Bjarni decided to play 4@s opposite four little spades and out?|pg||
nt|varange: hmm|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  or did 1@h promise more than that?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|varange: 1@h would probably limit the hand to 9hcp anyway Henry?|pg||
nt|kemperg: with 4@S's he would have some points, or is 1@C forcing?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|henryb:  but does it have a lower limit? is 1@c forcing?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|varange: could be - but 4@s off the bat does seem odd|pg||

nt|mgb81: are you sure it's 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|athene: if you go all the way round the bend, that's 360 degrees isn't it :)|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - East didn't overtake @cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: yes...I'm sure :)|pg||
nt|dburn: so a heart loser went away|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Still sure...|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think we should just rely on Stephen to have it right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: was also the auction...lol|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Don't tell anybody|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Karl claimed the overtrick on squeeze |pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: when you have a 7-4 as opener on that sort of auction do you just lose the 4-card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: too late|pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: lots for N/S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so opener just bids 4@H or something over 1@S?|pg||
mb|2S|an|weak|nt|Walddk1: yes Bill|pg||
nt|athene: these actions aren't discussed much - e.g. what is a cue-bid by opener|pg||
nt|mgb81: it looks like declarer mistimed the play in the other room here. She allowed north to pitch her diamond and ruff away the ace|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here the spot is 3 NT - to avoid cross-ruffing defence|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dima:  He had a complete count here West turned up with 6-3 in reds and rhe position of club ace was known|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: Is the grand biddable?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: West took my advice|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: What do you call AQJ9xxxx?  Trumps!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: even ith one card less|pg||
nt|athene: yes 4@H doesn't look too tricky|pg||
nt|copeyj: can just get a @C trick in the bank and cross ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
nt|athene: make four tricks in the side suits and some number of trumps on a crossruff|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will be a good text of alice and bryonys temperament if they can get back on te horse and get a solid game under lock and key|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: North seems intent|pg||
nt|santyclz: If that is exclusion s should bid it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: voidwood |pg||
nt|sybarra: or exclusion |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was an ask. Could 5@c be an answer?|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerted at voidwood |pg||
nt|santyclz: N chose not to answer the "ask", that shows a suit whose loser(s) can be determined by b'wood.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :) will they get to this 4@S difficult tho but a 10 card fit is such an Asset|pg||
nt|iceak:  Favorable lay|pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: Quite reasonably|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D position (in south) values fully |pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: I think S has to bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|hawe45: Without pre-empt, 4 @H is the normal contract to bid - not to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4th lead, udca|pg||

nt|copeyj: E/W got way overboard and Sally Brock told them it wasn't making|pg||
nt|athene: ok a classic misunderstanding here i think|pg||
nt|athene: if you double then bid a new suit that should not be natural and strong|pg||
nt|suketbombi: another 10 card fit|pg||
mb|1D!|an|Prec.|nt|athene: because with a strong shapely hand you start by bidding your suits not by neg Xing|pg||
nt|mgb81: ouch|pg||
nt|athene: so nash's 4@C really caused a lot of problems|pg||
nt|athene: probably interpreted as a cue bid supporting diamonds|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mgb81: Alice Kaye will do well to take the low road and bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: well everyone will remember a 7@D not too long ago where the defender with the @DA had to double to gain on the board|pg||
nt|athene: and it wasn't at a humble level either|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Or the 7@D this EW pair bid against Scotland earlier today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Made on a finesse|pg||
nt|copeyj: Well it was a quasi marked finesse Roland|pg||

nt|dburn: very good auction, that was|pg||
nt|mgb81: one of the juniors watching has just quoted the old rhyming adage "Misfit -time to quit"|pg||
nt|copeyj: Let's not talk about slams anyway after the one in the first stanza of the day today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Simon forgets to tell that the hand with @HQxxx bid the grand slam although her partner never cuebid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: But she found a void opposite|pg||
nt|dburn: her partner had guaranteed first-round control in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: When did she do that?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She never bid hearts|pg||
nt|mgb81: is Alice really still in the tank?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D looks pushy here and east hasn't got any easy way to just invite it based on the diamond suit quality, has she?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She jumped from 3NT to 6@C|pg||
nt|dburn: when she bid six clubs as a grand slam try opposite a partner who had cue-bid 4@s when she could have cue-bid 4@h|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bill tries unsuccessfully to get us back on track|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Well, not much action right now, Sarah :)|pg||

mb|2S|nt|hawe45: Par is 5 @S doubled 9 tricks|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: sorry 1370 even|pg||

pc|dA|nt|hawe45: Surprising, that South with 10  HCP and an opening bid from partner, just sells out to 4 @S undoubled|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mgb81: yes East was a reserve last year just misisng out on her first lady milne but this year she and Bryony qualified comfortably in the trials|pg||
nt|mgb81: good work|pg||
nt|athene: now east still might not want to bid 4@D because that might sound as though she looked for 3nt, didn't find a stop, and gave up|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|Walddk1: 4@S was perhaps a bit much with that moth-eaten suit, but it did put pressure on West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I know the relays here|pg||
nt|dima:  So East is going to relay 4 times to finish in 3NT or 4@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Every bid by East is asking relay, West is describing his shape|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|sybarra: for lack of a better lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Not to be underestimated|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hawe45: I vote for 460|pg||
nt|peachy: EW play Precision so NT could be 14-16 I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: To me, the West hand is too strong for being a 14-14 - and yes, I am able to count and calculate|pg||
nt|hawe45: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: My 460 were based on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: rational of these tranfer positives with wrong sided Nt often has a huge Disadvantage I feel|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West has shown 6-4 Majors and 8+ HCP, East has just shown 16+|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dima:  Well you can't have it all - most of the time and especially on slam hands 1@c opener is going to finish at the helm|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dima:  And most of the time you'll make the game on power|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s2|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: and this 3 nt plays better with the  W hand as dummy on S on lead (imo) |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ye as Dima said has it's own advantaage the system have to live with the problems|pg||
nt|dima:  An interesting point about the lead - if NS know that W has 6-4 in majors they might try to conceal diamond split|pg||
nt|sybarra: true in any system, has advantages and disadvantages on certain hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Interesting point Dima|pg||
nt|dima:  Had N led @d 2 (4th best I presume) declarer might be tempted to win @d J|pg||
nt|iceak:  In deal 1 - Arons team made 9 imps - contract 3@s minus 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: When declarer's shape is pretty much known, you probably should give wrong count on every opportunity|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes good point Dima|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dima:  Communication cutting move|pg||
nt|sybarra: really can afford to put in J either do you think?|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy from this  vantage point but at the table?......|pg||
nt|sybarra: that should have *cant afford |pg||
nt|suketbombi: declerar knows the @D split and the position of @H Ace has to guess weather to finesse @S or for @HJ both working here|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|mgb81: Is the play really right here?|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|Walddk1: They have a system they are comfortable with and that's what matters|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, as much as I fancy to lead my singleton no matter what, this was the moment to hide the singleton @C with the trumps :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mgb81: Indeed it is playing a natural system where you can raise clubs, but it feels like having to pass th west cards after 1C (1H) isn't a good idea.|pg||

nt|dburn: useful result for ENgland, this - East-West can make 3NT, and North-South can make 1NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: would definitely open 1|pg||
nt|mgb81: The north hand feels worht an upgrade given the good suit and quality of the controls|pg||
nt|dburn: or at any rate, did make 1NT|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: i think it is ok to open either 12-14 OR 15-17 NT with that north hand|pg||
nt|athene: it's right on the borderline and the extra tactical advantage for 1nt opener means you bend it as necessary|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|henryb:  North will lose her @cA if she does not take it|pg||

nt|iceak:  10 tricks most surely|pg||

nt|mgb81: So in the other room Ruth Connelly, who is somewhat of an agressive bidder, bid 1C, then 2C and gave herself 5C when 4S came back to her|pg||
nt|mgb81: Sally Brock though long and hard whether to bid 5S, but after some though she doubled for penalties.|pg||
nt|athene: if west really wanted to bid over 4@H then at least bid 4NT so partner can choose diamonds when it's right|pg||
nt|hawe45: There is a faster method to get 660 - just claim after the lead|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@h shaky|pg||
mb|1D!|an|Prec.|nt|iceak:  much depends on @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: N probably just bids 4 @H  |pg||
mb|1H|nt|dima:  3@h or 1@h?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: maybe she felt it might help in the play to have concealed the side suit|pg||
nt|mgb81: It doesnt even look like 4S is that easy - if south plays ace, king and ruff s diamond low east can overuff the 7 with the 8 and bang another turmp back|pg||
nt|sybarra: some part score here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: thin 4@s here|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 2 sp|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Moya Kelly as south had a few choices after 1C P 1H - she could double, bid 2NT, or just 1S.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Um, I'm with Simon on this one|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is if you show the 5-5 you can't really show the values - 2nt would usually be weaker|pg||
nt|copeyj: Why Sarah, what does Simon think? :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: can they get to it (nad do you want to be in it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: This way he got to bid both Dima :) 1 and 3 @H|pg||

nt|steshome:  Yes, you're right Bill made the 4NT comment.  But of course I'm with you in any event|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It does not help England's cause that the Welsh are committing suicide at the moment|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|mgb81: eek! I can understand both of EW actions (unlike -360 against 1S X) but this is going to get murdered on a trump lead|pg||
nt|dima:  :)|pg||
nt|dima:  seems natural to play double finesse in @d|pg||
nt|iceak:  Karl probably plays low @s and JÃ³n low @d|pg||
nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var sry|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: time for north to get out the big stick of justice|pg||
nt|athene: the 5-level is no time to volunteer 2-card support|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will probably be 1100 as well|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|peachy: Wish I knew their methods, but I dont|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Showing 4@H and 5+ @C|pg||
nt|peachy: There is alert on 3C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: 6-5 come alive, yes - but only when you actually have a trump fit in one of your long suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@C probably puppet to 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: tought to time this one |pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: west has followed the rule "6-2 come alive"|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps it should be "6-2 in the glue"|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I think we all agree that 3@H was an overbid|pg||
nt|mgb81: how about "6-5-2, that wont do"|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: people often bid too aggressively when they have shortage in opps' suit but not that big a fit for partner|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Friendly defence may keep this to 800|pg||
nt|athene: these hands are really difficult to control|pg||
nt|athene: when the ruffing value is with only 2 trumps - even with 3 trumps it can get out of hand very easily|pg||
nt|mgb81: Alice can get pout for 800 now - it looks like she can cross ruff but the 7 of hearts will come into play|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|santyclz: LOTT say 16 tricks, looks more like 18 to me.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (says)|pg||
nt|sybarra: low spade and ?|pg||
nt|dima:  now low @d and he has to guess |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Actually a trump from West kills the contract|pg||
nt|dima:  true heart is better as specs mention|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|santyclz: Perhaps only 17.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, then 3NT after that apparently showed the clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Attitude lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: club return easy,  @D a guess, (with good guess will bring it home) hts and messes up communication |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|Walddk1: Scotland let a 4@S through that should have gone down as the play went, so +29 only now|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: north would have done better to keep the spades|pg||
nt|mgb81: hello|pg||
nt|mgb81: this looks like she's in the game now....|pg||
nt|athene: just let a little club go - what use is that?|pg||
nt|mgb81: that is a very expensive slip from south - turned 800 into 300 if declarer reads it right|pg||
nt|athene: if north had kept all her spades this was 1100 just the same|pg||
nt|athene: just ace and a trump, end of story|pg||
nt|mgb81: now eats has virtually claim on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk1: This is the board where Wales were allowed to make 4@S|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bit barking to play at the 5-level on a grotty 8-card fit.  Mind you, the opponents played at the 5-level on a grotty 7-card fit |pg||

nt|iceak:  @h Q could drop - declares does not know|pg||

nt|Walddk1: 18|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: 13 i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: 13 imps this set...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: hmmm|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I am talking VPs, you IMPs|pg||
nt|mgb81: I the other room I'm afraid Ruth has started to tilt by opening a completely normal weak 2 hand with 3H|pg||
nt|mgb81: It didn't lead her to any harm though this time|pg||
nt|hawe45: 6 @D seem better than 6 @H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 9 boards 12 imps so far, this has been good bridge.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: it's like comparing apples and oranges|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mgb81: Ah I didnt actually see she was 3rd in seat I thought she was first|pg||
nt|hawe45: No need for finding the @C Queen|pg||
nt|iceak:  guess 1NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D!|an|!H raise|nt|mgb81: Now it's more understandable|pg||
nt|mgb81: same as here|pg||
nt|iceak:  wrong as expected|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: east might have considered 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: that has to be a fit bid as a passed hand|pg||
nt|mgb81: Ah - I am now told that the actual auction was 2H (2S) 3H all pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: N finding the 1 @S call "interesting" |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I think E-W will not bid slam unless N-S push them by 1 more @S bid?!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Good poin Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk1: point even|pg||
nt|santyclz: How many for a 2@s bid on 1st round?|pg||
nt|jbennet: again at this situations its good to have 2 ways to bid spades.|pg||
nt|jbennet: N now faces a guess. does South have full valus or does he only competing?|pg||
nt|dima:  2@d is likely to be a constructive @h raise - 7-9 or so with 2@h raise reserved for really junky hands|pg||
nt|jbennet: the same should be applied to NS.|pg||
nt|iceak:  seems 4 no more than 9 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|jbennet: so 2H and 2 sp both show spade suit.|pg||
nt|dima:  North might try 3@h as gametry in @s|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: south might double here rather than bidding 3@S? |pg||
nt|hawe45: I would never bid 3 @S in this situation - just helping opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, depends on what 2@S meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: I am quite confident, that East knows, who is in position of the @C Queen = 680|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S was 8-13 balanced, no @S stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so as not to overstate the support|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS can't make very much either a club ruff or a heart trick for the second undertrick|pg||
nt|steshome:  Double's probably game-try|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but of south only had competing valus 3 sp is likely to be too high|pg||
nt|dima:  Oh well he makes Sandra Landy game try - bid it first then try to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|iceak:  Favorable @c|pg||
nt|dima:  They might know each others 3rd seat opening bids |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Friendly @C layout might see this home|pg||
nt|dima:  brilliant small @h lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A small @H lead would have been killing|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n more likely to play small @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Seems that declarer might be tempted to work on @D which will not work|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: lucky not to get hit in this|pg||
nt|athene: east might well consider double if really in need of imps|pg||
nt|jbennet: seems 4 sp too high.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but lucky break makes it possible.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: well e/w are missing some spots in @D,   |pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not see a way to make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: -100 probably good going|pg||
nt|iceak:  plays @h to K - for a trump|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|steshome:  With a 10-count opposite a weak two?  Nah|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|hawe45: 3 @S X = 800, better than game|pg||
nt|jbennet: i think though best bet is too draw trumps ending in dummy and then start the clubs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mgb81: East does best to switch to hearts and then if north finesses she can give a club ruff for 3 down|pg||

nt|athene: maybe the moral of the story is, don't go raising partner with a doubleton|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It does not matter much what happens at this table from now on. It is being decided in the Scotland-Wales match|pg||
nt|steshome:  Aye <waves a daffodil>|pg||
nt|mgb81: Yes <waves a leek>|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Poetry in motion|pg||
nt|hawe45: A @H-contract now, possibly|pg||
nt|dima:  Pretty strong set for NS so far - that 4@h on N8 was a bit of a stretch but could have also made|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s or 5@d seems|pg||
mb|2S!|an|Tartan, 5!S + minor, weak|nt|sybarra: nice 4 @H  likely makng +1 for e/w|pg||
nt|hawe45: The @S 10 in East is the only card to defeat 7 @H, but also a @S-lead kills it|pg||
nt|hawe45: Black squeeze against West|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: save in 4 @S?  a trick in every suit  |pg||
mb|4S|nt|mgb81: in the event of a tie....is it the head to head match that counts? |pg||
nt|santyclz: Doubt n-s will get into the auction.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: club ruffs|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now East can really "disturb" the slam-bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Investigating|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead very costly in the other room|pg||
nt|hawe45: But the more E/W bid @D, the more South will be happy for partners values - showed in controls allready|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, East seems to think that 2@D was a takeout of @Ds!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: multi,  then 3 @c weak with hts, etc to 4|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H by E might have caused more problems than 2D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good practical bid by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: after 2nt they are likely to end in 4@H the same in here|pg||
nt|athene: then east just has to lead a diamond rather than a spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: right, didnt notice the club ruffs|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzdh: I actually wondered if he would open 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: S 2 @S looked like a 2 suited (tartan type) bid |pg||
nt|iceak:  no reason to find play to loose 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: some call it Muiderberg|pg||
nt|sybarra: tartan's are 5/5  and muiderberg can be 5/4+  |pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: Many play 3@c to be good w/@hs.|pg||
nt|hawe45: @D-lead - let´s see Søvar make the overtrick - but he will probably put his money on a @C-finesse. But with spectators, one is obliged to make the squeeze|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Claim on a @C finesse|pg||

pc|s3|nt|mgb81: I am told that Maida Grant has just found the onlylead to beat a game against Wales that her team-mates missed|pg||
nt|athene: there's surely a good case for just bidding 4@H over 2nt with that north hand?|pg||
nt|mgb81: so it might be 6 to Scotland instead of a possible 10 to Wales|pg||
pc|sK|nt|steshome:  Checking back for the 4-4 spade fit - might play better|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mgb81: Here North south employ a common treatment whereby 3S is forcing with 4 spades and 4 or 6 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: No one seems to know how they break a tie. I asked 5 'competent' people|pg||
nt|dima:  next case|pg||
nt|sybarra: need take the club or they dont get it|pg||
nt|dima:  might try to steal a heart trick but if it must be 5-5 then unlikely to work|pg||

pc|s5|nt|mgb81: had she ducked the second club from dummy she would have made 2 tricks which would have been enough. as it is a spade switch will lead her to down one I think|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: After AK clubs located and now SK, the HQ will not be hard to locate as with opening hand, E likely would have said something on 1D|pg||

nt|iceak:  EW use to have a good system|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to 14 |pg||
nt|jbennet: passing is showing some weakness in personality and causes a lower status in the hiearchy . |pg||
nt|sybarra: and we will come back to 16 as last bd |pg||
nt|sybarra: some early thank you's are in order |pg||
nt|iceak:  Interesting how SÃ¦var will bid|pg||

nt|sybarra: Many thanks, to our operator Stefan Jonsson. A job well done! |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|hawe45: North could also open 1 @H 11-15|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mgb81: I have to say this is the most exciting Lady Milne I've ever seen|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is a possible overcall for north, i think|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Finally, our gratitude to Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and the NIBU (Robin Burns) for ensuring that this fine event was brought to BBO. Greatly appreciated by bridge fans ...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: all over the world|pg||
nt|mgb81: 1NT? is that a joke bill?|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbennet: easy to get too high here.|pg||
mb|2N!|an|Lebensohl|nt|hawe45: 8 tricks on a @S-lead|pg||

nt|dima:  Karl is feeling well now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: with 100 for honours in spades? a 14 count and two suits wide open?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Undo, pls|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mgb81: yes its so bad!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: looks roughly like a 1nt overcall to me, but ok|pg||
nt|hawe45: Small @H now = only hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: but if souths now signs off then North should respect that.|pg||
nt|iceak:  Sees @d fit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dima:  Is 2@s GF or only RF?|pg||
nt|dima:  Ok answered|pg||
nt|jbennet: 2NT was probably telling "i am week"|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45: @D now to the Jack - and SMALL!!! from North = best defence|pg||
nt|hawe45: But as the @H´s are cleared, normal defence also works|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jbennet: north respected it.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|santyclz: Best defense would seem 500.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|iceak:  SparisjÃ³Ã°ur lost 11 on 11 by playing 5@d instead of 4@s|pg||
nt|jbennet: on a bad day even 3 D is -1|pg||
nt|iceak:  2NT was most surely showing a weak hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|santyclz: Cash 4 @cs and exit with @ha, @h.|pg||

nt|mgb81: south can lay a top club|pg||

nt|dima:  BOOM!|pg||
nt|jbennet: but still be able to choose 3NT.|pg||
nt|jbennet: stupid bid.|pg||
nt|iceak:  But bid at both tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, it is very hard to teach the scorpion not to bite|pg||
nt|jbennet: we all hate to be preempted.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mgb81: Welcome everyone to the final set of the Lady Milne|pg||
nt|mgb81: the current score as we just saw see Scotland only 1VP ahead of England|pg||
nt|mgb81: so there is literally everything to play for|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Hello Sarah, Michael and Bill|pg||
nt|mgb81: here north has made an inverted minor suit raise and south indicated a weak no trump hand|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hello Roland! |pg||
nt|mgb81: north might be thinking of a slam, but even the 5 level might be too high.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now S has to make it |pg||
nt|iceak:  SparisjÃ³Ã°ur seems to be winning back|pg||
nt|jbennet: very well put. |pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: on a club lead however |pg||
nt|dima:  no play|pg||
nt|jbennet: everybody has a "reptile brain" ; which is governed by emotions not by common sense and judgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: you put it more succinctly dima|pg||
nt|iceak:  9 tricks|pg||
nt|jbennet: if one should randomize a lareg number of layouts consistent with south:s opening bid.|pg||
nt|dima:  N does have a touching trust in his partner's suit quality preempt, but still 4@s is unLAWful and will lose IMPs here|pg||
nt|jbennet: then everybody would find that to enter with 4H is a huge huge losing bid..|pg||
nt|sybarra: could get very ugly if he goes up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  you have 8 trumps , opponents rate to have at most 9 so ..|pg||
nt|jbennet: and 4 spades was also a stupid action.|pg||
nt|iceak:  No reason to go up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  It could be from Q87 or so he preys ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South is a very solid citizen, so North definately imagined 4@S as a rather good contract|pg||
nt|jbennet: but again the "repitle brain" caused a losing call. |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: "Only" needing the ace of @C with the 4@H bidder|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but if now 4 spades makes.|pg||
nt|jbennet: the 4 h is surely likely to be 3 off at least.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But a double seems to stand out at IMPs. Collecting a safe 300-800, instead of a 50% 620|pg||
nt|dima:  How in the world do you come to 10 tricks? Even opposite AK10xxxx + side King you need more then ONLY Ace onside|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mgb81: a misguess in spades is all it takes to go one down, as the two discards are useless to the south hand|pg||
nt|mgb81: ah thats a practical shot|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is penultimate bd of this set |pg||
nt|santyclz: N didn't find that lovely @c preempt and e-w got to 6@s-1 for Vestri's 1st big score.|pg||
nt|sybarra: told you .... |pg||
nt|sybarra: was playing to make it |pg||
nt|jbennet: but bidding is a sort of "alfa male" action.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mgb81: One of the kibbitzers has suggested north might raise to 4NT, but if souths bid 6NT with something like KQJx, KJx, J10xx, Kx there will be a small problem in the ace department|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h5|nt|peachy: 2NT is often played in this auction as "two places to play"|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @s now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or @c?|pg||

nt|dima:  NS will quickly be in 4@h i think as you have to playing vs. strong club|pg||
nt|iceak:  double 5-7 I think|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar has more ambitions than that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sorry, Karl|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar, on the other hand, must have some ambitions now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east might get vaguely interested facing drury i suppose|pg||
nt|mgb81: 2C here is drury showing 9+ and 3 trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: some danger with this - if it persuades West that @cK is a good card for slam purposes...|pg||
nt|mgb81: 3C is some sort of long suit try|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand if 3@C is a long suit try, west must feel that at least some of those spade cards are wasted|pg||
nt|mgb81: wets might bid 3S now...4D from east 4H from west will east then pass it?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but facing @sxx  @hAKQxxx  @dA  @cAxxx, slam is well worth bidding|pg||
