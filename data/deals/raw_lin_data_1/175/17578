nt|jcomyn: good selection|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|jcomyn: and they will i'm sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  difficult to evaluate the W hand with so many soft values|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee didnt think professional golfers p[layed bridge|pg||
nt|larrymori: the K@s too with a flat hand|pg||
nt|larrymori: he might have acted the first time so in that sense he has more|pg||

nt|ianmcc: except grey hair|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: haha|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one is 20-20 game a stretch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a keep out of trouble hand to start with|pg||

nt|jcomyn: hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may need these,  since this is "not standard" |pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a horrible bunch of misfits - not us - the hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be us also LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if all stay low |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would open N hand  |pg||
nt|sybarra: ak, a|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strong club for N-S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Daniela|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Bob, Bill and Andy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: 5@d on EW|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kiwibridge: I enjoyed watching Braithwaite & Richman|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Precision a la Angelini|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45: N/S can make a very lucky 3 NT here, but hardly bid it|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S or 5@D |pg||
mb|2S|nt|woozle: 4H is fair (but down)...vulnerable I'd definitely want to be there|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: can NS really make 3nt? how do they get to dummy to finesse diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT would be my (bad resulting) bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is -1, but I think they will take a sacrifie - which will make|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen might very reasonably drive to game here, particularly considering the hands that this pair haven't overcalled|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now what?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be played doubled? |pg||
nt|psyck: 1N=@c or puppet to @c i guess|pg||
nt|athene: maybe in spades, given time :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: @S Jack is the entry|pg||
nt|hawe45: - but I said: VERY lucky|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt might be some either/or bid - those are sort of the norm after strong club|pg||
nt|athene: so clubs or something else, maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning all|pg||
nt|bobholl: typical screen wait :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: strong enough for one try ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: source of tricks very scarc e here|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 @D should end the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, could be a suction variant with @c or red suits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: and getting scarcer|pg||
nt|sybarra: was typing,  "not sure this is success either"|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 @D is jumping into fire |pg||
nt|sybarra: (out of frying pan)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: best to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ not an entry for trump finesse playing in diamonds :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  may not have to try anymore|pg||
nt|bobholl: double all pass :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hawe45: Will be defeated - with the @S-ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45: - not any longer|pg||
nt|athene: now he can just play ace and a diamond, lose @SAK, @DK, @CA|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: and its "good luck pard" with a smile |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like 1 down with 5@d cold!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Henry!|pg||
nt|henryb:  I wonder why West did not raise diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4S bid is very loose, and possibly down more than one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: rescue|pg||
nt|woozle: Likely phantom|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|athene: only way the contract might go down is spade shift and then try to ruff a club|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: right John!  this can not be worse  (only 50's) |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|athene: then @DK overruff, @S ruff|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sometimes I think dbl is used very bad instead of supporting|pg||
pc|d4|nt|woozle: diamond, diamond ruff, club, diamond ruff, club or heart to come (if the defense don't cash the HA the heart runs away...if they do, two clubs run away)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|andyv:  2@s very limited in range...3-7 hcp which may be reason for lack of try by S...W's balance will not meet with teammate approval|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: but fall of @CQ ought to change declarer's mind|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: ace and a diamond completely safe now|pg||
nt|hawe45: North will hardly ruff @C - seeing the @C Queen coming down |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|woozle: Good hand to show off the law - EW make 9 tricks in their nine card fit, NS make8 tricks in their eight card fit. If 4H was making, 4S would be -500|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @hA what else?|pg||
nt|athene: no way anyone can win the @DK and give his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: well|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|athene: if he had cashed the @CK and seen the queen fall, yes|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: I think we call these kind of hand "buzz sawa" |pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: but the way it went it was not so obvious that the @CQ was stiff|pg||
nt|athene: but still|pg||
nt|athene: ace and a diamond was 100% to make 3@D at that point|pg||
nt|hawe45: This will not be the best played hand of the tournament|pg||
nt|athene: definitely very bad play|pg||
nt|athene: i guess "first board syndrome"|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north thought that west had the clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: All beginning is difficult|pg||
nt|athene: since west bid them|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: maybe he did not check what 1nt meant|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: *buzz saws"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: get out fast before you lose your head|pg||
nt|bobholl: a of @C claim|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|an|any game forcing|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am getting lots of suggestions for Top 5. Good ones indeed. All I can say is that you can only have 5 pairs in Top 5|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes, I had a tied 5th|pg||

nt|woozle: On a good, day, 4H NS might make ten tricks. This is not a good day.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec points out that East's low @d was spot on|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: first board and last board are the killers for keeping concentration|pg||
nt|athene: the ones in between, they are hard too|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  -800 usually not what you expect when opps are not in game|pg||
nt|athene: i think that possibly east should bid 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: the point being it's very likely his partner might balance disastrously|pg||
nt|athene: east is a passed hand - how bad can 3@C be?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is just with benefit of hindsight|pg||
nt|andyv:  but in imps, is there a reason for W to balance?|pg||
nt|andyv:  poor quality suit, and, except for 6th @h, the hand is balanced|pg||
nt|athene: well the hand does go to prove one point which is that just because opps have stopped low, doesn't mean it's safe to come in|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, the severity was pretty extreme|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: fantoni nunes defended better as usual in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so -2!|pg||
nt|athene: but still should have been a much bigger swing|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D was cold|pg||
nt|athene: it's almost always safer to act aggressively earlier rather than pass and back in|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a rather easy 4@h on EW|pg||
nt|henryb:  good thing E-W missing 2 aces. otherwise W might drive to a no-play slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|sybarra: dealer having fun today?|pg||
nt|athene: at the point he won the second club|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 NT better be played by East - only @D-lead brings trouble|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: 1 @S denies 4 sp |pg||
nt|athene: but that was a particularly tough one |pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: 1@C is natural (ish) and 14+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: West not worth 2 bids|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so 1NT shows 4 s then?|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me look for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: hitting the deck again? |pg||
nt|athene: 2@S just a natural game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: he knows E opened 1 @C a "good hand" |pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead and heart back, ducked|pg||
nt|athene: if NS find that you call the director|pg||
nt|hawe45: and the police|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|athene: they play transfer responses so 1@S response would be limited with no major|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt stronger than 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|athene: basically if anyone has not seen NS before, they play an unusual system|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a fast claim I hope|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ianmcc: the vul got him|pg||
nt|athene: fairly strong, forcing 1 level bids|pg||
nt|athene: 14+ or thereabouts|pg||
nt|athene: weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: 2-level bids are 10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that @d suit is never mentioned.|pg||
nt|athene: so after the 1-level openers, responder can force to game on ten counts|pg||
nt|athene: and they can set up a game force quickly and often|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessed east would lead red but this is better|pg||
nt|athene: normally you would prefer to have the lead running up to a strong notrump rather than through it|pg||
nt|athene: but here the red tenaces are protected at least|pg||
nt|bobholl: will be so !|pg||
nt|henryb:  At my local club :) there would be two pairs in 5@h and at least one in a partial|pg||
nt|henryb:  also, probably, one in 3N|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: good spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades might have been @D,  I am still chedking |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm all for supporting with support, but West's 4D looks excessive with the secondary misfit|pg||
nt|athene: worth pointing out that if north at any points found the @H7 lead(and south had not led the suit) and declarer plays the king, south has to duck|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see 52 cards the 8 is so obvious :)|pg||

nt|jcomyn: odd looking result from closed room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: 2@H weak with both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I weonder what pass is|pg||
nt|jcomyn: goo judgement|pg||
nt|larrymori: a little more constructive 2@h with both majors seems more useful|pg||
mb|2H!|an|5+!s/4+!h 5-9|nt|andyv:  a four letter word|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|larrymori: a duplication? lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: if 2 H weak both majors then ok bid. |pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|jcomyn: also a thing between mountains|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  Lauria adding 2 points for Versace's playing ability|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbennet: 3NT laydown other side and would surely be reached if given a free run|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  he'a about a K shy for his bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: interesting flat board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, is it more profitable to concede 400 in 2@S?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jbennet: but if playing against active opponents.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jbennet: then that kind of austion hade renderd.. reopening D fron south.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have been and will never be in Lauria's league, but I think 2@H is some stretch at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *not been|pg||
nt|jcomyn: u are too modest|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbennet: is 1D 4 card suit ?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|rich89: yes|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: 1@C is 2+|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jbennet: then D of 2 sp in last hand has lot to gain and little too lose.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jbennet: but passivity have lost points in the past and will continue to do so.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jbennet: D in balacing position Mus show clubs, and east have shown at most 9 points.|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||

nt|Walddk2: According to the CC, 2@H is 5-9 with at least 5 spades and 4 hearts|pg||
mc|4|nt|jbennet: yes and then souths final pass will render a passivity warning.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Running scores at   http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html |pg||
nt|hawe45: No comments|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @H 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@h NO PROBLEM THANKS TO @d t |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: missing DK will hardly bid 7|pg||
nt|hawe45: With N/S bidding the 3 other suits, West will find the @C-lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: their "strong" weak twos often score well (especially against the dutch:)) |pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 1, in OR, 4@h was played by N|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so this north hand is a game force for Fantoni i am sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on NS?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 1@s followed by 3@h would be normal by N|pg||
mb|2H|nt|woozle: This time EW might reasonably attempt 5D|pg||
nt|athene: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: north is intending to just show a heart raise so not bothering with the spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 1nt on N even if only 14|pg||
nt|bobholl: won't bid it if he doesn't guess to bid 1 nt now (too ligth imo)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|woozle: Buchen's 2D overcall a little ugly with only a five card suit, but the excellent hand and unsuitability of every other call justify it|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie, unfortunately, doesn't know what a vul v not 2-level overcall looks like|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd sooner bid 5D than pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Povl Sommer|pg||
nt|jcomyn: does s hand not qualify for 1c|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: hmmm, 2@c playing a strong @c system...|pg||
nt|athene: usually you do that with a game force which i don't think north really has|pg||
nt|henryb:  not so easy to reach unless N overcalls a weak 1NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi Povl,  welcome |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: too early in the day to try swingy bids|pg||
nt|hawe45: Depuis 40 ans...|pg||
nt|hawe45: Sorry, privat|pg||
nt|bobholl: some kind of truscott i guess|pg||
nt|henryb:  Especially if E elects to respond|pg||
nt|henryb:  which I would|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..4@D now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H both majors nice convention but now ?! :(|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ianmcc: a bold X pls don't convert|pg||
nt|sybarra: N will make a slam try with 4 @d |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|sybarra: 4 @S |pg||
nt|sommer: ..and they should be there|pg||
nt|athene: so, a spade lead and a club loser goes away|pg||
nt|hawe45: 2 @S for the lead???|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|woozle: Buchen steps out a little with a reopening double, diagnosing the short hearts opposite. Christie still thinks that he has a balanced yarborough and just returns to diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: N was too strong for his action after all :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: This cuts communication a little|pg||
nt|athene: ok now declarer can't get to dummy for a pitch on the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: sensible lead|pg||
nt|athene: lead the singleton with a weak hand|pg||
nt|psyck: @h will be entry later|pg||
nt|hawe45: Listen folks - does 2 @S mean: Lead what you like?|pg||
nt|athene: Garozzo said "if you don't lead your singleton, pd shld assume u don't have one"|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 aces away and claim |pg||
nt|henryb:  they might beat this enough to compensate for the game!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sommer: 4@S.. now|pg||
nt|sybarra: up the line cues I guess |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|athene: that doesn't quite mean "always lead your singleton" as people sometimes say|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: but it is fairly close :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Still 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|bobholl: wasn't it the Q he led ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  so what?|pg||
nt|bobholl: otherwise i didn't understand the duck :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: @D set as trump |pg||
nt|jcomyn: that dk still missing though|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are off to the races |pg||
pc|h3|nt|woozle: EW will win seven imps, but a completely worthwhile vulnerable game has gone begging|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sommer: nice and easy, wd|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now 11½|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe he took the pitch earlier|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|hawe45: Even if East ducks the first @H, still 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: east covers in case his pd has @H109x or something|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kiwibridge: still a plus with Klinger stealing 3@H|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and as WE see, it makes 13 tricks fast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this WONT take long|pg||
nt|athene: always hard to duck with a doubleton honour|pg||

nt|ianmcc: very|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is NS play 2@C as natural or a 3-card limit raise |pg||
nt|athene: quite common idea so you can stop at the 2-level when partner has a really bad hand|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: another one where we can't see what happened in the CR|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this 4@s could make needs W to break @d?|pg||
nt|woozle: EW can put on some pressure by bidding to 5C here, which needs hearts led at trick one or two to beat it|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S, meanwhile, appears to need a diamond shift to beat it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nor should this|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is a good sac against 4@H here|pg||
nt|hawe45: Only game here is 3 @D doubled|pg||
nt|athene: nunes obviously did not think his hand quite good enough for a 2@D opener|pg||
nt|athene: (10-13, unbalanced, 5+@D)|pg||
nt|athene: they tend to be ultra disciplined with those|pg||
nt|athene: so it has to be a ridiculously good 9|pg||
nt|psyck: not with all values outside i guess|pg||
nt|athene: a 9 that is basically a 12 :)|pg||
nt|psyck: we will have to wait a little longer for the imps to flow|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so as well as 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: With +600/620 or -100 as the options, I'd much rather be playing than defending|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice to be spectating this one|pg||
nt|woozle: Sorry, not so sure that the diamond shift is necessary to beat 4S - discard is in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but endplay?|pg||
nt|sommer: this?..this may be a swing|pg||
nt|sommer: ..if N dares to bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 18-19 i take it|pg||
nt|sybarra: X will now = @D I suspect |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: but if the defense never break diamonds, a one-suit squeeze on east will work|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D interesting - sometimes you have to open 1@D with various "loose" hands in a strong club system|pg||
nt|athene: but usually with 6 clubs you can open 2@C!|pg||
nt|athene: maybe their 2@C opener denies a 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 2@S may be 2 controls|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt think sacrifice now|pg||
nt|sommer: nope..very passive by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i really must hunt out a CC for NS :) then i could actually stop just guessing haha|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|psyck: Usually, in a strong @c system, it is the long relays we cannot make sense of, here even their natual bids are unnatural :(|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D is always a bit of an amorphous blob in 5-card major strong 1@C systems|pg||
nt|athene: just not usually this sort of blob :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't know their system (yet) but looks like strong club with conventional answers |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|sommer: got a chance there too, to X|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|woozle: Perhaps not. My imagination is getting ahead of me. East will be endplayed if he comes down to KJT of diamonds, but if he keeps the 6 and ditches a minor honour then West's diamond ...|pg||
nt|woozle: pips will save him|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i dont like this style of bidding with this kind of shape|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck: we can just ignore the 1st round of bids & it looks fine though...|pg||
nt|hawe45: With an easy @H-guess, East can make 4 @D - if N/S do not find the @H-ruff|pg||
nt|athene: i assumed it was just 1@C natural, 1@H transfer, 1nt natural, new minor forcing|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is tak 'em or dont get 'em |pg||
nt|athene: not trivial perhaps to bid 3@D with east |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT much better than 4@S @C lead and swiftly 1 down |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: only in nt |pg||
nt|sommer: sry..I'm told, E showed 5c@H|pg||
nt|athene: might feel he is just hanging partner for a good balancing action|pg||
nt|psyck: E was afraid of crucifying pd for balancing|pg||
nt|athene: also he might just assume that north has implied some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: since usually you will do if you open 1@D and rebid clubs, even if you might have longer clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: I also have to sleep some time, this contract is a 2-minut-one...!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://bridgetopics.com/news/2011/apr/fantunes-and-garozzo-play-angelini-salsomaggiore is about this match|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d looks like xfer to @hs, otherwise 3N doesn't make sense with E hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: i'm told that 1@D generally promises a 4-card major in the NS methods, so 2@C showed 4 spades|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: i was wondering why he ignored the spades, but if he has implied them, that is ok :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sommer: ..the 3@C did|pg||
pc|s4|nt|woozle: It would all work if the D8 was in North|pg||

mb|p|nt|rich89: in my opinion, it would give a great info for the lead|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|jbennet: north have an opening bid because of the vulnerability.|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  W may dbl again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well it must be up to e to bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: unless North intial pass makes him afraid that they might miss 4 sp if he passes. |pg||
nt|larrymori: north can still raise before east|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N raises, S will bid game|pg||
nt|jbennet: North might feel compelled to raise 1 step. |pg||
nt|andyv:  the 2@s bid was not one of strength|pg||
nt|larrymori: north might have showed a fit with a good hand earlier|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: can be pushed to 4s but that could be dangerous|pg||
nt|jbennet: and if North raises south bids game. then its north:s intial pass that made all the damage. However EW must not lead clubs. |pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure how S can't bid 4@s|pg||
nt|jbennet: south doesnt know there norths values are.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rich89: he can't|pg||

nt|bobholl: 3@H or 3@S the limit but ???|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|psyck: x wide ranging opp a nebulous opening|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the double of 1@D just says "i am doubling whatever minor he has for takeout " :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will they miss @H now ?|pg||
nt|athene: many people bid 1@S with that west sort of hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@s from S?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: these nebulous minor openers cause a whole lot of interesting problems for both sides|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you see it a lot more with short 1@C openers|pg||
nt|hawe45: In fact, best game is 3 NT - with @S 5-1, 4 @H might be a looser|pg||
nt|athene: but they they are stuck when the bidding comes back to them in 4@H or something|pg||
nt|athene: they have to bid 5@C and now partner can't go back to 4@S if he wants to|pg||
nt|athene: much more descriptive to bid clubs first then spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @C lead 4@S migth make|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: could be lively auction|pg||

nt|bobholl: now N has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that nunes splinters for hearts with no more than a minimum opener (in their style)|pg||
nt|athene: the italians generally lay great stress on showing the shape in competition like this |pg||
nt|bobholl: will bid 5@D now i guess|pg||
nt|athene: two small in clubs looks very bad from north's point of view - but not if you know partner has a singleton :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but may be not strong enough sure :)|pg||
nt|athene: will west lightner double hearts?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would force NS to find the better spot in @hs|pg||

nt|athene: "i'm not opening 1@D with 1 diamond and six clubs!"|pg||
nt|athene: quite right too|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sommer: S had a chance to find 5@C by bidding 2@C....|pg||

nt|athene: 4@H "game"|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|woozle: Someone asked about a low spade instead of the queen. That's complex, and I think that Smolanko would have had to find the weird play of the jack from dummy to make|pg||

mb|2C|nt|woozle: So do I. I don't think that anybody figured out the diamond tap thing without Deep Finesse though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Double?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..in b 4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another slam but can it be bid|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: you surely have to do something over 3@S with that east hand?|pg||
nt|psyck: this better|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: this X is outside my knowledge:)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: easy 4@S bid now for south - in fact larry thinks he should bid 5@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: ("bid to the level of your fit")|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: i predict 5@C from east now|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of situation where it's much better to have screens|pg||
nt|bobholl: not strong enough for a "normal" weak 2|pg||
nt|athene: many would overcall 1@S with that east hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: repsonsive type |pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..he felt maybe too strong for jump to 4@S??|pg||
nt|athene: at club level, it only takes a slight variation in tempo|pg||
nt|athene: for west to double fast with a trump trick and slightly slower with values outside spades|pg||
nt|athene: and E knows when to leave and when to pull :)|pg||
nt|athene: i see so many pairs doing this and they might not even realise it is dodgy :)|pg||
nt|athene: decent suit texture|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: even over 1@s pas he has no good bid|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|woozle: Smolanko's raise to 2H inadequate - that's what he would bid with a balanced minimum, and this hand is anything but|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|psyck: could be the 1st big swing now|pg||
nt|athene: never lead unsupported aces just because partner bid the suit! :) ok this was a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo tends to overcall aggressively at the 1-level so he might well|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C preclude to invite in @H i guess|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|woozle: 3H initially should incite Anderson to bid game, diagnosing the short diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|woozle: Still, making 3 or 4 will be worth 1-2 imps, potentially vlauable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree peter. I cannot see any reason for 2@c|pg||
nt|pelu: @DQ is the 100% normal lead - but - again - a trump would have worked better|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: taking a long time to find that big s fit|pg||
nt|athene: now the problem is if declarer uses the @DA to lead a heart up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, it was certainly an uncomfortable lead situation for S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sommer: ..and this slam isn't good...but it makes|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: NS would open 1@C with any balanced hand i think|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|woozle: Klinger's "raise" to 2H in the other room just as bad, but then he compounded it by defending 3D|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree again, but @c10 can solve the trumph suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: but can't west have akxxxx ax x xxx thats enough for 4@S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: so they can use the 1nt rebid artificially|pg||
nt|bobholl: a@S 2@C and a@D to loose|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: no good|pg||
nt|athene: he is banking on the diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45: Not the winning line here|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he could never make it with heart ruffs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: we will not see a new leader yet|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pelu: S can expect @Cs 5-3 and 4 by pd - and C10 will stop some cross_ruffs|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|athene: he doesn't expect the @HA to be onside|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: duck!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sommer: it is close to 50% after S opened and nothing tells that @H are 5-1, so ok...close to 50%|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|hawe45: Expensive now|pg||
nt|athene: if north had doubled (an ace facing an opening bid) that might have tipped declarer off to the winning line|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|woozle: Klinger seems to be toying with a 54321 point count...armed with that method, the North hand is just average in high cards (15)|pg||
nt|andyv:  can S strip the read suits and duck a @s to E hand?|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure East has a problem, but if u look for perfect hand by partner - u almost never find them :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|hawe45: How can you possibly play trumps - with 3-4 @H-loosers|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|mc|8|nt|athene: a spec points out that if declarer is going to rely on 2-2 diamonds he could just as well do that before drawing trumps|pg||

nt|pelu: 3@h would be my bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|andyv:  will be interesting if they get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east knows he wants to sac in 4@S over 4@H and perhaps is trying a sort of semi-psychic bid suggesting a strong raise|pg||
nt|athene: in the hope of not getting doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: I've looked in vain in the bidding boxes|pg||

nt|athene: 5-level is wrong yet again|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: on a @S lead it makes but on @D ??|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks a little pushy, especially NV|pg||
nt|athene: but he has all four tens|pg||
nt|athene: and all four are potentially working very hard|pg||
nt|athene: for example give partner @HJxx on a  heart lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: the clock is ticking|pg||

nt|bobholl: the first 4@S on this table until now the only sizeable difference :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobholl: 4@S good save |pg||

nt|athene: east would like to splinter now except he really hates that diamond lead coming through his @DKJxx|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 6@C now ?|pg||
nt|pelu: strange that Giubilo only bid 2@S - green against red|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: hard-ish for north to find the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: but the defence might get a second chance if declarer tries an immediate club|pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead |pg||
nt|bobholl: aq or 9 of @D ?|pg||
nt|athene: of course there is risk in this bid especially as partner will tend not to have four hearts (no negative double)|pg||
nt|andyv:  3NT a bit myopic (as well as where is the @h stopper?)|pg||
nt|athene: but it looks reasonable enough|pg||
nt|athene: if the play with KJxx in opp's suit doesn't bid notrumps who is going to?|pg||
nt|athene: the player|pg||

pc|sA|nt|pelu: over 3@S N could bid 4@S|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|woozle: Anderson bids his spades...with 4162 or 4072 it would be more tempting to respond 1NT (to give a chance of bidding diamonds later) but this hand can pass a 2C rebid in comfort|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|sommer: 5@C exclusion?|pg||

nt|andyv:  old fashioned here Bill, I'd like a better stopper in unbid suit than the stiff 9 of @hs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|woozle: A club looks more ordinary, but maybe he fancied his chances of catching dummy with 4531.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: bold=?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..nope..just the shot|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt agree with that leap|pg||

nt|jbennet: "Dont preempt with a void" is valid.|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes perhaps we see all the hands.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but north was afraid that Kxxx opposite x with p + Club Q might be enough to beat 4 h.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not even that...unless partner has taken leave of his/her senses, 4@s should be no worse than down 3|pg||

nt|jbennet: BUT south didnt have x|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h was down one only in NS's dreams:)|pg||

nt|woozle: This could be the opportunity that Klinger crave|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone suggest how he got that right|pg||
nt|athene: maybe mina asked himself "what would one of those famous old-fashioned players like garozzo do in this situation?"|pg||
nt|andyv:  did W hand have to be that good?  could W have bid 3@c on Qx, Kxx, x, AKJxxxx?|pg||
nt|athene: and the answer is, you will find out when you score up :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: we will see that shortly :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the result ok - but the play :(:(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: bidding starts the same way at his table|pg||
mb|1H|nt|woozle: Christie overcalls with a rather less good hand than the one which Buchen passed earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 5@d would be more interesting to watch than 3N here...may require @dJ finess in 5@d...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobholl: i would say :(:(:(|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|woozle: Smolanko starts with 2S...a 3S splinter or fit jump in diamonds might have been better options, if available|pg||
nt|sommer: it is best chance|pg||
nt|chilloncan: transfer overcall it seems|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|psyck: we have been speculating quite a vit on their string @c defense :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: or is it "majors-or-minors" or something of that ilk?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ianmcc: lead change|pg||
nt|woozle: Smolanko's 4C doesn't really do justice to his playing strength...Anderson didn't know how good his hand was (there didn't have to be a stiff spade opposite)|pg||
nt|psyck: likely a suction variant, but other possibilities too maybe|pg||
nt|chilloncan: NS well on their way|pg||
nt|athene: might be "spades or..."|pg||
nt|athene: it has certainly caused some confusion, which is the general idea :)|pg||
nt|psyck: suction would be @s or the next two suits (minors) here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: but his partner bid 3@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like down 1 territory|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ianmcc: The auction went very nicely in OR|pg||
nt|woozle: EW had the early running in the auction in the other room - East showed both majors, West jumped to 3S...North judged aggressively (and successfully) to double...but 4S from West ...|pg||
nt|woozle: might have stolen the pot|pg||
nt|athene: north must think that 2@S set up a game force?|pg||
nt|athene: he would surely not bid 3@D there with so good a hand if he thought it was not forcing|pg||
nt|psyck: S has a maximum|pg||
nt|psyck: asuming pass of 1@h was les than 8 hcp|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i played suction ONCE. ishmael delmonte said "you are going to LOVE this". it came up, and when the smoke cleared we were -1400 againt a partial. i couldnt remember the details of ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it. so i said "got any more  gadgets i will love?":)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: made is fairly good possible|pg||
nt|athene: was west going to bid 4@S over 4@D, i wonder?|pg||
nt|athene: that would be a bit of a view|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Try DONTTON next time Marshall :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W needs to shift now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C was gazilli i suppose ?|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 4@S down 2 on @H-ruff? - Verdace in 3NT - @H-lead and S has to find @d10 in on @SA - adn N has to take the 2. @D with @dA - very difficult defense|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: something must have gone wrong if 1400 vs nothing :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the auction developed extremely well for S here. was able to pass first, and then in that context could bid strongly|pg||
nt|athene: i mean surely you could have escaped for only 11 :)|pg||
nt|athene: east was perhaps wondering if his diamond spot there was suit preference|pg||
nt|athene: in case the @DK was a singleton|pg||
nt|andyv:  but this won't do it|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|bobholl: now you should have another @C to lead but alas|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: does he just bid 3@S as a sort of "do something intelligent, partner" noise?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  750|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: can it ever be necessary to attack hearts there?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is worried declarer is getting rid of a heart with the ruffing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|athene: give declarer @HAx(x) or something|pg||

nt|jcomyn: and will a d be led|pg||
nt|larrymori: alternatively, instead of 2@s he might have chosen 3@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  in 5@c it looks like the defense will have two bites at trying to set it since there is no entry to E hand to use A@h for pitch|pg||

nt|woozle: It's easy to be critical, but it would be shortsighted to deny Five Card Standard some of the blame - North had to tread very carefully lest he be facing a balanced minimum with ...|pg||
nt|woozle: three clubs (and potentially, spade wastage)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe there are layouts where it is necessary|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|woozle: Who's bidding 4S?|pg||
nt|athene: another strong club for north|pg||
nt|athene: but this time east can't weave his evil spells|pg||
nt|athene: not having a 5-card suit :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: garazzo still thinking in other room at 5 level in @C|pg||
nt|athene: but in general it's wrong to attack any suit where dummy has a decent holding|pg||
nt|bobholl: (previous board)|pg||
nt|athene: because declarer can't get rid of his losers there anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: admittedly, the lack of a 5-card suit doesn't stop many people from weaving over strong clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: Well, we will be avle to rule out DONTTON & narrow down on Suction if E doesnt act :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: you just suggested it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: stiff sk again. slams are growing out of ther woodwork|pg||
mb|1S|nt|woozle: sorry, last hand....who's doubling and who's passing the double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting gain of 3 imps for Fornaciari on board 8..3N by NS, 1@h there by EW|pg||
nt|athene: NS cheerfully play weak (and offshape) notrump throughout|pg||
nt|athene: and they seem to escape disaster most of the time|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@C - if u only see the EW-cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: another slam 6@s on a finess (but a stiff @sK in front)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: how about "wuction"? stands for wet suction  - you don't bid on 4-4 shapes|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wouldn't describe Claudio as cheerful:)|pg||
nt|athene: haha|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|woozle: Buchen (foolishly to my mind) tries doubling 3NT, but a spade lead could be the last thing that he needs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Buchen making it worse|pg||
nt|athene: interesting 1nt here - i wonder is this a forcing notrump?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Today, it's cold on any lead and he turns -7 imps into -9, but another non-rare outcome will be to talk his partner off the killing lead|pg||
nt|woozle: Smolanko runs. That didn't occur to me, with good spades and the doubler not on lead|pg||
nt|athene: looks strange otherwise with 3-card support|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: north obviously didn't think it was a forcing notrump|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: cant be bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt bet the way things are going|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2 control cards ar missing, so....|pg||
nt|sommer: I take the chance of commentators curse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..2 aces missing|pg||
nt|sommer: so he must jump now to 6@S... I doubt that|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1Nt and not 2@C by East?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C better than 3nt but wouldn't have made either|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: so it was a good X after all?|pg||
nt|woozle: 4C will make four, for a flat board an Klinger still in the lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and picked up 1 on 31|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mr duboin giving it plenty of thought|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S was forcing one round, might be only 4 spades|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: is this a victim for the 5-carnd major opening?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|woozle: Someone suggested that the doubler might have solid hearts, but HE'S NOT ON LEAD|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Klinger also pulled out of the X|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to say who was at fault here without knowing the details of the system|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks after a @c lead|pg||

nt|jcomyn: I love even money |pg||
nt|jcomyn: my slams are usually about 20 per cent|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck: still looks normal to rebid 2@c on 1N|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: if passing 1nt with that north hand was right, then south had to find a stronger bid with his hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: looks so :)|pg||

nt|sommer: ..and there was a risk of 6+% for @D 4-0 too...so..|pg||
nt|athene: after 1@C - 1@D, you are a bit behind standard bidders as you haven't shown any suits and you are a bit higher up|pg||

nt|psyck: NS should not get overboard with no fit here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|woozle: No 7C for me today|pg||
nt|athene: north should definitely have passed the double of 1nt in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: he is balanced with values|pg||
nt|athene: this is soemthing that people often get wrong|pg||
nt|athene: they feel it's like a takeout double so they tend to bid their suits|pg||
nt|athene: but with strong balanced hand you just pass the double as a first action|pg||
nt|psyck: have ther reversed the cards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: I dont - exactly..wasnt W big favorite to hold @HAx(x) and @Cx instead?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding over the nature of the double - lots play X as artificial over strong notrump but you really want it as penalty over weak|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe they put the cards back in the wrong slots|pg||
nt|athene: yes, board must be upside down here i guess|pg||

nt|athene: 1@S 0-11 no 4card major|pg||
nt|athene: (1@C is forcing)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: thanks Daniel great on the vugraph, thanks Ian and Kieran and all specs, Nick Fahrer and the ABF for organising and BBO for the broadcast|pg||
nt|woozle: This is the last board, so as long as Christie-Buchen don't go for about 2000, they're safe|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee that died quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: must be 1@d not 2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|bobholl: be suspicious when they lift volunteerily :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I would X over 2@H - only 10 HCP - but perfect distribution - |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sommer: ..still down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA and another @d for -1|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well done to Christie Buchen, Klinger Haughie and Richman Braithwaite who will now represent Australia in the APBF in June and the Bowl in October|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: couple of great ex_kiwis in that group @H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Thank you all for watching, thanks to all the commentators and spectators. An honourable mention once again to David Stern for providing tim tams for everybody|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm off to cook dinner...thanks for watching everyone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E shouls act direct on 2@h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: should....|pg||
nt|pelu: for me a 99% X|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree!|pg||
nt|bobholl: for me 99,9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|woozle: And thanks to Ian McCance, Gary Hanna, Daniel Braun, and all of the specs who joined in|pg||
nt|andyv:  perfect NT dummy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobholl: ruspa won't agree :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: t5hat too Bob|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: the NS system says 2@D was 8-12 balanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  too bad for declarer that deuces aren't wild|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sommer: ..ahh maybe a squeeze will helt E now|pg||
nt|sommer: I think N HAD to play small @D to ruff to make sure of 5 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: has to finesse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..he has to ruff @D high..take @SH and run the @S'|pg||
nt|pelu: lets see what Lauria will do if N open 2@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: he doubles 100% |pg||
pc|s6|pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: correct Povi! S is squeezed .|pg||
nt|athene: east can see no point plodding on with diamonds with no entry|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: I have a very simple rule. Act as early as possible ans don´t balance if you not are very sure that it is correct|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: so he tries to help his partner out a bit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|athene: many specs point out north hasn't got 8-12|pg||
nt|athene: well, he has 11, but only if you count in base 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did Angelini really bid 2@D? Must be true, hard to believe|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he meant to bid 1@D and pulled the wrong card|pg||
nt|athene: the wrong bidding card|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sommer: ..and finesse!!:) ..of course|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but not any longer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He counted his kings twice I suppose|pg||
nt|bobholl: an overtrick even |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sommer: a shame|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: the cards do lie well for declarer - IF he reads them|pg||
nt|psyck: may have been trying to swing due to a couple of bad boards i guess|pg||
nt|athene: west endplayed in three suits now|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed how bad these natural sandwich notrumps are|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: the odds of partner being broke are just so high|pg||
nt|bobholl: prevents often stealing but now ??!!|pg||
nt|athene: even if you are worried about people responding on air all the time|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: now declarer can unblock his @C8|pg||

nt|bobholl: so sandwich 1nt should be a 2 suiter :) |pg||
nt|pelu: with perfect distribution u often has to press the bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt 3nt 9 tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: set 3 was all Brown as set was Klinger|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Not from West|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd probably open 1NT just like Buchen did...better description of values than 1C then 3C|pg||
nt|psyck: not an easy game to reach, or make (need @c guess rite)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It' easy when @CJ is covered|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well i know there are many strong players who like it to be natural|pg||
nt|athene: i see helgemo bidding it all the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: some number of S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Interesting board 9 - 7@s down 2!|pg||
nt|athene: but i just think the risk/reward ratio is not good|pg||
nt|athene: or at least you have to make it more like 17-19|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural or not, the bid still needed a source of tricks|pg||
nt|athene: good playing strength|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sometimes bridge is easy like on this board:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 10 on small @S|pg||
mb|2N|nt|psyck: that helps i guess :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sommer: ..yes..they went for the 33% grandslam|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  change the @c and @s suit around, and 1N looks much better|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now north will double for takeout |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you double 1nt for penalty and opps run, your next double is takeout|pg||
nt|athene: i remember david burn saying very firmly why this was a bad idea|pg||
nt|athene: but everyone plays this way and it seems sensible to me|pg||
nt|pelu: sometimes the players makes easy to difficult :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|woozle: I predict 11 tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|sommer: ..a little less than 30% rather, I think|pg||
pc|s5|nt|woozle: I think Christie had to enquire to choose between 3NT and 3NT|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: in the other room surely east had showed long clubs at some point so covering the club looks less appealing|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: getting pushy|pg||
nt|sommer: after S' opening, W can upgrade his controlcards a lot|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and will raise...or should|pg||
nt|athene: sadly i wasn't really listening to david so i can't say what his reasoning was :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s true Peter:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @D now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|woozle: With no singleton, 11 tricks in diamonds looks very distant|pg||
nt|psyck: those playing walsh style may have started with 1@s instead of 1@d|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|sommer: ..hmm|pg||
nt|jcomyn: never say will Povi|pg||
nt|psyck: this seq also shows the 45 minors with E probably|pg||

nt|ralfwil: this covers only a 3-3 split|pg||
mc|10|nt|woozle: With North guarding hearts and diamonds, and South spades, there's no squeeze for 12|pg||
nt|athene: if you know hearts are 4-4, why shouldn't you play for the @DQ onside just as much as the @CQ?|pg||

nt|jcomyn: and another s game|pg||
nt|athene: on similar hands you sometimes try to combine chances by playing to drop the @CQ and then finesse the diamonds if that fails, but that will not work if setting up the @CQ is the ...|pg||
nt|athene: 5th defensive trick for them|pg||
nt|athene: so 1@C for south now i think|pg||
nt|athene: always 1@C with the strong notrump even with much better diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|woozle: EW might try a beatable 4H here|pg||
nt|sommer: we have had BIG cards this session|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4-nil breaks are a pest|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: that's hardly the most frisky 1-level overcall i have seen recently|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@C 1@S 1NT all pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|psyck: yes, unfortunate to be so badly punished|pg||
nt|athene: having length and no strength in diamonds is a bad weakness in the hand, to be sure|pg||
nt|athene: but still who would not bid 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: or is it pests|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: very beatable|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|woozle: although the auction will tip declarer off that he should start spades from dummy|pg||
nt|ianmcc: too much in oppo suits|pg||
nt|woozle: The values are poorly located (NS have too many)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: doing well for 140|pg||
nt|woozle: Buchen's 2NT is a thoughtful effort, although if I were to reach 3NT with this hand I'd rather be dummy (a try like 2S might achieve that)|pg||
nt|andyv:  again, 1@s, no 4 card major, 0-11hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: doesnt matter much in this case, I guess..they are off 2 aces and rest in 4|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: now he has to trust him :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 2@s show or ask?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..making 11 even with the plague:)|pg||
nt|psyck: will end in 3N i guessa|pg||
pc|h5|nt|woozle: some kind of length try|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie might push harder for game if vulnerable|pg||
nt|psyck: not that it mattes much with the score to be compared with|pg||
nt|1den1e: diðer konuya gelince dün geldi|pg||
nt|athene: EW don't really lose much by missing game :) that's something i suppose|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|woozle: This should score 140, maybe 170 on soft defense|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: that discard helped declarer|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: of course Fantoni Nunes can go for penalties a lot with their super-sound 1-level openers |pg||
nt|athene: but still it was a view from east with all that stuff in hearts facing possibly 4 hearts in west's hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was only a couple of imps at stake wonce E chose not to pass 1st|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Another point is that South did not raise spades or bid something else|pg||
nt|athene: the danger of partner pulling your re-opening double to a 4-card heart suit is very low in fact|pg||
nt|bobholl: but he won't|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with 4 hearts he would double 1@S himself|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  didn't want to give up 3 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if he doesn't have a trap pass that is|pg||
nt|bobholl: dutch 2 (muiderberg) migth have kept NS out of @S |pg||
mb|2C|nt|ianmcc: 3NT doesn't look good|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1nt "12+-15"|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a reasonable 1nt bid for west there over 1@S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit ligth :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W agrees with you Bob:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it's V with AJ sec|pg||
nt|athene: west just has 1400 in the wrong column on his scorecard :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will make a game try|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT might be their strong 4-card raise|pg||
nt|athene: that's quite common|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: and 6 in a row|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D would be mixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and before that a 1370 too|pg||
mb|4S|nt|woozle: I'm having difficulty believing Buchen's first round pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that's a fairly horrible 11 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Notrump wrong-sided but it would likely go down anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  which turns out to be 13 imps for Angelini as OR only got to 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Spade lead, diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: take a point off for 4333, take another point off for the diamond spots, and take another point off for partner playing them better :) and what do you have left?|pg||
nt|andyv:  @hs can be guessed for one loser but bad @s break will sink 4@s|pg||
pc|dT|nt|woozle: Smolanko declining many opportunities to bid notrumps could cost dearly if Christie hits on the heart lead|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal.  Thanks to my co-commentators Bill & Roland.  Well done Operator. Thanks kibs for joining us & for their inputs.|pg||

nt|ianmcc: my tip is@c|pg||
pc|sA|nt|woozle: Certainly, when your partner, marked with all of the values, didn't overcall over 1C, the only good suit he can have is clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: but E could bid 2nt :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|woozle: Thoughtful lead, but it leaves the result in limbo for the moment. Still probably down|pg||
