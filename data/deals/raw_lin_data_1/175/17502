nt|sga1: Four session to go, only 8 imps difference, any thing possible.|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari should have exited with @ck on winning @SK in last deal, SS was one 1 down|pg||
nt|rv: all 3 teams in the trials are fairly evenly matched though Formidables have the best form in recent months, I anticipate semis and finals to be very close and go down to the wire|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables have been seeded to finals because they won 2 of the 3main qualifying events for the trials, both Summer and Winter Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: Texans won 3rd qualifying event National Masters with very different quorum of team, hence had to pay 5 lacks as direct entry to participate here|pg||
nt|rv: DSM qualified as runner-up of Summer Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: runner-up of Winter Nationals, Poddar Developers did not field team here because of some internal issues, very sad indeed|pg||
nt|rv: 5 lacks translates to 0.5 million rupees, about 10,000 USD:)|pg||
nt|rv: as per current exchange rate approx 11,000 USD|pg||
nt|rv: we have power failure at the venue, lost internet connectivity which means access to game and for Subhash Gupta to be ungagged|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables represented India the maximum times in last decade or so, they have won BFAME 4 times, reached QFs of Bermuda Bowl twice as well as R16 in Rosenblum during this period|pg||
nt|rv: apologies folks, waiting for power and connectivity to be back|pg||
nt|rv: I am not at the venue, doing commentary from home|pg||
nt|rv: P.Sridhar has won silver and bronze medal as part of Texan Aces in 2 successive European Open tournies, SS was part of team when they won bronze and Sumit was part of team when ...|pg||
nt|rv: they silver|pg||
nt|rv: pls stick around, let me call up folks at venue and check|pg||
nt|rv: power just back|pg||
nt|rv: we should be on in a couple of mins|pg||
nt|rv: they do have power back-up / generator at the venue, surprising it is taking awhile|pg||
nt|rv: according to BFI MPs, Pritish Kushari must be amongst the top 3 or 4 MPs holder in the country, he has earned most of the points as part of all-conquering Indian Railways team|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rv: for nearly a decade from mid-90s, Indian Railways used to have monopoly of all National team events|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: neck to neck fight nice to watch sudhir :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|chilloncan: S should open with that hand|pg||

nt|sarkar_suk: yes :)|pg||
nt|rv: great, we are back on and hi again to Subhash Gupta|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|chilloncan: when you dont have spades, you have to get in early or they may make it too awkward for you to compete|pg||

nt|offthebend: hi all|pg||

mb|p|pc|s3|nt|sarkar_suk: nw trump shift shd be :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: tightly contested semi final so far and I am sure it is going that way till the end |pg||
nt|rv: I might have bid 2n or 3@h with Sridhar's hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sga1: But trump shift can only help if N switches to @d after winning @sK|pg||
nt|sga1: so that 2nd trump can also be removed.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|rv: both 3n and 4@h have excellent play for N-S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chilloncan: S actually is not even minimum by Losing Trick Count standards, has playabiulity in at least 2 suits, only mild rebid problems, and can open the suit she wants led. all that adds ...|pg||

nt|rv: Guruji what would be your recommended auction in last deal?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sga1: it could be 2@h/3@H depending on whether NS would compete to 3@C or not.|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor sridhar already stretched his 5 points to make a noise|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|rv: ok back to this one, Kushari's 2n is jacoby, 4+@h, semibal hand, GF|pg||

mb|3H|nt|sga1: 2NT here was natural, opening hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sga1: not Jacoby which many prefer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Jacoby responses have been tailored a lot by different partnerships, traditionally 3 level bids show stiff and 4 level second 5 card suit|pg||

nt|rv: pls undo, North should have opened 2n?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: 77 will come later|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: pl stand bye|pg||
nt|rv: deal where Kushari's misdefense against 2n will now be replayed?|pg||
nt|rv: that will mean 6 IMPs less for Texans and DSM still in lead?|pg||
nt|offthebend: I have just been informed that bd 71 has been cancelled but they will play one extra board |pg||
nt|rv: Pramod, can we adjust the scores here even if we can't watch action on replayed brd?|pg||
nt|rv: possibly deal 71 was foul board because of duplication related issues|pg||
nt|rv: this is not real bidding on this deal, Pramod is getting us back on track|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: sure i shall put the score manually after the board 71 is over|pg||
nt|offthebend: effectively the score stands at 104 -109 in favour of DSM as Mr.Sunit choksi has been fined 2 imps penalty for mobile ringing and bd 71 has to be replayed |pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Rafa: El equipo Severin se tituló campeón, 2do Alti, el 3er puesto no ha terminado|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|offthebend: PS may be regretting his opening NOW |pg||
nt|babs59: seems perfectly respectable to me though|pg||
nt|rv: SS might pass this and they might be just about ok|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|chilloncan: diamonds likely to be 22 after non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|offthebend: Not going to be a success here for texan |pg||
nt|offthebend: when he takes the D finesse ( from the bidding ) -- the roof will cave in |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|babs59: only went -2 in OR with D finesse.   but here Sunderram seems not to be taking that line|pg||
nt|rv: SS might have chanced 3n because he felt they were trailing and need IMPs|pg||
nt|babs59: and now he has real prospects!|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|offthebend: Laltu in a hurry -- the Club suit may play for few more tricks |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|babs59: not enough entries to establish clubs now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|babs59: so he had to try for 3-2 break|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h7|nt|psyck: Landy for both majors is commonly employed on 1NT openings, some use it in this sequence with agreement|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chilloncan: i wonder why N led the club ace|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hK|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|offthebend: but 3C tricks may have helped -- with 3 D and 3 tricks in the M's ( could not afford to take D finesse later on ) |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
mc|7|nt|babs59: he didn't have 3 clubs tricks if they broke 4-1 though.|pg||
nt|babs59: not unless Laltu split which he wasn't doing|pg||
nt|babs59: that's why he tried the @CK 2nd round of clubs - he needed them 3-2 for 3 club tricks|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|alamiro: 2@D es apoyo 4to a @s y 10-11 ptos|pg||
nt|rv: another flat brd, good for the side in the lead|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|chilloncan: N was worth a raise to 3S after the 4 card drury|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: her partner was 3rd seat, yes, but vulnerable, and N has clearly invitational values|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: cards lay fine here, but once E denied interest after the superacceptance with 4@d...there was no clear reason to crossss 4@s...|pg||
nt|rv: all bids on 1x-1y-2n are transfers (3@s shows @Cs playable upto 5@c)|pg||
pc|d3|mc|11|nt|rv: very popular treatment played by many partnerships in this part of the world|pg||

mb|2D|nt|babs59: but RV, I said that privately :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: open room is playing slow bec of some lighting problems |pg||
nt|rv: thanks to my excellent commentators, Guruji Subhash Gupta and Barbara and insightful comments by all specs|pg||
nt|babs59: and this board doesn't look like Texans can recover IMPs|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|babs59: you'd better not play in the Open Room then Subhash :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: you've mis-seen a few bids tonight!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: excellent job done by Vugraph operator Pramod Samant and good organization by Pradeep and KSBA team and Kiruba and BFI team|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|babs59: and I just expected a flat board|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|chilloncan: this is one of these rare cases where N can use KC with a small doubleton -- S has shown  4342 shape and a c;ub stop, so she has to have the clubs controlled herself, either ace or ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: king|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|alamiro: Que peculiar criterio al momento de abrir esta mano! en manos anteriores abrio de 2@h una mejor mano que esta!, ahora no paso y abrio de 1@D|pg||
nt|rv: momentum clearly with DSM now and they must be favorites to meet Formidables in finals|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|babs59: the preemptive 3@C overcall with negative double endplayed North into 3NT at the other table|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chilloncan: yes, the evaluations do seem inconsistent. but this S hand is an opening bid because:|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: both Souths chose not to look for an 8 card @s fit with a balanced hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chilloncan: 1) the Losing Trick Count is about right     2) there is playability in 3 suits including both majors    3) there is no rebid problem     4) you get to openm a suit you want led|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|rv: for all the neutrals, let us hope Texans mount a fightback in 7th segment|pg||
