nt|sga1: Four session to go, only 8 imps difference, any thing possible.|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari should have exited with @ck on winning @SK in last deal, SS was one 1 down|pg||
nt|rv: all 3 teams in the trials are fairly evenly matched though Formidables have the best form in recent months, I anticipate semis and finals to be very close and go down to the wire|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables have been seeded to finals because they won 2 of the 3main qualifying events for the trials, both Summer and Winter Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: Texans won 3rd qualifying event National Masters with very different quorum of team, hence had to pay 5 lacks as direct entry to participate here|pg||
nt|rv: DSM qualified as runner-up of Summer Nationals|pg||
nt|rv: runner-up of Winter Nationals, Poddar Developers did not field team here because of some internal issues, very sad indeed|pg||
nt|rv: 5 lacks translates to 0.5 million rupees, about 10,000 USD:)|pg||
nt|rv: as per current exchange rate approx 11,000 USD|pg||
nt|rv: we have power failure at the venue, lost internet connectivity which means access to game and for Subhash Gupta to be ungagged|pg||
nt|rv: Formidables represented India the maximum times in last decade or so, they have won BFAME 4 times, reached QFs of Bermuda Bowl twice as well as R16 in Rosenblum during this period|pg||
nt|rv: apologies folks, waiting for power and connectivity to be back|pg||
nt|rv: I am not at the venue, doing commentary from home|pg||
nt|rv: P.Sridhar has won silver and bronze medal as part of Texan Aces in 2 successive European Open tournies, SS was part of team when they won bronze and Sumit was part of team when ...|pg||
nt|rv: they silver|pg||
nt|rv: pls stick around, let me call up folks at venue and check|pg||
nt|rv: power just back|pg||
nt|rv: we should be on in a couple of mins|pg||
nt|rv: they do have power back-up / generator at the venue, surprising it is taking awhile|pg||
nt|rv: according to BFI MPs, Pritish Kushari must be amongst the top 3 or 4 MPs holder in the country, he has earned most of the points as part of all-conquering Indian Railways team|pg||
nt|panja: symmetric North hand in blacks....difficult for W to know the best shift unless E could guid|pg||
nt|panja: guide even|pg||
nt|subhranp: slam board early in the day|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: for nearly a decade from mid-90s, Indian Railways used to have monopoly of all National team events|pg||
nt|panja: light opening...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sarkar_suk: neck to neck fight nice to watch sudhir :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|chilloncan: S should open with that hand|pg||
nt|sga1: How many would open 3@d with that hand vul, literally 9 loser hand. I would not.|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes :)|pg||
nt|rv: great, we are back on and hi again to Subhash Gupta|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|subhranp: 3nt easier here than 4h|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chilloncan: when you dont have spades, you have to get in early or they may make it too awkward for you to compete|pg||
nt|sga1: Doesn't fall into any rule 2-3-4 or not even for aggressive players with 2-3-4-5 rule.|pg||
nt|offthebend: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|alamiro: Excelente Resultado para N-S en la otra sala|pg||
nt|panja: true...with extra strength...and near balanced hands..it is always worthwhile exploring 3N in preference to 4 of a Major|pg||
nt|panja: here though, with all the Aces, North is likely to prefer a @S game|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sarkar_suk: thats a good lead for declarer :)|pg||
nt|sga1: 4 quick tricks for defense.|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: 2n presumably jacoby, 3h probably showing 6carder heart|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sarkar_suk: nw trump shift shd be :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: tightly contested semi final so far and I am sure it is going that way till the end |pg||
nt|rv: I might have bid 2n or 3@h with Sridhar's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: But trump shift can only help if N switches to @d after winning @sK|pg||
nt|sga1: so that 2nd trump can also be removed.|pg||
nt|panja: there was that other issue....did S show 5@S with this bidding? his next bid gives us the answer...NO|pg||
nt|panja: so 4@S, it will be...or will it go further?|pg||
nt|subhranp: could go higher|pg||
nt|panja: BTW Subhran, what is 2@D for you?|pg||
nt|panja: 12+?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|subhranp: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: both 3n and 4@h have excellent play for N-S|pg||
nt|panja: I was wondering whey Keyzad bid 2@D rather than 2@S|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S would have shown 9-10 or so....|pg||
mb|5S|nt|chilloncan: S actually is not even minimum by Losing Trick Count standards, has playabiulity in at least 2 suits, only mild rebid problems, and can open the suit she wants led. all that adds ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: up to a clear opening bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|panja: if he guesses everything right, this could make|pg||
nt|panja: but that is rather unlikely|pg||
nt|panja: on the @CK lead...with correct @S view..there is a red suit squeeze on West|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes right panja..|pg||
nt|subhranp: one can trust keyzad to find those lines|pg||
mb|6H|nt|panja: Williaim Watson suggests that is the only option.....@CKQ must be in, W must hold 5 @D 4!M..so East must hold 4 Spades to make!|pg||
nt|panja: 5@H4@H, that is|pg||
nt|panja: Keyzad could conjure all that up..he is quite capable of thinking of a way to make this|pg||
nt|panja: and E's first @D will tell him W holds 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: now -2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: Sundarram is possibly abs minimum for his double and 2@h especially with modern style of O/Cs till 17/18 hcp|pg||
nt|subhranp: laltu not showing any kings so that should end the auction|pg||
nt|ayan: N-S play 2nt as Natural promising 2 + trump|pg||

nt|rv: Subhash Gupta is affectinately called Guruji (master) in Indian bridge circles:)|pg||
nt|rv: Guruji what would be your recommended auction in last deal?|pg||
nt|subhranp: well..i wouldnt bet against a DSM vs Form final now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|subhranp: interesting board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ayan: Hi Subs, looks like we will have a full house pretty soon|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW have 5D|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sga1: it could be 2@h/3@H depending on whether NS would compete to 3@C or not.|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor sridhar already stretched his 5 points to make a noise|pg||
mb|3D|nt|subhranp: NS are odds on to make 4S here|pg||
nt|ayan: looks like 3 @c is rev bergen |pg||
nt|subhranp: well both Venky and Subhash quiet so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: ok back to this one, Kushari's 2n is jacoby, 4+@h, semibal hand, GF|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sarkar_suk: ofcourse no question of game reach :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|sga1: 2NT here was natural, opening hand.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|subhranp: i think the format of this event this time puts formidables at a bit of disadvantage to start with. they dont have time to settle down|pg||
nt|subhranp: quiet partial this time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sga1: not Jacoby which many prefer.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: Jacoby responses have been tailored a lot by different partnerships, traditionally 3 level bids show stiff and 4 level second 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ayan: Very unlike Guruzi Bid, I must admit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|rv: looks like Kushari-Laltu have their own home-grown method here|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|subhranp: possibly the vulnerability made them keep quiet|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|s3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- I did miss -- PS was forced to bid 2D over the T/O dbl -- in that case , he could take one more bid -- like 2S  over 2H|pg||
nt|subhranp: assuming DSM goes through, they should look to capitalize on the initial rustiness (if any) of Formidables today|pg||
nt|ayan: now Venky may try for the @c J|pg||
nt|subhranp: trump back also should be ok here|pg||
nt|subhranp: if venky backs a trump then declarer should look to setup hearts|pg||

nt|sarkar_suk: 450|pg||
nt|subhranp: since as the match progresses DSM could tire having played longer and Form would begin to get into groove|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rv: that is what I though, another bid either 2@s, 2n or even 3@h|pg||

nt|rv: Pramod, can we adjust the scores here even if we can't watch action on replayed brd?|pg||

nt|vugraphzvz: sure i shall put the score manually after the board 71 is over|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|chilloncan: when playing against opps who use support doubles, there is a reason to bid 2S on the E hand rather than 1S.  a support double typically can be used over 1S but not over 2S|pg||

nt|ayan: Strange pass from Venky|pg||
nt|panja: EW have many tricks in Hearts.....|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rv: many in India play X of strong nt opening as showing 5+m+4M, to be best of my knowledge this NS pair play double as values |pg||
nt|panja: which bid killed the exploration? 1Nt or W's Pass?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sga1: cold with good @C position.|pg||
nt|rv: PS had poor 16 hcp with no good lead and poor intermediates and wisely decided to pass|pg||
nt|subhranp: EW playing a bit of subdued game, they are still warming up..better get onto the pitch very fast|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|subhranp: this should make with cards favourably placed|pg||
nt|panja: with a 55 fit...to guard against !KQx in inside..declarer must finesse first time which Kushari will do by force of habit|pg||

mb|3C|nt|chilloncan: many pairs play two way weak 2s -- 2M is close to an opening bid, and 2D is a truly weak 2 in one majopr|pg||
nt|alamiro: Cuando se abre de preventiva los valores deberian estar concentrados en el palo de apertura, tiene algunos extras laterales|pg||
nt|alamiro: supongo que 3@s es buen palo y buena mano|pg||
nt|alamiro: Norte debe rematar 6nt para proteger su K@d|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for me S has a 1H opener, but even without the 2-tiered weak 2s, there is an ultraconservative school of weak 2s that the S hand fits perfectlt. Matt Granovetter for example uses ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this style, which derives from the dawn of weak 2s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: this looks like Ogust|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: and 2Nt might be too high, even 1Nt might not make on a bad day|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: Guruji will you bid 2@c or 2@S with North hand, I might have tried 2@c|pg||

nt|subhranp: this would be interesting|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panja: and @H Q could get played here..|pg||
nt|panja: because S wants to tackle @D asap|pg||
pc|h8|nt|alamiro: En mi opinion si voy abrir 1 mano de 11 ptos a nivel de 1, es porque tengo un 2do canto sin ninguna dificultad, en este caso Sur pudo abrir de 1@h y luego rematar 2@h y problema ...|pg||
nt|alamiro: resuelto, mano totalmente descrita!|pg||

nt|chilloncan: very surprising for N to pass after a 3S reply to Ogust showing super maximum|pg||
nt|alamiro: Ahora pueden ganar 7 si encuentra la Q@C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: maybe N should have only invited once 2@h was doubled|pg||
nt|panja: W might shift..|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|offthebend: hard to say --- rather play in 6-1 than 4-3 fit with such hands |pg||

pc|d7|nt|panja: it is a toss up between @ST, and @H9...|pg||

nt|panja: right..@H continuation is right...because @ST is seen in the dummy|pg||
nt|subhranp: should be -1|pg||
nt|subhranp: defence should look to get their 4 tricks in red-suits|pg||
nt|subhranp: venkatesh not sure if Keyzad has HA or not and might be considering knocking out HA if Kushari has it|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chilloncan: after all, if N was not going to move towards slam over the strongest rebid that S could make, why on earth bid 2N in the first place?|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|sarkar_suk: :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck: cards lay fine here, but once E denied interest after the superacceptance with 4@d...there was no clear reason to crossss 4@s...|pg||
nt|rv: all bids on 1x-1y-2n are transfers (3@s shows @Cs playable upto 5@c)|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|chilloncan: in general, the players here seem to be bidding as if the form of scoring were matchpoints or Point-a-Board (where the priority is going plus) rather than IMPs which reward games ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and slams|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|sQ|nt|panja: not really..no way..as E had only two @S|pg||

nt|subhranp: NS close to 3n here|pg||

mb|p|nt|babs59: but RV, I said that privately :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: open room is playing slow bec of some lighting problems |pg||
nt|rv: thanks to my excellent commentators, Guruji Subhash Gupta and Barbara and insightful comments by all specs|pg||
nt|babs59: and this board doesn't look like Texans can recover IMPs|pg||
nt|subhranp: i guess 2c is other two suits|pg||
nt|subhranp: last board of SF coming up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: you'd better not play in the Open Room then Subhash :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|babs59: you've mis-seen a few bids tonight!|pg||
nt|subhranp: well played DSM|pg||
nt|subhranp: finals starting tomorrow at 9:30 AM IST|pg||
pc|d8|nt|panja: NS will do well to take out trumps|pg||
nt|subhranp: one spade can be ruffed in dummy and should make|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rv: excellent job done by Vugraph operator Pramod Samant and good organization by Pradeep and KSBA team and Kiruba and BFI team|pg||
nt|offthebend: I would have slept enough tonite to keep my eyes wide awake  :)|pg||
nt|panja: good lead|pg||
nt|subhranp: texans couldnt make 4h on B97 so lead has widened again|pg||
nt|panja: this could go two down now..as W will play @D to K first time..., likely|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|rv: is this right?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sarkar_suk: last deal of this set :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|rv: could be another swing for DSM here|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|panja: seems this will be nine tricks..not 11 or 10 as GIB would like us to believe|pg||
pc|sK|nt|subhranp: Formidables directly seeded to Finals|pg||
pc|s9|nt|panja: but EW can make 11...by using three entries in Dummy to play @S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|babs59: and I just expected a flat board|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chilloncan: this is one of these rare cases where N can use KC with a small doubleton -- S has shown  4342 shape and a c;ub stop, so she has to have the clubs controlled herself, either ace or ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: king|pg||
nt|panja: interesting..that seemed cold|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|alamiro: Que peculiar criterio al momento de abrir esta mano! en manos anteriores abrio de 2@h una mejor mano que esta!, ahora no paso y abrio de 1@D|pg||
nt|rv: momentum clearly with DSM now and they must be favorites to meet Formidables in finals|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|panja: playing @HT to K, @H9 to Q and then @H5 to 8..that was the way to make 11...crazy double dummy way|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|panja: even 93 for that matter|pg||
pc|s6|nt|babs59: the preemptive 3@C overcall with negative double endplayed North into 3NT at the other table|pg||

nt|chilloncan: yes, the evaluations do seem inconsistent. but this S hand is an opening bid because:|pg||

nt|psyck: both Souths chose not to look for an 8 card @s fit with a balanced hand|pg||

pc|c9|nt|chilloncan: 1) the Losing Trick Count is about right     2) there is playability in 3 suits including both majors    3) there is no rebid problem     4) you get to openm a suit you want led|pg||
