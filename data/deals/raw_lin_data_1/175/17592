mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And you need not be a brain surgeon to figure out which three pairs she will select|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: Uggeri is 4th for now and Sabbatini 5th|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Now that Fantunes play for Monaco|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: right, I suppose there are three pairs that stand out ... despite the showing here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: For kibs, Bocchi - Madala, Duboin - Sementa, Lauria - Versace (if I'm wrong, I need to take up brain surgery)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|psridhar: right away Berti faced with a decision over 3N- running @d as source of tricks may hv persuaded him to settle for3nt but no|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well, therefore it is very interesting that Team Lavazza, winners of last weeks Yeh Bros, are trailing here by 40+ vips|pg||
nt|imp_jan: morning btw|pg||

pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: what does the jury say about this auction?  Do we shoot North or South?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bardin was evidently tempted by those 3 aces but he shd hv asked himself why pd didnt blackwood if he wanted them|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems Bardin has the same attitude as one of my (ex) partners = you wont let me play 3NT? we dont play 5m ever!|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c2|nt|psridhar: can escape d1 if he can find the squeeze|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Source of tricks, partner with just 2 hearts, what on earth was the problem?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: running scores at  http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I have a smidgeon of sympathy for 6@D, but not much|pg||

nt|ianmcc: except grey hair|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: haha|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one is 20-20 game a stretch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a keep out of trouble hand to start with|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi John :) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may need these,  since this is "not standard" |pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a horrible bunch of misfits - not us - the hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be us also LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if all stay low |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would open N hand  |pg||
nt|sybarra: ak, a|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strong club for N-S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Daniela|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Bob, Bill and Andy|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Good evening |pg||
nt|psyck: we have the 2nd & 3rd place teams here: http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: 5@d on EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I enjoyed watching Braithwaite & Richman|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Precision a la Angelini|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45: N/S can make a very lucky 3 NT here, but hardly bid it|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S or 5@D |pg||
mb|2D|nt|woozle: 4H is fair (but down)...vulnerable I'd definitely want to be there|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: can NS really make 3nt? how do they get to dummy to finesse diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT would be my (bad resulting) bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is -1, but I think they will take a sacrifie - which will make|pg||
nt|rv: Please access http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html for running scores|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen might very reasonably drive to game here, particularly considering the hands that this pair haven't overcalled|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now what?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be played doubled? |pg||
nt|psyck: 1N=@c or puppet to @c i guess|pg||
nt|athene: maybe in spades, given time :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: @S Jack is the entry|pg||
nt|hawe45: - but I said: VERY lucky|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt might be some either/or bid - those are sort of the norm after strong club|pg||
nt|athene: so clubs or something else, maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning all|pg||
nt|bobholl: typical screen wait :)|pg||
nt|psyck: @d's put to sleep|pg||
nt|rv: huge surprise Lavazza out of contention|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobholl: strong enough for one try ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning - and it is another sunny morning in dublin - can we take all this good weather|pg||
nt|rv: yes sunny in Dublin and wet in Bangalore good for resp regions:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: source of tricks very scarc e here|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 @D should end the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, could be a suction variant with @c or red suits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and getting scarcer|pg||
nt|sybarra: was typing,  "not sure this is success either"|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 @D is jumping into fire |pg||
nt|sybarra: (out of frying pan)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: best to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ not an entry for trump finesse playing in diamonds :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  may not have to try anymore|pg||
nt|bobholl: double all pass :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Will be defeated - with the @S-ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45: - not any longer|pg||
nt|athene: now he can just play ace and a diamond, lose @SAK, @DK, @CA|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and its "good luck pard" with a smile |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like 1 down with 5@d cold!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Henry!|pg||
nt|henryb:  I wonder why West did not raise diamonds|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s lead?|pg||
nt|rv: East won't find inspired @SJ lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4S bid is very loose, and possibly down more than one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: rescue|pg||
nt|woozle: Likely phantom|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would you?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Fabio Carugati|pg||
nt|rv: on this auction, there is case for leading @sj instead of @C since you have no entry and best to lead partner's suit|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Fabio, I will seriously consider @SJ lead|pg||
nt|caruga: hi all, the weather is not so good here in Northern Italy....let's hope|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I certainly would since no suggestion declarer or responder have spades|pg||
nt|rv: did the weather affect Lavazza?|pg||
nt|caruga: is possible :)|pg||
nt|rv: now declarer can make this contract by playing @HJ and rising with @CA if West wins and continues @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how about kibs any spade leaders out there|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|athene: only way the contract might go down is spade shift and then try to ruff a club|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: right John!  this can not be worse  (only 50's) |pg||
nt|psyck: S will have to provide an entry to dec hand for @c fin|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rv: it is easier for East to lead a @s from shortness here since partner has most of values and odds on to hold 4+@s|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: then @DK overruff, @S ruff|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sometimes I think dbl is used very bad instead of supporting|pg||
nt|caruga: Paolo Uggeri is a very imaginative player but the first board in rama......|pg||
nt|rv: now 1 down again|pg||
pc|hK|nt|woozle: diamond, diamond ruff, club, diamond ruff, club or heart to come (if the defense don't cash the HA the heart runs away...if they do, two clubs run away)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|andyv:  2@s very limited in range...3-7 hcp which may be reason for lack of try by S...W's balance will not meet with teammate approval|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: playing 4@C no risk on card play playing for 10 tricks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: S can not find his parner entry for a ruff but might try it |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: claim  for 10 not 11 should be |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: but fall of @CQ ought to change declarer's mind|pg||
nt|rv: Franchi did have a tough play problem even on favorable @c lead, to play for either @SK right or hope for right @HT guess and 4-4 @cs|pg||
nt|granguru: hi |pg||
nt|rv: he didn't take a very unreasonable line |pg||
nt|rv: Hi John|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to John Plaut|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not pressure w|pg||
nt|granguru: namaste|pg||
nt|caruga: hi, ciao|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: ace and a diamond completely safe now|pg||
nt|hawe45: North will hardly ruff @C - seeing the @C Queen coming down |pg||
pc|c6|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|woozle: Good hand to show off the law - EW make 9 tricks in their nine card fit, NS make8 tricks in their eight card fit. If 4H was making, 4S would be -500|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @hA what else?|pg||
nt|athene: no way anyone can win the @DK and give his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: well|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|athene: if he had cashed the @CK and seen the queen fall, yes|pg||
nt|granguru: ciao Fabio|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: I think we call these kind of hand "buzz sawa" |pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: but the way it went it was not so obvious that the @CQ was stiff|pg||
nt|athene: but still|pg||
nt|athene: ace and a diamond was 100% to make 3@D at that point|pg||
nt|hawe45: This will not be the best played hand of the tournament|pg||
nt|athene: definitely very bad play|pg||
nt|athene: i guess "first board syndrome"|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north thought that west had the clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: All beginning is difficult|pg||
nt|athene: since west bid them|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: maybe he did not check what 1nt meant|pg||
nt|jcomyn: might as well find out about chilean weather|pg||
mc|8|nt|sybarra: *buzz saws"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: get out fast before you lose your head|pg||
nt|bobholl: a of @C claim|pg||
nt|granguru: nice weather here|pg||
pg||

nt|hedyg: and that on a friendly @c lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: @C lead = 8th trick and the 9 th was always going to be elusive in that layout |pg||
mb|1C|nt|bjacobs: He could have hooked successfully for @H10, but reasonably chose the spade finesse instead|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The heart finesse needed clubs 4-4 as well ... I think declarer played it correctly|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: What does West's 2nd pass mean here?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's what East is wondering, I bet|pg||
nt|psridhar: @h fin may succeed when E has ace of king of @h in adddn to the 10-decl had the 9 spot in club|pg||
nt|psridhar: ace or king|pg||
nt|hedyg: to bid 2@c?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@s useless since pd surely does not have 4@ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: well ew are a long standing pship, probably they know what the second pass means|pg||
nt|hedyg: or not?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: If they intended it as "neutral", then it's all fine ... you see this auction|pg||
nt|hedyg: here it just means 1@dX= 9 is not game|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well hedy u have to bid something dont u?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But many would play that second pass as "I want to play 1@DXX", in which case E/W are in a pickle|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would rebid @cs, he might well be 4 4 4 1 for his double and his pd surely has no major|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think I would have been defending 1@DXX on this hand ...|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: I think over the XX also,W shd bid what he wd hv if S passed the X --his pass shd encourage defending 1D XX  |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psridhar: of course E is not barred from bidding over the XX|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: Agreed ... but what is the bid (other than pass) over 1@C - 1@D - P - P - X - P|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|s9|nt|bjacobs: What would you do?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd bid 1@h|pg||
nt|psridhar: cheapest escape|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: Fair enough, in which case, to be consistent West would have to bid 1@H after the redouble, and there you are in a 3-3 fit|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h7|nt|hedyg: i think pass is fine, i surely do not want to play anything else and 1@d X making or even with overtricks is not the end of the world|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a really tough hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|h2|pc|s6|pg||
mc|8|nt|psridhar: why shd the XX alter the odds of my prospects in 1@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: anyway i was headed there|pg||
pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4SKQJHKQ6DAJT97C83,S843HT75DK8542C76,ST92H9832DQ3CJT92,SA765HAJ4D6CAKQ54|sv|n|nt|kiwibridge: in the context of the match a huge plus|pg||
nt|woozle: On a good, day, 4H NS might make ten tricks. This is not a good day.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec points out that East's low @d was spot on|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: first board and last board are the killers for keeping concentration|pg||
nt|athene: the ones in between, they are hard too|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  -800 usually not what you expect when opps are not in game|pg||
nt|athene: i think that possibly east should bid 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: the point being it's very likely his partner might balance disastrously|pg||
nt|athene: east is a passed hand - how bad can 3@C be?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is just with benefit of hindsight|pg||
nt|andyv:  but in imps, is there a reason for W to balance?|pg||
nt|andyv:  poor quality suit, and, except for 6th @h, the hand is balanced|pg||
nt|athene: well the hand does go to prove one point which is that just because opps have stopped low, doesn't mean it's safe to come in|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, the severity was pretty extreme|pg||
nt|psyck: unlikely S would try pd entry with all hcp marked though|pg||
nt|rv: early summer rains have really cooled temperature here in Bangalore|pg||
nt|Walddk4: running scores at  http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|granguru: end april time is like ending the summer...not so cold not so warm...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: fantoni nunes defended better as usual in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so -2!|pg||
nt|athene: but still should have been a much bigger swing|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D was cold|pg||
nt|athene: it's almost always safer to act aggressively earlier rather than pass and back in|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a rather easy 4@h on EW|pg||
nt|henryb:  good thing E-W missing 2 aces. otherwise W might drive to a no-play slam|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: dealer having fun today?|pg||
nt|athene: at the point he won the second club|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 NT better be played by East - only @D-lead brings trouble|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|sybarra: 1 @S denies 4 sp |pg||
nt|athene: but that was a particularly tough one |pg||
nt|psyck: no problems in 4@h with trump breaking if they can get there|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi Kristina have we got our vugrapher around to ask for any doubts?|pg||
nt|psyck: I don't know, we can try :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi all.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi Jeff|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Jeff|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi again Krishna:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a good 4@H contract |pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: heading for trouble|pg||
nt|caruga: is this a strong club?|pg||
nt|rv: Cossu's pass says I want to play here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: 1@C is natural (ish) and 14+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: West not worth 2 bids|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so 1NT shows 4 s then?|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me look for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: hitting the deck again? |pg||
nt|athene: 2@S just a natural game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: he knows E opened 1 @C a "good hand" |pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead and heart back, ducked|pg||
nt|athene: if NS find that you call the director|pg||
nt|hawe45: and the police|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@D control & slam prop that N will decline |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H end |pg||
nt|fann4: Not good to have North playing it.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10 tricks could be claim soon after 2 round @H |pg||
nt|rv: I play pass here by West says I want to play in 1@d XX|pg||
nt|granguru: thats the top level meaning|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: I'm told 3@c was transfer last deal, that makes sense|pg||
nt|psyck: Common to play transfers after intervention|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H = 2/2 help to make contract easy |pg||
nt|caruga: me too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me three|pg||
nt|granguru: :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: they play transfer responses so 1@S response would be limited with no major|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt stronger than 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|athene: basically if anyone has not seen NS before, they play an unusual system|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a fast claim I hope|pg||
nt|rv: Uggeri-Cossu possibly play it differently|pg||
nt|granguru: I must confess that I agree with it but at the table I use my instinct|pg||
nt|rv: why not lead @sK?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ianmcc: the vul got him|pg||
nt|athene: fairly strong, forcing 1 level bids|pg||
nt|athene: 14+ or thereabouts|pg||
nt|athene: weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: 2-level bids are 10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that @d suit is never mentioned.|pg||
nt|athene: so after the 1-level openers, responder can force to game on ten counts|pg||
nt|athene: and they can set up a game force quickly and often|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessed east would lead red but this is better|pg||
nt|athene: normally you would prefer to have the lead running up to a strong notrump rather than through it|pg||
nt|athene: but here the red tenaces are protected at least|pg||
nt|bobholl: will be so !|pg||
nt|henryb:  At my local club :) there would be two pairs in 5@h and at least one in a partial|pg||
nt|henryb:  also, probably, one in 3N|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: good spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades might have been @D,  I am still chedking |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm all for supporting with support, but West's 4D looks excessive with the secondary misfit|pg||
nt|athene: worth pointing out that if north at any points found the @H7 lead(and south had not led the suit) and declarer plays the king, south has to duck|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see 52 cards the 8 is so obvious :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcomyn: good question|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: very common to duck the first round if you have AJx(xx) over KQx|pg||
nt|athene: keep communications open|pg||
nt|rv: when God has give you KQJ, you lead it:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ianmcc: this could make to min the loss|pg||
nt|hawe45: 9 tricks without the @S-guess|pg||
nt|athene: you wait for partner to get in again and everything is happy|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hawe45: South thinking - telling: I do NOT have the @D Ace...|pg||
nt|athene: what is south thinking about? his partner can't have @HQ left can he?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i second that|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: right|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||

nt|bjacobs: In fact, he doesn't have to guess it, unless West ruffs anyway!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psridhar: he will of course :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: 5@h NO PROBLEM THANKS TO @d t |pg||
nt|psyck: W's sequence on deal 1 was likely game forcing, E may have forgotten|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Fantunes playing for Angelini, Lauria-Versace playing for which team? I don't see Zaleski in list of teams...|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: missing DK will hardly bid 7|pg||
nt|hawe45: With N/S bidding the 3 other suits, West will find the @C-lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: their "strong" weak twos often score well (especially against the dutch:)) |pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 1, in OR, 4@h was played by N|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so this north hand is a game force for Fantoni i am sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on NS?|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@S obviously weak |pg||
nt|granguru: and 2 obvious passes|pg||
nt|rv: quick pass by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 1@s followed by 3@h would be normal by N|pg||
mb|d|nt|woozle: This time EW might reasonably attempt 5D|pg||
nt|athene: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: north is intending to just show a heart raise so not bothering with the spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 1nt on N even if only 14|pg||
nt|bobholl: won't bid it if he doesn't guess to bid 1 nt now (too ligth imo)|pg||
nt|granguru: what should E do?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|woozle: Buchen's 2D overcall a little ugly with only a five card suit, but the excellent hand and unsuitability of every other call justify it|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie, unfortunately, doesn't know what a vul v not 2-level overcall looks like|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd sooner bid 5D than pass|pg||

nt|athene: usually you do that with a game force which i don't think north really has|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi Povl,  welcome |pg||

pc|s2|nt|ianmcc: a bold X pls don't convert|pg||
nt|sybarra: N will make a slam try with 4 @d |pg||
nt|rv: L-V playing for Sbarigia, Roma|pg||
nt|granguru: 3@H would have been  a disaster|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Zaleski not fielding team since foreigners not allowed in this event|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|sybarra: 4 @S |pg||
nt|sommer: ..and they should be there|pg||
nt|athene: so, a spade lead and a club loser goes away|pg||
nt|hawe45: 2 @S for the lead???|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|woozle: Buchen steps out a little with a reopening double, diagnosing the short hearts opposite. Christie still thinks that he has a balanced yarborough and just returns to diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: N was too strong for his action after all :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: This cuts communication a little|pg||
nt|athene: ok now declarer can't get to dummy for a pitch on the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: sensible lead|pg||
nt|athene: lead the singleton with a weak hand|pg||
nt|psyck: @h will be entry later|pg||
nt|hawe45: Listen folks - does 2 @S mean: Lead what you like?|pg||
nt|athene: Garozzo said "if you don't lead your singleton, pd shld assume u don't have one"|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 aces away and claim |pg||
nt|henryb:  they might beat this enough to compensate for the game!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sommer: 4@S.. now|pg||
nt|sybarra: up the line cues I guess |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: danger hand with @D 5/0 Q@S off side & a @H looser |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|athene: that doesn't quite mean "always lead your singleton" as people sometimes say|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: but it is fairly close :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Still 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|bobholl: wasn't it the Q he led ?|pg||

pc|hK|pc|d7|pc|h7|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now 11½|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe he took the pitch earlier|pg||
nt|granguru: why is garozzo playing then?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|hawe45: Even if East ducks the first @H, still 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: east covers in case his pd has @H109x or something|pg||
nt|caruga: foreign players are allowed|pg||

nt|hawe45: OK - that´s better|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|granguru: Hamaoui is from venezuela but also italian|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|woozle: I shouldn't be so harsh - Christie couldn't have known that he had four trumps, a king and a key singleton|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that is being harsh|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is NS play 2@C as natural or a 3-card limit raise |pg||
nt|athene: quite common idea so you can stop at the 2-level when partner has a really bad hand|pg||

nt|woozle: EW can put on some pressure by bidding to 5C here, which needs hearts led at trick one or two to beat it|pg||

nt|sommer: 4@S is a good sac against 4@H here|pg||
nt|hawe45: Only game here is 3 @D doubled|pg||

nt|athene: (10-13, unbalanced, 5+@D)|pg||

nt|granguru: 4@S by NS will be an easy task|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|woozle: but if the defense never break diamonds, a one-suit squeeze on east will work|pg||
nt|caruga: do you all bid with N?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D interesting - sometimes you have to open 1@D with various "loose" hands in a strong club system|pg||
nt|athene: but usually with 6 clubs you can open 2@C!|pg||
nt|athene: maybe their 2@C opener denies a 4 card major|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sommer: 2@S may be 2 controls|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt think sacrifice now|pg||
nt|sommer: nope..very passive by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i really must hunt out a CC for NS :) then i could actually stop just guessing haha|pg||
nt|psyck: Papi has been practicing with N quite a bit on BBO recently, you can catch him with the id sillafu here often|pg||
nt|fann4: Clearly 1@S would not have been forcing by S here.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not bad hands for a start for Benito 16/18/17/19 in 4 hands :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s might now go overboard|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: Bridggida, the goddess of Bridge, clearly favors him :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Usually, in a strong @c system, it is the long relays we cannot make sense of, here even their natual bids are unnatural :(|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D is always a bit of an amorphous blob in 5-card major strong 1@C systems|pg||
nt|athene: just not usually this sort of blob :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't know their system (yet) but looks like strong club with conventional answers |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sommer: got a chance there too, to X|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|woozle: Perhaps not. My imagination is getting ahead of me. East will be endplayed if he comes down to KJT of diamonds, but if he keeps the 6 and ditches a minor honour then West's diamond ...|pg||
nt|woozle: pips will save him|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i dont like this style of bidding with this kind of shape|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D making N 3Nt only by S|pg||
nt|fann4: maybe heading to 3N by S, if N bids 3@H now.|pg||
nt|granguru: if @D forces N to a new bid 4@S can be reached|pg||
nt|granguru: ditto|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: we can just ignore the 1st round of bids & it looks fine though...|pg||
nt|hawe45: With an easy @H-guess, East can make 4 @D - if N/S do not find the @H-ruff|pg||
nt|athene: i assumed it was just 1@C natural, 1@H transfer, 1nt natural, new minor forcing|pg||
nt|granguru: good bid by Montanari|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know tha ditto system|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is tak 'em or dont get 'em |pg||
nt|athene: not trivial perhaps to bid 3@D with east |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT much better than 4@S @C lead and swiftly 1 down |pg||
nt|fann4: Down a lot if the @DK offside - 5@D much better|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: only in nt |pg||
nt|sommer: sry..I'm told, E showed 5c@H|pg||
nt|athene: might feel he is just hanging partner for a good balancing action|pg||
nt|psyck: E was afraid of crucifying pd for balancing|pg||
nt|athene: also he might just assume that north has implied some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: since usually you will do if you open 1@D and rebid clubs, even if you might have longer clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: I also have to sleep some time, this contract is a 2-minut-one...!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://bridgetopics.com/news/2011/apr/fantunes-and-garozzo-play-angelini-salsomaggiore is about this match|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d looks like xfer to @hs, otherwise 3N doesn't make sense with E hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be used to poor overcalls|pg||
nt|granguru: I am also not accustomed to bid suits like N, but it is a good strategy to enter over 1 in a minor  with such type of semisolid suits|pg||
nt|caruga: NS are very good and very young players|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i'm told that 1@D generally promises a 4-card major in the NS methods, so 2@C showed 4 spades|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: i was wondering why he ignored the spades, but if he has implied them, that is ok :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems they are heding to a good 5@D|pg||
nt|granguru: because it is around 50% chance that NT might be bid by 3rd hand so defense wins a critical tempo if the lead is in the mentioned suit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well if my pard overcalled vul I wont stop in 4s|pg||
nt|granguru: by passing the chances that partner leads another suit are overwhelming|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sommer: ..the 3@C did|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H lead expected |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|woozle: It would all work if the D8 was in North|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|psridhar: nothing wrong with o/c if u can later persuade pd to play 1N on KQXX,X,KQXX,KQXX|pg||
mb|3D!|an|not strong|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I can't, and of course the light overcall can come unstuck.  But it is important that the partnership is in tune, if light one-level overcalls are made|pg||
nt|hedyg: no idea why 3@d is alerted|pg||
nt|psridhar: true-partnership agrrement and ability to handle the combined values is the key |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcp: Berti said: not strong, if strong he bids 2@h even without hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told it shows 14-16|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Ba :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so they play Garozzo style false reverses with strong hands|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even so, South will be thinking about slam.  What about a 4@D bid here?|pg||
nt|ritong: richie reisig plays gazzilli after 1@d, a safe bet would be benito taught him that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem is that North's hand is actually very strong|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6@d makes and gud slam as well|pg||

nt|bjacobs: There's a system point worth noting here.  The auction 1@D-1major-3@D-4@D ... 4@D is not invitational to game, it'|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: it sets diamonds for a possible slam try|pg||

nt|hedyg: after trump setting and cuebid 4NT= even nr of aces ( 0 is an even number) any higher bid is cue and odd number|pg||

nt|fann4: Certainly a big swing possibility. West may not open in the other room or declarer may still take the @D finesse.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 2..sry|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H or 3@S the limit but ???|pg||
nt|granguru: fit is what its all this game about|pg||
nt|caruga: isn't easy|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|psyck: x wide ranging opp a nebulous opening|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the double of 1@D just says "i am doubling whatever minor he has for takeout " :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will they miss @H now ?|pg||
nt|athene: many people bid 1@S with that west sort of hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@s from S?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: these nebulous minor openers cause a whole lot of interesting problems for both sides|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you see it a lot more with short 1@C openers|pg||
nt|hawe45: In fact, best game is 3 NT - with @S 5-1, 4 @H might be a looser|pg||
nt|athene: but they they are stuck when the bidding comes back to them in 4@H or something|pg||
nt|athene: they have to bid 5@C and now partner can't go back to 4@S if he wants to|pg||
nt|athene: much more descriptive to bid clubs first then spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @C lead 4@S migth make|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes match can get closer |pg||
nt|jcomyn: especially as s d are pretty scruffy|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: could be lively auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: and some were worried about missing 7,  John and I were both chickens  and happy to be in 6 |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: right pair of chickens we are shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: that ok |pg||
nt|bobholl: now N has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that nunes splinters for hearts with no more than a minimum opener (in their style)|pg||
nt|athene: the italians generally lay great stress on showing the shape in competition like this |pg||
nt|bobholl: will bid 5@D now i guess|pg||
nt|athene: two small in clubs looks very bad from north's point of view - but not if you know partner has a singleton :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but may be not strong enough sure :)|pg||
nt|athene: will west lightner double hearts?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would force NS to find the better spot in @hs|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: over 900 watching this match now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 8 to go after this one|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: at the end of the last hand Buchen just showed his kj10x @d to Smolanko, and they both agreed 1 off|pg||
nt|hawe45: I think is says "nolo comprendo" - or so - in Italian. What could 3 @C mean???|pg||
nt|athene: @C2 lead now maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nunes should convert this|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry|pg||
nt|bobholl: has to underlead in @C to deafeat 5@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4H almost looks like an underbid, but if you're going to stop low, that North hand won't disappoint|pg||
nt|sybarra: wtih no apologies to mates :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: not any more|pg||
nt|fann4: 1NT probably 18-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: no chance|pg||
nt|psyck: can set up an extra @s trick as cards are to get home|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: J@D lead or 10@D with agreement |pg||
nt|jcomyn: can hardly bid on now|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rv: back, sry had conn problems|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@H now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not much point west underleading since he is on lead against diamonds not hearts :)|pg||
nt|athene: east might deduce the diamond void from the auction|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: i donno what 4@c is either|pg||
nt|athene: but a diamond lead could be wrong in many ways - if partner doesn't ruff you just gave a vital tempo away|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 5@H is made|pg||
nt|andyv:  he'll deduce it now but it's too late|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but no entry in parner to make damagge |pg||
nt|psyck: actully not, cannot afford it now|pg||
nt|granguru: if it is a cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: but can endplay S |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  you are right...no reason not to try|pg||
nt|granguru: 6 reached|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well on the way now|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: of course, "Normally", you only lightner double at the slam level|pg||
nt|bobholl: not the ace :)|pg||
nt|athene: but there are other times when perhaps it might apply|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that it does interfere with when you just want to double for penalty because opps are saccing|pg||
nt|andyv:  in imps, I think E had enough to go on to try a @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: so you can only really use it when you are known from the previous auction not to be strong enough to need to double just to protect your equity on the deal|pg||
nt|andyv:  and question for W was whether to bid on, to dbl for lead direction, or to pass....this time pass looks costly|pg||
nt|bobholl: he didn't know for sure his P had @C Q|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: A@C in N -1 |pg||
nt|psyck: @c doubleton sees him home too|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|bobholl: and may be someone has no @C|pg||
nt|granguru: Merit for Franchi|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@D is a VERY though bid to make at the table|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree we see so few minor slams these days|pg||
nt|caruga: agree|pg||
mb|6D|nt|sommer: closer to 8 than to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: on spot 9 make |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: yes, tough to get to this slam, if I had @DQ or @DT in Franchi's hand, I might have bid 3@d on 2@c to set suit with an extra card than min |pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|woozle: ducking the opening heart lead is leaving Smolanko poorly placed - it's hard to see him going down if he rises with the ace and knocks out the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just pitch|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ill tell him|pg||

nt|Vugraphzcp: they are saying he always makes 7 on @H@S squeeze|pg||

mb|1H|nt|athene: would she know how to bid it in Angelini's system though? :)|pg||
nt|athene: "i'm not opening 1@D with 1 diamond and six clubs!"|pg||
nt|athene: quite right too|pg||
nt|granguru: 6@H depends on the @SK position|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: S had a chance to find 5@C by bidding 2@C....|pg||
nt|hawe45: She would bid 1 @H - 3 @H - 4 @H - all alerted|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H "hearts"|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H "hearts"|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H "game"|pg||

nt|rv: need @s 3-3 or honor doubleton inside, poor slam|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|woozle: Someone asked about a low spade instead of the queen. That's complex, and I think that Smolanko would have had to find the weird play of the jack from dummy to make|pg||

nt|jcomyn: anyone open in s|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: NO|pg||

nt|hawe45: I´am proud of the fact, that I do´nt understand one single of these bids|pg||
nt|athene: so it looks like some sort of suction|pg||
nt|athene: probably showing the next suit up or some other 2 suiter|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe just simple transfers but that is a little passé surely|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo east in 4@S here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but if they are too sophisticated they'l discover missing @D Q|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: having an actual anchor suit! that's bordering on natural bidding|pg||

nt|ianmcc: I have a spec says it's off|pg||
nt|sommer: Bocchi/Madala bid the 6@D too..of course|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs (lauria versace i think) play for example that 1nt - 2@H double is takeout of spades|pg||
nt|hawe45: One looser in each suit, seems correct|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H being a transfer i mean|pg||
nt|athene: EW might well try 5minor|pg||
nt|athene: east surely isn't passing anything but a pure penalty double?|pg||
nt|athene: @SA lead against 5@C would be unfortunate perhaps|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C wasn't exactly best in trick 2|pg||

nt|fann4: more likely 1NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they bid this one|pg||
nt|rv: on brd 21, even on 2@c Franchi would have considered 3@d, chose to bid 2@d and subsequently changed his mind and bid 4@d |pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: and then lead the @DQ forcing west to ruff with a trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: tap tap|pg||

nt|athene: giving declarer a pitch for a diamond - then if he can ruff two hearts he can make|pg||

nt|athene: ("bid to the level of your fit")|pg||

nt|athene: i predict 5@C from east now|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of situation where it's much better to have screens|pg||

nt|psyck: likely stop here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..he felt maybe too strong for jump to 4@S??|pg||
nt|athene: at club level, it only takes a slight variation in tempo|pg||
nt|athene: for west to double fast with a trump trick and slightly slower with values outside spades|pg||
nt|athene: and E knows when to leave and when to pull :)|pg||
nt|athene: i see so many pairs doing this and they might not even realise it is dodgy :)|pg||
nt|athene: decent suit texture|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: even over 1@s pas he has no good bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Smolanko's raise to 2H inadequate - that's what he would bid with a balanced minimum, and this hand is anything but|pg||

pc|c2|nt|woozle: 3H initially should incite Anderson to bid game, diagnosing the short diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|woozle: Still, making 3 or 4 will be worth 1-2 imps, potentially vlauable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree peter. I cannot see any reason for 2@c|pg||
nt|pelu: @DQ is the 100% normal lead - but - again - a trump would have worked better|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: taking a long time to find that big s fit|pg||
nt|athene: now the problem is if declarer uses the @DA to lead a heart up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, it was certainly an uncomfortable lead situation for S|pg||
nt|fann4: Many would just pass 1N, on the basis that pard is likely to have some @C, having skipped both majors.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and this slam isn't good...but it makes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no chance on a bad day, but this isn't one of those|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|athene: NS would open 1@C with any balanced hand i think|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|woozle: Klinger's "raise" to 2H in the other room just as bad, but then he compounded it by defending 3D|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: agree again, but @c10 can solve the trumph suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: but can't west have akxxxx ax x xxx thats enough for 4@S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: so they can use the 1nt rebid artificially|pg||
nt|bobholl: a@S 2@C and a@D to loose|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: no good|pg||

pc|h5|nt|pelu: S can expect @Cs 5-3 and 4 by pd - and C10 will stop some cross_ruffs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|athene: he doesn't expect the @HA to be onside|pg||

pc|h8|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|hJ|nt|hawe45: Expensive now|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: see the pint half empty in the other room|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fann4: On bd 6 in the OR, N very conservatively passed 2@H (here N jumped straight to 4@H), so a missed game for MIR|pg||
pc|s3|nt|woozle: Klinger seems to be toying with a 54321 point count...armed with that method, the North hand is just average in high cards (15)|pg||
nt|andyv:  can S strip the read suits and duck a @s to E hand?|pg||

nt|pelu: 3@h would be my bid|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|andyv:  will be interesting if they get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east knows he wants to sac in 4@S over 4@H and perhaps is trying a sort of semi-psychic bid suggesting a strong raise|pg||
nt|athene: in the hope of not getting doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: I've looked in vain in the bidding boxes|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: welcome Ralf |pg||
pc|h6|nt|woozle: 3NT will certainly be reached...Brown will be happy for a certainly flat board...Klinger won't be|pg||
nt|bobholl: but should go down|pg||
nt|fann4: This is not a particularly great slam, but EW could climb quite high here.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if they try to go to 6@H |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d either nmf or some kind of GF checkback|pg||
nt|granguru: Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina was 13 when she came to play to Chile a junior tourney...we saw she would be a world champion sooner or later...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sommer: 2@D may be GF relais (stronger than 2@C)|pg||
nt|sommer: "double check-back|pg||
nt|athene: 5-level is wrong yet again|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobholl: on a @S lead it makes but on @D ??|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks a little pushy, especially NV|pg||
nt|athene: but he has all four tens|pg||
nt|athene: and all four are potentially working very hard|pg||
nt|athene: for example give partner @HJxx on a  heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: and the @H10 saves your skin|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|psyck: Uggeri will finally get on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead might be worst for N|pg||
nt|andyv:  S|pg||
nt|athene: sadly partner doesn't have @HJxx :)|pg||
nt|rv: E-W should make 8 tricks here, N-S could have competed in either black suit for only 1 down|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: It´s a long way... Why not a direct 4@h after the rebid 1nt from W?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 3 nt will be ok |pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H made in other room on previous hand so angelini loses|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good stop |pg||
nt|fann4: On bd 7 in the OR, NS amazingly reached the cold 3N.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: as the cards lay down|pg||
nt|fann4: 22 high card points between them, no particularly long suits and it's cold.|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: lets see if other team go & make as spec tell me 12 is cold on a squeeze |pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: or hope for a minor suit squeeze now|pg||
nt|andyv:  after cashing @hs, @d switch should set this|pg||

mb|2D|nt|athene: hard-ish for north to find the @DA|pg||

nt|athene: on a spade lead |pg||
nt|bobholl: aq or 9 of @D ?|pg||
nt|athene: of course there is risk in this bid especially as partner will tend not to have four hearts (no negative double)|pg||
nt|andyv:  3NT a bit myopic (as well as where is the @h stopper?)|pg||
nt|athene: but it looks reasonable enough|pg||
nt|athene: if the play with KJxx in opp's suit doesn't bid notrumps who is going to?|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|woozle: Anderson bids his spades...with 4162 or 4072 it would be more tempting to respond 1NT (to give a chance of bidding diamonds later) but this hand can pass a 2C rebid in comfort|pg||

nt|bobholl: now he sees he has missed 6@C despite the bad @D points|pg||
nt|andyv:  old fashioned here Bill, I'd like a better stopper in unbid suit than the stiff 9 of @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: A club looks more ordinary, but maybe he fancied his chances of catching dummy with 4531.|pg||

nt|sommer: I would for sure bid 5@C...but thats me:)|pg||

pc|h2|nt|psyck: can only throw 2@h & 3@c, & squeezed on 5th @d itself in 3 suits|pg||

nt|sommer: wd|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wrong again jeepers|pg||
nt|sommer: ..for an overtrick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This is a typical hand where you should play 6@h because of ruffing @c with the short trumphlength|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also han play 7@h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very interesting to see what happens in open room|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Well, I like this auction.  I particular like North's pass of 2@S, which I think was an excellent tactical bid|pg||

nt|woozle: This could be the opportunity that Klinger crave|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone suggest how he got that right|pg||
nt|athene: maybe mina asked himself "what would one of those famous old-fashioned players like garozzo do in this situation?"|pg||
nt|andyv:  did W hand have to be that good?  could W have bid 3@c on Qx, Kxx, x, AKJxxxx?|pg||

nt|bobholl: we will see that shortly :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the result ok - but the play :(:(|pg||
nt|fann4: I think 6@H always makes - N gets caught in a minor suit squeeze if declarer can read the situation.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: should be interesting competition|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|bobholl: bidding starts the same way at his table|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Christie overcalls with a rather less good hand than the one which Buchen passed earlier|pg||
nt|fann4: Note the pass by E on an 8 card suit. Very disciplined.|pg||
nt|rv: Uggeri might win competition with his shape:)|pg||
nt|caruga: I'm not sure I would open 1 @H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: matter of style i suppose|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: 5@d would be more interesting to watch than 3N here...may require @dJ finess in 5@d...|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bobholl: i would say :(:(:(|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, but may just take finesses instead of playing for squeeze|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 1@c as well, enough playing strength to reverse and bid @hs later|pg||
nt|granguru: if 1@C is not used as art opening @H is an error...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: as cards are E-W makes 6@c though 5@c us reasonable contract|pg||
mb|5C|nt|woozle: Smolanko starts with 2S...a 3S splinter or fit jump in diamonds might have been better options, if available|pg||
nt|sommer: it is best chance|pg||
nt|chilloncan: transfer overcall it seems|pg||
nt|psyck: @c fin that is|pg||
nt|granguru: except they  are using canapé style|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: we have been speculating quite a vit on their string @c defense :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: or is it "majors-or-minors" or something of that ilk?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: they seem to be on same wavelength here, West did raise to 5@c instead of giving pref to 4@h |pg||
nt|caruga: would  be the first time in 30 years :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ianmcc: lead change|pg||
nt|woozle: Smolanko's 4C doesn't really do justice to his playing strength...Anderson didn't know how good his hand was (there didn't have to be a stiff spade opposite)|pg||
nt|psyck: likely a suction variant, but other possibilities too maybe|pg||
nt|chilloncan: NS well on their way|pg||
nt|athene: might be "spades or..."|pg||
nt|athene: it has certainly caused some confusion, which is the general idea :)|pg||
nt|psyck: suction would be @s or the next two suits (minors) here|pg||
nt|fann4: Agreed|pg||
nt|granguru: best contract..as was said hey will make 6 but chances are less than 50% before starting to play the hand|pg||
nt|rv: correct contract in my opinion, 6@c is fortuitous|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bid slams on these hands and you wont live long|pg||
nt|granguru: :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: but his partner bid 3@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like down 1 territory|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ianmcc: The auction went very nicely in OR|pg||
nt|woozle: EW had the early running in the auction in the other room - East showed both majors, West jumped to 3S...North judged aggressively (and successfully) to double...but 4S from West ...|pg||
nt|woozle: might have stolen the pot|pg||
nt|athene: north must think that 2@S set up a game force?|pg||
nt|athene: he would surely not bid 3@D there with so good a hand if he thought it was not forcing|pg||
nt|psyck: S has a maximum|pg||
nt|psyck: asuming pass of 1@h was les than 8 hcp|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i played suction ONCE. ishmael delmonte said "you are going to LOVE this". it came up, and when the smoke cleared we were -1400 againt a partial. i couldnt remember the details of ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it. so i said "got any more  gadgets i will love?":)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobholl: made is fairly good possible|pg||
nt|athene: was west going to bid 4@S over 4@D, i wonder?|pg||
nt|athene: that would be a bit of a view|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: Try DONTTON next time Marshall :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  W needs to shift now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C was gazilli i suppose ?|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 4@S down 2 on @H-ruff? - Verdace in 3NT - @H-lead and S has to find @d10 in on @SA - adn N has to take the 2. @D with @dA - very difficult defense|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: something must have gone wrong if 1400 vs nothing :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the auction developed extremely well for S here. was able to pass first, and then in that context could bid strongly|pg||
nt|athene: i mean surely you could have escaped for only 11 :)|pg||
nt|athene: east was perhaps wondering if his diamond spot there was suit preference|pg||
nt|athene: in case the @DK was a singleton|pg||
nt|andyv:  but this won't do it|pg||
nt|bobholl: even the 8 helps|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|psyck: Suction variants: http://bridge.thomasoandrews.com/psycho.html|pg||
nt|chilloncan: endplayed opp for -14|pg||
nt|fann4: I can't understand why W continued to 3N over a passed partner who bid 2@C then 3@C|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sommer: he has 73% chance of making by taking @SA|pg||
nt|athene: south was a bit stuck if his partner bid hearts over 2@S, wasn't he?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nunes  started slam board 8 with a weak 1nt fantoni going for a @H slam invitation on the way to 6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fann4: What was he expecting opposite?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|woozle: 10 imps to Klinger, now in the lead|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobholl: now you should have another @C to lead but alas|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: they are in controls position & 4nt call |pg||
nt|psyck: we are all foxed Jeff :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: does he just bid 3@S as a sort of "do something intelligent, partner" noise?|pg||
nt|psyck: I think needs !j fin now as i mentioned earlier|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  750|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: can it ever be necessary to attack hearts there?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is worried declarer is getting rid of a heart with the ruffing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|athene: give declarer @HAx(x) or something|pg||

nt|woozle: It's easy to be critical, but it would be shortsighted to deny Five Card Standard some of the blame - North had to tread very carefully lest he be facing a balanced minimum with ...|pg||
nt|woozle: three clubs (and potentially, spade wastage)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe there are layouts where it is necessary|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: fantoni declarer |pg||
mb|1D|nt|granguru: @C 2-2 is 40% plus 1 of 2 finesses makes slam chances less than 20%|pg||
mb|1H|nt|woozle: Who's bidding 4S?|pg||
nt|athene: another strong club for north|pg||
nt|athene: but this time east can't weave his evil spells|pg||
nt|athene: not having a 5-card suit :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: garazzo still thinking in other room at 5 level in @C|pg||
nt|athene: but in general it's wrong to attack any suit where dummy has a decent holding|pg||
nt|bobholl: (previous board)|pg||
nt|athene: because declarer can't get rid of his losers there anyway|pg||
nt|psyck: 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: and bad 5/0 distribution suit @S |pg||
nt|psyck: 4@s does look ok seeing just NS cards :)|pg||
nt|rv: another hand for competition here, auction could go to 5 level though both sides don't make game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what now - x|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jameslee 2: 6@H fantoni ,lead  4@D |pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: admittedly, the lack of a 5-card suit doesn't stop many people from weaving over strong clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: Well, we will be avle to rule out DONTTON & narrow down on Suction if E doesnt act :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: you just suggested it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: stiff sk again. slams are growing out of ther woodwork|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: sorry, last hand....who's doubling and who's passing the double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting gain of 3 imps for Fornaciari on board 8..3N by NS, 1@h there by EW|pg||
nt|athene: NS cheerfully play weak (and offshape) notrump throughout|pg||
nt|athene: and they seem to escape disaster most of the time|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@C - if u only see the EW-cards|pg||
nt|fann4: The smart money is on E to make 6@H on bd 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: another slam 6@s on a finess (but a stiff @sK in front)|pg||
nt|rv: East may bid 5@h for insurance here|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: how about "wuction"? stands for wet suction  - you don't bid on 4-4 shapes|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wouldn't describe Claudio as cheerful:)|pg||
nt|athene: haha|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Fantoni is already counting 12 tricks on @h fin then :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen (foolishly to my mind) tries doubling 3NT, but a spade lead could be the last thing that he needs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Buchen making it worse|pg||
nt|athene: interesting 1nt here - i wonder is this a forcing notrump?|pg||
nt|rv: at IMPs you much rather give away 50 or 100 instead of -420|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|woozle: Today, it's cold on any lead and he turns -7 imps into -9, but another non-rare outcome will be to talk his partner off the killing lead|pg||
nt|woozle: Smolanko runs. That didn't occur to me, with good spades and the doubler not on lead|pg||
nt|athene: looks strange otherwise with 3-card support|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: north obviously didn't think it was a forcing notrump|pg||
nt|fann4: These days, many pairs play that over the x, 2@H is a sound 2@S raise.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: cant be bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt bet the way things are going|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2 control cards ar missing, so....|pg||
nt|sommer: I take the chance of commentators curse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..2 aces missing|pg||
nt|sommer: so he must jump now to 6@S... I doubt that|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1Nt and not 2@C by East?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C better than 3nt but wouldn't have made either|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: so it was a good X after all?|pg||
nt|woozle: 4C will make four, for a flat board an Klinger still in the lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and picked up 1 on 31|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mr duboin giving it plenty of thought|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S was forcing one round, might be only 4 spades|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, & 2@s a weaker raise|pg||
nt|fann4: right|pg||
nt|rv: North doubled because he has values in Other minor (not one bid by South)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: is this a victim for the 5-carnd major opening?|pg||
nt|rv: this auction could get duplicated in OR as well|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fann4: so redouble and then support is a little more than 9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|woozle: Someone suggested that the doubler might have solid hearts, but HE'S NOT ON LEAD|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Klinger also pulled out of the X|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to say who was at fault here without knowing the details of the system|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks after a @c lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: card... |pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: very few top losers, but very few tricks too here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fann4: Will 3@D make? GIB says no, but things can change.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Now E known that it´s a finess slam|pg||

nt|sommer: ..If I understood the bidding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I love even money |pg||
nt|jcomyn: my slams are usually about 20 per cent|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: still looks normal to rebid 2@c on 1N|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: if passing 1nt with that north hand was right, then south had to find a stronger bid with his hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: looks so :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: trumps will cut down dec's trciks|pg||
nt|fann4: Now GIB says makeable - but remember that GIB is a double dummy analyser, seeing all 4 hands.|pg||
nt|psyck: now dec likely will cash @hk & x ruff|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: meckstroth-rodwell play this style of 1major rebids after a strong club|pg||
nt|fann4: But declarer must play a @C or @HK now to make.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psyck: as long as he does not try @h fin...|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|athene: but responder shows right away the hcp count and whether 3 card support|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 5@c will also go down, because of the 3-0 in @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: did S count the @S ?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|granguru: well regarding last hand slam was in fact more than 20% asit wins also with @C 3-1 aand both finesses |pg||
pc|cQ|mc|9|nt|athene: so 2@D would be 5-7 hcp with 3 spades here,for them, over 1@S, i think|pg||

nt|athene: east can see no point plodding on with diamonds with no entry|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: I have a very simple rule. Act as early as possible ans don´t balance if you not are very sure that it is correct|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: so he tries to help his partner out a bit|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: many specs point out north hasn't got 8-12|pg||
nt|athene: well, he has 11, but only if you count in base 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did Angelini really bid 2@D? Must be true, hard to believe|pg||

nt|athene: the wrong bidding card|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sommer: ..and finesse!!:) ..of course|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: oooooops|pg||

nt|athene: but i just think the risk/reward ratio is not good|pg||
nt|athene: or at least you have to make it more like 17-19|pg||

nt|granguru: about the slam a kib says:WITHOUT the diamond lead, the slam needs only club break and 4-2 heart break. No finesses. |pg||
nt|rv: Uggeri has heard John and decided no more prosaic bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now north will double for takeout |pg||

nt|pelu: sometimes the players makes easy to difficult :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Even without a @H ruff, 4@S goes 1 off here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: I predict 11 tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|sommer: ..a little less than 30% rather, I think|pg||
nt|caruga: is 1@D looking for troubles?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|woozle: I think Christie had to enquire to choose between 3NT and 3NT|pg||

nt|granguru: which is right. so 6@C by WEST was the right contract finally.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: in the other room surely east had showed long clubs at some point so covering the club looks less appealing|pg||
nt|fann4: So long as NS don't wait too long to play @C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: getting pushy|pg||
nt|sommer: after S' opening, W can upgrade his controlcards a lot|pg||

pc|h3|nt|rv: Sbarigia with Lauria-Versace leading with 130 VPs and Angelini with Fantunes second on 120|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|woozle: This should score 140, maybe 170 on soft defense|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: that discard helped declarer|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: of course Fantoni Nunes can go for penalties a lot with their super-sound 1-level openers |pg||
nt|athene: but still it was a view from east with all that stuff in hearts facing possibly 4 hearts in west's hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was only a couple of imps at stake wonce E chose not to pass 1st|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||

mc|10|nt|athene: ok, there is one interesting point worth a mention from the open room auction|pg||
nt|bobholl: the @H try was far to greedy :)|pg||
nt|rv: this result will surely help Sabbatini who are currently 4th on 99 VPs|pg||
nt|caruga: yes, Leo Cima|pg||
nt|granguru: Who is he?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Another point is that South did not raise spades or bid something else|pg||
nt|athene: the danger of partner pulling your re-opening double to a 4-card heart suit is very low in fact|pg||
nt|bobholl: but he won't|pg||
nt|fann4: clearly declarer did not play a low @H from hand |pg||
nt|fann4: Last board here now|pg||
nt|psyck: Well EW sure deserved to lose imps on 10 they way they handled it here :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Absolutely|pg||
nt|jcomyn: remarkable at this level|pg||
nt|rv: Cima and Garozzo practiced daily on BBO|pg||
nt|granguru: Benito was bor september 6 1927|pg||
nt|caruga: a very good player from Tuscany, 45/47 yrs old, nice :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with 4 hearts he would double 1@S himself|pg||
nt|rv: this is last deal of this segment, many thanks to Vugraph operator and my excellent co-commentators John, Fabio and John|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  didn't want to give up 3 imps|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: if he doesn't have a trap pass that is|pg||
nt|bobholl: dutch 2 (muiderberg) migth have kept NS out of @S |pg||
nt|fann4: It was 12 imps:)|pg||
nt|psyck: the more the merrier...for the kibs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thanks venkatash very pleasant morning|pg||
nt|rv: many thanks to BBO and Roland for co-ordinating these broadcasts and specs for insightful comments|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ianmcc: 3NT doesn't look good|pg||
nt|granguru: tks rv and all...c u in some more minutes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and our world wide weather forecast|pg||
nt|rv: rains have stopped here in Bangalore, should be a cool pleasant evening|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 1nt "12+-15"|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a reasonable 1nt bid for west there over 1@S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit ligth :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W agrees with you Bob:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it's V with AJ sec|pg||
nt|athene: west just has 1400 in the wrong column on his scorecard :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will make a game try|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT might be their strong 4-card raise|pg||
nt|athene: that's quite common|pg||
nt|psyck: the boards have certainly been interesting this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and 6 in a row|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D would be mixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and before that a 1370 too|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: last board here ty to all Jeff&Krishna&specs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|woozle: I'm having difficulty believing Buchen's first round pass|pg||
nt|fann4: South 2@D and West 3@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that's a fairly horrible 11 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Notrump wrong-sided but it would likely go down anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  which turns out to be 13 imps for Angelini as OR only got to 5@c|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Jeff & James.  Good job by our unnamed Operator. Thanks to the kibs for joinnig us & for their inputs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Spade lead, diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: take a point off for 4333, take another point off for the diamond spots, and take another point off for partner playing them better :) and what do you have left?|pg||
nt|andyv:  @hs can be guessed for one loser but bad @s break will sink 4@s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|woozle: Smolanko declining many opportunities to bid notrumps could cost dearly if Christie hits on the heart lead|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal.  Thanks to my co-commentators Bill & Roland.  Well done Operator. Thanks kibs for joining us & for their inputs.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H - P - P 2@S by S - and N will b9id 4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|fann4: Thanks Krishna and all.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: my tip is@c|pg||
nt|rv: declarer will play @hs twice from dummy and score this comfortably |pg||
nt|rv: well played Sabbatini, they have got most of the big decisions right in this match|pg||
nt|rv: Please access url http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html for scores from this event|pg||
pc|sK|nt|woozle: Certainly, when your partner, marked with all of the values, didn't overcall over 1C, the only good suit he can have is clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: but E could bid 2nt :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|woozle: Thoughtful lead, but it leaves the result in limbo for the moment. Still probably down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the curse strikes again|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
