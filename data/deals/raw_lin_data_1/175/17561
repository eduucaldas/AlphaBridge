mb|4N|mb|p|nt|hawe45: A very good 6 @H here, @H 3-2 or @S King on-side|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Murat Erkel|pg||
nt|hawe45: Some specs prefere 6 NT, might be better|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|hawe45: We should have (had) result from CR - but maybe they have been bidding for a long time on this board|pg||
nt|murat e: hi everybody|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|7H|nt|hawe45: But 6 NT on a @C-lead might bring problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 5@s confirmed all key cards, maybe asked for specific kings|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45: I was asked, whether 3 @H was forcing - I think it was...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: as long as West does not drop a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then it makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or can make at least|pg||
nt|psyck: e.g. if North had @sK & @cK, he could bid 6@d on 6@c to show either @dK or the other 2 K's (@s * @c)|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: wow, i really did not expect pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: They play bad preempts NV - so North is way too strong.|pg||
nt|rhelle: If he opens 3@d with that hand, they may miss 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i guess they are prepared to have a gap between 1@D and 3@D|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: 3@H would have made it diff. for north|pg||
nt|athene: double of 2nt is responsive i guess - takeout of hearts |pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|jeanhari: after @H ace|pg||
nt|athene: now if north had the @CA he should cash it before returning the spade|pg||
nt|athene: so when he just leads a spade, south always plays him for spade ruff not the @CA|pg||
nt|athene: of course north can't have the @CA here as a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: but if that was ambiguous, it might be necessary|pg||
nt|jeanhari: still something to think give south 7 spades and Txx of hearts...|pg||
nt|athene: have we crashed again?|pg||

nt|jeanhari: must south go up in hearts to play a club?|pg||
nt|athene: no easy entry to hand to finesse diamonds and you are never going for that anyway|pg||
nt|jeanhari: defense can play three round of heart when in with a spade|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's problem is that if he ever loses the lead the defence can play three rounds of trumps and stop the second diamond ruff|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: but he can't just use club ruffs to reach dummy as he definitely loses trump control then|pg||
nt|jeanhari: and declarer cant ruff a club as an entry|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: he might try a spade to the ace and a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so down one|pg||
nt|athene: but i think the defence can just get a force on dummy in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: when he plays a trump at some point, south wins the first trump and plays a club|pg||
nt|athene: west has to ruff|pg||
nt|athene: now north wins @HA and plays @CK|pg||

nt|jeanhari: but declarer cant see that|pg||
