nt|penseur9: the bidding should be interesting here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bebechira: welcome to Tim Bourke :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@c is a making game with both major suit finesses working|pg||
nt|bebechira: many thanks for help Tim|pg||
nt|fabsayc: getting hungry|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kiwibridge: @H 11-14|pg||
mb|1H|nt|henryb:  Tim. What is the pass of 2@d?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4+@H|pg||
nt|penseur9: slam appears possible NS double dummy but I doubt they can bid it|pg||
mb|d|nt|timb: 3NT seems to make too|pg||
nt|timb: Obviously not to play|pg||
nt|henryb:  I mean by S? I would play it as "we might have found a better home than your major."|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|henryb:  But I don't play multi|pg||
nt|frankaus: likely down|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yep|pg||
mb|3N|nt|timb: So would i|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good bid all the same|pg||
nt|penseur9: seems like another 3NT coming up|pg||
nt|bebechira1: we will keep in mind the real score is 72-71|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  In which case, why wouldn't North pass it out in 2@dX?|pg||
nt|penseur9: they're well on the way though :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: I gave the multi up in 1989 or 1990; I play simple weak twos with 2@D, 2@H & 2@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i got into big trouble with this auction, partner took 4@H as slam invite|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Anyone think 6H was makeable?|pg||
nt|timb: 4@C ask opener to bid the suit below his major|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: in NA you have to Texas transfer with no slam interest|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h maybe not easy|pg||
nt|penseur9: a RUF is always rough :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|penseur9: right Traian, just add 10 to the Hoffman team score till te end of this round|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|penseur9: to many possibilityes to hasard a guess here|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 2!n is "good-bad" wouldn't 3@c be to play?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb:  I understand no call after 2@d|pg||
pc|h5|nt|timb: Ron & Bill are a not a long-time partnership and this auction smacks of confusion|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|frankaus: lots of ruffs coming|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Pardon the interruption, i seem to have lost track of the play -_-|pg||

pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: -3 seems extreme|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d2|nt|penseur9: looking like +2 here|pg||

nt|penseur9: probably 3@D now and....|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  1N or P?|pg||
nt|chick: but turns out that all he needs is the @HJx and the @Cxxx in his partner's hand|pg||

nt|penseur9: is rhis correct?|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: haha it is my first time!|pg||
nt|penseur9: I have to ask Roland for voice commentaries... my typing is terrible :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  I think you have to play for the QcJ to come down in two rounds because you can't afford to release the @sK early. You need it to get to the @dK later|pg||

nt|timb: indeed|pg||

mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|4C|mb|4D|nt|timb: 1@H=4+@S s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here in NZ the organisers have removed any fun there was in duplicate pairs by legislating thou shalt not see any other scores|pg||
nt|super nova: Yes,.. fair enough. |pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: hi Jamie|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|penseur9: wow in OR on  21, they were in 5@Cx -5 for 13 IMPs for Prescott team|pg||
nt|penseur9: here we played 41h making|pg||
nt|penseur9: 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: The cards lie well for NS they can make 10 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so you play a board, get a random %age and never know why :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: i'm asked  Y we use 4 handed? - when there are 8 hands playing at any one time |pg||
nt|chick: the KR formula is not a good indicator of how many tricks you can take :)|pg||
nt|ritong: normal pass|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  Perhaps South is worth 3@h here?|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@d already has shown extras|pg||

nt|henryb:  could have claimed when both opponents followed to first spade|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
nt|penseur9: seems that 3@S makes NS here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Loses to Kx and K10x onside which is much more likely than stiff K offside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So don't do that, André :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: ok 2 boards to go this round (penultimate knowledgeable people would say) :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: good point Roland :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: its just that its more memorable when K is stiff i guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: NS hand but they never got in auction in open room|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: hmmm - is 4 hearts gunna make ?|pg||

nt|ianmcc: looks OK to me, E/W do OK in 3@h|pg||
nt|ritong: bold move by justin|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bebechira1: many thanks to David as well .. super-job  and we must add that David was instrumental in bringing the event to us|pg||
nt|penseur9: with @C ruff -1|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so Hoffman whittling away|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: 7 IMPs for Presctt on  27 with 3nt making in OR|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ritong: 2@s is certainly an invite of some sort  although pard did not superaccept @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: two fine teams, both playing very well|pg||
nt|henryb:  Fantoni and Nunes play 1@h = 4 or 5 spades, or 6 with a game force, and 2@s = 6 spades, invitational|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes I agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira1: last board coming up..many thanks to Phil and Martin for help...excellent job gentlemen|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: i am worrying about the second roundd of spades in 4 hearts - where is deep finesse when you need it ??|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Looks like the same contract as the other table|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: kevin has a natural winning line|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|ritong: @h A onside and @d K bare|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ianmcc: that looks bad|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they need the @s trick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes thanks David, and special thanks specs, |pg||
nt|penseur9: yes the final round should be real interesting (|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ianmcc: this lead could square it|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|kiwibridge: thanks to the ABF and BBO |pg||
nt|bebechira1: Lille is great city...nice food and great old town...the fight for it will be hard|pg||
nt|penseur9: like all the previous were|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianmcc: no?|pg||
nt|penseur9: just a reminder that 10 IMPs must be added to the Hoffman score so now 96-94|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bebechira1: last hand coming up...many thanks to Ian and Martin for excelent job and to Stephen for fantastic job as well|pg||
