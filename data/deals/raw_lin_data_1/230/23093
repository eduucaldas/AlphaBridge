nt|jdonn:  playing to ruff 2 spades in hand pretty much just needs either clubs 3-3, or clubs 4-2 and diamonds 3-2|pg||

nt|jdonn:  sorry i'll use last names since that's what everyone sees|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  he could have passed or bid 2@s, or even bid 2@h since his failure to make a support double over 2@d means he probably won't have three hearts. 2@s seems like a sensible choice|pg||
nt|3for3:  2@S seems normal with this shape|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  pass would have worked well here but it's hard to blame him, partner doesnt always have QT|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  if you must play a game as E/W, 3NT looks like the one. 4@s has too many losers|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3:  moss is one of the most aggressive penalty doublers at the expert level|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jdonn:  Great double by moss, he has fantastic defense with AK AK and he knows his partner has 4 trumps|pg||
nt|3for3:  right, he won't always have 4 winners, but very likely at least 3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Demirev will probably figure out trumps, shortness is very likely for this double|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|jdonn:  he has to take a heart now and get the count, there is no reason not to that I can see|pg||
nt|jdonn:  a diamond is a possible play too on second thought|pg||
nt|3for3:  might just go passive with a club|pg||
nt|jdonn:  That wouldn't be good if declarer was 4144 with these high cards, most would open 1@d with that but I don't see why take the chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss asking if Demerov can be 4-1-4-4|pg||
nt|jdonn:  you could only take one heart then anyway but i still think you'd want to just to see more of what's going on|pg||

nt|vugraphzff: roger apologizing to room for how long he's taking|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzff: now he apologized to his partner|pg||

nt|leo lasota: but brad & fred have all solid results on the next 3 bds|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an|strong|mb|3D|mb|d|an|game force|nt|leo lasota: the E/W hands would fit much better if the jack of hearts was the jack of spades :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|leo lasota: appears that hampson is entering the auction here with 55 in the majors and a void|pg||
nt|leo lasota: nice pressure bid of 4D by weinstein|pg||
mb|p|an|shows flexible hand|nt|leo lasota: rather unlucky to find his partner with only 22 distribution in the majors|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but could me much worse than the KJ 108 dbltons|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: greco appeared to alert 3D but hampson shrugged on his side of screen|pg||
mb|d|nt|leo lasota: worst case scenario results in -800|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: interesting hand where 3nt can be made double dummy|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzff: worst case is correct spade guess in slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|leo lasota: gitelman opts to take the conservative route here with potential misfitting 8 count opposite brad's hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota: hampson to bid 3h now|pg||
nt|leo lasota: yes, E/W can make slam if they gues the spades, but the 4D bid resultesd in likely -800 OR -650 or 680 in 4 of a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: undo?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|Vugraphzff: no undo|pg||
nt|leo lasota: misunderstanding for N/S, but makes 10 tricks in nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota: so may still escape|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Nik very hopeful his partner finds a pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: the practical solution on these trick-taking hands is to open 3nt in 4th seat unless that is 25-27 or a special convention|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: there may be some explanation confusion|pg||
nt|leo lasota: this is another example of greco/hampson using the pass/dbl inversion|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|leo lasota: brad can count 2 diamonds, ace clubs, 6 trump tricks |pg||
nt|leo lasota: just another push board :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|leo lasota: As spec has pointed out, if there was misinformation provided by Greco/Hampson, this may be rolled back to 3h dbled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: explanations were in sync on both sides of screen|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dT|nt|leo lasota: understandably, Nik was concerned about defending with only xx and Ax in the majors|pg||
nt|leo lasota: so I presume that he intended 3h as stopper showing|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but N/S were likely to score 800 against 3h dbled |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|3for3:  looks like a 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3:  interesting that demirev passed 1st seat|pg||

nt|3for3:  i despise 2@C|pg||
mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|jdonn:  they must open lighter when not vulnerable|pg||
nt|3for3:  5332 with jxx @S is just begging for 1100|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  2nt here shows clubs, since 2@c is "drury" showing a spade raise and 3@c is probably a "fit showing jump" showing clubs and spades|pg||
nt|jdonn:  there is no need for a natural 2nt by a passed hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jdonn:  i agree with you on 2@c by south, that would not be wise vulnerable in particular|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3:  in my methods, 2n is fit with clubs, 3@C natural with clubs|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3:  that way the correct (usually) hand can declare NT|pg||
nt|jdonn:  that's not a bad idea|pg||
nt|3for3:  it is a switch that gives up....nothing|pg||
nt|jdonn:  some play the 2nt is a different type of raise, and some play that it's both minors, as long as it's not natural then you will gain on some type of hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Lee:  "2NT shows clubs..number 1 of my 4 guesses"|pg||
pc|d6|nt|3for3:  clubs are VERY bad, but spades plenty good|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it's not totally clear how to play the hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|3for3:  my instinct is to win diamond in dummy and lead club to ten|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jdonn:  winning the diamond in dummy is a sure sign he will be playing a club to the ten|pg||
nt|3for3:  demirev too :)|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it was either that, or win in hand to lead hearts|pg||
nt|jdonn:  everything works here, other than a heart to the king but he would never do that|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s6|pc|h5|nt|jdonn:  when south wins this and plays another diamond, demirev might duck a spade to ensure 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jdonn:  moss continues clubs instead, now declarer can't easily duck a spade since he wuold have 5 losers|pg||
nt|jdonn:  this hand has become pretty complicated|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if he thinks the heart is onside then he can simply win this and lead a heart to the king, but i think the club continuation rather than playing a diamond suggests holding the ace of hearts|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dJ|nt|jdonn:  if he thinks the heart is offside then i don't see much choice but to play for spades to break at this point|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|3for3:  he might be able to end south if he is the one with 4 spades|pg||
nt|3for3:  and he can be pretty sure from Gitelman's pitch that if spades arent breaking south has them|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||

nt|leo lasota: perhaps brad thought that he already showed his working values with 3d|pg||
nt|bobh1: perhaps 2@S showed 2 kings or an ace and fred guessed wrong?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but from fred's point of view, brad has not promised an ace on the auction, so he passed 5c|pg||
