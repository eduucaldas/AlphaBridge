nt|athene: i guess Meckstroth is now working out if he has to play his partner for a singleton club to beat this|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: jeff is thinking|pg||
nt|athene: declarer would not be likely to duck with four clubs in his hand usually, but sometimes it might be his only chance i suppose|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||

nt|petergill: Back on Bd 46 - the maths indicated to play N for @CJ, but N's choice of a @D switch instead of a @C switch was possibly mildly suggestive of N having @CJ (or possibly not, at this ...|pg||
nt|petergill: World Class level of play) |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bobh1: another slam|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C 16+, 1@H is spades or 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell will want to go for penalties now|pg||
nt|athene: whether his partner has spades or a balanced hand, defending 2@DX looks quite appetising|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to David Edwin|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobh1: this one a grand|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets:  not enough only 500 against 650|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: meckstroth said in his book that they make it a definite policy to try to penalize opps who come in over the strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: lost track of the play here, will enter result at end|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|bobh1: they just have to stay out of @Ss|pg||
nt|athene: even if sometimes they only get 500 against their vul game, it is worth it so opps know they can't take too many liberties|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: North very aggressive opposite a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts obviously shortage   and not 4 spades|pg||
nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
nt|ady: clear cut 3NT from north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hamman's tool was  3@D showing @C & @D with longer @D    @Hx led in both rooms|pg||
nt|bigtrain: marshall's dolcid tones and your voice for newspaper roland -- loud and clear|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: but with that shape i guess he was always bidding on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some play that 3@H can be 4144  --- is that not the meckwell agreement Walter?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bobh1: hard to bid grands without blackwood|pg||
nt|algraves:  One would have to trust that south is not control bidding with zero aces|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|petergill: N's theory is that with South knowing where the missing HCP are, and with finesses likely to work, less than the usual  25 points are needed for 3NT to make, with 1NT overcaller ...|pg||
nt|petergill: over the opener|pg||
nt|algraves:  so the 23 pt NT does not come in on this hand|pg||
nt|petergill: but backfires this time|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|algraves:  voila|pg||
nt|bobh1: didnt bother hurd|pg||
nt|barnets:  10 tricks against best def 11 in hearts|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|algraves:  at some point with no aces and kings and minimum count you could actually just invite 3NT by raising|pg||
nt|athene: will cheek play to cash out clubs right away?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H in RM shows 55 minors and short @S|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|bigtrain: dulcet|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bigtrain: yes|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|ady: 4th spade trick blocked|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||

mb|1D|nt|algraves:  1@C strong of course, 2@C positive I presume with long clubs|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3@H from grue, double from meckstroth|pg||
nt|athene: lots of suggestions for Grue here|pg||
nt|barnets:  should he bid 4@H east may x and west 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sorry lost connect contracr was 4s w making 7|pg||
nt|barnets:  the third in hand opener is quite normal for any of these guys|pg||
nt|athene: making 7? that's a lot|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobh1: hamman has support but not enough values for a direct raise|pg||
nt|algraves:  forcing NT, one of the hand types is a weak heart raise|pg||
nt|petergill: Al is right that the lack of aces and kings is a negative factor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = natural GF|pg||
nt|ady: last hand   several kibs suggest east ducks 2nd heart    will give declarer some problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have been @D & @H    not sure if 1@D also show both|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: nice trump support|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@D key card in @C|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: sry we are having internet problems|pg||
nt|algraves:  well then do away with the invitational raise if that is the position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's 2@H walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = @S raise|pg||
nt|bigtrain: versace and lauria|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|algraves:  if the club is in your bag then at some point you should use it.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|algraves:  3@H limit of better in principle|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thts helpful...  you can't go south  ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: declarer's problem is more a death of tricks than the bad trump break|pg||
nt|algraves:  Grand slam try asking more information|pg||
nt|algraves:  so Cheek, knows that his partner has neither Major King|pg||
nt|ady: maybe some sort of asking bid in diamonds?|pg||
nt|algraves:  6 imps is not cheap|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C= natural|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bigtrain: 3@D = Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: colan|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobh1: but i think he can manage|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  no ! assume more key card, ie asking for informatino|pg||
nt|algraves:  I suspect 5NT showed interest as he could have bid 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: 5d asked for kings|pg||
nt|algraves:  So this showed the Kick back method of asking for Key cards, ie one above agreed trumps to advantage|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  So well done|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: Mesbur-Fitzgibbons??|pg||

pc|sA|nt|bobh1: kibs are taking both sides of this one|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: Zia @C play is not popular with the naysayers|pg||
nt|algraves:  easier when you can see all 4 hands and are in the back row|pg||
nt|bobh1: of course we can all see much more of the deal than Zia can|pg||
nt|algraves:  but that is the kibitizers long held right|pg||
nt|algraves:  without Oscar the Owl the game would be poorer|pg||
nt|bobh1: Zia plays MUD it appears|pg||
nt|bobh1: this may be a source of confusion for Joel|pg||
nt|bobh1: normally a player leading the 5 then playing the 9 would have the Q|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a timed event but long pauses for thought are normal and permitted|pg||
nt|bobh1: when they start to add up, the director starts getting nasty|pg||
nt|algraves:  Well Woldridge can build a club trick with the right view but that is hardly clear|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  They have a way to invite in @S shoiwing 5|pg||
nt|algraves:  so this shows that hand|pg||
nt|algraves:  invitational with @S 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets:  so the lead now is 65|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  I suspect we did not quite see the play correctly|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: well stopped|pg||
nt|algraves:  and he trusts his partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd on Roland's list of terrible bridge terms|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|algraves:  yes although that was not a minimum hand with two tens and 2 Aces, 2Kings and a working j|pg||
nt|algraves:  certinaly suited for play in Hearts though, the classic 4-3 fit type hand , strong trumps and prime cards outside|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49: Yes. I think it was mostly the spade holding that deterred Meckstroth from 1NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  to facilitate ruffing in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49: wd Meckstroth anyway|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h6|nt|algraves:  My Mom would bring this in, with her only consistent line of play|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm this is a bit interesting|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wants to go over to dummy and finesse hearts to keep east off lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sry put contract i to follow play|pg||
nt|athene: but if he cashes the @DQ whilst he is there, he sets up diamond tricks and an entry for east|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: msy make 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: maybe he will now decide he has to just bash out hearts from the top|pg||
nt|athene: you can't really make use of the @h98|pg||
nt|athene: for example club to king, heart to jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Cheek thinking|pg||
nt|athene: because if that finesse lost, a club return would tangle your entries|pg||
nt|barnets:  he may x to dummy and lead the @H 8 to the J|pg||
nt|athene: yes, maybe you can do that, and then duck if west wins and shifts to a club|pg||
nt|barnets:  ibut a club retun hurts transport here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|algraves:  Hurd is a terrific player , dont get me wrong, but at some point.... as I said. It is a good debate when the stakes are 4-6 imps|pg||
pc|c8|nt|algraves:  which was to pull trump and take whatever finesses were about|pg||
nt|ady: a squeeze materialised on east|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|algraves:  on this hand there are none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe at this point he is regretting ducking the first trick as it gives him slightly less elbow-room for a throw-in ending|pg||
nt|athene: but he was not sure spades were 6-1, meckstroth being in first seat at favourable, i guess|pg||
nt|barnets:  he could duck it thouhgh|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|algraves:  Grue is trying for some elimination so the the opps have to start @H|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|barnets:  and is ok|pg||

nt|athene: thanks to that @C9|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|barnets:  so well played|pg||
nt|barnets:  playing hearts from top would be silly had east the @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: this line would only be wrong if west had all the clubs, QJ10x|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|ahollan1: our game doesn't do a very good job of matching up english with conventions|pg||

nt|algraves:  yes Peter , very difficult sometimes for our operators to see exactly what happened|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  and 9 for NS in @H|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bridgwinners website, about 70% of readers picked Spector to win this match. I was in the minority when I voted for Nickell to win. |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: this shows about 22-23|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry that wasn't meant for the room|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|petergill: Zia cannot ask for @HQ, has a problem|pg||
nt|petergill: so Is using 5@S queen ask to detemine whether to play 6@H or 6NT|pg||
nt|athene: double-dummy you can make this of course, but in practice i think it will go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Eric tanking|pg||
nt|athene: probably going to lose a diamond, two hearts and one or even two trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: i had many ims about the last hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|barnets: if the play was as recorded south would have made it had he ducked the @CJ|pg||
nt|ady: east suitable with not much in spades opposite a likely shortage|pg||

nt|ady: nice easy hand to play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: n/s kept out of the bidding    in fact only 8 tricks in spades with the 4-0 split|pg||
nt|petergill: normally 5@S (if queen ask) shows all keycards, but here Zia knows that Hamman cannot bid 7@h, having limited his hand via 2NT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobh1: the 4@S contract went down in the other room so the match tightens up|pg||

mb|1D|nt|bigtrain: 2@H is intermediate|pg||
mb|1H|nt|algraves:  the big club players these days have developed a keen eye for what auctions make it hard for the opponents to bid accurately|pg||
nt|algraves:  for instance on that hand some standard experts would raise to 2@H to make their game auction easier in case partner has strong hand.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H ony choice|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     e/w  might win the auction in hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: needs a bit more to bid 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Down 2?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Spector has found the 4-1 split  |pg||
mb|2C|nt|petergill: 2NT showed exactly 3 spades, hence E knew that they had a 5-3 spade fit. I'm not sure how West asks for @HQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|algraves:  playing precision you know partner is limited so game in unlikely unless partner can start jumping aroudn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 16+ unbal  18+ bal,   2@D = game force 5+@D|pg||
nt|athene: nice @S10 makes 3nt very comfortable here|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  so 1@S muddies the waters a little bit more than 2@H|pg||
nt|petergill: I think with his good 19 count, West intended 5@S as a queen ask, but when it's Hamman who passes 5@S, one tends to think that Hamman is usually right |pg||
nt|algraves:  we are not quite sure what the deeper meaning of the last bid was. but 6@H or 6NT are easy makes so an opportunity for Spector|pg||
nt|algraves:  I bet they are irritated though. That much we know for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D also ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: negative DBL by north is much easier IF 1@D=4+@D unbal|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  just to finish for board 20 , I suspect that declarer also took the 4th club and then led a diamond to his QT. The defense had no answer to that line|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are splitting up later this year. Hamman will play with Justin Lall in another team and Levin-Weinstein will replace Zia - Hamman in the much-heralded famous Nickell team |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D in the picture   doubt they'll play 3N|pg||

nt|petergill: NS won world junior championships 7 to 13 years ago, so would now be in their early 30s|pg||
nt|athene: returning a small spade would keep control of the suit but it is unlikely declarer has a useful pitch later on the @SJ anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  68  5@D did make so  now swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SK, @DA, @CJ-K-A, @SJ   now has play for overtricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: neb @D coming up from meck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "neb" =  2+@D  10-15 hcp|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D-2@C//2@H (bal 11-13)-3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no swing|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 2+@D  |pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   for e/w best by east|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|bobh1: another light opener, this time without a 5-card major|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  on hand 38  down 2 in OR    |pg||
nt|algraves:  at the other table declarer did take a more complex line of play on 38 and this time, the simple line was best|pg||
nt|algraves:  note that Souths entire auction was pointed towards 3NT by his partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opening bid structure is identical for both pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and comparable agressive approach|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C only one-round-force, right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure if DBL = 4@S or 4/5@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: 2@S    invitational it seems|pg||
nt|algraves:  when planning your auction always focus on the likely games|pg||
nt|bigtrain: only NF if 3@C is the rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: They will probably avoid 6@H if they find they lack an ace plus @HQ |pg||
nt|ady: typical flat 11 opening these days|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: Grue has a secret weapon to defenc 3NT   and 3 spades looks difficult|pg||
nt|algraves:  and if possible any positional considerations|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure if Meck's RDBL  showing @H honor  or just cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 2@H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|algraves:  of course he was happy to play partscore if partner did not have extra values|pg||
nt|petergill: Bidding to 6@C is not crazy, but is doomed by the club break|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobh1: Zia was a bit light for 4@S, but it worked because in induced N to save|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: 28-2 set for Nickell|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bobh1: looks like 4@S depended on an inspired @C play|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: spector doing well this session   might get more imps here|pg||
nt|barnets: this will likely make just 7 tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: roddy could have arranged either partner to play this contrct|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: South seems to have bid out his shape. I'm not sure what the bids at the 3 level mean|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobh1: 10 imps to nickell on the prev board when Kohler didn't cue bid and they stopped at the 2-level|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|algraves:  that is key card in Hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll bet he makes 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|algraves:  I suspect that 3NT was " forward going "|pg||
nt|petergill: so 5@H is two keycards and no queen of @H|pg||
nt|ady: maybe only 9 now|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: so N considers 5@H or 6@C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|algraves:  he knows that Zia has a singleton for his bidding|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes many pairs have followed the Italian style of responding after overcalls which involves picking out specific invitational or better type hands so that if the opps pre empt in the overcalled suit, then partner is well placed to compete|pg||
nt|petergill: and chooses well|pg||
nt|algraves:  2 no Q |pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid by NS, I think|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: NS brief system summary http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=943&pid=722 |pg||
nt|ady: J@C   looked better at trick 2   to protect diamond position|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes I think the logic was that North had encourged but denied a @S control so 4@C showed a @S control on the side, hence the Key card ask|pg||
nt|algraves:  Note that the math of slams is that you dont want to be in slam off an ace and the Queen of trumps because then it is 50 50 in theory that you make|pg||
nt|algraves:  sometimes it is a little more because you have 9 trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: while the bring 680 happens|pg||
nt|algraves:  sometimes less when you have 8 trumps and " handling charges "|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @HK guareentees 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   been pointed out 4 spades tricks the way the pips fall|pg||
nt|ady: so 10 tricks|pg||

nt|algraves:  so just to follow up on the 2@S bid. |pg||
nt|ady: how did that make?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from NS SSF   "Mid-hand honor leads: shift to 10 generally shows interior sequence (HJT or HT9), typically lead rusinow through declarer (except as above)"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: swing action for Rodwell would be PASS :)   looks like auto opener for him|pg||
nt|athene: this could get very competitive if NS find their diamond fit|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s may compete to 5@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|algraves:  if it is invitational then when the opps blast to 4@H then partner can make a reasonable decisoin|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|algraves:  if you bid just 1@S then it is a tough choice all aroudn|pg||
mb|d|nt|algraves:  and 2@S weak is just not that effective anymore |pg||
nt|algraves:  2@S invitainol has much more reward |pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: we knew somebody sitting EW would bid 1@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: was jsut what south wanted to hear    but a normal opening |pg||
nt|ady: both major games should go down e/w    both 4-1 trump splits|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: everyone at this world class elvel usually falsecards with @SQ or @S7 if worried about a ruff, so by playing the natural card of @S , Hurd was trying to make Zia think that East's ...|pg||
nt|petergill: @S( was not a doubleton. Very delicate. Only an expert would fall for the true card being "tricky"|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 51|pg||
nt|algraves:  good point|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: Zia's pushy 4@S call might backfire as if they struggle into 4@S NS might not save and 4@S might make|pg||
nt|petergill: East's @S9 i mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: There are some seeding points in play for 2013 trials, but only for intact teams and only to get bye to R16|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobh1: probably going down|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW can make a could of @Ss|pg||
nt|ady: in fact the hand belongs ot n./s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i should call those "placement points"|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: nice or lucky stop?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobh1: on the previous board, they tell me cohler is in 4@S on a @H lead|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm not sure if 2Nt is intended as showing a good raise to 3@D?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|barnets: 5@S would be down 1 on a heart ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: so par for n/s is 500 +|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: a sort of good-bad 2NT|pg||
nt|petergill: which forced 3@C perhaps. |pg||
nt|algraves:  well we dont know in these cases|pg||
nt|petergill: South's hesitation over 3@D makes it look like S thinks N has more than N has|pg||
nt|algraves:  but we can assume that they do|pg||
nt|algraves:  Cheek and Grue continue there sure footed play by bidding 6NT where Hamman Zia missed the slam|pg||
nt|algraves:  that has 12 tricks on any distribution|pg||
nt|petergill: Wooldridge has a lot of points, but many of them are locked up in the KQ doubleton in clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w i mean|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: destined to go down|pg||
nt|algraves:  he would have had to play 3 rounds of clubs pitching both hearts, |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: kibs suggesting 5 clubs or 5 diamonds make    but 11th trick not really there   |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C makes but after the @H tap you can only make 10 tricks in @D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe a @D lead beats 5@C also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge bid 3@S over 3@D  auction isn't over yet|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes...  @D lead beats 5@C since you need a @H ruff for the 11th trick|pg||
nt|ady: heart tap in diamonds will stop any chance of ruffing a spade in north hand   and in 5 clubs a diamond lead  would  force trumps to be drawn to stop a heart ruff in south hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves:  requires @D lead to defeat 3NT if my double dummy analysis is correct|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|algraves:  Well the feeling " on the street" was that this was going to be a close well played match|pg||
nt|ady: yesz  should lose 3 diamonds and 2 aces|pg||
nt|algraves:  note the effect of the NS bidding . it made it very hard on EW to have a sure footed auctino|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue envisions hand playing on cross ruff after 3@C from Meck|pg||
nt|barnets: on 71 nickel had a chance when spector bid up to 5@S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: Raising the hearts which South showed by doubling 1@H|pg||
nt|barnets: but north has to lead the @HA|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: did 3@H  promise anything   was a leb bid available after east doubled 2 spades?|pg||
nt|petergill: Should be 130|pg||
nt|barnets: and led a " normal " @DK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|algraves:  of course you need to be playing a strong club to give you cover on hans like this , so that the non one club openers are limited to 15|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: 4 hearts hopeless|pg||
nt|ady: is this lead true?|pg||
nt|algraves:  so one can argue wether West should have bid , the point was that NS just doing there normal bidding made it difficult to sort everything out.|pg||
nt|algraves:  They play Rusinow in bid suits|pg||
nt|petergill: or he might play "safe" (unsafe if clubs 4-1) for 110 by not trying the @D hook|pg||
pc|s5|nt|algraves:  and why not lead a @S?|pg||
nt|algraves:  got to lead something|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Al, can you see why @SQ is a good play here?|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot, but if Zia is doing it, there must be a reason|pg||
pc|dT|nt|algraves:  remember the @D bid just said no 5 card major not 14-16 balanced not 6 clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i like 1@S overcall|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge in 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought 1@S automatic|pg||
nt|bigtrain: totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S needs suit quality|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: seems a diamond lead more normal than underleading 5 card suit with the ace|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobh1: if it was 15-17, S would invite|pg||
nt|algraves:  well, Grue judged to lead the suit the partnership was known to have, and put declarer to potential guess at trick one.|pg||
nt|ady: whatever led    no chance to make|pg||
nt|algraves:  if King in dummy declarer may well get it wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl makes @DK likely to be offside, so there was a real danger of a @D ruff if @D was played at Trick 2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: @CA was a falsecard i guess|pg||
nt|athene: trying to make declarer put east with another high card somewhere else|pg||
nt|athene: for example the @SK :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   i think @CA to help clarify 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: well, if he played the @CK at trick 1 and then turned up with the @HQ as a passed hand, it would not be too hard to drop the @SK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|algraves:  personally I like the dash of that lead even though it cost a trick|pg||
nt|algraves:  even though it did not gain a trick|pg||
nt|algraves:  did not cost |pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: dont think it cost  |pg||
nt|petergill: Even with @DK onside, a @D ruff was posible if the @D hook was taken|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bobh1: and N wouldn't open 1N altho they often promote and demote out of range hands|pg||
nt|agumperz:  David Stevenson Blog: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/def_1nt01.htm|pg||
nt|bobh1: this one doesn't look promotable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps -- but i suspect more geared toward @D suit pref|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he knew Cheek was ruffing -- so takes opportunity to help Rodwell|pg||
nt|athene: well declarer is just short of tricks now anyway|pg||
nt|athene: even if he gets the spades right|pg||
nt|athene: he had to lead a diamond towards the queen i suppose|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  71  5@S made -- but played by West   too tough to find @HA @H ruff that way|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  72 [3NN-2]    Nickelly declaring 3N South    waiting for opening lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good typing today al :(   grab a coke --  for medicinal purposes only|pg||

nt|athene: it's not good enough anyway but it would give declarer a nasty moment|pg||
pc|cA|nt|algraves:  es I think he wanted the @S trick now and wanted an entry to hand to deal with trumps eventually and just as you say, so as not to have to broach diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D transfer|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|petergill: There might be an "intra-finesse" here for an overtrick|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm told   Edgar Kaplan wrote "All 4H bids are transfers to 4S"" 30 years before Larry Cohen wrote about the Law of Total Tricks.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: how about a spade lead v 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS had too much information to play the mundane [and makeable] 3N|pg||
pc|h3|nt|algraves:  gadzooks an intra finesse in @D|pg||
nt|algraves:  we bring you all the exciting news|pg||
nt|petergill: In @D, lead low to 7 or 9, then run queen for one loser. The term intra-finesse was invented by Gabriel Chagas of Brazil in (I think) a Bols Bridge Tip|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|algraves:  99, ? then MAX was 86|pg||
nt|algraves:  of course|pg||
nt|ady: nice lead    but should come home with clubs 3-2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: i'm told  Poland too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was told by many :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||

pc|s2|nt|bobh1: i'm expecting a few more imps for nickell on 27|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h3|nt|ady: diamond to ace     spade to ace    cash 1 more diamond   and duck a club|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|algraves:  Maxwell Smart was played of course by Don Adams, agent 86 and he was an avid bridge player. I played rubber bridge with him at the old Cavenish west in LA  a baziion years ago|pg||
nt|petergill: Even I (who have lost the Aussie Open Team Playoff Grand Final by one imp twice in recent years, including a few weeks ago) regard overtricks at imps as less important than ...|pg||
nt|petergill: maintaining full focus on the big swings|pg||
pc|c2|nt|algraves:  mind you there was no compelling reason to play the @D that way|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|algraves:  unless he smoked out all the relevant high cards in time|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
nt|algraves:  perhaps it is possible to train the mind to maintain relaxed full focus in all situations. ( not that I can mind you )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: schedule says restart in 75 minutes   but teams can agree to start earlier  [boards not duplicated across matches]|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bobh1: 2|pg||
nt|ady: this line better  as can cash 3rd diamond  in case jack comes down|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 59, the vulnerability was very suitable for East to balance with 2@S (or West with Dbl), which would have forced NS to find an intrafinesse in 3@H - or perhaps EW go to 3@S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: which is not hopeless. |pg||
nt|petergill: Compared to me, the younger brains of people like Justin Lall, Joe Grue, Wooldridge - Hurd can give their all for every trick without hampering their concentration for the 7th or ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 8th day of these long events|pg||
nt|algraves:  An excellent set by Hurd and Wooldridge, they will sleep well tonight|pg||
nt|algraves:  Nickell team may need to mount a bit of a comeback in the 60 boards tomorrow|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that was the last board of the segment|pg||
nt|petergill: Resume tomorrow |pg||
nt|algraves:  bye all still a few boards left in other room if you all just move over|pg||
nt|algraves:  thanks to BBO for this great service and Roland Wald for organizing it all|pg||
nt|petergill: Hard to believe, but Grue - Cheek and Meckwell is the slow table, relatively. |pg||
nt|petergill: Meckwell are famous for their magnificent comebacks at the end of matches ..this match will be challenging, even for them|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye all|pg||
nt|algraves:  spector is an extremely good team. Tomorrows 2nd half will be excellent bridge. Yo'all come back now|pg||
nt|algraves:  well Peter did say something but lost in the white noise|pg||
nt|algraves:  besides we are tired|pg||
nt|algraves:  you clearly are fresh and wide awake|pg||
nt|algraves:  talking about 2@S byEW on board 59|pg||
nt|algraves:  a kibitizer wondering why we did not mention the lack of competition on board 59 and I pointed out that teh commentators are old and tired at this point|pg||
nt|petergill: I did write up Bd 59's lack of EW bidding, as Bd 60 was being played. |pg||
nt|petergill: I will take the liberty of writing a summary of this segment ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 57 - good aggressive bidding by Meckwell gained|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 55 - Nickell team was unlucky, with a lot of imps at stake|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 54 - superior bidding by Hurd - Wooldridge gained|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 52  Zia - Hamman's bidding went off the rails, but we do not know what the bids should mean|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 51 - superior bidding and play by Hurd- Wooldridge|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49 - excellent bidding judgement by Meckstroth gained|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 47 - bad lie of cards (@HK under AQ) for Meckwell who took bidding risk that backfired|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 46 - Cheek made a game - Zia's line of play which failed at this table looks OK to me, and the computer was down so we don't know how Cheek played it, but he did well|pg||
nt|petergill: Overall Summary - very high quality bridge - just one big slip up on Bd 52. Spector team deserved their segment win. Here in Australia at our top level, we make far more errors ...|pg||
nt|petergill: than these guys do. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: might not be able to start Round 7 early -- maybe directors union guarantess a full lunch break|pg||
pc|h9|pc|sA|pg||
nt|algraves:  so Cheek had a cheery moment for his well thought out lead but his partner let him down by not having a setting trick|pg||
nt|ady: think thats all for the session    thx all|pg||
nt|algraves:  Yep thanks to all of you.|pg||
nt|algraves:  perhaps it will stay tied at 86 until the next set starts|pg||
