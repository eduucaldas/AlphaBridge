nt|Walddk2:  Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
nt|athene: apart from anything, he is not likely to have a 5-card major to double 1@D, but he might well have five clubs|pg||

nt|athene: but seems a bit odd|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F|nt|athene: well as odd as an 8 can ever be :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
nt|athene: west will wreak a little mayhem here, surely|pg||
nt|runnerup:  here 5 @c seems makeable -biddable ?perhaps not|pg||
mb|2N|an|minors|nt|athene: he might show minors or he might just bid a lot of clubs|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@S natural and game-forcing i assume?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
nt|athene: one thing i have noticed is meckwell often shade positives in these situations|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: sometimes it induces their opponents to take phantom sacrifices|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s K coming down and @h blocked |pg||
nt|bigtrain: in competitive situations you have to be bid effectively|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i think it pays to stretch to give the positive, start getting your hand across fast|pg||
pc|c2|nt|runnerup:  this looks normal enougth but of course ns migth be in 4 @s also -doubled|pg||
nt|athene: yes, -300 in 3NT might well prove to be a bullet dodged|pg||
nt|athene: -200 even|pg||
nt|athene: actually to get away with -2 declarer has to throw west in to open up the diamonds, right? conceding 4 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|athene: let's say win this trick, @HK, diamond to hand, @HA, then a club|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if ew would nave bid 4 @c -what would south has bidden?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: just lead a toward the @S leads to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: well after the GF 3@S bid NS are in a forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't have to do anything strange|pg||
nt|athene: yes true|pg||
nt|athene: how about trying a diamond from hand trying to catch west napping? if he doesn't split you can take the deep finesse trusting he has all five|pg||
nt|athene: maybe meckstroth is considering the risk of leading a spade up|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. if west had @SAx that might lead to losing a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: jan is away from the table i think|pg||
nt|athene: but you play enough hearts to find out he can't have that|pg||

nt|athene: clearly NS are in a forcing pass position after game-forcing; do they play inverted doubles? or is double of 4@H saying "let's defend 4@H"?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X is a slam try in @C|pg||
nt|athene: ah right ok|pg||
nt|athene: always hard to diagnose a grand based on two running suits and controls|pg||

nt|runnerup:  both tables bid this -good quelity |pg||

mb|4D!|nt|bobh1: hamman has support but not enough values for a direct raise|pg||
nt|algraves:  forcing NT, one of the hand types is a weak heart raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: nice trump support|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@D key card in @C|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|bobh1: hurd is 4333 but with prime high cards|pg||

nt|algraves:  2 key cards, no Queen of @C|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5N|nt|algraves:  3@H limit of better in principle|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: declarer's problem is more a death of tricks than the bad trump break|pg||
nt|algraves:  Grand slam try asking more information|pg||
nt|algraves:  so Cheek, knows that his partner has neither Major King|pg||
nt|ady: maybe some sort of asking bid in diamonds?|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: but i think he can manage|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  no ! assume more key card, ie asking for informatino|pg||
nt|algraves:  I suspect 5NT showed interest as he could have bid 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: 5d asked for kings|pg||
nt|algraves:  So this showed the Kick back method of asking for Key cards, ie one above agreed trumps to advantage|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
nt|bobh1: Zia @C play is not popular with the naysayers|pg||
nt|algraves:  easier when you can see all 4 hands and are in the back row|pg||
nt|bobh1: of course we can all see much more of the deal than Zia can|pg||
nt|algraves:  but that is the kibitizers long held right|pg||
nt|algraves:  without Oscar the Owl the game would be poorer|pg||
nt|bobh1: Zia plays MUD it appears|pg||
nt|bobh1: this may be a source of confusion for Joel|pg||
nt|bobh1: normally a player leading the 5 then playing the 9 would have the Q|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a timed event but long pauses for thought are normal and permitted|pg||
nt|bobh1: when they start to add up, the director starts getting nasty|pg||
nt|algraves:  Well Woldridge can build a club trick with the right view but that is hardly clear|pg||
nt|bobh1: no timers...if the table is slow, then we start arguing about whose fault it was|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|danilo1: once Zia led @C (and not @HK), he is doing best to continue - and force declarer's @C decision immediatelly (he may have led from Q95(2)) ... after all, East did not Dble 4@S ... ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: and he is "known" to have probably @HQ (no @H lead) and 5 trumps|pg||

mb|2H|an|3 !ss|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bigtrain: 2@H shows invite values without @S|pg||

mb|p|pc|h8|nt|athene: but on a normal trump break that would be necessary|pg||

nt|runnerup:  4 @s bye west looks good contract -but bye east not so good and hopeless this time of course |pg||

nt|algraves:  for instance on that hand some standard experts would raise to 2@H to make their game auction easier in case partner has strong hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|algraves:  playing precision you know partner is limited so game in unlikely unless partner can start jumping aroudn|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  so 1@S muddies the waters a little bit more than 2@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|algraves:  just to finish for board 20 , I suspect that declarer also took the 4th club and then led a diamond to his QT. The defense had no answer to that line|pg||
