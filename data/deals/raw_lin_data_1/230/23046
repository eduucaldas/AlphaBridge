nt|kit: In fact, if spades are never played I can envision West getting end-played and the contract making!|pg||
nt|kit: If the defense continues hearts -- West won't have an exit if he leads the fourth heart|pg||
nt|kit: What I am envisioning is:  heart to queen and ace, high diamond to ace, heart to king, heart to jack, 3 rounds of diamonds.  If West then plays his last heart, I think declarer can ...|pg||

mb|2N|an|16+, bal, <3 hearts|nt|kit: looks like 3NT has better chances|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|kit: But maybe not -- diamond lead will eventually set up the long diamond, and I don't think declarer can use the long spades|pg||

nt|kit: sorry, when led from declarer's hand|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: is he ready for it?  It doesn't appear so -- and that may tip declarer off about the spade position|pg||
nt|kit: Shows the importance of thinking ahead -- when that dummy hits, North should be thinking:  What will I do if the 9 of spades comes at me.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Levin has asked for time to think about the whole hand.  |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|kit: yes, but that is basically giving it away|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: however, declarer didn't pick it up -- and now it looks like the defense wins out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Levin was away from the table after he led (knowing Howard would think a while) and returned just as the spade nine was led|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|kit: actually I guess it still comes home|pg||
nt|kit: 4 spades, 3 diamonds, 1 club, 1 heart -- and defense can't set up both a heart trick and a diamond trick in time|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: oops -- and now the defense is one step ahead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: basically, declarer had to judge who he thought had the ace of clubs -- if south had it, his line would have been right|pg||
nt|kit: ah -- now it can make again I guess.  South would have done better to keep his diamond.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||

mc|8|nt|kit: quite the ping-pong battle -- it was a question of who made the last mistake|pg||
