nt|bobh1: no timers...if the table is slow, then we start arguing about whose fault it was|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|danilo1: once Zia led @C (and not @HK), he is doing best to continue - and force declarer's @C decision immediatelly (he may have led from Q95(2)) ... after all, East did not Dble 4@S ... ...|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|an|1|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|leo lasota: since 6H going down on the 41 splits requires bioth stiff in toher major AND ace harts in specific hand, it is better than 6S, which only requires stiff little heart in either hand|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 6NT exceeds both majors though|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but of course 6nt is best ; well done by grue/cheek|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|algraves:  the big club players these days have developed a keen eye for what auctions make it hard for the opponents to bid accurately|pg||
nt|algraves:  for instance on that hand some standard experts would raise to 2@H to make their game auction easier in case partner has strong hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|petergill: 2NT showed exactly 3 spades, hence E knew that they had a 5-3 spade fit. I'm not sure how West asks for @HQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|algraves:  playing precision you know partner is limited so game in unlikely unless partner can start jumping aroudn|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  so 1@S muddies the waters a little bit more than 2@H|pg||
nt|petergill: I think with his good 19 count, West intended 5@S as a queen ask, but when it's Hamman who passes 5@S, one tends to think that Hamman is usually right |pg||
nt|algraves:  we are not quite sure what the deeper meaning of the last bid was. but 6@H or 6NT are easy makes so an opportunity for Spector|pg||
nt|algraves:  I bet they are irritated though. That much we know for sure|pg||
mb|3D|nt|algraves:  just to finish for board 20 , I suspect that declarer also took the 4th club and then led a diamond to his QT. The defense had no answer to that line|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are splitting up later this year. Hamman will play with Justin Lall in another team and Levin-Weinstein will replace Zia - Hamman in the much-heralded famous Nickell team |pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|algraves:  Grue likes to open NT type hands with NT more so than almost any expert around these days|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S    invitational it seems|pg||
nt|algraves:  when planning your auction always focus on the likely games|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|algraves:  that is key card in Hearts|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|algraves:  I suspect that 3NT was " forward going "|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves:  he knows that Zia has a singleton for his bidding|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes many pairs have followed the Italian style of responding after overcalls which involves picking out specific invitational or better type hands so that if the opps pre empt in the overcalled suit, then partner is well placed to compete|pg||

mb|d|nt|algraves:  well 1@H is lower|pg||
mb|1H|nt|algraves:  south has normal opener for their limited precision 1D style|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H has lower risk than 2@H (no -800) and does not tell the opponents that you are weak |pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: e/w   might make 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  they would bid zero hearts for the lead if they could but you have to bid at least 1 I understand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobh1: i imagine their range is 14-16|pg||
nt|petergill: Joel Wooldridge prefers Dbl of 1@H to 1@S|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: that seems to be the popular range among these young tigers|pg||
mb|3C|nt|algraves:  requires @D lead to defeat 3NT if my double dummy analysis is correct|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  Well the feeling " on the street" was that this was going to be a close well played match|pg||
nt|ady: yesz  should lose 3 diamonds and 2 aces|pg||
nt|algraves:  note the effect of the NS bidding . it made it very hard on EW to have a sure footed auctino|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Raising the hearts which South showed by doubling 1@H|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|ady: did 3@H  promise anything   was a leb bid available after east doubled 2 spades?|pg||
nt|petergill: Should be 130|pg||
pc|h2|nt|algraves:  of course you need to be playing a strong club to give you cover on hans like this , so that the non one club openers are limited to 15|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts hopeless|pg||
nt|ady: is this lead true?|pg||
nt|algraves:  so one can argue wether West should have bid , the point was that NS just doing there normal bidding made it difficult to sort everything out.|pg||
nt|algraves:  They play Rusinow in bid suits|pg||
nt|petergill: or he might play "safe" (unsafe if clubs 4-1) for 110 by not trying the @D hook|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|algraves:  and why not lead a @S?|pg||
nt|algraves:  got to lead something|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|petergill: Al, can you see why @SQ is a good play here?|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot, but if Zia is doing it, there must be a reason|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|algraves:  remember the @D bid just said no 5 card major not 14-16 balanced not 6 clubs|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|ady: seems a diamond lead more normal than underleading 5 card suit with the ace|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bobh1: if it was 15-17, S would invite|pg||
nt|algraves:  well, Grue judged to lead the suit the partnership was known to have, and put declarer to potential guess at trick one.|pg||
nt|ady: whatever led    no chance to make|pg||
nt|algraves:  if King in dummy declarer may well get it wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl makes @DK likely to be offside, so there was a real danger of a @D ruff if @D was played at Trick 2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|algraves:  personally I like the dash of that lead even though it cost a trick|pg||
nt|algraves:  even though it did not gain a trick|pg||
nt|algraves:  did not cost |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it cost  |pg||
nt|petergill: Even with @DK onside, a @D ruff was posible if the @D hook was taken|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 57 - good aggressive bidding by Meckwell gained|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 55 - Nickell team was unlucky, with a lot of imps at stake|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 54 - superior bidding by Hurd - Wooldridge gained|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 52  Zia - Hamman's bidding went off the rails, but we do not know what the bids should mean|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 51 - superior bidding and play by Hurd- Wooldridge|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49 - excellent bidding judgement by Meckstroth gained|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 47 - bad lie of cards (@HK under AQ) for Meckwell who took bidding risk that backfired|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 46 - Cheek made a game - Zia's line of play which failed at this table looks OK to me, and the computer was down so we don't know how Cheek played it, but he did well|pg||
nt|petergill: Overall Summary - very high quality bridge - just one big slip up on Bd 52. Spector team deserved their segment win. Here in Australia at our top level, we make far more errors ...|pg||
