mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|kit: Garner has no idea which suits his partner has -- for starters he thinks it may be hearts and clubs and the hand is a big misfit.  Once hearts are raised, now he knows and may bid ...|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S even at adverse vulnerability.|pg||
nt|kit: Greco will probably make a forcing pass -- and if Hampson then bids 5@C, they might actually get the the right slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: One really big inference everyone has now is that garner has @ss and likely @ds as well since he didnt know what suita partner has|pg||
nt|poohbear: no safety in hearts or clubs|pg||
nt|kit: They may play pass/double inversion here, where double is like a forcing pass and pass requests double.  I'm not sure if they do or not.|pg||
nt|kit: I can't believe it is taking Greco this long to take some action.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson and Weinstein wrote notes, but I'm guessing about the delay :)|pg||
mb|d|an|= forcing pass|mb|p|nt|kit: This is probably the pass/double inversion -- so the double is like a forcing pass|pg||
mb|5C|nt|petergill: I'm back on planet Earth now. 3NT has 8 top tricks with many chances for a 9th on a club lead, or an auto 9th on a @H lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I think Hampson just wrote "both slow" :)|pg||
nt|kit: Which is consistent with Hampson's 5@C call.  But Greco can't know they aren't off the first 2 spade tricks, so I don't think he can bid the slam.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Garner asking about the DBL - Greco "like a forcing pass"|pg||
mb|5S|nt|kit: This looks like just a poor bid to me -- gives opponents a fielders choice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Meanwhile, on the other side of the screen, Hampson is writing a lot; I can't quite read it|pg||
nt|kit: Now they just might fall into the slam, since Greco has more reason to expect his partner to have a stiff spade and he can almost call off the entire hand.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Does pass/dbl inversion apply the second time Kit?|pg||

nt|kit: Well, something like that -- maybe it doesn't show shortness immediately|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I think that's what Hampson wrote :) (what Kit said that is)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Dbl = spades - EW play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
mb|4C!|an|!c SPL|nt|kit: I'm sure Greco has shown a stiff club now.  Hampson has to like that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Presumably 1@S by East would have shown only 3 card support for the 4+ spades Dbl|pg||
mb|4S!|an|RKC !hs|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|petergill: Repeated spade leads will promote @HJ, and with the lack of entries to dummy, this looks like -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaker:  entries seem tight to set up clubs and reverse the dummy. diamonds can't be misguessed|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 4@S is RKC, 4NT 0- or 3|pg||
nt|kit: Well done.  It won't be easy to play, but as the cards lie any line should work.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I THINK what I now have in the bidding box for 3@S and 4@cis right, but not 100% (3NT showed some shortness, 4@c showed club splinter)|pg||
nt|jaker:  trumps 2-2, all minor suit honors onside and k of clubs coming down, and spades 4-3. can't ask more than that|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: I think the right line is to establish the long club -- planning on ruffing 3 clubs in dummy, so taking 2 clubs, 3 spades, and 7 hearts|pg||
nt|kit: He can afford to ruff the third club high, so this will work if clubs 4-3 and hearts no worse than 3-1.|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think you need 4-3 @ss as well Kit. No entries|pg||
nt|kit: However, on the spade lead the entries might not be there for this approach|pg||
nt|kit: so what is the right line?  I have no idea, and apparently neither does Hampson.|pg||
nt|jaker:  if he wins this trick in dummy, club, c ruff, spade to k, club ruff, heart ace, heart to q, club ruff, pitch d and play d he might still have to deal with the 10 of hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Right -- I don't think he can set up clubs conveniently after the spade lead.  So perhaps just try to drop king-third of clubs, with diamond guess in reserve.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson has his head on the table, thinking ... now got back into playing position to take another look at dummy|pg||
nt|kit: That is the best I can come up with.  Any improvements?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Now leaning back in his chair and moving cards in his hand around, presumably considering order of play|pg||
nt|jaker:  where do you think he should win this trick, kit?|pg||
nt|kit: I think he has to win in dummy for this approach|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jaker:  I agree with that, but it does lead to some complications on bad breaks|pg||
nt|kit: it looks like he will be following my line since he did win in dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: back to moving cards from one hand to the other, guess he's making sure he likes the line he's chosen|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest:  another possibility. yes|pg||
nt|kit: Will Weinstein let him off the hook?  Seems like he should.|pg||
nt|joest:  this auction screams to be passed  :)|pg||
nt|kit: This sort of situation illustrates why screens are a must.  |pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein must know that 5@C bid is impossible since North passed hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: both of them wrote fairly long notes, but I can't quite read them (they are writing with pens, but I guess I need to give them pens with darker ink :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: In 4@C, 4 top spades would allow East to pitch two @d's, leading to an overruffing position in @D|pg||
nt|petergill: When I commented on Segment 4 of the Nickell - Spector match, we mentioned as Spector won the set by about 55 imps that Meckwell are famous for their comebacks|pg||

nt|petergill: When pitching in East's position, you always try to pitch so as to create overruffing positions, i.e. not pitch long hearts|pg||

mb|4H|an|cue bid|nt|kit: Since South doesn't have to have clubs for the 1@C call, South knows there is a huge fit.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: HW: "if you doubled with a 4333 11, you got me"|pg||
mb|1D|an|4+ !ds, usually unbalanced|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: I think 4@C was some version of Last Train|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Vugraphzfh: HW & GH discussing 3N on the previous board|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C!|an|5 !cs, extra values|nt|petergill: Looks likes Nickell will win, 12 imps up with good scores to come on Bds 118 and (about to be) Bd 119 at Grue's table|pg||
nt|petergill: Anyway, it was good bidding to a thin 6@h and they sure earned their 1430|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: Greco going slowly -- he might have bid 4@S immediately|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzfh: This is the last board of this set. The second set is scheduled to start in 15 minutes. Both matches are playing the same boards, so we won't be able to start Vugraph until both ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: have started - but the director may pull boards if one table is behind, so I don't know exactly when we'll restart|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|petergill: If @H lead to jack, should S duck?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson: "I wouldn't mind hearing one more round of clubs"|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: If S does not duck, 3NT is down, so duck looks best. But after the duck, how can there be 9 tricks? Aha, need @CJ onside. Unlucky. |pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: greco just drove it in -- looks reasonable.  And he will make, ruffing a diamond in dummy and taking 8 spades, 1 heart, 1 diamond.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco: "card there is standard?" HW: "yes, all of our carding is standard except UD discarding"|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: East might get squeezed here|pg||
nt|petergill: A great finish to their partnership by Martel and Stansby - 6@h and this interesting play hand|pg||
nt|petergill: If West doesn't cash the hearts, he will never get them, but if he does cash the hearts, then|pg||
nt|petergill: both dummy and East have tough pitches on the hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: If West does not cash hearts, declarer is low on tricks|pg||
