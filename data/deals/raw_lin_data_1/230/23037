nt|joest:  particularly when he finds out who has the ace of hearts|pg||

nt|joest:  of course if Howard cashes the ace of hearts, declarer will win some continuation cash the spade king and lead a club up.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|joest:  feels like e-w will be pushed up to 5@h|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|joest:  1NT = constructive raise to 2@h|pg||

mb|4S|nt|joest:  so I think this just boils down to how lucky you feel|pg||
nt|joest:  and in fairness, his parnter has all the wrong values for him|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Levin can bid again   , ..|pg||
nt|joest:  crying out 6@h right here is not ridiculous in my view even though I see it works out horribly|pg||

nt|joest:  but i could be wrong.  It might easily just be RKCB|pg||
mb|5H|nt|joest:  if garner is thinking it obviously means he's not 100% sure what 4NT is|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Like the most partnerships ...  |pg||
nt|joest:  so this is obviously a rejection and he didn't treat 4NT as blackwood|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Levin might bid again ,..|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:  yes one purpose of 4NT is to set up forcing passes|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: no agreement about 4NT - was either KC or ambiguous says Howard; "I didn't know how he would take it"|pg||
nt|dkkello:  difficult lead  |pg||

mb|3N|an|4 of mionr preempt|nt|dkkello:  and 6 @S :)|pg||

nt|joest:  usually you can tell which one partner has...but not this time|pg||
nt|dkkello:  no!|pg||
nt|joest:  a very difficult call for Weinstein|pg||
nt|joest:  he might just try 4@s (to play?)|pg||
nt|joest:  not clear where his tricks are coming from|pg||
nt|joest:  he can't bid 5@c b/c that risks a correction to 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  who knows what 4NT is?|pg||
nt|joest:  and he could bid 4@d pass or correct but he might fear he is missing something if 4@d gets passed out|pg||
nt|joest:  so I am curious to see what Steve does.  This is very hard imho|pg||
nt|dkkello:  very difficult|pg||
nt|joest:  so I'm told 4NT is 'slam try in a minor".  |pg||
nt|joest:  fair enough.  But you do have a slam try in clubs but not in diamonds :)|pg||
nt|joest:  here is what I do know|pg||
nt|joest:  Steve Weinstein, who knows what all the bids mean|pg||
nt|joest:  is not sure what to do :)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|joest:  meanwhile back at the ranch, Stansby-martel did not misdefend 4@h so Fleisher picks up 12 on board 84|pg||

nt|joest:  ok thx joe|pg||
