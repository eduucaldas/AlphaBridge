nt|ahollan1: this is final 15 boards of the day  but 4x15 boards tomorrow to complete the Semi-Final matches|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i suspect meck will bid 2@C as its the most flexible|pg||
nt|kareno: Milner has come back some from their large deficit at the 30 board stage|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps Zia thought that, with partner likely to have only 3 trumps on the auction, a trump lead might pick up partner's trump holding of say, QJx or KJx which might not otherwise ...|pg||
nt|petergill: be picked up|pg||
nt|petergill: so it might be better to go for heart overruffs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Phil Clayton|pg||
nt|phil: hi Roland, Hi Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia is more likely to picture Hamman with @SA than @DA|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Phil|pg||
nt|phil: other table is in 2@c x'd after Meck doubled 1@s|pg||
nt|petergill: Justin Lall opened 11! at the other table, as i would ahve, so 2CX is the contract there|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|bigtrain: 1NT response to 1@D is normal but may be a bit stronger than other play it|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|phil: yes, he has a load of defense|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Hamman's low spades were suit pref signals that he had @DA|pg||
nt|phil: so easy 500 against 4@s - not a disaster|pg||
nt|petergill: Looks like 500 here|pg||

pc|cK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h8|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|phil: yes - 300 if he hooks the club and plays for 2-2|pg||
nt|phil: which he should- Hamman is counted out|pg||
nt|petergill: Justin LAll led a spade to 2@CX - perhaps the "lead trumps against partscore" idea is out of date - admittedly @CKQx is dangerous to lead from, especially if ace is on your right|pg||
nt|phil: I thought he might lead a low club - hoping for AJ9x on his left|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer can count out the hand and deduce that trumps are 2-2 now|pg||
nt|phil: in the 1st quarter, Kranyak played a 3N that felt like it took the length of an evening sitcom|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree, Peter.  I think he'll play a @C to the Jack and if it loses, ruff a @H with the 10 of @C's|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 3NT by North is interesting after a spade to the ace and a small one back|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|an|shortness; both minors|nt|phil: looks like they found that defense in the OR? |pg||

nt|phil: yep - very nice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Almost|pg||
nt|Walddk4: spade to the king and a spade, and Rodwell misguessed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1NT asks for controls|pg||

nt|kit: I don't know if 2@S is forcing or not here|pg||
nt|dougs: 2s is non-forcing|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bigtrain: 2@S shows 0-2 controls (A=2 K=1)|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult for N-S to find their heart fit|pg||
nt|warrens:  this bid will keep them out of 3NT.  need to get to 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: greco hampson play big club|pg||

nt|bigtrain: i have no idea who the players are - although  suspect /ew are meckwell :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: the operator will put them  in when time is available|pg||
nt|phil: 3@s is useful, but how do you work out South's shape now ? |pg||
mb|4N|nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  4@H is probably kickback in @D's |pg||
mb|5C|nt|warrens:  4NT shows 1/4|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@C asks Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: why can't John be 1=3=3=6 or 1=4=3=5? |pg||
mb|6C|nt|bigtrain: looks to be -1 with the 4th round uppercut|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder what North's heart signal means here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: when N to bid @H ? (I do not see)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|petergill: other table: After West's Dbl (did North see it? or think the dbl must be a psyche?), one would expect 3Nt to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Declarer will have to try another trump now I think, since he knows there is a diamond ruff out against him.  he needs 2-2 trumps and some help in spade suit.|pg||
nt|kit: but he might try queen of spades and hope opponents don't get diamond ruff.|pg||
nt|kit: As it turns out there is no diamond ruff for them, but he can't know that.  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: we can see all lines doomed but E still has hopes|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  6@C will show Q and K of @C's (and no other K)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: Dbl of Strong Club did not show any points, so North went with the odds|pg||
nt|warrens:  this would be a good contract if North had one more @C|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't think there's any chance here with clubs this way|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm guess a trump back, since N has shown the Q of @D's|pg||
nt|phil: cant he ruff two spades and establish the 5th club for two heart pitches? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes he can|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA play (play the card you are known to hold) might lead to declarer taking a ruffing @S finesse through East, on other layouts|pg||
nt|warrens:  Oh, I take it back.  He can make it if he can score 6 trump tricks.|pg||
nt|warrens:  Needs 2 @s ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jaapfr: now @S expected by N|pg||
nt|kit: Now South has to work out the hand, which he should be able to do -- and not play ace of diamonds.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this @D returns troubles S a bit|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|kit: North thought he might have to lead diamond if declarer had Ax I think.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he did well|pg||
nt|jaapfr: S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but @S by N then it was sure down imo|pg||
nt|kit: So now declarer will presumably try to cash king of spades and just go down.  Nothing works anyway.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|d5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|phil: so win @cK, ruff spade, trump to hand, ruff last spade, last trump to hand, draw trump (pitch heart), club, club ruff, etc..  |pg||
nt|petergill: Now @DK then @d to hand - if @D are 4-1, need clubs 3-3 or squeeze|pg||
nt|phil: true thats better|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Gavin is thinking that @D to hand is better than my line now if trumps are 5-0|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|bigtrain: andy, would you prefer i ask roland to get added to voice?  or have both voice nd written covered?|pg||

nt|jaapfr: then too tough for defense @SAx@S to Q and @D return to defeat|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: Seems like this line gives defense a chance with trump shift, but Meckstroth deduced that this would be impossible to find.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Still, I don't see how ducking the diamond gains declarer anything.  On diamond continuation, he will still have to play AKQ of hearts and hope hearts split, I think.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you guess spades. 4 spades, 2 diamonds and 3 clubs. The defence can't take more than two heart tricks, and if they play too many hearts, you have 2 tricks there|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: and along the way you'll get a good count for the spade hook|pg||

nt|dburn: not sure from this auction whether East-West knew they had a spade fit and rejected it, or never knew they had it|pg||
nt|phil: yes - it looked like Hamman just chose to make a quantitative invite - although I do not know what a direct 2N would be over 1N|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's not usually a good sign when you double and you can't decide what to do at trick 2|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: some play that an immediate 2@s over 1NT is invitational with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: screen down; Kranyak asking about auction; Zia could have 4 spades for 1NT and could have shown them over 2NT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|jaapfr: y agree|pg||
nt|bt: ruffing low heart then high heart maybe |pg||
nt|kit: Maybe he thinks he can afford to ruff a heart (guarding against 5-2), and it will be difficult for defense to separate everything.  But I don't think he can afford to risk that.|pg||
nt|po-s: better to ask before doubling - not that it would have helped|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now he might be able to test hearts first and won't need to guess spades. Kranyak must duck the heart to give Zia a losing option|pg||
nt|dburn: the good news, I suppose, is that Kranyak may only be on play twice more - the bad news is that the second of those occasions may well be on Friday|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's Friday already where we are, David|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chip: I'd guess this sequnce showed invitational with 5H, but 2C then 2S would be invitational 4-5. Perhaps Bob thought if Zia didn't want to bid 1S, then NT would be better.|pg||
nt|po-s: He should be so lucky if he is playing on Friday|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He will, we are only half way through after this set|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he will be playing on Friday except in some very unlikely and unfortunate event - Saturday is less certain|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|jaapfr: S no entry for @H trumping now|pg||

nt|petergill: I disagree with P.O. I think Hamman did great to realize that his queen-high red suits and lack of aces made 4 losers possible in a 4-4 spade fit. Zia did great to realize that his ...|pg||
nt|petergill: whole hand (possibility of deep spade losers, queens and jacks elsewhere) meant that any 4-4 spade fit was not worth finding|pg||

nt|kit: West has difficult hand to bid over 1@D opening.  Overcallling on 4-card major has a lot of pitfalls.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a typical 3rd hand 1@D (although lousy cards:)|pg||
nt|dougs: 2@c is either a club suit or clubs with a spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2NT is an art @H raise|pg||
nt|kit: the 1@D opening is basically a weak NT, but can find a major-suit fit.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jaapfr: pls stop thinking else 1100|pg||

nt|jaapfr: you think W could X 3@H?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see why West should double.  For all he knows, opponents have 9-card fit.|pg||
nt|kit: East might have doubled, but he doesn't know his partner has clubs under control.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he never could show his 14 hcp|pg||
nt|warrens:  a psychic double by Kranyak?|pg||
nt|phil: very Zia-esque|pg||
nt|chip: In the other room they opened a strong club with the W hand, then got a 3D preempt.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he did double (Kranyak)|pg||
nt|petergill: Quite a week for the Wolpert family. Gavin's mum Hazel is playing in the finals of the Canadian Women's Trials, his brother Darren is playing the semi final of the Canadian Open ...|pg||

nt|dburn: this is quite a lot of bidding for Hamman to be doing - wouldn't blame Zia for just Blackwooding into slam now|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dburn: which is the @sJ away from being a good contract, and the @s109 away from being a terrible one|pg||

nt|bt: say a diamond lead you make it |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: Actually, 4@S isn't down yet|pg||
nt|dburn: Nickell disinclined to bid very much at all, and quite right too in theory - 4@s is a rotten contract|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|chip: now making 6, so an IMP back to Nickell.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|jaapfr: in previous session i suggested that EW do play and bid primarily tactically (tough to analyze but based on their incredible experience)|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|kit: He will ruff club trying to strip out East's exits, but East will still have a club exit|pg||
nt|bt: so rodwell avoided the diamond lead, heart lead gives it some play|pg||
nt|kit: Or he may just lead diamond now, hoping East has KQ or honor doubleton.  Those are his choices.|pg||
nt|bt: i think full credit is due for the trump lead|pg||
nt|bt: nicely done|pg||
nt|bt: i confess that i might have lead a diamond|pg||
nt|kit: Not me -- why lead away from an honor when there doesn't appear to be threats of discards in dummy.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bt: well there was a discard, only it was in clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1 to play  Spector over Nickell by 41|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: had to play @DK x@C for down 1|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure of the range here - is that an upgraded strong no trump, or maybe they use 14-16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Nickell:  "that is a hand you want to be NV; you also want to be not doubled"   Katz:  "you want to be non declarer"|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|chip: In the other room E jumped all the way to 6C after his partner overcalled 2C. Seems a bit much to me, though a better partner would have had a stiff spade (1-4-2-6)|pg||
mb|r|mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: many big clubbers  open North hand, but NS 1st action tend to be sound|pg||
nt|chip: 1N is 15-17 in theory, seems rather weird to me here. Yes, 3rd seat, but vulnerable with a good lead??|pg||
mb|3H|mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16  but this is atypical shape :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not unexpected -- but not typical |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Wolpert has "garbage Stayman" in his bag, so used it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I'm not sure of NT range but I'd guess 14-16|pg||
nt|dburn: and Katz, with one of the less desirable hands to lead from, made a strange-looking but logical choice|pg||
nt|dburn: the upshot of all of which looks to be down one and a couple more to Milner, but Kranyak has yet to earn them|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: this 2@S much easier to make:)|pg||
nt|chip: I have sympathy for the DBL, though if S raised hearts instead of XX, N might have bid 5H (though that goes down, so still a swing to EW.)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||

nt|bt: of all |pg||
pc|sT|nt|dougs: 2@S was natural or a max heart raise with shortness|pg||
nt|bt: so opposite a non-practiced partner, avoid sequences like the one they had|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: maybe more on offer now|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|chip: Kib asks about spade lead (at both tables), they figure E must be void in H to bid this way.|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: a very thin slam but unlikely to be bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: rodwell's TOX may aid in keeping them low|pg||
nt|kit: not at this point, for sure|pg||
mb|d|nt|dougs: 2@h is 24+ balanced or a minor gf|pg||
nt|dburn: lots of bidding at the other table, where Meckwell reached a game not even a mother could love|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: better to have 4th trump for 2@D bid??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: needs only both major queens well placed so max 25% slam!|pg||

nt|dougs: if lall would have passed, meck would have bid 2@h |pg||

nt|phil: nice job Joe this week (in both roles :))|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i've been argueing that point with him|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: OR was a bit more active, but still lebensol from W|pg||
nt|bt: unlikely as it is|pg||
nt|dougs: 3@D is @h invite plus|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, though even DD there are more tricks than trumps here (despite the majors being impure, thought the minors are pure).|pg||
nt|phil: 5N now? |pg||
nt|warrens:  tough call for North now with only Kx|pg||
nt|chip: I think 6C with only 2 spades, though that will give S a bit of a problem.|pg||
nt|phil: over 6@c, would 6@d say 'choose a major'? |pg||
nt|chip: The problem with 6C by N is that N could have very good clubs (say AKQJTx).|pg||
nt|chip: Not sure if S could have made a forcing pass over 5D. |pg||
nt|chip: many pairs play that after preempt-Bid-5X that pass is forcing (particularly when they are NV). Helps the non-preempt side sort things out.|pg||
nt|phil: spec asking about 6@d now - that really sounds like a grand try to me |pg||
mb|5N|nt|rodal f: The best force bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: someone commented that they are within the clock (still 8 minutes).  Kranyak:  "we won't finish on time; don't worry"|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: 6D by N is not a possible bid (it would suggest better spades than Kx).  Kib asks if S would bid 6S over a slow 6C bid, and the answer is maybe not. Over 5N will bid 6S I think.|pg||
mb|6S|nt|jaapfr: 2@D 3@S-4@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree with 2@S bid?|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice bid but what would josephine say about it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thanks for letting me jump in  Andy/Walter|pg||
mb|7C|nt|ahollan1: this probably rates as a minimum 1N bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: RD=first control to come?|pg||
nt|chip: 6D by N would be a grand slam try in spades (and would make it impossible to get to 6C) so would never be bid.|pg||
mb|7H|nt|rodal f: Came|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 14-16 1nt|pg||
nt|phil: something about 7@c contracts today for the Milner team....|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: U have slam in NT - @H - @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will Greco make a new try?|pg||
nt|chip: This is the third grand slam today where Hamman is on lead with an ace. Must be a record out of only 30 hands.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|rodal f: One IMP gained for Jacobs. |pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: sorry i am lost about EW bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: club can't go away.|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, Zia on lead. I meant Hamman was on lead versus 7C.|pg||
nt|phil: all I can say is Steve Weinsteins and Kevin Fays series on Bridgewinners "Under Further Review" is getting lots of material from today|pg||
nt|warrens:  amazingly, only needed one small difference in South's hand to make 7@H: AQ10xxxx, QJ9x, xx, --|pg||
nt|ritong: they have a thread about grands missing the trump ace|pg||
nt|chip: 5n was meant as choice of slam I'm pretty sure. then used it as a choice of grand slams.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|phil: ok, good match everyone - see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: By all:)|pg||
