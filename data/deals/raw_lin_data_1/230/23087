mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Dbl take-out|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|kit: Garner has no idea which suits his partner has -- for starters he thinks it may be hearts and clubs and the hand is a big misfit.  Once hearts are raised, now he knows and may bid ...|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S even at adverse vulnerability.|pg||
nt|kit: Greco will probably make a forcing pass -- and if Hampson then bids 5@C, they might actually get the the right slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: One really big inference everyone has now is that garner has @ss and likely @ds as well since he didnt know what suita partner has|pg||
nt|poohbear: no safety in hearts or clubs|pg||
nt|kit: They may play pass/double inversion here, where double is like a forcing pass and pass requests double.  I'm not sure if they do or not.|pg||
nt|kit: I can't believe it is taking Greco this long to take some action.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson and Weinstein wrote notes, but I'm guessing about the delay :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|kit: This is probably the pass/double inversion -- so the double is like a forcing pass|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: I'm back on planet Earth now. 3NT has 8 top tricks with many chances for a 9th on a club lead, or an auto 9th on a @H lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I think Hampson just wrote "both slow" :)|pg||
nt|kit: Which is consistent with Hampson's 5@C call.  But Greco can't know they aren't off the first 2 spade tricks, so I don't think he can bid the slam.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Garner asking about the DBL - Greco "like a forcing pass"|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: This looks like just a poor bid to me -- gives opponents a fielders choice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Meanwhile, on the other side of the screen, Hampson is writing a lot; I can't quite read it|pg||
nt|kit: Now they just might fall into the slam, since Greco has more reason to expect his partner to have a stiff spade and he can almost call off the entire hand.|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|d4|pc|c5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: The idea behind pass/double inversion is that it gives you 2 ways to handle hands where you know you want to compete -- you can bid directly, or you can pass and then pull ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaker:  interesting play problem in 6h|pg||
nt|kit: Well, something like that -- maybe it doesn't show shortness immediately|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I think that's what Hampson wrote :) (what Kit said that is)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: Dbl = spades - EW play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: I'm sure Greco has shown a stiff club now.  Hampson has to like that.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: Presumably 1@S by East would have shown only 3 card support for the 4+ spades Dbl|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|petergill: Repeated spade leads will promote @HJ, and with the lack of entries to dummy, this looks like -1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jaker:  entries seem tight to set up clubs and reverse the dummy. diamonds can't be misguessed|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|kit: 4@S is RKC, 4NT 0- or 3|pg||
nt|kit: Well done.  It won't be easy to play, but as the cards lie any line should work.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I THINK what I now have in the bidding box for 3@S and 4@cis right, but not 100% (3NT showed some shortness, 4@c showed club splinter)|pg||
nt|jaker:  trumps 2-2, all minor suit honors onside and k of clubs coming down, and spades 4-3. can't ask more than that|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: I think the right line is to establish the long club -- planning on ruffing 3 clubs in dummy, so taking 2 clubs, 3 spades, and 7 hearts|pg||
nt|kit: He can afford to ruff the third club high, so this will work if clubs 4-3 and hearts no worse than 3-1.|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think you need 4-3 @ss as well Kit. No entries|pg||
nt|kit: However, on the spade lead the entries might not be there for this approach|pg||
nt|kit: so what is the right line?  I have no idea, and apparently neither does Hampson.|pg||
nt|jaker:  if he wins this trick in dummy, club, c ruff, spade to k, club ruff, heart ace, heart to q, club ruff, pitch d and play d he might still have to deal with the 10 of hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Right -- I don't think he can set up clubs conveniently after the spade lead.  So perhaps just try to drop king-third of clubs, with diamond guess in reserve.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson has his head on the table, thinking ... now got back into playing position to take another look at dummy|pg||
nt|kit: That is the best I can come up with.  Any improvements?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Now leaning back in his chair and moving cards in his hand around, presumably considering order of play|pg||
nt|jaker:  where do you think he should win this trick, kit?|pg||
nt|kit: I think he has to win in dummy for this approach|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|jaker:  I agree with that, but it does lead to some complications on bad breaks|pg||
nt|kit: it looks like he will be following my line since he did win in dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: back to moving cards from one hand to the other, guess he's making sure he likes the line he's chosen|pg||

nt|joest:  this auction screams to be passed  :)|pg||
nt|kit: This sort of situation illustrates why screens are a must.  |pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein must know that 5@C bid is impossible since North passed hand|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: In 4@C, 4 top spades would allow East to pitch two @d's, leading to an overruffing position in @D|pg||

nt|petergill: When pitching in East's position, you always try to pitch so as to create overruffing positions, i.e. not pitch long hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Now defense can play only 1 round of trumps, so he will get to ruff 2 hearts in dummy and be out for down 1.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Garner, on seeing dummy: "well, they weren't doubling on trumps"|pg||

mb|3C|nt|kit: Since South doesn't have to have clubs for the 1@C call, South knows there is a huge fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Competing to 4m over 3M is in general unusual stategy, but at nil vul the cost is low if both contracts fail|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: the more I think about it, when 60 or 70 imps down, 4@S over 2@H is very attractive indeed|pg||
nt|kit: Shame to have to pass on the East hand -- maybe afraid that if he overcalls partner will take him seriously|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|petergill: Hamman and Meckwell are the world's best at thsi "coming from behind" strategy|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|2 controls|nt|petergill: Previous hand: West can deduce from his @SKQ that North has @SA, so a low heart was best chance at Trick 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|petergill: if N misguesses, East has to guess to continue @h (normal?) or switch to spade (works)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: on previous, small spade back gives a problem as well -- has to put in jack and hope ace of diamonds is not offside if the spade jack loses to a singleton honor|pg||
nt|petergill: so the best play play at Trick 2 was a high heart through by West, to discourage @H continuation if East wins|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Garner wrote a fairly long note that inclues "to pass 2@c" so probably his pass was to play as long as HW had some fit?|pg||
mb|5N|an|pick a slam|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|petergill: Good point - thanks Joe|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The diamond back was no good if declarer had 7 clubs - perhaps West thought N might have only 6 clubs|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|kit: Following good principle of leading trumps against low-level doubled contracts, since usually your side has most of the high cards and enemy tricks will come from ruffing.|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
mc|11|nt|kit: Not enough entries to establish and run the clubs even if everything splits, so declarer trying for long diamond for another trick.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|leo lasota: very tough hand to get to the only making game of 3nt by east|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzff: thanks to the USBF ACBL BBO and Jan Martel for allowing us to broadcast this event|pg||
mb|3N|nt|leo lasota: 4 hearts goes down with 3 trump .losers and ace clubs; 3nt can be set on repeated spade leads by the defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: the lure of the 53 major suit fit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzff: back for the next set in about 1 hr 5 min -- last bd for now|pg||
nt|bobh1: nice job joe|pg||
nt|leo lasota: thanks joe for the excellent vugraph|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobh1: board 26 in the other room is taking forever|pg||
nt|bobh1: it produces a big swing but not the way we were expecting|pg||
nt|leo lasota: bad accident on bd 26 in open rm|pg||
nt|bobh1: garner also opened 2@C but it didn't work out for them|pg||
nt|leo lasota: clearly, the fact that two of the top pairs in america had difficulty with the hand is surprising|pg||
nt|bobh1: this match is not going lee's way|pg||
nt|leo lasota: nice lead by eric, but the defense still would have had time to set 3nt as long as they switched to spades when in|pg||
nt|leo lasota: reasonable gamble by Nik with all of the spot cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: hts is better spot this goes down even if HJ is pocketed...2S-2H-1C|pg||

nt|bobh1: thx all|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but low diamond may compress trumpo trick for his p|pg||
nt|leo lasota: so probably would exit spade|pg||
