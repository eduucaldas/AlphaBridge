nt|icechem:  Karl can almost clench it with a slam here|pg||
nt|ady: north not risking playing red suits for spade finesse or finesses|pg||
mb|2D|an|multi|nt|gsper:  3NT NS is not a good contract, but it seems it may make this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|icechem:  even a grand slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently the organziers of this event have not requested french commentary BUT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: neanmoins j'invite des spectateurs qui prefereraient peut-etre poser des questions en francais a le faire |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|icearif: surprise they missed a slam in other room|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: only parts score in diamonds for n/s     3NT looks to have 5 tricks of if defence is awake|pg||
mb|p|nt|icechem:  terrible bidding, had all the space to bid they wanted|pg||
nt|icechem:  JÃºlÃ­us didn't think of 4@d it seems, very descriptive|pg||
nt|icearif: yes, started with 2@C 16+ and then it seems was a misunderstanding |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|icechem:  Svenni just but on the brakes for no reason|pg||
nt|icearif: 4@D good bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gsper:  Let's see if they are|pg||
pc|s2|nt|icechem:  I am pretty sure Svenni and JÃºlli also would play that as splinter|pg||
nt|icechem:  trying for 7 even, wow|pg||
nt|icechem:  rkc would have worked better|pg||
nt|ady: this may get home on a spade lead|pg||
nt|ady: club lead defence have chances   need a heart switch   which looks likely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D = weak 2 in a  major      4D = "bid your suit"|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|icechem:  I guess sÃ¦var is screaming that he needs good @h for 7@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4C instead of 4D would be "transfer me to your suit"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: jouer ainsi 4T et 4K permet au partenariat de localiser la declaration ou que le repondant veuille|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|henryb:  I think with three small hearts Saevar is bidding too much.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gsper:  Does not even need to hit @H switch this time, I think|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|icechem:  AKJ is pretty good|pg||
nt|henryb:  If he had a doubleton heart and three diamonds this would make more sense|pg||
nt|icechem:  ah hello Henry|pg||
nt|icechem:  true|pg||
nt|henryb:  I hope you will forgive me for joining|pg||
nt|icechem:  always a big decision to bid 7 when not sure|pg||
nt|icechem:  the more the merrier|pg||
nt|icearif: tempting for Karl now to go for 7 - hi Henry :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@d must be trying for a grand since if no interest in more N would simply bid 6@s|pg||
nt|ady: even on a spade lead    no quick entry to south hand    so defence would get another chance|pg||
nt|gsper:  But it may take some fancy unblocking in @D|pg||
nt|ady: spade switch    might get home now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a lot of tricks to lose against nothing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with so many losers and soft values, N might have pursued an exploratory sequence instead to learn if S was in the upper or lower range for 2D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: assuming they have that capacity of course|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: in a proper framework for responding to 2D, one can inquire via 2N and after that still usee the double-barreled 4C/4D resources to place the declaration in the right hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|icechem:  what can SÃ¦var be looking for if not AK in @h?|pg||
nt|icechem:  like henry says, AK should be enough|pg||
nt|icearif: probably wondering- what does pd have since did not 4NT RKCB|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  Well, I would think @sAQxx might be what is needed :)|pg||
nt|icechem:  yes but why not just bid RKC with no voids|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|icearif: yes and pretty good hearts|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: if east ducks  north can play J@D     and ducj queen   then east could not damage with a heart switch|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gsper:  S should have ducked that|pg||
nt|gsper:  As it happens|pg||

nt|icechem:  yup|pg||
nt|gsper:  W is far from 2@S in their system|pg||
nt|ady: weak 2 would not work well for west|pg||
mb|p|nt|icechem:  yet another action hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  But if the opponents are going to stop in 4, you should almost never bid 7|pg||
nt|icechem:  Grant really needs to get some imps back here|pg||
nt|icearif: true :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  He does not have that, fortunately|pg||

nt|ady: 4@C?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|icechem:  looks to be a push if -1|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: opening 3C describes the hand well, especially at this vulnerability. the spade holding, which is technically 4 cards, is of course a flaw, but one that conservative preemptors ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tend to exaggerate. the N hand is so lopsided toward clubs that it will not usually play well at all in a 44 spade fit....|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Ns sequence may have indicated extras, but does he have them?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  deciding to leave well alone|pg||
nt|gsper:  Nice distribution, but @S bid behind the K|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: if pd has 5 spades you may belong in that suit, but even then if pd lacks the ace of spades 4S may be too tough because the short trump hand can get tapped early and the long clubs ...|pg||
