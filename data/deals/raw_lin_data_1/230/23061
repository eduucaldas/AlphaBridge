nt|icechem:  Karl can almost clench it with a slam here|pg||
nt|ady: north not risking playing red suits for spade finesse or finesses|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gsper:  3NT NS is not a good contract, but it seems it may make this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|icechem:  even a grand slam|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|icearif: surprise they missed a slam in other room|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: only parts score in diamonds for n/s     3NT looks to have 5 tricks of if defence is awake|pg||
mb|p|nt|icechem:  terrible bidding, had all the space to bid they wanted|pg||
nt|icechem:  JÃºlÃ­us didn't think of 4@d it seems, very descriptive|pg||
nt|icearif: yes, started with 2@C 16+ and then it seems was a misunderstanding |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|icechem:  Svenni just but on the brakes for no reason|pg||
nt|icearif: 4@D good bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Let's see if they are|pg||
pc|c9|nt|icechem:  I am pretty sure Svenni and JÃºlli also would play that as splinter|pg||
nt|icechem:  trying for 7 even, wow|pg||
nt|icechem:  rkc would have worked better|pg||
nt|ady: this may get home on a spade lead|pg||
nt|ady: club lead defence have chances   need a heart switch   which looks likely|pg||
pc|c2|nt|icechem:  I guess sÃ¦var is screaming that he needs good @h for 7@s|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think with three small hearts Saevar is bidding too much.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gsper:  Does not even need to hit @H switch this time, I think|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|icechem:  AKJ is pretty good|pg||
nt|henryb:  If he had a doubleton heart and three diamonds this would make more sense|pg||
nt|icechem:  ah hello Henry|pg||
nt|icechem:  true|pg||
nt|henryb:  I hope you will forgive me for joining|pg||
nt|icechem:  always a big decision to bid 7 when not sure|pg||
nt|icechem:  the more the merrier|pg||
nt|icearif: tempting for Karl now to go for 7 - hi Henry :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@d must be trying for a grand since if no interest in more N would simply bid 6@s|pg||
nt|ady: even on a spade lead    no quick entry to south hand    so defence would get another chance|pg||
nt|gsper:  But it may take some fancy unblocking in @D|pg||
nt|ady: spade switch    might get home now|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|icechem:  what can SÃ¦var be looking for if not AK in @h?|pg||
nt|icechem:  like henry says, AK should be enough|pg||
nt|icearif: probably wondering- what does pd have since did not 4NT RKCB|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  Well, I would think @sAQxx might be what is needed :)|pg||
nt|icechem:  yes but why not just bid RKC with no voids|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|icearif: yes and pretty good hearts|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: if east ducks  north can play J@D     and ducj queen   then east could not damage with a heart switch|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|gsper:  S should have ducked that|pg||
nt|gsper:  As it happens|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|h4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb:  He did not bid RKC because he needed more than aces and the trump queen|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|icechem:  yes that is why Karl should bid 7 with AK in @h and @cK|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: always a moot point what to do on a handlike South's facing a 15-17 1NT - pass is certainly possible, but you may have a play for 4M if there is a fit    |pg||

nt|icechem:  Grant will need to win 19-11 since a previous game also counts. Karl wins if same VP|pg||
nt|icearif: must play spade, else makes|pg||
nt|icechem:  the other two teams can't get the title but one of them could get the silver medal|pg||

nt|mdgraham: and of course the void is key - difficult to show a void, as a splinter is usually a singleton, if only on frequency grounds|pg||
mb|6D!|mb|p|nt|bebechira: after Helness heard 1s from Helgemo..i do not think he will stop to 6s|pg||
