mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: for those who are still not faimiliar with the pairs after 6 segments :) NS play natural sys, EW precision|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|drorp: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2012/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof8|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  some pairs with W cards might be able to, and wish to, bid 2N|pg||
nt|drorp: interesting agreement here, double asking partner to lead his 2nd suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  the downside is that a significant portion of the HCP are in spades|pg||
nt|drorp: i think Curtis didn't choose 2N because he wanted to keep spades in play|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfb: Nick asks about J lead - Rusinow, shows the Q|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|marlowepi:  yes as noted:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|drorp: i think 3NT can only be beaten if grue switches to spade after he wins the Q@D|pg||
nt|drorp: otherwise Cheek is gonna get strip squeezed|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  another question is whether 3C was worth the breath. |pg||
nt|drorp: Cheek's discards on the diamonds should help|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  if partner will get a chance to pass/correct, probably, but after 2H by N this is unlikely|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s3|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|drorp: 3@C is relativley not danger and sometiems hits the jackpot finding very good save (hitting partner with 5 clubs for example)|pg||
nt|drorp: not dangerous*|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|drorp: nickell still hoping diamonds are 3-1, starting with the K|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  yes danger is not the issue, which is why i said "worth the breath". the problem is that if you bid 3C declarer will be better able to read your shape. |pg||
nt|drorp: now cheek has to do everything he can in their carding methods to get Joe to switch to spade when he gets in|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  shouldnt be too hard, as the sequence W has followed must reflect something worthwhile in spades|pg||

nt|bobh1: starting off with a slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: Zia is probably a little depressed looking at his hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: Play is at tric 9..i will report result in a min|pg||
nt|3for3: hi everyone|pg||

mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F|nt|drorp: cheek faces a decision weather to upgrade his hand to 1@C, and he does|pg||
nt|drorp: gonna make it hard to describe the 3 suiter hand, but atleast he gets the strengh of the hand in|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i think the upgrade is a questionable idea, except perhaps at these colors|pg||
mb|d!|an|Majors I think|mb|p!|an|0-4|nt|marlowepi:  if opps NV 1C is very very dangerous|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  at these colors maybe a chance worth taking|pg||
mb|1S|nt|drorp: yep, agreed, i would probably still decide against the upgrade because the hand bids so well after opening 1@H (just takeout double whatever number of spades they bid)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  agree|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  and you get to bid your best suit. science has never synthesized a bridge drug that could ever replace that|pg||
nt|drorp: nickell's 1@S is a bit conservative, he knows he's bidding to atleast the 2 level anyway, except maybe now when opps are standing on what he knows as a 6 card fit at best|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Nickell points to 2@h & then makes gestures to say that Cheek & Katz should be partners on this hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: grue makes a very dangerous pass because he expects partner to be a bit heavier, and his shape to be 6-4-3 rather than 5-4-4 (maybe cheek could bid 2N instead of double?)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  from a LTC perspective (losing trick count) the 1S call is not an underbid. anyway with spades you usually get another chance|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi:  i would never pass this with zero trump tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|drorp: yep, me neither, too many times burnt|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  Joe is great player with magnificent player, but for me 3D is a standout|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  magnificent record|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|marlowepi:  yes, maybe 2N|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|drorp: now A@C the 8th trick|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  i dont mind too much taking back the occasional -800 on a buccaneer pre-empt gone wrong. but taking back a doubled partscore made is just out of bounds for me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Nick says "you rate to" (I assume have KQJ of @hs, but it doesn't do me any good"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: nick had to cash A@C just before playing the diamond|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: 3rd seat weak 2 here, knowing there is almost no chance for game, weak 2 in the 3rd seat may be a bit heavier (as well as lighter because partner known not to get too carried away)|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: very aggressive 3@S by joe now, personally if i have to bid here, i would've doubeled|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  2D is dangerous here in the sense that opps know you dont have that much and you are fcing a passed hand. it may embolden the, to bid a close game and you dont have that much extra defense to surprise them with. it doesnt take up MUCH ROOM|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi:  the pressure bids are 3D and 1D (because of the vast strength range ambiguity)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|drorp: worked like a charm here, getting opps to play at the 3 level with no points and no fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  yes, all kinds of bids have their triumphant moments. against me, anyway:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  if your opponents go out of their way to bid 10 loser hands against preempts, then by all means preempt at every opportunity:):)|pg||
nt|drorp: i do feel like joe's 3@S bid was made due to the terrible last board, no real reason to bid here, if partner can't re open the bidding with a known diamond stiff, you're probably ...|pg||
nt|drorp: not making anything|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|drorp: more bad news coming for him when he'll find out hearts are 3-3 and 3@D isn't making as well|pg||

nt|athene: i guess Meckstroth is now working out if he has to play his partner for a singleton club to beat this|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: jeff is thinking|pg||
nt|athene: declarer would not be likely to duck with four clubs in his hand usually, but sometimes it might be his only chance i suppose|pg||
nt|barnets:  east has a picture of souths hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|algraves:  4@S would also have made but it is easy to find hands where 3NT is best. A good choice by South|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue wrote "I think @h and @d" about 3@c|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  after transfer at 2 level, crisscrossing the minors when responder bids second suit at 3 level is ghood idea|pg||
nt|drorp: not on the same page here, and now cheek thinks grue shows a hand with soft spade stopper, might end up in 4@H which has more chances than 3N|pg||
nt|drorp: in 4@H defenders need to establish 2 club tricks quick enough, before declearer draws trumps and pitches 2 clubs on a spade and the 4th diamond|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: so 4@H it is|pg||

nt|drorp: for those precision guys (and also hurd-wooldridge who play std in the other room) any 11 count is an opening bid, so this one actually a solid opening|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  better in stanbdard methods where you can bid the suit you want led, but this is fine in precision too as pd may lead a club anyway and a diamond is also fine after all|pg||

pc|d8|nt|bobh1: Zia @C play is not popular with the naysayers|pg||

nt|bobh1: of course we can all see much more of the deal than Zia can|pg||
nt|algraves:  but that is the kibitizers long held right|pg||

nt|bobh1: Zia plays MUD it appears|pg||
nt|bobh1: this may be a source of confusion for Joel|pg||

nt|bobh1: this is a timed event but long pauses for thought are normal and permitted|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: nothing outstanding in terms of bad breaks so 4@H will make either 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  curious 3rd seat pass maybe|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|drorp: it's one of those hands that you open 1st seat and pass 3rd seat for them, flat 4-3-3-3 11 count vul partner passed hand, the chance to go plus are slim if the hand is a partscore ...|pg||
nt|drorp: battle, so maybe just hoping for a passout|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  sure but it isnt matchpoints. sometimes opps bid a game and you do best with a specific lead|pg||
nt|drorp: well but 1@D isn't lead directing for them as it's precision|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  more is the pity. even playing preision it is possible to organize your agreements a bit differently for 3rd seat openings. and a 3rd seat 1D isnt necessarily a "lead-exclusion" openiong anyway. especially if they freely opemn light in first sea|pg||
nt|drorp: nickell taking his time to figure out how to play this safest way possible|pg||

nt|algraves:  Always difficult to bid those type of grand slams because you can talk yourself into a conservative position|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: contract here is 3n by south|pg||
nt|athene: this might go (2@S) X 3@C lebensohl 3@H 3@S 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well if north bid 3@D rather than 3@C actually that is more likely|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: the battle of the mjors coming up|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: n/s may get toohigh|pg||
nt|algraves:  requires partnership trust and \ or personal courage|pg||
nt|algraves:  so the loss on board 49 was 4 imps when Meckwell played 2@H making|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks in spades on the lay|pg||
nt|bigtrain: serving nother neb|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: south has a useful hand   decent spades with 2 outside aces|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 49 at other table, Jeff Meckstroth overcalled the Precision 1@D with 1@H, as his two small spades and likely (possible) spade lead or switch after short 1@D opener and his ...|pg||
nt|petergill: minimum values opposite passed hand made 1NT unattractive |pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets:  spector gained 10 imps on board 63 when n/s bid game here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
mb|3N|nt|algraves:  They have a way to invite in @S shoiwing 5|pg||
nt|algraves:  so this shows that hand|pg||
nt|algraves:  invitational with @S 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets:  so the lead now is 65|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  I suspect we did not quite see the play correctly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: well stopped|pg||
nt|algraves:  and he trusts his partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd on Roland's list of terrible bridge terms|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzfk: from declarer;s perspective..club length is unknown after 1d opener|pg||
nt|barnets: if declarer ducks a club east might shift to a spade and  may possibly set up one club 2 diamonds one heart and one spade trick for the defense|pg||
pc|c2|nt|algraves:  yes although that was not a minimum hand with two tens and 2 Aces, 2Kings and a working j|pg||
nt|algraves:  certinaly suited for play in Hearts though, the classic 4-3 fit type hand , strong trumps and prime cards outside|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49: Yes. I think it was mostly the spade holding that deterred Meckstroth from 1NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  to facilitate ruffing in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49: wd Meckstroth anyway|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: declarer will be pleased with the 9 tricks    not certain to make |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzfk: not real bidding|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|ady: 10 tricks in OR   a good return|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll take the declarer|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bobh1: here's an auction and a defense we can all understand|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say he wins and plays a spade now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bigtrain: declarer can set up 3 spade winners (at least DD)|pg||
nt|barnets: now dec is a tempo ahead|pg||
nt|barnets: he may have gone wrong before|pg||
pc|dK|nt|algraves:  My Mom would bring this in, with her only consistent line of play|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm this is a bit interesting|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wants to go over to dummy and finesse hearts to keep east off lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sry put contract i to follow play|pg||
nt|athene: but if he cashes the @DQ whilst he is there, he sets up diamond tricks and an entry for east|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: msy make 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he will now decide he has to just bash out hearts from the top|pg||
nt|athene: you can't really make use of the @h98|pg||
nt|athene: for example club to king, heart to jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Cheek thinking|pg||
nt|athene: because if that finesse lost, a club return would tangle your entries|pg||
nt|barnets:  he may x to dummy and lead the @H 8 to the J|pg||
nt|athene: yes, maybe you can do that, and then duck if west wins and shifts to a club|pg||
nt|barnets:  ibut a club retun hurts transport here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|algraves:  Hurd is a terrific player , dont get me wrong, but at some point.... as I said. It is a good debate when the stakes are 4-6 imps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|algraves:  which was to pull trump and take whatever finesses were about|pg||
nt|ady: a squeeze materialised on east|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|algraves:  on this hand there are none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe at this point he is regretting ducking the first trick as it gives him slightly less elbow-room for a throw-in ending|pg||
nt|athene: but he was not sure spades were 6-1, meckstroth being in first seat at favourable, i guess|pg||
nt|barnets:  he could duck it thouhgh|pg||
nt|bigtrain: briar patch|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|algraves:  Grue is trying for some elimination so the the opps have to start @H|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|barnets:  and is ok|pg||
nt|athene: well now it's ok as he can just duck the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: thanks to that @C9|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|barnets:  so well played|pg||
nt|barnets:  playing hearts from top would be silly had east the @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Katz asks Grue if Cheek can be 6-4 and Grue says doesn't think so - probably 6-5|pg||
nt|drorp: he might fear 5 minor goes down, but he's not sure he can set 4@S either|pg||
nt|poohbear: Shouldnt Nick dbl 4S?|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  bok barry. |pg||
nt|poohbear: hi|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  if N has doubleton spade X will be right. tough hand for S to decide about. also for N'|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Nick asks about 3@s and Cheek says it's just the same as after a normal Michaels bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  N has shown his hand pretty accurately already i think|pg||
nt|drorp: i think S's pass is okay, he has 11 working points and not such a defensive hand, his pass on 3@H already implied a min non interesting hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  agree|pg||
nt|drorp: N has no idea who is making what here, i think he can be pretty sure that he's not making anything, might just let this go|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  with doubleton spade and stiff heart king, X by N seems right to me bt it is a hard hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  yes true that if N doesnt fancy offense a double of 4S doesnt rate to gain enough to be worth it|pg||
pc|cT|nt|drorp: i like ralph's decision alot here|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|drorp: very often in those situations that your side is strong and their side has a big 2 suiter, those kinds of hands are very dangerous, you can't make anything because breaks are ...|pg||
nt|drorp: terrible, they might make alot because they have a big 2 suiter|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|drorp: me and my partner actually made a specific exception to our forcing pass methods for just those situations, opp showing 2 suiter and bids again|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|poohbear: Thats why I dbl with south :)  I know that Hearts breaking bad. I got 3 length in S. No @d card and aces|pg||
pc|c3|nt|drorp: i'm still not sold for the double, might shut partner from bidding when he's got 11 cards in the minors|pg||
nt|poohbear: especially against this pair|pg||
pc|d8|pc|cK|nt|drorp: hmmm|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  off to london tomorrow|pg||
nt|poohbear: with 11 minor cards partner starts with club raise I think|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  sorry private|pg||
nt|poohbear: meantime they had it beat 2 with a @h play|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|drorp: well, they have only 8 card fits, wasted values in the minors (K@D), bad heart break and pretty bad spot cards, and it's still only 1 or 2 off|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2@H is intermediate|pg||
mb|1C|nt|algraves:  the big club players these days have developed a keen eye for what auctions make it hard for the opponents to bid accurately|pg||
nt|algraves:  for instance on that hand some standard experts would raise to 2@H to make their game auction easier in case partner has strong hand.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H ony choice|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     e/w  might win the auction in hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: needs a bit more to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D is michaels|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2:  Down 2?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Spector has found the 4-1 split  |pg||
mb|2D|nt|petergill: 2NT showed exactly 3 spades, hence E knew that they had a 5-3 spade fit. I'm not sure how West asks for @HQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|algraves:  playing precision you know partner is limited so game in unlikely unless partner can start jumping aroudn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 16+ unbal  18+ bal,   2@D = game force 5+@D|pg||
nt|athene: nice @S10 makes 3nt very comfortable here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 97 might be misscored|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: thanks|pg||
mb|3H|nt|algraves:  so 1@S muddies the waters a little bit more than 2@H|pg||
nt|petergill: I think with his good 19 count, West intended 5@S as a queen ask, but when it's Hamman who passes 5@S, one tends to think that Hamman is usually right |pg||
nt|algraves:  we are not quite sure what the deeper meaning of the last bid was. but 6@H or 6NT are easy makes so an opportunity for Spector|pg||
nt|algraves:  I bet they are irritated though. That much we know for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D also ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: negative DBL by north is much easier IF 1@D=4+@D unbal|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i took care of it :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: operators don't listen|pg||
nt|bigtrain: really can't|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: rodwell doesn't want jeff to declare..lol|pg||
mb|3N|nt|algraves:  just to finish for board 20 , I suspect that declarer also took the 4th club and then led a diamond to his QT. The defense had no answer to that line|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are splitting up later this year. Hamman will play with Justin Lall in another team and Levin-Weinstein will replace Zia - Hamman in the much-heralded famous Nickell team |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D in the picture   doubt they'll play 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N is not a success n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: favorable|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  Grue likes to open NT type hands with NT more so than almost any expert around these days|pg||
nt|ady: should be 11 tricks on the lay|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@H is defined as non constructive |pg||
nt|algraves:  by agreement|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 5@D not that nice on a heart lead is it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: back to sleep Al|pg||
nt|barnets: just duck it and it will make|pg||
nt|athene: sure but it gives you a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  he had another bid over 4@D is he had a good supporting hand for @H|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Rodwell did not have weak 2@D in arsenal    they play 2@D opener = 3-suit short @D|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|barnets: certainly on a spade lead the heart goes on the spade|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: they forgot to X in the OR|pg||
pc|cA|nt|algraves:  North is 3 HCP short of there , albeit loose , standard. but they make a nice stop after the 2NT start|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: best for north to duck 1st heart|pg||
nt|ady: then switch to a club|pg||

pc|h2|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|barnets: after easts 4@D pick a major perhaps west should have bid spades at the 4 level|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: declarer will need to go up with A@C  and get spade right to make 9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: will probably draw 3 rounds of trumps  and trust to good fortune in hearts   |pg||
nt|ady: either 3-3   or as they lay   or 10 doubleton|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: on lead of @SK Grue would have unblocked if he'd started with @SQTx|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't need to pick the spades as he has a strip squeeze on S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 79   Lee 28-5 for the set   leads Fleisher by 48|pg||
nt|ady: in fact can play spade to ace    and south will be squeezed in the blacks|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to David Edwin|pg||

nt|ady: hi all|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|drorp: hi David|pg||
nt|ady: see this match is now very close|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dror|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  2H is certainly normal. but what does it achieve? it helps the opps narrow their focus to spades, and is likely to attract a losing lead. compromising suit quality when you can open 2S is a different matter|pg||
nt|drorp: 3@H is punished dearly by katz here|pg||
nt|drorp: i dont like his pass even if partner has KQJTXX in heart|pg||
nt|poohbear: U right Marshall. Shoulda opened 3@h :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Katz: "not the ideal dummy" Nickell: "well as they say no double no trouble" Katz "that's wha tthey were saying on the last hand"|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  THAT i can live with........it at least takes up a lot of space|pg||
nt|poohbear: Seems to be the theme |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|drorp: back to south's rebid, i really can't understand why he decided to rebid hearts, maybe to discourage partner from bidding on, but 3@C is not such a positive bid, just showing the ...|pg||
nt|drorp: values, and if partner bids 4@S over that, i'm happy, i got an ace and a potential ruffing value|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi:  another factor about grotty weak 2s is this  -- and before i say it, i should also say that i have never been accused of being timid about preempts, quite the opposite really  -- not infrequently when you have a weak 2 sort of hand.........|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|marlowepi:  and you have a game, pd should be playing it, and if you pass pd opens 1N and you rightside it. |pg||
nt|poohbear: i was sure he was bidding 3C. Might be the only thing partner needs to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  the downsides of 2H all add up|pg||
mc|7|nt|marlowepi:  one of the reasons why multi is so nice.....you get to open a weak 2 and partner plays it whenever you have game (in a proper bidding structure)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, I lost track of the play there and then so did they and then concluded that he lost 3 trumps and 2 diamonds and a club for down 2|pg||
nt|drorp: his play probably saved his bidding :)|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 15-17?|pg||
mb|d|nt|algraves:  sometimes you can talk yourself into something obscure|pg||
nt|algraves:  pull trump and play on trick source often has a lot going for it|pg||
mb|r|an|.|nt|bobh1: this one more interesting|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think 4@S is cold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: y|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohler treating as stronger -- but i was curious|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X-f-2@H or maybe a tactical 3@S|pg||

nt|bigtrain: hi ko|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: can't readd meaning of xx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: asks partner to escape to 1@H|pg||
nt|barnets: may ask to bid the next step|pg||
nt|mildredb: might be McCabe forcing south to bid 2@S|pg||
nt|barnets: so north can show his suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: alerted*|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they have strict rules and this is defined as not penalty|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bigtrain: hello|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@H here would imply longer @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  1N-(3@S)-3N-end|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C could be game force balanced hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so only promises 2+@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: should be 2 crd difference|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bobh1: 3@S cold|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they have defined when a pass is penalty and when its a punt|pg||
nt|barnets: this is looking like another swing for spector|pg||
nt|bigtrain: cops being summoned i think|pg||
nt|barnets: my guess is norths bid xx was conventional |pg||
nt|barnets: and south forgot|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobh1: is what i meant to say|pg||
nt|petergill: South had a tough bid - Axx in clubs looks poor for 1NT because|pg||
nt|bigtrain: since with 55 or 65 he bids 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  Cheek hopes that Grue has similiar spades as last hand|pg||
nt|barnets: north would like to x for a spade lead but south may have none|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: S told W he had no idea about XX.. conflicts with N explanation|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  it is possible that South, after being told the Mecks pass was not penalty decided just to pass and let Rodwell start bidding , sure he would not be passing for penalty|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzfk: Director was already in room and is discussing situation with Eric|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: with longer clubs North would balance with 1NT, not Dbl|pg||
nt|algraves:  well said|pg||
nt|petergill: Time now to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  so on the next round, having limited his hand with 1@D he can suggest max values with a club card|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  68  Spector opened weak 2@D  playing 5@D west -- but @C lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: why can't you beat 3NT?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: will likely be a flat result|pg||
nt|petergill: South has tried to get North to declare 3NT if North has KJ or Qx or J10x or J9x or the like in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opening lead against Zia's 3N was @S9|pg||
nt|barnets: this  should be down 2 for 5 imps to spector subject to appeal|pg||
pc|c9|nt|algraves:  so two down|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes it is normal to bid two balanced hands with lots of points to 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  occasionally the bridge spirits throw the defenders a bone|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  if you are playing forcing club there is nothing to think about|pg||
nt|poohbear: Grue going for a ruff and succeeds!|pg||
nt|drorp: yep, notice that the light opening has taken diamonds out of play for NS, but i believe it will be matched in the other room as Meckwell aren't shy about their opening bids aswell|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  after you hypothetically pass, are you planning to overcall? fat chance|pg||
nt|drorp: cheek didn't consider underleading the @C to get another ruff? :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobh1: Zia was a bit light for 4@S, but it worked because in induced N to save|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: 28-2 set for Nickell|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: looks like 4@S depended on an inspired @C play|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: 4! down 1 on ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S down on ruff|pg||
nt|algraves:  Yes I think the logic of 4@S is clearly a big diamond fit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: cn tap declarer out also|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can|pg||
nt|algraves:  but South was not on the same page presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: there;s no certainty,, but the odds are good..rodwell can overtake and play d..he should suspect ns diamond fit for 4s jump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: if clubs are continued, meck can make a similar judgement based on the auction and club shortage in N|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: spector doing well this session   might get more imps here|pg||
nt|barnets: this will likely make just 7 tricks|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|petergill: South seems to have bid out his shape. I'm not sure what the bids at the 3 level mean|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobh1: 10 imps to nickell on the prev board when Kohler didn't cue bid and they stopped at the 2-level|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room west opened 1@H and this made it more difficult|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|algraves:  that is key card in Hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll bet he makes 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|algraves:  I suspect that 3NT was " forward going "|pg||
nt|petergill: so 5@H is two keycards and no queen of @H|pg||
nt|ady: maybe only 9 now|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s4|nt|petergill: so N considers 5@H or 6@C|pg||
nt|barnets: for n/s to bid any diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|algraves:  he knows that Zia has a singleton for his bidding|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes many pairs have followed the Italian style of responding after overcalls which involves picking out specific invitational or better type hands so that if the opps pre empt in the overcalled suit, then partner is well placed to compete|pg||
nt|petergill: and chooses well|pg||

nt|ady: J@C   looked better at trick 2   to protect diamond position|pg||
pc|s2|nt|algraves:  yes I think the logic was that North had encourged but denied a @S control so 4@C showed a @S control on the side, hence the Key card ask|pg||
nt|algraves:  Note that the math of slams is that you dont want to be in slam off an ace and the Queen of trumps because then it is 50 50 in theory that you make|pg||

nt|ahollan1: from NS SSF   "Mid-hand honor leads: shift to 10 generally shows interior sequence (HJT or HT9), typically lead rusinow through declarer (except as above)"|pg||

nt|athene: this could get very competitive if NS find their diamond fit|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s may compete to 5@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|algraves:  if it is invitational then when the opps blast to 4@H then partner can make a reasonable decisoin|pg||

nt|ahollan1: There are some seeding points in play for 2013 trials, but only for intact teams and only to get bye to R16|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: thanks walter|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I'm not sure if 2Nt is intended as showing a good raise to 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: 5@S would be down 1 on a heart ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: so par for n/s is 500 +|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: a sort of good-bad 2NT|pg||
nt|petergill: which forced 3@C perhaps. |pg||
nt|algraves:  well we dont know in these cases|pg||
nt|petergill: South's hesitation over 3@D makes it look like S thinks N has more than N has|pg||
nt|algraves:  but we can assume that they do|pg||
nt|algraves:  Cheek and Grue continue there sure footed play by bidding 6NT where Hamman Zia missed the slam|pg||
nt|algraves:  that has 12 tricks on any distribution|pg||

nt|algraves:  he would have had to play 3 rounds of clubs pitching both hearts, |pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: kibs suggesting 5 clubs or 5 diamonds make    but 11th trick not really there   |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C makes but after the @H tap you can only make 10 tricks in @D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe a @D lead beats 5@C also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge bid 3@S over 3@D  auction isn't over yet|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes...  @D lead beats 5@C since you need a @H ruff for the 11th trick|pg||
nt|ady: heart tap in diamonds will stop any chance of ruffing a spade in north hand   and in 5 clubs a diamond lead  would  force trumps to be drawn to stop a heart ruff in south hand|pg||

mb|d|nt|algraves:  well 1@H is lower|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if swap vulnerability  if Meckstroth opens 2@C|pg||
nt|dburn: crumbs - is that really a double facing a passed hand? I mean, equal-level conversion notwithstanding...|pg||
mb|2H|an|spades|nt|algraves:  south has normal opener for their limited precision 1D style|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H has lower risk than 2@H (no -800) and does not tell the opponents that you are weak |pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: e/w   might make 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  they would bid zero hearts for the lead if they could but you have to bid at least 1 I understand|pg||
nt|athene: xx = psyche?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue finally gets a chance to operate|pg||
nt|athene: east definitely very close to 2@C opener|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems normal to me...  but i play with meck alot :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h presumably a sound spade raise|pg||
nt|barnets: and in the other room too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgehands.com/E/Equal_Level_Conversion_Doubles.htm|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s would be weaker, I guess|pg||
nt|barnets: south made a good spade raise |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i imagine their range is 14-16|pg||
nt|petergill: Joel Wooldridge prefers Dbl of 1@H to 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia did overcall 1@S |pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: for both pairs  2@C opener = 10-15, 6+@C|pg||
nt|barnets: and north only bid  3@S and they missed a decent game|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about 3@d - if it shows shortness, South could just bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: had north tried with  3@H south may have bid game|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, OK - I an sure why East bid 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sorry..typo guys..hurd passed over 3c|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bobh1: that seems to be the popular range among these young tigers|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  requires @D lead to defeat 3NT if my double dummy analysis is correct|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  Well the feeling " on the street" was that this was going to be a close well played match|pg||
nt|ady: yesz  should lose 3 diamonds and 2 aces|pg||
nt|algraves:  note the effect of the NS bidding . it made it very hard on EW to have a sure footed auctino|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue envisions hand playing on cross ruff after 3@C from Meck|pg||
nt|barnets: on 71 nickel had a chance when spector bid up to 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: well stolen|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unusul way to win 3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unusual|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: Raising the hearts which South showed by doubling 1@H|pg||
nt|barnets: but north has to lead the @HA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|ady: did 3@H  promise anything   was a leb bid available after east doubled 2 spades?|pg||
nt|petergill: Should be 130|pg||
nt|barnets: and led a " normal " @DK|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|algraves:  of course you need to be playing a strong club to give you cover on hans like this , so that the non one club openers are limited to 15|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: 4 hearts hopeless|pg||
nt|ady: is this lead true?|pg||
nt|algraves:  so one can argue wether West should have bid , the point was that NS just doing there normal bidding made it difficult to sort everything out.|pg||
nt|algraves:  They play Rusinow in bid suits|pg||
nt|petergill: or he might play "safe" (unsafe if clubs 4-1) for 110 by not trying the @D hook|pg||
pc|c8|nt|algraves:  and why not lead a @S?|pg||
nt|algraves:  got to lead something|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|petergill: Al, can you see why @SQ is a good play here?|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot, but if Zia is doing it, there must be a reason|pg||
nt|dburn: and I am sure why West raised it, and why North-South withdrew from the auction - they could not know how good a fit they had|pg||
mc|9|nt|algraves:  remember the @D bid just said no 5 card major not 14-16 balanced not 6 clubs|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: oh wow, lucky again|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: So what was 3H?|pg||
nt|drorp: and now the tray is back with P-P and both nickell and cheek staring at each other :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  maybe he will tell us everything they used to play ... :):)|pg||
nt|drorp: 3@H maybe accepting the game invite in @S, leaving room for slam tries|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue: "sorry for forgetting - I'm supposed to show spades" they ask about 3@h "shows a game acceptance with 3 @ss"|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|poohbear: Grue is honor bound to pass|pg||
nt|poohbear: Maybe thats why they play it that way :)|pg||
nt|ady: seems morelogical 3@D should show hearts and 3@H spades  if using an artificcual method to show a major|pg||
nt|poohbear: in case of memory lapse|pg||
nt|drorp: when you get lucky with 2 misunderstandings in 1 set, you might just go fill a lottery ticket|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Katz asks what other possibilities Cheek had with a spade fit. Cheek says 3@h only bid with a game acceptance and spade fit. Could be a good doubleton in spades.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Makes way more sense to play it as spades . One of the big problems with suit under is lack of space to make a try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Katz then asks about 2@c - promises 6 @cs, could have 4 or even 5 card Major|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 under there is room|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: will rodwell find a diamond lead against 3nt?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: tHrashing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H transfer to 4@S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: looks a bit impossible to me|pg||
nt|dburn: if this is forcing, OK, but if it isn't it might end the NS auction|pg||
nt|dburn: but now South may feel in duty bound to support diamonds, which as far as I can see he has not yet done|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he never supported @D|pg||
nt|barnets: diamond lead and spade switch|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C game force promises either 4@H or 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: it's not good enough anyway but it would give declarer a nasty moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  es I think he wanted the @S trick now and wanted an entry to hand to deal with trumps eventually and just as you say, so as not to have to broach diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: There might be an "intra-finesse" here for an overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that line was a result of Larry Cohen's book on Law of Total Tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i used bad instead of new math    Diamond +78|pg||
nt|barnets: against hearts|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobh1: Joel might have sniffed at slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S by Cheek  stopper showing   and implies concern about @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told   Edgar Kaplan wrote "All 4H bids are transfers to 4S"" 30 years before Larry Cohen wrote about the Law of Total Tricks.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|barnets: how about a spade lead v 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS had too much information to play the mundane [and makeable] 3N|pg||
pc|h9|nt|algraves:  gadzooks an intra finesse in @D|pg||
nt|algraves:  we bring you all the exciting news|pg||
nt|petergill: In @D, lead low to 7 or 9, then run queen for one loser. The term intra-finesse was invented by Gabriel Chagas of Brazil in (I think) a Bols Bridge Tip|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky lie of the EW cards seems to doom everything now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|drorp: yeah, will have to guess the club honours in the end, but he will see all of the point count by then so should be able to get it right|pg||

nt|petergill: I will take the liberty of writing a summary of this segment ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 57 - good aggressive bidding by Meckwell gained|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 52  Zia - Hamman's bidding went off the rails, but we do not know what the bids should mean|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 51 - superior bidding and play by Hurd- Wooldridge|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49 - excellent bidding judgement by Meckstroth gained|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 47 - bad lie of cards (@HK under AQ) for Meckwell who took bidding risk that backfired|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 46 - Cheek made a game - Zia's line of play which failed at this table looks OK to me, and the computer was down so we don't know how Cheek played it, but he did well|pg||
nt|petergill: Overall Summary - very high quality bridge - just one big slip up on Bd 52. Spector team deserved their segment win. Here in Australia at our top level, we make far more errors ...|pg||
nt|petergill: than these guys do. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: might not be able to start Round 7 early -- maybe directors union guarantess a full lunch break|pg||

nt|algraves:  so Cheek had a cheery moment for his well thought out lead but his partner let him down by not having a setting trick|pg||
nt|ady: think thats all for the session    thx all|pg||
