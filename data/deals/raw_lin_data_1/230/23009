nt|bobh1: of course we can all see much more of the deal than Zia can|pg||

nt|bobh1: Zia plays MUD it appears|pg||
nt|bobh1: this may be a source of confusion for Joel|pg||
nt|bobh1: normally a player leading the 5 then playing the 9 would have the Q|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a timed event but long pauses for thought are normal and permitted|pg||
nt|bobh1: when they start to add up, the director starts getting nasty|pg||
nt|algraves:  Well Woldridge can build a club trick with the right view but that is hardly clear|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jbgood: but down it went|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I don't really know that Cohler led the club K - but it seemed to be on the bottom of his pile of played cards :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|runnerup:  7 tricks and 5 top losers -so 2nt had some sort of play but didn't make |pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: well deserved may i say|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes -cards layd well and @c blocked -too high ofcause but sometimes you have to open that high|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ns makes 9 and ew only 8 in they main suits -but lets see -3 @h -1 is ok -like other table|pg||
nt|jbgood: I guess our operator par excellence is busy trying to get other operators going - doubt anyone at this table has a reason to still be in the tank|pg||
nt|athene: no i am sure it's gone pass 3@H pass pass pass already|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell has a sort of decision on lead, but small spade looks normal|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in both last boards ns made 1 trick more than here to get 7+6 in|pg||
nt|bigtrain: roland says their operator says it was scored as making|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|jbgood: wow|pg||

nt|henryb:  that is Moysian|pg||
nt|jbgood: a lead director against 4 @h? or really serious? or just a shot?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thus they NEVER open with a 5-card suit in second seat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cohler accidentally dropped both the spade 10 and the spade 8 onto the table. The director tells him that he can now play either of them and the other card is a penalty card - if ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: it's an honor, it's a major penalty card, if it's not, it's a minor penalty card.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cohler chooses to play the spade 10 and so the spade 8 is now a minor penalty card and if Cohler is playing a spade he must play the 8 in preference to any other spot card|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: 3@S a lead director, prepared to play 4minor, i guess|pg||

nt|athene: will he think it is worth upgrading?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the infamous nebulous diamond 1@D = 2+ 10-15|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck: "I needed a spade lead" Rodwell: "they make 3@h" Meck: "not if you lead a spade ... didn't have to make the bid ... I wanted to beat 4@h, that's for sure"|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  ew can compete on 3 level here|pg||
nt|athene: both red tens worth a huge amount in those suits|pg||
nt|athene: @DAJ106 worth about half a trick more than @DAJ62|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|bigtrain: 14-16 1NT|pg||
nt|jbgood: ideal hand for stayman - you just pass prds rebid|pg||
nt|athene: i am not even sure that hand is a minimum 14-16 notrump|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: KNR values it as 14.80|pg||
nt|runnerup:  on a good day even 4 @h makes |pg||
nt|athene: now when rodwell passes 2@H, east knows he has a weak hand with short clubs, so spade length|pg||
nt|athene: so there is less reason to bid 2@S even if you were ever going to do that, with those nice hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - not so bad with all honors working - but the layout is not friendly|pg||
nt|bigtrain: upgrades reflect a true value of the hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|runnerup:  even 10 @h is |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: the 4321 structure doesn't count 10s, or combination of honors or location of honors|pg||
nt|runnerup:  important in good day when you are in 4 @h|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thus hands with the same point count can be worth different strengths|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|athene: this is one of those hands where, if you just count tricks for EW, you might not find five, but declarer will have a lot of trouble coming to nine|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: with the bad trump break|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i apologize for any misspellings that are the result of poor typing skills|pg||
nt|athene: basically if declarer tries to draw trumps the black suits are wide open and if he doesn't, east will get two diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c4|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm ok that might have cost a vital tempo for the defence though|pg||
nt|bigtrain: looks like 9 tricks from here by setting up the sidesuit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and partner is there also -so sometimes he bid 3 @c with shortness in @s |pg||
nt|bigtrain: as is frequently correct, set up the side suit asap|pg||
nt|athene: now meckstroth is pretty much certain that trumps are 4-1, after that @h9 appeared|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bigtrain: splitting the honors allows the defense to pull an extra round of trump...  has nothing to do with the number of trump winners|pg||
nt|athene: declarer in control now; doesn't mind losing @DK and two trumps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the defense will always have 2 trump winners|pg||
nt|athene: yes but splitting you might get *three* trump winners|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer wins the ace and then leaves trumps entirely and you get two ruffs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  it's more important to exchange 2 for 1|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so is this a competition @h 6 against @h 5 -to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cohler: "sorry" Meck: "I don't think it matters here" Cohler: "I don't either" Meck: "looks like 140 to me, but I'm not 100% sure"|pg||

nt|runnerup:  earlyer in defence|pg||
nt|athene: surprising how often it costs to signal with nines|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Didin't matter - if he'd still had 109 of clubs, Meck would play low diamond to endplay East (he had it out then decided "let's do it this way"|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|runnerup:  he didn't signal -he put it because table had 8|pg||

nt|athene: i was wondering if it was a signal or just splitting but i thought it was a signal|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: west will be thinking about slam now|pg||
nt|athene: just 4@D shows his hand i suppose|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H shows 4+@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @h /west is ok -by east -not so ok|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the 3rd hand psyche has jockeyed them into wrongsiding it|pg||
nt|jbgood: stand corrected: then W would be thrown in with a club to give away the diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: if opposite an unpassed hand South's pass would deny 3@S...  but having opened a tad light :) he chooses not to show the fit|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 3@D = 4+@H 7-9 dummy points|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Sprint not working well)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|athene: yes i think if south made a support double of 2@H that would show an actual opening bid :)|pg||
nt|athene: still declarer should prevail, even after spade, diamond back, and another spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cohler asks Rodwell if he could have 4 @hs and he says only with 5 @s and 4@hs (at least I think that was the question - I'm sure that was the answer)|pg||
nt|jbgood: but may go wrong...|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s lead and you are in trouble and it comes ?-perhaps 60 votes for that|pg||
nt|athene: let's say spade to Q or 10, north wins, diamond back to ace, another spade.  declarer rises ace, then plays three rounds of clubs|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: that looks a decent line to me; even if south could ruff the third club low, you would still have the chance of picking up the trumps|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||

nt|athene: but i think that loses more than it gains|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder what a double of 1 @h would be? if natural - then W would be declarer...|pg||
nt|runnerup:  other table lead was singleton  @H -now needs to play well|pg||
nt|athene: east wondering if south has @SJ87 now i suppose|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cohler asks Rodwell about whether they play support DBL here and if so whether it promises a real opening bid. I'm not sure how it was phrased, but what Rodwell said was: "no they ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: without my asking) but he tends to put his hand on top of the cards when he plays them, so I can't see them :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: dbl of 1 @h would be to of 1 @s - so ... still not sure he had to bid 2 @h just to show 5 - but app they think otherwise... (it would surely be good to make prd declarer though)|pg||
nt|athene: well, from east's point of view, it might be better for him to declar, to protect the @DK|pg||
