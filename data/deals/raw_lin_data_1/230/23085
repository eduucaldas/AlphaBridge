nt|kit: but he might try queen of spades and hope opponents don't get diamond ruff.|pg||

nt|bt: ruffing low heart then high heart maybe |pg||

nt|kit: He will ruff club trying to strip out East's exits, but East will still have a club exit|pg||

nt|bt: i think full credit is due for the trump lead|pg||

nt|kit: So Rodwell can afford to dump his hearts.|pg||
nt|bt: he is just checking in his mind|pg||
nt|kit: I'm surprised he has such a problem with this position.  If the heart suit were running, Meckstroth wouldn't have taken his ace -- or he would have shifted to a diamond.|pg||
