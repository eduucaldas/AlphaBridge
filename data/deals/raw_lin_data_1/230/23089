pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: Declarer will have to try another trump now I think, since he knows there is a diamond ruff out against him.  he needs 2-2 trumps and some help in spade suit.|pg||
nt|kit: but he might try queen of spades and hope opponents don't get diamond ruff.|pg||
nt|kit: As it turns out there is no diamond ruff for them, but he can't know that.  |pg||

pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|jaapfr: y agree|pg||
nt|bt: ruffing low heart then high heart maybe |pg||
nt|kit: Maybe he thinks he can afford to ruff a heart (guarding against 5-2), and it will be difficult for defense to separate everything.  But I don't think he can afford to risk that.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Kranyak:  "was that just diamonds?"   Wolpert:  "yes, I don't make stuff up on the spot"|pg||
nt|dburn: and to have taken a bid at the end of it, which will double the penalty from 50 to 100|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: oh I agree East shouldn't have bid the grand.  If there were a grand, West would have Q-bid 6@C.|pg||
nt|bt: now kit, in my world 4@D promises 2 suits, then bidding 6@C would imply clubs being one of them|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||

nt|kit: This is frightening -- now Meckstroth has no idea if they are off 2 aces or not.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: there must be a bid where E can ask aces with after 3@S???|pg||
nt|kit: Clearly a very bad hand for their methods|pg||
nt|jaapfr: dougs?|pg||
nt|dburn: but not too involved - his approach is the standard one of raising to four to deprive West of a value-showing jump or cue bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he is well aware of what a 3@C bid might look like in this situation|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bt: he isnt passing|pg||

mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|bigtrain: 2@S|pg||

nt|dburn: Wolpert has "garbage Stayman" in his bag, so used it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I'm not sure of NT range but I'd guess 14-16|pg||
nt|dburn: and Katz, with one of the less desirable hands to lead from, made a strange-looking but logical choice|pg||
nt|dburn: the upshot of all of which looks to be down one and a couple more to Milner, but Kranyak has yet to earn them|pg||
