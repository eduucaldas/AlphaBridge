nt|bobh1: starting off with a slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: Zia is probably a little depressed looking at his hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: the slam needs 1 of 2 hooks more or less|pg||
nt|bobh1: plus a trick|pg||
nt|bobh1: ok sorry 12 tricks cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/USA%202/hurd-wooldridge.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East's name is spelt  Meckstroth   operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Contrack was 4h |pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Contract 4hw lead Dia Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: didn't get bidding|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: playing hand 91 --late start..i will give result in a minute|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: I assume also..but had to leave room for a minute|pg||
nt|bigtrain: e/w play RM precision|pg||
nt|bigtrain: n/s play 2/1 with gadgets|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|bigtrain: looks like the other room went down in 3NT which i beieve can be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: what happened with the scoring?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S is multi meaning|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D shows short @D|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|3for3: Is this the correct score?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: henry do you have any idea how this score was handled?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bigtrain: W is squeezed in 3 suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: It was tied on vugraph after 105, but that is unofficial|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dburn: seems unlikely, unless there was some massive adjustment on appeal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: didnt get bidding sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: appeal changed to 2HXX down 1|pg||
nt|3for3: so, shouldnt that mean nickell leads?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but that should mean nickell is leading|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it should|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: ibelieve that nickell is up 11 or 12|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think the score is reversed here|pg||
nt|3for3: there was a differing explanation on an alertable call, and the ruling changed the score from plus 300 for spector, to 200 for nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: i believe that is correct but I will try to change score in a minute|pg||
nt|dburn: but this looks like a losing position for Nickell - 3NT would have made, but 5@c almost certainly will not|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is the score  heard|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bigtrain: his hand falls apart on the barage of diamonds before that happens|pg||
nt|3for3: cant he pitch one spade and 2 hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Play is at tric 9..i will report result in a min|pg||
nt|3for3: hi everyone|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the problem was in the open room they cashed the hearts and lost communication for the squeeze to work|pg||
nt|3for3: seems like that adjustment should be 12, not 21...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bigtrain: has to pitch 5 cards|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzfk: score was tied before change..|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: XX=-400|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|dburn: Hurd won't necessarily believe the actual heart position, mind|pg||
nt|dburn: that seems about right, given the adjustment|pg||
nt|dburn: but this may be a big swing to Spector|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 46: In the ending, if you play S for CA (for the 2S opener), then N has three clubs (that are not ace) to S's two (non-ace) clubs. |pg||

nt|barnets:  hi from paris|pg||
nt|athene: i guess Meckstroth is now working out if he has to play his partner for a singleton club to beat this|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: jeff is thinking|pg||
nt|athene: declarer would not be likely to duck with four clubs in his hand usually, but sometimes it might be his only chance i suppose|pg||
nt|barnets:  east has a picture of souths hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@S would also have made but it is easy to find hands where 3NT is best. A good choice by South|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i've been keeping him company|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: oops!|pg||
nt|3for3: well, that makes it even easier..|pg||
nt|3for3: wooldridge might fear 41 hearts tho|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: splitting won't hurt contract since spade A is onside|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|barnets:  this speeds the play|pg||
nt|athene: there are other, better, possibilities, like Rodwell having the @SQ?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||

nt|petergill: Back on Bd 46 - the maths indicated to play N for @CJ, but N's choice of a @D switch instead of a @C switch was possibly mildly suggestive of N having @CJ (or possibly not, at this ...|pg||
nt|petergill: World Class level of play) |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 16+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@H GF|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobh1: another slam|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C 16+, 1@H is spades or 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell will want to go for penalties now|pg||
nt|athene: whether his partner has spades or a balanced hand, defending 2@DX looks quite appetising|pg||
nt|athene: even at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to David Edwin|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobh1: this one a grand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi david|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: alerted|pg||
nt|dburn: and I am informed that Curtis Cheek in the West seat at the other table made exactly the same play|pg||
mb|2H|nt|barnets:  not enough only 500 against 650|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: meckstroth said in his book that they make it a definite policy to try to penalize opps who come in over the strong club|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S = 0-2 controls|pg||
nt|dburn: but it cost him one more overtrick and one more IMP|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzfk: lost track of the play here, will enter result at end|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2NT ask|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C = natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: they just have to stay out of @Ss|pg||
nt|athene: even if sometimes they only get 500 against their vul game, it is worth it so opps know they can't take too many liberties|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT = to play|pg||
nt|3for3: this looks like a dull 4@H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: North very aggressive opposite a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts obviously shortage   and not 4 spades|pg||
nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
nt|ady: clear cut 3NT from north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hamman's tool was  3@D showing @C & @D with longer @D    @Hx led in both rooms|pg||
nt|bigtrain: marshall's dolcid tones and your voice for newspaper roland -- loud and clear|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: but with that shape i guess he was always bidding on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some play that 3@H can be 4144  --- is that not the meckwell agreement Walter?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobh1: hard to bid grands without blackwood|pg||
nt|algraves:  One would have to trust that south is not control bidding with zero aces|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|3for3: q@S shift?|pg||
nt|dburn: super play|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or their ACBL convention card   http://usbf.org/docs/2012usbc/acblcards/MeckstrothRodwell.jpg|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: N's theory is that with South knowing where the missing HCP are, and with finesses likely to work, less than the usual  25 points are needed for 3NT to make, with 1NT overcaller ...|pg||
nt|petergill: over the opener|pg||
nt|algraves:  so the 23 pt NT does not come in on this hand|pg||
nt|petergill: but backfires this time|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: sry we are having internet problems|pg||
nt|algraves:  well then do away with the invitational raise if that is the position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's 2@H walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = @S raise|pg||
nt|bigtrain: versace and lauria|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|algraves:  if the club is in your bag then at some point you should use it.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|algraves:  3@H limit of better in principle|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thts helpful...  you can't go south  ;)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobh1: declarer's problem is more a death of tricks than the bad trump break|pg||
nt|algraves:  Grand slam try asking more information|pg||
nt|algraves:  so Cheek, knows that his partner has neither Major King|pg||
nt|ady: maybe some sort of asking bid in diamonds?|pg||
nt|algraves:  6 imps is not cheap|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C= natural|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D = Q|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unlikely to push if the result from the open room is correct|pg||
nt|3for3: that is a very good hand for a 15-17 nt|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: colan|pg||
nt|3for3: 3nt down in other room i am told|pg||
nt|dburn: it is, but what could you do? open 1@c and rebid 2NT?|pg||
nt|3for3: so, spector back in the lead|pg||
nt|3for3: that is what i'd do|pg||
nt|3for3: oh, my spies misinformedme!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobh1: but i think he can manage|pg||
pc|cT|nt|algraves:  no ! assume more key card, ie asking for informatino|pg||
nt|algraves:  I suspect 5NT showed interest as he could have bid 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: 5d asked for kings|pg||
nt|algraves:  So this showed the Kick back method of asking for Key cards, ie one above agreed trumps to advantage|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT down? not according to this|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|algraves:  So well done|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d2|pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2:  No, but it can be set|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mesbur-Fitzgibbons??|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, it would go about four down on a heart lead, but...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2:  heart, spade back|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: kibs are taking both sides of this one|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobh1: Zia @C play is not popular with the naysayers|pg||
nt|algraves:  easier when you can see all 4 hands and are in the back row|pg||
nt|bobh1: of course we can all see much more of the deal than Zia can|pg||
nt|algraves:  but that is the kibitizers long held right|pg||
nt|algraves:  without Oscar the Owl the game would be poorer|pg||
nt|bobh1: Zia plays MUD it appears|pg||
nt|bobh1: this may be a source of confusion for Joel|pg||
nt|bobh1: normally a player leading the 5 then playing the 9 would have the Q|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a timed event but long pauses for thought are normal and permitted|pg||
nt|bobh1: when they start to add up, the director starts getting nasty|pg||
nt|algraves:  Well Woldridge can build a club trick with the right view but that is hardly clear|pg||
nt|bobh1: no timers...if the table is slow, then we start arguing about whose fault it was|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  And you can deny declarer access to dummy to take the club finesse|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bigtrain: he goggled the answer :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i couldn't stand the strain of waiting :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|danilo1: once Zia led @C (and not @HK), he is doing best to continue - and force declarer's @C decision immediatelly (he may have led from Q95(2)) ... after all, East did not Dble 4@S ... ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: and he is "known" to have probably @HQ (no @H lead) and 5 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: right walter|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: ...if anyone actually led a heart, his copy of the hand records should gently be removed from him before allowing play to continue|pg||
nt|3for3: i think meckwells nt range is 14-16 here, so clearer for him to upgrade|pg||
mc|8|nt|ahollan1: but no --  didn't use google|pg||

nt|bobh1: maybe he just claimed and they conceeded|pg||
nt|algraves:  he played a second Club first of course|pg||
nt|algraves:  Always difficult to bid those type of grand slams because you can talk yourself into a conservative position|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: contract here is 3n by south|pg||
nt|athene: this might go (2@S) X 3@C lebensohl 3@H 3@S 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Sabine Auken and Paul Marston recommend that you lead from your four-card suit rather than from the five-bagger. They would have defeated it|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well if north bid 3@D rather than 3@C actually that is more likely|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: the battle of the mjors coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s may get toohigh|pg||
nt|algraves:  requires partnership trust and \ or personal courage|pg||
nt|algraves:  so the loss on board 49 was 4 imps when Meckwell played 2@H making|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks in spades on the lay|pg||
nt|bigtrain: serving nother neb|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ady: south has a useful hand   decent spades with 2 outside aces|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 49 at other table, Jeff Meckstroth overcalled the Precision 1@D with 1@H, as his two small spades and likely (possible) spade lead or switch after short 1@D opener and his ...|pg||
nt|petergill: minimum values opposite passed hand made 1NT unattractive |pg||
mb|1H|nt|barnets:  spector gained 10 imps on board 63 when n/s bid game here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
mb|3C|nt|algraves:  They have a way to invite in @S shoiwing 5|pg||
nt|algraves:  so this shows that hand|pg||
nt|algraves:  invitational with @S 5|pg||
nt|3for3: ok, next board for me to misanalyze|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets:  so the lead now is 65|pg||
mb|3N|nt|algraves:  I suspect we did not quite see the play correctly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: well stopped|pg||
nt|algraves:  and he trusts his partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd on Roland's list of terrible bridge terms|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: from declarer;s perspective..club length is unknown after 1d opener|pg||
nt|barnets: if declarer ducks a club east might shift to a spade and  may possibly set up one club 2 diamonds one heart and one spade trick for the defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  yes although that was not a minimum hand with two tens and 2 Aces, 2Kings and a working j|pg||
nt|algraves:  certinaly suited for play in Hearts though, the classic 4-3 fit type hand , strong trumps and prime cards outside|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49: Yes. I think it was mostly the spade holding that deterred Meckstroth from 1NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  to facilitate ruffing in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49: wd Meckstroth anyway|pg||
nt|3for3: no alert, but we can assume zias 3@C was preemptive/mixed|pg||
nt|dburn: luckily for Nickell, neither of those superb players is qualified to play in the US trials - still, there are doubtless some vacant properties still in Monaco|pg||
nt|3for3: this 3nt looks flat|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|ady: declarer will be pleased with the 9 tricks    not certain to make |pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzfk: not real bidding|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: 10 tricks in OR   a good return|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll take the declarer|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobh1: here's an auction and a defense we can all understand|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say he wins and plays a spade now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bigtrain: declarer can set up 3 spade winners (at least DD)|pg||
nt|barnets: now dec is a tempo ahead|pg||
nt|barnets: he may have gone wrong before|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|algraves:  My Mom would bring this in, with her only consistent line of play|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm this is a bit interesting|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wants to go over to dummy and finesse hearts to keep east off lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sry put contract i to follow play|pg||
nt|athene: but if he cashes the @DQ whilst he is there, he sets up diamond tricks and an entry for east|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: msy make 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: maybe he will now decide he has to just bash out hearts from the top|pg||
nt|athene: you can't really make use of the @h98|pg||
nt|athene: for example club to king, heart to jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Cheek thinking|pg||
nt|athene: because if that finesse lost, a club return would tangle your entries|pg||
nt|barnets:  he may x to dummy and lead the @H 8 to the J|pg||
nt|athene: yes, maybe you can do that, and then duck if west wins and shifts to a club|pg||
nt|barnets:  ibut a club retun hurts transport here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|algraves:  Hurd is a terrific player , dont get me wrong, but at some point.... as I said. It is a good debate when the stakes are 4-6 imps|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|algraves:  which was to pull trump and take whatever finesses were about|pg||
nt|ady: a squeeze materialised on east|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h3|nt|algraves:  on this hand there are none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe at this point he is regretting ducking the first trick as it gives him slightly less elbow-room for a throw-in ending|pg||
nt|athene: but he was not sure spades were 6-1, meckstroth being in first seat at favourable, i guess|pg||
nt|barnets:  he could duck it thouhgh|pg||
nt|bigtrain: briar patch|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=K9+J5+AK9+AJ9632  17.6 that last S hand, so Meckstroth was right to upgrade to a strong club|pg||

pc|cT|pc|d4|nt|barnets:  and is ok|pg||
nt|athene: well now it's ok as he can just duck the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: thanks to that @C9|pg||

pc|c7|nt|3for3: and borderlind whether to upgrade to 18|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|barnets:  so well played|pg||
nt|barnets:  playing hearts from top would be silly had east the @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: this line would only be wrong if west had all the clubs, QJ10x|pg||
nt|3for3: i am sure with the 10 of clubs, we'd have seen a different auction|pg||

pc|d3|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 46: The operator at other table on Bd 46 wrote that he did not have time to see the bidding and play, hence he could only see that it went spade lead, 2nd spade then we know not ...|pg||

nt|athene: double-dummy you can make this of course, but in practice i think it will go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Eric tanking|pg||
nt|athene: probably going to lose a diamond, two hearts and one or even two trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: i had many ims about the last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: if the play was as recorded south would have made it had he ducked the @CJ|pg||
nt|ady: east suitable with not much in spades opposite a likely shortage|pg||
nt|dburn: not obvious what the right line is on a passive lead, but everything rational will work|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ady: nice easy hand to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s kept out of the bidding    in fact only 8 tricks in spades with the 4-0 split|pg||
nt|petergill: normally 5@S (if queen ask) shows all keycards, but here Zia knows that Hamman cannot bid 7@h, having limited his hand via 2NT|pg||
mb|5N|nt|bobh1: the 4@S contract went down in the other room so the match tightens up|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: had he won the club ace he was down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: he is|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: this will be quick now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|algraves:  on board 20 he had a winning position as the defense went and of course brought it home|pg||

pc|sA|nt|athene: because there are three small singletons and only one king|pg||

mb|1C|nt|bigtrain: 2@H is intermediate|pg||
mb|1S|nt|algraves:  the big club players these days have developed a keen eye for what auctions make it hard for the opponents to bid accurately|pg||
nt|algraves:  for instance on that hand some standard experts would raise to 2@H to make their game auction easier in case partner has strong hand.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H ony choice|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     e/w  might win the auction in hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: needs a bit more to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D is michaels|pg||
nt|dburn: likely flat, because Meckwell have lots of wrenches, but still...|pg||
nt|3for3: featherweight opening by hurd|pg||
nt|3for3: I guess he likes his shape and good spot cards|pg||
nt|dburn: not exactly a Mike Tyson overcall by Hamman either|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|Walddk2:  Down 2?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Spector has found the 4-1 split  |pg||
nt|3for3: 3@D a fit jump, likely|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S will be too|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: 2NT showed exactly 3 spades, hence E knew that they had a 5-3 spade fit. I'm not sure how West asks for @HQ|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@d must be something special - can't believe it's just diamonds and clubs; what about hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: i can't see what was written|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  playing precision you know partner is limited so game in unlikely unless partner can start jumping aroudn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 16+ unbal  18+ bal,   2@D = game force 5+@D|pg||
nt|athene: nice @S10 makes 3nt very comfortable here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 97 might be misscored|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: thanks|pg||
nt|3for3: 4nt ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: how about x for the flexibility|pg||
mb|4N|nt|algraves:  so 1@S muddies the waters a little bit more than 2@H|pg||
nt|petergill: I think with his good 19 count, West intended 5@S as a queen ask, but when it's Hamman who passes 5@S, one tends to think that Hamman is usually right |pg||
nt|algraves:  we are not quite sure what the deeper meaning of the last bid was. but 6@H or 6NT are easy makes so an opportunity for Spector|pg||
nt|algraves:  I bet they are irritated though. That much we know for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D also ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: negative DBL by north is much easier IF 1@D=4+@D unbal|pg||

nt|bigtrain: operators don't listen|pg||
nt|bigtrain: really can't|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: rodwell doesn't want jeff to declare..lol|pg||
mb|d|nt|algraves:  just to finish for board 20 , I suspect that declarer also took the 4th club and then led a diamond to his QT. The defense had no answer to that line|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are splitting up later this year. Hamman will play with Justin Lall in another team and Levin-Weinstein will replace Zia - Hamman in the much-heralded famous Nickell team |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D in the picture   doubt they'll play 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N is not a success n/s|pg||

pc|sA|nt|algraves:  Grue likes to open NT type hands with NT more so than almost any expert around these days|pg||
nt|ady: should be 11 tricks on the lay|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@H is defined as non constructive |pg||
nt|algraves:  by agreement|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Rodwell did not have weak 2@D in arsenal    they play 2@D opener = 3-suit short @D|pg||

nt|algraves:  North is 3 HCP short of there , albeit loose , standard. but they make a nice stop after the 2NT start|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: best for north to duck 1st heart|pg||
nt|ady: then switch to a club|pg||

pc|c8|nt|barnets: after easts 4@D pick a major perhaps west should have bid spades at the 4 level|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: declarer will need to go up with A@C  and get spade right to make 9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: will probably draw 3 rounds of trumps  and trust to good fortune in hearts   |pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: re oops|pg||

nt|bigtrain: doesn't need to pick the spades as he has a strip squeeze on S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 79   Lee 28-5 for the set   leads Fleisher by 48|pg||
nt|ady: in fact can play spade to ace    and south will be squeezed in the blacks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: y|pg||

nt|bigtrain: X-f-2@H or maybe a tactical 3@S|pg||

nt|barnets: so north can show his suit|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: Diamond 35-0 this set   now leads Jacobs by 51|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C could be game force balanced hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so only promises 2+@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: should be 2 crd difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 3@S cold|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they have defined when a pass is penalty and when its a punt|pg||
nt|barnets: this is looking like another swing for spector|pg||
nt|bigtrain: cops being summoned i think|pg||
nt|barnets: my guess is norths bid xx was conventional |pg||
nt|barnets: and south forgot|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: xx forced 2s..some suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: west thinking..of course|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bobh1: is what i meant to say|pg||
nt|petergill: South had a tough bid - Axx in clubs looks poor for 1NT because|pg||
nt|bigtrain: since with 55 or 65 he bids 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  Cheek hopes that Grue has similiar spades as last hand|pg||
nt|barnets: north would like to x for a spade lead but south may have none|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: S told W he had no idea about XX.. conflicts with N explanation|pg||
mb|4H|nt|algraves:  it is possible that South, after being told the Mecks pass was not penalty decided just to pass and let Rodwell start bidding , sure he would not be passing for penalty|pg||
nt|3for3: which they don't, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: Director was already in room and is discussing situation with Eric|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: with longer clubs North would balance with 1NT, not Dbl|pg||
nt|algraves:  well said|pg||
nt|petergill: Time now to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  so on the next round, having limited his hand with 1@D he can suggest max values with a club card|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not sure, but I think this suit is fractionally the wrong side of the odds to run|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1:  68  Spector opened weak 2@D  playing 5@D west -- but @C lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: why can't you beat 3NT?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: will likely be a flat result|pg||
nt|petergill: South has tried to get North to declare 3NT if North has KJ or Qx or J10x or J9x or the like in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opening lead against Zia's 3N was @S9|pg||
nt|barnets: this  should be down 2 for 5 imps to spector subject to appeal|pg||
pc|dK|nt|algraves:  so two down|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes it is normal to bid two balanced hands with lots of points to 3NT|pg||

nt|algraves:  at the other table declarer did take a more complex line of play on 38 and this time, the simple line was best|pg||
nt|algraves:  note that Souths entire auction was pointed towards 3NT by his partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opening bid structure is identical for both pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and comparable agressive approach|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C only one-round-force, right?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: not sure if DBL = 4@S or 4/5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S    invitational it seems|pg||
nt|algraves:  when planning your auction always focus on the likely games|pg||
nt|bigtrain: only NF if 3@C is the rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: They will probably avoid 6@H if they find they lack an ace plus @HQ |pg||
nt|ady: typical flat 11 opening these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Grue has a secret weapon to defenc 3NT   and 3 spades looks difficult|pg||
nt|algraves:  and if possible any positional considerations|pg||
nt|barnets: in 2@HXX defense have to be careful to actually beat it|pg||

pc|c4|nt|bobh1: 10 imps to nickell on the prev board when Kohler didn't cue bid and they stopped at the 2-level|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room west opened 1@H and this made it more difficult|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|algraves:  that is key card in Hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll bet he makes 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzfk: hurd is thinking about the hand not this trick|pg||
nt|3for3: might be thinking where to win this trick :)|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, they are rattling through the deals here but the other room are no slowcoaches - Meckwell flattened 6@s and won 2 IMPs for playing 5@h where Zia might have beaten 5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: probably should win in hand and lead small spade for maximum possibilities..of course everything works|pg||
nt|dburn: not that 5! had eleven on top exactly|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry, 5@h|pg||
nt|3for3: For those who missed last set, there is a potential appeal that would be worth 11 imps to Spector.  Differing explanations on opposite sides of screen.|pg||
nt|dburn: very tough hand for Hurd at the table - easy for us, but he will be thinking "what can I do if the diamonds don't run? what if West has the @sK?"|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|algraves:  I suspect that 3NT was " forward going "|pg||
nt|petergill: so 5@H is two keycards and no queen of @H|pg||
nt|ady: maybe only 9 now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|3for3: doesnt he have 9 sure ones?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|petergill: so N considers 5@H or 6@C|pg||
nt|barnets: for n/s to bid any diamonds|pg||
nt|3for3: no, i cant count|pg||
nt|dburn: I think only eight, but as I said, I am tired :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|algraves:  he knows that Zia has a singleton for his bidding|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes many pairs have followed the Italian style of responding after overcalls which involves picking out specific invitational or better type hands so that if the opps pre empt in the overcalled suit, then partner is well placed to compete|pg||
nt|petergill: and chooses well|pg||
nt|algraves:  2 no Q |pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid by NS, I think|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: NS brief system summary http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=943&pid=722 |pg||
nt|ady: J@C   looked better at trick 2   to protect diamond position|pg||
pc|d5|nt|algraves:  yes I think the logic was that North had encourged but denied a @S control so 4@C showed a @S control on the side, hence the Key card ask|pg||
nt|algraves:  Note that the math of slams is that you dont want to be in slam off an ace and the Queen of trumps because then it is 50 50 in theory that you make|pg||
nt|algraves:  sometimes it is a little more because you have 9 trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: while the bring 680 happens|pg||
nt|algraves:  sometimes less when you have 8 trumps and " handling charges "|pg||

nt|dburn: well deserved congratulations - terrific effort against some of the best in the world|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: hands like this are a nightmare for declarer, who may overthink and actually play for the diamonds to be foul and the @sK to be wrong, instead of taking his chances in order|pg||

nt|algraves:  so just to follow up on the 2@S bid. |pg||
nt|ady: how did that make?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from NS SSF   "Mid-hand honor leads: shift to 10 generally shows interior sequence (HJT or HT9), typically lead rusinow through declarer (except as above)"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: swing action for Rodwell would be PASS :)   looks like auto opener for him|pg||
nt|athene: this could get very competitive if NS find their diamond fit|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: we knew somebody sitting EW would bid 1@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: strong result for nickell in the OR|pg||
nt|dburn: he'll need to steal more of those than there are boards if he's to win this one - still, one big swing...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: was jsut what south wanted to hear    but a normal opening |pg||
nt|ady: both major games should go down e/w    both 4-1 trump splits|pg||

mb|r|nt|ady: did 4 spades really make?|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ady: did 3@H  promise anything   was a leb bid available after east doubled 2 spades?|pg||
nt|petergill: Should be 130|pg||
nt|barnets: and led a " normal " @DK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|algraves:  of course you need to be playing a strong club to give you cover on hans like this , so that the non one club openers are limited to 15|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: 4 hearts hopeless|pg||
nt|ady: is this lead true?|pg||
nt|algraves:  so one can argue wether West should have bid , the point was that NS just doing there normal bidding made it difficult to sort everything out.|pg||
nt|algraves:  They play Rusinow in bid suits|pg||
nt|petergill: or he might play "safe" (unsafe if clubs 4-1) for 110 by not trying the @D hook|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|algraves:  and why not lead a @S?|pg||
nt|algraves:  got to lead something|pg||
nt|dburn: and unless Hurd makes a somewhat unlikely seven overtricks here, plus 300 North-South will score pretty well|pg||
nt|3for3: the cards lay very well for north south|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|petergill: Al, can you see why @SQ is a good play here?|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot, but if Zia is doing it, there must be a reason|pg||
nt|dburn: and I am sure why West raised it, and why North-South withdrew from the auction - they could not know how good a fit they had|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|algraves:  remember the @D bid just said no 5 card major not 14-16 balanced not 6 clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i like 1@S overcall|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge in 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought 1@S automatic|pg||
nt|bigtrain: totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S needs suit quality|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: seems a diamond lead more normal than underleading 5 card suit with the ace|pg||
nt|3for3: grue penalized for super light opening.|pg||
nt|3for3: Of couse, a spectator notes that if he had rebid 2@C....|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe that would have been Gazzilli, or some such - no one has voluntarily bid clubs to show clubs since about 1983|pg||
nt|3for3: I suspect he didnt relish the though of a preference to his 98653 of hearts|pg||
nt|3for3: not gazilli|pg||
nt|3for3: they do the big club thing|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobh1: if it was 15-17, S would invite|pg||
nt|algraves:  well, Grue judged to lead the suit the partnership was known to have, and put declarer to potential guess at trick one.|pg||
nt|ady: whatever led    no chance to make|pg||
nt|algraves:  if King in dummy declarer may well get it wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl makes @DK likely to be offside, so there was a real danger of a @D ruff if @D was played at Trick 2|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: @CA was a falsecard i guess|pg||
nt|athene: trying to make declarer put east with another high card somewhere else|pg||
nt|athene: for example the @SK :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   i think @CA to help clarify 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: well, if he played the @CK at trick 1 and then turned up with the @HQ as a passed hand, it would not be too hard to drop the @SK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|algraves:  personally I like the dash of that lead even though it cost a trick|pg||
nt|algraves:  even though it did not gain a trick|pg||
nt|algraves:  did not cost |pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: dont think it cost  |pg||
nt|petergill: Even with @DK onside, a @D ruff was posible if the @D hook was taken|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobh1: and N wouldn't open 1N altho they often promote and demote out of range hands|pg||
nt|agumperz:  David Stevenson Blog: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/def_1nt01.htm|pg||
nt|bobh1: this one doesn't look promotable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps -- but i suspect more geared toward @D suit pref|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he knew Cheek was ruffing -- so takes opportunity to help Rodwell|pg||
nt|athene: well declarer is just short of tricks now anyway|pg||
nt|athene: even if he gets the spades right|pg||
nt|athene: he had to lead a diamond towards the queen i suppose|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  71  5@S made -- but played by West   too tough to find @HA @H ruff that way|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  72 [3NN-2]    Nickelly declaring 3N South    waiting for opening lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good typing today al :(   grab a coke --  for medicinal purposes only|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 to score  Milner over Mahaffey by 56|pg||

pc|d2|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 118  hurd playing 1@SNorth|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: nice try in the auction by Grue|pg||
nt|dburn: but 4@c doubled might, it seems to me, have been down two|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: another long spade suit for Grue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobh1: 3 more imps to the leaders when 1N went down only 1 in the other room|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: e/w  have game in diamonds|pg||
nt|algraves:  Yes Grue has won the Spade cup so far |pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: will rodwell find a diamond lead against 3nt?|pg||
nt|dburn: problematic for Wooldridge, who would like to support diamonds vigorously and show spades also|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: tHrashing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H transfer to 4@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: looks a bit impossible to me|pg||
nt|dburn: if this is forcing, OK, but if it isn't it might end the NS auction|pg||
nt|dburn: but now South may feel in duty bound to support diamonds, which as far as I can see he has not yet done|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he never supported @D|pg||
nt|barnets: diamond lead and spade switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C game force promises either 4@H or 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: it's not good enough anyway but it would give declarer a nasty moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  es I think he wanted the @S trick now and wanted an entry to hand to deal with trumps eventually and just as you say, so as not to have to broach diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|3for3: oooh, i thought spector was going to play the same contract at both tables for a second|pg||
pc|c9|nt|petergill: There might be an "intra-finesse" here for an overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that line was a result of Larry Cohen's book on Law of Total Tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i used bad instead of new math    Diamond +78|pg||
nt|barnets: against hearts|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bobh1: Joel might have sniffed at slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S by Cheek  stopper showing   and implies concern about @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told   Edgar Kaplan wrote "All 4H bids are transfers to 4S"" 30 years before Larry Cohen wrote about the Law of Total Tricks.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: how about a spade lead v 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS had too much information to play the mundane [and makeable] 3N|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|algraves:  gadzooks an intra finesse in @D|pg||
nt|algraves:  we bring you all the exciting news|pg||
nt|petergill: In @D, lead low to 7 or 9, then run queen for one loser. The term intra-finesse was invented by Gabriel Chagas of Brazil in (I think) a Bols Bridge Tip|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky lie of the EW cards seems to doom everything now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: maybe South could double (which shows spades and tolerance for diamonds) and then bid diamonds anyway|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|algraves:  on a good day this makes.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|algraves:  but this is not a good day|pg||
pc|s2|nt|algraves:  at least this little part of the day|pg||
nt|barnets: now down 1|pg||
nt|athene: declarer would like to eliminate the diamonds before playing trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: schedule showing local timezone of VIEWER  via  http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 more 15-board sets remain to determine Semi-Finalists|pg||

pc|h7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|algraves:  What do EW make in @D ?|pg||
nt|ady: 4-0 split  makes life a bit more difficult   but 11 tricks looks ok|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes one way or another|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: but sadly dummy does not have an entry for the second diamond ruff|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: final board for this fast table|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h8|nt|ady: K@H lead might make 5@D difficult|pg||
nt|dburn: Grue, who stuck his neck a long way out with 2@s and was lucky not to be handed his head, did remarkably well to go down only one|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: still, no great harm done - no one could take a swing at four diamonds, so Spector will win an IMP or two|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Not so clear anyone thinks they have to swing Dror. No big swings|pg||
nt|poohbear: Only big swing was first board and that went to Spector|pg||
nt|drorp: they know they have a bad set, meckstroth nailing the 3N, 118-119 are terrible|pg||
nt|drorp: grue playing 3N with 16 to 7 balanced hands|pg||
nt|drorp: and the 1st board is looking like a push from their perspective|pg||
nt|poohbear: maybe|pg||
nt|drorp: grue's 2@S bid earlier is the proof that he thought they're behind|pg||
nt|drorp: even if rodwell leads A@C and other table goes down in slam, it won't be enough|pg||
nt|drorp: kibs remind me that there is an appeal pending that can change 11 imps in favour of spector|pg||
nt|drorp: so maybe it's still interesting :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Remember there's still a potential appeal from the last quarter, so they need to beat the "spread" to avoid that :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|drorp: if there is a full slam swing (here making and other table going down) deficit will be 10 imps, with 11 on the appeal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zia playing 4@S|pg||
nt|drorp: in that case we can officially say it's over, congratz to nickell, they'll meet with milner in the semis|pg||
nt|drorp: other semi final will be diamond against the surprising lee |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cheek says this is going to take a while to play|pg||

pc|hA|nt|algraves:  he will not sleep well if they lose by one imp|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D is not too bad a contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: south hand perfect for Raptor 1N overcall   but the only top pairs i know who play that are from Scandinavia/Germany|pg||
nt|barnets: good result n/s in open|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: I believe just a short break. 5 or 10 min|pg||
nt|dburn: unlike Zia to pack it all in with quite a lot of slam potential|pg||
pc|h3|nt|barnets: 6@D is an interesting spot|pg||

pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: i'm told  Poland too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was told by many :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: still, maybe he needs a perfect hand opposite, and maybe he is mindful of his partner's dictum: "don't play me for the perfect hand, I never have it"|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: right   i included them in "scandinavian"|pg||
nt|bigtrain: has to break them sometime|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: diamond to ace     spade to ace    cash 1 more diamond   and duck a club|pg||
pc|d2|nt|algraves:  Maxwell Smart was played of course by Don Adams, agent 86 and he was an avid bridge player. I played rubber bridge with him at the old Cavenish west in LA  a baziion years ago|pg||
nt|petergill: Even I (who have lost the Aussie Open Team Playoff Grand Final by one imp twice in recent years, including a few weeks ago) regard overtricks at imps as less important than ...|pg||
nt|petergill: maintaining full focus on the big swings|pg||

mc|11|nt|algraves:  so this is his flashback time here at 86 apiece|pg||
nt|3for3: well done to nickell|pg||
nt|dburn: but Hamman had the perfect hand for Zia's decision - one where the club finesse lost|pg||
