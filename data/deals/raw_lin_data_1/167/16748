mb|d!|nt|rmb1: Perhaps all weak balanced hands open 1@C, 1@D is unbalanced (or 18-19) |pg||

nt|viren169: Strange opening by Cook|pg||
nt|viren169: Is it systematic?|pg||

nt|vugraphzzk: Sorry folks - still early in Lodon|pg||

nt|yo_yo: NS lying 3rd in the published results, but maybe not current results?|pg||
mb|d|nt|eggy: No messing around from Lizzie Godfrey|pg||

mb|3C|nt|bobholl: quiet|pg||
nt|garnetts: I hate the 1@S bid --what is worng with passing--what happens when partner bids "@C?  |pg||

nt|vugraphzzk: Lots of explaining going on|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tthe leading three pairs are guaranteed selection for the Lady Milne Trophy to be played in Northern Ireland on 15th-17th April|pg||

nt|lestergold: cheeky barrage has done its damage|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: west had a serious problem too strong for 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and as we can see 41s a very sensible contract unfortunately not today|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 9 tricks on top and now a real horror|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 6-0 breaks not the way to spend sunday mornin|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards|pg||

nt|lestergold: well i do not want to encourage too many raises with 3 to the J and out|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of the story is that putting a spoke in often works|pg||
nt|lestergold: sometimes backfires also|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why not wait and see what opps do and then clobber bem|pg||
nt|lestergold: because what opps would have done here was ti get to laydown 3N|pg||

nt|yo_yo: but a new partnership i believe|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: just cosd its sunday i suppose|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have known Sandra Penfold for quite a few years she is very competitive --used to play with Rita Oldroyd ( the Rixi Mrakus of the North lol)  She competes pretty agessively |pg||
nt|bobholl: kelly 1@C i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now we have a passout|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kelly opened 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: what dat dere 1C|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|eggy: orry David palyed with Zia, not Forrrester who played with David Herman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: v ery interesting hand with anythin g likely to happen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2cx wont be nice|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rmb1: South will just wait and show her suit in the play|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@D over 1N?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: pays sometimes to lurk in the bushes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Senior passed for a start, so you need to undo all of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jim Griffin|pg||
nt|viren169: the Vul probably kept her at bay!|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: We need a few undos here I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tim?|pg||
nt|mamos: op   look at auction|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: ew went very tamely there although E might think she has good defence|pg||
nt|jcomyn: getting confused|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think anyone would be in  that|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: she might also think she does not have an awful lot of playing strength in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please start from scratch|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eggy: Lizzie godfrey has represented England on and off since the 80s although she now lives in the Pyrennees and plays many major French events as well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and they vul as well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont agree t.o x by w|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who would double, W for take out?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a fabulous place to live|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no but that 2nd suit makes a lot of tricvks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Undo all bids please|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and start all over|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tlc: as long as declarer attacks hearts first, there will be 9 tricks...an early spade finesse and this will go down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: and E would pass under declarer?  I dont think so|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont see why not you must speculate etc|pg||
nt|dburn: if West doubled 2@c, it would show three spades, not be for takeout|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah dont be a spoilsport|pg||
nt|dburn: which is why it's OK to make rancid overcalls if playing against idio... er, people who use support doubles|pg||
nt|yo_yo: count me in as one of those id....s david :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i love them|pg||
nt|jcomyn: children....|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|barbyh: lots of options|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how nice to know you have either 3 or 4 card support|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: well, East at the other table took your advice, and she pushed her opponents to the five level where they went down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rmb1: One doesn't want to bid 5 card suits vulnerable when everyone in watching|pg||
nt|viren169: Upside down signals?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this c ould easily play 1NT fromn either side if w had not opened|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  for standings after round 3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: anywayi am not defending with that w hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: all the more reason to eat you my child|pg||
nt|barbyh: best defense was to return a club|pg||
pc|h8|nt|viren169: Not an easy hand to play or defend|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|tlc: 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|eggy: Her partner Dinah Caplan is an experienced player, but has not, to my knowledge,much high level duplicate history|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a woman after my own heart|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: slightly more complicated now, though|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: declarer may have to get hearts right|pg||

nt|jcomyn: is that the curxse of scotland or was that the 9 of something else|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 9 is of course the curse of something but not scotland hats 9@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: historical reason for that|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lestergold: someone once wrote battle plans on the 9@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|jcomyn: yep thats it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: whats 1S?|pg||

nt|boedhy: hi mike and all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ruud|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome Ruud|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of top players are adopting these methods and ive seen them get good results so as much as my instincts rebel against it there does seem to be some point to it|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Contract is 4@S by S?|pg||
nt|garnetts: last board Looks to me as if NS have pushed to a very agressive 4@S --well its more likely them rather than EW :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Let her open 4@S, all pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: then lead a card and claim when the hand is over|pg||
nt|mamos: This is Board 3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant undersatand that|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|jcomyn: slam anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: me neither|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|rmb1: Another slam Roland would be proud of - played by West to avoid the ruff|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a good slam...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nikce breaks in majors|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3D for me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3D can win in many ways|pg||
nt|jcomyn: especially with slam on|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Kx of diamonds lad from pd will probably best 3N. and sometimes E will elect to make a TO double and EW will get to wrong game|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes i meant in general, not on this specific deal|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer was not looking at defence's cards|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, though, South must have kept all her hearts or she would have conceded in the endgame|pg||
nt|barbyh: 4hts makes of course but lets see if they get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and where did the ca go then|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: there was an american movie a decade or two ago called "Heathers"|pg||
nt|dburn: not an obvious choice for West now|pg||
nt|mamos: looks like inverted raise|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT   coming up|pg||
mb|3S|nt|viren169: A of @D and still need to find the Q@S|pg||
nt|rmb1: What do you rebid - just 4@S ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no too good|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and thats that|pg||
nt|viren169: tough bid over 1@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: make a noise|pg||
nt|viren169: Unless you have a gadget or two to cover these types of hands|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just allow space for e to bid again|pg||
nt|rmb1: What do you suggest John|pg||
nt|mamos: S threw it away|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: I give up|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Strange things happen on vugraph, not easy|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chilloncan: not a comfortable choice for E there either, as X has warts, but so of course do 3N and 3S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and now Kaye is declarer again |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 2NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that is surely that|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: East is there... now it will be hard to stay out of slam.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is unfairly unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: of course, one of the ways 3@d can lose is by pushing East-West to something they can make but would not have bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W could go on here, needs only AKQxxx    Axx  xx Kx|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: even with s 4-1 rest lie nice|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is certainly true david|pg||
nt|dburn: but West might barely have done something over 4@s|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|viren169: 6@H is better than 6@S as the cards lay|pg||
nt|rmb1: It has to be a @S lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the race to Dubai|pg||
pc|c6|nt|viren169: Tough lead to find. I fancy this to make.|pg||
nt|rmb1: and it sounds like @S are 4-4 in which case its dangerous to lead|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W apparently wanted to confirm a commentator's earlier statement that this field is conservative|pg||
nt|jcomyn: are al;l women not conservative|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: lots of oh s on 2 D from N and amusement|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not like the lead of the Q@D--normal to lead low in my view |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|rmb1: Doesn't need to find @DA just @SQ - likely to play for @S length with N after trump break|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|viren169: Lighter dble has been suggested?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Tom Townsend|pg||
nt|mug: good morning|pg||
nt|viren169: Morning Tom|pg||
nt|jcomyn: grand when p has the 10|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tlc: dinah did well to avoid and aggressive t/o dbl over 2@s...there was no good resting spot had she done so|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose that finding West with HKJ represents the best chance doesn't it?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mug: a fascinating deal|pg||
nt|rmb1: Some one might run from a lightner double - even to the making 6NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: must take here |pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: will Brock duck AS i wonder|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|garnetts: play east to have the ace--the lead has cost --and guess what I am not sympathetic |pg||
nt|garnetts: When east has the heart ace I meant the lead costs --a low diamond gains in all cases |pg||
nt|bobholl: still thinking ? :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes probably thinking why didn't I lead a low diamond :) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: little to think about now|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|viren169: or run back to 4M!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mug: Nicole Cook might have doubled 6@H for a spade lead, then again it would be silly to drive opps into 6NT when Christine Duckworth was going to lead a spade from five anyway|pg||

nt|lestergold: accurate defence can hold this to 2|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: round and round and no one one knows where this will end|pg||
nt|garnetts: this could get nasty for NS if North overcalls with 1NT then South might well punt 3NT |pg||
nt|jcomyn: would like to be in the game that doesnt make|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: North will double now --best to use it for penalties against a weak no trump|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|bobholl: X now for @D ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: me I think South should bid diamonds right now |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I like 3@D non forcing |pg||
nt|bobholl: you could play lebensohlish here than 2nt :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: It is usual when 1NT is doubled for the doubling side to play pass as forcing over two of either minor |pg||
mb|2S!|an|one suiter 10-15|nt|eggy: here probably :)4|pg||
nt|rmb1: Some (ladies) pairs still playing a weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn: decent result for East-West at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: very true - in what|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: important match, that - 4th against 2nd, with 4th having the better of it so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Something of an underbid, but just as well I think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good judgement I daresay|pg||
nt|lml: it seems like a normal spot|pg||
nt|jcomyn: HATE it|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: looks like the obvious 1-off|pg||
nt|viren169: some good players also play weak NT! |pg||
nt|mug: as I recall Sandra (and Brian Senior) and Holland/Brunner were the only pair playing weak NT in the English Premier League|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: The South hand is worth 4@D non forcing but it will be taken differently --its in between forcing and non forcing |pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: 1 min|pg||
pc|s3|nt|viren169: Nothing wrong with weak NT in the right hands!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eggy: could well be the limit in that lead|pg||
nt|lml: East has an unfitting 5 count|pg||
nt|barbyh: so they only ope 1 d with 4?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chilloncan: not a very enterprising final pass, but the form of scoring apparently dictates cautions for these players|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: West should perhaps redouble to show a good 2@H bid --pass to show two and 2@H average |pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: whats the besat advice lads for those playin weak. I have a class and it is diffiult to explain whast not to do|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess a push difficult :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: 1@c is natural or most weak no trumps|pg||
pc|s5|nt|viren169: so 3@D should be some values|pg||
nt|mamos: Its difficult to believe NS were on sound ground here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eggy: I suspect a few will punt 3NT with the West hand|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: its a pretty big punt unless east shows a bit more|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for that matter, E might have doubled 1S. and certainly N was close to a game try with 5 LTC (Losing Trick Count)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|viren169: Send me an email and I will send you pros and cons for both!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mug: I don't think what NT range you play is going to make much difference to your results below expert level|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: NS can play lebensol here after 2@D as Bob suggests|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so 1@D would be 5 card?|pg||

nt|lestergold: if u bid suits that u havent got to show what u have got it does make it difficult for opps|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|eggy: Well East won't switch to a small heart now anyway|pg||

nt|eggy: Though I expect that RW prefers 6H|pg||
nt|tlc: seems like 12 tricks are available|pg||
nt|lml: yes but it does need quite a favorable trump position|pg||
nt|lml: and probably the club finesse|pg||
nt|jcomyn: -KJ108 not the best for slam|pg||
nt|eggy: so a little worse than 34%|pg||
nt|tlc: yes,, but the right way to play the suit in abstensia|pg||
nt|lml: no its a bit too good for a Roland slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: Pause as declarer put her hand down thinking she was dummy|pg||
nt|lml: even if you get hearts right I still think you need the club finesse.|pg||
nt|lml: you can't ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|tlc: y, u would...but all is well|pg||
nt|eggy: easily good enough with the cards as they are!1or a club diamond squeeze|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but will she|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont make|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: yes it does all work but they are in the right place|pg||
nt|eggy: which also works a a Show up squeeze here|pg||

nt|jcomyn: good question|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mug: but North's hand was pretty good relative to what she'd show already, she could afford to show her spade control, the six good diamonds were huge|pg||
nt|viren169: I think Cook was going to drive to game whatever!|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2  in best minor :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eggy: quite e few x squeeze chances too, but I think we agree in principle - it's a rubbish slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: reminds me of the sheinwold explanation of the rule of eleven - the number of tricks you make when you bid slam|pg||
nt|eggy: They were more conservative in those days :)|pg||
nt|tlc: i think it's about a 17% slam, plus mb some sqz chances|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i havent m;y rule book to hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chilloncan: 1N on the N hand cashes in when pd has a moderate hand with 5 hearts. it has the downside of possibly burying spades. whenever N would be reluctant to pass a 1N response to 1S, but ...|pg||

nt|jcomyn: another lively hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: not sure how much it mattered but a 4th heart throwing dummy's last diamond must be better then leaving a loser there |pg||

nt|dburn: not the best game at the other table|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT   not going to make|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|dburn: an economics student said to his professor "the questions in this exam are the same as last year's"|pg||

nt|jcomyn: I am not passing that s hand|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a normal 3@C to me by Cook|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|garnetts: I am no fan of the opening unless it is 18/19 |pg||

nt|jcomyn: ah shure thats more than enough these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the 9 sets up I believe but I need to look at it|pg||
nt|eggy: Wasn't dummy entryless though?  I thought a winkle was only for overcoming blocked suits|pg||
nt|tlc: good hand to be playinggood/bad 2NT...|pg||
nt|lml: yes if east gets in she has to give dummy a heart|pg||
nt|mamos: is the East hand upgrade?   downgrade ?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rmb1: NS found an 8 card minor fit anyway|pg||
nt|mug: yes a lot of pairs like the two tier weak twos these days, 2@S showed about 8-11|pg||
nt|mug: the heart fit went begging|pg||
nt|dburn: not that any game is wonderful, but five of either minor will make|pg||
nt|dburn: "true", said the professor, "but the answers are different"|pg||
nt|mamos: on a Spade lead   :)  o|pg||
nt|mamos: I remember going through a test on alerting and either adding not or deleting it to about 3/4 of the questions|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lml: anyway one for the blog|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but what about that 6-3 h fit. I dont like 2S on the w hand|pg||
nt|dburn: here, West probably should have rebid 2@d (or opened 1@d if intending to treat the hand as a minimum, but...)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well 3NT on a 6-5-1-1 distribution a bit hairy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: with 9pts in one suit downgrade|pg||
nt|yo_yo: needs a good view in @C|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: not for the table :)|pg||
nt|eggy: I think that the heart switch may have kyboshed that, but interesting anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: some case for East doubling 3NT, I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tlc: hope heather has her guessing shoes on|pg||
nt|pitiful:  in my opinion west should not pass|pg||
nt|dburn: West probably ought to bid on here - if 3NT were the right contract, partner would have bid it earlier|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south also might have raised to 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: 'in the tank'|pg||
nt|garnetts: not with the standard of card play I usually watch it aint--they need at least 30 --and thats not being sexist either applies to men and women |pg||
nt|garnetts: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: not easy to find heart fit after 2@S|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps West could have balanced with a double, but would be normal to have diamond shortage for that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with 1S allowoing space|pg||
nt|mug: 1@S then 2@S shows 12+|pg||
nt|mug: you miss hearts anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why quibble about 1 pt|pg||
nt|mug: on a free run you do anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  notice if south raised to 2@h it might continue 3@c(?) pass 3NT(?) and now more difficult for west to remove?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: reluctant pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: this may of course get through |pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: you get out the wrong side of the bed this mornin|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chilloncan: there are a few downsides to 2H though|pg||
nt|dburn: could be right, I guess - maybe partner has something like @hK10x, @cA and @dQxx|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case 3NT is better than five of a minor|pg||
nt|dburn: but the odds seem to favour bidding - not least because slam might make|pg||
nt|bobholl: they have to find their 3@S tricks fast|pg||
nt|mamos: these two pairs are inthird and 4th places in the trials contending for the vital third spot and selection for the Home Internationals|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well i asm not sitting on a 6-card major and say nothing|pg||
nt|pitiful:  with K10x @h and Ace of @c then maybe east would bid 3N over 2@c?|pg||
nt|mamos: West has a final chance for success on this hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder what the discard meant |pg||
nt|yo_yo: like @S?|pg||
nt|dburn: I think so|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: indeed some guess for a great deal of imps|pg||
nt|lml: is there a reason to finesse or just intuition|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yo_yo: no it meant @C ?|pg||

mb|1N!|mb|2D!|nt|mamos: hi everyone|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mug: hello again|pg||
nt|mamos: Who is South ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: Teshome and Rosen both played in the England team in Pau in 2008, although with other partners|pg||
nt|dburn: much debate as to whether to open 1@h or 1@d with hands like West's|pg||
nt|dburn: the danger is that you might lose the heart suit if you treat the hand as minimum with diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South is  Nygren|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello again|pg||
nt|dburn: and I didn't know all that much about Dinah Caplan before this weekend, but she's been playing like Edgar Kaplan|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I know lizzy Godfrey too  but not her partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome back|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk4: Hello Mike and David|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: which is what has happened|pg||
nt|eggy: think that if you open 1D, you have to be prepared to reverse into hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are having a good weekend,  top spot after 14 rounds|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: although East might have saved the day by bidding 3@h anyway, but that is murky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Surely after partner bids 2@s you should bid 3@h|pg||
nt|eggy: even though minimum in points|pg||
nt|dburn: good morning|pg||
nt|dburn: the club overcall to her left and that diamond bid from partner ought to discourage Kaye from thinking too hard about slam|pg||
nt|mamos: rehi|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think 2@H has already discoured her|pg||
nt|dburn: not enough - if it had, she'd just have bid 4@h without giving information away|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is she thinking of game?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nothing to stop p holding SK|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|eggy: But it's more tricky if ypu have to do it at the three level|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - if you're going to open 1@d, you should be prepared to reverse|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C checkback (?)|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of bidding for a 20 20 hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|rmb1: ... or something else, any guesses about 2@D|pg||
nt|mug: did North bid 2@D or 2@H operator?|pg||
nt|dburn: very law-abiding|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, partner could have it - but that still leaves a lot of losing clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: isnt that K@C sitting under the club bidder?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: @cA, @sK and enough trumps is too much to hope for|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree that D bid too off-putting|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: Hi John and David|pg||
nt|dburn: although East-West might illegaly have made nine tricks in spades also|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rmb1: ok|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|dburn: that lead might not work too well|pg||
nt|eggy: I'mm retty sure she would have bid 2H, but perhaps lost her nerve when the bidding returned a level higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  And surely South, who has defense ONLY against spades should not double 4@s|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not "surely" - doubling what's in front of you is often a good idea|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: declarer has some ways of going down|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  On the other hand she will now be -550|pg||
nt|jcomyn: aternon|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: even 4@h isn't completely safe, though it will make|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|dburn: this line is dangerous if West has long hearts|pg||

nt|eggy: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: thinking..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: cards on table more thought|pg||
nt|dburn: should be OK from here - East can return a club to kill a discard, but declarer has enough tricks with hearts 2-2 and @sA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: two or three cards being fingered...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|mug: East could be ducking from @HK-x-x-x|pg||

pc|sK|nt|mug: perhaps it's simply too early in the morning to worry about bad breaks?|pg||

nt|dburn: though this lead will probably be good enough|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep david bird's lot|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so the monks would miss @H game too |pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps Kaye bid out of turn in the last match, and the Director told Youngs she had to pass throughout, and she thought it meant for the rest of the event|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer to open 2 than reopen with 3|pg||
nt|dburn: but defending 2@s when you can make 5@h is... well, it is not a good way to hold on to second place|pg||

nt|dburn: three potential grand slams|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S not totally trivial here is it? let's say the defence start with three rounds of clubs|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: now declarer can't draw all the trumps|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the other room Jagger/Seale bid (and made) 6@C on  9 but we don't have the auction|pg||
nt|athene: but south ducks the @HA and now there is a heart ruff lurking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but they wont be in 4S surely|pg||
nt|mug: South's duck is the key play in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: 4-0 trump break definitely causes a but of bother|pg||
nt|mug: let's see what happens|pg||
nt|athene: a bit of bothere even|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i would only this one is good-looking|pg||
nt|dburn: modern game may be to overcall 1@h rather than double|pg||
nt|dburn: but double covers more bases, especially facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wht do u think|pg||
nt|dburn: not all of them sound contracts, but...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose easier to start with a transer to @S|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but hard to bid all your suits and have partner believe them natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an|4 + hearts|nt|athene: double from south now i guess|pg||
nt|dburn: I would double, but I understand 1@h|pg||

nt|jcomyn: rubbitch|pg||

nt|dburn: the trouble is that doubling now ought to be a better hand than this|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway u doint want to find the 4-4 fit here|pg||
nt|dburn: could be right to play hearts or clubs in a 4-4 even if partner has three spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 15+13 = 28  then how many for a void?|pg||
nt|mamos: this will surely get us to 6@h|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@d?|pg||
nt|dburn: not "surely" - North has a lot to discover|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like to see voidwood in action|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hope it comes up|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who's he|pg||
nt|dburn: Easley Blackwood's somewhat vacant cousin|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a jump to 5@D?|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  voidwood leads to 3-0 fits in my experience as I said to an international player recently its always unlucky when trumps break 8-2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hmmm i played in a 1-0 fit recently|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: end|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: north will have to put a lead-directing 3@C bid in to cause a problem for declarer in 4@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt or 4@S now ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont believe you|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you could do that, but I once had a partner who opened 1NT with three low clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: hard to stop in 5@h after 5@d  for Aces|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how helpful is slow bidding here?|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S now|pg||
nt|dburn: well, some pairs play 3@h over 2@h as forcing, and this kind of hand is why|pg||
mb|2N|nt|eggy: Do the panel prefer x of 1S?|pg||
nt|eggy: Presumably inferring a diamond fit, but I still hate 3S|pg||
nt|dburn: not 3NT, surely|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@d OK, catering for partner having six hearts|pg||
nt|jcomyn: where is this heading|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i expect we will get a diamond lead now rather than the club, so no problems|pg||
nt|mamos: undo!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: undo?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well well who would have thought that|pg||
nt|athene: ok, south going for a singleton heart opposite perhaps and an immediate knockout with two ruffs|pg||
nt|mug: reasonable defence|pg||
nt|athene: or this might work with hearts 3-3 in the EW hands if north can win a trump trick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is that voiidwood now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now they cant show their key cards|pg||
nt|dburn: no, that's just a void|pg||
nt|yo_yo: immediate 5@D is voidwood|pg||
nt|mamos: surely better to bid 4@s than 5@d   then after 5@c you can bid 5@d|pg||
nt|dburn: again, it's possible to play 5NT as RKCB in this kind of auction, but this pair probably don't do that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah just shoot 7|pg||
nt|dburn: still, South has already signed off once - she has enough to bid a slam now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we girls dont do that sort of thing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah yes but then you ARE girls|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, that @dK is no good, but the black suit controls and the trumps are plenty|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but yes she will surely bid the small slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: i try 6c|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Does the panel prefer 1@s or 2@c as a response to partner's opening 1@c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: certainly dont like 1s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is getting out of hand|pg||
nt|dburn: really?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6@C means what|pg||
nt|mamos: 0nly 5-5   pretty lucky|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that a pass out?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: I believe so \|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely not|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: will check soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: The way she's bid it, east light as well have started with 2S I think|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they avoided the 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but i see it made|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know why - perhaps North misunderstood what South was trying to do|pg||
nt|mamos: but it didnt do much good|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, 4@s might make - you can draw trumps despite the break, and everything else is favourable|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: yes diamonds on the right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is when you want to go home|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: left to declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East has led, then the final contract is either clubs or diamonds, not hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|eggy: If 1C can be short (probable) then I prefer 1S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not pass|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: ace of hearts, heart, north wins trump, club to ace, heart ruff|pg||
nt|mug: there was a very famous hand many years ago when an Italian led @CA from A-x-x-x in a similar situation|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mug: rather than @DA from A-x-x-x-x|pg||
nt|athene: on the subject of a 3@C bid over 2nt for the lead, you can often get away with very aggressive lead-directing bids in that sort of position|pg||
nt|rmb1: An Jagger/Seale bid to 5@D= on  10 - after 1@H(X)1NT :)|pg||
nt|mug: there was a lot of talk when @CA lead was the winner|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h, on the other hand, will not make|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|mug: can she pick the singleton @SJ?|pg||
nt|athene: one interesting point of theory is what the double of 3@C means|pg||
nt|athene: could be a) strong NT b) clubs c) t/o of spades|pg||
nt|mug: (a) seems pointless|pg||
nt|mug: (b) and (c) both have merit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: in a lot of these situations i think it can be useful to have x showing takeout of the opps' announced fit|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|athene: otherwise you have to pass and wait and then the auction is way higher|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|athene: true - it might depend how "natural" your 1@C is|pg||

mb|d|nt|jcomyn: we have plenty of them here too - the we-didnt-come-here to pass brigade|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with overcalling 4-card suits with good hands is it's really hard to move forwards thereafter, because you are always worried that you will end in a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|eggy: I coming round to the view that opeing 1S is almost never the successful action with this shape|pg||
nt|jtr: Especially with such good @cs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bu surely when p game forces you bid your hand out|pg||

nt|dburn: not particularly easy, this rebid|pg||
nt|mamos: inventive|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: still, no less an authority than Jeff Meckstroth says that when partner raises your six-card major, you should just bid game in it|pg||
nt|mug: this is typical|pg||
nt|athene: ok, that's one problem :) another problem is your partner just gets you too high anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there yar and the end of the s fit i daresay|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps East can infer the sixth spade opposite now and make the master bid of 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it might be if they bid a slam now - but someone will deny a diamond control|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Really West?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those asking , the trials take place on this one weekend, used to be 2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: would have chosen 1NT myself,and got a rotten result|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C interpreted as a cue bid (as it should be in my opinion), 4@H denying a diamond control. Nygren not on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|mamos: cant make even without Diamond lead I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer may think she has a chance now, but no|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|eggy: Would he bid 2S with this S hand though?|pg||

nt|dburn: with dummy in plain view, neither defender will unguard a black suit|pg||

nt|jcomyn: and why wasnt this doubled|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: that diamond shift, though reasonable, has assisted the war effort|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rmb1: Jagger/Seale did not bid 4@S on  12, with the auction starting the same way, but without Brock's aggression|pg||

nt|vugraphzzk: sorry 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Whatever it's faults, this is one area where the "blunt tool" avoids accidents I suppose|pg||
nt|rmb1: Perhaps South should contrive to make 9 tricks so North doesn't feel so bad|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dilemma for East there  , is there an etiquette?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|rmb1: 10 points all round and 5-4 @D beats 5-4 @C fit|pg||

nt|rmb1: Current standings at http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|eggy: true, but this looks pragmatic, it would need a lot of black cards for slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the HAK a waste of good cards|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|s6|nt|jcomyn: werll she sees so much of hanlon and mcgann thats is not surprising|pg||

nt|boedhy: so maybe some 5 imps for begijntje but still BOB a very handsome lead. Think they will win it...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|henryb:  3N is a better contract. the clue is that E-W have almost all the quacks|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
