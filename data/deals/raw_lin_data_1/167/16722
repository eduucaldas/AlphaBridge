nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|cicus: this is match 6, half of which was played yesterday evening|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Baard |pg||
nt|bvdahl: Kippe also won the same championship with Baard Olav Aasan in 2008, I believe|pg||
nt|ady: part score to start|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20    e/w around 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: seems like we have some problems here - the cards you see are not the same as the players actually have|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, that will make things interesting....|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: we are trying to fix it|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate it when that happens :(|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: sorry to say, but there are som serious trouble here. The players have to start playing now, but we still do not hav the right files of cards to the BBO.|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: you can see the result from board no 1 in the bridge movie. 1st board NS bid 5@H after EW fought to the 5-level in @c. Made 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|sybarra: is TD looking for files? |pg||
nt|sybarra: what do they do for hand records? |pg||
nt|vugraphztd: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: It looks like the cards the players play have actually been played before.|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: so the card file you see here is correct, but the boards have been duplicated after an old card file!!|pg||
nt|bvdahl: wow, so no one bothered to double chack....|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: At one table a player said he recognizes the cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Looks like the cards were played the first weekend of Norwegian Premier League in october 2010.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so, they have to start over. Suggest thay take the cards from the last round tomorrow and play them now|pg||
nt|bvdahl: gives them time to make new duplicates for tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like wrong file used to deal the cards|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|bvdahl:  3 vs  7 after the first weekend here and the highest placed team with a decent lead at the half|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Gabor and Bård. Here we go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But they only need to be a member of a Norwegian club|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wish I could describe how beautiful the sunrise is here in DC |pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Now we have the right duplicates|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: So the rules must be changed first if they want to bar foreigners|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bvdahl: I know, but there were still some who didn't like it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so maybe they just took the wrong suitcase :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Right u are Roland.|pg||
nt|cicus: gm John|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello John, Gábor and Al|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: suppose if declarer  gets everything wrong  could go down|pg||
nt|cicus: a somewhat lucky 3NT to begin with|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: and our operator, Kristian|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Welcome|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ok, looks like we can finally get back to watching bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: now we are back, and now with right duplicates at the tables|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see W sitting for 3 nt |pg||
nt|bvdahl: Kippe is probably wuite optimistic about beating this one, but not so much about beating 4@h, so no x|pg||
nt|bvdahl: quite, and please forgive my typos.... :)|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|bvdahl: you don't need to break the rules to create controversy ;)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as me in Romania|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good case to be made for a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|cicus: let's say rather lucky instead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bvdahl: if @c lead here, declearer needs to duck|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Peter.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and now there are no problems on this layout|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Hello Mr. Lund :)|pg||
nt|cicus: N has a strong suit, an entry and still cannot enjoy enough tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Home it seems. Only @C lead to beat it, if I'm not wrong|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @c lead can be ducked|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and you can deny S entry later|pg||
nt|ady: over board on a part score hand     have a chance in 4@H if 2 diamonds are not cashed early|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hae me doubts|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not so easy to see a reasonable way to get that many things wrong|pg||
nt|ady: after losing a diamond finesse  declarer needs to search for 9th trick    possible to miss guess in hearts and spades to lose 4 more tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: is @D lead easy from N?  I dont think so |pg||
nt|sybarra: may see a @H lead|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @c lead, and I think it gives decl a chance|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cicus: spec suggested a 3rd hand 1@S opening by S|pg||
nt|bvdahl: nice one|pg||
nt|ady: found it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: certainly has its merits|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: i think it poor bridge knowing there are 9 spades missing|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|bvdahl: 4 top tricks now. Will have to take @c finess to make only one down, but shouldn't bee too difficult on the bidding and after that lead|pg||

pc|h7|pc|d9|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|bvdahl: I guess he just wanted one trick. If the J loses to the Q, he could be down with a @s shift|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: now a seeing squeeze on north|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bvdahl: show up squeeze against North when W runs the hearts now|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|cicus: W's spades could have been AKQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks lke gadget bid |pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4@s seems to make EW on account of the @cJ being onside|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@S  on slender values    more likely stiop in part score|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bvdahl: 4@s and 3NT makes, but 3 NT is preferable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: additional vugraph tables can be viewed using  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why not play in d game will never be missed on this hand|pg||
nt|bvdahl: might be pushed higher|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: 3NT best    but my play in 4@S    also ok|pg||
nt|cicus: @D game goes down I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: Eide might just bid 4 @S not wanting to bid again over 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: and he did it faster than I could type|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: good point|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: once east has opened 2@S   then game more likely to be bid|pg||

nt|bvdahl: 3 @h shows singleton|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bvdahl: 3 @c is so weak that pd should not bid 3 NT with 18-19 NT|pg||
nt|cicus: 6 or 7?|pg||

nt|ady: this may be a swing for Hordaland|pg||

nt|bvdahl: @sJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|jcomyn: god lord|pg||

nt|vugraphztd: convention card EW: http://1833.bridge.no/Helgemo_Helness.html|pg||
nt|bvdahl: it used to show 5431 shape with 3 card major. Not anymore :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3@c makes if he decides to play S for Hx in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: to defeat 3Nt after @h to Q S have to play @CK!|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but the laternative is to play small @c from hand, playing N for Hx|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: good contract, 7 is definitely bad|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but I guess he needs to ruff 2 @h's anyway, so he needs spades 2-2|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: yes    good point    this might still go down|pg||
nt|ady: yes   also true|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sQ|pc|c5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: in all respects except 1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: needing a finesse + trumps not 4-0|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bvdahl: but this line accounts for KQx in S, of course|pg||
nt|cicus: small from hand as well|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but presumably play small from hand to play N for Hx, so you will not play @c to T later|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: miracle workers Hand H but no this time|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: yes, it makes :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: you need more than just the finesse don't you?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bvdahl: and now there are 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cicus: true, long @HQ does not help|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bvdahl: now it is game over. Just made and a very good score EW|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcomyn: is e not squeezed|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|ady: spec suggested 6@D has chances     but no chance    throw in wont help   ruff and discard still does not help      needed club finesse for that to work to discard a spade|pg||
nt|bvdahl: In mt opinion, Helgemo was a bit too eager on this bid. Helness could hardly hold better cards, so I understand whu he bid 6  @s|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
mc|10|nt|bjacobs: Probably West can control the club suit in that scenario|pg||
nt|ady: well done    fortunate contract  spades 2-2  and clubs playing for 1 loser and not able to guess wrong with  jackj of clubs appearing 2nd round|pg||
nt|sybarra: bridge is easy game (NOT)|pg||

mb|3N|nt|bvdahl: no, @c jack is not an enty because E has Qx so S can deny the entry if he wants|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: heavens to betsy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: pretty timid stuff there|pg||
nt|cicus: that's why I dislike nonforcing NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: anyway, a @H must be ruffed and therre are still 2 clubs to lose|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but the play was @c to Q and K - and here @C back defeat|pg||
nt|bjacobs: actually, 1NT may well be a worse contract than 4@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree completely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: with North's entry gone|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 11 tricks on bidding|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bvdahl: looks automatic. S has no other lead, I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: keeps partnership harmony to lead his suit|pg||
nt|bvdahl: If pd is bigger than me, I always lead his suit. If not, I might consider an alternative....|pg||

nt|bjacobs: "conservative"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you describe it as "daft", you are going to run out of adjectives when something really stupid comes along|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: some masochist set this one|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I was talking about a @h back instead of @d j|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Why that agressive lead from S? If she belive it down a @H often use to be a good lead.|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It does seem strange.  If 2@H is GF (2/1), then you really need 1NT to be forcing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|cicus: I agree|pg||

mb|2S|nt|cicus: I think N will accept an invitation|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not now he wont|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Personally, I think that's a good auction ... definitely un-daft|pg||
nt|cicus: but no invitation here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "prediction is very difficult -- especially of the future"|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: Coffe|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|vugraphztd: some cards dropped out |pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: with shoret spade in dummy, small @s is probably the best lead|pg||
nt|bvdahl: you will need some help from pd regardless....|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|bvdahl: what do I know.... ;)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The team names are counties|pg||
nt|dburn: was wondering who this Midt-Trondelag was|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I still stand by my statement. If declearer holds KQ98 in spadesm you will have a hard time to raise them regardless|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe but thats a hefty 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: Only 10 tricks in OR...?|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|bvdahl: the J is right if decl has KQ9|pg||
nt|dburn: true, but he might have bid 3NT with @sKQ9 alone, when a low spade lead would be a pity|pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like a fairly easy 11|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|bvdahl: 2 x clubs shortens declearer, so he didn't take any spade finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: be back in a mo folks|pg||
nt|ady: only 10 tricks  because of club lead   and tap in trumps   could not afford spade finesse when in 4@H|pg||
mb|4N|an|()|mb|p|mb|5D!|nt|ady: no spade lead may well defeat 3NT if defence is sharp later|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: so missing the spade position could lead to 3 down, but fortunately for decleared, the odds are in favor of playing S for the Q|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: Kaplan Rubens Hand Evaluator says North worth 14.75  [doesn't like Q]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: check out http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: yes, but it is a matter of what is right most of the time. J is right when decl has exactly KQ9|pg||
nt|bvdahl: while a small spade handles a lot of the other distributions|pg||
nt|dburn: true, but you don't know how many tricks you need from spades - even if declarer has @sKQ98, it may work to lead high if you need only two tricks from the suit, but it won't work ...|pg||
nt|dburn: to lead low|pg||
nt|ady: this may well be a much needed swing for Rogaland|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I agree that on this auction there is a good case for a low spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: maybe but i cant see anyone leading anything but SJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: since he can cope with 4-2 distribution in that case|pg||
nt|ady: might get spade wrong when south shows with 4 hearts  though normally best odds is to play south for queen where you can score 4 tricks even on bad split|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so after predicting hthey would not find 6@h's I now predict they will make it :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|dburn: slightly off-centre to double rather than bid 2@s with the South cards|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe you should not pass a strong NT with 2 aces and vulnerable at teams|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East is rubbing it in, allowing plenty of overtricks, to make N/S feel bad|pg||
nt|bvdahl: watch me go 0-2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: making only 4 seems a trick too few (or so)|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Might be prudent to keep going|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But of course, it would be a phantom|pg||
nt|bvdahl: wow, that is some kind of 3@s opening|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but leads to std contract|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: can West now jump to 3@s?|pg||
nt|ady: surely would have got to game  if east had passed    west likely open 2NT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: many "old fashioned" players would not with jxxx of hts |pg||
pc|d5|nt|cicus: I wonder why N found attractive to bid on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It does seem quite undisciplined|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe 4@C has implied willingness?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally 4@C says  "I know what to do if they bid game"   [not YOU]|pg||
nt|cicus: S has a clear X now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "clear" eh?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's wondering about 6@S I reckon|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: flip-flop North's @S & @D and it is clear-cut 6@C        of course that would mean this deck has 15 @S but ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I agree, he cannot possibly know whether diamonds are controlled, and East is likely to lead the suit|pg||
nt|cicus: not only has he 21/" tricks in @Hs, trump ace but @DJxxx may be a nuisance as well|pg||
nt|cicus: 2 1/2|pg||
nt|cicus: and then I do nozt count on a @C trick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too difficult to make a decision other than x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point -- must worry about what to say to Committee|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it's often hard to think straight in this situation ...|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, he should have|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he might have... but he will get another chance|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some help from NS?|pg||
nt|cicus: is this true?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: hence the statement 'std contract' :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: well, South's bid is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|pelu: S = 911|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Hoftaniska gone to the toilet while his pd was thinking. still not back|pg||
nt|cicus: Defence is likely to be @CK overtaken, @HK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or overtaken and a diamond through?|pg||
nt|cicus: unless @S cashes @SA first, not to get endplayed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A heart through would be sad if South has @H10xxx and @DAQxx|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bvdahl: the difference is that the contract is played from E instead of W|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: but it might not work out very well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe @CJ lead to entice @H over @D     or is that way too deep|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I think the correct defence is @SA, then @CJ which should be suit-preference for hearts|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bvdahl: very nice lead|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure declarer can handle this - if he draws trumps, he has too many black-suit losers|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: It is not unnormal after 1 and 2@H from N|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bvdahl: both E and W had a little extra for their bidding|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|dburn: and if he doesn't, he will lose too many club ruffs|pg||
nt|bvdahl: can't avoid @c ruff and then he is automatically down|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|cicus: I this 2@S was a gross underbid|pg||
nt|bvdahl: S's balance let W show that he had a 2.5@s bid on the second round|pg||
nt|cicus: *think|pg||
nt|cicus: E had no option but pass that|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I don't necessarily agree that 2@s was an underbid. E is very strong, but swap his minor suits, and 4@s is not such a great game|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any to ..... it must be N who gave best help, but anyway a good player.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: now he might get 12|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cicus: I think W was a K and the 5th spade stronger than minimum, and he has already denied as much as 8 points|pg||
nt|pelu: now 11|pg||
nt|cicus: but I agree, the game is not great|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bvdahl: sorry, no|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: true also|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|dburn: well, if South had a diamond honour then North would almost surely have the queen of clubs|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I also think that E would raise to 4 on some hands that are weaker than the one he's got now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bvdahl: difficult hand even without the @c lead|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They are getting into a mess|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s9|pc|dT|pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: If declarer had led a heart from hand, West might have put in the queen, which kills the defence ... now there is less problem|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now South must play @HA|pg||
nt|bvdahl: would be a trump squeeze if N had A@c|pg||
mc|11|nt|dburn: whereas if North had both diamond honours, then South might have the queen of clubs, so this was probably the best line|pg||

nt|bvdahl: depends on whether or not he showed any values by passing the x|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|pelu: over 1@S many play that jump yo 4-level = void, and 3Nt = unknown singleton (splinter)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in Norway, most play jump to the 3 level as showing singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@H - 3@S is unknown splinter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Liked 5@S before any other bids.|pg||
nt|cicus: seems 5@S looked for @C control|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but this system u can combine with 3@c and 3@D as Bergen|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, 5@s makes it difficult to find 7. Give S A@c insted of KJx, then grand is cold|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quality at the @S might|pg||

nt|rodal f: Pass|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: true, 2@s didn't promise anything, so Helness may have taken the view that if Helgemo could bid 4@s facing nothing, maybe an ace and a king was worth another move|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|ady: even with K@D more in west hand   slam down on a heart lead    |pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ady: 1nt X would have been interesting    big difference on opening lead    Q@D  down 1  spade lead  defence might make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s5|nt|bvdahl: But Helgemo probably doesn't have a very distributional hand since he didn't splinter in the way to 4@s|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or bud 3@h as you say|pg||

pc|c5|nt|cicus: how does N know they have @C control?|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|rodal f: AK at @S is ok for the lift K ain't ok|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||

nt|jcomyn: do i detect a black knot here|pg||
nt|cicus: was 2@S @H's?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: TD Per Nordland have just been at the table to tell the players to play faster|pg||
nt|bvdahl: North could also bid 4@s, of course, and possibly should have|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but I still think S had something in reserve|pg||
nt|ady: maybe not costly missing game    west might have taken the sac against 4@S  and lose 200 instead of the 170 as it is|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Even if hearts behaved you would be 1 trick short in 6|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sQ|nt|pelu: but no ciebids - N jusr took a gamble :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, W opened weak 2, so if you are sure he's got the @cK, then you duck, but you can't be sure. But obvisouly when E play low it is an indication|pg||

pc|c3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|bvdahl: cunning @sK from helness. Made it look like his stopper was weak|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well the killer was clear: 4@D took them beyond their "end signal" bid, so 4@H was now a relay|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the error here is West's ... he failed to plan the auction |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Relayers generally use 4@D as an "end signal" - it says, "partner, bid 4@H then pass my next bid"|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: Here, West was in control, and the 4@D bid was ruinous to him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because he could now no longer make the bid himself|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems so - I once invited the norwegian team to my room fo a drink during the caransa and they left at 7.0|pg||

nt|bjacobs: John, what do you think about this one?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 11 is possible in spades|pg||
nt|dburn: four-card majors, or three and a half card majors in this case|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is an awkward situation for East-West|pg||
nt|bvdahl: if N is psychic, he will lead @dK|pg||
nt|ady: on hand 9   in OR   the leaders lost 10 imps when e/w reached game   strangely in 4@H  rather than the more obvious 4@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cicus: E manufacturing a minus|pg||

pc|h6|nt|bvdahl: yes, +90 probably|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: who don't know whether their opponents are in a seven-card fit or a nine-card fit|pg||

pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: However, maybe running the jack is better, because East might have led @HA from @HAx|pg||
nt|sybarra: but frankly happy to make 2 at the table|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: Anyway, a rather fortunate swing there|pg||

nt|jcomyn: i wasnt good at sums in school|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You can either run the jack, which works against Qx onside and also 9 singleton offside|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Or you can play small to the king, which works against Ax onside, and also singleton Q onside|pg||

mb|1S|nt|cicus: I peeked now and SuitPlay told me to run the J|pg||
nt|bjacobs: small to the king also works against singleton Q offside|pg||

nt|bvdahl: x from W now, is that take out?|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: might be 10 EW, as some specs remind me|pg||
nt|rodal f: Shud there be any reason for that? E balancing.|pg||
nt|cicus: no|pg||
nt|dburn: West perhaps wondering why East didn't open the bidding|pg||
nt|cicus: the reason is this hand|pg||
nt|pelu: your bid: Pass or 3@H?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2 @s is as high as they can make, I think|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have another 9 card major fit with 21 hcp   but only around 8 tricks this time|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|cicus: I'll do the maths later|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 8 or 9 in @s's NS I guess|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: maybe not...|pg||
nt|chick: first someone has to bid them|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Aa had a chance to bid 1@s's but decided against it|pg||
nt|dburn: would bid 3@h, but could pass - don't understand double, which I think is penalty|pg||
nt|cicus: a matter of agreement, in the Robson book it is left open, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cant blame south for keeping out of the auction with a poor spade suit  and a singleton of partners suit overcall|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think 9 tricks is most likely here. a bit difficult to do everything you want to do to make 10|pg||
nt|pelu: also penalty for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I wonder if 3 @S bid would have been the "big hand"|pg||
nt|ady: not so lucky this time     but difficult to stop as low as the 2 level|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|bvdahl: seems difficult to make 1 NT as well|pg||
nt|cicus: but I play it as penalty, too|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I just asked the question :) The distrubution was good for a take out...|pg||
nt|rodal f: See 9 now if S duck first @H and or @D returned|pg||
nt|pelu: ok: fast X = penalty - slow X = take out :):)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: west might play a low club after the diamonds    if so best if north plays Q@C    and clears spades    but not easy to see|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|ady: south already parted with 1 spade|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: now 2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: after the opening, they will not stop|pg||

pc|d6|pc|s3|pg||
mc|8|nt|bjacobs: it's a very tricky suit ... because if the jack gets covered by the queen, king and ace, you have to decide whether to finesse on the way back|pg||

nt|jcomyn: crazy contract in open room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And a daft one here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so likely we will start at top of NEXT hour  |pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3@d shows h's, I would think. E wants to figure out if W holds AK of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: yes... I guess it might ba the best line when you see @d's 4-0|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And that's about the only chance after West doubles 4@H as he did in the open room|pg||
nt|ady: somewhat unlikely|pg||
nt|bvdahl: same auction in the open room|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: well p did double with his super 3-count|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Honestly, the CR auction makes more sense to me than this one|pg||
nt|cicus: middle @D for 3 tricks there?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now toy are losing it bill this is the closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: when I play multi, I like using 3@c showing a maximum weak 2 opening, and then transfer to the suit with minimum|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so 3@d would show @h's and minimum|pg||
nt|ady: next hand last of the session|pg||
nt|ady: this should be quick|pg||
nt|bvdahl: as long as Kippe plays diamonds when he gains the lead with @HA, EW will be held to 11|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 30 mins delayed due to problems with duplicates. Lunch break after next board. 2nd half of round 7 starts 16.00, 65 mins from now.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bvdahl: souths hand is massive now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Austberg's leap to 6@D was a tad lazy|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 1 down? NS will get 3@d tricks, and not possible to ruff more than max 3@h's|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|bvdahl: yes, not many losers, really|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bvdahl: that leap was not lazy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It was, but it may be winning|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR 4 @D-tricks|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ruffing finess in @c's is of no help|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|pelu: that @C10 only help decl |pg||

nt|jcomyn: or are we all going daft|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|chick: What do you suppose 4@H means?  The suit I need help in?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: found the critical lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think Molberg makes it|pg||
nt|ady: see if he takes your line Roland|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think 4@h's shows slam interest|pg||
nt|bvdahl: kind of last train|pg||
nt|sybarra: some times there are just gliches,   we all have to live with them |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|bvdahl: bit not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: When East shows out in diamonds it must with the odds to finesse spades, no?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bvdahl: has to play @d niw to avoid 2 down|pg||
nt|bvdahl: otherwise BS can get 4 trump tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: might take a club finesse|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|chick: a kib is suggesting that it is RKC, another that it is anticontrol :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not enough tricks, David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That only gives him 12|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a club in dummy  and later discard the hearts on spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 4@h was asking for aces, 4@S showed 0 or 3|pg||
nt|ady: more likely to rely on the spade suit  than take an early finesse|pg||
