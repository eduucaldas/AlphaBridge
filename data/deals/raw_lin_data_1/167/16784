mb|1D!|an|1+!d|mb|1S|nt|peachy: Milne team consists of talented young players, who have placed well (though not won) in prior competitions|pg||

nt|tejjyid: 2NT , i presme, is for @C|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.summerfestivalofbridge.com/index.php|pg||
nt|mwigor: it took until the first action on the first board for the two tables to diverge|pg||
nt|mwigor: in the other room milne opened the north hand 1@s which will lead to a very different auction|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzq: Hi all|pg||
mb|4D|nt|tejjyid: interestinghand - bothN and E have submin1@S oipenings|pg||

mb|4H|nt|tejjyid: something seems notquite right EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: martin might have considered doubling the final contract|pg||

nt|vugraphzzq: This is Chinese Taipei Open Team Trial - Final - Segment 3 / 8|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mwigor: indeed in the other room the final contract is 5@cX so this looks like a small pick up for the milne team|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|noodle:  yes and milne mounted a great come back yesterday that kept me up till 4 am :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the 2nd set of 4 16-board segments|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Andrew|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI Shirley|pg||
mb|d|nt|mwigor: this hand may well be opened 1NT in both rooms (but i think) its a strong NT in this room and a weak NT in the other room|pg||
nt|frankaus: The Bloom crew is staffed by hardened proffesionals - |pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: E-W also plays precision|pg||
mb|r!|an|4+!Hs|nt|noodle:  seems ok to upgrade a good 14; as we have seen  opening bids are very agressive nowadays|pg||
nt|panja: good|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: 3/low lead for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both teams are playing 5-handed|pg||
nt|gambit: one @S or dble, close|pg||
nt|sybarra2: go for it!!  great fun Edgar|pg||
nt|sybarra2: you hate to miss 6 @D |pg||
mb|2H|nt|tejjyid: X presume single/suited|pg||
nt|frankaus: Milne crew the next generation of excellence - have been at the top of many international junior events|pg||
nt|tejjyid: interesting problem for East|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: E let S off the hook|pg||
nt|gambit: will N bid spades next. yes if at an economical level |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: likely n/s still find 2 sp or so |pg||
nt|bobholl: @C being a minor makes it difficult to reach them|pg||
mb|2N!|an|minors|nt|ahollan1: this table is same set of players as Q1 -- just flipping NS & EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: "Somebody said down one is good bridge, perhaps making is better." EK|pg||
nt|gambit: nice lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables were not linked, so the closed room operator shut down in order to reconnect. Back now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He will insert result on board 1 in MOVIE soon|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok  did we get names sorted out?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: no|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: who needs 8 trumps,anayway?|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  well it is a great spot  wd|pg||
nt|mwigor: with everything so friendly 11 tricks are possible|pg||
nt|mwigor: but declarer will be more concerned with maximising his chance of 10|pg||
nt|frankaus: my suits never break this faviorable :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  if they did franj you d be playing not commenting :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all of those young ex-pat Kiwis look alike to me|pg||
nt|panja: well..it should be possible to handle Clubs..|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: hi all|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Raija and Al:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrmal to upgrade 14's with good 5 card suits to 15-17 these days, although EW may play 14-16|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|tejjyid: signaling ofr a @C|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes it s a great method to signal suit preference when following suit in a known long suit (like a preempt)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bobholl: will double finesse in @S so 3 just made|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panja: he shoudl win @CJ and run @DJ..|pg||

nt|tejjyid: not that it beats the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winners of this event will get an invitation and $6000 subsidy to attend the 2011 Yeh Bros Cup this coming April|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but highly likely to be flat|pg||
nt|sybarra: just one of those hands :(|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, nowt you can do|pg||
nt|noodle:  re hi every one :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi and welcome |pg||
nt|sybarra2: not sure what happened all  |pg||
nt|panja: the layout, though, is a little anti-% as W did not have any @H honour for his 5 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: Hi|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mwigor: in this situation gosney could probably have won the diamond unless he needed martin to switch|pg||
nt|noodle:  tx shirley   it seems Milne will need another comeback|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+|pg||
nt|gambit: looks like a part-score battle and the reigning suit should prevail|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  the imp is not much  but the fact they ended up in a great spot on a tough hand can boost morale early in the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat  Hans-Nunn play Weak NT   3rd/4th Strong|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Ain't 6.000$ a peace of cake? Is for my workers. OK. Stop now.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe only at the 2 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: both pairs play precision here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I wold call it a lucky spot, not a great spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: false pref wit 1-2 ???|pg||
nt|noodle:  i agree :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  better lucky than good, though :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: auto 2@S, IMO|pg||
nt|gambit: 1@D?|pg||
nt|panja: best to pass dbl|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt 2nt or pass ?|pg||
nt|panja: easier at MP's...but pass should still be a good choice at IMP|pg||
nt|panja: now, withouth source of tricks and with 25HCP, NS might end up in an unmakeable 3Nt|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tejjyid: it's not a disastrous position, but it is difficult|pg||
nt|noodle:  opening bids are getting worse by the second imho|pg||
nt|sybarra: we saw it yesterday, maybe a repeat|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Peake never saw an 11 count he couldn't open|pg||
nt|noodle:  or i m getting old :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: ok we're back live now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|rodal f: Road on?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zone 6 is bringing us 2 fun events in the next 2 months    early/mid February  NEC Cup from Yokahama  [vugraph schedule already posted] and the YEH Bros|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely 3NT now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tejjyid: although PASS stops partner from taking your hand in any way seiously|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: [most of] Milne team is looking for 3rd straight NOT final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 2010 they were 2nd in both this event and the Spring NOT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with a slight change to team for the Spring event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Milne-Whibley were semi-finalists in 2009 while still New Zealanders|pg||
nt|sybarra: then maybe we are all getting old |pg||
nt|sybarra2: 1 @D= 0-4  not a good hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: i think i like pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  often pass is better when really crappy hand|pg||
nt|noodle:  44 in minors an nothing in majors is asking for trouble in the competitive bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should go quickly |pg||
nt|panja: touch and go|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tejjyid: which, since you have complete rubish, may be a good argument for the PASS|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra2: 2 @C = stayman|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tejjyid: I think there is a contradiction between overcalling on not much, and bidding game here on the East cards|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and from there is looks like "junk stayman" |pg||
nt|sybarra2: am told 1 @D = 07 |pg||
nt|sybarra2: sorry thought less |pg||
nt|bobholl: @C handling will decide this 3nT|pg||
nt|panja: @S power lead ...unblock @SJ if you have it...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S seems like confirmation of the 3@S bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|panja: the @DT will be ninth trick as QJ fall|pg||
nt|bobholl: if he gets his @C tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panja: 3@H 3@D @CA @SA sure tricks..|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gambit: Q@H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|panja: @C could give one more...also, possibilities of endplay...|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pass is better - that is pass of 1@S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|gambit: q@C|pg||
nt|sybarra2: easy from here,  but good idea,  not back in dummy too many times|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: ok  once a Kiwi always a Kiwi|pg||
nt|andyv:  good evening Al, Lauren and specs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D not doubled in other room|pg||
nt|rodal f: See -2 at the beginning. The end.|pg||
nt|bobholl: he doesn't know he gets 3@D tricks so how to handle @C for 3 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: good start|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: Thanks Andy and hi Al.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Shen puts down his cards , take a sip of tea|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|tejjyid: A number of spectators pointing out that opening isn't the prtoblem, not open 1@D is the problem|pg||
nt|noodle:  did martin bloom play 2nd set ( I was off ) ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mwigor: looks like 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bobholl: which @C to lead for 3 tricks (he still thinks he needs that|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  good evening Mark:)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: in the other room  Peake bid 2@C over 1@S  --  Whibley's 2N seems much clearer|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|gambit: comeon...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: and many say that both 2@C and 2@S would be natural over 1@S|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|othered1: might west have been better off, in practice, by pitching @C on 3rd @H?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: Ish is X'd in 5@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS need to make up ground and may explain their aggressive bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: NS had a discussion about who showed what sort of partial spade stopper when dummy appeared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what was the conclusion??|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think E showed the best stopper:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish thought the pass by prescott showed about three small|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: it gets tricky when they allow a @S suit with 15 or 16 cards in it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS play  variable NT  1st/2nd = weak  3rd/4th = strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: what a risky 3@S bid...|pg||

mb|p|nt|noodle:  some people think it is easier to bid 1@d over 1@c than the opposite, hence the 1@c bid... i prefer 1@d on 44 minors|pg||
nt|noodle:  hi MJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play 1@C=2+ with transfer responses|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS carding  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs NT the also play "OddBall" in following to declarer's suit|pg||
nt|noodle:  now we ll have a real canadian commentator :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I prefer to open my best suit of 4-4|pg||
nt|noodle:  opening best suit on weak hands is good for lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: brb guys,  checking other room |pg||
pc|hK|nt|noodle:  I think EW played the junior trial the week before the NOT , right ?|pg||

pc|h3|nt|andyv:  nice pull by W|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: great explanation!!|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what does 5@D show?       faith|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if that showing faith means he doesn't trust partner's penalty doubles:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish is now complaining that he didn't know 3C was alerted|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West, maybe|pg||
nt|mwigor: they both played in youth week|pg||
nt|noodle:  they show stamina then|pg||
nt|mwigor: but not in the trial for the australian youth team|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like this auction at all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|noodle:  tx specs :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: precision,...so not our style|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mwigor: milne-whibley (two of the others in this team) made the australian youth team|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Al nd spectators|pg||
nt|peachy: dont see others|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: accepts the transfer:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  seven card suits are hard to describe in middle of auctions|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: whibley shrugged and ish isn't pursing it|pg||
nt|noodle:  as spec points out NS have a different system of answers to 1@c  it might tip the scales|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Indeed, if you have complex methods 1@C is better, as leaving more room to exercise them|pg||
nt|noodle:  I also have a rattle theory when it comes to bridge gadgets|pg||
nt|noodle:  it goes like this :|pg||
nt|noodle:  if you give a kid a rattle he will shake it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's true|pg||
nt|noodle:  MJ went to the other room presumably|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|noodle:  hung and smirnov are well known on BBO :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think South snaffled the Youth pairs?|pg||
nt|mwigor: same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|mwigor: it looks like hung has hit on the best lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Strange to see that some still give from the Mol. HUM. Pass over 1@S? |pg||

nt|ahollan1: there was a reason for @C play  -- i just don't know what it was|pg||
nt|frankaus: leads are a huge source of swings|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but with full weight & good shape, why unilateraly preclude game?|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  probably S gave count on K@s|pg||

mb|1H|nt|andyv:  2@c xfer to @cs|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: roll out the Adam Meredith textbook|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14, maybe singleton|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|ahollan1: pure transfer of   size ask or trf?|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N probably super acceptance|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is anothet scycic option but thats fairly transparent|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nice read by Gosney|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peake also bid 2@S -- i must admit i wouldn't have thought of that call|pg||
nt|gambit: Pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: not that tough|pg||
nt|noodle:  4@s coming up|pg||
nt|gambit: this is going down several|pg||
nt|bobholl: only fair (30% i guess)|pg||
nt|panja: this would be a good 4@H a priori..it goes down because @C finesse loses|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mwigor: i hold four cards in a suit which partner makes a penalty double of|pg||
nt|tejjyid: YOu think N's X is penalty?|pg||
nt|noodle:  100%|pg||
nt|mwigor: almost unplayable any other way|pg||
nt|rodal f: A pay by the opening?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: perhaps passing 1 @S was right|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but maybe easier from here to say|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: and your @S losers ?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: right  if 2@S was size ask, 2N would say  reject NT invite|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: prescott says |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: "sorry if we've missed it"|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: so sounds like 2S= range ask|pg||
nt|andyv:  didn't miss anything|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hmm maybe not|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no way is it 100%; it's by arrangement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat, great shape  @S suit -- automatic 3rd seat opener|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think I'd be more likley to bid 3@H - not so successful here|pg||
nt|noodle:  I like 3N better than 2@S :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact I bet he'd open 1@S in ANY seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: green V red + youth - 5 level NP|pg||
nt|sybarra2: some times you get to bid your 6 card suit |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: and sometimes your pard even bid 2 @H |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|mwigor: david beauchamp thinks that south should have doubled 5@h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, to stop anyone bidding 5@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: although we can see that they can make 650 if they bid on|pg||
nt|mwigor: taking the money in 5@h is a much safer option|pg||
pc|d4|nt|noodle:  agreed  this ia a forcing pass situation double as 2 losers is relatively normal (by arrangement of course)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: S hand doesn't look like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duplicate auctions -- i must admit i would have bid a mere 3@H with East|pg||
nt|tejjyid: seems about right to me as well|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|andyv:  only thing missed is possibly wrong siding this NT:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: i can see "like C" written by prescott|pg||
nt|panja: right...@S loser to add too|pg||
nt|bobholl: after @S ace @C back -2 otherwise -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: 2@S is nat and inv|pg||
nt|panja: looking at the two hands...NS have only 23 HCP, 9-card fit..a second fit in @S...but South's @S are poor..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: explained by Patrick|pg||
nt|panja: the 2@S try had a misplaced emphasis..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: and Yang apparently didn't know that|pg||
nt|panja: still, 4@H would make with @SA and @CK onside..and @S3-2...so that is about 17%...|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: of course - i wouldn't overcall 2@H  but that is a different topic :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: That's an ex post facto conclulsion -- maybe opening and planning to pass 1N (unless they play SNAP, Strong Nt After Pass) isn't optimal strategy.  But I'm not one to question ...|pg||
nt|othered1: someone as experienced and successful as south.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes my 30% was overestimated|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rodal f: To many loosers at S. Why not trust ure pard and bid then???     If ure pard act.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told that the 1700 from 3rd Quarter is showing up on the ABF site, which reflects scores entered by the PLAYERS -- so it must be right   [even if hard to fathom]|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|mwigor: same contract in both rooms - so i predict another flat board|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugrapha2: so looks like C transfer, positive acceptance, and then shutdown|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe as a passed hand you have alittle more scope to bid 2@S - but must surely be rock bottom for it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we've seen a lot of singleton Kings this match -- twice in the first set there were hands that had 2 singleton Ks|pg||
nt|noodle:  I guess tom will tell us what happened on bd 5 :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I Was going to say; 4@D-4@S;4NT (NOT BW)-5@C; 5@S-5N;7@H|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but the key is NOT Blackwood|pg||
nt|panja: so many 11-12 pointer openings this session...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Shen blames Shih's @D2 was not showed up|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|andyv:  not sure what purpose 2@s served...in OR, S bid 3@d (puppet stayman) which makes more sense on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously playing 4-suit transfers it is easier to make mild slam try when partner does NOT like your suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: No inverce here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i was wondering what Adam [Edgtton] was going to respond|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Although you'd be unlikely to bid 7@H as it needs a fair bit, like 3-2 trumps & @S not worse than 4-2|pg||
nt|noodle:  looks like the kids pushed to the good grand|pg||
nt|bobholl: they are a priori more probably than 14-15 :)|pg||
nt|panja: this 3N will become interesting if N ducks @CK or Q first round|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I Was assuming 1@S..|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gambit: south must bid 3NT|pg||
nt|panja: write Bob, they are..and a wide range system cannot do justice to all 11-12 pointers|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mwigor: south opened 2@h in the other room and is declarer in 4@h|pg||
nt|mwigor: (presumably this showed some 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i don't know their NT response ranges -- suspect 1@C-2@C requires 5+@C|pg||
nt|noodle:  maybe the bad grand|pg||
nt|noodle:  but they trailed so it makes sense|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's not bad|pg||
nt|panja: right even..|pg||
pc|sA|nt|noodle:  junior 2@h @H + a good mood|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D covers opened with most 4@C & 4@D hands|pg||
nt|gambit: N|pg||
nt|gambit: wos|pg||
nt|gambit: wos|pg||
nt|gambit: wow|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: heh, true|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mwigor: 3NT will fail so long as the defense gets it right|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough bid for North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid shows Strong NT|pg||
nt|panja: now, after @CK and @C to King or Q, North must duck!|pg||
nt|panja: after @SK rather..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: 4th best lead form N-S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tejjyid: I recall that 57% is the tipping point - it'd beclose to that|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  cleverly avoiding the 5-4 @h fit|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for most [many?] 2/1 players --  the 1@D response either denies 4+@H/@S or hand is strong enough to invite over a weak NT rebid|pg||
pc|s9|nt|noodle:  also note that south has has the 7@d for mosy hands  very important in junior bridge|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s7|nt|mwigor: hard to see how they could get it wrong in fact|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rodal f: If 2@C it normaly tell 5@C at W.      Anyhow it is the best force for check cards|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tejjyid: I think that's more true of North America than AUstralia, although I'm not in the game much these days so it may have changed here|pg||
nt|panja: good|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Gosney responded with a transfer response of 1@S, so North never bid|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|tejjyid: That was the bid I expected here - transfer responses very popular|pg||
nt|noodle:  in north america need high level events (top bracket KO or nationals) to be allowed methods like that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think Adam is playing with any regular partners|pg||
nt|noodle:  very restrictive system laws here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: true, it's not a good method for the casual partnership|pg||
nt|noodle:  it is my opinion that such rules deter young people from the game|pg||
nt|noodle:  that s why it is so refreshing to have BBO|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe - I think the need for restrictions is overstated but I see the argument|pg||
nt|noodle:  ( end of shameless plug )|pg||
nt|tejjyid: The problem is it's hard to test in a revenue neutral way|pg||
nt|panja: the only problem is....S played @S9 ...on third round|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: let's be fair Normand -- the ACBL has more rules than that to deter young and innovative players|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nordman:) It's the problem ure union have since they are to late by thinking. Free Norway as Romania - Hungary - Bulgaria and most others|pg||
nt|panja: so there is no quick entry back to S hand|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat = weak NT   so Hans must start with 1-suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@c interesting here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if DBL was 4+@S or 4/5@S [which is how the Italians play it]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America, the standard is  1m-(1@H)-DBL = exactly 4@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the alert, I suspect 4/5|pg||

nt|mwigor: i doubt martin plays that though|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they.....? Hard|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they alter range exclusively by seat  ---     marty bergen: vulnerability is for children|pg||
nt|noodle:  y all those players tell us vulnerability doesn t matter and stop playing :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: My best controled slam was bidded by 15HP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: harder for North to PASS after partner opens strong 1N|pg||
nt|noodle:  and we go -1100 :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I found that the weak NT solves lot's of bidding problems, but it gves away a lot of information when it ISN"T opened (player is unblanaced) plus it's hard to compete sensibly ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after people bid|pg||

mb|4H|nt|tejjyid: NOrth can try 2NT or 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some might use it as Good/Bad  [so 3@C is better hand than 2N]|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|tejjyid: decalrer plans to pitch a @D, but it won't work|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D ruff @H and than @S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tejjyid: Myfeeling is that a @D was more testing than the trumps|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this was a goodhand for a "negative punt" with the quack of @D|pg||

nt|tejjyid: that @H 6 wasn't the friendliest LAvinthal signal|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks Mark -- keep that From The Table color commentary coming!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Excellent claim|pg||
nt|noodle:  if shirley lets me :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: YOure typing seems up to it ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 rounds of @H then @D?    West may not have enough entries  [South can prevent @SJ from being entry]|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Peake does well|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: totally moot point because North will never lead @H on this auction|pg||
nt|bobholl: well bid and played !|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  well NS finally get on the board|pg||
nt|tejjyid: something like that, getting another round of @D in early seems critical|pg||
nt|gambit: Kind of dull hands so far, hopefully we get some excitement soon |pg||
nt|panja: mirror image hands with EW|pg||
nt|panja: another 12 pointer|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mwigor: martin makes 3NT for 10 IMPs when the other table played a partscore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natural weak 2@D --- how retro|pg||
nt|noodle:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:P64/Bridge/point-count    75321 point count|pg||
nt|fifee: this could be the one :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3N?   2@D??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room in 3@H South|pg||
nt|tejjyid: suit quality is not so retro|pg||
nt|sybarra2: havent been friendly hands,  but also not exciting|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tejjyid: There's an argument for NOrth raising, just because he has support|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: ish keeps on mixing it up :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: funky multi |pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 depends on @S guess but not to good a contract|pg||
mb|4N|nt|andyv:  now 4@h?|pg||
nt|panja: 6Nt will require @S guess or...good play..stripping NS and endplaying with @DQ...6@D will play better, same elimination and endplay..|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: or majors wk |pg||
nt|lmeili: precision here for this table|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C you mean :)|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ahollan1: thinks his hand is too good for 2@S rebid -- or maybe 2@D was a transfer advance?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like the West raise on Hx in the pre-empted suit|pg||
nt|noodle:  NS needed a good board to change momentum  (if there is such a thing)|pg||
nt|fifee: 9 tricks at 3nt with a @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: good valuein a trump lead|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes it often allows a lead|pg||
nt|panja: in 6@C....take @C finesse, remove trumps, eliminate @Hs, then play @DAK and back and claim|pg||
mb|6N|nt|andyv:  2@d looked like LR|pg||
nt|mwigor: if alex wins the first round of @c his pips provide him with a second stopper|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It certainly feels like there is a momentum when you're playing|pg||
nt|fifee: @HQ conveniently dropping :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sure wish i had a convention card or notes :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no surprise --  trump lead would have worked better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Sartaj also expected West to have SOMETHING in @D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: s the world's worst opening leader, I'm loath to criticise - but this auction screamed trump |pg||
nt|ahollan1: my 2nd choice would have been @C lead|pg||
nt|panja: y, right bob, sorry, i tend to type too fast ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  don't need one to see this won't be successful|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: whibley asked something, to which ish said "no discussion"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well correction of 4@H to 4@S surely rules OUT transfer advances|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was Double Dummy Hopeless|pg||
nt|bobholl: this 130 points extra he will may be regret :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: i double your claim -- in college systems were devised to make ME the opening leader|pg||
nt|panja: a good player will take first @C finesse with a small @C from W hand...to cater to a stiff @CK..|pg||
nt|panja: amazing EW players..very selfless...one must appreciate that...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mwigor: its a common mistake made that people hold up automatically - overlooking the possibility of another trick in the suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I would have paid  money to see East make that error|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|tejjyid: let's not play together ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not for money, anyway :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oof   STILL no trump|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gambit: I Love Leb. Great convention. If a partner does not play it, I know they are not expert. Sad, but true. BRB|pg||
nt|panja: W opted for 6@C that E would have played...and E converted to 6Nt that W is playing|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  for all we know 2@h could have been a help suit game try if 2@d was a limit raise or better.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now, let's set up @D..|pg||
nt|sybarra2: agree Cam |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and I play it every where|pg||
nt|fifee: rubensohl has its merits as well. there are combinations of both conventions around|pg||
nt|bobholl: still has to find the @S queen |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  unfortunate game to go down|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: or (at least) intended to reveal that later|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tejjyid: I think South should lead low|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: actually that could be -- if 2@D absolutely shows @S support, then 2@H as a probe that may not have length does make sense|pg||
nt|sybarra2: yes but need partnership agreements for those|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugrapha2: indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: until further notice all contracts are 50%|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they either make   ....   or they don't|pg||
nt|fifee: for sure as with any transfer responses|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tejjyid: with that combination, East may rise Ace to block suit when honours are split|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mwigor: alex might as well claim now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @C pitch by Liam|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh those 2@S :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mwigor: he makes 9 tricks if north has @hA and 8 otherwise|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: ooops  it's Michael this set|pg||
nt|noodle:  3@s will fare better than 2N that went -3 at other table|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth can console himself by thinking they're only 50's|pg||
nt|noodle:  i suspect it is technical difficulties ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Must be, all these guys are pretty quick|pg||

nt|bobholl: yes i didn't say those @S were bad :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will finesse @D now i guess|pg||
nt|panja: now..the endplay is on..but is risky..no reason to reject @D finesse for an endplay|pg||

nt|sybarra2: *Patrick,  (3rd time a charm)|pg||
nt|lmeili: can make 7@d without @h lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N has a lot of play by W (esp. if @s is led)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will dbl here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even with a @D underlead   3N didn't have 9 tricks    that should make South feel better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: per NS convention card 1st seat favorable vul preempts are VERY aggressive|pg||
nt|lmeili: too many slams, sounds bidding test|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: sorry   my [inane] comment was for board  24|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish did observe that DAK lead would make 3NT easy last board|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may be more concerned about the lead rather than take chances|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so really Yeh Brothers (sponsors of this and other tourneys) team is ahead|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Sidney alerts 2 @H , but Patrick didn't.|pg||
nt|gambit: 3NT NS cold, but after E bold Michaels bid, VUL, who knows where they might have landed or how big the penalty wudl be, more than +430  tha is for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: The correct carryover for Weide(N-S) is 13.5 imps.|pg||

nt|tejjyid: I don't like that much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to the point that  2-level = 5 cards, 3-level = 6   so Nunn forced to open 4@D|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and "luck" is with him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW wanting to yell    DIRECTOR -- We Were Robbed|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so what was 2 @H alert?|pg||
nt|gambit: 3NT, no other choice, pard is marked with clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tejjyid: I'd rather bid @D 1st & @S the next time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: full credit to partnership style for this Bloom pickup|pg||
nt|tejjyid: they've invested many hands in it over the years|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Their records must show it's a winner for them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are they both still in their 20s??|pg||
nt|gambit: Yiles|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  to bad payoff isn't more than 8-9 imps|pg||
nt|noodle:  problem is now W overstates his values|pg||
pc|s3|nt|noodle:  but E has seen him play :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East seems to knowhow little West has|pg||
nt|noodle:  all by arrangement i d guess :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Wonder how West bids with a good hand?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: No|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|noodle:  me too   but maybe he s a poor card holder and never has a good hand...|pg||
nt|gambit: You give up a potentially huge penalty for a part score? Not winning bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Hu didn't ask.|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but from N @D discard he knew|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: @DA asking for attitude is much more common now than when i learned to finesse|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after 1@S-2@C, may not be so easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not really sure where Open Room auction went wrong -- maybe the 5@C bid over 4N was wrong Key Card response??|pg||
nt|tejjyid: either that or the trump Q was on East's mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome back patient patrons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other room using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|fifee: 3nt NS or 4@S EW ?|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|16+ any|nt|vugrapha2: looks like it is a 2+C meaning for 1C opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: OK, that confirms EW are playing 15-17, not 14-16|pg||
nt|gambit: not after this start|pg||
nt|fifee: if N doubles, then Patrick may pass|pg||
nt|othered1: many players around here play double of overcall of 1N at 3-level as negative, while double at 2-level is for penalty.  Not something I like to play.|pg||
nt|gambit: nice time for neg dble|pg||
nt|fifee: leb makes it easier at the 2 level|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|tejjyid: 2@S or 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: best lesson i learned at rubber bridge -- if you win $20  that calls for a $30 celebration|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|noodle:  I think they upgrade quite freely though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (via the machinery)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 15|pg||

nt|gambit: 4d is more thoghtful than 3NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: run baby run!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now, if u'r not playing 2/1 this is an ugly buit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *bit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a space-filling 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2@C 100% game force, then 2N gets my vote|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+  but 4@C & 4@D usually opens 1@C|pg||
nt|panja: strong 1@C..|pg||
mb|d|nt|panja: 4@H will not make though, I think|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt has better chances as the cards lay|pg||
nt|panja: all precision players...pass over 1@C first, and then late double...indicates opening strength at least..|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|tejjyid: definitely - thi sis the hand which justifies 2/1 (maybe)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as we see -- it let's partner clarify hand with 3@C|pg||
nt|lmeili: some players might bid 3@s instead of 2@s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  I might have bid 1@h first time with N hand just get away from this mess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, so now we can start cue-ing early, or maybe even BW with 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems now a couple cue bids then some form of Blackwood should get to slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: andrew types faster :(|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I dn't think BW is the right way to go|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess it makes as much or as little sense after a weak NT as after a stronger NT|pg||
nt|fifee: hard to play 3nt if you bid 4@D though|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: THat seems likely to get a director call|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt might make because @C suit dies early..|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: apparently they use 1C=1+C and 1D=5+D, according to heather|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess EW don't have any agreements here regarding passing runout bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strange not to dbl -- i would assume Whibley's pass was forcing|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tejjyid: (but it's a long standing prejudice)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Liam's hand getting better|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 4@C was just natural force|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  it would seem so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: certainly if you can use it at the 4@C level, it's better|pg||
nt|gambit: 5d is a sound contrat |pg||
nt|panja: N is tempted to bid 3Nt??|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H with that North hand is not really justified|pg||
nt|bobholl: thin @C stop :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: good decision by North..excellent restraint..|pg||
nt|panja: now..there might be a bit of tricky play here...@CAK and @C for a ruff..first thing..|pg||
nt|panja: but that will endplay West|pg||
pc|cA|nt|noodle:  2@D was probably GF checkback|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4@C as a natural force seems to be wasting space - why not cue 3@D on the way?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Again, West is making the decision and doesn't have enough information|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hopefully 5@C = 1/4 Key Cards|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugrapha2: pass is low-variance... opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: lead a @D!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: why would you disturb 2@D if you had correct information?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction screams @C lead so 3N doesn't appear to have a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ummmm screams @C lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: The @C QJ are invisble - they bid with filth & East has had no chance to show that he has a good hand|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's a good start|pg||
pc|cT|nt|drewsky: Ill bet that 4@C was keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still not easy to take 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tejjyid: The've got to the right contract, so success vindicates their method|pg||
nt|noodle:  always depends if it was a bidding mistake or a mistaken explanation|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: what does S discard that he can play back|pg||
nt|panja: interesting, should S ruff next Club or discard?|pg||
nt|panja: S can ruff small..|pg||
nt|panja: and then play A and back any suit..|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  and trump lead is called for|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Liam Milne -- 3rd player in the triad confirmed 4@C was NOT ace ask|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the best play for 4@D works  IN ISOLATION  but Milne doesn't know he has 2 entries to hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very niced unblock of @D9!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he will make 4@D without abandoning the entry to hand|pg||
nt|panja: @HT is the entry to cash its winner in Dummy|pg||
nt|panja: ruff higher than @H7 of course..|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: i.e.  what hand would want to punish 1@C but rest in 1@H undoubled|pg||
nt|panja: brilliant|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lmeili: careless play|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lmeili: @sAK then @h or @d|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: duh -- he's a passed hand  thanks Mark|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it does, but I would call the director to find out|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|gambit: now just a question of avoidance and W will never get the lead|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N isn't all that silly, as north must have sound high card values to force the 4-level.|pg||
nt|lmeili: can loose 2 @s 2@d and 1@h|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|andyv:  I think even with a passed hand it's a force for one round (maybe up to 1NT)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still seems strange|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: seems Shen has to make a lot of decision in this segment|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|gambit: 3NT has merit, for sure|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise you are one and done|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: i'm with you on that Andy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet Whibley thought that too -- otherwise he probably bids 1@S over 1@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yeah whibley's hand is happy to defend if partner wants to|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who don't know  1st names around the table   W:Michael  N:Tony  E:Liam  S:Sartaj|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lmeili: E can make still|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|fifee: what if pd has just 10 points? missing an ace or king? then 5@D is not my choice|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|bobholl: best chance was indeed @D Q in east|pg||

nt|othered1: If partner decides not to stay fixed opposite a weakish NT, that's his problem.  And with significant distribution, partner can pull (1=4=6=2, for example)if shaded.|pg||
nt|lmeili: if S has @HK he just needs to keep 2@h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 2 overtricks??|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there's an alert for 1@C wherever you turn|pg||
nt|panja: will this be another 3@H or will it be 4@H?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|tejjyid: maybe 3@C/2N shows full weight, with 3 @C and a bad hand yu can just bid 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is a Support DBL situation|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H now..|pg||
nt|bobholl: not 4@H i guess|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: or sapdes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South's rebid will show 0-2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  almost like the Montery club|pg||
nt|noodle:  do they have this saying in oz ?  1 Peake is worth 2 finesses |pg||
nt|sybarra2: the precision 1 @D in action again |pg||

nt|andyv:  or Montreal|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hey -- i was going to say 2@S=4@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone for 3N by S?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: We do|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tejjyid: it must also show a pretty weak hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: This one might be worth 2.5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S normally 6@S but 5 allowed if "great suit"    you be the judge|pg||
nt|othered1: it looks like they've abandoned the classic Precision 2@D (tricolor, short @D)|pg||
nt|panja: if N had started with a 1Nt response, there was some chance of stopping in 3@H..I guess this will have be 4@H now..|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N will bid 3@d or 3@s|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: not sure if good/bad or what|pg||
nt|noodle:  3 x 3N game pick ups for Bloom|pg||
nt|bobholl: 9 of @H comes down :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: After seeing all cards-yes::)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I think 2N was relay to 3@c to get out|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should now bid 3N and answer the question (or redbl to show first round control)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: scramble 2NT is also sensible... south can't have values after two passes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but a reasonable sequence for 2N to show "2 places to play"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  should Nunn bid 4@C?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: again Mark beats me to the type|pg||
nt|panja: this will not be easy..|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H much easier|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tejjyid: I gues 2@C is 2-way; 19-21 balanced or...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: To those new here , both pairs play precision|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tejjyid: well, I would, but I'd expec a touch more from 3@C|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@D is Xfer, or ...|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and play of @D suit to come.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish and whibley are joking about the DQJ behind the screen before thelead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since only one entry to hand -- after @S lead must rely upon @D2-2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: mildly surprising to pick up in that way against a junior team|pg||
nt|gambit: It is  a crazy system when yoo open your singleton wth 44-14- |pg||
nt|othered1: some are even crazier, requiring no @D at all . . . |pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  S is lucky... lack of entries to his hand will prevent him from messing up the @d suit|pg||
nt|panja: with AQ and A, K in side suits....S should have opted to raise 3@H rather than bid 3Nt.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: NS carding upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|lmeili: in fact S has 2 choices either to guess right @h or to play @cA on side|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|panja: he is looking for entry to N hand..so @DA|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|noodle:  nowadays many pairs use a jump to 4@c to show a big balanced raise and leave room|pg||
nt|mwigor: (interestingly?) all bloom's pickups have come when VUL - while milne's have been non-vul|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes juniors generally bid anything thAT moves|pg||
nt|mwigor: obviously vul is a factor when making decisions|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes I lost so many vul game swing i decided to bid them all from now on :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: but that sort of "luck" can be worth a lot of IMPs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tejjyid: 2@H says 19-21 & Pas says, eys, was Xfer|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes we play that in the Ottawa region|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 18-19, I',m told, and only one way|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lmeili: open room declerar played @h b4 @c, is'nt good decision|pg||
nt|Walddk4: With spades 2-2 you can set up diamonds when the queen falls|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then no H guess needed|pg||
nt|lmeili: yes, so many ways |pg||
nt|Walddk4: @DA, spade to the jack and ruff a diamond. Then @S6 is an entry |pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Patrick takes a glance at E-W's convention card|pg||

mb|p|nt|noodle:  not the 1st 2@s over 2@h psych in the set. is it autralian standard ?|pg||
nt|mwigor: here the west hand didnt meet andy's requirements so he has the decision over what to do over partner's pre-empt when holding 5 card support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hand not quite good enough to bid 3@H  [@SQ worthless on the auction]|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|noodle:  nothing under 5@h|pg||

nt|ahollan1: actually that's 64th board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C was 2+   and i think 1@D was 4+@H  [i know it is without DBL]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D length is just a coincidence|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I think 2@D understates the hand, but I admint @C K doesn't llok great|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for a quick coffee|pg||
nt|lmeili: Double may not show 5-5|pg||
nt|lmeili: but i will double|pg||
nt|bobholl: patrick will pass (iwould :))|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  aggressive opener by E made it easy to get to|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW make 6@D on finesse in @S and @D.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (odd 5@D bid)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S and 5@D are both a mystery to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Whibley thinking 3@C was less than game force.  That would explain 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: how about - 4@S = @C spport & @S Ace; 5@D = 3 @C ACes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 5@D ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could fit Andrew|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hope not - it was an effort to make that up, I wouldn't advocate playing it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and all the dreamers are talking about 6@s or 6@d... I'd be happy to get to game with the E hand:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: there's hope for noble in the other room, then|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is the type of hand that they can take a chance on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cashing at rubber bridge.:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  slam about 30-35%|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and they will know that time is runnin gout|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: the results in the other room have been more boring than here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: anyway, he does have a stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunately -- convention cards don't require explanation of how pairs play the sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: regarding the DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: yes, have to ask|pg||
nt|fifee: tap tap tap and declarer will lose control|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: still, I think with 6 ard @D, you cna try 3@D here|pg||
nt|noodle:  after the pass maybe 3@d ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, you have limited your hand already over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh another guess --- 5@D is operator error and should be 5@H|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'll have to wait for the book|pg||
nt|panja: N should have have bid 3@H that early|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  usually when you have a large number to catch up, you have to decide that one pair will play the boards even and the other will do the swinging.|pg||
nt|noodle:  pard knows you re under 10H and you didn t open a @D prempt|pg||
nt|panja: what was the hurry?|pg||
nt|bobholl: he is better than me (that i knew already)|pg||
nt|panja: note that W's first pass, followed by a live auction double does indicate @S values..|pg||
nt|bobholl: true that makes it easier |pg||
nt|panja: but S could hold @SQJxxx and @H xx..|pg||
nt|panja: so the 3@H bid is a rather risky bid...|pg||
nt|bobholl: the 9 of @D migth have helped too although that didn't matter|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: just in from Liam    3@C is splinter in either minor, either weak or very strong|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: thanks Liam !!!|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess he respects it.  Of course, south has extra defense, enough that north couldn't double even though this is going down several|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|tejjyid: imp-gaining lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panja: N could have passed, made E squirm a little..and taken a penalty if possible...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: the other room is on the final board of the 2nd Quarter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Whibley will claim as soon as Nunn leads     we hope|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with 7 HCP I hate to bid as if I have 0|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although in principle I'm for all conventions, they are time consuming|pg||
nt|bobholl: what good alternative did he have ? :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: easier to do that when you're at the table -- not so easy for us out in the ether|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, true, I was on a slightly different wavelength|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|sybarra2: you missed it we were giving history lessons on Precision,  with CC etc |pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|andyv:  another no substance hand... Ish hoping his pass would attract some action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the specs -- Ish could NOT RDBL to show points   it would show 4+@D  [transfers over 1@C and 1@C-DBL]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: learn more about the hand with PASS|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not often this pair will be in a partscorewith 24|pg||
nt|othered1: Here, south has to take his life in his hands and rebid that suit, just to get his real suit exposed.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  but he could have bid 3N immediately|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and he probably wouldn't want to double to show points|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: Does anyone feel that you can have more success preempting ambiguous openings, like the Precision 1@D, than the big @C opening?  I do, and it applies to other ambiguous openings, ...|pg||
