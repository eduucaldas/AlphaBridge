nt|vugraphzvz: Welcome Sukalyan|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: thx promod|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: promod can u plz give up the letest standings after 9th round |pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: Both pais playing 2/1 based system... EW play transfer responses over 1@C, and 2@D multi|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: NS playing 2/1 based system|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: EW play Art Strong @C|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: good morning all|pg||
nt|figo: I believe NS here play DEMICOMA system , unless they have changed very very recently|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: hi arvind|pg||
nt|figo: hi|pg||
nt|dslee: ajay just wanted to show a lead indicating x :) |pg||
nt|dslee: sandeep and kaustabh needs few more of these to come back|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzvz: Looking forward to an exciting match|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: they topped the Swiss League after 10 rounds|pg||
nt|dslee: with Kista on the other table, it will be difficult to hold that momentum :)|pg||
nt|egezzer: I was commentate before hours so the Empty Vessels started well indeed|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: Poddar had a choice to pick their opp|pg||
nt|subhranp: good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: not sure if 4@H will be an easy make|pg||
nt|dslee: Empty Vessels are sounding a lot - they proved to be the clear superior team in the whole field, anyways, they have in their ranks the likes of Kista, swarnendu, Jm, Sulket and all ...|pg||
nt|dslee: - all of them are Indian champs|pg||
nt|egezzer: Certainly|pg||
nt|dslee: with the @H holding, Ajay should come in with a 2@H overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|vugraphzvz: an easy game to start with|pg||
nt|figo: Hooda team won semis by 2 imps |pg||
mb|3S|nt|subhranp: we are off to a quick start on the second segment|pg||
nt|subhranp: this is the second segment of SF|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzvz: W thinking.. i guess choice between trump lead and @DK|pg||
nt|subhranp: for the specs who have just logged in.. its poddar vs empty vessels and DSM vs Azure|pg||
nt|subhranp: poddar leading empty vessels by 38-30 at the end of first segment|pg||
nt|subhranp: we might miss play on this board due to late start|pg||
nt|dslee: NS plays demicoma and EW plays 2/1 when vul and strong @C when non-vul - NT variation along with the vulnaribility|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: good start for defence i think|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: the young brigade of hooda is playing really well since last year arvind :)|pg||
nt|figo: I am aware :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: dummy will be forced sooner or later after @D shift|pg||
nt|egezzer: Demicoma well-known in India,Deb?|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|dslee: yes, there are a group of players from Bombay and Pune who plays this|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dslee: have not seen that being adopted by players from other parts in India|pg||
nt|egezzer: http://www.demicoma.com/pn764/html/index.php |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|sarkar_suk: 4 @S can make : with cross ruff|pg||

mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|vugraphzvz: 4@S should also make though, as @DQ right|pg||

nt|vugraphzvz: a 1@S opening for most|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: as expected, Poddar Developers managed to bounce back reflecting their magnificient form|pg||
nt|subhranp: this one should be an interesting hand|pg||
nt|figo: E could not have had 2 clubs , mostly |pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzvz: NS may go too high here?|pg||

mb|2C|an|dont|nt|subhranp: Kaustab might get in at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: k.bendre played at bbo as azad hind...& s.thak plays as thak|pg||

mb|4H|nt|subhranp: Some play Pass by East as GF here|pg||
nt|subhranp: sarkar, does hooda play on bbo?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: S choooses to bid hs second suit first|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: EW play strong @C|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes..his id on bbo hooda9gr :)|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: but he play some times..not always lik us..:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: goodevening all...hi rajesh|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: as a kib points out, 6N by S is the best spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: by flat, i dont mean the contract will make.. but same auction and opening lead at least...|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: double dummy NS can make upto 6C..|pg||
nt|dslee: this will be a sure shot 3NT by kista and swar on the other table|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|figo: would N take this 3H as D fit ?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|subhranp: NS likely to take the sac in 5d|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: i find 3@C too timid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|subhranp: yes, they should have reached game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: easy to infer @H length and @D shortage|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: & that would be a very good sacrifice |pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzvz: a good result for DSM this... as 4@C makes|pg||
nt|subhranp: well, they might bid on to slam|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzvz: 3@S goes down only on @D lead|pg||

pc|h9|pg||

nt|sarkar_suk: :)|pg||

nt|dslee: people using it - in India and elsewhere|pg||

nt|dslee: if they are convinced to "why", then losing out wont occur|pg||
nt|panja: true|pg||
nt|panja: but with the statistics in play.....the conviction can shake a bit|pg||
nt|dslee: if we try to mug it, at times we might slip|pg||
nt|panja: and there is the other issue of Laws about conventions...|pg||
nt|panja: especially in US...|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, true, I agree|pg||
nt|panja: what they allow is what they are familiar with...not what is good or what is simple|pg||

mb|1N|nt|vugraphzvz: should get to 6@Ds here|pg||

nt|subhranp: hi sapan|pg||

nt|panja: 12-15 Nt|pg||
nt|dslee: not a 1NT here by bendre? any special significance?|pg||
nt|panja: so...those who try to play it there could get hounded out of playing it just because it is unfamiliar|pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: 6 @D is also makeble for n-s but hw to reach :)|pg||
nt|subhranp: 5h also on for EW|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: thak will transfer to @H and then bid 3@D to show short|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: 6@S is a very poor contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: i prefer 2@D bid here.. which cud be artificial|pg||
nt|subhranp: are they playing demicoma?|pg||
nt|dslee: yes :) it seems for a while systems like Multi, Suction etc were not allowed there|pg||
nt|panja: oh ok, that is a good question|pg||
nt|dslee: I think suction is still banned|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|panja: look at the 2@S raise here..|pg||
nt|panja: it is a demicoma speciality|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: if Prasun had overcalled 2@C as i wd have it might have been interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: 4@H has pretty good chances?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: possible N misunderstood the 2@C...|pg||
nt|subhranp: good 4d bid, now East can consider 5h|pg||
nt|panja: unfortunately, it will give away killing lead.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dslee: can u explain to us a little more panja?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: dont think 4@S can score on trump lead... but tough for E to pass|pg||
nt|toral5: wel done|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzvz: this cud be a costly board.... Azure Hooda back in lead|pg||
nt|panja: they are playing demicoma I guess|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzvz: i dont see NS missing slam on this in OR|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes, no wonder poddar has been doing well in the last one year|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: vessels  picked up another 8  on board 3|pg||
nt|panja: E should lead @HA..find out about W's pref..but even in dark|pg||
nt|panja: clearly, a bad lead..|pg||
nt|panja: it makes the bad bidding look good..|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes agree with you fully|pg||
nt|panja: had he held @Hkxx...there would have been some justification for leading a small @S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzvz: 3rd dble was perhaps bad , unnecessary|pg||
nt|subhranp: sriram suggesting that South could directly bid 4s if he anyway wanted to bid it|pg||
nt|panja: sure...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: this will go for a bundle|pg||
nt|dslee: specs its an honor to have panja here with us talking about his system when 2 of the players are playing that|pg||
nt|panja: the demicoma 2@S raise...is structured around 5-7 HCP, 3-card @S support|pg||
nt|dslee: with 3 I agree - with 2?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzvz: W thinking|pg||
nt|panja: so..it denys 8+ HCP and 3-card support|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|vugraphzvz: as sixspade said, more like telephone number|pg||
nt|panja: that is first thing..with 8+ and 3+ support, go through 1Nt..|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|panja: sorry though....I was thinking S rebid 3@D..now I see he didn't|pg||
nt|panja: next idea..more Spades..less HCP; less Spades, more HCP|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panja: perhaps, they are not playing demicoma then|pg||

nt|subhranp: thanks pramod|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|subhranp: he needs to play spades carefully|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panja: so with 8-9 HCP and 2 Spades, same raise|pg||
nt|panja: it transfer the onus of guessing a fit to opponents|pg||
nt|dslee: thanks so much panja|pg||
nt|panja: note that with a 10-15 HCP opening.....the raise has no chance of missing a constructive goal|pg||
nt|panja: so..unlike 2/1...demicoma raise will more often be passed|pg||
nt|panja: or most often, i shd say|pg||
nt|dslee: ok|pg||
nt|panja: and it could also be 3-4 HCP 4 Spades..especially if you are VUL and opp not, and a Bergen raise is risky|pg||
