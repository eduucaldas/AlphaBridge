nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|cicus: this is match 6, half of which was played yesterday evening|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Baard |pg||
nt|bvdahl: Kippe also won the same championship with Baard Olav Aasan in 2008, I believe|pg||
nt|ady: part score to start|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20    e/w around 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: seems like we have some problems here - the cards you see are not the same as the players actually have|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, that will make things interesting....|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: we are trying to fix it|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate it when that happens :(|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: sorry to say, but there are som serious trouble here. The players have to start playing now, but we still do not hav the right files of cards to the BBO.|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: you can see the result from board no 1 in the bridge movie. 1st board NS bid 5@H after EW fought to the 5-level in @c. Made 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|sybarra: is TD looking for files? |pg||
nt|sybarra: what do they do for hand records? |pg||
nt|vugraphztd: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: It looks like the cards the players play have actually been played before.|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: so the card file you see here is correct, but the boards have been duplicated after an old card file!!|pg||
nt|bvdahl: wow, so no one bothered to double chack....|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: At one table a player said he recognizes the cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Looks like the cards were played the first weekend of Norwegian Premier League in october 2010.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so, they have to start over. Suggest thay take the cards from the last round tomorrow and play them now|pg||
nt|bvdahl: gives them time to make new duplicates for tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like wrong file used to deal the cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Høyland 3 and Midt Trøndelag2  9 so fare: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
mb|1N!|an|8-12|nt|bernix: hi folks|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  3 vs  7 after the first weekend here and the highest placed team with a decent lead at the half|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Gabor and Bård. Here we go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But they only need to be a member of a Norwegian club|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wish I could describe how beautiful the sunrise is here in DC |pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Now we have the right duplicates|pg||
nt|rodal f: A weak NY from S?|pg||
nt|rodal f: *NT|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I am guessing the final contract will be 2@s in North|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi there|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|Walddk4: So the rules must be changed first if they want to bar foreigners|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Bernard.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that an undo?|pg||
mb|d!|nt|bvdahl: I know, but there were still some who didn't like it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so maybe they just took the wrong suitcase :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or maybe they prefer clubs :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8 points?|pg||
nt|bernix: let's check the cc|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Ns play weak 1NT openings in some positions |pg||
nt|yo_yo: now frank, how old are you?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Right u are Roland.|pg||
nt|cicus: gm John|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello John, Gábor and Al|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 52 ish?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: suppose if declarer  gets everything wrong  could go down|pg||
nt|cicus: a somewhat lucky 3NT to begin with|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hehehe:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8 points for 1NT opener, I have never known that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's the range?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk5: and our operator, Kristian|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Welcome|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ok, looks like we can finally get back to watching bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: now we are back, and now with right duplicates at the tables|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see W sitting for 3 nt |pg||
nt|bvdahl: Kippe is probably wuite optimistic about beating this one, but not so much about beating 4@h, so no x|pg||
nt|bvdahl: quite, and please forgive my typos.... :)|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe a stretched 9-11 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: you don't need to break the rules to create controversy ;)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as me in Romania|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)  Prefere to handle the @C color as 6 card. But N didn't give up|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good case to be made for a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|cicus: let's say rather lucky instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: if @c lead here, declearer needs to duck|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Peter.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and now there are no problems on this layout|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Hello Mr. Lund :)|pg||
nt|cicus: N has a strong suit, an entry and still cannot enjoy enough tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Home it seems. Only @C lead to beat it, if I'm not wrong|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @c lead can be ducked|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and you can deny S entry later|pg||
nt|ady: over board on a part score hand     have a chance in 4@H if 2 diamonds are not cashed early|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@C=8-12 and ask|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: hae me doubts|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not so easy to see a reasonable way to get that many things wrong|pg||
nt|ady: after losing a diamond finesse  declarer needs to search for 9th trick    possible to miss guess in hearts and spades to lose 4 more tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: is @D lead easy from N?  I dont think so |pg||
nt|sybarra: may see a @H lead|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @c lead, and I think it gives decl a chance|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|cicus: spec suggested a 3rd hand 1@S opening by S|pg||
nt|bvdahl: nice one|pg||
nt|ady: found it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: certainly has its merits|pg||
nt|rodal f: Updated resultlist: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: i think it poor bridge knowing there are 9 spades missing|pg||
nt|bvdahl: good contract, should make comfortably even if N might feel a little short in trump after a while|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: NS play relay presision. Convention card (in norwegian) here: http://1833.bridge.no/Berg_Kippe.html|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the version of Viking Club they play is different from what was described in Groetheims book|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|ady: no problem now    got over the first hurdle|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bvdahl: just made, ut seems. Good start for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: and W knows the ht K  is off |pg||
nt|bvdahl: and 2 down if he takes @h finesse|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|chick: It must be hard to feel nationalistic pride for a win when some of your players aren't even nationals|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bvdahl: yes, for sure @hK is offside here|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well he's such a fine player we dont mind|pg||
nt|chick: hopefully some day we will get rid of all the nation-oriented structure in the bridge world, and just let the best players compete as people :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure @CA and next.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will come Cornelia, will come:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: W's spades could have been AKQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks lke gadget bid |pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4@s seems to make EW on account of the @cJ being onside|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@S  on slender values    more likely stiop in part score|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 4@s and 3NT makes, but 3 NT is preferable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: additional vugraph tables can be viewed using  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why not play in d game will never be missed on this hand|pg||
nt|bvdahl: might be pushed higher|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: 3NT best    but my play in 4@S    also ok|pg||
nt|cicus: @D game goes down I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: Eide might just bid 4 @S not wanting to bid again over 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: and he did it faster than I could type|pg||

mb|p|nt|bvdahl: good point|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bvdahl: xx shows 3 card @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: once east has opened 2@S   then game more likely to be bid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: 3@H?    anyone know?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3 @h shows singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 3 @c is so weak that pd should not bid 3 NT with 18-19 NT|pg||
nt|cicus: 6 or 7?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: again 3Nt on the normal lead in Major ftom N|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: web camera from OR: http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://bridgefestival.no/refresh.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: practical bid by North|pg||
nt|ady: this may be a swing for Hordaland|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3x h's might score the !Js for south if E invests the @sQ on the 3rd round|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @sJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this should "hunt" as they say |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: god lord|pg||

nt|jcomyn: nevr mind the quality feelthe width bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: convention card EW: http://1833.bridge.no/Helgemo_Helness.html|pg||
nt|bvdahl: it used to show 5431 shape with 3 card major. Not anymore :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3@c makes if he decides to play S for Hx in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: to defeat 3Nt after @h to Q S have to play @CK!|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but the laternative is to play small @c from hand, playing N for Hx|pg||
nt|bvdahl: there could be a minor suit squeeze here if the defenders are not careful|pg||
nt|bernix: i am directing a f2f tounament simultanously and was called to a table. i didnt miss much i reckon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we agree with 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 2nd div A: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div2A|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i feel it's worth more than 2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cicus: good contract, 7 is definitely bad|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but I guess he needs to ruff 2 @h's anyway, so he needs spades 2-2|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that,  the club suit is not friendly|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 2nd div B: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div2B|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good defence here|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 2nd div C: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div2C|pg||
nt|bernix: depends on system & style. if playing aggressive openings and 2@d as moral forcing i agree with 2@s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: yes    good point    this might still go down|pg||
nt|ady: yes   also true|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any problems to get link's when we have Kristian here? TKX Kristian:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: in all respects except 1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cicus: needing a finesse + trumps not 4-0|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but this line accounts for KQx in S, of course|pg||
nt|cicus: small from hand as well|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but presumably play small from hand to play N for Hx, so you will not play @c to T later|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bvdahl: no squeeze, he needs to rff the diamonds|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcomyn: miracle workers Hand H but no this time|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cicus: yes, it makes :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: you need more than just the finesse don't you?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and now there are 10 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: % for @CQ off so how will Kippe handle it. Hook or try to drop the Q?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cicus: true, long @HQ does not help|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bvdahl: now it is game over. Just made and a very good score EW|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: is e not squeezed|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now the bad news  or is it good news|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: spec suggested 6@D has chances     but no chance    throw in wont help   ruff and discard still does not help      needed club finesse for that to work to discard a spade|pg||
nt|bvdahl: In mt opinion, Helgemo was a bit too eager on this bid. Helness could hardly hold better cards, so I understand whu he bid 6  @s|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: Probably West can control the club suit in that scenario|pg||
nt|ady: well done    fortunate contract  spades 2-2  and clubs playing for 1 loser and not able to guess wrong with  jackj of clubs appearing 2nd round|pg||
nt|sybarra: bridge is easy game (NOT)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: cinsiderably easier when you see all the cards like we do :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphztd: board 3 fell on the floor - jumps to bord 4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bernix: should make 3 from here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: a double sq might develop with clubs as the double threat|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s5|nt|cicus: oh no, blacks are badly placed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hmm, I hate to be picky, but isn't West discarding spades after dummy?|pg||
nt|cicus: have corrected myself|pg||
nt|bjacobs: sorry, yes|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bernix: 2 i mean|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bvdahl: with at least 8 red cards and 2 spades with W there will never be any drop of the @cQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: anyway, North is evidently thinking about squeezes as well, in quest for the vital overtrick|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||

nt|bjacobs: actually, 1NT may well be a worse contract than 4@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree completely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: with North's entry gone|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 11 tricks on bidding|pg||
mb|d|nt|bvdahl: looks automatic. S has no other lead, I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: keeps partnership harmony to lead his suit|pg||
nt|bvdahl: If pd is bigger than me, I always lead his suit. If not, I might consider an alternative....|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: lotsa points but no pushover|pg||
nt|ady: this may be tough|pg||

nt|rodal f: Y. But a nice shot at the dark.|pg||
nt|chick: Well, regardless of how it played out, I like the 1@H opening|pg||
nt|bernix: again it pays off to neglect a 4/4 fit with a 7-bagger|pg||
nt|bernix: 7411 is that called a "swan" in america, chick?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it eau de cologne also?|pg||
nt|bernix: yes because 4711 was the ZIP of cologne|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: now this was not the best lead.....|pg||
nt|pelu: if @H back in on @CK u just ruff a @H, take @DQ and discard a @C and hand is high|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bvdahl: not breaking too good here. Natural to play on hearts|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|cicus: @D is not high then|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: anyone agree 1NT here is daft|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "conservative"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you describe it as "daft", you are going to run out of adjectives when something really stupid comes along|pg||
nt|cicus: I  think it is useful to have a bid at least for hearts in an inviting hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: some masochist set this one|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I was talking about a @h back instead of @d j|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: Why that agressive lead from S? If she belive it down a @H often use to be a good lead.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: defence  not so easy either|pg||

nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but espen must have led @D for a reason|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bvdahl: not easy for defense to get to 7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Diamond?|pg||
nt|ady: south diamond pips can produce a 2nd trick|pg||
nt|ady: my money on 7 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w on the horns of|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anything seems to give the 7th trick|pg||
nt|bvdahl: defense cannot set up en extra trick in minor without giving away the 7th trick|pg||

pc|c8|nt|bvdahl: seems that this will be a doube score for Midt Trøndelag|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It does seem strange.  If 2@H is GF (2/1), then you really need 1NT to be forcing|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|cicus: I agree|pg||
nt|bjacobs: to allow invitational hands to be bid out|pg||

nt|jcomyn: must be|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I could live with 1NT passed out in some systems|pg||
nt|bvdahl: quite a normal 1 NT opening with 6@c's, but might make it more difficult to fight over 2 @h's|pg||
nt|bernix: does north shut up over 4@s ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: berg will surely bid 4S , and it cant be a fit jump, (i hope)|pg||

nt|cicus: it take slong card by card |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no but they will|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I think N will accept an invitation|pg||

nt|bernix: well done|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|vugraphztd: some cards dropped out |pg||
pc|dK|nt|bvdahl: with shoret spade in dummy, small @s is probably the best lead|pg||
nt|bvdahl: you will need some help from pd regardless....|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but it worked out. 3 @h's is probably one down|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bvdahl: what do I know.... ;)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The team names are counties|pg||
nt|dburn: was wondering who this Midt-Trondelag was|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I still stand by my statement. If declearer holds KQ98 in spadesm you will have a hard time to raise them regardless|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe but thats a hefty 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Berg was thinking about raising to game|pg||
nt|rodal f: There will be time for a @H swich|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bvdahl: Only 10 tricks in OR...?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bvdahl: the J is right if decl has KQ9|pg||
nt|dburn: true, but he might have bid 3NT with @sKQ9 alone, when a low spade lead would be a pity|pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like a fairly easy 11|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: UPS|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2 x clubs shortens declearer, so he didn't take any spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess you have to think about what you would open with W |pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: be back in a mo folks|pg||
nt|ady: only 10 tricks  because of club lead   and tap in trumps   could not afford spade finesse when in 4@H|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|bvdahl: I would usually open 1 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is not a pattern I open 1 nt |pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, you have a difficult bid on the 2nd round if you open 1 @c|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: no spade lead may well defeat 3NT if defence is sharp later|pg||
nt|rodal f: Lot used in Norway NT opening as this|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bvdahl: so missing the spade position could lead to 3 down, but fortunately for decleared, the odds are in favor of playing S for the Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: why cant I just bid 2 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: or 3 even|pg||
nt|sybarra: if pard can not move,  we are not going any where|pg||
nt|sybarra: just will restate,  just not a pattern I open with 1 nt|pg||
nt|bvdahl: No, I don't agree. Many 9 point hands where pd will pass over 2 @c where 3 NT is cold|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I am sure that 1 NT is best in the long run|pg||
nt|bernix: you're sue you want him to represent your country yo_yo ? :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: Kaplan Rubens Hand Evaluator says North worth 14.75  [doesn't like Q]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: check out http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bvdahl: yes, but it is a matter of what is right most of the time. J is right when decl has exactly KQ9|pg||
nt|bvdahl: while a small spade handles a lot of the other distributions|pg||
nt|dburn: true, but you don't know how many tricks you need from spades - even if declarer has @sKQ98, it may work to lead high if you need only two tricks from the suit, but it won't work ...|pg||
nt|dburn: to lead low|pg||
nt|ady: this may well be a much needed swing for Rogaland|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I agree that on this auction there is a good case for a low spade|pg||

nt|ahollan1: North bid again??|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might be prudent to keep going|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But of course, it would be a phantom|pg||
nt|bvdahl: wow, that is some kind of 3@s opening|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but leads to std contract|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|pelu: can West now jump to 3@s?|pg||
nt|ady: surely would have got to game  if east had passed    west likely open 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: many "old fashioned" players would not with jxxx of hts |pg||
nt|bvdahl: a but unusual by W to not transfer to @h's here|pg||
nt|bernix: seems like they're playing good and bad 2-level preempts|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cicus: I wonder why N found attractive to bid on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It does seem quite undisciplined|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe 4@C has implied willingness?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally 4@C says  "I know what to do if they bid game"   [not YOU]|pg||
nt|cicus: S has a clear X now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "clear" eh?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's wondering about 6@S I reckon|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: flip-flop North's @S & @D and it is clear-cut 6@C        of course that would mean this deck has 15 @S but ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I agree, he cannot possibly know whether diamonds are controlled, and East is likely to lead the suit|pg||
nt|cicus: not only has he 21/" tricks in @Hs, trump ace but @DJxxx may be a nuisance as well|pg||
nt|cicus: 2 1/2|pg||
nt|cicus: and then I do nozt count on a @C trick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too difficult to make a decision other than x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point -- must worry about what to say to Committee|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it's often hard to think straight in this situation ...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's lebensohl by east|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: yes, he should have|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he might have... but he will get another chance|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some help from NS?|pg||
nt|cicus: is this true?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: hence the statement 'std contract' :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: he obviously wanted to play the hand himself..... :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would transfer, my hand is hopeless except in hts|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, South's bid is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|pelu: S = 911|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Hoftaniska gone to the toilet while his pd was thinking. still not back|pg||
nt|cicus: Defence is likely to be @CK overtaken, @HK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or overtaken and a diamond through?|pg||
nt|cicus: unless @S cashes @SA first, not to get endplayed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A heart through would be sad if South has @H10xxx and @DAQxx|pg||
nt|bvdahl: should be fairly easy 8 by tuffing a @c in dummy|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ruffing|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: the difference is that the contract is played from E instead of W|pg||
nt|yo_yo: showing a weak hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: but it might not work out very well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe @CJ lead to entice @H over @D     or is that way too deep|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I think the correct defence is @SA, then @CJ which should be suit-preference for hearts|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|bvdahl: very nice lead|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure declarer can handle this - if he draws trumps, he has too many black-suit losers|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rodal f: It is not unnormal after 1 and 2@H from N|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bvdahl: both E and W had a little extra for their bidding|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: and if he doesn't, he will lose too many club ruffs|pg||
nt|bvdahl: can't avoid @c ruff and then he is automatically down|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|cicus: I this 2@S was a gross underbid|pg||
nt|bvdahl: S's balance let W show that he had a 2.5@s bid on the second round|pg||
nt|cicus: *think|pg||
nt|cicus: E had no option but pass that|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I don't necessarily agree that 2@s was an underbid. E is very strong, but swap his minor suits, and 4@s is not such a great game|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any to ..... it must be N who gave best help, but anyway a good player.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: now he might get 12|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cicus: I think W was a K and the 5th spade stronger than minimum, and he has already denied as much as 8 points|pg||
nt|pelu: now 11|pg||
nt|cicus: but I agree, the game is not great|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bvdahl: sorry, no|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: true also|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|dburn: well, if South had a diamond honour then North would almost surely have the queen of clubs|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I also think that E would raise to 4 on some hands that are weaker than the one he's got now|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bvdahl: difficult hand even without the @c lead|pg||

nt|chick: anyone think the X was the cause of this disaster?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looked normal to me to double|pg||
nt|bernix: sure it was responsible but double is OK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: If declarer had led a heart from hand, West might have put in the queen, which kills the defence ... now there is less problem|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now South must play @HA|pg||
nt|bvdahl: would be a trump squeeze if N had A@c|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: whereas if North had both diamond honours, then South might have the queen of clubs, so this was probably the best line|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcomyn: never saw a NT ruffed yet|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: think quite a few wud at MP|pg||
nt|jbgood: another clone..|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: Personally, I think forcing partner to find a bid then not getting the long @D into the auction isn't very kind to partner.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|jbgood: a kib says: is it against the law in Norway to have 8 cards in the trumphsuit? My answer: No:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Especially when pd has more than a singleton|pg||
nt|sharkey: they have one more @S than they would have defending 2@H....|pg||
nt|jbgood: must admit i would have bid 3 @d - but then i am a coward|pg||
nt|sharkey: wud have had @H defending 2@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: must be exciting to see prd struggle on a 5-1 fit:)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|othered1: The best lesson I can give intermediate students is to make every [sensible] effort to get their long suits into the auction as directly as possible.|pg||
nt|jbgood: but we have seen a few 5-1 spade fits today, not all of them have gone down:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jbgood: N of course has to hope that prd has a 6 card spade suit, but even so 3 @d might not be any worse|pg||

nt|ady: OR    east passed and west opened 2NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: whatever, it worked the same|pg||
nt|sybarra: more part scores|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS had 110 so not that bad with 200|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: although they found and made 3 NT on the first hand in the open room also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strong 1@C  around 16+ HCP|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no chance of going wrong missing 2 aces|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: n/s better in diamonds|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d!|nt|dburn: diamonds, I guess - the defence couldn't set up anything|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N CRASH??    i.e. @C & @H or @D & @S  [same shape]|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is about to be crashed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: gee 4-card majors|pg||
nt|cicus: seemsN does not understand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither do i |pg||
nt|jcomyn: presume forcing pass|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure i like that 2@H bid ....|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS time for possible troubble?|pg||
nt|chick: why not, Kath?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: weak suit and they are vulnerable too|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H 100 by 100 times for me|pg||
nt|bernix: pass looks best but dares-he?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: and bid to 3NT in board 2 also - but here decl played N for Hx in @C after !A to Q|pg||
nt|pelu: @s to Q|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4@s is interesting here. Might be makeable even after 3 x clubs to ruff by defense|pg||
nt|bvdahl: lokos like only 9 tricks in @h EW. Difficult to avoid dropping 4 minor tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Eide give up?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, this is two down, but can N pass...?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: will probably play 1 NT x...|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@s, 4@S or 4@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: interesting agreement, passing over 1NT, I may include it in my system|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can it get out for 3 off?  I doubt it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: e hasnt passed yet|pg||
nt|bernix: coward :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: responding vul on a 5-count  bit brave for me|pg||
nt|bvdahl: the natural @d lead is not very good, unfortunately...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you are brave frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: But 15HP at W. Pass? 1NT a alternative|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do you ever go for 1100?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Not 4-card majors per se, 1@H is 4+. HH play 5443|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but hardly any tricks EW. Looks difficult to avoid -2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Norwegian Standard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, THIS is what I call "daft"|pg||
nt|cicus: trump lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But John, you've already used it up|pg||
nt|bernix: now he regrets his bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: dont worry bill i have a few more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: per 2008 notes   PASS = 6-8 HCP|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In 2011, allowing for inflation, it's 7-9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South taking time out to say a few choice words to partner?|pg||
nt|cicus: we don't know who was at guilt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or might they take 300 insteed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Not best bid Molberg hoped for|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|cicus: I think it will go down, as 2 ruffs at dummy needed and no entry back to hand to draw the 3rd trump|pg||
nt|pelu: easy if ruffed from 3 card @S, but here from XX|pg||
nt|bvdahl: no, N can be squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|bvdahl: if he takes ruffing finesse in @d's|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2 NT is forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: X is lead a spade pard (the way I play it)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cicus: that assumed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, if 1NT showed a minor, it doesn't seem ridiculous.  But 4@C ...|pg||
nt|cicus: but no tragedy with 650 available to EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: probably n thought it was both minors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it could certainly be a system mixup|pg||
nt|bvdahl: undoubtedly asking for spades|pg||
nt|ady: can make this     rise with A@S     run the 6 hearts with king on side and play a diamond|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, looks right|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bvdahl: Need to raise the 5th spade to make 4@d, but entries to actually cash it will be a problem|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 times @H and problems to set up the @S?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: don't need to force with @h's because declearer needs to ruff one to have any chance to make 10|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @cA and a @c works well|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or playing @d|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: even with the good lay in the majors  and good diamond holding   this likely to be down at least 1|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt bet on it|pg||
nt|pelu: @C2 is singleton or Q 6 2, so no danger in playing @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: convention card EW: http://1833.bridge.no/Molberg_Aa.html|pg||
nt|dburn: if North had @cQ62, there would be some danger in playing @cK|pg||
nt|ady: club lead works out better     cant reach the east hand to finesse hearts|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: And it IS a tragedy, because they are in 1100 territory|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Right u are. So -1|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bvdahl: well, if itis Q62, a Q! ruff will set up J@c later|pg||
nt|pelu: or play @C10|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bvdahl: nice|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, it is right, so the x probably gave them the contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I could find club lead from KJ9x |pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphztd: ! NT explained both sides as one Major suit and one minor suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So not a system problem.  Just a ... daft ... bid by North|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: some switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: As predicted B19=|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: and pard X |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it would have been OK even if declarer had the king|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: this is the standings, with the halftime result from match 5 included: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|dburn: although in terms of beating the contract, setting up a pitch on @cJ would probably not be fatal|pg||
nt|bvdahl: without the x, I lead a club every time|pg||
nt|ady: this should be a nice swing for Hordaland   4@H should not make even on a spade lead |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|s4|nt|cicus: that's the best play|pg||
nt|bvdahl: still not obvisou how to make this|pg||
nt|cicus: @C10, I mean|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bvdahl: New world record in skijumping just now... 243 meters...|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s8|nt|ady: defence not so easy after the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Eddie the Eagle?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Johan Remen Evensen|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bvdahl: was just training|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no he manasged just the 23 metres|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H  looks best|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure how many remember Eddie. Was fun|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I do|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but I dont think the place for clowns is the olympics|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|cicus: N helping to take the finesse?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he couldn't play a heart back - he wanted to remove dummy's entry|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s7|nt|bvdahl: can't set up spades since it would promote a trump trick for the defense|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bvdahl: now duck|pg||
nt|dburn: however, he might have done better to play a low diamond, although declarer could have stuck in the nine|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but he could play a @h - Dummy didn't have enough entries to set up the @h's|pg||
nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S now|pg||
nt|bernix: must return trump now|pg||
nt|rodal f: For new specs. Resaultlist http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||

nt|bvdahl: I think a @h nack defeats it|pg||

nt|yo_yo: skjetne,  just a youngster:  http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=22511|pg||
nt|bernix: i reckon it will earn them 6 or 7 imps|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: looks like -2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: good defense and anothe nice result for NS|pg||
nt|bvdahl: souths shift now was irrelevant|pg||
nt|ady: diamond an operator error|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: actually played @d, so no operator error :)|pg||
nt|ady: though still 2 down   so maybe not|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bvdahl: -2 now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bvdahl: @d is best from souths point of view in case Helness has AQ of @h's|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|mc|8|nt|bernix: unless they manage to double 2@h in OR|pg||

nt|ady: e/w playing in luck    have made 2 games on very slender values and good lay of cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztd: *look|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Hordaland also copied the thin @s game on board 5|pg||
nt|rodal f: I understand. EW been lucky.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be interesting |pg||
nt|rodal f: Could have done by play A and a ruff, Not AK. But 3 time @H promote trick EW. As @C also would do|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 6@h has a shot here....|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: but I am guessing they will stop in 4|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: how to get there from here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: NS will probably end up in 2 @s|pg||
mb|3C!|an|8-10 W/!d|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hat that bid with a singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe just being in 4 is fine|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: The opening could be 4414/4405/3415/4315|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not so easy. North didn't like Kxxx opposite pd's short @d|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was a hard man to get some meanings. They came:)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: where now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and W finding it "amusing" |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: trump lead best|pg||
nt|bvdahl: sure|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think 2@s makes|pg||
nt|ady: likely to make in spite of bad trump split|pg||
nt|bvdahl: at least  4 minor tricks from the top, and looks like 4 @s tricks as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: singleton spades is not unusual when responding 1NT to 1@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h and h bidding far too aggresive even looking fo imps|pg||
nt|rodal f: At least a new coffe bord came:)|pg||
nt|cicus: this won't go down|pg||
nt|bvdahl: is there a way to overtricks here?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Board 21 was interesting in the OR.  South did bid 3NT after 3@C-3@S, then when West bid 4@S, North cleverly went on to 4NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT was OK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: wont get them this wasy|pg||
nt|rodal f: CC for NS: http://1833.bridge.no/Berg_Kippe.html|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: frankly, for a bad split all the rest of the cards sit farely well|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good lead for EW|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcomyn: never mind the quality.... |pg||
nt|jcomyn: this maladyis catching|pg||
nt|cicus: was 2@C any invitational hand?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kinda reminds me of monty pythons silly walking school|pg||
nt|cicus: I am told yes, thanks spec|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: convention card says; 2@c "any invitational"|pg||
nt|cicus: then maybe 2@S would have allowed some leeway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well now how do you come to terms with the earlier 1NT compared to this loony 2c|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cicus: I can't see it|pg||
nt|bernix: a  minor suit lead is unlikely to gain against the given auction, so lead your longer major |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|bvdahl: not the best lead now. declearer will be able to ruff 2 @s, at least|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but v hard to lead H from K6|pg||
nt|ady: might have been better to go up with K@D  and play spade from dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 1nt would have been forcing relay|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That was N/S|pg||
nt|cicus: there must be some subtle points we don't know|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no i am talking about the 1nt with a 6-card h suit and 10 hcp|pg||
nt|cicus: and Bill is watching|pg||
nt|bjacobs: right that was N/S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This was E/W|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: I was looing specifically at ak of @H|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2 x @c's now and small @d looks natural|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or just a high @s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: declarer doesnt know who has the long @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he probably does now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: This was just thirst for the vulnerable game, and actually, declarer can get quite close to it|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: very amusing recently when from the same holding against a slam a youing lady led H5 and when asked how she found such a devastating lead said - I play the eeny-meeny-miny- mo ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: system|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: On board 3, where Berg opened 1@H and played 5@H X -2, Grøtheim in OR opened 4@H and played 4@H doubled -1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: well maybe you and I should not guess much (no casinos for us)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bvdahl: I think all ways lead to rome there|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bernix: he knows once he discards a spade|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8@H signal for @S |pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 4@H undoubled, sorry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bvdahl: no endplay or squeezes, so looks like a boring 10|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He has to play the spades for no losers, which is not too likely, but is technically possible|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North had a tough opening lead and went wrong|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: maybe north didnt know after all who had the long @H|pg||
nt|bernix: if he believes east has the long hearts he should have discarded a @d from dummy shouldnt he|pg||
nt|bernix: do i miss a point there ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this may be a 2 way shot, if @S isnt covered, go for @D finesse|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cicus: @S10 i smore likely to be with N if he has 3 spades|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|ady: now get club right  |pg||
nt|ady: may play K@D  and discard a club|pg||
nt|cicus: has declarer a reliable count?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: well, he could just as easily play North for K83 as K103|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bvdahl: but ducking with AKJ in @h was a tad curious|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|sybarra: indeed |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think there is an "right" or "wrong" way to play this spade suit ... he just has to guess|pg||

mb|p|pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: will have to bid it himself|pg||
nt|cicus: W has a 9 count again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2s controls?|pg||
nt|cicus: difference is distribution, controls - also, he is pased hand here|pg||
nt|bernix: they are playing slow up there in norway. my players who started almost simultanously have finished 10 hands already|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8-12 NT again|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 8-12, yes|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|bvdahl: 4@s EW, I would think. Seems that the defense will score two trump tricks and nothing more|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bvdahl: 2@d is relay and GF|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: B6 OR went one down for 12IMP out|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not unnatural to miss this game|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bvdahl: he got some help from his friend :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: helgemo has at least 3 tricks in a spade contract, so probably not the most difficult desicion he has ever made|pg||
nt|cicus: the system at work|pg||

nt|cicus: must be difficult to remember|pg||

pc|h3|nt|sybarra: the tap is going to be in the wrong hand |pg||

nt|sybarra: Moysian fit  (4/3) but not easy to play  |pg||
nt|ady: 26 hcp    but no game should make|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bvdahl: when you see the hands, you are probably happy to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive OR room might end at same contract but IMPs to win here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: that's just a gruesome auction|pg||
nt|cicus: S found the best lead|pg||

nt|rodal f: Interesting if Kippe will drop @SK early enough if @D contract|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cicus: can they block the suit?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bvdahl: isn't it 10 tricks almost regardless how you play?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|bvdahl: no choice in any suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: So they have boards where they don't need to think or no pressure against?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: B7=|pg||
nt|jcomyn: they definitely are away with the fairies here|pg||

nt|vugraphztc: 42 min left|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 7 minutes per board - about right|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|vugraphztc: i think this is either @S OR any GF hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: EW probably havent made any agreements about this position|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3D|an| |nt|othered1: only 2@S by east?  Not very Law-abiding :)|pg||
nt|indianidol: no 2@h by north|pg||
nt|jbgood: a heavy 2 @s - was he not sure how to show a good support hand with all the artificial bids around?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: May not be sure of meaning of 1@S |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharkey: only 4-0 @S break prevents 5@S from making|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: unless you have CLEAR agreements, one should always play a suit to be natural, right?|pg||
nt|othered1: It's pointed out that even without an agreement, west might consider getting his longer suit into the auction, deferring @S until south denies them.  But that may assume there will ...|pg||
nt|othered1: be more auction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztc: N had 4nt up, then retracted it|pg||
nt|sharkey: East still very timid view pd's call Vul|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: playing with screens such actions are allowed|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: here it comes...|pg||
mb|6H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphztc: and E produces the quickest axe ive seen in a while|pg||
nt|sharkey: ouch...|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like the wheels came off here, with north assuming south has a very different hand.|pg||
nt|jbgood: they go to the extremes to entertain us!:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: N barely has an opening hand... - some may not open...|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe for a game-forcinig hand, but the way south has, north expected more than a shapely 9-count with non-solid suits?|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: give S the A of @c and this becomes reasonable. remember he did game force with this hand|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: bid the way south has, rather|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jbgood: kibs claim they would have done better - and they are right|pg||

nt|rodal f: Y:)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|jcomyn: the irish mice at the crossroads are only trotting after this pair|pg||
nt|sybarra: and South knew which major |pg||
nt|bvdahl: could be painful for EW to enter the bidding....|pg||
nt|rodal f: Problems to come?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nor finding this "interesting"|pg||
nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
nt|bernix: the bottom group has 5 teams and i have to play 2 sessions. not an easy movement :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bvdahl: cards lie well for 4@s here|pg||
nt|bernix: actually i only check if they move the boards correctly|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D alerted as?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: B8 3@SE|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Kippe is hoping fot further bidding so that he can x|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: Tor in the tank and a surpising pass|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but 3@c is not so easy to set|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next tank?|pg||
nt|bernix: baby-nt works surprisingly well up to now|pg||
nt|chick: because they have good run-out sequences :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: I could not hear exactly, but think i heard something about invitational w 6@D|pg||
mb|5D|nt|cicus: now well placed as well|pg||
nt|bvdahl: good to get the contract on S's hand as well|pg||
mb|d|nt|bvdahl: 4@d - 4@h next bids?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W back in |pg||
nt|bvdahl: maybe on a @d lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: was 3@D  a transfer or natural?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: a fairly undramatic 4@s here|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 10 on a @h lead. 11 ptherwise|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or getting the @s ruff, of course|pg||
nt|rodal f: for -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: now the problem seem to be to locate which 2 aces are missing|pg||
nt|bernix: but problems locating a 5/4 major fit :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: uh-oh|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and a @h will almost certainly be lead|pg||
nt|dburn: this seems a bit anarchic|pg||
nt|jcomyn: forcing for imps andlosing em instead|pg||
nt|pelu: yasy to bid if S open 1@S - then 4@D (void) by N|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 5@d now will show void, I guess|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and deny @c A|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so S bids 6@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Kippe not helping by bidding 3 @C|pg||
nt|bvdahl: this is likely to score 200|pg||
nt|ady: missed game    again on slender values|pg||
nt|rodal f: tkx Kristian|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so  must be natural then|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: 4@H prommise @C cuebid so at the line|pg||
nt|reisig: Was 2@s everyone's choice?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or this way|pg||
nt|cicus: pleasant lie of cards|pg||
nt|bvdahl: depends on whether or not he showed any values by passing the x|pg||
nt|chick: strange he would not show the major though|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|pelu: over 1@S many play that jump yo 4-level = void, and 3Nt = unknown singleton (splinter)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in Norway, most play jump to the 3 level as showing singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@H - 3@S is unknown splinter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Liked 5@S before any other bids.|pg||
nt|cicus: seems 5@S looked for @C control|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but this system u can combine with 3@c and 3@D as Bergen|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, 5@s makes it difficult to find 7. Give S A@c insted of KJx, then grand is cold|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quality at the @S might|pg||
nt|rodal f: B8 3@SE-1 and 3 IMP|pg||
nt|cicus: what would S have bid with @DA instead of @SA?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn: true, 2@s didn't promise anything, so Helness may have taken the view that if Helgemo could bid 4@s facing nothing, maybe an ace and a king was worth another move|pg||
nt|cicus: why?|pg||
nt|rodal f: W didn't signal any @H wich |pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is too difficult for East to find the void|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d3|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 13 now. 7@s's and 6 @h's|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|rodal f: 4@D a que and 5@S ask quality at the @S. |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|ady: even with K@D more in west hand   slam down on a heart lead    |pg||
nt|dburn: but Helgemo would probably have bid 3@h and then 4@s with a hand opposite which those East cards can make a slam|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: yes he led low @C|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ady: 1nt X would have been interesting    big difference on opening lead    Q@D  down 1  spade lead  defence might make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bernix: did not read partners suit-preference |pg||
pc|s2|nt|bvdahl: But Helgemo probably doesn't have a very distributional hand since he didn't splinter in the way to 4@s|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or bud 3@h as you say|pg||
nt|bvdahl: bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cicus: how does N know they have @C control?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: it was not possile to play there. Kippes pass was forcing|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c7|nt|rodal f: AK at @S is ok for the lift K ain't ok|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sorry yes.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|bvdahl: because N has denied @c control, thus S implies having it with his 4@h's bid|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H cue over 4@D promise @C control|pg||
nt|cicus: N denied?|pg||
nt|sybarra: did pass force 2 @C or was that suit?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but too difficult to lead from K|pg||
mc|10|nt|rodal f: A small talk at the table?|pg||
nt|bernix: trust you partner. he could have returned a middle club if he doesnt mind the shift|pg||

mb|d|mb|2D|nt|jcomyn: me bill? - m y wife says i never learn|pg||
nt|ady: north might have gone to 4@S with 7 card suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: pard did bid "freely" over 3 hts ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: but a known misfit with hts on your left |pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 4@h's seem to have a chance|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but not easy|pg||
nt|bvdahl: trunp lead might be best|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and please excuse my typo's. I write a bit too fast sometimes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: if declearer pulls trumps he has to look for the 10th trick somewhere...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will EW find the "Moisent"? |pg||
nt|bvdahl: they play quite well in @h, and I think W next bid will be 2@h|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: thats being kind a lot of bad ones I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: so probably best to play clubs first|pg||
nt|chick: If W's doubles are penalty, E should double 2@D, because he knows his partner can't|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this a forcing bid?|pg||
nt|bernix: short break for me i have difficult decision to make|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: maybe Skjetne wonders the same|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphztd: 43 minutes left of the time for this round, and still 7 boards to play. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: do i detect a black knot here|pg||
nt|cicus: was 2@S @H's?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: TD Per Nordland have just been at the table to tell the players to play faster|pg||
nt|bvdahl: North could also bid 4@s, of course, and possibly should have|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he bid 2 ht or  2 nt?  which he did while I was typing|pg||
nt|bvdahl: hehe, what du I know|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @d lead and it  makes|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bvdahl: but I still think S had something in reserve|pg||
nt|ady: maybe not costly missing game    west might have taken the sac against 4@S  and lose 200 instead of the 170 as it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: if Kippe x, it will be -2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: if u play@CA and @C from dummy there are odds for play low in S to the bare K|pg||

nt|cicus: I think it is clear that to play in the morning is difficult in Norway as well|pg||
nt|cicus: I am scared at the bidding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me too and then bill will be right|pg||
nt|chick: 4-5 losers and he'll probably try the diamond finesse to pitch one, and even that will fail|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: and lets just claim |pg||

nt|cicus: 6NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: to the stratosphere ... |pg||

nt|rodal f: Or go for the @C ruffs if not a @S lead.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|bvdahl: needed @h shift at some point here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe to the making 5NT|pg||

nt|jcomyn: you were right bill - i am wrong again|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, it's quite humorous really ... and you did seem to be on safe ground|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Even if hearts behaved you would be 1 trick short in 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so maybe Tundal will claim rather fast|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Tundal has shown 14-16 balanced, 6c @C and 5 controls (@C Q is one control)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he doesnt expect the ruff, and who would|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S lead not the most normal one.|pg||
nt|chick: well.... N did pull 2@C to a suit the opps bid, I wouldn't expect him to have too many of them|pg||
nt|rodal f: N told 1 or 3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|pelu: but no ciebids - N jusr took a gamble :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, W opened weak 2, so if you are sure he's got the @cK, then you duck, but you can't be sure. But obvisouly when E play low it is an indication|pg||
nt|pelu: wd S - u follow "my plan" :):)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|s5|nt|bvdahl: cunning @sK from helness. Made it look like his stopper was weak|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well the killer was clear: 4@D took them beyond their "end signal" bid, so 4@H was now a relay|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the error here is West's ... he failed to plan the auction |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Relayers generally use 4@D as an "end signal" - it says, "partner, bid 4@H then pass my next bid"|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Here, West was in control, and the 4@D bid was ruinous to him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because he could now no longer make the bid himself|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems so - I once invited the norwegian team to my room fo a drink during the caransa and they left at 7.0|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: and now for sure @DA not in W|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s4|nt|rodal f: New @S and S pressed to find the @D. No help|pg||

nt|vugraphztd: TD at the table again, North complains EW are playing too slow. TD says there are only time for 5,5 mins per board from now|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|bvdahl: it asks pd to lead dummys first suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit hard. Kippe did at first half. It costed him. @S lead if u remember:)|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|bvdahl: 5@d looks tempting, but seems difficult to get rid if the @h loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   or 1NT around rifght for e/w|pg||
nt|bvdahl: probably 9 tricks in @c|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and that was in 1980 - so they havent changed since then|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 5@d is a good sac. 4@s makes|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D   300|pg||
nt|ady: west has useful values for east|pg||
nt|bjacobs: John, what do you think about this one?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 11 is possible in spades|pg||
nt|dburn: four-card majors, or three and a half card majors in this case|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is an awkward situation for East-West|pg||
nt|bvdahl: if N is psychic, he will lead @dK|pg||
nt|ady: on hand 9   in OR   the leaders lost 10 imps when e/w reached game   strangely in 4@H  rather than the more obvious 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Good lift and 3@S?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cicus: E manufacturing a minus|pg||
nt|bvdahl: nice lead|pg||
nt|ady: should get home   3 hearts 1 spade 1 diamond and 2 clubs on the club hook|pg||
nt|chick: I play that as limit raise or better with 3+ trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we call that an "unassuming cue bid", ugly name|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive the @D to be founded|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: Safe to say: "no problems on this board" ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lets not get into trouble on this one pard|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: on a diamond lead  12 tricks can be made   and should make at least 11|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bvdahl: yes, +90 probably|pg||
nt|bvdahl: don't think it is possibe to raise a spade trick for a @h discard|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: who don't know whether their opponents are in a seven-card fit or a nine-card fit|pg||
nt|bvdahl: passing the x would have been the best action, but very difficult to see that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no thats the last time i say that - i promise|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bvdahl: thnk this is at least 2 down|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, when Larry wrote The Law, he didn't have four-card majors in mind|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: now they have actually started claiming in trick 3 :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bernix: the opposite is an "unhumble cuebid" :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder why J@H|pg||
nt|chick: and when you stand up on your chair and yell it,  it means you really have hearts|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bvdahl: not sure it is right to say he SHOULD make 11 it they cash 2@c's|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|ady: if they find a club lead  defence has a chance|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sorry folks she who has to be obeyed calls|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bvdahl: with the x it should be possible to find the @s's|pg||
nt|pelu: strange lead when West's 2NT was for minor|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: now  will make|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: i think they maybe play 3@H as 3card @S inv+, and 2NT as inv+ w/4+ @S|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks, Kristian :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|dburn: the opponents are supposed to bid like civlised people - open with five, raise with three|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bvdahl: still have to find the @s's|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sounds right.|pg||
nt|bernix: case resolved. player showing "noticeable disappoval for partner's defense"|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|bvdahl: the lead might have given away one trick, but should still be one down|pg||
nt|pelu: the u will find many un-civilised players in SWcandinavia :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bvdahl: Needs 4 entries in dummy, but only has 3|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's the penalt bernard?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: penalty|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was that the best % after opening from S?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|bvdahl: of coure not, sorry|pg||
nt|bvdahl: one heart will go on the T@c|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so he will need to run a spade at some point|pg||
nt|bernix: result stand because no damage arose|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's very difficult not to show disapproval when partner makes a real hash of the defence, i find :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did he get a ticking-off?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bvdahl: W should pitch A@h here|pg||
nt|bvdahl: which will lose to @sK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|pelu: best @HK and wait for the @S-trick|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure this is the real position - I suspect West still has @c10 rather than the three|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, need to play @hk now|pg||
nt|pelu: probh also down on @S-lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: S actually ducked the 3rd @C round -|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|ady: I am sure declarer satisfied|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bvdahl: oops|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bvdahl: the trump squeeze would work if the player with @sK also had 4@h's|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bvdahl: but not this time|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bvdahl: now it's a make|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: how?|pg||
nt|cicus: now makes on a squeeze against S|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, OK|pg||
nt|bvdahl: sorry... I miscounted|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|dburn: squeeze? in what?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: maybe it didn't matter, but if N had stiff c!K or blanked it, there could be down 2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @cK|pg||
nt|rodal f: ?|pg||
mc|8|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: it was a misclick, sorry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dont worry kristian, it's not an easy job you have|pg||
nt|rodal f: We saw but result became correct:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: ruffed with the 10, played @S to Q and ruffed home before drawing trumps :)|pg||

nt|bvdahl: 12 easy tricks|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2@c inv minor now, I suppose|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new NT from E, Shirly:) Or W steel the start|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: what a hand for finessers|pg||
mb|d!|mb|1N|nt|cicus: a well timed  4@S|pg||
nt|bvdahl: there was a case for throwing N in wit ha @s on the last one|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a routine 11 t4ricks for n/s in no trumps|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3@c is probably minimum with extra length in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Berg comments; "it is only the distribution E actually had that makes game impossible".|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you need 100% vision, hearing and concentration for that job|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bvdahl: on the board where EW went -500 in 1 NT, NS bid 3 NT x for -500 and a 14 IMP swing..|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: indeed just my cup of tea|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes. Only the two major aces for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: once more unto the breach...|pg||
nt|cicus: @S has to go down to @H10x doubleton, but first the trump should have been played|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztd: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and good typing skills too|pg||
nt|bernix: do you agree on doubling with south hand?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cicus: S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bvdahl: needs a @d lead to make 3 NT here....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but would they have bid slam?|pg||
nt|cicus: OR in the same contract, I' told|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy stuff  can make fresh pot of coffee|pg||
nt|ady: both minor suits break well   usually happens when not required|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Sr phone. Back|pg||
nt|bvdahl: do you have statistical data to back up that statement, David...? :)|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C may have been a possibility if north had A@S rather than KQ|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think i would  but it's not ideal|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bvdahl: 2@d looks like on down|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 for the defense|pg||
nt|frankaus: i would not class it an error - give the credit to the opp|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: actually E could have made 9 tricks on last board|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and a chance to go wrong in @c|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bvdahl: should be a very quick claim|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: might also make on an end play  after a heart lead if south does not switch to J@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Cornelia Yoder|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||

nt|vugraphztd: i will correct it in the movie|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: now corrected|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|bvdahl: board 10 was 200 NS in OR as well, but they played 5@c x|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: double from South?|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|dburn: Helgemo just bidding out his shape, but it looks as though Helness thought 3@d might have been fourth suit, which is why he didn't just bid 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: no   but is so often seems to work out that suitys break nicely when there is no problem if they dont|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphztd: S was not thinking before passing.|pg||
nt|dburn: South can't double - East is unlimited and North could have a Yarborough|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|ady: double certainly would have avoided this|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: North needs to ensure he can get on lead to play the other minor through|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: but it looks as though Molberg thinks the same way as Helness about the auction - West doesn't have a firm diamond stop|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bvdahl: as others have said, it was possible to make the contract on the @h lead as well, but it doesn't seem likely that declearer would go for tha line|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: terrible result  for  MT  team on board 9|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c3|nt|bvdahl: he will not have any count on the @s's|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 1 @h by Kippe here was probably either natural or arttificial GF|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bernix: i would not. vulnerable with 4333. found partner with 5 spades and still cannot make|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|dburn: what line? even if South didn't win the ace of hearts and return a diamond, how was declarer supposed to make it?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|sybarra: oops missed an ace in OR |pg||
pc|h8|nt|bvdahl: so will probably try a @d to the K|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: HH discussed the auctions - seems like they did not think completly the same about the 3@d bid|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but I am assunimg @h lead and a @h|pg||
nt|bvdahl: of course, if they cash the first 5 tricks it is not easy to make 3 NT|pg||
nt|dburn: even so, he can't make it even if he doesn't just play a diamond - surely South will cover a diamond spot from dummy|pg||

mb|3D|nt|othered1: Nasty position for east|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|othered1: and 4@C is?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztc: leaping michaels, which in this case is non-leaping|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 5@Cand 5 of a major|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice tool to have|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: alerted on both sides|pg||
nt|sharkey: end up in 4@S then?|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: expect you only have 4@s|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|jbgood: leaping (or here non-leaping) michaels tells pr I have the minor and another - major |pg||
mb|5S|nt|sharkey: another non make coming up....|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Maybe not so nice a tool . . . |pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@d was asking for the major - and showing some cards?|pg||

mb|3D|mb|d!|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H   for e/w|pg||

nt|rodal f: Spot and no fight for EW|pg||

pc|h5|nt|bvdahl: not a lot in the playing of this hand...|pg||

pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: end?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Kippe nows pd has 17-19, so the hand is not worth more tan an invite|pg||

nt|bvdahl: and 2 NT is high enough...|pg||
nt|rodal f: No lebensol at there CC?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bvdahl: needs @h shift now ot hold it to 10, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: H-L i @S is that a signal for@h|pg||
nt|dburn: I think a heart might hold it to nine|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i should learn to keep my mouth shut|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a tough hand - I certainly don't blame them for getting to the 5 level |pg||
pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: But what will happen next?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cicus: even deducting @CAK he still has 10 useful points, could have 5 out of 15|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but then i wouldn't earn my 10,000 a year|pg||
nt|cicus: still, slam is not good|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not so straight forward, but if EW cash 3 spades, W will be endplayed after 4 x @h's and exit with @dA and another @d|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|ady: club finesse best shot   as if it happens to lose to doubleton   then another chance of defence being end played|pg||

nt|bernix: i think it will make|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c9|nt|rodal f: But at the line|pg||

nt|bjacobs: No it doesn't - you have two losers if East has all 4 hearts|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: However, maybe running the jack is better, because East might have led @HA from @HAx|pg||
nt|sybarra: but frankly happy to make 2 at the table|pg||
nt|bernix: will make 6 now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: Anyway, a rather fortunate swing there|pg||

nt|bernix: so do i - my partner does not :)|pg||
nt|chick: not me either|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my partner's dont either :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: 11HP and all those middle cards. Always 1@D. This time I'm serious:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand     n/s  might buy it in spades|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: Spot for non?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like 8 tricks NS and 9 EW|pg||
nt|bvdahl: x from W now, is that take out?|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: might be 10 EW, as some specs remind me|pg||
nt|rodal f: Shud there be any reason for that? E balancing.|pg||
nt|cicus: no|pg||
nt|dburn: West perhaps wondering why East didn't open the bidding|pg||
nt|cicus: the reason is this hand|pg||
nt|pelu: your bid: Pass or 3@H?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2 @s is as high as they can make, I think|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have another 9 card major fit with 21 hcp   but only around 8 tricks this time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in spite of the  minus results which occur|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cicus: I'll do the maths later|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may float off 1 or 2|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bvdahl: 8 or 9 in @s's NS I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: maybe not...|pg||
nt|chick: first someone has to bid them|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Aa had a chance to bid 1@s's but decided against it|pg||
nt|dburn: would bid 3@h, but could pass - don't understand double, which I think is penalty|pg||
nt|cicus: a matter of agreement, in the Robson book it is left open, I think|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ady: cant blame south for keeping out of the auction with a poor spade suit  and a singleton of partners suit overcall|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think 9 tricks is most likely here. a bit difficult to do everything you want to do to make 10|pg||
nt|pelu: also penalty for me|pg||
nt|bernix: agree with frank. i would have opened that particular 11-count too|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I wonder if 3 @S bid would have been the "big hand"|pg||
nt|ady: not so lucky this time     but difficult to stop as low as the 2 level|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: seems difficult to make 1 NT as well|pg||
nt|cicus: but I play it as penalty, too|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I just asked the question :) The distrubution was good for a take out...|pg||
nt|rodal f: See 9 now if S duck first @H and or @D returned|pg||
nt|pelu: ok: fast X = penalty - slow X = take out :):)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: still not for me|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|ady: west might play a low club after the diamonds    if so best if north plays Q@C    and clears spades    but not easy to see|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|chick: 9s and 10s don't do enough to make up for lack of everything else|pg||
nt|rodal f: Style. In Norway I belive 90% will open.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: south already parted with 1 spade|pg||
nt|rodal f: If not more.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: now 2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: after the opening, they will not stop|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree |pg||
nt|sybarra: they needed a way to be able to stop in 3 |pg||
nt|bvdahl: and I will always open on that hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what that would be  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5/4 hands  i do open 11 counts|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|chick: sure, distributional hands are different, but this is a 4432|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, could have gotten a @d ruff|pg||

pc|d9|pg||

nt|bernix: no it was 4=3=4=2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Time for a @C. Can come nice endplay if N don't pitch @HK eary enough|pg||

nt|bvdahl: he's there now|pg||

nt|cicus: correction: SuitPlay tells me it's equal|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bvdahl: sure, david|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: it's a very tricky suit ... because if the jack gets covered by the queen, king and ace, you have to decide whether to finesse on the way back|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ady: 11 tricks for e/w in hearts    |pg||
mb|3N!|an|no shortness|nt|Walddk4: Well yes, but it will be exciting on a heart lead|pg||
nt|bvdahl: unless @h lead since @d are 4-0|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: You can still make it|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Finesse @S10|pg||
nt|chick: provided entries aren't knocked out too soon|pg||
nt|ady: not on heart lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's quite a double|pg||
nt|jcomyn: crazy contract in open room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And a daft one here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so likely we will start at top of NEXT hour  |pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3@d shows h's, I would think. E wants to figure out if W holds AK of hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: so we will see bidding similar to other room   |pg||
nt|sybarra: so slightly different |pg||
nt|bvdahl: in the other room, E bid 1@s showing @d's|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: yes... I guess it might ba the best line when you see @d's 4-0|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And that's about the only chance after West doubles 4@H as he did in the open room|pg||
nt|ady: somewhat unlikely|pg||
nt|bvdahl: same auction in the open room|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: vestfold romping away now |pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcomyn: well p did double with his super 3-count|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Honestly, the CR auction makes more sense to me than this one|pg||
nt|cicus: middle @D for 3 tricks there?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now toy are losing it bill this is the closed room|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bvdahl: when I play multi, I like using 3@c showing a maximum weak 2 opening, and then transfer to the suit with minimum|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so 3@d would show @h's and minimum|pg||
nt|ady: next hand last of the session|pg||
nt|ady: this should be quick|pg||
nt|bvdahl: as long as Kippe plays diamonds when he gains the lead with @HA, EW will be held to 11|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 30 mins delayed due to problems with duplicates. Lunch break after next board. 2nd half of round 7 starts 16.00, 65 mins from now.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: play @c in trick 2 is probably best since there are no entries to enjoy @d's even if you can raise them|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bvdahl: souths hand is massive now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Austberg's leap to 6@D was a tad lazy|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 1 down? NS will get 3@d tricks, and not possible to ruff more than max 3@h's|pg||
nt|chick: unlucky lie of hearts, and the @DQ lies badly|pg||
nt|bernix: got to find the @dQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will declerer find @DQ?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bvdahl: so then you will have 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bvdahl: yes, not many losers, really|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bvdahl: that leap was not lazy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It was, but it may be winning|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR 4 @D-tricks|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ruffing finess in @c's is of no help|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: that @C10 only help decl |pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: swingy here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or are we all going daft|pg||
nt|chick: I think no, because even if he gets a count, it's in the short diamond hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: What do you suppose 4@H means?  The suit I need help in?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: found the critical lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think Molberg makes it|pg||
nt|ady: see if he takes your line Roland|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think 4@h's shows slam interest|pg||
nt|bvdahl: kind of last train|pg||
nt|sybarra: some times there are just gliches,   we all have to live with them |pg||
nt|bernix: play club now. he can endplay west|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bvdahl: @c7 will be the entry to take the @h finesse|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bvdahl: bit not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: When East shows out in diamonds it must with the odds to finesse spades, no?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bvdahl: has to play @d niw to avoid 2 down|pg||
nt|bvdahl: otherwise BS can get 4 trump tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: might take a club finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. 100% so missed the sac|pg||
nt|chick: or east|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bvdahl: or @d A, obviously|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chick: a kib is suggesting that it is RKC, another that it is anticontrol :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not enough tricks, David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That only gives him 12|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a club in dummy  and later discard the hearts on spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 4@h was asking for aces, 4@S showed 0 or 3|pg||
nt|ady: more likely to rely on the spade suit  than take an early finesse|pg||
nt|bvdahl: BS - NS|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bernix: not exactly. because a ruffanddiscard is to no avail. still has to guess @dQ|pg||

mb|3H|nt|dburn: ...maybe not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hear hear - well it cerytainly didnt lack excitement|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next match start in 29min. Welcome back all.|pg||
nt|sybarra: lunch time for me,  I will not see you until tomorrow|pg||

nt|rodal f: THX Shirly, nice to comment with u|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: round 8/9 starts 18.25, 30 mins from now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: a quiet end to the day|pg||
nt|ady: e/w did not enter    have 9 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to my co-commentators,  great fun all! |pg||
nt|sybarra: and to our specs,  we love the comments and guidance you provide us|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tkx to all specs - co commentators - Kristian - NBF and BBO including Wald.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: not much else to do than play for spades 3-3 I guess|pg||
nt|cicus: a good set it was, surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the Norwegian Bridge Federation (Inger Hjellemarken)  for putting on this entertainment|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but this could get a bit painful|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: flat|pg||
nt|bvdahl: The weak NT strikes again. Keeps EW from their spades. 3@c has a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|bernix: very enjoyable|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcomyn: the poor minors prefer 5-2 to 5-4 - and in teasms|pg||
nt|bernix: thank you all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bvdahl: at least two down, I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: in another match earlier, we saw the long trump suit ruffing...not good|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: 3@D strikes me as a more honest bid, although it doesn't necessarily get you to game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thanks lads it was fun|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bvdahl: even if EW had found the @d ruff, N could solve the trumps without losers|pg||
nt|sybarra: (thinking here about hts)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: would he not have go down if west had J@S doubleton the way it was played?|pg||
nt|ady: maybe  not     can carry on with spades  untill  west ruffs   then use A@D entry later|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: this looks pretty tough, can't draw trump and also ruff diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: if W ducks this, hard to set up spades also|pg||
nt|rodal f: So start is 0900CET|pg||
nt|bernix: chance to level the match but i can see no way|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: results will hopefully soon be up to date on this link: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe if west doesn duck|pg||
nt|chick: if W wins, he has enough entries to set up spades and get to them|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: time is up, but still 6 of 10 tables are playing - the cards must be difficult this round :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: east understandly decided not to bid over 1NT opposite a passed partner  red against green|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rodal f: Butler u find here: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/butler.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: and kibs as well for such interest|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: remember the 3@H om AX to J 10 9 x x x? in OR West in 3Nt after  2"H - 2@S by S - down 2-3 on a @s-lead - but N - onmn an very weak hand played @c up to AKJ - and 9 tricks -  S not ...|pg||
nt|pelu: happy :(|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cicus: 2@D there must have promised 4 cards - an advantage of NF 1NT :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: this is the final hand of the session  I believe?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: Div2A: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div2A|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bvdahl: a @d now will force N to figure out the club situation|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bvdahl: but if spades are 3-3 or 4-2 with Kx, he might as well pull trumps, so it wasn't the best line by any means|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the next set is due to start in around 15 minutes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Good point from Sveing here. Kippe should have x if he wanted to balance. Normally shows the distribution he's got since you can bid 2@s with 4 card @s in the balancing pos|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Correct|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Cheers all|pg||
