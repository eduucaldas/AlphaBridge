mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk7: Hello John and Mike|pg||

mb|3N|nt|vugraphzyn: Hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: mawnin mikle|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: thats the irish spelling of michael|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: only making game bypASSED|pg||
nt|lestergold: cheeky barrage has done its damage|pg||
nt|rodal f: Good eve all:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Brussels|pg||
nt|rodal f: With Wald nr 4 might a full table:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Conelia and Frank|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and our operator, Frederic|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Cornelia u welcomed lady.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: west had a serious problem too strong for 3@c|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: and as we can see 41s a very sensible contract unfortunately not today|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 9 tricks on top and now a real horror|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 6-0 breaks not the way to spend sunday mornin|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: why did s not double - cant be takeout|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if 3nt not bid no way are bthey bidding 4nt kloen|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: had south passed with his pile of garbage bidding liekly woujld have been 2@d cue by west 2@s by east 3@c by west 3n by East|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: moral of the story......|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: await developments before jumping in|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|lestergold: 9 0f hearts coudl hardly cost|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not want to encourage too many raises with 3 to the J and out|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of the story is that putting a spoke in often works|pg||
nt|lestergold: sometimes backfires also|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why not wait and see what opps do and then clobber bem|pg||
nt|lestergold: because what opps would have done here was ti get to laydown 3N|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine playing in game in the opps weak suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed laydown 4N|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: might prove costly declarer could do with 5 heart tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: playing low on heart lead would work if south held Ten or Jack without the 8 it is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: ie setting up finesse position on next round but that would involve a guess- and north has led a heart in spite of the bid on his left|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence of course may well find it difficult not to give declarer a 9th  trick one way or the other|pg||
nt|lestergold: not obvious but best for defence to take 1d and return it|pg||
nt|lestergold: very tricky hand communcations not great for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jim Patrick|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Hello there|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult for defence too south is worried about entry for the A@c in due course not easy to see that the 7@d is that entry eventually|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: hi jim|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c8|pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yke Smit|pg||
nt|chick: has to keep the entry to lead toward the @SK, but only for overtricks|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cQ|pc|sT|nt|yke:  hi all|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: Hi Yke :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: Hi Yke and welcome|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agreed but it is the opps you want to clobber if possible before 3nt|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s6|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
mc|12|nt|lestergold: and south will be endplayed forced to concede 9th grick in a minor|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|capercliff: looks like 5@c will make|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|murat e: hmm interesting they stayed short of game in closed and let opps play in 4 dias|pg||
nt|murat e: dbl to show other suits|pg||
nt|capercliff: N in the other room bid 3@c over 1@d|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  3@c being intermediate in their system|pg||
nt|capercliff: N is stronger than intermediate|pg||
nt|capercliff: but he is VUL opposite a passed partner, he probably took that into consideration|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|capercliff: the best lead, will ruff and play a small @s to the J?|pg||

nt|jcomyn: is that the curxse of scotland or was that the 9 of something else|pg||
nt|lestergold: Engel refused to be sunject to indignity of endplay!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|lestergold: 9 is of course the curse of something but not scotland hats 9@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: historical reason for that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting and problemating cards|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chick: NS may not have a nice tool to show a weak 5-5 majors, would have worked well here|pg||
mb|d|nt|yke:  thank you|pg||
nt|yke:  dangerous hand, it's easy to get to high|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: someone once wrote battle plans on the 9@d|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that 3@C shows six+ clubs and intermediate values|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: no doubt showing both majors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might this also worked. Not a tool I use|pg||
nt|chick: after the 3@C bid, I can't see searching for a major |pg||
nt|chick: if N had a major plus clubs, might well have made a takeout double|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yep thats it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well cards spitting so n/s will get the plus score they were deqalt|pg||
nt|2hplus4: An attempt to stop 1NT NS?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wich also surpriced me that S tryed for|pg||
mb|4D|nt|chick: Good pass by N ... "partner, you're on your own"|pg||
nt|yke:  right, North has to have some diamonds are together with the clubs there is not much space for majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ns time?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: no matter, E saved them|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: whats 1S?|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||

nt|2hplus4: Why not start with a high heart?|pg||

pc|c3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: relays transfers etc hardly anything means what it says anymore|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Welcome Ruud|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of top players are adopting these methods and ive seen them get good results so as much as my instincts rebel against it there does seem to be some point to it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i know about right siding but why not protect the Ck and those queens|pg||

nt|chick: 5@C could have made on the good lie of the cards, but more than likely EW would have sac'd at 5@D, so not much difference|pg||
nt|chick: 5@DX-2  = a few imps|pg||
nt|yke:  I was in a partnership with steven den donder a few years ago, We played in holland in the "meesterklasse" |pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice card fit EW|pg||
nt|yke:  he is a very creative player with a tendency to overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: bridge is a very young game and new bidding ideas are being tested every day|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: oh dont be so modest|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yke:  I think they are the favorites in this final|pg||
nt|rodal f: So system for EW is?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as Donder and u Yke?|pg||
nt|yke:  I;m not sure|pg||
nt|chick: E probably has a 2-suiter bid available, but would you use it Vul?|pg||
nt|rodal f: We'll find out.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|yke:  ofcourse you would, I think now 2@H means hearts an a minor|pg||
nt|rodal f: vul and nice 11HP now.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|yke:  ah ok, 2NT means hearts + clubs, they play multi defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: That was hard.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|yke:  I'm informed by a specatator that 2NT means a strong two suiter with a minor|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Uttam Gupta|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: it is an interesting discussion tho. Drijver Brink use very advanced bidding and Drijver told me it is their main point why they are doing so well. |pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence can hold this to 2|pg||
nt|boedhy: As the Italians were a couple of years ago and Helgemo Helness or Meckwell in their days|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe not on second thoughts|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4@s inevitable to be bid and always off|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Seems a normal way to a minus score|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and good eve all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: aand now the polish club|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Uttam welcome|pg||
nt|uttam: hi and ty|pg||
nt|uttam: 4s seems normal contract |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Even the nice lie in the @D suit does not help enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 3@H=invit for 4 in @D or @H since a M and a MIN?|pg||
nt|yke:  he could have overcalled 2@H which would be 5 hearts + 4+ minor|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Y. Capp|pg||
nt|yke:  so he was thinking if he could afford to bid 2NT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: switch could have been very costkly if declarer had held Q instead of J!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|boedhy: shouldnt he have played a @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bribnk and Drijver are a very hard pair to play against because they seem to get on the right side of almost every auction |pg||

mb|p|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: its difficult to prepare defences to every crazy system thats thrown at u thats why top teams often employ coaches who are system experts|pg||

nt|lestergold: however caution i.e. un derbidding would be rewarded today|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is a viable opinion, but again it goes back to the main goal of preempting. if we are doing it mainly to get in the opponentss' way, then a wider range is BETTER than a narrow ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: range -- we will get to do it more often, and when they opops play the contract they will have a harder time reading the layout|pg||

nt|uttam: qx aqjxx kxx xxx , bidding will likely go the same way?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: May go for 1  of 2 finesses. Or to discard @C on @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: so worst scenario needing 2 out of 3 finesses i think this was a normal slam to bid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Certainly a slam you want to be in|pg||
nt|uttam: of course all north will bid the slam ,after they hear south open 1h|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u when east ruffs in on the third round of @ds there is still play left in the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer can play on clubs|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I think he'll discard @C and go for cross ruff|pg||

nt|lestergold: well maybe it can be made after all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With K@S falling he may make this|pg||
nt|uttam: depends on trick 1|pg||
nt|yke:  it's generally a good idea not to let your opponents play at the one level in a suit, unless you suspect they have a better fit|pg||

nt|rodal f: Nt feels as a order and a X ure pard give the advice|pg||

nt|chilloncan: as Terence Reese always said, the more narrowly a preempter's hand is defined, the less effective a weapon it is  ("a dull swrod" was his phrase)|pg||
nt|chick: The idea of not let opps play at the 1 level depends a bit on the auction, I think.    1@D P P ?   is not the same situation as   1@D P 1@H P 1@S P P ?|pg||

nt|chick: 2 boards to go, doesn't look hopeful for Begijntje|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|yke:  a boring 4H 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|idc: Welcome everyone to the last round of the English Lady Milne trials|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: no, though they could easily gain a game swing on the last one|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well here lay down 7 as cards lie but is six even a good contract it needs spades breaking and hearts not 4/2 with offside k etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this is not a bad slam and they didnt even try in the open room|pg||
nt|uttam: 3nt no chance on d lead|pg||
nt|yke:  3@S is smolen, GF to make sure the strong hand plays the contract|pg||
nt|yke:  5hearts plus 4spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|boedhy: yes very good pair this As I said before they play in dutch competitions. We have something called topcircuit. And there they are close to making the final 16 which is very good|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a slam which needs cards to behave reasoably kindly as hand falls apart when they don't|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|idc: Results can be found at: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j|pg||

pc|hK|pg||

pc|h7|nt|yke:  4@H is minimum, with a maximum he would have bid 4@C|pg||

nt|chick: Yes, and a great big thank you to our excellent operator, Frederic Delforge :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4S on double-dummy for EW|pg||
nt|chilloncan: bravo Frederic:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyn: Thanks all Last hand see you soon|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|boedhy: so maybe some 5 imps for begijntje but still BOB a very handsome lead. Think they will win it...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|henryb:  3N is a better contract. the clue is that E-W have almost all the quacks|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: Yes, and their auction did give them a chance to reach it|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chilloncan: trump lead would have been best -- and in my view clearly indicated -- but contract still failing|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  quacks, specs, are queens and jacks|pg||
nt|idc: Perhaps East felt there was no way to suggest @c weakness, having had in their system, to open the suit|pg||
