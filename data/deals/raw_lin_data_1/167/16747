nt|roswolf: e/w will remember to fcater for bad breaks in the bidding for the rest of this match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and makeable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wasn´t 4@h from W an overbid - at least for me|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|roswolf: very much so the lure of the vul game again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7@S is obviously best played by South but that is impossible|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  7@s by South is good. By North, not great after a @d lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: 12 tricks onlyu made in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 2@S forcing playing 2/1|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: I like 3@S better than 4@C. What about you, Henry?|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: unlike CR which bid 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well it does consume a lot of bidding space|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|nt|rmb1: what does 4@C show?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but shows the extra potential of the north hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: N will pass now|pg||
nt|henryb:  I prefer 3@s with real spade support. 2@s, I think, can be a mark-time bid with a doubleton spade -- say 2-3-3-5 with no @d stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You are in a game-forcing position, so no need to jump|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|an|1st round control|nt|Walddk2: I mean 3@S by North instead of 4@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm the double has given n/s more room|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i dont really like these defensive doubles|pg||
nt|henryb:  5N looks right to hope S can show @cK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in sweden called Sjöbergs 5nt!|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: a safe stop|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5NT grand slam try. 6@S nothing more to add|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: if S had shown @CK, 7 would be bid|pg||

nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|cicus: this is match 6, half of which was played yesterday evening|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Baard |pg||
nt|bvdahl: Kippe also won the same championship with Baard Olav Aasan in 2008, I believe|pg||
nt|ady: part score to start|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20    e/w around 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: seems like we have some problems here - the cards you see are not the same as the players actually have|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, that will make things interesting....|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: we are trying to fix it|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate it when that happens :(|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: sorry to say, but there are som serious trouble here. The players have to start playing now, but we still do not hav the right files of cards to the BBO.|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: you can see the result from board no 1 in the bridge movie. 1st board NS bid 5@H after EW fought to the 5-level in @c. Made 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|sybarra: is TD looking for files? |pg||
nt|sybarra: what do they do for hand records? |pg||
nt|vugraphztd: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: It looks like the cards the players play have actually been played before.|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: so the card file you see here is correct, but the boards have been duplicated after an old card file!!|pg||
nt|bvdahl: wow, so no one bothered to double chack....|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: At one table a player said he recognizes the cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Looks like the cards were played the first weekend of Norwegian Premier League in october 2010.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so, they have to start over. Suggest thay take the cards from the last round tomorrow and play them now|pg||
nt|bvdahl: gives them time to make new duplicates for tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like wrong file used to deal the cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Høyland 3 and Midt Trøndelag2  9 so fare: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|ady: slam to start|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bernix: hi folks|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl:  3 vs  7 after the first weekend here and the highest placed team with a decent lead at the half|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Gabor and Bård. Here we go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But they only need to be a member of a Norwegian club|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wish I could describe how beautiful the sunrise is here in DC |pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Now we have the right duplicates|pg||
nt|rodal f: A weak NY from S?|pg||
nt|rodal f: *NT|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I am guessing the final contract will be 2@s in North|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi there|pg||
nt|ady: goof 6@S|pg||
nt|ady: hi Frank|pg||
nt|ady: good|pg||
mb|2C!|an|2/1 or 10+ w/ 3!S|nt|Walddk4: So the rules must be changed first if they want to bar foreigners|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Bernard.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that an undo?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Name as might wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: I know, but there were still some who didn't like it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so maybe they just took the wrong suitcase :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or maybe they prefer clubs :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8 points?|pg||
nt|bernix: let's check the cc|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Ns play weak 1NT openings in some positions |pg||
nt|yo_yo: now frank, how old are you?|pg||
nt|roswolf: there was a lot of entertainment yesterday - lets hope for a repeat today|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Right u are Roland.|pg||
nt|cicus: gm John|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello John, Gábor and Al|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 52 ish?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Both playing natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: one moment, will look for CC|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS plays natural with transfers after 1@C opening I believe|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: EW as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: suppose if declarer  gets everything wrong  could go down|pg||
nt|cicus: a somewhat lucky 3NT to begin with|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hehehe:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8 points for 1NT opener, I have never known that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's the range?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S or DBL?|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: at S might wrong|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk5: and our operator, Kristian|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Welcome|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ok, looks like we can finally get back to watching bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: now we are back, and now with right duplicates at the tables|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see W sitting for 3 nt |pg||
nt|bvdahl: Kippe is probably wuite optimistic about beating this one, but not so much about beating 4@h, so no x|pg||
nt|bvdahl: quite, and please forgive my typos.... :)|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe a stretched 9-11 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: you don't need to break the rules to create controversy ;)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as me in Romania|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)  Prefere to handle the @C color as 6 card. But N didn't give up|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good case to be made for a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|cicus: let's say rather lucky instead|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Kristian|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd have doubled then corrected to @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is the 2nd half of the match that started last evening.|pg||
nt|roswolf: west cant really do anything much which was why dbl was possible|pg||
nt|cicus: Iwonder if W expects such a huge hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: if @c lead here, declearer needs to duck|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Peter.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and now there are no problems on this layout|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Hello Mr. Lund :)|pg||
nt|cicus: N has a strong suit, an entry and still cannot enjoy enough tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Home it seems. Only @C lead to beat it, if I'm not wrong|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @c lead can be ducked|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and you can deny S entry later|pg||
nt|ady: over board on a part score hand     have a chance in 4@H if 2 diamonds are not cashed early|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@C=8-12 and ask|pg||
nt|roswolf: no he wont|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Frank:)|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|ady: can make 13 tricks if taking the right view to ruff finesse clubs  and not take diamond finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|jcomyn: hae me doubts|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not so easy to see a reasonable way to get that many things wrong|pg||
nt|ady: after losing a diamond finesse  declarer needs to search for 9th trick    possible to miss guess in hearts and spades to lose 4 more tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: is @D lead easy from N?  I dont think so |pg||
nt|sybarra: may see a @H lead|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @c lead, and I think it gives decl a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: spec suggested a 3rd hand 1@S opening by S|pg||
nt|bvdahl: nice one|pg||
nt|ady: found it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sorry. Tom Høyland:)|pg||
mb|5S|nt|cicus: certainly has its merits|pg||
nt|rodal f: Updated resultlist: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: i think it poor bridge knowing there are 9 spades missing|pg||
nt|bvdahl: good contract, should make comfortably even if N might feel a little short in trump after a while|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: NS play relay presision. Convention card (in norwegian) here: http://1833.bridge.no/Berg_Kippe.html|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but with 3-3 split he has no proble,s|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S  2 controls plus queen of agreed trump suit|pg||
mb|6H!|nt|cicus: it turnes out a good decision as no game is on|pg||
nt|sharkey: I agree with x - 2 NT an option?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interess but 6@S I belive|pg||
nt|frankaus: may be this will get them to the grand|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: CC NS (in norwegian): http://1833.bridge.no/Aalberg_Hoiland.html |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: West is Espen Erichsen who plays for England now|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: yes, I thought of that but with such single stopper better spades would be needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing real strength in a passout position is difficult and should be discussed a lot by serious aspiring partnerships|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztd: convention card (in norwegian) EW: http://1833.bridge.no/Eide_Hoy_Hoy_Hoy.html|pg||

nt|rodal f: Result before last match: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|frankaus: not the best grand but if it makes it will be well received|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bvdahl: 4 top tricks now. Will have to take @c finess to make only one down, but shouldn't bee too difficult on the bidding and after that lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Butler: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/butler.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|ady: grand not so hot  on a diamond lead   entry removed if wanting to set up clubs|pg||
nt|frankaus: agree - poor grand - but have seen worse bid and made|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: some start problems here - the players had the tray 180* wrong when we started, so N became S and E became W|pg||
nt|rodal f: U mean a Roland grand?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: so they will change seats before next board|pg||

nt|Walddk5: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the version of Viking Club they play is different from what was described in Groetheims book|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Must be a strong league with Helness-Helgemo 6th|pg||
nt|frankaus: had a 7% grand come home againts me at a major event |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|ady: no problem now    got over the first hurdle|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bvdahl: just made, ut seems. Good start for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: and W knows the ht K  is off |pg||
nt|bvdahl: and 2 down if he takes @h finesse|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|chick: It must be hard to feel nationalistic pride for a win when some of your players aren't even nationals|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bvdahl: yes, for sure @hK is offside here|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well he's such a fine player we dont mind|pg||
nt|chick: hopefully some day we will get rid of all the nation-oriented structure in the bridge world, and just let the best players compete as people :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure @CA and next.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will come Cornelia, will come:)|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|ralfwil: perhaps I´m alone, but want to support @d before 1nt  from N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|henryb:  no: if you have a trump loser you may be able to cash three spades and play the fourth whild the trump ruffs|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm what's so special about these bids?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|rmb1: May be 3@D shows extras (2NT negative after a reverse) and 3@H is FSF|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 5@d for me. I cannot have better fit|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: i think you're right. the 2nt signoff thingy is called ingberman or something like that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: competently bid|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||

nt|rodal f: Part score NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: W's spades could have been AKQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks lke gadget bid |pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4@s seems to make EW on account of the @cJ being onside|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@S  on slender values    more likely stiop in part score|pg||

nt|roswolf: penalty|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bvdahl: 4@s and 3NT makes, but 3 NT is preferable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: additional vugraph tables can be viewed using  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why not play in d game will never be missed on this hand|pg||
nt|bvdahl: might be pushed higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT best    but my play in 4@S    also ok|pg||
nt|cicus: @D game goes down I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: Eide might just bid 4 @S not wanting to bid again over 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: and he did it faster than I could type|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4@s is not far off|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bvdahl: good point|pg||

mb|p|nt|bvdahl: xx shows 3 card @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: the very next day in such a situation we conceded 1400!:):(|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: once east has opened 2@S   then game more likely to be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3@H?    anyone know?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3 @h shows singleton|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|ady: needs diamonds 2-2 to ruff 2 hearts  after discarding a heart on 4th spade   so if getting to a slam should make|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bvdahl: 3 @c is so weak that pd should not bid 3 NT with 18-19 NT|pg||

nt|vugraphztd: web camera from OR: http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://bridgefestival.no/refresh.htm|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS will end up in a pushy 3 NT here - the Vul game bonus looming|pg||
nt|roswolf: they might bid a low point count 3nt here|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|bjacobs: practical bid by North|pg||
nt|ady: this may be a swing for Hordaland|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3x h's might score the !Js for south if E invests the @sQ on the 3rd round|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @sJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@S = inv values with 4@S?|pg||
nt|roswolf: may well be|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this should "hunt" as they say |pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcomyn: god lord|pg||

nt|vugraphztd: convention card EW: http://1833.bridge.no/Helgemo_Helness.html|pg||
nt|bvdahl: it used to show 5431 shape with 3 card major. Not anymore :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3@c makes if he decides to play S for Hx in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: to defeat 3Nt after @h to Q S have to play @CK!|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but the laternative is to play small @c from hand, playing N for Hx|pg||
nt|bvdahl: there could be a minor suit squeeze here if the defenders are not careful|pg||
nt|bernix: i am directing a f2f tounament simultanously and was called to a table. i didnt miss much i reckon|pg||

nt|frankaus: 2NT F i expect|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: good contract, 7 is definitely bad|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but I guess he needs to ruff 2 @h's anyway, so he needs spades 2-2|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that,  the club suit is not friendly|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 2nd div B: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div2B|pg||

nt|vugraphztd: 2nd div C: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div2C|pg||
nt|bernix: depends on system & style. if playing aggressive openings and 2@d as moral forcing i agree with 2@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: If so shudnt S bid 3 NT or 3 @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: lokks like they did not think the same way about the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|cicus: but a reasonable contract reached|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H probably but they have chickened out -quite tightly|pg||
nt|sharkey: fint om du korrigerer og forklarer :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: rightly i meant|pg||
nt|cicus: in fact this may even be too high on a club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is slight favorite here|pg||
nt|sharkey: a day for "modesty" seems like - based on the first two boards...|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: TD at the table now|pg||
nt|cicus: I bet on a club lead as all others unattractive|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes yesterday enterprise was the theme|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree|pg||
nt|cicus: well, clubs are not attractive either|pg||
nt|cicus: against 2NT you tend to open passive|pg||
nt|roswolf: the rules say west must lead something!|pg||
nt|roswolf: a low heart is ok - 4th highest strikes again|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes    good point    this might still go down|pg||
nt|ady: yes   also true|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Any problems to get link's when we have Kristian here? TKX Kristian:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@S reverce so 2NT system|pg||
nt|ady: dissapointing|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2NT  must be a min|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: hmm that would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: wont lead @H9...|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: looks like S thought 2@S was slam interest, but N explained that 2nt was a bid that do not want to axcept a game try|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: in all respects except 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: the contract has already improved from declarer's point of view|pg||
nt|roswolf: sensible shift|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: TD said that the only right W has is to get right explanation - a correction might be an alternative after ending the board, he said as well|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|cicus: needing a finesse + trumps not 4-0|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bvdahl: but this line accounts for KQx in S, of course|pg||
nt|cicus: small from hand as well|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but presumably play small from hand to play N for Hx, so you will not play @c to T later|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bvdahl: no squeeze, he needs to rff the diamonds|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonde rhow the TD can force N not to pass 2NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: miracle workers Hand H but no this time|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, it makes :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: you need more than just the finesse don't you?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bvdahl: and now there are 10 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: % for @CQ off so how will Kippe handle it. Hook or try to drop the Q?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cicus: true, long @HQ does not help|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bvdahl: now it is game over. Just made and a very good score EW|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is e not squeezed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: now the bad news  or is it good news|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: spec suggested 6@D has chances     but no chance    throw in wont help   ruff and discard still does not help      needed club finesse for that to work to discard a spade|pg||
nt|bvdahl: In mt opinion, Helgemo was a bit too eager on this bid. Helness could hardly hold better cards, so I understand whu he bid 6  @s|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: yes - due to the misunderstanding they have landed in an apparent superior contract|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Probably West can control the club suit in that scenario|pg||
nt|ady: well done    fortunate contract  spades 2-2  and clubs playing for 1 loser and not able to guess wrong with  jackj of clubs appearing 2nd round|pg||
nt|sybarra: bridge is easy game (NOT)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: cinsiderably easier when you see all the cards like we do :)|pg||
nt|cicus: such thing happen|pg||
nt|ady: slam was unlikely to be bid   but tht they would get to game|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: min(or)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphztd: board 3 fell on the floor - jumps to bord 4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: by awarding a corrected score but that doesnt seem to make bridge sense -you are allowed to pass forcing bids if you want to|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - assuming you know the system|pg||
nt|roswolf: life isnt fair|pg||
nt|rodal f: AND by screen its hard to look at any bodylanguage.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Think 2nt show minimum, forces 3@C|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bernix: should make 3 from here|pg||
mc|11|nt|cicus: a double sq might develop with clubs as the double threat|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2NT i expect was 5-7|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: could pass 3@C if long @C|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead actually beats a slam  as cant get back quickly enough to 4th spade to discard a heart|pg||

nt|bvdahl: stopped in 3@s on the other table, so 6 IMP's for Hordaland|pg||
nt|sybarra: my  guess will be flat |pg||
nt|bernix: no fit - no game|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 was right. Not @H but ruff a @C. But, not match:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: pd screwed up again?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: no @CJ is entry to 5.@H - @C back defeat|pg||
nt|ady: 10 easy tricks for e/w 3NT    should be a quick hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Fit EW here at least, but a nice sac NS|pg||
mb|d!|nt|yo_yo: some would open that 3 or 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: true gabor - but i am still convinced that this is just the rub of the green|pg||
nt|ady: this time a partial|pg||
nt|rodal f: No clouds at the sky for Snorre. Agree with him.|pg||
nt|ady: north likely to raise spades|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rodal f: Can it become a mine for EW?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: including me|pg||
nt|bernix: put me in for 3@h|pg||
nt|frankaus: will E?W find their @D fit?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bvdahl: no, @c jack is not an enty because E has Qx so S can deny the entry if he wants|pg||
nt|bvdahl: might make 11 with a spade lead from S|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4 @s again. A bit more fortunate ditribution this time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now south wishes he had opened more @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: heavens to betsy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: pretty timid stuff there|pg||
nt|cicus: that's why I dislike nonforcing NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cicus: anyway, a @H must be ruffed and therre are still 2 clubs to lose|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but the play was @c to Q and K - and here @C back defeat|pg||
nt|bjacobs: actually, 1NT may well be a worse contract than 4@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree completely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: with North's entry gone|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 11 tricks on bidding|pg||
nt|ady: not much on for e/w as they lay    bad diamond split|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bvdahl: looks automatic. S has no other lead, I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: keeps partnership harmony to lead his suit|pg||
nt|bvdahl: If pd is bigger than me, I always lead his suit. If not, I might consider an alternative....|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: lotsa points but no pushover|pg||
nt|ady: this may be tough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems to have done the right thing anyway going 5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. But a nice shot at the dark.|pg||
nt|chick: Well, regardless of how it played out, I like the 1@H opening|pg||
nt|bernix: again it pays off to neglect a 4/4 fit with a 7-bagger|pg||
nt|bernix: 7411 is that called a "swan" in america, chick?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it eau de cologne also?|pg||
nt|bernix: yes because 4711 was the ZIP of cologne|pg||
nt|roswolf: west seems to have bid in rage|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: lucky pd has 5 @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: but has found pard with some useful bits and pieces|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: now this was not the best lead.....|pg||
nt|pelu: if @H back in on @CK u just ruff a @H, take @DQ and discard a @C and hand is high|pg||
nt|frankaus: they found it - now will they  like the outcome|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D fit for.....|pg||
nt|frankaus: Berg may have preferred to play @S|pg||
nt|ady: like defence chances|pg||
nt|rodal f: Top tricks for NS +@D=minimum|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bvdahl: not breaking too good here. Natural to play on hearts|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like the addage leave 3 level for opps is true here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cicus: he expected some values, 1@S was a free bid |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that IS SCARY|pg||
nt|cicus: could have been 4 though|pg||
nt|roswolf: i suppose the @S 8gave the suit some solidity|pg||
nt|cicus: as clubs come in easily and trumps friendly, this will not be tough|pg||
nt|sharkey: Espen Erichsen also plays in the TGR league in London|pg||
nt|sharkey: Also lives in London I believe|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: 200? OK? |pg||

pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: anyone agree 1NT here is daft|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "conservative"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you describe it as "daft", you are going to run out of adjectives when something really stupid comes along|pg||
nt|cicus: I  think it is useful to have a bid at least for hearts in an inviting hand|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: some masochist set this one|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I was talking about a @h back instead of @d j|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup the vul game bonus justifys the bold approach|pg||
nt|frankaus: 200 likely - 100  possible|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: result link|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Vestfold EW leding with 11 before this match|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: Why that agressive lead from S? If she belive it down a @H often use to be a good lead.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: defence  not so easy either|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: it just did bill|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nasty decision for south|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3 off now|pg||
nt|bernix: if he returns a diamond|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but espen must have led @D for a reason|pg||
nt|ady: maybe Berg  does not realise he is on trick?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: while Vest-Agder NS is in 5th position. If they loose much here, and at the same time have bad luck with the results in other matches, they might still end among botton 3, but not ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: likely|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hordaland2 play against Kristian?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bvdahl: not easy for defense to get to 7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Diamond?|pg||
nt|ady: south diamond pips can produce a 2nd trick|pg||
nt|ady: my money on 7 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w on the horns of|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anything seems to give the 7th trick|pg||
nt|bvdahl: defense cannot set up en extra trick in minor without giving away the 7th trick|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @d is probably best now, but then defense will never score @cK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: brain working overtime I think d|pg||

pc|d9|nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed was a teammate of mine in the english trials - very fine player|pg||
nt|cicus: now a @D ruff then @SK should be enough|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib confirms Espen lives in London and married to a lovely English girl and two daughters|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: that would be ducked of course and declarer may be forced to duck @HK later, to retain the entry|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib asks TGR = The Great Rose - a tribute to Irvine Rose - txs Geoff :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: espen and helen won the european open mixed teams a few years ago|pg||
nt|rodal f: Helen? Ain't she a gaselle where Espen got a lucky shot?:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bvdahl: have a friend here who wants to play 6@d on this hand :) I guess he's used to getting favorable leads :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: had 2 other norwegian couples - the Helgemos and the brogelands if i remember correctly|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bvdahl: welcome|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|cicus: alternatively, E may try a spade, and when ducked another one|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: It was the Helness couple and the Brogeland couple|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: that won European mix teams with Erichsen|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 8 now, it seems|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: This is match 5 of 9 in Norwegian Premier League - played first 4, 5 matches in october - and are playing last 4,5 matches this weekwnd|pg||
nt|yo_yo: back to 2 down|pg||
nt|sharkey: Erlend Skjetne is one of the up and coming stars in Norwegian Bridge - barely into his 20s as far as I know|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cicus: I presume their 2@H is game forcing for which N has not the values|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphztd: weekend|pg||
nt|bvdahl: the previous game was probably better than this one, but now it happened to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty memory going! |pg||
pc|hT|nt|bvdahl: seems that this will be a doube score for Midt Trøndelag|pg||
nt|cicus: if S forces dummy he will come to an extra trump trick but that won't set the contract|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It does seem strange.  If 2@H is GF (2/1), then you really need 1NT to be forcing|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|cicus: I agree|pg||
nt|bjacobs: to allow invitational hands to be bid out|pg||
nt|jcomyn: then the only solution ios forcing nt but if n isnt game going i dont know what is|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: or Pass ONLY if 5332 extreme minimum|pg||
nt|yo_yo: possible 8 imps away|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now when B3 is fin: S is to strong for 3@H I feel. Two choices left 1 or 4@H. The pair make there style.|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1  for standings after round 4. Must be a very strong league with these two teams 3rd and 7th respectively|pg||

nt|Walddk4: The team names are counties|pg||
nt|dburn: was wondering who this Midt-Trondelag was|pg||

nt|jcomyn: maybe but thats a hefty 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Berg was thinking about raising to game|pg||

nt|dburn: true, but he might have bid 3NT with @sKQ9 alone, when a low spade lead would be a pity|pg||

nt|rodal f: UPS|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bvdahl: 2 x clubs shortens declearer, so he didn't take any spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess you have to think about what you would open with W |pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcomyn: be back in a mo folks|pg||
nt|ady: only 10 tricks  because of club lead   and tap in trumps   could not afford spade finesse when in 4@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: As we see only 5 tricks in NT|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I would usually open 1 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is not a pattern I open 1 nt |pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, you have a difficult bid on the 2nd round if you open 1 @c|pg||
nt|ady: may have to get diamond right|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: no spade lead may well defeat 3NT if defence is sharp later|pg||
nt|rodal f: Lot used in Norway NT opening as this|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bvdahl: so missing the spade position could lead to 3 down, but fortunately for decleared, the odds are in favor of playing S for the Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: why cant I just bid 2 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: or 3 even|pg||
nt|sybarra: if pard can not move,  we are not going any where|pg||
nt|sybarra: just will restate,  just not a pattern I open with 1 nt|pg||
nt|bvdahl: No, I don't agree. Many 9 point hands where pd will pass over 2 @c where 3 NT is cold|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I am sure that 1 NT is best in the long run|pg||
nt|bernix: you're sue you want him to represent your country yo_yo ? :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: Kaplan Rubens Hand Evaluator says North worth 14.75  [doesn't like Q]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: check out http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but it is a matter of what is right most of the time. J is right when decl has exactly KQ9|pg||
nt|bvdahl: while a small spade handles a lot of the other distributions|pg||
nt|dburn: true, but you don't know how many tricks you need from spades - even if declarer has @sKQ98, it may work to lead high if you need only two tricks from the suit, but it won't work ...|pg||
nt|dburn: to lead low|pg||
nt|ady: this may well be a much needed swing for Rogaland|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I agree that on this auction there is a good case for a low spade|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: maybe but i cant see anyone leading anything but SJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well that was unlike him|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bvdahl: since he can cope with 4-2 distribution in that case|pg||
nt|ady: might get spade wrong when south shows with 4 hearts  though normally best odds is to play south for queen where you can score 4 tricks even on bad split|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so after predicting hthey would not find 6@h's I now predict they will make it :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly off-centre to double rather than bid 2@s with the South cards|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe you should not pass a strong NT with 2 aces and vulnerable at teams|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East is rubbing it in, allowing plenty of overtricks, to make N/S feel bad|pg||
nt|bvdahl: watch me go 0-2|pg||
nt|ady: likely play hiogh diamond from west hand  playing north for an honor|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: making only 4 seems a trick too few (or so)|pg||
nt|ady: OR  auction   1@H    2@H    4@H    seems they play sing raise in majors constructive|pg||

nt|ady: defence has a problem not to give 7th trick|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bvdahl: your most likely game is 3 NT, and opening 1 NT will bring you closer to that. Also has some pre emptive valu against opponents major suits|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Else u get to many problems to show ure hand|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|sharkey: *Vestfold|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 4! s makes EW if they can get there|pg||

nt|bjacobs: or 3NT?|pg||
nt|cicus: I know I wiould bid 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 4@S along the way?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you want a safe game, then it's 3NT|pg||
nt|cicus: 3NT even better|pg||
nt|cicus: but I know they won't let it play|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be entertaining|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cicus: Charlsen wants to play 5@C doubled|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West could stymie him though ... that's no longer an automatic 4@S bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hmm i dont understand their evaluations at all|pg||
nt|ady: easy 3NT for n/s|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2 was a real tight 5 level contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 4@s|pg||
nt|cicus: thin game here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trøndelag is a section of Norway about 1/3 of the way up - some of the local dialects there are very hard to understand for us "outsiders"|pg||
nt|roswolf: A REAL MAN'S BID|pg||
mb|2N|an|20-21|nt|rodal f: X from W and + come for NS?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|rodal f: X=3@S|pg||
nt|dburn: West will have to do something positive now|pg||
nt|cicus: now that's a surprise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North bid again??|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might be prudent to keep going|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But of course, it would be a phantom|pg||
nt|bvdahl: wow, that is some kind of 3@s opening|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but leads to std contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some frown on weak 2 with two Aces...|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now who has the better judgment or luck!?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: They play constructive 2-openings in major, something like 8-11|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think W will sac view the Vul game bonus|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|roswolf: west may just axe|pg||
nt|cicus: axe but regret it|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: can West now jump to 3@s?|pg||
nt|ady: surely would have got to game  if east had passed    west likely open 2NT|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: many "old fashioned" players would not with jxxx of hts |pg||
nt|bvdahl: a but unusual by W to not transfer to @h's here|pg||
nt|bernix: seems like they're playing good and bad 2-level preempts|pg||
nt|roswolf: he might be thinking if insurance|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I wonder why N found attractive to bid on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It does seem quite undisciplined|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe 4@C has implied willingness?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally 4@C says  "I know what to do if they bid game"   [not YOU]|pg||
nt|cicus: S has a clear X now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "clear" eh?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's wondering about 6@S I reckon|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: flip-flop North's @S & @D and it is clear-cut 6@C        of course that would mean this deck has 15 @S but ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I agree, he cannot possibly know whether diamonds are controlled, and East is likely to lead the suit|pg||
nt|cicus: not only has he 21/" tricks in @Hs, trump ace but @DJxxx may be a nuisance as well|pg||
nt|cicus: 2 1/2|pg||
nt|cicus: and then I do nozt count on a @C trick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too difficult to make a decision other than x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point -- must worry about what to say to Committee|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it's often hard to think straight in this situation ...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's lebensohl by east|pg||
nt|roswolf: of|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cicus: yes, he should have|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he might have... but he will get another chance|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some help from NS?|pg||
nt|cicus: is this true?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: hence the statement 'std contract' :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: he obviously wanted to play the hand himself..... :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would transfer, my hand is hopeless except in hts|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, South's bid is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|pelu: S = 911|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Hoftaniska gone to the toilet while his pd was thinking. still not back|pg||
nt|cicus: Defence is likely to be @CK overtaken, @HK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or overtaken and a diamond through?|pg||
nt|cicus: unless @S cashes @SA first, not to get endplayed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A heart through would be sad if South has @H10xxx and @DAQxx|pg||
nt|bvdahl: should be fairly easy 8 by tuffing a @c in dummy|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ruffing|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: the difference is that the contract is played from E instead of W|pg||
nt|yo_yo: showing a weak hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but it might not work out very well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe @CJ lead to entice @H over @D     or is that way too deep|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I think the correct defence is @SA, then @CJ which should be suit-preference for hearts|pg||
pc|d4|nt|frankaus: this will not troble declarer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Vestfold have won this turney once. Nice to see them fight for the pokal again:) 3 persons still at the team.|pg||
nt|frankaus: *trouble|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bvdahl: very nice lead|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure declarer can handle this - if he draws trumps, he has too many black-suit losers|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, sure of that @SA?|pg||
nt|cicus: of course someone has to stop sacrificing|pg||
nt|sharkey: who's sacrificing?|pg||
nt|cicus: S thinks now N is void of @Ds|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D looks a daft bid but is LAWFUL and in practice might have saved a bushel of imps|pg||
nt|cicus: and a @D lead will give the contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: It is not unnormal after 1 and 2@H from N|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bvdahl: both E and W had a little extra for their bidding|pg||
nt|ady: surprised at 3@C   tht south might have transfered to spades 2nd round|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: and if he doesn't, he will lose too many club ruffs|pg||
nt|bvdahl: can't avoid @c ruff and then he is automatically down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: look, the most expensive doubles I have seen recently|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: I this 2@S was a gross underbid|pg||
nt|bvdahl: S's balance let W show that he had a 2.5@s bid on the second round|pg||
nt|cicus: *think|pg||
nt|cicus: E had no option but pass that|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I don't necessarily agree that 2@s was an underbid. E is very strong, but swap his minor suits, and 4@s is not such a great game|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any to ..... it must be N who gave best help, but anyway a good player.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: now he might get 12|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|cicus: I think W was a K and the 5th spade stronger than minimum, and he has already denied as much as 8 points|pg||
nt|pelu: now 11|pg||
nt|cicus: but I agree, the game is not great|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bvdahl: sorry, no|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: true also|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bvdahl: I'm just saying that 2@s is not a gross underbid :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: still 11|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pelu: back to 10|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcomyn: so perhaspsd 3nt better  that auld 4-4 thing again|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bvdahl: with that øead, no ruff is needed of vourse|pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks best|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bernix: good switch|pg||
nt|bernix: 2 or 3 down?|pg||
nt|sharkey: hmmm...|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d5|nt|dburn: well, if South had a diamond honour then North would almost surely have the queen of clubs|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I also think that E would raise to 4 on some hands that are weaker than the one he's got now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bvdahl: difficult hand even without the @c lead|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bvdahl: sorry for the typos, got a very sticky keyboard|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: They are getting into a mess|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: north must fly @HK now|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: so the gap narrows...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|bernix: 3 down |pg||
nt|chick: anyone think the X was the cause of this disaster?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looked normal to me to double|pg||
nt|bernix: sure it was responsible but double is OK|pg||
nt|frankaus: little point as has prb show 5+ @S positive|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If declarer had led a heart from hand, West might have put in the queen, which kills the defence ... now there is less problem|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now South must play @HA|pg||
nt|bvdahl: would be a trump squeeze if N had A@c|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: whereas if North had both diamond honours, then South might have the queen of clubs, so this was probably the best line|pg||
nt|ady: 22 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcomyn: never saw a NT ruffed yet|pg||
nt|ady: likely flat result       3NT more diffult to defend|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    forgot 2@S response|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: just as good|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bvdahl: ok, but take away E minor jacks. He will probably still bid 4 and that contract is not good|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: fairly easy, as long as he counts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but fewer style points|pg||

nt|sybarra: does Eide give up?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, this is two down, but can N pass...?|pg||
nt|roswolf: Napoleon always believed in luck - better to be lucky than good and when you are good AND lucky.............|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT with the obligatory 5-card major|pg||
nt|sharkey: this shud set up declarer's long suit...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have not seen but here u are: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|frankaus: thos may be passsed out|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bvdahl: will probably play 1 NT x...|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@s, 4@S or 4@D?|pg||
mb|d!|nt|cicus: interesting agreement, passing over 1NT, I may include it in my system|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can it get out for 3 off?  I doubt it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: e hasnt passed yet|pg||
nt|bernix: coward :)|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds breaking badly again|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: responding vul on a 5-count  bit brave for me|pg||
nt|bvdahl: the natural @d lead is not very good, unfortunately...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you are brave frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: But 15HP at W. Pass? 1NT a alternative|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do you ever go for 1100?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here we go|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk4: Not 4-card majors per se, 1@H is 4+. HH play 5443|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but hardly any tricks EW. Looks difficult to avoid -2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Norwegian Standard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, THIS is what I call "daft"|pg||
nt|cicus: trump lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But John, you've already used it up|pg||
nt|bernix: now he regrets his bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: dont worry bill i have a few more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: per 2008 notes   PASS = 6-8 HCP|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In 2011, allowing for inflation, it's 7-9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South taking time out to say a few choice words to partner?|pg||
nt|cicus: we don't know who was at guilt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or might they take 300 insteed|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Not best bid Molberg hoped for|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I think it will go down, as 2 ruffs at dummy needed and no entry back to hand to draw the 3rd trump|pg||
nt|pelu: easy if ruffed from 3 card @S, but here from XX|pg||
nt|bvdahl: no, N can be squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|bvdahl: if he takes ruffing finesse in @d's|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2 NT is forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: X is lead a spade pard (the way I play it)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Butler: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/butler.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|sharkey: Espen has to switch to something....|pg||
nt|cicus: well, he might just as well continue @Hs, they are soon high anyway|pg||
nt|frankaus: now in deep brown stuff|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cicus: that assumed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, if 1NT showed a minor, it doesn't seem ridiculous.  But 4@C ...|pg||
nt|cicus: but no tragedy with 650 available to EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: probably n thought it was both minors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it could certainly be a system mixup|pg||
nt|bvdahl: undoubtedly asking for spades|pg||
nt|ady: can make this     rise with A@S     run the 6 hearts with king on side and play a diamond|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, looks right|pg||
nt|frankaus: again 3 level gets u into trouble|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bvdahl: Need to raise the 5th spade to make 4@d, but entries to actually cash it will be a problem|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 times @H and problems to set up the @S?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: don't need to force with @h's because declearer needs to ruff one to have any chance to make 10|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @cA and a @c works well|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or playing @d|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: even with the good lay in the majors  and good diamond holding   this likely to be down at least 1|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt bet on it|pg||
nt|pelu: @C2 is singleton or Q 6 2, so no danger in playing @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: convention card EW: http://1833.bridge.no/Molberg_Aa.html|pg||
nt|dburn: if North had @cQ62, there would be some danger in playing @cK|pg||
nt|ady: club lead works out better     cant reach the east hand to finesse hearts|pg||
nt|ady: North action reasonable|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: And it IS a tragedy, because they are in 1100 territory|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Right u are. So -1|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bvdahl: well, if itis Q62, a Q! ruff will set up J@c later|pg||
nt|pelu: or play @C10|pg||
nt|rodal f: Small?|pg||
nt|sharkey: S doesn't know that|pg||
nt|sharkey: that @Hs are coming in|pg||
nt|cicus: S knows @Hs are either A82 behind him or the 8 is now single|pg||
nt|cicus: he can lead the J without risk|pg||
nt|cicus: he has the precious 3|pg||
nt|rodal f: How Gabor?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bvdahl: nice|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, it is right, so the x probably gave them the contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I could find club lead from KJ9x |pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphztd: ! NT explained both sides as one Major suit and one minor suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So not a system problem.  Just a ... daft ... bid by North|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcomyn: some switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: As predicted B19=|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: and pard X |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it would have been OK even if declarer had the king|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: this is the standings, with the halftime result from match 5 included: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|dburn: although in terms of beating the contract, setting up a pitch on @cJ would probably not be fatal|pg||
nt|bvdahl: without the x, I lead a club every time|pg||
nt|ady: this should be a nice swing for Hordaland   4@H should not make even on a spade lead |pg||
nt|cicus: he is sure to develop a @H trick if he leads one|pg||
nt|sharkey: he listened to Gabor..|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|cicus: that's the best play|pg||
nt|bvdahl: still not obvisou how to make this|pg||
nt|cicus: @C10, I mean|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bvdahl: New world record in skijumping just now... 243 meters...|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|ady: defence not so easy after the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Eddie the Eagle?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Johan Remen Evensen|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bvdahl: was just training|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no he manasged just the 23 metres|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H  looks best|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure how many remember Eddie. Was fun|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I do|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but I dont think the place for clowns is the olympics|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h3|nt|sharkey: agree - no other attractive alternative anyway|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cicus: N helping to take the finesse?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he couldn't play a heart back - he wanted to remove dummy's entry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y, but some signals. Still when we comment u always say how or why if anything is 100%|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Tøndel just claimed - said he assumed they wold not nitch their @S stopper|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still I exspected N to fight as he did, and will do same later. 2 times champ pair, 1 time champteam if I remeber right. Correct me specs if wrong.|pg||
nt|ady: will try for some sort of cross ruff now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|bvdahl: can't set up spades since it would promote a trump trick for the defense|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bvdahl: now duck|pg||
nt|dburn: however, he might have done better to play a low diamond, although declarer could have stuck in the nine|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but he could play a @h - Dummy didn't have enough entries to set up the @h's|pg||
nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S now|pg||

nt|ady: could have escaped for down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztd: *look|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Hordaland also copied the thin @s game on board 5|pg||
nt|rodal f: I understand. EW been lucky.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be interesting |pg||
nt|rodal f: Could have done by play A and a ruff, Not AK. But 3 time @H promote trick EW. As @C also would do|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 6@h has a shot here....|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: but I am guessing they will stop in 4|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: how to get there from here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: NS will probably end up in 2 @s|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|d|nt|jcomyn: hat that bid with a singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe just being in 4 is fine|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: The opening could be 4414/4405/3415/4315|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not so easy. North didn't like Kxxx opposite pd's short @d|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was a hard man to get some meanings. They came:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: LOL|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: where now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and W finding it "amusing" |pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: trump lead best|pg||
nt|bvdahl: sure|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think 2@s makes|pg||
nt|ady: likely to make in spite of bad trump split|pg||
nt|bvdahl: at least  4 minor tricks from the top, and looks like 4 @s tricks as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: singleton spades is not unusual when responding 1NT to 1@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h and h bidding far too aggresive even looking fo imps|pg||
nt|rodal f: At least a new coffe bord came:)|pg||
nt|cicus: this won't go down|pg||
nt|bvdahl: is there a way to overtricks here?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Board 21 was interesting in the OR.  South did bid 3NT after 3@C-3@S, then when West bid 4@S, North cleverly went on to 4NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT was OK|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|jcomyn: wont get them this wasy|pg||
nt|rodal f: CC for NS: http://1833.bridge.no/Berg_Kippe.html|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a better reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: frankly, for a bad split all the rest of the cards sit farely well|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good lead for EW|pg||
nt|sharkey: My kind of bidding|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: never mind the quality.... |pg||
nt|jcomyn: this maladyis catching|pg||
nt|cicus: was 2@C any invitational hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: kinda reminds me of monty pythons silly walking school|pg||
nt|cicus: I am told yes, thanks spec|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: convention card says; 2@c "any invitational"|pg||
nt|cicus: then maybe 2@S would have allowed some leeway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well now how do you come to terms with the earlier 1NT compared to this loony 2c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Got some help to|pg||
nt|roswolf: simple but effective?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I can't see it|pg||
nt|bernix: a  minor suit lead is unlikely to gain against the given auction, so lead your longer major |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: club pips poor for lead directing double    10@C lead will certainly be ok for declarer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Border crossed?|pg||
nt|frankaus: dummys @C pips will be a releif to declarer|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bvdahl: not the best lead now. declearer will be able to ruff 2 @s, at least|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but v hard to lead H from K6|pg||
nt|ady: might have been better to go up with K@D  and play spade from dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 1nt would have been forcing relay|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That was N/S|pg||
nt|cicus: there must be some subtle points we don't know|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no i am talking about the 1nt with a 6-card h suit and 10 hcp|pg||
nt|cicus: and Bill is watching|pg||
nt|bjacobs: right that was N/S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This was E/W|pg||
nt|rodal f: Unlucky @C layout.|pg||
nt|frankaus: depends if ur defending or declaring :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or?|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead would have been more of worry |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|frankaus: can swich to @S |pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree David, but....|pg||
nt|ady: if west switches to a spade  will need to duck twice|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: Makes with the right view in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont fancy that somehow|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: maybe they are afraid of not get enough time, but it should not be problematic - the clock says 1:14 left of this round, and 9 boards left to be played|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was looing specifically at ak of @H|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2 x @c's now and small @d looks natural|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or just a high @s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: declarer doesnt know who has the long @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he probably does now|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to do tho|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: This was just thirst for the vulnerable game, and actually, declarer can get quite close to it|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|jcomyn: very amusing recently when from the same holding against a slam a youing lady led H5 and when asked how she found such a devastating lead said - I play the eeny-meeny-miny- mo ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: system|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: On board 3, where Berg opened 1@H and played 5@H X -2, Grøtheim in OR opened 4@H and played 4@H doubled -1|pg||
nt|frankaus: wd|pg||
nt|ady: high spade from west better|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: well maybe you and I should not guess much (no casinos for us)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bvdahl: I think all ways lead to rome there|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bernix: he knows once he discards a spade|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8@H signal for @S |pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 4@H undoubled, sorry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: And then 2@S+2@C for?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bvdahl: no endplay or squeezes, so looks like a boring 10|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He has to play the spades for no losers, which is not too likely, but is technically possible|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North had a tough opening lead and went wrong|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe north didnt know after all who had the long @H|pg||
nt|bernix: if he believes east has the long hearts he should have discarded a @d from dummy shouldnt he|pg||
nt|bernix: do i miss a point there ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this may be a 2 way shot, if @S isnt covered, go for @D finesse|pg||
nt|frankaus: dec now home|pg||

pc|h6|nt|sharkey: time flies in Trøndelag...|pg||

nt|rodal f: Still N can't see Q@D single so brain working.|pg||

nt|ady: may play K@D  and discard a club|pg||
nt|cicus: has declarer a reliable count?|pg||

nt|rodal f: brb|pg||

nt|rodal f: We see all 52:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: how to bid the east hand|pg||

nt|cicus: W has a 9 count again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2s controls?|pg||
nt|cicus: difference is distribution, controls - also, he is pased hand here|pg||
nt|bernix: they are playing slow up there in norway. my players who started almost simultanously have finished 10 hands already|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8-12 NT again|pg||

mb|p|mb|5S|nt|bvdahl: 4@s EW, I would think. Seems that the defense will score two trump tricks and nothing more|pg||
nt|sharkey: The void in pd's suit is usually not an asset....|pg||
nt|roswolf: very sensible sequence by e/w|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: a position for good/bad|pg||
nt|sharkey: Would they bid likewise Vul?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: doubt it|pg||
nt|rodal f: And hart tell u a lot after pards @H opening. That suit for E|pg||
nt|roswolf: the red mist would descend|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are @C better than @S? Tom u run away from the ladies.|pg||
nt|frankaus: tricky  position for Aalberg|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 2@d is relay and GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B6 OR went one down for 12IMP out|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not unnatural to miss this game|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bvdahl: he got some help from his friend :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: helgemo has at least 3 tricks in a spade contract, so probably not the most difficult desicion he has ever made|pg||
nt|cicus: the system at work|pg||
nt|bjacobs: daft, daft, daft|pg||
nt|cicus: must be difficult to remember|pg||
nt|sharkey: On Bd 21 5@H EW thus 13 IMPs to M-T I think|pg||
nt|cicus: may start on crossruff lines|pg||
nt|rodal f: A poss to dicuss at there CC|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|sybarra: the tap is going to be in the wrong hand |pg||
nt|ady: needs to lead a spade    even with hearts 3-3   in trouble|pg||
nt|sybarra: Moysian fit  (4/3) but not easy to play  |pg||
nt|ady: 26 hcp    but no game should make|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: when you see the hands, you are probably happy to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive OR room might end at same contract but IMPs to win here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: that's just a gruesome auction|pg||
nt|cicus: S found the best lead|pg||

nt|rodal f: Interesting if Kippe will drop @SK early enough if @D contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a choice of plausible lines|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cicus: can they block the suit?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bvdahl: isn't it 10 tricks almost regardless how you play?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bvdahl: no choice in any suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: So they have boards where they don't need to think or no pressure against?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: B7=|pg||

nt|ady: not yet|pg||

pc|s6|pc|c2|nt|bvdahl: spade now probably holds it to 10|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cicus: another @D, discarding the remaining spade|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||

nt|rodal f: 1st hard one|pg||
nt|rodal f: *hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: it has given an unnecessary problem to his pard|pg||
nt|cicus: it may have saved the opps from playing a hopeless game|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jcomyn: the irish mice at the crossroads are only trotting after this pair|pg||

nt|rodal f: Problems to come?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nor finding this "interesting"|pg||

nt|bernix: the bottom group has 5 teams and i have to play 2 sessions. not an easy movement :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: cards lie well for 4@s here|pg||
nt|bernix: actually i only check if they move the boards correctly|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D alerted as?|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Tor in the tank and a surpising pass|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but 3@c is not so easy to set|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next tank?|pg||
nt|bernix: baby-nt works surprisingly well up to now|pg||
nt|chick: because they have good run-out sequences :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: I could not hear exactly, but think i heard something about invitational w 6@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass especially if he has seen his pards preempts before|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cicus: now well placed as well|pg||
nt|bvdahl: good to get the contract on S's hand as well|pg||
nt|cicus: rara case whenyou play 5level on15 HCP and not doubled|pg||
nt|cicus: *rare|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bvdahl: 4@d - 4@h next bids?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W back in |pg||
nt|bvdahl: maybe on a @d lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: was 3@D  a transfer or natural?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bvdahl: a fairly undramatic 4@s here|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 10 on a @h lead. 11 ptherwise|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or getting the @s ruff, of course|pg||
nt|rodal f: for -2|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cicus: now the problem seem to be to locate which 2 aces are missing|pg||
nt|bernix: but problems locating a 5/4 major fit :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Skjetne had all quacks and wudnt enter the fray|pg||
nt|roswolf: is this a triumph or a disaster for n/s|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes....|pg||
nt|sharkey: on a good day it wud make|pg||
nt|roswolf: and on this Sunday perhaps not|pg||
nt|cicus: on a club continuation EW will promote themdsleves  a trump trick|pg||
nt|ady: found killing lead  if they cash out which is likely|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bvdahl: uh-oh|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and a @h will almost certainly be lead|pg||
nt|dburn: this seems a bit anarchic|pg||
nt|jcomyn: forcing for imps andlosing em instead|pg||
nt|pelu: yasy to bid if S open 1@S - then 4@D (void) by N|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 5@d now will show void, I guess|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and deny @c A|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so S bids 6@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Kippe not helping by bidding 3 @C|pg||
nt|bvdahl: this is likely to score 200|pg||
nt|ady: missed game    again on slender values|pg||
nt|rodal f: tkx Kristian|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so  must be natural then|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: 4@H prommise @C cuebid so at the line|pg||
nt|reisig: Was 2@s everyone's choice?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bvdahl: or this way|pg||
nt|cicus: pleasant lie of cards|pg||
nt|bvdahl: depends on whether or not he showed any values by passing the x|pg||
nt|chick: strange he would not show the major though|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@S many play that jump yo 4-level = void, and 3Nt = unknown singleton (splinter)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in Norway, most play jump to the 3 level as showing singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@H - 3@S is unknown splinter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Liked 5@S before any other bids.|pg||
nt|cicus: seems 5@S looked for @C control|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but this system u can combine with 3@c and 3@D as Bergen|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, 5@s makes it difficult to find 7. Give S A@c insted of KJx, then grand is cold|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quality at the @S might|pg||
nt|rodal f: B8 3@SE-1 and 3 IMP|pg||
nt|cicus: what would S have bid with @DA instead of @SA?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: true, 2@s didn't promise anything, so Helness may have taken the view that if Helgemo could bid 4@s facing nothing, maybe an ace and a king was worth another move|pg||
nt|cicus: why?|pg||
nt|rodal f: W didn't signal any @H wich |pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is too difficult for East to find the void|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ady: might try a diamond?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bvdahl: 13 now. 7@s's and 6 @h's|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: does not  know of the trump trick|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@D a que and 5@S ask quality at the @S. |pg||
nt|cicus: decl has to ruff, then can't get to hand , and if plays a spade W ruffs in with the 10|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|cicus: academic now, I am too slow|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: even with K@D more in west hand   slam down on a heart lead    |pg||
nt|dburn: but Helgemo would probably have bid 3@h and then 4@s with a hand opposite which those East cards can make a slam|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes he led low @C|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: 1nt X would have been interesting    big difference on opening lead    Q@D  down 1  spade lead  defence might make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bernix: did not read partners suit-preference |pg||
pc|sK|nt|bvdahl: But Helgemo probably doesn't have a very distributional hand since he didn't splinter in the way to 4@s|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or bud 3@h as you say|pg||
nt|bvdahl: bid|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cicus: how does N know they have @C control?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: it was not possile to play there. Kippes pass was forcing|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|rodal f: AK at @S is ok for the lift K ain't ok|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sorry yes.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bvdahl: because N has denied @c control, thus S implies having it with his 4@h's bid|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H cue over 4@D promise @C control|pg||
nt|cicus: N denied?|pg||
nt|sybarra: did pass force 2 @C or was that suit?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but too difficult to lead from K|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps as S you should pass and compete up to 4@D - vul I think 5@D is an overbid NV|pg||
mc|8|nt|rodal f: A small talk at the table?|pg||

nt|cicus: he could have gaied access now...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: and lets just claim |pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might get the @D right|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bvdahl: anyone for x that one?|pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as X does not mean lead a spade p|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|jcomyn: where the heck are they going|pg||
nt|cicus: 6NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: to the stratosphere ... |pg||
nt|chick: maybe, S did bid 1N, but then N pulled to diamonds|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or go for the @C ruffs if not a @S lead.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|bvdahl: needed @h shift at some point here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe to the making 5NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D2 implied an Honor I assume|pg||
nt|rodal f: Safe is a small @H|pg||
nt|ady: low heart now  best     then time to ruff a spade  and avoid diamond finesse|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: you were right bill - i am wrong again|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, it's quite humorous really ... and you did seem to be on safe ground|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Even if hearts behaved you would be 1 trick short in 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so maybe Tundal will claim rather fast|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Tundal has shown 14-16 balanced, 6c @C and 5 controls (@C Q is one control)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he doesnt expect the ruff, and who would|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S lead not the most normal one.|pg||
nt|chick: well.... N did pull 2@C to a suit the opps bid, I wouldn't expect him to have too many of them|pg||
nt|rodal f: N told 1 or 3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Team. Not match|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: but no ciebids - N jusr took a gamble :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, W opened weak 2, so if you are sure he's got the @cK, then you duck, but you can't be sure. But obvisouly when E play low it is an indication|pg||
nt|pelu: wd S - u follow "my plan" :):)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cicus: hmm, that @C came as a surprise to me|pg||
nt|rodal f: Is that a normal thinking from E? The @D|pg||
nt|cicus: E is forced to the  winning line of a low spade here|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bvdahl: cunning @sK from helness. Made it look like his stopper was weak|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well the killer was clear: 4@D took them beyond their "end signal" bid, so 4@H was now a relay|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the error here is West's ... he failed to plan the auction |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Relayers generally use 4@D as an "end signal" - it says, "partner, bid 4@H then pass my next bid"|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Here, West was in control, and the 4@D bid was ruinous to him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because he could now no longer make the bid himself|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems so - I once invited the norwegian team to my room fo a drink during the caransa and they left at 7.0|pg||
nt|cicus: now all clear for declarer|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: and now for sure @DA not in W|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will still miss 2 more I belive|pg||

nt|vugraphztc: more attractive to open light when downs are counted by the 50s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and NS can make 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: why does it show one of those? it just shows a normal 2@d overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: vul is irrelevant|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: that is simply not true|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: for me at least|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|dburn: and North-South can't quite make four hearts - the defenders can get a spade, a heart, a diamond and a club ruff|pg||
nt|henryb:  Welcome David. A breath of British sanity has arrived|pg||
nt|roswolf: david that is my agrrement - double + bidding the transfer suit show other types of hand i like being able to show a strong nat overcall -|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: very well, but you should not want to show a strong hand with diamonds when what you have is a hand with diamonds and spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  Is 3N really inescapable on the E-W cards?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||

nt|roswolf: no henry but west couldnt conveniently show positive @D support below 3NT - my way allows him too!|pg||

nt|rodal f: @D=@H and ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and that was in 1980 - so they havent changed since then|pg||

nt|ady: west has useful values for east|pg||
nt|bjacobs: John, what do you think about this one?  |pg||
nt|sharkey: Skjetne had one shot at it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 11 is possible in spades|pg||
nt|dburn: four-card majors, or three and a half card majors in this case|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is an awkward situation for East-West|pg||
nt|bvdahl: if N is psychic, he will lead @dK|pg||
nt|ady: on hand 9   in OR   the leaders lost 10 imps when e/w reached game   strangely in 4@H  rather than the more obvious 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Good lift and 3@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: when opps playing transfers over 1@C, it is a common defense this. |pg||
nt|rodal f: 17HP bad but fight is normal|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: D would have shown @D|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 1@S is natural overcall, while 1@H (the suit opp shown with 1@D) shows cards for a TO double|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was to good for that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: E manufacturing a minus|pg||
nt|bvdahl: nice lead|pg||
nt|ady: should get home   3 hearts 1 spade 1 diamond and 2 clubs on the club hook|pg||
nt|chick: I play that as limit raise or better with 3+ trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we call that an "unassuming cue bid", ugly name|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive the @D to be founded|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bjacobs: Safe to say: "no problems on this board" ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lets not get into trouble on this one pard|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: good + well timed bid by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: on a diamond lead  12 tricks can be made   and should make at least 11|pg||
nt|sharkey: Erichsen takes the "safe" out|pg||
nt|roswolf: where was the axe??????|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@C insurance although W had a sure defence including the spade ruff|pg||
nt|sharkey: After 6@Hx??|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead 10 tricks    otherwise liekly 9|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   tht the contract was 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: TO double meaning: either "regular TO w/ 11-16" or superstrong like here |pg||
mb|3N|nt|bvdahl: yes, +90 probably|pg||
nt|bvdahl: don't think it is possibe to raise a spade trick for a @h discard|pg||
nt|cicus: he was not sure of a 4th trick|pg||
nt|rodal f: Stolen?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: sorry about the misclicks|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: who don't know whether their opponents are in a seven-card fit or a nine-card fit|pg||
nt|bvdahl: passing the x would have been the best action, but very difficult to see that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no thats the last time i say that - i promise|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: thnk this is at least 2 down|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, when Larry wrote The Law, he didn't have four-card majors in mind|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: now they have actually started claiming in trick 3 :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope. New press.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bernix: the opposite is an "unhumble cuebid" :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder why J@H|pg||
nt|chick: and when you stand up on your chair and yell it,  it means you really have hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: At the end it seems as NS got a nice shot for -1|pg||

nt|ady: take a plus of 100|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well. We se the cards. Stolen.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bvdahl: not sure it is right to say he SHOULD make 11 it they cash 2@c's|pg||

nt|ady: if they find a club lead  defence has a chance|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sorry folks she who has to be obeyed calls|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bvdahl: with the x it should be possible to find the @s's|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|dburn: the opponents are supposed to bid like civlised people - open with five, raise with three|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s3|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sounds right.|pg||
nt|bernix: case resolved. player showing "noticeable disappoval for partner's defense"|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|bvdahl: the lead might have given away one trick, but should still be one down|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's the penalt bernard?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: penalty|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was that the best % after opening from S?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: try to raid defenceless infants and then take the pewter instead of the family silver|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or best Geoffery?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: did he get a ticking-off?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bvdahl: W should pitch A@h here|pg||
nt|bvdahl: which will lose to @sK|pg||

nt|dburn: Helgemo just bidding out his shape, but it looks as though Helness thought 3@d might have been fourth suit, which is why he didn't just bid 3NT|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: S was not thinking before passing.|pg||

pc|c3|pg||

nt|bvdahl: yes, but I am assunimg @h lead and a @h|pg||
nt|bvdahl: of course, if they cash the first 5 tricks it is not easy to make 3 NT|pg||
nt|dburn: even so, he can't make it even if he doesn't just play a diamond - surely South will cover a diamond spot from dummy|pg||

nt|rodal f: Kristian. Can u ask for that 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: see bidding box Frank|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: it showed singelton in one minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: not a lot in the playing of this hand...|pg||
nt|ady: good game on slender values      needs club finesse  unless trying for an end play     cant go wrong  as  Q@C appears 2nd round|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: end?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Kippe nows pd has 17-19, so the hand is not worth more tan an invite|pg||

nt|rodal f: Not that bad. 4@S minimum|pg||

nt|rodal f: Tkx:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: But what will happen next?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cicus: even deducting @CAK he still has 10 useful points, could have 5 out of 15|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but then i wouldn't earn my 10,000 a year|pg||
nt|cicus: still, slam is not good|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not so straight forward, but if EW cash 3 spades, W will be endplayed after 4 x @h's and exit with @dA and another @d|pg||
nt|ady: just lose 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 @S loosers?|pg||
nt|ady: 3 seems a lot?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree but if so might a @D looser. Team play.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|ady: club finesse best shot   as if it happens to lose to doubleton   then another chance of defence being end played|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|cicus: apart from the possible 2 heart losers trumps must also behave|pg||

pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: What's the correct play in the heart suit here?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcomyn: get it over fast finesse at trick 2|pg||

pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Can be copied.|pg||

nt|bjacobs: No it doesn't - you have two losers if East has all 4 hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr there David and specs.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: However, maybe running the jack is better, because East might have led @HA from @HAx|pg||
nt|sybarra: but frankly happy to make 2 at the table|pg||
nt|bernix: will make 6 now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: Anyway, a rather fortunate swing there|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bvdahl: In OR, N downgraded his 18 to 17 and they avoided the game|pg||

nt|bvdahl: x from W now, is that take out?|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: might be 10 EW, as some specs remind me|pg||
nt|rodal f: Shud there be any reason for that? E balancing.|pg||
nt|cicus: no|pg||
nt|dburn: West perhaps wondering why East didn't open the bidding|pg||
nt|cicus: the reason is this hand|pg||
nt|pelu: your bid: Pass or 3@H?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2 @s is as high as they can make, I think|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have another 9 card major fit with 21 hcp   but only around 8 tricks this time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in spite of the  minus results which occur|pg||

mb|2H|an|5+!H, to play|nt|cicus: I'll do the maths later|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may float off 1 or 2|pg||
mb|d!|nt|bvdahl: 8 or 9 in @s's NS I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy game|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually game is not far off|pg||
nt|ady: must have different cards?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: I explained 1nt as 8-12|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT non vul=8-13|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|bvdahl: maybe not...|pg||
nt|chick: first someone has to bid them|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Aa had a chance to bid 1@s's but decided against it|pg||
nt|dburn: would bid 3@h, but could pass - don't understand double, which I think is penalty|pg||
nt|cicus: a matter of agreement, in the Robson book it is left open, I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - THAT far off....|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sorry 8-12|pg||
nt|ady: thats a new one on me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cant blame south for keeping out of the auction with a poor spade suit  and a singleton of partners suit overcall|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think 9 tricks is most likely here. a bit difficult to do everything you want to do to make 10|pg||
nt|pelu: also penalty for me|pg||
nt|bernix: agree with frank. i would have opened that particular 11-count too|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: I wonder if 3 @S bid would have been the "big hand"|pg||
nt|ady: not so lucky this time     but difficult to stop as low as the 2 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: true but not if west takes this view|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: seems difficult to make 1 NT as well|pg||
nt|cicus: but I play it as penalty, too|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I just asked the question :) The distrubution was good for a take out...|pg||
nt|rodal f: See 9 now if S duck first @H and or @D returned|pg||
nt|pelu: ok: fast X = penalty - slow X = take out :):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: still not for me|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: why not pass 2@HX?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems= after a @H lead.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: west might play a low club after the diamonds    if so best if north plays Q@C    and clears spades    but not easy to see|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4333 and 13 HCP not the greatest|pg||
nt|rodal f: Who have the @SQ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: + a free @C pitch|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: U was right. Not fare of. 3NT?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: 9s and 10s don't do enough to make up for lack of everything else|pg||
nt|rodal f: Style. In Norway I belive 90% will open.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: south already parted with 1 spade|pg||
nt|rodal f: If not more.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

nt|bvdahl: after the opening, they will not stop|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree |pg||
nt|sybarra: they needed a way to be able to stop in 3 |pg||
nt|bvdahl: and I will always open on that hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what that would be  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5/4 hands  i do open 11 counts|pg||
nt|rodal f: ? Just wonder the % for this.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|chick: sure, distributional hands are different, but this is a 4432|pg||

mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 7@d can make here|pg||
nt|bvdahl: good result EW in the open room here. Fortunate lay of the cards|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: 11 tricks for e/w in hearts    |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Well yes, but it will be exciting on a heart lead|pg||
nt|bvdahl: unless @h lead since @d are 4-0|pg||
nt|rodal f: All this is sorrely only in Norwegian but here u have the rules: http://bridge.no/var/fckeditor/bridgeno/file/PDF/SM/2010-11/Velkomstbulle_feb_2011.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told we will have 1/2 hour delay for restart |pg||
nt|sybarra: E too good for 1 nt|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H down 1 in OR|pg||
nt|ady: nad red suit splits|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: You can still make it|pg||
nt|bvdahl: very natural to reach 3NT, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Also a funny board.|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|Walddk4: Finesse @S10|pg||
nt|chick: provided entries aren't knocked out too soon|pg||
nt|ady: not on heart lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's quite a double|pg||
nt|jcomyn: crazy contract in open room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And a daft one here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so likely we will start at top of NEXT hour  |pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3@d shows h's, I would think. E wants to figure out if W holds AK of hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: so we will see bidding similar to other room   |pg||
nt|sybarra: so slightly different |pg||
nt|bvdahl: in the other room, E bid 1@s showing @d's|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: webcam from OR: http://bridgefestival.no/refresh.htm|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H here also?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the vul will tempt 5them|pg||
nt|sharkey: N won't stop till game|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: yes... I guess it might ba the best line when you see @d's 4-0|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And that's about the only chance after West doubles 4@H as he did in the open room|pg||
nt|ady: somewhat unlikely|pg||
nt|bvdahl: same auction in the open room|pg||
nt|sharkey: will the 4-1 @H break be a problem?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but the club values are not pulling their full weight|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: vestfold romping away now |pg||
nt|ady: may be a push|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive so|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|jcomyn: well p did double with his super 3-count|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Honestly, the CR auction makes more sense to me than this one|pg||
nt|cicus: middle @D for 3 tricks there?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now toy are losing it bill this is the closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: when I play multi, I like using 3@c showing a maximum weak 2 opening, and then transfer to the suit with minimum|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so 3@d would show @h's and minimum|pg||
nt|ady: next hand last of the session|pg||
nt|ady: this should be quick|pg||
nt|bvdahl: as long as Kippe plays diamonds when he gains the lead with @HA, EW will be held to 11|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 30 mins delayed due to problems with duplicates. Lunch break after next board. 2nd half of round 7 starts 16.00, 65 mins from now.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: play @c in trick 2 is probably best since there are no entries to enjoy @d's even if you can raise them|pg||
nt|ady: no top losers    but not enough winners|pg||
nt|rodal f: U mean 6NT by no @S lead?|pg||
mb|7H|nt|bvdahl: souths hand is massive now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Austberg's leap to 6@D was a tad lazy|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 1 down? NS will get 3@d tricks, and not possible to ruff more than max 3@h's|pg||
nt|chick: unlucky lie of hearts, and the @DQ lies badly|pg||
nt|bernix: got to find the @dQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will declerer find @DQ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard for N to sop now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: so then you will have 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks another boring push|pg||
nt|rodal f: *stop|pg||
nt|sharkey: View N can have a pretty strong hand for 2@H S is compelled to raise I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: yes, not many losers, really|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think the 10 is rite here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: that leap was not lazy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It was, but it may be winning|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR 4 @D-tricks|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ruffing finess in @c's is of no help|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: got even higher|pg||
nt|rodal f: No push:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: that @C10 only help decl |pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: swingy here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or are we all going daft|pg||
nt|chick: I think no, because even if he gets a count, it's in the short diamond hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|chick: What do you suppose 4@H means?  The suit I need help in?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: found the critical lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think Molberg makes it|pg||
nt|ady: see if he takes your line Roland|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think 4@h's shows slam interest|pg||
nt|bvdahl: kind of last train|pg||
nt|sybarra: some times there are just gliches,   we all have to live with them |pg||
nt|bernix: play club now. he can endplay west|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate that 6@H does not make|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not Xed so 2IMP|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: true but at my club they would pass and gather in 6 imps every day of the week|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 times @S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: NV they might have...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bvdahl: @c7 will be the entry to take the @h finesse|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bvdahl: bit not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: When East shows out in diamonds it must with the odds to finesse spades, no?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bvdahl: has to play @d niw to avoid 2 down|pg||
nt|bvdahl: otherwise BS can get 4 trump tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: might take a club finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. 100% so missed the sac|pg||
nt|chick: or east|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bvdahl: or @d A, obviously|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: a kib is suggesting that it is RKC, another that it is anticontrol :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not enough tricks, David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That only gives him 12|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a club in dummy  and later discard the hearts on spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 4@h was asking for aces, 4@S showed 0 or 3|pg||
nt|ady: more likely to rely on the spade suit  than take an early finesse|pg||
nt|bvdahl: BS - NS|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|bernix: not exactly. because a ruffanddiscard is to no avail. still has to guess @dQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: And now need to be careful|pg||
nt|sharkey: In this case @CK or Q was right at trick 1 as N needs only one pitch - as pointed out by Kristiuan - no time to force @CA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: Thanks Kristian :)|pg||
nt|chick: a ruff sluff doesn't solve the whole problem though|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bvdahl: on the hand that EW needed @d lead to make 3 NT, OR tried 4@h x for -200 and 13 IMPS|pg||
nt|bvdahl: boars 26|pg||
nt|roswolf: of course here it will make and the bashers will have won again|pg||
nt|sharkey: *Kristian|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bernix: now it does|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: ht  finesse coming up|pg||
nt|sharkey: When Vul games with approx 37% chance of success should be bid - due to 500 game bonus|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d7|nt|bvdahl: yes, no alternative|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: Done|pg||
nt|chick: yep, two of them enough :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well played Berg|pg||
nt|rodal f: But normal is to play for @H2-3 or 3-2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: fingers crossed and eyes closed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Erichsen had to win  A@C|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sharkey: yes - may have some uppercuts here...|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: in OR the board started just the same way. E promoted an extra trumphtrick after ducking first @H round|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: and now a bunch |pg||
nt|bvdahl: if you had flipped N and s cards there, you could win the conract by playing 3x@d with the endplay....|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: could not understand this line |pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: Having a nice endplay now|pg||
nt|sharkey: Vestfold will increase their lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Endplay. LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: looks like this is working better, after not drawing trumphs|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: Successful line for this hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: wd|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bvdahl: club finesse is not an alternative since he cannot cash 3  @s's before drawing trumps|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: club finesse  at trick 2 would have worked|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sJ|pg||
mc|12|nt|rodal f: Bogdan was right. Said a push |pg||

nt|ady: I agree   just drawing trumps and relying on spades   or taking a view of a spade finesse more likely|pg||
nt|bvdahl: We can all agree that Molbers play was not optimal. he needed the @s's 3-3|pg||
nt|dburn: South might volunteer 2@h if this comes back, I guess, but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: And many thanks to my fellow commentators John and Gabor ... our heads have been spinning this set, but the comments have been good|pg||

pc|h2|nt|rodal f: This will give some IMPs|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bvdahl: not much else to do than play for spades 3-3 I guess|pg||
nt|cicus: a good set it was, surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the Norwegian Bridge Federation (Inger Hjellemarken)  for putting on this entertainment|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but this could get a bit painful|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: flat|pg||

pc|s6|nt|bernix: very enjoyable|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tkx Geoffery:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Surpriced me.|pg||

nt|sharkey: Txs Kristian - Godt Jobba :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bvdahl: at least two down, I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: in another match earlier, we saw the long trump suit ruffing...not good|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D strikes me as a more honest bid, although it doesn't necessarily get you to game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thanks lads it was fun|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next match to start in 13 min but we'll might be a bit late. NOT NORMAL|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|bvdahl: even if EW had found the @d ruff, N could solve the trumps without losers|pg||
nt|sybarra: (thinking here about hts)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: would he not have go down if west had J@S doubleton the way it was played?|pg||
nt|ady: maybe  not     can carry on with spades  untill  west ruffs   then use A@D entry later|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|chick: this looks pretty tough, can't draw trump and also ruff diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: if W ducks this, hard to set up spades also|pg||
nt|rodal f: So start is 0900CET|pg||
nt|bernix: chance to level the match but i can see no way|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: results will hopefully soon be up to date on this link: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe if west doesn duck|pg||
nt|chick: if W wins, he has enough entries to set up spades and get to them|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: time is up, but still 6 of 10 tables are playing - the cards must be difficult this round :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Result so fare: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||

pc|hK|nt|bvdahl: a @d now will force N to figure out the club situation|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bvdahl: but if spades are 3-3 or 4-2 with Kx, he might as well pull trumps, so it wasn't the best line by any means|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the next set is due to start in around 15 minutes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Good point from Sveing here. Kippe should have x if he wanted to balance. Normally shows the distribution he's got since you can bid 2@s with 4 card @s in the balancing pos|pg||
