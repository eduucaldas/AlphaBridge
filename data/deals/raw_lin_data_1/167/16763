nt|ralfwil: Gooe evening everyone!|pg||
nt|chick: NS may end up in a very reasonable 4@S, going down on the bad trump split and offside kings|pg||
nt|jillan:  Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: NS playing natural with 4-card majors and 15-17NT|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks Magnus :)|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|jillan:  so here we are, now we just have to make it....|pg||
nt|chick: 2N is certainly a forcing raise and 4@S says nothing extra|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Peter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hej Peter!|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an easy hand to declarer|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jillan:  East doesn't really have a good lead.|pg||
nt|chick: that lead will help a lot, giving a pitch for a red loser|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can make with correct play. May not play a high @s from the hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: it's true, any lead gives a trick|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Peter :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and after A@h what then?|pg||
nt|pelu: DD a @d|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe not A@h niow|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs an entry to @d if he finds that play|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|rnc: Welcome back to the broadcasting of the 12th Filbyter Cup, Round of 16. We are in the city of Linkoping (with approximately 150.000 inhabitants) at the east coast of Sweden, some ...|pg||

nt|rnc: which gives us the number of IMP's per board the 'less skilled' team get as a bonus. As it is a KO-match, even a fraction of an IMP might be important at the end of the match...|pg||
nt|lestergold: a small @d to the T if won by south gets declare3r no where|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|chick: that @D8 may actually prove to be an important card|pg||

nt|bvdahl: I think I agree that 4@h is probably best in the long run...|pg||
nt|iceking: yes and you usually make overtrick so given that 3@H has to be underbid|pg||

mb|1C|nt|othered1: maximim weak pass by north|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: The @DQ the key here|pg||

pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  as for now, tha matter of course follows the same way as next door|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  trump return?|pg||
nt|sharkey: West has a chance to go wrong - dont know pd has @SK...|pg||

nt|sharkey: EW dont have a good round so far...|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|othered1: east, of course, wasn't looking at 52 cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looking at dummy's @D suit a @D return wudnt be likely anyway|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  exactly. now it's up to N|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
mc|8|nt|iceking: he had to do something, his line seems fine to me |pg||

nt|othered1: agree|pg||
nt|iceking: Not clear for north what is best now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  simple matter of guessing correctly|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  so, last board of the round|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sfoxa:  last board of this round|pg||
nt|bessi2: looks like 4@s should make easily enough as the cards lie so a good result for Brogeland-Sælensminda in the open room|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|4S|nt|sharkey: Big round for NS and Lauria-Versace struggling next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 1@C simular to magic @D|pg||

nt|mareczek: I think that 2@s solved all problems of N|pg||
nt|mareczek: his problem now is 6 or 7?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Ns hand deserves one more move|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S can have at all valueless hand, kind of xxxx QJx xxx xxx - but only this case is really bad for N|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think that rdbl was "bid your suit" and 2@s promises some values in this case|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ybob: 5@H defeat 500 with @D leads from S ( played by E) , hard to do|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|iceking: yes looks clear duck trick one |pg||
nt|jillan:  gives W entries to play @C from dummy|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bessi2: and now another diamond and declarer must guess|pg||
nt|ybob: was better play K@D and @S to hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. east must not ponder too long though|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|iceking: will just use it to play @C to Ten i assume|pg||

nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: The reason is that N lead a spade from hand out of turn|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but better is to look for Easts distribution. 5@h and perhaps/probably 4@d. @s can be 4-1|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pelu: again one of my normal rubber-hands in East :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: The 21 IMPs must be some kind of carryover from a previous session|pg||
nt|jillan:  sorry partner I am an idiot is what I would like to say and hear when I screw up|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as cards lie i thinkl 5@d rolls in|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzwe: Popular contract|pg||
nt|chick: nah, I don't want to hear that kind of thing ... bridge is a game of mistakes ... would be more interesting to hear his reasoning, even if wrong|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jillan:  maybe they should just bid 4@S directly|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: is this auction for real?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jillan:  this has better chance though than the previous one|pg||
nt|chick: why waste time bidding, just set the contract at 4@S for whoever has the longest spades :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but  magnus explanation tells everything|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|ralfwil: cross ruff in the defence after a @c or @hA|pg||

nt|vugraphzyv: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|sharkey: Each round consist of 8 board and the scoring is on IMPs converted to VPs - max score per round is 60-0|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  re-hi|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|iceking: dont think S should upgrade his hand |pg||
nt|mareczek: Herbst brother play natural system with transfer responses after 1@c opening|pg||
mb|3C|nt|othered1: south upgrades to 12, OK with 2.5 honor tricks, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: make little sense to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT a challenge - 4@S better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway, not a coffee-board for a start|pg||
nt|sharkey: nope - East may have overbid slightly - a little to good for 3@S over 3@H.  Needs to take @H finesse I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: West looking at @SQ and @HA....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mareczek: Herbst brothers, sorry|pg||
nt|mareczek: they both use the same system :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 5-3-3-2 shape bad suit cant see the reason|pg||
nt|jillan:  with a system as this I agree with Magnus|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  welcome to the 3rd round of Slava Cup http://www.slavacup.com/tournament.htm|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: well judged|pg||
nt|jillan:  would need at least another 10 LOL|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 1N was just generic point-showing, so south had to bid|pg||
nt|iceking: assume now S has shown 12-13hcp with 5@S |pg||
pc|d2|nt|iceking: N took a very good view stop now, i would be little bid interested in 3nt looking at his hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sfoxa:  EW did their best to win the bidding|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at the tournament web-site, one can find the participants lists (quite impressive) and results for both groups - Top-16 and Top-40|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Even 2 is too high|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: Our operator, William Hernebrink, advises sys on after W 1@h, 1NT on 1@c 8-11 balanced hand |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3@h by NS looks good, even @h game is possible with non-accurate defence|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jillan:  4@S|pg||

pc|s3|nt|jillan:  he is lucky in the @H distribution and also a bit in the @D and @S them being onside|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: This is a handicap event, and the NS team started with 21 IMP plus|pg||

pc|hT|pc|c4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: Not 4@h for me. S has decided 3n1 after a 2@h bid from N. If interested , S should have bid 3@d for checking the majors. N can have 5-4, 5-5 or 6-4 inmajors|pg||

pc|s5|nt|sfoxa:  they are over 3nt, seemingly 4@h finishes the bidding|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  as a kibitser pointed out, S like his hand much more than it's worth|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and only @h lead will beat this contract|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: and not doubled|pg||
nt|iceking: i would have liked N to bal with 1nt here instead of dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump lead best|pg||
nt|sharkey: But East on lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  attempt to pitch @d losers on @c will reduce W trump holding destined to 2 tricks anyway with this @h split|pg||
nt|sharkey: This plays better from N - else @S lead wud also disrupt communicarions|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even with E hand, trump start looks better than any other|pg||
nt|sharkey: *communications|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer sees a lot of possibilities, I suppose|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, the question is which one to choose?|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is IMP scoring and the scores from all 8 tables are included.  On the Movie button you'll see the score from the other BBO table, but the IMP score may not be correct.|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think all options are losing ones Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are aware of it, not so declarer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see, how it goes. Should admit, trump lead created the biggest bundle of problems for declarer|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: wont surprise me if e/wplay in 4@h in practice|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: unless a club lead|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|jillan:  yes you need either the @S or the @D to come home, and they both do|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: can west show his clubs without implyhin he has 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 1H was 4+, 3C shows longer clubs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|jillan:  15 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: Yes, if any of @s or @d breaks - 13 tricks|pg||
nt|jillan:  now see if they can bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: W has now denied 5H when not bidding 3H|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|pelu: 4@D??|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i was expecting 3N after 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E fell in love with his hand|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: and therefore 7nt is better than 7@s|pg||
nt|rnc: It's with mixed feelings I watch (and perhaps comments) this match, since it's my teammates that are playing in the E/W team :), the same team that lost the nail biting finals ...|pg||
nt|rnc: (however under the name of San Sac) with a couple of IMP's after 96 boards the previous year.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion 7nt from E with the @d suit|pg||
nt|rnc: For those interesting in the CC of E/W it's available at http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc11/fc_main_en.htm - check under Convention Cards|pg||
nt|chick: knowing all aces+@SK, E only needs to know about the @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E knows W has 5S, 4C and all aces and spade queen are counted for|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or 7@s as well and W can decide the final contract|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: perhaps trying to stay away from NT with a void in pard's suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: weoh dear|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|pelu: fell in love - but now close to a divorce :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least he gets the 150 honours|pg||
nt|chick: yikes|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think he was frightened of going off in 3N with 8 top tricks and bound to get another in one of the suits he over valued his hand thats why he went on|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E has to contemplate over his lousy bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: west bid his hand perfectly and if anything had better than he promised|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 7D was suggestion to play in that suit, so I think W should have bid 7NT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: agree magnus 5nt also shows @sQ as E already has denied her|pg||

nt|othered1: Here's a good chance for east to get back into the match|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: 4@S I think is the bid of choice...|pg||
nt|mareczek: another slam|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after all, we have next board|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1@d transfer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  isn't my choice, but I now few who would willing |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|iceking: what should w bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@H maybe |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  contemporary openings became lighter till impossible - S hand wasn't opening worth in accordance with Acol standartds |pg||
nt|mareczek: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r2.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this one looks better|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mareczek: running scoers|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW would better to stop low|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: N Splinter bid 4@H - as suggested by kib|pg||
nt|mareczek: scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Roberto Martínez|pg||
mb|d|nt|jillan:  3NT should make....|pg||
nt|jillan:  or could anyhow|pg||
nt|othered1: This hand might work better without the 2@C opening -- a common result with a minor 1-suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: scroll back :)|pg||
nt|iceking: horrible hand in any system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes Ed, but what is your rebid after 1@D  1M?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Today I think all players would open 3rd hand - many also 1. & 2. hand|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi Roland, hi everyone|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Roberto|pg||
nt|ybob: Hello :)|pg||
nt|ybob: what is 1@D by S ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good question|pg||
nt|ybob: i agree with 1@H but i like pass 1@S|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@D = no 5M|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 2 other major|pg||
nt|othered1: easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 2sp probably over 1@H if you open 1@D |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ah, Italian style|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent treatment|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant see open this east hand 1@D |pg||
nt|jillan:  me neither|pg||
nt|sharkey: 10 or 11 tricks here - coffee time...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, really - 3rd hand allows that. I disregarded this "pecularity".|pg||
nt|ybob: pd shows 5@S so this shows limits values|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: EW may have missed a good sac|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - @s game is cool|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, 1@s looks better even with 2cards by W|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|iceking: problem doing so is you have such a powerful hand, you will need rest of your bidding trying to recover |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can because a jump in the other major is artificial as I play it|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|iceking: and usually end up just guessing |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can be a hand too good for a 3@D rebid|pg||
nt|ybob: 5 tricks by EW|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: Actually, in Kaplan-Sheinwold, it can go 1@D -1M - 3@D forcing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guessing @c right ends declarer's problems, even if not, he can escape finding W with short @h but 2 trumps only|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ybob: now K ?|pg||
nt|ybob: K shows 3@C and good time to play another @S from N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS have to attack @d in time|pg||
nt|ybob: @D will play from S|pg||
nt|ybob: K@C , @S, and S low @D |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|iceking: but it doesnt show a hand to good for 1@D opening:)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|othered1: showing a hand you'd have opened 2@C if suit were a major and you have hand an extra natural bid along the way.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I try to avoid opening 2@C with a long minor, especially diamonds|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|othered1: have had|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|iceking: i agree its the worsed seq after 2@C opening|pg||
nt|othered1: If you generally open old-fashioned soundly, you get some edges on the big hands . . |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mareczek: 4@c + 4@s + ruff + @hAK +@dA = 12|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW are granted wit 1 trick|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  hello|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  after all, 12 tricks are here|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|othered1: If I jump shift without a fit, the field likely would have opened 2@C|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: After previous hand de Wijs and Muller may still be "shell shocked"|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  cheap escape|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The only makeable game here is 3NT by N-S. Impossible to get to|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree. when player starts with -12 imps score in 1st board, his level of cautioness rises at once|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|sfoxa:  why did W reject his last chance to win, if @h behaving well with small defence mistake? just by the way|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ybob: good result to Ew, NS win 8 tricks NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|iceking: i guess you overcall 1@S |pg||

nt|Walddk2: As the cards lie, EW can make 5@D|pg||
nt|iceking: and should make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you guess diamonds|pg||
mb|4S|nt|iceking: you will when you see N @H 9J drop |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Top spot, 3NT by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: West's 2@D is transfer to @H - either to play or GF I assume|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm, will S decide to convert this dbl into penalty?|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - dont think so - choice between pest and cholera....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it would be useful for NS, but hardly possible|pg||

pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Are we heading for a major upset? Boye B's are hot favourites despite the 21 IMP handicap they sustained|pg||
nt|mareczek: E takes in hand, cashes @dA, crosses toi the dummy with @cQ, ruffs diamod high, draws trumps and concedes @d|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||

nt|lestergold: 6@h is a with odds slam because ona non club lead its cold and on a club lead you have the option of disposing of the club loser by a guess in 1ds as well as the sapde finesse so ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: id say well more than 505 slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not Dbl on 4@c?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzwe: Because he will be on lead against a heart slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: really 75%? you can play @d on 2 ways and if it loses, @sK must be on side.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: looks like only -1|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: adn that is on a club lead which makes the slam pretty enormous|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|pelu: the normalplay will be the ruffing finess in @D - if no King u discard the @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: you would have to take the ruffing finesse of course to preserve the doubole chance|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not any longer|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|pelu: and the very close to 75%|pg||
nt|ralfwil: curious, we are talking about any slam and now only 4@h|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile Misstit has entered the room|pg||

nt|iceking: these hands we been getting are wild|pg||
nt|othered1: Not the worse slam ever seen here.|pg||
nt|othered1: worst|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'd be in grand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they have 3 more boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 9 tricks NT here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|bvdahl: without a @c lead, 6@h is cold|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|iceking: cant really see how you miss slam here|pg||
nt|othered1: 5 or 7 hand, but only on @C lead. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: New philosophy, I only bid the slams that make|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so it is not really a 5 or 7 hand, is it?|pg||
nt|rnc: It looks like bad coaching from the captain. Who to blame? Me of course, since I'm the guilty one...:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: no you should play 6 on @C lead you can play @D 2 times and pich @C|pg||
nt|mareczek: dbl. = "pass or correct"|pg||
nt|mareczek: now NS in troubles|pg||
nt|mareczek: even 3@h after trump lead does not look well|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@S= neg X without @S |pg||
mb|2D|nt|bvdahl: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: not familiar with n-s system here but suprising to see a 1@c and not 1@d opening|pg||
nt|ybob: they play 1@C p 1@D = no 5M|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S should consider his @h lenght as a stopper and bid game|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H bid now|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|bvdahl: so 6 is more or less 75%|pg||
nt|othered1: in 2/1, west would be 80 percent of the way to slam.  In EW''s acol style, it may not be|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|othered1: 4@D? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D probably a fragment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or maybe just a cue bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: yes...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lesser evil|pg||
mb|3D|nt|othered1: doesn't that normally imply shortness in 4th suit?|pg||
nt|rnc: Cue, I'm told (sitting 2 mtrs from the table)|pg||
nt|iceking: good bidding with no extras w will bid 6@H now |pg||
nt|rnc: Should be short, in my opinion|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in the CR, EW used 5 bids to get to 4@h. Here they might use less than that to arrive in slam...|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 5 bidding rounds|pg||
nt|othered1: Quite a comeback for Vintage.|pg||
nt|iceking: east bidding in closed room looks just surreal |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this one doesn't looks very special|pg||
nt|sharkey: should be off as dummy very short of entries.....|pg||
nt|mareczek: they have found the contract which is difficult do double|pg||
nt|mareczek: East knows that they have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mareczek: should play spade after @cA|pg||
nt|mareczek: otherwise, declarer can play @sJ|pg||
nt|mareczek: and if W will not cash the spades, EW can be in troubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  5@d is good as well|pg||
nt|ybob: S prefer wait to bid NT if pd has H stiff|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: Dont see how East can avoid @D loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: now pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: ok iam trying to see what extras W has someone help me|pg||
nt|bvdahl: good philosophy. Bid the contract that makes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with @d split 3-3, one @d finess and one ruff is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If the Vintage team advance the good news for us is that Hed and Andersson will be available as operators for future broadcasts :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Although we don't need them when we have William and Magnus. They are great!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|rnc: Don't forget there is a Consolation Cup too. But I might bench them to do the broadcasting... :):)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's strong willed of them -- I might be out the door, never to return (during this event.)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sfoxa:  but not this time, yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: can only get to dummy by playing @H - thus no ruff|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  alas|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  helpful hand from defence?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not from this players, though|pg||
nt|sharkey: B has shown @C by X I think - S may contionue with @CK and more @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: *N|pg||
