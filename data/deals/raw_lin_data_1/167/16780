nt|janm: Our auction is a little different from the other room, because Shen had a "toy" available - 1@s over the DBL to deny a 4-card Major, but we're in the same contract as the CR|pg||

nt|janm: clubs from the 1NT bid.|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|d|nt|peachy: Milne team consists of talented young players, who have placed well (though not won) in prior competitions|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this is the 2nd set of 4 16-board segments|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Andrew|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: this hand may well be opened 1NT in both rooms (but i think) its a strong NT in this room and a weak NT in the other room|pg||
nt|frankaus: The Bloom crew is staffed by hardened proffesionals - |pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|1N|nt|noodle:  seems ok to upgrade a good 14; as we have seen  opening bids are very agressive nowadays|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both teams are playing 5-handed|pg||
nt|gambit: one @S or dble, close|pg||
nt|sybarra2: go for it!!  great fun Edgar|pg||
nt|sybarra2: you hate to miss 6 @D |pg||

nt|frankaus: Milne crew the next generation of excellence - have been at the top of many international junior events|pg||
nt|tejjyid: interesting problem for East|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: E let S off the hook|pg||
nt|gambit: will N bid spades next. yes if at an economical level |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sybarra2: likely n/s still find 2 sp or so |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this table is same set of players as Q1 -- just flipping NS & EW|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gambit: "Somebody said down one is good bridge, perhaps making is better." EK|pg||

nt|Walddk4: He will insert result on board 1 in MOVIE soon|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok  did we get names sorted out?|pg||

pc|dT|nt|noodle:  well it is a great spot  wd|pg||
nt|mwigor: with everything so friendly 11 tricks are possible|pg||

nt|frankaus: my suits never break this faviorable :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  if they did franj you d be playing not commenting :)|pg||

pc|dA|nt|peachy: hi all|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Raija and Al:)|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|tejjyid: signaling ofr a @C|pg||

mb|2S|nt|vugraphzzp: some @Hs now|pg||
mb|5H|nt|janm: 2@h looks like an aggressive weak 2 bid, but I'm not sure that qualifies as an alert, so maybe it was 5@hs and 4+ minor?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: i'll check for that|pg||
mb|5S|nt|janm: Is 5@s enough with the E hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Liu thinks so - but Chung may raise, with the heart stopper that he doesn't know is duplicated and the diamonds for a source of tricks|pg||
mb|6S|mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|janm: This looks like an excellent save - 8 hearts and a club for -4 and 800 against the 1430  in 6@s|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|janm: If the 2@h opener showed a minor with the hearts, N knew he had a good hand - a fit if the minor was clubs and lots of ruffing value if it was diamonds. Also can guess that his ...|pg||
nt|janm: partner has a spade void, so they'll be able to ruff spades.|pg||

nt|tejjyid: not that it beats the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winners of this event will get an invitation and $6000 subsidy to attend the 2011 Yeh Bros Cup this coming April|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but highly likely to be flat|pg||

nt|noodle:  tx shirley   it seems Milne will need another comeback|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+|pg||
nt|gambit: looks like a part-score battle and the reigning suit should prevail|pg||
mb|2S|nt|noodle:  the imp is not much  but the fact they ended up in a great spot on a tough hand can boost morale early in the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat  Hans-Nunn play Weak NT   3rd/4th Strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ain't 6.000$ a peace of cake? Is for my workers. OK. Stop now.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe only at the 2 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: both pairs play precision here.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|tejjyid: I wold call it a lucky spot, not a great spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: false pref wit 1-2 ???|pg||
nt|noodle:  i agree :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  better lucky than good, though :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: auto 2@S, IMO|pg||
nt|gambit: 1@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: it's not a disastrous position, but it is difficult|pg||
nt|noodle:  opening bids are getting worse by the second imho|pg||
nt|sybarra: we saw it yesterday, maybe a repeat|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Peake never saw an 11 count he couldn't open|pg||
nt|noodle:  or i m getting old :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugrapha2: ok we're back live now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|rodal f: Road on?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zone 6 is bringing us 2 fun events in the next 2 months    early/mid February  NEC Cup from Yokahama  [vugraph schedule already posted] and the YEH Bros|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: although PASS stops partner from taking your hand in any way seiously|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: [most of] Milne team is looking for 3rd straight NOT final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 2010 they were 2nd in both this event and the Spring NOT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with a slight change to team for the Spring event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Milne-Whibley were semi-finalists in 2009 while still New Zealanders|pg||
nt|sybarra: then maybe we are all getting old |pg||
nt|sybarra2: 1 @D= 0-4  not a good hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: i think i like pass|pg||
mb|4H|nt|noodle:  often pass is better when really crappy hand|pg||
nt|noodle:  44 in minors an nothing in majors is asking for trouble in the competitive bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should go quickly |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: which, since you have complete rubish, may be a good argument for the PASS|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sybarra2: 2 @C = stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I think there is a contradiction between overcalling on not much, and bidding game here on the East cards|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and from there is looks like "junk stayman" |pg||
nt|sybarra2: am told 1 @D = 07 |pg||
nt|sybarra2: sorry thought less |pg||
mb|5D|nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S seems like confirmation of the 3@S bid|pg||

pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: Thanks Andy and hi Al.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: A number of spectators pointing out that opening isn't the prtoblem, not open 1@D is the problem|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|andyv:  good evening Mark:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: in the other room  Peake bid 2@C over 1@S  --  Whibley's 2N seems much clearer|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|gambit: comeon...|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and many say that both 2@C and 2@S would be natural over 1@S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h8|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: might west have been better off, in practice, by pitching @C on 3rd @H?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: Ish is X'd in 5@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS need to make up ground and may explain their aggressive bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: NS had a discussion about who showed what sort of partial spade stopper when dummy appeared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what was the conclusion??|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think E showed the best stopper:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish thought the pass by prescott showed about three small|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: it gets tricky when they allow a @S suit with 15 or 16 cards in it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: From the alerted 1@d opening on board 1, I'm guessing that NS play a strong club and S will open one on this hand|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: But maybe not, since it took a long time for S to bid - perhaps he had a choice of showing a minimum with 2@d or a max with 2NT and decided that this hand with all A's and K's was ...|pg||
nt|janm: a max|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|janm: Not only does he have primes, he also has 2 4-card suits for a source of tricks, so it makes sense to treat this as a max (I'm assuming that the 1NT rebid was something like 16-18)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|janm: The club 9 will be his 9th trick (4 diamonds, 2 hearts and now 3 clubs). Or if W shifts to a spade, the spade K instead of the second heart|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS carding  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs NT the also play "OddBall" in following to declarer's suit|pg||
nt|noodle:  now we ll have a real canadian commentator :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I prefer to open my best suit of 4-4|pg||
nt|noodle:  opening best suit on weak hands is good for lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: brb guys,  checking other room |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|noodle:  I think EW played the junior trial the week before the NOT , right ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's my view|pg||
nt|gambit: I don't like 1NT rebid with a singleton but others disagree|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  nice pull by W|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: great explanation!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what does 5@D show?       faith|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if that showing faith means he doesn't trust partner's penalty doubles:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish is now complaining that he didn't know 3C was alerted|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West, maybe|pg||
nt|mwigor: they both played in youth week|pg||
nt|noodle:  they show stamina then|pg||
nt|mwigor: but not in the trial for the australian youth team|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like this auction at all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|noodle:  tx specs :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: precision,...so not our style|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: milne-whibley (two of the others in this team) made the australian youth team|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Al nd spectators|pg||
nt|peachy: dont see others|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: accepts the transfer:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  seven card suits are hard to describe in middle of auctions|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: whibley shrugged and ish isn't pursing it|pg||
nt|noodle:  as spec points out NS have a different system of answers to 1@c  it might tip the scales|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Indeed, if you have complex methods 1@C is better, as leaving more room to exercise them|pg||
nt|noodle:  I also have a rattle theory when it comes to bridge gadgets|pg||
nt|noodle:  it goes like this :|pg||
nt|noodle:  if you give a kid a rattle he will shake it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's true|pg||
nt|noodle:  MJ went to the other room presumably|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  hung and smirnov are well known on BBO :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think South snaffled the Youth pairs?|pg||
nt|mwigor: same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|mwigor: it looks like hung has hit on the best lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Strange to see that some still give from the Mol. HUM. Pass over 1@S? |pg||

nt|sybarra: he is here, just being his quiet self|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: Peake did raise to 2@S   --  but won't get any extra credit if both contracts make|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, it's a purely academic point on this hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: commentator's noise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opposite passed hand, i actually like Whibley's PASS -- partner now KNOWS 3@S support  and  won't go overboard|pg||
nt|sybarra: knowing him,  will speak when "needed"|pg||
nt|noodle:  does anyone play unusual vs unusual ?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|noodle:  Silver used to call K from Kx a journalist lead, cause if it works you can end up in the paper (of course here it was the unbid suit)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: won't make much difference though|pg||
nt|mwigor: hung does well trying to kill the diamond suit in dummy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|noodle:  I don t know if it s standard but when i pass a 1 level response partner can be sure I have a 3rd seat opener and act accordingly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: plus -- what can opponents do that is bad?   if they balance in @C  West knows about the 8-card fit|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, not me|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: if they balance in @H --- East would love to defend|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hello Ed,  welcome|pg||
nt|gambit: wel ed|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|nt|noodle:  a nice way to play it is to use 3@c as @hs weak or strong  3@d as spades weak or strong and 3 of a major as invitational|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody, from windy central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|h2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|tejjyid: IF West opens all 6 ard suits with a weak 2, then maybe pass is OK|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: interesting position in @C suit if duck @D  possible intrafinesse via @C to J/Q  then @CA sets up finesse against @C9|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzzp: slam now|pg||
nt|janm: 2@d could be either waiting or 0-1 control, and since 2@h wasn't alerted, I'll assume it's just natural - West should raise and then how the auction develops will depend a lot on ...|pg||
nt|janm: their slam investigative methods, but I agree they should definitely bid this|pg||
mb|4C|an|spl|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|janm: 4@c presumably a splinter for hearts - probably didn't have a way to show 3-card support and a splinter, so it was likely ambiguous about trump length|pg||
mb|5C|nt|janm: Has West done enough with the splinter? |pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: He thinks not, after the 4@d bid, which surely showed some interest in slam|pg||

mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|janm: East's hand isn't so good now that he knows partner has a club void, but it's still very rich in aces and kings and controls - I think he's just waiting to see if partner can cue ...|pg||
nt|janm: bid the spade K, in which case he'd probably have enough for 7|pg||

nt|ahollan1: there was a reason for @C play  -- i just don't know what it was|pg||
nt|frankaus: leads are a huge source of swings|pg||

mb|p|nt|noodle:  1@s2@c2@h3@h then what ?|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|andyv:  probably S gave count on K@s|pg||

mb|2C|nt|andyv:  2@c xfer to @cs|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s|pg||

nt|gambit: Pass?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mwigor: not that tough|pg||
nt|noodle:  4@s coming up|pg||

nt|noodle:  100%|pg||
nt|mwigor: almost unplayable any other way|pg||
nt|rodal f: A pay by the opening?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: perhaps passing 1 @S was right|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but maybe easier from here to say|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right  if 2@S was size ask, 2N would say  reject NT invite|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: prescott says |pg||

nt|andyv:  didn't miss anything|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hmm maybe not|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no way is it 100%; it's by arrangement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat, great shape  @S suit -- automatic 3rd seat opener|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think I'd be more likley to bid 3@H - not so successful here|pg||
nt|noodle:  I like 3N better than 2@S :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact I bet he'd open 1@S in ANY seat|pg||
mb|5C|nt|frankaus: green V red + youth - 5 level NP|pg||
nt|sybarra2: some times you get to bid your 6 card suit |pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|sybarra2: and sometimes your pard even bid 2 @H |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mwigor: david beauchamp thinks that south should have doubled 5@h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, to stop anyone bidding 5@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: although we can see that they can make 650 if they bid on|pg||
nt|mwigor: taking the money in 5@h is a much safer option|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  agreed  this ia a forcing pass situation double as 2 losers is relatively normal (by arrangement of course)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: S hand doesn't look like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duplicate auctions -- i must admit i would have bid a mere 3@H with East|pg||
nt|tejjyid: seems about right to me as well|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  only thing missed is possibly wrong siding this NT:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: i can see "like C" written by prescott|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: of course - i wouldn't overcall 2@H  but that is a different topic :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|othered1: That's an ex post facto conclulsion -- maybe opening and planning to pass 1N (unless they play SNAP, Strong Nt After Pass) isn't optimal strategy.  But I'm not one to question ...|pg||
nt|othered1: someone as experienced and successful as south.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|rodal f: To many loosers at S. Why not trust ure pard and bid then???     If ure pard act.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told that the 1700 from 3rd Quarter is showing up on the ABF site, which reflects scores entered by the PLAYERS -- so it must be right   [even if hard to fathom]|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mwigor: same contract in both rooms - so i predict another flat board|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c5|nt|vugrapha2: so looks like C transfer, positive acceptance, and then shutdown|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Another of those alerted 2@h, I think it's probably 5 @hs and a 4+ card minor - that's what he had both times and although both were also very light if weak 2's, the side minor ...|pg||
nt|janm: seems more likely|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|janm: Interesting that 3@c was to play - N's suit, not a P/C bid to find S's suit. Presumably they had some method to do that (maybe 2NT)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|andyv:  not sure what purpose 2@s served...in OR, S bid 3@d (puppet stayman) which makes more sense on this hand|pg||

mb|2C|nt|rodal f: No inverce here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i was wondering what Adam [Edgtton] was going to respond|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I Was assuming 1@S..|pg||

nt|mwigor: (presumably this showed some 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i don't know their NT response ranges -- suspect 1@C-2@C requires 5+@C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid shows Strong NT|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tejjyid: I recall that 57% is the tipping point - it'd beclose to that|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  cleverly avoiding the 5-4 @h fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for most [many?] 2/1 players --  the 1@D response either denies 4+@H/@S or hand is strong enough to invite over a weak NT rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  also note that south has has the 7@d for mosy hands  very important in junior bridge|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|c9|nt|tejjyid: That was the bid I expected here - transfer responses very popular|pg||

nt|noodle:  not enough to wear it of course...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Go on there:) |pg||
nt|noodle:  very tight match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  5 of 6 hands pushed --  last set the averaged over 5 imps swung per board|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this set much quieter than the last|pg||
nt|sybarra2: these hands have been so unfriendly |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat = weak NT   so Hans must start with 1-suit|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: just realized -- all of these australians are ex-pat Kiwis|pg||
nt|andyv:  the state of the match made 2N more appealing.. can't keep duplicating results in OR.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most hands with 4@C & 4@D are opened 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: indeed they are all ex-kiwis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope   i've been told  once a Kiwi always a Kiwi :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  will south try a baby psych too ?  :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  11 on a partscore deal|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: 23HP NS but best spot EW.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  3@c interesting here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if DBL was 4+@S or 4/5@S [which is how the Italians play it]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America, the standard is  1m-(1@H)-DBL = exactly 4@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the alert, I suspect 4/5|pg||
nt|andyv:  my comment regarding 3@c is that 2N seems very tempting with S hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no,he has a good constructive hand|pg||
nt|noodle:  y|pg||
nt|noodle:  ladies and gentleman, we have a match :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|noodle:  i like the weak notrump non vul  either I have Acol ancestors or i m a chicken noodle|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the precision 1 @D I think again|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: when i played with paul that XX would have shown 4+@d|pg||
nt|mwigor: i doubt martin plays that though|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they.....? Hard|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they alter range exclusively by seat  ---     marty bergen: vulnerability is for children|pg||
nt|noodle:  y all those players tell us vulnerability doesn t matter and stop playing :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: My best controled slam was bidded by 15HP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: harder for North to PASS after partner opens strong 1N|pg||
nt|noodle:  and we go -1100 :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I found that the weak NT solves lot's of bidding problems, but it gves away a lot of information when it ISN"T opened (player is unblanaced) plus it's hard to compete sensibly ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after people bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *lots|pg||
nt|noodle:  use rubensold or similar methods :) lol|pg||
nt|tejjyid: deficit down to 21|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: assumes 2N would be natural|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: said 2nt would surely show 18-19 or so|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would think it would be but I'm guessing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: my guess is this shows 11+ and @C|pg||
nt|noodle:  we name the XX under strenght "kindergarden"  here|pg||
nt|noodle:  like :  you won t make it  yes i will  :)|pg||
nt|gambit: of course N will drive to game, but what game, spades best|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: both pairs play precision here|pg||
mb|4D|nt|tejjyid: NOrth can try 2NT or 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: some might use it as Good/Bad  [so 3@C is better hand than 2N]|pg||
nt|noodle:  the method of using pass as 10+ balanced and transfers (starting with redouble) was suggested by Garozzo over a take out double and is gaining popularity|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pragmatic|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  could be but then 3@c would be alertable|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I don't expect these two using good/bad|pg||
nt|andyv:  they at least got to game|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: think I can see a "4+" scribble describing the double|pg||

mb|4N|nt|sybarra2: welcome to Pat Anderson |pg||

pc|hQ|nt|tejjyid: Myfeeling is that a @D was more testing than the trumps|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this was a goodhand for a "negative punt" with the quack of @D|pg||

nt|tejjyid: that @H 6 wasn't the friendliest LAvinthal signal|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|3S!|nt|janm: I think he could unless they lead a club - then he can't both ruff the heart and pull trumps and pitch the diamond, except double dummy, 1 round of trumps, A and ruff a heart, ...|pg||

nt|janm: 3@s preemptive|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: The 3@s bid made it tough on Chung - he wanted to show his extra club length, but maybe didn't really have enough values for 4@c|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Excellent claim|pg||
nt|noodle:  if shirley lets me :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: YOure typing seems up to it ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 rounds of @H then @D?    West may not have enough entries  [South can prevent @SJ from being entry]|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Peake does well|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: totally moot point because North will never lead @H on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  well NS finally get on the board|pg||
nt|tejjyid: something like that, getting another round of @D in early seems critical|pg||
nt|gambit: Kind of dull hands so far, hopefully we get some excitement soon |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mwigor: martin makes 3NT for 10 IMPs when the other table played a partscore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natural weak 2@D --- how retro|pg||
nt|noodle:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:P64/Bridge/point-count    75321 point count|pg||
nt|fifee: this could be the one :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3N?   2@D??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room in 3@H South|pg||
nt|tejjyid: suit quality is not so retro|pg||
nt|sybarra2: havent been friendly hands,  but also not exciting|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tejjyid: There's an argument for NOrth raising, just because he has support|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: ish keeps on mixing it up :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: funky multi |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  now 4@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: or majors wk |pg||
nt|lmeili: precision here for this table|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: thinks his hand is too good for 2@S rebid -- or maybe 2@D was a transfer advance?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like the West raise on Hx in the pre-empted suit|pg||
nt|noodle:  NS needed a good board to change momentum  (if there is such a thing)|pg||
nt|fifee: 9 tricks at 3nt with a @D lead|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tejjyid: good valuein a trump lead|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes it often allows a lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  2@d looked like LR|pg||
nt|mwigor: if alex wins the first round of @c his pips provide him with a second stopper|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It certainly feels like there is a momentum when you're playing|pg||
nt|fifee: @HQ conveniently dropping :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure wish i had a convention card or notes :(|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: no surprise --  trump lead would have worked better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Sartaj also expected West to have SOMETHING in @D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: s the world's worst opening leader, I'm loath to criticise - but this auction screamed trump |pg||
nt|ahollan1: my 2nd choice would have been @C lead|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  don't need one to see this won't be successful|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: whibley asked something, to which ish said "no discussion"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well correction of 4@H to 4@S surely rules OUT transfer advances|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was Double Dummy Hopeless|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: i double your claim -- in college systems were devised to make ME the opening leader|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mwigor: its a common mistake made that people hold up automatically - overlooking the possibility of another trick in the suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I would have paid  money to see East make that error|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|tejjyid: let's not play together ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not for money, anyway :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oof   STILL no trump|pg||

mb|2S|nt|janm: Wrong! So the 2@h bid is just wide-ranging, not necessarily a side 4 card minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: 3@d or try to get to 3NT if partner has hearts stopped?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|janm: The problem with 3@h as an attempt to find a heart stopper is that it might be interpreted as spade support|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|d|nt|janm: I guess 4NT is Keycard Blackwood for spades, but it may be hard to play in diamonds, and 87 doesn't seem to be adequate trump support for spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: bd. 7 costs 13 imps|pg||

nt|janm: Wow!|pg||
nt|janm: Wouldn't a heart lead have beaten it? He wouldn't have an entry to the long spades|pg||

nt|ahollan1: even with a @D underlead   3N didn't have 9 tricks    that should make South feel better|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry   my [inane] comment was for board  24|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish did observe that DAK lead would make 3NT easy last board|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may be more concerned about the lead rather than take chances|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so really Yeh Brothers (sponsors of this and other tourneys) team is ahead|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Sidney alerts 2 @H , but Patrick didn't.|pg||
nt|gambit: 3NT NS cold, but after E bold Michaels bid, VUL, who knows where they might have landed or how big the penalty wudl be, more than +430  tha is for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: The correct carryover for Weide(N-S) is 13.5 imps.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW wanting to yell    DIRECTOR -- We Were Robbed|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not really sure where Open Room auction went wrong -- maybe the 5@C bid over 4N was wrong Key Card response??|pg||
nt|tejjyid: either that or the trump Q was on East's mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome back patient patrons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other room using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|fifee: 3nt NS or 4@S EW ?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: looks like it is a 2+C meaning for 1C opening|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|tejjyid: OK, that confirms EW are playing 15-17, not 14-16|pg||
nt|gambit: not after this start|pg||
nt|fifee: if N doubles, then Patrick may pass|pg||
nt|othered1: many players around here play double of overcall of 1N at 3-level as negative, while double at 2-level is for penalty.  Not something I like to play.|pg||
nt|gambit: nice time for neg dble|pg||
nt|fifee: leb makes it easier at the 2 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 2@S or 3@S?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: best lesson i learned at rubber bridge -- if you win $20  that calls for a $30 celebration|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|noodle:  I think they upgrade quite freely though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (via the machinery)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 15|pg||
nt|tejjyid: any good 14 is a 15|pg||
nt|gambit: 4d is more thoghtful than 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: run baby run!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now, if u'r not playing 2/1 this is an ugly buit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *bit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a space-filling 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2@C 100% game force, then 2N gets my vote|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+  but 4@C & 4@D usually opens 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|tejjyid: definitely - thi sis the hand which justifies 2/1 (maybe)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as we see -- it let's partner clarify hand with 3@C|pg||
nt|lmeili: some players might bid 3@s instead of 2@s|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  I might have bid 1@h first time with N hand just get away from this mess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, so now we can start cue-ing early, or maybe even BW with 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems now a couple cue bids then some form of Blackwood should get to slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: andrew types faster :(|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I dn't think BW is the right way to go|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess it makes as much or as little sense after a weak NT as after a stronger NT|pg||
nt|fifee: hard to play 3nt if you bid 4@D though|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: THat seems likely to get a director call|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: apparently they use 1C=1+C and 1D=5+D, according to heather|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess EW don't have any agreements here regarding passing runout bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strange not to dbl -- i would assume Whibley's pass was forcing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tejjyid: (but it's a long standing prejudice)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Liam's hand getting better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 4@C was just natural force|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  it would seem so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: certainly if you can use it at the 4@C level, it's better|pg||
nt|gambit: 5d is a sound contrat |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|noodle:  2@D was probably GF checkback|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4@C as a natural force seems to be wasting space - why not cue 3@D on the way?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Again, West is making the decision and doesn't have enough information|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hopefully 5@C = 1/4 Key Cards|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugrapha2: pass is low-variance... opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: lead a @D!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: why would you disturb 2@D if you had correct information?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction screams @C lead so 3N doesn't appear to have a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ummmm screams @C lead|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: The @C QJ are invisble - they bid with filth & East has had no chance to show that he has a good hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tejjyid: it's a good start|pg||
pc|s9|nt|drewsky: Ill bet that 4@C was keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still not easy to take 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tejjyid: The've got to the right contract, so success vindicates their method|pg||
nt|noodle:  always depends if it was a bidding mistake or a mistaken explanation|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d4|nt|andyv:  and trump lead is called for|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Liam Milne -- 3rd player in the triad confirmed 4@C was NOT ace ask|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the best play for 4@D works  IN ISOLATION  but Milne doesn't know he has 2 entries to hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very niced unblock of @D9!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he will make 4@D without abandoning the entry to hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: i.e.  what hand would want to punish 1@C but rest in 1@H undoubled|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lmeili: careless play|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lmeili: @sAK then @h or @d|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: duh -- he's a passed hand  thanks Mark|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it does, but I would call the director to find out|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gambit: now just a question of avoidance and W will never get the lead|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N isn't all that silly, as north must have sound high card values to force the 4-level.|pg||
nt|lmeili: can loose 2 @s 2@d and 1@h|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think even with a passed hand it's a force for one round (maybe up to 1NT)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still seems strange|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h7|pc|cJ|nt|gambit: 3NT has merit, for sure|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  otherwise you are one and done|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i'm with you on that Andy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet Whibley thought that too -- otherwise he probably bids 1@S over 1@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yeah whibley's hand is happy to defend if partner wants to|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who don't know  1st names around the table   W:Michael  N:Tony  E:Liam  S:Sartaj|pg||

pc|cK|nt|andyv:  I think 2N was relay to 3@c to get out|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: scramble 2NT is also sensible... south can't have values after two passes|pg||

nt|rnmalik: and play of @D suit to come.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish and whibley are joking about the DQJ behind the screen before thelead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since only one entry to hand -- after @S lead must rely upon @D2-2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: mildly surprising to pick up in that way against a junior team|pg||
nt|gambit: It is  a crazy system when yoo open your singleton wth 44-14- |pg||
nt|othered1: some are even crazier, requiring no @D at all . . . |pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  S is lucky... lack of entries to his hand will prevent him from messing up the @d suit|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS carding upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|lmeili: in fact S has 2 choices either to guess right @h or to play @cA on side|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|noodle:  nowadays many pairs use a jump to 4@c to show a big balanced raise and leave room|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this auction is the one that used to have universal default where DBL=exactly 4@S   now it can be  4+@S, 4/5@S, less than 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and then you have pard who raises,...|pg||

nt|lmeili: why not 1N?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or double|pg||

mb|p|nt|noodle:  true lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not on same page|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Can't balme SOuth for biding 5 with all that shape. North's three key cards must be looking pretty good to him|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3 small @H, maybe pd is void....|pg||
nt|noodle:  except 4@d is not slammish as a rule|pg||

nt|tejjyid: very attacking bid|pg||
nt|noodle:  he had a junior moment :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: DOn't forget, North is probably feeling a bit sick about going down in 4@S on the misguess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still thinking?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N just shows Strong NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: flexibility is good, right?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tejjyid: interesting problem for North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been nice to hear about opener's singleton @H|pg||
nt|othered1: Note that Mr. Huang followed his silver medal in 1969 with another in 1970|pg||
nt|fifee: 5@C says I respect 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra2: Gong,  is thinking "I am out of this hand"|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I think 2@D understates the hand, but I admint @C K doesn't llok great|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for a quick coffee|pg||
nt|lmeili: Double may not show 5-5|pg||
nt|lmeili: but i will double|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  aggressive opener by E made it easy to get to|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW make 6@D on finesse in @S and @D.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (odd 5@D bid)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S and 5@D are both a mystery to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Whibley thinking 3@C was less than game force.  That would explain 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: how about - 4@S = @C spport & @S Ace; 5@D = 3 @C ACes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 5@D ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could fit Andrew|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hope not - it was an effort to make that up, I wouldn't advocate playing it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and all the dreamers are talking about 6@s or 6@d... I'd be happy to get to game with the E hand:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: there's hope for noble in the other room, then|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is the type of hand that they can take a chance on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cashing at rubber bridge.:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  slam about 30-35%|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and they will know that time is runnin gout|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: the results in the other room have been more boring than here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: anyway, he does have a stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunately -- convention cards don't require explanation of how pairs play the sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: regarding the DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: yes, have to ask|pg||
nt|fifee: tap tap tap and declarer will lose control|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: still, I think with 6 ard @D, you cna try 3@D here|pg||
nt|noodle:  after the pass maybe 3@d ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, you have limited your hand already over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh another guess --- 5@D is operator error and should be 5@H|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'll have to wait for the book|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  usually when you have a large number to catch up, you have to decide that one pair will play the boards even and the other will do the swinging.|pg||
nt|noodle:  pard knows you re under 10H and you didn t open a @D prempt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: just in from Liam    3@C is splinter in either minor, either weak or very strong|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: thanks Liam !!!|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess he respects it.  Of course, south has extra defense, enough that north couldn't double even though this is going down several|pg||

nt|tejjyid: imp-gaining lead|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: the other room is on the final board of the 2nd Quarter|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with 7 HCP I hate to bid as if I have 0|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although in principle I'm for all conventions, they are time consuming|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: easier to do that when you're at the table -- not so easy for us out in the ether|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: however 8 tricks prevailed :-)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Pass is completely reasonable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now last of the set   3rd quarter scheduled to begin in about 20 minutes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this looks exciting|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I like the other "wk 2 bids"  (multi tartan etc) that go with multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: last board here, thanks all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Last hand now , thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Back in 10 mins|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this also 2+|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: i mean, if the opps open 2@d and i bid 3 or 4 M, it means " i would have made the same opening" according to vulnerability etc|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  and now final board|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish often plays such head games|pg||
nt|othered1: Over apreempt, I think you need the jump bids yourself to define your hand, since the preempt, even a multi 2@D, has taken room away from you.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: we thank you CM  great job |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: passed out?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: i think we have the makings of a very good final match tomorrow|pg||
nt|tejjyid: disappointing|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  ty Mark for a wonderful job on vugraph|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: np thanks all|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Al, Rashed and all the specs who joined us... congratulations to the Milne team and I won't say that it was a noble effort.....|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: andy that's a terrible pun|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and thx to Par, Ed and Henri @H |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and to the specs, with your great comments |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I need better wages to hire better writers, Mark|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think this 1@S might be @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: totally illegal, but tons of fun -- in a very casual dup game, we played one system if i was dealer, another if partner dealt  and opponent's card if they dealt|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: that is lots of fun - shame that fee-for-al aproach can't be sustained in high level games|pg||
mb|3H|nt|noodle:  another oz spade ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i brought that up because  Whibley's 1@C gets alerted byt Edgtton's didn't :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: My pleasure.  Nice not to have to debate recommendations to bid every time it's your turn :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: *free-for-all|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@H can go off on @C lead,ruff  and small @D return.|pg||
nt|mwigor: no this one is systemic i think|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@d = @h, 1@h = @s, 1@s = @d|pg||
nt|sybarra2: sorry that was PAT |pg||
nt|fifee: ty all @H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: dont let my fingers do the walking tonight |pg||
nt|othered1: rounded 10s are well-positioned here for Gong.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|noodle:  transfers is ok but alert might have been missed|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|noodle:  I really like transfers over take out doubles|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c4|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  difference between a rubber bridge player and an imp player right there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you everyone... it was fun|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: bye|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tejjyid: surprised East idn't play @D first|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he needs a 9th trick even if the @C come home & "steal early"|pg||
nt|mwigor: this will be a disappointing result for the kids - martin may not play again if the match is close|pg||
nt|noodle:  and there is a case for finessing @c after take out double|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tejjyid: a BIG case|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: most of Milne team was 2nd in 2010 NOT and Spring NOT  -- they're going to have to find new gear to break that streak|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HAns will make thesame 10 tricks - actually, maybe a differnet 10 tricks, but it will score the same way|pg||
nt|sybarra: they have another half to go,    |pg||
nt|sybarra: not over yet|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, Milne had a MASSIVE third set yesterday, 84-11, sostand by after the break|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Andrew,  massive is best desciption|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scheduled restart in 10 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks everyone!!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: See you all soo|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|h5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mwigor: they would have been hoping for a lead|pg||
nt|noodle:  is 1 of 4 segments enough in the event ?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mwigor: it depends on his goal|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mwigor: if he just wants the title then i think 1 is enough|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|h2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mwigor: if he wants PQPs then he needs to play 2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: PQP - Playoff Qualifying Points|pg||
nt|noodle:  if goal is to write name on cup ?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|d6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra2: look how big the 6 of @D is|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|h9|nt|othered1: but west still wins an imp here|pg||
mc|7|nt|sybarra2: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra2: thx all |pg||
