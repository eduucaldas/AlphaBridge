nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Marek Wójcicki|pg||
nt|mareczek: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Marek|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello Marek|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s should be reached by NS|pg||
nt|mareczek: I hope I will be able in commenting Polish players in action|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mareczek: Gawry and Tuszyñski are well known - their first great win was 1984 Olympiad in Seattle gold|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|petergill: NS Convention Card (from Ostend 2010) http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|mareczek: EW play Polish Club I believe|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mareczek: I heard their agreements few months ago|pg||
mb|4C|nt|petergill: 2NT described as Mixed Raise on their Convention Card|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mareczek: Gawrys has told: "use any published convention that you like, I will recognize it, but do not use your private conventions"|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer will have to guess the @d suit|pg||
nt|petergill: West's Dbl makes East's tough opening lead problem much easier|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: 2NT 6-9 with 4 @S's or 10-11 with 3 @s's|pg||
nt|mareczek: Polish leads - 2/4th |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting things might happen if E ducks 1st spade|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Does the Dbl, suggesting long @C in West, guide North towards the successful play? Or is it anti-percentage still?|pg||
nt|petergill: It's a common expert technique to duck the first round of trumps with Kxx or Axx in trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h shift clears up the @h situation but N still has to find the @d Q|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, it's the percentage play to play East for 1DQ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  sluff ruff might cause problems|pg||
nt|petergill: @DQ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|c3|nt|petergill: Entries are interesting: if one plays @DA and finesses @DJ to find East with four @d's, there might be no entry back to North hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  Lauria thinking about 4-1 @ds now|pg||
nt|andyv:  should overtake @s and play small @d to board|pg||
nt|petergill: With 8 (not 9) @D's, the percentage play is to finesse (not drop) the queen, and you can pick up Qxxx more easily from East than West, so even without the Dbl, playing East for @DQ ...|pg||
nt|petergill: seems normal|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|petergill: but I think Lorenzo Lauria is thinking about - if I draw trumps, and play a @D to !J without playing off @DA (my entry to repeat the finesse), I lose if West has bare queen in @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  it looks so normal you have to wonder what Lauria was seeing|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hA|mc|9|pg||

nt|bvdahl: I think I agree that 4@h is probably best in the long run...|pg||
nt|iceking: yes and you usually make overtrick so given that 3@H has to be underbid|pg||
nt|jillan:  Will he upgrade this to 8 points|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: maximim weak pass by north|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: The @DQ the key here|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sfoxa:  in @s game, NS have to guess @d right|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jillan:  the 2@S opening bid shows 0-7 and 5+@S is this to strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: this is makeable looking at all hands|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: 2@C some Gazzili type bid|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|sharkey: Lauria misguessed @DQ OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: The old adage of the Q behind the J......|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for now, tha matter of course follows the same way as next door|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  trump return?|pg||
nt|sharkey: West has a chance to go wrong - dont know pd has @SK...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  both red suits don't look promising for lead |pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW dont have a good round so far...|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: east, of course, wasn't looking at 52 cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looking at dummy's @D suit a @D return wudnt be likely anyway|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sfoxa:  exactly. now it's up to N|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c3|nt|iceking: he had to do something, his line seems fine to me |pg||
nt|iceking: didnt really have any suit to go for, no spot cards anywere|pg||
nt|othered1: agree|pg||
nt|iceking: Not clear for north what is best now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  simple matter of guessing correctly|pg||
nt|sharkey: All going their way will probably finesse the "right" way|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in the  7, EW made 3nt after !Q lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door|pg||

mb|1D|nt|andyv:  misfits will make it tough to place the contract here for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  1@d limited and may not have @ds|pg||
nt|mareczek: 4@s is normal contract|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 1: and if the club count was unknown, and West has slightly less spades then East, then West is more likely than East to have @DQ|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@d - 3@s|pg||
nt|mareczek: I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: i think Lauria knew @Cs were 5-4|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mareczek: but 1@d - 1@s - 2@d many pairs use in Poland Gawrys's transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: 2NT is 15-17|pg||
nt|mareczek: and probably denies 3 cards in spades|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|andyv:  good lead|pg||
nt|mareczek: about Gawrys transfer - after 1@d - 1@s - 2@d 2@h is a puppet to 2@s and respoder passes or clarifies his hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 2: 3NT not quite as cold - if @C are 4-4 and you duck 2 clubs, then a diamond switch by N might beat you, so ducking 2 clubs in 3NT is not automatic.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mareczek: some kind of Gazzilli |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  W will accept|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: The Poles are using the Italians' methods - I think Lauria was involved in the development of Gazzili. |pg||
nt|andyv:  with 2@s losers, E will need to take @h hook|pg||
nt|andyv:  so @h lead at trick one may give him the most problems|pg||
nt|petergill: A Trick 1 finesse of @HQ is the right play, because ... |pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: if it loses, you can still make 4@S is South has @SAx doubleton, which is your other chance|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|petergill: i.e. on a @H lead, @HQ would definitely be played, as it combines declarer's options. |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.slavacup.com/  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer will test for one minor to be 3-3 first, before @H finesse - which minor?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on the USA flag for an English version|pg||
nt|petergill: Does the club switch suggest 4-2 clubs? If so, he will play @DAKx next, hoping for @d's 3-3|pg||
nt|petergill: and will fall back on the @H finesse or (less likely ) try to squeeze North in @H and a minor (which would fail)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: slight indication that N's club was 4th best|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h2|pc|d8|nt|xenya: so he goes for diamonds|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: The squeeze will not be tried by East, because Versace can (and thus would) break up any squeeze with a @H switch when in with @S10|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  and his choices have been reduced to the finesse|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h3|pc|c7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h5|nt|andyv:  now rund 3@s incase S started with 4@cs|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|petergill: Three trumps and then the finesse, not the squeeze on North|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|andyv:  now the guess|pg||
nt|petergill: @HJ was the play of a man trying to look like he had @HK left|pg||
nt|andyv:  E will wonder why S didn't lead back a @h earlier|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: vacant places? The @HJ was a good card but automatic at this level |pg||

nt|vugraphzyv: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|sharkey: Each round consist of 8 board and the scoring is on IMPs converted to VPs - max score per round is 60-0|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Full list of participants looks impressive - we have a little more time to examine it http://www.slavacup.com/list.of.participants.htm|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|iceking: dont think S should upgrade his hand |pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: south upgrades to 12, OK with 2.5 honor tricks, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: make little sense to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT a challenge - 4@S better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway, not a coffee-board for a start|pg||
nt|sharkey: nope - East may have overbid slightly - a little to good for 3@S over 3@H.  Needs to take @H finesse I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: West looking at @SQ and @HA....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  his 10th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 5-3-3-2 shape bad suit cant see the reason|pg||
nt|jillan:  with a system as this I agree with Magnus|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|othered1: well judged|pg||
nt|jillan:  would need at least another 10 LOL|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 1N was just generic point-showing, so south had to bid|pg||
nt|iceking: assume now S has shown 12-13hcp with 5@S |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|iceking: N took a very good view stop now, i would be little bid interested in 3nt looking at his hand|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|c6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Even 2 is too high|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: William plays the same system and is able to explain when he alerts. Excellent!|pg||
mc|10|nt|iceking: maybe he needs to downgrade his hands if his pd is always upgrading:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But still wd by Lauria|pg||
nt|petergill: No squeez, as Versace would have switched to @h's if Versace lacked @HK|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so, I still think a @h lead may have given more problems|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|petergill: Only 65 minutes are allowed for 8 boards - they might finish late this match (a rarity fro Lauria - Versace)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  in CR, @h was led and declarer finessed at trick one|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But they started 15 mins late, did they not?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H GF with 5+ @h's|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|petergill: Smooth duck by Tuszynski|pg||
nt|andyv:  now @d back creates a lot of problems|pg||
nt|petergill: @H back would break up South's communication|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand declarer's play -- it would seem he had 9 tricks by just setting up his long diamond?|pg||
nt|petergill: @CJ back also would damage the communications, to lessen any squeeze chances|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: I simply can't see a 9th trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Versace can without all cards in view|pg||
nt|petergill: @D2 was missing, so West might have had 5 d's, Andy - you can see 52 cards but Versace cannot|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry - Vladimir, not Andy|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|s2|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: and not doubled|pg||
nt|iceking: i would have liked N to bal with 1nt here instead of dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump lead best|pg||
nt|sharkey: But East on lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  attempt to pitch @d losers on @c will reduce W trump holding destined to 2 tricks anyway with this @h split|pg||
nt|sharkey: This plays better from N - else @S lead wud also disrupt communicarions|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even with E hand, trump start looks better than any other|pg||
nt|sharkey: *communications|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sfoxa:  declarer sees a lot of possibilities, I suppose|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, the question is which one to choose?|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is IMP scoring and the scores from all 8 tables are included.  On the Movie button you'll see the score from the other BBO table, but the IMP score may not be correct.|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think all options are losing ones Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are aware of it, not so declarer|pg||

nt|andyv:  looks like a mixed raise|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: East could just bid 4@H, but perhaps 4@C by East might help guide partner towards a save?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|petergill: 1@S opening is compulsory (expert) opening in 3rd seat with nice suit and good cards - also 5431 is a good shape to have.|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  all in all - @s game is cool|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h9|nt|iceking: problem doing so is you have such a powerful hand, you will need rest of your bidding trying to recover |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can because a jump in the other major is artificial as I play it|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|iceking: and usually end up just guessing |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can be a hand too good for a 3@D rebid|pg||
