mb|2C|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@C cue bid to show good hand|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: North has vast reserves of strength, so useful to have what looks like a cuebid available |pg||
mb|4C|mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Kib points out this may indeed be a flat board - 11 tricks -no more no less|pg||
nt|petergill: For those whose style is to jump to 2@H on North's hand to "show the points", the NS superstars here bid only 1@H on the flat unappetizing hand. |pg||

nt|bvdahl: I think I agree that 4@h is probably best in the long run...|pg||
nt|iceking: yes and you usually make overtrick so given that 3@H has to be underbid|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: south upgrades to 12, OK with 2.5 honor tricks, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: make little sense to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT a challenge - 4@S better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway, not a coffee-board for a start|pg||
nt|sharkey: nope - East may have overbid slightly - a little to good for 3@S over 3@H.  Needs to take @H finesse I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: West looking at @SQ and @HA....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mareczek: Herbst brothers, sorry|pg||
nt|mareczek: they both use the same system :)|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|othered1: well judged|pg||
nt|jillan:  would need at least another 10 LOL|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@S slam try in @D...?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D = one or two majors|pg||
nt|petergill: then 4@S = very mild slam interest in @D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: with serious slam interest in any suit, I think they bid Two Under at the four level over 2NT, i.e. 2NT - 4@C (@H) or 4@D (@S) or 4@H )C) or 4@S (@D) are slam tries|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: according to their CC, that is correct|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: another slam - a lively set of eight boards!|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|petergill: Trump lead to 6@C ...Win @CA, North retaining @CJ (best). Cash @DA. club to queen (double dummy play?), ruff diamond high, club to ten and concede @d - makeable but that @C to ...|pg||
nt|petergill: queen play, requiring @CJ to drop from North, might not happen in real life?|pg||
nt|petergill: Even 7@S might make if NS accidentally bid 7@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|petergill: in 7@S, would have to pick whether to play for @C Kx (E) or @C10x (in W)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|petergill: Previous board: on a club lead, declarer might finesse @c10 and go down, as long as North does not play @CJ on the first trick|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@c asked about majors|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H showed 5+ clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 3@S showed both majors, or it might have just shown the hearts, not sure|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: 6@c is more challenging than 6@S - need to pick clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can't find any description about continuations after 2@d-3@c|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|petergill: @C to !j then @CA is the winning play - Versace would like our advantage of being able to see all 52 cards!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like this is misscored on the Result page - shows EW playing 3@D -5...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: confused with board 16?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C Puppet Stayman, we think Lorenzo Lauria should have bid 3@D to show one or more 4 card majors and that 3@H denied a 4 card major|pg||
nt|sharkey: could be double posted|pg||
nt|petergill: So they are in an inferior contract due to the bidding going slightly wrong, but Versace concentrates on the job at hand - how to make this tough 6@C hand. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a suggestion that 3@c is Puppet Stayman, 3@h denies (despite 4@S), 3@s puppets 3NT then 4@H=clubs. All sounds very reasonable|pg||
nt|petergill: If he plays a heart towards dummy, he will play East (with long @H's) for short clubs and will make 6@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: same score entered on Boards  13 and 16 so the current standings not quite correct|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: or he could double finesse in clubs 25% chance or he could play for doubleton ten in West|pg||

nt|jillan:  or could anyhow|pg||

nt|Walddk2: scroll back :)|pg||
nt|iceking: horrible hand in any system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes Ed, but what is your rebid after 1@D  1M?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Today I think all players would open 3rd hand - many also 1. & 2. hand|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|othered1: 2 other major|pg||
nt|othered1: easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 2sp probably over 1@H if you open 1@D |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ah, Italian style|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent treatment|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant see open this east hand 1@D |pg||
nt|jillan:  me neither|pg||
nt|sharkey: 10 or 11 tricks here - coffee time...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, really - 3rd hand allows that. I disregarded this "pecularity".|pg||
mb|6S|nt|sharkey: EW may have missed a good sac|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - @s game is cool|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: problem doing so is you have such a powerful hand, you will need rest of your bidding trying to recover |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can because a jump in the other major is artificial as I play it|pg||
