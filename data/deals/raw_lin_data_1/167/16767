nt|bvdahl: I think I agree that 4@h is probably best in the long run...|pg||
nt|iceking: yes and you usually make overtrick so given that 3@H has to be underbid|pg||
nt|jillan:  Will he upgrade this to 8 points|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: maximim weak pass by north|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: The @DQ the key here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, NS have all the power, but may overboard well|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|sfoxa:  in @s game, NS have to guess @d right|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|jillan:  the 2@S opening bid shows 0-7 and 5+@S is this to strong|pg||

mb|p|nt|iceking: this is makeable looking at all hands|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bessi2: indeed Sælensminde lead a @h vs 2N but followed low when Lauria played towards the Q of @d|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  as for now, tha matter of course follows the same way as next door|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  trump return?|pg||
nt|sharkey: West has a chance to go wrong - dont know pd has @SK...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  both red suits don't look promising for lead |pg||

nt|sharkey: EW dont have a good round so far...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|othered1: east, of course, wasn't looking at 52 cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looking at dummy's @D suit a @D return wudnt be likely anyway|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  exactly. now it's up to N|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|iceking: he had to do something, his line seems fine to me |pg||

nt|othered1: agree|pg||
nt|iceking: Not clear for north what is best now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  simple matter of guessing correctly|pg||
nt|sharkey: All going their way will probably finesse the "right" way|pg||

nt|iceking: yes i know it look silly but it really wasnt i think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, applause and several imps to Brink|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, last board of the round|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sfoxa:  last board of this round|pg||
nt|bessi2: looks like 4@s should make easily enough as the cards lie so a good result for Brogeland-Sælensminda in the open room|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|sfoxa:  thanks to all the  specs for watching and providing with hints, great thanks to our operator, job well done!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Big round for NS and Lauria-Versace struggling next door|pg||
mb|4N|nt|iceking: 1@C simular to magic @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  S hoped for his own play when bidding 1@s, not 2 |pg||
mb|5C!|nt|sfoxa:  next round follows right now, so stay tuned|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  currently, NS are providing 40-20 and keep the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: even the same |pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mareczek: I think that 2@s solved all problems of N|pg||
nt|mareczek: his problem now is 6 or 7?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Ns hand deserves one more move|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S can have at all valueless hand, kind of xxxx QJx xxx xxx - but only this case is really bad for N|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think that rdbl was "bid your suit" and 2@s promises some values in this case|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 5@H defeat 500 with @D leads from S ( played by E) , hard to do|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  will N find @h lead?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sfoxa:  the only chance for defence|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jillan:  maybe S should have ducked that|pg||
nt|bessi2: interesting defence here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|bessi2: he must play a spade from dummy now if he want to avoid a guess|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mareczek: thanks a lot, bye :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|iceking: yes looks clear duck trick one |pg||
nt|jillan:  gives W entries to play @C from dummy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bessi2: and now another diamond and declarer must guess|pg||
nt|ybob: was better play K@D and @S to hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. east must not ponder too long though|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|iceking: will just use it to play @C to Ten i assume|pg||

pc|c3|nt|jillan:  normal result|pg||
nt|othered1: south m ade two odd plays there|pg||
nt|jillan:  10 or eleven tricks|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
mc|13|nt|sfoxa:  NS lost a bunch of imps, but can find consolation in retaining pair's moral. Leading partner's suit. |pg||

nt|vugraphzyv: Hello|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: dont think S should upgrade his hand |pg||
nt|mareczek: Herbst brother play natural system with transfer responses after 1@c opening|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: south upgrades to 12, OK with 2.5 honor tricks, I guess|pg||
pc|h2|nt|iceking: make little sense to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT a challenge - 4@S better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway, not a coffee-board for a start|pg||
nt|sharkey: nope - East may have overbid slightly - a little to good for 3@S over 3@H.  Needs to take @H finesse I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: West looking at @SQ and @HA....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mareczek: Herbst brothers, sorry|pg||
nt|mareczek: they both use the same system :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|iceking: 5-3-3-2 shape bad suit cant see the reason|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  welcome to the 3rd round of Slava Cup http://www.slavacup.com/tournament.htm|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: well judged|pg||
nt|jillan:  would need at least another 10 LOL|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 1N was just generic point-showing, so south had to bid|pg||
nt|iceking: assume now S has shown 12-13hcp with 5@S |pg||
pc|s9|nt|iceking: N took a very good view stop now, i would be little bid interested in 3nt looking at his hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  EW did their best to win the bidding|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at the tournament web-site, one can find the participants lists (quite impressive) and results for both groups - Top-16 and Top-40|pg||

pc|s4|pc|h7|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Even 2 is too high|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: Our operator, William Hernebrink, advises sys on after W 1@h, 1NT on 1@c 8-11 balanced hand |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3@h by NS looks good, even @h game is possible with non-accurate defence|pg||

mb|p|nt|iceking: alot of pdships actually work like that|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  with 25 points, EW have no game to play, but NS can compete till 3@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Any game here's a challenge.... - perhaps 4@H the better|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sfoxa:  NS have enough for the game, but bidding it looks easier than making|pg||

pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  they are over 3nt, seemingly 4@h finishes the bidding|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|sfoxa:  as a kibitser pointed out, S like his hand much more than it's worth|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and only @h lead will beat this contract|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: and not doubled|pg||
nt|iceking: i would have liked N to bal with 1nt here instead of dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump lead best|pg||
nt|sharkey: But East on lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  attempt to pitch @d losers on @c will reduce W trump holding destined to 2 tricks anyway with this @h split|pg||
nt|sharkey: This plays better from N - else @S lead wud also disrupt communicarions|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even with E hand, trump start looks better than any other|pg||
nt|sharkey: *communications|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer sees a lot of possibilities, I suppose|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, the question is which one to choose?|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is IMP scoring and the scores from all 8 tables are included.  On the Movie button you'll see the score from the other BBO table, but the IMP score may not be correct.|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think all options are losing ones Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are aware of it, not so declarer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see, how it goes. Should admit, trump lead created the biggest bundle of problems for declarer|pg||

nt|sharkey: Makes now - huge score to Drijver|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|iceking: probably just takout, 1@C though is limited to max 17hcp so with this pattern and texture of the hand i would have bid 1nt playing this system|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes Ed, but what is your rebid after 1@D  1M?|pg||

nt|ybob: pd shows 5@S so this shows limits values|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: EW may have missed a good sac|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - @s game is cool|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, 1@s looks better even with 2cards by W|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|iceking: problem doing so is you have such a powerful hand, you will need rest of your bidding trying to recover |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can because a jump in the other major is artificial as I play it|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|iceking: and usually end up just guessing |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can be a hand too good for a 3@D rebid|pg||
nt|ybob: 5 tricks by EW|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: Actually, in Kaplan-Sheinwold, it can go 1@D -1M - 3@D forcing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guessing @c right ends declarer's problems, even if not, he can escape finding W with short @h but 2 trumps only|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ybob: now K ?|pg||
nt|ybob: K shows 3@C and good time to play another @S from N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS have to attack @d in time|pg||

mb|p|nt|bvdahl: so 6 is more or less 75%|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: 4@D? |pg||

mb|p|nt|mareczek: yes...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lesser evil|pg||

nt|iceking: good bidding with no extras w will bid 6@H now |pg||
nt|rnc: Should be short, in my opinion|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in the CR, EW used 5 bids to get to 4@h. Here they might use less than that to arrive in slam...|pg||

nt|iceking: east bidding in closed room looks just surreal |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this one doesn't looks very special|pg||

nt|mareczek: they have found the contract which is difficult do double|pg||
