nt|nigel_k:  If South had redoubled to show a good opening North might have doubled 4@d|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: Milne team consists of talented young players, who have placed well (though not won) in prior competitions|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tejjyid: Runners-up last year, if memoryserves|pg||

nt|tejjyid: 2NT , i presme, is for @C|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.summerfestivalofbridge.com/index.php|pg||
nt|mwigor: it took until the first action on the first board for the two tables to diverge|pg||
nt|mwigor: in the other room milne opened the north hand 1@s which will lead to a very different auction|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobholl: agressive 3@H or just 2@H|pg||
mb|d!|an|Responsive|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|vugraphzzq: Hi all|pg||

pc|h7|nt|mwigor: they can run to 5@c but that is also down 2|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|nigel_k:  They can make 8 or 9 tricks in hearts but are probably going to concede 90 to 2@d|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|noodle:  yes and milne mounted a great come back yesterday that kept me up till 4 am :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the 2nd set of 4 16-board segments|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Andrew|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: this hand may well be opened 1NT in both rooms (but i think) its a strong NT in this room and a weak NT in the other room|pg||
nt|frankaus: The Bloom crew is staffed by hardened proffesionals - |pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: E-W also plays precision|pg||
mb|1S|nt|noodle:  seems ok to upgrade a good 14; as we have seen  opening bids are very agressive nowadays|pg||
nt|panja: good|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: 3/low lead for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both teams are playing 5-handed|pg||
nt|gambit: one @S or dble, close|pg||
nt|sybarra2: go for it!!  great fun Edgar|pg||
nt|sybarra2: you hate to miss 6 @D |pg||
mb|2C|nt|tejjyid: X presume single/suited|pg||
nt|frankaus: Milne crew the next generation of excellence - have been at the top of many international junior events|pg||
nt|tejjyid: interesting problem for East|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: E let S off the hook|pg||
nt|gambit: will N bid spades next. yes if at an economical level |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: likely n/s still find 2 sp or so |pg||
nt|bobholl: @C being a minor makes it difficult to reach them|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: this table is same set of players as Q1 -- just flipping NS & EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: "Somebody said down one is good bridge, perhaps making is better." EK|pg||
nt|gambit: nice lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables were not linked, so the closed room operator shut down in order to reconnect. Back now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He will insert result on board 1 in MOVIE soon|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok  did we get names sorted out?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: no|pg||
nt|Walddk4: must wait till next segment|pg||

pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: who needs 8 trumps,anayway?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|noodle:  well it is a great spot  wd|pg||
nt|mwigor: with everything so friendly 11 tricks are possible|pg||
nt|mwigor: but declarer will be more concerned with maximising his chance of 10|pg||
nt|frankaus: my suits never break this faviorable :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  if they did franj you d be playing not commenting :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all of those young ex-pat Kiwis look alike to me|pg||
nt|panja: well..it should be possible to handle Clubs..|pg||
pc|d4|nt|peachy: hi all|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Raija and Al:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrmal to upgrade 14's with good 5 card suits to 15-17 these days, although EW may play 14-16|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tejjyid: signaling ofr a @C|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes it s a great method to signal suit preference when following suit in a known long suit (like a preempt)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: will double finesse in @S so 3 just made|pg||
pc|d5|nt|panja: he shoudl win @CJ and run @DJ..|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|bobholl: the trouble with precision is losing your eventual @D fit |pg||

pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|frankaus: it does help if u & part read the same book :)|pg||

pc|hT|nt|noodle:  yes and to encourage you play a middle card |pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|petergill: 5NT = "Grand Slam Force" (aka Josephine), asked partner to bid 7@c with 2 of the top 3 honours|pg||
mb|d|nt|lmeili: W made their life harder so far|pg||
nt|petergill: at other table|pg||
mb|r!|an|!H|nt|nigel_k:  It's harder to bid grand after opponents open ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: rdbl = @H suit|pg||
mb|2C|nt|petergill: Tough bid for South just then? 3@C? 2@D? 2@C? |pg||
nt|petergill: I like 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: lets see how many hearts now :)|pg||
nt|lmeili: N can bid 5N to ask for grand slam|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Agree with 3@c, 2@c is just not enough|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lmeili: can't bid too mach, they are red|pg||
nt|petergill: but North might think South has only four clubs AQxx in which case 7@C will be very very difficult to play|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@C (instead of 2@C) would have sounded more like AQxxxx, and being a passed hand, 3@C is not misleading|pg||
nt|petergill: Now South has to catch up - 5@C? 4@D?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|lmeili: 4@d?|pg||
nt|petergill: Given that South bid only 2@C before, South bids more than 4@c now|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|lmeili: hard to get grand slam|pg||
nt|petergill: Would 5NT now be Grand Slam Force? Some pairs play 5NT as "pick a slam"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: Hu falls to deep muse|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: and frowning now|pg||
nt|lmeili: for me i'll bid 7, my 2@c underbid so lots|pg||
nt|lmeili: 6 with a void|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: Gong is counting her cards again and again|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If he was certain it was GSF he surely would have bid 7@c by now|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|lmeili: 6@d for what?|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If it is choice of slam partner has spades, so 6@d will make partner reveal what 5NT was based on|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: all roads lead to 7@C .. =)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lmeili: 6@d for what?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h7|nt|mrdct: 7@h might've been a good save|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Play will be faster than bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: in case 5NT weas not Grand Slam Force, South gave partner chance to get out into 6@S or 6NT, knowing that 99% of the time, partner would bid 7@c over 6@D|pg||

nt|tejjyid: not that it beats the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winners of this event will get an invitation and $6000 subsidy to attend the 2011 Yeh Bros Cup this coming April|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but highly likely to be flat|pg||

nt|noodle:  re hi every one :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi and welcome |pg||
nt|sybarra2: not sure what happened all  |pg||
nt|panja: the layout, though, is a little anti-% as W did not have any @H honour for his 5 cards|pg||
nt|bobholl: will probably loose 1 imp but wise anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: in this situation gosney could probably have won the diamond unless he needed martin to switch|pg||
nt|noodle:  tx shirley   it seems Milne will need another comeback|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+|pg||
nt|gambit: looks like a part-score battle and the reigning suit should prevail|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  the imp is not much  but the fact they ended up in a great spot on a tough hand can boost morale early in the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat  Hans-Nunn play Weak NT   3rd/4th Strong|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|rodal f: Ain't 6.000$ a peace of cake? Is for my workers. OK. Stop now.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe only at the 2 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: both pairs play precision here.|pg||
nt|bobholl: see if they can reach 7 ?! @C|pg||
mb|d|nt|tejjyid: I wold call it a lucky spot, not a great spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: false pref wit 1-2 ???|pg||
nt|noodle:  i agree :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  better lucky than good, though :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: auto 2@S, IMO|pg||
nt|gambit: 1@D?|pg||
nt|panja: best to pass dbl|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt 2nt or pass ?|pg||
nt|panja: easier at MP's...but pass should still be a good choice at IMP|pg||
nt|panja: now, withouth source of tricks and with 25HCP, NS might end up in an unmakeable 3Nt|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tejjyid: it's not a disastrous position, but it is difficult|pg||
nt|noodle:  opening bids are getting worse by the second imho|pg||
nt|sybarra: we saw it yesterday, maybe a repeat|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Peake never saw an 11 count he couldn't open|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Zone 6 is bringing us 2 fun events in the next 2 months    early/mid February  NEC Cup from Yokahama  [vugraph schedule already posted] and the YEH Bros|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely 3NT now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tejjyid: although PASS stops partner from taking your hand in any way seiously|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: [most of] Milne team is looking for 3rd straight NOT final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 2010 they were 2nd in both this event and the Spring NOT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with a slight change to team for the Spring event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Milne-Whibley were semi-finalists in 2009 while still New Zealanders|pg||
nt|sybarra: then maybe we are all getting old |pg||
nt|sybarra2: 1 @D= 0-4  not a good hand |pg||
nt|bobholl: now 3@C 5nt ?|pg||
mb|5N|an|GSF|nt|mwigor: i think i like pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  often pass is better when really crappy hand|pg||
nt|noodle:  44 in minors an nothing in majors is asking for trouble in the competitive bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should go quickly |pg||
nt|panja: touch and go|pg||
mb|7C|nt|tejjyid: which, since you have complete rubish, may be a good argument for the PASS|pg||
nt|bobholl: but i don't know wheather that 's old fashioned josephine|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: 2 @C = stayman|pg||
nt|bobholl: it works :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I think there is a contradiction between overcalling on not much, and bidding game here on the East cards|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and from there is looks like "junk stayman" |pg||
nt|sybarra2: am told 1 @D = 07 |pg||
nt|sybarra2: sorry thought less |pg||
nt|bobholl: @C handling will decide this 3nT|pg||
nt|panja: @S power lead ...unblock @SJ if you have it...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW play 1@C=2+ with transfer responses|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS carding  upside-down count & attitude|pg||

mb|p|nt|noodle:  I think EW played the junior trial the week before the NOT , right ?|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: what does 5@D show?       faith|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if that showing faith means he doesn't trust partner's penalty doubles:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish is now complaining that he didn't know 3C was alerted|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West, maybe|pg||
nt|mwigor: they both played in youth week|pg||
nt|noodle:  they show stamina then|pg||
nt|mwigor: but not in the trial for the australian youth team|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like this auction at all|pg||

nt|peachy: Hi Al nd spectators|pg||
nt|peachy: dont see others|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: accepts the transfer:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  seven card suits are hard to describe in middle of auctions|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: whibley shrugged and ish isn't pursing it|pg||
nt|noodle:  as spec points out NS have a different system of answers to 1@c  it might tip the scales|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Indeed, if you have complex methods 1@C is better, as leaving more room to exercise them|pg||
nt|noodle:  I also have a rattle theory when it comes to bridge gadgets|pg||
nt|noodle:  it goes like this :|pg||
nt|noodle:  if you give a kid a rattle he will shake it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's true|pg||
nt|noodle:  MJ went to the other room presumably|pg||
pc|h5|nt|noodle:  hung and smirnov are well known on BBO :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think South snaffled the Youth pairs?|pg||
nt|mwigor: same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|mwigor: it looks like hung has hit on the best lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Strange to see that some still give from the Mol. HUM. Pass over 1@S? |pg||

nt|sybarra: he is here, just being his quiet self|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: Peake did raise to 2@S   --  but won't get any extra credit if both contracts make|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, it's a purely academic point on this hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: commentator's noise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opposite passed hand, i actually like Whibley's PASS -- partner now KNOWS 3@S support  and  won't go overboard|pg||
nt|sybarra: knowing him,  will speak when "needed"|pg||
nt|noodle:  does anyone play unusual vs unusual ?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|noodle:  Silver used to call K from Kx a journalist lead, cause if it works you can end up in the paper (of course here it was the unbid suit)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: won't make much difference though|pg||
nt|mwigor: hung does well trying to kill the diamond suit in dummy|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobholl: no reason for @S finesse i guess|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|noodle:  I don t know if it s standard but when i pass a 1 level response partner can be sure I have a 3rd seat opener and act accordingly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: plus -- what can opponents do that is bad?   if they balance in @C  West knows about the 8-card fit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tejjyid: well, not me|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if they balance in @H --- East would love to defend|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hello Ed,  welcome|pg||
nt|gambit: wel ed|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|noodle:  a nice way to play it is to use 3@c as @hs weak or strong  3@d as spades weak or strong and 3 of a major as invitational|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody, from windy central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|noodle:  gives you 3 ranges of bids   has served me well|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: IF West opens all 6 ard suits with a weak 2, then maybe pass is OK|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting position in @C suit if duck @D  possible intrafinesse via @C to J/Q  then @CA sets up finesse against @C9|pg||

nt|noodle:  4@s coming up|pg||
nt|gambit: this is going down several|pg||
nt|bobholl: only fair (30% i guess)|pg||
nt|panja: this would be a good 4@H a priori..it goes down because @C finesse loses|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: i hold four cards in a suit which partner makes a penalty double of|pg||
nt|tejjyid: YOu think N's X is penalty?|pg||
nt|noodle:  100%|pg||
nt|mwigor: almost unplayable any other way|pg||
nt|rodal f: A pay by the opening?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: perhaps passing 1 @S was right|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but maybe easier from here to say|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobholl: and your @S losers ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right  if 2@S was size ask, 2N would say  reject NT invite|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: prescott says |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: "sorry if we've missed it"|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: so sounds like 2S= range ask|pg||
nt|andyv:  didn't miss anything|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hmm maybe not|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no way is it 100%; it's by arrangement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat, great shape  @S suit -- automatic 3rd seat opener|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think I'd be more likley to bid 3@H - not so successful here|pg||
nt|noodle:  I like 3N better than 2@S :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact I bet he'd open 1@S in ANY seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: green V red + youth - 5 level NP|pg||
nt|sybarra2: some times you get to bid your 6 card suit |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: and sometimes your pard even bid 2 @H |pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|mwigor: david beauchamp thinks that south should have doubled 5@h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, to stop anyone bidding 5@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: although we can see that they can make 650 if they bid on|pg||
nt|mwigor: taking the money in 5@h is a much safer option|pg||
pc|d9|nt|noodle:  agreed  this ia a forcing pass situation double as 2 losers is relatively normal (by arrangement of course)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: S hand doesn't look like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duplicate auctions -- i must admit i would have bid a mere 3@H with East|pg||
nt|tejjyid: seems about right to me as well|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  only thing missed is possibly wrong siding this NT:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: i can see "like C" written by prescott|pg||
nt|panja: right...@S loser to add too|pg||
nt|bobholl: after @S ace @C back -2 otherwise -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: 2@S is nat and inv|pg||
nt|panja: looking at the two hands...NS have only 23 HCP, 9-card fit..a second fit in @S...but South's @S are poor..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: explained by Patrick|pg||
nt|panja: the 2@S try had a misplaced emphasis..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: and Yang apparently didn't know that|pg||
nt|panja: still, 4@H would make with @SA and @CK onside..and @S3-2...so that is about 17%...|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: of course - i wouldn't overcall 2@H  but that is a different topic :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|othered1: That's an ex post facto conclulsion -- maybe opening and planning to pass 1N (unless they play SNAP, Strong Nt After Pass) isn't optimal strategy.  But I'm not one to question ...|pg||
nt|othered1: someone as experienced and successful as south.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bobholl: yes my 30% was overestimated|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: To many loosers at S. Why not trust ure pard and bid then???     If ure pard act.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told that the 1700 from 3rd Quarter is showing up on the ABF site, which reflects scores entered by the PLAYERS -- so it must be right   [even if hard to fathom]|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobholl: 8 tricks but ...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mwigor: same contract in both rooms - so i predict another flat board|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: so looks like C transfer, positive acceptance, and then shutdown|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe as a passed hand you have alittle more scope to bid 2@S - but must surely be rock bottom for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: without hesitation ,  Shen returns a @D|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra2: yes esp. South |pg||

mb|4H|nt|andyv:  not sure what purpose 2@s served...in OR, S bid 3@d (puppet stayman) which makes more sense on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously playing 4-suit transfers it is easier to make mild slam try when partner does NOT like your suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i was wondering what Adam [Edgtton] was going to respond|pg||

nt|bobholl: now a chance :)|pg||
mb|5S|nt|tejjyid: I Was assuming 1@S..|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: south must bid 3NT|pg||
nt|panja: write Bob, they are..and a wide range system cannot do justice to all 11-12 pointers|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: south opened 2@h in the other room and is declarer in 4@h|pg||
nt|mwigor: (presumably this showed some 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i don't know their NT response ranges -- suspect 1@C-2@C requires 5+@C|pg||
nt|noodle:  maybe the bad grand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid shows Strong NT|pg||
nt|panja: now, after @CK and @C to King or Q, North must duck!|pg||
nt|panja: after @SK rather..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: 4th best lead form N-S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|tejjyid: I recall that 57% is the tipping point - it'd beclose to that|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|andyv:  cleverly avoiding the 5-4 @h fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry i meant 7@S :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: for most [many?] 2/1 players --  the 1@D response either denies 4+@H/@S or hand is strong enough to invite over a weak NT rebid|pg||
pc|s5|nt|noodle:  also note that south has has the 7@d for mosy hands  very important in junior bridge|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|an|strong|nt|nigel_k:  The usual tactic with a strong hand over a big club is to pass and bid later|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not sure if DBL was 4+@S or 4/5@S [which is how the Italians play it]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America, the standard is  1m-(1@H)-DBL = exactly 4@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the alert, I suspect 4/5|pg||

nt|rodal f: Did.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they alter range exclusively by seat  ---     marty bergen: vulnerability is for children|pg||
nt|noodle:  y all those players tell us vulnerability doesn t matter and stop playing :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: My best controled slam was bidded by 15HP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: harder for North to PASS after partner opens strong 1N|pg||
nt|noodle:  and we go -1100 :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I found that the weak NT solves lot's of bidding problems, but it gves away a lot of information when it ISN"T opened (player is unblanaced) plus it's hard to compete sensibly ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after people bid|pg||

nt|tejjyid: deficit down to 21|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: assumes 2N would be natural|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: said 2nt would surely show 18-19 or so|pg||

nt|tejjyid: my guess is this shows 11+ and @C|pg||
nt|noodle:  we name the XX under strenght "kindergarden"  here|pg||
nt|noodle:  like :  you won t make it  yes i will  :)|pg||
nt|gambit: of course N will drive to game, but what game, spades best|pg||

nt|panja: this will be good 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: NOrth can try 2NT or 3NT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: some might use it as Good/Bad  [so 3@C is better hand than 2N]|pg||
nt|noodle:  the method of using pass as 10+ balanced and transfers (starting with redouble) was suggested by Garozzo over a take out double and is gaining popularity|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pragmatic|pg||
nt|bobholl: good pass by N (south promised 4-6) or was it less than 5 ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  could be but then 3@c would be alertable|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I don't expect these two using good/bad|pg||
nt|andyv:  they at least got to game|pg||

mb|3D|nt|petergill: Shen's conservatism at the other table, I mean|pg||

nt|fifee: 9 tricks at 3nt with a @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: good valuein a trump lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@d looked like LR|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i double your claim -- in college systems were devised to make ME the opening leader|pg||

nt|panja: amazing EW players..very selfless...one must appreciate that...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mwigor: its a common mistake made that people hold up automatically - overlooking the possibility of another trick in the suit|pg||

nt|gambit: I Love Leb. Great convention. If a partner does not play it, I know they are not expert. Sad, but true. BRB|pg||
nt|panja: W opted for 6@C that E would have played...and E converted to 6Nt that W is playing|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|andyv:  for all we know 2@h could have been a help suit game try if 2@d was a limit raise or better.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tejjyid: now, let's set up @D..|pg||
nt|sybarra2: agree Cam |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and I play it every where|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunate game to go down|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: or (at least) intended to reveal that later|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tejjyid: I think South should lead low|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: actually that could be -- if 2@D absolutely shows @S support, then 2@H as a probe that may not have length does make sense|pg||
nt|sybarra2: yes but need partnership agreements for those|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: until further notice all contracts are 50%|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they either make   ....   or they don't|pg||
nt|fifee: for sure as with any transfer responses|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: with that combination, East may rise Ace to block suit when honours are split|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  to bad payoff isn't more than 8-9 imps|pg||
nt|noodle:  problem is now W overstates his values|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  but E has seen him play :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East seems to knowhow little West has|pg||
nt|noodle:  all by arrangement i d guess :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Wonder how West bids with a good hand?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: No|pg||
nt|bobholl: what would a direct 1NT have been ?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|noodle:  me too   but maybe he s a poor card holder and never has a good hand...|pg||
nt|gambit: You give up a potentially huge penalty for a part score? Not winning bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Hu didn't ask.|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but from N @D discard he knew|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: @DA asking for attitude is much more common now than when i learned to finesse|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Yes, I think NS in other romm probably feeling robbed as well|pg||
nt|panja: and now, cashing @DA...|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 down ?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tejjyid: if 3@D is systemically this weak, then IMO it shld be alerted|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: looks like it is a 2+C meaning for 1C opening|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tejjyid: OK, that confirms EW are playing 15-17, not 14-16|pg||
nt|gambit: not after this start|pg||
nt|fifee: if N doubles, then Patrick may pass|pg||
nt|othered1: many players around here play double of overcall of 1N at 3-level as negative, while double at 2-level is for penalty.  Not something I like to play.|pg||
nt|gambit: nice time for neg dble|pg||
nt|fifee: leb makes it easier at the 2 level|pg||
nt|bobholl: at least a 13-15 NT ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 2@S or 3@S?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: best lesson i learned at rubber bridge -- if you win $20  that calls for a $30 celebration|pg||

nt|tejjyid: now, if u'r not playing 2/1 this is an ugly buit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *bit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a space-filling 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2@C 100% game force, then 2N gets my vote|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+  but 4@C & 4@D usually opens 1@C|pg||
nt|panja: strong 1@C..|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4@H will not make though, I think|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt has better chances as the cards lay|pg||
nt|panja: all precision players...pass over 1@C first, and then late double...indicates opening strength at least..|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|tejjyid: definitely - thi sis the hand which justifies 2/1 (maybe)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as we see -- it let's partner clarify hand with 3@C|pg||
nt|lmeili: some players might bid 3@s instead of 2@s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  I might have bid 1@h first time with N hand just get away from this mess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, so now we can start cue-ing early, or maybe even BW with 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems now a couple cue bids then some form of Blackwood should get to slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: andrew types faster :(|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I dn't think BW is the right way to go|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess it makes as much or as little sense after a weak NT as after a stronger NT|pg||
nt|fifee: hard to play 3nt if you bid 4@D though|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tejjyid: THat seems likely to get a director call|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt might make because @C suit dies early..|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: apparently they use 1C=1+C and 1D=5+D, according to heather|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess EW don't have any agreements here regarding passing runout bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strange not to dbl -- i would assume Whibley's pass was forcing|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tejjyid: (but it's a long standing prejudice)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Liam's hand getting better|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 4@C was just natural force|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  it would seem so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: certainly if you can use it at the 4@C level, it's better|pg||
nt|gambit: 5d is a sound contrat |pg||
nt|panja: N is tempted to bid 3Nt??|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H with that North hand is not really justified|pg||
nt|bobholl: thin @C stop :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|panja: good decision by North..excellent restraint..|pg||
nt|panja: now..there might be a bit of tricky play here...@CAK and @C for a ruff..first thing..|pg||
nt|panja: but that will endplay West|pg||
pc|d8|nt|noodle:  2@D was probably GF checkback|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4@C as a natural force seems to be wasting space - why not cue 3@D on the way?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Again, West is making the decision and doesn't have enough information|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hopefully 5@C = 1/4 Key Cards|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugrapha2: pass is low-variance... opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: lead a @D!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: why would you disturb 2@D if you had correct information?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction screams @C lead so 3N doesn't appear to have a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ummmm screams @C lead|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: The @C QJ are invisble - they bid with filth & East has had no chance to show that he has a good hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tejjyid: it's a good start|pg||
pc|d6|nt|drewsky: Ill bet that 4@C was keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still not easy to take 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: The've got to the right contract, so success vindicates their method|pg||
nt|noodle:  always depends if it was a bidding mistake or a mistaken explanation|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: what does S discard that he can play back|pg||
nt|panja: interesting, should S ruff next Club or discard?|pg||
nt|panja: S can ruff small..|pg||
nt|panja: and then play A and back any suit..|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  and trump lead is called for|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Liam Milne -- 3rd player in the triad confirmed 4@C was NOT ace ask|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the best play for 4@D works  IN ISOLATION  but Milne doesn't know he has 2 entries to hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very niced unblock of @D9!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he will make 4@D without abandoning the entry to hand|pg||
nt|panja: @HT is the entry to cash its winner in Dummy|pg||
nt|panja: ruff higher than @H7 of course..|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: i.e.  what hand would want to punish 1@C but rest in 1@H undoubled|pg||
nt|panja: brilliant|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: this is a bad game but makes on good guessing|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lmeili: careless play|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lmeili: @sAK then @h or @d|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: duh -- he's a passed hand  thanks Mark|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it does, but I would call the director to find out|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gambit: now just a question of avoidance and W will never get the lead|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N isn't all that silly, as north must have sound high card values to force the 4-level.|pg||
nt|lmeili: can loose 2 @s 2@d and 1@h|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think even with a passed hand it's a force for one round (maybe up to 1NT)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still seems strange|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobholl: well done :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S normally 6@S but 5 allowed if "great suit"    you be the judge|pg||
nt|othered1: it looks like they've abandoned the classic Precision 2@D (tricolor, short @D)|pg||
nt|panja: if N had started with a 1Nt response, there was some chance of stopping in 3@H..I guess this will have be 4@H now..|pg||

pc|cK|nt|andyv:  I think 2N was relay to 3@c to get out|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should now bid 3N and answer the question (or redbl to show first round control)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: scramble 2NT is also sensible... south can't have values after two passes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but a reasonable sequence for 2N to show "2 places to play"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  should Nunn bid 4@C?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: again Mark beats me to the type|pg||
nt|panja: this will not be easy..|pg||

nt|rnmalik: and play of @D suit to come.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish and whibley are joking about the DQJ behind the screen before thelead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since only one entry to hand -- after @S lead must rely upon @D2-2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: mildly surprising to pick up in that way against a junior team|pg||
nt|gambit: It is  a crazy system when yoo open your singleton wth 44-14- |pg||
nt|othered1: some are even crazier, requiring no @D at all . . . |pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  S is lucky... lack of entries to his hand will prevent him from messing up the @d suit|pg||
nt|panja: with AQ and A, K in side suits....S should have opted to raise 3@H rather than bid 3Nt.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: NS carding upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|lmeili: in fact S has 2 choices either to guess right @h or to play @cA on side|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|panja: he is looking for entry to N hand..so @DA|pg||
pc|s7|nt|noodle:  nowadays many pairs use a jump to 4@c to show a big balanced raise and leave room|pg||
nt|mwigor: (interestingly?) all bloom's pickups have come when VUL - while milne's have been non-vul|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes juniors generally bid anything thAT moves|pg||
nt|mwigor: obviously vul is a factor when making decisions|pg||

nt|ahollan1: seems soft letting EW play 4@H|pg||
nt|noodle:  3@h p 4@h ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the double digit swings are going to MIlne, but the sngle digit swings are going to Bloom more frequently|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: The Milne team have gone for a smoke break|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@H-4@H OK, followed by X, 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scary|pg||
nt|sybarra2: per spec:    all the newer players are giving new material for books:))|pg||
nt|lmeili: wd! Patrick though not as our expected way|pg||
mb|2D!|an|Both Majors|nt|ahollan1: nice push|pg||
nt|mwigor: the juniors survived this troublesome interference - perhaps blasting 4 or 5@h would have worked better?|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|tejjyid: I do't know why NOrth doesn't open his weak 2@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: folowed by a low@C leadfrom East, and a long think...|pg||
mb|d!|an|Negative X|nt|noodle:  not the 1st 2@s over 2@h psych in the set. is it autralian standard ?|pg||
nt|mwigor: here the west hand didnt meet andy's requirements so he has the decision over what to do over partner's pre-empt when holding 5 card support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hand not quite good enough to bid 3@H  [@SQ worthless on the auction]|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  nothing under 5@h|pg||
nt|noodle:  hmm|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so when did CC start precision?  |pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to guess what S does (don't know what double can be )|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  3N |pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  he had a senior moment|pg||

nt|tejjyid: now that Norh has volunteerd a bid, South must be dreaming of 7|pg||
nt|noodle:  very surprised at E pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of this championship match is  32|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  i really believ in going past 4N on these hands  who knows it could go 5@s P P P + 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually that's 64th board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C was 2+   and i think 1@D was 4+@H  [i know it is without DBL]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D length is just a coincidence|pg||
nt|sybarra2: in the 50's or 60's?|pg||
nt|fifee: first that I saw it was 60s. |pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  W had his rebid ready|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no fear 3NT from North|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and by South's tank|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tejjyid: South suddenly feels his @SQ is not waste paper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious that Adam didn't open 2@D  -  is he TOO GOOD at this vul??|pg||
nt|tejjyid: must be - T 6th was enough 30 minutes ago|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 NT on a @D lead or switch ??|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: identical auction in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  again, not the type of hands the Noble team needs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  question here is how many overtricks|pg||
nt|gambit: CCmade Precsion mainstream |pg||
nt|sybarra2: 60's I think also|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mwigor: 7@h is a good save|pg||
nt|tejjyid: good cheap save for many imps|pg||
nt|mwigor: (double dummy this is the par contract)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: moment of truth|pg||
nt|noodle:  nice D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: rise the K, no-one switches from the Q here|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|fifee: Howard Schenken invented a strong club system in the early 60s before Wei precision became mainstream|pg||
nt|gambit: with Sontag, weichsel and  all those young players|pg||
nt|gambit: Indeed |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mwigor: -4 is -800 but 12 IMPs to Milne who will lead by 1|pg||
nt|noodle:  I think the 7 level is justified by possession of both red 7s  might get a free beer out of it|pg||
nt|bobholl: will make now if he doen't finesse @C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobholl: which red finesse to take ?|pg||
nt|panja: small @D to Q?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
nt|panja: in any case, you will get only 3 @D tricks..so might as well forgo the finesses|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobholl: but how to get to w ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: so this is best|pg||
nt|panja: and if the play @H after Clubs...you will make 8 tricks..|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this surely looks more like 2@D opener than  24|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yep|pg||
nt|tejjyid: great work|pg||
nt|bobholl: doesn't|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tejjyid: I thought the @D9 might say "@S J"|pg||
nt|lmeili: EW is the best female pairs in Taiwan, but they open light most of time|pg||
pc|h8|nt|noodle:  I see some specs remember their junior daYs|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East is on a different page|pg||
nt|othered1: And Schenken's Club was just a modification of Vanderbilt Club.  Neopolitan, and it's successor, Blue Team Club, also preceeded Precision |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|bobholl: well he did and will finesse @S for 2 down (may be :))|pg||
nt|bobholl: after taking 2@C may be even 3 down |pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: N does not know about @DT..so he has to keep all Diamonds|pg||

nt|panja: y|pg||

nt|sybarra2:  from a dear friend in specs:   i looked it up in the encyclopedia, in 1969 Taiwan (w P Huang) finished 2nde after Italy in the Bermuda Bowl using Precision|pg||
nt|othered1: And  the legendary Mr. Huang has had other major successes|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: nice action, 5 imps a board|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  I heard they were scoring on an abacus then, Andrew|pg||
nt|othered1: How many @S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@H 1@S 2@D 2@H and than ?|pg||
nt|panja: NS can make 4@H though..|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: remember there are 2 more 16-board sets remaining in the championship|pg||
nt|tejjyid: es, this is quitea small margin given the number of boardsleft|pg||
nt|ahollan1: take my word for it  ---  that is nice support for partner|pg||
nt|tejjyid: prima facie evidence that partner has psyched :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: IMo 1NT here does not promise a stopper|pg||
nt|fifee: Patrick is ranked 302 in the world. accomplishments can be found athttp://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=18230|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I thought we would hear 4 |pg||
nt|othered1: I think 3@S is the rational maximum.  Precision 1@C bids can be weak enough that it may be your hand and even 3@S can make partner misjudge, since a fit may not be needed to make ...|pg||
nt|othered1: game.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=18230|pg||
nt|panja: right..and after hearing the 1@S bid, N will be discouraged from bidding high|pg||
nt|bobholl: but if the k of @C is K of @S no chance so ...|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H makes because S has no wasted @S values|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tejjyid: sure, but we still had beer!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: blast into Ace Ask?   Splinter then Ask??   ART Game Force -- all make sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@s good contract for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ART Game Force Raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction is the one that used to have universal default where DBL=exactly 4@S   now it can be  4+@S, 4/5@S, less than 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and then you have pard who raises,...|pg||
nt|fifee: ty shirl|pg||
nt|lmeili: why not 1N?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or double|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lmeili: passed hand 1N shows another 2 unbid suits, most players do|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  true lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not on same page|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Can't balme SOuth for biding 5 with all that shape. North's three key cards must be looking pretty good to him|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3 small @H, maybe pd is void....|pg||
nt|noodle:  except 4@d is not slammish as a rule|pg||
nt|tejjyid: agreed; but he may talk himself into it|pg||
nt|noodle:  i m floored at 4333 yarborough 5 level bid red|pg||
nt|noodle:  might be a big winner here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very attacking bid|pg||
nt|noodle:  he had a junior moment :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: DOn't forget, North is probably feeling a bit sick about going down in 4@S on the misguess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still thinking?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N just shows Strong NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: flexibility is good, right?|pg||
nt|bobholl: w doesn't like to be robbed :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|tejjyid: interesting problem for North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been nice to hear about opener's singleton @H|pg||
nt|othered1: Note that Mr. Huang followed his silver medal in 1969 with another in 1970|pg||
nt|fifee: 5@C says I respect 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra2: Gong,  is thinking "I am out of this hand"|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I think 2@D understates the hand, but I admint @C K doesn't llok great|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for a quick coffee|pg||
nt|lmeili: Double may not show 5-5|pg||
nt|lmeili: but i will double|pg||
nt|bobholl: patrick will pass (iwould :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  aggressive opener by E made it easy to get to|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW make 6@D on finesse in @S and @D.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (odd 5@D bid)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S and 5@D are both a mystery to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Whibley thinking 3@C was less than game force.  That would explain 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: how about - 4@S = @C spport & @S Ace; 5@D = 3 @C ACes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 5@D ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could fit Andrew|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hope not - it was an effort to make that up, I wouldn't advocate playing it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and all the dreamers are talking about 6@s or 6@d... I'd be happy to get to game with the E hand:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: there's hope for noble in the other room, then|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is the type of hand that they can take a chance on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cashing at rubber bridge.:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  slam about 30-35%|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and they will know that time is runnin gout|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: the results in the other room have been more boring than here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: anyway, he does have a stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunately -- convention cards don't require explanation of how pairs play the sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: regarding the DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: yes, have to ask|pg||
nt|fifee: tap tap tap and declarer will lose control|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tejjyid: still, I think with 6 ard @D, you cna try 3@D here|pg||
nt|noodle:  after the pass maybe 3@d ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, you have limited your hand already over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh another guess --- 5@D is operator error and should be 5@H|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'll have to wait for the book|pg||
nt|panja: N should have have bid 3@H that early|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  usually when you have a large number to catch up, you have to decide that one pair will play the boards even and the other will do the swinging.|pg||
nt|noodle:  pard knows you re under 10H and you didn t open a @D prempt|pg||
nt|panja: what was the hurry?|pg||
nt|bobholl: he is better than me (that i knew already)|pg||
nt|panja: note that W's first pass, followed by a live auction double does indicate @S values..|pg||
nt|bobholl: true that makes it easier |pg||
nt|panja: but S could hold @SQJxxx and @H xx..|pg||
nt|panja: so the 3@H bid is a rather risky bid...|pg||
nt|bobholl: the 9 of @D migth have helped too although that didn't matter|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: just in from Liam    3@C is splinter in either minor, either weak or very strong|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Liam !!!|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess he respects it.  Of course, south has extra defense, enough that north couldn't double even though this is going down several|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tejjyid: imp-gaining lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: N could have passed, made E squirm a little..and taken a penalty if possible...|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is on the final board of the 2nd Quarter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Whibley will claim as soon as Nunn leads     we hope|pg||
nt|bobholl: in spite of @C lead still makeable 3 @D first|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tejjyid: with 7 HCP I hate to bid as if I have 0|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although in principle I'm for all conventions, they are time consuming|pg||
nt|bobholl: what good alternative did he have ? :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: easier to do that when you're at the table -- not so easy for us out in the ether|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, true, I was on a slightly different wavelength|pg||

nt|bobholl: there you are|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|noodle:  anyone for pass ?|pg||
nt|noodle:  4 jacks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think "vile" captures it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3rde set was wild again|pg||
nt|lmeili: E may say double now|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: This is Chinese Taipei Open Team Trial - Final - Segment 2 / 8|pg||
nt|lmeili: she does'nt like to deffense 3@c |pg||
mb|3S|nt|tejjyid: pass is fine|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this can go a lot down|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: winner of the event gets an invitation to and subsidy for the 2011 Yeh Bros event  |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... you may be right about percentage...i thought it would be a little higher because of lead, etc....but @ds do have to be 2-2 if you are dropping stiff Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  EW probably anxious now to get with teammates to compare|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they look relaxed|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s can still be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both North players bid 1N  --  i wish i knew wheter it was ostensibly Strong NT  or minors|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the names of teams are reversed originally, and nothing we can do |pg||
nt|sybarra2: next set sorted out |pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Open  room has finished , and we have 2 bds to go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And restart in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2.5 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: :)|pg||
nt|lmeili: brb|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Wu ask Hu "What's lead from AQ?" Ans:"A"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Oops he asks "AK"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Wu is looking at dummy seriously|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: I mean cards , not Patrick :P|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: they bid as ligth as meckwell but with less result :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobholl: although a @C lead migth help to prevent 2 down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: I think Hans-Nunn are the only pair underleading I've seen all weekend|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs still talking/asking about  14 from last set when pair for Milne went for 1700 [against partscore, i think]|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|andyv:  now only 3... dbl dummy, j@s had to be played|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sadly, the server crashed for that specific hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: at this point -- he'll be happy with 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tejjyid: almost certainly strong in this case|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|sybarra: we just called it an "operation" in our room |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|noodle:  my style for overcalls : good hand or good suit  doesn t cut it for me|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|tejjyid: looking at the hand record, it's a nonsense; the 5@H contract was in a 3-2 fit|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but I have no idea of what really happened|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: Hans-Nunn the only ones i've seen leading Rusinow [underleading] vs BOTH Suit & NT, but i've seen others use it in just one situation|pg||

mb|p|nt|lmeili: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: wlc Nigel Kearney and Phoebe Lin|pg||
nt|lmeili: E pass? expected 2N or 3C fromhim|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If it's just a standard weak two East has no reason to expect there is a better spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: an exciting start :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nigel_k:  It's pretty safe opening a weak two with a good five card suit non-vulnerable|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lmeili: 4@s cold, no less than 3 down will be good|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even with a 6-1 break West can get out for less than the opponents game|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||

nt|lmeili: other table maight be in @s slam|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If North had gone in with @dA and played another spade allowing South to discard a diamond maybe down 4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|nigel_k:  Declarer should probably have tried to avoid that by playing diamonds before touching trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then dummy's @h8 could be used to ruff the fourth round of spades|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|c6|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this 11 good enough for 1N?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK. I like it in all situations personally|pg||
nt|bobholl: N happy that he didn't give away the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: will reach and make 4@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mwigor: i think 2@s is stomach churning though|pg||
nt|noodle:  lol agrred|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra2: "precision" 1 @D just luck S has @D  |pg||
nt|bobholl: did i say reach 4@S ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: weak two or "muiderberg"?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good-o   i was hoping to see another 1@C opening|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I prefer my bad bids to take up lots of the opponents space|pg||
nt|noodle:  i strongly dislike 5332 preempts|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it really is is a poor 11|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tejjyid: best not to over use them, I agree|pg||
nt|noodle:  they have worked badly for my pards (I don t use them)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S much better than 5@C but will go down too|pg||
nt|bobholl: trump lead against doubled partscore|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sniggering all round at the auction|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be bot that effective this time 4@H and 1@D sure now|pg||
nt|bobholl: not (not bot)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  another no substance hand... Ish hoping his pass would attract some action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the specs -- Ish could NOT RDBL to show points   it would show 4+@D  [transfers over 1@C and 1@C-DBL]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: learn more about the hand with PASS|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not often this pair will be in a partscorewith 24|pg||
nt|othered1: Here, south has to take his life in his hands and rebid that suit, just to get his real suit exposed.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  but he could have bid 3N immediately|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and he probably wouldn't want to double to show points|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: Does anyone feel that you can have more success preempting ambiguous openings, like the Precision 1@D, than the big @C opening?  I do, and it applies to other ambiguous openings, ...|pg||
nt|othered1: like canape.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not 3 down on @C now migth even make :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: impressive stop|pg||
nt|fifee: or multi or tartan|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tejjyid: I plyed with a master of 4 card pre-empts, so I was always relieved when he had a 5 card suit|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  I agree with his pass at this stage of match... you need to try to create something... otherwise I'd just bid 3N and get it over before opps can communicate.|pg||
nt|mwigor: edgtton also overcalled 1@s in the other room (on 14)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ritong: excellent auction|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: I think it's probably modern standard|pg||
nt|ritong: they should be allowed to score +131|pg||
nt|othered1: against multi, usually a weak bid, there are different considerations and adages like not preempting over preempts may take precedence|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice investigation and stop by EW|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobholl: also 3 down i guess|pg||
mc|5|nt|fifee: the strength of using multi is to allow weak 2 suiter opening bids|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: ish often plays such head games|pg||
nt|othered1: Over apreempt, I think you need the jump bids yourself to define your hand, since the preempt, even a multi 2@D, has taken room away from you.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: we thank you CM  great job |pg||

mb|3N|nt|andyv:  ty Mark for a wonderful job on vugraph|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: andy that's a terrible pun|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and thx to Par, Ed and Henri @H |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and to the specs, with your great comments |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I need better wages to hire better writers, Mark|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think this 1@S might be @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: totally illegal, but tons of fun -- in a very casual dup game, we played one system if i was dealer, another if partner dealt  and opponent's card if they dealt|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: that is lots of fun - shame that fee-for-al aproach can't be sustained in high level games|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  another oz spade ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i brought that up because  Whibley's 1@C gets alerted byt Edgtton's didn't :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: My pleasure.  Nice not to have to debate recommendations to bid every time it's your turn :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tejjyid: *free-for-all|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H lead made |pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: 4@H can go off on @C lead,ruff  and small @D return.|pg||
nt|mwigor: no this one is systemic i think|pg||

nt|tejjyid: he needs a 9th trick even if the @C come home & "steal early"|pg||
nt|mwigor: this will be a disappointing result for the kids - martin may not play again if the match is close|pg||
nt|noodle:  and there is a case for finessing @c after take out double|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tejjyid: a BIG case|pg||
nt|bobholl: west must have both aces for his opening i would guess|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: most of Milne team was 2nd in 2010 NOT and Spring NOT  -- they're going to have to find new gear to break that streak|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HAns will make thesame 10 tricks - actually, maybe a differnet 10 tricks, but it will score the same way|pg||
nt|sybarra: they have another half to go,    |pg||
nt|sybarra: not over yet|pg||
