nt|roswolf: Hove is damp but otherwise back to the action|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Hanna|pg||
nt|panja: hi Hanna|pg||
nt|rmb1: starting out at paved patios between victorian terraces - it would spin from the off |pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w will reach 4@H here|pg||
nt|rmb1: With the @DA onside there should be no problem making 11|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/c play precision with a lot of relays i am reliably told|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: NS plays precision|pg||
nt|daman: Good morning everyone|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: they are chammpions  from Bejing and from Philly |pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hanna - Vladimir and specs.|pg||
nt|bobh1: hello everyone|pg||
nt|gambit: Welcome All, let's enjoy a wonderful match |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good evening all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hi all|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|xenya: the E hand is worth 1N|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gambit: hi Bob |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may hear a X from S |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: or??|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Cornelia,  welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|neobas: Hey all, welcome to some Israeli junior bridge|pg||
nt|roswolf: the first board is not the place for a psychic adventure|pg||
nt|rmb1: With the first pass being alerted (now withdrawn) I thought we were in for an exciting day|pg||
nt|bobh1: cam|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hi all |pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Cam:) Normaly not to comment this segment. Next I'm signed up.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Sr. Privat|pg||
nt|karesz: hi shirley may i join to you?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nigel_k:  4@h will just be showing a good raise to 4@s so North doesn't have enough to bid further|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Which is just as well since 10 tricks are the limit|pg||
nt|shevek: *I would prefer 4@h by East|pg||
nt|daman: NS will probably end up in 3NT or 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Morning George. Csaba and specs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|peachy: website http://www.bridzs.hu/verseny/20102011_orszagos_csapatbajnoksag_elodontok_donto_bronzmeccs   but it is in Hungarian|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: i missed the first board|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: sry|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will not be disappointed with the @cQ in dummy  |pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: i will claim the result|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi everyone from a rain sodden Manchester|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nothing new there, then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's an odd double |pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lovely name :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: asks for a heart lead, I guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it didnt do a lot of good |pg||
nt|yo_yo: here's one pic : http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=14233|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it was a good idea, just in case partner took it into his head to lead something else |pg||
pc|d9|nt|rmb1: Less likely to make 11 in 4@S (so much for predictions)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S as a final contract?|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the second 16-board stanza of 4 in the semi-final, finals tomorrow|pg||
nt|ady: good lay of the cards for 4@S|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|gambit: off-beat 1NT opening will work out OK |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome everyone|pg||
nt|neobas: I must admit I have heard of the NS players but not the EW players|pg||
nt|patricck: I believe 1NT is the best bid on the North hand, tho I know it is't to everyone's taste|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the other semi-fianl wasa 33-33 after 16 boards |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The problem is that 4@h could be far too much if partner has heart shortage|pg||
nt|shevek: 7-5 still....|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But with some heart support or good diamonds opposite the East hand is huge|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 5@h is only -1, if E can play @d the right way|pg||
nt|shevek: yes always 9 tricks in @h for EW, so even 5@h would be a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|lestergold: good afternoon Ed,Csaba and specs|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|lestergold: lead may be expensive but an unbid sui9t seems reqasonable|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: http://www.israbridge.com/home/results/2011/jun11-f.pdf  for standings after round 8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S leading by 10 miles|pg||
nt|Walddk4: E-W are young ladies|pg||
nt|neobas: I think it is fair to say the Israeli U21 and U26 teams have good chances of medals at every youth competition so we should see some good bridge here today|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobh1: not the best suit to attack, although he has induced declarer to misguess|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|shevek: always 2 losers in @d, one club and 1 heart|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rmb1: No there was a swing on the last board 38-33 to GAMAX|pg||
nt|lestergold: only lead to give contract|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: ah, sry|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You might start with @dQ, or more likely a low diamond from dummy then guess right on the next round|pg||
nt|lestergold: so often the case|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ruffing  @D IN DUMMY COSTS A TRUMP TRICK|pg||
nt|othered1: time for a change in plans|pg||
nt|lestergold: May try to do something with the spades now|pg||
nt|othered1: or just might try to elope with his trumps and a @D ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously does not want to give lead to west|pg||
nt|lestergold: so K@s run jack|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: this was a real auction - sacre bleu!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gambit: oh|pg||
nt|lestergold: or can actually run J without K|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobh1: lol|pg||
nt|othered1: how about @D to ace, @S to K @D ruff, @SA, @S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think all lines will work now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did not listen u Mike. Hi specs - Ed and Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: hiRodal|pg||
nt|lestergold: east is considering whether to duck but i dont think it helps|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi also to the exselent vug operator Csaba|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: in a way west was endplayed on opening lead all leads help declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer has found the winning (and safest, I think) line, ignoring early @D play.|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably trump was least helpful|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If E bids 4@h on the first round he can follow up with 5@d......|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It would depend who you think has short @d|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|gambit: the precious 9 spot|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: didn't have a lot of options and chose to be aggressive|pg||
nt|karesz: yesterday my team lost to Gamax, so i wish Gamax won|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|neobas: Declarer had 3@S 1@H and 3@C so needs three ruffs|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|patricck: shouldn't be a problem|pg||
nt|chick: should do the @S first, then don't have to guess how high to ruff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rmb1: Declarer will be feeling more comfortable now he has found both kings|pg||
nt|gambit: sounds like a good sport |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra2: might be making too many?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|ady: all plain sailing now   can try for an overtrick  playing for qJ hearts onside|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|neobas: Well done not playing the @CK|pg||
nt|lestergold: not unreasonable 4th best from a 5 Crd suit |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|d8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|patricck: after ruffing West needs to play a trump just to hold it to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|neobas: Which Fisher needs to take in hand|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|neobas: Oh nvm|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: declarer has taken a safe route to a guaranteed 10 tricks|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|beno b: the strength is OK|pg||
nt|beno b: but singl A plays betetr in suit contracts|pg||
nt|beno b: singl k or Q may rather qualify, I think|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 1NT opening does not exclude suit contracts :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: i personally have had better experiences opening 1N with stiff Ks rather than stiff As|pg||

nt|vugraphzyj: N signaled with the 9@s... and gave a trick away...|pg||
nt|sybarra: that hand may get some discussion .....|pg||
nt|rmb1: so we are in for an exciting day!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have been doing bbo commentary for a long time and that was truly unbelievable|pg||
nt|xenya: action here|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps|pg||
nt|rodal f: A bit more interesting board.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Csaba|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the first board of the 4th segment|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but South could have reopened with 2@d - or even 2@h|pg||
nt|peachy: 49 was...|pg||
nt|shevek: good point Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N is probably short in @d|pg||
nt|bobh1: so they played ping pong in the @H suit|pg||
nt|karesz: every single point counts|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvx: im ready with the names :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: here EW might go go overboard but perhaps they will stay in a good 3NT contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the recap |pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C strong artificial (I guess)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Csaba, so not Hanna:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer dbl as S. not 1@s|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@s is the correct bid by south|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1@s for me too|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: nothing much here    |pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: no :)|pg||
nt|daman: EW should reach the @H game      NShave a useful vulnerable sacrifice|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards l;ie 10 tricks look available to n/s in spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will NS find there best contract?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not likely to be bid tho|pg||
mb|2S|nt|april7: 6@C is a possible contrACT|pg||
nt|peachy: Looks like EW play prevision|pg||
nt|shevek: the idea is "don't double if you don't want partner to leave it in sometimes"|pg||
nt|lestergold: routine 4@h e/w not the right colours for save in 4¬s|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 6@C is a lucky contract, but not 6@D|pg||
nt|ady: need to stop around 1NT|pg||
nt|peachy: precision|pg||
nt|lestergold: they qwill find their best denomination|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed think west should pass here|pg||
nt|neobas: I don't like the 3NT rebid tbh|pg||
nt|neobas: I usually play it as solid diamonds and a bit too much to open a Gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: no W is thinking about a 6 @C contract and will have the luck to make it if he decides to do it|pg||
nt|neobas: Anyone for 3@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4@C may be ok provided they could stop in 4NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is North worth a positive (if 1@c is strong)?|pg||
nt|ady: west may compete|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not easy to find a @D lead from W if 5@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West has chosen to show a limit raise which is about right I think|pg||
mb|d|nt|patricck: 3@D is the more normal rebid...  I don't think 3NT is such an ugly choice tho|pg||
nt|rmb1: I can't find convention cards on line: I think this is a picture of East http://www.bridzs.hu/node/184/52|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is sane so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: AH AH|pg||
nt|neobas: "My @C are more solid than your @D"|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a major cue?|pg||
nt|neobas: :)|pg||
nt|april7: now 4 @D and then 6@C perhaps|pg||
nt|gambit: great lead for the def|pg||
nt|bobh1: he knows his pd has support for @Ss|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@S=@S+a color Csaba?|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has tp guess wjhich 3 card suiot to take out into|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|roswolf: 1nt?|pg||
nt|xenya: even 4@S goes down here on an inspired @D lead...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not on a 3-suiter. We can miss all possible fits|pg||
nt|daman: 4@S is only -1|pg||
nt|gambit: 3H was pass or correct |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Signaling Rule  2:  Never signal with a trick.|pg||
nt|shevek: east bid 3NT dutyfully|pg||
nt|daman: makes with @Ss 2-2|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: now e/w should get to 6@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: and   1 is?|pg||
nt|panja: 1@S pass might be the best spot...|pg||
nt|roswolf: we shall see|pg||
nt|panja: would have been difficult to make 7 tricks in 1Nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks like a normal pass for South now|pg||
nt|ady: cam ,ake 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: might weven make but at these colours they tend not to be bid|pg||
nt|gambit: finesse, spades, next hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Another auction you do not see that often (with opener passing 1S)|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the other match, 1@C was an little as an ordinary 16, so North is probably not worth a positive|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Easyer if E doubble|pg||
nt|xenya: now... -- no, almost impossible to find...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: Lakatos is thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: wisely passed decision back|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: must avoid 6NT|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C can be beaten on a @H lead as long as when the Q@S is run on the first round of the suit South ducks|pg||
nt|april7: W should ofcourse pull trumps before giving up a @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would be tough i think|pg||
nt|april7: 6NT possible except on @H lead,but S will lead @H ofcourse|pg||
nt|patricck: sorry, stupid of me, diamonds don't need to be set up in clubs|pg||
nt|chick: Signaling Rule  1:  Every card is a signal (whether you mean it or not)|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I take it back, I really dont know|pg||
nt|chick: prevision is good too :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: if opps dont attack clubs in time....|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: you come across lots of new things on BBO|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 1@d-1@S=GF is sure new to a lot of us|pg||
nt|rodal f: Dont some said.|pg||
nt|lestergold: this should not make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Well. @H10 give a signal. Might it'll come|pg||
nt|xenya: great!|pg||
nt|daman: it was up to South over 1NT   if he passes they never get in|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Yes. Well done|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|april7: well done!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm that was cool|pg||
nt|neobas: NS will dislike the lucky slam this early|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: yes they will feel luck isnt with them|pg||
nt|rodal f: Stolen and needed for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u if west can read the cards he may fijnd a way of only losing 2 clubs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: new to me, yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: 4@S seems flat so non vul....    Even -3 at 3@D if not 4@S bidded|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT by E shouldn't be with a singleton @C from W's point of view ofcourse|pg||
nt|roswolf: possibly|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: kinda depends on what 1@D means|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably 13 cards, some of them high ones |pg||
nt|peachy: kib says 'short diamonds, may have both majors'|pg||
nt|chick: cute :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: EW plays precision|pg||
nt|sundiszno: hi all from the site|pg||
nt|peachy: He said already earlier, but I remember from earlier sessions (IFRC) that EW played precision|pg||
nt|peachy: ohm there it is, thanks Csaba|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Magyar|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra2: oh dear way too many|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and who comes in with that scrappy spade suit and a mere ace and king|pg||
nt|bobh1: he did save a trick by not trying the @d hook|pg||
nt|gambit: and more|pg||
nt|gambit: squeezing the dummy |pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: defence on the ball i think|pg||
nt|panja: difficult part will come up after cashing @DJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North might have unblocked there|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk5: Welcome Jordan|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: weclome Jordan,  good to see you agian |pg||
nt|sybarra2: will be a bit messy|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Jordan :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: or is it -3 either way?|pg||
nt|bobh1: E may be wondering why he didn't hook a @D|pg||
nt|bobh1: and conclude he lacks the Q|pg||
nt|gambit: J perhaps |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|patricck: the slam isn't THAT lucky..... needs either a 3-3 trump beak or a 4-2 trump break with K@S onside|pg||
nt|jcwla: You too Shirley and Cornelia, happy new year to all.|pg||
nt|sundiszno: EW's system card, in hungarian|pg||

mb|2S|nt|ady: south balance with suitable shape   only 8 hcp   but passed in first seat|pg||

nt|gambit: cheapest control? |pg||

nt|yo_yo: I agree with your sentiments George|pg||
nt|gambit: @C by N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: weak NT and stayman|pg||

nt|xenya: hello Hasan|pg||
nt|xenya: what about 3N? |pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Kath|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: looks like S downgraded his hand...10 with 4333..|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah that explains the bidding which is remarkably sane|pg||
nt|xenya: again, good lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: The same help @DKX as needed in 6@D, but need to find @HQXXX in 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: not me|pg||
nt|bobh1: well they avoided a trap i think|pg||
nt|gambit: nicely done by NS|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: needed a club lead and heart return|pg||
nt|bobh1: not sure why, but they did|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this should work |pg||
nt|lestergold: it was bid scientifically|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: i cant wait to see the next e/w effort!?:(:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Q was the right play, to guarantee entry to hearts, which on rare occ could break 5-0|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzyj: IMPS |pg||
nt|lestergold: not likely to produce a swing this hand|pg||
nt|daman: it remains to be seen if the same auction happens in the OR|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but they right sided the contract |pg||
nt|daman: yes   landed on their feet|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not that it matters on this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant fail on any reasonabole auction all roads lead to 3N|pg||
nt|karesz: so @h as trump they play 4 @s RKC|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra2: only a club loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: if there is a dim fit and  small doubleton spade u might prefer to be in 3N|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panja: this will just make I guess..it needs backward @H finesse to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmmph-  wanton waste of the @D7|pg||
nt|shevek: and on @d lead you know who has the ace :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: east will always seek a diamond guard from west and west will be the no trumper|pg||
nt|karesz: a transfer and a natural gameforcing bid...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: otherwise losing 2 @S if K is singleton with W|pg||
nt|panja: strictly...pinning @HT...rather than backward finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: would be cool play though|pg||
pc|c8|nt|neobas: NS were actually on the Israel U26 squad that took the gold medal in Philadelphia last October|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|famus: this lead wud be a killer--as long as W unblocks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|panja: @D4 on last trick was a bad play..and @D continuation here is worse|pg||
nt|peachy: due to good spadespots + Q, declarer can go after the overtrick without jepardizing contract|pg||
pc|s5|nt|famus: didnt come to that|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|karesz: he can make with 4-1 @s, if club is working|pg||
nt|sybarra2: can we have commentators claim?|pg||
nt|karesz: :):)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: if S plays a small @D from hand, E should throw th 8, giving declarer a losing choice -- play for 108 in the E hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|c4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|rmb1: I don't think there will be a late enty to dummy to cash @D7 at the end :)|pg||

mb|4H|nt|patricck: you would want to play 3NT here...a ot of work to make 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not have been my choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: and 3@C probably denies a fit|pg||
nt|panja: good scheme|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is East worth one try?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one would think so - but maybe 4@C would be natural|pg||
nt|shevek: dbl = tko of @h|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult rebid for east so chooses to defend|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Difficult/dangerous/fearless for South to bid 10xxxxx at the 3-level VUL|pg||
nt|peachy: good guess Kath :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it also depends on what 2NT-4@h means. This sequence may suggest slam-try vlaues  |pg||
nt|shevek: very gutsy...|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|april7: if 2@D is nonforcing; S should cue the @C|pg||
nt|peachy: Breathtaking bravery vulnerable|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looks like Dumbovich has converted a plus score to a minus|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Those kind of doubles are dangerous because RHO might redouble and you don't have much defence|pg||
nt|shevek: vulnerable too....|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Especially when you're not even sure a diamond lead will be best|pg||
pc|s9|nt|panja: the thought itself is dangerous|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: I used to play a direct raise to 4@S after 2NT was this kind of hand  but  the west hand would not have gone any further |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe W didn't double because his partner opened in third seat, potentially dogpoo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting turn of phrase... |pg||
pc|s4|nt|shevek: declarer can pitch a @s on the 4th club|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: declarer must play on @s and not @c finess to make (discard a @c on 4th @s)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Why did S want to be in? @C from N would been best|pg||
nt|daman: on this side of the pond the East hand would be opened with Flannery 50% of the time    a very popular convention here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rmb1: There is room to play this sequence, or 4 level transfer, or direct 4@S as a mild slam try|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we are struggling with south's name, we cant abbreviate it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rmb1: Less so if partner can flash @HAKx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree with West, though. Why double opposite a third-hand opener and possibly struggle to get 200? Not worth it   |pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: Spell it "south" :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Or a club on the fourth spade :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra2: and another claim coming up|pg||
nt|karesz: do U want to claim again Shirley?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|patricck: I guess it depends how fast and loose you play the 1 level overcall...  |pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says "not supporting with North is ridiculous" i agree|pg||
nt|april7: but  still forcing or not,that is the question!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but you must bid the full value of your hand|pg||
nt|neobas: I like to play it as nf, can always cuebid with good hands|pg||
nt|april7: so, cue!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|patricck: The 6@C slam was worth 10 Imps to team 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful to have a distinction between 2NT-3@h (xfer)-3@s-4@s and 2NT-4@h-4@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's against our principals to let them play at the one -level but what else?|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont mention it in front of Roland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or terrence Reese|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did he not say  the worst convention ever?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: some good suggestions from the kibbs :)|pg||

nt|yo_yo: why is it so popular?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here we like multi |pg||
nt|yo_yo: or weak 2|pg||
nt|daman: Zia/Hamman among mant top level pairs play Flannery|pg||
nt|lestergold: it handles an important majo suit combo when hand is n ot goodm enuf for reverse|pg||
nt|daman: Levin/Weinstein     Stansby/Martel etc etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: my son approves of it but sh... dont tell roland...|pg||

nt|panja: y, that 1@S was a very good spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: the standard of cardplay is below the usual high hungarian standard|pg||
nt|rmb1: partscore? 3@H= by EW (who knows :))|pg||
nt|ady: another possible slam|pg||
nt|famus: :) well--no further comments on riding Frank--lest we venture into imaginary visions|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: on 34, EW were allowed to play 5@H in the other room -- down one doubled and 5 imps to GAMAX|pg||
nt|shevek: because he led a trump!|pg||
nt|daman: it seems to work for them|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mdgraham: +710 is the sort of result that you are slightly worried about|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  17 EW took the money in 3@DX -2 (we do not have the auction) for 2IMP|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C    on aclub finesse|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nigel_k:  Spectators correctly pointing out that playing on spades not clubs would make it easier to avoid this kind of problem|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I was ready |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lestergold: as i said 5@h and 4@s can be an awkward shape to get accross without it|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|patricck: Yes, IMP pairs, not teams as I was thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: the text books will tell you to land in 4 @H here|pg||
nt|panja: could be a good bidding competition|pg||
nt|rmb1: XX 3 card raise|pg||
nt|panja: with the support redouble..W should feel safe up to 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: rdbl = support showing 3@H?|pg||
nt|famus: will end up in 3@hs max i wud assume|pg||
mb|4H|nt|april7: aggressive opening!!|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@D 3@H 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: now will @S make?|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@H raise must be very weak -- hence the alert and N's pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: NOW THE LAW DECISION?|pg||
nt|panja: will 3@S make rather..?|pg||
nt|chick: a club lead won't help much, they need to find the spade sac|pg||
nt|shevek: east should pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: true in modern style and with junior elan|pg||
nt|patricck: A couple of nice 10's but no Aces and only 1 King i would have chosen to pass|pg||
nt|april7: going down on @D lead and S from N|pg||
nt|sybarra: Yotam,  this table being compared with Table 1 right |pg||
nt|roswolf: play may be tricky|pg||
nt|peachy: as we are not getting comparisons, you can spy on the other table via this link, watch both tables simultanously                                http://www.bridge...|pg||

nt|sybarra2: at table not as easy as it is for us |pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: not other table|pg||
nt|chick: E is being timid, but I think I'd bid 4@H ... double then cuebid normally shows about 20 pts|pg||
nt|rmb1: and a bit more work if clubs 4-0|pg||
nt|ady: some open the east hand   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: North deciding discretion is the better part of valour - can they find their 5/5 spade fit? |pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|daman: missed slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like off|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade ruff and three losers|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: south offerring an alternative|pg||
nt|rmb1: as long as 3@D isn't invitational|pg||
nt|roswolf: north should pass although he may still have a decision over 3@H|pg||
nt|panja: now was the 3@D bid an invitation of some kind or just a preference to @D?|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhie back at the ranch 6@s or clubs missed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: impossible to bid the grand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yo_yo: redouble, does it mean happy to play in 2@C xx?|pg||
nt|chick: apparently not|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: i couldnt hear it|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: I play it as pref as does n/s|pg||
nt|panja: right, as it should be...|pg||
nt|rmb1: routine :)|pg||
nt|daman: winkler surely could have afoorded 3@C|pg||
nt|karesz: 1 Nt+ earns 2 IMPs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: 3@H*|pg||
nt|panja: because 3@H was an option for invitation as Andras(kib) points out..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and why not 3@s from S?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think South has nothing extra after the double|pg||
nt|shevek: because they are vul?|pg||
nt|lestergold: clubs of course better as can make on 4/1 spade break|pg||
pc|hT|nt|april7: 2 down on best defence|pg||
nt|ady: leaders may lose  ground here|pg||
nt|famus: no help in @cs--a little in @ds--did that what all of these neant--wonder|pg||
pc|h3|nt|famus: meant|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D ask for hold I belive. |pg||
nt|sybarra2: wouldnt we all like to know what we do as commentators and specs?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s have performed very solidly thus far - no doubt now the commentators curse will strike|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW have only an eight card fit but maybe do not know about the dounble fit in @C which makes 3@H more attractive|pg||
nt|xenya: accurate prediction, Hasan|pg||
nt|lestergold: signalling in trumps to make sure he gets that ruff|pg||
nt|karesz: why 6?|pg||
nt|karesz: i prfer 7!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|panja: well..East opened 1@D..|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point robin|pg||

nt|karesz: e|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|panja: sorry..1@C|pg||
nt|famus: a @d ruff ought to see this home|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 makes no odds as pard will see 2 now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcwla: Well, I think the value shown by that sequence changes when pd has shown 9-11 or so as here, have to be able to search for best game.|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on the same finesse as 6@C  on the spade lead|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|daman: they bid like this at the club on a lazy Tuesday afternoon|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: probably phoney|pg||
nt|panja: East opened 1@C...and it is supposed to be natural...|pg||
nt|rmb1: But 1@C only shows four in the sleepy back-waters of Acolland (e.g. Devon and Sussex)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i suppose the low spade aks for higher ranking upside down signal|pg||

nt|rmb1: Another slam.  Surely right to bid this one|pg||
nt|ady: another slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: certainly swing potential in the last two boards|pg||

nt|lestergold: boring 3n here|pg||
nt|daman: don't we think East would have become quite enthusiastic had west bid a routine 3@C?|pg||
nt|gambit: Like "Declarer could try a non-working squeeze." |pg||
nt|bobh1: continuing in the partscore skirmish vein|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sr. Got a telephone. Back.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|peachy: Six controls is a bit of an overload for a 11-15 opening|pg||

mb|1S|nt|chick: Jordan, what would you play the 3@DX to mean if you were South?|pg||

nt|shevek: 1|pg||
nt|shevek: it was honest I thought|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: this one secure   just a heart loser if cashed|pg||
nt|famus: chance for oystan -if they can hit 5@cs and manage it|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|famus: Roysston|pg||
nt|shevek: they lead 3/5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is this correct bidding?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: depends what it shows,  does it promise a suit or is it a trial bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: would we know too if our partners bid it|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW have the high cards but no fit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|daman: it would typically be a suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator last contract 1 off surely?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: because of ruffingvalue in @D!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: anothe flippant although "system"bid|pg||
nt|april7: look at that!!|pg||
nt|neobas: I recently started playing 2@H as both Majors and I must say I really do like it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks eminently biddable. Highly likely that Blackwood will appear at some point |pg||
nt|xenya: may be not so easy to locate the @C fit|pg||
nt|famus: 2@cs wud /shud excite N|pg||
nt|xenya: easy enough :)|pg||
nt|famus: might splinter in @hs|pg||
nt|xenya: or pass|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s, really Csaba?|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: A or K|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might not be a pleasant spot|pg||
nt|shevek: so 5@d played by south?|pg||
nt|bobh1: NS have a fit but it is in the suit E opened|pg||
nt|gambit: "After all, E/W have a clear majority of the points (21)" |pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe board?|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant be beat|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|panja: trump lead should be the norm here..|pg||
nt|rmb1: Previous stanza (different team) 1NT=12-16, 2@C GF relay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North could simply ask for aces over the 1NT opening, whatever their methods are for that |pg||
nt|ady: north hand seems right for a direct ace asking bid and then appropriate level in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: ok|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: great pass by North, but it didnt help much that E wusely upgraded, they have better contract available as we all see, tough at the table|pg||
pc|s5|nt|patricck: NS can make 4@S with the A@C onside and the Q@S probably being picked up, but it was never very likely they could bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: as north i would have thought i must invite here -any idea about the range of 2@H?|pg||
nt|neobas: 6-10 probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok then not to invite|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps not the best choice, 2@D|pg||
nt|famus: very conservative|pg||
nt|daman: or at least looking for help in the suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so you cant make a 3 card trial bid?|pg||
nt|daman: sure|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sorry for a bit late and hi to all specs + Kath - George and Mike|pg||
nt|daman: and that's OK too|pg||
nt|bobh1: its 23 Edgar|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 tricks next case please|pg||
nt|karesz: at least 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: assuming 3@H is showing a stopper, 4@C looks right for S|pg||
nt|chick: these are juniors, anyone want to bet on 3N?  :):)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am betting on 6 @D |pg||
nt|jcwla: If I had one bid for my life as S it would be 6@C.|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 6 @C |pg||
nt|chick: all the kibs are voting for 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, NS have presumably paid their entry fee, so they will want to make as many bids as possible|pg||
nt|rmb1: More IMPs back to Dumbovich on  18: 4@H-1 by NS 6IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: agree Mike   this auction should be around 4 bids|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: the attitude signal (reverse I am told) wont help south much here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes indeed - 4@d was just right |pg||
nt|yo_yo: great bid by south puts the cat amongst the pigeons|pg||
nt|lestergold: 10 sorry|pg||
nt|daman: so  if West bid 3@C     what would have bid as East?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi there, still dont know how old you are!|pg||
nt|gambit: but the quote was 21  Tobias |pg||
nt|karesz: heart to the 8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|neobas: I don't think I know any juniors who don't play weak 2 openings haha|pg||
nt|sybarra: will we hear 6 '@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 6 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just 5 @D.... |pg||
nt|sybarra: my bet is on 6 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 5 @S as suggested by a spec |pg||
nt|jcwla: It is hard to imagine N not going on - a jump like this, right or wrong, should show this type of hand - including worry about @S that N knows is no problemo.|pg||
nt|chick: I think 5@D, N is still not sure how good S's clubs are|pg||
nt|sybarra: more I think about it 5 @S is right |pg||
nt|jcwla: And primo @C's.|pg||
nt|jcwla: N may fear that has shown better @C than actually has but that ship has sailed.|pg||
nt|sybarra: N should know 6 level is ok,   dont you think?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Totally.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm - this seems to be over-complicating things|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|panja: not the best lead..but a daring good continuation|pg||
nt|roswolf: good switch though|pg||
nt|daman: Hi|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rmb1: Hope South recognises this is the end of the auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This hand is ideal for one of Roland's unfavourite conventions|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rmb1: In open room, NS bid to 3NT on  3 but only -1 for flat.  On  4, NS got in to the auction and reached 4@H-1 for 5IMP (out)|pg||
nt|famus: 3@hs in my opinion wud be more interesting|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: so 5 @S should be safe cue|pg||
nt|rodal f: N with a bit to good @C by J10XXX, this time?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jcwla: WD - this is an art not a science so I think they deserve full marks.|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  but did "we" miss 7?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: we better change the name!|pg||
nt|peachy: As long as N doesn't play a heart now, doesn|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@D looks attractive|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: one disadvantage is it might cut down game investigation|pg||
nt|sybarra: and would you want to be there?|pg||

nt|ady: north showing a heart fit and shortage  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double improves South's @DK|pg||
nt|rmb1: Now 4@D retransfer :)|pg||
nt|ady: certain to bid game I would think|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1N=2D=3D=4D=4H is always a test of partnership understanding|pg||
nt|bobh1: I imagine 2@C is Gazzilli|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I would sooner 1@H , those @S are four, not five.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is practical|pg||
nt|famus: 4@cs has set the suit--there u go|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: it was orkc|pg||
nt|shevek: leaping michaels|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  World's weakest ever leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|lestergold: i feel 2n coming on and 2 off|pg||
nt|daman: a @H lead would be inspired|pg||
nt|lestergold: not difficult to lay down A@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: so its ok!|pg||
nt|jcwla: But with @H 4-4 no problem.|pg||
nt|panja: a 2-suiter overcall might have made this too complicated....simple 1@S was far more effective|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Winkler has to lead one and Geller wont go up with A or K|pg||
nt|gambit: I sure hope 3@C is forcing|pg||
nt|bobh1: even if not N will not pass it|pg||
nt|bobh1: he has a huge hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: another good auction by n/s|pg||
nt|famus: 4@hs 03|pg||
nt|gambit: Is Gazilli related to Garrozo?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: is 3 enough?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Good lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: agreed prakash|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if nmaybe only 1 off now if west c ashes out|pg||
nt|sybarra2: apparently|pg||
nt|karesz: i think 2 @c was natural|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|panja: y, brb|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|neobas: I don't see why Fisher didn't bid 1@H|pg||
nt|neobas: North might still have 4@H?|pg||
nt|bobh1: if 2@c was natural it was the underbid of the century|pg||
nt|sybarra2: over 1 nt forcing.... 2 @C could be only 3 clubs right?|pg||
nt|karesz: yes|pg||
nt|bobh1: only 2@Cs if 4522|pg||
nt|gambit: trump lead?|pg||
nt|karesz: it was underbid, so came 6 @c to show the power!!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra2: does it really matter?  except for style pts?|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'd like to know whether 2@Cs was really natural...i doubt it|pg||
nt|gambit: What does 2@C Gazzili show?|pg||
nt|lestergold: I regret that I must leave now too muuch happening here sorry.... bye for now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rmb1: play should be quick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not likely to want to play in 4@d having been doubled in 3@d|pg||
nt|famus: well bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: or will he try another spade i dont think it will work|pg||
nt|karesz: with 3rd K @s onside 13 tricks are easy|pg||
nt|bobh1: depends on how you play it but it is forcing and artificial (sometimes)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rmb1: On  19, North lead @HK against 3S, +1. 1IMP to Dumbovich|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|shevek: I like 4@c, I don't like 5@h much, but works here....|pg||
nt|lestergold: north might know what to do now|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: upside down attitude?  2@H?|pg||
nt|bobh1: shows either a normal 2@c rebid or some stronger hand|pg||
nt|sybarra2: frankly it is just pesky that clubs are 3/1 |pg||
pc|c3|nt|april7: I think he shouldn't, in my system:)|pg||
nt|neobas: Why?|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe 2@H|pg||
nt|famus: this orkc i came across playing with a hungarian frnd of mine on BBO:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|neobas: Though the shape and honour cards aren't that great|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|april7: I have a convention for it,2NT shows 4@H and longer other minor|pg||

nt|lestergold: er i think that looks encouraging....|pg||

nt|bobh1: 4@c gerber|pg||
nt|gambit: 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Do you force to game or invite?|pg||

nt|famus: 5@cs penalty-wud result in 5@hx--looks like|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H by South?|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|rodal f: With a OK sac in @C EW, but...|pg||

nt|shevek: I like south's overcall|pg||

pc|h2|nt|roswolf: might play in 4@H|pg||
nt|patricck: KaplanRuben hand evaluator thinks the west hand is worth 17.95. Despite the lack of filling 10's and 9's I thought 1NT might not be enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North needs a ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: S.J.Simon says "when in doubt, bid one more".  NS should have listened. Or else, they have No Doubt and happy to defend 4S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North is happy to defend but he has to beat it|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: don't think he can do that|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: 5@D will most probably go down on this distribution|pg||
nt|roswolf: I wonder how strong east's bidding is !?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Once pd shows four, wild horses couldn't keep me out.  Might not make but we will never know during the auction and for one extra trick we get 300 extra points.|pg||
nt|chick: switch the @HKQ with the @DAJ and it's not nearly as good a contract|pg||

nt|april7: 2aces with W are enough for E, ace of @H better then ace of @C ofcourse!!|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Maybe if I'd bid @C's, you'd have led a @D."|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here is the famous death hand for forcing 1NT where the textbook W rebid is 2@C.|pg||
nt|roswolf: more distributional freakettes|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: they are speaking about 3nt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: agree Raija but you need an understanding partner |pg||
nt|mdgraham: at the vulnerability, tempting. Not for me personally though  |pg||
nt|chick: the problem of course is that it also doesn't give your partner a roadmap to the right contract|pg||
nt|peachy: Ogust helps to sort it all out|pg||
nt|shevek: this one unlikely to be a plus though|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: Szots asked why not 2nt for 2@c|pg||
nt|shevek: good question :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: rather a lotm of hands where a rock crusher faces a pile of garbage|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: bidding tests everywhere|pg||
nt|sybarra2: LOL|pg||
nt|gambit: 4@H looks normal |pg||
nt|karesz: Nikolits have won the forst spade in the 3 Nt...|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|patricck: 6NT by West gets all the marks in Bidding Challenge, but any resonable slam will do here|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: The israeli Bridge Festival will be held in Tel-Aviv on 10-19 to February.. you are all invited to take a look at the  web site:  |pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: www.ibf-festival.org|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H should be the eventual destination|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H makes e/W  |pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@S preempt was quite effective on that hand|pg||
nt|karesz: first|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: flannery!?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@D is 45xx or 4414 or 4405 11-15|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not a bad contract|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|pjs_ch: hi al l- late joiner to the commentary team   :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: easy 4@H bid for north|pg||
nt|rmb1: flannery+|pg||
nt|roswolf: west's double may tempt an indiscretion|pg||
nt|peachy: And even if no methods, the value of getting in there first pays big dividends over time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ogust?  you need a high IQ for that|pg||
nt|karesz: bergen|pg||
nt|bobh1: E considering offering 3N|pg||
nt|bobh1: although they may play that as some kind of slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|bobh1: cant see a slam opposite a limit raise|pg||
nt|bobh1: so hopefully 3N is natural 18-19|pg||
mb|3N|nt|neobas: E not thrilled by the 3@D response|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S IS DANGEROUS|pg||
nt|neobas: I play 4@S here as a Namyats, I think the hand is worth more than that|pg||
nt|april7: if 3@D is positive, why not 4NT by E!!!???|pg||
nt|neobas: All depends on methods|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed |pg||
nt|roswolf: west should blackwood hinself i think|pg||
nt|april7: it only depends on aces and ofcourse sometimes which|pg||
nt|april7: 4NT by W doesn't serve much|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry that adds a different dimension|pg||
nt|neobas: 4@S looks to show 9 tricks with @S as trumps|pg||
nt|april7: interchange ace of @H with ace of @C and down you go|pg||
nt|april7: not really, @C would be 3-3 for discard!!|pg||
nt|patricck: well, that would still be a slam that I would want to be in|pg||
nt|roswolf: silver lining|pg||
nt|april7: ofcourse, we all went already down in certain slams:):)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west must bid on 2 aces are golddust on this bidding|pg||
nt|patricck: with A@C the 3-3 break unnecessary except on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Hila is thinking... seems not sure what to do here...|pg||
nt|chick: I teach the rebid is 2@H if the suit is strong, 2@C if it is not|pg||
nt|peachy: heh :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: homonnay can visualize game if his partner has a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: @C = 16+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|neobas: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup it has|pg||
nt|rmb1: X = 3 card support|pg||
nt|ady: dbl support  showing 3 hearts|pg||
nt|peachy: 1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: le junior punt works here|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS didn't use Ghestem earlier so I suppose we have to allow them an F-convention|pg||
nt|roswolf: and the finesse of the spade 10 is marked|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still I would have goone for a balance X at last board.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@d? why not 2nt?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: not the strongest of suits for South to bid|pg||
nt|shevek: there are a few better contracts indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: but here we can visualise a part score going down...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|neobas: Never argue with success :)|pg||
nt|april7: W must continue with the 2 aces, E has only 19 points, could easily have more|pg||
nt|patricck: EW don't get any plus scores except when they bid slam :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: quick claim|pg||
nt|april7: well done|pg||
nt|jcwla: Light opening by S.  Double a reasonable choice by W.  N might have bid @S.  Nobody has anywhere to go over 2@C.|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: many play 2N here as Lebensohl style, as relay to 3@C for a weak hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 trick given|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not enuf|pg||
pc|dK|nt|famus: will make now|pg||
nt|xenya: on 38, NS in the other room did bid all the way to 5@C -- down 1 and 6 imps for the trailing team|pg||
nt|peachy: I dont have their conv card, it is Precision, but what responses etc they play, I do not know, nor of their NT opening range|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@c a slight upgrade, but the spade suit is good |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: there could easily be game on here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Patrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: yeah, its lebensohl situation|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Also partner will usually bid clubs with 4-4 in the minors|pg||
nt|karesz: he can see slam...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nigel_k:  If it was scrambling|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as yesterday Kath. Nice cards for specs and hard onec for the players|pg||
nt|bobh1: or he may go down|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: again cards lay wellfordeclarer|pg||
nt|karesz: he will make with @C J onside!|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess the @C J in the slot will save him|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: may well make11tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: they found the best contract, IMO|pg||
nt|shevek: thx Csaba, yes|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|peachy: FYI, operator is typing in explanations, please scross over the bids to see them|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: hand 22   6@D made with an overtrick|pg||
nt|peachy: 'Best' is relative.  If East decides to play spades to be 4-2 and cashes the jack of spades, hoping one of his kings is an entry, he may go down about four tricks.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|famus: yes thats wht i predicted--some imps to roy on that board|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rmb1: South opened a nebulous 1@D and West did not lead a @H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobh1: he's not totally sure that's his only play|pg||
nt|karesz: but @D A at N would be enough as well|pg||

pc|c7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: for lurkers|pg||

nt|rmb1: On  8, EW played in 4@C-4 after East bid 1@S - looks like a misunderstanding.  12IMP to GAMAX and the lead|pg||
nt|xenya: but on the next board (39) EW failed to bid grand -- 12 imps to GAMAX|pg||
nt|famus: 5@s @dA and @hA= -1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's an easy game to play badly |pg||
nt|peachy: It is typical Precision bidding philosophy: one side asks, the other answers, opposite of natural bidding where hand qualities etc. are often shown instead of asked|pg||
nt|peachy: the match remains tight, the 4th segment started at 116-117, now again only 1 IMP difference|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Ew bid their @C game in the OR on 54|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: but it feels wrong to pass as North, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|shevek: agree|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree with the bidding and would have gone -500 probably|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6-5 come alive|pg||
nt|gambit: whew.......next time, bid more economicaly |pg||
nt|bobh1: good play exonerates dubious bidding|pg||
nt|karesz: but listen to South very good lead: second @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new coffe. Bit more lucky|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|april7: after 2@S OPENING ew MIGHT ALSO REACH $1h AND ALSO GOING DOWN|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H ofcourse|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should end up in 4@H but e/w may stay low|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: this is a more solid double, but a problem for 4th hand|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s maybe?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: looks like a NT hand but if partner really is short in spades your A7 looks a limited stop|pg||
mb|2C|an|forcing|nt|chick: are NS playing weak NTs?|pg||
nt|peachy: on 54, however, they missed slam|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With lebensohl there are two ways to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: W can't pass now|pg||
nt|shevek: nice bid|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would choose whichever shows the shakiest 3NT bid|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: for most Lebensohl players 3@S would promise a 4cd heart suit|pg||
nt|shevek: pass says "I'm happy with a @s lead"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like EW can make 4@h on 4-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: pass means he hasnt better idea then @s lead|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: yep - that or 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also on 4-3|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: or the boring 5@C|pg||
nt|shevek: west might bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: *than|pg||
nt|shevek: since no @s stopper|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easiest 5@c |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think West should definitely bid 4@c because someone can bid hearts later|pg||
nt|shevek: might sound like a cuebid later :)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: Will 5@C crumble witht he 4-1 break?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|neobas: Surely W will bid 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not in this auction it never even got born|pg||
nt|gambit: Good play certainly helps justify optimistic or foolhardy bidding |pg||
nt|gambit: E praying for a balncing bid from N |pg||
nt|bobh1: I would respond with the W hand|pg||
nt|gambit: me too, 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@h=spades...?|pg||
nt|peachy: as lucj would have it, slam missed gained 13|pg||
nt|peachy: luck|pg||
nt|shevek: 4@s is like passing the ball|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I hadn´t passed on the dbl. at least 3@s|pg||
nt|shevek: what do YOU reckon pd?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as N:)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: West must be scared that 4@C is NF and he has extra values|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think 5@c is ok as long as you are careful to retain West's small club to ruff with|pg||
nt|shevek: choose a minor?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East can still use 4NT to pass the buck one more time|pg||
nt|karesz: Galim made 3 NT in the other room so leads by 234 IMPs|pg||
nt|gambit: not 1@H, not 1NT |pg||
nt|karesz: 34 Imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: NS need to play an early club to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: easts pass was odd imo but may pay dividends|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs a defensive error tho for 3n  to make|pg||
nt|bobh1: me too 1@D|pg||
nt|gambit: another exciting hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|karesz: but he can make 7 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|roswolf: this wont play well|pg||
nt|shevek: @cA, @c ruff, etc....|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: wrong suit and the singleton is on lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you got it Patrick:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But there are still 11 tricks after that|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: but a club ruff lets it through as spade loser goes on fourth heart?|pg||
nt|bobh1: ud get to 2N|pg||
nt|bobh1: instead of playing in your 5 card fit|pg||
nt|karesz: @C J is a strong stopper for him:)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|xenya: this can be defeated but not so easy |pg||
nt|famus: shud b -1 with proper ddef|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: if they keep their t/o dbls up to strength - there is a real argument they should pass 3@H BUT the girls have induced the phantom|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H ven makable if @C are not opened|pg||
nt|patricck: If North's 2@S said he didn't like spades much then South bought a very lucky hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's bid is ill disciplined|pg||
nt|april7: what should S lead against 4@H?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|shevek: south remembered that he "passed" for a @s lead :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can't see how that error will come.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the speed suggests that the obvious @S isnt so obvious to north|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: south shouldnt have reopened i think but then i can understand the temptation to do so|pg||
nt|peachy: 1@C = 16+, the rest alerted and I don't have info, syscards are available on the hungarian website, but only in hungarian |pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: we know that about west: he has 5@s bal or 5@s+ club suit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not expecting one!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nigel_k:  Tough problem for declarer|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: The operator in the other room told that the score on board 53 is incorrect here. 4D made. Operator made an error in claiming.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: 4@s bid = choose a minor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rmb1: Tricky to make 3@H on this layout|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|patricck: probably would lead a dimaond and the contract makes|pg||

nt|roswolf: there is an argument for a @D but a top heart is natural|pg||

pc|sK|nt|patricck: routine hand to finsih|pg||
nt|neobas: 5@C looks like a good save against 4@S but 5@S makes?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Despite the 8 @S EW hands do not look like they fit well|pg||
nt|karesz: 2 D! opening strenght|pg||
nt|gambit: So created because Doug Drury got tired of going down opposite Eric Murray's third seat openers.....|pg||

nt|jcwla: Good stuff.  Thanks Cornelia and all.|pg||
nt|chick: I might have been more scientific about it :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks Roland and Yotam.|pg||

nt|daman: specs say yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am not shure but belive W prommise 14+|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: no :(|pg||
nt|daman: this auction just went off the rails|pg||
nt|daman: 4@S seems obvious over 4@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: 3@h is shortness|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if 4@C was the ace and a slam try  he will go on|pg||
nt|daman: and then Easley|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt make sense east is emnormous opposite what west has promised|pg||
nt|rodal f: After the 1@D as @H and @S opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: i dont know the others|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|april7: 5@C much to expensive!!|pg||
nt|chick: and an excellent job by Yotam :)|pg||
nt|shevek: they'll stop in 3NT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: doesn't 5@D deny the @S Ace?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: Winkler passed with angry|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be a nail in Gamax coffin|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: For sure.|pg||
nt|shevek: if they don't ... :)  they shouldn't open flat 11 in 2nd seat vulnerable anymore |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  From South's point of view, North could still have as many as 15 HCP|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He may stop but it would be a big position|pg||
nt|daman: so they could be off 2 Aces hypothetically|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|famus: time for a drink here--cheers all--am today for irish whisky|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pjs_ch: big difference between 11 hcp and 15 in bidding a slam|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|nt|neobas: Oh, right, miscounted haha|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it does seem a slightly odd treatment, having 3@s here pre-emptive. Maybe 1@s followed by 2@s would be more constructive|pg||
nt|peachy: Dumbovich is an active bidder, we have evidence plenty in this match.  Kibitzer messages are highly disapproving of 3S and I agree|pg||
nt|peachy: Moreover, both opponents are passed hands so there was not much to preempt anyway|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's good to be an active bidder actually, very annoying for opposition|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: South presumably knows there is no fit|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: he could always try with a quantitative 4N|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They can probably find a tenth trick somewhere as long as they get no higher than 4NT|pg||
nt|shevek: minors don't split, so anything higher than 3NT is too high|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gambit: lots of work and no over-abundance of dummy entries |pg||
pc|sT|nt|shevek: ok, they earned the right to do it again :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pjs_ch: sounds like they found out just enough just in time|pg||
pc|h3|nt|shevek: EW happy to see such a strong dummy I bet|pg||
nt|shevek: the opening hand is well hidden|pg||
nt|gambit: Q@H|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|neobas: -1100 instead of -500 :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Claim +1|pg||
nt|bobh1: this hook would not really help him if it works|pg||
pc|s9|nt|shevek: they might even misdefend now allowing an overtrick or two:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|shevek: like, why play the ace??|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: was this a certain safety play?? I don't think so!!|pg||
nt|neobas: We're restarting in about 40 minutes everyone :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 2@s= 5@s+4@h  inv |pg||
nt|chick: 3@S is obviously a weak hand long suit, and they are in the best contract ... other spade bids may have meant stronger hands|pg||
nt|chick: so without knowing their CC, it's hard to disapprove|pg||
nt|daman: cloaim 7|pg||
nt|bobh1: he should have won the @D A|pg||

nt|mdgraham: what's to disapprove? 3@S made|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: is North here weak enough to open?|pg||
nt|daman: that was not a good demonstration of bidding prowess|pg||
nt|lestergold: and George that was a good demonstration of guarded understatement|pg||
nt|gambit: the diamond lead was a trojan horse, a poisoned fruit |pg||
nt|bobh1: actually it was a gift|pg||
nt|bobh1: which S declined to accept|pg||
nt|gambit: Only if you unwrap it |pg||

nt|daman: not bidding 4@S is unforgiveable|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w will play a partscore 3@D|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|pjs_ch: East is quite a powerful hand for a weak two|pg||
nt|karesz: János|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: or not|pg||
nt|roswolf: MAYBE NOT!! |pg||
nt|roswolf: PRESUMABLY east couldnt conveniently bid on his hand|pg||
nt|rmb1:  11 was indeed a small swing to GAMAX. EW 2@S-2 4IMP|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS heading for a tough 3NT|pg||
mb|2S!|an|GF|nt|xenya: now i wonder what S's double meant |pg||
nt|xenya: and what is he to do now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: i think its card showing double|pg||
nt|chick: well, mike, any contract that makes when all others go down is a good one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: seriously, I agree - but maybe South had no other way to bid his hand in the NS system  |pg||
nt|shevek: yes, two aces!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what else than 41S from N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: only bid other than passforsouth|pg||
nt|daman: to me he might have had   xx KQxx xxx AKQx|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|rodal f: Belive color since E told a major. But seems to be a bit hard here|pg||
nt|gambit: only a heart gives up nothing immediately, all other leads potentially costly (iF S accepts his gift) Note none of us suggested he rise a trick 1, later of course it was easier to ...|pg||
nt|gambit: spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: only 3!|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: South has rescued North here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: they called director|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: North might have thought he onyl had a working 7 count|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: EW called him|pg||
nt|shevek: some hesitations, huh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hesitation|pg||
mb|3C|an|5h 4c|nt|rmb1: Establish one @D for =|pg||
nt|ady: should  not have any problems |pg||
nt|peachy: When 2S was conventional, I would rather have bid 1S thaaaaaaan 3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry all, I have to go now. Looks like an exciting finsih....|pg||
nt|shevek: north had a 3.5@s bid|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: not clear that a slow 3@S shows extra values; it might as easily be short of values|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: agree patrick|pg||
nt|gambit: 3@D, this was not the hand to press on that moth-eaten suit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: too tough me Kath-|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a misfit with the cards spittimng to boot|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East has to avoid a major |pg||
nt|yo_yo: j@D looks right|pg||
nt|lestergold: but likely to be flat as only in a bidding comp do u avoid 3n with a combined 26 miltons|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@H should have costed here. If X for color next X from S=cards and N pass|pg||
nt|xenya: unfortunately 5@D has no play here -- tough luck|pg||
nt|peachy: sure does, thanks so much Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 trick gifted|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that probably lets it in|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets uin the 8th trick but where is the 9th|pg||
nt|yo_yo: impossible to defend|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can't see more then 8 |pg||
nt|lestergold: not i Kath tell us how it makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: east will come under pressure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will be forced to give away a @H trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant see a heart trick crated|pg||
nt|lestergold: however defenders must certainly be careful with their discards|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1 and 2NT=force same as 3@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Grand is good enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: From me. 3@S que|pg||
nt|rodal f: Trumph sat by 3@H|pg||
nt|karesz: 7 @h is better, but 7 NT may be good when @h is 5-0|pg||
nt|othered1: Systems that let you show extras at relatively low levels should show a plus on hands like these.  Someone should be able to count around 13 tricks|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rmb1: sneaky |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks all.|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: a slow pass gives clear UI, but less so for a slow 3@S|pg||
nt|shevek: the director will let the score stand|pg||
nt|lestergold: east totally guards the hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: @H5 now !|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: yes, Franks, 3@HX would have cost 800 it seems |pg||
nt|xenya: *Frank :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|famus: shud've covered that pips were good--double dummy is makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3@H  mean  |pg||
nt|karesz: 4 @s = asking for aces|pg||
mb|5C|nt|shevek: so they don't play with screens I gather ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: there is screen|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: declarer still needs ot establish a minor suit|pg||
nt|gambit: 4 trump losers....ouch |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: club to king and diamond seems normal|pg||
nt|famus: if E returned a high @h back|pg||
nt|karesz: 4 from 5|pg||
mb|7H|nt|yo_yo: Geller hoping the @C break|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  With North and East on the same side and East having an automatic pass the screen doesn't help|pg||
nt|shevek: I don't see the problem if there are screens|pg||
nt|othered1: What information did west have when he bid 7?|pg||
nt|karesz: E has at least 18 points|pg||
pc|h5|nt|karesz: 2 @s was riverse|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|peachy: What do you think of W pass?  If 3S showed a monster (Dbl, then bid suit, opposite silent partner) I think West might give a thought to 3NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think 3@S is probably Forcing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to choose between 4S and 3NT for West|pg||
nt|yo_yo: What happens if E doubles again?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But irrespective of bidding a hesitation will make that only a obvious bid from S can be accepted|pg||

nt|daman: West need to be alert to play the @H Q if needed|pg||

nt|yo_yo: correction 3@S nearly forcing :)|pg||

nt|rodal f: Is that for the pair at OR?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: GAMAX leads by 25 imps at this point. Considering a likely game swing on 45, Royston will have their work cut out for them in the last segment. |pg||
nt|yo_yo: the 9 is mostly doubleton or from an interior sequence with us|pg||

nt|bobh1: i guess "impossible" for N to lead a @H?|pg||

nt|roswolf: dont think so he will cash an ace and then cash out spades|pg||
nt|panja: he should|pg||
nt|rmb1: the luxury of having two aces to cash to look at dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|ady: chance for the leaders  here|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, only cost 3 imps :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry im multitasking|pg||
nt|lestergold: always get my keyboards ixed up|pg||
nt|karesz: my mistake|pg||
nt|karesz: two boards to play na d28 IMPs for Galim!|pg||
nt|rodal f: GAMAX use 14+ for at least one pair, but whome I have not wroted down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: By 1@D @H @S openings|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: now we will see|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may move|pg||
nt|panja: withouth a singleton.. and with AKA..N should not|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 7@H a make played by west     club ruff available if east plays|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well he has|pg||
nt|rmb1: splinter with stiff ace will not help West value his hand|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@S is kickback RKCB for @H|pg||
nt|ady: not my cup of tea  1@H from west  15 tricks available in no-trumps here|pg||
nt|rmb1: Gain for Dumbovich on  27 bidding and making 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 1S = 11-15, could be sghir (Precision)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Although North knows South has @D, he can't bid 4@D directly as that may be a forcing relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this throws oil on the fire|pg||
nt|rmb1: 5NY showing a void|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive puppet is on by this type of 1NT opening|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: 2@H here ought to be a 6+ cd suit, so 4@H seems the obvious choice|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: hogs might try 3N, I suppose|pg||
nt|karesz: no, no it were my partner and me playing that system yesterday!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rmb1: wd|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: wd|pg||
nt|rodal f: This also can be -1|pg||
nt|karesz: N had @s stopper in the other room....|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: Nooo, 1D is that|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: wow incroyable|pg||
nt|panja: this will make...|pg||
nt|roswolf: a huge result for n/s|pg||
nt|panja: If W wanted to dbl, he should have doubled first time|pg||
nt|bobh1: this prob shows a partial stopper|pg||
nt|karesz: see this double!|pg||
nt|bobh1: 5@D prob ok also|pg||
nt|sybarra2: scary bid is 3 nt |pg||
nt|bobh1: if they can work out that they have a @S stopper here, I'm impressed|pg||
nt|karesz: Kemény can think this double shows @S ace|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: in the OR    west did not open and  north opened 3@S    east doubled and westresponded 4@H passedout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: big loss for Dubovich on 58 when he cashed that A@D|pg||
nt|karesz: 1 major 14+ and 2 major 10-13 with a single or void outside|pg||
pc|d3|nt|famus: @d lead wud result in the decision on @h guess|pg||
nt|famus: most likely @sj|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: same lead as in other room, fetched the J and A|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: 11HP=max now at S so a push? The @H quest, but odd for a hook.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: why use stayman and then ignfor the 4-4 fit, i wonder|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|karesz: a heart now|pg||
nt|gambit: double promised 13 cards, and 3 spades ...or ......|pg||
nt|bobh1: marked i think|pg||
nt|gambit: heart attack for sure|pg||
nt|karesz: N has to find the @C J|pg||
nt|gambit: E probably trying to imagine why his partner doubled|pg||
nt|bobh1: @H could be dangerous also...alternative is a trump|pg||
nt|bobh1: but a @H is the right play|pg||
nt|gambit: looking a dummy's clubs I think E will play a heart|pg||
nt|karesz: w have threw the @s 9 asking @h|pg||
nt|gambit: Or would that be count? (probably not given the auction and the K@S falling) |pg||
nt|bobh1: i agree it is suit preference...tell your pd what he needs to know|pg||
nt|karesz: but for count 8 is enough|pg||
nt|gambit: E needs W to have something in hearts, he knows his value, such as they are limited |pg||
nt|bobh1: presumably he will know the count when declarer's honor falls|pg||
nt|bobh1: so tell him something he doesn't know|pg||
nt|karesz: but North can make always: with the @c finesse or playing for 3rd J|pg||
nt|sybarra2: with udca did that show club?|pg||
nt|gambit: His team has narrowed the gap, down from -46 to -36, he doesn't know that...|pg||
nt|bobh1: or he knows the count from the auction|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|gambit: There has to be some common sense, West's card was perhaps lazy, how could he want a club unless E was short? |pg||
nt|bobh1: he is looking at the South hand isn't he?|pg||
nt|gambit: Yes.|pg||
nt|karesz: Bob! Lakatos played the @D A at the first tricks in 4 @s|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. The Hungarian system I've got told:)|pg||

nt|roswolf: this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, Robin and  Prakash for their company plus wit and perceptive comments and to our specs ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||

nt|shevek: thanks to my excellent fellow commentators Patrick, Ralf and Nigel|pg||
nt|shevek: thanks to our excellent operator Csaba Konkoly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North had to return a @D  but he knows that now|pg||
nt|bobh1: so he got the swing|pg||
nt|karesz: only one Hungarian pair :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: thanks to the Hungarian Bridge Federation, especially Adam Magyar who was instrumental in organising the vugraph|pg||
nt|bobh1: Lakatos|pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u are. A reason for not play that system?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: not a standard preempt but I like it :)|pg||
nt|peachy: quite a flyer, even favorable vulnerability|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now,  leaping michaels???|pg||
nt|peachy: North-South have shown throught the match that they are active bidders|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no that's if they preempt a major|pg||
nt|peachy: This one sure gives E a problem|pg||
nt|chick: I don't ... yes I know the theory that you are preempting 2 opponents and only 1 partner, but with a Hxx in a major, it's going to cost when partner has that major, like here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am sure his partner is now telling him :)|pg||
nt|karesz: aes!|pg||
nt|karesz: You wer right:)|pg||
nt|karesz: e|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: scheduled restart in 20 mins approx|pg||
nt|peachy: Doing it in second seat with this kind of hand could be hazardous to your score, partner is odds-on to have a good handm there is already one passed opponent....|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in France 4@c = 2suiters red colours  4 @d= 2majors suiters|pg||
nt|gambit: And you doubted him? Oh ye of little faith! |pg||
mb|2C|nt|yo_yo: michaels cue bid showing the majors|pg||

nt|yo_yo: or something similar|pg||
nt|karesz: he (Lakatos) won the match vs. me yesterday playing very well|pg||
nt|bobh1: last board for this set...see you in about 20 minutes...thx all|pg||
nt|gambit: this table NS will stop in 3S and go plus, that is the way it has been going |pg||
nt|sybarra2: thx to our terrific operator! |pg||
mb|2D|nt|shevek: and of course always Roland Wald our vugraph co-ordinator |pg||
nt|pjs_ch: hear, hear and thanks to you too|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and thx to all commentators,  esp. thx to kibbers who keep us on our toes |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: NS's good set had not been helped by team mates in other room|pg||
nt|peachy: so in second seat it is 1:1 while in first it is 2:1|pg||
nt|shevek: and last but not least thanks to our spectators who give us a reason to be here in the first place|pg||
nt|gambit: Indeed. and to the specs and the players for their high-level play. Commentators - go play! LOL |pg||

nt|chick: yes, even worse|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and West goes straight to game|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next segment to start in 2H 10M|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Gamax has caught up a bit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and another 10 imps now, will be close|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: they may have overbid this one|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H..hanging partner for showing support..|pg||
nt|ady: a thin 3NT here  assume  north 2@C shows 5 clubs and a 4 card major    or 1 suited clubs?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: looks like 4@S must be close to making here|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: although other room went off|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: maybe it's just too high|pg||
nt|shevek: too much work to do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Very difficult hand to analyze but I think nine is the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: as expected, 13 imps to GAMAX on 45|pg||
nt|karesz: i like this system Fantoni nunes play similar one|pg||
nt|rodal f: =?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: oh dear South wasnt in on the joke|pg||
nt|daman: this is the last board of this session|pg||
nt|gambit: I fail to see why 3@D should get S excited, it should have slowed him down|pg||
nt|karesz: unlucky game:  single cards opposite kings|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: @D are 3-3 it is not all over yet|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Worse played by South if they lead a trump|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: with only 2 tricks outside you need to make 8 trumps or set up the hearts|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: does not  appear to have much chance|pg||
nt|rmb1: -2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: makeable now|pg||
nt|shevek: a chance now|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: that lead actually gives declarer a (welcome) diamond trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard @c|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I said earlier, you need an understanding partner if you bid like this|pg||
nt|chick: This will be the final nail in the Dumbovich coffin|pg||
nt|gambit: sorry 3@C, still J954 is hardly what partner could need |pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|ady: has started well|pg||
nt|shevek: @cK led in OR|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: South of course doesn't know the running score, he might have tried to get a swing, perhaps he would not have doubled early in the match,|pg||
nt|chick: All I can say Kath is that if I ever have the pleasure of playing with you, I hope you are this understanding a partner :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: errr  not always :)|pg||
nt|peachy: 6D would have been making, neither side found it|pg||
nt|chick: the question is, would they have found 6@D without the preempt?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: thx all have to dash to brunch  see you later today for NEC |pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: South wants to lead @D   like his partner didnt on the last board|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pjs_ch: I always learned that KQ was given to you to solve the lead problem|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|peachy: So my speculation of why this was doubled, could have resulted in them "running to diamonds and then bidding slam|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|roswolf: but is now|pg||
nt|rmb1: Either way there is only 6/7IMP in the match at this stage.  |pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzvx: thx all|pg||
nt|chick: a well-deserved -15|pg||

nt|roswolf: their e/w in the room seemed to be on tilt|pg||
nt|petergill: Royston has more players - one of them was commentating at the other table|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty for info peter|pg||
nt|rmb1: was he supportive of EW's efforts?|pg||
nt|petergill: He commentated only for the good (for Royston) bits at the start of the set. |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: Hard for S to find a good lead. Luckely E didn't use @H9|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Seems as @CQ was the lead at OR so 1IMPin NS?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: Great duck of @HK by Lakatos - else 4@H makes, with @D 3-3|pg||
