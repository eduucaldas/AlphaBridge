nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello Peter|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D NS and 5@H EW?|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@H easy - 5@s? could make|pg||
nt|pelu: but I exp that S will X 5@h|pg||
nt|xenya: strictly speaking, 5@S by S is down on a @D lead...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|xenya: there we go!|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: yes - I sse -buy for sure @hQ against 5@s|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|fluff: u said lead h q from west :)|pg||
nt|pelu: and - sorry East will be on lead against a @s-contract|pg||
nt|xenya: if W passes now Lauria will bid something -- after that things look obscure|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I dont exp Zimmermann to bid now - for its N in the "tank"|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: well done|pg||

nt|bvdahl: I think I agree that 4@h is probably best in the long run...|pg||
nt|iceking: yes and you usually make overtrick so given that 3@H has to be underbid|pg||
nt|jillan:  Will he upgrade this to 8 points|pg||
nt|jcwla: Was dead to rights on beating 4@C but 4@D not so much, whatevah...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and we have 2 more boards of today's schedule|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5@d against 5@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: maximim weak pass by north|pg||
nt|jcwla: I guess if 8-card suits are almost always trump then 9-card suits must always be trump.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharkey: The @DQ the key here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, NS have all the power, but may overboard well|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sfoxa:  in @s game, NS have to guess @d right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|jillan:  the 2@S opening bid shows 0-7 and 5+@S is this to strong|pg||
nt|ybob: Q@D and @C finesse to 8 tricks, M lead was down|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: this is makeable looking at all hands|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: 2@C some Gazzili type bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  W was on th right track|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Identical auction.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|sharkey: Lauria misguessed @DQ OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: The old adage of the Q behind the J......|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sfoxa:  bad news|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  so the result|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bessi2: indeed Sælensminde lead a @h vs 2N but followed low when Lauria played towards the Q of @d|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for now, tha matter of course follows the same way as next door|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  trump return?|pg||
nt|sharkey: West has a chance to go wrong - dont know pd has @SK...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  both red suits don't look promising for lead |pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|4D|mb|4H|nt|pelu: strange that Multon bid 4@D - why not 4@S - 4@D only a help for ooponents |pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S wouldfor sure force S to bid 5@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|5H|mb|d|nt|xenya: tough now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|pelu: hard start for the italian stars|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|pelu: this is a pairs event - but playing Imps across the field - from start 30-30 in VP and and 1 IMP = 31-29 and so on |pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|s3|pc|h5|pg||

nt|othered1: No argument, just an observation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Anita|pg||
nt|iceking: yes i know it look silly but it really wasnt i think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, applause and several imps to Brink|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, last board of the round|pg||
nt|jcwla: BTW it didn't come into play on this hand but if S gets to open this hand and it's in range for 1NT that is my choice.  You often hear "no need to bid 1NT when have a convenient @S ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: rebid" but so often it is not the case, you end up not able to show the hand.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sfoxa:  last board of this round|pg||
nt|bessi2: looks like 4@s should make easily enough as the cards lie so a good result for Brogeland-Sælensminda in the open room|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|sfoxa:  thanks to all the  specs for watching and providing with hints, great thanks to our operator, job well done!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: Big round for NS and Lauria-Versace struggling next door|pg||
mb|4S|nt|iceking: 1@C simular to magic @D|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sfoxa:  S hoped for his own play when bidding 1@s, not 2 |pg||
mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  next round follows right now, so stay tuned|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  currently, NS are providing 40-20 and keep the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: even the same |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  when EW will find sacrifice (very cheap this time), N would better assess his values and score small plus in 4@s dbld|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Variations on a theme here.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm, not so S. definitely, no expecting partner with such @s values|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mareczek: I think that 2@s solved all problems of N|pg||
nt|mareczek: his problem now is 6 or 7?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Ns hand deserves one more move|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S can have at all valueless hand, kind of xxxx QJx xxx xxx - but only this case is really bad for N|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think that rdbl was "bid your suit" and 2@s promises some values in this case|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ybob: 5@H defeat 500 with @D leads from S ( played by E) , hard to do|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  will N find @h lead?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sfoxa:  the only chance for defence|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jcwla: No way, this is cheap insurance time, nobody knows who is making what and they're not going to voluntarily allow a possible double swing.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  careful now! E has to play @c, not @d  in return|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|jillan:  maybe S should have ducked that|pg||
nt|bessi2: interesting defence here|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bessi2: he must play a spade from dummy now if he want to avoid a guess|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mareczek: thanks a lot, bye :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  idea about cashing @c ace seems better - if partner discourages, E has possibility to switch to @d|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|iceking: yes looks clear duck trick one |pg||
nt|jillan:  gives W entries to play @C from dummy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bessi2: and now another diamond and declarer must guess|pg||
nt|ybob: was better play K@D and @S to hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. east must not ponder too long though|pg||
pc|sA|pc|hT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|iceking: will just use it to play @C to Ten i assume|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|jillan:  now I see why....'|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even this ruff doesn't prevent declarer from making|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - a push|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|vugraphzyv: we will start next round in 1 hour 22 minutes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  see you. thanks to all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: This is the last board of this round - 14 more rounds to follow.  We'll be back soon|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like the normal play|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jillan:  normal result|pg||
nt|othered1: south m ade two odd plays there|pg||
nt|jillan:  10 or eleven tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|nt|sfoxa:  NS lost a bunch of imps, but can find consolation in retaining pair's moral. Leading partner's suit. |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm check the scores here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Strange stuff here.  |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyway, thanks Sveta and Ivan and all kibs.  For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
mc|10|nt|sfoxa:  from both side, I'd say |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thank you Jordan|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thanks to all the specs and special "bravo" to our operator - one should try this jib once to understand :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzyv: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|sharkey: Each round consist of 8 board and the scoring is on IMPs converted to VPs - max score per round is 60-0|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Full list of participants looks impressive - we have a little more time to examine it http://www.slavacup.com/list.of.participants.htm|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|vugraphzyv: hello|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  re-hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: Hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 20-20 hand.  W has no call over 1@S.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW can hardly win the bidding, although... |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let' see|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|iceking: dont think S should upgrade his hand |pg||
nt|mareczek: Herbst brother play natural system with transfer responses after 1@c opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: south upgrades to 12, OK with 2.5 honor tricks, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: make little sense to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT a challenge - 4@S better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway, not a coffee-board for a start|pg||
nt|sharkey: nope - East may have overbid slightly - a little to good for 3@S over 3@H.  Needs to take @H finesse I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: West looking at @SQ and @HA....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mareczek: Herbst brothers, sorry|pg||
nt|mareczek: they both use the same system :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 5-3-3-2 shape bad suit cant see the reason|pg||
nt|jillan:  with a system as this I agree with Magnus|pg||
nt|jcwla: A false preference to 2@S would be better, perhaps those @H's looked like six to N.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  welcome to the 3rd round of Slava Cup http://www.slavacup.com/tournament.htm|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: well judged|pg||
nt|jillan:  would need at least another 10 LOL|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 1N was just generic point-showing, so south had to bid|pg||
nt|iceking: assume now S has shown 12-13hcp with 5@S |pg||
pc|cA|nt|iceking: N took a very good view stop now, i would be little bid interested in 3nt looking at his hand|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW did their best to win the bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree. but even now, N can manage his tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sfoxa:  at the tournament web-site, one can find the participants lists (quite impressive) and results for both groups - Top-16 and Top-40|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Brink-Driver won round 1 and are still doing well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not even a false preference in this case.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Even 2 is too high|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: Our operator, William Hernebrink, advises sys on after W 1@h, 1NT on 1@c 8-11 balanced hand |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3@h by NS looks good, even @h game is possible with non-accurate defence|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|s4|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: It is understandable why N might choose to bid 2@H, this is the type of hand that could make a @H game with the right holding and some extras in S.  Also, the suit has nice ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: texture.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|iceking: he has a very good 11 i would say|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: William plays the same system and is able to explain when he alerts. Excellent!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|iceking: maybe he needs to downgrade his hands if his pd is always upgrading:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@C by N now, can be 15-17 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: alot of pdships actually work like that|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sfoxa:  with 25 points, EW have no game to play, but NS can compete till 3@s|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Any game here's a challenge.... - perhaps 4@H the better|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  NS have enough for the game, but bidding it looks easier than making|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Assume 2@D transfer to 2@H|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  looks like|pg||
nt|jcwla: A pretty moth-eaten vul opener but nothing sits too badly here.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|sharkey: 4@S may be ok too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS can overboard easily|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|othered1: south looks at this fine spot and is happy he's not vulnerable|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, both @h and @c are 3-3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  they are over 3nt, seemingly 4@h finishes the bidding|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as a kibitser pointed out, S like his hand much more than it's worth|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and only @h lead will beat this contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: and not doubled|pg||
nt|iceking: i would have liked N to bal with 1nt here instead of dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump lead best|pg||
nt|sharkey: But East on lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  attempt to pitch @d losers on @c will reduce W trump holding destined to 2 tricks anyway with this @h split|pg||
nt|sharkey: This plays better from N - else @S lead wud also disrupt communicarions|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even with E hand, trump start looks better than any other|pg||
nt|sharkey: *communications|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  declarer sees a lot of possibilities, I suppose|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, the question is which one to choose?|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is IMP scoring and the scores from all 8 tables are included.  On the Movie button you'll see the score from the other BBO table, but the IMP score may not be correct.|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think all options are losing ones Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are aware of it, not so declarer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see, how it goes. Should admit, trump lead created the biggest bundle of problems for declarer|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  juicy result for NS|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|sfoxa:  @d lead was a kind of trap for declarer - playing this suit by himself, he'll rather find @d A onsite |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even @s brings a trick now |pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: Did the double distinguish between possible hands?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that way seems better than other options|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h5|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|hT|nt|sfoxa:  altought the battle isn't over|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: East @S duck may be expensive|pg||
nt|sharkey: Makes now - huge score to Drijver|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c3|nt|iceking: probably just takout, 1@C though is limited to max 17hcp so with this pattern and texture of the hand i would have bid 1nt playing this system|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c5|nt|sfoxa:  S has to return @c to make declarer feel uncomfortable|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||

pc|h6|nt|jillan:  3NT should make....|pg||
nt|jillan:  or could anyhow|pg||

nt|Walddk2: scroll back :)|pg||
nt|iceking: horrible hand in any system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes Ed, but what is your rebid after 1@D  1M?|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  good question|pg||
nt|ybob: i agree with 1@H but i like pass 1@S|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@D = no 5M|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: 2 other major|pg||
nt|othered1: easy|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|iceking: 2sp probably over 1@H if you open 1@D |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ah, Italian style|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent treatment|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant see open this east hand 1@D |pg||
nt|jillan:  me neither|pg||
nt|sharkey: 10 or 11 tricks here - coffee time...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, really - 3rd hand allows that. I disregarded this "pecularity".|pg||
nt|ybob: pd shows 5@S so this shows limits values|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: EW may have missed a good sac|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - @s game is cool|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, 1@s looks better even with 2cards by W|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: Not my idea of a red weak 2 in @H's with 12 "berries": A 10 K 9 Q 6 J 5 T 4 9 2 8 1 -- would want more like 18.  And yet again S defers to N's "hearts."  Really surprised @S's not ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: mentioned at all, deep position.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iceking: problem doing so is you have such a powerful hand, you will need rest of your bidding trying to recover |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can because a jump in the other major is artificial as I play it|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|iceking: and usually end up just guessing |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can be a hand too good for a 3@D rebid|pg||
nt|ybob: 5 tricks by EW|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: Actually, in Kaplan-Sheinwold, it can go 1@D -1M - 3@D forcing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guessing @c right ends declarer's problems, even if not, he can escape finding W with short @h but 2 trumps only|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ybob: now K ?|pg||
nt|ybob: K shows 3@C and good time to play another @S from N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS have to attack @d in time|pg||
nt|ybob: @D will play from S|pg||
nt|ybob: K@C , @S, and S low @D |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|iceking: but it doesnt show a hand to good for 1@D opening:)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hQ|nt|othered1: showing a hand you'd have opened 2@C if suit were a major and you have hand an extra natural bid along the way.|pg||

nt|ybob: 1@S= neg X without @S |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but here EW should find their way to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: yes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bessi2: not familiar with n-s system here but suprising to see a 1@c and not 1@d opening|pg||
nt|ybob: they play 1@C p 1@D = no 5M|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S should consider his @h lenght as a stopper and bid game|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H bid now|pg||
nt|jcwla: Beautiful hand to lead from... meanwhile the Rabbi is busy this set.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: so 6 is more or less 75%|pg||
nt|othered1: in 2/1, west would be 80 percent of the way to slam.  In EW''s acol style, it may not be|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|othered1: 4@D? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D probably a fragment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or maybe just a cue bid|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has got one more chance to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: yes...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lesser evil|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: doesn't that normally imply shortness in 4th suit?|pg||
nt|rnc: Cue, I'm told (sitting 2 mtrs from the table)|pg||
nt|iceking: good bidding with no extras w will bid 6@H now |pg||
nt|rnc: Should be short, in my opinion|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in the CR, EW used 5 bids to get to 4@h. Here they might use less than that to arrive in slam...|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 5 bidding rounds|pg||
nt|othered1: Quite a comeback for Vintage.|pg||
nt|iceking: east bidding in closed room looks just surreal |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this one doesn't looks very special|pg||
nt|sharkey: should be off as dummy very short of entries.....|pg||
nt|mareczek: they have found the contract which is difficult do double|pg||
nt|mareczek: East knows that they have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mareczek: should play spade after @cA|pg||
nt|mareczek: otherwise, declarer can play @sJ|pg||
nt|mareczek: and if W will not cash the spades, EW can be in troubles|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  to create problems for declarer,N have to lead opp's suit - @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @c lead appears helpful|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would you have passed throughout as S, Sveta?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  5@d is good as well|pg||
nt|ybob: S prefer wait to bid NT if pd has H stiff|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  well done!|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sharkey: Dont see how East can avoid @D loser|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  would have considering this option, but triple, not only twicr|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *twice, sorry|pg||
mb|d|nt|ybob: now pass|pg||
mb|4D|nt|iceking: ok iam trying to see what extras W has someone help me|pg||
nt|bvdahl: good philosophy. Bid the contract that makes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with @d split 3-3, one @d finess and one ruff is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If the Vintage team advance the good news for us is that Hed and Andersson will be available as operators for future broadcasts :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Although we don't need them when we have William and Magnus. They are great!|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|sfoxa:  no dbl - no trouble, will S think seeing the dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|rnc: Don't forget there is a Consolation Cup too. But I might bench them to do the broadcasting... :):)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's strong willed of them -- I might be out the door, never to return (during this event.)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sfoxa:  but not this time, yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: can only get to dummy by playing @H - thus no ruff|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  alas|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  helpful hand from defence?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not from this players, though|pg||
nt|sharkey: B has shown @C by X I think - S may contionue with @CK and more @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: *N|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  start was good from both sides. let's see the next move |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa:  first attempt to gain 9th trick failed|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  4 @d rounds force 4 discards from dummy, hence @c  |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|sharkey: Good defence - didnt even get a pitch on @SK...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|rnc: Remember that both broadcasters are in the trailing team. (And they are still alive...as far as I can see)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d9|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h9|mc|6|nt|sfoxa:  it was declarer's trick|pg||
