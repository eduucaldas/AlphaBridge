mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: well judged|pg||

nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: The reason is that N lead a spade from hand out of turn|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but better is to look for Easts distribution. 5@h and perhaps/probably 4@d. @s can be 4-1|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: again one of my normal rubber-hands in East :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: The 21 IMPs must be some kind of carryover from a previous session|pg||

nt|chick: nah, I don't want to hear that kind of thing ... bridge is a game of mistakes ... would be more interesting to hear his reasoning, even if wrong|pg||

mb|p|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: is this auction for real?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jillan:  this has better chance though than the previous one|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|iceking: problem doing so is you have such a powerful hand, you will need rest of your bidding trying to recover |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can because a jump in the other major is artificial as I play it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|iceking: and usually end up just guessing |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can be a hand too good for a 3@D rebid|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|ralfwil: and therefore 7nt is better than 7@s|pg||

nt|rnc: (however under the name of San Sac) with a couple of IMP's after 96 boards the previous year.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion 7nt from E with the @d suit|pg||
nt|rnc: For those interesting in the CC of E/W it's available at http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc11/fc_main_en.htm - check under Convention Cards|pg||

nt|lestergold: i dont think he was frightened of going off in 3N with 8 top tricks and bound to get another in one of the suits he over valued his hand thats why he went on|pg||

nt|Walddk2: New philosophy, I only bid the slams that make|pg||

nt|rnc: It looks like bad coaching from the captain. Who to blame? Me of course, since I'm the guilty one...:)|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|othered1: 4@D? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D probably a fragment|pg||
