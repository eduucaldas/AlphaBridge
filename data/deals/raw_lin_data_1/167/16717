nt|roswolf: in the other room south didnt open|pg||
nt|rmb1: Does W double? (or 1NT or Pass)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 3N should be final contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: magical mystery tour begins perhaps?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jbgood: all players in this match have represented Norway - Erichsen also England|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless they use 1N for something other than a balanced 15-18, the dbl seems out of place|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi Gabor and Bård. Here we go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But they only need to be a member of a Norwegian club|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi Peter.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and now there are no problems on this layout|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Hello Mr. Lund :)|pg||
nt|cicus: N has a strong suit, an entry and still cannot enjoy enough tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Home it seems. Only @C lead to beat it, if I'm not wrong|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @c lead can be ducked|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and you can deny S entry later|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hae me doubts|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not so easy to see a reasonable way to get that many things wrong|pg||
nt|ady: after losing a diamond finesse  declarer needs to search for 9th trick    possible to miss guess in hearts and spades to lose 4 more tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: spec suggested a 3rd hand 1@S opening by S|pg||

nt|bvdahl: it used to show 5431 shape with 3 card major. Not anymore :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3@c makes if he decides to play S for Hx in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: to defeat 3Nt after @h to Q S have to play @CK!|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but the laternative is to play small @c from hand, playing N for Hx|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cicus: good contract, 7 is definitely bad|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: in all respects except 1|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cicus: needing a finesse + trumps not 4-0|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bvdahl: but this line accounts for KQx in S, of course|pg||
nt|cicus: small from hand as well|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but presumably play small from hand to play N for Hx, so you will not play @c to T later|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: miracle workers Hand H but no this time|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, it makes :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: you need more than just the finesse don't you?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bvdahl: and now there are 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cicus: true, long @HQ does not help|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is e not squeezed|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|ady: spec suggested 6@D has chances     but no chance    throw in wont help   ruff and discard still does not help      needed club finesse for that to work to discard a spade|pg||
nt|bvdahl: In mt opinion, Helgemo was a bit too eager on this bid. Helness could hardly hold better cards, so I understand whu he bid 6  @s|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Probably West can control the club suit in that scenario|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|vugraphztd: board 3 fell on the floor - jumps to bord 4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|cicus: a double sq might develop with clubs as the double threat|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|cicus: oh no, blacks are badly placed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hmm, I hate to be picky, but isn't West discarding spades after dummy?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Can it become a mine for EW?|pg||

nt|pelu: yes but the play was @c to Q and K - and here @C back defeat|pg||

nt|bjacobs: "conservative"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you describe it as "daft", you are going to run out of adjectives when something really stupid comes along|pg||
nt|cicus: I  think it is useful to have a bid at least for hearts in an inviting hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: some masochist set this one|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I was talking about a @h back instead of @d j|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Why that agressive lead from S? If she belive it down a @H often use to be a good lead.|pg||

pc|s5|nt|bvdahl: what do I know.... ;)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The team names are counties|pg||
nt|dburn: was wondering who this Midt-Trondelag was|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I still stand by my statement. If declearer holds KQ98 in spadesm you will have a hard time to raise them regardless|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe but thats a hefty 1nt|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bvdahl: the J is right if decl has KQ9|pg||
nt|dburn: true, but he might have bid 3NT with @sKQ9 alone, when a low spade lead would be a pity|pg||

nt|ahollan1: check out http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bvdahl: yes, but it is a matter of what is right most of the time. J is right when decl has exactly KQ9|pg||
nt|bvdahl: while a small spade handles a lot of the other distributions|pg||
nt|dburn: true, but you don't know how many tricks you need from spades - even if declarer has @sKQ98, it may work to lead high if you need only two tricks from the suit, but it won't work ...|pg||
nt|dburn: to lead low|pg||
nt|ady: this may well be a much needed swing for Rogaland|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I agree that on this auction there is a good case for a low spade|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: slightly off-centre to double rather than bid 2@s with the South cards|pg||

mb|5S|nt|pelu: can West now jump to 3@s?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: I wonder why N found attractive to bid on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It does seem quite undisciplined|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe 4@C has implied willingness?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally 4@C says  "I know what to do if they bid game"   [not YOU]|pg||
nt|cicus: S has a clear X now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "clear" eh?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's wondering about 6@S I reckon|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: flip-flop North's @S & @D and it is clear-cut 6@C        of course that would mean this deck has 15 @S but ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I agree, he cannot possibly know whether diamonds are controlled, and East is likely to lead the suit|pg||
nt|cicus: not only has he 21/" tricks in @Hs, trump ace but @DJxxx may be a nuisance as well|pg||
nt|cicus: 2 1/2|pg||
nt|cicus: and then I do nozt count on a @C trick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too difficult to make a decision other than x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point -- must worry about what to say to Committee|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it's often hard to think straight in this situation ...|pg||
mb|d|nt|cicus: yes, he should have|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he might have... but he will get another chance|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some help from NS?|pg||
nt|cicus: is this true?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, South's bid is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|pelu: S = 911|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Hoftaniska gone to the toilet while his pd was thinking. still not back|pg||
nt|cicus: Defence is likely to be @CK overtaken, @HK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or overtaken and a diamond through?|pg||
nt|cicus: unless @S cashes @SA first, not to get endplayed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A heart through would be sad if South has @H10xxx and @DAQxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but it might not work out very well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe @CJ lead to entice @H over @D     or is that way too deep|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I think the correct defence is @SA, then @CJ which should be suit-preference for hearts|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|bvdahl: very nice lead|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure declarer can handle this - if he draws trumps, he has too many black-suit losers|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: It is not unnormal after 1 and 2@H from N|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bvdahl: both E and W had a little extra for their bidding|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: and if he doesn't, he will lose too many club ruffs|pg||
nt|bvdahl: can't avoid @c ruff and then he is automatically down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|cicus: I this 2@S was a gross underbid|pg||
nt|bvdahl: S's balance let W show that he had a 2.5@s bid on the second round|pg||
nt|cicus: *think|pg||
nt|cicus: E had no option but pass that|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I don't necessarily agree that 2@s was an underbid. E is very strong, but swap his minor suits, and 4@s is not such a great game|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any to ..... it must be N who gave best help, but anyway a good player.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cicus: I think W was a K and the 5th spade stronger than minimum, and he has already denied as much as 8 points|pg||
nt|pelu: now 11|pg||
nt|cicus: but I agree, the game is not great|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|dburn: true also|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|dburn: well, if South had a diamond honour then North would almost surely have the queen of clubs|pg||

pc|d9|nt|bvdahl: difficult hand even without the @c lead|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: They are getting into a mess|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If declarer had led a heart from hand, West might have put in the queen, which kills the defence ... now there is less problem|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now South must play @HA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: whereas if North had both diamond honours, then South might have the queen of clubs, so this was probably the best line|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: never saw a NT ruffed yet|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: just as good|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bvdahl: ok, but take away E minor jacks. He will probably still bid 4 and that contract is not good|pg||

nt|bvdahl: is there a way to overtricks here?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Pass|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|ady: even with K@D more in west hand   slam down on a heart lead    |pg||

nt|dburn: Helgemo just bidding out his shape, but it looks as though Helness thought 3@d might have been fourth suit, which is why he didn't just bid 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphztd: S was not thinking before passing.|pg||
nt|dburn: South can't double - East is unlimited and North could have a Yarborough|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|dburn: but it looks as though Molberg thinks the same way as Helness about the auction - West doesn't have a firm diamond stop|pg||

nt|cicus: still, slam is not good|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: club finesse best shot   as if it happens to lose to doubleton   then another chance of defence being end played|pg||

nt|rodal f: Shud there be any reason for that? E balancing.|pg||
nt|cicus: no|pg||

pc|d2|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bvdahl: bit not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: When East shows out in diamonds it must with the odds to finesse spades, no?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bvdahl: has to play @d niw to avoid 2 down|pg||
nt|bvdahl: otherwise BS can get 4 trump tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: might take a club finesse|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|chick: a kib is suggesting that it is RKC, another that it is anticontrol :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not enough tricks, David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That only gives him 12|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a club in dummy  and later discard the hearts on spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 4@h was asking for aces, 4@S showed 0 or 3|pg||
nt|ady: more likely to rely on the spade suit  than take an early finesse|pg||
nt|bvdahl: BS - NS|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|toral5: hi|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|chick: nice suit to see your pard open 1@H :)|pg||
nt|ady: I agree   just drawing trumps and relying on spades   or taking a view of a spade finesse more likely|pg||
nt|bvdahl: We can all agree that Molbers play was not optimal. he needed the @s's 3-3|pg||
nt|dburn: South might volunteer 2@h if this comes back, I guess, but...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: And many thanks to my fellow commentators John and Gabor ... our heads have been spinning this set, but the comments have been good|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: the H's making late ground|pg||
nt|cicus: nice result for NSin OR|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: ...maybe not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hear hear - well it cerytainly didnt lack excitement|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: a quiet end to the day|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: not much else to do than play for spades 3-3 I guess|pg||
nt|cicus: a good set it was, surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the Norwegian Bridge Federation (Inger Hjellemarken)  for putting on this entertainment|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: flat|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: the poor minors prefer 5-2 to 5-4 - and in teasms|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: 3@D strikes me as a more honest bid, although it doesn't necessarily get you to game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thanks lads it was fun|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: would he not have go down if west had J@S doubleton the way it was played?|pg||
nt|ady: maybe  not     can carry on with spades  untill  west ruffs   then use A@D entry later|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and kibs as well for such interest|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|s8|nt|pelu: remember the 3@H om AX to J 10 9 x x x? in OR West in 3Nt after  2"H - 2@S by S - down 2-3 on a @s-lead - but N - onmn an very weak hand played @c up to AKJ - and 9 tricks -  S not ...|pg||
nt|pelu: happy :(|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|cicus: 2@D there must have promised 4 cards - an advantage of NF 1NT :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: this is the final hand of the session  I believe?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|s9|nt|bvdahl: but if spades are 3-3 or 4-2 with Kx, he might as well pull trumps, so it wasn't the best line by any means|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the next set is due to start in around 15 minutes|pg||

mc|9|nt|Walddk4: Correct|pg||
