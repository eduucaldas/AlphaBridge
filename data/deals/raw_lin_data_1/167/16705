nt|Walddk4: But they only need to be a member of a Norwegian club|pg||

nt|iceking: if you dont have that agreemeant i cant see how east can bid 3@Chere|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|iceking: and with S as passed hand and no action from north, it cant be a suprise pd has a strong hand|pg||

nt|iceking: has no play it seems to me as long as N ducks @C ten|pg||
nt|geot: Should go down on good defence|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: well, should declarer play for a defencive miss or his real chance?|pg||
nt|iceking: only real chance is KQ stiff of @C|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|bvdahl: 3@c makes if he decides to play S for Hx in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: to defeat 3Nt after @h to Q S have to play @CK!|pg||

nt|bvdahl: while a small spade handles a lot of the other distributions|pg||
nt|dburn: true, but you don't know how many tricks you need from spades - even if declarer has @sKQ98, it may work to lead high if you need only two tricks from the suit, but it won't work ...|pg||

pc|h2|nt|dburn: and if he doesn't, he will lose too many club ruffs|pg||
nt|bvdahl: can't avoid @c ruff and then he is automatically down|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|cicus: I this 2@S was a gross underbid|pg||
nt|bvdahl: S's balance let W show that he had a 2.5@s bid on the second round|pg||
nt|cicus: *think|pg||
nt|cicus: E had no option but pass that|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I don't necessarily agree that 2@s was an underbid. E is very strong, but swap his minor suits, and 4@s is not such a great game|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any to ..... it must be N who gave best help, but anyway a good player.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cicus: I think W was a K and the 5th spade stronger than minimum, and he has already denied as much as 8 points|pg||
nt|pelu: now 11|pg||
nt|cicus: but I agree, the game is not great|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|dburn: true also|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|dburn: well, if South had a diamond honour then North would almost surely have the queen of clubs|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I also think that E would raise to 4 on some hands that are weaker than the one he's got now|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

mb|p|nt|bvdahl: although they found and made 3 NT on the first hand in the open room also|pg||

mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: gee 4-card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and bid to 3NT in board 2 also - but here decl played N for Hx in @C after !A to Q|pg||
nt|pelu: @s to Q|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4@s is interesting here. Might be makeable even after 3 x clubs to ruff by defense|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|bvdahl: will probably play 1 NT x...|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@s, 4@S or 4@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jcomyn: responding vul on a 5-count  bit brave for me|pg||
nt|bvdahl: the natural @d lead is not very good, unfortunately...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Not 4-card majors per se, 1@H is 4+. HH play 5443|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but hardly any tricks EW. Looks difficult to avoid -2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Norwegian Standard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Not best bid Molberg hoped for|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cicus: I think it will go down, as 2 ruffs at dummy needed and no entry back to hand to draw the 3rd trump|pg||
nt|pelu: easy if ruffed from 3 card @S, but here from XX|pg||
nt|bvdahl: no, N can be squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|bvdahl: if he takes ruffing finesse in @d's|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: that assumed|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ady: even with the good lay in the majors  and good diamond holding   this likely to be down at least 1|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcomyn: wouldnt bet on it|pg||
nt|pelu: @C2 is singleton or Q 6 2, so no danger in playing @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: convention card EW: http://1833.bridge.no/Molberg_Aa.html|pg||
nt|dburn: if North had @cQ62, there would be some danger in playing @cK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, if itis Q62, a Q! ruff will set up J@c later|pg||

nt|vugraphztd: this is the standings, with the halftime result from match 5 included: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|dburn: although in terms of beating the contract, setting up a pitch on @cJ would probably not be fatal|pg||

nt|cicus: that's the best play|pg||
nt|bvdahl: still not obvisou how to make this|pg||

nt|bvdahl: now duck|pg||
nt|dburn: however, he might have done better to play a low diamond, although declarer could have stuck in the nine|pg||

nt|iceking: interesting bidding in closed room|pg||
nt|geot: Played by S it is a superb slam, 13 easy tricks if they dont take the @CA|pg||
nt|iceking: if they are playing puppet stayman, normal way over 3@S is 4@H as slamish in @S and 4@D as N bid is natural|pg||

pc|h5|pg||

nt|jbgood: Charlsen happier now?|pg||
nt|chick: hard to see why N didn't lead spades to begin with|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|s2|pc|c3|mc|9|nt|chick: exactly, could have still been set|pg||
nt|jbgood: so bye all - see you|pg||
nt|chick: bye everyone :)|pg||

nt|pelu: but could it cost to let @H7 ride to king?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|ady: part score hand     n/s  might buy it in spades|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Spot for non?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like 8 tricks NS and 9 EW|pg||
nt|bvdahl: x from W now, is that take out?|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: might be 10 EW, as some specs remind me|pg||
nt|rodal f: Shud there be any reason for that? E balancing.|pg||
nt|cicus: no|pg||
nt|dburn: West perhaps wondering why East didn't open the bidding|pg||
nt|cicus: the reason is this hand|pg||
nt|pelu: your bid: Pass or 3@H?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 8 or 9 in @s's NS I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: maybe not...|pg||
nt|chick: first someone has to bid them|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Aa had a chance to bid 1@s's but decided against it|pg||
nt|dburn: would bid 3@h, but could pass - don't understand double, which I think is penalty|pg||
nt|cicus: a matter of agreement, in the Robson book it is left open, I think|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: cant blame south for keeping out of the auction with a poor spade suit  and a singleton of partners suit overcall|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think 9 tricks is most likely here. a bit difficult to do everything you want to do to make 10|pg||
nt|pelu: also penalty for me|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bvdahl: seems difficult to make 1 NT as well|pg||
nt|cicus: but I play it as penalty, too|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I just asked the question :) The distrubution was good for a take out...|pg||
nt|rodal f: See 9 now if S duck first @H and or @D returned|pg||
nt|pelu: ok: fast X = penalty - slow X = take out :):)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|ady: west might play a low club after the diamonds    if so best if north plays Q@C    and clears spades    but not easy to see|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

mb|d!|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Well yes, but it will be exciting on a heart lead|pg||

nt|chick: provided entries aren't knocked out too soon|pg||
nt|ady: not on heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: yes... I guess it might ba the best line when you see @d's 4-0|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And that's about the only chance after West doubles 4@H as he did in the open room|pg||
nt|ady: somewhat unlikely|pg||
nt|bvdahl: same auction in the open room|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bvdahl: souths hand is massive now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Austberg's leap to 6@D was a tad lazy|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 1 down? NS will get 3@d tricks, and not possible to ruff more than max 3@h's|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|bvdahl: yes, not many losers, really|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bvdahl: that leap was not lazy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It was, but it may be winning|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR 4 @D-tricks|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ruffing finess in @c's is of no help|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|pelu: that @C10 only help decl |pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: swingy here|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|chick: What do you suppose 4@H means?  The suit I need help in?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: found the critical lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think Molberg makes it|pg||
nt|ady: see if he takes your line Roland|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think 4@h's shows slam interest|pg||
nt|bvdahl: kind of last train|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|bvdahl: bit not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: When East shows out in diamonds it must with the odds to finesse spades, no?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bvdahl: has to play @d niw to avoid 2 down|pg||
nt|bvdahl: otherwise BS can get 4 trump tricks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: might take a club finesse|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|chick: a kib is suggesting that it is RKC, another that it is anticontrol :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not enough tricks, David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That only gives him 12|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a club in dummy  and later discard the hearts on spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 4@h was asking for aces, 4@S showed 0 or 3|pg||
nt|ady: more likely to rely on the spade suit  than take an early finesse|pg||
nt|bvdahl: BS - NS|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|chick: nice suit to see your pard open 1@H :)|pg||
nt|ady: I agree   just drawing trumps and relying on spades   or taking a view of a spade finesse more likely|pg||
nt|bvdahl: We can all agree that Molbers play was not optimal. he needed the @s's 3-3|pg||
nt|dburn: South might volunteer 2@h if this comes back, I guess, but...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: the H's making late ground|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|bvdahl: but if spades are 3-3 or 4-2 with Kx, he might as well pull trumps, so it wasn't the best line by any means|pg||
