nt|vugraphzvz: a 1@S opening for most|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: as expected, Poddar Developers managed to bounce back reflecting their magnificient form|pg||
nt|subhranp: this one should be an interesting hand|pg||
nt|figo: E could not have had 2 clubs , mostly |pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzvz: NS may go too high here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: Kaustab might get in at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: k.bendre played at bbo as azad hind...& s.thak plays as thak|pg||
nt|figo: 2S , 3H by inference and 7 card for vul opening |pg||

nt|figo: strong club variety|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzvz: E's pass shd ensure they do not get too high|pg||

mb|3D|nt|sarkar_suk: goodevening all...hi rajesh|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: as a kib points out, 6N by S is the best spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: by flat, i dont mean the contract will make.. but same auction and opening lead at least...|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: double dummy NS can make upto 6C..|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|figo: would N take this 3H as D fit ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: NS likely to take the sac in 5d|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: & thats why he is playing on semis & i m sitting here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: i find 3@C too timid|pg||
mb|r|nt|subhranp: yes, they should have reached game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: easy to infer @H length and @D shortage|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: & that would be a very good sacrifice |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: a good result for DSM this... as 4@C makes|pg||
nt|subhranp: well, they might bid on to slam|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzvz: 3@S goes down only on @D lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: strange 6@H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: can count 12 tricks unless @S 5-2 and p is @S singleton|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: :)|pg||
nt|figo: what is he aiming at ?|pg||
nt|figo: should have shut the shop in 3NT |pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: now vijay is happy :)|pg||
