mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: Yes, although if I was a gambling person, I'd bet that they will both be flat|pg||
nt|pelu: and u are not: no bet?|pg||
nt|jbgood: sounds reasonable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: certainly no bet ...|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p!|nt|pelu: u knowBill - my bets are 1 coke - max :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm confident Molberg played 4@H correctly|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 2@s seems to show either @C OR the red suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: KO is the elder brother, so when his parents learned that another boy was coming they said OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (sorry)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And I think West's win of the @CK was hard to avoid|pg||
nt|jbgood: does 2@s mean @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: YESLEK, is my guess|pg||
nt|pelu: what is going on ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: not a lot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Try to spell Yeslek backwards|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: N is thinking and asking about the pass|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So this is reversed Kelsey (whatever that is)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jbgood: the alert of 3@c should confirm Yeslek|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I don't even know what un-reversed Kelsey is|pg||
nt|pelu: so 2@S = I have a red singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztc: W asks if he's on lead :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Any assistance for South on lead?  It's a bit of a horror problem|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: over 1Ny: Kelsye: 2@C = red short suit, 2@D = black short suit|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, when speaking about Kelsey it reminds me of the Backwash Squeeze we had from Japan yesterday. I think Bill was here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: a lovely hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed, brilliantly played by Ricco van Prooijen|pg||
nt|pelu: not the best lead - S would in the end get 2 @C-trick - evetning comes to the person who can wait :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: In my opinion, East's best strategy here is to try to peek|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, maybe the winning line is indicated ... use the entry for the diamond finesse then hope @HQ drops|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is doubleton heart queen more likely than singleton @DK?|pg||
nt|pelu: after the overcall OK know almost the distribution - for sure @DK in N|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d4|nt|pelu: sorry - not for sure - but with odds|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bjacobs: This is a suit-distribution odds question that you don't see every day|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Does South have @Hxx @DK or @HQx @Dx?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He knows he has 3 red cards|pg||
nt|pelu: better chance to find the missing H by 2 cards than singleton|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Meanwhile South could play a diamond here ... gifting declarer the finesse and giving him the opportunity to finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What a coup that would be|pg||
nt|jbgood: should he accept the Greek gift?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's been pointed out to me that this Greek gift would not work ... as North will then be squeezed by the run of the spades into revealing the setup|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: A show-up squeeze effectively|pg||

nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|cicus: this is match 6, half of which was played yesterday evening|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Baard |pg||
nt|bvdahl: Kippe also won the same championship with Baard Olav Aasan in 2008, I believe|pg||
nt|ady: part score to start|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20    e/w around 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: seems like we have some problems here - the cards you see are not the same as the players actually have|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, that will make things interesting....|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: we are trying to fix it|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate it when that happens :(|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: sorry to say, but there are som serious trouble here. The players have to start playing now, but we still do not hav the right files of cards to the BBO.|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: you can see the result from board no 1 in the bridge movie. 1st board NS bid 5@H after EW fought to the 5-level in @c. Made 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|sybarra: is TD looking for files? |pg||
nt|sybarra: what do they do for hand records? |pg||
nt|vugraphztd: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: It looks like the cards the players play have actually been played before.|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: so the card file you see here is correct, but the boards have been duplicated after an old card file!!|pg||
nt|bvdahl: wow, so no one bothered to double chack....|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: At one table a player said he recognizes the cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Looks like the cards were played the first weekend of Norwegian Premier League in october 2010.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so, they have to start over. Suggest thay take the cards from the last round tomorrow and play them now|pg||
nt|bvdahl: gives them time to make new duplicates for tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like wrong file used to deal the cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Høyland 3 and Midt Trøndelag2  9 so fare: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
mb|p|nt|bernix: hi folks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bvdahl:  3 vs  7 after the first weekend here and the highest placed team with a decent lead at the half|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Gabor and Bård. Here we go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But they only need to be a member of a Norwegian club|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wish I could describe how beautiful the sunrise is here in DC |pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Now we have the right duplicates|pg||
nt|rodal f: A weak NY from S?|pg||
nt|rodal f: *NT|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I am guessing the final contract will be 2@s in North|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi there|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: So the rules must be changed first if they want to bar foreigners|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Bernard.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that an undo?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: I know, but there were still some who didn't like it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so maybe they just took the wrong suitcase :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or maybe they prefer clubs :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8 points?|pg||
nt|bernix: let's check the cc|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Ns play weak 1NT openings in some positions |pg||
nt|yo_yo: now frank, how old are you?|pg||
nt|roswolf: there was a lot of entertainment yesterday - lets hope for a repeat today|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Right u are Roland.|pg||
nt|cicus: gm John|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello John, Gábor and Al|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 52 ish?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Both playing natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: one moment, will look for CC|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS plays natural with transfers after 1@C opening I believe|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: EW as well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: suppose if declarer  gets everything wrong  could go down|pg||
nt|cicus: a somewhat lucky 3NT to begin with|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hehehe:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8 points for 1NT opener, I have never known that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's the range?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S or DBL?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: and our operator, Kristian|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Welcome|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ok, looks like we can finally get back to watching bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: now we are back, and now with right duplicates at the tables|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see W sitting for 3 nt |pg||
nt|bvdahl: Kippe is probably wuite optimistic about beating this one, but not so much about beating 4@h, so no x|pg||
nt|bvdahl: quite, and please forgive my typos.... :)|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe a stretched 9-11 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: you don't need to break the rules to create controversy ;)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as me in Romania|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)  Prefere to handle the @C color as 6 card. But N didn't give up|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good case to be made for a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|cicus: let's say rather lucky instead|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Kristian|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd have doubled then corrected to @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is the 2nd half of the match that started last evening.|pg||
nt|roswolf: west cant really do anything much which was why dbl was possible|pg||
nt|cicus: Iwonder if W expects such a huge hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bvdahl: if @c lead here, declearer needs to duck|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Peter.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and now there are no problems on this layout|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Hello Mr. Lund :)|pg||
nt|cicus: N has a strong suit, an entry and still cannot enjoy enough tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Home it seems. Only @C lead to beat it, if I'm not wrong|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @c lead can be ducked|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and you can deny S entry later|pg||
nt|ady: over board on a part score hand     have a chance in 4@H if 2 diamonds are not cashed early|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@C=8-12 and ask|pg||
nt|roswolf: no he wont|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hae me doubts|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not so easy to see a reasonable way to get that many things wrong|pg||
nt|ady: after losing a diamond finesse  declarer needs to search for 9th trick    possible to miss guess in hearts and spades to lose 4 more tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: is @D lead easy from N?  I dont think so |pg||
nt|sybarra: may see a @H lead|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @c lead, and I think it gives decl a chance|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cicus: spec suggested a 3rd hand 1@S opening by S|pg||
nt|bvdahl: nice one|pg||
nt|ady: found it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cicus: certainly has its merits|pg||
nt|rodal f: Updated resultlist: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: i think it poor bridge knowing there are 9 spades missing|pg||
nt|bvdahl: good contract, should make comfortably even if N might feel a little short in trump after a while|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: NS play relay presision. Convention card (in norwegian) here: http://1833.bridge.no/Berg_Kippe.html|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but with 3-3 split he has no proble,s|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|cicus: it turnes out a good decision as no game is on|pg||
nt|sharkey: I agree with x - 2 NT an option?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: West is Espen Erichsen who plays for England now|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, I thought of that but with such single stopper better spades would be needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing real strength in a passout position is difficult and should be discussed a lot by serious aspiring partnerships|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphztd: convention card (in norwegian) EW: http://1833.bridge.no/Eide_Hoy_Hoy_Hoy.html|pg||

nt|yo_yo: Lives in London |pg||
nt|rodal f: Jepp, Kath.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bvdahl: 4 top tricks now. Will have to take @c finess to make only one down, but shouldn't bee too difficult on the bidding and after that lead|pg||

nt|Walddk5: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the version of Viking Club they play is different from what was described in Groetheims book|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Must be a strong league with Helness-Helgemo 6th|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c7|nt|ady: no problem now    got over the first hurdle|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bvdahl: just made, ut seems. Good start for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: and W knows the ht K  is off |pg||
nt|bvdahl: and 2 down if he takes @h finesse|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: It must be hard to feel nationalistic pride for a win when some of your players aren't even nationals|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bvdahl: yes, for sure @hK is offside here|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yo_yo: well he's such a fine player we dont mind|pg||
nt|chick: hopefully some day we will get rid of all the nation-oriented structure in the bridge world, and just let the best players compete as people :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure @CA and next.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will come Cornelia, will come:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Espen will be playing for England in March - just checked the EBU calendar|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: If any specs have links from 2nd div some people are qurious. Send me.|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ady: now a seeing squeeze on north|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bvdahl: show up squeeze against North when W runs the hearts now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cicus: hard to avoid 3NT unless E can show his @S shortness|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c3|pc|d9|nt|cicus: and in this case it would lead to a missed game...|pg||

nt|vugraphztd: 2nd div C: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div2C|pg||
nt|bernix: depends on system & style. if playing aggressive openings and 2@d as moral forcing i agree with 2@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: If so shudnt S bid 3 NT or 3 @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: lokks like they did not think the same way about the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|cicus: but a reasonable contract reached|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H probably but they have chickened out -quite tightly|pg||
nt|sharkey: fint om du korrigerer og forklarer :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: rightly i meant|pg||
nt|cicus: in fact this may even be too high on a club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is slight favorite here|pg||
nt|sharkey: a day for "modesty" seems like - based on the first two boards...|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: TD at the table now|pg||
nt|cicus: I bet on a club lead as all others unattractive|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes yesterday enterprise was the theme|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree|pg||
nt|cicus: well, clubs are not attractive either|pg||
nt|cicus: against 2NT you tend to open passive|pg||
nt|roswolf: the rules say west must lead something!|pg||
nt|roswolf: a low heart is ok - 4th highest strikes again|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: yes    good point    this might still go down|pg||
nt|ady: yes   also true|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Any problems to get link's when we have Kristian here? TKX Kristian:)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm that would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: wont lead @H9...|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: looks like S thought 2@S was slam interest, but N explained that 2nt was a bid that do not want to axcept a game try|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: in all respects except 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: the contract has already improved from declarer's point of view|pg||
nt|roswolf: sensible shift|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: TD said that the only right W has is to get right explanation - a correction might be an alternative after ending the board, he said as well|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cicus: needing a finesse + trumps not 4-0|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bvdahl: but this line accounts for KQx in S, of course|pg||
nt|cicus: small from hand as well|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but presumably play small from hand to play N for Hx, so you will not play @c to T later|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bvdahl: no squeeze, he needs to rff the diamonds|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonde rhow the TD can force N not to pass 2NT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcomyn: miracle workers Hand H but no this time|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cicus: yes, it makes :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: you need more than just the finesse don't you?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bvdahl: and now there are 10 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: % for @CQ off so how will Kippe handle it. Hook or try to drop the Q?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|cicus: true, long @HQ does not help|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bvdahl: now it is game over. Just made and a very good score EW|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: is e not squeezed|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: now the bad news  or is it good news|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: spec suggested 6@D has chances     but no chance    throw in wont help   ruff and discard still does not help      needed club finesse for that to work to discard a spade|pg||
nt|bvdahl: In mt opinion, Helgemo was a bit too eager on this bid. Helness could hardly hold better cards, so I understand whu he bid 6  @s|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkey: yes - due to the misunderstanding they have landed in an apparent superior contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: Probably West can control the club suit in that scenario|pg||
nt|ady: well done    fortunate contract  spades 2-2  and clubs playing for 1 loser and not able to guess wrong with  jackj of clubs appearing 2nd round|pg||
nt|sybarra: bridge is easy game (NOT)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: cinsiderably easier when you see all the cards like we do :)|pg||
nt|cicus: such thing happen|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: board 3 fell on the floor - jumps to bord 4|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: by awarding a corrected score but that doesnt seem to make bridge sense -you are allowed to pass forcing bids if you want to|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - assuming you know the system|pg||
nt|roswolf: life isnt fair|pg||
nt|rodal f: AND by screen its hard to look at any bodylanguage.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|nt|bernix: should make 3 from here|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cicus: a double sq might develop with clubs as the double threat|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|cicus: oh no, blacks are badly placed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hmm, I hate to be picky, but isn't West discarding spades after dummy?|pg||
nt|cicus: have corrected myself|pg||
nt|bjacobs: sorry, yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bernix: 2 i mean|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: with at least 8 red cards and 2 spades with W there will never be any drop of the @cQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Frank|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: anyway, North is evidently thinking about squeezes as well, in quest for the vital overtrick|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
pc|s2|nt|bvdahl: it's a game you want to be in, and I would expect the board to be flat, in the end|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This was not such an easy game to reach, but both E/W's got some assistance from their opponents|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Personally, I think both Norths bid too much|pg||
nt|pelu: the 3@D = ? - but sometimes the support is just what S need to bid 5@D over 4@S - but ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: vestfold won i 06, with a slightly different line up: http://bridge.no/var/fckeditor/bridgeno/file/PDF/resultater/Turneringshistorikk/SM/SM_2006.pdf |pg||

nt|bjacobs: If North had passed 3@C, it might well have been passed out.  But the 3@D bid helped East ... it indicated that West really was short in diamonds, and was therefore likely to have ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3 spades|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: Sometimes, with an ultra-weak hand and 3-card support, it's best not to support partner, because if you do, the opponents are clued in to your degree of fit|pg||

nt|bvdahl: stopped in 3@s on the other table, so 6 IMP's for Hordaland|pg||
nt|sybarra: my  guess will be flat |pg||
nt|bernix: no fit - no game|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 was right. Not @H but ruff a @C. But, not match:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: pd screwed up again?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pelu: no @CJ is entry to 5.@H - @C back defeat|pg||
nt|ady: 10 easy tricks for e/w 3NT    should be a quick hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Fit EW here at least, but a nice sac NS|pg||
mb|d!|nt|yo_yo: some would open that 3 or 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: true gabor - but i am still convinced that this is just the rub of the green|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rodal f: Can it become a mine for EW?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: including me|pg||
nt|bernix: put me in for 3@h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bvdahl: no, @c jack is not an enty because E has Qx so S can deny the entry if he wants|pg||
nt|bvdahl: might make 11 with a spade lead from S|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4 @s again. A bit more fortunate ditribution this time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now south wishes he had opened more @H|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4S|nt|jcomyn: heavens to betsy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: pretty timid stuff there|pg||
nt|cicus: that's why I dislike nonforcing NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: anyway, a @H must be ruffed and therre are still 2 clubs to lose|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but the play was @c to Q and K - and here @C back defeat|pg||
nt|bjacobs: actually, 1NT may well be a worse contract than 4@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree completely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: with North's entry gone|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 11 tricks on bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: looks automatic. S has no other lead, I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: keeps partnership harmony to lead his suit|pg||
nt|bvdahl: If pd is bigger than me, I always lead his suit. If not, I might consider an alternative....|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: lotsa points but no pushover|pg||
nt|ady: this may be tough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems to have done the right thing anyway going 5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. But a nice shot at the dark.|pg||
nt|chick: Well, regardless of how it played out, I like the 1@H opening|pg||
nt|bernix: again it pays off to neglect a 4/4 fit with a 7-bagger|pg||
nt|bernix: 7411 is that called a "swan" in america, chick?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it eau de cologne also?|pg||
nt|bernix: yes because 4711 was the ZIP of cologne|pg||
nt|roswolf: west seems to have bid in rage|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: lucky pd has 5 @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: but has found pard with some useful bits and pieces|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bvdahl: now this was not the best lead.....|pg||
nt|pelu: if @H back in on @CK u just ruff a @H, take @DQ and discard a @C and hand is high|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bvdahl: not breaking too good here. Natural to play on hearts|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cicus: he expected some values, 1@S was a free bid |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that IS SCARY|pg||
nt|cicus: could have been 4 though|pg||
nt|roswolf: i suppose the @S 8gave the suit some solidity|pg||
nt|cicus: as clubs come in easily and trumps friendly, this will not be tough|pg||

nt|sharkey: Also lives in London I believe|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|cicus: @D is not high then|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: anyone agree 1NT here is daft|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "conservative"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you describe it as "daft", you are going to run out of adjectives when something really stupid comes along|pg||
nt|cicus: I  think it is useful to have a bid at least for hearts in an inviting hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcomyn: some masochist set this one|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I was talking about a @h back instead of @d j|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup the vul game bonus justifys the bold approach|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: Why that agressive lead from S? If she belive it down a @H often use to be a good lead.|pg||

nt|bernix: if he returns a diamond|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||

pc|s2|nt|bvdahl: not easy for defense to get to 7|pg||

nt|ady: my money on 7 tricks for declarer|pg||

nt|sharkey: Kib confirms Espen lives in London and married to a lovely English girl and two daughters|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: that would be ducked of course and declarer may be forced to duck @HK later, to retain the entry|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|bvdahl: have a friend here who wants to play 6@d on this hand :) I guess he's used to getting favorable leads :)|pg||

pc|s7|nt|bvdahl: welcome|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|cicus: alternatively, E may try a spade, and when ducked another one|pg||

nt|sharkey: Erlend Skjetne is one of the up and coming stars in Norwegian Bridge - barely into his 20s as far as I know|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cicus: I presume their 2@H is game forcing for which N has not the values|pg||

nt|bvdahl: the previous game was probably better than this one, but now it happened to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty memory going! |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bvdahl: seems that this will be a doube score for Midt Trøndelag|pg||
nt|cicus: if S forces dummy he will come to an extra trump trick but that won't set the contract|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: It does seem strange.  If 2@H is GF (2/1), then you really need 1NT to be forcing|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|cicus: I agree|pg||
nt|bjacobs: to allow invitational hands to be bid out|pg||

nt|bvdahl: that's one way to do it, of course :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: But more risky this way|pg||
nt|bernix: well done|pg||
nt|sharkey: S may place this in 2@D|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphztd: some cards dropped out |pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C transfer to 2@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah science to the rescue|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bvdahl: with shoret spade in dummy, small @s is probably the best lead|pg||
nt|bvdahl: you will need some help from pd regardless....|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but it worked out. 3 @h's is probably one down|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: what do I know.... ;)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The team names are counties|pg||
nt|dburn: was wondering who this Midt-Trondelag was|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I still stand by my statement. If declearer holds KQ98 in spadesm you will have a hard time to raise them regardless|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe but thats a hefty 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Berg was thinking about raising to game|pg||
nt|rodal f: There will be time for a @H swich|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: Only 10 tricks in OR...?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: the J is right if decl has KQ9|pg||
nt|dburn: true, but he might have bid 3NT with @sKQ9 alone, when a low spade lead would be a pity|pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like a fairly easy 11|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may open North's hand 1 NT (upgrade?) - 2@D being the superior strain|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: UPS|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bvdahl: 2 x clubs shortens declearer, so he didn't take any spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess you have to think about what you would open with W |pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: be back in a mo folks|pg||
nt|ady: only 10 tricks  because of club lead   and tap in trumps   could not afford spade finesse when in 4@H|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sharkey: As we see only 5 tricks in NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bvdahl: I would usually open 1 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is not a pattern I open 1 nt |pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, you have a difficult bid on the 2nd round if you open 1 @c|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: no spade lead may well defeat 3NT if defence is sharp later|pg||
nt|rodal f: Lot used in Norway NT opening as this|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bvdahl: so missing the spade position could lead to 3 down, but fortunately for decleared, the odds are in favor of playing S for the Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: why cant I just bid 2 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: or 3 even|pg||
nt|sybarra: if pard can not move,  we are not going any where|pg||
nt|sybarra: just will restate,  just not a pattern I open with 1 nt|pg||
nt|bvdahl: No, I don't agree. Many 9 point hands where pd will pass over 2 @c where 3 NT is cold|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I am sure that 1 NT is best in the long run|pg||
nt|bernix: you're sue you want him to represent your country yo_yo ? :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kaplan Rubens Hand Evaluator says North worth 14.75  [doesn't like Q]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: check out http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bvdahl: yes, but it is a matter of what is right most of the time. J is right when decl has exactly KQ9|pg||
nt|bvdahl: while a small spade handles a lot of the other distributions|pg||
nt|dburn: true, but you don't know how many tricks you need from spades - even if declarer has @sKQ98, it may work to lead high if you need only two tricks from the suit, but it won't work ...|pg||
nt|dburn: to lead low|pg||
nt|ady: this may well be a much needed swing for Rogaland|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I agree that on this auction there is a good case for a low spade|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: maybe but i cant see anyone leading anything but SJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well that was unlike him|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bvdahl: since he can cope with 4-2 distribution in that case|pg||
nt|ady: might get spade wrong when south shows with 4 hearts  though normally best odds is to play south for queen where you can score 4 tricks even on bad split|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so after predicting hthey would not find 6@h's I now predict they will make it :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: slightly off-centre to double rather than bid 2@s with the South cards|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe you should not pass a strong NT with 2 aces and vulnerable at teams|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East is rubbing it in, allowing plenty of overtricks, to make N/S feel bad|pg||
nt|bvdahl: watch me go 0-2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: making only 4 seems a trick too few (or so)|pg||
nt|ady: OR  auction   1@H    2@H    4@H    seems they play sing raise in majors constructive|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcomyn: end of defence|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bvdahl: your most likely game is 3 NT, and opening 1 NT will bring you closer to that. Also has some pre emptive valu against opponents major suits|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Else u get to many problems to show ure hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bvdahl: As we mentioned earlier, declearer cannot afford to take @s finess after the lead of 2 x @c|pg||

mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Bill is suggesting whisky I presume, but you can't afford that in Norway|pg||
nt|bjacobs: or maybe hemlock|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But seriously, North's move was a very good one |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are thinking about fremoving the  r  in 'Norway'|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: who are 'they'?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: First of all, no post-mortem.  Secondly, it's a chance to "re-boot"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The tourists, TorO :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: was it unwise of N to double with 2 aces next door? Might he not have understood that he would get a non-spade lead ?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bjacobs: I bet he thought he was in a forcing pass situation|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: But perhaps South disagreed, and thought this was a Lightner double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Tøndel took it as Lightner|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: If only they had not read so many books|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|sharkey: *Vestfold|pg||

nt|cicus: 5@C?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: or 3NT?|pg||
nt|cicus: I know I wiould bid 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 4@S along the way?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you want a safe game, then it's 3NT|pg||
nt|cicus: 3NT even better|pg||
nt|cicus: but I know they won't let it play|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be entertaining|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: Charlsen wants to play 5@C doubled|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West could stymie him though ... that's no longer an automatic 4@S bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hmm i dont understand their evaluations at all|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bvdahl: 4@s|pg||
nt|cicus: thin game here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trøndelag is a section of Norway about 1/3 of the way up - some of the local dialects there are very hard to understand for us "outsiders"|pg||
nt|roswolf: A REAL MAN'S BID|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rodal f: X from W and + come for NS?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: X=3@S|pg||
nt|dburn: West will have to do something positive now|pg||
nt|cicus: now that's a surprise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North bid again??|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might be prudent to keep going|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But of course, it would be a phantom|pg||
nt|bvdahl: wow, that is some kind of 3@s opening|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but leads to std contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some frown on weak 2 with two Aces...|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now who has the better judgment or luck!?|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: They play constructive 2-openings in major, something like 8-11|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think W will sac view the Vul game bonus|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|roswolf: west may just axe|pg||
nt|cicus: axe but regret it|pg||
mb|6D|nt|pelu: can West now jump to 3@s?|pg||
nt|ady: surely would have got to game  if east had passed    west likely open 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: many "old fashioned" players would not with jxxx of hts |pg||
nt|bvdahl: a but unusual by W to not transfer to @h's here|pg||
nt|bernix: seems like they're playing good and bad 2-level preempts|pg||
nt|roswolf: he might be thinking if insurance|pg||
mb|6H|nt|cicus: I wonder why N found attractive to bid on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It does seem quite undisciplined|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe 4@C has implied willingness?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally 4@C says  "I know what to do if they bid game"   [not YOU]|pg||
nt|cicus: S has a clear X now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "clear" eh?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's wondering about 6@S I reckon|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: flip-flop North's @S & @D and it is clear-cut 6@C        of course that would mean this deck has 15 @S but ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I agree, he cannot possibly know whether diamonds are controlled, and East is likely to lead the suit|pg||
nt|cicus: not only has he 21/" tricks in @Hs, trump ace but @DJxxx may be a nuisance as well|pg||
nt|cicus: 2 1/2|pg||
nt|cicus: and then I do nozt count on a @C trick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too difficult to make a decision other than x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point -- must worry about what to say to Committee|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it's often hard to think straight in this situation ...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's lebensohl by east|pg||
nt|roswolf: of|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: yes, he should have|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he might have... but he will get another chance|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some help from NS?|pg||
nt|cicus: is this true?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: hence the statement 'std contract' :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: he obviously wanted to play the hand himself..... :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would transfer, my hand is hopeless except in hts|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, South's bid is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|pelu: S = 911|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Hoftaniska gone to the toilet while his pd was thinking. still not back|pg||
nt|cicus: Defence is likely to be @CK overtaken, @HK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or overtaken and a diamond through?|pg||
nt|cicus: unless @S cashes @SA first, not to get endplayed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A heart through would be sad if South has @H10xxx and @DAQxx|pg||
nt|bvdahl: should be fairly easy 8 by tuffing a @c in dummy|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ruffing|pg||
mb|d|nt|bvdahl: the difference is that the contract is played from E instead of W|pg||
nt|yo_yo: showing a weak hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but it might not work out very well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe @CJ lead to entice @H over @D     or is that way too deep|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I think the correct defence is @SA, then @CJ which should be suit-preference for hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: very nice lead|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure declarer can handle this - if he draws trumps, he has too many black-suit losers|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, sure of that @SA?|pg||
nt|cicus: of course someone has to stop sacrificing|pg||
nt|sharkey: who's sacrificing?|pg||
nt|cicus: S thinks now N is void of @Ds|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D looks a daft bid but is LAWFUL and in practice might have saved a bushel of imps|pg||
nt|cicus: and a @D lead will give the contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: It is not unnormal after 1 and 2@H from N|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bvdahl: both E and W had a little extra for their bidding|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: and if he doesn't, he will lose too many club ruffs|pg||
nt|bvdahl: can't avoid @c ruff and then he is automatically down|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|cicus: look, the most expensive doubles I have seen recently|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cicus: I this 2@S was a gross underbid|pg||
nt|bvdahl: S's balance let W show that he had a 2.5@s bid on the second round|pg||
nt|cicus: *think|pg||
nt|cicus: E had no option but pass that|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I don't necessarily agree that 2@s was an underbid. E is very strong, but swap his minor suits, and 4@s is not such a great game|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any to ..... it must be N who gave best help, but anyway a good player.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: now he might get 12|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cicus: I think W was a K and the 5th spade stronger than minimum, and he has already denied as much as 8 points|pg||
nt|pelu: now 11|pg||
nt|cicus: but I agree, the game is not great|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bvdahl: sorry, no|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: true also|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bvdahl: I'm just saying that 2@s is not a gross underbid :)|pg||

pc|h6|nt|jcomyn: so perhaspsd 3nt better  that auld 4-4 thing again|pg||

nt|sharkey: hmmm...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if South had a diamond honour then North would almost surely have the queen of clubs|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I also think that E would raise to 4 on some hands that are weaker than the one he's got now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bvdahl: difficult hand even without the @c lead|pg||

pc|hT|nt|jcomyn: dont worry bill i have a few more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: per 2008 notes   PASS = 6-8 HCP|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In 2011, allowing for inflation, it's 7-9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South taking time out to say a few choice words to partner?|pg||
nt|cicus: we don't know who was at guilt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or might they take 300 insteed|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Not best bid Molberg hoped for|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cicus: I think it will go down, as 2 ruffs at dummy needed and no entry back to hand to draw the 3rd trump|pg||
nt|pelu: easy if ruffed from 3 card @S, but here from XX|pg||
nt|bvdahl: no, N can be squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|bvdahl: if he takes ruffing finesse in @d's|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2 NT is forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: X is lead a spade pard (the way I play it)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Butler: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/butler.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|sharkey: Espen has to switch to something....|pg||
nt|cicus: well, he might just as well continue @Hs, they are soon high anyway|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: that assumed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, if 1NT showed a minor, it doesn't seem ridiculous.  But 4@C ...|pg||
nt|cicus: but no tragedy with 650 available to EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: probably n thought it was both minors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it could certainly be a system mixup|pg||
nt|bvdahl: undoubtedly asking for spades|pg||
nt|ady: can make this     rise with A@S     run the 6 hearts with king on side and play a diamond|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, looks right|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bvdahl: Need to raise the 5th spade to make 4@d, but entries to actually cash it will be a problem|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 times @H and problems to set up the @S?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: don't need to force with @h's because declearer needs to ruff one to have any chance to make 10|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @cA and a @c works well|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or playing @d|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: even with the good lay in the majors  and good diamond holding   this likely to be down at least 1|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt bet on it|pg||
nt|pelu: @C2 is singleton or Q 6 2, so no danger in playing @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: convention card EW: http://1833.bridge.no/Molberg_Aa.html|pg||
nt|dburn: if North had @cQ62, there would be some danger in playing @cK|pg||
nt|ady: club lead works out better     cant reach the east hand to finesse hearts|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: And it IS a tragedy, because they are in 1100 territory|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: Right u are. So -1|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bvdahl: well, if itis Q62, a Q! ruff will set up J@c later|pg||
nt|pelu: or play @C10|pg||
nt|rodal f: Small?|pg||
nt|sharkey: S doesn't know that|pg||
nt|sharkey: that @Hs are coming in|pg||
nt|cicus: S knows @Hs are either A82 behind him or the 8 is now single|pg||
nt|cicus: he can lead the J without risk|pg||
nt|cicus: he has the precious 3|pg||
nt|rodal f: How Gabor?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bvdahl: nice|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, it is right, so the x probably gave them the contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I could find club lead from KJ9x |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphztd: ! NT explained both sides as one Major suit and one minor suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So not a system problem.  Just a ... daft ... bid by North|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: some switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: As predicted B19=|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: and pard X |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it would have been OK even if declarer had the king|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: this is the standings, with the halftime result from match 5 included: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|dburn: although in terms of beating the contract, setting up a pitch on @cJ would probably not be fatal|pg||
nt|bvdahl: without the x, I lead a club every time|pg||
nt|ady: this should be a nice swing for Hordaland   4@H should not make even on a spade lead |pg||
nt|cicus: he is sure to develop a @H trick if he leads one|pg||
nt|sharkey: he listened to Gabor..|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|cicus: that's the best play|pg||
nt|bvdahl: still not obvisou how to make this|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|sharkey: agree - no other attractive alternative anyway|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cicus: N helping to take the finesse?|pg||
mc|8|nt|dburn: well, he couldn't play a heart back - he wanted to remove dummy's entry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y, but some signals. Still when we comment u always say how or why if anything is 100%|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphztd: *look|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Hordaland also copied the thin @s game on board 5|pg||
nt|rodal f: I understand. EW been lucky.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be interesting |pg||
nt|rodal f: Could have done by play A and a ruff, Not AK. But 3 time @H promote trick EW. As @C also would do|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 6@h has a shot here....|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bvdahl: but I am guessing they will stop in 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: how to get there from here?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|bvdahl: NS will probably end up in 2 @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: hat that bid with a singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe just being in 4 is fine|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: The opening could be 4414/4405/3415/4315|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not so easy. North didn't like Kxxx opposite pd's short @d|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was a hard man to get some meanings. They came:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: LOL|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: where now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and W finding it "amusing" |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: trump lead best|pg||
nt|bvdahl: sure|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think 2@s makes|pg||
nt|ady: likely to make in spite of bad trump split|pg||
nt|bvdahl: at least  4 minor tricks from the top, and looks like 4 @s tricks as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: singleton spades is not unusual when responding 1NT to 1@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h and h bidding far too aggresive even looking fo imps|pg||
nt|rodal f: At least a new coffe bord came:)|pg||
nt|cicus: this won't go down|pg||
nt|bvdahl: is there a way to overtricks here?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Board 21 was interesting in the OR.  South did bid 3NT after 3@C-3@S, then when West bid 4@S, North cleverly went on to 4NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT was OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: wont get them this wasy|pg||
nt|rodal f: CC for NS: http://1833.bridge.no/Berg_Kippe.html|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a better reason|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: frankly, for a bad split all the rest of the cards sit farely well|pg||

nt|sharkey: My kind of bidding|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: never mind the quality.... |pg||

nt|cicus: was 2@C any invitational hand?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcomyn: kinda reminds me of monty pythons silly walking school|pg||
nt|cicus: I am told yes, thanks spec|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: convention card says; 2@c "any invitational"|pg||
nt|cicus: then maybe 2@S would have allowed some leeway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well now how do you come to terms with the earlier 1NT compared to this loony 2c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Got some help to|pg||
nt|roswolf: simple but effective?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see it|pg||
nt|bernix: a  minor suit lead is unlikely to gain against the given auction, so lead your longer major |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|bvdahl: not the best lead now. declearer will be able to ruff 2 @s, at least|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but v hard to lead H from K6|pg||
nt|ady: might have been better to go up with K@D  and play spade from dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 1nt would have been forcing relay|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That was N/S|pg||
nt|cicus: there must be some subtle points we don't know|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no i am talking about the 1nt with a 6-card h suit and 10 hcp|pg||
nt|cicus: and Bill is watching|pg||
nt|bjacobs: right that was N/S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This was E/W|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|sharkey: Makes with the right view in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont fancy that somehow|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: maybe they are afraid of not get enough time, but it should not be problematic - the clock says 1:14 left of this round, and 9 boards left to be played|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: I was looing specifically at ak of @H|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2 x @c's now and small @d looks natural|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or just a high @s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: declarer doesnt know who has the long @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he probably does now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: This was just thirst for the vulnerable game, and actually, declarer can get quite close to it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very amusing recently when from the same holding against a slam a youing lady led H5 and when asked how she found such a devastating lead said - I play the eeny-meeny-miny- mo ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: system|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: On board 3, where Berg opened 1@H and played 5@H X -2, Grøtheim in OR opened 4@H and played 4@H doubled -1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: well maybe you and I should not guess much (no casinos for us)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bvdahl: I think all ways lead to rome there|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bernix: he knows once he discards a spade|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8@H signal for @S |pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 4@H undoubled, sorry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 9|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: no endplay or squeezes, so looks like a boring 10|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He has to play the spades for no losers, which is not too likely, but is technically possible|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North had a tough opening lead and went wrong|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: maybe north didnt know after all who had the long @H|pg||
nt|bernix: if he believes east has the long hearts he should have discarded a @d from dummy shouldnt he|pg||
nt|bernix: do i miss a point there ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this may be a 2 way shot, if @S isnt covered, go for @D finesse|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cicus: @S10 i smore likely to be with N if he has 3 spades|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: time flies in Trøndelag...|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|ady: now get club right  |pg||
nt|ady: may play K@D  and discard a club|pg||
nt|cicus: has declarer a reliable count?|pg||

pc|h9|nt|rodal f: Next?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but ducking with AKJ in @h was a tad curious|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: how long is the permitted time 2hrs 30mins for 16 bds?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: indeed |pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: I don't think there is an "right" or "wrong" way to play this spade suit ... he just has to guess|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bernix: not good play in my opinion|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|vugraphztc: E takes a sip of coffee before considering his problem here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Anyway, 3NT by East (I assume) and South will need to defend well to beat it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphztc: gl vs india :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On a heart lead, he has to grab the first spade, and play diamonds pretty much from the top|pg||
nt|pelu: almost impossible to find the @D-lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Low diamond is OK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As long as North does not win the ace|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: But a low diamond won't work here as a switch - it has to be jack or king (followed up by the other honour)|pg||
nt|pelu: the lead 99 out of 100 would try - but still only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a pretty tough defence to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Aa will get another shot and will take it I predict|pg||

nt|Walddk2: OK, a coke|pg||
nt|jbgood: y, S will get the problem when he is in in the spade ace in trick 2|pg||

pc|s2|nt|bvdahl: 4@d - 4@h next bids?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W back in |pg||
nt|bvdahl: maybe on a @d lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: was 3@D  a transfer or natural?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bvdahl: a fairly undramatic 4@s here|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 10 on a @h lead. 11 ptherwise|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or getting the @s ruff, of course|pg||
nt|rodal f: for -2|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cicus: now the problem seem to be to locate which 2 aces are missing|pg||
nt|bernix: but problems locating a 5/4 major fit :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Skjetne had all quacks and wudnt enter the fray|pg||
nt|roswolf: is this a triumph or a disaster for n/s|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes....|pg||
nt|sharkey: on a good day it wud make|pg||
nt|roswolf: and on this Sunday perhaps not|pg||
nt|cicus: on a club continuation EW will promote themdsleves  a trump trick|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bvdahl: uh-oh|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and a @h will almost certainly be lead|pg||
nt|dburn: this seems a bit anarchic|pg||
nt|jcomyn: forcing for imps andlosing em instead|pg||
nt|pelu: yasy to bid if S open 1@S - then 4@D (void) by N|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 5@d now will show void, I guess|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and deny @c A|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so S bids 6@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Kippe not helping by bidding 3 @C|pg||
nt|bvdahl: this is likely to score 200|pg||
nt|ady: missed game    again on slender values|pg||
nt|rodal f: tkx Kristian|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bvdahl: or this way|pg||
nt|cicus: pleasant lie of cards|pg||
nt|bvdahl: depends on whether or not he showed any values by passing the x|pg||
nt|chick: strange he would not show the major though|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@S many play that jump yo 4-level = void, and 3Nt = unknown singleton (splinter)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in Norway, most play jump to the 3 level as showing singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@H - 3@S is unknown splinter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Liked 5@S before any other bids.|pg||
nt|cicus: seems 5@S looked for @C control|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but this system u can combine with 3@c and 3@D as Bergen|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, 5@s makes it difficult to find 7. Give S A@c insted of KJx, then grand is cold|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quality at the @S might|pg||
nt|rodal f: B8 3@SE-1 and 3 IMP|pg||
nt|cicus: what would S have bid with @DA instead of @SA?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: true, 2@s didn't promise anything, so Helness may have taken the view that if Helgemo could bid 4@s facing nothing, maybe an ace and a king was worth another move|pg||
nt|cicus: why?|pg||
nt|rodal f: W didn't signal any @H wich |pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is too difficult for East to find the void|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bvdahl: 13 now. 7@s's and 6 @h's|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@D a que and 5@S ask quality at the @S. |pg||
nt|cicus: decl has to ruff, then can't get to hand , and if plays a spade W ruffs in with the 10|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|cicus: academic now, I am too slow|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: even with K@D more in west hand   slam down on a heart lead    |pg||
nt|dburn: but Helgemo would probably have bid 3@h and then 4@s with a hand opposite which those East cards can make a slam|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes he led low @C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: 1nt X would have been interesting    big difference on opening lead    Q@D  down 1  spade lead  defence might make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bernix: did not read partners suit-preference |pg||
pc|hK|nt|bvdahl: But Helgemo probably doesn't have a very distributional hand since he didn't splinter in the way to 4@s|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or bud 3@h as you say|pg||
nt|bvdahl: bid|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|cicus: how does N know they have @C control?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: it was not possile to play there. Kippes pass was forcing|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|d4|nt|rodal f: AK at @S is ok for the lift K ain't ok|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sorry yes.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bvdahl: because N has denied @c control, thus S implies having it with his 4@h's bid|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H cue over 4@D promise @C control|pg||
nt|cicus: N denied?|pg||
nt|sybarra: did pass force 2 @C or was that suit?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but too difficult to lead from K|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps as S you should pass and compete up to 4@D - vul I think 5@D is an overbid NV|pg||

nt|jcomyn: me too and then bill will be right|pg||
nt|chick: 4-5 losers and he'll probably try the diamond finesse to pitch one, and even that will fail|pg||

nt|rodal f: Or go for the @C ruffs if not a @S lead.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Even if hearts behaved you would be 1 trick short in 6|pg||

nt|vugraphztd: Tundal has shown 14-16 balanced, 6c @C and 5 controls (@C Q is one control)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he doesnt expect the ruff, and who would|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S lead not the most normal one.|pg||
nt|chick: well.... N did pull 2@C to a suit the opps bid, I wouldn't expect him to have too many of them|pg||
nt|rodal f: N told 1 or 3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s2|pc|c2|nt|pelu: but no ciebids - N jusr took a gamble :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, W opened weak 2, so if you are sure he's got the @cK, then you duck, but you can't be sure. But obvisouly when E play low it is an indication|pg||
nt|pelu: wd S - u follow "my plan" :):)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, that @C came as a surprise to me|pg||
nt|rodal f: Is that a normal thinking from E? The @D|pg||
nt|cicus: E is forced to the  winning line of a low spade here|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|bvdahl: cunning @sK from helness. Made it look like his stopper was weak|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well the killer was clear: 4@D took them beyond their "end signal" bid, so 4@H was now a relay|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the error here is West's ... he failed to plan the auction |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Relayers generally use 4@D as an "end signal" - it says, "partner, bid 4@H then pass my next bid"|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Here, West was in control, and the 4@D bid was ruinous to him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because he could now no longer make the bid himself|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems so - I once invited the norwegian team to my room fo a drink during the caransa and they left at 7.0|pg||
nt|cicus: now all clear for declarer|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: and now for sure @DA not in W|pg||

nt|jbgood: W next door knows that prd has a spade ruff, so not sure it was right to go to 5@c|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: and a fast 3nt by E|pg||
nt|jbgood: not so easy for NS now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I expect Aa will bid 4@H ... he really doesn't want to defend 3NT with partner leading a spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|pelu: a very nice3NT by East!!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Molberg to the rescue - East might need to reveal all now|pg||

nt|Walddk2: sacrifice is referred to as a phantom save|pg||

mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|bvdahl: it asks pd to lead dummys first suit|pg||

nt|cicus: that would be gambling, I admit|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may bid it|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   or 1NT around rifght for e/w|pg||
nt|bvdahl: probably 9 tricks in @c|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: should bid it i think and on a wooden @S lead would scor anothe goal|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: and that was in 1980 - so they havent changed since then|pg||
nt|cicus: now 3NT less likely to bebid or to be made|pg||

nt|bjacobs: John, what do you think about this one?  |pg||
nt|sharkey: Skjetne had one shot at it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 11 is possible in spades|pg||
nt|dburn: four-card majors, or three and a half card majors in this case|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is an awkward situation for East-West|pg||
nt|bvdahl: if N is psychic, he will lead @dK|pg||
nt|ady: on hand 9   in OR   the leaders lost 10 imps when e/w reached game   strangely in 4@H  rather than the more obvious 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Good lift and 3@S?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|cicus: E manufacturing a minus|pg||
nt|bvdahl: nice lead|pg||
nt|ady: should get home   3 hearts 1 spade 1 diamond and 2 clubs on the club hook|pg||
nt|chick: I play that as limit raise or better with 3+ trumps|pg||

nt|jcomyn: lets not get into trouble on this one pard|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: good + well timed bid by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: on a diamond lead  12 tricks can be made   and should make at least 11|pg||
nt|sharkey: Erichsen takes the "safe" out|pg||
nt|roswolf: where was the axe??????|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@C insurance although W had a sure defence including the spade ruff|pg||
nt|sharkey: After 6@Hx??|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bvdahl: yes, +90 probably|pg||
nt|bvdahl: don't think it is possibe to raise a spade trick for a @h discard|pg||
nt|cicus: he was not sure of a 4th trick|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: who don't know whether their opponents are in a seven-card fit or a nine-card fit|pg||
nt|bvdahl: passing the x would have been the best action, but very difficult to see that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no thats the last time i say that - i promise|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bvdahl: thnk this is at least 2 down|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, when Larry wrote The Law, he didn't have four-card majors in mind|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: now they have actually started claiming in trick 3 :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bernix: the opposite is an "unhumble cuebid" :)|pg||

nt|chick: and when you stand up on your chair and yell it,  it means you really have hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: At the end it seems as NS got a nice shot for -1|pg||

pc|dA|nt|bvdahl: not sure it is right to say he SHOULD make 11 it they cash 2@c's|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|ady: if they find a club lead  defence has a chance|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sorry folks she who has to be obeyed calls|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bvdahl: with the x it should be possible to find the @s's|pg||
nt|pelu: strange lead when West's 2NT was for minor|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: now  will make|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: i think they maybe play 3@H as 3card @S inv+, and 2NT as inv+ w/4+ @S|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks, Kristian :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|dburn: the opponents are supposed to bid like civlised people - open with five, raise with three|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: still have to find the @s's|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sounds right.|pg||
nt|bernix: case resolved. player showing "noticeable disappoval for partner's defense"|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: a well timed  4@S|pg||
nt|bvdahl: there was a case for throwing N in wit ha @s on the last one|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a routine 11 t4ricks for n/s in no trumps|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3@c is probably minimum with extra length in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: Berg comments; "it is only the distribution E actually had that makes game impossible".|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you need 100% vision, hearing and concentration for that job|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: on the board where EW went -500 in 1 NT, NS bid 3 NT x for -500 and a 14 IMP swing..|pg||
nt|roswolf: south being borinf|pg||
nt|roswolf: boring|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: indeed just my cup of tea|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes. Only the two major aces for EW|pg||
nt|cicus: W relieved of the rebid problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is imaginative|pg||
nt|rodal f: N will bid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn: once more unto the breach...|pg||
nt|cicus: @S has to go down to @H10x doubleton, but first the trump should have been played|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphztd: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and good typing skills too|pg||
nt|bernix: do you agree on doubling with south hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: S|pg||
nt|roswolf: south gets to go first|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: needs a @d lead to make 3 NT here....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but would they have bid slam?|pg||
nt|cicus: OR in the same contract, I' told|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy stuff  can make fresh pot of coffee|pg||
nt|ady: both minor suits break well   usually happens when not required|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did not need|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Sr phone. Back|pg||
nt|bvdahl: do you have statistical data to back up that statement, David...? :)|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C may have been a possibility if north had A@S rather than KQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: another magical mystery tour|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@D would have been interesting|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: i think i would  but it's not ideal|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bvdahl: 2@d looks like on down|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 for the defense|pg||
nt|frankaus: i would not class it an error - give the credit to the opp|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: actually E could have made 9 tricks on last board|pg||
nt|bvdahl: and a chance to go wrong in @c|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bvdahl: should be a very quick claim|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: might also make on an end play  after a heart lead if south does not switch to J@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Cornelia Yoder|pg||
nt|cicus: I would surely have competed with the N hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: so would i|pg||
nt|rodal f: Is 1NT telling a sterio type hand when he bid 2@D? Ask for u.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably just the Usual experience of playing many hands|pg||
nt|bvdahl: only 11?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|bvdahl: board 10 was 200 NS in OR as well, but they played 5@c x|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: double from South?|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|dburn: Helgemo just bidding out his shape, but it looks as though Helness thought 3@d might have been fourth suit, which is why he didn't just bid 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: no   but is so often seems to work out that suitys break nicely when there is no problem if they dont|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: S was not thinking before passing.|pg||
nt|dburn: South can't double - East is unlimited and North could have a Yarborough|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ady: double certainly would have avoided this|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: North needs to ensure he can get on lead to play the other minor through|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: but it looks as though Molberg thinks the same way as Helness about the auction - West doesn't have a firm diamond stop|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|bvdahl: as others have said, it was possible to make the contract on the @h lead as well, but it doesn't seem likely that declearer would go for tha line|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: terrible result  for  MT  team on board 9|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: Also after S bid as he did?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bvdahl: he will not have any count on the @s's|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 1 @h by Kippe here was probably either natural or arttificial GF|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s4|nt|bernix: i would not. vulnerable with 4333. found partner with 5 spades and still cannot make|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: In my site S made N not to fight. I'm might wrong.|pg||
nt|roswolf: -1 looks certain|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: what line? even if South didn't win the ace of hearts and return a diamond, how was declarer supposed to make it?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|sybarra: oops missed an ace in OR |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so will probably try a @d to the K|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: HH discussed the auctions - seems like they did not think completly the same about the 3@d bid|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but I am assunimg @h lead and a @h|pg||
nt|bvdahl: of course, if they cash the first 5 tricks it is not easy to make 3 NT|pg||
nt|dburn: even so, he can't make it even if he doesn't just play a diamond - surely South will cover a diamond spot from dummy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Nice def so fare but...@C|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|c8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: diamond really the only lead likley to make   questionable choise from AQ with only a 4 card suit|pg||
nt|bvdahl: the endplay will be in @h's|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|c5|nt|bvdahl: say h! lead and ! return. Cash 6 black tricks, cash @hK and exit @h|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Although, everything is risky|pg||

nt|bjacobs: You can either run the jack, which works against Qx onside and also 9 singleton offside|pg||

nt|vugraphztd: now 23 mins left for 3 last boards of this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be routine|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: do we open the E hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Or you can play small to the king, which works against Ax onside, and also singleton Q onside|pg||

nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not for me|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cicus: I peeked now and SuitPlay told me to run the J|pg||
nt|bjacobs: small to the king also works against singleton Q offside|pg||
nt|sybarra: in category of "any 11" opening|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i have a dislike of opening balanced 11 counts|pg||
nt|bernix: so do i - my partner does not :)|pg||
nt|chick: not me either|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my partner's dont either :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 11HP and all those middle cards. Always 1@D. This time I'm serious:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: part score hand     n/s  might buy it in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Spot for non?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like 8 tricks NS and 9 EW|pg||
nt|bvdahl: x from W now, is that take out?|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: might be 10 EW, as some specs remind me|pg||
nt|rodal f: Shud there be any reason for that? E balancing.|pg||
nt|cicus: no|pg||
nt|dburn: West perhaps wondering why East didn't open the bidding|pg||
nt|cicus: the reason is this hand|pg||
nt|pelu: your bid: Pass or 3@H?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 2 @s is as high as they can make, I think|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have another 9 card major fit with 21 hcp   but only around 8 tricks this time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in spite of the  minus results which occur|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I'll do the maths later|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may float off 1 or 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 8 or 9 in @s's NS I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy game|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually game is not far off|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|bvdahl: maybe not...|pg||
nt|chick: first someone has to bid them|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Aa had a chance to bid 1@s's but decided against it|pg||
nt|dburn: would bid 3@h, but could pass - don't understand double, which I think is penalty|pg||
nt|cicus: a matter of agreement, in the Robson book it is left open, I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - THAT far off....|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: cant blame south for keeping out of the auction with a poor spade suit  and a singleton of partners suit overcall|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think 9 tricks is most likely here. a bit difficult to do everything you want to do to make 10|pg||
nt|pelu: also penalty for me|pg||
nt|bernix: agree with frank. i would have opened that particular 11-count too|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder if 3 @S bid would have been the "big hand"|pg||
nt|ady: not so lucky this time     but difficult to stop as low as the 2 level|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: true but not if west takes this view|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bvdahl: seems difficult to make 1 NT as well|pg||
nt|cicus: but I play it as penalty, too|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I just asked the question :) The distrubution was good for a take out...|pg||
nt|rodal f: See 9 now if S duck first @H and or @D returned|pg||
nt|pelu: ok: fast X = penalty - slow X = take out :):)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: still not for me|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: west might play a low club after the diamonds    if so best if north plays Q@C    and clears spades    but not easy to see|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: 4333 and 13 HCP not the greatest|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rodal f: U was right. Not fare of. 3NT?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chick: 9s and 10s don't do enough to make up for lack of everything else|pg||
nt|rodal f: Style. In Norway I belive 90% will open.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: south already parted with 1 spade|pg||
nt|rodal f: If not more.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: now 2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: after the opening, they will not stop|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree |pg||
nt|sybarra: they needed a way to be able to stop in 3 |pg||
nt|bvdahl: and I will always open on that hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what that would be  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5/4 hands  i do open 11 counts|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: sure, distributional hands are different, but this is a 4432|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bvdahl: yes, could have gotten a @d ruff|pg||
nt|yo_yo: isnt it 4333, even worse?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bvdahl: and can still get it :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not such a horrible game, really|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: west getting closer and closer|pg||
nt|bernix: no it was 4=3=4=2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Time for a @C. Can come nice endplay if N don't pitch @HK eary enough|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 11 tricks for e/w in hearts    |pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Finesse @S10|pg||
nt|chick: provided entries aren't knocked out too soon|pg||
nt|ady: not on heart lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's quite a double|pg||
nt|jcomyn: crazy contract in open room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And a daft one here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so likely we will start at top of NEXT hour  |pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3@d shows h's, I would think. E wants to figure out if W holds AK of hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: so we will see bidding similar to other room   |pg||
nt|sybarra: so slightly different |pg||
nt|bvdahl: in the other room, E bid 1@s showing @d's|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: webcam from OR: http://bridgefestival.no/refresh.htm|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H here also?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the vul will tempt 5them|pg||
nt|sharkey: N won't stop till game|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bvdahl: yes... I guess it might ba the best line when you see @d's 4-0|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And that's about the only chance after West doubles 4@H as he did in the open room|pg||
nt|ady: somewhat unlikely|pg||
nt|bvdahl: same auction in the open room|pg||
nt|sharkey: will the 4-1 @H break be a problem?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but the club values are not pulling their full weight|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: vestfold romping away now |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: well p did double with his super 3-count|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Honestly, the CR auction makes more sense to me than this one|pg||
nt|cicus: middle @D for 3 tricks there?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now toy are losing it bill this is the closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: when I play multi, I like using 3@c showing a maximum weak 2 opening, and then transfer to the suit with minimum|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so 3@d would show @h's and minimum|pg||
nt|ady: next hand last of the session|pg||
nt|ady: this should be quick|pg||
nt|bvdahl: as long as Kippe plays diamonds when he gains the lead with @HA, EW will be held to 11|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 30 mins delayed due to problems with duplicates. Lunch break after next board. 2nd half of round 7 starts 16.00, 65 mins from now.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: play @c in trick 2 is probably best since there are no entries to enjoy @d's even if you can raise them|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: souths hand is massive now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Austberg's leap to 6@D was a tad lazy|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 1 down? NS will get 3@d tricks, and not possible to ruff more than max 3@h's|pg||
nt|chick: unlucky lie of hearts, and the @DQ lies badly|pg||
nt|bernix: got to find the @dQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will declerer find @DQ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard for N to sop now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bvdahl: so then you will have 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks another boring push|pg||
nt|rodal f: *stop|pg||
nt|sharkey: View N can have a pretty strong hand for 2@H S is compelled to raise I think|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bvdahl: yes, not many losers, really|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think the 10 is rite here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bvdahl: that leap was not lazy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It was, but it may be winning|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR 4 @D-tricks|pg||
nt|bvdahl: ruffing finess in @c's is of no help|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: that @C10 only help decl |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: swingy here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or are we all going daft|pg||
nt|chick: I think no, because even if he gets a count, it's in the short diamond hand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: What do you suppose 4@H means?  The suit I need help in?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: found the critical lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think Molberg makes it|pg||
nt|ady: see if he takes your line Roland|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think 4@h's shows slam interest|pg||
nt|bvdahl: kind of last train|pg||
nt|sybarra: some times there are just gliches,   we all have to live with them |pg||
nt|bernix: play club now. he can endplay west|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but at my club they would pass and gather in 6 imps every day of the week|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 times @S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: NV they might have...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bvdahl: @c7 will be the entry to take the @h finesse|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bvdahl: bit not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: When East shows out in diamonds it must with the odds to finesse spades, no?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bvdahl: has to play @d niw to avoid 2 down|pg||
nt|bvdahl: otherwise BS can get 4 trump tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: might take a club finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. 100% so missed the sac|pg||
nt|chick: or east|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bvdahl: or @d A, obviously|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: a kib is suggesting that it is RKC, another that it is anticontrol :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not enough tricks, David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That only gives him 12|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a club in dummy  and later discard the hearts on spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: 4@h was asking for aces, 4@S showed 0 or 3|pg||
nt|ady: more likely to rely on the spade suit  than take an early finesse|pg||
nt|bvdahl: BS - NS|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bernix: not exactly. because a ruffanddiscard is to no avail. still has to guess @dQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: And now need to be careful|pg||
nt|sharkey: In this case @CK or Q was right at trick 1 as N needs only one pitch - as pointed out by Kristiuan - no time to force @CA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: Thanks Kristian :)|pg||
nt|chick: a ruff sluff doesn't solve the whole problem though|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bvdahl: on the hand that EW needed @d lead to make 3 NT, OR tried 4@h x for -200 and 13 IMPS|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: That 4@H contract on the last board doesn't look too easy to make |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Did declarer do something wrong?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A nornal line here is to win in hand, enter dummy with a spade and play a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I was also wondering how he went down in 4@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well he tried to draw trumps, which looked reasonable, but perhaps it needed to be a cross-ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: croos-ruff would give him 10 tricks - he played for 12 trick - I am not sure if @H in trick will win|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: well, he ruffed the @D return, and E and N agreed it was -1|pg||
nt|pelu: yes at that time he was down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If a low club from East, the percentage play is to insert the 10. Here declarer has an easy ride|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My feeling is that he played it correctly.  The winning line caters to 4-1 trumps, but could easily go down if trumps are 3-2|pg||

mb|1N|nt|vugraphztd: last board of this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: nice suit to see your pard open 1@H :)|pg||
nt|ady: I agree   just drawing trumps and relying on spades   or taking a view of a spade finesse more likely|pg||
nt|bvdahl: We can all agree that Molbers play was not optimal. he needed the @s's 3-3|pg||
nt|dburn: South might volunteer 2@h if this comes back, I guess, but...|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|bjacobs: And many thanks to my fellow commentators John and Gabor ... our heads have been spinning this set, but the comments have been good|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably no one more frustrated  |pg||
nt|sybarra: we exp. thank the specs who always are helpful   love the comments!|pg||

nt|sybarra: and thx to my co-commentators,  great fun all! |pg||
nt|sybarra: and to our specs,  we love the comments and guidance you provide us|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tkx to all specs - co commentators - Kristian - NBF and BBO including Wald.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: not much else to do than play for spades 3-3 I guess|pg||
nt|cicus: a good set it was, surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the Norwegian Bridge Federation (Inger Hjellemarken)  for putting on this entertainment|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but this could get a bit painful|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: flat|pg||
nt|bvdahl: The weak NT strikes again. Keeps EW from their spades. 3@c has a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|bernix: very enjoyable|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tkx Geoffery:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: the poor minors prefer 5-2 to 5-4 - and in teasms|pg||
nt|bernix: thank you all|pg||
nt|sharkey: Congrats to Vestfold - probably increasing their lead beofre the last match|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: will be back in 15 mins with the last round og Norwegian Premier League 2010/2011|pg||
nt|sharkey: Txs Kristian - Godt Jobba :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bvdahl: at least two down, I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: in another match earlier, we saw the long trump suit ruffing...not good|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: 3@D strikes me as a more honest bid, although it doesn't necessarily get you to game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thanks lads it was fun|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next match to start in 13 min but we'll might be a bit late. NOT NORMAL|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bvdahl: even if EW had found the @d ruff, N could solve the trumps without losers|pg||
nt|sybarra: (thinking here about hts)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: would he not have go down if west had J@S doubleton the way it was played?|pg||
nt|ady: maybe  not     can carry on with spades  untill  west ruffs   then use A@D entry later|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: this looks pretty tough, can't draw trump and also ruff diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: if W ducks this, hard to set up spades also|pg||
nt|rodal f: So start is 0900CET|pg||
nt|bernix: chance to level the match but i can see no way|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: results will hopefully soon be up to date on this link: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe if west doesn duck|pg||
nt|chick: if W wins, he has enough entries to set up spades and get to them|pg||
nt|vugraphztd: time is up, but still 6 of 10 tables are playing - the cards must be difficult this round :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Result so fare: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div1|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: east understandly decided not to bid over 1NT opposite a passed partner  red against green|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|pelu: remember the 3@H om AX to J 10 9 x x x? in OR West in 3Nt after  2"H - 2@S by S - down 2-3 on a @s-lead - but N - onmn an very weak hand played @c up to AKJ - and 9 tricks -  S not ...|pg||
nt|pelu: happy :(|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: 2@D there must have promised 4 cards - an advantage of NF 1NT :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: this is the final hand of the session  I believe?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Div2A: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=sm2011_div2A|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bvdahl: a @d now will force N to figure out the club situation|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bvdahl: but if spades are 3-3 or 4-2 with Kx, he might as well pull trumps, so it wasn't the best line by any means|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the next set is due to start in around 15 minutes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Good point from Sveing here. Kippe should have x if he wanted to balance. Normally shows the distribution he's got since you can bid 2@s with 4 card @s in the balancing pos|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Correct|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Cheers all|pg||
