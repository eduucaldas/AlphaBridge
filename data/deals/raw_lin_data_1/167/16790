nt|hedyg: yes by pulling A@S|pg||
nt|daman: 3@S was a bold and imaginative bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: in character with Tom|pg||
nt|ady: Kib suggested after 2 rounds of hearts  diamond switch|pg||
nt|daman: can you imagine    EW were not in the auction at all in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes i can, unlike French players to overcall with the E hand|pg||
nt|ady: not everyone overcalls 2@C with east hand   so then e/w wont be in contention|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the winning line is quite plausible on further consideration|pg||

nt|jlall: assuming it goes spot on your right you have a complete guess the next time, and are basically not better than 50/50 there. I do not know about EW lead style but most people lead a ...|pg||
nt|jlall: higher spot from 4 small and if that was the case it would be 100 % to play the ten. |pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: well this looks definitely the end|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|hedyg: you think they wont bid slam?|pg||
nt|hedyg: N has a great hand with good spots too opposite 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: how can e/w get a double figure swing !?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think they can bid less than slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s here have fielders choice|pg||
nt|jlall: EW do actually make a game here though it is quite lucky|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  so double dummy it looks like 4@H makes. @h 2-2, @CK onside, @D3-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|an|minimum|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzyf: Thomas alerted 4NT as minors|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: ohhhh?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he has a preference!|pg||
nt|hedyg: a slight preference|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  but i think they're better off staying low and going plus in a partscore|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzyf: now Thomas said to Fulvio " this is NOT minors!" ..|pg||
nt|roswolf: might end up in a doubled contract i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: might pass and that works too|pg||
nt|uttam: g eve all|pg||
nt|jlall: 2N i view as kind of a bluff, when you have this west hand you can easily imagine the opponents cold for 4S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: so you might confuse the matter|pg||
nt|jlall: and if your partner has a strong hand, you might make a game|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  3@S i think should score well, probably -1, given the opps should make their contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: do u agree E has a min hand?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: red card will be applied to any bid from now|pg||
nt|ady: decent slam|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jlall: i don't know their style, but for me it is defintely not a min hand white|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: this gets it off safely|pg||
nt|hedyg: fast lead for Fantoni!|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jlall: that would be a real max for me :) thats the great thing about bridge, there are many different winning styles|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I would categorize it as medium. The shape isnt good. the suit isn't great. but it hasn't a strong outside feature which lifts it up.|pg||
nt|jlall: my impression of romanians is that they are very aggressive though so I am surprised by that evaluation|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: i dont see how this is a min hand, in any system:)|pg||
nt|jlall: is it possible they play 2D as weak multi and 2M as constructive?|pg||
nt|jlall: some people play that, in which case east is a min|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: at this table we have the old school:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|roswolf: well if east had switched to a minor declarer mightget home|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

nt|jjbrr:  i'd be content with this score as NS|pg||
mc|8|nt|jlall: of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: nop, they dont play 2d weak M|pg||
nt|jlall: raluca do you know if their CCs are posted somewhere? For Romanian championships do you have to submit an electronic CC before hand?|pg||

nt|hedyg: how do you win 46 imps in 2 bds?|pg||
nt|jlall: they must just be very sound then :)|pg||
nt|jlall: ah finally, an action hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: not really:))|pg||
nt|jlall: EW have a huge result in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: no, i dont have their CC online|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: ok :(|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: well i think we can safely congratulate team Laffineur on a very good win - well done|pg||
nt|roswolf: win each board by 4000 point difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzyf: 2@D = 5 @H in a weak hand|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|hedyg: have never seen 4000, is that possible at all?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jlall: 6D and 6H both make, 6H being a bit better because you might make with 3-2 trumps if the CA is off (and you rightside it, or they don't lead a club)|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I would expect most table to end at 4@H only, but 6@H obviously is a very good score|pg||
nt|jlall: but very tough to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|jlall: i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: jeremy do you like 2@H or would you jump?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jjbrr:  i like to go low on this type of auction and bid 2@H only|pg||
nt|jlall: i confess id be tempted :)|pg||
nt|jlall: the void is very nice, but having no aces is bad|pg||
nt|jlall: assuming 4D shows strong diamonds, east still has a problem because he doesn't know which shortness west has...if it is short clubs he can basically claim slam, short spades and he ...|pg||
nt|jlall: has some issues...i expect him to move though|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  the dbl by S makes E unhappy, because AQxx of @S looks less exciting... but W gets very excited with his hand|pg||
nt|jlall: maybe with a 4@S cue hoping to get a club cue from partner, or maybe he will be less scientific hoping to not give away the lead|pg||
nt|jlall: still after the double if you're off cashing clubs probably south has them both so I would not be attempting trickery here :)|pg||
nt|jlall: and of course you could be off the first THREE clubs on a bad day, though that seems pessimistic|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jlall: come on Rosu, 4@S :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jlall: west admits to his club control|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  looks like theyre off to the races|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jlall: east will bid at least 5@D here|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes i once conceded such a score 7@HXX = IN ONE ROOM AND 7@SX Iin the other both making on a ruff and discard at trick 1 in each room|pg||
nt|jlall: well|pg||
nt|jlall: west concerned still by his lack of aces, doesn't like the void after 4@S, and has no @HK either|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  in my style i would cuebid 4@C first to show first or second round control; 5@C after 4@S would show first round control|pg||
nt|jlall: east concerned about bad trumps with the likely bad split...|pg||
nt|jlall: still might stop here|pg||
nt|jlall: i will boldly predict a pass from east :) maybe he shouldn't with the AK of trumps though|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: the jack of trumps is so huge here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: so is the jack of diamodns to a lesser degree...maybe west should have done more with both of those|pg||
nt|jlall: what do you think jeremy?|pg||
nt|jlall: reasonable? or who should have bid more?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jjbrr:  i really want to assign the blame to west, but i really think they both made reasonable actions.|pg||
nt|jlall: yes i think its west also|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jjbrr:  4@D is such a space-consuming bid|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: arguing now:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jlall: haha|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jjbrr:  but in fairness his hand isn't really spectacular, so it's hard to assign fault.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jlall: aruging...AFTER the CA lead :)|pg||
nt|jlall: the thing is, once youre in 5, 6 is much better, because if the CA is off 5 might well go down|pg||
nt|jlall: and if it's on, 6 will make|pg||
nt|jlall: so getting to 5 is kind of a disaster|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jlall: and also south bid of course making the ace very likely to be on|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Herve Lustman. Great Job! Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators George, Hedy and David ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: for their perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes. Finally, our gratitude to the FFB (Claude Dadoun) for ensuring that this world class event ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: is brought to BBO.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jlall: i think west can kind of expect east to have the aces and kings to drive past game, what else could he have?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jlall: the more i think about it, the more i will assign west the blame for not bidding it at the end over 5D|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c9|pc|dT|pg||
mc|11|nt|jjbrr:  was 4@D such a descriptive bid?|pg||
nt|jlall: if it showed 6-4 then yes, but youre right that its space consuming|pg||
nt|jlall: im not sure if they had the methods to show short spades thoguh|pg||

nt|Vugraphzyf: Thanks All :)|pg||
nt|daman: thx everyone|pg||
nt|jlall: 4C obviously is short clubs, is 3S obviously short spades? it should be but you need the agreement|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  if 3@C was a pattern bid, might that have worked better, in general?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|iq007:  inspired double for Popescu to reach 4@h on the previous board|pg||
nt|jlall: it wouldnt have really helped though, east would have been quite turned off by short spades, i was liking their auction until the 5H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|iq007:  they really need some VPs as they are the last team in the group|pg||
nt|iq007:  the last two teams from each series go to B league|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: great slam here i dont think|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm 9@s 2nd entry to N |pg||
mb|1S|nt|iq007:  and the first 2 from each series advance in the semi-finals|pg||
mb|d!|nt|jlall: bidding 4S is quite strong but typical these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: south will catch a raise of spades and just punt out game|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|hedyg: hard to find the @H lead|pg||
nt|jlall: or not!|pg||
nt|jlall: i find norths pass strange, do you disagree?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|4D|nt|hedyg: A@S|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I admit I woul bid 2@S after the dbl|pg||
nt|jlall: those jacks are pretty bad but its still 7 points, 3 spades, a ruffing value, white/red...|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: hah, even the delayed raise does it...I think east pushed them there though|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: should be automatic|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  well. they've made the last guess, which has some merit in competitive auctions.|pg||
nt|jlall: I am not sure why east bid 4@D either|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: yes, and i also think that supp part in @s is holy:)|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  and in this case does quite well.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: if you dont play the A@S you never know what is going on|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jlall: when RHO bids 4@D you just bid 4@S since it might be a save if 4@D makes, and who knows you might make... if RHO passes it's different, he still might have bid though expecting ...|pg||
nt|jlall: partner to have 2 spades and some values, likelyy in clubs given the auction|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  note the other table did quite well with the NS cards also; not sure why EW were so timid. Is 5m very expensive insurance?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: Quantin played A@S after J@C ducked|pg||
pc|d8|nt|iq007:  What are your choices here? K lead or small @c?|pg||
nt|iq007:  If the K is lead you are subject to a bath coup (declearer will play small to remain in control)|pg||
nt|iq007:  small-big is 2-0 until now :)|pg||
nt|iq007:  it depends also on what signals have you discussed with your partner, I prefer to give attitude on Q lead and count on K lead|pg||
nt|zensuni: 2@c by Chelu doesn't make @c lead too appealing though|pg||
nt|rocketer: K@C|pg||
nt|iq007:  So from KQ I can lead both K or Q, Q from something like KQx and K from strong holdings which asks unblock, then count|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|zensuni: K definetely looks better if @C lead, or rusinow Q|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|rocketer: 3NT=|pg||
