nt|xenya: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d has some play for NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suspect EW play Precision|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and for those not familar,  canape, second suit longer than first bid suit|pg||
mb|1C|an|16+, any|nt|hawe45:  - ah, I didÂ´nt see the 9 of @H, important card |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that 1@C comfirms it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=19-21   unlike original Precision's 22-23|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: West adopts the iew that passing with a weak balanced hand is better than trying to fluke a partscore|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *view|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning - think we have the same weather in Norway Mark :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hackett finished 3rd in the Qualifying Swiss and chose Beijing Trinergy who finished 4th|pg||

nt|ahollan1: DBL  5-8 HCP|pg||

mb|1D|an|0-7|nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||

nt|rmb1: Whatever the first two bids mean, an auction thats seems destined to reach 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Do we know NS's system?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway - a tuff start|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW belong in 3@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings: )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can EW even sniff at 4@H?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: as i play 4@D has to be ace (not king or singleton)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the Hacketts are father Paul and son Justin two fine English players|pg||
nt|caitlin: missing cold 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: 3NT available for EW here   but not easy to get there|pg||
nt|bobh1: apparently the second double is takeout|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a fair treatement if West's 1st pass doesn't show values|pg||
nt|sharkey: this appears to be a coffee hand - 11 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone guess what 3D is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Victor and J|pg||
nt|caitlin: Al 1@C Precision?|pg||

mb|p|nt|bg: seems natural so far:)|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Thks|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
mb|2N|an|does not guarantee 4!s|nt|othered1: If something lilke Precision, there would be questions about relative minor suit length, v what a double would show, etc.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont see what 5@C accomplishes but wont do any harm|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hi guys welcome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D is tough to beat --  i think it requires trump lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Hello Ed |pg||
nt|caitlin: this is 1 of 4 segments of finals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now declarer can use both of dummy's @D to ruff|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: still young at heart I expect|pg||
nt|sybarra2: interesting the hts crash|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  For sure he is|pg||
nt|chessmaste: If North's spade had been headed by the @S AK he would probaly have bid 4@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Nigel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D probably something bout minors????|pg||
nt|ahollan1: something like  ruff trick 1, @C @C @C ruff, @SA discard @H, @S ruff, @C ruff with Queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1/4 Key Cards -- and play for 15 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: it may have asked about clubs and 5@D denied|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'b be happy ot pass 2@H as East; I've done enough, IMO, with a 4441|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but its so prime|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm not unsympathetic to the raise; but I expect West to be aggressive with say, 5 trumps & a black K|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and bid 3@H over the X|pg||
nt|caitlin: loses 2@H but has to ruff 2@C or finesse..can't ruff 2@C without losing @DJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  @H are 22 but is that best line  when only seeing 2 hands??|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sunil|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panja: hi all|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: i thought this was going to be a flat board till I saw the disaster in the open|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sort of minor canape|pg||
nt|caitlin: absolutely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in other room  lead was top @H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: of course easier from here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why i liked ruff trick 1|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike you with us also?|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by both pairs -- for a moment i thought somebody would overbid here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not sure about overbidding as just about everything comes rolling home.|pg||
nt|othered1: After the "opening bid," EW weren't going to find the hopeless slam|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or maybe just clubs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: neatly done -- from N's perspective slam is on a finesse at worst|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: Hi Andy and Prakash.|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi Jordan and Prakash|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: the wrong board featured a possible slam, barring a spade lead -- here is another of the same kind -- 6@D is on on a non-heart lead |pg||

nt|andyv:  should be a push board|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it earned an imp|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this so close they all count|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D = weak @H/@S|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|othered1: What's east's 1@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: From south's 2@C bid, I might infer it's a big @C|pg||
nt|bg: not sure but is normal start for a 2nnt rebid|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW will make a game try...bid 3N and try to make it|pg||
nt|othered1: west apparantly denies 5@S if he passes over 1@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: regardless of strength?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3NT is the spot for E/W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Precision it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 1C either clubs or weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: might even land in wrong suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I can tell you the McGann in the OR is indeed in 3N and looks like making so it could be 1st blood to Hackett|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html  for standings and Daily Bulletins (scroll down in the column to the left)|pg||

nt|mamos: 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and cant really fail a cards lie|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: 6@D ? asks a kibitzer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - on this board?...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|saverio: NS could take 11 tricks in 5@d here     another "not easy to find" game  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd prefer 2@C over the X|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 8 easy tricks is a good start; usuallythe defence will provide one along the way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N may seem strong on HCP - but doubleton @H isn't carrying full weight -- and even so 11 opposite Precision 11-15  opening doesn't want to get too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: takeout DBL from South should let North compete in @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Justin Hackett opened the South hand with 1@S   -- EW never in the auction so 2@S South|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe 3NT now shows minors with long clubs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: double probably shows clubs and diamonds too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H from North now?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: i hope 2N is a scramble|pg||
pc|c2|nt|saverio: 6@d should be off on a @s lead  even if it is a though lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Communications are not very good especially if defenders lead clubs, but 9 tricks shouldn't be a problem|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In their precision style that would be an overbid|pg||
nt|rmb1: on the basis the 3@S shows spades :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: NS will h ave another chance to take 7 top tricks.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: whew|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bg: it was 16+|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like a normal big @C auction, with 2@S showing a limited positive response.|pg||
nt|othered1: ty operator|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in the other room West raised to 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N made on 1 for 6 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Previous match was decided on a misunderstanding of a 4 NT bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Played 4 NT down 2 instead of 6@S making...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think 4NT is too much with no fit and East showing no encouragement|pg||
nt|odysseus69: betting he will bid slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hope so|pg||
nt|jcomyn: D the worry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South has shown extras - cant have much less than he has|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @D loses @S wins Q@C dies|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: goofy little hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: after A@c could be interesting if PO tries to sneak a spade he may may make|pg||
nt|othered1: in the OR, it was east who thought his hand worth initial action and opened 1@C, cheating his partner out of the chance to be first to bid.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sunsamvar: i might be tempted to do so too.|pg||
nt|xenya: makes sense, considering the vulnerability |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with the west hand... 7 points in partners preemt might not produce a single trick|pg||
nt|xenya: putting maximum pressure on NS|pg||
nt|odysseus69: always right to make these decisions slowly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gold made 5@D after @H lead and @D shift|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bg: same result in other room on board 1|pg||
nt|othered1: the overcall does give west some useful information|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you prepared to bid 7 if opponents reach slam, because that often happens with these extreme preempts|pg||
nt|xenya: spades behave, in a sense, so declarer can get out for -1|pg||
nt|saverio: do you agree on S 3NT?    |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html   for Daily Bulletins (scroll down in the column to the left)|pg||
nt|bobh1: @c lead gives a trick|pg||
nt|othered1: first of EW, that it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he ruffed 1@C, discarded @C on @SA and relied on @H22 [easier after the lead]|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tejjyid: Those bulletins are astounding, the eds/authors do a fantastic job|pg||
nt|lestergold: question of overtricks now|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely no tank here must be odds to play J or T @c|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well if they play 4NT and South leads a spade it is easy enough to score ten tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: IN OR, I guess west couldn't imagine a hand with no key cards.  Those who require a modicum of quality in the suits they open 2@C won't face that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: maybe was thinking of 7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done |pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: Will lead @DQ to preserve the opportunity to play S out of @D KT7.  Or won't.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is South has as little as @DKxxx then slam is on likely-to-be-wrong @DA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: matched other room same spot|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nothing really to the play is there?  Try both finesses and find that one works|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Barry Rigal suggests that he might run this - should have led the king? - not that it matters as cards lie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unlikely I'd think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely \w hasd not bid with J to 6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: consensus is to run the heart and he will|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|caitlin: 7@H last bd in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  7N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after a few more bids than in our room|pg||
pc|h7|nt|saverio: wd by N to move from 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scramble [2 places to play]  lets South choose the correct minor   imagine South holding 4@D & 3@C|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome Andrew|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w close to game values in @hs but 3 finesses wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Precision 1@D -- just coincidence that it is longest suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: another Precision 1@D  probably 2+@D, maybe 1+|pg||
nt|caitlin: more hands than I play in few months:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: thats a spec count Ed true hard to know at atble|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: these weak 2 suiters do crowd the auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 1 @H = spades?|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Andrew!|pg||
nt|sybarra: game likely to be bid at both tables actually|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like even 3@h overboard|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW can make 1 or 2 NT|pg||
nt|mamos: not exactly a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|caitlin: ugly @Ss|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: PO going to the new fangled stuff?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 12+10 = 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: The longer north keeps this off of a quantitative NT track, the better for NS.|pg||
nt|othered1: it's possible north has no *descriptive* forcing bid at this point|pg||
nt|super nova: I prefer 5@c by Ohno|pg||
nt|super nova: Since it says I also have @D support|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1:30 in writing also|pg||
nt|lestergold: a doomed 4@s for a push here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: slam doesn't look too unreasonable here, and perhaps they will get there|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S from North|pg||

mb|p|nt|bg: would you rebid three clubs here?|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3N has a shot|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you could try 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: why should north accept 3N?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North going very slowly|pg||
nt|lestergold: how old is PO he was world famous when i was a teenager|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  N/S should be reluctant to sell out to 2@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  low @s probably best here|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 2@S was just enough to keep east from negative doubling|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bg: Taipei + 620 in other room|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bedst to be said about 5 @H: even 4 @H is no winner...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Papa was there|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good strain for EW as shud make|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud S act over 2@D?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would have doubled with South at the end|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@C looks fearless to me, even with the @D fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  Simon rule:  against NT if you have a 5 card suit and 4 card suit, lead the 4 card suit|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be a success|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't hate 2@C rebid, but I think it would be nice to have methods that didn't require me to balckwood on north hand, though maybe it will work out.  7th @C, as yet unbid, is key ...|pg||
nt|othered1: and north can't count it.|pg||
nt|bg: the seventh club is the elusive trick not to mention dia Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi all sorry I am late|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|lestergold: go stand in corner Shirley|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was on a radio program debate, ok |pg||
nt|bobh1: N has kind of a notrumpy hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry i used to be a teahcer its just habit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mike is telling you to comment on the Go stand, in the corner|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth has shown an appreciation of the "soft" nature of his 16 count, but 'm not sure whathe can do about it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mirrored shapes and marginal game values dont mix well|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if he bids it will west lead his fourth best from hismlongest and strongest the only lead to give 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that was a few decades ago|pg||
nt|lestergold: like 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@c probably bid to direct lead |pg||
nt|othered1: might have dissuaded west to only make a game try|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well timed, becasue nothing in the auction said the @C layout was like this|pg||
nt|othered1: but it is a vul game and you don't need to be bonded to try it (if the opponents don't look like the doubling kind)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if West has AQT, he would be greatly encouragesd on minimum values|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 8 yops|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tops|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  Another good move from Hac-Hac|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@C has good chances |pg||
nt|othered1: nice place to stop on NS cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: true but here we need to give credit to 2@h opening|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, 4@D is a surprise|pg||
nt|lestergold: only in bidding comp migt gamke not be bid here|pg||
nt|sybarra: so likely to hear 1 nt  and we did|pg||
nt|odysseus69: needs heart lead to beat very lucky 3NT-or club lead and heart switch|pg||
nt|rmb1: "where there's eight there's nine" says those in 3NT-1|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice Robin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China is a 6-man team,  NEDUK is playing 4-handed|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: Bulgaria are 2nd and Hackett are 6th at this time|pg||
nt|sharkey: Carch all x - i have "something"?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is 2-way Checkback    2@D forced  2@S=5@S invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: That's an effort you'd see in many duplicate clubs.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S may scramble to 6 tricks..I don't see a 7th if the defense is careful|pg||
nt|jcomyn: safety first|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NT by S guarantees @H lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right spot|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this may make|pg||
nt|sybarra2: NEDUK seems to be holding up well|pg||
nt|caitlin: amazing|pg||
mb|5H|nt|xenya: the auction in the other room was completely different -- S chose to preempt in 1st seat|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@S is essentially on a heart finesse|pg||
nt|jcwla: I am not convinced by this.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rule of 11 tells W the whole story.|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, NS were lucky to remain oblivious of their spade fit|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but these 4 have played a lot of bridge |pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: not easy to get to slam after 2@h/3@c/4@h...  a lot of space wasted and no more room to investigate|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OH, thy're certainly getting to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 4@d is systematic|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the double by W makes S hand worse, and NS not vul. but most wiould bid game even if appreciating the negative factors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S=too high|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess, comparer to what they might open on, south has a maximum . . . |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: *Catch|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  When you have heart tolerance and clubs and nothing much in their suit, it will usually be best to compete I think|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It is much harder for North even with quite a good hand unless they have extra shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  and this may be the 7th|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I guess, that's why it took so long to find.  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: 6 LTC + 8.5 LTC means larginal for game even apart from the mirror|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South *might* have passed 2@S NV< but once not, no way to stop|pg||
nt|bobh1: actually no way to misdefend|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is a difficult double dummy problem i ndeed to imagine a scenario where EW could let it make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well North was very max for his 2@s and south was sub min for 2N|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If they routinely make single raises with 16 HCP, South is pretty much compelled to try will 9+|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all. Sry am a bit late|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Sunil.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if South was allowed to rebid 2@S instead of 1N|pg||
nt|caitlin: lose 1@S 3@H|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobh1: E is thinking hard about finding one|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Sunil|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobh1: a good effort|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt that would change the final contract -- just wondering|pg||
nt|andyv:  continued @s leads was indicated|pg||
nt|xenya: E would have done better to put up the @DQ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: a smelly lead not a good idea to finesse|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sunsamvar: Hi Jordan &Vladimir|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: In this case they wud likely end up in 2@H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|blum1956:  still only 6 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H may have been intended to push opponents to a phantom, but west did not get the plot, a lot to be said for bidding 2s with east hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: still -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H @H ruff  try to score small trump?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: 5@H looks very dubious, with all those losers in the minors |pg||
pc|h6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: PO seems to be anxious to hide his only asset|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well it was a thought|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobh1: but insufficient|pg||
nt|othered1: I find few Precision players would raise on south's xxx support.  I might, but I don't play Precision.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: What about 2@S over 2@C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not playing 2-way Checkback   2@C could be hand that wants to play 2@D  or  invite with 5@S 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: if you're not playing 2-way checkback, why isn't 2@D weak with @D, as in standard?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some do say that you can ignore the force to 2@D with MAX and  3@S  when unwilling to hear partner PASS 2@D|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: -3 is 500|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit puscillamillous..puscillaminus ... pouscillaminous.. oh i give up|pg||
nt|andyv:  for the specs... N should be David Bakshi and S should be David Gold (at least that's how they have been sitting when NS but most of the time they have been EW.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcwla: Not tons of fun for E here.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|sunsamvar: tons of pressure will squeeze him out :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|nigel_k:  On passive defence declarer would have to guess diamonds after ruffing a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who play simple Checkback [or NMF] it is critical that the partnership knows priority of rebid with BOTH 3 of responder's major   AND  4 of the other major|pg||

nt|sybarra: glad you can keep this score|pg||

nt|chilloncan: interesting deal , hard to predict|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  That seems like a lot|pg||

nt|othered1: absolutely and there are as many schemes as are mathematically available.|pg||
nt|caitlin: and how do you play that Al?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Ed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play a 2-way 1@C opener  a) 11-13 bal  b) any 17+ HCP   so McGann's 1@S is limited to 10-16 HCP|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h about the limit of this hand|pg||

nt|caitlin: g|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@SX in the other room|pg||

nt|andyv:  the Heng team made a good comeback the last 16 boards to make this match reasonably close.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|odysseus69: another slam but......|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: East did make neg X and W passed the X|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: maybe 2S by N, but maybe almost anythionbg|pg||
nt|lestergold: I like auction in open ensuring the penalty that was dealt to them|pg||
nt|lestergold: no idea|pg||
nt|bobh1: i wonder if he can make 1@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Precision 2@C by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's been a long time since i've played anything but 2-way checkback|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but priority is still needed after 2-way's 2@D game forcing checkback|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't play 2-way checkback. In one-way checkback, I play whatever my partner wants, usually 3-card support, 4 in other major, or @H . . . |pg||
nt|andyv:  fyi:  the semi finals are 32 boards... the finals 64|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Difficult now - how find 5 @D|pg||

pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: the auction has died in a mere 3@H OR so a plus for Bulgaria|pg||

pc|d9|nt|chilloncan: i agree S shoiuld pass, but they so seldom fo|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Passing 1@H as West seems pretty conservative|pg||
nt|xenya: i would pass as N|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I would prefer to open 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strictly a matter for partnership    a) priority to 3 card fit   b) priority to show @H [4 if responder bid @S, 3 if responder bid @H]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was Semi-Force   6-12 HCP|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N may be any solid suit but looks a little rich to be gambling with !k and !q|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whyat a nice break|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to lead a trump|pg||
nt|caitlin: natural|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: quite some interesting teams |pg||
nt|chilloncan: do|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: marginal dbl... i might|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec asks if acol...it may be but I don't think so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S to play -- totally new concept :)       actually most of the Chinese Precision pairs we've seen this week play 2-way Stayman over 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphzyt: what? he has 16HCPs?|pg||
nt|caitlin: 1@D 2+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not allowed to use adjectives when making the bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt 2@D would be natural -- it is the only cuebid available|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: That's a 16-19 rebid|pg||
nt|xenya: they did in the other room, but... |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this is pushing it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice jump overcall in the balancing position by Zhan|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S in last seat tends to show a decent hand -- just what S has|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the other option of dbling and then bidding @Ss will show more points and defence|pg||
nt|othered1: has anyone really proven out the value of semiforcing 1N responses at IMPs?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkey: Lots of work to do|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: what's your prediction on this one, Martin?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I the good old days, North had "taken the money against 2 @C D!"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only see two losers in 5 @D? But how many tricks...|pg||
nt|saverio: after the 2@h opening in the earlier board we can understand why N opened 1@h here     though it is not my style since i prefer sounds openings and overcalls....:)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont really agree with the double by W, but the position is a very awkward one|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I have never played Precision where 2@c can have a major|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In a way both sides are endplayed|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I fI were NOrth I would lead a @S - but if I were South I would have bid @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: everyone agree with the 4s bid|pg||
nt|rmb1: no|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me nayther|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and no|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 off guaranteed club guess needed to avoid 2 light|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I used to play cheapest NT was a void based T/O|pg||
nt|sybarra: some sort of drury by N |pg||
nt|tejjyid: and on that lead, it won't be too hard|pg||
nt|othered1: west's pass, compared to an earlier board, must mean he looks at the vulnerability before bidding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: and I guess east is making a game try|pg||
nt|xenya: tough hand for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is down after 2 rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if South has soft values in the majors 3 nt may be right.. but i guess he will bid 5@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I worked oncein real life, and this appears to be the 2nd time|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
nt|caitlin: miss 6@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: proven?   i'm sure proponents of absolute force and semi force have absolutely proven that their position is correct and the other is wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i think they're both right|pg||
nt|othered1: south pretty much took control and north was just along for the ride, to my eyes.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm a bidder, Jordan, you know that.  I can't defend a lick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: well N knows all the spades on his left |pg||
pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: and the @Da ofcourse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A defence found in the open room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm with you Saverio as are your stars Fantunes Lauria and Versace|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1st endplay|pg||
nt|sharkey: sxry 2nd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably just assume West has 3+@D  and that South DBL is takeout of @D  |pg||
nt|caitlin: still watching celebrations in Egypt....a historical day|pg||
nt|caitlin: why Al?|pg||
nt|caitlin: how many HCP can N have?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China starts with 2 pickups in 3 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what would you have North bid with 4@H & 4@S ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: we will just have to ask the players!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bakhshi opened with a 2+ 1@C    Gold plays 1N undoubled|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East never bid in the other room -- smoother auction for Hackett's to get to the same 5@C|pg||
nt|othered1: If south overtakes and returns @S, will n orth know the relative count?|pg||
nt|xenya: Justin is not amused |pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: as ugly as this looks shoudl be able to scramble 7 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: same as in open|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: oh dea @S pitches|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the -500 cost 12 imps|pg||
nt|saverio: if def wont play 1 round of trump i think 5@d can be made    so they need E to win @h and shift to @d    which is not easy at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: club now woujld put to guess but probably get right|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: and did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops   i started typing that befoe i saw McGann's 5@D|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|othered1: all east needs to do is guess everything right but that lead is gonna prevail|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe|pg||
nt|bg: greta lead this danger os E being declarer|pg||
nt|bg: of|pg||
nt|othered1: bu;t north needs to read the lead correctly.|pg||
nt|othered1: what would south have tried from J9x?|pg||
nt|andyv:  love those lead directional dbls that become trump|pg||
nt|blum1956:  800 ready, and declarer needs to be careful to avoid 1100|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however no great damage since 5D on |pg||
nt|jcomyn: just about|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: this will speed up the play|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd not make such an aggressive lead with only 1 trump..|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe 8 |pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi folks sorry for being late|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: well done, so far|pg||
nt|chilloncan: club just helps declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: Another red 9 is the vital card|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as was the case on board 1|pg||
nt|othered1: off those @C honors, north can infer south had exactly 2@H|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am not shure but can Ws bid be a running color as I did use before. Also at major.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  So in fact - bd 19 - the 2 @H opening backfired|pg||
nt|sybarra: been around long enough to have learned |pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Peter|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tejjyid: NOrth may find he has too many trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: south took the bull by the horns here -will his bold bid prosper?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: West will force declarer, but the location of the @D A means the contract is safe|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Probaly the best exit was the @D J, creating an entry to East's hand|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: peopel usually forget to put you to the guess when they have the Q|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes nice switch|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  Even the @D 2 would do |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: west has to perforce continue @C after seeing the major holding in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If declarer gets another club he will try to get rid of his clubs on dummy's majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But he won't succeed|pg||
nt|othered1: HI!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe not now; retaining the QT in dummy looked like a good plan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kool tool   check out   http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: given that 6@C was making it's surprising the auction petered out in 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kaplan Rubens Hand Evaluator aggrees with Pen   it says West worth  14.75|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bg: big swing here EW =+ 680|pg||
nt|othered1: might depend on how declarer thinks @S split.  Remember west ddin't overcall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Deserves 681.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: after all i can see 3 tricks in my hand and if P has @Ha the contract is down if the @Ca cashes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html  for standings and Daily Bulletins (scroll down in the column to the left)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Lots of tricks now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: looked like a hand not to touch trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 unavoidable losers|pg||
nt|blum1956:  he must play a trump now|pg||
nt|xenya: @D9 is a big card here, so possible -4|pg||
nt|andyv:  a simple rule...dbls against articial bids when vul are lead directional and when not vul, suggest sacrificing|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html for results|pg||
nt|blum1956:  if he plays a club then 1100|pg||
nt|rmb1: So West will claim 4@S was right, stopped NS reaching 5@D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|saverio: E should have play a @d here in order to play again after ruffing third @h by Q   i think it wd set it  (not sure though)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so the 2@H was let down by team mates not reaching game/slam|pg||
nt|saverio: uh ho   now he could be in trouble (if my def lines works :))|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it enabled the good sac to be made, relying on teamies who let the side down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South might regret having played this @D to the Ace|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Victor|pg||
nt|saverio: he had all top trumps   (exept the Q)  i think a cross suff plane was better |pg||
mc|9|nt|dburn: this looks dangerous, though|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i don't believe EW playing Namyats  so 4@H has wide range |pg||

nt|sybarra: not making these deal easy|pg||
nt|xenya: good point, Sunil|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx Roland|pg||
nt|chessmaste: It was awkward for West |pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C opening pushed NS into a difficult contract - playing standard may end up at 1 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  3 Liu Haitao opened only 3@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so that's 6 imps back to the Chinese team  [sorry full team name just too tough to type]|pg||
nt|sybarra2: needed some imps back |pg||
nt|roswolf: full reward|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: pass from N|pg||
nt|super nova: How about this for a 3@c preempt Vul. ;-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West has 4 loser hand -- bidding only once is way too timid|pg||
nt|jcwla: The double seems really wrong.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: good passs by N doesnt fit too many systems for an opening|pg||
nt|super nova: ah.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Aggressive weak jump to 2@s at the other table|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Which led to North playing 3@d|pg||
nt|sharkey: Could be expensive for NS|pg||
nt|caitlin: try Ji|pg||
nt|sybarra2: we may hear 4 sp|pg||
nt|andyv:  see Jordan?  every so often I get them right:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: another Precision 1@D|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd bid on west's hand, but would be much happier doing so if partner had shown some values|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: one often thinks,  why does pard do that??|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kiwibridge: the big flat use a lot of space nt|pg||
nt|othered1: south, perhaps feeling too good for a 1N overcall (if available naturally), tried a simple 1@D and gets a bid out of partner.  Now what?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: interesting 4C before 5D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: sry it was 2 clubs x by E down 1 -100|pg||
nt|othered1: so far very normal.  Now north's hand says do something @H focused, like raise or support double|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H looks like good hand, bad suit, which is apt.|pg||
nt|othered1: 24 HCP, vul, an OK 5-card suit, game figures to be bid today.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this looks like 3NT scraping home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if available  --  i wonder if the South hand qualifies for an Intermediate Jump 2@S overcall|pg||
nt|caitlin: sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzyt: 4HE-anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra2: wonder if they play intermediate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know they play weak -- just wondering if the @S suit qualifies   --   i really think about stuff like this unless heavily medicated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the only Weak 2 available in Ultimate Canape system|pg||
nt|sybarra2: you mean 2 @S?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: is this Ekblad as in Russ EKblad?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes 2@S is the only weak 2 available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: puppet action here    |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@D = a 4 card but no 5 card major|pg||
nt|sharkey: Put the pressure on W - 4@H x likely off 2|pg||
nt|mamos: ew likely to bid game  maybe 3nT|pg||
nt|caitlin: bd 4 open in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pen just doesn't realize how powerful @S9 is|pg||
nt|sybarra2: N has hands like I do,  just yukky|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzyt: now S leads SK and win|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now what   2@S  blast 3N  downgrade to 3@C   something in @H??   tough call for West|pg||
nt|mamos: so what will West do here?   2@S is one choice  delayoing tactic|pg||
nt|vugraphzyt: andcA, ruff, returnsD and another ruff,DK -3 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even 2N forcing wouldn't help|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ekeblad|pg||
nt|sybarra2: your spelling is correct |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: N likely hitting the deck quickly here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or not?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: good bid by E, but this should end it|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Bidding over a strong club works at lot of the time|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
nt|othered1: But north has extras, maybe too many|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they handle the clubs?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth maybe a little conservative opposite a 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|jcwla: No, this S made it, Andy.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|nigel_k:  5@c may have been easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant fail to make as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north's 1N an underbid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I would upgrae my "well-positioned" @S honours and try 2NT as a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: any one for neg X |pg||
nt|lestergold: especially as  apassed hand and indeed qorth an upgrade in any case with the spade overall|pg||
nt|sybarra: or does that double mean something else to them?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'sd prefer a negative double, if available, then 2N giving partner a bunch of choices|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: so was W bid a psyche? or systemic|pg||
nt|tejjyid: -ve X seems reasonable as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly cannot blame south who has no move opposite 1N|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2N by S?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: stewards inquiry|pg||
nt|lestergold: er i dont think so Ellen|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no clear way of making 4 hearts or for defence to let it home|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not 2@C transfer or anything |pg||
nt|roswolf: are we live yet?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chilloncan: wow. apparently 2N was forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a simple & descriptive bid...|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and now W could bid 3N -- i'm surprised he didn't|pg||
nt|jcwla: Considering this suit leaves a lot to be desired, W should feel comfortable in thinking JT shores it up nicely when in fact it's little better than 32.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|saverio: but the seems not to have a bid showing both M so they could have wronsided the contract if they happened to have @h and not @s fit....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well said Jordan|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still down in 5@C|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes because of the overruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has wrong cards for slam... they will end up in 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't know Andy -- suppose N did have 5 diamonds?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: the 4@S bid is routine -- E doesn't need much from partner for game to be good |pg||
nt|chilloncan: looks good for W|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did they make 4 @S?  not sure I see enough tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see,  @H lead and hopped ace|pg||
nt|chilloncan: club ruffs out third, and they may have led D ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely only lose 1 trick in each side suit|pg||
nt|othered1: That doesn't come up all that often on defensive bidding, and I might think it showed a different hand with longer, better @D and a bit less outside.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This will be worse|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree you mean by N?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: fishing foir 3nt doubtless|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I have operated at his table several times, |pg||
nt|andyv:  it looks like it by the pace of the play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bg: many players do not like to doubles with voids and a weakness in defensive cards  probably best here just to overcall 1 heart|pg||
nt|saverio: wrongsided*|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it probably gets bid with your hand type more often - 19-20 balanced usually goes through a X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told most of the system development is actually done by Russ' brother|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not sure he plays it with all of his pards|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or at least not full version |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or maybe should say "this version"|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S spots certainly coming into play here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: starting with RDBL seems odd to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i suspect many Big Clubber's would open 1@S in 1st seat|pg||
nt|andyv:  he might have bid it over 3N (since his diamonds would be very good)...sometimes you just have to accept that the opps have you beat|pg||
nt|blum1956:  quick 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: Perhaps 2@C is GF clubs or balanced and he is treating this as balanced??|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: not sure I'd have responded to 1@d at all with the North cards, let alone responded 1@h. But Kokish is very big in Japan, so that a 1@d overcall has a range of about 9 to about 29|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1:  a little wild and wooly, but I'll take defending 4@S on these hands.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sunsamvar: with 2 sure trump losers Tanaka has the choice of the @S or @D fin|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Other semifinal after the first half: Hackett +15 against NED-UK|pg||

nt|rmb1: instead stopped to pick daisies|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||
nt|saverio: over 3@d it is a normal agreement to play 4@c both M with slam interest and 4@d w/out.....|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like off 3|pg||
nt|caitlin: what is aler on 1@D?|pg||
nt|caitlin: alert|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Precision|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR on board 38 now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: Korbachev has made his 5@D another 12 imp blow|pg||
nt|sharkey: at least|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: well hopefully there is a real explanation, I am getting several from kibs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tejjyid: reasonable to raise to 2@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good @D shift by Zhan forcing declarer to take the choice now..|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: South had a tough choice at trick 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  in any case, if the dbl of 4@d was a suit, then Paul was wrong, if it was lead directional, then Justin was wrong|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, how will he make it?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can't imagine introuding the @H suit though|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One heart and five trumps|pg||
nt|othered1: best lead, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told many use RDBL to show 4+@S  then North's sequence makes more sense|pg||
nt|othered1: if west goes up, the hand is over|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@h=no 4 or 5 card major|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: If youget to slam in @H, you'll make it, but it's not very good|pg||
nt|chilloncan: double not an option|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on board 20  one East made 9 tricks in 1N   the other took 6 tricks in 1NX|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: 6 dia in other room just have to be careful in the play not to ruuf spades until hearts set up|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4@h will make played by S only goes off played by N on a @s lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  awkward hand to defend|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: has Zhan mixed a club along with his @Ss|pg||
nt|jcwla: This collection of quacks is not my idea of an opening bid.  The @S bid and rebid are both unilateral shoot-the-moon moves, particularly if 2@D is known to show three.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anyway they did well to stop because it looks like 3NT is down on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A trap pass - not a good idea in my opinion|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4Sx likely spot in both rooms|pg||

nt|pelu: I have just cheked the scores: 15-17 now|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@H is a really interesting bid, which I guess they play forcing.  South still backs off with what looks like a minimum.|pg||
nt|othered1: is north still thinking?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Daily Bulletins are also to be found at   http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html  then scroll down left to Bulletins|pg||

nt|saverio: they play puppet over 1NT also or i cant understand the 2@c bid by N|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now, @H Q|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like they play 2-way Stayman (a good method, especially over weak NT)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n safer of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unclear what the bids meant after 1@S   --   i can think of a number of treatments that fit|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  South might have a 5-card major|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for me i mean|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s relay to 3N (3N by W would have been 5 @ss|pg||
nt|xenya: yet another routine game |pg||
nt|rmb1: Some double on all hands with 4+ @S (effectively as a transfer to 1@S), others play 1@s shows 5+ @S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another pleasant break and butchery breaks out|pg||
nt|caitlin: that's my failing basketball team!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was trying to poll expert Big Clubbers about that   auction to 1NX    consensus is   2@D would have been Cue|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: thankfully our operator is getting info from the players !!|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, 50 years ago it would have gone 2N-3N...shows you how bidding has improved:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|saverio: need to duck @s here (and hope for a no @h switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: sas so often the case at these colours non vul opps believe you when you bid vulnerable|pg||
nt|chilloncan: double more attractive if you had a hand where you thought 5C or 4S was likely to make. but N has too much defense to accommodate a possible club save|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: now what?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4N would have been a very descriptive bid, if quantitative.  Not sure what 5@H would mean in that context.  Perhaps a choice of game, perhaps responding to blackwood, which some do ...|pg||
nt|othered1: if continuing over a quantitative 4N.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont think 3 NT was an option|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2 way is 2@C non forcing and 2@D forcing Stayman|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe safer but looks like this will survive too|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes the clubs will take care of the losing spade|pg||
nt|caitlin: I bow|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  the question is:  was W looking for slam (if E had a 5 card @h suit) or for a 4-4 @h game? |pg||
nt|roswolf: wow!!!!!!!!!!!!11|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@h may actually be cheap insurance... the club suit was awkward for EW on defense... if declarer in 4@s could strip the side suits he could make 4@s by guessing where the A of @c is.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sunsamvar: i wd have preferred a 2@C overcall instead of 1@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless the spade is led..which it may have been|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bg: sb 11 imps to Neduk making score 15-28|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 5H totally undisciplined|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I saw a similar themed bidding problem yesterday... South needs a widr range of bids to help NOrth decidewhat to do over 4@S |pg||
nt|sybarra: unlikely to get @D right imo|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 5@H is wild, given the lack of shape/playing strength|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N should double 4@S....pass is my second choice|pg||
nt|dburn: what good would that do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: with nothing to go on east playing partner with marked high cards tries for the ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: modern players play 1@S is less than 4 in Australia|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: these teams are ranked  1 (Neduk) and  2  ;Taipei W |pg||
nt|othered1: south really hasn't had much of a chance to do something with that hand.  North will be very pleased to find the good @S tricks that never got into the auction directly.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: subtle not!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: what harm?|pg||
nt|dburn: only to P-O's reputation|pg||
nt|tejjyid: his reputation is what makes it worthwhile|pg||
nt|dburn: I see what you mean - it could gain a trick, if North were familiar with Grosvenor Gambits|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty, Kazuki Iduka, our vugraph operator, for keeping us current.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: This will be a swing againstthe 450 in the OR|pg||
nt|bg: with a spade lead it would create minor transportation problems if Wreturns a dia after winning a club lead to q|pg||
nt|bg: oops all over now n not likely to try fancy backward heart finesse|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I see no other chance for an extra trick than an error by declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: better late than never...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: easy game, as cards lie.  but north is trying to figure out how to avoid @C loser on the lead.  Playing east for J.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3S by S could not have been a slam try and almost surely not a probe for 3N. so that means it was simply establishing ownership of the hand, to set up a forcing pas situation. N ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: has absolutely zero reason to bid 5H. his offense to defense ratio is about as low as it coul be|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes like 1C-(P)-1S playing transfer responses to 1C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: declarer has a pretty good idea about the distribution- the problem is damage limitation|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes south has shown a raise with high cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: think tonight I should go to casino |pg||

nt|dburn: indeed - the flashy line is to play West for @dAJx|pg||
nt|tejjyid: The "good @S raise" needs the @D A|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tejjyid: 3@S establishes ownership, but it doesn'tspeak to offence/defense potential. Ideally you would have "ownership" bids for each|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or 1st DBL instead of 2@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I can live with it|pg||
nt|petergill: A stength of limited (11-15) opener systems is that this 4@S jump can be made on good hands, making it very dangerous for East to take-out the t/o dbl to 5@h, as East expects 5@H ...|pg||
nt|petergill: to be doubled. |pg||

nt|lestergold: one thing is clear surely north should have either doubled or passed the decision to partner simply didnt have the playimng potential for the 5 level when it was not clear that 4@s ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: was making|pg||
nt|tejjyid: those "air" quotes are very useful|pg||
nt|dburn: at least, so declarer thought, and right he was|pg||
nt|chessmaste: On the previous deal there was a case for South to double 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hello again |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: original precision would bid 2@H/3@H    but in these days of 2/1 Game Force  it's 1N|pg||
nt|rmb1: taking no prisoners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: south's sequence shows LONGER @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 5@S & 5@H the opening bid is 1@H|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chilloncan: 3H?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm for 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: and me|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes 5H was on a par with bidding 7D|pg||
nt|sybarra: W checking cards to see if same deck with transfer to clubs |pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door declarer won spade ace at trick 1 and played on clubs - Bulgarian declarer did better by ducking at trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+@S   if not 1-suit then longer 2nd suit|pg||
nt|sybarra2: its very handy,  and I wasnt thinking |pg||
nt|sybarra2: here is canape |pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobh1: 3@D very conservative|pg||
nt|bobh1: i don't think its forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when playing SemiForcing 1N    opener will pass with 11-12 HCP and 5332|pg||
nt|andyv:  courageous 1@h bid on that suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so lucky with dummy|pg||
nt|rmb1: and for one the trump beak to nil is not a problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the question i've always had about Raptor is the loss of Strong NT overcall being rolled into Takeout DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: how can it be right in open room to lead @SJ,,,,,,,he has 15 HCP, pd can't help|pg||
nt|sybarra2: N knows clubs are longer |pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: similar auction up to this point |pg||
nt|sybarra: N bid 2 @H at this point |pg||
nt|sybarra: with hts breakng not sure it matters who plays 3 nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I expected papa to bid 4@S there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i just haven't seen it enough to judge the pros/cons|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I'd rather bid 2@D the 1st time|pg||
nt|andyv:  Paul had to put on the brakes|pg||
nt|xenya: not really, Andy -- with anything better Justin would have opened :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  then what was purpose of 2@d bid by Paul?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: me, too|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe - how many diamonds did 1@d show?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm thinking as amany as 2@H...|pg||
nt|xenya: in fact that helped them to stay low|pg||
nt|andyv:  to tell the opps he had a good hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: oh just in case|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Carl Mathiesen|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Carl.|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Carl|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@C was a super-accept, EAst a little conservative|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chessmaste: Which is what happened at the other table|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has a clear cut @H lead so this shud be down fast|pg||
nt|rodal f: Got told a lot by that lead|pg||
nt|panja: on a @H lead and back, might this get restricted to 3?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: not so easy after @CQ to K - endplay on @S9 in OR to give yhe 9. triock on @HK|pg||
nt|bg: a club lead will make this hand touchy to play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might get home by leading low heart towards jack (with a good guess)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but, even if only 3, I'd still try for 2@D. Opposite precision, OK, no, I wouldn't|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, so you might bid 2@s the second time - that ought to be 4-4 in the red suits, maybe|pg||
nt|othered1: How can you beat the hand if you don't do something like that to lead declarer away from the normal, winning line?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it is a matter of style and I'm sure they know each other's much better than we do|pg||
nt|xenya: and 8 tricks seems to be the limit?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|xenya: but 4-1 in diamonds...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes and suit blocked so added problem|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|chilloncan: very instructiuve hand....if S thought his hand merited 3H, why not right away?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3@s fortuantely is not conservative altho west only has 10 high card points the playing potential of his hand is enormous with @d fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: it ws a very imaginative defence and induced declarer to go wrong|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: Kept NS, with the majority of CHP out of the auction, but missed their own good game.  Fair trade?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W has a great hand after 3D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: the @H hook will be good news|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes W bid a lot with his ten count|pg||
nt|panja: now Declarer can bring in Clubs more easily|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: not easy to do from qx|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if that's the treatment, then X followed by 2@S is OK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct   with longer [or equal] @S   South would have opened 2@C!!|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|othered1: HCP rather|pg||
nt|bg: bergen users would love this hand W not likely to pass under 4 spades if he knows pard has 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not understand open room auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I think after the XX,  3 @D is forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can just about claim 4 now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: Yang found @CQ lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|bg: with the club lead there is not much choice but to cash dia K and hope spade Q is an entry|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy to find spade next? |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  you finesse for the 10@h against W?|pg||
nt|rodal f: My fist would been a @H at trick 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: *first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everthing comes down to @DK|pg||
nt|jcwla: ace-empty fourth leads to NT...not at the top of the list.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|xenya: yes, good idea|pg||
nt|panja: no....@H seemed more attractive|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobh1: apparently that's what they think also|pg||
nt|othered1: If you have to bid 1N on north hand and it can be passed, you're putting randomizing your result.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: with the X do you think it drops singleton?|pg||

nt|saverio: (with @s 3/2)  if @h finesse loose a @d shift wd remove early the only entry left in dummy and sets the contract|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chessmaste: Maybe declarer will escape for one down - might not be too bad|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: multi 2@D weak either major or strong|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be difficult to stay away from 3 NT here|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer does not know where j@c is but on the spade switcvh he.'knows' where the k of spades is|pg||
nt|othered1: I rarely play against semiforcing NT, so I don't see it often|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S-3@H natural invite|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and the hlafway board 8 after this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 14 to poor 17|pg||
nt|pelu: @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  but the 3@c rebid would tend to show 5-4 or 5-5|pg||
nt|roswolf: true and this looks fairly routine too|pg||
mb|d|nt|bg: good spade slam declarer likely to get a club lead which means the first spade lead will be toward the king|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Molo has the Hideous Hog execute a similar manoeuvre in one of the Menagerie books|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2@S = game try in @H or pass|pg||
mb|1N|nt|odysseus69: 3D is standard although pass often works better|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: double looks like support for hts |pg||
nt|lestergold: open room auction is extraordinary|pg||
nt|chilloncan: counting HCP when 6421 is a bit like counting letters in a horses name to decide whether to bet n it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No game makes, but impossible to stay out|pg||
nt|xenya: to put it mildly|pg||
nt|tejjyid: shows that reading pays dividends at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h will be bid and may well make in practice here|pg||
nt|caitlin: last hand 3@C must have been super accept; East can now re-evaluate hand with singleton|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *Mollo|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho defence have been warned notm to lead spades or diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=a) 11--13 BAL  b) any 17+ HCP   1 round force|pg||
nt|jcwla: Likely to end in 4@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  may get to 4@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kiwibridge: 2@S buys it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 14-poor 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzyt: sigh.. i caught up|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: otherwise a hart lead will beat the spade slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: anyone for opening 2@S in 3rd position ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just makes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: people do that though|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, staying out is a pipe dream.|pg||
nt|xenya: and N has no difficulty finding a killing lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: clcik on NEC (in middle) then click on scores, or teams or what ever you are intereted in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thank you Kazuki|pg||
nt|panja: that is better..that could make 12 tricks, too|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N dbled the first time and later bid @hs so S was not sure of the 5-3 fit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: IN the OR, after an artificial 1@C opening, EW never got @S into the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Yes - but not me!|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w overbid grossly to 4@s unhpunished and n/s qityh a fair crack at  4@h not even in auctiopn|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Carl|pg||
nt|othered1: Even if you do strongly imply 6@D for a minor suit rebid in your style, west's hand qualifies.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N = 5@S  quantitative raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North will accept while showing Key Cards  [even holding only 2@S]|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and 6 will not make as I see it|pg||
nt|caitlin:  why are folks showinf jey card over quanrative bid?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: hi Sunil|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 6@C a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|tejjyid: of course, you have to bid it first|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: OUCH 15 to Heng Sha on 23|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 22, that levels it up|pg||
nt|rmb1: Open room avoid 4@SX on  22 by defending 4@HX-3 for more 800s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: at love all there is less % in pushing opponents around when you know everything is breaking |pg||
nt|caitlin:  showing key cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry meant to say IF accept ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this seems to be a safer contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956:  extremely conservative 2@s by Bakshi - and this helps his side to stop off the game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because historically  too many quantitative raises  yield slam off 2 quick tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin:  so do away w 4N as quantative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but I think this auction different than 1N-4N where there might still be a fit somewhere|pg||
nt|jcwla: You mean wasn't sure whether it was 5-3 or 6-3?|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: D + 2@H sh for sure be 5 card|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a sort of pass/correct|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = multi|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a Challenge the Champs hand, where you want to get to very good 3N, as in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  judging from the bidding in OR, I think 2@h was forcing but why would S not just bid game or later support @hs if he knew it was 5?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bg: I have been following most scores I will not be far off:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Slightly strange 2NT by South and it certainly hasn't worked well|pg||
nt|tejjyid: The open room EW on fire at the moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ed -- would you use Stayman with North hand?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: Of course, NS have to get @C on the table before they get discarded|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: me neither -- flimsy suit, 6-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: entries to the north hand will kill this contract|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lack of entries ie|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@S maded in OR - some work for decl|pg||
nt|othered1: no, but I'd raise.  But my NT overcalls are very sound.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chessmaste: I confess I would have risked the @C A as East |pg||
nt|othered1: I guess south seems something attractive about leading their suit, not the unbid . .. |pg||
nt|othered1: I guess south was looking to find @D signleton in north's hand for a ruff.  Imaginative but possible|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  being nude :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sunsamvar: @D now|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks pretty hopeless|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not attractive to play for 3-1 spades since it wont be possible to take heart finesse |pg||
nt|odysseus69: possible now so could go wrong|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thinking can be dangerous|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|othered1: he'll shortly claim 6 and 5 imps, noting that he could have been held with @H lead, possible on other auctions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh   i would have passed without hesitation|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sharkey: If there ever was a flat board this may be it|pg||
nt|rmb1: ruffing @D finesse for +1 :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sunsamvar: Zhan ensuring that the @H suit does not get blockd|pg||
nt|roswolf: inscrutable chinese system|pg||
nt|jcwla: Positional evaluation of @DT :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  could have gotten 4@s tricks by ducking the 8@s|pg||
nt|blum1956:  I guess 4 of 5 would have opend one spade with West's hand |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra2: no clue what that comment was|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that was interesting|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: pins it all on @H hook for just making?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on previous board  Bakshi made 3@D where we say 3NX -800    |pg||
nt|ahollan1: here -- Gold also overcalled 2@S   presumably showing @S & @C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hope someone is thinking rather than another impending room crash|pg||
nt|sybarra2: lets hope so|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  N has not guessed well this hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: south isn't a 1N overcall to me.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DKQ dubious, non-vul   even opposite 16-18 overcall i think i'd pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well there is that too :)|pg||
nt|othered1: (quietly) mine are 16+ to 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Edgar Kaplan would be proud of you Ed|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: with K of @D it got a lot easier |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chessmaste: Very lucky for E/W |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's difficult for South because a raise to 3@d can have a very wide range |pg||
nt|odysseus69: no need for heart hook with 2 discards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N kind of fixed|pg||
nt|rmb1: Will declare run a small @D from N?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not kind of - screwed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: d king marked|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: may keep this to down 1 as N will be endplayed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Justin Hackett used DBL instead of 1N|pg||
nt|othered1: That's pretty much where I picked it up -- and it's served me well|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess North is marker with both red suit honours|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sunsamvar: he will try the @D fin for an outside chance to make i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: but more likely to find losers disappeaing as they have|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean @ds rebid and not supported what shance for ruff?|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think iw ould have put A@h on table to have alook as well as go for playing tru8mps if thaT LOOKS RIGHT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have to do it live. Not always easy.|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|othered1: double is OK and would be my choice|pg||
nt|caitlin:  not a lucky hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the approach shows that bridge is not black or white    Quant raises get partner's opinion   sometimes the opinion is  "i'm not sure but better than reject"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: action in the other room    South in 2@D RDBL   [2@D was game forcing stayman]|pg||
nt|caitlin:  if over 4N  showing Key cards, you must be sure, if need be, you can get out at 5N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China has won imps on  5 of 7 boards and pushed 1|pg||
nt|caitlin:  no running score?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: NS's discards appear to indicate that the @D finesse doesn't work, but who knows |pg||
nt|xenya: so a push|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: 3 down now -- a @H return would have secured a 4th undertrick|pg||

nt|othered1: there are 8 boards left (9 comparisons) but Beijing Trienergy better pick up some steam soon|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice endplay to lose how many imps vs 2@DXX making overtricks??|pg||

nt|roswolf: this will be an achievement to sniff a slam let alone bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: at what levels does he have natural @H bids (or transfers)?|pg||

mb|d|nt|sybarra: is this a funky flannery? or ??|pg||
nt|bg: aggressive start not recommended unless you have plenty of time for discuusions|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: agresive 3@D block Nvul fron S|pg||
nt|chilloncan: scoreboard insufficiently blood-flecked|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the @C holding is insurance|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h will work, but I don't understand it at all|pg||
nt|dburn: if it isn't forcing, then I almost understand it, but...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: King may have asked for unblock|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vul   how weak can 3@H really be?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can s prevent w fromn showing majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+  and possible canape -- 3rd seat means HCP don't really matter :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and a canape into clubs coming|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H always less than game force|pg||
nt|panja: 5@H sac for NS..Ew can of course make 11 or 12 in @S..but will NS bid fast?|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS have to be careful not to push them into 6|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: 4@h - 4@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand now gold|pg||
nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed otherwise 5@H is interesting|pg||
nt|panja: true...always a dilemma..whether to speed up and end up pushing them into a good slam..|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@s almost automatic and W may bid 6|pg||
mb|3S|nt|tejjyid: stuck because I don't want to pass out 2@S X'ed, or bid 4@H over the top of it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Opportunity for Shenzhen here|pg||
nt|sybarra: too late for coffee can we have a glass of wine instead?|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 3nt E end contract|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E seems to have passed a hand vastly better than the one he opened a minute ago, and vul both times|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: South must be thinking of Slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW being shut out here despite 23 HCP between them|pg||
nt|panja: not easy to make though|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: E let him go|pg||
nt|pelu: operator are u sure 2NT by S or by West?|pg||
nt|dburn: you can't afford to be predictable|pg||
nt|chilloncan: probably he hates opening 1D with nothing there|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we have a club player who always passes opening bids but do not expect to see it at this level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in olden days [instead of going to class] we would play the game of hollering out a number to see if people could guess result|pg||
nt|andyv:  costly 5@h bid|pg||
nt|panja: trump lead...surely?|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump lead?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: 6@C is a fine spot and not automatic to find with this competition|pg||
nt|othered1: was double forced?|pg||
nt|roswolf: niet|pg||
nt|panja: ruff, @DK and a small @C...that will be a good try|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: ok here we are|pg||
nt|dburn: South at the other table bid a forcing 2@h, which worked rather well|pg||
nt|dburn: North at this table didn't do enough bidding - after all, he could make a slam facing six hearts to the king-jack and zip|pg||
nt|tejjyid: exactly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't remember if original precision defined DBL as 5-8 HCP versus 3-level interference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe it was Negative ??|pg||
nt|othered1: with a friendlier trump break and a @H lead, this might make on a good day|pg||
nt|andyv:  too bad that 4@h had no play|pg||
nt|rodal f: N have good cards now after the pass at 2NT.|pg||
nt|andyv:  (unless @d was led)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Heng Sha gain on  24 when opponents don't bid game, match almost tied|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP just needs to guess the minor suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but scoring has changed since then so i don't think 960 was ever an answer back then|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: and then I am lost after that|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or even lead spade and have Vehees hope for the best with club switch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's still time from South|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bg: another 12 imps if he makes Taipei off 100 in 4 H|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H only down 1 after lead of @DQ to ruff in N|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to be club return,    this gets tricky |pg||
nt|jcwla: Oopsie.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: his hand is too good.. but :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming game force -- not an unreasonable guess from South|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec suggests 7@h... I don't think N was ready for that when he bid 5@h |pg||
nt|panja: if South flys with @CA...will be an easy make|pg||
nt|vugraphzyt: Note: Final segment starts 18:20 =80 minutes later.  a bit earlier |pg||
nt|roswolf: slam was not and may not make anyway once the poisoned arrow is let loose(5@H) YOU WAIT TO SEE WHOSE EYE IT LANDS IN:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: hello there|pg||
nt|sybarra: bjr henri @H |pg||
nt|bg: Hi Henri|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a 5@H bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps defending is the winning option here|pg||
nt|othered1: Then he's forcing the 5-level over a rather likely 4@D.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jameslee 2: looking for 9 tricks in East hand , 2@D/4@C/1@S/2@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  If S was going to bid up to 4@s, why not just bid 4@s immediately?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: easy if @C back: 5 @H-tricks (after the opening in N) 2@c+2@D|pg||
nt|xenya: something has gone very wrong here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: easy 9 tricks now - tough to avoid heart lead after 2H bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i forgot to alert   DBL was Support  [exactly 3@H]|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: given the bidding,  and this lead,  declarer gets a bunch of ht tricks now|pg||
nt|pelu: yes @C to Q ( or even A and Q)|pg||
nt|ritong: if north has the 5 @hs promised, nothin bad can happen|pg||
nt|ritong: @s are locked|pg||
nt|chilloncan: welcome dburn, prince of the unpreditable. nobody expects the spanish inquisition|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: there really is no falsecard from West that will hide his holding|pg||
nt|sybarra2: thia |pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: could be big swing here|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades are, but declarer doesnt know that |pg||
nt|ritong: he does|pg||
nt|ritong: he held 108|pg||
nt|bg: "the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain"|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree with Justin's bidding -- once you elect to overcall with 1@S you are practically forced to bid 4 later cat these colours |pg||
nt|sybarra2: this should work|pg||
nt|andyv:  good duck|pg||
nt|roswolf: good defence|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: so what does S pitch on all the hts coming?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough hand call for South -- so Hanlon's choice of 3@H did it's job in that respect|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: *at, not "cat"|pg||
nt|rodal f: U can ask. Same as. Why didn't N support|pg||
nt|xenya: bad hand |pg||
nt|andyv:  makes more sense|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: so there is no layout losing three @s tricks directly|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I don't think 4@s can make but maybe 4@h might|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm with Edgar Kaplan, as quoted in today's bulleting - there should be a fractional imp charge for every bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told, 2C = XYZ inv checkback,  but interesting we are not in spades|pg||
nt|tejjyid: That  would make for shorter auctions...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chinese North started with 1N [13-15]   Gold DBL to show 4@H/@S & 5+@C/@D|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sharkey: oops...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West is close to a 2@h overcall even after South's 1@h|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would do it if not vulnerable|pg||
nt|chessmaste: We should credit South for responding 1@H rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|chessmaste: MAFIA style|pg||
nt|panja: and now, since @D aren't 43..no chance of making..|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sunsamvar: and the North pass has cost Shenzhen 22 imps.. lose 11 instead of gaining 11|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: 6nt best to protect the @Sk|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@H confirmimg @H suit|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4 or more quick tricks and 4 or fewer losers, 2@C the opening and slam within sight - would be huge not to give Shenzhen a gain here after getting to this slam.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: crunch time|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|sybarra: 7 @D and 2 aces?  spades are blocked arent they?   and k of spades natural lead |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the higher ranked team from the qualifying Swiss has a carryover of 0.5 imps to act as tiebreaker|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think 2N is game try with exactly 4@H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this is a pesky 4/1 break |pg||
nt|sybarra2: can he handle it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not to mention the pesky duplicated shape or pesky lack of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra2: true|pg||

nt|sharkey: What is 6@C?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: I like that|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bg: all depends on how David handles 10 trumps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was 4@C nat or control ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure - East must know  the Grand is not in the picture|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D may be controls...|pg||

nt|jcomyn: at the crossroads|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: this should work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  9  3N only down 1 so another 3 imps for NEDUK|pg||

nt|Walddk4: We will start the last segment 15 minutes earlier than scheduled time, 18:20 in Yokohama, in 1 hour and 10 minutes.|pg||

nt|vugraphzys: 3@c is a relay, 3@d shows 5-card minor, 3@h asks which, 3@s says 5@D.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If South is of a different religion, and wants to try to find partner's suit ... he's starting off with basically a one-in-three chance|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't know what the 3 level bids mean, but it looks like West was (somehow) checking if 3NT really is the right contract. |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzys: sorry, 5@c|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, the lower step showing the lower suit ... this checkback after Stayman is a good method|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You can also use it to discover a 5-card major in opener's hand (if your religion allows it)|pg||
nt|petergill: Assuming D4 was 4th best (so S must have QJ7), if South sets up @d's next, and South had @CK, then the safe hand (S) would be on lead. |pg||

nt|andyv:  that would be scary|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C explained as natural GF or something else -- here it is the former|pg||

nt|jcwla: I think many players have too low a maximum range for their balancing NT over a major, especially a spade.  I totally agree with the 1NT in OR.|pg||

nt|chilloncan: statistical result to practical application. rthe donwside of faulure is to gruesome to make the bet|pg||
nt|andyv:  lots of things can go wrong on this one for the defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D natural and forcing    unclear which red suit longer|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and they land  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and another foul split in trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Liu Haitao has reached same end postion in 4@H on board 10|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: and with east having both red entries, the board will tie at 400|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right - partnership morale has to be taken into consideraton, & when it goes wrong, it is usually ugly|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose you could take the view that if partner doesn't have the ace, declarer will make the contract anyway, but...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I'm 1@H|pg||
nt|xenya: not me|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is the hand where as W if you are playing 2/1 and hear 1NT forcing by pd over 1@H you are consigned to rebid 2@C...|pg||
nt|jcwla: There we agree, Andy.|pg||
nt|panja: right...that wide range induces a bit of 'free' behaviour later|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Both E's passed over 1@H-1@S, would anyone have done anything different?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that is why i wd consider the 1 nt opening Jordan|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: doesns't look like a spinter to me.  too many possible tricks in @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: the lead=I have more @D's in my hand than you do in both hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: McGann's PASS denied 3+@H  [support double would apply]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this looks like nice contract|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: nice guess of trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: at the table you would not do it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: partnership is not the worst of it. teammates and captain are almost surely going to take a dimmer view still|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thre was a 1980's BW article on this, and I saw Srere do it from KQJx once|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *Seres|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think support doubles are ok but should not be mandatory - I would bid 1NT on this South hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 10, S bid directly to 4@s and didn't get dbld, so 2 more imps for the NEDUK team|pg||
nt|andyv:  what do you shift to?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: going all out this could make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  here, E's dbl worked against him because of his @h shortage|pg||
nt|pelu: but what sh East bid? 2NT?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ritong: presuming east short in @cs, declarer should tackjle trumps the right way|pg||
nt|andyv:  part scores are ok sometimes|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR over 2@D and X by pd?|pg||
nt|panja: Pass with 2 small Spades ?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S X|pg||
nt|panja: if 15 or 16 is the maximum for 1Nt...is there a need for an active dbl?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S easy make by NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's a problem...I don't know if EW play lebensohl in OR because dbl by W made things very awkward |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: But what makes you think you make 3NT if you bid it?|pg||

pc|d5|nt|xenya: @D?|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Declarer still has only six tricks|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Six is better than five|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  South maybe expecting partner to have a singleton club when West bid NT and North didn't lead them|pg||
nt|panja: will 2@S make on a @S lead?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chilloncan: yes, that proves the point ,,,,sere, he did it under an assumed name:):)|pg||

pc|h5|pg||

nt|xenya: E can duck this endplaying S|pg||
nt|rodal f: They have there meanings. Opening major by 4-4ma/mi so now it was a longer @S than 4. X for reopen is OK, but what id S had 6@S - 2@H  - 2@D - 3@C? In troubble? Well it wourks:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Slam bid on 41 in the closed room; looks like it's going down. Crucial board|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|bjacobs: That would be the upper range of most people's balancing 1NT I would think|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = take out|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An optimistic double|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|petergill: and it will be taken out :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I see three queens - what other assets are there I should be seeing?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3-deuces??|pg||
nt|petergill: two tens?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: that about sums it up|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: A big overbid, but it looks like 3NT is an effective sacrifice against the making 2@S|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|petergill: 3NT down in 50s is better than -470 if the Dbl is passed, though 110 to NS is not certain if 2@S is passed out.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would 2NT not have been a cheaper sacrifice?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|petergill: Yes, but East had a maximum with that nice @S10 for the double stopper. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D down 2 on 41   thats 13 for NEDUK   [name from home of the 2 pairs  Netherlands + UK]|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh  6@S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|d5|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|nt|petergill: and if West had as little as @HJ extra, then 3NT is a great contract. Actually, if South has @SHJx, 3NT is good too.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes Peter, I agree with 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East has clearly bid sensibly.  A heavy 1NT when the alternative was worse, and then 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double is dubious|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: "Dubious" ... I like that, it's about right|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Ifelt the @D strength offset the general weakness of the hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: In addition to 5-4 in M I think you're too top heavy in @H to open 1 NT - though I see the problem with 1 NT from pd|pg||
nt|sharkey: Standings: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: pity they can't update the site periodically|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strong 1@C from north?|pg||

nt|roswolf: well b2 imps back|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: oh for the axe|pg||

nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah  much better|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: lol,  but there are amongst us|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-16 HCP, 4+@D unbalanced   and as we see  "may have longer @C"|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as we go|pg||
nt|andyv:  any good contract for either side?|pg||
nt|xenya: and +100 on 11 doesn't seem too bad either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = BAL, 8-13 HCP  [game force]|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like the big @C forces a 2@C opening on west's hand, a weak spot in bid @C systems.|pg||
nt|othered1: west rightfully treats his hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|blum1956:  And will probably come even more close after the previous board|pg||
nt|andyv:  Paul needs to put his hands in his pockets now|pg||
nt|rodal f: X from E to tell I wanted to X 1@S?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C art GF relay|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 8 obvious tricks in 3NT - can declarer/defence produce a 9th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C RELAY for more info|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not an auction i was expecting|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no - now, @D J lead for maximum stress|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky the @D's are the way they are|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, low @D forpost-maximum stress|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh,  j of @D lead, :( hate it|pg||
nt|othered1: GIB  would make 6@S on this, but GIB peeks.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another [lack of] support double situation|pg||
nt|roswolf: south  in the other room bought an awful dummy for his overcall of 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: part score swing|pg||
nt|chessmaste: All Stars have a 10VP 'cushion', so any win will see them through|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i saidn it was cold but not completely single dummy|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@D splinter ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably a full shape description|pg||
nt|jcomyn: prefer 2h here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe pass now and 3NT from North to show d honour|pg||
nt|rmb1: Needs to find out about @DK singleton for 3NT|pg||
nt|rmb1: Running out of room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that 3d took up a lot of space|pg||
nt|odysseus69: pass and redouble are extras from oppo|pg||
nt|rmb1: Perhaps can gain some room by using the double:  Pass or XX ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed relay takes advantage of such doubles|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i think he has to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South worried (wrongly) that pass might suggest playing in 3dX (redouble would)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C  11-13  4@C & 4 other|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chilloncan: not sure why 2S appeals, with playability in both majors and only suit announced by opps is clubs|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 2D i mean|pg||
nt|dburn: well, look at the result|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 imps|pg||
nt|dburn: if he'd bid only 1@d, South would maybe have had some chance to bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think North has been a little conservative not X'ing on the 2nd round|pg||
nt|othered1: There's a case to bid with both hands.  I double on north's hand either my first or second at bat.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: also, South might balance - I'm sympatheticto the 1st pass by South, with the soft cards & misfit, but defending 2@D won't be much fun|pg||
nt|lestergold: it shouold be now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North has shown 5-4-1-3 but suit qualities etc still unknown|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooh er|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: 2N looks reasonable at this point|pg||
nt|othered1: if east reopens with a double are you allowed to pass as west?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not after @HA @C ruff  |pg||
nt|othered1: Guess you are.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or down 2 if 6@S East|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: here 4@S looks normal and it will make if you can hold the @C losers to 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: but q of @H back?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: then what do you do after k of @D?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did not need it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the son may have to talk to the dad after this hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: where are thy going now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rmb1: here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D ask   3@S =  44 blacks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now stop bouncing up and down in your chair|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: oh well,   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: this actually gets @S played by the best side|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is none too comfortable either|pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt shd make..|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: 3N likely now|pg||
nt|sybarra2: nice |pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: at these colours i would have thought 2@d normal|pg||
nt|andyv:  another expensive one |pg||
nt|rodal f: Still tough, if N made 2@S?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Direct|pg||
nt|andyv:  low club lead now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not interested:) hehe|pg||
nt|andyv:  or @d, @d ruff and then low @c|pg||
nt|pelu: in 2Nt u have all the risk - and no gain|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and pushed them too high|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: because this time tough to guess trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, N overcalled immediately (2@D) -- i like this sequence better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Quick, grab a coffee|pg||
nt|jcomyn: up the creek i suggest|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: inelegant at best|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: on that auction, absolutely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: single dummy 3N is a bit scary -- but as cards lie   no worries|pg||
nt|sybarra2: seems didnt matter given score at other table |pg||
nt|andyv:  and lose imps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: South can't continue @H without easing McGann's pain|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sunsamvar: maybe duck this may have led to some possibility of end play... but not here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and if @D shift   fly King  finesse @S    even if that loses  5@S 2@D 1@H 1@C for 9|pg||
nt|othered1: even if south could have returned low, west has simple avoidance play in @S|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh I hadn't thought about @HQ at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nice play!|pg||
nt|othered1: nice play, changing the picture for declarer a bit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck seems right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: usual 5-0 they should have known|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra2: unless "we" are going on |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about 4@C :(|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: moreover, the opponents had not announced clubs, otherwise they would be playing in them|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hawe45:  IsÂ´nt 3 @C maybe a winner, so that 3 @H is the right move?|pg||
nt|xenya: well done indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no swing here so 2 to come|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: is the dbl asking for @C lead or @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  this hand will fall appart rapidly now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there's the 5-0 break gary you were talking about earlier|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: indeed|pg||
nt|sharkey: Possibilities if E decides to set up @C suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: X may discourage that?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chilloncan: not saying it can never work. it is always about relative probabilities|pg||
nt|andyv:  E just needs to knock out the A of @c|pg||
nt|jcwla: The 1NT rebid must have a relatively wide range as the W hand evaluates out to not much more than 5.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: Now he makes is if he goes after clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will he after the x?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Must decide which suit breaks, if any|pg||
nt|xenya: highly imaginative double by N -- particularly if it asked for a spade lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Likely gifted declarer 1 trick|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think he'll go for @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: My prediction record is not very good :(|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now maybe only 1 down|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: that could have been embarassing   if @HK WAS onside   South gets to ruff|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: Now a second chance for the defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but McGann sees that playing @S from top protects @HJ|pg||
nt|othered1: now his avoidance was to keep south off lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i missed that too|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: hardly fun for NS here, but the contract might be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  @C return seems lazy for W... why not play Q@h?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bet they p[lay 3nt in open|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if they hadnt announced them, that makes the objective of preempting against hem even less appealing|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but the truth is that against nebulous minor openings, it really does pay to pre-empt even on off-kilter hands|pg||
nt|sharkey: The @D6 may deny an Honor with N|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: If S takes the K and return @D East will be forced to play on @C as no entry to @H even if split 3-3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: still looks like 2 down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: you got it John|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that club 8 looks big|pg||
nt|rmb1: Aren't declarer's honours enough for -1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if he guesses to play low here then 1 down but how can he do that|pg||
nt|rmb1: closed room making 3NT (I am told)|pg||
nt|rmb1: @HQ loses to K, @H back, @CK @CJ @SA cross ruff for -1|pg||
nt|andyv:  now even easier|pg||
nt|pelu: decl need @HK onside - or 2@C-tricks+ 4 tricks in @d|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: cant play low surely|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kiwibridge: NEDUK 59-52 after 8 vs Hackett I'm told|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he could rise and play for spades 3-3 and clubs 3-2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: in south's defense, partner did only overcall and then not act again, he's misfit, and west often has in imperfect 2@D bid over the negative double.  Defending could be only plus.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sharkey: This leaves E a losing option|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: But I'd have bid at my first turn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HA was another nice try from @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from S  not  @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wang is giving himself a lot of chances|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: In OR Patrick Huang in East - in 3. seat - open 1@H - and NS never found the combined @H-stop: 5@C -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry all,  this is last hand I believe |pg||
nt|pelu: why?|pg||
nt|sybarra: we hope to have tables connected in the next set|pg||
nt|ritong: scoreboard says 14|pg||
nt|sybarra: score says 14,  but they seem to set it up with 2 extra bds |pg||
nt|ritong: oh|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry maybe it is 14 |pg||
nt|ritong: very prudent:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yesterday they set it up with 16 |pg||
nt|sybarra: and it was 14  so what do I know |pg||
pc|h7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wiped the deficit plus some|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i think @D42 and @S31 will force @C finesse   or maybe pop-up squeeze|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  down 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Time for a endplay made at trick to?|pg||
nt|panja: risky cashing of @D..|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|sybarra2: S has to pitch all hts |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|panja: he could have played @C and claimed 8 tricks instead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra2: why pitch clubs?|pg||
