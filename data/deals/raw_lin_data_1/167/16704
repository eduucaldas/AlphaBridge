nt|jbgood: 3@h singelton showing - may or may not have 4 @s|pg||
nt|iceking: its still a slam with one ace missing and trump Q there was a reason rkcb was invented|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but rkc can't locate @SJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: so 3@S askes and 4@H will confirm 4@S |pg||

nt|dburn: Helgemo just bidding out his shape, but it looks as though Helness thought 3@d might have been fourth suit, which is why he didn't just bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztd: S was not thinking before passing.|pg||
