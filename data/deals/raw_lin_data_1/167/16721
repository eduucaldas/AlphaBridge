nt|subhranp: are they playing demicoma?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: if Prasun had overcalled 2@C as i wd have it might have been interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: 4@H has pretty good chances?|pg||

nt|subhranp: good 4d bid, now East can consider 5h|pg||
nt|panja: unfortunately, it will give away killing lead.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: dont think 4@S can score on trump lead... but tough for E to pass|pg||
nt|toral5: wel done|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: this cud be a costly board.... Azure Hooda back in lead|pg||
nt|panja: they are playing demicoma I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: i dont see NS missing slam on this in OR|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes, no wonder poddar has been doing well in the last one year|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: vessels  picked up another 8  on board 3|pg||
nt|panja: E should lead @HA..find out about W's pref..but even in dark|pg||

nt|panja: it makes the bad bidding look good..|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes agree with you fully|pg||
nt|panja: had he held @Hkxx...there would have been some justification for leading a small @S|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzvz: 3rd dble was perhaps bad , unnecessary|pg||
