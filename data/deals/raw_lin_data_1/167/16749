nt|_fonzie__:  although he does not have 9 tricks yet|pg||
nt|sundiszno: indeed not so easy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sundiszno: he needs the extra @h trick, and a @c trick too|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sundiszno: now it became easier|pg||
nt|sundiszno: @c trick in pocket|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  he can safely play a high club from his hand now|pg||

nt|vugraphzyn: Here it is Welcome all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: tough handf to start with. D suit not much use in nt, so ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|Walddk7: Hello John and Mike|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 2S by S is just the wrong thing to do|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and Frederic, our operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: E wont think much of w bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi John Roland Frederick and specs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzyn: Hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: mawnin mikle|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: thats the irish spelling of michael|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: only making game bypASSED|pg||
nt|lestergold: cheeky barrage has done its damage|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: west had a serious problem too strong for 3@c|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: and as we can see 41s a very sensible contract unfortunately not today|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 9 tricks on top and now a real horror|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: 6-0 breaks not the way to spend sunday mornin|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcomyn: why did s not double - cant be takeout|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if 3nt not bid no way are bthey bidding 4nt kloen|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: had south passed with his pile of garbage bidding liekly woujld have been 2@d cue by west 2@s by east 3@c by west 3n by East|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: moral of the story......|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcomyn: await developments before jumping in|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 0f hearts coudl hardly cost|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: well i do not want to encourage too many raises with 3 to the J and out|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of the story is that putting a spoke in often works|pg||
nt|lestergold: sometimes backfires also|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why not wait and see what opps do and then clobber bem|pg||
nt|lestergold: because what opps would have done here was ti get to laydown 3N|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine playing in game in the opps weak suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed laydown 4N|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: might prove costly declarer could do with 5 heart tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: playing low on heart lead would work if south held Ten or Jack without the 8 it is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: ie setting up finesse position on next round but that would involve a guess- and north has led a heart in spite of the bid on his left|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence of course may well find it difficult not to give declarer a 9th  trick one way or the other|pg||
nt|lestergold: not obvious but best for defence to take 1d and return it|pg||
nt|lestergold: very tricky hand communcations not great for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jim Patrick|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Hello there|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult for defence too south is worried about entry for the A@c in due course not easy to see that the 7@d is that entry eventually|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi jim|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||

pc|h4|pc|d3|pc|c3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: agreed but it is the opps you want to clobber if possible before 3nt|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|lestergold: and south will be endplayed forced to concede 9th grick in a minor|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|sundiszno: that is supposed to be bicolore?|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  spades + minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and 3 @C is pass or correct|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  5@s; 4+m|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  3@c is invitational with minors|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|_fonzie__:  2nt would be weak or strong|pg||

nt|jcomyn: is that the curxse of scotland or was that the 9 of something else|pg||
nt|lestergold: Engel refused to be sunject to indignity of endplay!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|lestergold: 9 is of course the curse of something but not scotland hats 9@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: historical reason for that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: someone once wrote battle plans on the 9@d|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: no doubt showing both majors|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: yep thats it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well cards spitting so n/s will get the plus score they were deqalt|pg||

nt|lestergold: seems u were dealt that to lead but as it happens 2 off whatever|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|lestergold: relays transfers etc hardly anything means what it says anymore|pg||
nt|jcomyn: honestrly i dont see the point|pg||

pc|cA|nt|boedhy: it is an interesting discussion tho. Drijver Brink use very advanced bidding and Drijver told me it is their main point why they are doing so well. |pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence can hold this to 2|pg||
nt|boedhy: As the Italians were a couple of years ago and Helgemo Helness or Meckwell in their days|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe not on second thoughts|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4@s inevitable to be bid and always off|pg||

nt|2hplus4: Even the nice lie in the @D suit does not help enough|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: switch could have been very costkly if declarer had held Q instead of J!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|h2|nt|boedhy: shouldnt he have played a @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bribnk and Drijver are a very hard pair to play against because they seem to get on the right side of almost every auction |pg||

mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  1@s is transfer walsh, showing @d or a balanced hand|pg||
nt|sundiszno: which is good for the leading team, of course|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sundiszno: fancy system|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|sundiszno: he should not cover this|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  he wont|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lestergold: a lot play like that but they do it well|pg||
mb|1D|mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: is it all artificial then|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u bid suits that u havent got to show what u have got it does make it difficult for opps|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I'd open W hand with 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: because their bids often become ambiguous is double for takeouit or showing the suit thats been bid etc....|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: its difficult to prepare defences to every crazy system thats thrown at u thats why top teams often employ coaches who are system experts|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i would too but some styles require more playing strength vul we've all been punished  for indiscreet weak 2s|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: sort of mixture of  Walsh, martens, carrot and ekrons|pg||

mb|4S|nt|lestergold: much better than playing a@h and then guessibng on next round but today |pg||

nt|lestergold: because he had 4 hearts and was disciplined|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|lestergold: old fashioned idea not to preemopt in 1 major when you hold 4 in other in front of pard |pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: but it seems the likely explanation u were seeking|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i knew what u would say and i knew i would disagree|pg||
nt|boedhy: bidding looks ok. But maybe because of the double he will get the @h right??|pg||
nt|uttam: or guess the dias, lose a h club and dia= all roads lead to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|uttam: looks 11 now|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

nt|uttam: w d ace coming down|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|lestergold: every bidding principle propostition has a counter argument|pg||
