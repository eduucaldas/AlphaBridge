nt|pelu: we missed Board 13 from start|pg||
nt|fluffy: Javier Graupera is trying a psyche 2@s bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: hard to beat the other room here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: u would open 4@S - so u sh be prepered for that hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: this catched Llluis Malla off guard|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh oh, Graupera in trouble|pg||
nt|fluffy: NS had a missunderstanding that led to a cold contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: this is fun :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|fluffy: last hand of first set, 15 minutes break for you, and then we come back with another 12 boards|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: did S pass?????????????|pg||
mb|5C|nt|fluffy: 2@s is not natural because 1NT denied 4 spades|pg||
nt|fluffy: so it means... something else|pg||
nt|rodal f: Txs all the I got the possibility to comment here. Nice inputs from some of u.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: uh ohhh|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: and the psyche works!|pg||
nt|pelu: surprise attack: @DQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: 24 balanced again not worth a game|pg||
nt|fluffy: neither low heart not @hQ work on this hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: but @hA would at least prevent declarer from making 2 tricks on the suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|fluffy: ohhh|pg||
nt|fluffy: but still needs to guess hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: a fall from grace :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: Wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: a good guess and 1 IMP win|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: hi operator - did S pass?|pg||
nt|fluffy: on the end NS did the right thing to stay away from this awful game|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fluffy: you need to play penalty doubles of new suits after a preemptive opening|pg||
nt|fluffy: because psyches are much more common than other situations|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fluffy: with AQ10 if you ahve to lead the suit, you have to guess if you ahve no entry, but with a side entry I think @hA is the best lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: to catch any honnor singleton or doubleton in dummy|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: or are we playing 1@sX|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|fluffy: but with every red suit 3-3, @dK onside and @s 4-4 there is no way to go down on 3NT, nor 4@h, not even 5@d|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|fluffy: perhaps south was distracted|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u have 9 it's right to bid it Gonzalo:) Else....|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|fluffy: or operator was distracted and north took an agressive pass|pg||
nt|pelu: still trying to count all his HCP :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I wasn't paying atention did north hesitate before passing out?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Needed only a @D hook 3-3 and 9 on so 50%|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pelu: ???|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fluffy: some mistakes on the board, for sure, we will find out what really happened after the break|pg||
nt|fluffy: see you all in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 1Poc Doubled -pass pass pass|pg||
nt|fluffy: so Peter was right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: Boaed one 1 pic -3 no doubled|pg||
nt|fluffy: 500 or 150?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|fluffy: decalrer might mathe the rest squeezing Graupera on the minors|pg||

mb|p|nt|fluffy: Hi all This is the Open de Cataluña tournament played in Barcelona|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: this match features Juanito Pont and Javier Graupera (NS) one of the best and most succesful pairs in Spain all time against Xavi Massana and Norberto Bocchi, not a regular pair as ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: long as I know|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fluffy: they are confirming me now, Javier Graupera actually passed 1@s with 20 HCP on board 1 on the last set and collected +150 only|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|fluffy: I think East opened a multi 2@d showing a weak in a major hand or 22-23 balanced|pg||
nt|fluffy: or maybe 2@d is just GF hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@s might be artificial|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|fluffy: 2NT is a balanced hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@h is a transfer bid showing spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 1@s is I think Brazilian style, showing a forcing 1NT hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: this is the only way to show 10-11 HCP support for hearts|pg||
nt|fluffy: if Llluis opted for showing spades he would have to force to game|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fluffy: and Xavi now bis 3NT as choice of games|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 2D its For.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 23+|pg||
nt|fluffy: Norberto picks 3NT with his stiff spade|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fluffy: thank you|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|fluffy: some might be surprised by the decision of Norberto to show a balanced hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: it is a very common "lie" to show a balanced hand with 4441 and 5431 with a stiff King or Ace|pg||
nt|fluffy: the reason is that showing your shape, specially 4441 across as well as strenght is very complicated, takes 3 rounds of bidding, and in the end partner is unsure if you have 18 or ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: 23|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fluffy: Nacho only has 11 HCP,but he goes for game, 6-4 hands only require the correct 18 HCP to make game (@hAKQ @dAKQ), this is just a dream hand, but actually with a 6-4 hand you might ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: make game with a lot less than 25 HCP|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fluffy: but when you just go with the balanced approach you define your hand in 1 bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: or something very close to it :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|fluffy: saly for him partner had zero points in his suits, not even @h10 wich would be enough to make game after a non trump lead|pg||

pc|c8|pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|fluffy: perfect play by Nacho Jover lookign for his only chance to make|pg||

nt|fluffy: Walter Johnson will soon join the comentators "team" (that is me at the moment), thx a lot Walter|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ga/e :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: this requires to trust partner's spade count with a lot of faith|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: A superb result on previous board by EW thx to the unlucky diamond lead from south|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: even without the @D lead it looked like they would be able to scramble 9 tricks and only had 4 losers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|bigtrain: but the @D lead surely put declarer at ease|pg||
nt|fluffy: at the other table Bocchi found the @sA duck but his partner slipped a bit in the endgame not puling trumps|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer "should" missguess clubs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fluffy: yes, to defeat it it would be needed some perfect defence, winning @sA on first round wich is almost impossible from the bidding|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bigtrain: looks like declarer will lose the race to 7 here|pg||
nt|fluffy: graupera makes an agressive switch now, clubs would be great if partner had @cA or @cJ, but sadly he has neither this time|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he may even go -2|pg||
nt|fluffy: the proper way to play @cKJ10x vs @cAxxx or @cAJ10x vs @cKxxx is to play the lonely top honnor first|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fluffy: and then finese the queen by low to 10 or jack|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pelu: would u play @D4 or @D10 from that holding?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|favallu: hola a todos|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|fluffy: why? because if you play a force finese by winning @cA and running the @cJ, you only make 3 tricks if the suit breaks 4-1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that's looking at the suit in isolation of course...  other information may (and usually does) indicate a different path|pg||

pc|d4|nt|fluffy: and Walter :) I was feeling lonely here|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fluffy: if hearts were 4-3 south would be squeezed and the contract might make, but as it is NS have 7 easy tricks|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer did the right thing to go on spades, if e tries a diamond adventure he loses another trick|pg||
nt|fluffy: Yes as you can see, declarer started the hand by palying hearts|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|fluffy: the reason this time is, that you want to knock out north's entry if he has one before touching clubs|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bigtrain: i tend to lead low from 5+card suits and the honor sequences from shorter ones (to avoid blockage problems)|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|fluffy: yes more or less, EW play some gadgets|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: like gazilli and some other stuff I am not very familiar with|pg||
nt|fluffy: Javier graupera opts for a normal 1NT but it is also possible to pass 1@D and let them play them (perhaps doubled) wich might bring a lot of points|pg||

nt|fluffy: and asks further|pg||

nt|bigtrain: norby has quite a reputation :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|favallu: salida muy original  de Ventin|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s9|nt|fluffy: obviously he doesn't know that partner has @d singleton instead of the more likelly @h singleton, but if he investigates the worst that can happen is that he plays 5@c|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fluffy: yeah me too, I'd definetelly do it with @dKJ942, but I probably wouldn't with @dKJ742, with @dKJ842 its the critical for me, but I would do it as well|pg||

nt|pelu: tx|pg||

pc|h3|nt|fluffy: FM means game forcing in spannish|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: a nice 6@s - but I dont exp them to bid the slam|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fluffy: so 2@c is game forcing but natural, 2@s is also forcing obviously|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@c is north's obvious bid, pinpointing @d shortness|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bigtrain: tough to get to 3NT after a superaccept|pg||
nt|fluffy: if Massana had any doubts about what to do after transfer, the 3@h bid clears them all|pg||

nt|pelu: 3-3 in both black suits = down 1 with @dK wrong|pg||

nt|pelu: what is 3@D? and why not 4@D - all Ss cards are working|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@h should go down, declarer is trying to develop some sort of endplay maybe|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|fluffy: perhaps north has a bit more to show than he did, I would had rathe bid 4@c than 3@s with his hand|pg||

nt|fluffy: at these colors I might be a coward and just bid 3@s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bigtrain: i agree|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fluffy: and since 1NT cannot be passed south has to bid something with 5332 hands, so 2@d could be jsut 3 card suit|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - I am also a chiken :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: @C-lead and @S back will defeat 2@S|pg||
nt|fluffy: the alerts on EW are actually from NS bids|pg||
nt|fluffy: but uopon seeing dummy Llluis is almost certain that NS can make slam in clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: No 15-17 and puppet on at EW|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c is gazilli|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@h is weak with 2 cards|pg||
nt|favallu: he always wins Golis....i thought he neede to cash @SA but was wrong, playing @D wins too|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c shows 16-18 HCP I think or so|pg||
nt|fluffy: and asks about strenght|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: although with @H as the suit you have to suck it up and bid 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|fluffy: yeah, it wins, but cashing @sA is better cos he was now going down iif east ha @hKJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|favallu: some kind of gazzilli ??? or similar ?|pg||
nt|favallu: truth :) @H|pg||
nt|rodal f: 8 top tricks but hard to defend. |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fluffy: yes, I agree since I learnt that you have to bid 4@s over 4@h as much as possible, I realiced you also have to bid then 4@h as much as possible to counter it :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|fluffy: some news the other table played 6NT obviously making = since nobody is macho enough to try an overtrick finese on a slam to go many downs :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: @CK????|pg||
nt|fluffy: norths 2@s is consistent with 2 hand types: 6-9 with 2 spades, or 5-7 with 3 spades, anyway it is a poor hand for game, aiming for a partscore.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s3|pc|h9|nt|pelu: 6NT not -  the best slam - with @Cs 4-1 u still winn if @DK onside|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr if it was at Es hand. Ws hand and good lead (@C)=8|pg||
nt|favallu: is down with @S lead ?|pg||
nt|fluffy: double dummy it is not down|pg||
nt|fluffy: because you can strip north I think, running @cJ early to stop south winning any trick but @cQ|pg||

nt|rodal f: Am to quick with TV at left side. Right u are and I was:)|pg||
nt|fluffy: ahh no, I am saying nonsense, on a spade lead it is very easy, you just have to take spades, and since north has @hAK you make 3@h, 5@d, 2@s|pg||

mb|3C|nt|pelu: ok slam again|pg||
nt|fluffy: this time for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|fluffy: Javier Graupera uses the Jacoby convention, where 2NT shows a hand with heart support and strenght (invitational or game forcing, depending on partnership agreements)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 4@d is a splinter bid, after a fit is stablished, jumping in another suit shows some slam interests and also shortness (singleton or void) in the suit jumped|pg||
nt|fluffy: the 3@c bid I am not sure of the meaning, it can vary from one partnership to another|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fluffy: this is probably unknown for anyone not from Bacelnoa|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: now Juan Pont identifies what keycards he is missing, he is missing only 2: @hA and @cA, if partner had both, 7@h could be made|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|fluffy: you can say it Peter, it is an awful convention lol|pg||
nt|fluffy: actually south might had tried 3NT if he know partner had a spade honnor|pg||
nt|fluffy: when oyu know an opponent is broke and the other has all HCP you don't need 25 HCP any more to bid game|pg||
nt|fluffy: because you can endplay the strong guy many times|pg||
nt|favallu: re, me vengo persiguiendo a Gonzalo :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: but here the hand fits so horribly that even 2NT will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|fluffy: lol|pg||
nt|favallu: english or spanish here ? LOL|pg||
nt|fluffy: I just have no idea, what does the audience think?|pg||
nt|fluffy: english or spannihs?|pg||
nt|fluffy: castellano o inglés?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: normally when all you are missing is aces it is time for blackwood, but the problem is the @sA, if partner has it, there is no way to know after blackwood if the ace(s) he shows ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: contain it or not, so blackwood with a void is useless|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bigtrain: it certainly limits the effective uses for stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|favallu: you choose Golis :)|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|7C|nt|fluffy: 6@h might be codified or not, I think it is not, Javier asks for aces, but Juanito knows that since he is void in spades, the answer won't tell partner how many quick tricks can ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: actually be cashed, so he rejects the question and bids the best contract he can|pg||
nt|fluffy: lets try english so Rodal F can help us|pg||

nt|fluffy: play regularilly I think|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|rodal f: Second best spot. 7 tricks. Impossible to find 2@S=|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1@S pro 2-3 @ss|pg||
nt|fluffy: these transfer bids normally allow NS to bid with more hands, since they can now double of bid 1@s, however when you have no agreements and have fear of missunderstading you ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: actually come up with less options|pg||
nt|fluffy: it seems hard to imagine a way where NS doesn't take exactly 6 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: with a passed partner playing IMPs I would also pass as south|pg||
nt|pelu: yes over 1@H: D = @Hs, 1@S = neg X|pg||
nt|fluffy: if partner wasn't a passed hand I might stretch a double, because my honnors are mostly outside diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: my best guess is that 2@c is the XYZ convention also known as 2-way checkback|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|fluffy: 2@c forces partner to bid 2@d, it might be 2 types of hands: a hand that wants to play 2@d, or any hand with 10-11 points that is gonna invite to game|pg||
nt|pelu: when your partner open in your singleton u sh not press so hard|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fluffy: 3@d shows an invitational hand with diamonds, and no interest on playing in spades, so exactly 4@s|pg||

mb|p|nt|fluffy: again forcing 1NT|pg||

mb|2N|nt|fluffy: they play 5 card diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 1@d openingis 5+ @d for NS|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of action from West on a hand where many would pass first time|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is very common in barcelona, and that might explain west's unnusual bidding|pg||
nt|fluffy: the 1@d opening means 1@c can be often be opened on 2@c, for examplo with any 4@d 2@c hand|pg||
nt|pelu: so 1@c could be a sigleton - but not after 1@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Waited that 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: so 1@c can be 2 cards often|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fluffy: surprised by the 3NT rebid, most partnerships show 18-19 balanced with 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: I hardly ever play against this system, so I am not sure how common is west's approach|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fluffy: not as much as singleton, cos 4441 opens 1@d also, but low doubleton yes|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2NT is fine, but why didn't west raise diamonds?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Had his minimum12HP but we need to ask W.|pg||
nt|fluffy: might he try to sneack a heart trick before trying clubs?|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: and - as I see - no way to 9 tricks with @Hs 4-1|pg||

nt|fluffy: its up to partnership agreements, but if yo have a shapelly hand that wants to invite to 4@s over 1NT the proper bid is 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c is the duri-fit convention showing 10-11 HCP (maximum for a passed hand) and support for partner's major|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@d is a relaty bid, and that's where I bet their agreements end|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR only 10 tricks - decl played on a non-chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|fluffy: when opponents open or overcall a strong NT, you can use the 2NT bid as a cuebid when partner shows a suit|pg||
nt|pelu: depend on system agreements - many would X first|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: I think Fernandez downgraded @hK|pg||
nt|fluffy: with his hand with no opposition the normal bid is 4@s vulnerable at IMPs|pg||
nt|rodal f: If 3@C was positive trail E had for a.....|pg||
nt|fluffy: but having @hK under the 2@h bidder is bad news normally|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fluffy: yes, but it doesn't take much imagination to construct a hand where 1NT X makes and so does 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: u can also use 2NT as minors from S|pg||
nt|fluffy: constructing a hand consisten with west passing 1NTX will be a lot tougher though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|fluffy: 3@s is in no danger, but 4@s requires to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normaly Y. Still E have to take the trail ask if it was that|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|pelu: but now NS have preblems|pg||
nt|fluffy: you can play the suits in 2 ways to score 1 trick, either low to the king, or run the @dJ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fluffy: this makes double dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: but requires verty precise timing|pg||
nt|fluffy: you have to cross ruff all the minors|pg||
nt|fluffy: and then put East in with @sK|pg||
nt|fluffy: but from the bidding is is a possible play|pg||
nt|pelu: S has shown are better hand - but N know that East has @SK so vewry agresssive to go for slam with 5@D|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes, and, what is 5@d anyway? shouldn't it be 5@c?|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer was looking for something amazing on Open room, I am too lazy today to try to igure out what|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|fluffy: anyway, note that the key for this hand is to use dummy's entrys properly|pg||
nt|fluffy: ye sit was a trial ask, east decided to go with the low road this time, wich is not normal, because he is a very agressive player|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still though. 4@S is down with a @C lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fluffy: sorry, thx netto for pointing out, obviously on a @c lead 4@s goes down if defence finds the @hA entry|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fluffy: cos then they ruff a club, and even 2 down is possible then|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fluffy: good start|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D is not in my book :)|pg||
nt|pelu: snd easy ride in OE after a @h-lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: we all know many players who after winning @dA, would draw trumps and then try @c finese, and when they later found north with @sAJ and 1 club honnor would say "I was so unlucky"|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s4|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fluffy: you ahve 2 sure entries to dummy: @dA and @hK, and oyu ahve 2 club fineses to do, so you use both entries to do club fineses|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c4|pc|s3|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|fluffy: well Norberto made a heart switch so he avoids the endplay later hehe|pg||

nt|fluffy: and the last board|pg||
nt|fluffy: fernandez guessed the @ds easilly because north had overcalled 2@h instead of preempting 3@h so he has to have 10+ HCP|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fluffy: in the other room I mean|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|pelu: 3 very expensive bords by NS in OR |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: Xavi cannot pass 2@c, not because he has 7 spades, but because he has only 1 club, and parnter might have up to 20 HCP with long clubs, awaiting for us to reopen with a double|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|fluffy: both north and south have stretched to bid 4@h, and its no surpise that they go down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fluffy: ouch East makes an agressive double|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fluffy: good for him|pg||
nt|pelu: very few swings in this half - and no expensive misunderstandings by EW - but some defensive problems|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|fluffy: whenever the auction prceeds 1x open-2y overcall-pass-pass you should try to reopen the hand with a doubl whenever its possiblem adn never pass with a singleton on their suit, nor ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: with a low doubleton I'd say|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes 4@s was a good decision|pg||
nt|fluffy: I can't blame NS for playing 5@c|pg||
nt|fluffy: -1100 looks by a lot I didn't analyce the play, maybe 800 were possible but still a disaster|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|fluffy: and last board|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@C is a gamble - "all inn" on a mediuym hand :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I know I would also bid 5@c hehe|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure I will open 4@S against you :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fluffy: but it depends on your opponents I guess, my normal opponents when they open 4@s they have an 8 card suit with few values, not 3 defensive tricks hehe|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: @S3 = for me values in C|pg||
