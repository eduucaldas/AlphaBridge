nt|sunsamvar: best game... well bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Wow, opposite a 2@C opening, north saw no need to get his long, potentially trick-taking suit into the auction.  Well bid on this hand, perhaps missing @D slam on others|pg||

nt|othered1: Actually, 4th suit forcing might have gotten into EW's way in the OR, a more common event than its fans are willing to admit|pg||
nt|sybarra: but at some point,  do you begin to worry about the deals being off kilter?|pg||
nt|othered1: North doesn't really h ave an attractive lead.  Whatever avoids giving up a trick is likely best .. . |pg||
