mb|3D!|nt|hawe45:  - ah, I didÂ´nt see the 9 of @H, important card |pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Do we know NS's system?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway - a tuff start|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW belong in 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: as i play 4@D has to be ace (not king or singleton)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the Hacketts are father Paul and son Justin two fine English players|pg||
nt|caitlin: missing cold 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: 3NT available for EW here   but not easy to get there|pg||
nt|bobh1: apparently the second double is takeout|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a fair treatement if West's 1st pass doesn't show values|pg||
nt|sharkey: this appears to be a coffee hand - 11 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone guess what 3D is|pg||

nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: If something lilke Precision, there would be questions about relative minor suit length, v what a double would show, etc.|pg||

nt|sharkey: hi Nigel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D probably something bout minors????|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: it may have asked about clubs and 5@D denied|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'b be happy ot pass 2@H as East; I've done enough, IMO, with a 4441|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but its so prime|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm not unsympathetic to the raise; but I expect West to be aggressive with say, 5 trumps & a black K|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and bid 3@H over the X|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sunil|pg||

pc|c6|nt|sybarra: Mike you with us also?|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by both pairs -- for a moment i thought somebody would overbid here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not sure about overbidding as just about everything comes rolling home.|pg||
nt|othered1: After the "opening bid," EW weren't going to find the hopeless slam|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or maybe just clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: neatly done -- from N's perspective slam is on a finesse at worst|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: if u like|pg||
nt|xenya: true Jordan |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|othered1: declarer, in only 2@S here, doesn't have to look for miracle lies as he might if in game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  this makes task easy|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: the wrong board featured a possible slam, barring a spade lead -- here is another of the same kind -- 6@D is on on a non-heart lead |pg||

nt|jtr: No double of 3@h|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Or redouble of 2@H which some play as showing a high honour|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still, declarer may be thinking if it loses to the king and the diamond finesse is wrong.....|pg||
nt|jtr: That against the @s finesse|pg||

nt|lestergold: I see legendary Subndelin at East who is great contribui=|pg||
nt|lestergold: on bbo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: If South opens 1@D -- that means they're playing Precision|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be a push board|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it earned an imp|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this so close they all count|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: prediction 2-NS will get too high|pg||
nt|sybarra: but we will be the slow table |pg||
nt|xenya: but not on best defence. mind you|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good slam - will they reach it?|pg||
mb|1C|an|2+|mb|2H|nt|othered1: What's east's 1@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: From south's 2@C bid, I might infer it's a big @C|pg||
nt|bg: not sure but is normal start for a 2nnt rebid|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW will make a game try...bid 3N and try to make it|pg||
nt|othered1: west apparantly denies 5@S if he passes over 1@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: regardless of strength?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3NT is the spot for E/W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Precision it is|pg||
mb|d|nt|odysseus69: 1C either clubs or weak NT|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: might even land in wrong suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I can tell you the McGann in the OR is indeed in 3N and looks like making so it could be 1st blood to Hackett|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html  for standings and Daily Bulletins (scroll down in the column to the left)|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may invite with 4 NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wellthey should but its a minor|pg||
nt|rmb1: What can South do: double?|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: and cant really fail a cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 6@D ? asks a kibitzer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - on this board?...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|saverio: NS could take 11 tricks in 5@d here     another "not easy to find" game  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd prefer 2@C over the X|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 8 easy tricks is a good start; usuallythe defence will provide one along the way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N may seem strong on HCP - but doubleton @H isn't carrying full weight -- and even so 11 opposite Precision 11-15  opening doesn't want to get too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: takeout DBL from South should let North compete in @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Justin Hackett opened the South hand with 1@S   -- EW never in the auction so 2@S South|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe 3NT now shows minors with long clubs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: double probably shows clubs and diamonds too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H from North now?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: i hope 2N is a scramble|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: 6@d should be off on a @s lead  even if it is a though lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Communications are not very good especially if defenders lead clubs, but 9 tricks shouldn't be a problem|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In their precision style that would be an overbid|pg||
nt|rmb1: on the basis the 3@S shows spades :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|othered1: NS will h ave another chance to take 7 top tricks.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: whew|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: it was 16+|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like a normal big @C auction, with 2@S showing a limited positive response.|pg||
nt|othered1: ty operator|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in the other room West raised to 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N made on 1 for 6 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Previous match was decided on a misunderstanding of a 4 NT bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Played 4 NT down 2 instead of 6@S making...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think 4NT is too much with no fit and East showing no encouragement|pg||
nt|odysseus69: betting he will bid slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hope so|pg||
nt|jcomyn: D the worry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South has shown extras - cant have much less than he has|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @D loses @S wins Q@C dies|pg||
mb|6C|nt|sybarra: goofy little hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: after A@c could be interesting if PO tries to sneak a spade he may may make|pg||
nt|othered1: in the OR, it was east who thought his hand worth initial action and opened 1@C, cheating his partner out of the chance to be first to bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i might be tempted to do so too.|pg||
nt|xenya: makes sense, considering the vulnerability |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with the west hand... 7 points in partners preemt might not produce a single trick|pg||
nt|xenya: putting maximum pressure on NS|pg||
nt|odysseus69: always right to make these decisions slowly|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: same result in other room on board 1|pg||
nt|othered1: the overcall does give west some useful information|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you prepared to bid 7 if opponents reach slam, because that often happens with these extreme preempts|pg||
nt|xenya: spades behave, in a sense, so declarer can get out for -1|pg||
nt|saverio: do you agree on S 3NT?    |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html   for Daily Bulletins (scroll down in the column to the left)|pg||
nt|bobh1: @c lead gives a trick|pg||
nt|othered1: first of EW, that it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: Those bulletins are astounding, the eds/authors do a fantastic job|pg||
nt|lestergold: question of overtricks now|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely no tank here must be odds to play J or T @c|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well if they play 4NT and South leads a spade it is easy enough to score ten tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: IN OR, I guess west couldn't imagine a hand with no key cards.  Those who require a modicum of quality in the suits they open 2@C won't face that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: maybe was thinking of 7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done |pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcwla: Will lead @DQ to preserve the opportunity to play S out of @D KT7.  Or won't.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is South has as little as @DKxxx then slam is on likely-to-be-wrong @DA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: matched other room same spot|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nothing really to the play is there?  Try both finesses and find that one works|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Barry Rigal suggests that he might run this - should have led the king? - not that it matters as cards lie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unlikely I'd think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely \w hasd not bid with J to 6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: consensus is to run the heart and he will|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
pc|h7|nt|saverio: wd by N to move from 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scramble [2 places to play]  lets South choose the correct minor   imagine South holding 4@D & 3@C|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: indeed the stiff A@H didn't look that great|pg||
nt|tejjyid: T1 tank is OK for planning - but tankins at T@@ as well is a bit rough|pg||
nt|tejjyid: T2|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's trying to decide which red suit S has|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @D suit coming home with no finesse, this will be easy|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|xenya: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|othered1: eventually, declarer will get  his 9th trick in @H for a dull result.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  MY partner(s) doÂ´nt open 3 @C|pg||
nt|saverio: i think i'd pass 3NT as N   (i'd expect something like AQ for that bid)|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: another Precision 1@D  probably 2+@D, maybe 1+|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: thats a spec count Ed true hard to know at atble|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: these weak 2 suiters do crowd the auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 1 @H = spades?|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Andrew!|pg||
nt|sybarra: game likely to be bid at both tables actually|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like even 3@h overboard|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW can make 1 or 2 NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: PO going to the new fangled stuff?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 12+10 = 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: The longer north keeps this off of a quantitative NT track, the better for NS.|pg||
nt|othered1: it's possible north has no *descriptive* forcing bid at this point|pg||
nt|super nova: I prefer 5@c by Ohno|pg||
nt|super nova: Since it says I also have @D support|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1:30 in writing also|pg||
nt|lestergold: a doomed 4@s for a push here|pg||

nt|tejjyid: North going very slowly|pg||
nt|lestergold: how old is PO he was world famous when i was a teenager|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  N/S should be reluctant to sell out to 2@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  low @s probably best here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bg: Taipei + 620 in other room|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Papa was there|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good strain for EW as shud make|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud S act over 2@D?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would have doubled with South at the end|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@C looks fearless to me, even with the @D fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  Simon rule:  against NT if you have a 5 card suit and 4 card suit, lead the 4 card suit|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be a success|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't hate 2@C rebid, but I think it would be nice to have methods that didn't require me to balckwood on north hand, though maybe it will work out.  7th @C, as yet unbid, is key ...|pg||
nt|othered1: and north can't count it.|pg||
nt|bg: the seventh club is the elusive trick not to mention dia Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi all sorry I am late|pg||

nt|lestergold: sorry i used to be a teahcer its just habit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mike is telling you to comment on the Go stand, in the corner|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth has shown an appreciation of the "soft" nature of his 16 count, but 'm not sure whathe can do about it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mirrored shapes and marginal game values dont mix well|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if he bids it will west lead his fourth best from hismlongest and strongest the only lead to give 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that was a few decades ago|pg||
nt|lestergold: like 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@c probably bid to direct lead |pg||
nt|othered1: might have dissuaded west to only make a game try|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well timed, becasue nothing in the auction said the @C layout was like this|pg||
nt|othered1: but it is a vul game and you don't need to be bonded to try it (if the opponents don't look like the doubling kind)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if West has AQT, he would be greatly encouragesd on minimum values|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 8 yops|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tops|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hawe45:  Another good move from Hac-Hac|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@C has good chances |pg||
nt|othered1: nice place to stop on NS cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: true but here we need to give credit to 2@h opening|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, 4@D is a surprise|pg||
nt|lestergold: only in bidding comp migt gamke not be bid here|pg||
nt|sybarra: so likely to hear 1 nt  and we did|pg||
nt|odysseus69: needs heart lead to beat very lucky 3NT-or club lead and heart switch|pg||
nt|rmb1: "where there's eight there's nine" says those in 3NT-1|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice Robin|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Bulgaria are 2nd and Hackett are 6th at this time|pg||
nt|sharkey: Carch all x - i have "something"?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is 2-way Checkback    2@D forced  2@S=5@S invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: That's an effort you'd see in many duplicate clubs.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S may scramble to 6 tricks..I don't see a 7th if the defense is careful|pg||
nt|jcomyn: safety first|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NT by S guarantees @H lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right spot|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this may make|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: the auction in the other room was completely different -- S chose to preempt in 1st seat|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@S is essentially on a heart finesse|pg||
nt|jcwla: I am not convinced by this.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rule of 11 tells W the whole story.|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, NS were lucky to remain oblivious of their spade fit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|saverio: not easy to get to slam after 2@h/3@c/4@h...  a lot of space wasted and no more room to investigate|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OH, thy're certainly getting to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 4@d is systematic|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the double by W makes S hand worse, and NS not vul. but most wiould bid game even if appreciating the negative factors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S=too high|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess, comparer to what they might open on, south has a maximum . . . |pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: *Catch|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  When you have heart tolerance and clubs and nothing much in their suit, it will usually be best to compete I think|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It is much harder for North even with quite a good hand unless they have extra shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  and this may be the 7th|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess, that's why it took so long to find.  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: 6 LTC + 8.5 LTC means larginal for game even apart from the mirror|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South *might* have passed 2@S NV< but once not, no way to stop|pg||
nt|bobh1: actually no way to misdefend|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is a difficult double dummy problem i ndeed to imagine a scenario where EW could let it make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well North was very max for his 2@s and south was sub min for 2N|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If they routinely make single raises with 16 HCP, South is pretty much compelled to try will 9+|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all. Sry am a bit late|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Sunil.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if South was allowed to rebid 2@S instead of 1N|pg||
nt|caitlin: lose 1@S 3@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobh1: E is thinking hard about finding one|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Sunil|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobh1: a good effort|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt that would change the final contract -- just wondering|pg||
nt|andyv:  continued @s leads was indicated|pg||
nt|xenya: E would have done better to put up the @DQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: a smelly lead not a good idea to finesse|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sunsamvar: Hi Jordan &Vladimir|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: In this case they wud likely end up in 2@H|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|blum1956:  still only 6 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H may have been intended to push opponents to a phantom, but west did not get the plot, a lot to be said for bidding 2s with east hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: still -1|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: 5@H looks very dubious, with all those losers in the minors |pg||
pc|h5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: PO seems to be anxious to hide his only asset|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobh1: but insufficient|pg||
nt|othered1: I find few Precision players would raise on south's xxx support.  I might, but I don't play Precision.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: What about 2@S over 2@C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not playing 2-way Checkback   2@C could be hand that wants to play 2@D  or  invite with 5@S 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: if you're not playing 2-way checkback, why isn't 2@D weak with @D, as in standard?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some do say that you can ignore the force to 2@D with MAX and  3@S  when unwilling to hear partner PASS 2@D|pg||

nt|bobh1: i wonder if he can make 1@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Precision 2@C by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's been a long time since i've played anything but 2-way checkback|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but priority is still needed after 2-way's 2@D game forcing checkback|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't play 2-way checkback. In one-way checkback, I play whatever my partner wants, usually 3-card support, 4 in other major, or @H . . . |pg||
nt|andyv:  fyi:  the semi finals are 32 boards... the finals 64|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  Difficult now - how find 5 @D|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone X as N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the auction has died in a mere 3@H OR so a plus for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|bobh1: there's really no reason for S to bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hard for me to get too fond of any auction that ends in _200 againbst a doubled partial at IMPs|pg||
nt|othered1: choose your own priority76 for your partnership|pg||
nt|nickf: and of course there was the father of JT in between|pg||

mb|p|nt|chilloncan: i agree S shoiuld pass, but they so seldom fo|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Passing 1@H as West seems pretty conservative|pg||
nt|xenya: i would pass as N|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I would prefer to open 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strictly a matter for partnership    a) priority to 3 card fit   b) priority to show @H [4 if responder bid @S, 3 if responder bid @H]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was Semi-Force   6-12 HCP|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N may be any solid suit but looks a little rich to be gambling with !k and !q|pg||

nt|xenya: they did in the other room, but... |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this is pushing it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice jump overcall in the balancing position by Zhan|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S in last seat tends to show a decent hand -- just what S has|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the other option of dbling and then bidding @Ss will show more points and defence|pg||
nt|othered1: has anyone really proven out the value of semiforcing 1N responses at IMPs?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharkey: Lots of work to do|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|xenya: what's your prediction on this one, Martin?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I the good old days, North had "taken the money against 2 @C D!"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only see two losers in 5 @D? But how many tricks...|pg||
nt|saverio: after the 2@h opening in the earlier board we can understand why N opened 1@h here     though it is not my style since i prefer sounds openings and overcalls....:)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont really agree with the double by W, but the position is a very awkward one|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I have never played Precision where 2@c can have a major|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In a way both sides are endplayed|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: 1 off guaranteed club guess needed to avoid 2 light|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I used to play cheapest NT was a void based T/O|pg||
nt|sybarra: some sort of drury by N |pg||
nt|tejjyid: and on that lead, it won't be too hard|pg||
nt|othered1: west's pass, compared to an earlier board, must mean he looks at the vulnerability before bidding|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: and I guess east is making a game try|pg||
nt|xenya: tough hand for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is down after 2 rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if South has soft values in the majors 3 nt may be right.. but i guess he will bid 5@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I worked oncein real life, and this appears to be the 2nd time|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
nt|caitlin: miss 6@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: proven?   i'm sure proponents of absolute force and semi force have absolutely proven that their position is correct and the other is wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i think they're both right|pg||
nt|othered1: south pretty much took control and north was just along for the ride, to my eyes.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: well N knows all the spades on his left |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and the @Da ofcourse|pg||

nt|sharkey: 1st endplay|pg||
nt|sharkey: sxry 2nd|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: East never bid in the other room -- smoother auction for Hackett's to get to the same 5@C|pg||
nt|othered1: If south overtakes and returns @S, will n orth know the relative count?|pg||
nt|xenya: Justin is not amused |pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: as ugly as this looks shoudl be able to scramble 7 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: same as in open|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kiwibridge: oh dea @S pitches|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the -500 cost 12 imps|pg||
nt|saverio: if def wont play 1 round of trump i think 5@d can be made    so they need E to win @h and shift to @d    which is not easy at all|pg||

nt|othered1: what would south have tried from J9x?|pg||

nt|blum1956:  800 ready, and declarer needs to be careful to avoid 1100|pg||

pc|cA|nt|xenya: this will speed up the play|pg||

nt|xenya: good point, Sunil|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx Roland|pg||
nt|chessmaste: It was awkward for West |pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C opening pushed NS into a difficult contract - playing standard may end up at 1 NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: pass from N|pg||
nt|super nova: How about this for a 3@c preempt Vul. ;-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West has 4 loser hand -- bidding only once is way too timid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: good passs by N doesnt fit too many systems for an opening|pg||
nt|super nova: ah.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Aggressive weak jump to 2@s at the other table|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Which led to North playing 3@d|pg||
nt|sharkey: Could be expensive for NS|pg||
mb|2C|an|GF|nt|ahollan1: another Precision 1@D|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd bid on west's hand, but would be much happier doing so if partner had shown some values|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: one often thinks,  why does pard do that??|pg||
mb|2S!|an|6+H|nt|kiwibridge: the big flat use a lot of space nt|pg||
nt|othered1: south, perhaps feeling too good for a 1N overcall (if available naturally), tried a simple 1@D and gets a bid out of partner.  Now what?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: interesting 4C before 5D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: sry it was 2 clubs x by E down 1 -100|pg||
nt|othered1: so far very normal.  Now north's hand says do something @H focused, like raise or support double|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H looks like good hand, bad suit, which is apt.|pg||
nt|othered1: 24 HCP, vul, an OK 5-card suit, game figures to be bid today.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this looks like 3NT scraping home|pg||
mb|2N!|an|ask|nt|saverio: puppet action here    |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@D = a 4 card but no 5 card major|pg||
nt|sharkey: Put the pressure on W - 4@H x likely off 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: N likely hitting the deck quickly here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or not?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: good bid by E, but this should end it|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Bidding over a strong club works at lot of the time|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
nt|othered1: But north has extras, maybe too many|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they handle the clubs?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth maybe a little conservative opposite a 3rd hand opening|pg||
mb|3D!|an|3622|nt|nigel_k:  5@c may have been easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant fail to make as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north's 1N an underbid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I would upgrae my "well-positioned" @S honours and try 2NT as a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: any one for neg X |pg||
nt|lestergold: especially as  apassed hand and indeed qorth an upgrade in any case with the spade overall|pg||
nt|sybarra: or does that double mean something else to them?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'sd prefer a negative double, if available, then 2N giving partner a bunch of choices|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so was W bid a psyche? or systemic|pg||
nt|tejjyid: -ve X seems reasonable as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly cannot blame south who has no move opposite 1N|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2N by S?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: stewards inquiry|pg||
nt|lestergold: er i dont think so Ellen|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no clear way of making 4 hearts or for defence to let it home|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not 2@C transfer or anything |pg||
mb|3H!|an|point ask|nt|chilloncan: wow. apparently 2N was forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a simple & descriptive bid...|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and now W could bid 3N -- i'm surprised he didn't|pg||
nt|jcwla: Considering this suit leaves a lot to be desired, W should feel comfortable in thinking JT shores it up nicely when in fact it's little better than 32.|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: but the seems not to have a bid showing both M so they could have wronsided the contract if they happened to have @h and not @s fit....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well said Jordan|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still down in 5@C|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes because of the overruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has wrong cards for slam... they will end up in 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't know Andy -- suppose N did have 5 diamonds?|pg||
mb|3S!|an|12-14|nt|xenya: the 4@S bid is routine -- E doesn't need much from partner for game to be good |pg||
nt|chilloncan: looks good for W|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did they make 4 @S?  not sure I see enough tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see,  @H lead and hopped ace|pg||
nt|chilloncan: club ruffs out third, and they may have led D ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely only lose 1 trick in each side suit|pg||
nt|othered1: That doesn't come up all that often on defensive bidding, and I might think it showed a different hand with longer, better @D and a bit less outside.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This will be worse|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree you mean by N?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: fishing foir 3nt doubtless|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: many players do not like to doubles with voids and a weakness in defensive cards  probably best here just to overcall 1 heart|pg||
nt|saverio: wrongsided*|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it probably gets bid with your hand type more often - 19-20 balanced usually goes through a X|pg||
mb|4D!|an|to 4H|mb|p|nt|sharkey: @S spots certainly coming into play here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: starting with RDBL seems odd to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i suspect many Big Clubber's would open 1@S in 1st seat|pg||
nt|andyv:  he might have bid it over 3N (since his diamonds would be very good)...sometimes you just have to accept that the opps have you beat|pg||
nt|blum1956:  quick 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: Perhaps 2@C is GF clubs or balanced and he is treating this as balanced??|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: not sure I'd have responded to 1@d at all with the North cards, let alone responded 1@h. But Kokish is very big in Japan, so that a 1@d overcall has a range of about 9 to about 29|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1:  a little wild and wooly, but I'll take defending 4@S on these hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: with 2 sure trump losers Tanaka has the choice of the @S or @D fin|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Other semifinal after the first half: Hackett +15 against NED-UK|pg||
nt|odysseus69: obvious spot but not the AA route|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was relay |pg||
nt|rmb1: instead stopped to pick daisies|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||
nt|saverio: over 3@d it is a normal agreement to play 4@c both M with slam interest and 4@d w/out.....|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like off 3|pg||
nt|caitlin: what is aler on 1@D?|pg||
nt|caitlin: alert|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Precision|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kiwibridge: Korbachev has made his 5@D another 12 imp blow|pg||
nt|sharkey: at least|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: well hopefully there is a real explanation, I am getting several from kibs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tejjyid: reasonable to raise to 2@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good @D shift by Zhan forcing declarer to take the choice now..|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: South had a tough choice at trick 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  in any case, if the dbl of 4@d was a suit, then Paul was wrong, if it was lead directional, then Justin was wrong|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, how will he make it?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can't imagine introuding the @H suit though|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One heart and five trumps|pg||
nt|othered1: best lead, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told many use RDBL to show 4+@S  then North's sequence makes more sense|pg||
nt|othered1: if west goes up, the hand is over|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: eventually, the auction will let declarer get the @D position right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: oops|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: also, the defence may go wrong...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec points out that Tanaka shd have pld a @S to the 10 on the second trick... true i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room    over DBL Paul Hacket made a fit-showing bid of 2@S     they're also in 3@D|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess that with this vile layout (diamonds 4-1, all the hearts wrong) he won't|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep that reaslly is an oops|pg||
nt|rmb1: In case that wasn't clear: 2@C was any GF relay (2@D would be a heart raise)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  But taking the @C Ace behind tha strong hand looks strange|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: cant blame him... how to know that P has both @Dk and 10|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: same bidding in the other room |pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rmb1: South just really wanted to know if North had extras but had to find out about shape first.  As soon as he knew North was min he signed off.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|caitlin: don't see 2N when 1@D says nada about @Ds and N's @DK could be useless|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: well, almost - South took it upon himself to bid game|pg||
nt|othered1: and same result, I'll assume|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer is home|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcwla: Eh, la, la.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: north did open and south has shown up with @H A and Q, but west misread it.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West was worried about diamonds- he should have followed a good general principal - when declarer plays low drom Ax in dummy it is most often  right to return tha suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I used to play symmetric, some time you just have to go through the motions|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@D was the "end signal".  Often this can be used to mean bid 4@H and I will bid the (game) contract to play|pg||

nt|jcwla: This collection of quacks is not my idea of an opening bid.  The @S bid and rebid are both unilateral shoot-the-moon moves, particularly if 2@D is known to show three.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anyway they did well to stop because it looks like 3NT is down on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A trap pass - not a good idea in my opinion|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4Sx likely spot in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: they got to 6 @D in the other room making|pg||
nt|pelu: I have just cheked the scores: 15-17 now|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@H is a really interesting bid, which I guess they play forcing.  South still backs off with what looks like a minimum.|pg||
nt|othered1: is north still thinking?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Daily Bulletins are also to be found at   http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html  then scroll down left to Bulletins|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks like the Hacketts now play strong NT|pg||
nt|saverio: they play puppet over 1NT also or i cant understand the 2@c bid by N|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now, @H Q|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like they play 2-way Stayman (a good method, especially over weak NT)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n safer of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unclear what the bids meant after 1@S   --   i can think of a number of treatments that fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  South might have a 5-card major|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for me i mean|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s relay to 3N (3N by W would have been 5 @ss|pg||
nt|xenya: yet another routine game |pg||
nt|rmb1: Some double on all hands with 4+ @S (effectively as a transfer to 1@S), others play 1@s shows 5+ @S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another pleasant break and butchery breaks out|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: thankfully our operator is getting info from the players !!|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, 50 years ago it would have gone 2N-3N...shows you how bidding has improved:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|saverio: need to duck @s here (and hope for a no @h switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: sas so often the case at these colours non vul opps believe you when you bid vulnerable|pg||
nt|chilloncan: double more attractive if you had a hand where you thought 5C or 4S was likely to make. but N has too much defense to accommodate a possible club save|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: now what?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4N would have been a very descriptive bid, if quantitative.  Not sure what 5@H would mean in that context.  Perhaps a choice of game, perhaps responding to blackwood, which some do ...|pg||
nt|othered1: if continuing over a quantitative 4N.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont think 3 NT was an option|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2 way is 2@C non forcing and 2@D forcing Stayman|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe safer but looks like this will survive too|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes the clubs will take care of the losing spade|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|andyv:  the question is:  was W looking for slam (if E had a 5 card @h suit) or for a 4-4 @h game? |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sunsamvar: i wd have preferred a 2@C overcall instead of 1@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless the spade is led..which it may have been|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bg: sb 11 imps to Neduk making score 15-28|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 5H totally undisciplined|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I saw a similar themed bidding problem yesterday... South needs a widr range of bids to help NOrth decidewhat to do over 4@S |pg||
nt|sybarra: unlikely to get @D right imo|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 5@H is wild, given the lack of shape/playing strength|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N should double 4@S....pass is my second choice|pg||
nt|dburn: what good would that do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: with nothing to go on east playing partner with marked high cards tries for the ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: modern players play 1@S is less than 4 in Australia|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: these teams are ranked  1 (Neduk) and  2  ;Taipei W |pg||
nt|othered1: south really hasn't had much of a chance to do something with that hand.  North will be very pleased to find the good @S tricks that never got into the auction directly.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: subtle not!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: what harm?|pg||
nt|dburn: only to P-O's reputation|pg||
nt|tejjyid: his reputation is what makes it worthwhile|pg||
nt|dburn: I see what you mean - it could gain a trick, if North were familiar with Grosvenor Gambits|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|othered1: This will be a swing againstthe 450 in the OR|pg||
nt|bg: with a spade lead it would create minor transportation problems if Wreturns a dia after winning a club lead to q|pg||
nt|bg: oops all over now n not likely to try fancy backward heart finesse|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I see no other chance for an extra trick than an error by declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: better late than never...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: easy game, as cards lie.  but north is trying to figure out how to avoid @C loser on the lead.  Playing east for J.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3S by S could not have been a slam try and almost surely not a probe for 3N. so that means it was simply establishing ownership of the hand, to set up a forcing pas situation. N ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: has absolutely zero reason to bid 5H. his offense to defense ratio is about as low as it coul be|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes like 1C-(P)-1S playing transfer responses to 1C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: declarer has a pretty good idea about the distribution- the problem is damage limitation|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: yes south has shown a raise with high cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: think tonight I should go to casino |pg||
nt|jcwla: Middle @D8 showing no particular interest in either round suit.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now only chance is that West has ruffed from a trump holding on j10x|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  @H-switch would have killed 3 NT|pg||
nt|saverio: y|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|xenya: i'm wondering about E's opening though -- did he upgrade by 2 points?|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on what type of NT they are playing|pg||
nt|blum1956:  good controls and 5-card suit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  if 14-16, he upgraded by one for the 5 card @c suit|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bg: or A from south|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting that they were down in the OR played by the "safer" south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see it failed in open andn it was played by south |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec tells me that it shouldnt have failed|pg||
nt|lestergold: says it was misplayed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
nt|pelu: prob @DK from dummy - not @D7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c3|nt|othered1: There's nothing too tricky about this suit, especially when west follows with the 10|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he should have ducked a @C also|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bg: that doesnt look right|pg||
nt|jcwla: At least there is some logic to the 1@D opening - desperation for lead which has paid off - though I still wouldn't go there red.  Zhan is just on a flight of fancy and will pay ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: with a deeper deficit.|pg||
nt|sybarra: take a look at play,  seems to me it should have made|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|saverio: there is something to be said about 4th leads vs 3NT  i'm not a fun as i think attitude is much more useful    had W lead an high @s (denying a good suit) much more easy for E to ...|pg||
nt|saverio: find the killing shift|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bg: N should say Zhang you very much for lead:)|pg||
nt|othered1: @D lead is the same|pg||
nt|othered1: If you put the @DA with west, you can play either for the J|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - the flashy line is to play West for @dAJx|pg||
nt|tejjyid: The "good @S raise" needs the @D A|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S establishes ownership, but it doesn'tspeak to offence/defense potential. Ideally you would have "ownership" bids for each|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: but it isn't the percentage line|pg||
pc|d9|nt|caitlin: lost 2@C  2@S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|othered1: why take a finesse when you can endplay someone?|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer has to time it right, n ot incredibly difficult, but there's room for error|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|othered1: he pretty much knows that west doesn't have a doubleton @D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: well, diamonds are "known" to be 3-3 and West is "known" to have the ace|pg||
nt|othered1: this feels like a dangerous line.|pg||

nt|lestergold: was making|pg||
nt|tejjyid: those "air" quotes are very useful|pg||
nt|dburn: at least, so declarer thought, and right he was|pg||
nt|chessmaste: On the previous deal there was a case for South to double 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: original precision would bid 2@H/3@H    but in these days of 2/1 Game Force  it's 1N|pg||

nt|chilloncan: yes 5H was on a par with bidding 7D|pg||
nt|sybarra: W checking cards to see if same deck with transfer to clubs |pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door declarer won spade ace at trick 1 and played on clubs - Bulgarian declarer did better by ducking at trick 1|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|bobh1: 3@D very conservative|pg||
nt|bobh1: i don't think its forcing|pg||

nt|andyv:  then what was purpose of 2@d bid by Paul?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: me, too|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe - how many diamonds did 1@d show?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm thinking as amany as 2@H...|pg||

pc|sA|nt|chessmaste: Which is what happened at the other table|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has a clear cut @H lead so this shud be down fast|pg||
nt|rodal f: Got told a lot by that lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: not so easy after @CQ to K - endplay on @S9 in OR to give yhe 9. triock on @HK|pg||
nt|bg: a club lead will make this hand touchy to play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might get home by leading low heart towards jack (with a good guess)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but, even if only 3, I'd still try for 2@D. Opposite precision, OK, no, I wouldn't|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, so you might bid 2@s the second time - that ought to be 4-4 in the red suits, maybe|pg||
nt|othered1: How can you beat the hand if you don't do something like that to lead declarer away from the normal, winning line?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it is a matter of style and I'm sure they know each other's much better than we do|pg||
nt|xenya: and 8 tricks seems to be the limit?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: but 4-1 in diamonds...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes and suit blocked so added problem|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|chilloncan: very instructiuve hand....if S thought his hand merited 3H, why not right away?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3@s fortuantely is not conservative altho west only has 10 high card points the playing potential of his hand is enormous with @d fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: it ws a very imaginative defence and induced declarer to go wrong|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|othered1: Kept NS, with the majority of CHP out of the auction, but missed their own good game.  Fair trade?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W has a great hand after 3D|pg||

nt|bobh1: yes W bid a lot with his ten count|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: not easy to do from qx|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if that's the treatment, then X followed by 2@S is OK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: HCP rather|pg||
nt|bg: bergen users would love this hand W not likely to pass under 4 spades if he knows pard has 4|pg||

nt|tejjyid: of course, you have to bid it first|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: OUCH 15 to Heng Sha on 23|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 22, that levels it up|pg||
nt|rmb1: Open room avoid 4@SX on  22 by defending 4@HX-3 for more 800s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: at love all there is less % in pushing opponents around when you know everything is breaking |pg||
pc|d2|nt|blum1956:  extremely conservative 2@s by Bakshi - and this helps his side to stop off the game|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: a sort of pass/correct|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = multi|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a Challenge the Champs hand, where you want to get to very good 3N, as in OR|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bg: I have been following most scores I will not be far off:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Slightly strange 2NT by South and it certainly hasn't worked well|pg||
nt|tejjyid: The open room EW on fire at the moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ed -- would you use Stayman with North hand?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: Of course, NS have to get @C on the table before they get discarded|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: me neither -- flimsy suit, 6-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: entries to the north hand will kill this contract|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lack of entries ie|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: 3@S maded in OR - some work for decl|pg||
nt|othered1: no, but I'd raise.  But my NT overcalls are very sound.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I confess I would have risked the @C A as East |pg||
nt|othered1: I guess south seems something attractive about leading their suit, not the unbid . .. |pg||
nt|othered1: I guess south was looking to find @D signleton in north's hand for a ruff.  Imaginative but possible|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sunsamvar: @D now|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks pretty hopeless|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not attractive to play for 3-1 spades since it wont be possible to take heart finesse |pg||
nt|odysseus69: possible now so could go wrong|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thinking can be dangerous|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|othered1: he'll shortly claim 6 and 5 imps, noting that he could have been held with @H lead, possible on other auctions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh   i would have passed without hesitation|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: If there ever was a flat board this may be it|pg||
nt|rmb1: ruffing @D finesse for +1 :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sunsamvar: Zhan ensuring that the @H suit does not get blockd|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  could have gotten 4@s tricks by ducking the 8@s|pg||
nt|blum1956:  I guess 4 of 5 would have opend one spade with West's hand |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pins it all on @H hook for just making?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  N has not guessed well this hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: south isn't a 1N overcall to me.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DKQ dubious, non-vul   even opposite 16-18 overcall i think i'd pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well there is that too :)|pg||
nt|othered1: (quietly) mine are 16+ to 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Edgar Kaplan would be proud of you Ed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: with K of @D it got a lot easier |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Very lucky for E/W |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's difficult for South because a raise to 3@d can have a very wide range |pg||
nt|odysseus69: no need for heart hook with 2 discards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N kind of fixed|pg||
nt|rmb1: Will declare run a small @D from N?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not kind of - screwed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: d king marked|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: may keep this to down 1 as N will be endplayed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Justin Hackett used DBL instead of 1N|pg||
nt|othered1: That's pretty much where I picked it up -- and it's served me well|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess North is marker with both red suit honours|pg||
mc|10|nt|sunsamvar: he will try the @D fin for an outside chance to make i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: but more likely to find losers disappeaing as they have|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean @ds rebid and not supported what shance for ruff?|pg||

nt|sharkey: 10xxx i9n @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: 10xxx|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Though the hand looks like a normal raise to 3@d, that could be made with a weaker hand|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If K is for count, I would have led the queen instead from West|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffe hand for a change|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hackett picked up another 9 for 4@H making [our 1N +240]  that's 28-0 for the set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strong 1@C  then what from Hanlon?|pg||
nt|othered1: there are 8 boards left (9 comparisons) but Beijing Trienergy better pick up some steam soon|pg||
nt|othered1: 4 is too many at these colors, especially with some defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: conventionally  EW play  (1@C)-DBL = @H|pg||
nt|othered1: That suit is more like @H!!, not merely @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed Ed|pg||
mb|1D|nt|othered1: at what levels does he have natural @H bids (or transfers)?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their jump bids are 3-way   a) weak in that suit  b) weak in next higher suit  c) 3-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: off we go|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5/5 majors for dealer pass|pg||
nt|dburn: what should South do?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@H|pg||
nt|othered1: pass and maybe jump in @H later|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hackett would be ok if this were a BAM|pg||
nt|xenya: some might open 1@S as W on the previous hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  Coffee board|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: E a 1@C0 16 + stron any hand |pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: is this a funky flannery? or ??|pg||
nt|bg: aggressive start not recommended unless you have plenty of time for discuusions|pg||
nt|sybarra: other option is majors,  less than opening  |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: agresive 3@D block Nvul fron S|pg||
nt|chilloncan: scoreboard insufficiently blood-flecked|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the @C holding is insurance|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h will work, but I don't understand it at all|pg||
nt|dburn: if it isn't forcing, then I almost understand it, but...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: King may have asked for unblock|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vul   how weak can 3@H really be?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can s prevent w fromn showing majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|tejjyid: stuck because I don't want to pass out 2@S X'ed, or bid 4@H over the top of it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Opportunity for Shenzhen here|pg||

nt|lestergold: east passing a perfectly respectable 12 count?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: 6 clubs reached in other room|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: that reminds me...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The wrong 4|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3nt E end contract|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E seems to have passed a hand vastly better than the one he opened a minute ago, and vul both times|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: South must be thinking of Slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW being shut out here despite 23 HCP between them|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bg: E let him go|pg||
nt|pelu: operator are u sure 2NT by S or by West?|pg||
nt|dburn: you can't afford to be predictable|pg||
nt|chilloncan: probably he hates opening 1D with nothing there|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we have a club player who always passes opening bids but do not expect to see it at this level|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: 6@C is a fine spot and not automatic to find with this competition|pg||
nt|othered1: was double forced?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: ok here we are|pg||
nt|dburn: South at the other table bid a forcing 2@h, which worked rather well|pg||
nt|dburn: North at this table didn't do enough bidding - after all, he could make a slam facing six hearts to the king-jack and zip|pg||
nt|tejjyid: exactly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't remember if original precision defined DBL as 5-8 HCP versus 3-level interference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe it was Negative ??|pg||
nt|othered1: with a friendlier trump break and a @H lead, this might make on a good day|pg||
nt|andyv:  too bad that 4@h had no play|pg||
nt|rodal f: N have good cards now after the pass at 2NT.|pg||
nt|andyv:  (unless @d was led)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Heng Sha gain on  24 when opponents don't bid game, match almost tied|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then I am lost after that|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bg: another 12 imps if he makes Taipei off 100 in 4 H|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H only down 1 after lead of @DQ to ruff in N|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to be club return,    this gets tricky |pg||
nt|jcwla: Oopsie.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: his hand is too good.. but :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming game force -- not an unreasonable guess from South|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: hello there|pg||
nt|sybarra: bjr henri @H |pg||
nt|bg: Hi Henri|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a 5@H bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps defending is the winning option here|pg||
nt|othered1: Then he's forcing the 5-level over a rather likely 4@D.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jameslee 2: looking for 9 tricks in East hand , 2@D/4@C/1@S/2@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  If S was going to bid up to 4@s, why not just bid 4@s immediately?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|pelu: easy if @C back: 5 @H-tricks (after the opening in N) 2@c+2@D|pg||
nt|xenya: something has gone very wrong here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: easy 9 tricks now - tough to avoid heart lead after 2H bid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: given the bidding,  and this lead,  declarer gets a bunch of ht tricks now|pg||
nt|pelu: yes @C to Q ( or even A and Q)|pg||
nt|ritong: if north has the 5 @hs promised, nothin bad can happen|pg||
nt|ritong: @s are locked|pg||
nt|chilloncan: welcome dburn, prince of the unpreditable. nobody expects the spanish inquisition|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: could be big swing here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: spades are, but declarer doesnt know that |pg||
nt|ritong: he does|pg||
nt|ritong: he held 108|pg||
nt|bg: "the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain"|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree with Justin's bidding -- once you elect to overcall with 1@S you are practically forced to bid 4 later cat these colours |pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: so what does S pitch on all the hts coming?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough hand call for South -- so Hanlon's choice of 3@H did it's job in that respect|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: *at, not "cat"|pg||
nt|rodal f: U can ask. Same as. Why didn't N support|pg||
nt|xenya: bad hand |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ritong: so there is no layout losing three @s tricks directly|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I don't think 4@s can make but maybe 4@h might|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm with Edgar Kaplan, as quoted in today's bulleting - there should be a fractional imp charge for every bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told, 2C = XYZ inv checkback,  but interesting we are not in spades|pg||
nt|tejjyid: That  would make for shorter auctions...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharkey: oops...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West is close to a 2@h overcall even after South's 1@h|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would do it if not vulnerable|pg||
nt|chessmaste: We should credit South for responding 1@H rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|chessmaste: MAFIA style|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sunsamvar: and the North pass has cost Shenzhen 22 imps.. lose 11 instead of gaining 11|pg||

nt|dburn: and thereby saved an overtrick, gnashing his teeth the while|pg||

nt|chilloncan: hit because you ahve to discover the sorting error iat exactly the right moment'|pg||
nt|sharkey: and won't make either|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Aah - the dreaded support double - one of the 25 conventions you don't need to know|pg||
nt|rodal f: As seen before S can be at 4@S and 2@C a ask|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c showed 8-11 hcp|pg||
nt|blum1956:  they have a beautiful option to double 2@h now (one down )|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would be scary|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C explained as natural GF or something else -- here it is the former|pg||
nt|blum1956:  anyway North must probably double to show GF|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: There is theoretical meritin underleading 3 consecutive honours - but from a 6 card suit, it's pretty tough to do|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 4-2 not too bad with 100 honours|pg||

nt|chilloncan: statistical result to practical application. rthe donwside of faulure is to gruesome to make the bet|pg||
nt|andyv:  lots of things can go wrong on this one for the defense|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: and with east having both red entries, the board will tie at 400|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right - partnership morale has to be taken into consideraton, & when it goes wrong, it is usually ugly|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose you could take the view that if partner doesn't have the ace, declarer will make the contract anyway, but...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I'm 1@H|pg||
nt|xenya: not me|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is the hand where as W if you are playing 2/1 and hear 1NT forcing by pd over 1@H you are consigned to rebid 2@C...|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcwla: Both E's passed over 1@H-1@S, would anyone have done anything different?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that is why i wd consider the 1 nt opening Jordan|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: doesns't look like a spinter to me.  too many possible tricks in @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: the lead=I have more @D's in my hand than you do in both hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: McGann's PASS denied 3+@H  [support double would apply]|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sunsamvar: nice guess of trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: at the table you would not do it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: partnership is not the worst of it. teammates and captain are almost surely going to take a dimmer view still|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thre was a 1980's BW article on this, and I saw Srere do it from KQJx once|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *Seres|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think support doubles are ok but should not be mandatory - I would bid 1NT on this South hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 10, S bid directly to 4@s and didn't get dbld, so 2 more imps for the NEDUK team|pg||
nt|andyv:  what do you shift to?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: presuming east short in @cs, declarer should tackjle trumps the right way|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: But what makes you think you make 3NT if you bid it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that should be 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: @D?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: ...it would be rather hard to justify that view if declarer's @s10 from A10 doubleton were his ninth trick|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Very odd - the king of clubs was obvious|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sharkey: you wont - unless you peeked...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 back to level the scores time is running out|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: The players don't have the hand records|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer still has only six tricks|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Six is better than five|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  South maybe expecting partner to have a singleton club when West bid NT and North didn't lead them|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chilloncan: yes, that proves the point ,,,,sere, he did it under an assumed name:):)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But I agree a club does look best|pg||
pc|sT|nt|blum1956:  Clearly North cannot have a singleton spade - he would have returned one in trick 2|pg||
nt|blum1956:  2 off if South overruffs and returns a trump|pg||
nt|xenya: E can duck this endplaying S|pg||
nt|rodal f: They have there meanings. Opening major by 4-4ma/mi so now it was a longer @S than 4. X for reopen is OK, but what id S had 6@S - 2@H  - 2@D - 3@C? In troubble? Well it wourks:)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think N shud lead a @C|pg||

nt|sharkey: :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tejjyid: If you play with result merchants David, only one thing works|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As North I would expect partner to usually have 3 or 4 spades given the bidding so at most three diamonds|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: ugly ugly contract|pg||

nt|jcomyn: that 3d took up a lot of space|pg||
nt|odysseus69: pass and redouble are extras from oppo|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: indeed relay takes advantage of such doubles|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i think he has to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South worried (wrongly) that pass might suggest playing in 3dX (redouble would)|pg||
mb|4D!|an|to 4H|nt|chilloncan: not sure why 2S appeals, with playability in both majors and only suit announced by opps is clubs|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 2D i mean|pg||
nt|dburn: well, look at the result|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 imps|pg||
nt|dburn: if he'd bid only 1@d, South would maybe have had some chance to bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think North has been a little conservative not X'ing on the 2nd round|pg||
nt|othered1: There's a case to bid with both hands.  I double on north's hand either my first or second at bat.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: also, South might balance - I'm sympatheticto the 1st pass by South, with the soft cards & misfit, but defending 2@D won't be much fun|pg||
nt|lestergold: it shouold be now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North has shown 5-4-1-3 but suit qualities etc still unknown|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooh er|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2N looks reasonable at this point|pg||
nt|othered1: if east reopens with a double are you allowed to pass as west?|pg||

nt|othered1: Guess you are.|pg||

pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: South can't continue @H without easing McGann's pain|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sunsamvar: maybe duck this may have led to some possibility of end play... but not here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and if @D shift   fly King  finesse @S    even if that loses  5@S 2@D 1@H 1@C for 9|pg||
nt|othered1: even if south could have returned low, west has simple avoidance play in @S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ahhh I hadn't thought about @HQ at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nice play!|pg||
nt|othered1: nice play, changing the picture for declarer a bit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck seems right|pg||

nt|xenya: well done indeed|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: is the dbl asking for @C lead or @S|pg||

nt|jcomyn: there's the 5-0 break gary you were talking about earlier|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: indeed|pg||
nt|sharkey: Possibilities if E decides to set up @C suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: X may discourage that?|pg||

pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: Now he makes is if he goes after clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will he after the x?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Must decide which suit breaks, if any|pg||
nt|xenya: highly imaginative double by N -- particularly if it asked for a spade lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Likely gifted declarer 1 trick|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think he'll go for @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: My prediction record is not very good :(|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now maybe only 1 down|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Now a second chance for the defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but McGann sees that playing @S from top protects @HJ|pg||
nt|othered1: now his avoidance was to keep south off lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i missed that too|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: hardly fun for NS here, but the contract might be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  @C return seems lazy for W... why not play Q@h?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bet they p[lay 3nt in open|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if they hadnt announced them, that makes the objective of preempting against hem even less appealing|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but the truth is that against nebulous minor openings, it really does pay to pre-empt even on off-kilter hands|pg||
nt|sharkey: The @D6 may deny an Honor with N|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: If S takes the K and return @D East will be forced to play on @C as no entry to @H even if split 3-3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: still looks like 2 down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: you got it John|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that club 8 looks big|pg||
nt|rmb1: Aren't declarer's honours enough for -1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if he guesses to play low here then 1 down but how can he do that|pg||
nt|rmb1: closed room making 3NT (I am told)|pg||
nt|rmb1: @HQ loses to K, @H back, @CK @CJ @SA cross ruff for -1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: cant play low surely|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: NEDUK 59-52 after 8 vs Hackett I'm told|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he could rise and play for spades 3-3 and clubs 3-2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: in south's defense, partner did only overcall and then not act again, he's misfit, and west often has in imperfect 2@D bid over the negative double.  Defending could be only plus.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: This leaves E a losing option|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: But I'd have bid at my first turn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HA was another nice try from @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from S  not  @S|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: In OR Patrick Huang in East - in 3. seat - open 1@H - and NS never found the combined @H-stop: 5@C -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry all,  this is last hand I believe |pg||
nt|pelu: why?|pg||
nt|sybarra: we hope to have tables connected in the next set|pg||
nt|ritong: scoreboard says 14|pg||
nt|sybarra: score says 14,  but they seem to set it up with 2 extra bds |pg||
nt|ritong: oh|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry maybe it is 14 |pg||
nt|ritong: very prudent:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yesterday they set it up with 16 |pg||
nt|sybarra: and it was 14  so what do I know |pg||
pc|c9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wiped the deficit plus some|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|jtr: Actually, was there anything they could do about 3NT?|pg||
nt|jtr: bye@h|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@ss then @h is best|pg||
nt|roswolf: this bidding is a magical mystery tour to me|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jtr: Ah no  Long @s only the 8th trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: splinter|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chessmaste: Best is to continue spades - then declarer has to work hard - ducks the second, wins the third then plays a diamond and can endplay West  - not obvious|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east should bid on|pg||
nt|roswolf: as should west|pg||
nt|jtr: West can hardly do so|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jtr: 2@h would have been better|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: now south on the horns of a dilemna|pg||
mb|5S|nt|chessmaste: Tough decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: 5@h would have been tough to beat|pg||

nt|xenya: i thought it was almost impossible to get trumps right|pg||
nt|chilloncan: admit i have had some partners where the off-kilt idea was worth thinking about|pg||
nt|lestergold: bidding in open at these colours unbelievable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on previous board Precision 1@D opened by West  --  will Li Rui also reopen with DBL??    standby|pg||
nt|blum1956:  2 off looks not that bad|pg||
nt|andyv:  10 imps to Hackett on board 10|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12 big ones|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  more imps to come as NS are in 4@sX in OR on board 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-16 HCP, 5+@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  but board 12 should be a disaster for the Hackett team|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: ridiculous result from the other table in the abstract, but no one did anything really stupid in the bidding|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i would not pass 2H with the E hand|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Quick, another coffee|pg||
nt|othered1: OZ Two, who selected their opponents for this round (privilege for winning the qualifying round robin), started out fast on the first three boards, but haven't scored an imp since ...|pg||
nt|othered1: then.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who wins here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: trans. by N|pg||
nt|othered1: some would double 1@D with west's hand|pg||
nt|dburn: nor would I, although maybe I should|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in here i mean|pg||
nt|lestergold: very strange auction in open|pg||
nt|rmb1: 5@H (making) over 4@S |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so par is 5@S -1|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no way would i pass the e hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 7 card support for pards suit usually enough to bid|pg||
nt|rmb1: This could be what the Bulgarians need|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is s going to bid again|pg||
nt|rmb1: Can beat 5@H by lead diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that pass from East is pusilanimous|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: yes, hand short in their suit must act, even if a bit under strength|pg||
nt|tejjyid: needs an iron will to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: East Passed the x in OR|pg||
nt|rmb1: 5@C psychic cue bid ?:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that the right spelling victor|pg||
mb|5S|nt|xenya: but maybe he was just trying to minimise his losses|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd have played the @Hq trying to pin the 10 or 8... but the lack of entries to dummy wd had led to him laying down the Ace|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: meanwhile we have a thin vul game here.|pg||
nt|xenya: i really don't see where N found the 4@H bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he has to hope for all minor suit honours with Li|pg||
nt|dburn: would rather bid 2@s than have it go 2@h-pass-4@h-pass-pass-headache|pg||
nt|lestergold: south likes it too much to double|pg||
nt|othered1: well, pass of 1@H by south hand isn't something everyone would choose, either|pg||
nt|caitlin: with 6-5|pg||
nt|sybarra: more importantly with an Ace|pg||
nt|caitlin: indeed:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: but 6-5 with Ace!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: opposite an 11-15 opening there's not the same pressure to keep the auction open|pg||
nt|rmb1: I hope so, that is Victor's fourth attempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: IN OR NS fast in 4@S and now west i playing 5@h|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit high|pg||
nt|ritong: as was 4@s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but where did S find the Double?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: on the information South has so far, the hand is a misfit &they have less than 1/2 the deck|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: right   too much to X |pg||
nt|tejjyid: drawing to a close - KISS started slowly but picked up momentum after a while|pg||
nt|andyv:  hands don't fit well together...4@h will end it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Kovachev not play fast arrival by passed pard?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: 12 boards played this is only third part score! |pg||
pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: which is a bit like life really....|pg||
nt|tejjyid: from the long dealy, you can assume PO won the 1st trick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *elay|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *delay|pg||
nt|rodal f: CR at 11|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: difficult lead for north|pg||
nt|lestergold: and lead lets it thru|pg||
nt|sybarra: putting finger on a spade and this could have been ugly|pg||
nt|lestergold: what an evil hand|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: 4. best - very easy :)|pg||
nt|ritong: bakhshi can see that contract is cold with @hs 3/2, so he has to work out something if this is not the case|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade takes it 3 off|pg||
nt|caitlin: lucky singleton @H where @SA is|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: well, he wasn't sure the auction would end if he doubled - maybe he would get to double 4@s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: absolutely|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe they wopuil;d play in clubs which is rather hard tol double|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I would have bid 3 hts on the get go with S hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: As we see this is a make with S having Kx in @C......|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: noone wants to play a suit.. so trumps may be continued :0|pg||
nt|sharkey: Bridge is easy when we get to look at all four hands :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: There's a lot to be said for NOT leading a Q@H though|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  9 imps to Hackett on 11|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chilloncan: 3H could be good news bad news...might kep them out, but might turn plus into minus|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: The name of the game at IMPs today is "bid them up"|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: even k of clubs might have worked|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very odd might have plasyed in 4s|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: well. S has support in all the unbid suits -- sort of|pg||
nt|chilloncan: always hard to know what to do with those|pg||
nt|lestergold: i vote for 3@h|pg||
nt|xenya: as E is short of entries |pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: McGann needed to duck the opening lead  --   but is that obvious?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and can declarer counter by ducking too??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute  if he does  then Hanlon leads @SJ and again McGann ducks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: in which position?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and let opps get on with it...|pg||
nt|lestergold: south raising to 3@h|pg||
nt|xenya: the correct line is not clear however|pg||
nt|sybarra: *would work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a weird race it would have been|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CKx may be the "only chance"|pg||
nt|xenya: but i'm not sure about board 12 Andy -- N can hardly fail to overcall. and after that 2@SX is quite likely   |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: pard did open red, with 2 hts,   he cant be totally broke|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s5|nt|othered1: it's wrong only if you think you're giving declarer exactly his 9th trick.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

nt|xenya: to finesse clubs twice |pg||

nt|andyv:  oh well, it worked:)|pg||
nt|xenya: *for Hackett|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcwla: Maybe 2NT by N as pick a minor instead of 3@C.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice 2N bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to see 11imps on this hand so it looks like Heng Sha v NEDUK in final|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: sure wish we knew what South's DBL meant  - that could help explain McGann's failure to show 5@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Beijing picked up 9 imps on 29  [in the other room 2@S -200]|pg||

nt|andyv:  meanwhile the lovely contract of 4@c has been reached here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bid bader than here. 1@H - 2@S - P - P - X. At vul?|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d shift will seal the fate of this contract|pg||
nt|blum1956:  the @d switch looks obvious|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: oops   we [and i bet Zhengjun] thought 2N was a scramble for minor suit|pg||

pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: hanks Jordan and all.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I'm not sure about 2@s when you can also bid 2NT|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still, if he knows North has four spades he should make it easily |pg||
nt|andyv:  Paul escaped|pg||

pc|dK|nt|jcwla: The t/o x makes the 2-2 split totally expected and it's all peaches and cream here for decl.|pg||

pc|d6|nt|petergill: No entries to set up spades. If @H9 is finessed through South, it's curtains.|pg||

nt|petergill: He might rise @DA to lead a low heart through Sotuh, picking up bare @HA in South|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: But it's marginally against the odds to finesse|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: she's in the wings, rehearsing|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|blum1956:  Bakshi misdefended - North could not have more than 5 red cards so the diamond swith was safe|pg||

nt|sybarra: and of course thx to NEC for bringing this tourney to bbo.  (think is for 7th year)|pg||
nt|caitlin: last 1/4 final|pg||

nt|andyv:  another 3N opener...2 in the same match.|pg||

nt|sybarra: bet we are off to 6 @D in this room |pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems flawed for East to become declarer in @H  --  but  NS aren't finished|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: how badly will 6@CX be hurt if declarer takes some right views?|pg||
nt|caitlin: and it's so close to br swinging now|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|tejjyid: trading trmp loser for @C ruff, so not much in it, Ed|pg||

nt|andyv:  strange or not, it's effective|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  and this time Paul didn't dbl 4@d:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the All Stars had a great qualifying and may feel a little hard done by, but still a great effort|pg||
nt|rmb1: Final starts at 01:00 GMT 02:00 CET (and at sensible times in the Pacific rim)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: Declarer might get out for 300 if he sets up spades|pg||

nt|tejjyid: not so hard|pg||
nt|caitlin: W opened 2N.....|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry yes after 2 @D easy|pg||
nt|petergill: If West passes 6@D to East who bids 6@H, I think South would have bid 7@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a low @D best now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Been a lot privat chats with u specs, lovly and hopefully some advices:) Tkx to my co commentators. Well done to:) But the best is always the vug operator. Nice work. Su u all back ...|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, a low diamond reduces the entries to dummy to set up spades - wd Nabil Edgtton|pg||
nt|othered1: If west's first pass showed extras, I don't think he has a second pass, but it's close|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye all|pg||
