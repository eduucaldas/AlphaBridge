mb|2N!|nt|motu: they play a strong @C system|pg||
nt|april7: competitive battle, 4@S aainst 4@H|pg||
nt|april7: against|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 5@H also making, except on @C lead and underplay of Ace of @S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|suketbombi: 5@H can be beaten on a @C ruff  provided east bids it|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: after ace of @H ofcourse|pg||
nt|motu: 5@C is unbeatable|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes 5@c in the CR was right on the money|pg||
mb|5C|nt|april7: 5@C though can't be beaten,N very disciplined again|pg||
nt|yuval10: in his eyes he has only 5 points ( Q@c is garbage ) and semi-balanced hand, not enough for a competitive 3@s|pg||
nt|april7: but N is thinking!!!|pg||
nt|april7: 5@S only 2 down|pg||
mb|5S|nt|yuval10: now he can sense the @s fit from Partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: but 5@S!!!:)|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2N|nt|kareno: Can't make slam even without the club lead, though, as east ruffs the third heart.|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w can score 5 @C here or 4 @H |pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: right|pg||
nt|sybarra: but they may have to bid 5 @C over 4 @S |pg||

mb|3C|mb|4C|mb|5C|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: S could be pushed now to 5@S |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzwx: this time when his p bid 5sp he have AJ 5th ! :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol Ron|pg||
nt|yuval10: E didn't want to lead a singelton while holding QXX @s, seem sensible|pg||
nt|april7: N has to find Q of @S and if N should duck this trick, E will get a @H ruff immediately for 1 down|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|yuval10: now A@h and @h|pg||
nt|april7: N counted to give up 1 @C and 1 @H, but still has to find Q of @S|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|april7: if W does not play @H now, N has a big chance!!!|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows his Partner has 6 @c's, so declarer has 4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|yuval10: so as i were saying, if N has 4 @c's and a singel @d, then he logically has 4-4 in majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzwx: N didnt guess the Q @S|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart would be best now.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what is the best line to play 5@C here ?|pg||
nt|othered1: may be down, rather.  Play for @H is inferior|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly more control in the spade suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i guess setting up @Ds imm is best|pg||
nt|othered1: what would be the effect of low @S?|pg||

nt|april7: here we have a slam in @H|pg||
nt|yuval10: another great chance for the Israeli team to even the score|pg||

nt|april7: S would have made about 3 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|yuval10: don't really understand what's wrong with 3@c, then you give room for Partner to bid and introduce his @h's|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|april7: E shows at least 10 minor cards, so a @H fit is probably not there|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|yuval10: bid 4@c here with 3 @h's just seem wrong to me|pg||
nt|april7: E wanted to show his gamegoing hand, because 3@C would not bw forcing|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can make a grand slam against KXXXXXX @h from Partner and you might be playing 4 @c's |pg||
nt|april7: no, 4@C is forcing, 3@C not!!!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|s8|nt|yuval10: is it?  so you expect partner to bid game with XXXXX  XXXX  XX XX ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: or even less in minors?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|april7: gameforce is gameforce, no matter what partner has!!!:)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|yuval10: i think it's hardly a gameforce whatsoever|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|april7: this is a metter of opinion, but if you have a gameforcing hand and p has xxx,xxx,xxx,xxxx you must bid the game whatsoever!|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|yuval10: nothing about opinion here, only forcing bid is 3@s|pg||
nt|april7: also a matter of opinion|pg||
nt|yuval10: then you bid 4@c over (persumably ) 3NT and shows a forcing hand with at least 5-5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s4|nt|april7: this would have worked here, but its a to much distributional hand|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s5|pc|h9|nt|yuval10: nice ending here, North is squeezed and if he throw @d will be endplayed|pg||
nt|april7: E has a 3-4 loser hand and the 2@S bid encouraged E to try for game, because of presumably no losing values in @S|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|d9|pg||
mc|10|nt|yuval10: but then again, 4 @c is NOT a game forcing :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: they might overreach to slam :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: In a natural auction, west's initial @H bid might be 4th suit forcing and can be tough to get things  unwound.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kareno: 2@c some sort of raise.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|santyclz: Let me guess that's not a xfer to @ds?|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: Perhaps Drury|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: not sure what the bids mean sorry|pg||
