mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|iceking: 1@S would be my choice also here |pg||
mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: Yes, people have learned to overcall then double, preferable to doubling then bidding|pg||
mb|2D|nt|iceking: not sure though why W bid 2@C instead of 1nt |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|iceking: maybe reasonable with the texture of his hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: Maybe he considered the 432 in spades as a warning.  It does seem like a deep position nevertheless|pg||

mb|p|nt|noodle:  yes and milne mounted a great come back yesterday that kept me up till 4 am :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the 2nd set of 4 16-board segments|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Andrew|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: this hand may well be opened 1NT in both rooms (but i think) its a strong NT in this room and a weak NT in the other room|pg||
nt|frankaus: The Bloom crew is staffed by hardened proffesionals - |pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|1H|nt|noodle:  seems ok to upgrade a good 14; as we have seen  opening bids are very agressive nowadays|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: both teams are playing 5-handed|pg||
nt|gambit: one @S or dble, close|pg||
nt|sybarra2: go for it!!  great fun Edgar|pg||
nt|sybarra2: you hate to miss 6 @D |pg||
mb|1N!|an|2 minors|nt|tejjyid: X presume single/suited|pg||
nt|frankaus: Milne crew the next generation of excellence - have been at the top of many international junior events|pg||
nt|tejjyid: interesting problem for East|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: E let S off the hook|pg||
nt|gambit: will N bid spades next. yes if at an economical level |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: likely n/s still find 2 sp or so |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this table is same set of players as Q1 -- just flipping NS & EW|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gambit: "Somebody said down one is good bridge, perhaps making is better." EK|pg||
nt|gambit: nice lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables were not linked, so the closed room operator shut down in order to reconnect. Back now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He will insert result on board 1 in MOVIE soon|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok  did we get names sorted out?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: no|pg||
nt|Walddk4: must wait till next segment|pg||

pc|s9|nt|noodle:  well it is a great spot  wd|pg||
nt|mwigor: with everything so friendly 11 tricks are possible|pg||
nt|mwigor: but declarer will be more concerned with maximising his chance of 10|pg||
nt|frankaus: my suits never break this faviorable :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  if they did franj you d be playing not commenting :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all of those young ex-pat Kiwis look alike to me|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: hi all|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Raija and Al:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrmal to upgrade 14's with good 5 card suits to 15-17 these days, although EW may play 14-16|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: signaling ofr a @C|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I would have 3 years ago ...|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: popular to play this bidding from N as weak scramble|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No system should take you to 2NT on this pair of hands|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They might escape, as the lie is friendly, but it's a really poor auction|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: West's love affair with the doubleton heart lead continues.  There's some logic to it, on this auction|pg||

nt|tejjyid: not that it beats the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winners of this event will get an invitation and $6000 subsidy to attend the 2011 Yeh Bros Cup this coming April|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but highly likely to be flat|pg||
nt|sybarra: just one of those hands :(|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, nowt you can do|pg||
nt|noodle:  re hi every one :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi and welcome |pg||
nt|sybarra2: not sure what happened all  |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|tejjyid: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: in this situation gosney could probably have won the diamond unless he needed martin to switch|pg||
nt|noodle:  tx shirley   it seems Milne will need another comeback|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+|pg||
nt|gambit: looks like a part-score battle and the reigning suit should prevail|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  the imp is not much  but the fact they ended up in a great spot on a tough hand can boost morale early in the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat  Hans-Nunn play Weak NT   3rd/4th Strong|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Ain't 6.000$ a peace of cake? Is for my workers. OK. Stop now.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe only at the 2 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I wold call it a lucky spot, not a great spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: false pref wit 1-2 ???|pg||
nt|noodle:  i agree :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  better lucky than good, though :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: auto 2@S, IMO|pg||
nt|gambit: 1@D?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|tejjyid: it's not a disastrous position, but it is difficult|pg||
nt|noodle:  opening bids are getting worse by the second imho|pg||
nt|sybarra: we saw it yesterday, maybe a repeat|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Peake never saw an 11 count he couldn't open|pg||
nt|noodle:  or i m getting old :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: ok we're back live now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|rodal f: Road on?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zone 6 is bringing us 2 fun events in the next 2 months    early/mid February  NEC Cup from Yokahama  [vugraph schedule already posted] and the YEH Bros|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|tejjyid: although PASS stops partner from taking your hand in any way seiously|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: [most of] Milne team is looking for 3rd straight NOT final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 2010 they were 2nd in both this event and the Spring NOT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with a slight change to team for the Spring event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Milne-Whibley were semi-finalists in 2009 while still New Zealanders|pg||
nt|sybarra: then maybe we are all getting old |pg||
nt|sybarra2: 1 @D= 0-4  not a good hand |pg||
mb|2S|nt|mwigor: i think i like pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  often pass is better when really crappy hand|pg||
nt|noodle:  44 in minors an nothing in majors is asking for trouble in the competitive bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should go quickly |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: which, since you have complete rubish, may be a good argument for the PASS|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: 2 @C = stayman|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: I think there is a contradiction between overcalling on not much, and bidding game here on the East cards|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and from there is looks like "junk stayman" |pg||
nt|sybarra2: am told 1 @D = 07 |pg||
nt|sybarra2: sorry thought less |pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S seems like confirmation of the 3@S bid|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|gambit: q@C|pg||
nt|sybarra2: easy from here,  but good idea,  not back in dummy too many times|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: ok  once a Kiwi always a Kiwi|pg||
nt|andyv:  good evening Al, Lauren and specs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D not doubled in other room|pg||
nt|rodal f: See -2 at the beginning. The end.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Andy and hi Al.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|tejjyid: A number of spectators pointing out that opening isn't the prtoblem, not open 1@D is the problem|pg||
nt|noodle:  did martin bloom play 2nd set ( I was off ) ?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mwigor: looks like 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  good evening Mark:)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  Peake bid 2@C over 1@S  --  Whibley's 2N seems much clearer|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|gambit: comeon...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: and many say that both 2@C and 2@S would be natural over 1@S|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|othered1: might west have been better off, in practice, by pitching @C on 3rd @H?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: Ish is X'd in 5@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS need to make up ground and may explain their aggressive bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: NS had a discussion about who showed what sort of partial spade stopper when dummy appeared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what was the conclusion??|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think E showed the best stopper:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish thought the pass by prescott showed about three small|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: it gets tricky when they allow a @S suit with 15 or 16 cards in it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: Peake in 4@D East|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  and what was dbl by N... card showing?|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Sadly, I have to agree with this auction.  East's hand does look suitable for taking 1NT back to 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: yes looks automatic|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: Normally, I think 2@H should show 6 of them, expecting West to have raised hearts with suitable 3-card support|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But with the singleton diamond, and weak hand, you think partner won't be able to make use of your hearts in 1NT|pg||
nt|iceking: east rather unlucky with this dummy |pg||
nt|bigtrain: not to open a new can of worms... but it all depends on partnership agreememnt about raising on 3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: Sure, if you're French, you apparently get the guillotine if you raise with 3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But they are all in bed ...|pg||
nt|bigtrain: btw i really dislike rebidding 1NT with a singleton...  i'd open 1@D planning on rebiddine 2@C over the expected 1H response|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hmm|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: lethal injection perhaps?|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|bigtrain: i'd even consider 1@S on thr KQJ rather than bidding 1NT/1@H with a singleton|pg||

pc|s5|pc|h4|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|iceking: i agree Walter would do the same |pg||
pc|d8|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps opening 1@C and rebidding 1@S is a less of a lie than 1@D then 2@C |pg||
pc|s6|nt|bigtrain: and put me firmly in the 4-card raise camp for all thise that are interested  :)|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|noodle:  some people think it is easier to bid 1@d over 1@c than the opposite, hence the 1@c bid... i prefer 1@d on 44 minors|pg||
nt|noodle:  hi MJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play 1@C=2+ with transfer responses|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS carding  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs NT the also play "OddBall" in following to declarer's suit|pg||
nt|noodle:  now we ll have a real canadian commentator :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I prefer to open my best suit of 4-4|pg||
nt|noodle:  opening best suit on weak hands is good for lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: brb guys,  checking other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  I think EW played the junior trial the week before the NOT , right ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's my view|pg||
nt|gambit: I don't like 1NT rebid with a singleton but others disagree|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  nice pull by W|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: great explanation!!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: what does 5@D show?       faith|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if that showing faith means he doesn't trust partner's penalty doubles:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish is now complaining that he didn't know 3C was alerted|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West, maybe|pg||
nt|mwigor: they both played in youth week|pg||
nt|noodle:  they show stamina then|pg||
nt|mwigor: but not in the trial for the australian youth team|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like this auction at all|pg||

nt|noodle:  tx specs :)|pg||

pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: accepts the transfer:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  seven card suits are hard to describe in middle of auctions|pg||

nt|noodle:  as spec points out NS have a different system of answers to 1@c  it might tip the scales|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Indeed, if you have complex methods 1@C is better, as leaving more room to exercise them|pg||
nt|noodle:  I also have a rattle theory when it comes to bridge gadgets|pg||
nt|noodle:  it goes like this :|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: Peake did raise to 2@S   --  but won't get any extra credit if both contracts make|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, it's a purely academic point on this hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: commentator's noise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opposite passed hand, i actually like Whibley's PASS -- partner now KNOWS 3@S support  and  won't go overboard|pg||
nt|sybarra: knowing him,  will speak when "needed"|pg||
nt|noodle:  does anyone play unusual vs unusual ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|noodle:  Silver used to call K from Kx a journalist lead, cause if it works you can end up in the paper (of course here it was the unbid suit)|pg||

nt|gambit: wel ed|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|noodle:  a nice way to play it is to use 3@c as @hs weak or strong  3@d as spades weak or strong and 3 of a major as invitational|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: its close, he has rather good hand if pd has like a stayman respond|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: Well he's got the best of both worlds here |pg||
nt|iceking: east has to dbl this |pg||
nt|iceking: no real accident if it makes |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: or West ... for takeout|pg||
nt|bigtrain: spec doubles of 2m can be made very aggressively|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: this is rather ugly bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This seems to be a real failure of the E/W methods|pg||
pc|s5|nt|iceking: its a bidding situation that doesnt happen everyday |pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: It's rare indeed, which is why you need generalized agreements|pg||
pc|sA|nt|iceking: its still clear for me east should dbl 2@D|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: me also|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I would play that as takeout, in principle ... partner doubles 1NT for penalties, I like to play takeout doubles subsequently|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: Clearly this is a somewhat different situation, which is why you have to have general principles to fall back to|pg||
nt|bigtrain: once penalty doubles begin, all further Xs are penalty for me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you had such principles, East can pass, and West can make a takeout double|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So Walter, if they open a weak NT against you, and you double, do you play partner's double of the rescue as penalties?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|iceking: problem here w might not have takoutdbl its possible like he has 17hcp with 5-3-2-3 shape |pg||
pc|h9|pg||

pc|c2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But as pointed out, who would have discussed this particular auction?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not to me...  penaltyX is much different than a cardX|pg||
pc|s9|nt|iceking: for me dbl of 1nt is 2way not cards, either weak takout of @S or pen with primary @S suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So what should double by East mean?|pg||
nt|iceking: pen|pg||
nt|bigtrain: pen|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And West?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: pen|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont make takoutdbl into pds takout dbl |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|d8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But just a moment, are you saying that West's double of 1NT was takeout?|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||

mb|p|nt|noodle:  1@s2@c2@h3@h then what ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  probably S gave count on K@s|pg||

mb|1S|nt|andyv:  2@c xfer to @cs|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: pure transfer of   size ask or trf?|pg||

nt|frankaus: 3NT is anothet scycic option but thats fairly transparent|pg||

nt|mwigor: almost unplayable any other way|pg||
nt|rodal f: A pay by the opening?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: perhaps passing 1 @S was right|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but maybe easier from here to say|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: right  if 2@S was size ask, 2N would say  reject NT invite|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: prescott says |pg||

nt|vugrapha2: so sounds like 2S= range ask|pg||
nt|andyv:  didn't miss anything|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hmm maybe not|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no way is it 100%; it's by arrangement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat, great shape  @S suit -- automatic 3rd seat opener|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think I'd be more likley to bid 3@H - not so successful here|pg||
nt|noodle:  I like 3N better than 2@S :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact I bet he'd open 1@S in ANY seat|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|frankaus: green V red + youth - 5 level NP|pg||
nt|sybarra2: some times you get to bid your 6 card suit |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|sybarra2: and sometimes your pard even bid 2 @H |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mwigor: david beauchamp thinks that south should have doubled 5@h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, to stop anyone bidding 5@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: although we can see that they can make 650 if they bid on|pg||
nt|mwigor: taking the money in 5@h is a much safer option|pg||
pc|dT|nt|noodle:  agreed  this ia a forcing pass situation double as 2 losers is relatively normal (by arrangement of course)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: S hand doesn't look like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duplicate auctions -- i must admit i would have bid a mere 3@H with East|pg||
nt|tejjyid: seems about right to me as well|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  only thing missed is possibly wrong siding this NT:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: i can see "like C" written by prescott|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course - i wouldn't overcall 2@H  but that is a different topic :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|othered1: That's an ex post facto conclulsion -- maybe opening and planning to pass 1N (unless they play SNAP, Strong Nt After Pass) isn't optimal strategy.  But I'm not one to question ...|pg||
nt|othered1: someone as experienced and successful as south.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|rodal f: To many loosers at S. Why not trust ure pard and bid then???     If ure pard act.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told that the 1700 from 3rd Quarter is showing up on the ABF site, which reflects scores entered by the PLAYERS -- so it must be right   [even if hard to fathom]|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mwigor: same contract in both rooms - so i predict another flat board|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|vugrapha2: so looks like C transfer, positive acceptance, and then shutdown|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe as a passed hand you have alittle more scope to bid 2@S - but must surely be rock bottom for it|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sybarra2: yes esp. South |pg||
nt|sybarra2: (or I know S best)|pg||

nt|iceking: not for me if W dbl 2@D its takoutish|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then you are into the situation where one party has penalty doubles, and the other takeout doubles, which is sort of inefficient|pg||
nt|iceking: so typical hand would be like 5-4-1-3 15|pg||
mb|2S|nt|iceking: 15+hcp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right, which is why MY auction would have been Pass by East,  takeout double by West, penalty pass by East|pg||

mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|andyv:  not sure what purpose 2@s served...in OR, S bid 3@d (puppet stayman) which makes more sense on this hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: No inverce here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: i was wondering what Adam [Edgtton] was going to respond|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I Was assuming 1@S..|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: south must bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: south opened 2@h in the other room and is declarer in 4@h|pg||
nt|mwigor: (presumably this showed some 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i don't know their NT response ranges -- suspect 1@C-2@C requires 5+@C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid shows Strong NT|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I recall that 57% is the tipping point - it'd beclose to that|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  cleverly avoiding the 5-4 @h fit|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: for most [many?] 2/1 players --  the 1@D response either denies 4+@H/@S or hand is strong enough to invite over a weak NT rebid|pg||
pc|d9|nt|noodle:  also note that south has has the 7@d for mosy hands  very important in junior bridge|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mwigor: hard to see how they could get it wrong in fact|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|s8|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|tejjyid: That was the bid I expected here - transfer responses very popular|pg||
nt|noodle:  in north america need high level events (top bracket KO or nationals) to be allowed methods like that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think Adam is playing with any regular partners|pg||
nt|noodle:  very restrictive system laws here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: true, it's not a good method for the casual partnership|pg||
nt|noodle:  it is my opinion that such rules deter young people from the game|pg||
nt|noodle:  that s why it is so refreshing to have BBO|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe - I think the need for restrictions is overstated but I see the argument|pg||
nt|noodle:  ( end of shameless plug )|pg||
nt|tejjyid: The problem is it's hard to test in a revenue neutral way|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: let's be fair Normand -- the ACBL has more rules than that to deter young and innovative players|pg||

nt|noodle:  not enough to wear it of course...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Go on there:) |pg||
nt|noodle:  very tight match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  5 of 6 hands pushed --  last set the averaged over 5 imps swung per board|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this set much quieter than the last|pg||
nt|sybarra2: these hands have been so unfriendly |pg||
mb|1D!|an|1+!d|nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat = weak NT   so Hans must start with 1-suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: just realized -- all of these australians are ex-pat Kiwis|pg||
nt|andyv:  the state of the match made 2N more appealing.. can't keep duplicating results in OR.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most hands with 4@C & 4@D are opened 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: indeed they are all ex-kiwis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope   i've been told  once a Kiwi always a Kiwi :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  will south try a baby psych too ?  :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  11 on a partscore deal|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: 23HP NS but best spot EW.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@c interesting here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if DBL was 4+@S or 4/5@S [which is how the Italians play it]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America, the standard is  1m-(1@H)-DBL = exactly 4@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the alert, I suspect 4/5|pg||
nt|andyv:  my comment regarding 3@c is that 2N seems very tempting with S hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no,he has a good constructive hand|pg||

nt|noodle:  ladies and gentleman, we have a match :)|pg||
mb|2D!|an|GF|nt|noodle:  i like the weak notrump non vul  either I have Acol ancestors or i m a chicken noodle|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the precision 1 @D I think again|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: when i played with paul that XX would have shown 4+@d|pg||
nt|mwigor: i doubt martin plays that though|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they.....? Hard|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they alter range exclusively by seat  ---     marty bergen: vulnerability is for children|pg||
nt|noodle:  y all those players tell us vulnerability doesn t matter and stop playing :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: My best controled slam was bidded by 15HP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: harder for North to PASS after partner opens strong 1N|pg||
nt|noodle:  and we go -1100 :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I found that the weak NT solves lot's of bidding problems, but it gves away a lot of information when it ISN"T opened (player is unblanaced) plus it's hard to compete sensibly ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after people bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *lots|pg||
nt|noodle:  use rubensold or similar methods :) lol|pg||
nt|tejjyid: deficit down to 21|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: assumes 2N would be natural|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: said 2nt would surely show 18-19 or so|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would think it would be but I'm guessing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: my guess is this shows 11+ and @C|pg||
nt|noodle:  we name the XX under strenght "kindergarden"  here|pg||
nt|noodle:  like :  you won t make it  yes i will  :)|pg||
nt|gambit: of course N will drive to game, but what game, spades best|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: both pairs play precision here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tejjyid: NOrth can try 2NT or 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some might use it as Good/Bad  [so 3@C is better hand than 2N]|pg||
nt|noodle:  the method of using pass as 10+ balanced and transfers (starting with redouble) was suggested by Garozzo over a take out double and is gaining popularity|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pragmatic|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  could be but then 3@c would be alertable|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I don't expect these two using good/bad|pg||
nt|andyv:  they at least got to game|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: think I can see a "4+" scribble describing the double|pg||

nt|noodle:  if shirley lets me :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: YOure typing seems up to it ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 rounds of @H then @D?    West may not have enough entries  [South can prevent @SJ from being entry]|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Peake does well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: totally moot point because North will never lead @H on this auction|pg||
mb|2D!|an|MM weak|nt|noodle:  well NS finally get on the board|pg||
nt|tejjyid: something like that, getting another round of @D in early seems critical|pg||

mb|2N|nt|mwigor: martin makes 3NT for 10 IMPs when the other table played a partscore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natural weak 2@D --- how retro|pg||
nt|noodle:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:P64/Bridge/point-count    75321 point count|pg||
nt|fifee: this could be the one :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3N?   2@D??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room in 3@H South|pg||
nt|tejjyid: suit quality is not so retro|pg||
nt|sybarra2: havent been friendly hands,  but also not exciting|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tejjyid: There's an argument for NOrth raising, just because he has support|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: ish keeps on mixing it up :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: funky multi |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  now 4@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: or majors wk |pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: thinks his hand is too good for 2@S rebid -- or maybe 2@D was a transfer advance?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like the West raise on Hx in the pre-empted suit|pg||
nt|noodle:  NS needed a good board to change momentum  (if there is such a thing)|pg||
nt|fifee: 9 tricks at 3nt with a @D lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tejjyid: good valuein a trump lead|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes it often allows a lead|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andyv:  2@d looked like LR|pg||
nt|mwigor: if alex wins the first round of @c his pips provide him with a second stopper|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It certainly feels like there is a momentum when you're playing|pg||
nt|fifee: @HQ conveniently dropping :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure wish i had a convention card or notes :(|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: no surprise --  trump lead would have worked better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Sartaj also expected West to have SOMETHING in @D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: s the world's worst opening leader, I'm loath to criticise - but this auction screamed trump |pg||
nt|ahollan1: my 2nd choice would have been @C lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  don't need one to see this won't be successful|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: whibley asked something, to which ish said "no discussion"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well correction of 4@H to 4@S surely rules OUT transfer advances|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was Double Dummy Hopeless|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: i double your claim -- in college systems were devised to make ME the opening leader|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mwigor: its a common mistake made that people hold up automatically - overlooking the possibility of another trick in the suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I would have paid  money to see East make that error|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|tejjyid: let's not play together ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not for money, anyway :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oof   STILL no trump|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gambit: I Love Leb. Great convention. If a partner does not play it, I know they are not expert. Sad, but true. BRB|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  for all we know 2@h could have been a help suit game try if 2@d was a limit raise or better.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tejjyid: now, let's set up @D..|pg||
nt|sybarra2: agree Cam |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and I play it every where|pg||
nt|fifee: rubensohl has its merits as well. there are combinations of both conventions around|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  unfortunate game to go down|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: or (at least) intended to reveal that later|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think South should lead low|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: actually that could be -- if 2@D absolutely shows @S support, then 2@H as a probe that may not have length does make sense|pg||
nt|sybarra2: yes but need partnership agreements for those|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c9|nt|vugrapha2: indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: until further notice all contracts are 50%|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they either make   ....   or they don't|pg||
nt|fifee: for sure as with any transfer responses|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with that combination, East may rise Ace to block suit when honours are split|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mwigor: alex might as well claim now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @C pitch by Liam|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|mwigor: he makes 9 tricks if north has @hA and 8 otherwise|pg||

pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: ooops  it's Michael this set|pg||
nt|noodle:  3@s will fare better than 2N that went -3 at other table|pg||

nt|sybarra2: so really Yeh Brothers (sponsors of this and other tourneys) team is ahead|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Sidney alerts 2 @H , but Patrick didn't.|pg||
nt|gambit: 3NT NS cold, but after E bold Michaels bid, VUL, who knows where they might have landed or how big the penalty wudl be, more than +430  tha is for sure|pg||
