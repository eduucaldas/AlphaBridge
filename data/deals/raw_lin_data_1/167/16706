nt|vugraphzys: yes, 16 x 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|othered1: Am I right that Heng Sha Ke Ji was the last qualifier from the round robin?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: no|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|3S|an|preemptive|nt|bjacobs: In fact they qualified 6th, but they WERE chosen by the team who qualified 1st|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: these two were 2nd and 6th|pg||
nt|othered1: OK, I see they were 6th of 8 qualifiers, but the leading qualilfier chose them as opponents for  the first match.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's so insulting to get "chosen" like that, but they had the last laugh|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is quite a challenging hand for E/W, because their 9-card heart fit is missing the 4 top cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the bulletins are also well worth a read|pg||
nt|othered1: I have had very little luck making single-suited negative doubles.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bjacobs: Well, now West has to perhaps bid his suit, and hope for the best.  The alternative is a preference back to 4@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps 4@D is better, then East can pattern out|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: Now West feels truly sick, but it looks like 5@D might survive|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This wasn't the right contrac,t but as you say Ed, it's such a big problem with those single-suited negative doubles|pg||
nt|othered1: Assuming you're not playing negative free bids (if west's h and would qualify) is it silly to pass and catch up later.  Admitted there may not be a later, but there really wasn't ...|pg||
nt|othered1: one here, either.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is why some pairs play "negative free bids", but they come with a whole set of problems of their own|pg||

nt|andyv:  Hello everyone.  Our operator is Murakami.|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d has some play for NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suspect EW play Precision|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  - ah, I didÂ´nt see the 9 of @H, important card |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that 1@C comfirms it|pg||
mb|d|nt|tejjyid: West adopts the iew that passing with a weak balanced hand is better than trying to fluke a partscore|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *view|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning - think we have the same weather in Norway Mark :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hackett finished 3rd in the Qualifying Swiss and chose Beijing Trinergy who finished 4th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in case of a tie, the higher qualifier wins [carryover of 0.5 imps]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL  5-8 HCP|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
nt|odysseus69: morning/afternoon/evening all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Whatever the first two bids mean, an auction thats seems destined to reach 3NT|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: Do we know NS's system?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway - a tuff start|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW belong in 3@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings: )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can EW even sniff at 4@H?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: as i play 4@D has to be ace (not king or singleton)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the Hacketts are father Paul and son Justin two fine English players|pg||
nt|caitlin: missing cold 4@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|saverio: 3NT available for EW here   but not easy to get there|pg||
nt|bobh1: apparently the second double is takeout|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a fair treatement if West's 1st pass doesn't show values|pg||
nt|sharkey: this appears to be a coffee hand - 11 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone guess what 3D is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Victor and J|pg||
nt|caitlin: Al 1@C Precision?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome Ellen and Al |pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep  both pairs using a  Strong 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other room using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Bulgarians favour 2C opening on balanced 18-20- a variation instead of Mexican 2D - |pg||
mb|5D|nt|bg: seems natural so far:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question will be can n/s stay out of game |pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Yes North canÂ´t be young, I played in at team with him in 1970...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Hans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Thks|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: If something lilke Precision, there would be questions about relative minor suit length, v what a double would show, etc.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont see what 5@C accomplishes but wont do any harm|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hi guys welcome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D is tough to beat --  i think it requires trump lead?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: Hello Ed |pg||
nt|caitlin: this is 1 of 4 segments of finals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now declarer can use both of dummy's @D to ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: still young at heart I expect|pg||
nt|sybarra2: interesting the hts crash|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  For sure he is|pg||
nt|chessmaste: If North's spade had been headed by the @S AK he would probaly have bid 4@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Nigel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D probably something bout minors????|pg||
nt|ahollan1: something like  ruff trick 1, @C @C @C ruff, @SA discard @H, @S ruff, @C ruff with Queen|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it may have asked about clubs and 5@D denied|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'b be happy ot pass 2@H as East; I've done enough, IMO, with a 4441|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but its so prime|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm not unsympathetic to the raise; but I expect West to be aggressive with say, 5 trumps & a black K|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and bid 3@H over the X|pg||
nt|caitlin: loses 2@H but has to ruff 2@C or finesse..can't ruff 2@C without losing @DJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  @H are 22 but is that best line  when only seeing 2 hands??|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sunil|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: i thought this was going to be a flat board till I saw the disaster in the open|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sort of minor canape|pg||
nt|caitlin: absolutely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in other room  lead was top @H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: of course easier from here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why i liked ruff trick 1|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: Mike you with us also?|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by both pairs -- for a moment i thought somebody would overbid here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not sure about overbidding as just about everything comes rolling home.|pg||
nt|othered1: After the "opening bid," EW weren't going to find the hopeless slam|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or maybe just clubs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: neatly done -- from N's perspective slam is on a finesse at worst|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: if u like|pg||
nt|xenya: true Jordan |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: or 5-4 either way in minors|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|othered1: declarer, in only 2@S here, doesn't have to look for miracle lies as he might if in game|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  this makes task easy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: the wrong board featured a possible slam, barring a spade lead -- here is another of the same kind -- 6@D is on on a non-heart lead |pg||

nt|bjacobs: South feels too strong for 2NT ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: We'll have to wait and see Ed, for a bad weak 2 to come along, but my guess is that they do|pg||
nt|bjacobs: N/S should be able to escape in 3@H from here|pg||
nt|vugraphzys: cc says so, 2@d is multi, bad weak two or big balanced.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Looks like North is going with his Lebensohl.  I wonder if they have discussed what happens when there is a redouble?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: All right, this is a pretty sensible auction all round|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, David!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: It could do quite well ... a lot might depend whether East switches to a diamond when he gets in with his @SA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|dburn: that might persuade West to shift to a diamond before East gets in with his @sA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: That looked like a @D signal to me and west did right by not honoring it.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well this is the key point ... East has to decide who has the diamond ace.  At the other table, East ducked|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and that ruined the defence|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Here East has successfully won @SA, and now has to follow it up with the diamond|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: But he took the same guess as at the other table - hoping @DK is an entry|pg||

nt|caitlin: with 9@H worth going for 2-2|pg||

mb|d!|mb|2S|nt|othered1: What's east's 1@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: From south's 2@C bid, I might infer it's a big @C|pg||

nt|bobh1: EW will make a game try...bid 3N and try to make it|pg||
nt|othered1: west apparantly denies 5@S if he passes over 1@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: regardless of strength?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3NT is the spot for E/W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Precision it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 1C either clubs or weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: might even land in wrong suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I can tell you the McGann in the OR is indeed in 3N and looks like making so it could be 1st blood to Hackett|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html  for standings and Daily Bulletins (scroll down in the column to the left)|pg||

nt|rmb1: What can South do: double?|pg||
nt|mamos: 2NT?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: and cant really fail a cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 6@D ? asks a kibitzer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - on this board?...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|saverio: NS could take 11 tricks in 5@d here     another "not easy to find" game  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd prefer 2@C over the X|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 8 easy tricks is a good start; usuallythe defence will provide one along the way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N may seem strong on HCP - but doubleton @H isn't carrying full weight -- and even so 11 opposite Precision 11-15  opening doesn't want to get too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: takeout DBL from South should let North compete in @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Justin Hackett opened the South hand with 1@S   -- EW never in the auction so 2@S South|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe 3NT now shows minors with long clubs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: double probably shows clubs and diamonds too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H from North now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i hope 2N is a scramble|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: 6@d should be off on a @s lead  even if it is a though lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Communications are not very good especially if defenders lead clubs, but 9 tricks shouldn't be a problem|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In their precision style that would be an overbid|pg||
nt|rmb1: on the basis the 3@S shows spades :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: NS will h ave another chance to take 7 top tricks.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: whew|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bg: it was 16+|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like a normal big @C auction, with 2@S showing a limited positive response.|pg||
nt|othered1: ty operator|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in the other room West raised to 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N made on 1 for 6 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Previous match was decided on a misunderstanding of a 4 NT bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Played 4 NT down 2 instead of 6@S making...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think 4NT is too much with no fit and East showing no encouragement|pg||
nt|odysseus69: betting he will bid slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hope so|pg||
nt|jcomyn: D the worry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South has shown extras - cant have much less than he has|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @D loses @S wins Q@C dies|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: goofy little hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: after A@c could be interesting if PO tries to sneak a spade he may may make|pg||
nt|othered1: in the OR, it was east who thought his hand worth initial action and opened 1@C, cheating his partner out of the chance to be first to bid.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i might be tempted to do so too.|pg||
nt|xenya: makes sense, considering the vulnerability |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with the west hand... 7 points in partners preemt might not produce a single trick|pg||
nt|xenya: putting maximum pressure on NS|pg||
nt|odysseus69: always right to make these decisions slowly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gold made 5@D after @H lead and @D shift|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bg: same result in other room on board 1|pg||
nt|othered1: the overcall does give west some useful information|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you prepared to bid 7 if opponents reach slam, because that often happens with these extreme preempts|pg||
nt|xenya: spades behave, in a sense, so declarer can get out for -1|pg||
nt|saverio: do you agree on S 3NT?    |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html   for Daily Bulletins (scroll down in the column to the left)|pg||

pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: Those bulletins are astounding, the eds/authors do a fantastic job|pg||
nt|lestergold: question of overtricks now|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely no tank here must be odds to play J or T @c|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well if they play 4NT and South leads a spade it is easy enough to score ten tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: IN OR, I guess west couldn't imagine a hand with no key cards.  Those who require a modicum of quality in the suits they open 2@C won't face that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: maybe was thinking of 7|pg||

nt|odysseus69: well done|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcwla: Will lead @DQ to preserve the opportunity to play S out of @D KT7.  Or won't.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: matched other room same spot|pg||

nt|odysseus69: Barry Rigal suggests that he might run this - should have led the king? - not that it matters as cards lie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unlikely I'd think|pg||

nt|lestergold: sorry i used to be a teahcer its just habit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mike is telling you to comment on the Go stand, in the corner|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth has shown an appreciation of the "soft" nature of his 16 count, but 'm not sure whathe can do about it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: mirrored shapes and marginal game values dont mix well|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if he bids it will west lead his fourth best from hismlongest and strongest the only lead to give 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that was a few decades ago|pg||
nt|lestergold: like 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@c probably bid to direct lead |pg||
nt|othered1: might have dissuaded west to only make a game try|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well timed, becasue nothing in the auction said the @C layout was like this|pg||
nt|othered1: but it is a vul game and you don't need to be bonded to try it (if the opponents don't look like the doubling kind)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if West has AQT, he would be greatly encouragesd on minimum values|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 8 yops|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tops|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hawe45:  Another good move from Hac-Hac|pg||

nt|tejjyid: OK, 4@D is a surprise|pg||
nt|lestergold: only in bidding comp migt gamke not be bid here|pg||
nt|sybarra: so likely to hear 1 nt  and we did|pg||
nt|odysseus69: needs heart lead to beat very lucky 3NT-or club lead and heart switch|pg||
nt|rmb1: "where there's eight there's nine" says those in 3NT-1|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice Robin|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: Bulgaria are 2nd and Hackett are 6th at this time|pg||
nt|sharkey: Carch all x - i have "something"?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is 2-way Checkback    2@D forced  2@S=5@S invitational|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: That's an effort you'd see in many duplicate clubs.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S may scramble to 6 tricks..I don't see a 7th if the defense is careful|pg||
nt|jcomyn: safety first|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NT by S guarantees @H lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right spot|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this may make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: the auction in the other room was completely different -- S chose to preempt in 1st seat|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@S is essentially on a heart finesse|pg||
nt|jcwla: I am not convinced by this.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rule of 11 tells W the whole story.|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, NS were lucky to remain oblivious of their spade fit|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|saverio: not easy to get to slam after 2@h/3@c/4@h...  a lot of space wasted and no more room to investigate|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OH, thy're certainly getting to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 4@d is systematic|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the double by W makes S hand worse, and NS not vul. but most wiould bid game even if appreciating the negative factors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S=too high|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess, comparer to what they might open on, south has a maximum . . . |pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: *Catch|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  When you have heart tolerance and clubs and nothing much in their suit, it will usually be best to compete I think|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It is much harder for North even with quite a good hand unless they have extra shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  and this may be the 7th|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tejjyid: I guess, that's why it took so long to find.  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: 6 LTC + 8.5 LTC means larginal for game even apart from the mirror|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South *might* have passed 2@S NV< but once not, no way to stop|pg||
nt|bobh1: actually no way to misdefend|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is a difficult double dummy problem i ndeed to imagine a scenario where EW could let it make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well North was very max for his 2@s and south was sub min for 2N|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If they routinely make single raises with 16 HCP, South is pretty much compelled to try will 9+|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all. Sry am a bit late|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Sunil.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if South was allowed to rebid 2@S instead of 1N|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: could be primitive Stayman, with 2@S invitational|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|vugraphzys: east explained so.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@C is a puppet to 2@D, then you can invite with a 4+ card major|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but if North wins the ace and returns a low heart (not the nine), there may be problems with trump control|pg||

nt|caitlin: lost @D @S 2@C other table--did not need to lose @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: decieving j of spade switch from W |pg||
nt|othered1: If he doesn't give declarer a losing option he can't beat the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will probably 4th push in 6 boards -- but on the other 2, Hackett scored 10 & 9|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: on this one EW miss a good game|pg||
nt|bobh1: in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: so that East "should have" the jack 60% of the time|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very nice defence...|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: frisky 3@S vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Credit to Shenzhen for steering to 3NT but on this layout nothing matters, coffee time.|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: 3NT in OR: 600|pg||

nt|lestergold: was making|pg||
nt|tejjyid: those "air" quotes are very useful|pg||
nt|dburn: at least, so declarer thought, and right he was|pg||
nt|chessmaste: On the previous deal there was a case for South to double 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hello again |pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: original precision would bid 2@H/3@H    but in these days of 2/1 Game Force  it's 1N|pg||
nt|rmb1: taking no prisoners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: south's sequence shows LONGER @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 5@S & 5@H the opening bid is 1@H|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chilloncan: 3H?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm for 3@H|pg||

nt|sybarra: W checking cards to see if same deck with transfer to clubs |pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door declarer won spade ace at trick 1 and played on clubs - Bulgarian declarer did better by ducking at trick 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bobh1: 3@D very conservative|pg||
nt|bobh1: i don't think its forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when playing SemiForcing 1N    opener will pass with 11-12 HCP and 5332|pg||
nt|andyv:  courageous 1@h bid on that suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so lucky with dummy|pg||

mb|d|nt|caitlin: how can it be right in open room to lead @SJ,,,,,,,he has 15 HCP, pd can't help|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: similar auction up to this point |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I'd rather bid 2@D the 1st time|pg||
nt|andyv:  Paul had to put on the brakes|pg||
nt|xenya: not really, Andy -- with anything better Justin would have opened :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  then what was purpose of 2@d bid by Paul?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: me, too|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe - how many diamonds did 1@d show?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm thinking as amany as 2@H...|pg||
nt|xenya: in fact that helped them to stay low|pg||
nt|andyv:  to tell the opps he had a good hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: oh just in case|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Carl Mathiesen|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Carl.|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Carl|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@C was a super-accept, EAst a little conservative|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chessmaste: Which is what happened at the other table|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has a clear cut @H lead so this shud be down fast|pg||
nt|rodal f: Got told a lot by that lead|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|pelu: not so easy after @CQ to K - endplay on @S9 in OR to give yhe 9. triock on @HK|pg||
nt|bg: a club lead will make this hand touchy to play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might get home by leading low heart towards jack (with a good guess)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but, even if only 3, I'd still try for 2@D. Opposite precision, OK, no, I wouldn't|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, so you might bid 2@s the second time - that ought to be 4-4 in the red suits, maybe|pg||
nt|othered1: How can you beat the hand if you don't do something like that to lead declarer away from the normal, winning line?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it is a matter of style and I'm sure they know each other's much better than we do|pg||
nt|xenya: and 8 tricks seems to be the limit?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: but 4-1 in diamonds...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes and suit blocked so added problem|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|chilloncan: very instructiuve hand....if S thought his hand merited 3H, why not right away?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3@s fortuantely is not conservative altho west only has 10 high card points the playing potential of his hand is enormous with @d fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: it ws a very imaginative defence and induced declarer to go wrong|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: Kept NS, with the majority of CHP out of the auction, but missed their own good game.  Fair trade?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W has a great hand after 3D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: the @H hook will be good news|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes W bid a lot with his ten count|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to do from qx|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if that's the treatment, then X followed by 2@S is OK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: HCP rather|pg||
nt|bg: bergen users would love this hand W not likely to pass under 4 spades if he knows pard has 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not understand open room auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I think after the XX,  3 @D is forcing|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: Yang found @CQ lead|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|bg: with the club lead there is not much choice but to cash dia K and hope spade Q is an entry|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy to find spade next? |pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  you finesse for the 10@h against W?|pg||
nt|rodal f: My fist would been a @H at trick 2|pg||

nt|ahollan1: everthing comes down to @DK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|xenya: yes, good idea|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bobh1: apparently that's what they think also|pg||
nt|othered1: If you have to bid 1N on north hand and it can be passed, you're putting randomizing your result.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: with the X do you think it drops singleton?|pg||

nt|othered1: I rarely play against semiforcing NT, so I don't see it often|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S-3@H natural invite|pg||

pc|c6|nt|tejjyid: 6@C a bit unlucky|pg||

nt|rmb1: Open room avoid 4@SX on  22 by defending 4@HX-3 for more 800s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: at love all there is less % in pushing opponents around when you know everything is breaking |pg||
pc|c5|nt|blum1956:  extremely conservative 2@s by Bakshi - and this helps his side to stop off the game|pg||

nt|chessmaste: I confess I would have risked the @C A as East |pg||
nt|othered1: I guess south seems something attractive about leading their suit, not the unbid . .. |pg||

nt|mamos: lol  being nude :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sunsamvar: @D now|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks pretty hopeless|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not attractive to play for 3-1 spades since it wont be possible to take heart finesse |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||

pc|h3|nt|dburn: he doesn't have to lead one to trick one, of course, but the defenders may find it hard to shift to the suit later|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The idea behind Muppet Stayman is to allow responder to show 5 spades, 4 hearts, AND for the strong hand to always be declarer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So for example here, after 3@H, 3NT shows 5 spades, 4 hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You might ask ... what does opener respond with 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Answer: 3NT ... then responder can transfer back to 4@H if he likes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: when did it change from Puppet to Muppet?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: indeed Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: at what levels does he have natural @H bids (or transfers)?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their jump bids are 3-way   a) weak in that suit  b) weak in next higher suit  c) 3-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: off we go|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5/5 majors for dealer pass|pg||
nt|dburn: what should South do?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@H|pg||
nt|othered1: pass and maybe jump in @H later|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hackett would be ok if this were a BAM|pg||
nt|xenya: some might open 1@S as W on the previous hand|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|hawe45:  Coffee board|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: E a 1@C0 16 + stron any hand |pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: is this a funky flannery? or ??|pg||
nt|bg: aggressive start not recommended unless you have plenty of time for discuusions|pg||
nt|sybarra: other option is majors,  less than opening  |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: agresive 3@D block Nvul fron S|pg||
nt|chilloncan: scoreboard insufficiently blood-flecked|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the @C holding is insurance|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h will work, but I don't understand it at all|pg||
nt|dburn: if it isn't forcing, then I almost understand it, but...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: King may have asked for unblock|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vul   how weak can 3@H really be?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can s prevent w fromn showing majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+  and possible canape -- 3rd seat means HCP don't really matter :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and a canape into clubs coming|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|tejjyid: stuck because I don't want to pass out 2@S X'ed, or bid 4@H over the top of it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Opportunity for Shenzhen here|pg||
nt|sybarra: too late for coffee can we have a glass of wine instead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer advance from W|pg||
nt|othered1: he seems to h ave none of the above, as it's not weak with those black cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: X= negative 8+|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  is this systemic?|pg||
nt|lestergold: east passing a perfectly respectable 12 count?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bg: 6 clubs reached in other room|pg||

mb|3N|nt|xenya: that reminds me...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The wrong 4|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3nt E end contract|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E seems to have passed a hand vastly better than the one he opened a minute ago, and vul both times|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: South must be thinking of Slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW being shut out here despite 23 HCP between them|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: E let him go|pg||
nt|pelu: operator are u sure 2NT by S or by West?|pg||
nt|dburn: you can't afford to be predictable|pg||
nt|chilloncan: probably he hates opening 1D with nothing there|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we have a club player who always passes opening bids but do not expect to see it at this level|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 6@C is a fine spot and not automatic to find with this competition|pg||
nt|othered1: was double forced?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ok here we are|pg||
nt|dburn: South at the other table bid a forcing 2@h, which worked rather well|pg||
nt|dburn: North at this table didn't do enough bidding - after all, he could make a slam facing six hearts to the king-jack and zip|pg||
nt|tejjyid: exactly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't remember if original precision defined DBL as 5-8 HCP versus 3-level interference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe it was Negative ??|pg||
nt|othered1: with a friendlier trump break and a @H lead, this might make on a good day|pg||
nt|andyv:  too bad that 4@h had no play|pg||
nt|rodal f: N have good cards now after the pass at 2NT.|pg||
nt|andyv:  (unless @d was led)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Heng Sha gain on  24 when opponents don't bid game, match almost tied|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP just needs to guess the minor suit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: and then I am lost after that|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or even lead spade and have Vehees hope for the best with club switch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's still time from South|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bg: another 12 imps if he makes Taipei off 100 in 4 H|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H only down 1 after lead of @DQ to ruff in N|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to be club return,    this gets tricky |pg||
nt|jcwla: Oopsie.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: his hand is too good.. but :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming game force -- not an unreasonable guess from South|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: hello there|pg||
nt|sybarra: bjr henri @H |pg||
nt|bg: Hi Henri|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a 5@H bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps defending is the winning option here|pg||
nt|othered1: Then he's forcing the 5-level over a rather likely 4@D.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: looking for 9 tricks in East hand , 2@D/4@C/1@S/2@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  If S was going to bid up to 4@s, why not just bid 4@s immediately?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: easy if @C back: 5 @H-tricks (after the opening in N) 2@c+2@D|pg||
nt|xenya: something has gone very wrong here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: easy 9 tricks now - tough to avoid heart lead after 2H bid|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: given the bidding,  and this lead,  declarer gets a bunch of ht tricks now|pg||
nt|pelu: yes @C to Q ( or even A and Q)|pg||
nt|ritong: if north has the 5 @hs promised, nothin bad can happen|pg||
nt|ritong: @s are locked|pg||
nt|chilloncan: welcome dburn, prince of the unpreditable. nobody expects the spanish inquisition|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there really is no falsecard from West that will hide his holding|pg||
nt|sybarra2: thia |pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: could be big swing here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: spades are, but declarer doesnt know that |pg||
nt|ritong: he does|pg||
nt|ritong: he held 108|pg||
nt|bg: "the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain"|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree with Justin's bidding -- once you elect to overcall with 1@S you are practically forced to bid 4 later cat these colours |pg||
nt|sybarra2: this should work|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: so what does S pitch on all the hts coming?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough hand call for South -- so Hanlon's choice of 3@H did it's job in that respect|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|xenya: *at, not "cat"|pg||
nt|rodal f: U can ask. Same as. Why didn't N support|pg||
nt|xenya: bad hand |pg||
pc|c8|nt|ritong: so there is no layout losing three @s tricks directly|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I don't think 4@s can make but maybe 4@h might|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm with Edgar Kaplan, as quoted in today's bulleting - there should be a fractional imp charge for every bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told, 2C = XYZ inv checkback,  but interesting we are not in spades|pg||
nt|tejjyid: That  would make for shorter auctions...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: oops...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West is close to a 2@h overcall even after South's 1@h|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would do it if not vulnerable|pg||
nt|chessmaste: We should credit South for responding 1@H rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|chessmaste: MAFIA style|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sunsamvar: and the North pass has cost Shenzhen 22 imps.. lose 11 instead of gaining 11|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|tejjyid: does 2@H show the @C suit?|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Bulgaria have hit the lead after making 5@d on 24 at the other table|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@H always less than game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  N/S in game|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if so, why no 3@C from West?|pg||
nt|sybarra: thus agreeing|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Hardly... - but much can happen|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1@H/2@D from E is non forcing West has no much passed out |pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's not so blue - a low @S isn't 100% the consensus lead from NOrth|pg||
nt|tejjyid: itmight have kept out the @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assume 2@H relay to 2@S?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 6nt best to protect the @Sk|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@H confirmimg @H suit|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4 or more quick tricks and 4 or fewer losers, 2@C the opening and slam within sight - would be huge not to give Shenzhen a gain here after getting to this slam.|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: still, we're only arguing about 1 imp eitehrway I suppose|pg||

nt|jcomyn: yes indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: crunch time|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well it's just looking at all the cards that make stepping in easy |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 7 @D and 2 aces?  spades are blocked arent they?   and k of spades natural lead |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the higher ranked team from the qualifying Swiss has a carryover of 0.5 imps to act as tiebreaker|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: i think 2N is game try with exactly 4@H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this is a pesky 4/1 break |pg||
nt|sybarra2: can he handle it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not to mention the pesky duplicated shape or pesky lack of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra2: true|pg||
nt|sybarra2: its the miror hand that really makes it messy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  But even minus 2 is a big result|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Best slam is 6@C by West|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true Roland but East has opened 2@C :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: Not West's fault|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to see the battle of Britain. A gold missed?|pg||

nt|sharkey: What is 6@C?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: I like that|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bg: all depends on how David handles 10 trumps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was 4@C nat or control ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure - East must know  the Grand is not in the picture|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D may be controls...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @S?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  NO comments|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h6|nt|sunsamvar: 6@C does not require @Hq and so superior... but will lose imps |pg||
nt|sharkey: East is looking at @HQ...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or @H break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe another round of @H first|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  E having the 10@c and the A of @hs and all suits behaving|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  West has the setting trick...|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|dburn: I don't think anyone would actually lead low, but credit to the defender at the other table who did not overtake partner's ten|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C forcing -- in this case 11-13 BAL  [could be any 17+ HCP]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = 4+@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: nice quick auction|pg||
nt|dburn: and thereby saved an overtrick, gnashing his teeth the while|pg||

nt|chilloncan: hit because you ahve to discover the sorting error iat exactly the right moment'|pg||
nt|sharkey: and won't make either|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Aah - the dreaded support double - one of the 25 conventions you don't need to know|pg||
nt|rodal f: As seen before S can be at 4@S and 2@C a ask|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c showed 8-11 hcp|pg||
nt|blum1956:  they have a beautiful option to double 2@h now (one down )|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would be scary|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C explained as natural GF or something else -- here it is the former|pg||
nt|blum1956:  anyway North must probably double to show GF|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: There is theoretical meritin underleading 3 consecutive honours - but from a 6 card suit, it's pretty tough to do|pg||

nt|chilloncan: statistical result to practical application. rthe donwside of faulure is to gruesome to make the bet|pg||
nt|andyv:  lots of things can go wrong on this one for the defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D natural and forcing    unclear which red suit longer|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and they land  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and another foul split in trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Liu Haitao has reached same end postion in 4@H on board 10|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: and with east having both red entries, the board will tie at 400|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right - partnership morale has to be taken into consideraton, & when it goes wrong, it is usually ugly|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose you could take the view that if partner doesn't have the ace, declarer will make the contract anyway, but...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I'm 1@H|pg||
nt|xenya: not me|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is the hand where as W if you are playing 2/1 and hear 1NT forcing by pd over 1@H you are consigned to rebid 2@C...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcwla: Both E's passed over 1@H-1@S, would anyone have done anything different?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that is why i wd consider the 1 nt opening Jordan|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: doesns't look like a spinter to me.  too many possible tricks in @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: the lead=I have more @D's in my hand than you do in both hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: McGann's PASS denied 3+@H  [support double would apply]|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice guess of trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: at the table you would not do it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: partnership is not the worst of it. teammates and captain are almost surely going to take a dimmer view still|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thre was a 1980's BW article on this, and I saw Srere do it from KQJx once|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *Seres|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think support doubles are ok but should not be mandatory - I would bid 1NT on this South hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 10, S bid directly to 4@s and didn't get dbld, so 2 more imps for the NEDUK team|pg||
nt|andyv:  what do you shift to?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: going all out this could make 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: presuming east short in @cs, declarer should tackjle trumps the right way|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: But what makes you think you make 3NT if you bid it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that should be 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|xenya: @D?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: ...it would be rather hard to justify that view if declarer's @s10 from A10 doubleton were his ninth trick|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Very odd - the king of clubs was obvious|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: you wont - unless you peeked...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 back to level the scores time is running out|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: The players don't have the hand records|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer still has only six tricks|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Six is better than five|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  South maybe expecting partner to have a singleton club when West bid NT and North didn't lead them|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, that proves the point ,,,,sere, he did it under an assumed name:):)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But I agree a club does look best|pg||
pc|h3|nt|blum1956:  Clearly North cannot have a singleton spade - he would have returned one in trick 2|pg||
nt|blum1956:  2 off if South overruffs and returns a trump|pg||
nt|xenya: E can duck this endplaying S|pg||
nt|rodal f: They have there meanings. Opening major by 4-4ma/mi so now it was a longer @S than 4. X for reopen is OK, but what id S had 6@S - 2@H  - 2@D - 3@C? In troubble? Well it wourks:)|pg||

nt|sharkey: :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If you play with result merchants David, only one thing works|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As North I would expect partner to usually have 3 or 4 spades given the bidding so at most three diamonds|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kiwibridge: ugly ugly contract|pg||

nt|andyv:  any good contract for either side?|pg||
nt|xenya: and +100 on 11 doesn't seem too bad either|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like the big @C forces a 2@C opening on west's hand, a weak spot in bid @C systems.|pg||

nt|rmb1: 3@D splinter ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably a full shape description|pg||
nt|jcomyn: prefer 2h here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe pass now and 3NT from North to show d honour|pg||
nt|rmb1: Needs to find out about @DK singleton for 3NT|pg||
nt|rmb1: Running out of room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that 3d took up a lot of space|pg||
nt|odysseus69: pass and redouble are extras from oppo|pg||
nt|rmb1: Perhaps can gain some room by using the double:  Pass or XX ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed relay takes advantage of such doubles|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i think he has to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South worried (wrongly) that pass might suggest playing in 3dX (redouble would)|pg||
mb|5N|nt|chilloncan: not sure why 2S appeals, with playability in both majors and only suit announced by opps is clubs|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 2D i mean|pg||
nt|dburn: well, look at the result|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 imps|pg||
nt|dburn: if he'd bid only 1@d, South would maybe have had some chance to bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think North has been a little conservative not X'ing on the 2nd round|pg||
nt|othered1: There's a case to bid with both hands.  I double on north's hand either my first or second at bat.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: also, South might balance - I'm sympatheticto the 1st pass by South, with the soft cards & misfit, but defending 2@D won't be much fun|pg||
nt|lestergold: it shouold be now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North has shown 5-4-1-3 but suit qualities etc still unknown|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooh er|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2N looks reasonable at this point|pg||
nt|othered1: if east reopens with a double are you allowed to pass as west?|pg||

nt|rmb1: Can beat 5@H by lead diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that pass from East is pusilanimous|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|chilloncan: yes, hand short in their suit must act, even if a bit under strength|pg||
nt|tejjyid: needs an iron will to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: East Passed the x in OR|pg||
nt|rmb1: 5@C psychic cue bid ?:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that the right spelling victor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least i don't think doubleton spoils the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now what?   3@D  4@D   3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but maybe he was just trying to minimise his losses|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd have played the @Hq trying to pin the 10 or 8... but the lack of entries to dummy wd had led to him laying down the Ace|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: meanwhile we have a thin vul game here.|pg||
nt|xenya: i really don't see where N found the 4@H bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he has to hope for all minor suit honours with Li|pg||
nt|dburn: would rather bid 2@s than have it go 2@h-pass-4@h-pass-pass-headache|pg||
nt|lestergold: south likes it too much to double|pg||
nt|othered1: well, pass of 1@H by south hand isn't something everyone would choose, either|pg||
nt|caitlin: with 6-5|pg||
nt|sybarra: more importantly with an Ace|pg||
nt|caitlin: indeed:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: but 6-5 with Ace!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: opposite an 11-15 opening there's not the same pressure to keep the auction open|pg||
nt|rmb1: I hope so, that is Victor's fourth attempt|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: IN OR NS fast in 4@S and now west i playing 5@h|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit high|pg||
nt|ritong: as was 4@s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but where did S find the Double?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: on the information South has so far, the hand is a misfit &they have less than 1/2 the deck|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: right   too much to X |pg||
nt|tejjyid: drawing to a close - KISS started slowly but picked up momentum after a while|pg||
nt|andyv:  hands don't fit well together...4@h will end it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Kovachev not play fast arrival by passed pard?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: 12 boards played this is only third part score! |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: which is a bit like life really....|pg||
nt|tejjyid: from the long dealy, you can assume PO won the 1st trick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *elay|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *delay|pg||
nt|rodal f: CR at 11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i admit -- i didn't think about 3N|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: difficult lead for north|pg||
nt|lestergold: and lead lets it thru|pg||
nt|sybarra: putting finger on a spade and this could have been ugly|pg||
nt|lestergold: what an evil hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: it plays very well seeing all 52 cards -- Peng will have to think though|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: 4. best - very easy :)|pg||
nt|ritong: bakhshi can see that contract is cold with @hs 3/2, so he has to work out something if this is not the case|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade takes it 3 off|pg||
nt|caitlin: lucky singleton @H where @SA is|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he wasn't sure the auction would end if he doubled - maybe he would get to double 4@s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: absolutely|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe they wopuil;d play in clubs which is rather hard tol double|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I would have bid 3 hts on the get go with S hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: As we see this is a make with S having Kx in @C......|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: noone wants to play a suit.. so trumps may be continued :0|pg||
nt|sharkey: Bridge is easy when we get to look at all four hands :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: There's a lot to be said for NOT leading a Q@H though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: WE know @DK is in south and @S 3-2   he doesn't|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|andyv:  9 imps to Hackett on 11|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3H could be good news bad news...might kep them out, but might turn plus into minus|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees wants to knock out both of dummy's minor cards|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: The name of the game at IMPs today is "bid them up"|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: even k of clubs might have worked|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcomyn: very odd might have plasyed in 4s|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: well. S has support in all the unbid suits -- sort of|pg||
nt|chilloncan: always hard to know what to do with those|pg||
nt|lestergold: i vote for 3@h|pg||
nt|xenya: as E is short of entries |pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: McGann needed to duck the opening lead  --   but is that obvious?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and can declarer counter by ducking too??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute  if he does  then Hanlon leads @SJ and again McGann ducks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: in which position?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and let opps get on with it...|pg||
nt|lestergold: south raising to 3@h|pg||
nt|xenya: the correct line is not clear however|pg||
nt|sybarra: *would work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a weird race it would have been|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: @CKx may be the "only chance"|pg||
nt|xenya: but i'm not sure about board 12 Andy -- N can hardly fail to overcall. and after that 2@SX is quite likely   |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard did open red, with 2 hts,   he cant be totally broke|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|othered1: it's wrong only if you think you're giving declarer exactly his 9th trick.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  did N have to bid 2@s?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2 rounds @H then try to ruff a @S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thanks all for coming|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thanks operator & NEC|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: 5@Hs was down 2 so a +board for NEDUK|pg||
nt|othered1: even fewer part scores in the OR|pg||
nt|xenya: to finesse clubs twice |pg||
nt|lestergold: well had south bid a spade e/w would not be chalking up a game|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: for this reason, i would have played a @c at trick 2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i was taught that to dbl 1@S you need a bit more :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: We'd like to thank our great operator Murakami, Saverio Hans and James for their commentaries, Akito Omasa of the JCBL and NEC for their great sponsorship|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s4|nt|othered1: That's where I came in  :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to duck this |pg||
nt|rmb1: In open room NS pushed into 5@S-1|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: well what a ping pong ofn errors on this hand in bidding and play|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: declarer's play makes sense -- he goes down only if S does have Kx in clubs|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: when you have 2 honours in front of you, cover is the rule..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so i guess Li shd have put up the @Ck|pg||
nt|othered1: bettter play @C back now or declarer would make 6 on squeeze|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  12  China only reached 6@H|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed not, but if it turns out that the opponents don't have much distribution, chilloncan is right - you might just go -100 instead of +110 for no reason|pg||
mc|9|nt|kiwibridge: BBO and Roland Wald and especially the audience for their great feedback|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Last deal in this room|pg||

nt|caitlin: nice pick up for Oz 2|pg||
nt|othered1: It's gotten a bit too late for me, and I'|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 600 is surely a good result  but with only 4 boards to score Beijing needs to hope it isn't a push|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm going to retire.  Thanks operator for a terrific job.  thanks Al and specs and bye|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and it isn't     Beijing declaring 2@S in the other room |pg||
nt|xenya: over 1N? Yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks liek a flat one again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he'll wonder why he bid 5@C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East got lucky  here - 5H was a standout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 3@S cue from South  Bakhshi bid 4@C  which made things a bit more difficult|pg||
nt|caitlin: The Dutch here are carrying the Dutch in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we are due back in about 20 min |pg||

nt|bg: 4spades 6 spades?? can W find a club?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - sleepy defence and no swing|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and if they do have something, 3H might get you +140 instead of  +300 or so|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm not sure what E was going to do if 1NT was passed to him (probably dbl, and then what?).|pg||
nt|rodal f: Comes for CR now Vlad.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 2-way forcing 1@C |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: last board and W in the OR is in 3N|pg||

nt|jcwla: my keen and insightful co-commentators, Vladimir Ivanov, Sunil Varghese, and Carl Mathiesen.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks also to all kibs.|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 2@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW 4@C|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT has a chance if you can get there without letting North bid hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 3...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Provided the defenders lead hearts at some point 3NT would be doomed - and so might 1NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  in CR, N bid 2@s immediately and got dbld so result may be a push|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D might conclude|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Roland well that looks conclusive NEDUK a huge set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 14-poor 17|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 0-7 or 22+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guess which partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: s|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C probably majors?|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H longer than @S according Alert?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=17-19 HCP|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  27 nobody bid @H or @S in open room, South declared 3NT+1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: last hand of the set now |pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is the way the world ends...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@S clearly minors|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D or 3@C shud be ok|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ended same 2@SX|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess I'm too old fashioned.. the vul would slow me down with the N hand.. 1@s and I'm done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a game in every hand      in college we had convention card that used that as general description of our system|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sunsamvar: and hard to believe that Yamada discarded @S instead of @C on the 3rd @D|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: that was the last board -- thanks everyone|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx all specs for watching... was an entertaining session.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and thanks to the organisers of this fine tourney|pg||
nt|chilloncan: passing 1D s definitely a wimper, but TS|pg||
nt|xenya: or even plus Hackett|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: my pards never put down that good a hand has N has|pg||
nt|sybarra: guess I need to find new pards |pg||
nt|ahollan1: coward :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  pd's 1NT showed @hs, which I have stiff|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: we hope to have tables linked next set |pg||

nt|sybarra: estimating imp score Bruce?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 70 to 33? or so |pg||
nt|ritong: you mean that john's wife always tables some goodies to cater with his er...adventurous bids?:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 68 to 33  I am told|pg||
nt|bg: It is her secret some wives use the kitchen|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: next:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: back in 20 min all |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well .... even this may be OK|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sharkey: Easier with all hands in view....|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I wonder if the explanation to East was correct? Pass of 2@S is very odd otherwise|pg||
nt|andyv:  oh well, it worked:)|pg||
nt|xenya: *for Hackett|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcwla: Maybe 2NT by N as pick a minor instead of 3@C.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice 2N bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to see 11imps on this hand so it looks like Heng Sha v NEDUK in final|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: sure wish we knew what South's DBL meant  - that could help explain McGann's failure to show 5@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Beijing picked up 9 imps on 29  [in the other room 2@S -200]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 28 imps with 3 to play|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our terrific operator Murakami |pg||
nt|ahollan1: after the Quarter Finals end   there is a longish break before the 32 board Semi-Finals begins|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile the lovely contract of 4@c has been reached here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bid bader than here. 1@H - 2@S - P - P - X. At vul?|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d shift will seal the fate of this contract|pg||
nt|blum1956:  the @d switch looks obvious|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: oops   we [and i bet Zhengjun] thought 2N was a scramble for minor suit|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: ah but we have 2 more to go|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry UK in other room--apologies|pg||

pc|c4|nt|sybarra: and thx commentators,   always fun |pg||
nt|Walddk4: We will be back in half an hour with a match from the last round of the qualifying|pg||
nt|blum1956:  not that!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sunsamvar: hanks Jordan and all.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I'm not sure about 2@s when you can also bid 2NT|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still, if he knows North has four spades he should make it easily |pg||
nt|andyv:  Paul escaped|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room after Precision 1@C opening from East  NS never bid   Wang in 2@S West|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: we are back in about 40 min |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|heyrocky:  Thanks very much to Ed and Bruce for their insights during this session. I think the next session starts in about 1 hour and 20 minutes.|pg||

nt|tejjyid: bye all, thx for comments & feedback|pg||

pc|s2|nt|jcwla: The t/o x makes the 2-2 split totally expected and it's all peaches and cream here for decl.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But it would be strange for 2@s to be natural when West didn't transfer and spades are on his left|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest11/nec.html  for standings after round 10|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: good job escaping|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but vulnerable will end up costing more than EW game|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: in the other room  Justin Hackett in South sat for 1@SX|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: nice lead!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1 more trump allows defense to score 4@D tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: this works too -- if they don't compress @D tricks [i think]|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|othered1: This is close to a 4 or 6 hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx also to specs,  we appreciate the info and comments |pg||
nt|tejjyid: gee, I hate playign 4@D as a @H transfer here...because it make 4@H a @S transfer|pg||
nt|caitlin: next 1/4 final session about 40 minutes  10:35 NY Eastern Standard|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course thx to NEC for bringing this tourney to bbo.  (think is for 7th year)|pg||
nt|caitlin: last 1/4 final|pg||
nt|othered1: but with the 2N, slam-killer auction, they won't investigate it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and I have seen an awful lot of non-natural 4@H calls passed out/misunderstood|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and you the audience for your great feedback, thank you @H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: big 1@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: South certainly changes things here.|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if pass showed extras in fit or overall values|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: negative1@D|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: thanks to our operator  Nobuyuki Hayashi -- very nice job|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: yikes|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's all happening|pg||
nt|petergill: en route to 6@D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C Drury [i assume]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and BBO and Roland for organising|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|blum1956:  strange lead by Justin|pg||
nt|andyv:  another 3N opener...2 in the same match.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction seems to call from trump lead :(|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: bet we are off to 6 @D in this room |pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems flawed for East to become declarer in @H  --  but  NS aren't finished|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|othered1: how badly will 6@CX be hurt if declarer takes some right views?|pg||
nt|caitlin: and it's so close to br swinging now|pg||
nt|othered1: =rather 6@DX|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|tejjyid: trading trmp loser for @C ruff, so not much in it, Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like -300 if south sees things right|pg||
nt|andyv:  strange or not, it's effective|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  and this time Paul didn't dbl 4@d:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the All Stars had a great qualifying and may feel a little hard done by, but still a great effort|pg||
nt|rmb1: Final starts at 01:00 GMT 02:00 CET (and at sensible times in the Pacific rim)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer might get out for 300 if he sets up spades|pg||
nt|tejjyid: guess the @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to guess the @D also |pg||
nt|tejjyid: not so hard|pg||
nt|caitlin: W opened 2N.....|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry yes after 2 @D easy|pg||
nt|petergill: If West passes 6@D to East who bids 6@H, I think South would have bid 7@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a low @D best now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Been a lot privat chats with u specs, lovly and hopefully some advices:) Tkx to my co commentators. Well done to:) But the best is always the vug operator. Nice work. Su u all back ...|pg||
nt|rodal f: by Roland and BBOs nice work + federations around the earth.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room after East opened  "multi" 2@D|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|petergill: Yes, a low diamond reduces the entries to dummy to set up spades - wd Nabil Edgtton|pg||
nt|othered1: If west's first pass showed extras, I don't think he has a second pass, but it's close|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye all|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well done all of u for the bridge hobby:)|pg||
nt|blum1956:  thanks all|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kiwibridge: other semi Hackett looked to be cruising at half time, then got a rude shock it seems|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: @CA because West cannot tell that East has @SQ.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I think the losers share 3rd place no playoff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1400 open room 200 here great audience|pg||
mc|8|nt|othered1: west took his 300 before the mice got at it and turned it into 100|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room playing 1N on the hand where Verhees bid and made 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NEDUK has had an excellent set and the score will reflect that|pg||
