nt|vugraphzxf: live ticker with previous results at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Open-Quali-2012-1/12_01_20_team.html|pg||
nt|riccho: a disciplined non-opener by E|pg||
nt|riccho: modern expert bridge tend to open WK2 even with a 4card MAJ at the side|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: dbl explained as clubs, but might as well be t/o with this hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: 2@d is w2 @h or strong @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: team jokisch has been performing well below everyone's expectation so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Thanks Michael and hello :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: looks to me like losing a club, 2 hearts, 2 spades, and have to find the @DQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: we have very silly alert rules here in germany, unfortunately...|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: hello everyone, welcome back to the german trials|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: i wonder whether dbl = @d is really useful against this convention|pg||
nt|riccho: this is not very clever: not to open WK2, but then in a retard fashion denying the 4c@h suit as well |pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: of course, it makes for an easier metarule|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: let's hope they had a good night's sleep|pg||

nt|riccho: but look at the effect of an 2@s opening: ppp seems probable|pg||
nt|riccho: the strength of the @h fit lies in the fact, that no one can really make a take-out dbl|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: then again, i've seen smirnov but not piekarek, so maybe he hasn't arrived yet|pg||
nt|penseur9: well with 8 rounds might be watching opps|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: personally i would have rated team jokisch as their toughest competition|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strong version of 1@C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 0-6|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: smirnov and ellerbeck having fun making a big deal alerting 1@c to each other, both playing similar system :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|vugraphzxf: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Open-Quali-2012-1/12_01_20_team.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|penseur9: ;ooks like a take out double|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: e has just shown a 12-14 nt with no 4card heart support, so should be t/o of hearts yes|pg||
nt|penseur9: but what can S bid here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: south in a very inconvenient spot now|pg||
nt|penseur9: very|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is a good contract for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: piek showing very good hand with this sequence, but still not enough to game force|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: absolute gf would have been 3@d?|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ahollan1: 3@D at some point -- or maybe DBL then 3@S??|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: piekarek immediately "that's impossible, it can't be! this is a new kind of bridge!" as the tray comes back|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: here some people play immediate 3@h would not be invitational, to prevent opps from getting back in the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: this double could cost a lot|pg||
nt|penseur9: I only see 5 tricks here|pg||
nt|penseur9: as someone said... I did not like the x in the first place. 3 aces and nothing, and opps opened with 1nt and responded|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: well, i only see 5 tricks for both sides... i expect this board will take a while to play!|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: drawing all the trumps, ellerbeck keeps @hQxx though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps 3nt instead of 2@s from E?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: 3N sure seems like reasonable shot at some point |pg||

nt|ahollan1: don't adjust your sets   you've just entered the twilight zone???|pg||

nt|penseur9: very|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: yes daehr immediately asking why no suppX as dummy comes down|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: of course for south bidding is less attractive when he expects east to not have 3 hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or was that   the outer limits|pg||
nt|ralfwil: dbl from N for  a @h lead?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|bernix:  east has a very minimum opener. i have sympathy for passing|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: there was quite some discussion about that yesterday|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: originally there was to be a round robin of the top 4 and then a final|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: like the first 4 will go on to the next round?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: current plan is apparently to draw a ko between the top 4, but many contestants are unhappy with no advantage for 1st place this weekend|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: yes the first 4 will get through that is pretty much clear|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or play a semifinal, first can pick his opponent, that is about as fair as can be|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzxf: yes several suggested that|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: an expensive savetry by S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: and he's missing a big tournament there this week -- all for THIS|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: its hard to see any team but jamm making the qualification to the national team|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: has @dJ caused jokisch to misread the trump position?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: it has|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: well, if any team can give jamm a run for their money, it will be von alvensleben|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: gunther-schlicker are dominating the butler ranking in this event|pg||

mb|4C!|an|!c or !h preempt|nt|janhamhurg: nice 1 here 4 @h- 2 or 5 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: another troublesome hand here|pg||
nt|chick: even if they stop in 4@S, losing an imp to a finesse K would not have been much loss,  against the huge gain if the other table bid slam and went down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weak NT variety of 1@C this time|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: in theory should bid 4@d relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: but nv not much to lose :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: north knows there is a game or slam east west|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|vugraphzxf: ns play 14-16 nv, 15-17 v|pg||
mb|d|nt|penseur9: right you are Cornelia|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be 5 clubs or 4 hearts or pass--all interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: a modern 1@S bid byE and now might try 4@H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|penseur9: will EW try for 3nt?|pg||
nt|april7: N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and i must apologize   non 1@C opener's max at 18, not 17|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: don't know what 2@H is, but my guess would be spade support|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I like Hofstadter's law, though it does not apply to bridge: "It always takes longer than expected, even if you take Hofstadter's law into account".|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|penseur9: 3@S seems better|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now west has a problem, and has solved it with 4 spades, i would have bid more:)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that is rock solid!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: its only 1 down though|pg||
nt|terminator: tactical double by gromöller at other table on board 21|pg||
nt|terminator: figured out they only have a 4-4 fit and wanted them to mishandle the trumps i guess|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|baldfriede: reasonable spot, and it will make a fine difference whether declarer leads @c7 or @c9 from dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: as a reminder, running scores are at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Open-Quali-2012-1/12_01_20_team.html|pg||
nt|april7: no switch can harm N now but E is thinking very hard|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: never seen this 3@h bid before... gf with 4 spades|pg||
pc|s6|nt|penseur9: great lead but...|pg||
nt|chick: N shouldn't be looking for ruffs with such a powerful trump holding|pg||
nt|chick: probably just led it because his partner bid clubs|pg||
nt|penseur9: agreed|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: west also declaring in open room|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzxf: 3@c-3@d would have asked for 3 card majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: thx:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzxf: 2@c - what a bid!|pg||
nt|chick: in 4@S, South can set up hearts for a club pitch and make |pg||
nt|penseur9: yes, let's see if they find it|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 13 tricks from the top|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9: 3nt or 4@S will make NS|pg||
nt|chick: sorry, meant in 6@S, he can make|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: rdbl alerted, presumably shows a spade honor|pg||
nt|april7: EW stole the partscore due to the @D holding by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Oh yes, sorry. not from the top. miscounted|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so with 16 he must pass now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzxf: in case anyone is wondering, in this first stage of the qualification we have 9 teams playing a round robin with 16 boards per match|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think east must bid 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: west studying ns's leads|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that hand is worth 10 points at least after the 1 club opening|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzxf: gro: das kommt davon wenn man nicht 1@d spielen will, spielt man halt 2|pg||
nt|terminator: lead a heart to kill communication here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzxf: the top 4 will go on to a semifinal which is again a round robin with more boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: and finally the top 2 from that will play a long match to determine the next german open team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: George Rosenkranz would be proud|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|penseur9: that should be fascinating|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: since @s8 is in dummy it's relatively safe @s9 is from HT9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzxf: 7@s makeable on dummy reversal?|pg||
nt|april7: and also the pass by N is not very bridgelike|pg||
pc|c9|nt|janhamhurg: and west knows how to play the hand after the double, since the ace of @D is with north for sure|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: there goes the entry for using hearts|pg||
nt|chick: should have won the @CK in hand|pg||
nt|chick: although in only 4@S won't matter a lot|pg||
nt|bernix:  nice dummy reversal, he needs to ruff 3 @hs in his hand. does he possede enough entries?|pg||
nt|penseur9: the bidding will take longer then the play|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bernix:  depends on contract :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: I think 6@S is easy to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: sure 6@s, 6nt would be quick|pg||
nt|penseur9: possibly 7|pg||
nt|bernix:  6 is easy, 7 can be awkward after a trump lead|pg||
nt|bernix:  he has plenty of entries, 2 @ds 2 @cs and the ace of @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: then again, is there any serious alternative line in 7@s? squeeze seems implausible|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|terminator: hard to find that he has to duck 1st heart though|pg||
pc|d9|nt|penseur9: I expect the OR will also stop in 4@S|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bernix:  small diamond to the 10 (double dummy)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|vugraphzxf: hm i would have thought 1nt shows 18-19 or 18-20 now|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: everything at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Open-Quali-2012-1/12_01_20_team.html|pg||

mb|3N!|nt|baldfriede: some opening by South. I don't really like it|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: cohner doesn't have an easy bid here....|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: daehr already has a face-down lead on the table :)|pg||

nt|penseur9: ho lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: no for 2@dx|pg||
nt|penseur9: right sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: i suspect it is east thinking and not north... they are both across the screen from me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so just @DA and trump Ace for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4NT? which ace?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: which moves jokisch up from 8th to 7th in the provisional standings|pg||

nt|terminator: 1@D showing @H|pg||
nt|terminator: same as 1@C-1@H|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: i guess 2@d retransfer, 3@d nat, 3@s asking for spade (half)stopper?|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: so 3 @H here is showing a single with 4 Spades 3 no is asking 4 cl showing a ck single 4 dia is aces?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: i suspect 3@h some shortness, 4@c club shortness, 5@c singleton, 2 keycards, no queen, but i don't know|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk y are right, so next bid is 5 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: yes missing 1 kc and @sQ should probably stay out|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|ralfwil: I dont like to ask for aces with a viod|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: i dont agree michael:( this is round robin.. they are fine with being under the top 4|pg||

nt|ralfwil: no!|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: kool|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: personally i only like it at lower levels|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: 3@H by S as transfer would be successful|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: its a to good hand to bid only 2@S!|pg||
nt|april7: now S will play the 4@S contract|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: this looks like a coffee 1 no trump|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: right   that is used a lot after 1@H-3@S  and 1@S-3N to show "any shortness"|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chick: on Board 12, declarer blundered and is now going to go down in 6@S|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|penseur9: that could mean 12 IMPs for Jamm Co|pg||
nt|chick: and so we are suddenly and unexpectedly tied!|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
nt|chick: what a swing ... 13 IMPs lost instead of 13 IMPs gained|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: sorry i missed something here... declarer lost 3@c, 1@d, 1@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: seems like a big misunderstanding here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|penseur9: no problem Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: or if you show shrtness after jacoby etc it's quite usefule|pg||
nt|april7: a @D lead might harm S for a while, but will still succeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: seems no 4@s contract here|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: unless bohnsack bids 4@c now...|pg||
nt|april7: this is not the best idea, goiung havy down if misguesses the Q of @C|pg||
nt|april7: on a @H lead though|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: stahl thinks this is rkcb|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|april7: but why the bid of 3NT by N? |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|vugraphzxf: maybe worried about bad @s split on this bidding|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|april7: an unexpected contract|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|april7: 10 of @D now|pg||
nt|april7: or better small @D|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: td call now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzxf: fortunately i get a break in 2 boards to regenerate my concentration :)|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yet another multi-purpose 1@C|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: south could have bid 2nt, which would also have been a @h raise but with more points / less distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: rohowsky waving around a double card for fun :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: x now?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|penseur9: we all need it Cornelia :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: first polish 1@c opening this set i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: normally they happen more often|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: 1@s shows unbal|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: von alvensleben alerts everything i think |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: east was waiting for a double expecting 1100|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chick: 1@S shows a typical 1N response|pg||
nt|chick: oops, I take that back|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: perhaps more like a "transfer" to NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: according to cc it just denies a 4cM|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and thanks all. Bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: second-last actually|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|april7: N will end up in 3NT contract and probably going down on a @S lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: so we see bidding on 8 points can be a good idea :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: N sould duckonly once and then ouble finesse in @D to succeed, its alsmost a double dummy problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: and again slavinsky leads give declarer pause to think|pg||
pc|d3|nt|april7: @H switch is best|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 or 6 - no big difference here...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Open-Quali-2012-1/12_01_20_team.html|pg||
pc|dA|nt|terminator: no small @C?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chick: ok, similar ... 1N would show spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: no they play transfers, 1@h=spades|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: meanwhile the gap from jamm towards the other teams is widening- no surprise i thk|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: schneider leading vs maybach is somewhat surprising|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: ok I'll shut up :)|pg||
nt|april7: W dousn't know where the 9 of @S is ofcourse|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: players always happy to listen to you avram :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: wonder when fritsche is planning to take his spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: yes not completely implausible they could duplicate this bidding|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|april7: misfit all over but 3NT by NS should work on good card positions,best lead for defence though is an unlikely @D lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: kills communication|pg||
