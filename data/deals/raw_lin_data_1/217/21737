nt|famus: Tommy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: initial thinking   how do i combine chances in the majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that assumes 5@C tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: don't know why bertens played the @d10 here, Q looks better|pg||
nt|bobholl: in practice surely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: if you play for Kx low is best of course, but against 98 the Q is the same as 10, but it gains with J9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Hasan|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it is curious that they couldn't find @S|pg||
nt|eggy:  I asuume that 3D doesn't guarantee spades in theor method, which is a bot surprising|pg||
nt|eggy:  bit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunately, the convention card only lists responder's 1st bid  no responses or follow-ups|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: reach 4@S (3nt down on @C lead)|pg||

pc|h4|nt|famus: a big B UT!!!:)|pg||
nt|twcho: NS lying 8th|pg||
nt|twcho: so EW still has chance to clinch the title|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good lad should still make easely|pg||
pc|hT|nt|twcho: seems quite a no. of options available for declarer here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|penseur9:  *lead|pg||
nt|penseur9:  nothing much the defense can do to defeat this contract here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|twcho: but @d is the most promising|pg||
nt|twcho: @c can wait and @s suit is not robust enough|pg||
nt|famus: he exercised one of em--next ought to be a small @s to Q to wind up |pg||
nt|penseur9:  this COULD make but difficult to figure out double dummy|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: @HJ from QJxx(x) or JT(x)     @HQ from QJ(x)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probably will go down now|pg||

nt|eggy:  a heart was a reasonable shot, but not an honour surely!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: Smith Echo used to avoid disasters like that  -   so that carding in @D would clarify desire to continue @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy:  It would have blocked the suit wouldn;t it?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+  could be 4@D 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL now?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: 4333 bad, but AKK is definitely max|pg||

nt|penseur9:  NS may have missed a @H trick in previous hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|an|neg. or nat or 44M 0-10|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we should see some scoring soon since the OR started on boards 14 to 16|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|an|take-out|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 6+@C 1-suit    b) 4+@C and LONGER @S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@D was 3+@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  rare 1@D contract, S could hardly bid 1@H with that hand|pg||
mb|d!|an|GF|nt|twcho: so we can conclude that both pairs are playing precision, probably the most popular system in China|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi AL welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is it best for Wortel to bid now with the lousy 6@S or later?  and show both majors or ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  does not look like any contract can ake either side|pg||
nt|penseur9:  *can make...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S looks good |pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @S contract looks best here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no entry to West hand for @H ruff|pg||
mb|3S|an|waiting|nt|ahollan1: 2@D does not promise any points   because may prefer @S over @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H from bertens now i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 3@h should say solid suit|pg||
nt|twcho: and invite cuebid|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: good save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  Kit Woolsey defines a good save as one that makes, but this is better than letting NS play 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 4@c probably deny @s control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the running total includes 10 IMPs for Het Witte Huis  [White House] for winning the round robin|pg||
nt|penseur9:  didn't somebody say that the five level belongs to the oponents|pg||
mb|4D|nt|penseur9:  *opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: meanwhile onstein 2 won 5 imps on bd 17, letting them play 4@h undoubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: dbl by Drijver was GF|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: Ed Manfield in a BOLS Bridge Tip back in the 1980s|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: actually observing the Bermuda Bowl etc recently--the most favoured system appeared to be a combination of 2/1 with precision @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW flip-flop PASS/DBL     i think Eric Rodwell gets credit for that inversion|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to stop in 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  already 4 IMPs for EW on board  1... only down one in OR|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|twcho: the winner - Netherlands having three pairs playing 3 different systems IIRC|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|famus: run of the mill board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honestly   i don't know why a 1@D bidder opposite a hand that was willing to play a partscore would be in a forcing situation|pg||

pc|s3|nt|famus: modified bergen:)?|pg||
nt|twcho: possibly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  1@D transfer to @H|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good question :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=INV a) @C/@D  b) 5@H/@S  c) NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that pretty much covers it all, doesn't it|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=bal max|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play @D myself now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: specs say 5@D a better save but i doubt that with this awful distribution|pg||

nt|penseur9:  13 IMPs on  18 for HWH OR in 3nt only|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gerbrand -- can you explain this tournament   is it a seasonal/year long event??  does it impact selection of international team??|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it's basicly the premier league|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it was a 12 team double round robin|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: West not agreeing with how East bid the hand, not sure what he should have done there to show his 6-6|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|twcho: so declarer has to guess the @c for an overtrick|pg||
nt|famus: again dicey 3NT on @d lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9:  very tough decision for W here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead beats more than @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N could be lebensohl or scramble here   both make sense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike Precision 2@C   here 2@D says nothing about points|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS just discussed, not sure what they agreed after all|pg||

nt|bobholl: sry 3 @D and 2@C to loose|pg||
nt|bobholl: but ew have to wait with cashing their 2 @C :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think E can not deduct all permutations here at this moment so each card now has a risk to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: can cash 1@c, then @s switch sets up @ss before @ds|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they cash 1@C it migth make anyway :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyy but how he must know that or tell him:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: cashing a @c looks a normal option. Drijver doesn't know Bertens has 5|pg||

pc|s9|nt|penseur9:  3nt made in OR on  19 for Lombard team|pg||
nt|jaapfr: simple 9 tricks despite bad @HKJT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 9 lead denies 10 and shows a honor|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|twcho: because @s is so vital in partial contract competition|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with 3-2 we bid 2@D in Netherlands too|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: from 109 combinations they lead the 10 and with 9xxx 2nd highest, so 9 promises a honor|pg||

nt|chmitty: Drijver (East) made what can be considered as a dangerous move next door, when bidding started 1@s 1NT 2@c (NS)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course  for tarzan  [wijs-muller]  1@C is artificial strong bid, so not an option|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy:  Obviously a lot of benefits to that, but when you open Jxxxx before AKxxx, it takes a lot of methid to clarify it in constructive auctions I think|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: does result change if Muller PASS throughout?  [i.e.  what did 3@C accomplish]|pg||

nt|vugraphzvb: Tournament Director told me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  the cops|pg||
nt|chmitty: On the other hand, in a different context, pass (by South) leaves more options to West to "adjust" his strenght|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Muller on lead knows that @D are behaving well for declarer|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but what can he do about it?|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: remember -- they started with 31 & 32, so not as far behind as you might think|pg||

nt|twcho: 2@c is probably 2-way checkback|pg||

nt|penseur9:  we're seing very agressive bidding here|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: forcing his partner to bid 2@d|pg||

pc|h5|nt|twcho: now declarer has to guess correctly in both red suits|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: final chance of @S33 brings home the game|pg||

nt|penseur9:  any idea from what side?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: I don't know, all players not know for being fast|pg||
