mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|vugraphzwn: 2@h indicates reverse strength(15+)|pg||
nt|djneill:  South certainly has a maximum Passed hand, and the @sK which was in the air now after the 1@s call seems to have a little help|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  if North is short in @d as the @c...@s...@h sequence implies, the @d may be ruffed away, and South's @h spots are good enough to stand up by themselves|pg||
