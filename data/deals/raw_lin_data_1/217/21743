mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|chmitty: they played these 2 first boards incredibly fast :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: the majors  not too friendly on this hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on them using http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   that also gives access to Voice Commentary|pg||
mb|r|nt|chmitty: open one window per table you like to watch|pg||

nt|sybarra: the spade spots are just too tough to handle  arent they?|pg||
nt|chmitty: agree yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: that 9 needed to be in an e or w hand  (or the 10)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i seem to recall  Marty Bergen writing about OBAR before Larry Cohen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OBAR = Opponents Bid And Raise|pg||
nt|chmitty: Westra can see that he makes game easily ih @h are 33 and trumps 32|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here when Bertens bids 2@S   OBAR says -- get in the auction NOW  even with fewer points than you were taught since you don't win letting them play at 2-level in 8 card fit|pg||
nt|chmitty: if @h are 42 and trumps 32, he is searching the best line|pg||
nt|chmitty: if trumps are 41 and @h 33 I can't see a winning line |pg||
nt|sybarra: these are champions we are watching, and very thoughtful players |pg||
nt|sybarra: so this may take a few moments as he searches |pg||
nt|sybarra: (thh|pg||
nt|sybarra: (thinks about possibilities) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: how long has Westra-Bertens partnership been together?     i know it used to be Bertens-Bakkeren|pg||
nt|chmitty: good question ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: best guess  after either 2008 or 2009 world championship|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sounds right|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe one of our specs from Neth knows |pg||
nt|chmitty: http://books.google.fr/books/about/Huub_Bertens.html?id=F7keygAACAAJ&redir_esc=y|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm getting inundated with   1, 2 and 3 years :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: does not give the answer|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told about 2.5 years |pg||
nt|ahollan1: well certainly newer than the 3 partnerships that made up the winning Bermuda Bowl team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i fell asleep   did last set throw out 1 board [30] or 2 [29 & 30] ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems we're on track to have time pressure again this set|pg||
nt|chmitty: one of my favourite partners always tells me, when I've been playing too fast : "as long as you are sitting here, why not take the time to think ? ..."|pg||
nt|chmitty: I must agree ... but I must also say that slow play spoils some of my pleasure in playing bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Hideous Hog:  if you're going to make a mistake -- make it quickly|pg||
nt|chmitty: I like better that one yes :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9:  part score seems indicated here... possibly in @H by NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@h might be only 3 sometimes, that's probably the reason that Ton did not bid 2@h|pg||

nt|penseur9:  this is not a forgone conclusion... lot's of work to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  seems that N is tempted to go for slam|pg||

nt|famus: Tommy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: initial thinking   how do i combine chances in the majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that assumes 5@C tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: don't know why bertens played the @d10 here, Q looks better|pg||
nt|bobholl: in practice surely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: if you play for Kx low is best of course, but against 98 the Q is the same as 10, but it gains with J9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|penseur9:  I'm not sure I would have played @D here... most likely|pg||
nt|penseur9:  trump most likely*|pg||

nt|dkkello:  they used to play chess, but that whent to fast for them |pg||

nt|penseur9:  rare 1@D contract, S could hardly bid 1@H with that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so we can conclude that both pairs are playing precision, probably the most popular system in China|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi AL welcome back|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: is it best for Wortel to bid now with the lousy 6@S or later?  and show both majors or ...|pg||

nt|penseur9:  *can make...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S looks good |pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @S contract looks best here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no entry to West hand for @H ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D does not promise any points   because may prefer @S over @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H from bertens now i guess|pg||
nt|dkkello:  well she didnt went owerboard  |pg||
mb|3N|nt|twcho: 3@h should say solid suit|pg||
nt|twcho: and invite cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  Kit Woolsey defines a good save as one that makes, but this is better than letting NS play 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 4@c probably deny @s control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the running total includes 10 IMPs for Het Witte Huis  [White House] for winning the round robin|pg||
nt|penseur9:  didn't somebody say that the five level belongs to the oponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  *opponents|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzvc: meanwhile onstein 2 won 5 imps on bd 17, letting them play 4@h undoubled|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: Ed Manfield in a BOLS Bridge Tip back in the 1980s|pg||
pc|s8|nt|famus: actually observing the Bermuda Bowl etc recently--the most favoured system appeared to be a combination of 2/1 with precision @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW flip-flop PASS/DBL     i think Eric Rodwell gets credit for that inversion|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to stop in 4@C|pg||

nt|chmitty: lolll|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=3-fit, 9-11 HCP|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok Al,  so what is 2 @H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what does Westra do here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a reasonable agreement would be  DBL=takeout of @S   same as after a Bergen style 3@C/@D raise|pg||
nt|chmitty: go to the bar and order his coffee|pg||
nt|sybarra: these guys will have a method is my guess |pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that means 2@S should be Michaels   but he only has 4@H|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chmitty: 2@s would be my choice anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bidding his longest suit    how retro|pg||
nt|sybarra: so he decided to bid his other suit |pg||
nt|chmitty: I don't pass|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chmitty: I don"t bid 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: but he does :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this is problem with 3@C -- @H suit gets lost forever|pg||
nt|sybarra: Westra may still bid  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: then again    the opponents have missed their "cold game"|pg||
nt|sybarra: W can "see"  few spades in the pards hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bakkeren result was never going to be dupicated |pg||
nt|chmitty: they might have a dialog of that kind at the end : "sry, we missed 4@h ..." "sry, we missed 4@s ..."|pg||
nt|chmitty: if you are sitting in Berten's seat, that's horrible : you KNOW your partner is hesitating now because he has @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with EW never bidding   the lead in other room was @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of hate to bid at the 4 level |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: vs 3 sp |pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: too right  and hate  balancing opp into game|pg||
nt|sybarra: the next problem  right |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the 3@C bid that we all disliked   was a huge winning action|pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 imps   |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure Westra had another good choice |pg||
nt|ahollan1: or ANY good choice :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: I wonder what dbl and 3 @H would be |pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|penseur9:  any chance for slam here?|pg||

mb|p|nt|twcho: not sure what is 3@c here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a bit surprising that NS not playing transfers over 1@C|pg||

pc|d3|nt|twcho: but shd be GF hand with @s support|pg||

pc|d9|nt|famus: modified bergen:)?|pg||
nt|twcho: possibly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  1@D transfer to @H|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S=INV a) @C/@D  b) 5@H/@S  c) NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that pretty much covers it all, doesn't it|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=bal max|pg||

nt|jaapfr: specs say 5@D a better save but i doubt that with this awful distribution|pg||
nt|bobholl: in spite of @S 3 :)|pg||

pc|h8|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: so   2236 or 2227|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|bobholl: good news for drijver knows his save is good now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: westra might get a long trump if drijver misguesses in @c|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he is thinking about not becoming trump short|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h2|nt|twcho: both this bd and the last one looks like another 2 flat bds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong side but can the defense take their @H AND kill dummy?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probable @C lead here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: really?   auction seems to highlight @H weakness|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|h3|nt|vugraphzvc: Schollaardt ai, when he sees @Hq|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West takes a toilet break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 3@D was 15-17 with 4@H, like a old school 3@H bid|pg||
nt|penseur9:  13 IMPs on  18 for HWH OR in 3nt only|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gerbrand -- can you explain this tournament   is it a seasonal/year long event??  does it impact selection of international team??|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it's basicly the premier league|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it was a 12 team double round robin|pg||
nt|bobholl: so 3@H from bertens not as good as i said :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N could be lebensohl or scramble here   both make sense|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: NS just discussed, not sure what they agreed after all|pg||
pc|s5|nt|famus: E needs to retain @d suit control by not rising up with @dA--i think thats the crux of this hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wortel preventing EW from having misunderstanding    4@H and 1@D makes bid look right, equal vul and @CQ  not so much|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: can actually have more HCP if less than 2 controls  [Ace=2 King=1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=16-18 HCP, 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will kill the @H fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i meand   will that kill ....|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if Muller bids out shape now |pg||
nt|ahollan1: new suit would be natural and forcing|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|chmitty: bid and make 4@h is an excellent result for NS next door|pg||
nt|chmitty: 1@s 1NT 2@s pass would be very common for instance|pg||
nt|sybarra: a mulit opening at the other table with the S hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: (may not be everyones preference) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bakkeren brothers have done this twice to the big clubbers|pg||
nt|sybarra: N knew it was not the spade suit |pg||
nt|chmitty: I love multi but this one ... I'm speechless|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like multi also,  but I think my pards might kill me for this one |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|chmitty: some days, you do what is right, and that's all :)|pg||

nt|penseur9:  de Lombard made another 11 IMPs on  23... only 3 IMPs diff now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: players discussing how many 5@h or 5@c would have been off|pg||
mb|2D!|an|weak 5+!h or strong 2-suit|nt|roswolf: @DQ was a BIG clue|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8   v Lankveld  5@D west|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  5@S for sure NS |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt or 4@H?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: ns 2@H/@S openers are natural weak 2's    go figure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: make sure your partnership knows whether 4N or 5@C is asking for partner's minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with strong leaping michaels they just bid 4m|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they know :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: options include using 5m as saying  I have my own suit   or   using 4N/5@C to differentiate strength|pg||
pc|s5|nt|penseur9:  I beleive to take with the ace and play trump is best line here|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must be puppet stayman,   3@S=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Wortel gave any thought to leading trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is North to making a stronger bid over 3@S?   other than 4@H  [which endplays partner] what else can he try without playing adjective bridge?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: 4@C slam try in @H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  coffe hand ?  ( i am told no hand is a coffehand! )|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this one is with @S 4-3 and @H 3-2 and @DK ok:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dkkello:  The coffeshops in Netherland is also better than ours ;)  |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@h can be defeated it seems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just guessing|pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @C decision i guess|pg||
pc|h5|nt|twcho: what is the best strategy for N to bid his hand against strong @c?|pg||
nt|twcho: it is an interesting problem indeed|pg||
pc|h6|nt|twcho: EW has missed their par contract of 3NT but N came to their rescue|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y before 5 losers so a dutch coffeeshop hand:)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|penseur9:  seems a resonnable stop here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: North puts dummy down; to bad trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: not necessary in 4@H :) |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|penseur9:  should make now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|twcho: I think east shd bid 3NT with regard to her sheer strength|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @D creates a lot of pressure |pg||
nt|dkkello:  do you agree on the 2 @D bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4333333333333 for me ok to deny|pg||
nt|dkkello:  i agree it looks like a NT hand to me!  |pg||
nt|bobholl: don't even understand because 4@H stay 4@H without an hounour :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzvc: South really took @C10 with the A|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||

nt|chmitty: :( this one no|pg||

nt|chmitty: is this a good slam ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: @s 22 you claim, more or less|pg||
nt|chmitty: @s31 and @d 33 also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not getting inundated by specs     cribbage must be dead/dying game|pg||
nt|sybarra: now what does Westra do,  he heard a spade raise from his pard|pg||
nt|chmitty: we are in the region of 60%+ ... not so bad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: impossible to have a cribbage hand that counts to 29|pg||
nt|sybarra: can he bid 5 @H?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|chmitty: plus I suspect East has a minimum for his 2NT bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  guess @C position|pg||
nt|sybarra: or sorry I thought you meant pegging  re the 29 |pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right   no combination of 5 cards yields 29|pg||

nt|henryb:  How good is the slam? It needs @s 2-2 and @d 4-2 or @s 3-1 and @d 3-3 with some slim other chances|pg||
nt|ahollan1: once again  left to their own devices  EW get to contract they wouldn't find |pg||
nt|sybarra: we thought earlier, headed into 60% range|pg||
nt|henryb:  which makes it just barely over 50%|pg||

nt|henryb:  But, as Bob Hamman used to say, any slam that makes is a GOOD slam|pg||

mb|2N!|an|inv+ !s-fit|nt|ahollan1: finally an example of canape hand  i.e.  2nd suit is LONGER|pg||

nt|vugraphzvb: thinking again|pg||
nt|sybarra: where to begin here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this might be first time we've really seen Muller huddle today|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is sorting out whether to try to cash, cross ruff or ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other match  currently  White House  +23|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: ty  and other table has a couple of hands |pg||

nt|ahollan1: i had tunnel vision that @H and @D had to break|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: Ton thinking of bidding, but he knows partner probably has 4-4 in the Majors, so fit not very likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: bd 15 and 16 do not provide good hopes for Onstein 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: so they need to score some imps quickly|pg||

pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: final chance of @S33 brings home the game|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: there might be some time penalty from the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: passive @S return wins 2 imps i think  [saves overtrick]|pg||
nt|penseur9:  any idea from what side?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: I don't know, all players not know for being fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious to have time pressure in a set that includes a PASS OUT|pg||
