nt|vugraphzxf: live ticker with previous results at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Open-Quali-2012-1/12_01_20_team.html|pg||
nt|riccho: a disciplined non-opener by E|pg||
nt|riccho: modern expert bridge tend to open WK2 even with a 4card MAJ at the side|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: personally i prefer to open such two-suiters 1M whenever possible|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|an|8+ unbal|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: dbl explained as clubs, but might as well be t/o with this hand :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzxf: 2@d is w2 @h or strong @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: team jokisch has been performing well below everyone's expectation so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Thanks Michael and hello :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chick: looks to me like losing a club, 2 hearts, 2 spades, and have to find the @DQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: we have very silly alert rules here in germany, unfortunately...|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: hello everyone, welcome back to the german trials|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: i wonder whether dbl = @d is really useful against this convention|pg||
nt|riccho: this is not very clever: not to open WK2, but then in a retard fashion denying the 4c@h suit as well |pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: of course, it makes for an easier metarule|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: let's hope they had a good night's sleep|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: i've never seen anyone actually playing a nonalertable 2@h|pg||

mb|5C!|mb|p|mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|riccho: after all NS managed to reach 3NT with 26HCP|pg||
nt|riccho: but look at the effect of an 2@s opening: ppp seems probable|pg||
nt|riccho: the strength of the @h fit lies in the fact, that no one can really make a take-out dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: felmy asks what dbl of 2@s would have been... stahl makes a throat-cutting motion|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: well can't always have the same bidding to get to 2@h, that would be boring|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: ew playing slawinsky lead, which stahl is now trying to figure out|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: and trumps turn out to be very bad lie|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: ns playing raptor 1nt overcall, that's why s had to start with double on this hand|pg||

pc|c8|nt|riccho:  alot of bidding with so small information input...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: tough hand to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: on good days this could be a slam for E/W. but this is not a good day|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|penseur9: anybody for 6@S NS?|pg||
nt|chick: this would make a good slam if only the @SK could be dropped|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) unclear that 4@H needs Queen  maybe just xx   b) who gets to show good trump??|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: w didn't like it because they have such strict requirements on preempts in 2nd seat r/w|pg||

nt|baldfriede: nevertheless leading into AKQ can hardly be right|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: declarer has shown 3 spades and 12-14 bal|pg||

mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: i like the west hand bidding, vulnerable with 5332 i woudnt open third hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|penseur9: "If anything can go wrong it will"... but the Peter's principle does not apply here :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: Interesting play problem here ... Rohowsky will see that the other table might get to 6@S, so he has to play for it to fail|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: so Smirnov has long forgotten enjoying december in Australia|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|chick: so the @SK has to be offside for him to win this board ... therefore should play the @SA first|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: i didn't catch anything about 2nt, west was too busy asking whether takeout doubles need to be alerted :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|april7: the 3NT bid by S was not the best idea, should have let N play 3@H|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: there was quite some discussion about that yesterday|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|c5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: originally there was to be a round robin of the top 4 and then a final|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: like the first 4 will go on to the next round?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: current plan is apparently to draw a ko between the top 4, but many contestants are unhappy with no advantage for 1st place this weekend|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: yes the first 4 will get through that is pretty much clear|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or play a semifinal, first can pick his opponent, that is about as fair as can be|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzxf: yes several suggested that|pg||
pc|d7|nt|april7: an expensive savetry by S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: and he's missing a big tournament there this week -- all for THIS|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: its hard to see any team but jamm making the qualification to the national team|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: has @dJ caused jokisch to misread the trump position?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: it has|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: well, if any team can give jamm a run for their money, it will be von alvensleben|pg||

mb|1D|nt|penseur9: another troublesome hand here|pg||
nt|chick: even if they stop in 4@S, losing an imp to a finesse K would not have been much loss,  against the huge gain if the other table bid slam and went down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weak NT variety of 1@C this time|pg||

nt|ahollan1: George Rosenkranz would be proud|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: 7@s makeable on dummy reversal?|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: hm i would have thought 1nt shows 18-19 or 18-20 now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: since partner has 4+@S  no @H losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: meanwhile v. alvensleben is crushing schneider to lead the provisional standings by 7 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: everything at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Open-Quali-2012-1/12_01_20_team.html|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 spades is making or not, depends on play i thk|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so last 2 no lost 7 imps, they made 9 tricks at other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: west asks a lot of questions about this auction before passing...|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: some opening by South. I don't really like it|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: cohner doesn't have an easy bid here....|pg||
nt|penseur9: likely 2nt response by E|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: daehr already has a face-down lead on the table :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: face down = 3nt ???? :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: ho lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: no for 2@dx|pg||
nt|penseur9: right sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: i suspect it is east thinking and not north... they are both across the screen from me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so just @DA and trump Ace for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4NT? which ace?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: which moves jokisch up from 8th to 7th in the provisional standings|pg||
mb|3S|nt|terminator: no still 17-19 NT|pg||
nt|terminator: 1@D showing @H|pg||
nt|terminator: same as 1@C-1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: but according to cc they play 15-17 nt vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|terminator: yes. this is an upgrade for the good @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: ok, i'll buy that :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: 5@c shows void, 5@d is rkcb, 5@h 1/4|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: they need two real landslides to get back in|pg||
pc|dA|nt|penseur9: big swing comming here|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: stahl "beeindruckend", daehr "i think i better pass, else the td will really hit me over the head"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: i guess 2@d retransfer, 3@d nat, 3@s asking for spade (half)stopper?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|janhamhurg: so 3 @H here is showing a single with 4 Spades 3 no is asking 4 cl showing a ck single 4 dia is aces?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: i suspect 3@h some shortness, 4@c club shortness, 5@c singleton, 2 keycards, no queen, but i don't know|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk y are right, so next bid is 5 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: yes missing 1 kc and @sQ should probably stay out|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I dont like to ask for aces with a viod|pg||
nt|ralfwil: viod...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i can't tell from convention card  if 4@H promised void or normal 0/1|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: 4@h is 0/1, 4nt asks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh   thanks Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: hm maybe rohowsky guessed differently|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 6 no is about 50%|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry about 75%|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: maybe he knows he is behind, in which case it makes sense to try for even a marginal slam|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: yes 1nt 18-19|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i dont agree michael:( this is round robin.. they are fine with being under the top 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: this bidding is hard for me to believe, has he miscounted the keycards?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|baldfriede: this will be some swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ralf  have you seen that 4N convention before?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: it's pretty common in germany|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: after any shortness showing bid, step asks, step 1 void, step 2 single with 1/4, etc.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzxf: now stahl wondering whether this is a grand slam try in @h or a sign-off...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzxf: well, that's true too of course :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: says maybe 4@s was rkcb for @c, not @h|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: great 6 no bid!!!!!|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: south is sad now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|penseur9: double digit swing|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: explanation confirms what we suspected|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
