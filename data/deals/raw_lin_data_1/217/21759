nt|andyv:  this splinter could excite N|pg||
nt|grebrof: theres been a norwegian "dominance" in this tournament the last years - I think they are 40+ people going this year - not everyone playing both pairs and  teams|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|nkgupt: 6@h needs a lil more than just @ck in|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d4|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|andyv:  having controls in the black suits and A@h, S has an easy bid...slam a bit lucky for N...less than 50%|pg||
nt|grebrof: surely not a laydown, but with the @clead its almost claim - since the finesse was on|pg||

pc|h5|nt|nilsland:  but with @H 2-1 he can perhaps establish the spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: some play 3rd 5th vs suit and 4th vs nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok...I think I'm finally on the same page...if 5th best, S would have had to win first trick in dummy and take finesse|pg||

nt|nkgupt: 14.5% a lil too harsh on NS for this brd|pg||
nt|grebrof: thats life, isnt it?|pg||
nt|andyv:  how good is the slam?...again 50% or slightly less if you include ruff possibilities|pg||
nt|andyv:  possibly a bit better, on club lead, you can play for J@s to drop|pg||
nt|andyv:  mixed with ruff possibilities, the precentage should be in the mid 50s|pg||

nt|grebrof: here every trick counts|pg||
nt|andyv:  in mp, leading trump not as useful since it locates missing honors for declarer and overtricks are involved....in imps, trump leads tend to be more effective because overtricks aren't as costly|pg||
