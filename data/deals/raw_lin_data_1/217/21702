nt|baldfriede: 13 tricks from the top|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|penseur9: 3nt or 4@S will make NS|pg||
nt|chick: sorry, meant in 6@S, he can make|pg||

pc|h4|nt|baldfriede: Oh yes, sorry. not from the top. miscounted|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzxf: in case anyone is wondering, in this first stage of the qualification we have 9 teams playing a round robin with 16 boards per match|pg||

nt|penseur9: the bidding will take longer then the play|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|bernix:  depends on contract :)|pg||
