mb|p|nt|warrens:  Yes, many would lead a club, but a @H through dummy when declarer is known to be short would also be reasonable.  You have to be clairvoyant to lead a @D.|pg||

nt|warrens:  and if a trump, you got all the timing you need|pg||

nt|vugraphzwe: Yes and in first round Una and Jóhanna should play Zia but he has just arrived so this was there 5 min of fame gone bad :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Iceland very good at indoor sports (nothing to do outside with that weather I suppose). World class bridge, chess and handball players|pg||
nt|pelu: NS 67% - EW 52% - but after only 8 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did the remaining pairs arrive, Gudni?|pg||

nt|pelu: +Bulgaria and Poland|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Lithuania?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You suggest that the late arriving pairs should get 60% instead of 50, Peter, since it's a force majeure situation for them?|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that "d" is soft and d = hard - almost :)|pg||
nt|pelu: correct Mats|pg||
