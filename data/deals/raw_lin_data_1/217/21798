mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: i did in a money game  first time i sat across from Grant Baze     didn't have a clue how to bid that freak|pg||

mb|p|nt|itinerant:  so, 2/1, they can't stay in 3D...|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3rd Quarter begins in about 70 minutes|pg||
nt|penseur9:  last board on this table|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 32 boards remain in the event   NOT = National Open Teams|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|penseur9:  thanks to our operator Thomas Leach...well done|pg||
nt|othered1: normal for north, with extras, to rebid in his 4-card suit despite length and strength disparities with @D|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|penseur9:  thanks to my co-commentators Al, Ed and Ian as well as Roland and Dave on voice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the web/flash viewers   correct score is  Klinger 66  Newman 27|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: assume 2@S is game force|pg||
nt|othered1: south's auction, as opposed to just punting 3N with 14 balanced, has given them room to poke around for @D slam.  But to do that they'll likely have to be willing to go past 3N|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|penseur9:  thanks to our spectators for their excellent questions and suggestions... hope to se you all for segment  3 to start in 70 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know some players with Acol background have some 4th suit sequences that are NOT game force, but this isn't one of them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is 4@H now a cue or possible place to play?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  present score after board  30 is 66 for Klinger and 27 for Newman|pg||
nt|othered1: and south went past 3N and established trumps.  Now let's see if hey can use the auction below 5@D to justify bidding 6.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in my world -- place to play|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|othered1: cue bid.  Clear|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at least with other 4 keys  Beauchamp won't be confused by response|pg||
nt|othered1: Ever wonder if the very old-fashioned forcing jump to 3@D ove 2@C wouldn't lead to a less labored auction?|pg||
mb|5N|nt|ahollan1: normally asking with void is dangerous because you don't know WHICH keys are shown|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|othered1: was 4N control asking?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5N  @DQ   not sure if it says anything about @HK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm sure 5N denies !KC|pg||
nt|othered1: or a @h cue-bid, if 4@H would have been control asking.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CK|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ours is 1st room to finish   lots of hands to see in replay at other tables|pg||
nt|loganrun: I have to go - thanks all - this 6D looks fairly straightforward - good job Wayne|pg||
mb|2S|an|.|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C sets the game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is a group that won't do that with 4 card major unless 6@C|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: The others must make up for Braithwaite's slowness :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: although he has been quick this session|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT will be played from the other side in the open room after North opens a 12-14 NT|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: was 4@C asking for cue bids  or asking for key cards?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk4: There is no other opening in the NS methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: playing Fantunes|pg||
nt|larrymori: is it 16 x 4 boards in this match?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|frankaus: tu all 4 ur company 2X16 sets to go cu soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: He could open 2C but he is a little too good|pg||
nt|newart:  arj might get put off by the H cue|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: don't ask me -- i can't tell|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: natural i think Braithwaite certainly explained 5@c as a key card response|pg||
nt|newart:  after the 3NT bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: van Jole's 4@D made it easier |pg||
nt|newart:  yes having a strong jump avail makes it much easier|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: No, you can't have 5422 when you open 2@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: seems a bit inconsistent to do that then bid 4N instead of direct keycard ask  or  follow-up cue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no harm|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they are negotiating a claim |pg||
nt|newart:  if i couldn't bid 3D strong i would bid 4|pg||
