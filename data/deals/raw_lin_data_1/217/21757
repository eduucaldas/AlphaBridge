nt|marlowepi: with a more standard 20-21 range, 2N opening on S hand would be multiply flawed, though of course such auction can work out well. 2N is a big slam-killer, and with such pure primes ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one opens 2N with some trepidation. the high-card structure screams "suit" rather than NT, but  one must cleave to system, especially when alternatives are  unmpalatable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finding 6N too tough without relays -- and maybe even then|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Lester just showed Grue his whole hand thinking grue was about to be dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here of course it is the E hand which is the slam-killer:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: grue evened it out by showing the whole table his own hand :P|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: i didnt even catch the first trick theyre playing it so fast|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the next round, perhaps three players will put down dummy simultaneously|pg||
