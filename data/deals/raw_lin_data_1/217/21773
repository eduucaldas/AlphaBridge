mb|p|mb|5D|nt|sommer: while Kello is both serious and joking (as always), we here see a possible slam for EW|pg||

nt|vugraphzyb: he changed his mind to 2@h:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwa: with a @c lead does 3@h not go down?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  last night we had a big debat about that subject  :)|pg||

nt|dkkello:  we play something called bekkasin   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  almost the same  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|snagolf: but they will end up in 4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: many play it as shortness and forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 3@c could be 4-5-3 in any way .. South would ussaly bid a major if he had one|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sommer: actually 6@D is a very fine slam|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I think theese 4 players are perhaps the aggresive bidders we have in this country?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the most aggresive|pg||
nt|stigw: Ougt to go down, but....|pg||
nt|pelu: not the first time this weekend :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|snagolf: but since he more or less i forced to double 2@hs it is very difficult to find when W has 3 card @h-supp|pg||

nt|stigw: Openeing biddings tend to be more and more aggressive the days, and he is protected by his strong cl, so - I would guess that more than 50 % of strong players would open|pg||

nt|vugraphzwa: there should be some kinda 5 minut break between the 22 boards:)|pg||
nt|pelu: partscore battle - 3@D/3@H - but can they stop there?|pg||
nt|stigw: He did that.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yet another 5-5 M|pg||
nt|dkkello:  7 boards , time andreas?  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  54 min ?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  3 ?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This time 4@s makable with @h guess|pg||
nt|dkkello:  plenty of time   |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Kello - I would pass to 1NT - and collect 100/150 against 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  17 HP this time :9|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dkkello:  it equalize board  1 , fair enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: never deny a 2-card suppport:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry 4-card support....|pg||
nt|pelu: some would D in W = some values and 2 card support for @d|pg||
nt|dkkello:  DBL=  points and take out|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: yes about 55 minuts.. i was just reading that:)|pg||
nt|stigw: It wont surprise me, if they also bid to 7 in the open room. We'll see.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  1 NT is and so on |pg||
nt|frm: A new possible slam in spades!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @C asking |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dkkello:  many @D from Bilde now|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Anders to play - home for sure !|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no 5@d from S?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  natural 3 @S  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  only 3 ..   |pg||
nt|stigw: This cannot make slam despite the lucky sit here and there.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he is getting old to|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but do you pass as S on 3@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: as expected - the partscore battle = game :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  can i say flat board ?   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  no|pg||
nt|frm: Not that I would recommand to bid 6 Spades - but it´s on with the heart ace in S and a diamondguess. You also need to avoid a club lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: harakiri:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and another bad luck for E-V   ?  |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: At least they did not have an 8 card fit this time;)|pg||
nt|stigw: A club lead should defeat 6 sp.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dkkello:  and why shouldent he lead a club ?  |pg||
nt|stigw: As long as North doesnt start hearts, I think 11 tricks is the maximum.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  North cant be thinking?  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  probably Askgaard|pg||

nt|dkkello:  very surprisingly I wasent invited   ??   |pg||
nt|stigw: Interesting mistake in board 10 at the other table, East escaping from 3 nt after getting doubled ther - bette a "doubtshowing" rdbl. I think, if only you have got the nerves.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but it is not that the winners will automaticlly represent Denmark, but it does improve your chances if you win |pg||
