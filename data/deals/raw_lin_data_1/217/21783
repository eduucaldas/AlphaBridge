nt|jbgood: NS make 3 nt now|pg||

nt|roswolf: i have privately copies of e/w CC and will endeavour to interpret the auctions - they play a strong club system|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: this is Rob, your operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: Ok, we've had a techical problem, which has been fixed now. We will put in the scores for the first two boards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: This time the familiar figure of Andrew Robson, playing with Alexander Allfrey|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: EW, as we know, play a strong club...NS do not|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|clinch: Practical 4@h from Robson|pg||
nt|roswolf: penalty double anyone?|pg||
nt|roswolf: of 1nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a gadget|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: 3 kör 3 pik boardu|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w play a lot of transfers|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|roswolf: 3@C was at least to me suprising|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Hi all. Lots of people playing Multi-Landy in this position over a 1N overcall |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  welcome to the final stanza of the first weekend of the 2012 Camrose|pg||
mc|5|nt|roswolf: hi Liz|pg||

nt|roswolf: this may be fun|pg||
nt|clinch: Strong chance of a double game swing there|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Robson says he got the hand wrong because AA led the 7 of clubs, not the low one he should have done from his holding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@c was probably down one, so no great harm for Wales|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: strong club auction|pg||
nt|clinch: Ah|pg||
nt|clinch: club was an excellent lead|pg||
nt|clinch: but not the seven, apparently!|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will feel he should have made that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: W isn't happy|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would have transferred to @S|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  We should not expect happy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: balanced is an individual description|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C may be bid here|pg||

nt|clinch: Two hands with huge potential already, the IMPometer may be ticking over soon|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|clinch: A grand slam here, though not for the opening bidder!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: another very exciting hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: I think we can classify Robson's opening as weak :)|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@s a bit strong....|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: e/w play 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and inverted minors, even with overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1@H MAY BE A TRANSFER TO SPADES|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson will not be happy when he sees the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: and 5 card Majors, 4 D and 2C|pg||
nt|roswolf: DENYING 4 SPADES i think|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North has a constructive weak 2@s available|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the 2@d Multi shows a weaker hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|yorkbeach:  if it is one of the weak options|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: in for a penny in for a pound|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have raised to 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: S checking lead styles|pg||
nt|roswolf: will probably take the spade finesse to create an extra entry to dummy|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|clinch: Don't blame E for passing, though he might have bid on|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in 3rd seat I am not sure of the need to make the distinction - perhaps it helps partner judge whether to save|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|yorkbeach:  East might have wanted to bid 2NT after the double to show two places to play|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but perhaps he thought West would take it as natural|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders will need to play @c eraly to stop the overtrick|pg||
pc|dT|nt|golfsquash: much harder to bid game if west opens strong NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: hmm so far so good|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks cold now and declarer is unlikely to go down because the defence will open up the suits to his advantage|pg||

nt|clinch: So three big potential swings, with England having the better of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: that was not the real auction and play for board 19|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: internet went down...|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  i think anyone who knows brian would know he did not open 4@H :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: on 19 the english n/s scored +790 in 4@SX|pg||
nt|roswolf: the english sprint away|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be down to who has the better judgment|pg||
nt|clinch: hi David|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: this is what we wanted to see after a flatish set earlier|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|roswolf: everyone is in the action|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has a bewildering choice of actions here - 4@H or 5@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: ARE THE OBVIOUS ONES - PASS ALSO HAS ITS ATTRACTIONS|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hiding in the long grass is 3@S but what will north make of it|pg||
mb|1D|nt|golfsquash: 1NT rebid 15-17|pg||
nt|roswolf: the magical mystery tour continues|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Sorry i can't explain more..it's very murky here|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl showing long spades and @D tolerance?|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S weak raise - good raise via 2@H|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@s bid on last is understandable, but surely EW had some kind of double-then-bid type of auction available|pg||
nt|ady: still tempting for north|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: herkes kartý iyi oynuyor demek ki:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: ne de olsa final seansý|pg||
nt|roswolf: now south runs|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: 3@C and 3@H alerted, but not sure|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:  I like opening my longest suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm imaginative keepinf his clubs concealed|pg||
mb|3D|nt|golfsquash: and then play in 2@d or 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: S asking about the 3D bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: east doesnt give up|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  Lucky 3-3 heart break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: auction on previous was something like 2@h-(2!n)-3@h..........4@h(S)-(X)-end|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS have done well to diagnose the misfit and stop at a safe level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if West has the @sA, declarer might set up the @d as the @sK will be an entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: got an explanation now, 3@C random game try, often with H and 3H is LT without 4@H|pg||

nt|marlowepi: The course followed by E here is not one I would expect to have a positive long-term track record. Certainly it is sensible to treat the hand as too promising for an initial 3C,, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially at these colors, but having bid 2C and heard partner pass you arent really going anywhere and further action rates to help the foe more than your own side|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi all|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|golfsquash: I believe 2@c is GF, even tho' the convention card doesn't say so|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 4@c was RKC 1430|pg||
nt|clinch: The first double game swing on 17 came to pass for Scotland - 17 and 18 won't go their way, though|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS judged well to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  contract is makeable but declarer will need to reject @d finesse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  endplay might not work if diamonds were 2-2 but in that case taking the trump finesse does not help anyway|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think he can make this - He expects E to be 5-5-2-1 now after the auction and lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: so he wins this @C|pg||
nt|copeyj: A@S ruff a @S|pg||

nt|clinch: Thanks Basil|pg||
nt|ady: close to making if ace and king of clubs would stand up|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N has the upside of making it a bit harder for EW to get together in spades, but with a strong club on one's left there is less likelihood foe will be seriously discomfited. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meanwhile it might well help the eventual declarer.  after all, if robson were to pass on this S hand at these colors, who would ever play him for this hand:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson still thinking|pg||
nt|clinch: After opening his 1 count on 19, who can blame him for entering with this monster?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: on bd 20 the endglish n/s conceded -1100 in a very dubious auction - 15 big imps back|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson states that they could be in a 3-0 fit and hes not sure on the auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can see only 5 top tricks and a shortage of entries to hand|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: the real upside of 1N with the S hand comes when W is strong and balanced while EW have a 44 spade fit, and N can do something dynamic over the pass (or NT bid) by W|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|golfsquash: 6@d is possibly 1 down, even on a nontrump lead, ducking the first spade creates problems.|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  10 or 11 depending upon whether the @hQ scores|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: that @cQ was likely to be a defensive value, even if he couldn't cash any diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: the test you should apply is: will this contract go two down more often than it will make?|pg||
nt|roswolf: in my club an 18 count with KQx of trumps behind the bidder is an automatic double|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Crouch decides to open a packet of Boubon biscuits....not passing them round though|pg||
nt|dburn: if so, the IMP odds favour doubling it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E should play a low heart from hand ASAP to test S|pg||

nt|marlowepi: you beat me to it Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: he does have 3 tens|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT might have made on a @h lead|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  all may come down to guessing who has the @sJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: indeed quite possibly n/s in the other room may run ino problems|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|roswolf: into|pg||
pc|d4|mc|7|nt|roswolf: yes but when your opps hardly know what they are doing then opening leads are much more difficult|pg||
nt|ady: 4-0 trump split will stop the 12th trick on the non diamond lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: cant see why 4@H was not made in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: This was the last board of this round. We start again in 1 hour 15 minutes.|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK thanks all|pg||
