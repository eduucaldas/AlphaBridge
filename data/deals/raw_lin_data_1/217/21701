mb|p|nt|sybarra: the Witte Huis (White House) is the club where many tourneys are played  (jrs, etc) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|fann4: Shirley, do you know how many boards in this match?|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like 32 x5 |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am told 16x5 |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry all |pg||
mb|3N|nt|fann4: A Dutch spectator says it's 5 x 16 = 80 boards. So a long way still to go.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|famus: shud b a swing bd|pg||
nt|sybarra: so folks it is 16 x 5 |pg||
nt|fann4: A fairly std auction (for a change), and surely a high @H lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: White House is located in Amsterdam |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: if I remember right,  Lombard in Rotterdam?   help me Neth.  friends |pg||
nt|vugraphzvb: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I remember  |pg||
nt|fann4: Now 3N can make here - firstly declarer must not play that @HK.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: I have played at the White House   fabulous facility |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|fann4: In the CR (Closed Room) declarer put up the @HK at trick 1.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and refurbished tennis club (with many active tennis courts still) but mainly used as a bridge club |pg||
nt|sybarra: so this is really amsterdfam vs. rotterdam|pg||
nt|sybarra: the master class of each club |pg||
nt|sybarra: in dutch  that is Meesterklasse|pg||
nt|sybarra: other semi finalists are Onstein 1 and Onstein 2  another great club |pg||
nt|fann4: S is trying to find the safest switch now - I think he will play a @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually, for the Lombard are playing Meike from Amsterdam, Maarten from Alkmaar (30 km's N of A'dam)|pg||
nt|fann4: Mind you, he might continue a low @H, hoping to get in with his 2 kings, to make 3@H and the minor Kings.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: Onstein 1 are Tom Drijver and Sjoert Brink/Bauke Muller-Simon de Wijs   whom we have seen mannnnnnny  times on vugraph |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I meant Bas Drijver |pg||
nt|sybarra: dont let my fingers do the walking today (that is advert in usa) |pg||

nt|sybarra: feel free to correct me |pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|fann4: Declarer has no idea where the minor suit honours are, but somehow he must avoid playing the @CQ here.|pg||

nt|runnerup: forgotten unblock in @h here|pg||
nt|fann4: No. declarer needed to overtake with the @HK there, cash @SA and when the J falls, exit @H8 to South's K. |pg||
nt|vugraphzvb: he actually did unblock, I'm sorry|pg||
nt|aldek: he is lost now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|twcho: but @d is the most promising|pg||
nt|twcho: @c can wait and @s suit is not robust enough|pg||
nt|famus: he exercised one of em--next ought to be a small @s to Q to wind up |pg||
nt|penseur9:  this COULD make but difficult to figure out double dummy|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HJ from QJxx(x) or JT(x)     @HQ from QJ(x)|pg||

nt|fann4: 2@D a weak jump shift response.|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be criss cross? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or just weak jump shift|pg||
mb|d|an|take-out|nt|fann4: N had an interesting hand. Only 8pts but the 6-4 shape suggests game.|pg||
nt|fann4: N has.....|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: wild bidding and interesting from the other table|pg||
nt|fann4: 3N doesn't look right to me.|pg||
nt|aldek: preempt|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure it would be my bid (but again I am chicken) |pg||
nt|fann4: Though a @S lead would see declarer running for home with 9 quick tricks.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sybarra: but a ht lead will not |pg||
nt|sybarra: and fearless in N |pg||
mb|p|nt|aldek: East expects NS to make 4@H|pg||

nt|sybarra: -2 on a trump lead?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no entry to West hand for @H ruff|pg||

mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: good save|pg||

mb|5S|nt|twcho: 4@c probably deny @s control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the running total includes 10 IMPs for Het Witte Huis  [White House] for winning the round robin|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW flip-flop PASS/DBL     i think Eric Rodwell gets credit for that inversion|pg||

nt|aldek: Jansma has decided to bid his 6-5 distribution|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fann4: Despite the shocking @C break, declarer may have a chance in 4@S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|aldek: he can make it now, but I doubt it|pg||
nt|fann4: Probably @DQ now|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a very friendly lay out |pg||
nt|fann4: Only good thing is trumps are 3-3. He may go after @C though|pg||
nt|sybarra: although spades are 3/3 |pg||
nt|sybarra: you beat me too it,  probably only friendly thing about the hand  |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|aldek: he can develope a heart trick|pg||
nt|fann4: Defence have done it for him|pg||
nt|sybarra: well,  look no gift horse in mouth as they say |pg||
nt|fann4: Now declarer can make;  5@S, 1@C, 2@D, 2@H and maybe even an extra @H, if he pitches a @C here.|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm not sure this @H return was best. Declarer may figure E unlikely to have overcalled vulnerable on Jxxxx|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is worried about the club aq being off side I think |pg||
nt|fann4: It's a very trick hand this.|pg||
nt|fann4: WE can all see how easy it is - draw trumps and play a @C towards dummy.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|c4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|fann4: To make, declarer must not play either minor now.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and has to play for club ace on side |pg||
nt|sybarra: loud and clear  Roland |pg||
nt|fann4: Think he needs to draw trumps now and rely on the @CK as an entry.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|s4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: or should he ruff a @H first, then draw trumps,  then rely on @C |pg||
nt|fann4: So far declarer has not made a wrong move - after careful thought at virtually every stage.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now he also needs spades 3/3 |pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: South asking about time, he has 12 minutes for this board still|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and White House total includes 10 from winning the round robin|pg||
nt|penseur9:  the last round should be fascinating... don't miss it|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final chance of @S33 brings home the game|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: there might be some time penalty from the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: passive @S return wins 2 imps i think  [saves overtrick]|pg||
nt|penseur9:  any idea from what side?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: I don't know, all players not know for being fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious to have time pressure in a set that includes a PASS OUT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they didn't pass it out at the other table :)|pg||
