nt|sybarra: tough to get more exciting than yesterday |pg||
nt|mrdct: good morning everyone|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi Dave :) |pg||
nt|sybarra: and its good evening from me |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrdct: NS are playing fantunes|pg||
nt|mrdct: so their one-level openings are all forcing for one round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S  [all 1-level suit openings] forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=0-9|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Al, welcome |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play their version of Fantunes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 levels intermediate as I recall|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: yep - so a bit of a hole in their system is they can't open a weak two|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  2-level suit  (9)10-13, unbal     so 1N=12-14 and includes some unexpected shapes|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1-suit usually 14+ HCP, but   54 majors could be weaker|pg||
nt|mrdct: a little bit too much to do in 4@h i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: even though the @hKJ are onside you need @s 3-3 and some to have a chance i think|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other room without login via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

nt|sybarra: they may have pickled the @H trick |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: coincidentally  bbo just finished vugraph session that featured fantunes|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mrdct: or east will get an extra @s trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fantunes = Fantoni + Nunes|pg||

mb|2N|nt|mrdct: east only plays bridge once a year in this event so i don't think EW will have a lot of system|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: if it goes p,p,  can N sit still?|pg||

nt|mrdct: NS in 5@c in the closed room|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||

nt|warrens:  if declarer had played a @D to pitch a @S, S would pitch the A of @C and a @C through still beats it|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+@S, 0-9 HCP|pg||

mb|2C|nt|sybarra: ok  Al,  2 @C ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for fantunes     a) NAT, 14-17 HCP or b) UNBAL 17+ HCP|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I bet it was some sort of game force thing |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: with a double fit and shortages floating around i think it's normal to get to 4@s|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Klinger Mullamphy - Standard|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm sure it is - they're a casual partnership, right?|pg||
nt|itinerant:  this might be a quick defence also|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Braithwaite van Jole 2/1|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S rather than 2N   isn't obvious choice|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the closed room east was able to use 2@c as an artificial game try and when west showed a minimum they stopped in 2@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps they're opening 4-card majors   so rebid = 5+|pg||

nt|itinerant:  It seems 2C is artificial in all circumstances these days...|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry there was a delay there - Braithwaite was thinking of backing in (presumably with 2NT). I clicked Pass too quickly|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think so|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: did he have any chance after red suit lead?|pg||

nt|tejjyid: your judgement faster than his - but equally correct|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: North thought south was making cue bid(s)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: a little surprised to see dummy|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the idea is   you don't need attitude in declarer's suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each partner can use Smith to say   continue original suit or find a shift|pg||
nt|mrdct: but quite often count is important so partner knows when to duck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this case @C3 then @C2 says   no future in @S|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: they have seven boards and the director has just advised them that they have less than half an hour to play|pg||

mb|2D|an|.|nt|larrymori: hi Ed btw|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i did in a money game  first time i sat across from Grant Baze     didn't have a clue how to bid that freak|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: last year i had same 76 and opened 1@H and partner responded 2@c|pg||
mb|3D|nt|itinerant:  and the bal 18-19 counts just raise to game?|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant:  so, 2/1, they can't stay in 3D...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|larrymori: good 18 and 19, bad 18 can bid a minor, you can include the 5332 into the 54 @d hand if you want to and bid 3@d and ask about that if needed|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: and he may have avoided a double precisely to ensure that E did not act again|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: quick 6NT here|pg||
nt|larrymori: 3@d and then can disclose with the next 2 bids|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: DBL looks like it was support [3@S]|pg||
nt|frankaus: only 11 on top|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: although it is easy to see why E was not excited with defensive prospects against 4S|pg||
nt|itinerant:  There don't appear to be many losers in 5D but there ain't a whole lot of winners either.|pg||
nt|itinerant:  3NT, played by north may be their best chance of escape..|pg||
nt|larrymori: if you are opening light (not arguing) then you need more for a game force with a misfit in his bid major|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: hopefully specators who play Support DBLs have discussed with partner meaning responder's rebids|pg||
nt|frankaus: technique here is ti "rectify the count " then run winners and watch opps squrn|pg||
nt|frankaus: del monte poker player hard to read him|pg||
nt|frankaus: S know not to have 4 major|pg||
nt|frankaus: interesting that tho its declarer that has the problem by - rectifying the count early he transfers the problem to the defence|pg||
nt|larrymori: 64 with 2 def tricks or 55 majors might be the light part for the light opener perhaps|pg||
nt|itinerant:  agreed, Larry. This is one disadvantage to the modern cheeky style|pg||
nt|larrymori: it works much better with precision|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||

nt|itinerant:  lots of kibs telling me this is cold now - i beg to differ|pg||
nt|itinerant:  If he makes it, we can nominate him for best played hand of hte year|pg||
