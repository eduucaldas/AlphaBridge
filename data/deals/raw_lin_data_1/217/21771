nt|marlowepi:  W should bid here|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  even over 2C|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: 3NT not so easy on @C-attack - 8 toptricks and need the @H-finess|pg||
nt|stigw: So it was special, because 4 sp has got chances.|pg||

mb|p|mb|5D|nt|sommer: while Kello is both serious and joking (as always), we here see a possible slam for EW|pg||
nt|snagolf: a very sneaky look at he opps cards and young Bilde can bid 7 @hs|pg||
mb|d|nt|dkkello:  No pictures of Vest  Gregers Bjarnasson |pg||

nt|marlowepi:  well, E has helped NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: he changed his mind to 2@h:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwa: with a @c lead does 3@h not go down?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  last night we had a big debat about that subject  :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT easy make - but now EW are on thin ice|pg||
nt|dkkello:  we play something called bekkasin   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  almost the same  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|snagolf: but they will end up in 4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: many play it as shortness and forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 3@c could be 4-5-3 in any way .. South would ussaly bid a major if he had one|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sommer: actually 6@D is a very fine slam|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I think theese 4 players are perhaps the aggresive bidders we have in this country?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the most aggresive|pg||
nt|stigw: Ougt to go down, but....|pg||
nt|pelu: not the first time this weekend :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|snagolf: but since he more or less i forced to double 2@hs it is very difficult to find when W has 3 card @h-supp|pg||

nt|vugraphzwa: @s shift now will beat 3@d|pg||

nt|dkkello:  yeah whatever |pg||

nt|dkkello:  but if Clemmensen/Marquadsen get some punch in , they are very dangerous to anybody  |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 1@S here from W would be transfer to 1!N so i think 1!N showed a stronger hand|pg||

nt|pelu: they play strong 2@h and 2@s (Acol-style)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=5654|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 140:) |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: This table is quite quick!|pg||
nt|stigw: About the slam hand, skaftij is of courese right, and cl might be 3-0 on the wrong side, so....|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: at least so far:)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Strange, Stig is here :-)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but with odds|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Difficult to say Well played partner :P|pg||
nt|dkkello:  lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  If this was handball I would have called for a "time-out"  |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|sommer: now what?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sommer: "some" @S, NS|pg||
nt|snagolf: a @D sacrifice against either Game in M|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a lot actually |pg||
nt|snagolf: 4 in either M|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well 4@S can be beaten by east getting a @c ruff with @s A:)?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Bilde can hardly join the bidding   ?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes..a sacrifice from EW doesn't look obvious|pg||
nt|pelu: a small @C-lead would defeat 4@s - @c-ruff|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Martin has AKQJxxx not vulnerabel , he will make a lot of noise with this one |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: i think east at least non vull will bid in on anything on strong 1@c trying to get n-s out of balance|pg||
nt|stigw: Again the defence versus strong club makes things difficuklt for N/S.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  To those who may not know, Stig, an international champion, is renowned for his slow play.|pg||
nt|stigw: But 4 sp seems natural here...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  cant say much had happend since  ( Leonard Cohen)  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|snagolf: yes ... true|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Right Stig, the realys were interrupted|pg||
nt|dkkello:  18-20  NT   opens 2 @C  we learned|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: exactly|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@C = 18-20 ballanced|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 !X  Gameforce  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  yes but small @C lead from V   , not first choice in real life |pg||
nt|sommer: @CA, @C too|pg||
nt|dkkello:  more likely  |pg||
nt|sommer: E can ruff with @SA..same|pg||
nt|dkkello:  @H 10|pg||
nt|dkkello:  betting ?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..@CA is my vote|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trump lead is better for the defence|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @C   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  not|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: only a small @C work|pg||
nt|sommer: no Peter|pg||
nt|dkkello:  i loost  , well done Graversen|pg||
nt|stigw: Thats OK, even if 6 might make.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  sorry , it is 1 NT  who is  i think , not an precision expert  :(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a missed 3nt - or? 3@s, 3@h 2@d and 1@c|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sommer: ty|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sommer: when W comes in on @SQ, he gives E a ruff on @SA|pg||
nt|pelu: would u all bid 3@S in N - for me only 2@S - |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|pelu: results: http://www.netbridge.dk/bridge/discuss/treplies.asp?message=5235&all=True|pg||
nt|dkkello:   I looked at the math .. Qxxx in N is 17,76% ... ruffing without playing AK wins to Qx in N (4,36) Qx in S(4,36) and Qxx in S (13,32) > 17,76|pg||
nt|dkkello:  tx to  Deyan Spasov  from Bulgarian|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hmm , everytime we can find a hole in the 2 superexperts fellowcommentators of mine , it is fine |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|sommer: .but can he emagine that?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hQ|nt|dkkello:  it is to difficult for me  |pg||
pc|d2|nt|sommer: seems so|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but down he went |pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: didnt succed this time - ruffing finess best chance - as I said :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dkkello:  only chance   |pg||
nt|ralfwil: also 4@s|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: 3x@H would now defeat 2@H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  You and Deyan better take that discussion in the lunchbreak  ..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes would suspect E-V to bid more aggresivly |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dkkello:  @S now .?   |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: kello at what time did we start?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  10 a.m. |pg||
nt|dkkello:  maybe 10.05|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: so they have used an hour on playing 4 boards |pg||
nt|dkkello:  this aint speedball for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 15 minuts per board:) |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: i am not saying that those boards where the "easy" once but cmon:) its not a contest on who can use the most time|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Now welcome Stig Werdelin  ..  :)  |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hmm |pg||
nt|sommer: ..well|pg||
nt|sommer: close|pg||
nt|snagolf: I agrre Peter ... a good hand 4 card. supp, single @d etc etc .. but too feisty|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dkkello:  My To do list:  dont critisize the players when I cant do it better myself , but ..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Stig! long time no see:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  50 years at topbridge in denmark and the world  |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzwa: if they keep going this way they will have finished 12 out of 22 boards |pg||
pc|h5|nt|nilsland:  Maybe go can go wrong faster Kello?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzwa: it's true he is thinking |pg||
nt|dkkello:  lol|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: S know that W is short in @S and prob only 3@hs, so the lead af a small @H could often be right|pg||

nt|sommer: Askgaard/Bjarnarson took the "bad" slam in b2 but were lucky (as we saw)|pg||
nt|snagolf: most people would Kello|pg||
nt|skaftij:  On bd1, EW are in 4@h in OR, so missed chance for Bjarnarson - Askgaard|pg||
nt|pelu: in B4 EW stoppen in 6@s|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi Ralf and Kello, long time no see.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  E-V are following the law   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Murphys law    |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: Yes Hagen knew the @s lead was coming and know his partners distrabution.. very good bid!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  but they are maybe on the 4 level when it comes around  ?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bjarnarson also bid 2@s|pg||
nt|dkkello:  The old tournament in london etc an cavendish  and many many caps for denmark|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Sunday times tournaments ..  |pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|dkkello:  Macallan  ?  cant renember  |pg||
mb|1H|nt|skaftij:  What a misitit!|pg||
nt|pelu: EW open on 4 card major, and major before minor is the suit is OK|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hagen is earning himself a chance to play for Denmark IMHO |pg||
mb|1N|nt|snagolf: so the thing is: will they bid 5@s over 5@h?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  5 @C  now   ?|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S has a chance..4@H is almost laydown - guess Martin will go on to 5@H if needed|pg||
nt|snagolf: never ever ...|pg||
nt|snagolf: never ever 5@c|pg||
nt|sommer: ..agree|pg||
nt|dkkello:  never you said?|pg||
nt|snagolf: 5@hs is the percentage bid here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  come on Martin!|pg||
nt|sommer: ..it comes...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I am not young enough to no everything   |pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you dbl or bid 1nt as N?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  know = no|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|sommer: playing with Lars, he MUST pretent, he's thinking about it:)))|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C = reversed Toronto - promise @S-support|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Have to go, will be back later :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  see you Mats|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Mats|pg||
nt|dkkello:  dbl for me |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 3@c good bid here many would bid 2!N|pg||
mb|2H|nt|stigw: Yes, all of them right, and the old club in London is (or was) the Portland Club.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|dkkello:  lol|pg||
nt|sommer: ..pretend..even|pg||
nt|snagolf: reversed Toronto after an opening in 1. hand?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes i think they play like that  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=5654|pg||
nt|pelu: Yes - just see CC|pg||
nt|snagolf: silly|pg||
nt|snagolf: but then again: it would be a weird relay here|pg||
nt|pelu: They open very weak, so they need a bid to ask - "Do u have an opening" :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dkkello:  @h 10 this time?  ;)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  decent contract decent bridge today|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|snagolf: he can't go wrong .. 1 down and then jst close your eyes and hope they folks in 4@s win it .. this will take 35 seconds, when Martin gets in|pg||
nt|dkkello:  so far I lost all my bettings , maybe I shouls crawl back to bed ?|pg||
nt|snagolf: under the rock you mean?|pg||
nt|sommer: ;-)..nooo|pg||
nt|pelu: no Kello - we all like to bet with u :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and the reversed Toronto called Drury  in the rest of the world ..|pg||
nt|stigw: Difficult to blame anybode here, but N/S are beginning to breathe more smoothly now I guess.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Yeah, the win your Kierki money back ?|pg||
nt|snagolf: 34-33-32-31|pg||
nt|snagolf: stiff @cJ in W is winning chance|pg||
nt|dkkello:  what we witness this morning wasent that pretty    :(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but @h10xx instead of 872 and 3nt is makeable:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzwa: N-S scored 138 points in last match|pg||
nt|dkkello:  thats was pretty ugly actually|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|stigw: Unlucky for N/S in board 1, that opps at the other table bid and made the 50 % grand, but so it is.|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  good evening all|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzwa: Lars put his cards down and claimed 10:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|pelu: Martin now know @DA or K in West (after the lead and @SK in West - East cant have @DAK) so he will prob try a doubble fines in @C for down 1|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Andreas? who has been the slowest pair?   all og them?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  of them |pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzwa: to be honest all have been very slow each board.. |pg||
nt|stigw: Can any of you tell me, if the players can see the score from board to board they have played ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Andreas?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: u mean right after they have played them?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  that one was for you , dont think they can|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|skaftij:  On bd 2, Schaltz - Blakset bid 1NT - 3NT, no chance of success|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sommer: @CK is "placed" in E..so, he will try @CQ, I think|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|snagolf: which is also only winning chance|pg||

mc|8|nt|pelu: hi Poul why not ask Kello for a bet :)|pg||

nt|dkkello:  IMHO  E-V  are clear cut to represent Denmark in many years to come .. |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: it is not here either.. yesterday there was even no bridgemates:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  3@s the limit|pg||
nt|dkkello:  They have an exellent partnership and work with the system a lot|pg||
mb|1N|nt|snagolf: 3NT now|pg||
nt|dkkello:  gentleman my ...    I know you guys|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|3N|nt|stigw: You might never know for sure in board 2, but most likely down 2.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  - 1|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @h lead and continuation|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dkkello:  and Kasper konow- Ander hagen sholud join them i think   ..|pg||
nt|stigw: OK, and they do in fact play at 3 different tables.|pg||
nt|frm: E-W kan make 10 tricks in a heartcontract!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  should |pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  not yet  |pg||
nt|pelu: strange D by W|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT 12-14|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Ws hand is not a nt-hand in my opinion - even if I play weak 1nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Ws hand is more like a multi or weak 2@h for me...|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|dkkello:  agree Peter|pg||
nt|snagolf: this D is beyond me|pg||
nt|sommer: the 4-1 break in @D is-no-good for NS|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a lot of presure bidding and thats fine with me , what should Lars do now?|pg||
nt|pelu: no but 4!§C D is good for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: 4@c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: all pionts in the black suits|pg||
nt|ralfwil: points....|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the benefit of precision  .. the open very very light  |pg||
nt|stigw: I doubt they reach 4 H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  South presumably asks for help in @d|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dkkello:  5 @D   then  |pg||
nt|stigw: But 5 di ok too.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d2|nt|snagolf: take the money .. thatta boy|pg||
nt|sommer: agree|pg||
nt|stigw: Again we see a 4-card-support not jumping, I think they play 2 better than 3, and might have 4 card-support even when bidding only 2.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  which North certainly has|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: if north had Kxx in @d could 5@D really win?|pg||
nt|frm: A trumplead against 5 D would not be so nice!|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sommer: ...like betting with Kello?|pg||
nt|pelu: what did Graversen have for lunch?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|dkkello:  talking of money , dont go before we settle a date for the next kierki  |pg||
nt|sommer: ..not for me..|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 3@d was long suit trial bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I am sure they will catch up suddenly  , they can be very very fast  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  and of course N-S also have potentiel to make it to the national team  |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|snagolf: maybe Andreas can enlighten us to what Graversen has put in his tea cup .. ?? what was that Double all about. Telliing that he had the @c 8 as well?|pg||
nt|stigw: ot easy, but it should make I think.|pg||
nt|stigw: Not easy I meant.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  not easy at all|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sommer: 500 is a fine score for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: dono.. i think he alerted it although i am not sure|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, Ralf|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|frm: The opponents cards are well placed for a ceossruff, and now they have missed the opportunity to lead trumps twice. So now it is a make!|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|pelu: but if u open 1@C what will u bid in next round - then 1NT would be 15-17|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes. I think they can show good support and 4 cards, this was not good enough|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|pelu: alert = I had made a bad bid :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  @H 2 from blakset now |pg||
nt|stigw: Club continuation might have been better.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dkkello:  one for me  at last|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hvaing bid only 2, North had an easy 4@s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dkkello:  hi and welcome fredrik MÃ¸rk   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Frederik   even  ..|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sommer: ..must have been something like: My 2@C bid was "serious"??|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hmm|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|dkkello:  and welcome our starcommentator  Peter Lund |pg||

pc|d7|pc|c6|nt|dkkello:  is 500 enough ?|pg||
nt|sommer: not now|pg||

nt|dkkello:  a @C back  or @D  |pg||

nt|pelu: did N lost count?|pg||
nt|snagolf: can't be what happened|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I see what you mean, but you have already upgraded to 12....|pg||
nt|stigw: It only come into force after an intervention from second hand, else everything "normal" I think.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  On bd 3, Schaltz did not interfere against the strong @c|pg||
nt|dkkello:  did it happend like that Andreas or are you joking   , wauw|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: i dont get why e-w keep bidding 3!n "overseeing" their major fits each time|pg||
nt|dkkello:  ok see you|pg||
nt|stigw: No, did he misread it ?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: didi Martin play @S here??|pg||
nt|snagolf: well ... take them then|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  K9xxx , hmm   |pg||
nt|frm: He should have thrown a club instead of a spade, when he cashed the jack of hearts!|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sommer: ok, looks like it|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dkkello:  it is so easy for us who can see all hands   ..|pg||
nt|sommer: but doesn't look like a Martin defence:)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|snagolf: They have had a great session. This is crux time for the partnership. Lars is not known for his easy going temper (at the table) .. he is fuming even if he shouldn't be|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dkkello:  and wedensday night at the local club , bridge is difficult again |pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 4@H..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Blakset like many others are 2 diferent persons when they hold 13 cards in hand or not  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Bilde showing great maksimum  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  3 @D transfer of course|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|pelu: would u pass with AK + A - no :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: how often do u really downgrade? like one every 10000 board?:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no, but open 1@c|pg||
nt|stigw: Interesting to see if that makes a difference in bd. 3.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: With no interferince they only ended in 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwa: bidding did go like that|pg||

nt|dkkello:  transfer|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|snagolf: isn't this unmanagable?|pg||

nt|dkkello:  even they could have done even better|pg||
nt|dkkello:  badly|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 500 it was :)|pg||
nt|sommer: ok, A, tnx|pg||

nt|vugraphzwa: they get 3 hours for 22 boards|pg||

nt|vugraphzwa: one would think.. but this table needs to play 4 boards with this one in 15 minuts time to be on schedual|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South having shown the shape and 5-8 HCP|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sommer: S will be shortened in trumps on the table for the next @S..and should go one down|pg||
nt|dkkello:  is it betting time again?|pg||
nt|sommer: my bet is -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: Cant you just keep play @d now?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: But also some agreement with your partner|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|snagolf: Should E have unblocked?!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dkkello:  dosent matter|pg||
nt|sommer: .. or -2 even|pg||
nt|sommer: The Western jury has voted: "Down"!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he could have gone home on a @D to ruff  @S him selv |pg||
nt|sommer: ..how many @S' could he ruff?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 |pg||
nt|sommer: ok..that makes a total of 9|pg||
nt|dkkello:  better than 8 :)|pg||
nt|sommer: agree|pg||
nt|dkkello:  claiming time |pg||
pc|h2|nt|dkkello:  Man C - Man U  0-2   , he he|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sommer: wow..Dennis WANTS -1|pg||
nt|sommer: ..-2|pg||
nt|snagolf: Courageously played by Dennis|pg||
nt|dkkello:  typical Bilde to underlead AKxxx in clubs but i think he knows what he is doing ..|pg||
pc|h3|nt|skaftij:  "Your points were good" Askgaard said|pg||
nt|stigw: So the lesson from board 3 is, that you shouldnt interfere atall versus strong cl ? - I dont believe that, they must have had a seldom misunderstanding|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't think so.|pg||
nt|stigw: Or maybe they dont play strong cl ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: yes they do:)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  North learnt the shape but no @sAQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dkkello:  but we are here to find the contentens for the Danish national team , any conclusion at this very early point?   |pg||
nt|pelu: 3 hours and 7 min would be the normal time - remember +1 minut pr. boards when u are playing with sceens|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm|pg||
pc|c5|nt|snagolf: NS have played solid .. but ... ahemmmm .. we are 7½ boards into the first session|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: had 11 went for 12 and back to 10 :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stigw: I looked at the bidding which was crypted by artificial relays, and something must have gone wrong for them.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  No, South might have had @dQ  and @cQ in 5 points|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dkkello:  ok we can come back to that later!  |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|dkkello:  he does torture his opponents here by not claiming   |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|skaftij:  From what I gather|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|stigw: Thats one of the "dangers" in playing a "perfect but complicated" system or convention. Lets forget it for now.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|pelu: if in slam u take 12 trick - @s 3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: remember also.. 1!N takes so much more room then 1@C does|pg||

nt|vugraphzwa: Clemmensen returned a @D insted of a @s to give him the overtrick back |pg||
nt|dkkello:  15 min to go in that match  |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|snagolf: down 2½|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure - ALL weak NT-opernes open 1NT|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Slow dealer, is it you Stig?|pg||
nt|stigw: E/W seems to have done rather well here, but I'm afraid they are about to lose heavily in the end. Lets see.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|pelu: 2@S = 10-13|pg||
nt|dkkello:  lucky make here  in 3   nt |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|stigw: Looking at this bidding from an alient planet might seem natural !!!|pg||
nt|frm: The only possible game for N-S seems to be 4 Spades but repeated attacks in heart seems to be difficult to handle!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @D  forcing to game|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|snagolf: not the dummy he had hoped for|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|skaftij:  1@s=8-14BAL or 5+@h 12+.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: a small @S is now safe against 4-1 in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2NT = max and 3 card @S, but N not interested |pg||
pc|s3|nt|stigw: Its not so interesting to know the meaning of these bids, but they will surely end up right in 4 H or 3 nt I guess.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Rest is relay from North and mystery|pg||
nt|stigw: Nort might consider more than 4 H, but slam is no good proposition here atall.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I'll drink a beer to that|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|dkkello:  but that is often what you buy  ..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  on the flop  |pg||
nt|snagolf: still down 2 .. W will have his @H9 uppercutted|pg||
nt|sommer: you win in poker too?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  NO|pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|stigw: If South sp AK were in other places, it would be quite another matter.|pg||
nt|pelu: and I dont like to break the trtansfer on a hand with only 1 Ace|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|stigw: Anders probably had extras here, but in the wrong place, so good to pass.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2+ 0 + 5 + 3  ?  am i tired   ot what  |pg||
nt|frm: Yes - but it´s not so easy to bid with 9xxx opposite a singleton x in hearts.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  never open without the 9 of @H   |pg||
nt|ralfwil: If defence plays 2 rounds oc @h to start with 4@s is made on a crossruff|pg||
pc|h2|nt|frm: Yes (about 4 Spades on a crossruff)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  still I think i would pas the North hand in  st position  , but I maybe are to old  |pg||
nt|frm: We are all blind. The defence just have 5 hearttricks!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  C-U   0-3   rooney  |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|sommer: he'll go 2 light, right - despite he has a dd chance to survive -1|pg||
