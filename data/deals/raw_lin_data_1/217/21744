nt|Vugraphzps: true Roland :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxb: we ll play 8 sessions of 16 boards each and the winners will play in the final after 15 days|pg||
nt|chrisky: a very good result in closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphzxb: greetings from alati|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: i never saw that :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She looked like a 27 year old|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxb: the result of the  other match is known only after the end of each session|pg||
nt|chrisky: 5@C go down too|pg||
nt|andyv:  an impatient michaels bid|pg||
nt|roussol: spectacular:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: a modern 1 @s opening|pg||
nt|chrisky: yes if @dQJ was @S then ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  various ways to play 2@s here...either showing a stopper or, if un. vs. un, showing a game forcing raise in @cs or @ds|pg||
nt|andyv:  E will bid 2NT unless 2@s is game forcing for them |pg||
nt|andyv:  N can get the brass ring here by bidding 3@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@c by E is 2+|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, little reason to do that since S showed the majors|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|hedyg: very usual in Italy, thus 2@c by Fantoni|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12 tricks on any lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: slam hand here with ( 21)  working points |pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@H with the W hand|pg||
nt|eleni: right Lina:):) again 1 of those hands:):)|pg||
nt|roussol: most of the hands will be like this from this morning on|pg||

pc|d6|pg||

nt|andyv:  not sure about that|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have tried 3@H first?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|hT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give South @DK instead of @HA and slam can't make. 4@S seems reasonable|pg||

nt|chrisky: 11 imps back for eidi|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|runnerup: to be honest not easy to bid -even thougth it looks quite alrigth -because bidding shows @d king in north or @c lead comes anyway|pg||
nt|doctorone: Agree, Roland... A relatively lucky slam... One of your's? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have adopted a new strategy for 2012|pg||
nt|hedyg: which is?|pg||

nt|hedyg: identical bids in CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzxb: each table plays different boards for security reasons|pg||
nt|chrisky: yes but if you duck the @H woh has the A@D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  decent 4@s contract that goes off|pg||
nt|chrisky: we have a new leader...............|pg||
nt|roussol: +2 imps|pg||

nt|andyv:  without the double, you can probably set 3NT as the A@d could be in either hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: wow, fine lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: not very good game here |pg||
nt|hedyg: so Roland, what about this slam?|pg||
nt|doctorone: No game seems available here for EW, despite 25 HCP combined... NS will find the @d swtich at time.. Or even the lead !!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: slam?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think the alert of pass was a misclick|pg||
nt|hedyg: Helena?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxb: no, pass was allerted|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think 4@S is overbit|pg||
nt|chrisky: if he bits 3@c then trouble is on|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: though on a @c lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphzxb: it was allerted as forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile, the question is if N is clairvoyant enough to see that the A of @d is off side|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, that was unexpected|pg||
nt|andyv:  N must not like playing 4-3 fits|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|andyv:  4@s was about a 50% game|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|chrisky: i dont think he will be -3 so some imps back|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eleni: Basilis Broustis decided to lead his Q@c so there was time to set up the @d for the overtrick|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You all agree with @D10? I mean, if you think partner has led 4th best, would declarer not have put up the queen from dummy if he had Ax?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hellas:  yes due to the @d placement|pg||
pc|h6|nt|doctorone: Difficult play for N here to go up with the K, though declarer may have played dummy's Q if holding the A|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chrisky: i think better was to play @S to the A and a @D from dumy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|doctorone: LOLL Roland... u still faster !|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  but was there a reason for N not bidding at least 3@s or even doubling 3@h and letting partner make a decision?|pg||

nt|andyv:  sorry, the @d suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure why N decided to stayman here...hand isn't good enough to invite game and too good to garbage|pg||
