nt|Vugraphzps: true Roland :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxb: we ll play 8 sessions of 16 boards each and the winners will play in the final after 15 days|pg||
nt|chrisky: a very good result in closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphzxb: greetings from alati|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i never saw that :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She looked like a 27 year old|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzxb: the result of the  other match is known only after the end of each session|pg||
nt|chrisky: 5@C go down too|pg||
nt|andyv:  an impatient michaels bid|pg||
mb|2S!|an|stopper|nt|hedyg: a modern 1 @s opening|pg||
nt|chrisky: yes if @dQJ was @S then ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  various ways to play 2@s here...either showing a stopper or, if un. vs. un, showing a game forcing raise in @cs or @ds|pg||
nt|andyv:  E will bid 2NT unless 2@s is game forcing for them |pg||
nt|andyv:  N can get the brass ring here by bidding 3@d|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3N|nt|hedyg: 1@c by E is 2+|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, little reason to do that since S showed the majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: very usual in Italy, thus 2@c by Fantoni|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12 tricks on any lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: slam hand here with ( 21)  working points |pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@H with the W hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|hedyg: not X|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no negative freebids on the 3 level, 3@H forcing|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|andyv:  N will be disappointed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chrisky: still it goes down|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c seems to have cost too much space|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure about that|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s5|pc|c2|nt|hedyg: he could have tried 3@H first?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s6|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Give South @DK instead of @HA and slam can't make. 4@S seems reasonable|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  S will have to get N in twice to lead @hs|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Also, there must not be a heart ruff|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  however, if E had ducked the first @h, this could not be set|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d3|pc|s8|nt|chrisky: 11 imps back for eidi|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|runnerup: to be honest not easy to bid -even thougth it looks quite alrigth -because bidding shows @d king in north or @c lead comes anyway|pg||
nt|doctorone: Agree, Roland... A relatively lucky slam... One of your's? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have adopted a new strategy for 2012|pg||
nt|hedyg: which is?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I only bid the slams that make|pg||
nt|doctorone: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes that is a completely new strategy|pg||
nt|chrisky: 2A @d AND @s|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|andyv:  now it will make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  maybe...lol|pg||
pc|d8|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  now @d back|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS had to get 3@h tricks...S should have been aware of this and kept all his @hs|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|hedyg: 4@H and 5@d were making in EW so 4@s good sac|pg||

nt|andyv:  @h pitch by S was very expensive.  E not ducking 1st @h trick could have been just as expensive|pg||
nt|chrisky: duck 2 times the @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzxb: TD was called|pg||
nt|andyv:  then S will have to set up the 9th trick for declarer in order to get back to partner for a 3rd  @h lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzxb: different explanation for 2spades bid|pg||

nt|hedyg: identical bids in CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzxb: each table plays different boards for security reasons|pg||
nt|chrisky: yes but if you duck the @H woh has the A@D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  decent 4@s contract that goes off|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|andyv:  N|pg||
nt|andyv:  the double tells you all you need to know|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|hedyg: 3@d not everybodies bid, even white vs red|pg||
nt|andyv:  without the double, you can probably set 3NT as the A@d could be in either hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: wow, fine lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: not very good game here |pg||
nt|hedyg: so Roland, what about this slam?|pg||
nt|doctorone: No game seems available here for EW, despite 25 HCP combined... NS will find the @d swtich at time.. Or even the lead !!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: slam?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think the alert of pass was a misclick|pg||
nt|hedyg: Helena?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxb: no, pass was allerted|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think 4@S is overbit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: ok ty, no explanation?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: @D|pg||
nt|doctorone: 6@d NS you meant Hedy? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: though on a @c lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphzxb: it was allerted as forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile, the question is if N is clairvoyant enough to see that the A of @d is off side|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, that was unexpected|pg||
nt|andyv:  N must not like playing 4-3 fits|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hellas:  always -1 un 4@s|pg||
nt|hellas:  in|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s was about a 50% game|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|hedyg: i doubt they would have ever gotten to slam without the 3@D opening|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: You all agree with @D10? I mean, if you think partner has led 4th best, would declarer not have put up the queen from dummy if he had Ax?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hellas:  yes due to the @d placement|pg||
pc|s5|nt|doctorone: Difficult play for N here to go up with the K, though declarer may have played dummy's Q if holding the A|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|doctorone: LOLL Roland... u still faster !|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|andyv:  but was there a reason for N not bidding at least 3@s or even doubling 3@h and letting partner make a decision?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: Roland is like Lucky Luke...|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I would bid the laydown grand slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: last year Roland would have bid it..|pg||
nt|doctorone: hehehe... Happy new 2012 :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Rabbi Roland?|pg||
mb|1N!|an|12-14|nt|andyv:  a safe contract reached in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@H 5@H +4m, weak|pg||
mb|2C|nt|runnerup: i think in practice you can play 6+1 after expected @d K out|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: or not?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|doctorone: What would you bid as W in response to 1@h after initial pass? Is 3@c fit bid your choice?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: Manos, do you know what they play?|pg||
nt|mathat: YES|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange pass by N then|pg||
nt|mathat: NOWS THE PRT|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  here again, 3N depends on picking up the @c suit but with this vul, the percentage should be a bit better that 50%|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, the @d suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure why N decided to stayman here...hand isn't good enough to invite game and too good to garbage|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  judging from the pause, N may be wondering the same thing|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|hedyg: 3@c is stayman, maybe puppet for EW|pg||
nt|chrisky: how many @H for e/w?|pg||
nt|chrisky: wow|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow, that is a pretty unilaterly decision...i guess they don't mind playing in 3-2 fits|pg||
nt|andyv:  unilateral|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|bmkl: only 2|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c showing good @cs and 4@hs|pg||
