nt|vugraphzvu: Hi all, this is Rob, your VuGraph operator|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: Crouch and Patterson play fairly unusual methods, ill try and keep you informed|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: NS presumably playing S.A.Texas for the alert|pg||
mb|4S|nt|clinch: Thanks Basil|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb:  Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Douglas Piper and Alex Wilkinson for Scotland; Peter Crouch and Derek Patterson for England|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|oosmanb:  2@D was multi. 4@C was : Bid one UNDER your major, and then South can declare it|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Playing 4@C this way, (and 4@D = bid your major) allows responder to protect his holdings|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eamongall: Good evening folks |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eamongall: Here we have Michael McDonagh and James Heneghan representing Ireland |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|clinch: Not exactly sure what 1@h alert was|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: 3 nt oluyor|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: yes, 4@c would show a stronger hand with @h|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eamongall: and Peter Goodman a regular visitor to Dublin (maybe he lives here) ...but afraid I don't know Pownall in person |pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzvu: could have been 3 apparently|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: according to the system file 3+ @H or 5+H if GF|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eamongall: McDonagh  has represented Ireland in the recent past at Senior level with Pat McDevitt ... I think Heneghan is making his debut here for Ireland |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|clinch: Some guesses in the red suits here - first was wrong|pg||
nt|clinch: On the weak jump overcall, heart king is very likely to be with East now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h5|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|clinch: A club from Wilkison would have been interesting, but didn't happen|pg||
nt|clinch: n|pg||
nt|clinch: Patterson now can't afford to lose two heart tricks; he will probably exit with a diamond and Piper will be somewhat stuck for an exit card|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|eamongall: he will make this contract but he may not see 9 tricks just yet |pg||

nt|yo_yo: Great bid there by Hrolfur|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Point counters might only bid 2@S|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|eamongall: of course we can all see @S finesses and endplays with @C but this is teams and over a 32 board match an imp here or there is less crucial then going down in a game |pg||
mb|1S|nt|clinch: Part-score hand now; EW make 3@s; NS 4@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 2D is either 6+ D no 4cM and 10-13 or 5-9 with 4+D and a 5cM|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|d|nt|eamongall: In the other room they start with board 15-16 to allow some comparisions in at least one room |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: Robson..head in hands now...what to lead|pg||
nt|clinch: so 4@s is actually a good save against 4@d|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks Basil|pg||
mb|p|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: fazla söylediler biraz :)|pg||
mb|r|nt|eamongall: I am still looking for mcDonaghs hand on this board :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|eamongall: 3rd hand light they say :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: It was making, but S revoked..|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now is 3NT a slam try?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: IF so, Wrang is interested|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|eamongall: but with @Ds as NS resting place they probably have saved Wales from a tonk|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|clinch: Must resist the temptation to play K@d here|pg||
nt|clinch: Patterson's 2of @h probably encouraging, but length still ambiguous|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: yes, he might have to guess which red suit card to try and cash|pg||
nt|clinch: He certainly does|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: automatic 1@H I am told by Mikes next trials partner |pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 3Nt probably asked singleton, pass shows interest so Wrang could bid on. Excellent sequence|pg||

mb|p|nt|emre kaya: ooo kontur geldi NS ekip için kötü skor olacak|pg||
nt|ady: they may well reach 6@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  strong 1@c nebulous 1@d - not dissimilar to the EW system|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: suppose I could go get a convention card |pg||
nt|eamongall: well as 2@Hs is forcing he will be in game |pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Allfrey now wondering what to lead|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  presumably North's 2@c showed @d|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Hello David|pg||
nt|ady: club lead   stiil a chance  as East will have to play the 10|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|clinch: 3NT is easy here with diamonds breaking|pg||
nt|frankaus: a mere 28C today - we thinks thats cool 4 our summer|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: later a club towards the J9X may enable declarer to establish a 2nd club trick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW for Wales are Paul Denning-Patrick Shields|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  their system is http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/DenningShields.pdf|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  West knows that dummy is short in @h|pg||
nt|ady: now will make    not clear for Denning to make an attacking lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though this has not been the weekend for trump leads|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if Forrester is West in the other room, there will not be a trump lead there even if the contract is the smae|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can ruff a @h in dummy |pg||

pc|c8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eamongall: afraid several Irish kibitzers totally disagree with me thinking 4@Hs is plausible |pg||
pc|s6|nt|clinch: This won't take long; will duck a couple of spades then bang down the AK of diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yorkbeach:  he can cater for 4@d with West by cashing a top honour and l;ater leading the ten, ducking if West covers|pg||

nt|clinch: Not sure of EW system...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: strong club based|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|eamongall: this looks like a Tartan or Lucas 2@H bid by West |pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: South asking questions.....|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|emre kaya: 4 körde zor 4-3 e uzundan kýsalýnca|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks; I think both pairs play 1@c as strong, is that right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: e/w convention card says strong club precision style|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: and n/s says that they play delberto club|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: which is a system designed principally by Crouch i believe|pg||
nt|clinch: Delbert is Derek Patterson's nickname|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if NS reach 3NT, they will do well to play it from the South seat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|aramesh_:  Hello David-Welcome|pg||
nt|ady: Patterson decided to make the 2@C overcall   so 3NT easy to reach|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this will put the opening bidder, who is likley to have the sxK on lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS strong @C bu the look of it|pg||
pc|h7|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: partaj sorun yok|pg||
nt|ady: not well judged by South   4@H  well down  4@S should fail by one|pg||
nt|ady: thx Aramesh|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: think W will end up endplayed at trick 5|pg||
nt|ady: however   the wrong way up|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as it is, wrong sided|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @sK|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|eamongall: unfortunately for heneghan this 5 level is a phantom |pg||
nt|clinch: So strong club or not, NS end up playing in 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: unless he can find the 8 of diamonds now?|pg||
nt|frankaus: using strong @C u can open with that collection|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 3 spades probably shows normal opening values with 4s as a raise to 2s often will show 3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|clinch: Best continuation|pg||
nt|clinch: Not room for much more in East's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: hes still going to get enplayed repeatedly though isnt he, Crouch can just exit diamonds |pg||
pc|d5|nt|timb: Interesting 4@S bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer holds up one round in the faint hope of a 7-2 spade split|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|timb: I would defend 4@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|emre kaya: ben 3 pik demeyi tercih ederdim koray abinin eliyle|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: Allfrey 2@S normally shows a liking for hearts but not for spades   when in fact his spades were better than his hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: South offering a prayer for his miracle spade lie|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT might fail even from the South seat|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: however   shoud Denning find the bright lead of K  or J of spades  the defence would prevail|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yorkbeach:  yes a low spade would block the suit|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|eamongall: ah now it becomes clear ... a kib mentioned 6@Ds on board 1 .... making in Open Room off the 2 cashing @HS |pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

mb|1S!|nt|sverjohn: Expect the result to be duplicated|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ady: if so  wonder what action if any Robson?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: sorry I was looking at the wrong hand when talking of 6@Ds ... am corrected ..it just needed several finesses :) |pg||
nt|ady: Robson did not want to go quietly|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  when two strong club pairs play each other, much can depend upon which pair has the good cards|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  1@h = 4+@s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   around the limit or 5@C|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|eamongall: probably not the best board to hunt down 2@Hs on ..and South has moved on |pg||
nt|eamongall: should be able to make plenty of tricks in 4@S or 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: he has now...without too much thought|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, maybe misled somewhat by heart discards...South could always make by playing on hearts if he reads the club length correctly|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: true, he said after the hand that he should have played A and another club when E played one through|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: a bit messy all round i think|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  (1@s would have shown 4+@h)|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: bakalým 4 kör veya 3 nt oynucaklar|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: This looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: again a light open - made poss by strong @C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzvu: should be a flat board|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  after the strong @c opening and positive response, North's pass is forcing|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|ady: 1 spade would not have gone well    but only fifty's|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: lose 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and nothing else|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|ady: yes   120|pg||
nt|clinch: Aggressive raise by Patterson if Crouch showed 18-20|pg||

nt|clinch: Giving up the whole suit|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C   fpr e/w    more if no heart lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yorkbeach:  sorry to keep going on about it - but you have to beat right when you lead a trump - otherwise it is a mistake|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: 2@C forcing  alerted|pg||
nt|clinch: That one also looks quite normal, although most of us would have started with 2NT, followed by a bit of something Staymanic|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  be right|pg||
mb|3S|nt|emre kaya: 4 pike gelecekler|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: tht Allfrey might have shown diamonds at this point|pg||
nt|clinch: This 2@h bid was seen also last hand|pg||
nt|clinch: This time finds a major suit fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: its exciting to see something other than stayman and transfers|pg||
nt|ady: may reach 4@S     though an easy 11 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play for 6@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you avoid a @h loser, just the @cA to lose|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like the italian intermediate 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: bidding is pointing towards a heart lead   so better stop in game|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: I think 1C was conventional|pg||
nt|ady: ok   so 1@C had not promised clubs|pg||
nt|timb: The splinter should slow things down!|pg||
nt|timb: 1@C usually balanced or clubs|pg||
nt|timb: I think|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eamongall: good choice by Peter Goodman to remain quiet as Heneghan surely would have got noisy over @Hs |pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  no - shows @d|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|timb: I'm told it can be a singleton too - as in two obsolete systems I can think of, Vienna and NSW |pg||
nt|ady: danger here|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: dont think delberto will take too long with this one|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzvu: with the K@S lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is about to find out that South's second suit is spades|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yorkbeach:  and this sequence has protected the @dAQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is sure to look for a slam once he finds out South's second suit is spades rather than clubs|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|clinch: :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe I should have said 'if' rather than 'once' :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: not clear if 3@s is systemically 3+@s or exactly 3...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if North uses RKCB with @h inferentially agreed, the response will reveal 2 key cards missing|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: I *think* 3@s has shown exactly 3@s as N bid 2N, not 2@s|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: must assume 4NT in this sequence not rkc|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 4N was asking something...impossible to read the Robson scrawl|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yorkbeach:  South may be trying to work out whether 4@s is a cue with @h agreed or an attempt to play there|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it seems 4@s was a keycard ask, so 4NT = 1 or 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Crouch did write he *thought* 4@s is RKCB, so we may be in the unknown here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: not suprising with Robson having 2 small of a suit not bid or cu bid|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  using the bid at the 4 level one denomination above the trump suit is kickback|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: though he has confirmed N should not have 4@s on the bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so 4@s is the ask with @h agreed, 4@h with @d agreed etc|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play will be quick here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 2 England gained 2 IMPs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|timb: This should be quick - a DT&C deal (Draw Trumps and Claim)|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  at the start of the match Wales and England were died for the lead with 74 VPs each|pg||
nt|sverjohn: So did the raise|pg||
mb|1N|nt|clinch: Brave lead - Piper clearly thought something aggressive was needed.... sometimes one can just tell from bidding tempo that a contract is likely to be comfortable|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: NS 2 kör yapar puaný fazla olan Ew ne oynasa batar durumda|pg||
nt|ady: obson opened|pg||
nt|ady: a bit light|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  the result of this match will therefore determine which team leads at the end of the weekend|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|clinch: The system? No - as I say, I think Delbert is Derek's nickname - he is from Kent|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  remember this is the first weekend of a two weekend event, so we will not have an actual winner |pg||
nt|ady: do you know the score for Wales and England Julian?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tied for the lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzvu: no, i meant the nickname|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, that's my guess, that it is named in his honour :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: haha, im really struggling to get my question across. How come derek is nicknamed delbert|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 1NT alerted here as Drury available. Also denies 3@s|pg||

nt|clinch: Ah, no - that I don't know|pg||

nt|frankaus: some may bid  2NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: over 2@S|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
pc|h5|nt|timb: I was asked whether I wound want to be in 6NT when 6@D is easier |pg||

nt|ady: 6@D must be better    there may often be a lay when 6NT fails|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|eamongall: but 5@Hs made less tricks in other room so 12 imps back ... personally I think that board should have been played in 4@S unmolested in both rooms ... an old bridge player used to ...|pg||

pc|s5|nt|sverjohn: 1D showed hearts and 1H 3-card supp.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|emre kaya: 2 nt 18-19|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT a bit pushy|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: director telling them  they are 10 mins behind...|pg||
nt|timb: I think he would make it for sure if it was a double dummy problem; however...|pg||
nt|ady: 16 opposite 7 with no good fit|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|emre kaya: dbl deyip 1nt demek normal sanzatu puaný|pg||
nt|emre kaya: limitler çok az deðiþebililir sadece |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|timb: West will be reduced to black cards and be endplayed in clubs|pg||
nt|ady: A@C   and that may be the lot|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: Allfrey has 2 stops  in diamonds so this looks doomed|pg||
pc|c7|nt|clinch: 10 tricks in spades is all about avoiding 2 trump losers, and there is a standard safety play;|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|emre kaya: güzel oynadý rua trefi|pg||
nt|emre kaya: boþlamak iyi bunu ama yine yapar|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZVH: dam gelince iþler kolay|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|ady: south entries are bad|pg||
pc|s9|nt|timb: he can play another diamond if he likes or play on clubs as he has now|pg||
nt|ady: he needs to make 2 clubs 3 spades 2 hearts and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|timb: Most likey (eventually) West will endplay dummy with a club and declarer will endplay East with a diamond for a heart return|pg||
nt|timb: Then declarer runs @SJ; he makes 3 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds and 2 clubs|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|emre kaya: kör asý çizildi galiba:)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|timb: Now the defence can prevail|pg||
nt|timb: declarer needed to play diamonds first.|pg||
nt|ady: this may well be a swing if made   and as often happens the 2@H bid by Allfrey carries risk and helps opponents if they play|pg||
nt|timb: a heart now is fatal|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzvu: is it small to the Q on the first round?|pg||
nt|clinch: play small from E and cover the card of S, or play ace if he shows out|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|nurkumkale: merhaba herkese|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|sK|pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|clinch: catering for 3-0 either way|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|timb: down two; playing a third round of @Ds early would have made the contract.|pg||
nt|ady: something wrong with that order of play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: no...Allfrey forgot to cash spades....but director called|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: I mean hearts|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Should have played diamonds bfore ace of spades|pg||

nt|VUGRAPHZVH: yessss|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZVH: %10 gibi aldýlar|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: claim on who had the @cA|pg||
nt|ady: may be a decent score for wales  as 5@C  only down 1 for n/s last hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: so either +1 or +2|pg||
nt|sverjohn: So the score on board 4 was wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|timb: After @CK held, declarer needed to concede a @D; then he's in on @HQ he plays a @C to the Q and concedes a club. West then has to lead a spade.!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: monster 25 hcp with east    may well play in 3NT going down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the way the cards lie, I cannot see a making game anywhere|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|clinch: Useful bid to have, that 2NT!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: yes, the n/s system file has had plenty of work. you can regualarly find this n/s pair practising partnership bidding on bbo|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East will insist on reaching game of course|pg||
mb|2C|nt|clinch: Looks as though 4@h will be reached here; 4@s a good save|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and be hoping for a slam if West has a fit|pg||
nt|ady: 2 spades 2nd negative?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Wales in 3@S on board 8 ... might be a make but will not be -300|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  we think 2@h is either @h or a balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: This is Rob, your operater|pg||
mb|2S|nt|emre kaya: eðer özel bir anlaþma yoksa bu sekansta 2 kör 5 li kör 4 lü pik davet eli gösteriyor|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts preference    4H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: 2@S deseydi 5 li pik 4 lü kör olacaktý|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Good result for the icelanders here|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 2C pobably shows additional values, 2D asking|pg||
nt|sverjohn: probably|pg||
mb|4S|nt|emre kaya: 3 seviyesinde ise 3@H 4 lü kör 5li pik|pg||
nt|emre kaya: 3@S 4lü pik 5li kör olacaktý|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZVH: vay emre smolen öðrenmiþ :)|pg||
nt|nurkumkale: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|emre kaya: hehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: again a nice easy 4@H for derek|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: difficult to see how this can make on this lay   only 7 tricks |pg||
pc|hT|nt|clinch: It looks as though just playing small from either hand would be ok as safety play on prior hand - key is not to bang down the ace!|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Interesting contract|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yorkbeach:  when East bid 3@d, he said 2@h was hearts, with @d a second suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North does not know that East's spades are AK10|pg||
nt|ady: maybe an 8th now?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|emre kaya: ama bu el davete sokmamalýydý bence köre transfer edip býrakmasý lazýmdý|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a switch to the @sQ looks reasonable|pg||
nt|ady: best a club back   put east to a discard now|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|emre kaya: belki öðrenmek isteyenler vardýr çaðrý hocam seyircilerimiz arasýnda:)|pg||
nt|timb: That was painless for South|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, 4@s will be 1 or 2 off, depending on whether NS can establish a club trick quickly enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: yes, but your way best, as then you dont needless lose a trick when the suit is nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: stiff king with S or something|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzvu: found the bad news...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: now east can likely get the 8th in the end game|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yorkbeach:  NS defensive signals are usually reverse attitude but can be standard, so the 7 would be discouraging or an even number|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|nurkumkale: þu anda defansta olmak istemezdim atak kötü olmuþ yerde bu kadar çýktý|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|sverjohn: Can still make it on a red suit squezze|pg||

nt|ady: north now keeping club for a later exit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|sT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|yorkbeach:  Wales are on the scoreboard with a 1 IMP pick up on 6|pg||
nt|ady: but eventually  either side will have to play a  2nd spade|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Pownall-Goodman did not bid a slam but they did have the mechanism to find their solid 4-4 @s fit :)|pg||
nt|ady: all seems to lead to down 1|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Should be routine for a player of Uppmarks standard, or rather ruffing out the heart ace|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Diamond to the jack and then it does not matter wihch heart he plays|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h9|nt|emre kaya: þimdi pik vericek batýracaklar|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yorkbeach:  England have gained 4 IMPs on 7 - Forrester-Gold found the sacrifice in 5@d doubled, which was down only 500 against the vulnerable heart game|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
