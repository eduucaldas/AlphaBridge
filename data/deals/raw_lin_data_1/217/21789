nt|vugraphzwf: Ok, we've had a techical problem, which has been fixed now. We will put in the scores for the first two boards.|pg||

nt|cuttysark:  Hi all. Lots of people playing Multi-Landy in this position over a 1N overcall |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  welcome to the final stanza of the first weekend of the 2012 Camrose|pg||
mb|5C|nt|roswolf: hi Liz|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Think i would pass 2S, but rex disagrees|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|yorkbeach:  NS for England are David Gold and Tony Forrester|pg||

pc|dK|nt|yorkbeach:  2@c was either weak with @d or a strong hand|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|clinch: Robson needs to get Allfrey in to lead a trump to maximise the NS score...would have involved underleading his heart|pg||

nt|roswolf: this may be fun|pg||
nt|clinch: Strong chance of a double game swing there|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Robson says he got the hand wrong because AA led the 7 of clubs, not the low one he should have done from his holding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@c was probably down one, so no great harm for Wales|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|roswolf: strong club auction|pg||
nt|clinch: Ah|pg||
nt|clinch: club was an excellent lead|pg||
nt|clinch: but not the seven, apparently!|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will feel he should have made that|pg||

nt|roswolf: 5@C may be bid here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that East did not rebid 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 3@h|pg||
nt|clinch: Also 5@c, so EW needed to bid 5@h....as did NS on the prior hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well south has won the auction|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Greenwood would do very well to come again|pg||
pc|dK|nt|golfsquash: 3@c on but south would compete to 3! which makes|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlucky heart finesse wrong|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|clinch: To defeat 5@h it looks as though N has to lead his stiff ace, then underlead his club ace|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzvu: s thinking about continuation|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yorkbeach:  the dxK-10 doubleton would have made atacking @d succesful but declarer would not visualise such a friendly layout|pg||

nt|clinch: Two hands with huge potential already, the IMPometer may be ticking over soon|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|clinch: A grand slam here, though not for the opening bidder!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: another very exciting hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: I think we can classify Robson's opening as weak :)|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@s a bit strong....|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: e/w play 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and inverted minors, even with overcall|pg||

nt|roswolf: DENYING 4 SPADES i think|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North has a constructive weak 2@s available|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the 2@d Multi shows a weaker hand|pg||

pc|hT|nt|roswolf: in for a penny in for a pound|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have raised to 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: S checking lead styles|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h7|nt|yorkbeach:  in 3rd seat I am not sure of the need to make the distinction - perhaps it helps partner judge whether to save|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East might have wanted to bid 2NT after the double to show two places to play|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but perhaps he thought West would take it as natural|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|yorkbeach:  defenders will need to play @c eraly to stop the overtrick|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|golfsquash: much harder to bid game if west opens strong NT|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm so far so good|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: Sorry i can't explain more..it's very murky here|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl showing long spades and @D tolerance?|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S weak raise - good raise via 2@H|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@s bid on last is understandable, but surely EW had some kind of double-then-bid type of auction available|pg||

pc|s8|nt|roswolf: hmm imaginative keepinf his clubs concealed|pg||
nt|r_prah: NS reached a sensible 3NT, although 6@C or 6@D has the virtue of making as the cards lie|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|golfsquash: and then play in 2@d or 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: S asking about the 3D bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: east doesnt give up|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cuttysark:  Lucky 3-3 heart break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: auction on previous was something like 2@h-(2!n)-3@h..........4@h(S)-(X)-end|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS have done well to diagnose the misfit and stop at a safe level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if West has the @sA, declarer might set up the @d as the @sK will be an entry|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: got an explanation now, 3@C random game try, often with H and 3H is LT without 4@H|pg||

nt|marlowepi: The course followed by E here is not one I would expect to have a positive long-term track record. Certainly it is sensible to treat the hand as too promising for an initial 3C,, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially at these colors, but having bid 2C and heard partner pass you arent really going anywhere and further action rates to help the foe more than your own side|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi all|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|golfsquash: I believe 2@c is GF, even tho' the convention card doesn't say so|pg||

nt|clinch: The first double game swing on 17 came to pass for Scotland - 17 and 18 won't go their way, though|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS judged well to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  contract is makeable but declarer will need to reject @d finesse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  endplay might not work if diamonds were 2-2 but in that case taking the trump finesse does not help anyway|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think he can make this - He expects E to be 5-5-2-1 now after the auction and lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: so he wins this @C|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: robson says 1nt showed a major and a minor|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks Basil|pg||
nt|ady: close to making if ace and king of clubs would stand up|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N has the upside of making it a bit harder for EW to get together in spades, but with a strong club on one's left there is less likelihood foe will be seriously discomfited. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meanwhile it might well help the eventual declarer.  after all, if robson were to pass on this S hand at these colors, who would ever play him for this hand:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson still thinking|pg||
nt|clinch: After opening his 1 count on 19, who can blame him for entering with this monster?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: on bd 20 the endglish n/s conceded -1100 in a very dubious auction - 15 big imps back|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson states that they could be in a 3-0 fit and hes not sure on the auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can see only 5 top tricks and a shortage of entries to hand|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: the real upside of 1N with the S hand comes when W is strong and balanced while EW have a 44 spade fit, and N can do something dynamic over the pass (or NT bid) by W|pg||

pc|cK|nt|ady: defence will need to take care to get their diamond trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: he did roll his eyes somewhat when he picked it up|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  10 or 11 depending upon whether the @hQ scores|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|dburn: that @cQ was likely to be a defensive value, even if he couldn't cash any diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: the test you should apply is: will this contract go two down more often than it will make?|pg||
nt|roswolf: in my club an 18 count with KQx of trumps behind the bidder is an automatic double|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Crouch decides to open a packet of Boubon biscuits....not passing them round though|pg||
nt|dburn: if so, the IMP odds favour doubling it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E should play a low heart from hand ASAP to test S|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Return of the @HJ is suit preference for clubs|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: what about only one card higher than a 4? :P|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|golfsquash: last board might have been opened and e/w would make up to 10 tricks in spade partscore|pg||

nt|marlowepi: came into the world that way|pg||
nt|ady: defence can take 3 hearts  1 club   and at least 1 sspade|pg||
nt|r_prah: NS however have to defend accurately. Three rounds of hearts will allow declarer to discard his club|pg||
nt|r_prah: If North cashes the @CA, that should seal declarer's hopes|pg||

nt|marlowepi: and foes who seem to have spades so  are solid favorites to declare|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm your Law violated again David|pg||
nt|xenya: you need to have faith in partner to apply splinter here |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he should have done, but that's not the kind of thing to spring on partner in the middle of a Camrose match|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: true but this is a belly blow|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: continuing the preempt?  Or have wheels come off?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: short in spades and not too many hearts, so obstruction is likeliest to the the Primary Issue of the Deal|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|dburn: I mean, you rebid 2NT and then you splinter? unless partner knows you are a maniac, how can he work out that this is what you are doing?|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  an entry short to ruff the @c good and get back to the long one|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if East plays king other @s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but if he is not certain South has 6 spades, he could try to give us partner an overruff|pg||

pc|h8|nt|roswolf: yes relying on blind faith is always fraught|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: if N passed 2D, or S passed 2C, they would have landed on their feet. but of course both are far too disciplined to take unilateral action:)|pg||

nt|kemperg: with @SA onside made, but now 2 off, |pg||
nt|r_prah: I'm sure declarer must have ducked the @HQ, an obvious maneuver|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: now anything could happen|pg||
nt|roswolf: double!?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, especially if South can't overcall naturally in diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: the opening promises ZERO @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: so i think 2@D should be natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: hi roswolf|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: must come up fairly often, then - I mean, all hands have at least no diamonds|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: true but 3@D is in the zone|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks competitive|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Brian Short & David Walker|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like a routine game in @S and that EW won't be able to obstruct the auction sufficiently to get in the way|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: this is probably natural, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: western cue bids are not in fashion these days|pg||
nt|ady: just the 2 losers in spades   assuming a diamond lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the scots may have won the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: still a nce contract, bad luck for Anita|pg||

nt|golfsquash: pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 3nt too far fetched|pg||
nt|dburn: and if South bids 3@s as he might, the partnership should at least avoid 3NT, but...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...if he does that instead, Crouch may well lead a club and not a spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: which black suit will west lead|pg||
nt|ady: Robson will find an agreeable dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N presumably is a specific @S raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: alerted, but didnt say what|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW play 2NT as limit or better, so 3@s is a 4-card raise to 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dburn: since he knows Patterson doesn't have diamonds, so he is very likely to have clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D   shows hearts?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: spades looks natural|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it's not 100% - he may well lead spades anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||

nt|marlowepi: might just make four|pg||
nt|ady: apparantly 3@D   random game try|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's a vul overcall worth a random game try, what's h is minimum in this situation?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the fact that S has made a game try gives us a hint of what the lower limits of a vul overcall might be for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you beat me to it Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: he does have 3 tens|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT might have made on a @h lead|pg||
nt|r_prah: 246.5 Meters gained 11 IMPs on Board 22 when Jonsson and Baldursson appeared to have a misunderstanding about the meaning of a double|pg||
nt|r_prah: Meanwhile, a comfortable 3NT for EW here, not in any real jeopardy|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yorkbeach:  all may come down to guessing who has the @sJ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed quite possibly n/s in the other room may run ino problems|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: into|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: yes but when your opps hardly know what they are doing then opening leads are much more difficult|pg||
nt|ady: 4-0 trump split will stop the 12th trick on the non diamond lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: cant see why 4@H was not made in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: This was the last board of this round. We start again in 1 hour 15 minutes.|pg||
