nt|marlowepi: if S had turned the cube, very expensive|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|ahollan1: 3@S=normal opening, no shortage, up to bad 15 HCP|pg||
nt|marlowepi: same 2N call chosen in other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S!|nt|ahollan1: 4@S would show worst opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: as noted there, main advantantage of 2N would seem to be early disvovery of stiff club, if that is part of methods. but if not it can crowd auction|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: at least in this room west got a 2nd chance to bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: hans thinking ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operators should set up a quick key for that   "hans thinking"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holders of W hand would divide into adherents of 2N, 2C, and 4H|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 4H gobbles up a lot of space too, and would be poor idea unless you have useful agreements that splinters also gyaranee a control in any side suit that can no longer be cued below ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he game level|pg||
mc|11|nt|marlowepi: right Al, and i dont disagree. i would however note that when the partnership suit is spades, the urgency of announcing the fit immediately is somewhat reduced|pg||

mb|1N|nt|r_prah: Good Result for Travis in the other room on this board|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: i must admit i was also raised on being able to show side suit first|pg||
nt|bebechira: is this result correct Bruce?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: when ans where|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i was raised by wolves, and wolves dont bid clubs:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: hello|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 1N=strong then 2@D=1 suit  @H or @S   if 1N=weak  2@D=@S & another  [ASPRO]|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: which result?|pg||
nt|bebechira: on this board 31|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  1N=15-most 18|pg||
mb|2S|an| |mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2S presumably a relay to 2N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 3C is both minors INV?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: al usually knows, i like to guess:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would have thought  north bids as if RHO opened Multi 2@D   but the CC doesn't mention immediate 2@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|r_prah: NS here will be pleased to gain IMPs on this board, while they would be scared about missing their cold 5@C|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: i need to learn that system since it would allow me to declare when pd opens 1N:)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky stop|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sQ|pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: does 5C not make DD?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or in election year i should say     it seems to me that this was a lucky stop|pg||
nt|r_prah: This should seal the match in Travis' favor|pg||
