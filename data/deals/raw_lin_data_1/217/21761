nt|dkkello:  Jacob are you here?|pg||
nt|snagolf: Oh yes |pg||
nt|dkkello:  E-V just bids like John Wayne use to shoot  , but the standings , I will be back to that, must have an influence|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: it worked well with 4NT, finding 5@D, which has good chances to make|pg||
nt|dkkello:  6 strong danish pairs are playing a tournament , trying to make it to represent Denmark|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hi Andreas, helllo kibs|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|pelu: that lead sh make the play easy for Blakset|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This will be easy 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 7@S is on a finesse or if @h K is with the @c lengh at east a squizze is possible(@c at least 3-5)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hejsa|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all -|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: yes .. 3!n !n was not the bid of a lifetime|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a quick  slam to start with   |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: as I play is 6@c asking for extra values - for example long trimphsuit |pg||
pc|cK|nt|snagolf: he will huddle up .. worrying about a 3-1 @d break and the @h situation|pg||
nt|sommer: EW are playing together in the Danish 1st division - NS is a new constellation for the coming season|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Welcome to Stig Werdelin|pg||
nt|dkkello:  welcome Peter  |pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|pelu: play @hJ and ruff 2 @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont open 1 Nt with a 5 card major - I know that it is very normal to day, but here u see what can happen|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hi Ralf|pg||
nt|dkkello:  7 on a finesse   of course  |pg||
pc|s3|nt|dkkello:  south  http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=961|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: I would not blame East here though:)|pg||

nt|dkkello:  North:  http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=18002|pg||

pc|c8|nt|dkkello:  and East no photo ..|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Some players would have bid 3@s right away with South's hand, putting pressure on EW|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  declarer correctly inferring from the lead that spades are 33 (and needs that anyway) so going after dummys side suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  W unthrilled to be on lead|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: now easier to make 13 tricks than after a @d lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sommer: both pairs are coupled with "young" and "very experienced" players|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|marlowepi:  probably 2 down, which could be a small gain|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  W should bid here|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  even over 2C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: 3NT not so easy on @C-attack - 8 toptricks and need the @H-finess|pg||
nt|stigw: So it was special, because 4 sp has got chances.|pg||

nt|pelu: 3@C - no expl on CC|pg||

nt|dkkello:  south  http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=961|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sommer: while Kello is both serious and joking (as always), we here see a possible slam for EW|pg||
nt|snagolf: a very sneaky look at he opps cards and young Bilde can bid 7 @hs|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|dkkello:  No pictures of Vest  Gregers Bjarnasson |pg||
nt|ralfwil: What´s more commmon in denmark - Stenbergs or Jacoby´s 2nt?|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  well, E has helped NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: he changed his mind to 2@h:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwa: with a @c lead does 3@h not go down?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  last night we had a big debat about that subject  :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT easy make - but now EW are on thin ice|pg||
nt|dkkello:  we play something called bekkasin   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  almost the same  |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|snagolf: but they will end up in 4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: many play it as shortness and forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 3@c could be 4-5-3 in any way .. South would ussaly bid a major if he had one|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sommer: actually 6@D is a very fine slam|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I think theese 4 players are perhaps the aggresive bidders we have in this country?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the most aggresive|pg||
nt|stigw: Ougt to go down, but....|pg||
nt|pelu: not the first time this weekend :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|snagolf: but since he more or less i forced to double 2@hs it is very difficult to find when W has 3 card @h-supp|pg||
nt|sommer: well.. 2@S from S was influenced by the red zone...|pg||
nt|snagolf: t double 2@S of course|pg||

mb|p|nt|dkkello:  to reprersent your country you should know Blackwood !  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  brb   coffe time |pg||
mb|p|nt|snagolf: Young Dennis Bilde has a ftaher and an uncle who have represented Denmark on numerous occasions ... |pg||
nt|sommer: it wasn't necessary to bid 3@S to keep EW out of the slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: @s shift now will beat 3@d|pg||
nt|dkkello:  or steens 2 NT  , after Steen mÃ¸ller   showing maximum and shortage|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|pelu: no whisky time :)|pg||

nt|dkkello:  7 vs. an 18-19 NT no fit .. , if he gets away with this  ..  |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: i think i heard 2!n to be 20-22 though|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yeah whatever |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: ;)|pg||
nt|pelu: in Open we have the 2 pairs fighting for 1. place, and here a fight for 5. place - they are 5 and 6.|pg||

nt|dkkello:  why shouldent he smile ? opps just made mistakes 2 out of 2  sunday morning |pg||

nt|snagolf: the 2@H bid id drop dead .. choose a major |pg||
nt|snagolf: is|pg||

nt|dkkello:  yes John Wayne bidding filosofy seems to work just fine here |pg||
nt|pelu: remember B3 - in Open EW in 3NT|pg||

mb|2H|nt|sommer: 4@H NS is still coming|pg||
nt|dkkello:  thats what a call agreesive bidding  ( 2 @D)|pg||

nt|dkkello:  and a world class star from Sweden , good morning Mats Nisland quistion if 7 @S is a winner |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: after this bidding it might get dbl yes.. although if he opens 7@S then drawing the wrong ace could make it win and therefor no reason for dbl or?|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Difficult. If South is in chargem how would he know the North has 3@hs and not 3@Ds?|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Bilde thinks it is christmass eve again |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sommer: now what?|pg||
mb|1C!|an|2+|nt|sommer: "some" @S, NS|pg||
nt|snagolf: a @D sacrifice against either Game in M|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a lot actually |pg||
nt|snagolf: 4 in either M|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well 4@S can be beaten by east getting a @c ruff with @s A:)?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Bilde can hardly join the bidding   ?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes..a sacrifice from EW doesn't look obvious|pg||
nt|pelu: a small @C-lead would defeat 4@s - @c-ruff|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Martin has AKQJxxx not vulnerabel , he will make a lot of noise with this one |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: i think east at least non vull will bid in on anything on strong 1@c trying to get n-s out of balance|pg||
nt|stigw: Again the defence versus strong club makes things difficuklt for N/S.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  To those who may not know, Stig, an international champion, is renowned for his slow play.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  yes but small @C lead from V   , not first choice in real life |pg||

mb|2C!|nt|dkkello:  but they are maybe on the 4 level when it comes around  ?|pg||

nt|stigw: A nice sp-slam here, but hopefully they dont try 7 !|pg||
pc|c3|nt|stigw: Difficult hands to bid from all cormners except North, but I would have doubled 1 sp with Westa hand, even if no 4-card  H.|pg||
nt|stigw: Openeing biddings tend to be more and more aggressive the days, and he is protected by his strong cl, so - I would guess that more than 50 % of strong players would open|pg||
nt|dkkello:  they will find out about the @S Q  and stop in 6  |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D relay, 2@H > 2@S, 2Nt = 18-20|pg||

nt|dkkello:  anybodys 2 @S  ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the road to 6 NT   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  but I think 1 @D - 1 @S  3 @S will do the work to at the other tables|pg||

pc|h2|nt|pelu: or u have picked the first 3 pairs and maded them your favorites :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Even 7 nt has its chances, but not to recommend it.|pg||
nt|frm: E-W usually know what is going on, but I don´t know what the 5 C bid shows??|pg||
nt|dkkello:  7 will fail|pg||
nt|stigw: Asking for sp Q maybe ?|pg||

nt|stigw: It wont surprise me, if they also bid to 7 in the open room. We'll see.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  1 NT is and so on |pg||
nt|frm: A new possible slam in spades!|pg||

mb|p|nt|dkkello:  can i say flat board ?   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  no|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: harakiri:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and another bad luck for E-V   ?  |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: At least they did not have an 8 card fit this time;)|pg||
nt|stigw: A club lead should defeat 6 sp.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  and why shouldent he lead a club ?  |pg||
nt|stigw: As long as North doesnt start hearts, I think 11 tricks is the maximum.|pg||
