nt|vugraphzxf: live ticker with previous results at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Open-Quali-2012-1/12_01_20_team.html|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: Thanks Michael and hello :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: looks to me like losing a club, 2 hearts, 2 spades, and have to find the @DQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: we have very silly alert rules here in germany, unfortunately...|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: hello everyone, welcome back to the german trials|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: i wonder whether dbl = @d is really useful against this convention|pg||
nt|riccho: this is not very clever: not to open WK2, but then in a retard fashion denying the 4c@h suit as well |pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: of course, it makes for an easier metarule|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzxf: i've never seen anyone actually playing a nonalertable 2@h|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|riccho: after all NS managed to reach 3NT with 26HCP|pg||
nt|riccho: but look at the effect of an 2@s opening: ppp seems probable|pg||
nt|riccho: the strength of the @h fit lies in the fact, that no one can really make a take-out dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: felmy asks what dbl of 2@s would have been... stahl makes a throat-cutting motion|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|vugraphzxf: then again, i've seen smirnov but not piekarek, so maybe he hasn't arrived yet|pg||
nt|penseur9: well with 8 rounds might be watching opps|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: personally i would have rated team jokisch as their toughest competition|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strong version of 1@C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 0-6|pg||

nt|penseur9: very|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is a good contract for EW|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: piek showing very good hand with this sequence, but still not enough to game force|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: absolute gf would have been 3@d?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 3@D at some point -- or maybe DBL then 3@S??|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: piekarek immediately "that's impossible, it can't be! this is a new kind of bridge!" as the tray comes back|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: here some people play immediate 3@h would not be invitational, to prevent opps from getting back in the auction|pg||
mb|5C|nt|penseur9: this double could cost a lot|pg||

nt|ralfwil: perhaps 3nt instead of 2@s from E?|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: of course for south bidding is less attractive when he expects east to not have 3 hearts|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: td call now|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: fortunately i get a break in 2 boards to regenerate my concentration :)|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yet another multi-purpose 1@C|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|vugraphzxf: south could have bid 2nt, which would also have been a @h raise but with more points / less distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: we all need it Cornelia :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: first polish 1@c opening this set i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: normally they happen more often|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|chick: 1@S shows a typical 1N response|pg||
nt|chick: oops, I take that back|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chick: perhaps more like a "transfer" to NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: according to cc it just denies a 4cM|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and thanks all. Bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: second-last actually|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: N will end up in 3NT contract and probably going down on a @S lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: so we see bidding on 8 points can be a good idea :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: N sould duckonly once and then ouble finesse in @D to succeed, its alsmost a double dummy problem|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzxf: and again slavinsky leads give declarer pause to think|pg||
pc|cT|nt|april7: @H switch is best|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|chick: ok, similar ... 1N would show spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: no they play transfers, 1@h=spades|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|chick: ok I'll shut up :)|pg||
nt|april7: W dousn't know where the 9 of @S is ofcourse|pg||

nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the idea is to try to get declarer to play @HQ  for down 2    [i think]|pg||
nt|april7: last hand coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: So this is the last board of this set|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: seems they don't want to end up tied :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: low from 2 small is the systemic lead|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|penseur9: unless the OR cooperates|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: yes not completely implausible they could duplicate this bidding|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|april7: misfit all over but 3NT by NS should work on good card positions,best lead for defence though is an unlikely @D lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|april7: kills communication|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: down 2 still loses 1 imp|pg||
