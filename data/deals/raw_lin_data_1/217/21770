nt|othered1: very llucky slam in @S that can't be beat with some good guessing, especially in @C|pg||
nt|othered1: slam played by north, that is|pg||
nt|othered1: this is the closer, by a couple of imps, of the two semifinal matches.   But there's a way to to and 34 imps aren't nearly decisive at this point.|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H is     unexpected|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: I like to  have a bid to show a suit solid enough that partner evaluates his hand on its slam-worthiness *outside of trumps*|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what would you bid al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing Texas Transfers    2@H followed by 4@S = mild slam try|pg||
nt|othered1: so in my methods, I'd respond 3@S to 1N, a solid suit slam try, and south would like all those aces|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: playing South African Texas, many play that 4@S = slam try in @S  that works real well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the texas approach strikes me as an underbid|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the only glitch with that Ed --- too often wrong sides the contract|pg||
nt|othered1: That certianly can work well, but it does use up lots of space for a generic bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1n-2h-2s-5s is my choice|pg||
