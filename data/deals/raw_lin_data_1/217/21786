mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sommer: while Kello is both serious and joking (as always), we here see a possible slam for EW|pg||
nt|snagolf: a very sneaky look at he opps cards and young Bilde can bid 7 @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  No pictures of Vest  Gregers Bjarnasson |pg||
nt|ralfwil: What´s more commmon in denmark - Stenbergs or Jacoby´s 2nt?|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  well, E has helped NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: he changed his mind to 2@h:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwa: with a @c lead does 3@h not go down?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  last night we had a big debat about that subject  :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT easy make - but now EW are on thin ice|pg||
nt|dkkello:  we play something called bekkasin   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  almost the same  |pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|snagolf: but they will end up in 4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: many play it as shortness and forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 3@c could be 4-5-3 in any way .. South would ussaly bid a major if he had one|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sommer: actually 6@D is a very fine slam|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I think theese 4 players are perhaps the aggresive bidders we have in this country?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the most aggresive|pg||
nt|stigw: Ougt to go down, but....|pg||
nt|pelu: not the first time this weekend :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|snagolf: but since he more or less i forced to double 2@hs it is very difficult to find when W has 3 card @h-supp|pg||

nt|snagolf: t double 2@S of course|pg||

pc|cA|nt|snagolf: Young Dennis Bilde has a ftaher and an uncle who have represented Denmark on numerous occasions ... |pg||
nt|sommer: it wasn't necessary to bid 3@S to keep EW out of the slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: @s shift now will beat 3@d|pg||
nt|dkkello:  or steens 2 NT  , after Steen mÃ¸ller   showing maximum and shortage|pg||

nt|dkkello:  yeah whatever |pg||

nt|pelu: what a hand|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Peter(our private GIB), what can the win?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: W Smiling while shaking his head a bit:)|pg||
nt|pelu: 7@s|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Y  ..and how to bid it  |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: And graversen indicating that it is W turn to bid.. W ignoring him:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 7@s -p-p-p:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  s-v was partners for many years with great succes|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: thx Kjeld:)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|sommer: this is not for children!|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = weak multi|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sommer: ..weak multi..we agree!|pg||
nt|stigw: I think you are right, but South with his AQJx was taken out of the ruling !|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes John Wayne bidding filosofy seems to work just fine here |pg||
nt|pelu: remember B3 - in Open EW in 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: u would need those precesion relay system to get to 7@s knowing that it would win for sure or?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 4@H NS is still coming|pg||
nt|dkkello:  thats what a call agreesive bidding  ( 2 @D)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|snagolf: a good 6 @hs with too much waste in @ss and a @cA that is situated w-r-o-n-g|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and "only" 2 losers;-)|pg||
nt|snagolf: not a good 6 @hs a ... an enterprsing one I mean|pg||

nt|dkkello:  but after board 1 and 2 ?  His puls must be high right now |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  a kibz point out that 7 @s maybe will get double  (tx Pieter)  we will see !|pg||

nt|pelu: on @S-lead: if u play with odds u go down - best chance is a trump-finess for @DQ|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and a world class star from Sweden , good morning Mats Nisland quistion if 7 @S is a winner |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: after this bidding it might get dbl yes.. although if he opens 7@S then drawing the wrong ace could make it win and therefor no reason for dbl or?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|skaftij:  Difficult. If South is in chargem how would he know the North has 3@hs and not 3@Ds?|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|dkkello:  Bilde thinks it is christmass eve again |pg||

mb|1D|nt|dkkello:  If this was handball I would have called for a "time-out"  |pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|sommer: now what?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sommer: "some" @S, NS|pg||
nt|snagolf: a @D sacrifice against either Game in M|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a lot actually |pg||
nt|snagolf: 4 in either M|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well 4@S can be beaten by east getting a @c ruff with @s A:)?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Bilde can hardly join the bidding   ?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes..a sacrifice from EW doesn't look obvious|pg||
nt|pelu: a small @C-lead would defeat 4@s - @c-ruff|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Martin has AKQJxxx not vulnerabel , he will make a lot of noise with this one |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: i think east at least non vull will bid in on anything on strong 1@c trying to get n-s out of balance|pg||
nt|stigw: Again the defence versus strong club makes things difficuklt for N/S.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  To those who may not know, Stig, an international champion, is renowned for his slow play.|pg||
nt|stigw: But 4 sp seems natural here...|pg||

mb|4H|nt|sommer: exactly|pg||

nt|dkkello:  2 !X  Gameforce  |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|dkkello:  yes but small @C lead from V   , not first choice in real life |pg||
nt|sommer: @CA, @C too|pg||
nt|dkkello:  more likely  |pg||
nt|sommer: E can ruff with @SA..same|pg||
nt|dkkello:  @H 10|pg||
nt|dkkello:  betting ?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..@CA is my vote|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trump lead is better for the defence|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @C   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  not|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: only a small @C work|pg||
nt|sommer: no Peter|pg||

nt|dkkello:   I looked at the math .. Qxxx in N is 17,76% ... ruffing without playing AK wins to Qx in N (4,36) Qx in S(4,36) and Qxx in S (13,32) > 17,76|pg||
nt|dkkello:  tx to  Deyan Spasov  from Bulgarian|pg||

nt|stc: at MP there are many ways to take a top or a zero|pg||
mb|6C|nt|vugraphzya: If W had only 2@h , 6@c would be a good contract|pg||
nt|stc: they heard you !|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|d|nt|vugraphzya: This is going to be a huge swing, 12 probably|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|vugraphzya: He can even play the K of @h hoping W has singleton|pg||

nt|vugraphzya: But he will play the A@c first for sure|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzya: I think there was a misunderstanding in the bidding|pg||

nt|sommer: Askgaard/Bjarnarson took the "bad" slam in b2 but were lucky (as we saw)|pg||
nt|snagolf: most people would Kello|pg||
nt|skaftij:  On bd1, EW are in 4@h in OR, so missed chance for Bjarnarson - Askgaard|pg||
nt|pelu: in B4 EW stoppen in 6@s|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi Ralf and Kello, long time no see.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dkkello:  E-V are following the law   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Murphys law    |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: Yes Hagen knew the @s lead was coming and know his partners distrabution.. very good bid!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dkkello:  but they are maybe on the 4 level when it comes around  ?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bjarnarson also bid 2@s|pg||
nt|dkkello:  The old tournament in london etc an cavendish  and many many caps for denmark|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dkkello:  Sunday times tournaments ..  |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Macallan  ?  cant renember  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|skaftij:  What a misitit!|pg||
nt|pelu: EW open on 4 card major, and major before minor is the suit is OK|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hagen is earning himself a chance to play for Denmark IMHO |pg||
mb|p|nt|snagolf: so the thing is: will they bid 5@s over 5@h?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  5 @C  now   ?|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S has a chance..4@H is almost laydown - guess Martin will go on to 5@H if needed|pg||
nt|snagolf: never ever ...|pg||
nt|snagolf: never ever 5@c|pg||
nt|sommer: ..agree|pg||

nt|pelu: Yes - just see CC|pg||
nt|snagolf: silly|pg||
nt|snagolf: but then again: it would be a weird relay here|pg||

nt|dkkello:  the benefit of precision  .. the open very very light  |pg||
nt|stigw: I doubt they reach 4 H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  South presumably asks for help in @d|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dkkello:  5 @D   then  |pg||
nt|stigw: But 5 di ok too.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|snagolf: take the money .. thatta boy|pg||
nt|sommer: agree|pg||
nt|stigw: Again we see a 4-card-support not jumping, I think they play 2 better than 3, and might have 4 card-support even when bidding only 2.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  which North certainly has|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: if north had Kxx in @d could 5@D really win?|pg||
nt|frm: A trumplead against 5 D would not be so nice!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ...like betting with Kello?|pg||
nt|pelu: what did Graversen have for lunch?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|dkkello:  talking of money , dont go before we settle a date for the next kierki  |pg||
nt|sommer: ..not for me..|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 3@d was long suit trial bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I am sure they will catch up suddenly  , they can be very very fast  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  and of course N-S also have potentiel to make it to the national team  |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|snagolf: maybe Andreas can enlighten us to what Graversen has put in his tea cup .. ?? what was that Double all about. Telliing that he had the @c 8 as well?|pg||

nt|stigw: Not easy I meant.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  not easy at all|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sommer: 500 is a fine score for NS|pg||

pc|h2|nt|pelu: agree, Ralf|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|frm: The opponents cards are well placed for a ceossruff, and now they have missed the opportunity to lead trumps twice. So now it is a make!|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|pelu: but if u open 1@C what will u bid in next round - then 1NT would be 15-17|pg||

pc|sT|pc|h4|pg||

nt|pelu: 1@C - 1@D - 2@C for sure 6 card suit, so by system u can only open 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: I dont see the real problem with 1!n here to be honest... u will have more problems not opening 1!N and if partner opens will problebly at somepoint have to bid 2!n so.. i dont see ...|pg||

pc|h3|nt|skaftij:  "Your points were good" Askgaard said|pg||

pc|hK|nt|stigw: I looked at the bidding which was crypted by artificial relays, and something must have gone wrong for them.|pg||

nt|stigw: Board 7 I meant, sorry.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sommer: remember, you are to bid a zonal game, even if it has only a <40% chance|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @C transfer obviously |pg||
nt|frm: Nice contract - probably 10 tricks!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sommer: ..right:)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yet another case of not jumping to the 3 level with 4 card support|pg||
nt|stigw: Well bid E/W even on that flimsy opening, which I think is their style or system.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: after 3NT in N Martin a close to place N with @h KQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|skaftij:  Askgaard just bid 2 @s and there they rested|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a good hand for a system like theirs   after 1 S! what to bid in vest playing natural?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|pelu: they have play 11 boards in Open|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sommer: ...may be a problem now.....|pg||
nt|sommer: too early for @Cruff!|pg||
nt|snagolf: he really didn't believe that the finesse would win|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: I think we started a lillte late.. but we should have started at 12,15 .. so they have used one hour and 40 minuts on 8 boards:)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|stigw: Crossruff all the way, and then count hov many tricks at the end.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  You better not say anything andreas|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dkkello:  probably a flat board  with players at this (high) level |pg||
nt|sommer: ..it depends on...it's VERY difficult to make now!|pg||
nt|snagolf: he needs @hs 2-2 since he is endplayed on his hand .. so he will play a heart now|pg||
nt|sommer: he must play on @H 2-2|pg||
nt|sommer: IF he believes E's carding (low-high=even), he may shift strategy|pg||
nt|snagolf: playing the crowd he is (Yoda-quote)|pg||
nt|snagolf: and what would that strategy be?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  normally they are all very fast players (maybe not Graversen?) |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: They have all but dennis left the table during this hand|pg||
nt|sommer: playing her ladyship, @HQ:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  do you wont a quote contens Jacob , Abba song title or what  ;)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..just for the audience!|pg||
nt|snagolf: no thx .. I am tone deaf|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|pelu: in OR Bilde-Gracersen missed the 3Nt (on a @D-finess after @sQ)|pg||

nt|vugraphzwa: @d 9 now? not that is helps that much but|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dkkello:  a top kibz   , Knut the brother og lars pointed out that it is unfair that Graversen pas with an 11 count in 3 position   , difficult for Martin to play him for that hand|pg||
nt|sommer: ..maybe even full house!|pg||
nt|snagolf: a @c lead would cut this one down to 2 seconds|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he thinks Bilde has the @H  K  of course|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East was hoping for a competitive double I guess|pg||
nt|stigw: A "sneaky" sp 5 might also be an alternative.|pg||
nt|stigw: Not easy to duck this one.|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Kello why not down 4 (8oo) in 5@C?|pg||

nt|vugraphzwa: They have catched up now.. an hour left for 8 boards seems normal:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  my 3 favorites pair has taken the lead  ..|pg||
mb|1S|nt|stigw: But now Im back, and 3 nt hopeless here, but what about 5 Cl (impossible to bid) ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  1 @C  or 1 @D from Bjarasson|pg||
mb|2S|nt|skaftij:  Disciplined pass by South|pg||
nt|stigw: Decptive bidding from E/W here, so Anders might make a fault ? - no, pass was excellent !!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|dkkello:  Knut: Lars played that the opponent make a mistake, they didnt |pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzwa: but do u allways open on anders hand?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  But Bilde - Graversen , my 4 . th pair has had a HUGE session here |pg||
nt|dkkello:  they can open 1 srong @C also with 15 |pg||
nt|dkkello:  1 NT  should be Gameforcing in precision ?  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Bjarnasson has a huge hand now|pg||
nt|stigw: A nice sp-slam here, but hopefully they dont try 7 !|pg||
mb|4S|nt|stigw: Difficult hands to bid from all cormners except North, but I would have doubled 1 sp with Westa hand, even if no 4-card  H.|pg||
nt|stigw: Openeing biddings tend to be more and more aggressive the days, and he is protected by his strong cl, so - I would guess that more than 50 % of strong players would open|pg||
nt|dkkello:  they will find out about the @S Q  and stop in 6  |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@D relay, 2@H > 2@S, 2Nt = 18-20|pg||

nt|stigw: Asking for sp Q maybe ?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|dkkello:  it equalize board  1 , fair enough|pg||

nt|dkkello:  DBL=  points and take out|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: yes about 55 minuts.. i was just reading that:)|pg||
nt|stigw: It wont surprise me, if they also bid to 7 in the open room. We'll see.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  1 NT is and so on |pg||
nt|frm: A new possible slam in spades!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @C asking |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|dkkello:  many @D from Bilde now|pg||

nt|dkkello:  natural 3 @S  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  only 3 ..   |pg||
nt|stigw: This cannot make slam despite the lucky sit here and there.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he is getting old to|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but do you pass as S on 3@d?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pelu: as expected - the partscore battle = game :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  can i say flat board ?   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  no|pg||
nt|frm: Not that I would recommand to bid 6 Spades - but it´s on with the heart ace in S and a diamondguess. You also need to avoid a club lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: harakiri:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and another bad luck for E-V   ?  |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: At least they did not have an 8 card fit this time;)|pg||
nt|stigw: A club lead should defeat 6 sp.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  and why shouldent he lead a club ?  |pg||
nt|stigw: As long as North doesnt start hearts, I think 11 tricks is the maximum.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  North cant be thinking?  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  probably Askgaard|pg||
