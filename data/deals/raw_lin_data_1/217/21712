nt|riccho: the strength of the @h fit lies in the fact, that no one can really make a take-out dbl|pg||

mb|2C!|an|gf or 20-21 bal|mb|p|mb|2H!|an|5+!h, 8+|nt|ahollan1: kool|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: personally i only like it at lower levels|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|april7: 3@H by S as transfer would be successful|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: its a to good hand to bid only 2@S!|pg||
nt|april7: now S will play the 4@S contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: right   that is used a lot after 1@H-3@S  and 1@S-3N to show "any shortness"|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: on Board 12, declarer blundered and is now going to go down in 6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|penseur9: that could mean 12 IMPs for Jamm Co|pg||
nt|chick: and so we are suddenly and unexpectedly tied!|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
nt|chick: what a swing ... 13 IMPs lost instead of 13 IMPs gained|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: sorry i missed something here... declarer lost 3@c, 1@d, 1@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: seems like a big misunderstanding here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|penseur9: no problem Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: or if you show shrtness after jacoby etc it's quite usefule|pg||
nt|april7: a @D lead might harm S for a while, but will still succeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: seems no 4@s contract here|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: unless bohnsack bids 4@c now...|pg||
nt|april7: this is not the best idea, goiung havy down if misguesses the Q of @C|pg||
nt|april7: on a @H lead though|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: stahl thinks this is rkcb|pg||
pc|s4|nt|april7: but why the bid of 3NT by N? |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzxf: maybe worried about bad @s split on this bidding|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|april7: an unexpected contract|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|april7: 10 of @D now|pg||
nt|april7: or better small @D|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|april7: the 4-1 trump break will kill the contract|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||

nt|vugraphzxf: td call now|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|22-23|nt|vugraphzxf: fortunately i get a break in 2 boards to regenerate my concentration :)|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yet another multi-purpose 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxf: south could have bid 2nt, which would also have been a @h raise but with more points / less distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: rohowsky waving around a double card for fun :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|penseur9: we all need it Cornelia :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: first polish 1@c opening this set i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: normally they happen more often|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chick: 1@S shows a typical 1N response|pg||
nt|chick: oops, I take that back|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: perhaps more like a "transfer" to NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: according to cc it just denies a 4cM|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and thanks all. Bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: second-last actually|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|april7: N will end up in 3NT contract and probably going down on a @S lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: so we see bidding on 8 points can be a good idea :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|april7: N sould duckonly once and then ouble finesse in @D to succeed, its alsmost a double dummy problem|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzxf: and again slavinsky leads give declarer pause to think|pg||
pc|c8|nt|april7: @H switch is best|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|terminator: no small @C?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chick: ok, similar ... 1N would show spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzxf: no they play transfers, 1@h=spades|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|chick: ok I'll shut up :)|pg||
nt|april7: W dousn't know where the 9 of @S is ofcourse|pg||
