mb|p|nt|famus: a big B UT!!!:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9:  *lead|pg||
nt|penseur9:  nothing much the defense can do to defeat this contract here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|twcho: but @d is the most promising|pg||
nt|twcho: @c can wait and @s suit is not robust enough|pg||

nt|penseur9:  this COULD make but difficult to figure out double dummy|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 6+@C 1-suit    b) 4+@C and LONGER @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@D was 3+@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  rare 1@D contract, S could hardly bid 1@H with that hand|pg||
mb|2S|an|5+!S-4+!C|nt|twcho: so we can conclude that both pairs are playing precision, probably the most popular system in China|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi AL welcome back|pg||
mb|d!|an|t/o|nt|ahollan1: is it best for Wortel to bid now with the lousy 6@S or later?  and show both majors or ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  does not look like any contract can ake either side|pg||
nt|penseur9:  *can make...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S looks good |pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @S contract looks best here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no entry to West hand for @H ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D does not promise any points   because may prefer @S over @C|pg||
mb|3D|nt|twcho: 3@h should say solid suit|pg||
nt|twcho: and invite cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  Kit Woolsey defines a good save as one that makes, but this is better than letting NS play 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 4@c probably deny @s control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the running total includes 10 IMPs for Het Witte Huis  [White House] for winning the round robin|pg||
nt|penseur9:  didn't somebody say that the five level belongs to the oponents|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: Ed Manfield in a BOLS Bridge Tip back in the 1980s|pg||
pc|c3|nt|famus: actually observing the Bermuda Bowl etc recently--the most favoured system appeared to be a combination of 2/1 with precision @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW flip-flop PASS/DBL     i think Eric Rodwell gets credit for that inversion|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|penseur9:  already 4 IMPs for EW on board  1... only down one in OR|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|penseur9:  thanks to my co-commentator Al and on voice Cornelia and Ralf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a bid that probably doesn't come up often|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=game force, no descriptive bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|an|asks|mb|p|mb|3H|an|4/5!H|nt|roswolf: they shouldnt get too high here|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: West, what a system|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzvc: North: i didn't have a hand for the system|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  thanks to the excellent commenting of Al as well as Cornelia, Andy and Martin on voice|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|vugraphzvc: being trained after many vugraph operating|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did the creative 2@S bid keep EW out of the non-making slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  tks :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  still going to get there|pg||
mb|5H|nt|twcho: many guesses available for declarer|pg||
nt|twcho: @s lead the best for defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looking just at EW hands  you want to be in this slam|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: vP really hated his @SQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's the only explanation for 5@H rather than some hedge|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West; in my hand it wasnt a good slam|pg||
pc|c8|nt|penseur9:  thanks also to my co-commentators Al and Geoffrey as well as Andy and Patrick on voice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder what Bos had planned if Lankveld held a 5 card minor|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: he had a minimum in HCP...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzvc: 5minor I guess :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|penseur9:  fantastic recovery by the de Lombard team this set... well done|pg||
nt|penseur9:  in the lead now... |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South asking about time, he has 12 minutes for this board still|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and White House total includes 10 from winning the round robin|pg||
nt|penseur9:  the last round should be fascinating... don't miss it|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|penseur9:  thanks also to our speaks for their comments and suggestions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right   to the point where some days  he won't bid game force dbl|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: seems flawed to me|pg||
nt|penseur9:  *specs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|twcho: now declarer has to guess correctly in both red suits|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: final chance of @S33 brings home the game|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: there might be some time penalty from the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: passive @S return wins 2 imps i think  [saves overtrick]|pg||
nt|penseur9:  any idea from what side?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: I don't know, all players not know for being fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious to have time pressure in a set that includes a PASS OUT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they didn't pass it out at the other table :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  that was a 4 imp swing|pg||
