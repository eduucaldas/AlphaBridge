mb|p|mb|3C|nt|serhat: did 2d showed single?|pg||
nt|itinerant:  and one assumes 3c is setting of suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|serhat: or just gf|pg||
nt|itinerant:  now the diamond values are shown|pg||
nt|serhat: thats the bad news|pg||
nt|itinerant:  bach can presumably show heart values now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bebechira: India all out.... and all over :)|pg||
nt|itinerant:  and discretion may keep them from a good result...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|itinerant:  it's very hard to see ashley stopping in 3NT though|pg||
nt|itinerant:  he would be imagining possible hands for delmonte now...|pg||
nt|itinerant:  perhaps AQx xx KQJx xxxx would be on a hook, but i suspect they play minorwood here so 5C could be safely reached anyway|pg||
nt|serhat: he can make with squeeze even K@H is off side but it is still a guess |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|itinerant:  1 or 4 keys?|pg||
nt|itinerant:  4H for the Q|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|itinerant:  perhaps 4C was not minorwood??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant:  so 11 imps to newman|pg||
nt|itinerant:  Rhys, can you make out their scribbles?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: according to ish 4nt was KC, 5c = 0/3 but since they play 3041 when clubs are trumps ish isnt sure ash remembered|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|vugrapha4: (they normally play 1430)|pg||
nt|serhat: there you go.. good lead|pg||
nt|itinerant:  anyone know when we kick off again?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h7|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|itinerant:  so restart in 20 minutes or so for the next set...|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: playing too fast for me to keep up, but he pitched a heart on the spade and claimed 12|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
mc|13|nt|serhat: merci|pg||
nt|itinerant:  a bientot|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|an|GF|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ours is 1st room to finish   lots of hands to see in replay at other tables|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C sets the game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is a group that won't do that with 4 card major unless 6@C|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: The others must make up for Braithwaite's slowness :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: although he has been quick this session|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: was 4@C asking for cue bids  or asking for key cards?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: don't ask me -- i can't tell|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: natural i think Braithwaite certainly explained 5@c as a key card response|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems a bit inconsistent to do that then bid 4N instead of direct keycard ask  or  follow-up cue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no harm|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they are negotiating a claim |pg||
mc|12|nt|ahollan1: thanks Wayne     |pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in 40 minutes|pg||
