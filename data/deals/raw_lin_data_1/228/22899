nt|vugraphzcy: both teams won at Veldhoven last year, as you all might remember|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|4H|nt|saverio: 4@s can be set by a small @c lead here   but very unlikely :)|pg||
nt|saverio: but E may add something  (not unreasonably)|pg||
nt|saverio: even if bal and no @c control may make him decide for pass|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|saverio: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: van Prooijen is still thinking.....|pg||
nt|saverio: not an easy pass   |pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: on repeated spade leads you can make 3 nt - but that is too much to ask|pg||
nt|mcsd: 3@D is maximum w should bidd now|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 down in 2 spades versus 3 @d making|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice agreement on the S bid:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS playing Support Doubles, so highly likely that 2@h shows four trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: looks as if we are in for a SLOW set - again|pg||

nt|saverio: now @c A and @c can set it   no more needed to underlead the A   and slowly easier to find|pg||
nt|psyck: not easy but W only showed a disctributional hand with no further interest, didnt think E would go forward when 5 level could be risky with no @c control|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees a little disappointed with his very first bid of this match|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|saverio: thats true    but his DBL was promising 12+  he has 18  and good controls     always easier looking at all hands|pg||

nt|baldfriede: South won't like that @H are blocked now|pg||
nt|kemperg: cards not friendly placed for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the Netherlands need a few swings - this may produce one, but possibly not the way they are hoping for|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||

nt|vugraphzcy: there is also a 3rd table, I will give you some results during the game as well. 1st board 5@DE-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is final set of 14 boards of a great  practice match format|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: how high  3rd seat  favorable  Louk?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: another part score battle (if battle is the right word considering the previous one)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|psyck: a typical 1st seat fav vul bid...|pg||
nt|sybarra: was typing could well try 4 @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: there's your answer :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and he did |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if i had any money  i would have bet on 4@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  30 hcp and 10 trumps may make anybody think of slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: no shy Brink|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  And N will think @DK is well placed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an| |nt|niekbrink: Frank Bakkeren plays another session with Ron Schwartz|pg||
nt|niekbrink: Lotan fischer will arrive shortly|pg||
nt|muppe: Here NS has slightly misfit, will see how high they will bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes only @H position for slam he thinks:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D  often weak NT, possible 4@D and LONGER @C/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcy: just like yesterday there is a 3rd table, not broadcasted by BBO but we will give you the results, 1board, 2@H N C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play 2@h opener as a three-suiter (short @d) so East could open a Multi 2@d  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but goes for the pre-empt - good idea at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [canape]|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jbgood: E doesnt think much of his 5 bagger:)|pg||
nt|saverio: N hasnt a tool to show 2 suiter it seems |pg||
nt|sybarra: the guys from Neth. not exactly shiy |pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly not shy :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
nt|kemperg: this is expensive|pg||
nt|gsper:  And Ss pass may also encourage N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force relay|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: Lotan Fisher hasn't arrived yet. I don't know why. Till then Frank Bakkeren will play. This pair also played the first session|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: there is a 3rd table, not broadcasted by BBO but we will give you the results as well. 1st board 1nt +1 by north|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: like the previous session I will also give interesting results from the 3rd table, not visible on BBO. board 1 6@S x -1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 590|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: talking about swings...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = LONGER @S|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|psyck: or he may have required a better hand for it|pg||
nt|kemperg: and Brink gets his reward|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  There was a case for S to double 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = 6@S 5@D, not 11|pg||
mb|4D|an| |nt|jbgood: I withdraw the word "battle" totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW signals  upside-down count & attitude [udca]   odd/even discards|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  carding  for both pairs   upside-down count & attitude [udca]  and odd/even discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator just cleaning up for the historical record|pg||
nt|mdgraham: disappointing for South with his monster hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: academic really, but it looks like 5@c will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: de Wijs informed Ilan about favorable multi thoughts they play....|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: at the third table I think it is Netherlands EW as well, so this table doesn't compare to the third table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  5/6@S 5@D, 0/1@C, not 6511|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought Ricco was supposed to bid 3N over 3@S :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NO WAY -- Walter rules!|pg||
mb|7S|nt|ahollan1: bigtrain knows meckwell system better than meckwell  [might still be keeper of official notes]|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcy: if I can remember :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: This seems to be too high for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, double looks reasonable - if South is going to bid a game 4@S isn't a bad shot - doesn't work here though, with West having five spades  |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 3rd table same contract, and made as predicted, @Ds are not a problem as only way of playing without losing a trick works...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, you need Kx onside specifically|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: E however is afraid of not being able to ruff the 2nd club, which isn't the case as @Hs are 2-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the low trump could have been led from Axx, of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so that if East plays a second round South can play a third|pg||
nt|mdgraham: from our vantage point, of course, we can see that that won't happen |pg||

nt|jjsb:  hello to u all ! |pg||
nt|jjsb:  i will secund a bit our "audio commentator" (thanks to cornelia and peter) here |pg||
nt|jjsb:  this practice is just awesome from the start , in term of quality of play |pg||
nt|jjsb:  and just a privilege to be able to watch it |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzcy: ok, it is Lotan Fisher who is playing, I will correct this|pg||
nt|niekbrink: complicated  hand. many options for both declarer and defenders|pg||
nt|niekbrink: But defenders are favorites to beat this contract|pg||
nt|muppe: not easy return for E, @h would be best this time|pg||
nt|niekbrink: club is not an option I guess. Diamonds doesn't seem pretty either and trump could be expensive if the clubs run|pg||
nt|muppe: But ofcorse he doesnt know that his parntner has @hA|pg||
nt|jjsb:  we can of course all see that this one is going down and it will at the end but South is just trying to picture the different possibilities |pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps they play dbl and pass reversed?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: birman could have cue bid 5@H, to me that is sufficient encouragement with flat hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|niekbrink: well done by Drijver|pg||
pc|h2|nt|muppe: nice|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: good topic for partnership discussion -- when dummy shows Qxx(x) after partner leads from AK -- is your signal count [normal or udca] or suit pref|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South is  R  Schwartz|pg||
nt|jjsb:  the problem for the defense is just now |pg||
nt|jjsb:  and the 10 of @c is somehow precising things|pg||
pc|sK|nt|saverio: i'd think AK and AK enough to show 2 suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk4: unless Bakkeren is a substitute|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is he?|pg||
mc|13|nt|mdgraham: well bid|pg||

nt|ahollan1: knew it was safe to play @CA |pg||
nt|mdgraham: amusing start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW system is called Ultimate Canape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not to be confused with Ultimate Club [which is an ancestor]|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcsd: transfer to @S|pg||
nt|davidb: y  5H posible  but 5sp-1 !|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|2S|nt|jbgood: this should yield a plus for EW|pg||
nt|jbgood: they need it - and dont get better opps|pg||
nt|baldfriede: E/W apparently like bidding aggressively|pg||
mb|p!|nt|mcsd: i wonder why s didnt get dbl in the closed room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: join the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: 5 mins thinking incoming|pg||
nt|jbgood: EW were obvioulsy too impressed by S's strong club:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: result not showing in movie yet    but it was another contract going down|pg||
nt|sybarra: could E ever find ace of @H lead or any @H lead?|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi David, nice to have an expert who knows their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: strong club, 18+hcp any |pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS = 0-7|pg||
mb|2N|nt|saverio: since p needs to have something it is unlikely to find him very short in reds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other table visible without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

nt|ahollan1: [both rooms]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
nt|baldfriede: good morning|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not sure why bauke did not bid 4@H, maybe because not doubled yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in a dream|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: not sure I could |pg||
nt|ahollan1: reopening DBL probably a different non-making partscore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with East declarer  @SK is worthless|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if you do double, you sort of have to "correct" 3@c to 3@d - but you don't really get to show the fifth heart (assuming 3@c natural)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: hm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@s=hearts, may have longer minor|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: I would lead a @S like the rest of the world|pg||

nt|vugraphzcy: http://tinyurl.com/cdv8ffs for convention card de Wijs-Muller|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S=High short (@s)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|davidb: difficult to avoid 5 level  on previous hand even withou EW bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h=6331|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: i would think a trump lead called for|pg||
nt|ahollan1: marshall - you're very faint|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@h quite playable from the West side, can be defeated (club lead) if played by East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: same goes for 6NT as well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see I was wrong about a swing on board 1.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 6NT/@H W needs spades 4-3 to work|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzcy: just like the other sessions I will also give you some results of the 3rd table, not broadcasted by BBO|pg||
nt|jjsb:  as its pointed out in the audio ,  4@s is better than 3nt i nthat lay out |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 1. 1nt= O 2. 2@H+1 O 3.4@S=S 4.4@S=S|pg||
nt|jjsb:  tricky hand to play , trying to create some commujication problem for the defense its possible declarer will play @h first |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: The players are Fisher - Schwartz NS and van Prooijen - Muller EW|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just guessing, but 4@s may be RKCB for hearts |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 6@H can also work with @H 2-2, but you have to decide immediately....|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psyck: after the 2nd best @s lead, W could have done better to switch to @h|pg||
nt|niekbrink: EW can make 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: there's the club warning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H10 in the slot  and both reds breaking  maybe 3@D does make|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|davidb: wow  !  great slam -very unlucky|pg||
nt|davidb: can he guess  as there was no trump lead ??|pg||

nt|mcsd: in the last sets we can hope for swingy bidding|pg||
nt|niekbrink: probably only bid it if EW bid diamonds ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: and we are back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: couldn't get north to pitch any of his winners :(|pg||
mb|2N!|an|minors|nt|mdgraham: I'm told that this board will return in the weekly training :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: the 1633 was known, so a no-brainer to find the ruff...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=6-10 HCP, 5+@C & 5+@D, should be reasonable texture|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mcsd: especially when one team was 24 imps ahead|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D    can be canape with longer @C or @S  but often weak NT|pg||
nt|muppe: 3@s probably mixed raise showing 4@s and 7-9p|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: It is of course van Prooijen - Verhees playing at the 3rd table, sry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: before bidding began, Fisher thought he might have best hand at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and first chance to bid is at 4-level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you would have some sympathy for a direct 6@S by South|pg||
mb|5D!|mb|5H|nt|mcsd: now only 13|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it was an excellent grand slam - let's hope NS in the other room bid it too - otherwise it's a bit of a random swingf |pg||
nt|mdgraham: here's a guess as well - to play the 10 or not....|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and 3 NT seems a likely contract here, so...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H usually less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=a) 4441@D, any  b) 4@S, BAL, 12-14  c) 5+@S 4+@D, min  or 55 MAX|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at these colors 5@D probably gives NS a double shot|pg||
mb|6D|nt|jbgood: 2 down in 3 nt and another 9?|pg||
nt|muppe: @d lead would be best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D|pg||
nt|friggi: brave bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees did NOT bid 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: he did|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cute 5@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 91 down gives you some licence for operations|pg||
mb|6S|nt|psyck: Strong @c & Canape openings for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N natural invite -- how'd that get in there??|pg||
nt|niekbrink: declarer has a lack of communication to his hand if he doesn't want to play trumps|pg||
nt|muppe: Declarer might not ruff this to get trick with @sK. |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 2nt board 3ntx C and 3rd board 3@H +2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcsd: a negative respose of 2@s should make S calm|pg||
nt|jbgood: but how calm? |pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe going for 4 @s?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we shall know in about twenty minutes :) |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@C by south (i think) since north has more or less denied a spade stop, and south hand cant force to 5 level|pg||
nt|kemperg: no problem , just 3 losers|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW never had a chance to find @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also  no trophy or cash prize at stake|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzbf: not so calm :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  D by E hardly realistic|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|mcsd: this is not a calm bidd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = weak nt  [12-14], not 4333|pg||
nt|jjsb:  4@s is probably making with a squeeze i think itsp ossible @d break the squeeze |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, such a strange system, & i used to think 2NT is never to play :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Herbst brothers  lead vs NT = attitude    carding  odd/even|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees: funny that they have this option|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  2@D had other possible hand types  2N clarified|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: actually Louk trow away one more @D so didn't have any choice, saw a rare down possibility...|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Roel |pg||
nt|ahollan1: how about duck @D  then @S finesse before @C?|pg||
nt|friggi: sure|pg||
nt|friggi: but based on layout|pg||
nt|friggi: not the best bid here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a double of 2@S by drijver is not a stretch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = 6-10 HCP, 5+@C & 5+@D, should be reasonable texture|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: no :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: repeated spade leads would have sunk the contract, now might make|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jbgood: 300 is 7 imps|pg||
nt|mcsd: now only chace to make is double finesse in @D|pg||
nt|niekbrink: now declarer looses 1 spade, 2 clubs and 1 heart|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcsd: which is off|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s8|nt|gsper:  The voice commentators seem to side with me on that|pg||

nt|fabsayc: my theory is get in cheap as possible|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: North has bid well here - without knowing all the systemic ramifications, it looks like he was showing four-card spade support (4@s) and good diamond values (3@d)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck: yes, they needed to 'wrongside' it to make|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: there's a chance that 2@Hx was -2|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1 was a push  but not the way you might think   our table  5@C-1  other room  1@H-1|pg||
nt|kemperg: right, but with only 3@Hs and a useless @SQ?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcsd: and again we are in 6 imps gange|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|fabsayc: what about it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you can nearly always find some reason not to bid, and you are protected somewhat by Lebensohl over double|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@H is courageous |pg||
mb|2H|nt|muppe: NS play natural but they open with shorter minor when balanced sometimes if I rememver correctly, thus 1@d.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wow, 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: East could hold 4@D and longer @C or @S, but never longer @H |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: even 4405 possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just typing that Roel :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as Sir Humphrey Appleby might have said|pg||
nt|sybarra: was 4 @C enough? |pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: then A ask for @C return|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcsd: next please :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|muppe: if 12-14 balaced that is, spec corrects|pg||
nt|sybarra: voice discussion was about whether to bid at all with W |pg||
nt|sybarra: of course easier for us to see answer |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i can't imagine not bidding either 4@C or 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H shows bal 12-14 or 4441|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees said it at the table, walking away to get coffee so he didn't have to know the answer|pg||
nt|baldfriede: gives you another option|pg||

nt|sybarra: in rubber bridge for sure!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there i definitely claim -- in dup, i can only try|pg||
nt|sybarra: with 100 honors,  5 clubs hardly costs |pg||

nt|ahollan1: because Birman will go right in @H|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dummy's trumps not exactly a disappointment|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the rest of the hand quite good, as well |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: de Wijs afraid S might double he said, but looking at dummy it was no surprise there wasn't one|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i am not so sure he has all the info to get this right|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: although Simon knows @C10 is a singleton, can he figure out a 64 or 7-3 high, and does this matter? is a 7-3 not always C?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: didn't the Poles play that East could overcall 1NT to show 4M6m? Raptor or somethign like that |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Pierre Albarran [france] invented Canape|pg||

nt|sybarra: what was thought to be the advantage of canape?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: pass must be forcing |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Italians brought it to world attention with Neopolitan Club [which became Blue Team Club], Roman and a few other systems that were short lived|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N normally has slam ambition, 4@D confirms willingness to cooperate  so PASS definitely forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not 100% certain that 4@D confirmed canape|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: It is, Verhees indicated it could even be 56|pg||

nt|niekbrink: south will find another bid|pg||
nt|muppe: But west cannot really pass without seeing his parnerts hand|pg||
nt|niekbrink: agree. what I wonder is, if 2 spades shows diamonds, how do they show clubs?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: or was 2 spades just any minor?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: their convention card isn't clear about it|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: I think just a minor, but not sure, couldn't hear everything|pg||
nt|muppe: NS hand fits well. South thinkin whether dbl or 4@S?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: what happens if south waits long enough and then doubles?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: can north still run?|pg||
nt|muppe: i think he cant|pg||
nt|muppe: but im not expert on law issues|pg||

nt|fabsayc: at this vuls north can afford a somewhat offshape double|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|sybarra: hope pard understands that |pg||
nt|sybarra: the "that" being 5 @C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i have no idea what DBL over 3@H would show|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand does support recent article in ACBL Bulletin [by Mike Lawrence?] about efficacy of interfering over 1M-2N [game force raise]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note that if 4@D does show canape, then east has 4@H  with 5+@H and 4+@D he would open 2@D, not 1@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: so by deduction, 5 @C  must be a cue |pg||
nt|gsper:  2@D probably XY (game forcing)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 2@D gf checkback?|pg||
nt|gsper:  It is a pity that David seems to have left us|pg||

nt|jbgood: N doesnt normally have 3 spades after this sequence, so should be possible|pg||
nt|niekbrink: well done by south|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: took him some time, but well done indeed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems as if Fisher is working on his slow ranking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC says "1 D = CAN BE SHORT WHEN 3-4 OR 2-5 IN MINORS IF 12-14 BAL."|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a lot of pairs in England would not play 3@d as forcing|pg||
mb|4D|nt|niekbrink: Does it matter that they play with screens?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: spade shift not good enough i am afraid, declarer gets 3 spades, 3 hearts and 3 dias|pg||
nt|ahollan1: credit to NS for complicating the EW auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: it is @H6, but maybe only with all 4 hands visible...|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  5  [4@S+1]   Fisher-Schwartz did find the 5@CX save to pickup 8 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@S-2@S, Fisher bid a mere 3@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then took the save all by himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've never been good at those double shot situations where you let opponents exchange full info and THEN save|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i still haven't figured out what that means|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|ahollan1: voice commentary talking about winter storm|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbf: 2 spades, he pitched one|pg||
nt|jbgood: oops - sry - didnt see the spade discard (polishing my glasses)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told it's called Two Colours 1NT in Poland, could be only 5m|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in my part of world  temperature over 100F  [38+ C]|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite warm, then|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: At 't Ontstein? Because the sun is shining right now, but 10 minutes ago the wind was blowing hard, 20 minutes ago the sun was shining en 30 minutes ago we had a tropical rain|pg||
mb|5C|nt|friggi: must have|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: this will end with 10 tricks|pg||
mb|5D|nt|friggi: usually they are very closed to the money|pg||
nt|friggi: too late..now ..slam it is|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|gsper:  Cards well placed and defence helpful, when you don't need it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  3  Padon did NOT win @SA at trick 1   but won @CA and shifted to @H9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs 1N|pg||
nt|niekbrink: anyone wants to bet on another result?|pg||
nt|jjsb:  they are playing 7@c also for info other table |pg||
nt|baldfriede: did you mean "slow" or "low"?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: slow, is now on Roland's list of world's slowest players|pg||
mb|6D|nt|jjsb:  board 3 that is |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: quite a handy thing to play, but you give up the natural 1NT overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: hmm...|pg||
nt|friggi: pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Drijver was thinking, Brink already holding his pass card, so must know Drijver was about to bid end contract|pg||
nt|friggi: at least decl..knows that he has to have all spots in place..makes del.easyer|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbf: 31 imps difference now|pg||
nt|niekbrink: phew|pg||
nt|muppe: It does if the pause wouldnt be that long but now it for sure that it was S thinking so it doesnt matter enymore  I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be flat then - no reason to play for 3-0 trumps|pg||
nt|jjsb:  -1 is really good bridge its kinda clear on that board|pg||
nt|friggi: only problem is @C lead|pg||
nt|friggi: Q|pg||
nt|friggi: and hope for the best|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Ophir thinking and asking to know which club to lead, not IF a club should be led, as he said at the table :)|pg||
nt|friggi: Club lead is wise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there is the inference that when you overcall 1M with 2m, you don't have four cards in the other major  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: sounds like what we get over here during the cricket season   |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: only during cricket season? thought it was raining 400 days a year in England :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzcy: as we are playing 6 they can't play it...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|niekbrink: great defense by drijver|pg||
nt|baldfriede: these slow players are dangerous; I hated them when I was playing chess regularly. they think so much that  when tehy are finally in zeitnot they can play at lightning speed and ...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: get every move right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like you can make seven here, clubs 3-3 |pg||
pc|d7|nt|niekbrink: only chance to beat this contract was north having 4 clubs without the kin and his partner having 2 spades|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: now @C pitch @D|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: but then what|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: oh right -- even more bizarre  the venue doesn't have 3 full sets of boards|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: zeitnot must be time trouble|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a correspondent says that giving up the natural 1NT overcall is like giving up your, well, I'd better not say |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: these days the chess players are faster than most bridge players|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes; the Ger<man term is internationally used in chess. just like zugtwang is|pg||
nt|baldfriede: zugzwang*|pg||
nt|fabsayc: move compulsion, which in bridge is when the director arrives to warn the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: some results from the 3rd table: 4: 4@H -1 S (thus the same)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|baldfriede: I compare move compulsion to being endplayed. any move you make is wrong; that's what the term "zugzwang" mEans|pg||

nt|mdgraham: The 690 and 590 were flat - board 3, though, was 12 to Israel  |pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzbf: that might be director's call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=5@H & 5@C/@D|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes, good thinking|pg||
nt|friggi: like the man said, if your are going to make a mess make it early|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcsd: 24 imps the differencewth only 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: other room board 5 3nt C N but under protest....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as a matter of interest, if you are in seven with AKxx opposite 1098sixth - if no trump lead, would you play for trumps 3-0? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D always weak in 1 major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other israeli pairs include strong hands in their "multi"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: N just banged 4@h in the other room - 3@d minisplinter good here|pg||
nt|friggi: question remains...small or big slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcsd: bergen raise?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@c some Bergen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: yes, 3-4c supp 5-8hcp|pg||
nt|jbgood: if it can be 3 - then its not bergen - and S will not bid game|pg||
nt|mcsd: he is thinking|pg||
nt|gsper:  With @D blocked, EW can make 3NT|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4-10 hcp|pg||
nt|niekbrink: remarkable pass by south|pg||
nt|jjsb:  well i would surely hate to be in that situation im just not sure the non trump lead is enough to considere a finesse |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 5: 3@C W-3 6:2@D N -2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 10-17 hcp, 5+suit|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@H|pg||
nt|friggi: problems|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT - 4@C|pg||
nt|friggi: except 2NT 24+ |pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone else respond 1@S?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: NS play a true Multi 2@D opener  to cover weak typical 2@H/@S opener and some strong hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@s=hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: I thought that in bridge nowadays any 12 count is an opening bid, especially if you have 2 aces|pg||
nt|muppe: 4-3-3-3 12 count, maybe it's their style not to open then|pg||
nt|jjsb:  redouble here probably with a 5 card suite asking partner to bid 2@c |pg||
nt|fabsayc: must be north thinking, east had automatic pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 7: 3@D +3 W|pg||
mb|2N|nt|niekbrink: if it is not your style to open this hand, is worth an invite now, or will he just bid game?|pg||
nt|muppe: Most certainly would open|pg||
nt|jjsb:  there is some different defense on a penalty double of 1 nt the important things is that to discuss it with partner !! |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: escape mechanism indeed....|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@S clearly constructive in their methods, as pointed out by a kib|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 2@S can be up to 14 in 3rd position|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: not true|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: well i guess you were right :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: not true: I meant 4@h after a tempo break|pg||
nt|muppe: What is 2@d?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of my team-mates led a singleton trump against a grand slam after a RKCB auction with showed all the honours - at least, one hand had shown the queen - the trouble was, he ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: didn't have it |pg||
nt|friggi: transfer|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: bergen is always 4 - that i know - i live there|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: i agre, they should call him|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: agree|pg||
nt|mcsd: sry for typos|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand "flops" well |pg||
nt|friggi: with points|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10 tricks now|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: I guess south intended it as GF relay, but north thought that this was not the case with passed  hand |pg||
nt|friggi: max|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|muppe: maybe he forgot he was passed hand? your guess would be mine too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C = 5422|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: in a natural-based system, why not?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: cant do anything wrong,  my kind of hand |pg||
nt|friggi: so now 7 is possible|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: looks like 12 tricks in all slams - assuming you get the hearts right  |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: i fear partner wrongly evaluating @S honor/shortness|pg||
pc|s4|nt|niekbrink: Or is it to wild as a commentator to guess a misunderstanding for world champions?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jjsb:  there is somle loosing play available here |pg||
nt|friggi: slam try|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but without a peek, Verhees has to work through permutations of  both red Kings offside|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jjsb:  but the probkem si u migth have some communication problem to play for K10x in @d in South |pg||
pc|d2|nt|friggi: all clear go ahead|pg||
nt|friggi: like the say in Italy fantastico|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: chatting with someone who knows the EW system better than me - 2@D is natural|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then Symmetric Relays|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there was an amusing hand yesterday where the relays went wrong (not this pair) - ended in 6@s-4 with 7@h bid and made at the other table - just the 21 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@s was Axx opposite Kx - not ideal for a slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not quite sure about this - EW play 14/30 RKCB, so it looks like 4@S is not RKCB|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: de Wijs is thinking and thinking, took out a pass, hovering it about the bidding, took it back and bid 6@D|pg||

nt|jbgood: still with a director's ruling on this one it seems that NS1 will take it home|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 1@h is a five-card suit, then sure, you can give some kind of heart raise |pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: strange but here the hand that should have been thinking, south, passed 1@S almost immediately|pg||

nt|jbgood: and then there was one - unsignificant one|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: in other room Brink-Drijver don't play the 2-suited openers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in which case  the 2+ 1@C & 1@D opener's really confuse me|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcsd: the CR score is correct on this one?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: dunno :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is normally a terrible overcall, but much safer against a limited opening|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and you might bid a (natural) spade even if 1@h is five, just in case opener is 4@s5@h |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this time 1@D = canape in @C  [canape means 2nd suit is longer]|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|jbgood: so congrats to NS1 - and bye all|pg||
nt|jjsb:  well the J would have work also for some kind of Kxx and 10 singleton on East hand ?|pg||

nt|friggi: dbl os 4M|pg||
nt|friggi: dangous stuff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D doesn't promise any points -- just prefers @S over @C  if west has both black suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hence the @S lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of those things you have to do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you might as well do the same - although, if you need swings, perhaps you should do the opposite :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb:  rigth |pg||
nt|jjsb:  n is probably kinda astonished :) |pg||
nt|jjsb:  N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: otherwise, they will make AAK in the majors and five club tricks for -120 and you can make 140 in 2M|pg||
nt|jjsb:  its not a clear situation he knows there is a fit in major but in other he has some "defensive" value |pg||
nt|mdgraham: (or -500 in 2M, of course)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most pairs would not be sure of their agreements here, you suspect - is double 100% penalty? |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: all in favor of a pass or anyone wants to score big with N and run the risk of EW finding a better play?|pg||
nt|jjsb:  its an awkaward decision really |pg||
nt|jjsb:  i do pass personally |pg||
nt|mdgraham: North can be pretty sure South has a club void - as a spec says, if South is 5/5M 4M may be on|pg||
nt|jjsb:  as its commented on the audio and some specs some are suprised he didnt act rigth away |pg||
nt|jjsb:  i agree he wouldnt have been in that situation |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: at the 3rd table 2@C went 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: only it was played by North :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=5-11   i don't know if that means  forcing or semi-forcing or non-force :(|pg||
nt|gsper:  According to Peter, 1@S showed @C length too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D can be  4414 or 4405   that makes it difficult for East to preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@S down after @D lead in other room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@d can be two cards - which has hurt EW here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|muppe: Is 2@s weak two or 5@s and a minor?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Nice for E, who would have had troube finding a bid otherwise|pg||

pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: One question is, will the slam be bid next door?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: looking at south hand  i assume forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easy to bid if it promised at least 2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: south making good use of his strong @H spots|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if @H6 suggests @D shift|pg||

nt|friggi: yes J |pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcsd: Bilo je i kvalitetnijih timova, po rejtingu, koji su ispali iz trke ranije.|pg||

nt|friggi: and small @H|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 2nt asking|pg||
nt|niekbrink: I guess 3 clubs is eiter a minimum and a bad suit or shortage|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 3@C shortage|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2NT is unequivocally clubs, you can play pass then double by North as penalties |pg||
nt|sybarra: easiest lead for declarer |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@h is a bit, er, thin|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|muppe: this is not making|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually, you can do anything you like with the variousn combinations of pass and double |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the important thing is to be on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|friggi: Q@C or small @H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcsd: We have no idea what happend with 2@h dbld|pg||

nt|fabsayc: club 10 was suit preference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially when Verhees ducks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcsd: Kibbitz suggests that if 2@h dbls the rulings retun 2@H dbld to -1 and 3nt makes on this one then Vrnjacka Banja winns|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it would have worked better if Verhees was on same page|pg||

mb|p|nt|niekbrink: that will do the job for WE|pg||

nt|muppe: Top spade or small?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: board 5 has been corrected to 3nt -1 N|pg||
nt|davidb: why not H?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: on a heart lead south can make 13 tricks I think|pg||
nt|gsper:  Where will the 10th trick come from?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@d is a heart raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anybody for pass with south hand and lead a trump|pg||

pc|d9|nt|muppe: ok @h|pg||
nt|jjsb:  ok so a no brainer at the play apparently |pg||
pc|d3|nt|muppe: He might just play for 9 tricks, now he has a finesse in @h.|pg||
nt|muppe: oh sry he has 9 top tricks now|pg||
nt|niekbrink: not if drijver plays low|pg||
nt|niekbrink: then he has 10 top tricks, but no possibility to make 13|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently 4@C was cue bid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yep|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|niekbrink: if drijver plays the J of hearts, he can win the ace, finesse heart to dummy. play 10 of diamonds for a diamond finess. repeat eh finesse in diamonds and cross to the king of clubs ...|pg||
nt|niekbrink: to cash the 13 diamond and his 3th heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that may be a more valuable interpretation|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|niekbrink: so, 3heart tricks, 6 club tricks and 4 diamond tricks - 13|pg||
nt|jjsb:  some security play avalaible in @d|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s9|nt|niekbrink: now he lacks communication for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|muppe: @h8 was good, now he cant risk @d finesse or he could go down|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: just in case East has A109x|pg||
pc|dK|pc|sJ|nt|jjsb:  ok so the @h finesse will be safe now |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|niekbrink: of course, south was not gonna take all these risks and probably just cashing his tricks|pg||
nt|muppe: he can try @dQ if E covers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer should get @H right with North showing 6/7@D and 3@S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|niekbrink: was the hesitation long enough?|pg||

nt|vugraphzcy: can make all the difference...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|muppe: still nice result for Israel|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yes i could have passed out the hand -- at least i didn't give them a 2nd chance to get to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=10-15 HCP  5+@H and 4+@D|pg||
nt|jjsb:  again not a surprise we do know what those teams are capable of , still |pg||
nt|jjsb:  interesting board here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: vP can't bid 3@C here -- that would show @H fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try 3@S   asking for 3N|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: nope  5@C   going for the 100 honors :)|pg||
nt|jjsb:  in some good normal day NS will make a slam here just that all os so horrible for them... |pg||
nt|gsper:  I had connection trouble. Are we agreed that @DA would have beaten it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 7411 a much better shape than 7222|pg||
nt|jjsb:  i wouldnt be surprised they do play slam |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force relay|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@S from Verhees??|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: yep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe vP would like to go back and try 3@S now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is why you have practice matches -- to talk about situations that haven't come up before|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 11 tricks in NT without diamond lead....|pg||
mb|3H|an|46|nt|niekbrink: the 4 diamond bid is typical in the style of brink and Drijver. |pg||
nt|friggi: NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcy: Fisher is already taking out 7@H bid....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 hcp, 4+@S  if 2-suits  2nd is LONGER|pg||
mb|4H|nt|niekbrink: 5 diamonds is a good sacrifice again againgst 4 spades|pg||
nt|jjsb:  Mike what about east decision? are u doign same?|pg||
nt|friggi: pass|pg||
nt|kemperg: have to leave now, grandchildren are arriving.|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: yes EW has put a pressure on NS, but NS find their good 4@s|pg||
nt|muppe: 4@s looks makeable|pg||
nt|niekbrink: losing a spade and a club|pg||
nt|niekbrink: maybe a heart ruff|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so 10 or 11 tricks I guess|pg||
nt|niekbrink: heart ruff not so easy to find when south is declaring|pg||
nt|muppe: but it's not over yet, E still thinking|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 5d is only 500 i think|pg||
nt|davidb: good  pass F -partner please  decide|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N confirms  12-14 bal, not 4333|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may end in 2@sx|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees said he was sleeping, thought it was 4@S instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|muppe: @sJx doesnt look nice for save, he cannot know for sure if 4@s is making or not|pg||
nt|friggi: this will make due to distribution|pg||
nt|gsper:  No, say kibs. Pity I missed the discussion.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he wasn't making 6@C either|pg||
nt|niekbrink: great lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: brink started "without" thinking a @H, had ofcourse some time to think before a contract was certain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure how DBL affects the responses to this stayman-like 3@C relay|pg||
nt|friggi: bad dbl|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: the trouble is, if you raise to 5@S, you are telling NS they can make a slam.... |pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they don't have much room left to find the best one, if indeed there is one|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 3@H 46|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = MAX  4@S 6+@H|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: might bid normally "thru" doubles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D shows 4/5@D and NOT 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|davidb: S  is  bored  .. uselles  X  -may his  first  doubtful  bid ...dror padon  playing great|pg||
nt|davidb: may be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both of the young pairs playing very well|pg||
pc|d3|nt|davidb: very  good  judgment  by all! high  level bridge|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3@C=any 12-14 3@H=asking for singelton , as a kind kib told me|pg||
nt|friggi: bld|pg||
nt|gsper:  So maybe it was a true winkle|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H asks  how many @D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|muppe: Now they will score @h ruff but still 10 tricks for declarer it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: par score reached|pg||
nt|jjsb:  again this hand shows the level of play really... |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: better than this is hard to find, (world) transnational champions against the world champions|pg||
nt|friggi: lack fo breavearge|pg||
pc|h2|nt|friggi: A|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: rdbl denies a 5crd low, and without jacoby no 5crd high, so N must also have 4 spades...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: for the record, 7NT down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club jack, cant think of any reason to lead anything else|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is on system notes page 247  ... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=4@D|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|friggi: and return|pg||
nt|friggi: good god|pg||
nt|friggi: was clear singel or doblton|pg||
nt|friggi: very poor def |pg||
pc|c2|nt|muppe: E will be endplayed|pg||
nt|niekbrink: will east endplay himself by ruffing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: (just kidding no clue really but clearly they know what they are doing) |pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu:  tell me how can S make after @DA discard? - tx|pg||
nt|gsper:  A winkle is an advanced squeeze, named by Reese, which I have never accomplished.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|niekbrink: another endplay of B. Drijver!|pg||
nt|davidb: nuce play by E not ruffing -gives some chance!|pg||
nt|davidb: nice|pg||
nt|niekbrink: this time he is endplayed himself |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|davidb: the  dutch pairs  are working very seriously  -I admire  -they deserve  their title|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|s2|nt|muppe: yes had east not ruffed, it would have been more interesting|pg||
nt|niekbrink: how?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: declarer can ruff a heart in hand, finess a club and then find out he needs clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|gsper:  A technically competent kib confirms that it was one|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sybarra: wd guys |pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: Meckstroth-Rodwell have a good treatment after bids like 5@S - they invert pass and double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought 4@D forced 4@H to signoff -- but obviously it was something else|pg||
nt|davidb: on board  9 brink  played great to make 4H |pg||
nt|sybarra: worried maybe @D's 4/0 |pg||
nt|friggi: toolate|pg||
nt|mdgraham: leading trumps is a good idea against doubled partscores |pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: brutal to think after partner opens that best spot is 3N|pg||
nt|niekbrink: sorry, finess a spade|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: welcome back marshall|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|muppe: yes, he will be endplayed sooner or later it seems|pg||
nt|friggi: wating for the train who never comes|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the last chapter of The expert game|pg||
nt|gsper:  Are Andy and Peter this silent, or is my connection bad again?|pg||
nt|pelu:  kibs: play the last @h - that will kill the defense - ok - :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzcy: they should make that a law: "doubled partscore, always lead trump" :) :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s3|nt|gsper:  Looks like -1, but crossruffs are nasty to analyse|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
mc|10|nt|mdgraham: some players are reluctant to lead singleton honours against doubled partscores - understandable, but it helps partner  |pg||

mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: just in case not @HJT doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: forcing|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: the thing about the pass (requests double) is that responder doesn't have to double if he holds a very slam-suitable hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always a useful score, particularly if you've only lost one wicket|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: now 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and the agressive Dutch again! |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Israel 2 pickups this set   17 & 11|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: DBL promising both majors?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: that's how we were taught by Marty Bergen|pg||
nt|jjsb:  apparently east stop relaying and bid now naturally |pg||
nt|jjsb:  probably transfering the "capitanat" |pg||
pc|h7|nt|friggi: 3@C not forcing|pg||

nt|mdgraham: lots of tricks here without a club lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|friggi: A the 2 trumps|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzcy: the 3rd table played 6@H, which was doubled and went 2 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: sry, roubled, so a very expensive board|pg||
nt|sybarra: no way to catch up on this hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is consensus about vanProoijen's reopening DBL vs Schwartz selling to 3@H?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|muppe: Here declarer will probably guess @s and can discard @d loser on 4th @h when @h are 3-3 so 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  11 flat as well! What do you have to do to score against these guys?|pg||
nt|friggi: grrr|pg||

nt|ahollan1: converting the DBL is much easier at other forms of scoring|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder when we will have matches where a computer has eliminated this kind of board|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: did south bid 1@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if so needs an alert|pg||

nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees said he would have passed was it a other way of scoring :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  It is interesting that EW at the other table chose 3NT with all those major cards|pg||
nt|gsper:  There was a 2NT overcall there too, suggesting bad breaks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. Thanks to our operator and to spec Zmud99, who was very helpful with some of the details of the EW relays|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: we have one more session after this one, starting probably 10 minutes after this board ends....|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|muppe: Some might overcall 1@s with that S hand, but maybe its rather too weak for that|pg||

nt|jjsb:  3 nt is off on a @h leaad |pg||
nt|jjsb:  double asking for unusua lead|pg||
nt|jjsb:  probably a suit and its like "find it" |pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like a specific lead....|pg||
nt|jjsb:  mmhhh as audio comment (and operator) it specifically ask the @h lead |pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubt-showing redouble? |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: also explained by de Wijs as a @H lead....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bermuda Bowl final, 1981, board 72|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Meckstroth-Rodwell in 3NTxx - +750 (spade lead), could have been -2200 (club lead)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: we are in the twilight zone now|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|muppe: what was 1@d and 1@h?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good lead, that|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: they will be in time to have the club trick as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: arrgh|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anything to avoid a natural bid|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|niekbrink: 1h is 12-14 balanced or unbalanced with clubs and diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thought Verhees might open strong 1@C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if he still opens 1N if partner is NOT a passed hand|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 1 diamonds was eiter weak, or all kind of other hands without 4crd major, or the hand west currently has|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of 2@S because it promises 6+suit??|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: not sure....|pg||

nt|pelu:  is this a 1@S openinhg for all og u? - not for me|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|muppe: ok, so they are playing Dutch doubleton?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: yes|pg||
nt|jjsb:  as its point out by specs (thank) if u didnt discuss precisely about redouble or pass u better choose 4@c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: third seat, yes|pg||
