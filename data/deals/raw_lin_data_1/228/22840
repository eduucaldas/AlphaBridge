nt|penseur9: right you are|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|penseur9: Hoffman team probably pushing a bit to try to reach at least 2nd place (may backfire)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: i would like to bid a bit higher than just 2@D with that north hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: even though east is a passed hand and west passed over 1@D, i really expect them to come to life if i just bid 2@D|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting...suddenly a splinter|pg||
nt|athene: was 2@D forcing?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: maybe 2d is forcing|pg||
nt|athene: i think north is actually safer doing this if 2@D was *not* forcing|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Read system card, jump-raise is weak 5-8|pg||
nt|penseur9: will they  try for 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: because then he has already limited his hand quite severely|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if you bid a forcing (inverted) 2@D and then 3@S that sounds as though you actually have a hand|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. the same shape with like a 14 count or something|pg||
nt|penseur9: 3nt should make depending on play|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: there is a whole colony of rainbow lorikeets screeching their heads off outside the window, if they makea mistake it could be that they are distracted :-)|pg||

pc|s2|nt|nigel: The defence needed to switch to diamonds. I like the bidding sound vul overcall Chan says yep I trust you 4@s|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: arjuna under pressue already - pitching diamonds isnt best for his later chances of being endplayed |pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb:  Seems to me perhaps after the start, E could have bid 3@h and W 5@d as exclusion RKC to better effect|pg||

nt|frankaus: 3NT|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: Doesnt seem like a goodidea considering he doesnt want to penalise either suit|pg||

nt|henryb:  On board 3 E-W in the open room made 6@hX for 1660 and 14 imps. On board 4 E-W will go down 100 in 3@s ao after 4 boards of comparisons the score is Hoffman 19, Finikiotis 17|pg||
mb|1N|nt|super nova: I think that the Prescott team are the favorites to win the event. But hoffman cannot be discounted.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|henryb:  West has his values. East does not appear to have his|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: north wrote something about the redouble buti couldn't read it|pg||

pc|s5|nt|henryb:  I think N should pass - 25 HCP max and 21 opposite 4 usually does not play well|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: Maybe he could bid 3S to get Bruce to play 3NT?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he might be considering 3@S, or even something cute like 3@C|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|inquiry: you would have to know if they play 3@S as asking for full stopper, partial stopper, or if it shows @D support... 4@h makes it look like 3@S promised @ds...|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 3S can do both - if you pass it was a trf to 3NT, if you bid again it showed diamond support.|pg||

nt|athene: perhaps trying to muddy the waters a bit|pg||
nt|athene: given his partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: it ishard toshow a good hand with support after a takeout double|pg||
mb|r|nt|athene: well, you can bid 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: but some play flip-flop; in other words 3@D would be a limit raise and 2NT would show a diamond pre-empt|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: the idea being that when responder has the good hand you might want to play 3nt, and when you do, it's better to put the doubler on lead|pg||
nt|athene: in the absence of any cunning methods you can always just redouble and then bid 3@D, if opps give you room to do that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|athene: a kibitzer is asking me if there is any logic behind the order the boards are being played|pg||
nt|inquiry: One option for Fit jumpers could bid 3@C over the double to show club value and diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: there may be logic but it has not been shared with me :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps they are using the time-honoured "pick the next one off the huge jumbled pile" method|pg||
nt|inquiry: i like a fifth club for that, but a 3@C fit jump show only values to force to the three level|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I think it is so the open room can compare boards right away|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: east clearly did not mean the double as penalty|pg||

nt|stiffqueen: ron klinger opened the grubby 11 count as south in the other room leading a rather different contract !|pg||
