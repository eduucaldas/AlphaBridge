mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|saverio: 4@s can be set by a small @c lead here   but very unlikely :)|pg||
nt|saverio: but E may add something  (not unreasonably)|pg||

nt|vugraphzcy: van Prooijen is still thinking.....|pg||
nt|saverio: not an easy pass   |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: on repeated spade leads you can make 3 nt - but that is too much to ask|pg||

nt|saverio: now @c A and @c can set it   no more needed to underlead the A   and slowly easier to find|pg||
nt|psyck: not easy but W only showed a disctributional hand with no further interest, didnt think E would go forward when 5 level could be risky with no @c control|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees a little disappointed with his very first bid of this match|pg||
pc|c8|nt|saverio: thats true    but his DBL was promising 12+  he has 18  and good controls     always easier looking at all hands|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|jbgood: another part score battle (if battle is the right word considering the previous one)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: a typical 1st seat fav vul bid...|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: Frank Bakkeren plays another session with Ron Schwartz|pg||
nt|niekbrink: Lotan fischer will arrive shortly|pg||
nt|muppe: Here NS has slightly misfit, will see how high they will bid|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: E doesnt think much of his 5 bagger:)|pg||
nt|saverio: N hasnt a tool to show 2 suiter it seems |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|niekbrink: Lotan Fisher hasn't arrived yet. I don't know why. Till then Frank Bakkeren will play. This pair also played the first session|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: there is a 3rd table, not broadcasted by BBO but we will give you the results as well. 1st board 1nt +1 by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: or he may have required a better hand for it|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: I withdraw the word "battle" totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW signals  upside-down count & attitude [udca]   odd/even discards|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: at the third table I think it is Netherlands EW as well, so this table doesn't compare to the third table|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|muppe: This seems to be too high for NS|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: ok, it is Lotan Fisher who is playing, I will correct this|pg||
nt|niekbrink: complicated  hand. many options for both declarer and defenders|pg||
nt|niekbrink: But defenders are favorites to beat this contract|pg||
nt|muppe: not easy return for E, @h would be best this time|pg||
nt|niekbrink: club is not an option I guess. Diamonds doesn't seem pretty either and trump could be expensive if the clubs run|pg||
nt|muppe: But ofcorse he doesnt know that his parntner has @hA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|niekbrink: well done by Drijver|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: South is  R  Schwartz|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|saverio: i'd think AK and AK enough to show 2 suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk4: unless Bakkeren is a substitute|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is he?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|niekbrink: My information is that Frank Bakkeren indeed is a substitute|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ron Schwartz did not arrive yet. Now you know why, Marshall|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcsd: Now if he plays for ruffing @H he will promote T@C for @S|pg||
nt|mcsd: for South|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: and even if he doesnt - he may be forced|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: Ron arrived a few minutes ago I am told|pg||

nt|sybarra: a quiet 3 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS also pass more 11 counts than all big clubbers and most natural bidders|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: they "back into"  auctions a lot also|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: 5 mins thinking incoming|pg||
nt|jbgood: EW were obvioulsy too impressed by S's strong club:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: since p needs to have something it is unlikely to find him very short in reds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: other table visible without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

nt|ahollan1: a bit pushy with @Dxxx, but 4th trump and strong potential in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must admit -- i would lead a trump on this auction|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is @D10 in play after the @C play?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it would seem very strange for east to continue @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: it works,  but easier from out seats |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mollo would say something like   if both sides leading the same suit, at least one of them is wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder what partnership agreement is regarding @S7 at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally  odd = encouraging|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always wonder about odd/even,  what if you do not have an "odd" or "even" card in your hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: meaning the card you need |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in a suit with known length, that usually isn't a problem -- but default is to show preference for an impossible suit|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of spec comments re o/e |pg||
nt|sybarra: most of them negative btw |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|sybarra: and I will say,  the last thing I ever do is play o/e, udca, with new pard |pg||
nt|sybarra: (for example on bbo team games) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in ACBL events, they are only allowed as 1st discard  or some obvious situations such as this -- suit contract dummy short in the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: odd/even carding was popularized by Benito Garozzo|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I do not believe he plays it any more |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why you'll also hear them called  Roman discards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit Woolsey wrote a pamphlet that described the plus/minus situations for  standard, upside-down and odd-even|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it has been out-of-print for a while|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is too bad |pg||
nt|ahollan1: strange that it should come up -- i re-read it this week|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may see the ace taken and a @D hit the table?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N natural invite -- how'd that get in there??|pg||
nt|niekbrink: declarer has a lack of communication to his hand if he doesn't want to play trumps|pg||
