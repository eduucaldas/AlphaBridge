mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I agree.  Unless that double is intended as penalty I don't like it (and even so I don't like it).  East has neither shape nor points and he has led his partner astray.|pg||

mb|2D|an|GF stayman|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|stiffqueen: 20 opposite 14 - no fit - me thinks this should be an easy 6nt hand|pg||

nt|super nova: Am I actually seeing this stuff?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|beauch:  North should have bid 3@S |pg||

nt|kareno: Negative double?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: RDK is the high priest of the negative double|pg||

nt|fabsayc: the basic idea is if they cover you may have 5 club tricks and not need the diamonds|pg||

nt|amarko: can they bid it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel: Not a huge fan of POWER bidding as can be seen by this auction|pg||
mb|3N|nt|stiffqueen: januske will bid 3nt then make it a bit slowly|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel: but Klnger has righted the boat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|amarko: not 4@D  dont know there methods|pg||

mb|2D|an| |nt|athene: south should be going for 6@D with this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|stiffqueen: a boring part score hand - januske may bid 2 hearts but e/w are likely to always go about +100|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: 3@D is a pretty serious bid, at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stiffqueen: hmm - right sided but the defence can still easily find 6 tricks|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Bruce said loudly to Roger, "You enjoy that, did you?" when he won the jack ofhearts. I think he paused unnecessarily at some stage. Roger said, "Sorry, I fell asleep"|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: the scoring system is great too Andre, with the ability to monitor both matches baord by board|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kareno: That's helpful.  So this is an easy 4@s e/w but n/s might try to compete in a minor.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: 5m only -2|pg||
nt|penseur9: it's 1:30am here, so I'll leave most of the intelligent comments to Karen and Gary :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kareno: Interesting Klinger didn't show both minors at once.|pg||

mc|10|nt|kiwibridge: but it's really K-S (Acol with 5 card majors and short club, Terence Reese must be turning in his grave) :)|pg||
nt|kareno: East's bid was just competitive - he would have had to bid 3@h to make a game try.|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Down 1 - Gaspar cashed the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|nigel: Gasper in too much of a hurry certainly should try a top spade if ruffed then has losing clubs.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|amarko: can n/s find 3@C  rather than doomed 3 @H like open room|pg||
nt|beauch:  this opening shows 4 plus spades and 10/14pts|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|henryb:  1@h = @s?|pg||
nt|nigel: If Lane noticed then the hearts are high Bobby holding J109 declarer the 8 dummy the 7 so only -1|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h = I wat to have my head handed to me?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel: 1@h=spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|stiffqueen: poor result in the open room for hoffman this hand - with a 10 card major fit and plenty of big cards 4 spades look seasy |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|amarko: Richard may be in trouble with only 5 pts X|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand; at first it looks as though the defence can make two spades, two hearts, and a spade ruff, but maybe west will get endplayed|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he is still down|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: tough for harms to find a diamond - 10 imps to prescott|pg||

pc|h3|nt|athene: well, suppose declarer ruffed a club, cashed the diamond, ruffed diamond, then played spade - now if east delivers the spade ruff, west is endplayed with just @HKQ9 left|pg||
