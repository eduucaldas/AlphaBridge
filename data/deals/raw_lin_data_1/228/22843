mb|5S|nt|stiffqueen: this is a likely good result for harms with the hyper aggressive peter chan holding the east cards in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: East will have to get @S going before drawing all trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Is it totally clear to lead @D against 6@S?  It might clarify the suit, but the 3@C bid already may have provided the same inference.|pg||
nt|bebechira: North is on lead... so probably he will try his singleton|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if 3@S o ver 3@H would have been forcing.  Certainly would be in my methods.  I have had poor luck with "advance cue-bids>"|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|nigel: A  routine auction for maybe 13 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: If 4N was key card in @D, I can see why west bid over 5@S, since he had the previously unshown @SKQ|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if both players are confident that they're on the same wavelength.|pg||
nt|bebechira: does Klinger knows about the spade fit?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|beauch:  on bd 4 at other table klinger/haughie forgot to ener the auction and lost 12 imps|pg||

nt|beauch:  not the best lead of 2012!|pg||
nt|beauch:  i usually only make one good lead a year |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they had a quick break for water|pg||
nt|othered1: Very likely not|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: sorry guys, bid came too fast to notice 2S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|amarko: yes but on every hand David|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: couple of nice part score hands for hoffman means this match is probably going to get even closer soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: a 14 point  1N here?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb:  Board 21, as you see, produced a sizable gain for Finikiotis when 3@h was doubled and not beaten at the other table|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: i admit i was waiting for it :)|pg||
mb|d!|nt|othered1: EW's card says 1N is (14) 15-17.  With 5-card suit, I'm a bit surprised west didn't try it.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|henryb:  2@c, 5@c?|pg||
nt|amarko: looks like @H part score here|pg||
nt|beauch:  no - my leads are so poor - i have to bid more andrew|pg||
mb|p|nt|stiffqueen: hmmm - great choice from harms|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: What was double?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|stiffqueen: wow - harms is plenty happy but no 7 tricks just yet...|pg||
nt|frankaus: @SJxx is a poor holding|pg||
nt|othered1: yes,b ut the rest of the hand is pure|pg||

nt|henryb:  Some day Lane will find his partner with 5@c Ace and a void in @d :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: not much januske can do it clubs are 6/1 - that will be 1 off so he will tank and play a diamond eventually |pg||

pc|c2|nt|othered1: I don't see a way to defeat this and, with @S guess, overtrick(s) are possible, I think|pg||
pc|d2|nt|amarko: with 4 trumps maybe Gaspar should bid 3 immediately|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nigel: nicely done right siding the contract|pg||

nt|nigel: Not sure what Lane has in his coffee. 5@D was a great bid. The five level belongs to the oppo. DON'T BID YOUR HAND TWICE!|pg||
nt|henryb:  Where I come from Richman's pass would be encouraging partner to bid 6@s|pg||

nt|athene: yes, he can exit with that, but you ruff and just play a trump and now he is endplayed so he only gets one top heart|pg||
nt|amarko: David 4@S looks easy?|pg||
nt|othered1: doesn't appear to have been most effective defense, but it was against 3, not game|pg||
nt|bebechira: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2012&dir=spo&E=0&R=8&T=I|pg||
nt|bebechira: progressive round 8 results|pg||
mb|1C|nt|frankaus: tho its still very light|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: Did declarer really take 12 tricks on last  hand?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Finikiotis 2nd ...Hoffman 3rd|pg||
mb|p|nt|amarko: ah maybe forced trump promotion:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: no he forgot to take the club finesse - just looked at themovie|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4-4-4-1 awkward in many situations|pg||
nt|beauch:  yes declarer needed to ruff a @d in dummy and take @C finesse|pg||
nt|bebechira: the next round we will have Finikiotis-Hoffman...so that will be a battle for final|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nigel: 2@C is any initational hand|pg||
nt|amarko: slams galor|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N showed a weak minor 2-suiter.    It's hard not to abid game on west hand, but some may expect a bit more in high cards.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As long as South ducks a round of clubs, this 1NT looks to be going down|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: if 1@S promises 5+ spades he is a bit stuck|pg||
nt|athene: could rebid a notrump i suppose|pg||
nt|beauch:  easier for us seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|amarko: can they bid it?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|nigel: Not a huge fan of POWER bidding as can be seen by this auction|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: januske will bid 3nt then make it a bit slowly|pg||
nt|othered1: 13 tricks on last hand, rather.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2 down I guess|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|nigel: but Klnger has righted the boat|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|amarko: not 4@D  dont know there methods|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nigel: surprised Bill did not try 4@H he has a great hand for clubs.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I think 4H would show controls in diamonds and hearts but not spades, like before|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|stiffqueen: roger januske will torture about how to get the most out of those minor suits but eventually he will choose one of the many winning lines|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|nigel: so much technology|pg||
nt|othered1: Running scores are available at: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2012&dir=spo&E=0&R=7&T=I  which likely will be more "official" than our match score here|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c4|pc|dT|nt|stiffqueen: ahhh - bad guess me|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A nice attempt at some sort of suicide squeeze by Klinger|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: interesting to duck the first trump - normally with this sort of trump suit you try to cash the AK and leave someone with the master trumps then you can cash things and crossruff|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bebechira: they are bidding 24 in the open room ( the slam hand).. important board ...a lot of imps at stake|pg||
nt|othered1: Finikiotis is in major trouble in this match (the making slam -- not necessairly a huge loss if teammates bid 6@D -- hasn't been compared yet.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: cashing ace of spades and just claiming 9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|beauch:  yes South was very pessimistic here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|nigel: Yep maybe catering for a 4-1 split|pg||

nt|stiffqueen: that means roger is feeling good|pg||
nt|othered1: This result, with west having a pretty sound-looking 1N overcall, is why some players have abandoned the natural meaning|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They have?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, auctions after a strong club and a negative are awkward at the best of times|pg||
mb|1D|nt|amarko: nice easy game for e/w here|pg||
nt|othered1: Raptor overcalls, for exam;ple|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: there are just too many hands opener can hold; you can't show them all, with 1@C-1@D taken away already|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: south should be going for 6@D with this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|stiffqueen: a boring part score hand - januske may bid 2 hearts but e/w are likely to always go about +100|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: 3@D is a pretty serious bid, at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well, this was a pretty good result for the 1NT overcall ... down 1, with a NT partial easy the other way ... in fact, I don't think 3NT by N/S can be stopped|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|stiffqueen: hmm - right sided but the defence can still easily find 6 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps not, but unbiddable and if they  have values for game, they have values to double 1N in many cases.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If they had doubled 1NT (I would have, with the North cards), E/W have a fairly easy escape to 2@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wouldn't advise anyone to give up the natural 1NT overcall ... if you don't have it in the arsenal, hands such as West's are very hard to bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You have to double, then potentially bid NT at a higher level than 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|beauch:  bye andrew and all|pg||
nt|othered1: Very normal contract, and auction, if you open west's junky 12 count.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course north would have liked better diamonds for a 3-level overcall but hands with both minors are difficult to show after opps open a weak-2|pg||
nt|amarko: wow think n/s have good vul save?|pg||
nt|frankaus: next match is likely to be the crucial match - Hoffmam (3rd) plays Finikiotis (2nd)  start time 90 minutes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bebechira: Prescott 36 up now...Finikiotis would not want to loose badly this match|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: I'm not extolling alternate meanings for 1N overcall -- I play it (very) strong myself.  But it's not longer a universal approach.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: i believe garozzo plays a 3@c overcall to show both minors, so he obviously thinks it is a problem hand|pg||
nt|othered1: @S was normal lead on the auction|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|nigel: Looks like 4@d = Minorwood|pg||
nt|amarko: bye David|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: now he has 12 on top|pg||
nt|athene: and the only chance for 13 is a black-suit squeeze on west|pg||
nt|athene: which doesn't work because he doesn't have both of the @CKQ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|stiffqueen: a chance now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|stiffqueen: declarer must play a heart to the ace not finesse - then the last diamond pitching a club for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: now he can unblock the @HK, trump to dummy, cash the hearts throwing clubs, then run the remaining trumps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nigel: Thanks have to go now:)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: but west can throw clubs leaving east to look after that suit|pg||

nt|bjacobs: "Stayman as originally published"?  What does that mean Ed?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|othered1: As long as you include all variations (pupper, muppet, forcing, non-forcing, etc) that's accurate, at least in natural systems.|pg||

nt|othered1: I wouldn't act with east's hand, though some might|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I am talking: 2@D = no major, 2@H = hearts, 2@S = spades ... nothing beyond that.  Of course, the followups are by no means universal|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: west may double a 1nt (or 2@S) rebid now|pg||
nt|othered1: Originally published it was what is called "forcing Stayman" today.  and had some interesing features, like a 3@D rebid by Stayman bidder to ask for a 3-card major.|pg||

mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: 1NT will be a struggle|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|othered1: I don't understand EW's actions at the other table at all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: I can see 5 tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|stiffqueen: ron klinger opened the grubby 11 count as south in the other room leading a rather different contract !|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: this probably 2 off after harms wins the lead and switches a diamond|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: this will likely be 4 imnps to Hoffman (south making 8 or 9 tricks).|pg||
pc|d7|nt|stiffqueen: and switches a diamond....|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Poor players a little distracted withthe incessant screeching of the resident colony of rainbow lorikeets|pg||
nt|othered1: The running score has this 16-14 for Hoffman after 12 boards|pg||
nt|othered1: Another fantasy score here.  South didn't make nearly that many tricks.  |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|stiffqueen: well that may in fact be a good thing for n/s if declarer now loses to the queen of spades - likely 3off |pg||

pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: Anyway, declarer has found another route ... endplaying South|pg||
mc|7|nt|stiffqueen: bruce neill not having a great time as declarer|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Bruce said loudly to Roger, "You enjoy that, did you?" when he won the jack ofhearts. I think he paused unnecessarily at some stage. Roger said, "Sorry, I fell asleep"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North needed to switch to a club, rather than persist with the second heart|pg||
nt|othered1: with assistance from defense.  I don't think @C shift was impossible when in with @D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is where Smith is an essential gadget|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South would have been able to discourage hearts with his diamond play|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I doubt N/S play this|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: i think he did play the 7, and klinger assumed he hadn't|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Down 1 - Gaspar cashed the ace of clubs|pg||

mb|d|nt|nigel: 1@h=spades|pg||
mb|r|an|3s|nt|stiffqueen: poor result in the open room for hoffman this hand - with a 10 card major fit and plenty of big cards 4 spades look seasy |pg||

pc|d9|pg||
nt|othered1: NS play a wide-range 1N opening 12-15.  I don't see many Precision pairs around here announce that, but they simply open 12's and say it was just a judgmental upgrade :(|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|amarko: all roads lead to -2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Should be a nice little pickup here for Finikiotis|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: tricky hand; at first it looks as though the defence can make two spades, two hearts, and a spade ruff, but maybe west will get endplayed|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he is still down|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: tough for harms to find a diamond - 10 imps to prescott|pg||
