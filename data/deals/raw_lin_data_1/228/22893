nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't mention constructive raises - but that is only reason i can imagine for alert|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|psridhar: in general the player with shortness in enemy suit should risk entry into auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe alert as always 3-fit  playing Bergen Raises|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: [i absolutely support that type of full disclosure alert]|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1@h trick , 2 AQ in  black suits each + a @c ruff shoud beat this one|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||

nt|psridhar: @c 9 sry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: udca means  when following suit   low=encouraging or even count   hi=discouraging or odd count  [Upside Down Count Attitude]|pg||
nt|psridhar: @c length in closed hand but he will find it i thk|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: odd/even discard  [when not following suit]   odd=i like this suit   even = discouraging and suit preference |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|saverio: ciao all|pg||
nt|baldfriede: hello all. let's hope we will see a good match|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbf: hearts and spades, at least 4-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roghog:  http://www.bridge.nl/topbridge-algemeen/1635-nedisr2012 has convention cards: click on kaart|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: 4@s can be set by a small @c lead here   but very unlikely :)|pg||
nt|saverio: but E may add something  (not unreasonably)|pg||
nt|saverio: even if bal and no @c control may make him decide for pass|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|saverio: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: van Prooijen is still thinking.....|pg||
nt|saverio: not an easy pass   |pg||
nt|baldfriede: now this is a really weak two|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=5-7|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm al :) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: bah  humbug|pg||
nt|sybarra: very early for you  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: http://www.bridge.nl/topbridge-algemeen/1635-nedisr2012   has links to 5 of 6 convention cards and links to player bio|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: on repeated spade leads you can make 3 nt - but that is too much to ask|pg||
nt|mcsd: 3@D is maximum w should bidd now|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 down in 2 spades versus 3 @d making|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice agreement on the S bid:)|pg||
mb|r|nt|jbgood: looks as if we are in for a SLOW set - again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other vugraph room visible without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

mb|2S|nt|vugraphzbf: yes :(|pg||
nt|jbgood: specs will notice that thinking much and then passing doesnt help much.)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards from 2011 Bermuda Bowl are online   NS:http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Israel/Herbst_Herbst.pdf|pg||

nt|ahollan1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Israel/Herbst_Herbst.pdf|pg||
nt|saverio: now @c A and @c can set it   no more needed to underlead the A   and slowly easier to find|pg||
nt|psyck: not easy but W only showed a disctributional hand with no further interest, didnt think E would go forward when 5 level could be risky with no @c control|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees a little disappointed with his very first bid of this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both rooms offering Voice Commentary|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: thats true    but his DBL was promising 12+  he has 18  and good controls     always easier looking at all hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcy: 3@C probably showing some strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: true, & no has @c discards too...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: this is a lead declarer will not like|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: *now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: South won't like that @H are blocked now|pg||
nt|kemperg: cards not friendly placed for NS|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: so @d & @s towards dummy should see him home|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kemperg: gm Martin|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: there are actually 3 tables in play  operator will tell us about result from the one that is invisible to BBO|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|psridhar: chance for Dutch here...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = game force relay|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = exactly 4@H|pg||
mb|2S!|an|Relay|mb|p|mb|3C!|an|7411 // 5422|nt|ahollan1: 2@S RELAY     3@C = 7411 or 5422|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|psridhar: such relay auctions reveal lots but pave for accuracy in bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 3@D now asks controls  [A=2 K=1]   but possible clarifies  the exact shape|pg||
nt|psridhar: ideally the potential final declarer shd relay :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N as 4 controls does fit my guess  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|psridhar: that way only the opening lead is helped by dummy's assets revealed in auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N should also say  max opening|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|psridhar: if @s Queen were the @h queen in Muller's hand, Wijs can visualise 6N declared by him|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H  [end signal]   then next bid signoff|pg||
nt|psridhar: anyway 4@S fetches 13 imps to the dutch |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psridhar: the Relay helped apprently|pg||
nt|psridhar: apparently|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how high  3rd seat  favorable  Louk?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: another part score battle (if battle is the right word considering the previous one)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psyck: a typical 1st seat fav vul bid...|pg||
nt|sybarra: was typing could well try 4 @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: there's your answer :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and he did |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if i had any money  i would have bet on 4@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  30 hcp and 10 trumps may make anybody think of slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: no shy Brink|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  And N will think @DK is well placed|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|5D|nt|niekbrink: Frank Bakkeren plays another session with Ron Schwartz|pg||
nt|niekbrink: Lotan fischer will arrive shortly|pg||
nt|muppe: Here NS has slightly misfit, will see how high they will bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes only @H position for slam he thinks:)|pg||
mb|p!|nt|vugraphzcy: just like yesterday there is a 3rd table, not broadcasted by BBO but we will give you the results, 1board, 2@H N C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: E doesnt think much of his 5 bagger:)|pg||
nt|saverio: N hasnt a tool to show 2 suiter it seems |pg||
nt|sybarra: the guys from Neth. not exactly shiy |pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly not shy :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
nt|kemperg: this is expensive|pg||
nt|gsper:  And Ss pass may also encourage N|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: Lotan Fisher hasn't arrived yet. I don't know why. Till then Frank Bakkeren will play. This pair also played the first session|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: there is a 3rd table, not broadcasted by BBO but we will give you the results as well. 1st board 1nt +1 by north|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: like the previous session I will also give interesting results from the 3rd table, not visible on BBO. board 1 6@S x -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: or he may have required a better hand for it|pg||
nt|kemperg: and Brink gets his reward|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gsper:  There was a case for S to double 5@D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbgood: I withdraw the word "battle" totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW signals  upside-down count & attitude [udca]   odd/even discards|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  carding  for both pairs   upside-down count & attitude [udca]  and odd/even discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator just cleaning up for the historical record|pg||
pc|dA|nt|niekbrink: at the third table I think it is Netherlands EW as well, so this table doesn't compare to the third table|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzcy: if I can remember :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|muppe: This seems to be too high for NS|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roghog:  http://www.bridge.nl/groepen/Wedstrijdzaken/1112/ccBirman&Padon.pdf for NS card|pg||
nt|jjsb:  hello to u all ! |pg||
nt|jjsb:  i will secund a bit our "audio commentator" (thanks to cornelia and peter) here |pg||
nt|jjsb:  this practice is just awesome from the start , in term of quality of play |pg||
nt|jjsb:  and just a privilege to be able to watch it |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: ok, it is Lotan Fisher who is playing, I will correct this|pg||
nt|niekbrink: complicated  hand. many options for both declarer and defenders|pg||
nt|niekbrink: But defenders are favorites to beat this contract|pg||
nt|muppe: not easy return for E, @h would be best this time|pg||
nt|niekbrink: club is not an option I guess. Diamonds doesn't seem pretty either and trump could be expensive if the clubs run|pg||
nt|muppe: But ofcorse he doesnt know that his parntner has @hA|pg||
nt|jjsb:  we can of course all see that this one is going down and it will at the end but South is just trying to picture the different possibilities |pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps they play dbl and pass reversed?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: birman could have cue bid 5@H, to me that is sufficient encouragement with flat hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|niekbrink: well done by Drijver|pg||
pc|c5|nt|muppe: nice|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: good topic for partnership discussion -- when dummy shows Qxx(x) after partner leads from AK -- is your signal count [normal or udca] or suit pref|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: South is  R  Schwartz|pg||
nt|jjsb:  the problem for the defense is just now |pg||
nt|jjsb:  and the 10 of @c is somehow precising things|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|saverio: i'd think AK and AK enough to show 2 suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk4: unless Bakkeren is a substitute|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is he?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|jjsb:  with what i saw so far in this match im just pretty confident that South will come to the rigth conclusioon|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: or still attitude|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|niekbrink: My information is that Frank Bakkeren indeed is a substitute|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ron Schwartz did not arrive yet. Now you know why, Marshall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the historical record is a ".lin" file that BBO generates |pg||
nt|ahollan1: they have an archive of the .lin files from all vugraph mathes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: matches|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are also some 3rd party sites that have collected the records|pg||
nt|chick:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph_archives/vugraph_archives.php|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcsd: Now if he plays for ruffing @H he will promote T@C for @S|pg||
nt|mcsd: for South|pg||
nt|chick:  These matches usually get added to the archives within a day or two|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the .lin files can be loaded examined without logging into BBO|pg||
pc|d4|nt|davidb: S  pass  was  F  - ok  having no  wasted  values .rare partner has 2 D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jjsb:  oh , what a suprise , we have to say 'nicely done" again :) |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jbgood: and even if he doesnt - he may be forced|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: south will need to keep all @D |pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: but now he is ok|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Ron arrived a few minutes ago I am told|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so he will probably replace Bakkeren shortly|pg||
nt|niekbrink: I trust Roel to tell us when he does|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He will change the name when he does|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: if you use the original windows version of bbo - you have your own copy of the .lin|pg||

nt|psridhar: as here|pg||

nt|psridhar: sorry i could not find any other adjective :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: Roland might help !|pg||
nt|psridhar: When Muller wins an early trick in defense we all get to know how much thinking is needed to win at this game |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|psridhar: defender's duty is to CONSTRUCT probable hands before playing at such times|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||

pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: other table visible without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: i would think a trump lead called for|pg||
nt|ahollan1: marshall - you're very faint|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzcy: just like the other sessions I will also give you some results of the 3rd table, not broadcasted by BBO|pg||

nt|vugraphzcy: 1. 1nt= O 2. 2@H+1 O 3.4@S=S 4.4@S=S|pg||
nt|jjsb:  tricky hand to play , trying to create some commujication problem for the defense its possible declarer will play @h first |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: The players are Fisher - Schwartz NS and van Prooijen - Muller EW|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: after the 2nd best @s lead, W could have done better to switch to @h|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: i bet Muller would open 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: wonnder why Wijs didnt open 2@s , maybe he needed spots in @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: AJ109XX,K10X,109X,J perhaps|pg||
nt|psridhar: or does it show @s + minor?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|3C|nt|psridhar: 3@D showing limit raise now?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@h may be down on @s ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his 2@S would be 5-10 HCP, (5)6@S|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ahollan1: maybe didn't like suit quality 2nd seat vul??|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@s is the spot and the Dutch at the moment are far away from it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and won't ever get close to it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  1@C and 1@D opening can be 2-card suit  --- not sure how that works, still reading the CC|pg||
nt|psridhar: If that @H suit qualifies for 1@H, that @s suit qualifies for 2@s acc to me|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: "1 D = CAN BE SHORT WHEN 3-4 OR 2-5 IN MINORS IF 12-14 BAL"|pg||
nt|psridhar: however the Israelis are guessing too..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that is same explanation for 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i thought maybe 1@C 1@D would be different ranges if balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i still think that -- so betting convention card is typo|pg||
nt|psridhar: Schwartz guessed well to pass that 4@C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: maybe 3@C showed both minors??|pg||
nt|psridhar: possible -a passed hand bidding new suit at 3 level usually has the safety of fit for opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only reason NS didn't get to 4@S -- neither player bid @S|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psridhar: When u hold an intermediate 6 card suit such as that N you should factor that ....bid it at your earliest|pg||

nt|mcsd: in the last sets we can hope for swingy bidding|pg||
nt|niekbrink: probably only bid it if EW bid diamonds ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: and we are back|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|mcsd: especially when one team was 24 imps ahead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D    can be canape with longer @C or @S  but often weak NT|pg||
nt|muppe: 3@s probably mixed raise showing 4@s and 7-9p|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: It is of course van Prooijen - Verhees playing at the 3rd table, sry|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mcsd: now only 13|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it was an excellent grand slam - let's hope NS in the other room bid it too - otherwise it's a bit of a random swingf |pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and 3 NT seems a likely contract here, so...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H usually less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=a) 4441@D, any  b) 4@S, BAL, 12-14  c) 5+@S 4+@D, min  or 55 MAX|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 2 down in 3 nt and another 9?|pg||
nt|muppe: @d lead would be best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D|pg||
nt|friggi: brave bid|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: Strong @c & Canape openings for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N natural invite -- how'd that get in there??|pg||
nt|niekbrink: declarer has a lack of communication to his hand if he doesn't want to play trumps|pg||
nt|muppe: Declarer might not ruff this to get trick with @sK. |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 2nt board 3ntx C and 3rd board 3@H +2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mcsd: a negative respose of 2@s should make S calm|pg||
nt|jbgood: but how calm? |pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe going for 4 @s?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we shall know in about twenty minutes :) |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@C by south (i think) since north has more or less denied a spade stop, and south hand cant force to 5 level|pg||
nt|kemperg: no problem , just 3 losers|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW never had a chance to find @C|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzbf: not so calm :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  D by E hardly realistic|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|mcsd: this is not a calm bidd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = weak nt  [12-14], not 4333|pg||
nt|jjsb:  4@s is probably making with a squeeze i think itsp ossible @d break the squeeze |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, such a strange system, & i used to think 2NT is never to play :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Herbst brothers  lead vs NT = attitude    carding  odd/even|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees: funny that they have this option|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  2@D had other possible hand types  2N clarified|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: actually Louk trow away one more @D so didn't have any choice, saw a rare down possibility...|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Roel |pg||
nt|ahollan1: how about duck @D  then @S finesse before @C?|pg||
nt|friggi: sure|pg||
nt|friggi: but based on layout|pg||
nt|friggi: not the best bid here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a double of 2@S by drijver is not a stretch|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: no :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: repeated spade leads would have sunk the contract, now might make|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jbgood: 300 is 7 imps|pg||
nt|mcsd: now only chace to make is double finesse in @D|pg||
nt|niekbrink: now declarer looses 1 spade, 2 clubs and 1 heart|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcsd: which is off|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|gsper:  The voice commentators seem to side with me on that|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1 [5@S=]  other table 4@S East  down 1  [@CK led]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my theory is get in cheap as possible|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: North has bid well here - without knowing all the systemic ramifications, it looks like he was showing four-card spade support (4@s) and good diamond values (3@d)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: yes, they needed to 'wrongside' it to make|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: there's a chance that 2@Hx was -2|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1 was a push  but not the way you might think   our table  5@C-1  other room  1@H-1|pg||
nt|kemperg: right, but with only 3@Hs and a useless @SQ?|pg||

mb|3H!|an|3154|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 4@h is a filthy Vul game that makes- @s Jack inside , no @s ruff, @h J10 falling ....|pg||

nt|psridhar: about 10 % game Al? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: better that that played by south :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3N is a winner too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N rather than 4@H to protect the @CAQ??|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psridhar: but superior to 4@h slightly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead ostensibly 2nd/4th|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3N makes alright but not a lock -play it on a @c lead when @h dont break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand easy when you see @H and @S both split 3-3|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes wijs hasnt seen it and must be sweating|pg||
nt|psridhar: right now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but try planning the play without that unauthorized information|pg||
nt|psridhar: might try to steal a @d trick and duck a @H -down only if they can take 1@h + 1@d + 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: any chance of @D to 10??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all lines get jumbled if @H not 33, so probably just play @H from the top|pg||

nt|sybarra: nice way to get the up trick |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: close decision whether to treat south hand as one or two suited|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: another  "multi-purpose" 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: counting opponent's distribution    almost seems like it isn't fair|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how many clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: unfortunately the players are not nice showing their cards sometimes, so I regularly have to guess...|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: at ths vzlnerability I would vote for two-suited|pg||
mb|3H|nt|baldfriede: vulnerability*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: force them to do one session as OPERATOR|pg||

nt|sybarra: been there done that Roel,  some are better than others re that |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what about it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you can nearly always find some reason not to bid, and you are protected somewhat by Lebensohl over double|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: 4@H is courageous |pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: NS play natural but they open with shorter minor when balanced sometimes if I rememver correctly, thus 1@d.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: East could hold 4@D and longer @C or @S, but never longer @H |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: even 4405 possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just typing that Roel :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as Sir Humphrey Appleby might have said|pg||
nt|sybarra: was 4 @C enough? |pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: then A ask for @C return|pg||
nt|gsper:  I rather expected 3NT by N. Experts tend to that kind of bid|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mcsd: next please :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|muppe: if 12-14 balaced that is, spec corrects|pg||
nt|sybarra: voice discussion was about whether to bid at all with W |pg||
nt|sybarra: of course easier for us to see answer |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i can't imagine not bidding either 4@C or 5@C|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees said it at the table, walking away to get coffee so he didn't have to know the answer|pg||
nt|baldfriede: gives you another option|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd also try to claime 100 honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  I am a bidder |pg||
nt|sybarra: in rubber bridge for sure!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there i definitely claim -- in dup, i can only try|pg||
nt|sybarra: with 100 honors,  5 clubs hardly costs |pg||

nt|fabsayc: i am not so sure he has all the info to get this right|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: on b.3|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: 5@s was doubled|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in 1970s i played a few versions   Blue Team Club  and  Roman [when it was allowed]|pg||
nt|kemperg: too fast for me Goran:)|pg||

nt|sybarra: what was thought to be the advantage of canape?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: pass must be forcing |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Italians brought it to world attention with Neopolitan Club [which became Blue Team Club], Roman and a few other systems that were short lived|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N normally has slam ambition, 4@D confirms willingness to cooperate  so PASS definitely forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not 100% certain that 4@D confirmed canape|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: It is, Verhees indicated it could even be 56|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S instead of 4@D might have been more helpful to Verhees|pg||
nt|friggi: sure ..greed is alw...in place:)|pg||
nt|pelu:  and 3NT easy game for EW - even 12 tricks|pg||
nt|jjsb:  well that really how important is this "practice" game for them |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: brink didn't trow @H10 first time, but the J, which confused Drijver....|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2/1 auction   1@H-1N//2@D-2@H|pg||
nt|niekbrink: south will find another bid|pg||
nt|muppe: But west cannot really pass without seeing his parnerts hand|pg||
nt|niekbrink: agree. what I wonder is, if 2 spades shows diamonds, how do they show clubs?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: or was 2 spades just any minor?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: their convention card isn't clear about it|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: I think just a minor, but not sure, couldn't hear everything|pg||
nt|muppe: NS hand fits well. South thinkin whether dbl or 4@S?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: what happens if south waits long enough and then doubles?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: can north still run?|pg||
nt|muppe: i think he cant|pg||
nt|muppe: but im not expert on law issues|pg||
nt|jjsb:  there is 7 tricks coming because of the nice @c situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at this vuls north can afford a somewhat offshape double|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: hope pard understands that |pg||
nt|sybarra: the "that" being 5 @C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i have no idea what DBL over 3@H would show|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand does support recent article in ACBL Bulletin [by Mike Lawrence?] about efficacy of interfering over 1M-2N [game force raise]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note that if 4@D does show canape, then east has 4@H  with 5+@H and 4+@D he would open 2@D, not 1@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS play a true Multi 2@D opener  to cover weak typical 2@H/@S opener and some strong hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: I thought that in bridge nowadays any 12 count is an opening bid, especially if you have 2 aces|pg||
nt|muppe: 4-3-3-3 12 count, maybe it's their style not to open then|pg||
nt|jjsb:  redouble here probably with a 5 card suite asking partner to bid 2@c |pg||
nt|fabsayc: must be north thinking, east had automatic pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 7: 3@D +3 W|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: if it is not your style to open this hand, is worth an invite now, or will he just bid game?|pg||
nt|muppe: Most certainly would open|pg||
nt|jjsb:  there is some different defense on a penalty double of 1 nt the important things is that to discuss it with partner !! |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: escape mechanism indeed....|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@S clearly constructive in their methods, as pointed out by a kib|pg||

nt|jjsb:  its not a clear situation he knows there is a fit in major but in other he has some "defensive" value |pg||
nt|mdgraham: (or -500 in 2M, of course)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most pairs would not be sure of their agreements here, you suspect - is double 100% penalty? |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: all in favor of a pass or anyone wants to score big with N and run the risk of EW finding a better play?|pg||

nt|baldfriede: he may think about 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he already bid 2NT, cant play that song again|pg||
nt|baldfriede: which looks a lot more difficult to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees: either 54 or 4441|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jjsb:  not that u can bid 5@d of course |pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Roel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i forgot about 4441 :(|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: or not|pg||
nt|muppe: NS can make 5@c, 3nt is not making if they find @s lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it's a legal call :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it would have worked better if Verhees was on same page|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with East as declarer  defense can't attack @C|pg||
nt|niekbrink: dbl for a spade lead?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|niekbrink: that will do the job for WE|pg||
nt|niekbrink: EW|pg||
nt|niekbrink: any other lead will be counting over tricks|pg||
nt|muppe: Top spade or small?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: board 5 has been corrected to 3nt -1 N|pg||
nt|davidb: why not H?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: on a heart lead south can make 13 tricks I think|pg||
nt|gsper:  Where will the 10th trick come from?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|muppe: ok @h|pg||
nt|jjsb:  ok so a no brainer at the play apparently |pg||
pc|hT|nt|muppe: He might just play for 9 tricks, now he has a finesse in @h.|pg||
nt|muppe: oh sry he has 9 top tricks now|pg||
nt|niekbrink: not if drijver plays low|pg||
nt|niekbrink: then he has 10 top tricks, but no possibility to make 13|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently 4@C was cue bid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yep|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|niekbrink: if drijver plays the J of hearts, he can win the ace, finesse heart to dummy. play 10 of diamonds for a diamond finess. repeat eh finesse in diamonds and cross to the king of clubs ...|pg||
nt|niekbrink: to cash the 13 diamond and his 3th heart|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so, 3heart tricks, 6 club tricks and 4 diamond tricks - 13|pg||
nt|jjsb:  some security play avalaible in @d|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|niekbrink: now he lacks communication for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|muppe: @h8 was good, now he cant risk @d finesse or he could go down|pg||
pc|h7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: just in case East has A109x|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jjsb:  ok so the @h finesse will be safe now |pg||
pc|d5|nt|niekbrink: of course, south was not gonna take all these risks and probably just cashing his tricks|pg||
nt|muppe: he can try @dQ if E covers|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|niekbrink: was the hesitation long enough?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: no|pg||
nt|niekbrink: it was not|pg||
pc|h6|nt|muppe: wd by E not to cover|pg||
pc|h8|nt|muppe: still nice result for Israel|pg||
nt|niekbrink: interesting. East doubled a contract that could have gone off and after it was made with an overtrick several people say that he defended well... :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: and the Neth. team not all that much older |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe average a couple of years older |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought muller is a couple of decades older|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe yes on that |pg||
nt|sybarra: all of 40?|pg||
nt|davidb: the 2 israeli young  pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pics of some of the players available by clicking on the name at http://www.bridge.nl/topbridge-algemeen/1635-nedisr2012|pg||
nt|davidb: a tea hand..|pg||
nt|sybarra: I met Dr. Schwartz and the young team in Philly a couple of years ago at WBF event|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 6@H made on board 6, so the Israeli continue their streak....|pg||
nt|davidb: Ron's  father 2010|pg||

nt|sybarra: name is Gabriel |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@C = cue  either 4-fit or good 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H would show 4-fit but bad hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: grand with an overtrick, in fact|pg||
nt|baldfriede: rather wobbly stopper in @d, but the way cards sit it works|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some entry problems|pg||
pc|dK|nt|niekbrink: but nevertheless :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass to show good @Ds only when 1@D promised a 5crd?|pg||
nt|gsper:  E has a lot of guessing to do, but the bidding may help|pg||
nt|gsper:  You may be right there, Germ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jjsb:  im afraid i will not be able to help u on the bidding ... :) |pg||

nt|mdgraham: You'd bet they will get there, but it might take some time|pg||
nt|jjsb:  im ok til 1nt :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: they play precision with some adjustments, also too impossible for me to describe unfortunately|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: 1st question for NS --  who's on lead???|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C quess is the clue|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|niekbrink: but played in west, not so easy for N to lead a club|pg||
nt|jjsb:  i have been told that 3@s is showing that shape specifically |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Muller is indeed asking for shape etc|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|muppe: but too risky to find those saves |pg||
nt|ahollan1: just confirmed  that link gets picture of all 12 participants of this team match|pg||
nt|gsper:  Phew!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|muppe: in imps, they might cost too much|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after @S lead -- declarer would try to guess which minor suit to play for @S discard|pg||
nt|jjsb:  i think its possible here East doesnt lnow if west got 7 or 6 of @h |pg||
nt|jjsb:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 4nt was keycards, 5@H showed 2 as @DA is useless opposite a void, which was shown already|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jjsb:  the play is not all academic as its point out i nthe audio |pg||
nt|mdgraham: when pard jumps to a grand - put down dummy|pg||
nt|jjsb:  u have 12 sure |pg||
nt|mdgraham: clubs 4-1 might break, as if you cash AK the 89 go from dummy, and the 7 will become good - but here all is well|pg||
nt|jjsb:  important sentence to remember in bridge when ur in a very good contract try to think of some bad situation when ur in a very poor contract try to imagine some lucky and nice distribution |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: and preferably with a pokerface|pg||
nt|jjsb:  can someone tell him he cant go down :) |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: just the players, no girlfriends|pg||
nt|friggi: sry wife..making problems|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|gsper:  S knew little about the E hand. Trying fr a @C ruff made sense|pg||
nt|gsper:  *for|pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps S would not duck @CQ when he had a doublton, so leader would do it right|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|d7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: do they have time for girlfriends?|pg||
nt|friggi: not the best %play|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|muppe: with @h 3-3, 11 tricks|pg||
nt|baldfriede: playing the 4 before the 9 is psychological to build up discarding pressure. "lots of more to come" is the message|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: you do not need to answer that question David |pg||
nt|ahollan1: David -- after winning the trials, did the team have a choice of going to European Championship vs Olympiad?|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing relay, the hand might be too good for 4@H|pg||

pc|s5|nt|psridhar: +3 imps instead of -4 , failure to bid 5@c cost 7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm in arizona  during daylight savings  same time as california   otherwise 1  hour earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: information for Muller is inconsistent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DA could be from AK  [asking attitude]|pg||
nt|psridhar: defense is favourite to beat 4@H here, but they will have to wait for Muller, cd be a long wait|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and failure to DBL 4@H    might convince declarer to just play for @CA onside|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm almost certain he will go down -- can it be made at all?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  it can|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy can make|pg||

nt|xenya: good idea, thanks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one more board after this hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yes i could have passed out the hand -- at least i didn't give them a 2nd chance to get to game|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=10-15 HCP  5+@H and 4+@D|pg||
nt|jjsb:  again not a surprise we do know what those teams are capable of , still |pg||
nt|jjsb:  interesting board here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: vP can't bid 3@C here -- that would show @H fit|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@S from Verhees??|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: yep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe vP would like to go back and try 3@S now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is why you have practice matches -- to talk about situations that haven't come up before|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 11 tricks in NT without diamond lead....|pg||
mb|4S|nt|niekbrink: the 4 diamond bid is typical in the style of brink and Drijver. |pg||
nt|friggi: NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcy: Fisher is already taking out 7@H bid....|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: 5 diamonds is a good sacrifice again againgst 4 spades|pg||

nt|friggi: pass|pg||
nt|kemperg: have to leave now, grandchildren are arriving.|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: yes EW has put a pressure on NS, but NS find their good 4@s|pg||
nt|muppe: 4@s looks makeable|pg||
nt|niekbrink: losing a spade and a club|pg||
nt|niekbrink: maybe a heart ruff|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so 10 or 11 tricks I guess|pg||
nt|niekbrink: heart ruff not so easy to find when south is declaring|pg||
nt|muppe: but it's not over yet, E still thinking|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 5d is only 500 i think|pg||
nt|davidb: good  pass F -partner please  decide|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N confirms  12-14 bal, not 4333|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees said he was sleeping, thought it was 4@S instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|muppe: @sJx doesnt look nice for save, he cannot know for sure if 4@s is making or not|pg||
nt|friggi: this will make due to distribution|pg||
nt|gsper:  No, say kibs. Pity I missed the discussion.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: he wasn't making 6@C either|pg||
nt|niekbrink: great lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: brink started "without" thinking a @H, had ofcourse some time to think before a contract was certain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure how DBL affects the responses to this stayman-like 3@C relay|pg||
nt|friggi: bad dbl|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: the trouble is, if you raise to 5@S, you are telling NS they can make a slam.... |pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they don't have much room left to find the best one, if indeed there is one|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: might bid normally "thru" doubles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D shows 4/5@D and NOT 4@H/@S|pg||

pc|c2|nt|muppe: yes had east not ruffed, it would have been more interesting|pg||
nt|niekbrink: how?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: declarer can ruff a heart in hand, finess a club and then find out he needs clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|gsper:  A technically competent kib confirms that it was one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: wd guys |pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: Meckstroth-Rodwell have a good treatment after bids like 5@S - they invert pass and double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought 4@D forced 4@H to signoff -- but obviously it was something else|pg||
nt|davidb: on board  9 brink  played great to make 4H |pg||
nt|sybarra: worried maybe @D's 4/0 |pg||
nt|friggi: toolate|pg||

nt|gsper:  Are Andy and Peter this silent, or is my connection bad again?|pg||

pc|d4|nt|gsper:  Looks like -1, but crossruffs are nasty to analyse|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: pass requests double (penalty pass or strong slam try) and double says "I'm not sure what we should be doing"|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: just in case not @HJT doubleton|pg||
mb|2D|nt|friggi: forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the thing about the pass (requests double) is that responder doesn't have to double if he holds a very slam-suitable hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|friggi: now 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and the agressive Dutch again! |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and board 10 (the 7@H) also flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL promising both majors?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: that's how we were taught by Marty Bergen|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what is consensus about vanProoijen's reopening DBL vs Schwartz selling to 3@H?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|muppe: Here declarer will probably guess @s and can discard @d loser on 4th @h when @h are 3-3 so 9 tricks|pg||

nt|mdgraham: doubt-showing redouble? |pg||

nt|fabsayc: anything to avoid a natural bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: 1h is 12-14 balanced or unbalanced with clubs and diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thought Verhees might open strong 1@C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if he still opens 1N if partner is NOT a passed hand|pg||
