mb|p|nt|athene: when dummy is obviously worthless, the defence's aim is always to avoid giving declarer any finesses|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: but sometimes you have to avoid letting him make small trumps with ruffs as well|pg||

pc|hA|nt|athene: i.e. asking for an unusual lead|pg||
nt|panosk: can go down with spade ruff, no? |pg||
nt|athene: but when a hand that has pre-empted doubles a freely-bid contract it is often because of some unexpected ruffing value|pg||

mb|1S|an|alert|nt|muppe: I think its too risky to pass partners balancing dbl, u might easily have game or even slam in @s.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceak:  I agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: 3NT or, bid hard and this time making|pg||
nt|iceak:  If a slam in @s - 2@c would never be passed|pg||

nt|athene: i.e. @C@H or @D@S?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|athene: east may force to 6@H now, which is a pretty bad contract, but can make, with the double club finesse|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|athene: 3@C pass/correct; willing to play 3@C facing the rounded suits or 3@D otherwise|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|athene: west just wants to double them, but east probably won't let him, especially given the vulnerability|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: east might continue with 4@D now, trying for slam in hearts|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: west will bid 4@H over that, and take east's bidding box away so he can't go any higher :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|athene: south might lead the @SK i suppose, hoping for @SK, @SA, ruff, and @HK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: a bit optimistic perhaps, when opponents are looking for slam and you have a ten count|pg||
