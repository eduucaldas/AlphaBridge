mb|4S|mb|p|nt|saverio: 4@s can be set by a small @c lead here   but very unlikely :)|pg||
nt|saverio: but E may add something  (not unreasonably)|pg||

nt|saverio: now @c A and @c can set it   no more needed to underlead the A   and slowly easier to find|pg||
nt|psyck: not easy but W only showed a disctributional hand with no further interest, didnt think E would go forward when 5 level could be risky with no @c control|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees a little disappointed with his very first bid of this match|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|saverio: thats true    but his DBL was promising 12+  he has 18  and good controls     always easier looking at all hands|pg||

nt|rv: 3@s good tactical bid|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|niekbrink: 4spades will be 4 off it think|pg||
nt|rv: Brink needs to double this|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rv: incidentally on (3@c)-p-(3@s), what would 4@c/4@d be from North? should 4@c be majors exposing ppossible psyche and 4@d show @d+maj (most likely @hs)?|pg||
nt|davidb: N  is afraid  they have a slam|pg||
nt|rv: incidentally if 3@c was passed around, I play 4@c to show majors and 4@d as @d+major from North hand|pg||
nt|rv: this is something for partnerships for discuss|pg||
nt|rv: Drijver has to guess now since he didn't show his hand in 1 bid earlier (4@c/4@d if their pd did possess that convention)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 2 small clubs are not a great holding in this auction. I guess Drijver will pass. But Brink might have (a lot) more...|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: How wrong could I be...|pg||
nt|rv: does slam make if declarer can ruff out @sQ and pitch @c on @SJ|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: his 2 small clubs were even enough to introduce them at the 5-level... ;)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: sry, @c lead will beat slam though |pg||
pc|cT|nt|niekbrink: with the hearts breaking this will be 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: good 3@s bid by Padon though, on another day it migth have fetched double digit swing|pg||
nt|davidb: agree|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|rv: 2@d looks like single major, usually 6+cards, woolsey convention|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|d|an|4!H|nt|niekbrink: we could say this match is about the real world championship as the winners of the transnationals in Veldhoven play against the winners of the Bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2@D in Holland: multi-landy..|pg||
nt|imp_jan: right kind of Super Cup|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 2D is a good hand with 5+ major or 6+ minor|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 2spades would have been a worse hand|pg||
nt|davidb: difficult  for  EW  to have a plus score ..|pg||
nt|rv: on Birman's double, I presume Brink's 2@h shows suitnatural, he would redouble if he wanted Drijver to bid his suit|pg||
nt|rv: Brink's pass of 2@d double is usially played as wanting to play there|pg||
nt|rv: usually|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcx: That's more or less what Drijver just said, Venky, but he also said they have not really discussed this specific auction|pg||
nt|rv: with Brink's actual hand, I might not bid 2@h and redouble asking pd to bid his suit (likely to be @s)|pg||
