nt|lady007:  welcome to the final of the white house juniors|pg||
nt|lady007:  we saw 2 very close matches yesterday, lets hope it will be just as exciting today!|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we are go|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: lose by 19, because they should lead by 20 :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lool|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|2D|nt|lady007:  on the first board EW can make 4@s, even with the bad breaks, but they shouldnt get any higher|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzbn: they play Capp (transfers)  over 1M  -  X  - |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: so 2@s is a weak  raise |pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @S guess i think|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan open teams national trials segment 2/4 from lahore.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbn: I missed the bidding but the contract is 2NT by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: they will bid 4s and will come down to find the trumps quuen|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lady007:  Fisher leads his nice heart sequence instead of his singleton, because he has good spades and is not looking for a ruff|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan Open teams National Trials from Lahore|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: @cQ can be only vital card of the whole deal|pg||
nt|lady007:  now lets see how van den Bos should play. he is probably worried about spades 4-1, but the bidding makes it more likely its with north than with south|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzyf: if you misguess can eliminate @c and @d and let them open the @h|pg||
nt|bebechira: queen even|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but won't work here|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3d?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: reverse flannery 2@S response would work on this hand|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lady007:  he pitches a diamond, because if diamonds are 32, he can always discard a club on the diamonds later|pg||
nt|lady007:  north might have made it more difficult for declarer here to duck his ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi all |pg||
nt|bebechira: hi Shirley, Martin|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|d3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bobholl: why not dennis :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: because North has both @h|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzbn: Farrukh planning discards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: fist on the mouth|pg||
nt|bebechira: ambitious contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  hi all :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  welcome back for the exciting conclusion of this intense match|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is the 3rd and final session of this final|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  hi dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: hi marshall|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Mashall |pg||
nt|marlowepi:  hi shirley:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: in case both teams finish tied Netherlands Red wins the tournament as they were ranked higher in the Swiss|pg||
nt|bebechira: it will not happen twice Dennis|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  what if only one team finishes tied?:)|pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: we had it 3 or 4 years ago, tie-break in both semi-final and final|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  do we know why the organizers use that tie-break method instead of extra boards?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only if east ducks club queen can i see any hope for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: there was a reason, but can't remember it|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bobholl: n already place after the @D :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: nice|pg||
nt|bobholl: placed|pg||
nt|xenya:  an ambitious 3N -- 1@S showed both majors?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: no doubt to be sure the tournament finishes at a specific time|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably has to do with time schedules for flights home |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bobholl: J@H his only possibilty|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done by joris (or just lucky ?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this final consists of 3 sessions of 14 boards|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|lady007:  declarer cant ruff his club anymore, but he can discard it on the diamonds. so 10 tricks it is|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bobholl: one @S and then @C would have been better|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

nt|vugraphzcy: Welcome back at the practise match between 2 world champions|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|saverio: ciao all|pg||
nt|baldfriede: hello all. let's hope we will see a good match|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzbf: hearts and spades, at least 4-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
mb|d|nt|roghog:  http://www.bridge.nl/topbridge-algemeen/1635-nedisr2012 has convention cards: click on kaart|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: both teams won at Veldhoven last year, as you all might remember|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|2H|nt|saverio: 4@s can be set by a small @c lead here   but very unlikely :)|pg||
nt|saverio: but E may add something  (not unreasonably)|pg||
nt|saverio: even if bal and no @c control may make him decide for pass|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|saverio: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: van Prooijen is still thinking.....|pg||
nt|saverio: not an easy pass   |pg||
nt|baldfriede: now this is a really weak two|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=5-7|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm al :) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: bah  humbug|pg||
nt|sybarra: very early for you  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS fairly natural, EW Tarzan Precision|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: http://www.bridge.nl/topbridge-algemeen/1635-nedisr2012   has links to 5 of 6 convention cards and links to player bio|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: on repeated spade leads you can make 3 nt - but that is too much to ask|pg||
nt|mcsd: 3@D is maximum w should bidd now|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 down in 2 spades versus 3 @d making|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice agreement on the S bid:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS playing Support Doubles, so highly likely that 2@h shows four trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: looks as if we are in for a SLOW set - again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other vugraph room visible without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kemperg: Goodmorning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbf: yes :(|pg||
nt|jbgood: specs will notice that thinking much and then passing doesnt help much.)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards from 2011 Bermuda Bowl are online   NS:http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Israel/Herbst_Herbst.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/vanprooijen-verhees.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Israel/Herbst_Herbst.pdf|pg||
nt|saverio: now @c A and @c can set it   no more needed to underlead the A   and slowly easier to find|pg||
nt|psyck: not easy but W only showed a disctributional hand with no further interest, didnt think E would go forward when 5 level could be risky with no @c control|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees a little disappointed with his very first bid of this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both rooms offering Voice Commentary|pg||
mb|d|nt|saverio: thats true    but his DBL was promising 12+  he has 18  and good controls     always easier looking at all hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcy: 3@C probably showing some strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: true, & no has @c discards too...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: this is a lead declarer will not like|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: *now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: South won't like that @H are blocked now|pg||
nt|kemperg: cards not friendly placed for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the Netherlands need a few swings - this may produce one, but possibly not the way they are hoping for|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|psyck: so @d & @s towards dummy should see him home|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|baldfriede: and hence dscards the k|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gsper:  Hi all|pg||

nt|kemperg: Hi Goran and Roel|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|kemperg: gm Martin|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are actually 3 tables in play  operator will tell us about result from the one that is invisible to BBO|pg||
nt|sybarra: this isnt a bad spot, just @C's do not break |pg||
pc|cA|pc|h3|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: think ricco trying to see if there is a "Plan B" |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room started with board 15  so they'll see comparison results, we'll have to check movie :(|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|saverio: @d Q saved the day :)|pg||

nt|bebechira: any imp important |pg||
nt|fabsayc: spectators see more than 2 down actually|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: great to see that the sponsors of this tournament (Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford) are watching live at the table|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably they are right...|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|mb|4H|nt|grebrof: hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: Sorry got disconnected ....4@s is being played |pg||
nt|lady007:  2@d transfer, showing hearts|pg||
nt|lady007:  EW can even make 6@h here on the very lucky layout of the cards, but most likely they will get to 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|lady007:  Fisher bid 4@s because of his 64 but he wont buy a very usefull dummy. this can get expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan open teams national trials FINAL segment 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: I DONT bid on west garbage|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  the best reason for bidding on the W garbage is that doing so might assist you in your choice of lead against the final contract. feedback from E could be crucial|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well either 4@H or 5@D is better, but west has to find a club lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: that lead not bad for declarer |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|bobholl: juniors bid 4@H seniors like me 3@H :)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: routine +1|pg||
nt|lady007:  this will be at least 800|pg||
nt|bobholl: but i have always been a chicken |pg||
nt|bebechira: coffee hand?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzyf: they lead 4th best against 3NT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lady007:  hi david|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: after these one is gonna be 5 min.break tks.all|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i find it a bit odd to lead a spade. why not attack the suit that can provide the most tricks when it is right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: so van den Bos knows that they cannot cash 4 @ss now|pg||
nt|sybarra: specs suggesting 6 @D by S pretty good  |pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzbe: these is the last board in these round the next one will start at 5pm CET (in 1h30min) thanks all :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzbe: the last board in these round,next one is starting in 15 min. time,tks all :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|ady: e/w can make 12 tricks in hearts as they lay    but  this will be a poor result for Israel|pg||
nt|lady007:  if EW can avoid playing diamonds, declarer might face a nast guess to avoid 1100|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: next round is gonna start in 15 min. tks all :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|hJ|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|h8|nt|lady007:  west can ruff the next diamond but it will be from a natural trump trick. 800 it is|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzbe: 5 min.break :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: thanks all|pg||

nt|vugraphzcy: there is also a 3rd table, I will give you some results during the game as well. 1st board 5@DE-2|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: how high  3rd seat  favorable  Louk?|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: another part score battle (if battle is the right word considering the previous one)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: a typical 1st seat fav vul bid...|pg||
nt|sybarra: was typing could well try 4 @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: there's your answer :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and he did |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if i had any money  i would have bet on 4@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  30 hcp and 10 trumps may make anybody think of slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: no shy Brink|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  And N will think @DK is well placed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: Frank Bakkeren plays another session with Ron Schwartz|pg||
nt|niekbrink: Lotan fischer will arrive shortly|pg||
nt|muppe: Here NS has slightly misfit, will see how high they will bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes only @H position for slam he thinks:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzcy: just like yesterday there is a 3rd table, not broadcasted by BBO but we will give you the results, 1board, 2@H N C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play 2@h opener as a three-suiter (short @d) so East could open a Multi 2@d  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but goes for the pre-empt - good idea at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: E doesnt think much of his 5 bagger:)|pg||
nt|saverio: N hasnt a tool to show 2 suiter it seems |pg||
nt|sybarra: the guys from Neth. not exactly shiy |pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly not shy :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
nt|kemperg: this is expensive|pg||
nt|gsper:  And Ss pass may also encourage N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|niekbrink: Lotan Fisher hasn't arrived yet. I don't know why. Till then Frank Bakkeren will play. This pair also played the first session|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: there is a 3rd table, not broadcasted by BBO but we will give you the results as well. 1st board 1nt +1 by north|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: like the previous session I will also give interesting results from the 3rd table, not visible on BBO. board 1 6@S x -1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 590|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: talking about swings...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck: or he may have required a better hand for it|pg||
nt|kemperg: and Brink gets his reward|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gsper:  There was a case for S to double 5@D|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|jbgood: I withdraw the word "battle" totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW signals  upside-down count & attitude [udca]   odd/even discards|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  carding  for both pairs   upside-down count & attitude [udca]  and odd/even discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator just cleaning up for the historical record|pg||
nt|mdgraham: disappointing for South with his monster hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: academic really, but it looks like 5@c will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: de Wijs informed Ilan about favorable multi thoughts they play....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|niekbrink: at the third table I think it is Netherlands EW as well, so this table doesn't compare to the third table|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|vugraphzcy: if I can remember :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|muppe: This seems to be too high for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, double looks reasonable - if South is going to bid a game 4@S isn't a bad shot - doesn't work here though, with West having five spades  |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 3rd table same contract, and made as predicted, @Ds are not a problem as only way of playing without losing a trick works...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, you need Kx onside specifically|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: E however is afraid of not being able to ruff the 2nd club, which isn't the case as @Hs are 2-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the low trump could have been led from Axx, of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so that if East plays a second round South can play a third|pg||
nt|mdgraham: from our vantage point, of course, we can see that that won't happen |pg||
pc|c7|nt|roghog:  http://www.bridge.nl/groepen/Wedstrijdzaken/1112/ccBirman&Padon.pdf for NS card|pg||
nt|jjsb:  hello to u all ! |pg||
nt|jjsb:  i will secund a bit our "audio commentator" (thanks to cornelia and peter) here |pg||
nt|jjsb:  this practice is just awesome from the start , in term of quality of play |pg||
nt|jjsb:  and just a privilege to be able to watch it |pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzcy: ok, it is Lotan Fisher who is playing, I will correct this|pg||
nt|niekbrink: complicated  hand. many options for both declarer and defenders|pg||
nt|niekbrink: But defenders are favorites to beat this contract|pg||
nt|muppe: not easy return for E, @h would be best this time|pg||
nt|niekbrink: club is not an option I guess. Diamonds doesn't seem pretty either and trump could be expensive if the clubs run|pg||
nt|muppe: But ofcorse he doesnt know that his parntner has @hA|pg||
nt|jjsb:  we can of course all see that this one is going down and it will at the end but South is just trying to picture the different possibilities |pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps they play dbl and pass reversed?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: birman could have cue bid 5@H, to me that is sufficient encouragement with flat hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|niekbrink: well done by Drijver|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|muppe: nice|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: good topic for partnership discussion -- when dummy shows Qxx(x) after partner leads from AK -- is your signal count [normal or udca] or suit pref|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: South is  R  Schwartz|pg||
nt|jjsb:  the problem for the defense is just now |pg||
nt|jjsb:  and the 10 of @c is somehow precising things|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|saverio: i'd think AK and AK enough to show 2 suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk4: unless Bakkeren is a substitute|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is he?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jjsb:  with what i saw so far in this match im just pretty confident that South will come to the rigth conclusioon|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: or still attitude|pg||
pc|s3|nt|niekbrink: My information is that Frank Bakkeren indeed is a substitute|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ron Schwartz did not arrive yet. Now you know why, Marshall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the historical record is a ".lin" file that BBO generates |pg||
nt|ahollan1: they have an archive of the .lin files from all vugraph mathes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: matches|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are also some 3rd party sites that have collected the records|pg||
nt|chick:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph_archives/vugraph_archives.php|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcsd: Now if he plays for ruffing @H he will promote T@C for @S|pg||
nt|mcsd: for South|pg||
nt|chick:  These matches usually get added to the archives within a day or two|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the .lin files can be loaded examined without logging into BBO|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|davidb: S  pass  was  F  - ok  having no  wasted  values .rare partner has 2 D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jjsb:  oh , what a suprise , we have to say 'nicely done" again :) |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|jbgood: and even if he doesnt - he may be forced|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: south will need to keep all @D |pg||
pc|s6|nt|jbgood: but now he is ok|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h6|nt|Walddk4: Ron arrived a few minutes ago I am told|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so he will probably replace Bakkeren shortly|pg||
nt|niekbrink: I trust Roel to tell us when he does|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He will change the name when he does|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you use the original windows version of bbo - you have your own copy of the .lin|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: Birman has seen all of the @C|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gsper:  Hi David|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  NL lost an opportunity there|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  but then, so did Israel:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobholl: 7@S on  with 3 finesses |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  yes and low spade might well even  block suit when E does have Qxxxx|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lady007:  a possible slam hand for NS coming up here|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 15 flat.. 4s bid and made at both tables|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  oh sorry, i thought W had led from KJ8x|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|qasim2003: nice bid given that they are trying to recover alot of imps this segment|pg||
nt|lady007:  they can make both 6@h and 6@s if they guess the spades (and possible the clubs, on a unlikely club lead if played by north)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to small slam   and make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry @C wrong so 6|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  now i see it is the 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|qasim2003: i'd bid 4@h with the S hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: a true yarborough in N hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: (not even a 10 makes it a yarb)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  S would LIKE to bid 3D as a lead-director over 2H, byut that could work out poorly|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Fisher knows that he can save for a probable 500, but decides not to|pg||
mb|p|nt|qasim2003: but 3@h makes so a nice result for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess he 'll show a good "pudding"raise now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@c should show 4@s now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lady007:  hmmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: this reminds me of a friend -  has no dbl in my mind|pg||
nt|lady007:  4@s seems rather passive|pg||
nt|bobholl: joris inspired ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i think he should pass now. 4@s shows a bad hand for slam (else 4@c)|pg||
nt|bebechira: tell him not to pass Dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: without @c lead it's one out of 2 finesses|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 trupms and 12 points doubtfull|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: with @c lead you need @dK onside (best chance)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: you don't finesse @c at trick 1 as you need at least another finesse, take @cA and finesse @d only 1 finesse needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: S has no|pg||
nt|ady: no   not even a try from North   maybe direct raise to 3 limited with their methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: pity but understandable|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: although you need the 4th @d to be good as well...|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bobholl: he likes this :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  at different colors the risk of 3D might be less|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but at these colors it wouldnt take much for N to save at 5D with a fit. here for example:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  of course a save might be ok, but if he has a stiff heart you probably want to defend|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: though 12 tricks can be made    not a good contract|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|grebrof: 2@c will make some tricks thou - especially now - if @ds are played correctly|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now club to king is almost 100%|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  if S has stiff club not so good though|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|grebrof: that was a nobrainger|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||

nt|jbgood: EW were obvioulsy too impressed by S's strong club:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: result not showing in movie yet    but it was another contract going down|pg||
nt|sybarra: could E ever find ace of @H lead or any @H lead?|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi David, nice to have an expert who knows their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: strong club, 18+hcp any |pg||

nt|mdgraham: 3@h=6331|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i would think a trump lead called for|pg||
nt|ahollan1: marshall - you're very faint|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@h quite playable from the West side, can be defeated (club lead) if played by East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: same goes for 6NT as well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see I was wrong about a swing on board 1.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 6NT/@H W needs spades 4-3 to work|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|vugraphzcy: just like the other sessions I will also give you some results of the 3rd table, not broadcasted by BBO|pg||
nt|jjsb:  as its pointed out in the audio ,  4@s is better than 3nt i nthat lay out |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 1. 1nt= O 2. 2@H+1 O 3.4@S=S 4.4@S=S|pg||
nt|jjsb:  tricky hand to play , trying to create some commujication problem for the defense its possible declarer will play @h first |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: The players are Fisher - Schwartz NS and van Prooijen - Muller EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: just guessing, but 4@s may be RKCB for hearts |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 6@H can also work with @H 2-2, but you have to decide immediately....|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|psyck: after the 2nd best @s lead, W could have done better to switch to @h|pg||
nt|niekbrink: EW can make 3 diamonds|pg||

nt|bobholl: but the red kings position he didn't like :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Israel in 4 as well in the open room..so it will be flat|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: in their system van den Bos could have bid 3@h over 1@s as well to show 4@s and good hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but he elected to show a good hand for NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  though a second sapde might find 22 spades in which case he could take the club finesse|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|grebrof: well, S started it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: weak NT coming in action|pg||
nt|lady007:  NS have 25 high card points but on this hand it will probably be east to open 1N!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: favourable diamond position|pg||

nt|Vugraphzbn: beautiful @s9 with declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  west is trying to escape|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  many play a 3S bid over 1N to show this shape|pg||
mb|2D|an|Alerted by van Prooijen|mb|p|nt|ady: your are right marion      west taking evasive action|pg||
nt|lady007:  south is not unhappy about this contract :)|pg||
nt|ady: double?|pg||
nt|lady007:  he will be even happier if north can find a reopening double|pg||
nt|lady007:  but north knows west has both majors|pg||
nt|lady007:  so its not that attractive to reopen|pg||

pc|d6|nt|bebechira: being slow here..it means that we will have results to compare from the closed.. :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzyf: traditional tempo with vLankveld -vdBos and Helmich-Hop|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzyf: Anneke has a much tougher task as operator :)|pg||

nt|mcsd: in the last sets we can hope for swingy bidding|pg||
nt|niekbrink: probably only bid it if EW bid diamonds ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: and we are back|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|mdgraham: I'm told that this board will return in the weekly training :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: the 1633 was known, so a no-brainer to find the ruff...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcsd: especially when one team was 24 imps ahead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D    can be canape with longer @C or @S  but often weak NT|pg||
nt|muppe: 3@s probably mixed raise showing 4@s and 7-9p|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: It is of course van Prooijen - Verhees playing at the 3rd table, sry|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|mcsd: now only 13|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it was an excellent grand slam - let's hope NS in the other room bid it too - otherwise it's a bit of a random swingf |pg||
nt|mdgraham: here's a guess as well - to play the 10 or not....|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: and 3 NT seems a likely contract here, so...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H usually less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=a) 4441@D, any  b) 4@S, BAL, 12-14  c) 5+@S 4+@D, min  or 55 MAX|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@S|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jbgood: 2 down in 3 nt and another 9?|pg||

nt|friggi: brave bid|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|psyck: Strong @c & Canape openings for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N natural invite -- how'd that get in there??|pg||
nt|niekbrink: declarer has a lack of communication to his hand if he doesn't want to play trumps|pg||
nt|muppe: Declarer might not ruff this to get trick with @sK. |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 2nt board 3ntx C and 3rd board 3@H +2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|mcsd: a negative respose of 2@s should make S calm|pg||
nt|jbgood: but how calm? |pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe going for 4 @s?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we shall know in about twenty minutes :) |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@C by south (i think) since north has more or less denied a spade stop, and south hand cant force to 5 level|pg||
nt|kemperg: no problem , just 3 losers|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW never had a chance to find @C|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: not so calm :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  D by E hardly realistic|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|mcsd: this is not a calm bidd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = weak nt  [12-14], not 4333|pg||
nt|jjsb:  4@s is probably making with a squeeze i think itsp ossible @d break the squeeze |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psyck: yes, such a strange system, & i used to think 2NT is never to play :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Herbst brothers  lead vs NT = attitude    carding  odd/even|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees: funny that they have this option|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  2@D had other possible hand types  2N clarified|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: actually Louk trow away one more @D so didn't have any choice, saw a rare down possibility...|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Roel |pg||
nt|ahollan1: how about duck @D  then @S finesse before @C?|pg||
nt|friggi: sure|pg||
nt|friggi: but based on layout|pg||
nt|friggi: not the best bid here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a double of 2@S by drijver is not a stretch|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jbgood: no :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: repeated spade leads would have sunk the contract, now might make|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|jbgood: 300 is 7 imps|pg||
nt|mcsd: now only chace to make is double finesse in @D|pg||
nt|niekbrink: now declarer looses 1 spade, 2 clubs and 1 heart|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mcsd: which is off|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  3N mildly tricky here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|an|X = bid 5!H|mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT a fair contract e/w   but wrecked by the bad diamond split|pg||
nt|lady007:  3nt is a good contract but it is unlikely to make on this lay out (diamonds 41) and van Lankveld didnt believe in such a good hand from his partner and didnt try for game|pg||
nt|lady007:  will south get in with a double?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I would want to be in 7 on this hand |pg||
nt|bebechira: has to be...they had only 30 mins between set1 and set2|pg||
nt|sybarra: how pushy is N?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ady: south may balance|pg||
mb|5S|nt|marlowepi:  of course W likely to lead club K but if not then S still has a safety play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: even 6 is on a finesse or j rd of @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: missing @H ace is likely to be cashed in 7 |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3rd|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|marlowepi:  it doesnt matter since S will accept an invite|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  this probably puts W off the best lead of a spade|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ady: e/w may well play this in 3 diamonds   and have to get diamond right to make that|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi:  yes though hearts always provide one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a spade lead, can set up fourth heart easily|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  he could, but would he?|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  33 hearts much less likely than 32 clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you dont have time for clubs on spade lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  depends where the entries lie|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but point well taken|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobholl: guess this is all relaying do you know the meanings dennis ?|pg||

nt|lady007:  now declarer can even afford to misguess the diamonds|pg||

pc|d4|nt|sybarra: we need Al Holland,  maybe he would know |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lady007:  he can draw 3 rounds of trumps and discard a club on the 3rd heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: he it such an expert on systems|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is with the dropping @D J no @C finesse needed|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: Mashall it that 3/2 comment that likely after club lead?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: no guess   bound to play from the top|pg||

nt|sybarra: nice way to get the up trick |pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: close decision whether to treat south hand as one or two suited|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: another  "multi-purpose" 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: counting opponent's distribution    almost seems like it isn't fair|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how many clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: unfortunately the players are not nice showing their cards sometimes, so I regularly have to guess...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|baldfriede: at ths vzlnerability I would vote for two-suited|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: vulnerability*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: force them to do one session as OPERATOR|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: would indeed work.....|pg||
nt|sybarra: been there done that Roel,  some are better than others re that |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what about it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you can nearly always find some reason not to bid, and you are protected somewhat by Lebensohl over double|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@H is courageous |pg||
pc|hK|nt|muppe: NS play natural but they open with shorter minor when balanced sometimes if I rememver correctly, thus 1@d.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wow, 4@s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: East could hold 4@D and longer @C or @S, but never longer @H |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: even 4405 possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just typing that Roel :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as Sir Humphrey Appleby might have said|pg||
nt|sybarra: was 4 @C enough? |pg||
pc|h5|nt|friggi: then A ask for @C return|pg||
nt|gsper:  I rather expected 3NT by N. Experts tend to that kind of bid|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mcsd: next please :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|muppe: if 12-14 balaced that is, spec corrects|pg||
nt|sybarra: voice discussion was about whether to bid at all with W |pg||
nt|sybarra: of course easier for us to see answer |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i can't imagine not bidding either 4@C or 5@C|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees said it at the table, walking away to get coffee so he didn't have to know the answer|pg||
nt|baldfriede: gives you another option|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd also try to claime 100 honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  I am a bidder |pg||
nt|sybarra: in rubber bridge for sure!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there i definitely claim -- in dup, i can only try|pg||
nt|sybarra: with 100 honors,  5 clubs hardly costs |pg||
nt|ahollan1: with @DAQ onside save works even without honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because Birman will go right in @H|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: in north america  leads in middle of hand usually attitude, but for EW they are 2nd/4th|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s7|nt|niekbrink: heart switch is an early killer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a good contract, but seems makeable|pg||
nt|friggi: @S|pg||
nt|friggi: and a ruff|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dummy's trumps not exactly a disappointment|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the rest of the hand quite good, as well |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: de Wijs afraid S might double he said, but looking at dummy it was no surprise there wasn't one|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|friggi: low C and ruff again|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: N may want to ruff out that club for the end play |pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: well if west wins, and returns a heart, then cant use the two club pitches|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not so sure he has all the info to get this right|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: although Simon knows @C10 is a singleton, can he figure out a 64 or 7-3 high, and does this matter? is a 7-3 not always C?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: didn't the Poles play that East could overcall 1NT to show 4M6m? Raptor or somethign like that |pg||
pc|d3|nt|friggi: WC play|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|muppe: all declarer's winesse failing so this is not making|pg||
nt|niekbrink: declarer is playing very well nevertheless|pg||
nt|gsper:  Both games are thin but lucky|pg||
pc|c3|nt|niekbrink: club finess before the diamond finess makes it a lot harder for the defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: other wise E has an exit |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|muppe: W needs to play @hQ |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|grebrof: last board is a good example why a bad 6 card minor operates better when opening 1nt|pg||
nt|bebechira: another slam|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lady007:  4@s the likely contract on this hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  will W open in 3rd at these colors?|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: or not |pg||
nt|bebechira: lol...sorrry...another pseudo-slam lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i know i would, but P is not surprising|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 11 tricks in spades for n/s|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|grebrof: say 1nt-2@c :3minor - then your P knows your @ds are not great and that your Hs are somewhere else|pg||
nt|grebrof: @c or @ds|pg||
nt|bobholl: this will be an underved gain :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: are they playing the same boards :S 5@c vs 1NT and now 6@s vs 1@h :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid I am a passer with W most times,  no spades, lousy hand,  (decent rebid however 2 @c) |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: difficult hand with N if you don't have a convention now|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|bebechira: welcome to Martin Johnson :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: gain can get bigger if joris now bids 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
nt|sybarra: good "early" morning to you |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbn: only @c J lead takes it off|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: but the player is capable of finding imaginative leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@s would have shown the hand yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ew have found their misfit, remains to find their fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: woow|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: indeed never double with a void is a pretty good rule|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow i guess this goes 1 down|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am never good with 4/0 fits |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@d GF here, that's not surprising. But nowadays more pairs play this as INV 5-5 with a 2@c gadget|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: or forcing but always 55|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  why not just 2S from N ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me 2nt over 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: for results www.nbbportal.nl/1003|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  partner wont have 4 spades so 2S is safe and cheap|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is forcing and often unbalanced but not 55|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  2S might also put them off a spade lead|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry it is S playing,  skip that remark |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|marlowepi:  i want partner to know i have diamonds when i bid 3D, so he can make the bid that befits his hand without needing to worry if the 3D call was just an invention|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree 2@S is ok if that is your understanding, either way the jump shift without rules is not effective|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i dont mind inventing suits, but not when the call that does so takes up a lot of space|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are in 4@H in open room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: not much to the play    needs to ruff a heart|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ziahyder: can go -1 now|pg||
nt|ziahyder: on a heart return, he Khaled will have to concede a spade later|pg||

nt|grebrof: :S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bebechira: 7 to NL Red|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: could have ruffed a heart  rather than take a diamond finesse  on the assumption that west has A@C  could have then run the majors  and west would have been squeezed if holding K@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think abandoning the heart hook leaves you lots of chances|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c9|pg||

nt|vugraphzcy: bas not happy with last game, could go down 1 more....|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 NT making seems nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: spades and diamonds, 4-4 at least|pg||
nt|niekbrink: ns can make 4 spades, EW have a cheap save in 5 diamonds?|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|mcsd: now he opens with 11 amd pass last hand...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15, 4+@S  if 2-suits, 2nd is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 hcp, 4+@H  if 2 suits, 2nd is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: except could be 5@H 5@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  He would have led a @S with AK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there was a bit of a kerfuffle about it in a World Championship once, or it might have been an Olympiad |pg||
mb|d|nt|muppe: 5@d is not easy to find when vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H Michaels   cute|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have never played canape,  interesting however |pg||
nt|kemperg: but as spec says, with AK of @S he would have led that|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzbf: we have score correction in CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: on b.3|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: 5@s was doubled|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure it take a lot of system notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 1970s i played a few versions   Blue Team Club  and  Roman [when it was allowed]|pg||
nt|kemperg: too fast for me Goran:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  So there was little chance of deceiving declarer|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=longer @H   [5@H 5@S opens 1@H]|pg||
nt|jjsb:  discimpline pass by west , nto sure i even see 6@s ... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pierre Albarran [france] invented Canape|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: 3nt x is for sure a better result than opps maken 4 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: what was thought to be the advantage of canape?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: pass must be forcing |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Italians brought it to world attention with Neopolitan Club [which became Blue Team Club], Roman and a few other systems that were short lived|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N normally has slam ambition, 4@D confirms willingness to cooperate  so PASS definitely forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not 100% certain that 4@D confirmed canape|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: It is, Verhees indicated it could even be 56|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S instead of 4@D might have been more helpful to Verhees|pg||
nt|friggi: sure ..greed is alw...in place:)|pg||
nt|pelu:  and 3NT easy game for EW - even 12 tricks|pg||
nt|jjsb:  well that really how important is this "practice" game for them |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: brink didn't trow @H10 first time, but the J, which confused Drijver....|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2/1 auction   1@H-1N//2@D-2@H|pg||
nt|niekbrink: south will find another bid|pg||
nt|muppe: But west cannot really pass without seeing his parnerts hand|pg||
nt|niekbrink: agree. what I wonder is, if 2 spades shows diamonds, how do they show clubs?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: or was 2 spades just any minor?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: their convention card isn't clear about it|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: I think just a minor, but not sure, couldn't hear everything|pg||
nt|muppe: NS hand fits well. South thinkin whether dbl or 4@S?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: what happens if south waits long enough and then doubles?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: can north still run?|pg||
nt|muppe: i think he cant|pg||
nt|muppe: but im not expert on law issues|pg||
nt|jjsb:  there is 7 tricks coming because of the nice @c situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at this vuls north can afford a somewhat offshape double|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: hope pard understands that |pg||
nt|sybarra: the "that" being 5 @C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i have no idea what DBL over 3@H would show|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand does support recent article in ACBL Bulletin [by Mike Lawrence?] about efficacy of interfering over 1M-2N [game force raise]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note that if 4@D does show canape, then east has 4@H  with 5+@H and 4+@D he would open 2@D, not 1@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: so by deduction, 5 @C  must be a cue |pg||
nt|gsper:  2@D probably XY (game forcing)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kemperg: 2@D gf checkback?|pg||
nt|gsper:  It is a pity that David seems to have left us|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|mcsd: 3@D, 3@H and 3@C =|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the CR E won the second club with the J and didnt return a spade - so it made|pg||
nt|jbgood: N doesnt normally have 3 spades after this sequence, so should be possible|pg||
nt|niekbrink: well done by south|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: took him some time, but well done indeed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems as if Fisher is working on his slow ranking|pg||
pc|c3|nt|niekbrink: Does it matter that they play with screens?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: spade shift not good enough i am afraid, declarer gets 3 spades, 3 hearts and 3 dias|pg||
nt|ahollan1: credit to NS for complicating the EW auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: it is @H6, but maybe only with all 4 hands visible...|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  5  [4@S+1]   Fisher-Schwartz did find the 5@CX save to pickup 8 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@S-2@S, Fisher bid a mere 3@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then took the save all by himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've never been good at those double shot situations where you let opponents exchange full info and THEN save|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes:(|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: 2 spades, he pitched one|pg||
nt|jbgood: oops - sry - didnt see the spade discard (polishing my glasses)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told it's called Two Colours 1NT in Poland, could be only 5m|pg||
pc|h6|nt|friggi: must have|pg||
pc|h2|nt|niekbrink: this will end with 10 tricks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|friggi: usually they are very closed to the money|pg||
nt|friggi: too late..now ..slam it is|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|gsper:  Cards well placed and defence helpful, when you don't need it|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  Padon did NOT win @SA at trick 1   but won @CA and shifted to @H9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs 1N|pg||
nt|niekbrink: anyone wants to bet on another result?|pg||
nt|jjsb:  they are playing 7@c also for info other table |pg||
nt|baldfriede: did you mean "slow" or "low"?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: slow, is now on Roland's list of world's slowest players|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jjsb:  board 3 that is |pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: quite a handy thing to play, but you give up the natural 1NT overcall|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|niekbrink: hmm...|pg||
nt|friggi: pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Drijver was thinking, Brink already holding his pass card, so must know Drijver was about to bid end contract|pg||
nt|friggi: at least decl..knows that he has to have all spots in place..makes del.easyer|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: 31 imps difference now|pg||
nt|niekbrink: phew|pg||
nt|muppe: It does if the pause wouldnt be that long but now it for sure that it was S thinking so it doesnt matter enymore  I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be flat then - no reason to play for 3-0 trumps|pg||
nt|jjsb:  -1 is really good bridge its kinda clear on that board|pg||
nt|friggi: only problem is @C lead|pg||
nt|friggi: Q|pg||
nt|friggi: and hope for the best|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Ophir thinking and asking to know which club to lead, not IF a club should be led, as he said at the table :)|pg||
nt|friggi: Club lead is wise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there is the inference that when you overcall 1M with 2m, you don't have four cards in the other major  |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: for some bizarre reason  other table after playing board 5 is now playing  13|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: as we are playing 6 they can't play it...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|niekbrink: great defense by drijver|pg||
nt|baldfriede: these slow players are dangerous; I hated them when I was playing chess regularly. they think so much that  when tehy are finally in zeitnot they can play at lightning speed and ...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: get every move right|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|niekbrink: only chance to beat this contract was north having 4 clubs without the kin and his partner having 2 spades|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: now @C pitch @D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: but then what|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: oh right -- even more bizarre  the venue doesn't have 3 full sets of boards|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: zeitnot must be time trouble|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a correspondent says that giving up the natural 1NT overcall is like giving up your, well, I'd better not say |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: these days the chess players are faster than most bridge players|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes; the Ger<man term is internationally used in chess. just like zugtwang is|pg||
nt|baldfriede: zugzwang*|pg||
nt|fabsayc: move compulsion, which in bridge is when the director arrives to warn the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: some results from the 3rd table: 4: 4@H -1 S (thus the same)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|baldfriede: I compare move compulsion to being endplayed. any move you make is wrong; that's what the term "zugzwang" mEans|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: that would not have been the line of play in 6@H|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: 2 imps for NL this was|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  wow, wild hand here|pg||
nt|ady: Israel gained 3 imps on hand 4 where 2@D was down 4     also 1NT opened by east   and west scrambled to 2 hearts  3 down|pg||
nt|lady007:  what to bid with van Lankvelds hand?|pg||
nt|ady: what a freak|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tipu: 17 is the difference|pg||
nt|tipu: with still 10 boards to come|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 12 tricks in spades    but not the greatest  contract   and could mis guess  diamonds  playing south for KX|pg||
nt|ady: did not take lon to get there|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: van Lankveld putting up a smile when Fisher looks at him as if he's crazy|pg||
nt|bebechira: when they score up..thats another matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  he decided that a jump to 5@s wont help as his partner has no clue when to raise anyway|pg||
nt|bobholl: joris and berend should put this play out of their heads :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not for either team, but want the last board to matter|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|tipu: We have what we wanna see|pg||
nt|bebechira: another one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: decent chance to get diamond right  on the weak 2 opening|pg||
nt|lady007:  and a 5@s bid might have seen his partner raise to 6 on this hand as well|pg||
nt|bebechira: they just put out of their heads the 5c|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobholl: you have to and we know that this one is fair :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: pass of 1h was very strange|pg||
nt|bebechira: we have a problem|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: so i need to restart|pg||
nt|bobholl: not much happening anyway :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|tipu: a nice situation|pg||
nt|bobholl: south 5@C ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wrong idea, south needs to declare|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: yes, not West :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: non spade lead seems right|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  cold double dummy even without spade lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  and you would play it in the way that works|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: he can set up 4th @c without letting North in|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbn: misdefense was the last hope he let it to the opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: & they did nt dissappoint him|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbn: only have to ruff 2 @C in Dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: if S had @hAx     Slam not ON on trump ace  & back a trump|pg||
nt|bobholl: can still go down @C A @D switch|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes indeed|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the locals here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how do you make on diamond lead|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|vugraphzyf: is a 5th @s, AK of @h and a possibly very valuable @dJ enough to make another bid now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would surely after 5@C |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S by south was ok, but this should go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: on club lead you could duck|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  up with ace and nine of clubs|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bebechira: North is considering slam?|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  luckily S has stiff D :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: decision time now. 3NT= or 3NT -4|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  why did E win?|pg||
nt|sybarra: folks sorry I have to leave for a meeting.    gl to all,  cu again soon |pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: strong @c - 1@h something pos I guess|pg||
nt|grebrof: 7-9hp the balcony says|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  T of diamonds from KT would be a great play here|pg||
mb|6H|nt|grebrof: thank you|pg||
nt|grebrof: 10 tricks again|pg||
nt|bebechira: hard to make this one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: furthermore, south has indicated a singleton or void in clubs, so north 6 not that unreasonable|pg||
nt|bobholl: they do it to themselves but he should lead a @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: as i said i would have (after 5@C from P)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this just cant be right|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  3  1N did go down in the other room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The 690 and 590 were flat - board 3, though, was 12 to Israel  |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbf: that might be director's call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=5@H & 5@C/@D|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes, good thinking|pg||
nt|friggi: like the man said, if your are going to make a mess make it early|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|mcsd: 24 imps the differencewth only 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: other room board 5 3nt C N but under protest....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as a matter of interest, if you are in seven with AKxx opposite 1098sixth - if no trump lead, would you play for trumps 3-0? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D always weak in 1 major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other israeli pairs include strong hands in their "multi"|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: N just banged 4@h in the other room - 3@d minisplinter good here|pg||
nt|friggi: question remains...small or big slam|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|mcsd: bergen raise?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@c some Bergen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: yes, 3-4c supp 5-8hcp|pg||
nt|jbgood: if it can be 3 - then its not bergen - and S will not bid game|pg||
nt|mcsd: he is thinking|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: 4-10 hcp|pg||
nt|niekbrink: remarkable pass by south|pg||
nt|jjsb:  well i would surely hate to be in that situation im just not sure the non trump lead is enough to considere a finesse |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 5: 3@C W-3 6:2@D N -2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 10-17 hcp, 5+suit|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@H|pg||
nt|friggi: problems|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT - 4@C|pg||
nt|friggi: except 2NT 24+ |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS play a true Multi 2@D opener  to cover weak typical 2@H/@S opener and some strong hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@s=hearts|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|niekbrink: I thought that in bridge nowadays any 12 count is an opening bid, especially if you have 2 aces|pg||
nt|muppe: 4-3-3-3 12 count, maybe it's their style not to open then|pg||
nt|jjsb:  redouble here probably with a 5 card suite asking partner to bid 2@c |pg||
nt|fabsayc: must be north thinking, east had automatic pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 7: 3@D +3 W|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: if it is not your style to open this hand, is worth an invite now, or will he just bid game?|pg||
nt|muppe: Most certainly would open|pg||
nt|jjsb:  there is some different defense on a penalty double of 1 nt the important things is that to discuss it with partner !! |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: escape mechanism indeed....|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@S clearly constructive in their methods, as pointed out by a kib|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 2@S can be up to 14 in 3rd position|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|jbgood: not true|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: well i guess you were right :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: not true: I meant 4@h after a tempo break|pg||
nt|muppe: What is 2@d?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of my team-mates led a singleton trump against a grand slam after a RKCB auction with showed all the honours - at least, one hand had shown the queen - the trouble was, he ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: didn't have it |pg||
nt|friggi: transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: bergen is always 4 - that i know - i live there|pg||
nt|mcsd: cold call directir?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: i agre, they should call him|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: agree|pg||
nt|mcsd: sry for typos|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand "flops" well |pg||
nt|friggi: with points|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10 tricks now|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|niekbrink: I guess south intended it as GF relay, but north thought that this was not the case with passed  hand |pg||
nt|friggi: max|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|muppe: maybe he forgot he was passed hand? your guess would be mine too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C = 5422|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|sybarra: cant do anything wrong,  my kind of hand |pg||
nt|friggi: so now 7 is possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: looks like 12 tricks in all slams - assuming you get the hearts right  |pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4S!|nt|niekbrink: Or is it to wild as a commentator to guess a misunderstanding for world champions?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb:  there is somle loosing play available here |pg||
nt|friggi: slam try|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|ahollan1: but without a peek, Verhees has to work through permutations of  both red Kings offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb:  but the probkem si u migth have some communication problem to play for K10x in @d in South |pg||
mb|5D!|nt|friggi: all clear go ahead|pg||
nt|friggi: like the say in Italy fantastico|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: chatting with someone who knows the EW system better than me - 2@D is natural|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then Symmetric Relays|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there was an amusing hand yesterday where the relays went wrong (not this pair) - ended in 6@s-4 with 7@h bid and made at the other table - just the 21 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@s was Axx opposite Kx - not ideal for a slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not quite sure about this - EW play 14/30 RKCB, so it looks like 4@S is not RKCB|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: de Wijs is thinking and thinking, took out a pass, hovering it about the bidding, took it back and bid 6@D|pg||

pc|h7|nt|ady: north may not balamce|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to land in 3 nt here also |pg||

mb|p|nt|mcsd: the CR score is correct on this one?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|jbgood: so congrats to NS1 - and bye all|pg||
nt|jjsb:  well the J would have work also for some kind of Kxx and 10 singleton on East hand ?|pg||

nt|friggi: dbl os 4M|pg||
nt|friggi: dangous stuff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D doesn't promise any points -- just prefers @S over @C  if west has both black suits|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: hence the @S lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of those things you have to do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you might as well do the same - although, if you need swings, perhaps you should do the opposite :) |pg||
mb|d|nt|jjsb:  rigth |pg||
nt|jjsb:  n is probably kinda astonished :) |pg||
nt|jjsb:  N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: otherwise, they will make AAK in the majors and five club tricks for -120 and you can make 140 in 2M|pg||
nt|jjsb:  its not a clear situation he knows there is a fit in major but in other he has some "defensive" value |pg||
nt|mdgraham: (or -500 in 2M, of course)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most pairs would not be sure of their agreements here, you suspect - is double 100% penalty? |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: all in favor of a pass or anyone wants to score big with N and run the risk of EW finding a better play?|pg||
nt|jjsb:  its an awkaward decision really |pg||
nt|jjsb:  i do pass personally |pg||
nt|mdgraham: North can be pretty sure South has a club void - as a spec says, if South is 5/5M 4M may be on|pg||
nt|jjsb:  as its commented on the audio and some specs some are suprised he didnt act rigth away |pg||
nt|jjsb:  i agree he wouldnt have been in that situation |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: at the 3rd table 2@C went 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: only it was played by North :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=5-11   i don't know if that means  forcing or semi-forcing or non-force :(|pg||
nt|gsper:  According to Peter, 1@S showed @C length too|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: Is 2@s weak two or 5@s and a minor?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Nice for E, who would have had troube finding a bid otherwise|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mcsd: ah da I cestitke Vrnjackoj Banji :) Dobro su se drzali do pred kraj.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: One question is, will the slam be bid next door?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: looking at south hand  i assume forcing|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: south making good use of his strong @H spots|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if @H6 suggests @D shift|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 2 spades is natural weak 2|pg||
nt|friggi: yes J |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcsd: Bilo je i kvalitetnijih timova, po rejtingu, koji su ispali iz trke ranije.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally  2nd trick is a situation for Smith Echo, but that doesn't really apply with this dummy|pg||
nt|friggi: and small @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: 2nt asking|pg||
nt|niekbrink: I guess 3 clubs is eiter a minimum and a bad suit or shortage|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 3@C shortage|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2NT is unequivocally clubs, you can play pass then double by North as penalties |pg||
nt|sybarra: easiest lead for declarer |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@h is a bit, er, thin|pg||
pc|hT|nt|muppe: this is not making|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually, you can do anything you like with the variousn combinations of pass and double |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the important thing is to be on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|friggi: Q@C or small @H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcsd: We have no idea what happend with 2@h dbld|pg||
nt|ahollan1: verhees hoping for @CJ from vP --- sorry partner|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club 10 was suit preference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially when Verhees ducks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mcsd: Kibbitz suggests that if 2@h dbls the rulings retun 2@H dbld to -1 and 3nt makes on this one then Vrnjacka Banja winns|pg||
nt|friggi: looking at dummy htis bluff dont work|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|muppe: I think N was hoping more with those spades|pg||

pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: west must duck, but club still squeezes him|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: Bergen Raise??|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 4@C -- transfer to your suit  [ignoring the 2N bid]|pg||
nt|jjsb:  playing probably 3nt here 5@d will also work i think but i just dont like to be there |pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: South has pretty good hand for 15-17NT, the value of great 6@c suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know if vP has proven canape or if he can still have weak nt with 4@S|pg||
mb|4D|nt|fabsayc: 4@S, no choice even if west has only 4 will play well|pg||
nt|baldfriede: he may think about 3nt|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks Roel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i forgot about 4441 :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or not|pg||
nt|muppe: NS can make 5@c, 3nt is not making if they find @s lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it's a legal call :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it would have worked better if Verhees was on same page|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with East as declarer  defense can't attack @C|pg||
nt|niekbrink: dbl for a spade lead?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|niekbrink: that will do the job for WE|pg||
nt|niekbrink: EW|pg||
nt|niekbrink: any other lead will be counting over tricks|pg||
nt|muppe: Top spade or small?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: board 5 has been corrected to 3nt -1 N|pg||
nt|davidb: why not H?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: on a heart lead south can make 13 tricks I think|pg||
nt|gsper:  Where will the 10th trick come from?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@d is a heart raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anybody for pass with south hand and lead a trump|pg||

nt|mdgraham: you could sell me that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: collects about 300 on actual hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|muppe: ok @h|pg||
nt|jjsb:  ok so a no brainer at the play apparently |pg||
pc|s6|nt|muppe: He might just play for 9 tricks, now he has a finesse in @h.|pg||
nt|muppe: oh sry he has 9 top tricks now|pg||
nt|niekbrink: not if drijver plays low|pg||
nt|niekbrink: then he has 10 top tricks, but no possibility to make 13|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently 4@C was cue bid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yep|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|niekbrink: if drijver plays the J of hearts, he can win the ace, finesse heart to dummy. play 10 of diamonds for a diamond finess. repeat eh finesse in diamonds and cross to the king of clubs ...|pg||
nt|niekbrink: to cash the 13 diamond and his 3th heart|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so, 3heart tricks, 6 club tricks and 4 diamond tricks - 13|pg||
nt|jjsb:  some security play avalaible in @d|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|niekbrink: now he lacks communication for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|muppe: @h8 was good, now he cant risk @d finesse or he could go down|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: just in case East has A109x|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jjsb:  ok so the @h finesse will be safe now |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|niekbrink: of course, south was not gonna take all these risks and probably just cashing his tricks|pg||
nt|muppe: he can try @dQ if E covers|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|niekbrink: was the hesitation long enough?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: no|pg||
nt|niekbrink: it was not|pg||
pc|hA|nt|muppe: wd by E not to cover|pg||
pc|hT|nt|muppe: still nice result for Israel|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: so that's why 2@h is natural, if 2@c would be 5-5 2@h wasn't natural|pg||

mb|p|nt|tipu: otherwise a routine pass   within a second|pg||

nt|fabsayc: some tool to check on four card support needed|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i would just bid 2S|pg||

nt|sybarra: maybe average a couple of years older |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought muller is a couple of decades older|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe yes on that |pg||
nt|sybarra: all of 40?|pg||
nt|davidb: the 2 israeli young  pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pics of some of the players available by clicking on the name at http://www.bridge.nl/topbridge-algemeen/1635-nedisr2012|pg||
nt|davidb: a tea hand..|pg||
nt|sybarra: I met Dr. Schwartz and the young team in Philly a couple of years ago at WBF event|pg||

nt|davidb: Ron's  father 2010|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: name is Gabriel |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@C = cue  either 4-fit or good 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H would show 4-fit but bad hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: grand with an overtrick, in fact|pg||
nt|baldfriede: rather wobbly stopper in @d, but the way cards sit it works|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some entry problems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT=FG relay|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|niekbrink: but nevertheless :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass to show good @Ds only when 1@D promised a 5crd?|pg||
nt|gsper:  E has a lot of guessing to do, but the bidding may help|pg||
nt|gsper:  You may be right there, Germ|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb:  im afraid i will not be able to help u on the bidding ... :) |pg||
nt|jjsb:  but im pretty sure they will know everything at the end :) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: You'd bet they will get there, but it might take some time|pg||
nt|jjsb:  im ok til 1nt :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: they play precision with some adjustments, also too impossible for me to describe unfortunately|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ahollan1: 1st question for NS --  who's on lead???|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: @C quess is the clue|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: but played in west, not so easy for N to lead a club|pg||
nt|jjsb:  i have been told that 3@s is showing that shape specifically |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Muller is indeed asking for shape etc|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@D = @D  -  2@S = 5/5   3@C = High Short (@H)  - 3@H = 5521@H|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|muppe: but too risky to find those saves |pg||
nt|ahollan1: just confirmed  that link gets picture of all 12 participants of this team match|pg||
nt|gsper:  Phew!|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|muppe: in imps, they might cost too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: after @S lead -- declarer would try to guess which minor suit to play for @S discard|pg||
nt|jjsb:  i think its possible here East doesnt lnow if west got 7 or 6 of @h |pg||
nt|jjsb:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 4nt was keycards, 5@H showed 2 as @DA is useless opposite a void, which was shown already|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jjsb:  the play is not all academic as its point out i nthe audio |pg||
nt|mdgraham: when pard jumps to a grand - put down dummy|pg||
nt|jjsb:  u have 12 sure |pg||
nt|mdgraham: clubs 4-1 might break, as if you cash AK the 89 go from dummy, and the 7 will become good - but here all is well|pg||
nt|jjsb:  important sentence to remember in bridge when ur in a very good contract try to think of some bad situation when ur in a very poor contract try to imagine some lucky and nice distribution |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: and preferably with a pokerface|pg||
nt|jjsb:  can someone tell him he cant go down :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: they sure get to use a lot of cards from their bidding boxes|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|gsper:  S knew little about the E hand. Trying fr a @C ruff made sense|pg||
nt|gsper:  *for|pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps S would not duck @CQ when he had a doublton, so leader would do it right|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||

nt|friggi: not the best %play|pg||
pc|c8|nt|muppe: with @h 3-3, 11 tricks|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  we agreed on preemptive raises without discussing criteria. first board he opened 1H and i had a horrible ten loser hand with 4 hearts and an ace and bid 3H. he passed and made ten. i still get postcards about it from time to time:):)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yes i could have passed out the hand -- at least i didn't give them a 2nd chance to get to game|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=10-15 HCP  5+@H and 4+@D|pg||
nt|jjsb:  again not a surprise we do know what those teams are capable of , still |pg||
nt|jjsb:  interesting board here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: vP can't bid 3@C here -- that would show @H fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try 3@S   asking for 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nope  5@C   going for the 100 honors :)|pg||
nt|jjsb:  in some good normal day NS will make a slam here just that all os so horrible for them... |pg||
nt|gsper:  I had connection trouble. Are we agreed that @DA would have beaten it?|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: 7411 a much better shape than 7222|pg||
nt|jjsb:  i wouldnt be surprised they do play slam |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force relay|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@S from Verhees??|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: yep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe vP would like to go back and try 3@S now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is why you have practice matches -- to talk about situations that haven't come up before|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 11 tricks in NT without diamond lead....|pg||
mb|r|nt|niekbrink: the 4 diamond bid is typical in the style of brink and Drijver. |pg||
nt|friggi: NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcy: Fisher is already taking out 7@H bid....|pg||
mb|2H|nt|niekbrink: 5 diamonds is a good sacrifice again againgst 4 spades|pg||
nt|jjsb:  Mike what about east decision? are u doign same?|pg||
nt|friggi: pass|pg||
nt|kemperg: have to leave now, grandchildren are arriving.|pg||
mb|d|nt|muppe: yes EW has put a pressure on NS, but NS find their good 4@s|pg||
nt|muppe: 4@s looks makeable|pg||
nt|niekbrink: losing a spade and a club|pg||
nt|niekbrink: maybe a heart ruff|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so 10 or 11 tricks I guess|pg||
nt|niekbrink: heart ruff not so easy to find when south is declaring|pg||
nt|muppe: but it's not over yet, E still thinking|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 5d is only 500 i think|pg||
nt|davidb: good  pass F -partner please  decide|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N confirms  12-14 bal, not 4333|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may end in 2@sx|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees said he was sleeping, thought it was 4@S instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|muppe: @sJx doesnt look nice for save, he cannot know for sure if 4@s is making or not|pg||
nt|friggi: this will make due to distribution|pg||
nt|gsper:  No, say kibs. Pity I missed the discussion.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he wasn't making 6@C either|pg||
nt|niekbrink: great lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: brink started "without" thinking a @H, had ofcourse some time to think before a contract was certain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure how DBL affects the responses to this stayman-like 3@C relay|pg||
nt|friggi: bad dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the trouble is, if you raise to 5@S, you are telling NS they can make a slam.... |pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they don't have much room left to find the best one, if indeed there is one|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: might bid normally "thru" doubles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D shows 4/5@D and NOT 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|davidb: S  is  bored  .. uselles  X  -may his  first  doubtful  bid ...dror padon  playing great|pg||
nt|davidb: may be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both of the young pairs playing very well|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidb: very  good  judgment  by all! high  level bridge|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3@C=any 12-14 3@H=asking for singelton , as a kind kib told me|pg||
nt|friggi: bld|pg||
nt|gsper:  So maybe it was a true winkle|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H asks  how many @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: Now they will score @h ruff but still 10 tricks for declarer it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: par score reached|pg||
nt|jjsb:  again this hand shows the level of play really... |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: better than this is hard to find, (world) transnational champions against the world champions|pg||
nt|friggi: lack fo breavearge|pg||
pc|sK|nt|friggi: A|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: rdbl denies a 5crd low, and without jacoby no 5crd high, so N must also have 4 spades...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: for the record, 7NT down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club jack, cant think of any reason to lead anything else|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is on system notes page 247  ... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=4@D|pg||
pc|s2|nt|friggi: and return|pg||
nt|friggi: good god|pg||
nt|friggi: was clear singel or doblton|pg||
nt|friggi: very poor def |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|muppe: E will be endplayed|pg||
nt|niekbrink: will east endplay himself by ruffing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: (just kidding no clue really but clearly they know what they are doing) |pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu:  tell me how can S make after @DA discard? - tx|pg||
nt|gsper:  A winkle is an advanced squeeze, named by Reese, which I have never accomplished.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|niekbrink: another endplay of B. Drijver!|pg||
nt|davidb: nuce play by E not ruffing -gives some chance!|pg||
nt|davidb: nice|pg||
nt|niekbrink: this time he is endplayed himself |pg||
pc|c2|nt|davidb: the  dutch pairs  are working very seriously  -I admire  -they deserve  their title|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|muppe: yes had east not ruffed, it would have been more interesting|pg||
nt|niekbrink: how?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: declarer can ruff a heart in hand, finess a club and then find out he needs clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|gsper:  A technically competent kib confirms that it was one|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: wd guys |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Meckstroth-Rodwell have a good treatment after bids like 5@S - they invert pass and double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought 4@D forced 4@H to signoff -- but obviously it was something else|pg||
nt|davidb: on board  9 brink  played great to make 4H |pg||
nt|sybarra: worried maybe @D's 4/0 |pg||
nt|friggi: toolate|pg||
nt|mdgraham: leading trumps is a good idea against doubled partscores |pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: brutal to think after partner opens that best spot is 3N|pg||
nt|niekbrink: sorry, finess a spade|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: welcome back marshall|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|muppe: yes, he will be endplayed sooner or later it seems|pg||
nt|friggi: wating for the train who never comes|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the last chapter of The expert game|pg||
nt|gsper:  Are Andy and Peter this silent, or is my connection bad again?|pg||
nt|pelu:  kibs: play the last @h - that will kill the defense - ok - :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: they should make that a law: "doubled partscore, always lead trump" :) :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|gsper:  Looks like -1, but crossruffs are nasty to analyse|pg||
pc|c6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some players are reluctant to lead singleton honours against doubled partscores - understandable, but it helps partner  |pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: pass requests double (penalty pass or strong slam try) and double says "I'm not sure what we should be doing"|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|friggi: abstaken |pg||
nt|gsper:  Peter thinks so too|pg||
nt|davidb: good ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: key card probably @S9|pg||
nt|davidb: y|pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: just in case not @HJT doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: forcing|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: the thing about the pass (requests double) is that responder doesn't have to double if he holds a very slam-suitable hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: now 3NT|pg||

nt|ahollan1: converting the DBL is much easier at other forms of scoring|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder when we will have matches where a computer has eliminated this kind of board|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: did south bid 1@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if so needs an alert|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: we have some connection problems, brd 12 7 made, as with @Hs 2-2 14 tricks|pg||
nt|gsper:  Board 13, I mean|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: don't worry, guys, if you'd bid a slam we'd have led clubs..... |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees said he would have passed was it a other way of scoring :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  It is interesting that EW at the other table chose 3NT with all those major cards|pg||
nt|gsper:  There was a 2NT overcall there too, suggesting bad breaks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. Thanks to our operator and to spec Zmud99, who was very helpful with some of the details of the EW relays|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: we have one more session after this one, starting probably 10 minutes after this board ends....|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|muppe: Some might overcall 1@s with that S hand, but maybe its rather too weak for that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: brink is now gonna show 12+ with 5+ diamonds and possible 4-crd major|pg||
nt|jjsb:  3 nt is off on a @h leaad |pg||
nt|jjsb:  double asking for unusua lead|pg||
nt|jjsb:  probably a suit and its like "find it" |pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like a specific lead....|pg||
nt|jjsb:  mmhhh as audio comment (and operator) it specifically ask the @h lead |pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubt-showing redouble? |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: also explained by de Wijs as a @H lead....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bermuda Bowl final, 1981, board 72|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Meckstroth-Rodwell in 3NTxx - +750 (spade lead), could have been -2200 (club lead)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: we are in the twilight zone now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure when the last set starts - in a short while I guess|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|muppe: what was 1@d and 1@h?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good lead, that|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: they will be in time to have the club trick as well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: arrgh|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anything to avoid a natural bid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|niekbrink: 1h is 12-14 balanced or unbalanced with clubs and diamonds|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought Verhees might open strong 1@C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if he still opens 1N if partner is NOT a passed hand|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 1 diamonds was eiter weak, or all kind of other hands without 4crd major, or the hand west currently has|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of 2@S because it promises 6+suit??|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: not sure....|pg||
nt|gsper:  Not everybody would have the meaning of D clear here|pg||
nt|pelu:  is this a 1@S openinhg for all og u? - not for me|pg||
pc|h4|nt|muppe: ok, so they are playing Dutch doubleton?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: yes|pg||
nt|jjsb:  as its point out by specs (thank) if u didnt discuss precisely about redouble or pass u better choose 4@c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: third seat, yes|pg||
nt|gsper:  A kib who should know: EW play all DBLS as shortness|pg||
nt|pelu:  this was 1. seat|pg||
pc|c5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: ?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: quite :)|pg||
nt|jjsb:  and again another great judgment |pg||
nt|fabsayc: now schwartz is wondering what is going on|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|niekbrink: on an non spade lead, this has not been made yet|pg||
nt|niekbrink: now declarer has 3 hearts, 3 clubs, 2 diamonds and 1 spade|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|davidb: again great judgment  by all  bravo!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu:  1@S: CC: 10+|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: @SJ  presumably showing @S10  makes this easier for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well is all a matter of balancing the opener overbids with the responder underbids, seems rarely to happen|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SJx very unlikely lead|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|friggi: good def|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1:  12  Fisher-Schwartz also get to 6@D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: the youngsters are having a very good day|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
mc|8|nt|chick:  2 more boards after this I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: back in 7-10 minutes|pg||
