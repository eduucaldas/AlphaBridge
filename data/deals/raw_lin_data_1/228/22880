nt|lady007:  welcome to the final of the white house juniors|pg||
nt|lady007:  we saw 2 very close matches yesterday, lets hope it will be just as exciting today!|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we are go|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: lose by 19, because they should lead by 20 :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lool|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lady007:  on the first board EW can make 4@s, even with the bad breaks, but they shouldnt get any higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbn: they play Capp (transfers)  over 1M  -  X  - |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: so 2@s is a weak  raise |pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @S guess i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan open teams national trials segment 2/4 from lahore.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzbn: I missed the bidding but the contract is 2NT by South|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bebechira: they will bid 4s and will come down to find the trumps quuen|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lady007:  Fisher leads his nice heart sequence instead of his singleton, because he has good spades and is not looking for a ruff|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan Open teams National Trials from Lahore|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzbn: @cQ can be only vital card of the whole deal|pg||
nt|lady007:  now lets see how van den Bos should play. he is probably worried about spades 4-1, but the bidding makes it more likely its with north than with south|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzyf: if you misguess can eliminate @c and @d and let them open the @h|pg||
nt|bebechira: queen even|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but won't work here|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3d?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: reverse flannery 2@S response would work on this hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lady007:  he pitches a diamond, because if diamonds are 32, he can always discard a club on the diamonds later|pg||
nt|lady007:  north might have made it more difficult for declarer here to duck his ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi all |pg||
nt|bebechira: hi Shirley, Martin|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|bobholl: why not dennis :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: because North has both @h|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzbn: Farrukh planning discards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: fist on the mouth|pg||
nt|bebechira: ambitious contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  hi all :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  welcome back for the exciting conclusion of this intense match|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is the 3rd and final session of this final|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  hi dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: hi marshall|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Mashall |pg||
nt|marlowepi:  hi shirley:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: in case both teams finish tied Netherlands Red wins the tournament as they were ranked higher in the Swiss|pg||
nt|bebechira: it will not happen twice Dennis|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  what if only one team finishes tied?:)|pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: we had it 3 or 4 years ago, tie-break in both semi-final and final|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  do we know why the organizers use that tie-break method instead of extra boards?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only if east ducks club queen can i see any hope for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: there was a reason, but can't remember it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: n already place after the @D :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: nice|pg||
nt|bobholl: placed|pg||
nt|xenya:  an ambitious 3N -- 1@S showed both majors?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: no doubt to be sure the tournament finishes at a specific time|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably has to do with time schedules for flights home |pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobholl: J@H his only possibilty|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done by joris (or just lucky ?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this final consists of 3 sessions of 14 boards|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lady007:  declarer cant ruff his club anymore, but he can discard it on the diamonds. so 10 tricks it is|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bobholl: one @S and then @C would have been better|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lady007:  he might play all his trumps first, trying for a possible squeeze|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|saverio: ciao all|pg||
nt|baldfriede: hello all. let's hope we will see a good match|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbf: hearts and spades, at least 4-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog:  http://www.bridge.nl/topbridge-algemeen/1635-nedisr2012 has convention cards: click on kaart|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: 4@s can be set by a small @c lead here   but very unlikely :)|pg||
nt|saverio: but E may add something  (not unreasonably)|pg||
nt|saverio: even if bal and no @c control may make him decide for pass|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|saverio: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: van Prooijen is still thinking.....|pg||
nt|saverio: not an easy pass   |pg||
nt|baldfriede: now this is a really weak two|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=5-7|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm al :) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: bah  humbug|pg||
nt|sybarra: very early for you  |pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: http://www.bridge.nl/topbridge-algemeen/1635-nedisr2012   has links to 5 of 6 convention cards and links to player bio|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: on repeated spade leads you can make 3 nt - but that is too much to ask|pg||
nt|mcsd: 3@D is maximum w should bidd now|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 down in 2 spades versus 3 @d making|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice agreement on the S bid:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jbgood: looks as if we are in for a SLOW set - again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other vugraph room visible without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: yes :(|pg||
nt|jbgood: specs will notice that thinking much and then passing doesnt help much.)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards from 2011 Bermuda Bowl are online   NS:http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Israel/Herbst_Herbst.pdf|pg||

nt|ahollan1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Israel/Herbst_Herbst.pdf|pg||
nt|saverio: now @c A and @c can set it   no more needed to underlead the A   and slowly easier to find|pg||
nt|psyck: not easy but W only showed a disctributional hand with no further interest, didnt think E would go forward when 5 level could be risky with no @c control|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees a little disappointed with his very first bid of this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both rooms offering Voice Commentary|pg||
pc|sA|nt|saverio: thats true    but his DBL was promising 12+  he has 18  and good controls     always easier looking at all hands|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzcy: 3@C probably showing some strength|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: true, & no has @c discards too...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: this is a lead declarer will not like|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|psyck: *now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: South won't like that @H are blocked now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|bebechira: any imp important |pg||
nt|fabsayc: spectators see more than 2 down actually|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: great to see that the sponsors of this tournament (Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford) are watching live at the table|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably they are right...|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|grebrof: hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: Sorry got disconnected ....4@s is being played |pg||
nt|lady007:  2@d transfer, showing hearts|pg||
nt|lady007:  EW can even make 6@h here on the very lucky layout of the cards, but most likely they will get to 4@h|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d!|mb|p|nt|lady007:  Fisher bid 4@s because of his 64 but he wont buy a very usefull dummy. this can get expensive|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan open teams national trials FINAL segment 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: I DONT bid on west garbage|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  the best reason for bidding on the W garbage is that doing so might assist you in your choice of lead against the final contract. feedback from E could be crucial|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well either 4@H or 5@D is better, but west has to find a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: that lead not bad for declarer |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bobholl: juniors bid 4@H seniors like me 3@H :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbn: routine +1|pg||
nt|lady007:  this will be at least 800|pg||
nt|bobholl: but i have always been a chicken |pg||
nt|bebechira: coffee hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyf: they lead 4th best against 3NT|pg||

pc|c4|nt|lady007:  hi david|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: after these one is gonna be 5 min.break tks.all|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi:  i find it a bit odd to lead a spade. why not attack the suit that can provide the most tricks when it is right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: so van den Bos knows that they cannot cash 4 @ss now|pg||
nt|sybarra: specs suggesting 6 @D by S pretty good  |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: these is the last board in these round the next one will start at 5pm CET (in 1h30min) thanks all :)|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|ady: e/w can make 12 tricks in hearts as they lay    but  this will be a poor result for Israel|pg||
nt|lady007:  if EW can avoid playing diamonds, declarer might face a nast guess to avoid 1100|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: how high  3rd seat  favorable  Louk?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: another part score battle (if battle is the right word considering the previous one)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psyck: a typical 1st seat fav vul bid...|pg||
nt|sybarra: was typing could well try 4 @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: there's your answer :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and he did |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if i had any money  i would have bet on 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|niekbrink: Frank Bakkeren plays another session with Ron Schwartz|pg||
nt|niekbrink: Lotan fischer will arrive shortly|pg||
nt|muppe: Here NS has slightly misfit, will see how high they will bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcy: just like yesterday there is a 3rd table, not broadcasted by BBO but we will give you the results, 1board, 2@H N C|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jbgood: E doesnt think much of his 5 bagger:)|pg||
nt|saverio: N hasnt a tool to show 2 suiter it seems |pg||
nt|sybarra: the guys from Neth. not exactly shiy |pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly not shy :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: Lotan Fisher hasn't arrived yet. I don't know why. Till then Frank Bakkeren will play. This pair also played the first session|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: there is a 3rd table, not broadcasted by BBO but we will give you the results as well. 1st board 1nt +1 by north|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: like the previous session I will also give interesting results from the 3rd table, not visible on BBO. board 1 6@S x -1|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: or he may have required a better hand for it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: I withdraw the word "battle" totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW signals  upside-down count & attitude [udca]   odd/even discards|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  carding  for both pairs   upside-down count & attitude [udca]  and odd/even discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator just cleaning up for the historical record|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: at the third table I think it is Netherlands EW as well, so this table doesn't compare to the third table|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|vugraphzcy: if I can remember :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|muppe: This seems to be too high for NS|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roghog:  http://www.bridge.nl/groepen/Wedstrijdzaken/1112/ccBirman&Padon.pdf for NS card|pg||
nt|jjsb:  hello to u all ! |pg||
nt|jjsb:  i will secund a bit our "audio commentator" (thanks to cornelia and peter) here |pg||
nt|jjsb:  this practice is just awesome from the start , in term of quality of play |pg||
nt|jjsb:  and just a privilege to be able to watch it |pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzcy: ok, it is Lotan Fisher who is playing, I will correct this|pg||
nt|niekbrink: complicated  hand. many options for both declarer and defenders|pg||
nt|niekbrink: But defenders are favorites to beat this contract|pg||
nt|muppe: not easy return for E, @h would be best this time|pg||
nt|niekbrink: club is not an option I guess. Diamonds doesn't seem pretty either and trump could be expensive if the clubs run|pg||
nt|muppe: But ofcorse he doesnt know that his parntner has @hA|pg||
nt|jjsb:  we can of course all see that this one is going down and it will at the end but South is just trying to picture the different possibilities |pg||
pc|h7|nt|niekbrink: well done by Drijver|pg||
pc|h9|nt|muppe: nice|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: good topic for partnership discussion -- when dummy shows Qxx(x) after partner leads from AK -- is your signal count [normal or udca] or suit pref|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South is  R  Schwartz|pg||
nt|jjsb:  the problem for the defense is just now |pg||
nt|jjsb:  and the 10 of @c is somehow precising things|pg||
pc|sK|nt|saverio: i'd think AK and AK enough to show 2 suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk4: unless Bakkeren is a substitute|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is he?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|jjsb:  with what i saw so far in this match im just pretty confident that South will come to the rigth conclusioon|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or still attitude|pg||
pc|s2|nt|niekbrink: My information is that Frank Bakkeren indeed is a substitute|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ron Schwartz did not arrive yet. Now you know why, Marshall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the historical record is a ".lin" file that BBO generates |pg||
nt|ahollan1: they have an archive of the .lin files from all vugraph mathes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: matches|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are also some 3rd party sites that have collected the records|pg||
nt|chick:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph_archives/vugraph_archives.php|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mcsd: Now if he plays for ruffing @H he will promote T@C for @S|pg||
nt|mcsd: for South|pg||
nt|chick:  These matches usually get added to the archives within a day or two|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the .lin files can be loaded examined without logging into BBO|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jjsb:  oh , what a suprise , we have to say 'nicely done" again :) |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|jbgood: and even if he doesnt - he may be forced|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: south will need to keep all @D |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jbgood: but now he is ok|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Ron arrived a few minutes ago I am told|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so he will probably replace Bakkeren shortly|pg||
nt|niekbrink: I trust Roel to tell us when he does|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He will change the name when he does|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: if you use the original windows version of bbo - you have your own copy of the .lin|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: Birman has seen all of the @C|pg||

nt|grebrof: I guess they found the @dshift|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: Lead increasing|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  NL lost an opportunity there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade lead required Qxxxx in east as well as a red card, so i tend to agree, Marshall|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  but then, so did Israel:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 7@S on  with 3 finesses |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|marlowepi:  yes and low spade might well even  block suit when E does have Qxxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  a possible slam hand for NS coming up here|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 15 flat.. 4s bid and made at both tables|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  oh sorry, i thought W had led from KJ8x|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|qasim2003: nice bid given that they are trying to recover alot of imps this segment|pg||
nt|lady007:  they can make both 6@h and 6@s if they guess the spades (and possible the clubs, on a unlikely club lead if played by north)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to small slam   and make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry @C wrong so 6|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  now i see it is the 5|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|qasim2003: i'd bid 4@h with the S hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: a true yarborough in N hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: (not even a 10 makes it a yarb)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  S would LIKE to bid 3D as a lead-director over 2H, byut that could work out poorly|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Fisher knows that he can save for a probable 500, but decides not to|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|qasim2003: but 3@h makes so a nice result for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess he 'll show a good "pudding"raise now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@c should show 4@s now|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  hmmmm|pg||
mb|2N|nt|grebrof: this reminds me of a friend -  has no dbl in my mind|pg||
nt|lady007:  4@s seems rather passive|pg||
nt|bobholl: joris inspired ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i think he should pass now. 4@s shows a bad hand for slam (else 4@c)|pg||
nt|bebechira: tell him not to pass Dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: without @c lead it's one out of 2 finesses|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 trupms and 12 points doubtfull|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: with @c lead you need @dK onside (best chance)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: you don't finesse @c at trick 1 as you need at least another finesse, take @cA and finesse @d only 1 finesse needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: S has no|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  at different colors the risk of 3D might be less|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but at these colors it wouldnt take much for N to save at 5D with a fit. here for example:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  of course a save might be ok, but if he has a stiff heart you probably want to defend|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: though 12 tricks can be made    not a good contract|pg||

nt|bobholl: but the red kings position he didn't like :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Israel in 4 as well in the open room..so it will be flat|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: in their system van den Bos could have bid 3@h over 1@s as well to show 4@s and good hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but he elected to show a good hand for NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  though a second sapde might find 22 spades in which case he could take the club finesse|pg||
mb|2H|nt|grebrof: well, S started it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: weak NT coming in action|pg||
nt|lady007:  NS have 25 high card points but on this hand it will probably be east to open 1N!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: favourable diamond position|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  lets see if NS play penalty doubles here|pg||

nt|vugraphzcy: and we are back|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mcsd: especially when one team was 24 imps ahead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D    can be canape with longer @C or @S  but often weak NT|pg||
nt|muppe: 3@s probably mixed raise showing 4@s and 7-9p|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: It is of course van Prooijen - Verhees playing at the 3rd table, sry|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mcsd: now only 13|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it was an excellent grand slam - let's hope NS in the other room bid it too - otherwise it's a bit of a random swingf |pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and 3 NT seems a likely contract here, so...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H usually less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=a) 4441@D, any  b) 4@S, BAL, 12-14  c) 5+@S 4+@D, min  or 55 MAX|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 2 down in 3 nt and another 9?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|psyck: Strong @c & Canape openings for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N natural invite -- how'd that get in there??|pg||
nt|niekbrink: declarer has a lack of communication to his hand if he doesn't want to play trumps|pg||
nt|muppe: Declarer might not ruff this to get trick with @sK. |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 2nt board 3ntx C and 3rd board 3@H +2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mcsd: a negative respose of 2@s should make S calm|pg||
nt|jbgood: but how calm? |pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe going for 4 @s?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we shall know in about twenty minutes :) |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@C by south (i think) since north has more or less denied a spade stop, and south hand cant force to 5 level|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzbf: not so calm :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|mcsd: this is not a calm bidd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = weak nt  [12-14], not 4333|pg||
nt|jjsb:  4@s is probably making with a squeeze i think itsp ossible @d break the squeeze |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, such a strange system, & i used to think 2NT is never to play :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Herbst brothers  lead vs NT = attitude    carding  odd/even|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees: funny that they have this option|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  2@D had other possible hand types  2N clarified|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: actually Louk trow away one more @D so didn't have any choice, saw a rare down possibility...|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Roel |pg||
nt|ahollan1: how about duck @D  then @S finesse before @C?|pg||
nt|friggi: sure|pg||
nt|friggi: but based on layout|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|psyck: yes, they needed to 'wrongside' it to make|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: there's a chance that 2@Hx was -2|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  3N mildly tricky here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT a fair contract e/w   but wrecked by the bad diamond split|pg||
nt|lady007:  3nt is a good contract but it is unlikely to make on this lay out (diamonds 41) and van Lankveld didnt believe in such a good hand from his partner and didnt try for game|pg||
nt|lady007:  will south get in with a double?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I would want to be in 7 on this hand |pg||
nt|bebechira: has to be...they had only 30 mins between set1 and set2|pg||
nt|sybarra: how pushy is N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: south may balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  of course W likely to lead club K but if not then S still has a safety play|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|bobholl: even 6 is on a finesse or j rd of @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: missing @H ace is likely to be cashed in 7 |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3rd|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi:  it doesnt matter since S will accept an invite|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  this probably puts W off the best lead of a spade|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|ady: e/w may well play this in 3 diamonds   and have to get diamond right to make that|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  yes though hearts always provide one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a spade lead, can set up fourth heart easily|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  he could, but would he?|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  33 hearts much less likely than 32 clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you dont have time for clubs on spade lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  depends where the entries lie|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but point well taken|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: guess this is all relaying do you know the meanings dennis ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: van den Bos relaying the hand here|pg||

nt|Vugraphzbn: Tahir taking time and planning the defence|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: we need Al Holland,  maybe he would know |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|lady007:  he can draw 3 rounds of trumps and discard a club on the 3rd heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: he it such an expert on systems|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is with the dropping @D J no @C finesse needed|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mashall it that 3/2 comment that likely after club lead?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: no guess   bound to play from the top|pg||

nt|sybarra: sorry all meant  6 @S is always cold imo |pg||
pc|sT|pc|d7|nt|bobholl: what if @D J 4th than you need @C finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: havent you been in worse slams with that layout?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzbn: only @c J lead takes it off|pg||

nt|sybarra: I am never good with 4/0 fits |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@d GF here, that's not surprising. But nowadays more pairs play this as INV 5-5 with a 2@c gadget|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: or forcing but always 55|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  why not just 2S from N ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me 2nt over 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: for results www.nbbportal.nl/1003|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  partner wont have 4 spades so 2S is safe and cheap|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is forcing and often unbalanced but not 55|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  2S might also put them off a spade lead|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: sorry it is S playing,  skip that remark |pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|marlowepi:  i want partner to know i have diamonds when i bid 3D, so he can make the bid that befits his hand without needing to worry if the 3D call was just an invention|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree 2@S is ok if that is your understanding, either way the jump shift without rules is not effective|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i dont mind inventing suits, but not when the call that does so takes up a lot of space|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are in 4@H in open room|pg||

pc|sA|nt|ady: could have ruffed a heart  rather than take a diamond finesse  on the assumption that west has A@C  could have then run the majors  and west would have been squeezed if holding K@D|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: on b.3|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: 5@s was doubled|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in 1970s i played a few versions   Blue Team Club  and  Roman [when it was allowed]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=longer @H   [5@H 5@S opens 1@H]|pg||
nt|jjsb:  discimpline pass by west , nto sure i even see 6@s ... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pierre Albarran [france] invented Canape|pg||
mb|2N|nt|niekbrink: 3nt x is for sure a better result than opps maken 4 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: what was thought to be the advantage of canape?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: pass must be forcing |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Italians brought it to world attention with Neopolitan Club [which became Blue Team Club], Roman and a few other systems that were short lived|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N normally has slam ambition, 4@D confirms willingness to cooperate  so PASS definitely forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not 100% certain that 4@D confirmed canape|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: It is, Verhees indicated it could even be 56|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S instead of 4@D might have been more helpful to Verhees|pg||
nt|friggi: sure ..greed is alw...in place:)|pg||
nt|pelu:  and 3NT easy game for EW - even 12 tricks|pg||
nt|jjsb:  well that really how important is this "practice" game for them |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: brink didn't trow @H10 first time, but the J, which confused Drijver....|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2/1 auction   1@H-1N//2@D-2@H|pg||
nt|niekbrink: south will find another bid|pg||
nt|muppe: But west cannot really pass without seeing his parnerts hand|pg||
nt|niekbrink: agree. what I wonder is, if 2 spades shows diamonds, how do they show clubs?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: or was 2 spades just any minor?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: their convention card isn't clear about it|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: I think just a minor, but not sure, couldn't hear everything|pg||
nt|muppe: NS hand fits well. South thinkin whether dbl or 4@S?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: what happens if south waits long enough and then doubles?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: can north still run?|pg||
nt|muppe: i think he cant|pg||
nt|muppe: but im not expert on law issues|pg||
nt|jjsb:  there is 7 tricks coming because of the nice @c situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at this vuls north can afford a somewhat offshape double|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hope pard understands that |pg||
nt|sybarra: the "that" being 5 @C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i have no idea what DBL over 3@H would show|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand does support recent article in ACBL Bulletin [by Mike Lawrence?] about efficacy of interfering over 1M-2N [game force raise]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note that if 4@D does show canape, then east has 4@H  with 5+@H and 4+@D he would open 2@D, not 1@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: so by deduction, 5 @C  must be a cue |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|mcsd: 3@D, 3@H and 3@C =|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the CR E won the second club with the J and didnt return a spade - so it made|pg||
nt|jbgood: N doesnt normally have 3 spades after this sequence, so should be possible|pg||
nt|niekbrink: well done by south|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: took him some time, but well done indeed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems as if Fisher is working on his slow ranking|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: Does it matter that they play with screens?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: spade shift not good enough i am afraid, declarer gets 3 spades, 3 hearts and 3 dias|pg||
nt|ahollan1: credit to NS for complicating the EW auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: it is @H6, but maybe only with all 4 hands visible...|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  5  [4@S+1]   Fisher-Schwartz did find the 5@CX save to pickup 8 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@S-2@S, Fisher bid a mere 3@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then took the save all by himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've never been good at those double shot situations where you let opponents exchange full info and THEN save|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|vugraphzbf: 2 spades, he pitched one|pg||
nt|jbgood: oops - sry - didnt see the spade discard (polishing my glasses)|pg||

nt|friggi: yes|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1:  3  Padon did NOT win @SA at trick 1   but won @CA and shifted to @H9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs 1N|pg||
nt|niekbrink: anyone wants to bet on another result?|pg||
nt|jjsb:  they are playing 7@c also for info other table |pg||
nt|baldfriede: did you mean "slow" or "low"?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: slow, is now on Roland's list of world's slowest players|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb:  board 3 that is |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: hmm...|pg||
nt|friggi: pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Drijver was thinking, Brink already holding his pass card, so must know Drijver was about to bid end contract|pg||
nt|friggi: at least decl..knows that he has to have all spots in place..makes del.easyer|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzbf: 31 imps difference now|pg||
nt|niekbrink: phew|pg||
nt|muppe: It does if the pause wouldnt be that long but now it for sure that it was S thinking so it doesnt matter enymore  I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be flat then - no reason to play for 3-0 trumps|pg||
nt|jjsb:  -1 is really good bridge its kinda clear on that board|pg||
nt|friggi: only problem is @C lead|pg||
nt|friggi: Q|pg||
nt|friggi: and hope for the best|pg||

nt|baldfriede: get every move right|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|niekbrink: only chance to beat this contract was north having 4 clubs without the kin and his partner having 2 spades|pg||

nt|baldfriede: yes; the Ger<man term is internationally used in chess. just like zugtwang is|pg||
nt|baldfriede: zugzwang*|pg||
nt|fabsayc: move compulsion, which in bridge is when the director arrives to warn the table|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|baldfriede: I compare move compulsion to being endplayed. any move you make is wrong; that's what the term "zugzwang" mEans|pg||

nt|jjsb:  well i would surely hate to be in that situation im just not sure the non trump lead is enough to considere a finesse |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 5: 3@C W-3 6:2@D N -2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 10-17 hcp, 5+suit|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@H|pg||
nt|friggi: problems|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT - 4@C|pg||
nt|friggi: except 2NT 24+ |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ahollan1: NS play a true Multi 2@D opener  to cover weak typical 2@H/@S opener and some strong hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: I thought that in bridge nowadays any 12 count is an opening bid, especially if you have 2 aces|pg||
nt|muppe: 4-3-3-3 12 count, maybe it's their style not to open then|pg||
nt|jjsb:  redouble here probably with a 5 card suite asking partner to bid 2@c |pg||
nt|fabsayc: must be north thinking, east had automatic pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 7: 3@D +3 W|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|niekbrink: if it is not your style to open this hand, is worth an invite now, or will he just bid game?|pg||
nt|muppe: Most certainly would open|pg||
nt|jjsb:  there is some different defense on a penalty double of 1 nt the important things is that to discuss it with partner !! |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: escape mechanism indeed....|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: not true|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: well i guess you were right :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: not true: I meant 4@h after a tempo break|pg||
nt|muppe: What is 2@d?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of my team-mates led a singleton trump against a grand slam after a RKCB auction with showed all the honours - at least, one hand had shown the queen - the trouble was, he ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: didn't have it |pg||
nt|friggi: transfer|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|jbgood: bergen is always 4 - that i know - i live there|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: agree|pg||
nt|mcsd: sry for typos|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand "flops" well |pg||
nt|friggi: with points|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: I guess south intended it as GF relay, but north thought that this was not the case with passed  hand |pg||
nt|friggi: max|pg||
mb|4D!|an|no 3 hearts|mb|p|nt|muppe: maybe he forgot he was passed hand? your guess would be mine too|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: cant do anything wrong,  my kind of hand |pg||
nt|friggi: so now 7 is possible|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S!|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: Or is it to wild as a commentator to guess a misunderstanding for world champions?|pg||
mb|7C|nt|jjsb:  there is somle loosing play available here |pg||
nt|friggi: slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but without a peek, Verhees has to work through permutations of  both red Kings offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb:  but the probkem si u migth have some communication problem to play for K10x in @d in South |pg||

nt|bobholl: wally would also have passed on 1@H :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  van Lankveld found a usefull dummy with 3 trumps and the queen of diamond and it turned out to be a fine slam, especially on the bidding|pg||
nt|bebechira: new leader|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  well, yes, except for what i expect from defence. what was N's plan for beating the contract?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|ziahyder: yes 9|pg||

nt|fabsayc: roland is adding last effort to "worldclass disasters on BBO"|pg||

mb|d|nt|ady: this might be passed out|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i dont think ducking D can be right since dummy has heart king as an entry|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  he but declarer was very remiss in not duckinfirst trick in my opiniong t|pg||
nt|bobholl: bos should have ducked the first @C than 3 nt is unbeatable|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: van Lankveld did not alert dbl in time, so south bid 1@s first|pg||
mb|1D!|an|!H|nt|ady: north may not balamce|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to land in 3 nt here also |pg||
nt|bebechira: good result for Hop-Helmich in the open room|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is that what is meant by a "free bid"|pg||

nt|jbgood: and then there was one - unsignificant one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in other room Brink-Drijver don't play the 2-suited openers|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcsd: the CR score is correct on this one?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: dunno :)|pg||

mb|1C!|an|2+|mb|1D|nt|jbgood: so congrats to NS1 - and bye all|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|mcsd: Ty Jon, Ty Marko for a great job.|pg||

nt|friggi: dbl os 4M|pg||
nt|friggi: dangous stuff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D doesn't promise any points -- just prefers @S over @C  if west has both black suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hence the @S lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of those things you have to do|pg||
mb|d|nt|jjsb:  rigth |pg||
nt|jjsb:  n is probably kinda astonished :) |pg||
nt|jjsb:  N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: otherwise, they will make AAK in the majors and five club tricks for -120 and you can make 140 in 2M|pg||
nt|jjsb:  its not a clear situation he knows there is a fit in major but in other he has some "defensive" value |pg||
nt|mdgraham: (or -500 in 2M, of course)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most pairs would not be sure of their agreements here, you suspect - is double 100% penalty? |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: all in favor of a pass or anyone wants to score big with N and run the risk of EW finding a better play?|pg||
nt|jjsb:  its an awkaward decision really |pg||
nt|jjsb:  i do pass personally |pg||
nt|mdgraham: North can be pretty sure South has a club void - as a spec says, if South is 5/5M 4M may be on|pg||
nt|jjsb:  as its commented on the audio and some specs some are suprised he didnt act rigth away |pg||
nt|jjsb:  i agree he wouldnt have been in that situation |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: at the 3rd table 2@C went 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: only it was played by North :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=5-11   i don't know if that means  forcing or semi-forcing or non-force :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: Is 2@s weak two or 5@s and a minor?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mcsd: ah da I cestitke Vrnjackoj Banji :) Dobro su se drzali do pred kraj.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looking at south hand  i assume forcing|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: south making good use of his strong @H spots|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if @H6 suggests @D shift|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 2 spades is natural weak 2|pg||
nt|friggi: yes J |pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcsd: Bilo je i kvalitetnijih timova, po rejtingu, koji su ispali iz trke ranije.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally  2nd trick is a situation for Smith Echo, but that doesn't really apply with this dummy|pg||
nt|friggi: and small @H|pg||
pc|d6|nt|niekbrink: 2nt asking|pg||
nt|niekbrink: I guess 3 clubs is eiter a minimum and a bad suit or shortage|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 3@C shortage|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2NT is unequivocally clubs, you can play pass then double by North as penalties |pg||
nt|sybarra: easiest lead for declarer |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|muppe: this is not making|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually, you can do anything you like with the variousn combinations of pass and double |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the important thing is to be on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|friggi: Q@C or small @H|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mcsd: We have no idea what happend with 2@h dbld|pg||
nt|ahollan1: verhees hoping for @CJ from vP --- sorry partner|pg||

nt|baldfriede: too many @d to discard them all|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|niekbrink: alert double by Fisher|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: club 10 was suit preference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially when Verhees ducks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mcsd: Kibbitz suggests that if 2@h dbls the rulings retun 2@H dbld to -1 and 3nt makes on this one then Vrnjacka Banja winns|pg||
nt|friggi: looking at dummy htis bluff dont work|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|muppe: I think N was hoping more with those spades|pg||

pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: 4@S, no choice even if west has only 4 will play well|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|muppe: He might just play for 9 tricks, now he has a finesse in @h.|pg||
nt|muppe: oh sry he has 9 top tricks now|pg||
nt|niekbrink: not if drijver plays low|pg||
nt|niekbrink: then he has 10 top tricks, but no possibility to make 13|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently 4@C was cue bid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yep|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|niekbrink: if drijver plays the J of hearts, he can win the ace, finesse heart to dummy. play 10 of diamonds for a diamond finess. repeat eh finesse in diamonds and cross to the king of clubs ...|pg||
nt|niekbrink: to cash the 13 diamond and his 3th heart|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|niekbrink: so, 3heart tricks, 6 club tricks and 4 diamond tricks - 13|pg||
nt|jjsb:  some security play avalaible in @d|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: so that's why 2@h is natural, if 2@c would be 5-5 2@h wasn't natural|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  this is too conservative in my view|pg||
mb|p|nt|tipu: otherwise a routine pass   within a second|pg||

pc|hT|nt|ahollan1:  6  Fisher playing 6@H west|pg||
nt|davidb: the  averrage age of the 2 pairs 23 \24|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the spectators -- David is father of our North player|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the Neth. team not all that much older |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe average a couple of years older |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought muller is a couple of decades older|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe yes on that |pg||
nt|sybarra: all of 40?|pg||
nt|davidb: the 2 israeli young  pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pics of some of the players available by clicking on the name at http://www.bridge.nl/topbridge-algemeen/1635-nedisr2012|pg||
nt|davidb: a tea hand..|pg||
nt|sybarra: I met Dr. Schwartz and the young team in Philly a couple of years ago at WBF event|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 6@H made on board 6, so the Israeli continue their streak....|pg||
nt|davidb: Ron's  father 2010|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: name is Gabriel |pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 4@C = cue  either 4-fit or good 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H would show 4-fit but bad hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: grand with an overtrick, in fact|pg||
nt|baldfriede: rather wobbly stopper in @d, but the way cards sit it works|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some entry problems|pg||
pc|h2|nt|niekbrink: but nevertheless :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jjsb:  im afraid i will not be able to help u on the bidding ... :) |pg||

nt|mdgraham: You'd bet they will get there, but it might take some time|pg||
nt|jjsb:  im ok til 1nt :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: they play precision with some adjustments, also too impossible for me to describe unfortunately|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: 1st question for NS --  who's on lead???|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|niekbrink: but played in west, not so easy for N to lead a club|pg||
nt|jjsb:  i have been told that 3@s is showing that shape specifically |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Muller is indeed asking for shape etc|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|muppe: but too risky to find those saves |pg||
nt|ahollan1: just confirmed  that link gets picture of all 12 participants of this team match|pg||
pc|cK|nt|muppe: in imps, they might cost too much|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: after @S lead -- declarer would try to guess which minor suit to play for @S discard|pg||
nt|jjsb:  i think its possible here East doesnt lnow if west got 7 or 6 of @h |pg||
nt|jjsb:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 4nt was keycards, 5@H showed 2 as @DA is useless opposite a void, which was shown already|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jjsb:  the play is not all academic as its point out i nthe audio |pg||
nt|mdgraham: when pard jumps to a grand - put down dummy|pg||
nt|jjsb:  u have 12 sure |pg||
nt|mdgraham: clubs 4-1 might break, as if you cash AK the 89 go from dummy, and the 7 will become good - but here all is well|pg||
nt|jjsb:  important sentence to remember in bridge when ur in a very good contract try to think of some bad situation when ur in a very poor contract try to imagine some lucky and nice distribution |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: and preferably with a pokerface|pg||
nt|jjsb:  can someone tell him he cant go down :) |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h5|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: both work since long trump with short @C|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||

nt|friggi: not the best %play|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|muppe: with @h 3-3, 11 tricks|pg||
nt|baldfriede: playing the 4 before the 9 is psychological to build up discarding pressure. "lots of more to come" is the message|pg||
pc|h3|mc|7|nt|sybarra: you do not need to answer that question David |pg||
nt|ahollan1: David -- after winning the trials, did the team have a choice of going to European Championship vs Olympiad?|pg||

nt|friggi: this will make due to distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he wasn't making 6@C either|pg||
nt|niekbrink: great lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: brink started "without" thinking a @H, had ofcourse some time to think before a contract was certain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure how DBL affects the responses to this stayman-like 3@C relay|pg||
nt|friggi: bad dbl|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: the trouble is, if you raise to 5@S, you are telling NS they can make a slam.... |pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they don't have much room left to find the best one, if indeed there is one|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: might bid normally "thru" doubles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D shows 4/5@D and NOT 4@H/@S|pg||

pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: Meckstroth-Rodwell have a good treatment after bids like 5@S - they invert pass and double|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's how we were taught by Marty Bergen|pg||
