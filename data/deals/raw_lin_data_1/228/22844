nt|frankaus: this will not trouble declarer|pg||
pc|h7|nt|henryb:  I think N should pass - 25 HCP max and 21 opposite 4 usually does not play well|pg||

mb|1N|nt|henryb:  F will gain 11 on board 5 - Rutkowski opened his 18 count 1N and Hoffman did not find a @s lead from Axx|pg||
mb|2H|nt|frankaus: some can X then bid @H as a negative free bid |pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Michaels with intermediate hands did not work for me|pg||
nt|benjent: I agree Roland - who wants to raise 3@h to 4 with those empty suits|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|benjent: In a funny sense, 2@s right-sided 4@h|pg||
nt|timb: top & bottom cues are probably the way to go (a 2@S cue promises 4 hearts and 6+ clubs)|pg||
nt|benjent: Hoffman was on lead, and didn't want to be. @sA gives West a ruffing finesse to get a @d loser away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill Jacobs would have led a trump|pg||
nt|benjent: Hoffman will suspect that Brightling has 4 trumps, and hope it is at least one trump trick|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|benjent: Bill would have been right! I hope his partner would have led one too|pg||

nt|frankaus: may be 4@H will make|pg||
pc|sT|nt|stiffqueen: this is a likely good result for harms with the hyper aggressive peter chan holding the east cards in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: East will have to get @S going before drawing all trumps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: Is it totally clear to lead @D against 6@S?  It might clarify the suit, but the 3@C bid already may have provided the same inference.|pg||
nt|bebechira: North is on lead... so probably he will try his singleton|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if 3@S o ver 3@H would have been forcing.  Certainly would be in my methods.  I have had poor luck with "advance cue-bids>"|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|nigel: A  routine auction for maybe 13 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: If 4N was key card in @D, I can see why west bid over 5@S, since he had the previously unshown @SKQ|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if both players are confident that they're on the same wavelength.|pg||
nt|bebechira: does Klinger knows about the spade fit?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|beauch:  on bd 4 at other table klinger/haughie forgot to ener the auction and lost 12 imps|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|bebechira: now the lead :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: What's 5@S?  I could argue that east's cue-bid over 3@H set @H as trumps . . .|pg||
pc|h8|nt|amarko: Gaspar/Richman bid many tight slams   and usually ahead in end|pg||
nt|beauch:  another likely big swing to bailey team|pg||

nt|stiffqueen: presumably neill is selling his hand as weak with the majors and will bid 2 spades to play over 2 damonds ?|pg||

nt|othered1: 2N showed a weak minor 2-suiter.    It's hard not to abid game on west hand, but some may expect a bit more in high cards.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As long as South ducks a round of clubs, this 1NT looks to be going down|pg||

pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: A nice attempt at some sort of suicide squeeze by Klinger|pg||

nt|stiffqueen: that means roger is feeling good|pg||

mb|2D|nt|athene: yes, auctions after a strong club and a negative are awkward at the best of times|pg||
mb|d|nt|amarko: nice easy game for e/w here|pg||
nt|othered1: Raptor overcalls, for exam;ple|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: there are just too many hands opener can hold; you can't show them all, with 1@C-1@D taken away already|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: south should be going for 6@D with this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|stiffqueen: a boring part score hand - januske may bid 2 hearts but e/w are likely to always go about +100|pg||
nt|frankaus: running out of boards - need some big swings if finikiotus is to make final|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: 3@D is a pretty serious bid, at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well, this was a pretty good result for the 1NT overcall ... down 1, with a NT partial easy the other way ... in fact, I don't think 3NT by N/S can be stopped|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stiffqueen: hmm - right sided but the defence can still easily find 6 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps not, but unbiddable and if they  have values for game, they have values to double 1N in many cases.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If they had doubled 1NT (I would have, with the North cards), E/W have a fairly easy escape to 2@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wouldn't advise anyone to give up the natural 1NT overcall ... if you don't have it in the arsenal, hands such as West's are very hard to bid|pg||

pc|h9|nt|beauch:  bye andrew and all|pg||
nt|othered1: Very normal contract, and auction, if you open west's junky 12 count.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: of course north would have liked better diamonds for a 3-level overcall but hands with both minors are difficult to show after opps open a weak-2|pg||
nt|amarko: wow think n/s have good vul save?|pg||
nt|frankaus: next match is likely to be the crucial match - Hoffmam (3rd) plays Finikiotis (2nd)  start time 90 minutes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bebechira: Prescott 36 up now...Finikiotis would not want to loose badly this match|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not extolling alternate meanings for 1N overcall -- I play it (very) strong myself.  But it's not longer a universal approach.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: i believe garozzo plays a 3@c overcall to show both minors, so he obviously thinks it is a problem hand|pg||
nt|othered1: @S was normal lead on the auction|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nigel: Looks like 4@d = Minorwood|pg||
nt|amarko: bye David|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|athene: now he has 12 on top|pg||
nt|athene: and the only chance for 13 is a black-suit squeeze on west|pg||
nt|athene: which doesn't work because he doesn't have both of the @CKQ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|stiffqueen: a chance now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: declarer must play a heart to the ace not finesse - then the last diamond pitching a club for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|athene: now he can unblock the @HK, trump to dummy, cash the hearts throwing clubs, then run the remaining trumps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|nigel: Thanks have to go now:)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|athene: but west can throw clubs leaving east to look after that suit|pg||

nt|bjacobs: "Stayman as originally published"?  What does that mean Ed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: As long as you include all variations (pupper, muppet, forcing, non-forcing, etc) that's accurate, at least in natural systems.|pg||
mb|p!|nt|amarko: maybe 3nt by n/s here  looks ok|pg||
mb|3H|nt|frankaus: finikiotus a 4 handed team - turned up last night at the local club for 28 boards :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I wouldn't act with east's hand, though some might|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I am talking: 2@D = no major, 2@H = hearts, 2@S = spades ... nothing beyond that.  Of course, the followups are by no means universal|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west may double a 1nt (or 2@S) rebid now|pg||

mb|4H|nt|othered1: Hard to make many NT when you have to knock out a bunch of aces|pg||

pc|d9|nt|athene: east is glad that didn't happen - it would have given him a bit of a problem|pg||

pc|s6|nt|stiffqueen: ron klinger opened the grubby 11 count as south in the other room leading a rather different contract !|pg||
pc|sA|nt|stiffqueen: this probably 2 off after harms wins the lead and switches a diamond|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: this will likely be 4 imnps to Hoffman (south making 8 or 9 tricks).|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: and switches a diamond....|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Poor players a little distracted withthe incessant screeching of the resident colony of rainbow lorikeets|pg||

nt|othered1: Another fantasy score here.  South didn't make nearly that many tricks.  |pg||

pc|hQ|nt|stiffqueen: bruce neill not having a great time as declarer|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Bruce said loudly to Roger, "You enjoy that, did you?" when he won the jack ofhearts. I think he paused unnecessarily at some stage. Roger said, "Sorry, I fell asleep"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North needed to switch to a club, rather than persist with the second heart|pg||
nt|othered1: with assistance from defense.  I don't think @C shift was impossible when in with @D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is where Smith is an essential gadget|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South would have been able to discourage hearts with his diamond play|pg||
