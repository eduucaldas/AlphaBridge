nt|penseur9: will N preempt here to 3@H|pg||
mb|1C|nt|henryb:  I certainly would not make an unfavorable vulnerability 2 level overcall with the S hand - bad suit, three small in opener's suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|henryb:  2@s is a constructive overcall, about 8-12 with six spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  Haughie has a super maximum, but he is at unfavorable vul|pg||

nt|penseur9: to slow again :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|penseur9: the IMPs are comming in fast and furious this morning (at the site)|pg||
nt|penseur9: 4@H or 4@S for NS here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: +660 can't be bad|pg||
nt|penseur9: might make 6 on a non @D lead|pg||
nt|penseur9: 4 boards to go here and 9 to compare|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Klinger-Haughie use still another point count to define their 1N openers; "Zars" points, which is a 5-4-3-2-1 scale. 1N is 22-25 Zars points|pg||
nt|chick: Zar points are my favorite hand eval method too|pg||
nt|chick: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|henryb:  I apologize to all, but I must retire.|pg||
nt|penseur9: could get a few back here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chick: actually, zar points are a 6-4-2-1 scale, although I don't know if Klinger-Haughie modify that|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugrapha2: Thanks to everyone who's watching =-).|pg||
nt|fabsayc: make some noise if watching|pg||
nt|timb: NS at the other table could have defended 2@S, for a brutal result for EW|pg||
nt|timb: 2@S doubled that is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: Yeah|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h = 5+@h and a 4+ card minor|pg||
nt|penseur9: but a born optimist :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: maybe here :)|pg||
nt|timb: 5@D is the only makeable game by NS (Deep Finesse)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|timb: In 2@S NS can take @CA-K, @C ruff, two hearts, two diamonds and @SQ|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: play is kind of boring|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: A lot of thinking going on here|pg||
nt|timb: this should make +130|pg||

nt|ianmcc: best get the NT into W|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|henryb:  an old fashioned limit raise|pg||
nt|chick: reverse bergen sort of limit raise|pg||

pc|h5|nt|henryb:  3@c shows 8-11, 4+ card support|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: 1@H=spades, 2@D artificial game force|pg||
pc|h6|nt|stiffqueen: Peter Chan is always an optimist when it comes to bidding|pg||
nt|fabsayc: direct 4@H by Klinger might have been better, in light of 4@H making in open room|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but for my money, brightling priority was to show 3 spades (maybe he did with 1@S)|pg||
nt|penseur9: it's funny but I've come to the conclusion the with a 10 card suit, always play the ace and hope the king drops... works more often then not for some reason|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||

nt|henryb:  could have claimed when both opponents followed to first spade|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
nt|penseur9: seems that 3@S makes NS here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Loses to Kx and K10x onside which is much more likely than stiff K offside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So don't do that, André :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: ok 2 boards to go this round (penultimate knowledgeable people would say) :)|pg||

nt|henryb:  Fantoni and Nunes play 1@h = 4 or 5 spades, or 6 with a game force, and 2@s = 6 spades, invitational|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes I agree|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bebechira1: last board coming up..many thanks to Phil and Martin for help...excellent job gentlemen|pg||

nt|penseur9: also thanks to the ABF for allowing us to broadcast this fine tournament|pg||
mb|1D|nt|stiffqueen: this has been a terribly flat 16 boards - a mere 15 imps trading hands|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||

nt|penseur9: now with winter comming, if you wanted a 2000 more spectators, why not play between midnight a 6am... all of the Americas and Europe would be there :|pg||
