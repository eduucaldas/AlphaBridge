nt|penseur9: last board here... excellent 1st time work by Edward our operator... well done|pg||
mb|1D|nt|stiffqueen: this has been a terribly flat 16 boards - a mere 15 imps trading hands|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|vugrapha2: They've all been awesome. Loved the Warren Buffett chit chat earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: can we convince them to bid 6@H for a little excitment :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: actually getting to game is not automatic|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@H = @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 1@D opening?, really|pg||
