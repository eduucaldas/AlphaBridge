nt|lady007:  welcome to the final of the white house juniors|pg||
nt|lady007:  we saw 2 very close matches yesterday, lets hope it will be just as exciting today!|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we are go|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: lose by 19, because they should lead by 20 :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lool|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  on the first board EW can make 4@s, even with the bad breaks, but they shouldnt get any higher|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|Vugraphzbn: they play Capp (transfers)  over 1M  -  X  - |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: so 2@s is a weak  raise |pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @S guess i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|Vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan open teams national trials segment 2/4 from lahore.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbn: I missed the bidding but the contract is 2NT by South|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|bebechira: they will bid 4s and will come down to find the trumps quuen|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  Fisher leads his nice heart sequence instead of his singleton, because he has good spades and is not looking for a ruff|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan Open teams National Trials from Lahore|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Vugraphzbn: @cQ can be only vital card of the whole deal|pg||
nt|lady007:  now lets see how van den Bos should play. he is probably worried about spades 4-1, but the bidding makes it more likely its with north than with south|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyf: if you misguess can eliminate @c and @d and let them open the @h|pg||
nt|bebechira: queen even|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but won't work here|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3d?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: reverse flannery 2@S response would work on this hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lady007:  he pitches a diamond, because if diamonds are 32, he can always discard a club on the diamonds later|pg||
nt|lady007:  north might have made it more difficult for declarer here to duck his ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi all |pg||
nt|bebechira: hi Shirley, Martin|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: why not dennis :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: because North has both @h|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: Farrukh planning discards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: fist on the mouth|pg||
nt|bebechira: ambitious contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  hi all :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  welcome back for the exciting conclusion of this intense match|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is the 3rd and final session of this final|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  hi dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: hi marshall|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Mashall |pg||
nt|marlowepi:  hi shirley:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: in case both teams finish tied Netherlands Red wins the tournament as they were ranked higher in the Swiss|pg||
nt|bebechira: it will not happen twice Dennis|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  what if only one team finishes tied?:)|pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: we had it 3 or 4 years ago, tie-break in both semi-final and final|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  do we know why the organizers use that tie-break method instead of extra boards?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only if east ducks club queen can i see any hope for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: there was a reason, but can't remember it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobholl: n already place after the @D :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: nice|pg||
nt|bobholl: placed|pg||
nt|xenya:  an ambitious 3N -- 1@S showed both majors?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no doubt to be sure the tournament finishes at a specific time|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably has to do with time schedules for flights home |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bobholl: J@H his only possibilty|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done by joris (or just lucky ?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this final consists of 3 sessions of 14 boards|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|lady007:  declarer cant ruff his club anymore, but he can discard it on the diamonds. so 10 tricks it is|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bobholl: one @S and then @C would have been better|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|saverio: ciao all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzbf: hearts and spades, at least 4-4|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roghog:  http://www.bridge.nl/topbridge-algemeen/1635-nedisr2012 has convention cards: click on kaart|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|saverio: 4@s can be set by a small @c lead here   but very unlikely :)|pg||
nt|saverio: but E may add something  (not unreasonably)|pg||
nt|saverio: even if bal and no @c control may make him decide for pass|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|saverio: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: van Prooijen is still thinking.....|pg||
nt|saverio: not an easy pass   |pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jbgood: on repeated spade leads you can make 3 nt - but that is too much to ask|pg||
nt|mcsd: 3@D is maximum w should bidd now|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 down in 2 spades versus 3 @d making|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice agreement on the S bid:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: looks as if we are in for a SLOW set - again|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzbf: yes :(|pg||
nt|jbgood: specs will notice that thinking much and then passing doesnt help much.)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards from 2011 Bermuda Bowl are online   NS:http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Israel/Herbst_Herbst.pdf|pg||

nt|ahollan1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Israel/Herbst_Herbst.pdf|pg||
nt|saverio: now @c A and @c can set it   no more needed to underlead the A   and slowly easier to find|pg||
nt|psyck: not easy but W only showed a disctributional hand with no further interest, didnt think E would go forward when 5 level could be risky with no @c control|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees a little disappointed with his very first bid of this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|saverio: thats true    but his DBL was promising 12+  he has 18  and good controls     always easier looking at all hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: true, & no has @c discards too...|pg||

nt|bebechira: any imp important |pg||
nt|fabsayc: spectators see more than 2 down actually|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: great to see that the sponsors of this tournament (Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford) are watching live at the table|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably they are right...|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|grebrof: hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: Sorry got disconnected ....4@s is being played |pg||
nt|lady007:  2@d transfer, showing hearts|pg||
nt|lady007:  EW can even make 6@h here on the very lucky layout of the cards, but most likely they will get to 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lady007:  Fisher bid 4@s because of his 64 but he wont buy a very usefull dummy. this can get expensive|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan open teams national trials FINAL segment 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: I DONT bid on west garbage|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  the best reason for bidding on the W garbage is that doing so might assist you in your choice of lead against the final contract. feedback from E could be crucial|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well either 4@H or 5@D is better, but west has to find a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: that lead not bad for declarer |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: juniors bid 4@H seniors like me 3@H :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzbn: routine +1|pg||
nt|lady007:  this will be at least 800|pg||
nt|bobholl: but i have always been a chicken |pg||
nt|bebechira: coffee hand?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzyf: they lead 4th best against 3NT|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lady007:  hi david|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: after these one is gonna be 5 min.break tks.all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi:  i find it a bit odd to lead a spade. why not attack the suit that can provide the most tricks when it is right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: so van den Bos knows that they cannot cash 4 @ss now|pg||
nt|sybarra: specs suggesting 6 @D by S pretty good  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzbe: these is the last board in these round the next one will start at 5pm CET (in 1h30min) thanks all :)|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|d3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 12 tricks in hearts as they lay    but  this will be a poor result for Israel|pg||
nt|lady007:  if EW can avoid playing diamonds, declarer might face a nast guess to avoid 1100|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: another part score battle (if battle is the right word considering the previous one)|pg||
mb|1N|an|asking|nt|psyck: a typical 1st seat fav vul bid...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|niekbrink: Frank Bakkeren plays another session with Ron Schwartz|pg||
nt|niekbrink: Lotan fischer will arrive shortly|pg||
nt|muppe: Here NS has slightly misfit, will see how high they will bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|jbgood: E doesnt think much of his 5 bagger:)|pg||
nt|saverio: N hasnt a tool to show 2 suiter it seems |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: Lotan Fisher hasn't arrived yet. I don't know why. Till then Frank Bakkeren will play. This pair also played the first session|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: there is a 3rd table, not broadcasted by BBO but we will give you the results as well. 1st board 1nt +1 by north|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: like the previous session I will also give interesting results from the 3rd table, not visible on BBO. board 1 6@S x -1|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|psyck: or he may have required a better hand for it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|jbgood: I withdraw the word "battle" totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW signals  upside-down count & attitude [udca]   odd/even discards|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: at the third table I think it is Netherlands EW as well, so this table doesn't compare to the third table|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|muppe: This seems to be too high for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog:  http://www.bridge.nl/groepen/Wedstrijdzaken/1112/ccBirman&Padon.pdf for NS card|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzcy: ok, it is Lotan Fisher who is playing, I will correct this|pg||
nt|niekbrink: complicated  hand. many options for both declarer and defenders|pg||
nt|niekbrink: But defenders are favorites to beat this contract|pg||
nt|muppe: not easy return for E, @h would be best this time|pg||
nt|niekbrink: club is not an option I guess. Diamonds doesn't seem pretty either and trump could be expensive if the clubs run|pg||
nt|muppe: But ofcorse he doesnt know that his parntner has @hA|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: well done by Drijver|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|muppe: nice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: South is  R  Schwartz|pg||
pc|cT|nt|saverio: i'd think AK and AK enough to show 2 suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk4: unless Bakkeren is a substitute|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is he?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|niekbrink: My information is that Frank Bakkeren indeed is a substitute|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ron Schwartz did not arrive yet. Now you know why, Marshall|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mcsd: Now if he plays for ruffing @H he will promote T@C for @S|pg||
nt|mcsd: for South|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|d3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jbgood: and even if he doesnt - he may be forced|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|jbgood: but now he is ok|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ron arrived a few minutes ago I am told|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so he will probably replace Bakkeren shortly|pg||

nt|grebrof: I guess they found the @dshift|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: Lead increasing|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  NL lost an opportunity there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade lead required Qxxxx in east as well as a red card, so i tend to agree, Marshall|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  but then, so did Israel:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 7@S on  with 3 finesses |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|marlowepi:  yes and low spade might well even  block suit when E does have Qxxxx|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lady007:  a possible slam hand for NS coming up here|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 15 flat.. 4s bid and made at both tables|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  oh sorry, i thought W had led from KJ8x|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|qasim2003: nice bid given that they are trying to recover alot of imps this segment|pg||
nt|lady007:  they can make both 6@h and 6@s if they guess the spades (and possible the clubs, on a unlikely club lead if played by north)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to small slam   and make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry @C wrong so 6|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  now i see it is the 5|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|qasim2003: i'd bid 4@h with the S hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: a true yarborough in N hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: (not even a 10 makes it a yarb)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  S would LIKE to bid 3D as a lead-director over 2H, byut that could work out poorly|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Fisher knows that he can save for a probable 500, but decides not to|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|qasim2003: but 3@h makes so a nice result for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess he 'll show a good "pudding"raise now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@c should show 4@s now|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  hmmmm|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|grebrof: this reminds me of a friend -  has no dbl in my mind|pg||
nt|lady007:  4@s seems rather passive|pg||
nt|bobholl: joris inspired ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i think he should pass now. 4@s shows a bad hand for slam (else 4@c)|pg||
nt|bebechira: tell him not to pass Dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: without @c lead it's one out of 2 finesses|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 trupms and 12 points doubtfull|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: with @c lead you need @dK onside (best chance)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: you don't finesse @c at trick 1 as you need at least another finesse, take @cA and finesse @d only 1 finesse needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: S has no|pg||
nt|ady: no   not even a try from North   maybe direct raise to 3 limited with their methods|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bobholl: pity but understandable|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: although you need the 4th @d to be good as well...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|bobholl: he likes this :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  at different colors the risk of 3D might be less|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but at these colors it wouldnt take much for N to save at 5D with a fit. here for example:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  of course a save might be ok, but if he has a stiff heart you probably want to defend|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: though 12 tricks can be made    not a good contract|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|mb|4N!|nt|grebrof: 2@c will make some tricks thou - especially now - if @ds are played correctly|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C!|nt|fabsayc: now club to king is almost 100%|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  if S has stiff club not so good though|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H!|nt|grebrof: that was a nobrainger|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D!|nt|grebrof: with an extra g to top it|pg||
nt|grebrof: hmmm|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can you do better Marshall|pg||

nt|bobholl: but the red kings position he didn't like :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Israel in 4 as well in the open room..so it will be flat|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: but he elected to show a good hand for NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  though a second sapde might find 22 spades in which case he could take the club finesse|pg||

nt|lady007:  south is not unhappy about this contract :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: I certainly didnt come in on a happy hand |pg||
nt|bebechira: depends on the angle|pg||
nt|bobholl: for israel yes :)|pg||

nt|mcsd: in the last sets we can hope for swingy bidding|pg||
nt|niekbrink: probably only bid it if EW bid diamonds ;)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mcsd: especially when one team was 24 imps ahead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D    can be canape with longer @C or @S  but often weak NT|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|mcsd: now only 13|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it was an excellent grand slam - let's hope NS in the other room bid it too - otherwise it's a bit of a random swingf |pg||
mb|2H|nt|jbgood: and 3 NT seems a likely contract here, so...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H usually less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=a) 4441@D, any  b) 4@S, BAL, 12-14  c) 5+@S 4+@D, min  or 55 MAX|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 2 down in 3 nt and another 9?|pg||
nt|muppe: @d lead would be best|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: Strong @c & Canape openings for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N natural invite -- how'd that get in there??|pg||
nt|niekbrink: declarer has a lack of communication to his hand if he doesn't want to play trumps|pg||
nt|muppe: Declarer might not ruff this to get trick with @sK. |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 2nt board 3ntx C and 3rd board 3@H +2|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mcsd: a negative respose of 2@s should make S calm|pg||
nt|jbgood: but how calm? |pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe going for 4 @s?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we shall know in about twenty minutes :) |pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzbf: not so calm :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mcsd: this is not a calm bidd|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, such a strange system, & i used to think 2NT is never to play :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Herbst brothers  lead vs NT = attitude    carding  odd/even|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees: funny that they have this option|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: no :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|jbgood: 300 is 7 imps|pg||

pc|c5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has bid well here - without knowing all the systemic ramifications, it looks like he was showing four-card spade support (4@s) and good diamond values (3@d)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psyck: yes, they needed to 'wrongside' it to make|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzbf: there's a chance that 2@Hx was -2|pg||

nt|grebrof: well done - allthou could have ran the @s to the K at trick 1 - I would have anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: I assume break after this set? |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|lady007:  2@c is weak 2 in diamonds or strong|pg||
nt|lady007:  i have seen them open 2@c on a lot weaker hands than this one|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  3N mildly tricky here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT a fair contract e/w   but wrecked by the bad diamond split|pg||
nt|lady007:  3nt is a good contract but it is unlikely to make on this lay out (diamonds 41) and van Lankveld didnt believe in such a good hand from his partner and didnt try for game|pg||
nt|lady007:  will south get in with a double?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I would want to be in 7 on this hand |pg||
nt|bebechira: has to be...they had only 30 mins between set1 and set2|pg||
nt|sybarra: how pushy is N?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ady: south may balance|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi:  of course W likely to lead club K but if not then S still has a safety play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: even 6 is on a finesse or j rd of @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: missing @H ace is likely to be cashed in 7 |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3rd|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|marlowepi:  it doesnt matter since S will accept an invite|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  this probably puts W off the best lead of a spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club eight will be entry now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: e/w may well play this in 3 diamonds   and have to get diamond right to make that|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi:  yes though hearts always provide one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a spade lead, can set up fourth heart easily|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  he could, but would he?|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  33 hearts much less likely than 32 clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you dont have time for clubs on spade lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  depends where the entries lie|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but point well taken|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: guess this is all relaying do you know the meanings dennis ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: van den Bos relaying the hand here|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ady: on that lead easy make|pg||
nt|lady007:  now declarer can even afford to misguess the diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Vugraphzbn: good @hJ trying to tell declarer  I m singleton @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: Tahir taking time and planning the defence|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: we need Al Holland,  maybe he would know |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lady007:  he can draw 3 rounds of trumps and discard a club on the 3rd heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: he it such an expert on systems|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is with the dropping @D J no @C finesse needed|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: Mashall it that 3/2 comment that likely after club lead?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: no guess   bound to play from the top|pg||
nt|lady007:  north can ruff, but declarer can discard a losing club then|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry all meant  6 @S is always cold imo |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: what if @D J 4th than you need @C finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: havent you been in worse slams with that layout?|pg||

nt|bobholl: sure this is a 60% slam or so|pg||

nt|sybarra: I am never good with 4/0 fits |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 3@d GF here, that's not surprising. But nowadays more pairs play this as INV 5-5 with a 2@c gadget|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: or forcing but always 55|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  why not just 2S from N ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me 2nt over 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: for results www.nbbportal.nl/1003|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  partner wont have 4 spades so 2S is safe and cheap|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is forcing and often unbalanced but not 55|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  2S might also put them off a spade lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: sorry it is S playing,  skip that remark |pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i want partner to know i have diamonds when i bid 3D, so he can make the bid that befits his hand without needing to worry if the 3D call was just an invention|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree 2@S is ok if that is your understanding, either way the jump shift without rules is not effective|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i dont mind inventing suits, but not when the call that does so takes up a lot of space|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are in 4@H in open room|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: 2 imps for NL this was|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  wow, wild hand here|pg||
nt|ady: Israel gained 3 imps on hand 4 where 2@D was down 4     also 1NT opened by east   and west scrambled to 2 hearts  3 down|pg||
nt|lady007:  what to bid with van Lankvelds hand?|pg||
nt|ady: what a freak|pg||
mb|1C|nt|tipu: 17 is the difference|pg||

mb|2C|nt|tipu: We have what we wanna see|pg||
nt|bebechira: another one?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: decent chance to get diamond right  on the weak 2 opening|pg||
nt|lady007:  and a 5@s bid might have seen his partner raise to 6 on this hand as well|pg||
nt|bebechira: they just put out of their heads the 5c|pg||

nt|fabsayc: non spade lead seems right|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  cold double dummy even without spade lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  and you would play it in the way that works|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: he can set up 4th @c without letting North in|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzbn: misdefense was the last hope he let it to the opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: & they did nt dissappoint him|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbn: only have to ruff 2 @C in Dummy|pg||

nt|bebechira: yes indeed|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the locals here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how do you make on diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyf: is a 5th @s, AK of @h and a possibly very valuable @dJ enough to make another bid now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would surely after 5@C |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S by south was ok, but this should go down|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: on club lead you could duck|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  up with ace and nine of clubs|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bebechira: North is considering slam?|pg||

nt|bebechira: hard to make this one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: furthermore, south has indicated a singleton or void in clubs, so north 6 not that unreasonable|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: yes, 3-4c supp 5-8hcp|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: 4-10 hcp|pg||
nt|niekbrink: remarkable pass by south|pg||
nt|jjsb:  well i would surely hate to be in that situation im just not sure the non trump lead is enough to considere a finesse |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS play a true Multi 2@D opener  to cover weak typical 2@H/@S opener and some strong hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|niekbrink: I thought that in bridge nowadays any 12 count is an opening bid, especially if you have 2 aces|pg||
nt|muppe: 4-3-3-3 12 count, maybe it's their style not to open then|pg||
nt|jjsb:  redouble here probably with a 5 card suite asking partner to bid 2@c |pg||
mb|2D|nt|niekbrink: if it is not your style to open this hand, is worth an invite now, or will he just bid game?|pg||
nt|muppe: Most certainly would open|pg||
nt|jjsb:  there is some different defense on a penalty double of 1 nt the important things is that to discuss it with partner !! |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: escape mechanism indeed....|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jbgood: not true|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: well i guess you were right :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: not true: I meant 4@h after a tempo break|pg||
nt|muppe: What is 2@d?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of my team-mates led a singleton trump against a grand slam after a RKCB auction with showed all the honours - at least, one hand had shown the queen - the trouble was, he ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: didn't have it |pg||
mb|3D|nt|jbgood: bergen is always 4 - that i know - i live there|pg||
nt|mcsd: cold call directir?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: i agre, they should call him|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: agree|pg||

mb|p|nt|niekbrink: I guess south intended it as GF relay, but north thought that this was not the case with passed  hand |pg||

nt|jjsb:  N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: otherwise, they will make AAK in the majors and five club tricks for -120 and you can make 140 in 2M|pg||
nt|jjsb:  its not a clear situation he knows there is a fit in major but in other he has some "defensive" value |pg||
nt|mdgraham: (or -500 in 2M, of course)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most pairs would not be sure of their agreements here, you suspect - is double 100% penalty? |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: all in favor of a pass or anyone wants to score big with N and run the risk of EW finding a better play?|pg||
nt|jjsb:  its an awkaward decision really |pg||

nt|mdgraham: North can be pretty sure South has a club void - as a spec says, if South is 5/5M 4M may be on|pg||

pc|d4|nt|mcsd: Bilo je i kvalitetnijih timova, po rejtingu, koji su ispali iz trke ranije.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally  2nd trick is a situation for Smith Echo, but that doesn't really apply with this dummy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|niekbrink: 2nt asking|pg||
nt|niekbrink: I guess 3 clubs is eiter a minimum and a bad suit or shortage|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 3@C shortage|pg||

nt|bobholl: but my hopes are not to great :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  here it looks as if hearts will run which increases the attractiveness of passing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tipu: @dT is the correct card|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  the spade weakness and prime nature of your side cards argue for suit play though.|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  so there are arguments both ways...and when that is the case, maybe should go for the 9 trick game as a decider|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphzbn: @sQ   where are you    :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you pitch a diamond, west a heart|pg||

nt|bobholl: @S k will grow if he takes it and otherwise thrown in|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: west must duck, but club still squeezes him|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 4@C -- transfer to your suit  [ignoring the 2N bid]|pg||

mb|p|nt|muppe: South has pretty good hand for 15-17NT, the value of great 6@c suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jjsb:  not that u can bid 5@d of course |pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: or not|pg||

pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: it would have worked better if Verhees was on same page|pg||

pc|s2|nt|niekbrink: that will do the job for WE|pg||

nt|muppe: Top spade or small?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: board 5 has been corrected to 3nt -1 N|pg||
nt|davidb: why not H?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: on a heart lead south can make 13 tricks I think|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|muppe: ok @h|pg||
nt|jjsb:  ok so a no brainer at the play apparently |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|muppe: He might just play for 9 tricks, now he has a finesse in @h.|pg||
nt|muppe: oh sry he has 9 top tricks now|pg||
nt|niekbrink: not if drijver plays low|pg||
nt|niekbrink: then he has 10 top tricks, but no possibility to make 13|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|niekbrink: if drijver plays the J of hearts, he can win the ace, finesse heart to dummy. play 10 of diamonds for a diamond finess. repeat eh finesse in diamonds and cross to the king of clubs ...|pg||
nt|niekbrink: to cash the 13 diamond and his 3th heart|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h4|nt|niekbrink: so, 3heart tricks, 6 club tricks and 4 diamond tricks - 13|pg||
nt|jjsb:  some security play avalaible in @d|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|niekbrink: now he lacks communication for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|muppe: @h8 was good, now he cant risk @d finesse or he could go down|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just in case East has A109x|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|jjsb:  ok so the @h finesse will be safe now |pg||
pc|c5|nt|niekbrink: of course, south was not gonna take all these risks and probably just cashing his tricks|pg||
nt|muppe: he can try @dQ if E covers|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|niekbrink: was the hesitation long enough?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: no|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: so that's why 2@h is natural, if 2@c would be 5-5 2@h wasn't natural|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  this is too conservative in my view|pg||
mb|p|nt|tipu: otherwise a routine pass   within a second|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|tipu: win in hand & @dA back a @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i would not have bid 4@h here with singelton @s and a hand of potential|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  the hearts are awful but the hand is good. i would be happy to put this dummy down for 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some tool to check on four card support needed|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i would just bid 2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: has to avoid losing 3 trump tricks in 4 spades|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  may well make   especially if bring in 6 club tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 5+@H|pg||

mb|3S|nt|niekbrink: but nevertheless :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb:  im afraid i will not be able to help u on the bidding ... :) |pg||

mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 1st question for NS --  who's on lead???|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: but played in west, not so easy for N to lead a club|pg||
nt|jjsb:  i have been told that 3@s is showing that shape specifically |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: Muller is indeed asking for shape etc|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|muppe: but too risky to find those saves |pg||
mb|7H|nt|muppe: in imps, they might cost too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: after @S lead -- declarer would try to guess which minor suit to play for @S discard|pg||
nt|jjsb:  i think its possible here East doesnt lnow if west got 7 or 6 of @h |pg||
nt|jjsb:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 4nt was keycards, 5@H showed 2 as @DA is useless opposite a void, which was shown already|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jjsb:  the play is not all academic as its point out i nthe audio |pg||
nt|mdgraham: when pard jumps to a grand - put down dummy|pg||
nt|jjsb:  u have 12 sure |pg||
nt|mdgraham: clubs 4-1 might break, as if you cash AK the 89 go from dummy, and the 7 will become good - but here all is well|pg||
nt|jjsb:  important sentence to remember in bridge when ur in a very good contract try to think of some bad situation when ur in a very poor contract try to imagine some lucky and nice distribution |pg||

mb|p|mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: 5@S from Verhees??|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: yep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe vP would like to go back and try 3@S now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is why you have practice matches -- to talk about situations that haven't come up before|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: 11 tricks in NT without diamond lead....|pg||
mb|5S|nt|niekbrink: the 4 diamond bid is typical in the style of brink and Drijver. |pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: 5 diamonds is a good sacrifice again againgst 4 spades|pg||
nt|jjsb:  Mike what about east decision? are u doign same?|pg||
mb|d|nt|muppe: yes EW has put a pressure on NS, but NS find their good 4@s|pg||
nt|muppe: 4@s looks makeable|pg||
nt|niekbrink: losing a spade and a club|pg||
nt|niekbrink: maybe a heart ruff|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so 10 or 11 tricks I guess|pg||
nt|niekbrink: heart ruff not so easy to find when south is declaring|pg||
nt|muppe: but it's not over yet, E still thinking|pg||
nt|niekbrink: 5d is only 500 i think|pg||
nt|davidb: good  pass F -partner please  decide|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcy: Verhees said he was sleeping, thought it was 4@S instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|muppe: @sJx doesnt look nice for save, he cannot know for sure if 4@s is making or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he wasn't making 6@C either|pg||
nt|niekbrink: great lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: brink started "without" thinking a @H, had ofcourse some time to think before a contract was certain|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the trouble is, if you raise to 5@S, you are telling NS they can make a slam.... |pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they don't have much room left to find the best one, if indeed there is one|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|davidb: very  good  judgment  by all! high  level bridge|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|muppe: Now they will score @h ruff but still 10 tricks for declarer it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: par score reached|pg||
nt|jjsb:  again this hand shows the level of play really... |pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: better than this is hard to find, (world) transnational champions against the world champions|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|muppe: E will be endplayed|pg||
nt|niekbrink: will east endplay himself by ruffing?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|niekbrink: another endplay of B. Drijver!|pg||
nt|davidb: nuce play by E not ruffing -gives some chance!|pg||

nt|niekbrink: this time he is endplayed himself |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|muppe: yes had east not ruffed, it would have been more interesting|pg||
nt|niekbrink: how?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: declarer can ruff a heart in hand, finess a club and then find out he needs clubs 3-3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Meckstroth-Rodwell have a good treatment after bids like 5@S - they invert pass and double|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: brutal to think after partner opens that best spot is 3N|pg||
nt|niekbrink: sorry, finess a spade|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: welcome back marshall|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|s7|pc|c5|pg||

pc|d5|pc|s3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: van Prooijen ONLY bid that showed @C was 5@C    3@C/4@C both artificial raises of @H|pg||

mb|p|nt|niekbrink: giving away 1 heart to the queen|pg||
mb|2H|an|!D|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|mdgraham: the thing about the pass (requests double) is that responder doesn't have to double if he holds a very slam-suitable hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and board 10 (the 7@H) also flat|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: DBL promising both majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's how we were taught by Marty Bergen|pg||
nt|jjsb:  apparently east stop relaying and bid now naturally |pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: lots of tricks here without a club lead|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzcy: the 3rd table played 6@H, which was doubled and went 2 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzcy: sry, roubled, so a very expensive board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|muppe: Here declarer will probably guess @s and can discard @d loser on 4th @h when @h are 3-3 so 9 tricks|pg||
