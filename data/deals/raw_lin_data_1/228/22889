pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: don't like the X once again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: filthy flat 12|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb:  3@c shows 8-11, 4+ card support|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H=spades, 2@D artificial game force|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|stiffqueen: Peter Chan is always an optimist when it comes to bidding|pg||
nt|fabsayc: direct 4@H by Klinger might have been better, in light of 4@H making in open room|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|stiffqueen: this should be 2 off i think|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Thanks for that |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: This is like first time doing this|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: but for my money, brightling priority was to show 3 spades (maybe he did with 1@S)|pg||
nt|penseur9: it's funny but I've come to the conclusion the with a 10 card suit, always play the ace and hope the king drops... works more often then not for some reason|pg||

nt|henryb:  could have claimed when both opponents followed to first spade|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
nt|penseur9: seems that 3@S makes NS here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Loses to Kx and K10x onside which is much more likely than stiff K offside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So don't do that, André :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: ok 2 boards to go this round (penultimate knowledgeable people would say) :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: good point Roland :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: its just that its more memorable when K is stiff i guess|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2C|an|Hearts and Spades|nt|fabsayc: NS hand but they never got in auction in open room|pg||

nt|ianmcc: so Hoffman whittling away|pg||
pc|cK|nt|penseur9: 7 IMPs for Presctt on  27 with 3nt making in OR|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chick: two fine teams, both playing very well|pg||
nt|henryb:  Fantoni and Nunes play 1@h = 4 or 5 spades, or 6 with a game force, and 2@s = 6 spades, invitational|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes I agree|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bebechira1: last board coming up..many thanks to Phil and Martin for help...excellent job gentlemen|pg||
nt|stiffqueen: i am worrying about the second roundd of spades in 4 hearts - where is deep finesse when you need it ??|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Looks like the same contract as the other table|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that looks bad|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they need the @s trick|pg||

nt|penseur9: last board here... excellent 1st time work by Edward our operator... well done|pg||
nt|penseur9: last board this round...|pg||
mb|p|nt|stiffqueen: this has been a terribly flat 16 boards - a mere 15 imps trading hands|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I'm thinking in the previous hand, Gaspar (W) should have played the Q instead of the A of heart|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugrapha2: They've all been awesome. Loved the Warren Buffett chit chat earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: can we convince them to bid 6@H for a little excitment :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: actually getting to game is not automatic|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@H = @S|pg||
nt|penseur9: I wish to thank Edward, our operator on is 1st day for doing a real nice job...|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 1@D opening?, really|pg||
mb|2D|nt|stiffqueen: i suspect east is saying i have both majors so we are getting to game....|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|stiffqueen: well i say you know your a senior when you play 16 boards for less than an imp a board|pg||
nt|penseur9: I would suspect that the last round would start in about 15 minutes after the end of this one and tharefore earlier then scheduled|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we finiished in OR quite a while ago|pg||
nt|penseur9: from the schedule it would be some 30 minutes but I'd wager that 15 minutes will be about right|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|penseur9: the next sestion scheduled to start in about 90 minutes BUT, might be advanced a little so stay tuned|pg||
nt|chick: goodnight from the US :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: sesion I beleive|pg||
nt|henryb:  they played this set very quickly. Under 2 hours at both tables|pg||

pc|d3|nt|stiffqueen: this is 11 tricks without the ace of diamonds lead|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|penseur9: ok final score 103 Hoffman and 105 Prescott|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: both sides at times have been looking to race away only to be pegged back|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they will all need to be at their best for the last 16|pg||
nt|penseur9: I know some of you have a favorite team in mind and I wish all the best but I think both teams deserves a big round of applause|pg||
