nt|sybarra: unless I had a 2 suited bid in the first round I would have passed |pg||

nt|benjent: vulnerability and strength|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "virtually" ... that's my escape clause for not bidding this South hand|pg||
nt|benjent: And yet you've been testing the lower boundaries of 1-level overcalls so enthusiastically :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the delayed 1@S bid is, IMHO, worst of all|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H!|nt|benjent: EW play transfers after their 1@c opening - so 1@d shows @h, and @h shows a minimum balancedish hand with 3@h|pg||

nt|penseur9: 5@H 2 aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: I agree with Bill about the delayed 1@s. Maximising your risk, minimising your gain. Either do it off the bat, or run silent|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|penseur9: right Shirley|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Just further on that point about the delayed overcall ... if you overcall 1@C with 1@S, at least you've done a little bit of preempting of the opps|pg||
nt|benjent: Picked up his imp on the opening lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But doing it on the second round is futile ... they've already exchanged information, you are not preempting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Instead, you just give them distributional help in the play|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: What Neil was trying to do with his delayed overcall is make his partner aware that he was weak, but still keep open the possibility of a spade sacrifice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so it was not a clearcut bad strategy, I just happen to disagree with it|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||

pc|hA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, and really the chance of your side accurately determining a successful spade sacrifice is low|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Declarer will need to do some good guessing in @S/@D to make this|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|benjent: Probably should have cashed his @cA first|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nope ... he plays declarer's guess for him, and  declarer will pick up the spades|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hmm, entries to hand are getting a little tight here ... surely declarer unblocked a club honour from dummy there|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Hoffman played a heart instead of his club|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Undo then?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: penalty card|pg||
nt|benjent: He has a pretty fair idea of East's hand. After @d7, East surely had @DAJx. With no spades, West might have had enough to try for a @s ruff|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: vugraph wont let me revoke|pg||
nt|benjent: So it's quite reasonable to guesstimate that East has a singleton @s honour, and play accordingly|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: But if East has singleton SMALL (which is more likely a priori) you need to double-finesse the spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Also two small with East (eg 2722 shape)|pg||
nt|benjent: No, I think he assumes East has the A and J of @d - and the 8 he already played, so that's a 1732|pg||
