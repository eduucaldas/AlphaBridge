nt|super nova: odds somewhere around 20 to 1. |pg||
nt|fugitiv: not the contracts you would expect from that board|pg||
nt|mwigor: so it is 8-0 to hoffman|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|mwigor: Chan and Lusk made 990 on this board (6NT)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|nigel: Not tough to reach 6NT combined 32 count plus two 5 card suits but looks like they missed it|pg||
nt|mwigor: slam is reasonable - it requires two finesses out of 3 - which is 50% - plus they might give up a trick on the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|fugitiv: mmm a 1nt opening would have worked well|pg||

pc|dT|nt|mwigor: sorry miscounted tricks|pg||
nt|fugitiv: if the club finesse wins you're home|pg||
nt|mwigor: one finesse is enough|pg||
nt|nigel: I think Rutkowski (that a mouthful) should have gone via 4th suit to show some extras|pg||
nt|mwigor: so its one out of 3 but you cant take them all|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||

nt|nigel: I imagine 2D being a positive, and now a forward going aution to 6@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|mwigor: slam is slightly better than 50% i think - they might lead @DA for a start (so long as you havent tipped them off about the void)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|fugitiv: or the 5d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mwigor: rutkowski chose to show his void as a keycard|pg||
pc|d7|nt|nigel: Seems it turned into an awkward auction wher 2D was a waiting move then Mark cught up in quick time. Can't blame Brightling but why be greedy|pg||
nt|mwigor: this doesnt always work - but here it will gain him 13 imps|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|h4|pg||

nt|fugitiv: didn't he show 2 with the q|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nigel: I don't think Rutkowski showed a void as an ace rather 5S to show  2 key cards and the trump queen|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mwigor: sorry you're right|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|fugitiv: my question is what suit does the double ask for :p|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bebechira: 5hw+1 in the closed room|pg||
nt|fugitiv: maybe he wanted a diamond lead|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s6|nt|mwigor: so marks' 4NT was ill advised she was committing to slam off two keycards|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|fugitiv: indeed|pg||

nt|mwigor: so now 19-14 to hoffman|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel: E/W could easily get overboard here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|mwigor: even 3@s is too high isnt it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel: I  prefer a Bergen 3@s and then a disciplined pass by East, Not sure why Hffman wants to climb into this auction with East unkown|pg||
nt|nigel: Surley Marks is worth a redouble|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mwigor: agree completely nigel|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|fugitiv: n/s make 3c so bidding 3s isn't a disaster|pg||
nt|mwigor: the other room played 4@s down two|pg||
nt|fugitiv: would be more tempted to double 3c, but i'm often tempted |pg||
mb|3S|nt|fugitiv: i guess you can beat 3c with 4 rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|mwigor: i would prefer to have redoubled 2@s now - i can let partner double them|pg||
nt|nigel: Brightling bidding 2NT as natural Hoffman taking it as pick a minor. I play 2NJT as pick a minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|nigel: So 3@s -1 a good result, with 3@c a likely make|pg||

nt|mwigor: a spectator asks: would you open the east hand?|pg||
nt|nigel: Opposite a passed hand I would wimp out and double rather than overcall 1NT|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|fugitiv: i like pass 2nd seat vul|pg||
nt|mwigor: personally i would - but i have a method to show a bad weak two|pg||
nt|mwigor: i agree with pass if i only have one weak two available|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel: I think pass is normal vul but if the spade queen was in heart queen then probably|pg||
nt|super nova: Yes I have a method to show the 0-5, 6-7 and 8-9 weak 2.|pg||
nt|mwigor: i would only open it if i was playing 2@d as 3-7 multi and 2@h as 8-11|pg||
nt|super nova: After 2d 2nd,.. 3h = 0-5|pg||
nt|super nova: 2d 2nt ,.. 3c = 6-9|pg||
nt|nigel: Surley risky vul with such a crappy hand|pg||
nt|nigel: no matter what your methods|pg||
nt|mwigor: 98765 are at least solid ;)|pg||
nt|super nova: after 2d 2nt,.. 3c (6-9) then 3d asks and 3h says I have the 6-7 ,.. and anything else is the 8-9|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fugitiv: yeah the qx spades is a turn off|pg||
nt|nigel: Even if your methods allowed it I would be surprised if Gos would open the East hand|pg||
