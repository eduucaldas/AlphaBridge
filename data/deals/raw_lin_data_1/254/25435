mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3H|an|nat inv|mb|d|nt|djneill:  North's hand is so freaky, it is better to open 1@s than 2@c - (a) hard to describe starting with 2@c, and (b) opps will not Pass out with such freaky distribution|pg||
nt|djneill:  hmm, now maybe if North bids 4@d that is cue for @h|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|djneill:  North does not believe so|pg||
nt|jbgood: neither does East...|pg||
nt|djneill:  sometimes, the bidding develops so that certain suits should not ever be trumps, like here, maybe over 3@h, @c/@d should never be considered as trump suits|pg||
