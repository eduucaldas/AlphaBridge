mb|p|mb|2N|an| |mb|p|nt|Psyck: I don't know why E did not cue 4@h on 4@d other room, but they sure knew what they were doing & got to a good slam|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT   must be in their system|pg||
nt|ady: some prefer 4 card support for a splinter  even though 5+ promised with west|pg||
nt|Psyck: ok, i saw wrong, 4@s was certainly correct on 4@d|pg||
nt|Psyck: let's see if EW here do as well in the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: Whenever Robson thinks he always looks like he can't remember the system :-)|pg||
