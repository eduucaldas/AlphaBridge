nt|Henryb:  The @dQ was not best on the layout|pg||
mb|1D!|an|10-15, 0+d|nt|Henryb:  N-S can make 6@d with the favorable @dK|pg||
mb|p|nt|Henryb:  Missed the @s ruff|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu:  but missing 2 keycards :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Henryb:  so only 5@d or 4NT|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu:  NSA: strong @C so 1@D can be short in @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|Henryb:  Not overcalling 1@s is unusual in this day and age|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|pelu:  more that unusual - for me a mistake|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  hello all|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Henryb:  not bidding with West's 6-5 is also perhaps unusual|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  5D seems hasty. why not splinter with 4H? perhaps that would have been Redwood?|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: it's because "small federation" is defined by the membership numbers of National Organization|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  you are well informed as always, Henry|pg||
nt|Henryb:  7-6 pick up sticks?|pg||
nt|pelu:  what a Michael in CR|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S!|mb|d|nt|marlowepi:  i ma not keen on michaels here|pg||
nt|pelu:  4@S now will send S overboard - but the hand is only to 3@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i would be bdding my long suit, then my short suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzbp: N explained 5+H 5+C|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but i admit i have seen michaels bids made on less suitable hands than this one :)|pg||
nt|Henryb:  X would not be my call: that should be imo cards and a desire to double at least one of the Michaels bidder's suits|pg||
nt|pelu:  and even better when the minor also is known|pg||
mb|2N!|an|11+|nt|pelu:  100% agree, Henry|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Henryb:  I think W should bid 3@s, showing a decent raise to 2@s|pg||
nt|Henryb:  3@h is available for a strong raise|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  even if 2S shows hearts and clubs, i dont think it is as good as the suit-then-other-suit plan. it is better only when you are not voluntarily going to the 5 level when opps bid 4S|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|nt|pelu:  let us be partners, henry - and I promise I will bid a little more than I use to :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but how many would sell to 4S after bidding 2S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  How many would sell under any circumstances?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|marlowepi:  right, so pretending that your clubs are at least as long as your hearts is very dangerous for 5-level purposes|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I think N should have bid 3@d, not 2N|pg||
nt|pelu:  what a D by West? he is lucky that @HJ is a trick and his partner has 2 @c-trick|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|c7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|pelu:  I also agree 2!Â§s|pg||
nt|pelu:  2@s|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|c8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I would bid 2@h, I admit|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  the 2S - then - 5H performance by S here would seem to strengthen my argument that 2S is not the best call|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i like 2H also|pg||
nt|pelu:  when u can show @h+@c I like 2@s|pg||
nt|pelu:  so u have to be partners :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbp: s explained 2s as unknown minor i think|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Well, if it went 1@s-2@h-2@s-3@d-4@s wouldn't you try 5@c, Marshall?|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|d3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|d4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but i dont have H + C. what i have is hearts, and also some clubs. a sequence that at least tries to put the length/strength disparity in proper perspective is superior, in my opinion, as long as you are always going to bid at the 5 level anyway|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h4|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: bid such slams?|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|zyxzewski: and yet another crazy hand straight from the oven :P|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: looks like a misunderstanding between N and S about the meaning of 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbq: a 4d is described by Thompson as natural|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: because i think facing a michael's cue N's normal action would be 3NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|zyxzewski: most likely game to make, but sure, South would go on to 4@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  It is usually wrong, in my experience, to show 2 suits when your higher ranking suit is longer|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2D!|an|7-10 with fit|mb|3C|nt|marlowepi:  yes i agree. the main possible exception is when: (a) the shorter suit is much stronger   (b) partner is likely to be on lead |pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|Henryb:  I wonder whether 2@d is a transfer advance or simply non-forcing|pg||
nt|Henryb:  looks like a transfer advance based on North's 3@h bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i don;t know, but it is dangerous to open 1H in 3rd seat on a nothing suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzbp: 7-10 with fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  whenever possible, strive for lead-direction when:  1) you are in 3rd chair    2) you are short in spades    c) you have little enough strength that opps may have a game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi:  here facing a passed hand and holding a stiff spade, i would treat my hearts as a 4-card suit. that is eccentric, of course, but a great man once said (probably had to say it many times, in fact) that the majority are usually wrong|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Henryb:  but here it looks like 1@h will work out fine unless E-W find their @d ruff|pg||
nt|pelu:  need a @d-lead to defeat|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|marlowepi:  meanwhile, we can note that the 1D opening that I recommended for N would in all probability have resulted in 5Dx by N, which is cold (as opposed to 4H)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|marlowepi:  nice to make 5Dx on 18 workinng HCP:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|Henryb:  If system compelled me to open 1@d I would not open|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  this N hand is perhaps nt everyone's 1D opener |pg||
nt|Henryb:  3N appeals to me now|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I see no reason to introduce @h|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  S is mildly worried about a makeable slam i think|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  seems less likely after East's auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  once E rebids the spades, he has extra length. still, W has not raised at favorable colors, so i agree with 3N|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi:  singleton in N hand unlikely|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi:  he must have heard you Henry. had to be you, since nobody ever pays attention to me:)|pg||
nt|Henryb:  this will make 660 with no finesses|pg||
nt|Henryb:  and 13 more imps to Ukraine|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|zyxzewski: and yet another 6-5|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|zyxzewski: probably 3NT is now the best bid|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: even if you find @H fit, it's highly probable that it won't be well divided|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: though this time East has indeed two of them and not void|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: indeed it would be very likly that w has 5c heart|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: North of course can still bid 3@S, which leads to 3NT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|zyxzewski: but i wouldn't fault him, if he decides to support with doubleton honour (which he just did)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|zyxzewski: as a kib pointed out, 3@S may be used to show @S stopper when 2 suits have been bid by opponents|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  but N instead opted for 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  S could certainly have bid differently also|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|marlowepi:  but the fatal call was 4H|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu:  S wopuld often only have 1 stop in @S - so 3NT only OK if 9 toptricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi:  you would be cold for 3N facing:  KQ  AKJTxx   Ax   xxx     but 4H could easily fail|pg||
nt|pelu:  wow a lead - almost the only lead to defeat (also @dK :):))|pg||
nt|Henryb:  South did well not to lead a minor suit|pg||
