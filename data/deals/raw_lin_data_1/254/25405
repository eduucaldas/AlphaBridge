nt|Walddk2: They can get this 1 down for the Kiss of Death|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Then declarer needs to guess spades to get out for down 1, and he should|pg||
nt|arvidsson: perhepes Cecila also played @H K to make it easy for partner ?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|arvidsson: instead of A ?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|s5|pc|d5|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||

mc|7|nt|arvidsson: if not 2@S by south what auction to take ? 2@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yeah, dump @SQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: not worth a jump to 3@H with Jxxx|pg||
nt|arvidsson: that lookes to be a good approach 1@S opening to left almost take away all that cards value|pg||
nt|arvidsson: taking the sound way would get to 2@H scoring 170 |pg||
nt|arvidsson: the agressie route let to a minus score of 100|pg||

nt|arvidsson: and this kind of opening tends to be more semi natural then natural (even unbal can occur)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nowadays 1NT should be alerted if it's balanced :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but I would still choose 1 @D before opening 1nt since @H could get out of the picture|pg||
