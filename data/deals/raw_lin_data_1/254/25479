nt|zyxzewski: as for the meaning of 4NT i can only guess, if it's a blackwood or invitational|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: maybe having 4-3-3-3 West could have blackwooded (or invited, if it was his intention) straight away, most likely there will be the same number of tricks both in suit and in NT|pg||
