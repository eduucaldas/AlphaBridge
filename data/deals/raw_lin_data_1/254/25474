nt|zyxzewski: good morning!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|zyxzewski: here one would expect NS to reach 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: which seems quite touch-and-go affair, especially if East manages to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: (not unreasonable here)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  expect 3N down on  the expected D lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  no percentage ub a spade lead when W couldnt overcall|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: he might choose a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: he touched diamonds but ...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|zyxzewski: he's holding 9 points, so W may have something in spades but overally too weak to overcall|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  well, EW are vul, and their ov ercall style is probably not as free-wheeling as in some places, but still it is asking a lot to lead a spade from a small douvbleton when you have 9 HCP yourself|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: running scores http://www.bridge.ee/festival/5SFG.htm|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: OK, as 1 minor wouldn't usually promise too much in clubs, he went for his own suit, but didn't work out too well|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  if NS play that 1D openers show five, then a club was not an unreasonable choice. certainlt unlucky here though|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|zyxzewski: i guess one of his problems was that Jxx in unbid suit is a very unappetizing combination to lead from|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi:  there are clearcut advantages in going through some systemic rigmarole after 1N when holding a hand like S has here ... but also some obvious disadvantages, such as helping the oppomnents on opening lead|pg||

pc|h7|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi:  yes in general it is, but it doesnt require as much from partner as a spade lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  you just need considerable diamond length with W and an entry or two|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  very plausible that W could have that, as overcalling 2 level vul is not the same as overcalling 1S|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  yes but E doesnt know that yet so he will squirm after the preempt|pg||
mb|d|nt|zyxzewski: most likely even 5@C if they manage to reach there|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  he will end in 4S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|zyxzewski: maybe in 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  W will bid 3H then he will bid 3S and W will raise|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: now 3@S - 4@H?|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: is it possible that 3@S here would be last train to 3NT?|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  3S showsspades|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  if W can bid 3N then fine|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: yes, sure, but would it be possible to have some hand with 4 spades?|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  as far as 4D goes, i don;t think it could be an improvement over 3S on tha actual E hand. personally i think it is needed to show a strong supporting hand for hearts that is too powerful just to raise to 4H.|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|zyxzewski: no i mean 4@D by West|pg||
mb|1S|nt|zyxzewski: instead of final pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but you COULD play it as a sort of "choice-of-games" cuebid. In that case, though, it should show 4315 (or maybe 4324) with nothing in diamonds  (and a monster of course)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  oh sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  misunderstood your intent|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|marlowepi:  same principle holds, though...if you use 4D inn that interesting way, maybe it should b ring clubs into the picture also, e.g. with 2524 |pg||
pc|sT|nt|zyxzewski: here probably West was a bit "compensating" for the last board, but the good point is, that her two spade honours are both "alive"|pg||
