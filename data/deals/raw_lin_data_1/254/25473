nt|zyxzewski: no idea, what they actually did|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|vugraphzbq: small chat between n-s|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|zyxzewski: or even so|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: 4-0 trump split is a nasty one - although sometimes it's preferable to 3-1 split, because it will be seen on first round of trumps|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: i think, it can be made double-dummy|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|zyxzewski: there is enough entries to dummy to finesse the @DA against trumps and also trumps themselves|pg||

nt|andyv:  if you put the A@c with the doubler, then a @c to 9 or J should secure the contract|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  in CR, W opened 2@c and N never get in the auction so W had a tougher problem (although I still feel that @c to J is better in those circumstances)|pg||
