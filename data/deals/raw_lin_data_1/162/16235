mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|mamos: yes   and its certainly not characteristic   they usually play very steadily|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  how many more boards? 16?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 64 altogether, 8 x 8|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 33 boards left|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Zia is somewhat squeezed now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HJ with the purpose of creating an entry to partner's hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer is cold: he just needs to make sure Zia wins the @hK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But I think unblocking the @C10 would have done that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: am I wrong?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So pitch @C10 instead of @HJ and I think it is down|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @c10 was his only play to beat the hand in fact|pg||
nt|henryb:  If Forrester finds the winning play it is a newspaper hand|pg||

pc|s9|nt|Walddk4: All natural but if Forrester had been inspired he could have played the ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: very ouch|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk4: again Zia needed to insert the 9 or 10|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Christine - Great Job! Our appreciation to BGB (Sandra Claridge) and the SBU (Peter Jordan) for ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Mike, Henry and Roland for their company plus wit and perceptive comments ...|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately is in south hand|pg||
nt|ewj: Forrester had opened 1NT, so he had no clue with the absence of 1@S overcall|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|mamos: the first sets had lots of swings so even if Allfrey were on the receiving end they had hope - the 30-0 scoreline on this set may have decided the match|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes against the main 4 of the gillis team -i think their task is well beyond them|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On 31, Hallberg got the same defence, 3 rounds of spades. On the 3rd, Robson pitched a low club. Then it was easy for Hallberg to duck a club into South|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 tricks and 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A club weas the correct discard, just not the low one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Much easier for us one has to add|pg||
