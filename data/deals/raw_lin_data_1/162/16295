mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: 4@H EW has a play|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: You must shut down|pg||
nt|iceking: north should respond here i think|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 4@H by East?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: why make it easy on oops passing |pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: 5@S    down 2  3 or 4 depending on how many diamond ruffs|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|chick: 4@C transfer to 4@H, similar to Texas but called South African transfer|pg||
nt|tomi2: system test for EW here, seems they are on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|tomi2: playing 4m as transfers to the suit 2 above allows east to decide who becomes declarer in 4M. he can either transfer or bid 4M himself|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not going to keep out east|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry i was delayed|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be interesting to know what 2@C was. seems it promised diamonds, else south cant bid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chick: that is more valuable over weak NTs than it is over strong ones|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Mike :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: Paul no dobt was hoping to get chance to show hearts later|pg||
nt|april7: only on @H lead possible but if Q is not covered then only 2 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D in Nightmare is either 11-21 unbalanced with diamonds or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|mcphee: both minor Q's lie well |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: hi level decisions here  I hate the Five Level!  I always seem to do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: both minor queens are on side as well as @hKQ, so an easy 3nt|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|april7: and after @C lead only 1 down possible!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|iceking: Garozzo will win this and play @C |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|chick: they will probably be ok here, down 3 is only 500 vs a vul game|pg||
nt|chick: but I think it is a very close call|pg||
nt|tomi2: nobodydoubled|pg||
nt|chick: oh, good point :)|pg||
nt|iceking: now best def is duck from S it looks like |pg||
nt|paulg:  frustrating when you hold all of your sides values|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: 1@C is 15+ any|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: was 4@h making  |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Garozzo has won more than any of us ever will |pg||
pc|hT|nt|chick: didn't even look, a double was so obvious :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: A@D  lead   2 from Lebel   surely club switch     then Q@H      that would be down 2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tomi2: why was it?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Not sure about the NT range, the Canadians played it as 11-14|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|mamos: id guess West expected East to do something|pg||
nt|chick: because they have a vul game they expect to make  (or maybe they didn't expect to)|pg||
nt|tomi2: they were not forced, west had @DA but no sure 2nd trick and @H fit|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

nt|iceking: been asked if east ducks @S now S can just win enter trump and always has later @C ace entry and will score 2@S and 2@D tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: they can in fact take also a @d ruff for -3, but 5@c is better|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of competition this hand too|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mcphee: probally not |pg||
nt|bessi2: looks like a normal 3n contract, question whether south will tip the club layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: or maybe not|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In German - mit fingerspitzgefühl:)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mcphee: you cut your finger?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why not 7@C or 7NT while we are at it ? :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  that looks a very strong 1NT, I wonder what the range is|pg||
nt|iceking: flat 4@S here making 12 tricks |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mamos: any guesses what 4@H shows|pg||
nt|mcphee: only you Roland:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that the players don't have the hand records|pg||
nt|daman: a pedestrian 4@S coming up|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: there goes the @s fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: maybe some kind of "last train"? a good hand but doubt to bid on?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Hurrah, we are linked|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Now our operator needs to enter scores on 1, 2 and 3 manually in MOVIE|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, take it back then. maybe a fake cuebid?|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. if that is a reverse 2@d bid, then west is surely heading for slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  less pedestrian if West leads the @dK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S 10 tricks with @D lead - but probably J@H lead|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|doctorone: N estimates that he is "too weak for a weak two" :)|pg||
nt|othered1: He estimates correctly :)|pg||
nt|doctorone: sure|pg||
nt|pelu: 10-12 - an the lead - @dK = 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: or not:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he should bid 4@C over 3NT|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@d cant have been a reverse then|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion 6@c is farbetter than 3nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: why no @H lead here is a surprise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mind you, you could easily go down in 6|pg||
nt|iceking: more chance w leads @D then east|pg||
nt|iceking: probably should lead @D king after this bidding|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk3: 2@S the limit on a diamond lead and a club switch, and even then declarer has to guess @SQ when the next diamond comes through|pg||
nt|tomi2: any reasonable lead will make this go down now. clubs => ruff, @H =>open a trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C no (no dbl by East) - @S no, of course - J@H with 4 @H in North can be dangerous|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bessi2: did he really lead a spade|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: so K@D seam to be the better lead (technically)|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: East shifted to third best from 6.  Wonder if that is their agreement|pg||

nt|iceking: would be silly though if decl had something like ATxx Txx 9xx AQx then only def to give it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but EW have a profitable save in 5@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C 2 down by E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: wasn´t 3nt from E a real underbid? on last board?|pg||
nt|tomi2: this @CK false card only works agains pairs who lead low from 96, else the small card would be the better one. South "might" think partner made some inspired lead from Kx. not ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: likely but the king made it easier for south to play for that ruff|pg||
mb|1H|nt|doctorone: Previous board, surprisingly, EW entered the bidding and did not locate their @h fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|doctorone: in other room I meant|pg||
mb|3H|nt|paulg:  if West doubles and North raises to the three-level, may lose the clubs|pg||

nt|daman: of course|pg||
nt|iceking: might stick in 3nt here or|pg||
nt|iceking: depends little what 3@H means |pg||
mb|3N|nt|tomi2: they play a limited system, he could not have more than this. maximum points, no wasted KQJ in @D and a 6th trump|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H is strange|pg||
nt|daman: good stuff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He won't buy it there anyway|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure about the 3rd spade, why not 3NT?|pg||

nt|mamos: and 6@S-1 led to a swing|pg||

nt|iceking: probably just natural |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt with 2 stop in @S is OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cards very well placed for a NT contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@H 1NT, West must give 2 stop in @S bidding 2Nt|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bigtrain: @HK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|iceking: yes 2@S and one each for just makeing|pg||

nt|ady: east tht worth a game try    |pg||
nt|ady: this should be way overboard|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes, 2@D is limkited to 15|pg||

nt|psridhar: decent slam ; i am sure they will get there, their slam bidding gr8 !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 16 or more, Garozzo would have bid 2@C, Gazzilli|pg||

pc|h3|pg||

nt|iceking: 2nt just correct on values |pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: had S opened @H would never get mentioned and 3N a likely landing spot|pg||
nt|iceking: would bid 2@S on hand like Axx x KJxxx Kxxx maybe|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ady: surely should not be 11 with the simple preference to 3@S?|pg||

pc|c7|nt|ady: 2@S|pg||

nt|bridge_one: QJ10x in @C and KQx in @S - 2Nt need ...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  with West's soft values and (hopefully) double spade stop, 2NT looks right|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: Nunes has so far shown ( i guess ) gf hand, @h, some clubs, and a slam try hand with his 3@s-unless some of those are artificial hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: artificial bids ( not hand sry)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see that he has set @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: surely that 1@s X=hearts Hedy? |pg||
nt|hedyg: you always have @H when you double 1@S?|pg||

nt|hedyg: sometimes i just dont have a natural call|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The trouble is that it doesn't matter what he does as they can take a club ruff|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|psridhar: maybe upto 3@c Nunes did not confirm @h fit but later the partnership has estblished H fit and tried for slam|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: seems like then passing 1@S wasn't so off the charts then|pg||
nt|psridhar: intra -finesse Position in @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: for one loser, play low club from hand to 6 spot in dummy and then later run the Queen pinning the 10 for one loser|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4 leading teams will play the semifinals at a later date|pg||
nt|psridhar: the intra finesse studied first by Chagas i believe|pg||

nt|iceking: ok this second dbl is no need for just gives them extra round for info|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H makes because North has no more than 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good pass by CIMA|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: East's auction is controlled by the lack of a weak 2, so sound.  In that context west is backing off because of the misfit.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Do they play Drury?|pg||

nt|hedyg: Nunes must have thought Roussel has either 6 @hs or at least AQxxx for his bid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: declarer has quite a lot of anxieties though|pg||
nt|bessi2: you can say that again.. if you dont have a convention for this sort of hand then just open 1@c|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting bidding is 3nt - 6@c and E is on the lead....|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: West choose to bid pass instead 3@H to give 3 cards in @D|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bigtrain: so far i'm not in danger of giving up a big club :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: if W bids 3@s, East can infer that his pd did not o/c over 3@D and pass may be , but in practise i doubt that will happen|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: though even then i am not sure one should cover|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jeff Sapire|pg||
nt|mamos: and is going off now|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|hedyg: hey Jeff :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3 looser in @D are many - if East was with 3@D they are 3 looser for sure - so 3@H by East|pg||

nt|ralfwil: agree Roland but interesting...|pg||

nt|ady: will east be tempted here|pg||
nt|bessi2: problem with a 6@c gamble is that east with ace or king of @h will lead there for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not fond of 3NT as a solid minor either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If NT is the spot, it's often wrong-sided|pg||
nt|daman: all roads lead to 3NT  EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ritong: taking into account the fact that interferences will occur less frequently when opps are vulnerable|pg||
nt|hedyg: he actually opened 3NT and bid 4@d over pd's 4@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or as Fred Gitelman says, only open 3NT if you do NOT want to play there|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@S is good for that hand type, transfer pre-empt|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: In other words, use it for something else|pg||
mb|2C|nt|doctorone: a good bad 2N would be welcome here, allowing W to bid a constructive 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: poor slam with 2 key cards missing    but could be made seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: defence would have five tricks then  i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: oh my, 3@D not my cup of tea here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psridhar: Nunes cannot open 1@d there ; his system requires stronger hand for that|pg||

mb|2N|nt|Walddk3: 5@D is fine|pg||

nt|chick: so the same|pg||
nt|mamos: difficult for South|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes ruff 3 @cs and ace drops for a @D discard|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk3: wd|pg||
nt|psridhar: and leading pd's suit is no sin|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: ruff 2 clubs   lose 1   first|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: sure|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer will likely draw 2 trumps and play on @C, hoping for some clues.|pg||
nt|paulg:  a double of 1@d by South would have led to a more interesting auction|pg||

nt|Walddk3: I assume Lamongie will do something spectacular soon|pg||
nt|doctorone: indeed, or 2@d|pg||
nt|ritong: highly unusual after an initial pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if e/w bid game  4@H should fail    3NT  looks to have some chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Will they get that high?|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   played by east   likely to fail to a club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice spots|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy 6@d can make here, but EW may be better off playing 3N here|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. but constructing a hand where declarer needs that @d discard is not easy given a normal 4@h bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s because 2@h is probably a constructive raise and he is not strong enough for that|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@C probably final contract here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcphee: even so Roland there is zero chance the N layer had any cards and @D continuation is pretty clear I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Italians are allowed to bid 1@s with the S hand :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cima should balance after 2@H pass pass|pg||
nt|iceking: yes |pg||
nt|pelu: do NS play 4 card @H-opening? - the normal bid in S would be 2@H not 1@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|vugraphztt: 1. kepri 109 2. djarum black 98 3. timah prima 1 96 4. djarum super 91 5. international 90 6. timah prima 2 82 7. well wise 81 8. wind runner 72|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 level overcalls can be very light|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially opposite a ph pd|pg||
nt|ady: on how e/w bid to 3NT earlier    may well bid game here|pg||
nt|tomi2: south had no bid here but 10 ppints... some play here  1@S as "TO with no 4 spades", this hand would fit perfectly fot this method|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes in partners suit but with no @d bid from S it´s easier to read|pg||
nt|iceking: and S will defend i would assume with all his values in @C|pg||
mb|d|nt|psridhar: W hand tempting though|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: N will support @d |pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2@S not enough in my view|pg||
nt|fann4: Surely 3N with 2 balanced hands and 28pts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: so would depîct the hand more accurately imho|pg||
nt|hedyg: no inverted minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: so @D fit was never shown|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Those black aces look good|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Partner came in vulnerable against not|pg||
nt|Walddk3: West has great cards|pg||
nt|fann4: At least 11 tricks on the expected @S lead.|pg||
nt|fann4: In fact, declarer will make 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|psridhar: i cant believe Laffineur chose not to support Diamonds !|pg||
nt|mcphee: why would E bid again?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl means to choose between @h and @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: this looks down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you dont lead it, you dont have it!|pg||
nt|mcphee: redble perhaps, but 1N lets them off the hook when vulnerable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many would overcall 2@D with Garozzo's cards. I think it's a clear pass|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphztt: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he did stop the @C lead......|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S made in the OR on bd 8, so a new leader.|pg||
nt|tomi2: this double now is dangerous, it should mean that he had no bid because of his good hearts the round before. North can see this can't be true with KQJ7 in his own hand|pg||
nt|mamos: yep South  just had to bid over 2@S  couldnt bear to pass|pg||
nt|iceking: clear pass agree|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: East must be really aggressive at other times if west sells to 3@D|pg||
pc|d7|nt|doctorone: would you try a 2@s (@s & a minor) opening as E if available in your system?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: they are not|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh reading it the wrong way|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|iceking: many here in europe though would respond 1NT with S hand not 1@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psridhar: 3 key cards, 5 card support and 15 hcp ...what more required to show that @d support i wonder|pg||

nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|fann4: The % to make 7 tricks is the same, playing 10 or Q, but you get an extra trick when Kx is onside, so that's the better play.|pg||

nt|tomi2: 2@C seems to be drury, east has a great hand now after finding the 2nd fit|pg||

nt|bridge_one: a michael's or a ghestem would be more easy here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in South|pg||
nt|othered1: south's hand is just barely in my Michaels range.  Still 3@C not easy to find.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: new suit at level 3 must be 5 cards - so pass by north now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am a bit lost, I would have thought 3@D shows that hand|pg||

nt|mamos: good contract|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psridhar: W should know that X asked for some lead other than @s|pg||
nt|mcphee: 7@D a little confusing lead for me|pg||
pc|hA|nt|doctorone: Would you all pass 2@c as W?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: boards 10 is typical in bridge competition - 8 cards in a major where the roght contract is 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: and @H just looked bad|pg||
nt|psridhar: but perhaps figured out his @d holding is such that a ruff is not going to help|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: this competion is at direct elimination - difficult with this hand produce a swing for Angelini|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: This is the first of 3 rounds, so it's far from over|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: but Buscaglia has certainly played very well|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now dbl|pg||
nt|reisig: Could happen|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd have bid 1@h with Garozzo's hand, perhaps it shows five hearts for them|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|mamos: though the defence to 4@S was poor and loks a swing back|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be they bid 1@H with 4 cards - in this case garozzo choose to pass to try to penalty opps|pg||
nt|reisig: Cima was hoping S had @d King|pg||
