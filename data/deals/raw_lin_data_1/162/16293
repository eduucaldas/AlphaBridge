mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ady: 1@H  may get passed out|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: 1@H= 14 + f1|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: can somebody help us with information about this event?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: never passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: agree! I prefer pass as N|pg||
nt|hedyg: even with 0 they must bid|pg||
nt|ady: Nunes decided hand woth a response|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did not decide, he cannot pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: systemic|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H is forcing|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Sigurbjörn|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: 14+  no limit, could have 29|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If 1@h is limites|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: or about this bidding :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ady: and then 2@C forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont know both pairs / their systems / carding, so if you can help, feel free to msg us|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: no|pg||

nt|hedyg: thuse f1|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: system not good for this hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2: ok, I have been told, that 16 teams qualified in loca selections and play a KO now, this reminds me exactly of the German Cup, its 100% the same here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Looks like N-S play Nightmare|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|tomi2: will we see Angelinis "star" players in the later rounds (if they win this match of course)?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: where 1@D can be 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shown by the rebid 1NT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: Oh I thought David meant 2@C opening|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcphee: should manage the game |pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Yes, 2@C is F1|pg||
nt|chick: whatever the bidding meant, they have ended in a very reasonable contract and will likely make it|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: meant 2@C rebid on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sorry, I misunderstood|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|tomi2: E-W play a strong club system, so 2@C was likely 5+@C 4M or 6+@C and opening strength, 2@D relay, rest natural|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tomi2: Angelini has hired players from Norway, or better say Monaco, for other events. Helness-Helgemo and Nunes-Fantoni is his strongest squad|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice play here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||

pc|hK|nt|ady: look like down 2|pg||
nt|tomi2: those 4 joined the NBO of Monaco together with another sponsor to represend Monaco in future European and World Championships|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was this a correct play with so few entries to dummy?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Or does anyone have a link to the system?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator needs to shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|tomi2: (3-1)45 is difficult to bid in all systems, you often have to lie in one card if you dont have reverse strength. you may open 1@D but that indicates more @D than @C, you may hide ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: your diamonds like here or treat the hand as a balanced one|pg||
nt|bessi2: better play to start @s jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT a good spot for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hope he speaks English|pg||
nt|Walddk4: My French is not adequate|pg||
nt|hedyg: i sent him a French message|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S makes life difficult|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: can anyone of you find an opening on E? I had opened 1@h|pg||
nt|ady: west facing a passed and has not automatic action|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: if west passes   east might take action|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But normal here is 3@c from W and 3@s from E|pg||
nt|ady: west decided to bid|pg||
nt|ady: east may ask for a spade stopper|pg||
nt|hedyg: normally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure what happened to the names now|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and 3nt is more easy now for E|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: There is an excellent article on exactly that problem by Steve Robinson (one of our frequent commentators) here:   http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202006-02.aspx|pg||
nt|tomi2: North misdefended the first one, he gave his opps a heart trick they would not make, if he had exited passively|pg||
nt|bessi2: I seriously dislike that 2@d bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is on a heart guess|pg||
nt|mcphee: bit of a thin over call it was:)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: 3@D  presumable shows 5 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And I agree with Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|bessi2: the last thing he wants is for pd to sacrifice to 5@d|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: does not 3NT on that bidding show a spade stopper?|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 4@s will be made if declarer can find @hQ...|pg||
nt|mcphee: this could work out very poorly if the @S game fails in the other room|pg||
pc|d4|nt|harmon: Here is link http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: I have already given it to my partner after 2nt|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fact, 4@S is cold as West can be endplayed to open up the heart suit, no?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Thanks Harmon|pg||
nt|mcphee: well they may even lead a @H|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mcphee: although a trump lead looks best|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in fact there is a play which can guarantee 4@s - before cleaning trumps play one round of @c|pg||

nt|gluckenval: con attacco @D 4@S erano al 100% con un finale di eliminazione e messa in presa, ma forse era automatico anche senza attacco favorevole senza ricorrere ad un antipatico impasse ...|pg||

nt|ady: 5@C on for e/w     on heart finesse     takes some bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a nice 5@c on EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf  for a 2005 version of Nightmare as played by a Canadian top pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Grainger-Lavee|pg||
nt|mcphee: both rooms overcalled in @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no D in OR! so only -150|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|chick: 4@H EW has a play|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: You must shut down|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@S    down 2  3 or 4 depending on how many diamond ruffs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: 4@C transfer to 4@H, similar to Texas but called South African transfer|pg||
nt|tomi2: system test for EW here, seems they are on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|tomi2: playing 4m as transfers to the suit 2 above allows east to decide who becomes declarer in 4M. he can either transfer or bid 4M himself|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: not going to keep out east|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry i was delayed|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be interesting to know what 2@C was. seems it promised diamonds, else south cant bid|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|chick: that is more valuable over weak NTs than it is over strong ones|pg||

nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|po-s: Paul no dobt was hoping to get chance to show hearts later|pg||
nt|april7: only on @H lead possible but if Q is not covered then only 2 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D in Nightmare is either 11-21 unbalanced with diamonds or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|mcphee: both minor Q's lie well |pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: hi level decisions here  I hate the Five Level!  I always seem to do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: both minor queens are on side as well as @hKQ, so an easy 3nt|pg||
pc|d7|nt|april7: and after @C lead only 1 down possible!|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: they will probably be ok here, down 3 is only 500 vs a vul game|pg||
nt|chick: but I think it is a very close call|pg||
nt|tomi2: nobodydoubled|pg||
nt|chick: oh, good point :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: 1@C is 15+ any|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mamos: was 4@h making  |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|chick: didn't even look, a double was so obvious :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: A@D  lead   2 from Lebel   surely club switch     then Q@H      that would be down 2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tomi2: why was it?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Not sure about the NT range, the Canadians played it as 11-14|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||

nt|chick: because they have a vul game they expect to make  (or maybe they didn't expect to)|pg||

nt|tomi2: to create a force, they would have started the bidding with an other bid. Bidding a game on shape does a) not mean you expect it to make and b) you are not sure to beat higher ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: contracts by the opps|pg||
nt|mcphee: slamming are we here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: they can in fact take also a @d ruff for -3, but 5@c is better|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: probally not |pg||
nt|bessi2: looks like a normal 3n contract, question whether south will tip the club layout|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|mamos: any guesses what 4@H shows|pg||
nt|mcphee: only you Roland:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: there goes the @s fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the slam|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tomi2: maybe some kind of "last train"? a good hand but doubt to bid on?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hurrah, we are linked|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Now our operator needs to enter scores on 1, 2 and 3 manually in MOVIE|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, take it back then. maybe a fake cuebid?|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. if that is a reverse 2@d bid, then west is surely heading for slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|doctorone: N estimates that he is "too weak for a weak two" :)|pg||
nt|othered1: He estimates correctly :)|pg||
nt|doctorone: sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: or not:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he should bid 4@C over 3NT|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@d cant have been a reverse then|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion 6@c is farbetter than 3nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes agree|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcphee: why no @H lead here is a surprise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mind you, you could easily go down in 6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk3: 2@S the limit on a diamond lead and a club switch, and even then declarer has to guess @SQ when the next diamond comes through|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: seems like then passing 1@S wasn't so off the charts then|pg||
nt|psridhar: intra -finesse Position in @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: for one loser, play low club from hand to 6 spot in dummy and then later run the Queen pinning the 10 for one loser|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4 leading teams will play the semifinals at a later date|pg||
nt|psridhar: the intra finesse studied first by Chagas i believe|pg||
nt|psridhar: but then 3@H is hopeless, 3@s works -how to get there after 3@d opg?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: East's auction is controlled by the lack of a weak 2, so sound.  In that context west is backing off because of the misfit.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Do they play Drury?|pg||
nt|doctorone: yes but with fit |pg||
nt|ritong: very probably|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: lamongie might try 2NT at his next turn|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I assume Lamongie will do something spectacular soon|pg||
nt|doctorone: indeed, or 2@d|pg||
nt|ritong: highly unusual after an initial pass|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: if e/w bid game  4@H should fail    3NT  looks to have some chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Will they get that high?|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   played by east   likely to fail to a club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice spots|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy 6@d can make here, but EW may be better off playing 3N here|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. but constructing a hand where declarer needs that @d discard is not easy given a normal 4@h bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: even so Roland there is zero chance the N layer had any cards and @D continuation is pretty clear I think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: Italians are allowed to bid 1@s with the S hand :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphztt: 1. kepri 109 2. djarum black 98 3. timah prima 1 96 4. djarum super 91 5. international 90 6. timah prima 2 82 7. well wise 81 8. wind runner 72|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 level overcalls can be very light|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially opposite a ph pd|pg||
nt|ady: on how e/w bid to 3NT earlier    may well bid game here|pg||
nt|tomi2: south had no bid here but 10 ppints... some play here  1@S as "TO with no 4 spades", this hand would fit perfectly fot this method|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes in partners suit but with no @d bid from S it´s easier to read|pg||
mb|d|nt|psridhar: W hand tempting though|pg||
mb|1N|nt|doctorone: N will support @d |pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2@S not enough in my view|pg||
nt|fann4: Surely 3N with 2 balanced hands and 28pts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: so would depîct the hand more accurately imho|pg||
nt|hedyg: no inverted minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: so @D fit was never shown|pg||
nt|psridhar: opposite 1@D opg that West hand looks tempting to me for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Those black aces look good|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Partner came in vulnerable against not|pg||
nt|Walddk3: West has great cards|pg||
nt|fann4: At least 11 tricks on the expected @S lead.|pg||
nt|fann4: In fact, declarer will make 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|psridhar: i cant believe Laffineur chose not to support Diamonds !|pg||
nt|mcphee: why would E bid again?|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|ady: this looks down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you dont lead it, you dont have it!|pg||
nt|mcphee: redble perhaps, but 1N lets them off the hook when vulnerable|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphztt: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he did stop the @C lead......|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S made in the OR on bd 8, so a new leader.|pg||
nt|tomi2: this double now is dangerous, it should mean that he had no bid because of his good hearts the round before. North can see this can't be true with KQJ7 in his own hand|pg||
nt|mamos: yep South  just had to bid over 2@S  couldnt bear to pass|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: East must be really aggressive at other times if west sells to 3@D|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|doctorone: would you try a 2@s (@s & a minor) opening as E if available in your system?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: they are not|pg||

nt|hedyg: great convention :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: if south had covered the first one, they could play two more rounds of trumps, when they gained the lead back. this way they played only 2 rounds of spades in the defense|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Letting 4@H through on 24 cost 10 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: Interesting. E may have a "slight" bidding problem over 1@d 1@s here, as double would show 4 @hs|pg||

nt|hedyg: E had denied so much as 10 hcps or a good 9 by not bidding drury|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you are in slam here you must choose 6@S rather than 6@D|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|po-s: maybe "should"|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos: all roads lead to 3NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: and Q@D protecting form being tapped out as well|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Can you make 3NT on a heart lead?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: this is an easy 450 for Fantoni |pg||
nt|tomi2: playing south for Hx in @D seems a good chance. you lwad J now and if its covered you win the ace and play towards the 10. if not, you lose to north and you can play the ace later ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: hoping to pin the other honor|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||

nt|figb_rama: nel risultato del 1° tempo di questo incontro c'è stata una correzione successiva all'inizio del 2° tempo su Bbo|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||

nt|figb_rama: attualmente Pauncz conduce 52-33|pg||

nt|doctorone: There are cases for a 2@c rebid in SEF with 3 only, where u have @s in a balanced hand 15-17|pg||

nt|hedyg: last board of this segment now|pg||
nt|hedyg: Thanks to our excellent operator in Paris, Quentin! To my talented co-commentators David Edwin, Ralf Willquist and of course Roland Wald for donating their time to guide us through ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: these boards !Finally thanks to the Federation Francaise de Bridge for their support, especially to Claude Dadoun  who was instrumental in organising these broadcasts |pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1NT  contract for n/s|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 42 minutes|pg||
nt|jkotor: to avoid guess when 3-1, normal play is A@s first :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|othered1: how  many @S with north?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: they have 25 HCP here , but what game can they make? 4@h?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: zero|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|fann4: The % to make 7 tricks is the same, playing 10 or Q, but you get an extra trick when Kx is onside, so that's the better play.|pg||
nt|jkotor: sorry, i ve somehow seen xx trumps in dummy :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: Roudinesco says play ace|pg||
nt|mcphee: hmmm would not have thought of 1N|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: bingo|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Passing is a crime|pg||
nt|doctorone: 2@s by N seems enough given his lack of distribution|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: how about 5@c |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C seems to be drury, east has a great hand now after finding the 2nd fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: I am a bit lost, I would have thought 3@D shows that hand|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|fann4: Ace first cannot be correct.|pg||
nt|jkotor: any difference between Q and T? (Q better when N stiff J, T when N stiff K)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk3: Don't we all want to take the 2 level away from the opponents?|pg||
nt|othered1: West is really conservative here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: no plus score here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, for E-W|pg||
nt|ralfwil: suicide....|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|ritong: pham plays weird today  maybe the spotlights are in cause|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Has to guess which suit breaks 3-3 for his 7th trick|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and misguessed|pg||
nt|hedyg: @cs looked a LOTTTTTTTT better than @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could easily go more than 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: although he can take 8 tricks with all cards in view|pg||
nt|mcphee: i predict he will |pg||
pc|d9|nt|psridhar: thats a lead director |pg||
nt|psridhar: but unlikely to beat|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: i was looking at the wrong hand sry, only 6 cards|pg||
nt|mamos: good contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psridhar: W should know that X asked for some lead other than @s|pg||
nt|mcphee: 7@D a little confusing lead for me|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|doctorone: Would you all pass 2@c as W?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: and @H just looked bad|pg||
nt|psridhar: but perhaps figured out his @d holding is such that a ruff is not going to help|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: similar lead director X in other room fetched an OT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Not moi|pg||
nt|othered1: No, since game possbilities are still live|pg||
nt|doctorone: ouff :)|pg||
nt|ady: Nunes playing for 3-3 club or doubleton honor    but not joy|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk3: But he got one more chance. He could have doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: on winning ace E had to tap out a trump from dummy with a @s to stop the OT here|pg||
nt|psridhar: playing a @h is too hopeful|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fantoni had 11 always , now poised to make 12|pg||
nt|hedyg: are you sure of the overtrick?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i'm not|pg||
nt|fann4: But still 1imp to LAFF it seems.|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy i am sure ...and usually Fantoni plays double dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: still uptrick on a spade return|pg||
pc|h6|nt|doctorone: maybe a second double over 2@s now ?|pg||
