mb|d|mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: 1NT is funny|pg||
nt|henryb:  and Allfrey did not pick up; but surprising that he did not double 2@s|pg||
nt|ewj: Presumably double would be take out|pg||
nt|ewj: Strange that he didn't double 2@C though|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nothing is strange when you are 81 behind with 8 to go|pg||
nt|henryb:  what's the difference between doubling 2@c and then 2@s and passing then doubling 2@s?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ewj: Well I don;'t know their system, but presumably doubling 2@C would show some strength and then a subsequent double would be penalty|pg||
nt|henryb:  Isn't that what North has?|pg||
nt|ewj: Well yes, hence my comment about the lack of double of 2@C being strange|pg||
nt|ewj: Some people play double of 2@C as take out of @C, implying interest in penalising the majors...|pg||
nt|ewj: and although he isn't short of@C, he is interested in penalising the majors, so could have doubled anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: Can make this now by winning in dummy|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then a club finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The second spade was costly|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|henryb:  perhaps of 2@c double sets up a cooperative situation while Pass, then double is unilateral penalty|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ewj: Yeh, perhaps but almost certainly not|pg||
nt|ewj: else he would have doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SA, 3 rounds of clubs, heart, 790|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he is going 2 down I think|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
