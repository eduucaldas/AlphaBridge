nt|Vugraphzfb: Hamman commented that 5@c wasn't very good - it was -1 after the diamond worked :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I believe this is the final session of this years league which was won last year by the Dunn team|pg||
mb|1N|an|11-14|nt|caitlin: so close to a slam but @DK offside|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: How does it stand now?|pg||
nt|chick: this is round 9, how many more?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for standings before the last round|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: Last round now|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think Dunn is favourite|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: this is a final round|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Will take a miracle to deny Dunn|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 16 VPs ahead, on a 20-0 scale|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = game forcing|pg||
nt|caitlin: now I play once a 2/1 3@C does NOT show extras|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sccerri a fine and aggressive player always a front runner in UK events.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia has the 4@h card out but hasn't actually put it on the tray yet - sort of thinking about it|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to poll Caitlin and Jan -- do you use 2@H or 2N as the catchall rebid|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|caitlin: if you don't play the way I do (and many don't) N has to rebid a five card major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I have a friend who has been experimenting with a flip-flop where 2@H=catchall and 2N=6+@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hamman explains that 4@h is sort of a picture bid; Zia says "it's a medium slam try" Hamman: "he should have about 20 HCPs and a void in hearts"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|caitlin: lol!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Your son on E Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Hamman asks about the J lead - I think David says just standard|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: later in the week when scoring is BAM  Hamman line probably very different from what we'll see tonight|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I always think you can learn a lot by trying to figure out what an expert like Hamman is thinking about - what things is he worrying about or planning for or??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you're trying to compare results from the Lynch-Dovell match   Don't Bother   we're playing a different set of boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Looks like 5 hearts, 2 clubs, 1 spade and at least 1 diamond - is he deciding whether to go for diamonds splitting or hook the ten (after all, most W's would duck the K with the Ax ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: or Axx, but couldn't with stiff A)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, the room is too small to play the same boards in all the matches. Tomorrow we'll have the same boards in both semi-final matches|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: also thinking about 4-1 trump splits vs 3-2|pg||

nt|lestergold: as it may get lost otherwise|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: Many splinters take you to 4 level  1H-4D  but 1H-4S  goes ABOVE hearts so 1H-3S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C5 vs @C3    Hamman probably not watching the spots, so it doesn't matter :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: This hand was played from the other side at the other table because Rubin-Ekeblad play 4 card Majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: good auction but i expect it to ne reached in open|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but many have redefined 2@C as natural OR game forcing balanced hand|pg||
