pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think maybe 2@D over the double to show a fit raise is better than redouble because I do not think west has ever shown 4 card support here|pg||

nt|roswolf: to lose another 6 imps|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one problem for West is that if 1@c is short 2@C may be natural rather than a cue-bid raise  |pg||

mb|1S!|nt|Walddk2: If you know the layout you can even make an overtrick I think, David. I am referring to board 13|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s values with 0-3@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|tomi2: 1@D already showed real dias, yes?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|jallerton: Yes, usually 5!+d or 4441|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5+@d or 4441|pg||
nt|jtr: This would be more fun if the vulnerability was reversed|pg||
nt|jtr: But 5@d here would put a lot of pressure on Halberg|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not sure i go along with the 3 spade bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: would have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..assuming I passed first time...|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4S|nt|jallerton: I am told that N/S may even open 1@C on 4441 shapes, so 1@d really is 5+|pg||
nt|jtr: A one-level splinter is new to me:)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, all East's high cards are working, even his ten|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jtr: North not sure whether to double or bid the vulnerable game|pg||

pc|cK|nt|garnetts: 5@C looks abvious because you have no defence --and at least it offers partner a choice of lead if they go on --but might be a slam try|pg||

pc|dT|nt|jtr: Best lead and declarer will think he has problems|pg||
nt|jtr: Not knowing that the black suits are so favourable|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, partner has not overcalled in @s so his mist likely 5-card suit is @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: *most|pg||
nt|tomi2: but he also knows that partner has nearly no poits, so he might even have 5 spades but no bid...|pg||
