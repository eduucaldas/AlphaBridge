nt|vugraphzug: hi all and welcome to the 4th Stanza of the Gold Cup Final between Stevens and Gillis|pg||
nt|rhelle: you could argue that 4@h is a bit much ... maybe 3@h is a better description|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: But not a straightforward contract to play|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@h is probably stronger|pg||
nt|jtr: Should be forcing after a 2-level response|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think he can make it even if he guesses diamonds|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: Looks like 4 losers unless something strange happens|pg||
pc|sK|nt|delberto:  I'm not certain of their agreements...I suspect 3H would be invitational|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rhelle: that is what I remember from Friday|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah  That went out 30 years ago|pg||
nt|delberto:  Jim usually plays quite traditional methods|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's a 3-2 @H break and the @d guess - not unreasonable for a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|jtr: Before Happer was born though:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 2@C is not game-forcing, how do you invite with 3 hearts if not 3@H, David?|pg||
nt|rhelle: from an entry perspective, it looks like @d to the Q, 3 rounds of trumps ending in dummy, and then a low @d to the 9|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That could be a doubleton|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@c would show 10+ anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: It could yes|pg||
nt|rhelle: a traditional method of a slam try in @h would be to bid 2@s first, and then 3@h|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|jtr: The trouble is that when you are very strong and cant bid 3@h forcing you have to go through the 4th suit and use up a lot of room|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agreed, that's why some of us prefer 2/1|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: But you'll get to 4@H regardless|pg||
nt|jtr: When i use to play Acolish everyone agreed that 3@h should be forcing|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not sure the aceless East should bid 4@h over a game try|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he has guessed the @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But then I would, as West, I am vulnerable|pg||
nt|rhelle: in the Cloesd Room EW are lucky to escape with -200; could easily be -500|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, all cards should be working even though you are aceless|pg||
