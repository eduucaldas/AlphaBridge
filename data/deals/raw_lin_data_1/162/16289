nt|subir_m: difficult to reach|pg||
nt|sunit: but the closed room pair have done well to reach there|pg||

nt|subir_m: south to take very strong action|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|kaustabh: y and the 1@D opening by S was initially passed by N|pg||

nt|vugraphzve: yes...declarer allowed 3rd @s and dropped @d|pg||

nt|sunit: ding dong, ding dong continues, fortunes fluctuating at a faster pace now|pg||
nt|panja: but with the Prec amorpohous 1@D opening..North actually has Clubs..and nothing in @D..so South's pass didn't hurt or seem to matter at all|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: from West's point of view......there could be a top trump missing.....E could have only 1 Spade..or even void...|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: and he needs to find out all beginning at a high level...3@C...so he took a practical decision to bid 5@C|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jtr: I prefer 1@s to double|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: oh yes|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt bidder usually should not have another bid all by herself..so 3@D here is a bit of a dadagiri|pg||
nt|panja: or didigiri...even|pg||
mb|p|nt|joemanjo: EW have enough firepower to reach 4@H despite roadblocks by opps|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|panja: good lead...|pg||
nt|panja: best to lead your long side suit if you have trump length|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Can they avoid the disaster from the closed room?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: open room rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|joemanjo: Rajesh is now considering how high he should aim. Slam is also a possibility from his point of view with no diamond wastage.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: They need the 17 IMPs badly|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: 16 now as they play in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the difference is 12 IMPs going into the last 14 boards|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|tlc: Hi again everyone|pg||
nt|sunit: 6cl is a lucky make on a spade lead, interchange the club ace and it is down|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rmb1: +1 in CR was impressive|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi Jim|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jtr: Low @d lead from South|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW are not known to be shy bidders by any means here we go:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzvg: ................|pg||
nt|joemanjo: yes, it will take time |pg||
nt|joemanjo: With Prabhakar as the declarer, one would be safe to bet on this one.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvg: still ..................|pg||
nt|joemanjo: South opened, North has one spade and one diamond honour|pg||
nt|joemanjo: chances are declarer ma pick up the trumps but ....|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|panja: she must take @H finesse just now..might lose that trick else|pg||

pc|s7|nt|joemanjo: Any hesitation from Ajay is a dead giveaway|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Right, maybe only 9 IMPs because CV Rao got a procedural penalty not recorded on the scoreboard|pg||

nt|kaustabh: probably I didn see him in recent tourneys|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: yes, Milind won Ahm Cavendish with Anand Samant couple of years back |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|sunit: 2009 feb|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: plays infrequently over the last 2-3 years and rarely in last year|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzve: 2@c was alerted|pg||
nt|rv: thanks Sunit, brain and heart behind Ahm Cavendish, hope he revives tourney|pg||

pc|h5|nt|rv: I predict this match to go down to the wire and decided in last few brds of 4th segment|pg||

nt|vugraphzve: Director on table|pg||
nt|kaustabh: why?|pg||
nt|vugraphzve: some confusion with previous session scoring|pg||
nt|vugraphzve: declarer playing 2@s but thoght he was palying 3@s and thgt down 2 .. actually it was 2@s one down..something like that|pg||
nt|vugraphzve: proably in second set .,,,|pg||
nt|rv: Jitu and Dipak playing for Poddar in CR also play precision, CV Rao pair in CR, Badal and Kachchu play 2/1 |pg||
nt|rv: CV Rao is a wonderful human being and is a great supporter of Indian bridge|pg||
nt|kaustabh: yes it was the last board in 2nd set ...Jitu was playing 2@S |pg||

nt|Walddk4: sorry, one more|pg||
nt|vugraphzvg: last deal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and this may well be a gain for CV Rao|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: on B28...6@D seems like a good spot|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Both the Judgement of Tewari to shoot for the moon and Prabha with his sparkling card reading. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|panja: preempted out of constructive bidding now|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: the best Satya can do is to raise to 4Nt..but that is also a bit risky..|pg||
mb|1H|nt|panja: this 3N could be quite a wide range...even 16 at times|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|tlc: any 1NT openers here with west?|pg||

nt|jtr: @s switch now at the other table|pg||
nt|jtr: We are in England, the home of the weak NT:)|pg||
nt|panja: play @H to @H9..no harm here...could even be a good play to secure 4 heart tricks..|pg||
nt|sunit: correctly played 4sp can make|pg||
nt|sunit: without touching trumps pitch a dia on the club jack and play a dia|pg||
