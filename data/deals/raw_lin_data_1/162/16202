nt|ahollan1: but same contract in other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: and  a push |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes but here, Wold stole Helgemo's bid|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: So that lead-directing overcall worked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want team rosters [and carryover at start of day]  check out bottom of http://www.acbl.org/nabc/results/2010/03/4/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: teams have decimal totals because of carryover calculated from Day 1 and Day 2  [field cut each day]|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Some specs were suggesting 1)That S might have opened 2N  or 2) over 3@s, South might haved Xed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bridgewinners site doesn't include results from last round/match of Reisinger/National Swiss prior to break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm trying to get those results|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: more problems -- they are playing a subsitute bd 4 here, so I don't have it.  I asked to have another pair of players but the directors said no.  in other words, the bd 4 at this ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: table is diff from the rest of the field|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: John tells Dan nice hand|pg||

pc|c6|pc|s9|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|3for3:  right.  even if 1@C could be 2, i;d think a raise to 2@c would be fairly safe|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: bypassing 3n here does seem very strange by Drijver|pg||
nt|3for3:  he could have backed in with 3@S over the double, as well|pg||
nt|3for3:  i am told 2@C would be a transfer, so that wasnt possible|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: whats wrong with 2N showing a spae stop and some values?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: i mean opposite the double|pg||
nt|3for3:  porbably a scramble|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: so they are victims of their own complex bidding system here where a pair of club palookas would reach 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: so a tie|pg||
nt|3for3:  good round for ew, they will be disappointed with 2/3|pg||

nt|sybarra2: E is Michael's son  |pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this auction really?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: trick 2 was a club to N's King,  cashing diamond Q|pg||
nt|3for3:  different hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: then a low diamond ruffed with heart ten in dummy,  club pitch by south and jack by declarer|pg||

nt|lestergold: what is going on here?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|daman: good guess|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: that's Stayman spelled backward, but i think the convention was invented by Vic Mitchell|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: quite sure it was Mitchell invention |pg||
nt|ahollan1: slower auction in other room   Levin in 10@H North|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hm, Llehctim doesnt sound as interesting - or pronouncable|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: problem may not be with convention -- but the decision to use it|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: i bet Stansby would NOT open 4@D in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: a couple of minutes until rd 3|pg||
nt|daman: I always thought that you would not have an outside Ace when you tried Namyats|pg||
nt|me argent: conventions are there to be used and more importantly be abused|pg||
nt|daman: if partner had a red Ace and the @C King     it would be most unfortunate|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I think that w/Namyats, players can play it either way, the same sort of thing as in Michaels|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each partnership defines which holdings are valid for Namyats|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Michaels used to be reserved for either very weak or very strong hands, but now players use it for all distributiuoonal hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think George Rosenkranz write-up was probably the most restrictive|pg||
nt|me argent: i put namyats rgt up there with playing transfers when using the weak nt|pg||
nt|me argent: well maybe not as high|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I was incorrect about Board 5|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: The defense got a diamond ruff, so...|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Another win there for Rosenthal.|pg||
nt|me argent: cannot start next round until all teams finished |pg||
nt|me argent: hostage to slowest table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin-Weinstein went for 800 twice -- or was it 3 times |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the real problem is that players mill about and don't come to their table right away.  now 3 mins are already gone from the clock this round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told players DO get to compare with teammates between rounds -- what does panel think of this "barometer" type situation?|pg||
nt|daman: I think they got +800 and went for 800|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Kit|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :-) Hi Kit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes, they are comparing after each round as of now|pg||
nt|warrens:  they provide the barometer scoring until the last few rounds|pg||
nt|me argent: natural consequence of security|pg||

nt|me argent: thats called a patton done often in europe|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, it is usually a combination of point a board and imps|pg||
nt|ritong: one half of the score for the boards, the other for imps, roughly|pg||
nt|ritong: very tough to play|pg||
nt|me argent: most events hank are tough to play:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've never heard of Patton -- will need to look it up|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but this formula is extremely demanding in the diagnosis area|pg||
nt|ritong: as is pure BaM|pg||
nt|sybarra: I played Patton in Neth.  was great fun!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: seems a bit strange to me that they didn't stop allowing comparisons a round or two ago.  dont' they usually|pg||
