nt|rv: a few pairs play suction or inverted suction (anthrax) against Strong @c, normally folks who play precision don't employ those methods against other strong @c players:)|pg||

nt|dslee: agree with rv on 3n|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: idea is it is not percentage to play natural 3n and it is important to tell partner whether you are only courtsey cueing or showing extras|pg||

nt|rv: here Milind's 4@s should show atleast card more than min 2/1 strength|pg||
