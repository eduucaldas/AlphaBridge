nt|roswolf: well i am suprised n/s havent pysched - imo they are rolling over too easily|pg||
nt|lestergold: another 'inevitable' disastrous game|pg||
nt|lestergold: to  be fair they have the piointsb this time|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: so probably will be flat|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: unlucky for EW |pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: i bet the auction will be more devilish in the other room|pg||
nt|mamos: yep another chance|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, 3 tens and a 5 card suit in south...|pg||
nt|roswolf: gillis gained 5 on bd5 by playing in 3nt-2|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos: what do you think this double of 2@d  showed Geoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamonds!? certainly not a 3 suiter with short hearts|pg||
nt|mamos: and where would Ns have played if Andy had rdbled|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: now that is a really good question !!:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C probably|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: no joy in the minors|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mamos: how did 4@h make ?   it just doesnt seem likely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2 rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: then the contract is makeable and Björnlund took full advantage|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: hmm the zia factor|pg||
nt|mamos: ah yes c!AK  looks like some sort of carding accident|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mamos: yes   Board 5 looks a real steal in the OR for the Gillis team  - dont understand North's actions|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: this should be easily off|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: North failed to bid 4 hearts as Burn did here (clear in my view)|pg||
nt|mamos: i agree|pg||
