mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|ewj: They're not the sort of players I would expect to be nervous, "seasoned" campaingers etc|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ewj: 2@D probably a weak jump shift in either major?|pg||
nt|ewj: and 2@S shows a raise to 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzuf: yes....multi style|pg||
nt|ewj: if partner has @H...|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mamos: yep some Zia toy|pg||
nt|roswolf: a gadget struck|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: cards lie remarkably well for NS here, although 3N can still be beaten|pg||
nt|roswolf: this does have some play - not much -but some|pg||
nt|mamos: not an easy lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pjs_ch: the defence need to set up the 4th heart or the 4th diamond|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: or have declarer misguess inspades|pg||
nt|mamos: this gives declarer the tempo|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice lead Jxxx is never an attractive lead|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: this looks like a "second best from bad suit"  |pg||
nt|pjs_ch: key now will be forcing declarer to a spade guess|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: this will be nip and tuck|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: the run of the clubs would place max pressure on the defence|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: so what is the logic of Gillis playing the 3 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzug: Happer having a good think|pg||
nt|roswolf: he recognises this is a big hand|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: is that to deny an entry to the spades?|pg||
nt|ewj: Probably regretting rebidding 3@C|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer certainly can make now and it seems normal to run Clubs  - wasnt that Harrison-Gray's advice|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think Gillis could work out what was happening in Hearts|pg||
nt|ewj: Yeh, a good duck though|pg||
nt|dburn: he will imagine that Hallberg has 9542|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|s6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|pjs_ch: curious balance here in discarding between helping partner and helping declarer|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: most people tend to be honest IMHO|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes not the best policy in bridge though|pg||
nt|mamos: Gunnar has two more discards to make as well  not pleasant|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: Gunnar can give up his hearts, I would hope - not sure what the @S3 tells Gillis|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: east is showing his discomfiture -declarer will be confident now |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pjs_ch: looks like upside down attitude signals before but not sure about discards|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: I can't see the fifth defensive trick any more|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: unless the fourth heart comes into play|pg||
nt|roswolf: east cant hold enough cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: black is 5he colour for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: East can throw spades without difficulty, obviously|pg||
nt|vugraphzug: Happer has his cards on the table, head in hand|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: difficult discard from dummy next - would have to be @DT? after which @SJ will make the game|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: but that allows oppo to get 3 diamond tricks and beat it that way|pg||
nt|dburn: but the defenders cannot establish West's long heart without allowing declarer to reach dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: he could play a spade now as the cards lie|pg||
nt|ewj: surely a @S is the obvious discard?|pg||
nt|ewj: what is the danger with that?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d5|nt|pjs_ch: now he can afford @DT|pg||
nt|ewj: Oh, I see defence could set up a @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spade is ok too|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|roswolf: nice|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ewj: Now he just has to hope the ace of @H is with East and voila|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the ball|pg||
nt|ewj: Bien joue|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pjs_ch: the discard of the @SQ seemed to leave declarer fewer losing options, clearly playing his partner for @SAJx|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@H seems normal now|pg||
nt|ewj: Mainly because of how quiet the boards were in fairness|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@s was possible|pg||
