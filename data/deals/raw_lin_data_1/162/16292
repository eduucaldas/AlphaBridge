nt|Walddk4: Sorry, I misunderstood|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s3|nt|tomi2: E-W play a strong club system, so 2@C was likely 5+@C 4M or 6+@C and opening strength, 2@D relay, rest natural|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|tomi2: Angelini has hired players from Norway, or better say Monaco, for other events. Helness-Helgemo and Nunes-Fantoni is his strongest squad|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator needs to shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|tomi2: (3-1)45 is difficult to bid in all systems, you often have to lie in one card if you dont have reverse strength. you may open 1@D but that indicates more @D than @C, you may hide ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: your diamonds like here or treat the hand as a balanced one|pg||

nt|tomi2: North misdefended the first one, he gave his opps a heart trick they would not make, if he had exited passively|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: 4@C transfer to 4@H, similar to Texas but called South African transfer|pg||
nt|tomi2: system test for EW here, seems they are on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|tomi2: playing 4m as transfers to the suit 2 above allows east to decide who becomes declarer in 4M. he can either transfer or bid 4M himself|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: not going to keep out east|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry i was delayed|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be interesting to know what 2@C was. seems it promised diamonds, else south cant bid|pg||

nt|fann4: The % to make 7 tricks is the same, playing 10 or Q, but you get an extra trick when Kx is onside, so that's the better play.|pg||
nt|jkotor: sorry, i ve somehow seen xx trumps in dummy :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: Roudinesco says play ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: bingo|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Passing is a crime|pg||
nt|doctorone: 2@s by N seems enough given his lack of distribution|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 2@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: how about 5@c |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C seems to be drury, east has a great hand now after finding the 2nd fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|fann4: Ace first cannot be correct.|pg||
nt|jkotor: any difference between Q and T? (Q better when N stiff J, T when N stiff K)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Don't we all want to take the 2 level away from the opponents?|pg||
nt|othered1: West is really conservative here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|ritong: pham plays weird today  maybe the spotlights are in cause|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Has to guess which suit breaks 3-3 for his 7th trick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: and misguessed|pg||
nt|hedyg: @cs looked a LOTTTTTTTT better than @d|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psridhar: thats a lead director |pg||
nt|psridhar: but unlikely to beat|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: i was looking at the wrong hand sry, only 6 cards|pg||
nt|mamos: good contract|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|psridhar: W should know that X asked for some lead other than @s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|doctorone: Would you all pass 2@c as W?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: and @H just looked bad|pg||
nt|psridhar: but perhaps figured out his @d holding is such that a ruff is not going to help|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: similar lead director X in other room fetched an OT|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk3: Not moi|pg||
nt|othered1: No, since game possbilities are still live|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|Walddk3: But he got one more chance. He could have doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: on winning ace E had to tap out a trump from dummy with a @s to stop the OT here|pg||
nt|psridhar: playing a @h is too hopeful|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fantoni had 11 always , now poised to make 12|pg||
nt|hedyg: are you sure of the overtrick?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i'm not|pg||
nt|fann4: But still 1imp to LAFF it seems.|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy i am sure ...and usually Fantoni plays double dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: still uptrick on a spade return|pg||
