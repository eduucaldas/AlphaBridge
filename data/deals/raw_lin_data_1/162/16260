nt|delberto:  but Zia did well to bid on over 2D|pg||
nt|ewj: Well he has a nice AJT8xx side suit|pg||
nt|ewj: Admittedly short in @D|pg||
nt|henryb:  I wonder what the right play is here. I know, from seeing all the cards that nothing actually matters, but I think it might be right to duck in both hands in case hearts are 5-2 and the @cK is offside|pg||
nt|delberto:  yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When I play West has J1097x and @CK, so ducking seems best|pg||
nt|ewj: but partner not having raised @H (which he might do with 6-3 in the reds, (and short @C)) is a good thing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am sure it's best to duck from both hands|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The diamond suit is also bringable homeable|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  When I play, Roland, the opening lead was from AJ109x of @h and the @cK is still offside|pg||

pc|h5|nt|ewj: which won't make|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed perhaps he should have turned down the invitation!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: less unreasonable in my view than the acceptance at least it was a shapely 14 with top cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like a routine 3N here |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: there is a great pressure in this form of head to head team comp to bid games of course as its usually a disaster when u dont bid and they can make|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: single dummy 6@D might make on most days|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: but tht does not excuse ridiculous hand evaluation decisions|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, you'r right Geoff|pg||
nt|lestergold: good contract 6@d but not on this layout sadly|pg||
nt|mamos: eleven tricks in Nt  any chance of a twelth?|pg||
nt|roswolf: will stevens take this slam try seriously?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Burn and Malinowski bid a 5@D against my team in the TGR league this year - it was only about 2%, but it made |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so they are well used to bidding thin games |pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: he did|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: needs to either establish a long club or ruff a spade in dummy assuming 3/2 trump break so its a slam which good pairs should be in|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunately neither can be achieved here|pg||
nt|mamos: it does have chances though|pg||
nt|lestergold: is there a doubole squeeze of some kind? double dummy I mean?|pg||
nt|roswolf: in practice a pseudo squeeze is the best chance west may need to cling on to his third heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: diamonds never mentioned at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzug: Gunnar asking about the shape of Steven's hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Mike whereios that 12th trick coming from|pg||
nt|roswolf: gunnar may try @CA and another|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: well i would like to see someone pseudo squeeze Hallberg|pg||
nt|mamos: I think hell go down trying to ruff Spade|pg||
nt|mamos: I think Heart stops it even dd|pg||
nt|lestergold: as you say single dummy this slam looks headed for the shredder|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it is the logical play i think -but maybe ducan will have an inspiration or 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: double dummy iy looks like headed for Darwin's column|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Happer might still be playing this hand tomorrow|pg||
nt|ewj: this is really unlucky|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes he is one of our best youngish prospects|pg||
nt|ewj: Obviously Zia makes a fairly off centre 1NT call|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the tournamnet director may have something to say about that |pg||
nt|ewj: and rather than costing IMPs which it might have done, it actually gains him a swing|pg||
nt|lestergold: before spade ruff i think happer will play a club and ruff a club in hand to see if anuthing helpful happens like a Tx dropping|pg||
nt|lestergold: shows how bad bidding gets rewarded sometimes|pg||
nt|vugraphzug: Happer's cards still on the table as he stares at dummy|pg||
nt|ewj: I know that's how games of probability work....but it seems a little unjust...it's more or less a 26 IMP swing based on the @S not breaking, this one time|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the timing of the commentary can be amusing - my reference to the TD was of South was stil playing this hand tomorrow, not Zia's 1NT opening |pg||
nt|lestergold: Zia pays price of opening a bent no trump fails to find diamond fit and stays out of unlucky but excellent slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: i realised that Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think it was clear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they were a bit fortunate on board 10, so maybe this evens it out a bit|pg||
nt|lestergold: nevertheless isnt it tomorrow alraeady?|pg||

nt|roswolf: understanable -the long think i mean|pg||
nt|ewj: But we'll see what East throws on the 5th @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades will yield the 9th trick without letting Burn in to cash his @ds but playing on hearts offers a similar perhaps better prospect iin theory|pg||

nt|lestergold: because the heart pips are better|pg||
nt|ewj: Strange, looked obvious to win the 2nd @D|pg||

nt|ewj: that's also possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: normal to lead lowest of 3 in the suitm partbner has bid|pg||
