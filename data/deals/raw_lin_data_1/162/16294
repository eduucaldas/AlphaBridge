nt|ady: 5@C on for e/w     on heart finesse     takes some bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a nice 5@c on EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf  for a 2005 version of Nightmare as played by a Canadian top pair|pg||

mb|1D|nt|daman: EW have a chance to play 3NT perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: 4@H EW has a play|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: You must shut down|pg||
nt|iceking: north should respond here i think|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 4@H by East?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: why make it easy on oops passing |pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: 5@S    down 2  3 or 4 depending on how many diamond ruffs|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|chick: 4@C transfer to 4@H, similar to Texas but called South African transfer|pg||
nt|tomi2: system test for EW here, seems they are on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|tomi2: playing 4m as transfers to the suit 2 above allows east to decide who becomes declarer in 4M. he can either transfer or bid 4M himself|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not going to keep out east|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry i was delayed|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be interesting to know what 2@C was. seems it promised diamonds, else south cant bid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chick: that is more valuable over weak NTs than it is over strong ones|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Mike :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: Paul no dobt was hoping to get chance to show hearts later|pg||
nt|april7: only on @H lead possible but if Q is not covered then only 2 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D in Nightmare is either 11-21 unbalanced with diamonds or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|mcphee: both minor Q's lie well |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: hi level decisions here  I hate the Five Level!  I always seem to do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: both minor queens are on side as well as @hKQ, so an easy 3nt|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|april7: and after @C lead only 1 down possible!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|iceking: Garozzo will win this and play @C |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|chick: they will probably be ok here, down 3 is only 500 vs a vul game|pg||
nt|chick: but I think it is a very close call|pg||
nt|tomi2: nobodydoubled|pg||
nt|chick: oh, good point :)|pg||
nt|iceking: now best def is duck from S it looks like |pg||
nt|paulg:  frustrating when you hold all of your sides values|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: 1@C is 15+ any|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: was 4@h making  |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Garozzo has won more than any of us ever will |pg||
pc|hT|nt|chick: didn't even look, a double was so obvious :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: A@D  lead   2 from Lebel   surely club switch     then Q@H      that would be down 2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tomi2: why was it?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Not sure about the NT range, the Canadians played it as 11-14|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: I am asked how old he is. Mid 80's is my guess but I am not sure. Maybe Hedy knows|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|mamos: id guess West expected East to do something|pg||
nt|chick: because they have a vul game they expect to make  (or maybe they didn't expect to)|pg||
nt|tomi2: they were not forced, west had @DA but no sure 2nd trick and @H fit|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

mc|10|nt|iceking: cant make it if S ducks @C  |pg||

nt|Walddk2: click on Join Walddk2's table|pg||
nt|iceking: been asked if east ducks @S now S can just win enter trump and always has later @C ace entry and will score 2@S and 2@D tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: they can in fact take also a @d ruff for -3, but 5@c is better|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of competition this hand too|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mcphee: probally not |pg||
nt|bessi2: looks like a normal 3n contract, question whether south will tip the club layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: or maybe not|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In German - mit fingerspitzgefühl:)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mcphee: you cut your finger?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why not 7@C or 7NT while we are at it ? :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  that looks a very strong 1NT, I wonder what the range is|pg||
nt|iceking: flat 4@S here making 12 tricks |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mamos: any guesses what 4@H shows|pg||
nt|mcphee: only you Roland:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that the players don't have the hand records|pg||
nt|daman: a pedestrian 4@S coming up|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: there goes the @s fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: maybe some kind of "last train"? a good hand but doubt to bid on?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Hurrah, we are linked|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Now our operator needs to enter scores on 1, 2 and 3 manually in MOVIE|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, take it back then. maybe a fake cuebid?|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. if that is a reverse 2@d bid, then west is surely heading for slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  less pedestrian if West leads the @dK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S 10 tricks with @D lead - but probably J@H lead|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|doctorone: N estimates that he is "too weak for a weak two" :)|pg||
nt|othered1: He estimates correctly :)|pg||
nt|doctorone: sure|pg||
nt|pelu: 10-12 - an the lead - @dK = 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: or not:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he should bid 4@C over 3NT|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@d cant have been a reverse then|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion 6@c is farbetter than 3nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: why no @H lead here is a surprise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mind you, you could easily go down in 6|pg||
nt|iceking: more chance w leads @D then east|pg||
nt|iceking: probably should lead @D king after this bidding|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk3: 2@S the limit on a diamond lead and a club switch, and even then declarer has to guess @SQ when the next diamond comes through|pg||
nt|tomi2: any reasonable lead will make this go down now. clubs => ruff, @H =>open a trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C no (no dbl by East) - @S no, of course - J@H with 4 @H in North can be dangerous|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bessi2: did he really lead a spade|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: so K@D seam to be the better lead (technically)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: East shifted to third best from 6.  Wonder if that is their agreement|pg||

nt|iceking: but as he has 97x JT doesnt really help him unless declerar misguesses @S|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but EW have a profitable save in 5@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C 2 down by E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: wasn´t 3nt from E a real underbid? on last board?|pg||
nt|tomi2: this @CK false card only works agains pairs who lead low from 96, else the small card would be the better one. South "might" think partner made some inspired lead from Kx. not ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: likely but the king made it easier for south to play for that ruff|pg||
mb|1H|nt|doctorone: Previous board, surprisingly, EW entered the bidding and did not locate their @h fit|pg||

nt|daman: of course|pg||
nt|iceking: might stick in 3nt here or|pg||
nt|iceking: depends little what 3@H means |pg||
mb|3N|nt|tomi2: they play a limited system, he could not have more than this. maximum points, no wasted KQJ in @D and a 6th trump|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H is strange|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure about the 3rd spade, why not 3NT?|pg||

nt|mamos: and 6@S-1 led to a swing|pg||

nt|iceking: probably just natural |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt with 2 stop in @S is OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cards very well placed for a NT contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@H 1NT, West must give 2 stop in @S bidding 2Nt|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bigtrain: @HK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|iceking: yes 2@S and one each for just makeing|pg||

nt|ady: east tht worth a game try    |pg||
nt|ady: this should be way overboard|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think 2@d can still be a fair 15 points, so West has to do something with a fit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes, 2@D is limkited to 15|pg||

nt|psridhar: decent slam ; i am sure they will get there, their slam bidding gr8 !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 16 or more, Garozzo would have bid 2@C, Gazzilli|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|pelu: yes he could - I was just asking about 2NT/3@D - what is the diff|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right Magnusson - with interesting raise in @D 2@S was the best auction for W|pg||
nt|iceking: 2nt just correct on values |pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: had S opened @H would never get mentioned and 3N a likely landing spot|pg||
nt|iceking: would bid 2@S on hand like Axx x KJxxx Kxxx maybe|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ady: surely should not be 11 with the simple preference to 3@S?|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: 2@S|pg||

nt|bridge_one: QJ10x in @C and KQx in @S - 2Nt need ...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  with West's soft values and (hopefully) double spade stop, 2NT looks right|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: Nunes has so far shown ( i guess ) gf hand, @h, some clubs, and a slam try hand with his 3@s-unless some of those are artificial hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: artificial bids ( not hand sry)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see that he has set @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: surely that 1@s X=hearts Hedy? |pg||
nt|hedyg: you always have @H when you double 1@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont|pg||
nt|psridhar: and 2@s confirming @h fit and gf hand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sometimes i just dont have a natural call|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The trouble is that it doesn't matter what he does as they can take a club ruff|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|psridhar: maybe upto 3@c Nunes did not confirm @h fit but later the partnership has estblished H fit and tried for slam|pg||

nt|bessi2: however, 4@s bid was not one I was considering|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@S was a bit much after 2@H I think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D probably confirm 5@H and ask stop in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: seems like then passing 1@S wasn't so off the charts then|pg||
nt|psridhar: intra -finesse Position in @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: for one loser, play low club from hand to 6 spot in dummy and then later run the Queen pinning the 10 for one loser|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4 leading teams will play the semifinals at a later date|pg||
nt|psridhar: the intra finesse studied first by Chagas i believe|pg||
nt|psridhar: but then 3@H is hopeless, 3@s works -how to get there after 3@d opg?|pg||
nt|iceking: ok this second dbl is no need for just gives them extra round for info|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H makes because North has no more than 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good pass by CIMA|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: East's auction is controlled by the lack of a weak 2, so sound.  In that context west is backing off because of the misfit.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Do they play Drury?|pg||
nt|doctorone: yes but with fit |pg||
nt|ritong: very probably|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@H for me would ask N to bid 3N with a @H stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: with hearts 3-2   should not be problems|pg||
nt|mcphee: but they may not have this agreement|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: OK, so West had to respond 1NT|pg||

pc|d7|nt|bigtrain: so far i'm not in danger of giving up a big club :)|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|hedyg: specs say they get an error message , maybe too many log-ins at once|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: works for me |pg||
nt|paulg:  Garozzo said that there was little to be gained by him declaring it too|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fann4: Hullo Hedy:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk3: Don't know if strong club exists in France, I guess not among top players at least. Henri?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'd poll the juniors first|pg||
nt|ritong: it exists, of course, but not in a popular way|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi Jeff|pg||
nt|fann4: and Parmanabhan|pg||
nt|psridhar: @c Q now to limit it to d1|pg||
nt|psridhar: the intra fin we talked abt earlier|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: i am still trying to calculate how not covering the 10@H can cost|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ritong: top players like to show a suit first|pg||
nt|ritong: matter of philosophy, naturally|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: my opinion is that is more important to give the information about the looser in @D that Qx in @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: disappointing but should be easy regardless, just play winners|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Like Martens-Jassem, playing two different systems depending on vulnerability|pg||
nt|chick: would a first trick duck of the heart have helped?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North would not bid 6@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Roland but interesting...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but with @hK instead of @hQJx...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with QJ on @H would be more difficult to choose between pass and 3@H|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hedyg: 1. Laffineur 165 2. Cronier 163 3. Zimmermann 157 4. Doussot 153|pg||
nt|ady: will east be tempted here|pg||
nt|bessi2: problem with a 6@c gamble is that east with ace or king of @h will lead there for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not fond of 3NT as a solid minor either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If NT is the spot, it's often wrong-sided|pg||
nt|daman: all roads lead to 3NT  EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ritong: taking into account the fact that interferences will occur less frequently when opps are vulnerable|pg||
nt|hedyg: he actually opened 3NT and bid 4@d over pd's 4@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or as Fred Gitelman says, only open 3NT if you do NOT want to play there|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@S is good for that hand type, transfer pre-empt|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: In other words, use it for something else|pg||
mb|2C|nt|doctorone: a good bad 2N would be welcome here, allowing W to bid a constructive 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: poor slam with 2 key cards missing    but could be made seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: defence would have five tricks then  i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: oh my, 3@D not my cup of tea here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psridhar: Nunes cannot open 1@d there ; his system requires stronger hand for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: This can now make on a @D guess.|pg||
nt|mcphee: but it sure worked well|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk3: 5@D is fine|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes top tricks in defense are the most difficult to cash often:)|pg||
nt|chick: so the same|pg||
nt|mamos: difficult for South|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes ruff 3 @cs and ace drops for a @D discard|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: running scores at   http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: wd|pg||
nt|psridhar: and leading pd's suit is no sin|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but isn´t a @d lead natural from N without a @d bid from S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: ruff 2 clubs   lose 1   first|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: sure|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer will likely draw 2 trumps and play on @C, hoping for some clues.|pg||
nt|paulg:  a double of 1@d by South would have led to a more interesting auction|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bessi2: it sure is imo|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh dear|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ????|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|doctorone: next... :)|pg||
nt|chick: 10 tricks with the club finesse working, expect an early claim :)|pg||
nt|mamos: just needs Clubs|pg||
nt|chick: it will be momentarily scary though :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|tomi2: he could lead the @Cq to give west the chance to cover|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: however guessing dia is no easy task|pg||
nt|fann4: Which the defence are unlikely to give him - and so he may well play the overcaller for the @DA.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bridge_one: never saw Garozzo to play a bridge so linear :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tamburrini did not read it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: but more normal is to try @c to the K|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mcphee: wonder what the lead agreements are for n/s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: his @d bid was a boomerang....|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d2|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d3|pc|s7|nt|psridhar: @h QJ, and @c ace are the only High cards E has shown up so far|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s4|pc|d5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fann4: That @C to the Ace doesn't mean a great deal, as E would falsecard with @CAKx(x) anyway.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|sT|nt|hedyg: normal play for -1|pg||
nt|psridhar: but no dia discard yet from East-wont he have pitched one from ace?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|daman: must have miscounted the @Hs|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think bbo vugraph has shown us that the world stars just play good bridge most of the time, even the flamboyant|pg||
