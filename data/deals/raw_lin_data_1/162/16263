nt|lestergold: this time Hallberg not getting away with his optimistic bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s cant really manage gameso west needs to hold hios losses to no more than 1 off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, he has a hand of sorts - East's double is aggressive |pg||
nt|mamos: to be fair to Gunnar David Burn did double albeit after passing and West has good fit and values|pg||
nt|mamos: so so often right for defenders to play trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but Halleberg knwos that Burn is playing hiom for those values- I think hallberg has too much defence here to worry about opps making game|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you Hallberg will expect the awful spade break and will lead spades from dummt after ruffing ghearts so may do quite well|pg||
nt|lestergold: Happer will not want to ruff low cards here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be -2 if south plays ace and another trump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he will know they are 5-0 when South doesn't lead one|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg could scramble quite a number of tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: low red card is more likely i feel|pg||
nt|lestergold: bestb defence not clear but i think Happer has to drsw a couple iof rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: I think North should have lead trump|pg||
nt|lestergold: that will leave hallberg a trick short must lose another heart 2 spades along with trump A|pg||

nt|mamos: lol  |pg||
nt|lestergold: now back to 1 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: Stevens has not defended well on this hand two errors the lead and then heart discard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the result from the other room comes through.... |pg||
