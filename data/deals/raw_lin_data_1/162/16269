nt|djneill:  does not appear there are 7 tricks regardless, and very little pressure on West as the 3rd black cash in each sui sets up a trick for East anyways|pg||

nt|garnetts: swingy first set and both sides missed an excellent slam on board 8 |pg||

nt|garnetts: yes  might have finessed the spade last time--just possible that east has led from xx in hearts |pg||

nt|djneill:  right if Zia ducks this, and West plays another @c, Zia can play another two clubs and now the @dQ will not be able to be ruffed out by force without the finesse|pg||
nt|djneill:  great chances for Stevens to get back into the match|pg||
nt|delberto:  should switch to diamonds now|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok and 5@s undoubled in the other room, nice job to Stevens there|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: one problem for West is that if 1@c is short 2@C may be natural rather than a cue-bid raise  |pg||

nt|djneill:  Zia checks the back his cards but West could see North winning the @dT would not set the contract, with the positional @s stop and no entry to South's hand|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|roswolf: hmm go for gold|pg||
nt|roswolf: they make 7|pg||
nt|ahh: not a problem with east minor holdings is it |pg||
nt|lestergold: 17 opp a weqak no trump 7 a bridge too far even with their deficit 6 needs finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which looks cold, with @cQ and @dK right  |pg||
nt|mamos: 13 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes true|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3@H dbled sounded like the money to me--easy lead too|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: on the only playable line|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: but is double of 3@h penalty or a you-make-the-decision kind of bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: imo it is penalty and zia made a decision|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: its an exceelnt 6 actually because it comes in on 1 of 2 finesses|pg||
