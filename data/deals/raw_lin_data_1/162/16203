nt|tez: good start for EW|pg||
nt|kmb24: someone will play 7 here|pg||
nt|kmb24: chileans don't like to stop in 6 on hands like this|pg||
nt|orzuelo: specially Rios in the closed room, who is known for his aggressive bidding|pg||
nt|tez: 1 ruf enough to @c=7@h..any lead|pg||
nt|tez: easy to make but hard bid|pg||
nt|kmb24: am being told there's a problem with the hands, seems north and south are reversed in real life|pg||
nt|kmb24: hopefully it won't affect the result|pg||
nt|kmb24: they've stopped in 6@d!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kmb24: looks like that can be defeated on any major suit lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kmb24: seems north got to open hearts, east overcalled spades, and south, after hearing hearts and clubs jumped to 6@d|pg||
nt|tez: its not real bidding..|pg||
nt|orzuelo: seems so|pg||
pc|sK|mc|7|nt|kmb24: and i was wrong, the other table stopped peacefully in 6H.|pg||
nt|kmb24: rafa chose to go low here.  I'd rather bid a little and try to make some action.  |pg||
nt|kmb24: 3N isn't the worst game i've been in|pg||

mb|p|nt|caturris: During the first set of today Caracci's team only lost 2 imps finally, there was a correction |pg||
nt|kmb24: When you need imps to fly usually you want to be active|pg||

nt|tez: your story fnished..why will you run:)|pg||
nt|caturris: action coming up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kmb24: can make 6@s, opening 1@s is a good start to getting there|pg||

nt|kmb24: 4h too, but 3nt is cold with the Q@C well placed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|kmb24: a little light for 2n|pg||
nt|kmb24: but caracci continues to be aggressive, as they should, to make it hard to catch them|pg||
nt|reisig: 2N is light - when all the @ds are wrong :)|pg||
