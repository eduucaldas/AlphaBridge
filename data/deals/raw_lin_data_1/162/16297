nt|psridhar: Tewari knows his side has about 35-36 HCP , all keys , trump queen.....needs imagination to stop short in small slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzvf: satya describes the 2@s to deepak|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3@c =perhaps 'accepting' trf with fit and gud hand, explain direct launch to 4nt |pg||

nt|psridhar: in my view, Satya should hv bid 6C ( if 5S denied Trump queen ) |pg||
nt|bigtrain: reverse the pointed suits and 7@h is a great contract|pg||
nt|psridhar: if they play 6c denies trump queen then 5N denies @s king...|pg||
nt|psridhar: either way tewari likely to sign off in 6C|pg||

pc|s4|nt|panja: Manoj asks about 6@C being odds on...as it is 50%..on a finesse...but that is only after seeing 4 cards...|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|psridhar: in a direct seat that action -of X and new suit bid- represents about 18 HCP +; but the hcp reqmt in bal seat is less |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: having cue bid 3@h was enuf on satya's hand......but they say bid games at imps....:)|pg||

nt|figo: gap narrowing|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: from West's point of view......there could be a top trump missing.....E could have only 1 Spade..or even void...|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: and he needs to find out all beginning at a high level...3@C...so he took a practical decision to bid 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|figo: but one more score coming in  so its back to 19 imps difference|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jtr: I prefer 1@s to double|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rmb1: oh yes|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt bidder usually should not have another bid all by herself..so 3@D here is a bit of a dadagiri|pg||
nt|panja: or didigiri...even|pg||
mb|p|nt|joemanjo: EW have enough firepower to reach 4@H despite roadblocks by opps|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: good lead...|pg||
nt|panja: best to lead your long side suit if you have trump length|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Can they avoid the disaster from the closed room?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: open room rather|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joemanjo: Rajesh is now considering how high he should aim. Slam is also a possibility from his point of view with no diamond wastage.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: They need the 17 IMPs badly|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|figo: the winner of this match gets seeding to semis of next India selection trials |pg||
nt|figo: losing team , a direct entry to the trials |pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: 16 now as they play in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the difference is 12 IMPs going into the last 14 boards|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tlc: Hi again everyone|pg||

pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Right, maybe only 9 IMPs because CV Rao got a procedural penalty not recorded on the scoreboard|pg||

nt|psridhar: but @c lead itself might hv robbed defense of a tempo-tough to stay away from club lead|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|psridhar: win dia shift, play a small heart, win dia contn, cross to dummy in trump, play cl pitch dia...home|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bigtrain: @C lead doesn't hurt as long as a @D shift is made at trick 2 (seems automatic)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: needed a dia lead on the go.......tough one, jitu might be off the hook there for his unnatural X of 2S|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|psridhar: that grand slam try 5@h denies @d ace and satya will sign off in 6@c now|pg||

mb|2C|nt|panja: on B28...6@D seems like a good spot|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|panja: preempted out of constructive bidding now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|panja: the best Satya can do is to raise to 4Nt..but that is also a bit risky..|pg||

nt|vugraphzvg: we will be back within 15 min. for next session...|pg||

pc|d3|mc|12|nt|rmb1: ... as strong NT.  I guess some of these pairs are playing weak NT|pg||
nt|jtr: @s switch now at the other table|pg||
nt|jtr: We are in England, the home of the weak NT:)|pg||
nt|panja: play @H to @H9..no harm here...could even be a good play to secure 4 heart tricks..|pg||
nt|sunit: correctly played 4sp can make|pg||
nt|sunit: without touching trumps pitch a dia on the club jack and play a dia|pg||
