nt|Walddk2: Only 1 table for the second half so commentators scheduled for the scosed room will have to sit out. Sorry about that|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: Gold will try for 11 tricks  eliminating hearts and clubs and playing ace and another diamond after trumps drawn|pg||
nt|jtr: I volunteer|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for standings before the last round|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: still only 10 tricks as they lay|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|mc|10|nt|athene: i would think gold will try and duck diamonds to take advantage of a 3-3 break with the @HA offside but it isn't likely (or necessary) :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: weird|pg||

nt|jtr: Or the protective double|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: 1 minute break  for kibitzers in the Club, a bit crowdy here|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: my word - Dunn team caught speeding next door|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pearson's Rule|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: at other table there was 1nt opening (4th seat) and 2@c overcall for both majors|pg||
