nt|Walddk2: Here Forrester missed the switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzuf: Forrester almost apologised :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: 1@D or 1NT?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Jeffrey, Tomi?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Why 1D and not 1NT overcall?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: OK; so you answered my question|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: 1@D would promise 5 ones for me, but I am not Zia :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1  think 1nT is routine, but Zia is Zia|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would 1NT show?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tomi2: and 3@H would be 4 cards for me|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|jallerton: 15-18 with a club stop|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Blimey, that's what he has|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But as you both said, Zia is Zia|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's why we have almost 900 spectators in this room|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps 1NT is slightly less attractive against the N/S system, when 1@c is often not clubs (they open 1@c on all 11-13 bal)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Game swing to Gillis on board 6. 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|tomi2: if south had passed, would zia also open 1@D instead of 1nt? he must have some reason for this but i dont see it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and more coming here I suspect|pg||

pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: 3 or 4 years ago, Fredrik Bj√∂rnlund was in the Swedish open team at the European Championships in Poland with Peter Fredin as his partner. That partnership did not last long|pg||
