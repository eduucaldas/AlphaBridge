nt|peachy: For those interested, history of this event http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagar_Women%27s_Knockout_Teams|pg||
nt|puncher99: 9th trick is going to be hard to get here|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: usual.|pg||
nt|gambit: 6@D is a good spot, and with KD onside, a great one |pg||

nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|kareno: Good day from Las Vegas :)|pg||
nt|chick: Welcome everyone :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello from Italy :)|pg||
nt|psyck: "Sementa"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Yes, the name is Antonio Sementa|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W play a system very similar at Lauria-Versace|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: thanks Joe, we will remember that and 1 IMP could make a difference|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|psyck: The strong @c system may not work too well here allowing opps to possibly find a @d sacrifice|pg||
nt|kareno: I had the pleasure of losing to Versace and Lauria in a KO match earlier this week :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all   and welcome back to Toronto |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|psyck: N will be happy to hear 2@s by S|pg||
nt|kareno: The next KO fortunately we won so I can still show my face around here.  It was this exact team that defeated us.|pg||
nt|kareno: Did I say hello from Vegas?  I'm still in Toronto watching baseball games :)|pg||
nt|psyck: South has maximum for the earlier pass, no wastage in opps suit, & shape|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i hate the first pass... clearly worth a double|pg||
nt|bigtrain: now impossible to catch up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, assuming double was 5-7, it was certainly possible on 2@d|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree - now she hasn't got a good bid but 2@s will do.|pg||
nt|psyck: double or 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: depending on agreement|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|duschek: Hellp|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: Hello :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Quinn:  you better play the spots off of this one|pg||
nt|rv: technically West invites and East accepts with max|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: giving a medium hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chick: staggering their way to the right place|pg||
nt|xenya: double possible as S's hand is limited by his 1st bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Askgaard - Bjarnarson East-West against  Fantoni-Nunes|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome |pg||
nt|sybarra: what a table!! |pg||
nt|duschek: A bit of explanation needed. West's 2@D showed 5+@H and less than game-forcing strength - EW open almost all hands containing 10+ HCP and a 5cM|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: West never showed his diamond fit - |pg||
nt|ady: 1 imp to Cayne|pg||
nt|psyck: I guess W felt he had too much in def to bid more|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Ho Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Giorgio :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rv: this could make if declarer takes a @h hook, plays for @hs 3-3 and @CA rite|pg||
nt|xenya: NS play Polish Club|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D is safe contract|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tarekr:  Exactly but Shawn is not taking any chances to miss game even though it is a non-vul one|pg||
nt|ady: meantime 5@D  only down 1|pg||
nt|xenya: where all strong hands are opened 1@C|pg||
nt|duschek: The rest was natural - Askgaard accepted the invitation, having promised 10-15 HCP initially|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|duschek: Those heart intermediates in dummy are quite handy for East|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psyck: the 2@d could be a wide ranging hand too i guess|pg||
nt|kareno: I would hope south would take the push to 5@s.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|duschek: Sorry, with East being Bjarnarson, he was obviously the one accepting the invitation to game|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, @d more comfortable to play than @s's here I guess|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|rv: Mildred is well on way to 9 tricks here if she plays a @c to K|pg||
nt|xenya: also many weak ones|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|duschek: (and after a bit of warming up I will also be able to tell who is declarer...)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bridge_one: probably make 10 tricks because must cuess A second in @C|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|rv: playing a @d off table also works as cards are|pg||
nt|tarekr:  nice @d|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|psyck: good, & we have Giorgio to help us out with EW's system which he says is similar to Lauria-Versace|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: his table will not be for the faint of heart or your grandmothers bridge club |pg||
nt|duschek: Anyway, with hearts breaking nicely, no problem for West, who will pick up an overtrick imp|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|bridge_one: play exatly the same Krisma :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rv: not sure if this is best line though, I would have played a @c to K after cashing @hs in hand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|tarekr:  well done!|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|psyck: nice, makes for a well knit team|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not quite the way i envisioned it|pg||
nt|peachy: just 1 IMP in, could have been a game swing|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|peachy: or out, depends on one's view :)|pg||
nt|puncher99: friendly lie of cards for NS if they can  get to the heart suit|pg||
nt|peachy: EW play strong club and weak NT |pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome back to this Quarterfinal match from Spingold|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|santyclz: Nice @s "low".|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble is supposed to show a five card minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here it may help NS find hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Extended notes between South and West....|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Greetings to all.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we may play it here|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|puncher99: tough to find hearts now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was it really west who bid 2@H??|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: Is this real|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yes it was.|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you operator/Ross|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: NS have more points than EW, about time they stuck their nose in|pg||
nt|ybob: 2down in 2@S|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Brave balance on that suit.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: there will be a director at this table soon|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr for interrupting once. Sport by high level.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz: 3@c?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: That's the bid.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfe: I don't know what the 2@h means, but there was a lengthy conversation between|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Westheimer and von Arnim at the time.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|santyclz: Seems more likely n would bid that...|pg||
nt|chick: a hand to pass out :)|pg||
nt|peachy: West had enough, understandably.  She knows NS on shaky ground, doesnt need much math to figure that|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzfe: This should be a fairly quick table.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: mnight need the spade shift whoon |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzfe: At least, so far it has been.|pg||
nt|peachy: Bramley Welland def is UDCA, o/e first discard only|pg||
nt|ybob: after KQ@S + A@D on N, S has A@C and KQ @H|pg||
nt|ybob: clear to declarer ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia is taking his time on this.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: now spade nine|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not at all obvious of course, but you need a miracle|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|tarekr:  this does not look like fun for EW|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|s2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|peachy: now has to avoid 2 club losers|pg||
nt|peachy: doable but does he have info on where ace is?|pg||
nt|ybob: he plays 3 rounds @D and home after N shows only 3@D|pg||
nt|ybob: later ruff @S ruff next @D with 8@C and win|pg||
nt|ybob: because J@C on N|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to John Stewart|pg||
nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
nt|ybob: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi John|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia pulls out  a card then folds his hand.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|peachy: Would declarer have stranded spades on purpose if she had two of them?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Perhaps she is depending on Qx of @hs in one hand.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|puncher99: she must b|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well auken played 10 first round, causing the confusion|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Had to double check that trick :)|pg||
nt|stewball: elegant but doomed|pg||
nt|stewball: zia is long on elegance|pg||
nt|ybob: declarer need 3/3 @C so N showed 5@S 2@H what wrong with play QJ@D and another @D ?|pg||
nt|stewball: its not clear what this line catered to ,other than elegance|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: since they missed the heart fit, it really does not matter what happens on this hand|pg||
nt|stewball: well at least theres not as much at stake given the OR result|pg||
nt|stewball: i have a feeling Hamman doesnt think this hand is worth 20 minutes of his life|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||

nt|rv: if East doesn't open, will you open 1@d or 1n with North hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: the director was here getting the auction from a board in the last set, where there was some sort of appeal in the other room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Sementa and Duboin started to play togheter few years ago, so they at Versace the system|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-14|nt|bridge_one: there are only few change, depending on style to play, but 88% is equal|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  when I am short oM, i generally will bid a good 4 cd major in 3rd or 4th seat|pg||
nt|duschek: EW play a strong club showing 16+ or possibly 15 balanced. 1NT is 12-14 at all seats and vulnerabilities.|pg||
mb|2H|an|Tx|nt|bridge_one: 98%|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@C possible  but likely to play in 3NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tarekr:  support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is limited at 9 hcp exclude 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: double?|pg||
nt|xenya: must be a specialised bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by North is aggressive in vuln|pg||
nt|psyck: even playing equal level conversion, it would not occur to me at this vul|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl give @H + a minor|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with sgl @s North think the partner can have @s and points, so he must bid anything|pg||
nt|xenya: if it shows the reds, S is not pleased|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  shows 3 cd support|pg||
mb|2N|nt|psyck: S clearly expected more|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now depending on agreement - i suppose 2Nt was convetional for N/S in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: invite sequence it looks like|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: no more tricks than the 5@d, & 2 aces in sight|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3N need a present by defence|pg||
nt|xenya: good defence will obviously beat this|pg||
nt|chick: clubs could be set up, but I think defense will get their major suits first|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, should set it 1 or 2 w/o much difficulty i think|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, with 11 decent HCP, Askgaard invites game opposite 12-14. This sequence is a standard Jacoby sequence; I believe that 2@S denied 4-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: some wastage in diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: each bidding their weakness|pg||
nt|kareno: This looks like some sort of relay auction.  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s 2@H 1@C are ON for defence in all case|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but can make more tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Bill Jacobs in Australia|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Bill |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bill plays the same system as Fantunes, so we are well covered now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: anything from 11 to 13 tricks in clubs |pg||
nt|Walddk4: as Jacob knows the Danish system pretty well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, and I might learn something as well|pg||
nt|duschek: Bjarnarson decides on 3NT, based on the bad distribution and slow values|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a coded lead:  normal count from hands that include an honour|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rv: some might not show supp double with sub-min hand (11 hcp with Mildred)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: same auction in the other room to 3NT on 49, and they made an overtrick|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told 2@h was a gf|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kareno: Club slam requires picking up the suit.  Stiff king in either hand twice as likely as stiff jack in north.|pg||
nt|duschek: I have learnt a bit too much from Askgaard and Bjarnarson this year, losing 4-25 to them in the round-robin of this year's Danish championship, then by 80 imps in the semifinal|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bunch as we say |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The Norwegians were a little conservative in the closewd room and it is going to hurt them|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe I'm not meant to call them Norwegians ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Declarer has thumbed @H3 several times|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is assuming "we" make it here|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|tarekr:  I bet it is not going to be the same auction in other room on this hand|pg||
nt|rv: @s back could be best here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|duschek: Communications are not very good, but the cards are friendly towards declarer this time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: speaking of communications, connection here has been unreliable. |pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: a stiff king in either hand doesn't guarantee picking up the suit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: Fulvio will be going through all the permutations and combinations, trying to visualize a layout where he can beat this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: pull up a chair, get a drink. This is going to be a long set.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|chick: so still same odds overall|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may see low @S  off dummy now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: we will, surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think declarer is wondering whether he should play @SA first|pg||
nt|bjacobs: in case South has @SK singleton|pg||
nt|bebechira: we have to congratulate Bill for the wonderful win yesterday for Victoria in the Australian National Championship :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, well, not exactly the spingold ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: congrats Bill! |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|rv: here both Mildred and Quinn could have shown restraint in second round of bidding, case for both to pass|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: If you can get two round of clubs in safely then spades might break.  I'm not sure how I would play this in six.  |pg||
nt|psyck: picking up @c's is hardly 6%|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kareno: Lauria is a fine declarer... let's watch!  Heart lead best for the defense.|pg||
nt|psyck: a very poor slam, and both Q 1st & A 1st are equal odds|pg||
nt|psyck: it is just a question of J single with N or K single with S..about 6% on a @h lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: you have to add Jxx offside with xxx+ in spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Lauria is declarer.  Lynch on lead.  Without a spade lead it is easier but club suit still an issue.  Then spades a problem.|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, still say calling it 10% doesn't make it sound so good either :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Sorry, without a HEART lead |pg||
nt|bigtrain: so makeable if singleton K in S by picking up trump OR singleton K in N if S has xxx+ in spades|pg||
nt|kareno: No but remember the Italians winning a world championship because Kx of spades was in the pocket.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however this result is the risk to overcall with light hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kareno: Right it was clubs. |pg||
nt|kareno: Okay good lead.|pg||
nt|psyck: now all up to his table feel :)|pg||
nt|psyck: we are lucky to get an exciting start anyway :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: 4@H now|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So now is the time to get really simple, a second club finesse, more spades and hope|pg||
nt|sybarra: how does he get back to hand? |pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|chick: my worst bridge nightmare, a two way guess for a slam|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he clearly chose the % line|pg||
nt|chick: I average about 7% getting it right |pg||
nt|ady: 11 imps to Lynch|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, A is better as you mentioned due to additional @s chances|pg||
nt|kareno: This was a total guess except that he knew two cards in south's hand, KQ.  That could have swayed him.|pg||
nt|kareno: King singleton either hand gives him a chance for the hand.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: He doesn't|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, more normal to wait for pd to balance aggresively than entering before opps limit hand, at least at this vul|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4 spades, 3 clubs, a heart and a diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: and doesnt care actually I see |pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: 3 down|pg||
nt|xenya: hardly an achievement by NS, this one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the line played by south is a little strange, because if East hold Q@C then can find one trick - probably better continue  with Q @H for KJ @S in east|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|tarekr:  2 more tricks for W|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|duschek: So it's 6 more imps for Bjarnarson|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kareno: He needed four spades in the south hand on his assumption she had Kxx in clubs.  |pg||
nt|kareno: So therefore the spade finesse - if she has four spades, then it is a better than even money finesse.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 7|pg||
nt|duschek: Make that 7|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: can this be a canape?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfe: Both sides of the screen writing explanation of this sequence.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: Welland-Branley system nnotes say thi:    We are pretty aggressive and imaginative, so we might show up without the shape or strength that we have promised at any time.      Expect ...|pg||
nt|peachy: excitement during the match, at some point|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|santyclz: Must have been shortness rather than a minimum.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tarekr:  should easily come to ten tricks.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|santyclz: Let me take that back, n could easily go opposite a minimum with such good controls out of the suit.|pg||
nt|chick: yes, but still they are probably too high|pg||
nt|rodal f: A lot of cards are placeded now after S bid.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stewball: would welland open 2@h on KTxxx?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz: It didn't show a "subminimum".|pg||
nt|peachy: First seat favorable, I wouldn't put it past him, don't know though|pg||
nt|peachy: I have seen interesting actions in the past|pg||
nt|stewball: well the K convinced zia that he might apparently|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Didn't notice where Zia won that one.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: When the cards start flying at this table, they do so very fast.|pg||
nt|stewball: he;s likely to lose a couple on this defence|pg||
nt|ybob: declarer can play small, J@S and @S to K if @S are 4/2 play next @H and squeezed N later|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz: I'm told they play Ogust, in which case 3@c was "bad hand" "bad suit", surely an accurate description.|pg||
nt|chick: but she still went on to game?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|peachy: An old CC for Arnim- von Auken says "Canape style with longer minors but neverl onger majors" so Martin got it right|pg||

nt|kareno: Once the club ace drew the jack, that was the preferred line of play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|psyck: 2@c is limited as !@c is available with stronger hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 3@d requires right @d guess here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C polish, so 10/15 5+ cards in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: One of the key aspects of the Fantunes system is that you have to open 1NT on many many many hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This is one of them ... although he did have a 2@S opening as an option (in third seat)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|duschek: What does 1NT show in their system?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: about 12-14, semi balanced|pg||
nt|sybarra: "any thing"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's opened with all 5332 shapes, and most of the 5422's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 12-14 announced|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now if you believe the rule of 11, you play the 7 here|pg||
nt|duschek: And he needs a lot of overtricks to match the 400 from the open room|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rv: plenty of wastage in rounded suits for E-W, after South's entry into auction, Quinn should get @ds right|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kareno: South fell in love with her hand.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many write me 2@C 11/14 - OK, but the concept is similar :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and there you are in dummy |pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: Cronier could have doubled 2@d to show @hs and @c tolerance (snapdragon double) which would have allowed Willard to compete in @hs|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, he needs 10 overtricks ... too difficult, even for Fantoni|pg||
nt|duschek: Apart from the diamonds, cards are breaking terribly for declarer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The precious @CA is the entry ... can E/W find a way to remove it?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tarekr:  Very good point Venky|pg||
nt|rv: maybe too ambitious opposite a passed partner who bid 2@c at these colors, reasonable auction all around|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|psyck: after 2N, S's hand becomes worse, but some would open 4@s anyway 1st time |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C in napolitan, blueteam, precision and polisch are very similar|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nope|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|ady: might be held to 6 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Not a bad 4@s opening bid and here she should gain IMPs.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bigtrain: forced to win 7 as e/w don't have requisite communication to win 3 @C tricks|pg||
nt|ady: if a spade comes now will have to rise with ace and exit with spade|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And  North has his 7 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: I suspect Quinn will get @ds right here, especially after Willard shows @SA as well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tarekr:  A lot of people forget snapdragon at 2 level!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: Yes, then west will be righteously endplayed.|pg||
nt|psyck: Should find it as E may have bid more with more values|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well ... he's isolated from @DA|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|h3|nt|kareno: Well done by Carolyn Lynch!!|pg||
nt|ady: well done   3 imps to Lynch|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dJ|nt|rv: now 1 down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: now a club trick for NS|pg||
pc|h4|nt|duschek: There will be an endplay somehow|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: diamond Imeant of course|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks like it ... with clubs 6-1, doubt the defence can do anything|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Say North plays a low club here ... E/W can grab their hearts, but then they are stuck, whoever wins the 3rd heart|pg||
nt|duschek: However, if declarer plays the @CA and another club, it will be over|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think he will do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we can see why the other room had trouble with 3 nt |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, you could certainly post-mortem their auction|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|rv: @D9 with South is crucial, good defense, no chance for declarer, apologies for incorrect analyses|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: indeed she did|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: declarer apologized i meant|pg||
pc|hA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The third heart squeezes dummy horribly, but declarer survives|pg||
nt|bjacobs: whatever he does|pg||
pc|h9|nt|duschek: I am not sure, but I think the 2@S bid in the open room showed about 10-13 HCP with a 5-card spade suit. Helgemo balanced, but Helness took him very seriously, or decided that 3NT ...|pg||

nt|santyclz: A spec points out that if s passes and n opens 1nt s might like her 6-4 enough to push to game.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks in clubs for e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|tarekr:  it seemed sh could have pulled trumps before playing @s. Of course had to find Q@d|pg||
nt|ady: maybe only 9|pg||
nt|xenya: routine 3N here -- probably doomed|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: surely S was worth another bid|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, unfortunate lie of @c's|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 6@h good slam|pg||
nt|psyck: knows won't win it at 1 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I think a 2@S bid is clear, if only to prevent 2@C|pg||
nt|kareno: In particular to keep e/w out of clubs.  |pg||
nt|psyck: with those good @s's, i prefer 2@s to 2@d rebid|pg||
nt|duschek: Askgaard decided that @CQT9xx was unsuitable for a 2@C opener, with 1NT being a decent alternative|pg||
nt|duschek: With 75% of the HCP in the short suits, I can understand him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 1NT 12-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: its sort of a 12|pg||
nt|duschek: 12-14 as far as I know - 15 balanced HCP should be within the 1@C opening|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North has to decide a strategy for the defence ... go for ruffs, or try to force declarer?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the OR, they went for the force ... a losing heart lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course, it was a different auction, with N/S bidding and raising hearts|pg||
nt|duschek: Morten Lund Madsen's lead of a small heart in the open room did not give declarer a hard time|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they did bid hts in the OR |pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: it needs correct handling from West hand on @c lead|pg||
nt|kareno: I do too, Krishna|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but Balicki will play for all chances ! here the chance is a mistake by opps|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, on that auction leading a heart is pretty obvious|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: I think the forcing option  is a fair call ... at best you will get one ruff, and it opens up the hand for declarer if you lead clubs|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|psyck: they do not have communication for @d, but dec has no sourse of tricks either|pg||
nt|xenya: 8 tricks and no sign of a 9th|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A @d at first trick and @D would give the chance of a error by East|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|psyck: a @h switch sometime will defeat this|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: if North leads a @c, declarer should draw trumps, pitch dummy's @c on @s and take ruffing finesse in @cs or guess @d for @c pitch|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not, it was the same, having the 8 in @D|pg||
nt|xenya: i can see 2 clubs, 1 diamond, 2 hearts and 3 spades for declarer -- and no endplay on the horizon|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|duschek: The ACE of hearts?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: misclick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: 6@H lot better from East hand since declarer can first guess @ds before postponing @c play|pg||
nt|psyck: may not be easy to defend though|pg||
nt|kareno: The defense needs to tap dummy.  If east gets his diamond ruff it will be an easy hand for north.  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W carding is inverted count, small encourage|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: Balicki would probably make it if i were defending, but not against these opponents|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: all of this discussion is academic since @hs break 4-1 here|pg||
nt|psyck: they needed to set up @h trick before @d ruff|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed.|pg||
nt|psyck: W having passed 1st time & N having bid @h, it was tough|pg||
nt|kit: seems pretty clear to return a heart and put it to declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe @hT was reverse suit preference|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the question is that any return is Ok for the defence :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: except @C, of course|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, any normal passive def works|pg||

nt|sybarra: yes but n/s seriously got pushed around at other table|pg||
mb|5H|mb|5S|nt|duschek: West has so great diamonds that he decided one of them might as well be a trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bad eyes from operator|pg||
nt|bjacobs: ok, so 3@C did show hearts, and then 4@D was natural - it all starts to make sense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: writing small and long way from me|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 5@d would be excellent especially if West had @h length instead of @cs, even now only 2 down|pg||
nt|tarekr:  she thinks she can beat 4@s that's why she passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@d instead of 3 like other table seems to have worked better here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West can stabilise a @C|pg||
nt|kit: he will have to lose a second spade trick unless something strange happens, so down 3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W might be "happy" to have pushed to the 5 level|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even if East now bids on, I don't think N/S will go overboard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They both have two many secondary cards in the red suits|pg||
nt|bjacobs: too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But 6@D is close to making if you guess hearts|pg||
nt|duschek: East should be 6@D, it seems - those three small spades tell him that there will be many tricks available for both sides|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Probably a trick short|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ady: try ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, there is a lot of work to do in 6@D|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|psyck: I'm guessing Lauria would have opened 4@s with S's hand deal 3 :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Sorry, with only 3 spades.  New keyboard messing me up here in Toronto.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i agree with 2@D with bad suit|pg||
nt|chick: 3@H by N would have made it much harder for E to show diamond tolerance|pg||
nt|bridge_one: overall they are also a passed p|pg||
nt|psyck: @s suit is frozen, so may well escape for -2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct krishna|pg||
nt|kit: why will defense ever be forced to break spades?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even more in 6@H ... this is a very wrong contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: as we said earlier,  this table is not for faint of heart  (or granny)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|rv: in my view at IMPs, Mildred should take insurance at these colors|pg||
nt|duschek: Of course, Bjarnarson does not realize that Askgaard only has 3-card heart support so simply bids the sure 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right ... expecting to ruff spades with all those hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Whereas in 6@D, he was worried about ruffing spades with partner's diamonds, and then his weak diamonds being exposed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: However, it seems wrong that East never bid diamonds even once|pg||
nt|duschek: The unlucky expert...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s6|nt|kareno: Yes, straight finesse too risky - could lose diamond, 2 hearts and a club.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: I think that, having bid 5@H, he could have offered 6@D as an alternative|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tarekr:  Venky you r rite because there is also the possibility 5@d makes|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Remote possibility I should say :)|pg||
nt|kit: I'm sort of surprised by this line of play.  Ace of hearts was only sure entry to dummy, so seems like it should have been used for spade finesse|pg||
nt|psyck: @sQ & @dQ are entries to @c|pg||
nt|kit: they are, but declarer doesn't know that|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3 down is ok, so to use A@H to make the finesse in @S is a risk to go 4 down|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|sybarra: maybe should not have touched trumps?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|kit: 2 down still a lot better than 3 down.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s8|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s5|nt|psyck: yes, @s fin does look like best practical chance, though there were possibly better line double dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|duschek: He probably fails to see why one 5-4 fit should be better than another. Even if this pair has played together for about 10 years, using Bergen with only 3 trumps may not have ...|pg||

nt|duschek: Still a successful sacrifice against the 5@S that was, or was not|pg||

nt|sybarra: again looks like issue with other room |pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|psyck: will likely pass i suppose|pg||
nt|kareno: Not a great suit but north wants to get into the auction in case west has only four hearts.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h is natural, hearts, for the specs asking.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, at this vul, worth getting into auction by N with good shape|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: pretty ratty heart suit for this bid, even over something like Qxxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ady: this looks a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|kareno: South obviously thinks north has some sort of 5/5 takeout!!|pg||
nt|ady: fortunately  not too much grief|pg||
nt|kareno: So they are lucky and land on their feet.|pg||
nt|psyck: I suppose S was did not take it as Natural & N passed assuming misunderstanding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C polish, so 15/18|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: coffee deal here|pg||
nt|tarekr:  How about a Tea Party deal here:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead by Versace.|pg||
nt|psyck: there are several bids like 2@d, 1NT, Double to show other suits, so it is common to play 2@h as natural as the 1@h could come with weak hands & you are sitting above the suit|pg||
nt|duschek: 1@S is forcing to game, so West's pass is for takeout|pg||
nt|duschek: You might say that Monaco needed those 12 imps on the previous board|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rv: Tarek, same deals played in Spingold and Wagar?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no|pg||
nt|kit: so they have to open 2@C with 5+ clubs or lose the suit?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is forcing (after 1@S 7+)|pg||
nt|psyck: both 1@c & 2@c can have @c suits|pg||
nt|psyck: just that 2@c is limited, like prec|pg||
nt|kit: I mean with minimal opening|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many told me that 2@C is forcing in polish club - i amn't sure about this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s limited (of course) but dont means weak like in natural !|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like it is forcing, otherwise it would be pretty risky on that big a hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  I don't think so! anyone?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it is forcing -- to game in this sequence|pg||
nt|duschek: Askgaard can almost visualize short diamonds in East. He will not be that enthusiastic about his 16 HCP. They were fine when the auction started, but with the opponents bidding ...|pg||

mb|4S|nt|sybarra: can E pass?  guess not|pg||

mb|p|pc|hT|nt|duschek: No, 1@S is forcing to game, so if anybody should take a chance, West should be the one. After all, East has more or less denied 10 HCP, having passed initially.|pg||

nt|duschek: For 4@S to have any chance, South must have the @CK singleton now. Then declarer also needs the @DK with South, but that is hardly possible based on the 1@H overcall.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 20+ minutes behind on clock|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: It does not appear as if time clock pressure will speed anybody up here.|pg||
nt|duschek: As long as everybody agrees to play slowly, there is not much you can do in a knockout match|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Nunes just called director to notify about opponent's speed (lack of).|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzfc: Askgaard agreed it was his side that is slow.|pg||

nt|psyck: this will not be good for Lynch though|pg||
nt|psyck: as 4@h looks a comfortable make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: less one in open room|pg||
nt|duschek: 1 imp for Monaco when EW failed to cash their diamond trick|pg||
mb|1C!|an|strong|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: but 10 tricks can be made, i think|pg||
nt|xenya: how did it go down in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: lynch made a basic mistake, winning the @C opening lead with the J, then no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: dec must have lost track somewhere, all normal lines should make|pg||
nt|kit: club lead, declarer continued clubs, ruffed, diamond to queen and king, another club, and couldn't handle it after that apparently|pg||
nt|psyck: @d ruff entries were there still, could have made by playing @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@h is ON for sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but must call 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: with @hK & @sA well placed, dec will make in comfort here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Duboin can pass|pg||
nt|chick: bridge is a game of mistakes, she still makes fewer than I do :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3N is possible, yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i bet Duboin  first: pass, second 3N|pg||
nt|duschek: Here we have the 15 balanced included in the strong hand|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|psyck: not the beast lead other room...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@h is very conservative by Sementa|pg||
nt|kit: West had difficult to evaluate -- he thinks king of spades worthless on auction.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree with Duboin pass|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|psyck: best even, or should i say beastial lead|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt not the best contract either.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 5@c is comfy, but normal to end in 3N|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@s to show a stopper I guess here. |pg||
nt|psyck: they may just not see enough values or shape to be in 5 level & with a different arrangement of cards 3N may be superior|pg||
nt|chick: Will N figure that one is enough?|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, S needs to be declarer in NT to protect that K, so perhaps best to just bid it now|pg||
nt|kareno: Kt9 doesn't need much  protection.|pg||
nt|chick: (if she's going to try for it)|pg||
nt|kareno: Zmudzinski led the A of @h in the OR against 3nt - definitely NOT best.|pg||
nt|chick: It could happen here too, if she shows a spade stopper|pg||
nt|kareno: But they won't lead a heart if west doubles spades, I'm sure.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only chance is try 3N with K10xxx in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: getting to 4 @S is questiong here |pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|rv: West employed garbage stayman here, intending to pass any bid by partner|pg||
nt|kareno: So this WILL be a pickup for Cayne.|pg||
nt|duschek: Actually, I seem to recall that Askgaard has told me that 1@S is 100% forcing to game. It is true that they used to be able to show 15 balanced and then stop below game, but they ...|pg||
nt|duschek: have abandoned this possibility.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: point alerts, but no written ones|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tarekr:  exact. A good tool|pg||
nt|rv: such auctions normally cry for trump lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hi again|pg||
nt|sybarra: re|pg||
nt|duschek: Instead they try to have 8 good HCP at least for their positive responses, hoping that 15+8 will often equal to game when necessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 15+8 = game, hmm|pg||
nt|bjacobs: that's not the math they taught me at bridge school|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have the play the hand better Bill :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: quite so|pg||
nt|duschek: 1NT is a relay, 2NT shows 8-11 HCP with 6+@S and a 4-card minor. 3@C asks which one, and 3@D shows diamonds, the distribution not being a 6421 type|pg||
nt|duschek: Sorry, 3NT shows diamonds etc.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: N and E whispering, can't hear it.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|duschek: So to sum up, West knows that East has 6+@S4@D, but not a 6421 type|pg||
pc|c3|nt|duschek: If East's whispering is loud enough, North will know that too|pg||
nt|sybarra: again,  faster than a speeding bullet |pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck: doesn't want to make 11 tricks as not in 5@c?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|tarekr:  Avons-nous des spectateurs Francais?|pg||
nt|rv: should go 1 down on accurate defense|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|kareno: Always justify your bidding!|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s opennig minimized the losses there i guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: all players on a break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: E probably a little careless with second club play seemed momentarily unhappy with W pass|pg||
nt|kit: not careless -- just trying to make as many tricks as he can.  Why should he suspect 7-1 split?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: everyone in a good mood two very evenly matched teams|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, they were tied at end of 1st set & scores still close|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hoverwev i would bid dbl over 2@S two suit hand weak|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because with a 2 suit hand 3@H can be a big risk finding long @D at the partner|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and bec i have the force to bid 3@H over 3@C|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h3|pg||

nt|Walddk4: so Fantoni must have led something|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tarekr:  When they bid 2 suits and we bid one of them it is natural unless other partnership agreement|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1D can be also 7/11 with @D or 16+bal without Majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: depends which|pg||
nt|ritong: rho's, yes|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|psyck: making W's decision easier|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, indeed.  As south, I would have bid hearts - anyone else?|pg||
nt|psyck: hmm 1N by N?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1N easy after the auction|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: sure, I'd stop doubling 2@h otherwise|pg||
nt|chick: the X is for a lead ... unless you have agreement with partner that it also shows a playable suit, I'd be cautious|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: is PO in the room? |pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: 1NT=clubs, any strength; 3@D=GF with 3@D5+@C|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|tarekr:  also lho because they bid short m's often|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ritong: also, béné and sylvie oplay "sandwich" 1NT as natural, i guess like a vast majority nowadays|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: I am surprised Von Arnim climbed up to 5@h in the deal where Willard-Cronier had misunderstanding to play in 4n, lucky she was not doubled|pg||
nt|tarekr:  sandwich is on the vane I believe.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Cronier closed screen and asked for a review of the auction, but was told it is too late|pg||
nt|rv: normally you lose less if both sides of partnership have bad result on same deal, IMP scale is such|pg||
nt|psyck: it has to be a suit also, cannot risk x otherwise|pg||
nt|kareno: You need a suit to make those doubles - otherwise you can end up defending 2@h redoubled :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: at 2L you have to have some lebgth else its too dangerous to act|pg||
nt|kareno: I think three of us are aligned on that subject :)|pg||

mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: This is what I was talking about before ... in Fantunes, you have to open 1NT on all sorts of shapes, including this one|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: it may not have mattered on that deal, but surely normal to make a noise|pg||
nt|psyck: not an easy call for S|pg||
nt|psyck: any votes? 2@d? 1!n? something else?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: All 5422 shapes, except both majors|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tarekr:  French 2@d Game force I believe|pg||

nt|rv: ok|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@d = any game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  2@h neg|pg||
nt|kareno: Perhaps 2@h.  Perhaps 1nt.  It is a tough choice and 2@d is okay too.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: on 41 N lead @D, and delarer in 6@H won and played @C|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@h also a possibility even 43 cannot be bad at 2 level|pg||
nt|bridge_one: KQJx over the sgl is the worst figure for N :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: So Shirley's guess of "red" was a good one|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: with very poor @s's, my preference would be for 2@d or 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: sylvie considers her hand as balanced, more precisely 3 of a minor would show seven cards, basically|pg||
nt|tarekr:  or always required|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|rv: on likely @s lead or shift, 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: men overboard here|pg||
nt|duschek: Well, if EW believe that 15+8 produce game, NS might believe the same for 12+11|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: S won @CA, and returened @D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: not more that 8 tricks for declarer - the defence is obvious|pg||
nt|kit: playing a club not safe now, as defence could cash winners and promote a trump trick if West has the queen|pg||
nt|ritong: and east 4:@s|pg||
nt|kit: or if East has 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, to promote the Q 4@S must be in east :)|pg||
nt|ritong: @ds a natural chance, yes, so declarer has to draw trumps without informations|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: I think 2@D is safest ... if partner can't stand it, then he has somewhere else to go|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|psyck: yes 2@d most normal, 2@h could lead pd to expect 4 with you|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Same total, 23.  And this deal just goes to show that 23 is usually not enough.  Even with the heart finesse on, and spades as friendly as can be|pg||
nt|duschek: They will probably complain that clubs do not behave as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Sorry, system froze after bidding on 41|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sure, the club is off, and that is a killer ...|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|kareno: Exactly and that suit bears rebidding.|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile, the Cayne team have extended their lead to 18 imps, bit by bit|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Lauria on a break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: back|pg||
nt|kareno: Lauria smokes so he's always running for a puff |pg||
nt|psyck: e.g., if the @s's were 53 you may end up getting a lot of ruffs in @h contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 4@S for E/W are possible to call|pg||
nt|duschek: So 23 HCP is normally all you need for a game|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: goddammit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|rv: ty Henri, Tarek can add this info to his encyclopedia if it is not already there:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: what is their 2@C opening?|pg||
nt|chick: as long as the defense doesn't lead hearts :)|pg||
nt|ritong: extremely|pg||
nt|psyck: possible to make, calling is the tough part|pg||
nt|duschek: We can learn a lot from watching these guys. They can too.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: back to remedial school for me, apparently|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: Helgemo bid 4@S (after a takeout double):  the pressure bid, but technically a violation of the Law ... and he was justly punished|pg||
mb|3H!|an|7-9 !S raise|nt|psyck: yes, they tend to do that when you least expect it, nasty people|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This 3@H bid, whatever it means, is legal, and probably successful|pg||
nt|duschek: I am not sure about the EW methods, but there should definitely be a bid available for showing a "Bergen 6-9" raise of spades. Perhaps that's 3@H.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Whatever your methods, Bergen, or any other, the point is this:  with a weak hand and 4 card support, you take yourself to the 3 level|pg||
nt|duschek: Agree|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|ritong: semi forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@s is XL, 2@d is XXL|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: 2@c*|pg||
nt|tarekr:  fg to 2Nt or 3 of a major Henri?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and being red,  doubt fluvio can come back in |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Spec suggests that at this vulnerability, 4@S is the right choice, but I don't agree.  The vul only changes the size of your minus swing|pg||
mb|d!|an|T/O|nt|ritong: i think responder can pass 2@c 2@d 2M|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h is support stronger that 3@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S is sufficient 13 hcp unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the "do something smart" X,    |pg||
mb|3N!|nt|duschek: Yes, that amounts to saying that the opponents will always make game at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  OK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nunes has a counter to it ... he asks Fantoni to "do something smart"|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Vugraphzfc: a reminder that our BBO score if off by one; Westheimer has one fewer IMP than shown|pg||
nt|ritong: regarding albarran, his carreer ended in the 50's, he started in 1935 to participate to world events|pg||
nt|rv: this lead should help declarer here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A sensitive auction by N/S, but they will struggle to make 4@D|pg||
nt|duschek: Of course, game may make, in which case 4@S will work out fine, but it is certainly not guaranteed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But a raise to the 3-level doesn't stop PARTNER from trying 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: not sure I approve of setting up the @SJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: so his convention must have seen the light in 1940 or so|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|duschek: Right - West should show his hand type, and East should make the final decision.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really important "bread and butter" competitive hand.  Much more instructive than those 23+8 things :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|chick: W was certain to have one of the royal honors|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: ace of hearts, king of diamonds, queen of spades.  Need 2 out of 3 to be right in order to make, so basically a tossup.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 15+8, I should say|pg||
nt|duschek: 23+8 should be enough for game though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: with a competent declarer, certainly |pg||
nt|bjacobs: anyway, this is a tough hand for Fantoni to play|pg||
nt|sybarra: the competent declarer is not an issue for this table |pg||
nt|duschek: This also needs about 10 overtricks to equal the result from the open room. Fantoni will get used to it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: over 20 minutes behind on clock|pg||
pc|d3|nt|duschek: Not many losers, but must be very careful|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|rv: so rare to see a convention last so many years|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: especially a heavy one like that one, but it has some positive aspects|pg||
nt|ritong: like knowing the color of a possible ace with responder|pg||
nt|rv: maybe Willard was better off to ruff a @d before cashing @cs|pg||
nt|kareno: Good heart shift|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I feel he needs to find @HJ, and it's in the less likely hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet he feels that trick is good news/bad news  trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, smells like 4-1 diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East being less likely to duck with @DKJx|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A strong spec has pointed out to me that maybe West is more likely to have @HJ in his 7-9 range|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Let's see, West has @SK, and nothing in diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So if East has @HA, then West must have the other two honours|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: small @D now|pg||
nt|psyck: game much better after South bids of course|pg||
nt|bridge_one: discarding 3@C in the dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: got no pigeon that time, kit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|chick: needed to switch to a red suit and diamonds was clearly out|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: Hmm, Fantoni has drawn exactly this conclusion|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|chick: the @SQ might have put a lot more pressure on declarer ... forcing a ruff|pg||
nt|kareno: Are we still waiting for Versace?|pg||
nt|duschek: Though the singleton diamonds counts for some of the 7-9 points|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rv: likely 1 down now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: could still ruff a diamond and throw E in with a spade|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|psyck: no, we are waiting for more exciting hands|pg||
nt|kareno: All in due course :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart now can promote an extra trump trick for south.|pg||
nt|psyck: ruff @h with 9, @d to A , pitch @dQ on @h etc|pg||
nt|kareno: I said 'can' not 'will' - west needs to be careful.  But a low heart is troublesome to him.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|psyck: trump Q before @da before |pg||
nt|duschek: Making now - East will get two trump tricks, but no more|pg||
nt|duschek: But that's 5 imps for Bjarnarson|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's only a partscore deal, but this is a really good hand, both bidding and play|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|xenya: 10 confirmed|pg||
nt|duschek: West must bid 2@D, as 2@H would be non-forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Transfer perhaps.  |pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|rv: @d lead would scuttle both 3n and 4@s|pg||
nt|duschek: Actually, with a minimum hand, 2@C denies four diamonds. 3@C shows a minimum hand with a club single-suiter|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|tarekr:  I think that playing only 4 in such an event is wearing even on the best of them!|pg||
nt|chick: 1@H shows spades over a 1@C opening ... the 2@S bid shows 5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2N raise of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: If Askgaard asks for distribution with 3@D, I wonder which lie Bjarnarson will prefer|pg||
nt|duschek: The system bid would be for Bjarnarson to open 1@D, but one can imagine why he hated that|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|Vugraphzfc: passing French mints around the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: 3@H would show any 6322, 3@S shows any 6331, and anything else would have shown at least 7 clubs|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: the atmosphere here has been very pleasant in this set|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: they are good (the mints)|pg||
nt|ritong: grr|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Good practical bid by Mike Passell.|pg||
nt|duschek: So he reasonably decided to show the hand as 3136, which is confirmed by 4@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Which leaves West in a tricky position|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: oops |pg||

pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|xenya: N knows S has the 9|pg||
nt|kit: Accurate defense no play now I don't believe|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer had won the first spade and gone after the red aces, the spade suit would have been blocked.  Should he have found that?|pg||
nt|xenya: also, as a few kibitzers have pointed out to me, declarer would have never ducked 1st spade wth AK9  |pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps he should "find it" as the best chance to make|pg||
nt|kit: But defense can counter I believe -- South unblocking 7 and 9 of spades|pg||
nt|kit: Well, maybe not -- then declarer ducks second spade|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rv: this is tricky hand to play, crucial @d9 might bail out declarer here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: and some other american associations, yes  plus d ovidio and her part|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|rv: best defense was @s back here|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|tarekr:  I think there are at least ten outstanding women's pairs in the world. Hard to rank them|pg||
nt|ritong: right|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think when partner leads an ace, and dummy tracks with a singleton, suit preference should be the key signal: not count or attitude|pg||
nt|tarekr:  A small come back for Monaco! This match should remain a nail biter|pg||
pc|c7|nt|duschek: It is not that clear. When you have no suit to signal for, you might wish you could just encourage|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rv: she could have postponed second @d since partner is unlikely to cash more than 2 tricks and doesn't have an entry to set-up and enjoy|pg||
nt|ritong: also, any sport is also a matter of form|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|d2|pc|s9|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: in the OR, N also led @SQ, but then fell out of grace by continuing with a small one|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: It is certainly not clear.  I made the point because I've seen articles/books where it's claimed you can do both, with very high cards, very low cards, medium cards, and I thiink ...|pg||

nt|rv: based on scores in last 3 brds, can't see too much opportunity for trailing team to recover IMPs|pg||
nt|chick: That hand has potential for a big swing|pg||
nt|psyck: kibs point out there cards wrong for squeeze|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and you should just have a simple agreement: suit preference, and damn the torpedoes|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, it is hard to show more than one thing at a time when you only have two or three cards to choose from|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - it is either or, cant have it both ways|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  2 more folks! We witnessed a certainly enjoyable contest!|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|rv: Joe, as per correct scores,Wesheimer trailing only by 16 rite?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no 18|pg||
nt|rv: 1 less?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  143-125|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|Vugraphzfc: right|pg||
nt|ritong: not an everyday's auction|pg||
nt|rv: ok, this could end contest|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Westheimer has 1 fewer IMP than we are showing|pg||
nt|chick: yes, some pointed that out to me as well, the entries were not good enough|pg||
nt|duschek: So 4 more for Monaco, closing in indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: entries would be fine on a minor suit lead though|pg||
nt|kit: Many pairs play this 2@H call as natural.  Either could work on any hand, but you better have solid agreements.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tarekr:  Al mentions that the last set of this match was schedule to start ten minutes ago :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: mrs breed might get disappointed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Quinn says "it's a first time auction for me, too"|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Mildred could have checked for aces though it is best not to comment about Quinn's pre-empt |pg||
nt|ritong: well..|pg||
nt|ritong:  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Mildredwas hoping for the spade ace, obviously|pg||
nt|psyck: still, NS can be happy that they only missed 7@d not 7N|pg||
nt|psyck: there was a confusion last set on this seq|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@H i suppose inviting in @S|pg||
nt|kit: If there is confusion here, E-W will be getting a very bad result in 3@H doubled|pg||
nt|duschek: 1ut=15-19, but could be a 4441 type of hand, though a balanced hand is of course much more likely|pg||
pc|sT|nt|duschek: 1NT=15-19, in case there are any English-speaking around|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Helgemo went 3 down in 1NT?   What is he, some sort of beginner?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|chick: There are plenty of other bids to show the other two suits, a cue is not needed, so it only makes sense to keep it natural|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by sementa instead 3@S becames GF|pg||
nt|bridge_one: mixed hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|psyck: on non @s or @h lead, there would have been a criss cross squeeze for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: well, the OR stopped in 5@D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: stronger would bid a cue |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: there will be a silence after that one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another suit preference|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: maybe not|pg||
nt|warrens:  Helgemo found out that S had 4 black cards and finessed the 10 of @D's.  in the endgame, he was squeeze-endplayed.  it was terrific defense with reasonable choices by declarer.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If West reads @D6 as an honest high card, he will make ... but is Nunes entirely trustworthy?|pg||
nt|duschek: Helgemo used the club entry for a diamond finesse, which is odds-on, a least a priori|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|tarekr:  One must laugh rather than cry when the 2@s card hit|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|warrens:  now I expect declarer to endplay N|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, North will have a hard time finding discards on the diamonds|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Soon or later. Later rather than soon :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll pitch one @C and one @H, then 3 rounds of @C's and he's dead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That 4th round of diamonds is a killer for North ... he will have to pitch a card he wants to keep|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfc: Quinn apologizes for her undisciplined 2@S;  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: He still has to guess who has @HA?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|duschek: So 6 imps for Bjarnarson - many exciting swings in this set, large and small|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|duschek: Strike my last remark...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Funny, the endplay only works if North has @HA|pg||
mc|6|nt|warrens:  ok, just 3 imps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If South has it, declarer has set up 7 tricks for N/S by "endplaying" North|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4 spades, 1 club, 1 heart and the long diamond with South|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Board 16 removed|pg||
