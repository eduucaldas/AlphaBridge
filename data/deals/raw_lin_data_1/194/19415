nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|kareno: Good day from Las Vegas :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rv: thanks Joe, we will remember that and 1 IMP could make a difference|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|psyck: The strong @c system may not work too well here allowing opps to possibly find a @d sacrifice|pg||
nt|kareno: I had the pleasure of losing to Versace and Lauria in a KO match earlier this week :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: N will be happy to hear 2@s by S|pg||
nt|kareno: The next KO fortunately we won so I can still show my face around here.  It was this exact team that defeated us.|pg||
nt|kareno: Did I say hello from Vegas?  I'm still in Toronto watching baseball games :)|pg||
nt|psyck: South has maximum for the earlier pass, no wastage in opps suit, & shape|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i hate the first pass... clearly worth a double|pg||
nt|bigtrain: now impossible to catch up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, assuming double was 5-7, it was certainly possible on 2@d|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree - now she hasn't got a good bid but 2@s will do.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Quinn:  you better play the spots off of this one|pg||
nt|rv: technically West invites and East accepts with max|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: staggering their way to the right place|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kareno: West never showed his diamond fit - |pg||
nt|ady: 1 imp to Cayne|pg||
nt|psyck: I guess W felt he had too much in def to bid more|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|rv: this could make if declarer takes a @h hook, plays for @hs 3-3 and @CA rite|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tarekr:  Exactly but Shawn is not taking any chances to miss game even though it is a non-vul one|pg||
nt|ady: meantime 5@D  only down 1|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|psyck: the 2@d could be a wide ranging hand too i guess|pg||

nt|puncher99: friendly lie of cards for NS if they can  get to the heart suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|an|12-14 Stayman|nt|santyclz: Nice @s "low".|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: Is this real|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yes it was.|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you operator/Ross|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: NS have more points than EW, about time they stuck their nose in|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Brave balance on that suit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: there will be a director at this table soon|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr for interrupting once. Sport by high level.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: 3@c?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: That's the bid.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I don't know what the 2@h means, but there was a lengthy conversation between|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Westheimer and von Arnim at the time.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz: Seems more likely n would bid that...|pg||
nt|chick: a hand to pass out :)|pg||
nt|peachy: West had enough, understandably.  She knows NS on shaky ground, doesnt need much math to figure that|pg||

nt|peachy: Would declarer have stranded spades on purpose if she had two of them?|pg||

nt|rv: if East doesn't open, will you open 1@d or 1n with North hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: the director was here getting the auction from a board in the last set, where there was some sort of appeal in the other room|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|tarekr:  when I am short oM, i generally will bid a good 4 cd major in 3rd or 4th seat|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ady: 6@C possible  but likely to play in 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tarekr:  support|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  shows 3 cd support|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ady: some wastage in diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: each bidding their weakness|pg||
nt|kareno: This looks like some sort of relay auction.  |pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: anything from 11 to 13 tricks in clubs |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: some might not show supp double with sub-min hand (11 hcp with Mildred)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: same auction in the other room to 3NT on 49, and they made an overtrick|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told 2@h was a gf|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|kareno: Club slam requires picking up the suit.  Stiff king in either hand twice as likely as stiff jack in north.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|tarekr:  I bet it is not going to be the same auction in other room on this hand|pg||
nt|rv: @s back could be best here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|chick: a stiff king in either hand doesn't guarantee picking up the suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|chick: so still same odds overall|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|rv: here both Mildred and Quinn could have shown restraint in second round of bidding, case for both to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: If you can get two round of clubs in safely then spades might break.  I'm not sure how I would play this in six.  |pg||
nt|psyck: picking up @c's is hardly 6%|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Lauria is a fine declarer... let's watch!  Heart lead best for the defense.|pg||
nt|psyck: a very poor slam, and both Q 1st & A 1st are equal odds|pg||
nt|psyck: it is just a question of J single with N or K single with S..about 6% on a @h lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: you have to add Jxx offside with xxx+ in spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Lauria is declarer.  Lynch on lead.  Without a spade lead it is easier but club suit still an issue.  Then spades a problem.|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, still say calling it 10% doesn't make it sound so good either :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Sorry, without a HEART lead |pg||
nt|bigtrain: so makeable if singleton K in S by picking up trump OR singleton K in N if S has xxx+ in spades|pg||
nt|kareno: No but remember the Italians winning a world championship because Kx of spades was in the pocket.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: Right it was clubs. |pg||
nt|kareno: Okay good lead.|pg||
nt|psyck: now all up to his table feel :)|pg||
nt|psyck: we are lucky to get an exciting start anyway :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|chick: my worst bridge nightmare, a two way guess for a slam|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he clearly chose the % line|pg||
nt|chick: I average about 7% getting it right |pg||
nt|ady: 11 imps to Lynch|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, A is better as you mentioned due to additional @s chances|pg||
nt|kareno: This was a total guess except that he knew two cards in south's hand, KQ.  That could have swayed him.|pg||
nt|kareno: King singleton either hand gives him a chance for the hand.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: 3 down|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|tarekr:  2 more tricks for W|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: He needed four spades in the south hand on his assumption she had Kxx in clubs.  |pg||
nt|kareno: So therefore the spade finesse - if she has four spades, then it is a better than even money finesse.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: If the hands are going to be like this it is going to be as looooong evening.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N|nt|sybarra: they tried 4 @S in other room on bd 33 for the save|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|Vugraphzfe: Both sides of the screen writing explanation of this sequence.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Must have been shortness rather than a minimum.|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  should easily come to ten tricks.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|santyclz: Let me take that back, n could easily go opposite a minimum with such good controls out of the suit.|pg||
nt|chick: yes, but still they are probably too high|pg||
nt|rodal f: A lot of cards are placeded now after S bid.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|santyclz: It didn't show a "subminimum".|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|santyclz: I'm told they play Ogust, in which case 3@c was "bad hand" "bad suit", surely an accurate description.|pg||
nt|chick: but she still went on to game?|pg||

nt|kareno: This IS Carolyn Lynch, isn't it?  Not Peter Lynch?|pg||
nt|kareno: Once the club ace drew the jack, that was the preferred line of play|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|rv: 3@d requires right @d guess here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: plenty of wastage in rounded suits for E-W, after South's entry into auction, Quinn should get @ds right|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|kareno: South fell in love with her hand.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: Cronier could have doubled 2@d to show @hs and @c tolerance (snapdragon double) which would have allowed Willard to compete in @hs|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|tarekr:  Very good point Venky|pg||
nt|rv: maybe too ambitious opposite a passed partner who bid 2@c at these colors, reasonable auction all around|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|psyck: after 2N, S's hand becomes worse, but some would open 4@s anyway 1st time |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: might be held to 6 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Not a bad 4@s opening bid and here she should gain IMPs.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bigtrain: forced to win 7 as e/w don't have requisite communication to win 3 @C tricks|pg||
nt|ady: if a spade comes now will have to rise with ace and exit with spade|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: I suspect Quinn will get @ds right here, especially after Willard shows @SA as well|pg||

mb|2C|nt|rv: 6@h good slam|pg||
nt|psyck: knows won't win it at 1 level|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: I think a 2@S bid is clear, if only to prevent 2@C|pg||
nt|kareno: In particular to keep e/w out of clubs.  |pg||
nt|psyck: with those good @s's, i prefer 2@s to 2@d rebid|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|psyck: a @h switch sometime will defeat this|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rv: if North leads a @c, declarer should draw trumps, pitch dummy's @c on @s and take ruffing finesse in @cs or guess @d for @c pitch|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|rv: 6@H lot better from East hand since declarer can first guess @ds before postponing @c play|pg||
nt|psyck: may not be easy to defend though|pg||
nt|kareno: The defense needs to tap dummy.  If east gets his diamond ruff it will be an easy hand for north.  |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|rv: all of this discussion is academic since @hs break 4-1 here|pg||

nt|chick: a couple of kibs are pointing out that there is a squeeze for 7C as well|pg||
nt|kareno: Right you are.  See you all later - have to run!!  Thanks to all :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tarekr:  if in 3 naturally in 5 LOL|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, the @sT is a nice card to have in 7N|pg||

nt|chick: first they have to get past the 5 level :)|pg||

pc|s6|pc|cQ|nt|rv: best defense was @s back here|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tarekr:  I think there are at least ten outstanding women's pairs in the world. Hard to rank them|pg||
nt|ritong: right|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: she could have postponed second @d since partner is unlikely to cash more than 2 tricks and doesn't have an entry to set-up and enjoy|pg||

nt|chick: That hand has potential for a big swing|pg||
nt|psyck: kibs point out there cards wrong for squeeze|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tarekr:  2 more folks! We witnessed a certainly enjoyable contest!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: Joe, as per correct scores,Wesheimer trailing only by 16 rite?|pg||

nt|tarekr:  143-125|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfc: right|pg||
nt|ritong: not an everyday's auction|pg||
nt|rv: ok, this could end contest|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Westheimer has 1 fewer IMP than we are showing|pg||
nt|chick: yes, some pointed that out to me as well, the entries were not good enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: entries would be fine on a minor suit lead though|pg||

nt|tarekr:  5@s showed 2 w/Q and 4@c showed 5@c with 2/3 top honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the unauthorized was what?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  2/3 top honors or better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: They are discussing....|pg||
nt|tarekr:  This is part of Jacoby 2NT structure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Not too sure what the issue is...|pg||
