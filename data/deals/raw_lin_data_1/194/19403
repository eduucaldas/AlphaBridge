nt|vugrapha4: Cool I'll let her know you're watching|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Deal 1 now starting - players sorting cards....|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not an opening of beauty|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: Hi Hans|pg||

nt|ianmcc: we start with a partscore no blood here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless you play a mini NT of course, say 10-12|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Mike :) |pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: and "right siding"  4 @H with transfer |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kemperg: what happened with the score of the first session?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ianmcc: good valuation West|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Germ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just as well that N-S do not; that would have been costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Wayne Burrows|pg||
nt|cascade: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A Smolen sequence for E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: well Smolen for west but not east :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West showing four spades and five hearts|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|bebechira: we have Cathy operating and she is doing a wonderful job|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Mundell, sry|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello everybody|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kemperg: and Ian|pg||
nt|haans: most would bid only 2@H |pg||
pc|dT|nt|cascade: 4@H looks a slightly better contract to me|pg||
nt|bebechira: youth final will be 4 sets of 10 boards|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|haans: bad 10 pointer|pg||
nt|bebechira: she is playing in NSW youth team...|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|cascade: the advantage of Smolen is that the strong NT hand gets to play the 5=3 fit if it exists (and you bid it)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: The upside of the Smolen convention is that you will always make the stronger hand declare the contract, provided that they both remember the convention|pg||
nt|bebechira: Victoria has a 29 imps carryover|pg||

nt|andyv:  1st board 1N by W and I thought the E hand was worth an invite|pg||
nt|kemperg: have to play with my grandchildren ( 4 and 6 ) at the same time :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have site with standings? |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I'll try my best to keep up with the players :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: the NSW ladies have a big lead after 1st set|pg||
nt|bebechira: the youth played a full 3 round robin ,and top2 teams qualified for the final|pg||

nt|mamos: EW play Precision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have the N-S convention card in front of me|pg||

nt|bebechira: tomorrow we will have Youth final as well.... 4 sets of 10 brds|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh good hope I am there and also see Cathy in finals |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  will EW find their @d game or 3NT|pg||
nt|cascade: might be hard for north to only invite here|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s hands fit well |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Unfortunately NSW didn't do so well with youth..|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|cascade: and then the defense need to establish their heart trick before declarer can build a club trick to beat 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which did not happen next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is a Bergen raise, limit|pg||
nt|cascade: five card support, two aces, two doubletons and vulnerable at IMPs i think i would be bidding game!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand a tad too good for that in my view|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  3@h may show min. with @ss|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@s a likely make, how good is it|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: hard to imagine south accepting her hand is as bad as it could be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree that Wood should sign off opposite a limit raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: next year Cathy!! |pg||
mb|4H|nt|cascade: some players make a limit bid then bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But Touyz changed her mind|pg||
nt|cascade: as Touyz has done here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: need diamonds 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Viv may get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Other suits are not attractive to lead from|pg||
nt|mamos: i guess this must be two-suiter weak South is presumably jst raising |pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike,  you happy with only 3?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ianmcc: but maybe @s Kx in pocket|pg||
nt|haans: but all honors working|pg||
nt|mamos: but you dont have @s10 so probably not one you care about missing|pg||
nt|cascade: i feel if you choose to consult partner then you should stick with that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would you lead, Wayne?|pg||
nt|cascade: its true but trumps are not that attractive either|pg||
nt|sybarra: magic hand,  as the @D are 3/3 |pg||
nt|sybarra: pesky that @H's are 3/1 |pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  I didn't think E had that option (to bid 4@s) but this should go down 2 (4@s and A@h), minimum|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|cascade: i like to attack but that is a guess here|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of tricks here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cascade: a trump will usually give declarer a tempo|pg||
nt|cascade: would you lead a trump Roland?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think I know what went through Touyz's mind. "I am not good enough for a Jacoby 2NT, and I am too good for 4@S. So I'll make a limit raise then bid game later. That should convey ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the message". Just a guess|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  please correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 8@s did not win the first trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  first spade trick that is|pg||
nt|andyv:  we may not be able to get a record of how the hand was played|pg||
nt|sybarra: little does she know |pg||
nt|mamos: may be if WA are already quite away behind there is a case for bidding  more|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry lost them|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: esp. red |pg||
pc|h9|nt|haans: if you do not pass 4@S you find many slams that will not make|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mamos: 5@S  is always a horrid thing to play -- no gain but lots of strain :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|mamos: so what options does declare have now ?  always important to concentrate on your target he must try for safest way to 11 tricks not worry about 12|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s6|pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Yes, I would probably lead a trump too as I know they have (should have) at least nine trumps between them. My second choice would be a heart|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ianmcc: howcome 11?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  I don't know what 2@h is here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strange when looking at four in the dummy|pg||
nt|cascade: and they didnt cash their diamond tricks |pg||
nt|bebechira: intersting hand... open room in 4s making|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  perhaps it's weak with majors|pg||
nt|haans: my vote for 3@H|pg||
nt|cascade: EW need to stay low with their distributional hands |pg||
mb|4H|nt|mamos: did he dperhaps draw trump and conceded Diamond?|pg||
nt|cascade: this is potentially 800 i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know that Viv would like to double, but I also know that her partner expects 4-4 in the majors for that, so she will probably abstain|pg||
nt|sybarra: W with a lot of points  but where to land? |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 3 nt?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  W has an easy 3N bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Oh, she did :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hands with voids are always difficult to evaluate when preempt openings|pg||
nt|bebechira: TD is Laurie Kelso...and he is trying to mantain a good "tempo" to all matches ...he is sometimes very strict with time at the club|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: that not best surely|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry  was distracted by my grandchildren|pg||
nt|bebechira: he offered 80 mins for 10 boards... lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: i think 90 would have been more generous|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to speed it a bit |pg||
nt|bebechira: we had last week Albena..and they were more generous there|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not be where W had thought she would play this bd if it goes all pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the @s holding is such that EW do have a @s stopper|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now he doesn't know which suit to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At this level I think you should have 4-4 if you are this weak|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow Max double din his room...more imps for ACT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  E should have little trouble getting 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wayne?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At the 2-level fine with me|pg||
nt|cascade: yes i would pass|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably we play with screens - 85 is the standard time for ten boards|pg||
nt|bebechira: we play with screens yes|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 80 is not very generous from Laurie|pg||
nt|bebechira: doubled in this room ..lol sorry for my spelling mistakes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cascade: partner needs a good hand to make anything|pg||
nt|cascade: and the odds favour her not having enough|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mercifully undoubled but it matters little as 3NT was made next door|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: this could be a disaster |pg||
nt|bebechira: i think this IS a disster :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: surprised no X but maybe didnt want to give hand away and afraid of another suit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: undo undo,  I bet there is a X |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry I missed the bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: but will claim at the end|pg||
nt|sybarra: Cathy,  no X?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I don't think so|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: The play will finish soon|pg||

nt|frankaus: or @DA then @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  or canape style...not sure it fits into any catagory except The Little Major system|pg||
nt|mamos: two good boards for Wellington|pg||
nt|kemperg: S happy he did notbid 2@D for majors this time:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: if east wants to bid over 3@D then i prefer 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  EW already getting too high|pg||
nt|haans: hard to see S cards as prempts|pg||
nt|athene: tricky lead decision for south here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: people often lead unsupported aces just because partner bid the suit and it usually costs|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand nothing is really appealing|pg||
nt|athene: that basically has to say "i have a 4@C raise but with an extra heart"|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: (yes seen it :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: seems slightly odd to bid 2@S   West is maximum (Precision) |pg||
nt|cascade: usually?|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have diamonds it's sort of good to emphasize hearts rather than clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely that 3 @H buys the pot |pg||
nt|athene: well, 3@H is as likely as 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  with a passed partner, there was little reason for W to bid again unless it's a system requirement in which case they may wish to modify some parts of their system.|pg||
nt|athene: ok, "very often" costs|pg||
nt|cascade: certainly if you have something better to do|pg||
nt|cascade: here south's alteratives were also unattractive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, I would lead a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let declarer fiddle around with the side suits|pg||
nt|bebechira: this will end it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: i guess 4@C shuts out 3@S from south|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: 2@S usually show extra|pg||
nt|kemperg: and his distribution|pg||
nt|basu_4139: extra with shape too|pg||
nt|mamos: but how likely was game ?|pg||
nt|kemperg: E no interest on 43 fit with max 15pts in W|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bebechira: 15-20 mins to go this session... and hey still have to play 25 as well|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cascade: how often are these trumps leads right Roland?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|mamos: @H position very favourable for EW|pg||
nt|mamos: if EW had ventured 4@H would they have pushed NS to 5@d?   I think so|pg||
nt|athene: very hard for south not to sacrifice with that hand once partner bids 3@D|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: 2@H looks like transfer|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  N unaware that 3N now is a laydown|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ianmcc: looks like 9|pg||

nt|sybarra: high cross ruff |pg||
nt|athene: auctions after 3m - 3M are nasty because most of the time responder just wants to offer the major but play 3nt otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: but opener playing the notrumps is not usually best|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder if 3 nt by W would have made sense |pg||
nt|athene: this auction was a bit weird|pg||
nt|sybarra: she might have gotten a @S lead from N|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: Fuller just called Director|pg||
