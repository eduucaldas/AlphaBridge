pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||

pc|sA|mc|10|nt|yke:  well done|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In Norway it's normal to play upside-down attitude and standard count|pg||
nt|athene: this was a sensible line because it would make if the trumps broke OR spades were 3-3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Waiting is part of a pairs game. 114 tables in play|pg||
nt|loe48: can it be made with trumps out as is not unreasonable here?|pg||
nt|friggi: yes due to that fact taht N hold all high @C's|pg||
nt|yke:  i dont think so|pg||
nt|loe48: if let club go to play another trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where is the 10th trick?|pg||
nt|athene: on a trump lead declarer can still prevail|pg||
nt|loe48: it still makes|pg||
nt|athene: @HQ, @H9, spades, draw trumps, @DA to reach dummy and the last spade|pg||
nt|loe48: 3 rounds of spades and draw trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But not will be tested after a club up from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: make five trumps and all four spades and the @DA|pg||
nt|friggi: N has to duck @C lead from dummy, which is very hard to find|pg||
nt|loe48: correct |pg||
nt|loe48: still have 10|pg||
