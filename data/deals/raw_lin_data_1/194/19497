nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Oliver|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N a bit too optomistic of N|pg||
pc|cK|nt|runnerup: ew are warned now -can they make rigth decision now+|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  but can't blame him since S simply asked for a @h stopper|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h a very marginal overbid, but you have four trumps |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hei SG|pg||

nt|mdgraham: and you shut out 2@s and 3@c from NS|pg||

pc|cT|nt|oliverc: Yes. West might have struggled in 2@H, but little chance for Declarer now|pg||

nt|penseur9: thanks Hilde|pg||
nt|runnerup: can be better than 3nt with @d out ,but still down because bad sits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Smart even|pg||
nt|oliverc: only 8 tricks, I fear|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @CK could have been onside|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That would still give West 12 hcp for his opener|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will have to find 3 pitches|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|oliverc: true|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: South played @c7 then @c9 - if normal-style caridng, that should indicate someting in spades|pg||

nt|Walddk2: does not matter|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sveing: yor are right|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  E didn't make things easier by making some silly bid showing the minors so N basically has to rely on his instincts and table feel on the @s suit.|pg||

nt|loe48: east have showed kq in club..so maybe put some values west also|pg||
nt|loe48: but still a pure guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  and, if he  decides W has the J@s, will have to finesse it immediately as entries to dummy are sparse.|pg||

mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Bj√∏rn Olav Ekren is the man behind the 2@D weak with both majors convention|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting Michaels (presumably) on five to the nine. Still, West has nice spades  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Goes without saying that he does not play it himself|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I used to, in one of my partnerships - but we gave it up |pg||

nt|oliverc: a fairly routine 4@S for NS here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|runnerup: 25 -ok anyway -easy gane|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the reason we gave it up is that in a competitive auction it was not easy sorting out the suit lengths|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in England most would respond as East - 1NT most likely|pg||
mb|3N|nt|penseur9: hi John|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is eith 26 Hcp -so top for defenders for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oliverc: everything well placed. Just 2 @S and a Heart to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N might be even more routine. @s suit so poor for NS that possible to lose 3@s tricks|pg||

nt|mdgraham: agree, prefer 2@S|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|andyv:  that probably was the most convenient play because of the entry to dummy and give N one more chance (stiff J@s), then playing immediately to hook W.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 6@D than 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because both contracts depend on @DQ|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|mdgraham: some very forward bidding next door|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|andersk: top 8 ATM can win, I beleve 9th and further will be too far behind|pg||
nt|sveing: 3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a good idea|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 2@D equal length in the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sveing: but i think he will bid that|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Karlsen knows to switch to a diamond when in with @HJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not unreasonable to do so|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: 4@s?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very unilateral|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as declarer is marked with @SAK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|penseur9: EW presently in first and NS in 17th place|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW did their job|pg||
nt|loe48: 1/4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|runnerup: greedy 3 @h -top was found already -now a lot of wotk to do|pg||
pc|hT|nt|loe48: 5h ask spade q|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|andersk: I think young Eide might be a little too agressive with a strong NT behind he's partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D5 was strange|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  S put to immediate guess|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: It complicates the defence|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|loe48: and 6s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that may cause problems|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c8|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  now in danger of going down|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|johnp: Easy to say: lead @h, but we see all cards|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes we agreeded that at once :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|loe48: doesnt matter to much the guess|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|sveing: maybe better to use K of @S the first time.. then it could be a lead from AQJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs to be careful now, otherwise East might be endplayed with a spade   |pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|andyv:  makes 4@c if he guesses to put in 10@h|pg||
pc|h5|nt|loe48: as u see here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|andersk: 2 down now|pg||

pc|h6|pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|sveing: not use the card evryone nows you have:)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Really?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: better|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: with @S9 high in dummy?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|loe48: but they to high..and in wrong spot to try|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West had to rise @DK there|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|loe48: 3nt is a fair try ..and shall be tried vul|pg||
nt|andyv:  but hard to bid after the major suit showing by W|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: and Karlsen failed |pg||
nt|mdgraham: to lead a club through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Had to swallow partner's @DQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: like a crocodile|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A rare Crocodile Coup|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c5|pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: serves West right for throwing away the beer card |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|loe48: i mean bid as you normally would bid without disturbance|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: expensive @D7|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  if N had dbld 2@c, then S might have bid 3N...as it was, S had to guess to bid @cs|pg||
nt|sveing: :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: no, we are wrong - East can lead @DQ and West can overtake  |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But she did not win the ace, did she?|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: this went quite fast|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, she didn't...so the endplay worked|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: yes, endplayed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She endplayed herself|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So if she is blaming partner, she must look in the mirror instead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: curious - on the play record she doid win @dA  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: thee, seven, six, ace|pg||
nt|sveing: well that board made this match closer|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW did well to drive NS out of their makeable contract(s)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 matches of 7 boards today, 4 tomorrow to end the week long festival|pg||
nt|andyv:  with lots of pairs using Ogust over weak 2 bids, the quality of the suit becomes less relevent...and multi 2@ds also has no requirement as to suit quality.|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: well played by Marstrander|pg||
nt|andyv:  final board of this set|pg||
