nt|Vugraph815: Hi everyone and welcome back to Örebro for the second last set of the final in the Chairman's Cup|pg||
nt|marlowepi: system or no, i would not open 1D in 3rd chair|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: pass is best as N but how can you know ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: It looks as if n-s play a 5/4+ 2 bid.|pg||
nt|psyck: re Ed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraph815: 3@h was GF asking for stopper|pg||
nt|muppe: Bubba had a very strong 2nd quarter, winning it by 39 imps |pg||
nt|muppe: maybe they play negative free bids so S didnt want to bid 2@s as it would be non-focing and he was afraid of that if he dbls partner may sit it|pg||
nt|tomi2: NS from Denmark, EW from Sweden here, very close match till now |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Clausen    Nielsen    N-S|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Ida from Lesotho|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not 1@h?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobholl: only on a @S lead 1 nt goes down|pg||
nt|santyclz: This contract shouldn't have any difficulty, just a matter of overtricks.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraph815: Hi all and welcome back to Örebro and the Chairman's Cup |pg||

nt|Walddk4: No, Lesotho|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: since E can be squeezed in @h & @c |pg||
nt|psyck: at the rate of 50's, this will not be a bad result for EW|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|muppe: 4@s by N is probably making so this could be a good score for EW|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Hello Wiliam|pg||
nt|muppe: hi|pg||
nt|athene: if north doubles 2@S that should be showing a trap pass of clubs, but tends to be takeout of spades for most|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|psyck: N may need to switch to @s on 2nd @c|pg||
nt|tomi2: it takes a lot of courage to bid 5@D facing a scandinavian 3rd seat non vuln 3@D opener :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: on this auction, the question you always ask yourself is, why didn't east open 2@H?|pg||
nt|athene: so he has to have a two suiter |pg||
nt|athene: and it pretty much has to be a red two-suiter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: two aces is enough reason not to open 2H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and bad hearts is a bonus reason|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: the scores were very close & even tied most of the time|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: well, some people say you can't open weak-twos with AA, but i think almost all the bad boards from that come from partner just not playing you for two aces|pg||
nt|athene: so once you tell partner you might have two aces, all problems are solved :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you seem to have a different personal database than I do on that particular point.|pg||
nt|athene: south presumably playing declarer for something like @SQxx in hand, to duck that trick|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|psyck: lol, there was no way N was going to bid anything :)|pg||
nt|psyck: I'm guessing Polish @c with transfer advances for NS & Precision for EW|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d4|nt|muppe: Just a matter of overtricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|doks: hi Krishna|pg||

pc|s4|nt|psyck: which was not difficult looking at the @c's in dummy|pg||
pc|sT|nt|muppe: seems 12|pg||
nt|muppe: 2@s was an aggressive balance. this time partner  has a great support|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: EW did well to defend passively, to restrict the contract.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: i would not expect people to play polish club with transfer responses because you really need a negative to 1@C|pg||

mb|1N|nt|psyck: those major T's were worth more than I'd have thought they were|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Hi again...I see the match going as wrestling clinch|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: and Ida, our brilliant operator|pg||
nt|athene: slightly passive of south to pass over 1@C i think|pg||
nt|athene: nice elopement there; declarer could even have made an overtrick if he had ruffed a diamond earlier|pg||
nt|santyclz: But by which side?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Walddk4: Sorry, Angelica it is|pg||
nt|doks: 11@S for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: @D T or small @S ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: she is also good|pg||
nt|athene: three small clubs is a flaw, certainly|pg||
nt|athene: but i would still bid 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: 1@H strong relay|pg||
nt|psyck: Mostly Precision style bids|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt was a very risky call in competition|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: what?|pg||
nt|athene: big danger pardy will take it as natural|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: yes, not great suit & unfav vul, but your hand is still ok to enter at 1 level|pg||
nt|athene: well, north finds the heart lead anyway|pg||
nt|athene: now NS might be able to untangle four hearts, three spades and the @CA|pg||
nt|athene: but they would still do better playing in 2@H, i think|pg||
nt|psyck: if S tries 3N now, it will not be a success|pg||
nt|psyck: 12-15 NT & 1@d=4+ cards for EW|pg||
nt|psyck: http://www.bridge.ee/KV/Konv/rubenis-germanis110703_2.pdf|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraph815: According to the methods of PO Sundelin|pg||
nt|psyck: @s for me too I guess|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 crds always pretty :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: he should make it:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|muppe: interesting  lead|pg||
nt|psyck: with values marked in S's hand...|pg||
nt|psyck: this is usually one of the rate times it is ok to underlead Aces, when you know the bulk of the points are sitting above you|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi again, had a bit of a technical difficulty there.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: *rare|pg||
nt|bobholl: a quick small one better than this :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, and with opps only in 1, you know you & pd will come in a few times to continue working on the @s's|pg||
pc|c7|nt|muppe: Maybe west could still have bid 2@h but his hand didn't look so temptating to compete|pg||
nt|doks: W have nice support for partner suit, 100 for honors in money game|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2nt was some sort of cunning relay for EW on that sequence uncontested|pg||
nt|athene: that's fine|pg||
nt|athene: but you sort of want to discuss exactly when system is on and when it isn't|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tomi2: not the best board for the NS methods, in other styles one of the players would habe bid 1NT in some point and become declarer there|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|bobholl: K of @H now (he knows P has 4)|pg||
nt|athene: has to be a spade now|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|psyck: E denied @s length in bidding|pg||
nt|doks: @D K ofside and no hope|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: luckily does not matter here with everything breaking fine|pg||
nt|doks: but now its ok|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|psyck: not easy for W to stop below slam once pd shows 6@s's & @hA|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: very hard for north to find that|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck: they ger the @d ruff at the cost of a natural @h trick|pg||
nt|athene: south hasn't had a chance to show any suit-preference either|pg||
nt|psyck: sry, W showed @s length would be more pertinent|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer just has to avoid losing two diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: i mean 1NT 2@C; 2@H 2NT uncontested was presumably a relay|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: after ruff, @HA, spade exit|pg||
mc|11|nt|bobholl: will be 1NT +1 i guess|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south could have been very creative|pg||

nt|tomi2: a weak nt vs 10 balanced seldom reaches game. maybe if some play 14-16 nt|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|psyck: a common strategem to underlead Ace with most values on left, not a success there|pg||

nt|santyclz: No problem.|pg||
nt|psyck: Any words flying now?|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  A lot of modern players seem to stretch a 15-17 1N to fit almost anything close|pg||
nt|psyck: 3rd seat fav vul 4 carder openings are common, but that suit...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting choice by S, wont come to harm too often and may be able to lure EW into a vul indiscretiuon|pg||
mb|r|nt|ritong: hello all|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, it was not opened after all :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: not sure he intending pass as a devious tactical ploy|pg||
nt|athene: he probably just counted his beans and found he only had five beans|pg||
mb|d|nt|gmarco24: 4@d is try for more, but no interest for Nielsen|pg||
nt|psyck: a Drury sequence|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d is presumably "3-card" Drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like he may need to guess @sK doubleton to make|pg||
nt|bobholl: with @D JT i 'd take the @HK|pg||
nt|psyck: hmmm, it would have been more useful to have running scores in earlier stages, than now in the finals with both tables on vu gr :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: For some reasons the players often forget that their 1st priority is to ensure that the vg operator can clearly see all their bids and plays.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: declarer will need to guess both majors to make|pg||

nt|doks: re hi|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: 6@h's 1@c ruff, need two @s's|pg||
nt|muppe: yes, and i think its findable as declarer will find E with the @cK and J and W overcalled|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think I would have tried 3N from W.|pg||
nt|psyck: they have certainly done very well to get to the finals here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: I would just bid 4@s on 2@d|pg||
nt|psyck: not sure it is worth doubling nv opps who freely bid game|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: interesting point of bidding whether east's pass there should be a penalty pass|pg||
nt|athene: most play it isn't, at the 1-level|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well lets count these beans:    Axxxx   Ax   x    Axxxx|pg||
nt|athene: (if he passes the redouble i mean)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: Seems a little likely to tell them how to make it.|pg||
nt|psyck: the double may help dec restrich trump loser to 1, & 1 black suit loser each|pg||
nt|doks: this time good lead, it will be hard to manage this contract due to unfavorable minor position|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then you may play 1S instead of 5C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|muppe: so after that W is pretty much marked with @sK|pg||
nt|psyck: good point|pg||
nt|psyck: S should be careful not to get endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: opps will balance then and push you into 5@C and double it to boot :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: some might not bid michaels with west as it's "middling" strength but showing 5-5 majors is worth a lot, and after 2@D there is room for either player to invite|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz: For example, if s is expecting to lose 2 trump tricks anyway, he could play the ace then 4 rounds of @ds pitching a @c |pg||
nt|psyck: dec will likely go down at least 1 as unlikely to get @h right either|pg||
nt|doks: live scoores are completely dead at this moment, so we have to wait|pg||
nt|Vugraph815: there is still a loser bracket with some matches :)|pg||
nt|doks: good news for Latvia, no DBL|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: they might, but relying on them to make our bidding adequate is a dangerous policy|pg||
nt|athene: anyway, on the auction as it went, i don't much like 2@H from east|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|muppe: well and quickly bid|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: the most expensive call on a poor suit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  On the other hand, without a @h lead, 4@s would go down|pg||
nt|psyck: stopping in 3@s may work here (on a passive lead); but I do not understand 3@d - it's not like you need help here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: wgy not a @S and hope @D K rigth ?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: 1nt or 2@C might well be better|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|bobholl: why|pg||
nt|doks: this is only entry to dummy, and @H problem passed succesfully|pg||
pc|hT|nt|doks: now only 1 down|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: dec cannot guard against @hKT9x, so should have tried for single T/9 with E|pg||

nt|doks: W was in very scaary position and -200|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|psyck: yes, many play split range for 2 suiter bids, but maybe not when vul|pg||
nt|muppe: W knew N had only @s left so @h was the only option|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: personally, i prefer to do it with any point range|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|santyclz: In that case s might have gone down *because* of the x...  It doesn't happen often, but it does happen.|pg||
nt|athene: strong club for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: many would upgrade that east hand to a positive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: others would have a specific way to describe it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or make a 2@h semi-positive|pg||
nt|athene: i guess they have strict control requirements, say 3 controls or maybe 5 AKQ points|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|psyck: 3@c game try & will find game|pg||
nt|doks: dubious dbl imo|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a little doubtfull double|pg||
nt|Vugraph815: could have ruffed the spade and exited in diamonds to end-play south|pg||
nt|doks: 3@D looks like limit rise in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: asking bid?|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a huge fan of the traditional 2major semi-positives in response to 1@C as they wrongside the contract and they are not usually hard to show later|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|muppe: quite suprising pass by N in imps|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s could be weaker, still should be reasonably constructive vul|pg||
nt|athene: limit or better - i can't believe he wasn't going to GF it|pg||
nt|muppe: Convention card says limit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you mean, wrongside the contract later instead of sooner?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gmarco24: high enough. good stop|pg||
nt|gmarco24: W might cash A@s to see the dummy now|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: after dbl @HK lead very likely, not succes|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s after x shows 3 card @s|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: natural consequence of dble|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@d would be limit raise+ hand, so 2@s is less than that & a normal constructive raise|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes, S has almost the most suitable hand for N|pg||
nt|psyck: N had enough shape & values & should normally make a try for the vul game|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@D a bit ligth now|pg||
nt|doks: only limit http://www.bridge.ee/KV/Konv/rubenis-germanis110703_2.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: I dont know their range for 2@S vuln but facing a partner who passes aak in 1st seat 2@S might sometimes backfire and make you miss games|pg||
nt|athene: well, if you start with 1@D you have more chance to rightside than if you start with 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H sorry|pg||
nt|athene: for example partner might bid something obliging like 1nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i know, was just joking:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobholl: 1 trick in every colour so seems to make|pg||
nt|gmarco24: no possible ruffs in dummy, so @c switch could be look for partner's ruff|pg||
pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: 3C probably showed degree of support & controls all at once|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S might be something like the old roman club jump, asking partner about his hand strength and spade support|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well it ended up where it was always going to end up anyway...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that jump was incorporated into Belladonna & Garozzo's Super-Precision also|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 1@D; 2@S in roman club asked partner to show his controls and support by way of a nine (!) step matrix|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: playing transfer responses to 1@C you have 1@S denying a major so 1NT doesn't have to be natural|pg||
nt|muppe: But maybe he was anyway going to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|doks: we have new leaders, but only by IMP|pg||
nt|athene: ducking at trick 1 would be right if north had five spades|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: @d to hand and a @s, just in case|pg||
nt|athene: but no reason why he has to have|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: Intermediate at vul for them I guess|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|muppe: N is probably likely to have less than 5 spades after he didn't overcall|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: slightly unexpected decision in diamonds there|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would finesse @D now but after @D K and @S back he has a guess |pg||
nt|santyclz: Not the auction s had in mind when he picked up his hand.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|ritong: no real reason to throw a trick away when there is @s Kx onside|pg||
nt|athene: with so much strength, declarer is just going for 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: so it looks normal to put the @DQ in at trick 1 ensuring you don't lose a diamond quickly|pg||
nt|psyck: as the cards are S could have been endplayed in @c for 2nd overtrick if Q played 1st trick|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@h also needs aggrement & pdship understanding|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobholl: tof @D now but will he guess that ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: after the @DQ holds (or gets covered) you play on the black suits|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: can be profit for Latvia ?|pg||
nt|doks: @C A allmost for sure on N|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 0 or 3 i guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @C lead 6@H will fail|pg||
nt|gmarco24: this contract might get tougher than it looks|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|doks: complete tie now, what a final|pg||
nt|athene: KQ doubleton is not usually great, but west's @HKQ are sort of worth about four tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: this will be down at least one|pg||
nt|muppe: agree it was too balanced hand to bid at 4-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: it's not easy from N's hand to see the right defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: E could have bid 2@s to ask his pd for his opinion about playing game|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i guess he is not kind of players who like to ask  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i prefer 3D over 3C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: not double dummy though :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but if ducked will w continue @C i doubt it|pg||
nt|gmarco24: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: with a friendlier split in suits of course 4@H would be no problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: interesting hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bid what you have?  What a concept!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still plenty of time to get to NT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: how do you make if you take the A @S & growing :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: quick 7 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psyck: flatish result as EW make minor partial|pg||
nt|muppe: and "the law" was against it too|pg||
nt|athene: if west had passed it might go 1@C 1@S 2@C and now i suppose east could double but he might not|pg||
nt|athene: west might be contemplating a trump shift now|pg||
nt|athene: with the idea that his partner can get in later and play another, stopping a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think 2@D was GF|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d probably means " i have a good hand"|pg||
nt|gmarco24: declarer is still ok, no matter if ruff comes with 9 or something else|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: or good hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: i much prefer showing features, but..|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, the contract is decent|pg||
nt|psyck: They got to 6@s other table too|pg||
nt|psyck: I'm guessing @c9 will not be lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: declarer's problem will be managing entries in order to be able to cumulate chances|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: so 3@D over 2@H might well not have been|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: adding a drop in @ss to the @d hook|pg||
nt|hedyg: should he have trusted N who seemed to think his pd could overruff dummy?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not, but 3C wasnt either?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: ew took pains to get east to declare the hand, wrong-siding it on the @D lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: this meanwhile is a more comfortable spot|pg||
nt|psyck: S needed to play @hA 1st trcik & then a @s, to use the @c entry for @d pitch on @s, for -1|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|gmarco24: @c discard  :/|pg||

nt|marlowepi: and there is still time for 3N if E wants|pg||
nt|athene: and the guy with Hx support never shows it|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: On the 4@hx-1 hand, s wasn't x'd and made at the other table.|pg||
nt|doks: maybe safer take second @H with K and preserve @H ruff for better days|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: then @s AK, no smile, then two entries in @hs to take @d finesse twice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then spades, heart, diamond hook, heart, diamond hook again|pg||
nt|psyck: deal 20, S bid 3@d instead of 2@s other room, I think that is aggresive with a 4333 hand & 9 count.|pg||

nt|doks: 1@H=5+@S|pg||

nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|psyck: E did well not to open that hand :)|pg||
nt|muppe: If played by E, After @cQ lead and two rounds of @c N should find a @d shift to beat it. Not an easy one, the previous board|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck: shows 5 card other major & @c with about 8.5 tricks in hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: not so normal with that weak @h suit....|pg||
nt|muppe: Mayby not but it could the only chance to get @h suit to the picture|pg||
nt|hedyg: now the lead is @D instead of A@H|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i like 4C|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@c is aggresive|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|psyck: Strong @c opening, negative response, double for majors|pg||
nt|hedyg: but W should switch to @d thinking E has something like AQ|pg||
nt|psyck: My Results & Other table tab in Web Flash version|pg||
nt|psyck: now will go overboard as cannot stop in 3@d|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: but after 2@d justice|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 7@D not so great here because you are short an entry to ruff the spades good|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: right, but when do it North can win years defence award|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think if you are going to bash in a slam like this where you are fairly sure you have the tricks, but you might be off an AK, it's best to bid it in notrumps, because people lead ...|pg||
nt|athene: less aggressively against 6NT|pg||
nt|doks: 2@D asking for support quality, 2 @S probably xx|pg||
pc|h8|nt|muppe: 3@d is making easily|pg||
nt|psyck: they discovered the lack of @d cue|pg||
nt|athene: probably best to just stay out of them altogether tho :)|pg||
nt|psyck: a simple 3@d on 2@d would be more natural|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gmarco24: anything but diamonds  :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: that slam was a perfecto|pg||
nt|hedyg: Johansson knows something we dont know :)|pg||
nt|psyck: does @d shift beat on that line?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will try to force opps to discard badly for some overtrick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: basically on trump finesse|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: if 5@C makes then 3nt is going to as well but 3nt might go more down of course if the @CK is off|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|ritong: due to @c xxxx facing the void|pg||
nt|bobholl: they stayed low so will make but @H guess was unlucky|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Johansson is not a lady, that's for sure. ladies LIKES diamonds|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 7@d can be maded on @h/@s squeeze against North|pg||
nt|psyck: the @d shift has to come by South, before the 2nd @c that line|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|muppe: yes right|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|psyck: oh well, only 50's|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: point count has nothing to do with how many tricks you make on hands like this|pg||
nt|athene: you cash the @HA first just in case someone has @HJxxx, but still it's hard to get excited about this hand|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer can safely draw trumps then ruff a spade|pg||

nt|athene: on a heart shift there for example he could ruff his boss heart, ruff a diamond high, then draw trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: you mean you could not bid on the 1 level but you could bid on the 3 level?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
nt|doks: on normal trump split 4@H makable|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: they have to be carefull not getting to high in @C (or @S other way)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraph815: Mr Hayes has this habit of leaning over the table almost flashing all his cards to the opponents, not very appreciated by his partner|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D= majors|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room 2@C made on the line you suggested ( win heart immediately and play spade)|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N is the best spot, but not obvious to reach|pg||
nt|psyck: may have to get @hJ right here to make 4@h|pg||
nt|doks: 3@H=pre|pg||
nt|athene: since you can still go for normal or backwards heart finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Landy style 2@c for majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to George Holland |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@S is a tad high but understandable|pg||
nt|hedyg: S could pass imo|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gmarco24: what's the bid to ask for both stoppers?|pg||
nt|hedyg: N has no defense, must bid on|pg||
nt|tomi2: freaky hand, dias 5-0, clubs breaking but blocking. a spade lead will cut them off in every contract|pg||
nt|psyck: has chances on 41 splits too|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: on unnormal split 4@s makeable too|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: N will not be please with this response :)|pg||
nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
pc|h7|nt|muppe: 2@s by N to get the @s lead would have worked|pg||
nt|muppe: now this makes|pg||
nt|muppe: Hi George|pg||
nt|hedyg: E bidding his hand...again|pg||
nt|athene: on the heart lead declarer can't get cute; just has to take his nine|pg||
nt|psyck: no, even that does not help i think|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bobholl: N has a difficult decision his @S say double but the rest of the hand says passsss|pg||
nt|tomi2: on the other hand spades blocking for defenders as well|pg||
nt|doks: E hopes for final contract materialises|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: I would always bid my better major on that auction|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c was more Aspro style, where the bids are @h oriented|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C and a small @H i guess|pg||
nt|athene: he can run the clubs but south just throws two small spades, two small diamonds and a heart, without any great pain|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck: playing transfers over 1M-(x), 2@h would be available for a good raise & 2M would not promise anything much|pg||
nt|muppe: Today it's rather standard to use transfers after oponents t/o dbl of 1M|pg||
nt|gmarco24: like "he didn't see my last bid, let's now bid twice"?  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ...but North should ruff highly @D leads|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: well i will have to run, but i am pleased i got to see this hand bid|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gmarco24: ok. thank you Hedy|pg||
nt|doks: 3 loosers in side suits|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ...though 10 tricks is always|pg||
nt|psyck: but if dummy is punched...|pg||
nt|psyck: cannot draw all trumps & no time to set up @c...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: just goes to show that we all have problems with distributional hands|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@S on the board where our table stopped in 3 made with an overtrick on a trump lead. club was requiered to beat the contract I think|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you get the @h right you only have 3 losers, but I don't see how to get 10 winners...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: they just are not in the book :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: XX?|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh ok, operator joke :)|pg||
nt|athene: this will play very well|pg||
nt|athene: i think the defence would have done better to just lead more hearts|pg||
nt|doks: @H at every opportunity|pg||
nt|athene: how about the @S9 now, intending to run it?|pg||
nt|athene: declarer basically wants to draw enough trumps to be able to run his clubs without getting too many ruffed|pg||
nt|athene: but he wants to leave trumps in dummy to control hearts as long as possible|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bobholl: now N regretting his non double (P wants @D obvious)|pg||
nt|psyck: Journalistic lead i guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess  135|pg||
nt|psyck: oh, ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: there goes the @c loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We can't understand how 2@S went down on board 4 when East did not win @HK|pg||
nt|hedyg: when you have AKQ is it so hard to lead the suit?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: so he will want to duck one or even two early rounds of spades if he can|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: only a 1st round @h fin would have helped|pg||
nt|doks: maybe better defence line is shortening dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: dec does it for them :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: According to MOVIE declarer had 8 tricks then|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, transfers in general allow you to show additional hand types (at the cost of a natural bid).|pg||
nt|daman: nice way to draw trumps :)|pg||
nt|doks: but then can play on cross ruffs|pg||
nt|doks: Latvia retake the lead, by bidding 3NT in open, where W play 2@C -2|pg||
nt|athene: yes with a very odd-looking 3nt bid from north|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might lead the @S9 just intending to duck another trump|pg||
nt|athene: and find he doesn't actually have to lose one|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psyck: only 9 on x ruff|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: no, any non @h lead could beat it|pg||
nt|psyck: which is purely double dummy :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c8|nt|muppe: well, in other room N indeed bid 2@s but S still chose to lead a @c|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: as only 7 trumps & 2 @c|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: sometimes best to claim such deals early in long matches, but usually doesnt hurt to torture opps for a while either|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 1st tricks mistake...he should ruff highly, play 1x @s then 3x clubs|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tomi2: declarer played a heart to the 9|pg||
nt|psyck: needed the 3rd @c trick, which he can get only if dummy is not shortened|pg||
nt|doks: now some trouble start|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: good board for teaching declearer play|pg||
nt|Vugraph815: heart ruff, club to ace, heart ruff, club to king, club to west who have to give a ruff and sluff so declarer makes his last trumps seperately|pg||
nt|Vugraph815: might work?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tomi2: qt ws onside|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, S misdefended by not playing T|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: mm|pg||
nt|gmarco24: J@d was overtaken by A@d, Roland. dunno|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: this isn't completely safe|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: making 2|pg||
nt|doks: ruff 3rd club and exit in trumps|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: not ruff but put the @S:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: if you trust partner you continue diamonds|pg||
nt|tomi2: if he plays the ten north must finally open the clubs to avoid a discard|pg||
nt|psyck: oh, you are right, @c lead was reqd|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: east might be able to ruff  in and lead a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: and if west has @DQ10, the defence have a diamond set up|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe it was a reasonable percentage line|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: it makes if west has the trumps or if east has the @D10|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s8|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: west didn't believe north had led away from his @CK|pg||

nt|muppe: This might provide some action|pg||
nt|psyck: at some time anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2: club switch was enough, I take it back|pg||
nt|doks: possible good board for Latvia|pg||
nt|Vugraph815: declarer did in fact ruff second trick high, but still came a trick short in the end|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe he shld have gone up with the queen anyway|pg||
nt|athene: unlikely to cost that many more tricks|pg||
mb|4H|nt|santyclz: Back to a tie...|pg||
nt|psyck: once @h's were played, there was no way to make unless defense slipos|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: that's still making, right?|pg||
nt|athene: if you play low you are giving up making the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: South is unlikely to sell out below 4@S|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 4@s now would put W on the spot|pg||
nt|muppe: What now by S?|pg||
nt|daman: 4@S|pg||
nt|doks: interesting what happens on initial @H lead|pg||
nt|athene: as they will surely shift to spades eventually|pg||
mb|4S|nt|muppe: W will bid i think|pg||
nt|daman: sure    5@C|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt from west now|pg||
nt|athene: to show 5+hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: even if it was weak NT, not a clear pass by E|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange E didn't try anything even opposite a weak no trump i want to try 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: it s not even trust, it is common sense|pg||
nt|doks: do You dbl with E cards, if its not strictly 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: doesn't really wrongside 3nt that much - this time|pg||
nt|santyclz: W forgot to alert his 4@h as a transfer to 4@s (by the opps)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|psyck: both 4@h & 3n make, 3N easier though|pg||
nt|santyclz: Krishna, do you know e-w's 1nt range?|pg||
nt|psyck: no :(|pg||
nt|psyck: other table, they got to a doubled @s contract on the 1@sx deal, 3 levels higher than here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|muppe: NS probably playing strong club as it could be dangerous pass that S hand in natural system|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ritong: after all, maybe west is out of @cs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psyck: W know 2 @s losers, bidding on is expected for no @c loser...so was not obvious to bid & will not work here as well|pg||
nt|psyck: oh, the @d's lay well, did not see, so can make|pg||
nt|psyck: doubt he will try for it though|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: low @s lead will test declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: with the bulk of the values known to be with N, underleading A is a possibility|pg||
nt|psyck: lead, defense could cash top @d & @h & switch to trump, still cannot make|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: now dec will likely just lose 1@s & 2 trumps|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think so too, underleading the queen might cost a trick as well, as in that 3/4@S board and you are more likely to find the king in dummy and jack in hand here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C some sort of ask, maybe looking for four spades or a sixth heart|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|doks: 1NT shows 5+@H|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psyck: now will need vavorable @s & @d|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||

nt|psyck: 4@sx by E|pg||

pc|s2|nt|bobholl: i do agree with johansson that he downgrades his hand|pg||
nt|psyck: oh, was expecting @c ruff|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck: yes, strong @c was opened on 1st deal this set|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|doks: now defence can make @D honors separately|pg||
nt|psyck: If you play Good Bad 2NT here, you have more options as East|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|psyck: yes, needs an extra @d trick too|pg||
nt|athene: now he has a squeeze on east for the overtrick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: & dec to take the trump back & play @c|pg||
nt|psyck: had a chance to ruff 2 @c's high when defense played @c|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: no, he will just plod away at hearts|pg||
nt|athene: ok i wasn't expecting the deep finesse there|pg||
nt|Vugraph815: didnt see if he played J or 9 on second @H round|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok|pg||
nt|psyck: Latvia mainly gained on 3 slam deals|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hQ|nt|psyck: I guess they play some kind of Polish @c with weak NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: K&R values the e hand at 13.3:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=aq86+kq7+k42+872|pg||
nt|psyck: or maybe 14-16 NT, obviously not an upgrade here|pg||
nt|psyck: if not, double plannig to correct 2@h to 3@c ok|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: tilt|pg||
nt|psyck: @hA & @d fin would have worked there|pg||
nt|psyck: hut he chose the wrong finesse|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|tomi2: good switch by larsson|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h6|pc|c4|nt|athene: south knows the only way the defence have any chance at all is if declarer misguesses the @S9|pg||
nt|athene: so he really wants to get his partner in for a spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe leading the @CJ was better|pg||
nt|athene: trying to force an entry into north's hand|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|doks: but partner discards @S, so no more problems in that suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: I wait on three way 2 NT Good Middle Bad, that offer moore options:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|athene: you want to show your shape so partner knows when to bid 5@H, but maybe 4@D shows more high cards than this|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: or put the faster players in the closed room :)|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|psyck: thx for the update|pg||
nt|athene: rare to get enough at the 1-level, especially at these colours|pg||
nt|psyck: may work out to be a good choice to bid 1@d instead of 1@h|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, I meant E|pg||
nt|athene: can't you just concede two spades and a diamond and crossruff?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: but they might do it here if they start with @HKQ and then shift to a diamond|pg||
nt|psyck: E's good judgement in not opening deal 22 fetched 13 imps|pg||
nt|doks: invitational or @C|pg||
nt|athene: so responder can use it with a notrump invitation or club hands|pg||
nt|doks: 2NT=min|pg||
nt|santyclz: No, that's too easy.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we were talking about style points:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: you're doing fine ida :)|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if west will be able to ask for a diamond with his trump spots|pg||
nt|doks: down 1 looks like|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can knock out the @SA for eight easy tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psyck: 3@h informs W of the sourse of trick, so just a matter of checking key cards after that|pg||
nt|muppe: depends how strong hand 3@h showed|pg||
nt|psyck: it should be a suit playable for max 1 loser opposite a void|pg||
nt|psyck: so with Jx, W knows it is running|pg||
nt|daman: this should be enough to move to slam|pg||
nt|doks: very lucky @S position, so 3@S, 2@H, 2@C and @DA|pg||
nt|athene: how are the spades lucky?|pg||
nt|doks: at some point @D10 switch can be good|pg||
nt|athene: i would normally expect to get three tricks from that suit as declarer|pg||
nt|athene: when in form :)|pg||
nt|athene: south is wondering about ducking the first heart|pg||
nt|athene: that would be right if partner was getting in first |pg||

nt|santyclz: This has been a quite low-scoring match, 97 boards, 197 imps.  Those 13 imps may decide the match.|pg||

nt|ritong: the kind of convention which works ok when opponents stay quiet, and even so|pg||
nt|muppe: well played, a part score swing for Bubba|pg||
nt|daman: that was a wet pass by East|pg||
nt|psyck: both could bid a bit more|pg||
nt|gmarco24: not one level, only one bid too high, but, still too high|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so errors from both sides there, which is normal enough in a low-level contract|pg||
nt|athene: EW won't be unhappy with 500 as 3NT is not certain to make|pg||
nt|santyclz: 97|pg||
nt|athene: that would mean he started with 4-5-4-2 shape|pg||

nt|bobholl: 7@H on but not biddable i guess even 6 may be too difficult|pg||
mb|1H|nt|psyck: Deal 7, Other room, declarer made the mistake of claiming the contract on the lead forgetting the possibility of @d 5-0. |pg||
nt|doks: 1 or 2 by S?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psyck: Director probably adjusted the result to -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a lot of 1@C openers this set :)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|athene: when you play 1@C as 2+ clubs you do open it a lot|pg||
nt|athene: because so many hands are boring balanced 12 counts|pg||
nt|psyck: much lesss actually|pg||
nt|doks: I will bid 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: not the poster child for an unusual 2nt overcall - empty suits, aces, and @SK much more likely to score in defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: a fast 4@H i fear :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: or 2@D :)|pg||
nt|doks: our results comes faster than on website, so actual score are showed on left corner|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|psyck: so, similarly, this a weak 2 in @d or strong @c?|pg||
nt|ritong: probably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well here it worked as a transfer, which does have some advantages|pg||
nt|psyck: Director was not called apparently, the players agreed on -1|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: @H?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: wow|pg||
nt|psyck: 16*3 plus the 6 comparisions this set|pg||
nt|doks: by E, not pass 1NT|pg||
nt|doks: 2@S looks completely normal|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told west's 2nt over 2@S would be GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: NS stole the contract|pg||
nt|daman: the theives|pg||
nt|psyck: he cannot take any finesses once he claimed, so they can exit in @h & take him down|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: its seem clear?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|muppe: missed game for NS, cards are well placed for 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: tuf one|pg||
nt|athene: if redouble was the normal penalty bid then you would expect south to double|pg||
nt|athene: was redouble showing hearts, maybe?|pg||
nt|athene: well, double of 2@H from south obviously doesn't show a good suit :)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's t/o of spades, or showing BAD hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the so-called "anti-lead double"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|muppe: but wasn't easy to bid|pg||
nt|daman: thieves*|pg||
nt|athene: even so, 2@C on a mediocre 5-card suit isn't obvious; pass or 1nt were possible|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3@D was his only non-forcing option|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daman: 9 toppers in NT for EW|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|tomi2: but how can the contract go down?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ach zoooooooo, I somewhere got the impression it was 32 bd qtrs... sorry.|pg||
nt|psyck: I was about 3.5 imps per board before this set|pg||
nt|psyck: *It was|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: when you play 2@C as 2+ clubs, though, there is a case for rebidding with "only" five a bit more often, just to let partner know you do have a club suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|muppe: or 5@c is making|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: 6@C makes|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|gmarco24: with Jxx holding in @s Nielsen decided to attack entries in dummy|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|daman: no   only 5|pg||
nt|athene: i don't believe a word of this :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck: @s blockage does not matter, they exit in @h & endplay dec again|pg||
nt|psyck: which is still lower than usual|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: hm|pg||
nt|athene: why wouldn't east just take his @SA and shift to a heart?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: W expecting too much @c wastage with pd for 1@cx pass|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tomi2: but he has 5@D tricks ak clubs and two aces|pg||
nt|psyck: oh yes, indeed|pg||
nt|tomi2: the claim means i take the ace of spades, run dias and cash my aces|pg||
nt|psyck: that must be it|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: who say - when You have AK in one suit You have nt leads problems?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|muppe: maybe west should have find a bid|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|santyclz: Still low scoring by modern standards but not the quite low I thought.  |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|tomi2: so imo it should be adjusted to just made because he was sooooooo lucky to get the spades blocked|pg||
nt|tomi2: on any other layout i would adjust to some down score but not on this|pg||
nt|psyck: it is certainly unfair for the result to be -1 that deal|pg||
nt|tomi2: and even if he starts with spade ace, heart ace running dias he will win|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psyck: right|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: maybe they will appeal later|pg||
nt|tomi2: or spade ace heart ace ak clubs and rund dias works as well... so any careless but not stupid play will win|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: very deep finesse coming up|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: hmm|pg||

nt|psyck: you cannot do exclusion without setting trumps 1st|pg||
nt|gmarco24: good declarer play|pg||
nt|othered1: with no distributional storms EW, 3N costs 2 imps v. 4@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the "Old Days" when bidding wasn't as competitive, low was considered 2 imps/board, now it's more like 4.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|doks: 1@S=reds or blacks from 4-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|psyck: that may well be what happend, Angelica could have got the play wrong|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is two suits of the same colour, i assume|pg||
nt|athene: not sure why EW are treating this club as a strong club, though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hand seems ok for light opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: so 1@c is not strong & the alert is just that @c could be short|pg||
nt|muppe: 3@s now?|pg||
nt|psyck: good choice|pg||
nt|doks: 1NT=relay|pg||
nt|athene: east knows his side has a good fit in a major|pg||
nt|athene: double 1@S is probably more common than pass, with that north hand, these days|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp since you are not terribly keen to overcall 2H|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: people like to get in there; having only two cards in an unbid minor is not sufficient deterrent|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3N has chances here i suppose|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, we are used to seeing an average of a lil above 4 nowadays, 2 is certainly before my time though :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Strong @c & stronger @d|pg||
nt|doks: 1@S here not forsing, 16-19|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psyck: weak pass & weaker @h|pg||
nt|doks: they treated 1@C like Polish club and play same defence|pg||
nt|athene: north won't have any temptation to sac in 5@C, with his only big card a defensive trick over west's side suit|pg||
nt|athene: and a balanced hand as well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: NS lead third best so i suppose the @H3 could be from @H9432|pg||
nt|athene: if he had decided 1nt was more descriptive than a negative double |pg||
nt|athene: so south might put the ace on nothing|pg||
nt|doks: but only 2 points weaker|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north takes a very cautious view|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: ok 3@h, splinter|pg||
nt|doks: N have 19 pointss and partner bid @H :) hard to stay low|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: last makeable contract|pg||
nt|doks: splinter bid|pg||
mb|2N|nt|daman: good auction|pg||
nt|doks: no interest from W|pg||
nt|athene: declarer may lead a diamond to the queen and so make only ten tricks here|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: strange pass by N 1st time|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h has its chances|pg||
nt|psyck: normally, when opps bid two suits, you bid the suit where you have stopper|pg||
nt|athene: he does have a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|athene: needless to say 2nt should not be natural there :)|pg||
nt|athene: how much longer can NS waltz neatly around their 9-card heart fit?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ritong: they certainly play big @c, but that does not justifi a pass imho|pg||
nt|psyck: reverse way around here|pg||
nt|tomi2: he had no space to bid their other suit|pg||
nt|psyck: oh, my mistake|pg||
nt|doks: there are more than 40 combined points in this deck|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 49,75:)|pg||
nt|doks: 2@Dx indeed create 6IMPs to Sweeden|pg||
nt|doks: good stop in right contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now N facing a passed hand undercooks with 1N....opening light is the way to go:)|pg||
nt|athene: even facing a passed partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, too much shape & possibilities|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not difficult to build a hand which produces slam , even under strong 1@c opening, so there are thousands which produce game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this lead is stranger than the pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: IMHBAICO, 2N should be natural in as many auctions as possible. a very unpopular view these days|pg||
nt|athene: south thinks 2nt is minors, and i don't blame him|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ryskiel_: then we don t teach players what is best in boards:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gmarco24: either needs 2 @h ruffs in hand or 2 @d ruffs in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: 2@H can be played as "i have one stopper, do you have the other"?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes it was unfortunate, maybe 4@s could make there but 4@h was normal spot to be in|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmmm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the case for opening 1H is waxing by exponential orders of magnitude|pg||
nt|athene: a thing of beauty is a joy forever|pg||
pc|s9|nt|santyclz: I guess that answers the question about when n is going to be @hs in response to a @s t/o x.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|muppe: but 4@h doesnt|pg||
nt|bobholl: already thinking about continuation i guess but @H looks obvious|pg||
nt|tomi2: here, and in most deals partner can see fron his holding what stoper partner has|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 3@h is only 1 down, how many down would be 3@d? I opted 2 down|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: one area of bidding theory where i am sure there is room for investigation is in defence to various nebulous, not necessarily strong, 1@C openers|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 2N was for takeout then it shows 2 places to play, so if N takes 3C to 3D, he must have hearts. of course even then, NS wont be in game. open the damn thing and be done with it|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that after 3@D, south knows his partner must have hearts, as 2nt shows two places to play|pg||
nt|athene: this may be true on planet earth|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: is there any way you can go down in 4@H? not sure it's possible to play those hearts for two losers, is it?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i wonder if two down was possible, if south finessed against dummy at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence led trumps|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: lack of entries, but W endplayed anyway|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: that @H may be costly :)|pg||
nt|psyck: lucky escape|pg||
nt|athene: you simply can't "treat them as natural" i don't think|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|psyck: after 3@hx, one would have expected @h lead|pg||
nt|psyck: 6 an interesting card to lead from K62|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could be polish style|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe they play some kind of coded leads|pg||
nt|ritong: 2/4, for instance|pg||
nt|psyck: oh, ok|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: leaving declarer with losing clubs|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, it's imps, it doesn't matter much|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ryskiel_: he should draw 2x @h before @d switch|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: end of the road|pg||
nt|bobholl: no more tricks ew :(|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that one i want pre-alerted, otherwise declarer will read it wrong|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gmarco24: people always set up hand rather than dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i bet in the bermuda bowl coming up we will see people playing various new schemes|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|psyck: after pd's @cQ dropped on A, never expected S to continue @c instead of switching to @h|pg||

nt|psyck: a pass missing|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D would show spades so he has to bid 2@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|muppe: Slam time for EW|pg||
nt|bobholl: and they didn't do anything abnormal so may be duplicated|pg||
mb|3S|nt|doks: now partner can rise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS will get too high|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bobholl: you'd like to pass now as E but may be it is forcing|pg||
nt|gmarco24: agressive 2@c|pg||
nt|athene: well, once again NS have ten facing fourteen|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: de donder has a good hand|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so redouble isn't hearts, just a good hand|pg||
nt|athene: i know the netherlands team had some weird method called "bolo" (?) for use over short clubs|pg||
nt|athene: which involved all sorts of peculiar multi-meaning overcalls|pg||
nt|athene: it probably wasn't very good but it was entertaining, because no-one had a clue what would be bid or what the final contract would be|pg||
nt|doks: and also CRASH for strong club etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: maybe not THAT good:)|pg||
nt|athene: i think wikner should bid 2@C there actually|pg||
nt|athene: with that shape|pg||
nt|doks: 3@S is on, 3@D-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: after his partner doubles clubs for takeout|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psyck: a loser in each suit, unfortunate|pg||
nt|athene: he knows opps have a big club fit and his side must have a fit somewhere|pg||
nt|athene: oh, except it's ten facing 12, sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not keen on the double at IMPs, red and facing a passed hand, with almost nine losers|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: but hey, this game try style has merits|pg||
nt|doks: S passes with 12 points after partner open at 1st level|pg||
pc|d4|nt|muppe: aggressive overcall that 1@s was|pg||
nt|muppe: not everyone's choice|pg||
nt|psyck: showed 13 cards at this vul i presume|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck: trumps now & a loser in each suit|pg||
pc|sT|nt|muppe: yeah against passed partner non vul against vul you can do anything you like i guess|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: people often get too scared after a redouble|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: poor declarer can't get to dummy to get his rightful pitch on the fourth heart|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doubleton in their suit containing a n honor that might help m ake a surprise defensive trick there, and most of your HCP compressed into a claustrophobic tripleton|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could have left the spades frozen and ducked some trumps and clubs|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|athene: and they bid less than they would otherwise, giving the redoubling side a lot more room|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: yes, had chances with a little different lay of cards|pg||
nt|athene: these amorphous redoubles only showing strength can get into a lot of trouble if opps bid a bit more vigorously|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm well this was all a bit weird|pg||
nt|doks: so the opening bid can be very weak|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|gmarco24: no fast entry in dummy, K@c only way|pg||
nt|athene: neither north nor south thought it was worth while showing any clubs|pg||
nt|athene: maybe get away with two down then|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: oh sorry yes he can|pg||
nt|athene: they are 3-3!|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobholl: i would lead @D now but that's not best for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: he can count his partner for at least 2 points but which ?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Hey, at least he bid @hs...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|doks: all small swings go to Sweeden but set is realy tough|pg||

nt|doks: again big @S fit on EW, so familiar|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever raises them, no-one ever leads them|pg||
nt|doks: so potential 2-3 IMP pick-up for Latvia|pg||
nt|athene: one day the club suit will go on strike and we will all wake up to find decks of cards only have 39 cards in them|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was worried that would allow declarer to run a lot of diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: west can double 1@C - 1@H and get his side into it; not sure how high the spades vs hearts battle will go this time|pg||
mb|1C!|an|2+|mb|p|mb|1D!|an|!h|nt|gmarco24: muideberg convention, showing 5@h and 4+ or 5+ minors|pg||

mb|d!|an|!d|nt|daman: such an easy endplay    his hand counted out|pg||
nt|tomi2: the misclaim and the 4@H down turned the lead|pg||
nt|psyck: bigger @c fit for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm ok|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: i would want to show a takeout double of hearts with west, rather than a diamond suit|pg||
nt|athene: nice to get spades into the action when opps have hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: all 4 Aces missing|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he will do that now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one way to do that is to bid them|pg||
nt|athene: bidding suits is considered a bit plebian these days|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why not 1S over 1D? you arent going to outbid them with Ds anyway, and you probably dont want a D lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|ryskiel_: on @D quess|pg||
nt|doks: @S pre by both E and W can make live harder|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S alerted with the explanation "should be drury"?|pg||
nt|athene: looks very strong for a simple overcall|pg||
nt|athene: a simple raise sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|daman: and he already had 9 tricks in|pg||
nt|psyck: I would just rebid 2@s instead of x|pg||
nt|psyck: oh, will do well to get to 6, 13 in mentioned was just o/t's :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 4333 and soft cards, but still|pg||
nt|doks: this is coffee board|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: no super acceptance for EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this sequence i play as slam try|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C two-way checkback i imagine; forces 2@D either to play there or to make an invitational bid|pg||
nt|psyck: that lead should save time|pg||
nt|othered1: Some play this sequence as a mild slam try and use a 4-level transfer for hands just wanting to punt 4!F|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H, reather|pg||
nt|athene: you IMPLY suits by cue-bidding, doubling for takeout, or perhaps passing but looking eager|pg||
nt|psyck: have to play @c soon if they get to 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: responder can't gamble to try for minor fit, since opener can be with 4@d|pg||
nt|athene: here he just wants to play in 2@D|pg||
nt|psyck: Haxan 2@c?|pg||
nt|doks: 3rd @D goes on @SA|pg||
nt|Vugraph815: 3@C 5-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe, but 1S is the IMP-ly bid|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psyck: maybe not 4 level transfers for EW either|pg||
nt|athene: it would be IMPudent as well, with only four|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|psyck: I'm told it was Haxan, a Scandinavian form of Gazzilli|pg||
nt|doks: in classic Gazilly S hand is direct 3@C bid|pg||
nt|Vugraph815: yes 2@C strong or nat, 2@D FG if p is strong, 3@C strong with 5-5|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: its not problem of @D discards but take 13 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: declarer should manage to hold his losers to @CK, @DAQ, @HAK|pg||
nt|athene: he can't, surely, be considering running this?|pg||
nt|athene: does he think that the lead of the lowest outstanding spot card guarantees the queen?|pg||
nt|athene: a pitch on the spades would not help him that much anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so it's just risking a lot without any great upside|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: guess S felt he was not strong enough to make a try on 4@c|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: which west is too weak for, hence either 3@S splinter rebid or Texas transfer directly|pg||
nt|doks: so something went wrong, open room even with @S action slam was bid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|muppe: i think X is good with that bad @s suit|pg||
nt|muppe: but i dont mind 2@s|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: @c would actually have been best possible lead double dummy, 3rd & 4th round of @c's would force dec to guess the @dQ location to make & would likely get it wrong|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: easier when opps preempt :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|psyck: nice to generate 4 trump tricks with that holding for defense|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: best way to play this hand is to ask opps who has the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: best defence is for west to say "me!" :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ryskiel_: what a dissapoint end of action...we talk of grand slam...though this time seem we are right|pg||
pc|c9|nt|psyck: well, since nether 2@d nor 4@h got E excited with 17 count & great trumps, clearly they do not play the standard way|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT was not a poor contract|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|athene: :(|pg||
nt|athene: restricted choice applied on the hearts|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: east could have won the ace or king first time from @HAKx|pg||
nt|psyck: here S already showed strength & shape, so i suppose felt was not good enough to do more opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|psyck: running out of boards for Pharma to catch up|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|sT|nt|psyck: other room it was easier as opps showed @s, which made S's hand a looot better|pg||

nt|Vugraph815: I think they play 1M-2M as 8-11, but not sure|pg||
nt|athene: once north has the short diamonds the crossruff is certain to pass off smoothly|pg||
mb|1H|nt|doks: 24 points for EW here, but what contract to play?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|psyck: duplication in rounded suits leads to a likely 4@s-1|pg||

nt|athene: yes, that is quite common|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: hi, dont know how long i will be coherent|pg||
nt|athene: but it's less common by a passed hand|pg||
nt|doks: last board without comparisons, 31 and 32 allready played in open|pg||
mb|p!|nt|gmarco24: hi Martin|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D looks sort of right with that hand, minimum or no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree totally|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|psyck: a limit raise|pg||
nt|athene: i guess pass is alertable because it just denies three spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: oh|pg||
nt|psyck: wow, nice :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|daman: I wonder what the rebid was going to be had North passed|pg||
nt|muppe: good question|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d presumably, throwing up an option too|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 3@d -3NT - end|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C rebid would be artificial i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 17 balanced is 1@c so it looks as if your 14-16 nt was correct.|pg||
nt|psyck: not an easy game to reach, this may close the gap a bit|pg||
nt|doks: open room simply bid 3NT|pg||
nt|doks: 2@S =@S and 4+@C and minimum|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|doks: they play sort of Gazzilly|pg||
nt|athene: so a 2@C rebid probably would be either 6+ spades or a strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: this is the strongest bid west can make, apart from a cuebid|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not the killing lead...|pg||
nt|doks: yep|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you open that E hand it is because you have a 2 suiter. so why not show it when u can do so cheaply?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west is wishing now he had bid 3@S over 2@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|muppe: and maybe north should have passed,what do you think?|pg||
nt|psyck: Other table E opened on deal 26 & that was enough for W to blast to slam|pg||
nt|doks: 3@H probably Hx in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: and maybe its reasonable to convert 3@C|pg||
nt|doks: second A underlead in 30 boards, maybe its modern here?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess once you know partner has 0-2 spades your hand gets a lot worse|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: has chances without @c lead|pg||
nt|gmarco24: this should be expensive|pg||
nt|psyck: lost 2 @h tricks, but was likely making anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: that lead does not hurt :)|pg||
nt|doks: same outcome, may influence @D lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: so, he should start with a reopening double, i think|pg||
nt|psyck: N does have a defensive balanced hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psyck: I'm not sure I'd start with 3@c in the 1st place|pg||
nt|daman: I would pass    I have D   esp AJ10x behind the obvious @H hand|pg||
nt|gmarco24: looks like -3 or -4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: 5@H is not my choice with east swiss cheese|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|psyck: maybe it is some kind of Good-Bad seq for them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west has a tough hand, the actual auction seems reasonable to me if 4@D not forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: well 3@c is a bit scary, but perhaps hiding @c AJxxxx when opps are susceptible to preempt is even more scary|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS have 4C on 3rd round ruffing guess|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might get a loser away on hearts if the defence go for the trump promo|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|psyck: a morton for situation|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: but he still can't handle all his clubs|pg||
nt|athene: @HA works now because if declarer pitches a diamond north can take the @DA out fast|pg||
nt|athene: sorry if declarer ruffs north can overruff and take the @DA out|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer pitches south just plays the @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: but south might try the @HQ first going for trump promo and keeping a heart control|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: meanwhile declarer found the enplay in 3N other room last deal to make 3N|pg||
nt|doks: 11 tricks is too much, but contract isafe now as @H behave well|pg||

nt|tomi2: nice result for EW here in the OR|pg||
nt|psyck: not your typical everyday hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: ok, we'll let our imagination to decide what happened|pg||
nt|doks: now @H or @S game on EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: let s see how conraets reacts here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 4 sounds right|pg||
nt|gmarco24: for NS?  :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S??|pg||
nt|tomi2: Graversen bid this very well imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: 1NT= minors or majors|pg||
nt|athene: he was playing south for all the spades?|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  a snoreful 4H here|pg||
nt|athene: but if so, the diamond is never standing up, surely|pg||
mb|1C!|an|17+|nt|psyck: a close finish with 5 comparisions to go|pg||
nt|doks: in open room S compete over 3@H and going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ah, his pard did not open  pity|pg||
nt|muppe: Last two boards coming|pg||
nt|athene: south might venture 2nt at different vulnerabilities|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-7|mb|p|nt|doks: now kind of 6+-4 described|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: that look as sea battle between German battleship and English cruisers in 2nd world war:)|pg||
nt|doks: I will told it to W later :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Janis can explain something of this bidding?|pg||
nt|doks: 2@S is pass/correct bid, so now what is 4@H?|pg||
mb|1H!|an|20+|nt|ryskiel_: 1NT - kind of Dynamic NT?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess north doubled 1@H intending to correct clubs to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: EW playing canape overcalls?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: i was interested in seeing what would happen after 1@d 1@s|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H is 20+ i imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: 1NT= minors or majors|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tx|pg||
nt|doks: kind of defence against Polish club or like|pg||
nt|santyclz: Also he cashed a @s and n followed so there were only 2 out.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: if he passed, though, south could double after 1@H 2@H|pg||
nt|doks: here even 4@S reached, dont think it will be a success|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: normall bidding until 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: north isn't going to duck a club lead towards dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently inevitable to get to this spot|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S looks a bit enthusiastic|pg||
nt|doks: no need for singleton lead with such good trumps|pg||
nt|psyck: that's putting it mildly|pg||
nt|athene: in the good old days, this jump raise showed a real hand|pg||
nt|athene: basically saying "unless you have nothing, you can bid game, and it will make"|pg||
nt|doks: on a good day|pg||
nt|athene: but there seems to be a trend to make it on weaker and weaker hands |pg||
nt|athene: maybe because people have more artificial rebids to show "real" strong raises|pg||
nt|doks: and hope for really perfect day and some side help|pg||
nt|athene: so 1@D 1@S 2@S says "i have a weak notrump" and you never have anything more|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psyck: maybe 3@s Henri?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Most effective lead, and could lead to a 4 or five imp pickup for Rubin|pg||
nt|henryb:  wh just took the lead with a 6 imp gain on 28|pg||
nt|athene: see, west cunningly didn't respond 2@H, and now east has hogged it :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: mm|pg||
nt|athene: he can see one off in his own hand, he won't get cute looking for two off|pg||
nt|psyck: Pharma found the @c lead i mentioned in the 4@h deal :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: dec even had the pleasure of discarding two winning K's in the last two tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: we could well see swings for Pharma last to deals to even it up :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N also making of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: other table, the previous deal was played by W, so 11 tricks could not be prevented, this table had a chance - with @c lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: they played 4 rounds of @c, & with 5 carded @c with W, likely to guess @dQ wrong|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: what's better, 4@H or 3NT? 3nt only down when south leads @DKJxxx or something |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|psyck: good he did not lead @c of course, we got to see good dec play|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|doks: 4@S have to be played carefully|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Polish Club is only military weapon produced in Poland|pg||
nt|doks: @S3-2 with K onside and @D 3-2 and You are home|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H looks worse to me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H is never down off top, and there are some squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N has the club length, you may havce a popup squeeze to drop dubleton queen of spades|pg||
nt|athene: hmm, well i bet 3nt makes more often|pg||
nt|athene: of course 3nt is a lot better played by east|pg||
nt|athene: since then you are not losing to @DAKJxx |pg||
nt|athene: although with a suit that good we assume south would have waded in over 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: may get a spade lead against 4H when S has Qxxx  and AJxxx of diamonds for example|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as a practical matter (as opposed to double dummy), the prospects for thge two contracts may be very close|pg||

pc|hA|nt|psyck: Final segment in about ½ hour from now, thanks all|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|ryskiel_: carefull playing give another small imps for Sweden|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|psyck: dec got the ending right though in the 4@h|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|doks: so they play very similar defence, like LAMBDA as it known in Poland|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: sure, with @s & @d 32 it's decent, but bidding it is yucky|pg||
nt|athene: not much point arguing since human intuition is really bad at this sort of thing|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: machine intuition better?:)|pg||
nt|athene: just run a simulation is the answer|pg||
nt|athene: and find out the answer :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: two 3-2 breaks and a finesse isn't so great|pg||
mc|11|nt|daman: nicely played|pg||

nt|gmarco24: or 1D overcalls|pg||
nt|psyck: Pharma will not gain on deal 30 either, so last deal now & time to congratulate Bubba|pg||
nt|athene: it's not quite as bad as 68% x 68% x 50% because if one suit breaks evenly, that makes it a bit more likely that others will|pg||
nt|athene: but it's still not very good|pg||
nt|Vugraph815: last hand of the set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: simulation cant decisively account for opening lead possibilities on many hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraph815: back again at 16:00|pg||
nt|psyck: it is not 50% either, much better for only 1 @s loser|pg||
nt|athene: no, but i would trust double dummy results over 1000 hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: so last board of this exciting set. Big thanks my colleagues commentors and Roland to invite me participate in this event|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|psyck: a pass missing|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think the vaguaries of the lead and misdefence vs misplay are going to favour one contract that much over the other|pg||
nt|athene: if anything i think they would favour 3nt since 3nt makes more on misdefences than 4major|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: now double will get NS into diamonds|pg||
nt|doks: so last board of this set. Big thanks all colleagues commentors for excellent company, all kibs and Roland for inviting me comment this event|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Final set of the semifanals in about 1 hour.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: this is wrong|pg||
nt|daman: undo somewhere unless there was a psyche|pg||
nt|Vugraph815: This is the last board of the session, there's still one more to go before the winners are ready for tomorrow's semi finals|pg||
nt|psyck: if E choses to raise, it will work here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H will get them into 2@S, and a club lead will be costly|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well this looks like the last hand of the session|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they play about twice as fast as in the spingold|pg||
nt|muppe: Last board and a good slam|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: time flies when you are having fun:-)|pg||
nt|Vugraph815: Sorry|pg||
nt|psyck: it was probably close to a 40% game|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Next set in about 1 hour from now|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: last deal, thanks all|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: np, you did a fine job Ida|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer can win the queen, ruff a heart, ruff a club, and ruff another heart - west can overruff but declarer should get two more trumps |pg||
nt|athene: same lead as the other room|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will be doing quite well to get away with one down here|pg||
nt|athene: there are various alternatives|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite a view to bid and rebid with the e hand...|pg||
nt|athene: interesting neither west opens this one|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|doks: no swing on a last board for sure, maybe IMP|pg||
nt|athene: looks like an opening bid to me|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: just under 1 and 1/4 hours for 16 boards, compared to 2 to 2 1/2 for spingold|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure what is so exciting for a moysian with east' hand|pg||
nt|athene: double of the 1@H bid would have made life a little scarier for NS in 3nt|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Vugraph815: This is the last hand of the match|pg||
nt|Vugraph815: Thanks all for watching, we'll be back after a lunch break with new matches!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Shut the opponents out nicely.|pg||
nt|doks: last board is plus for Sweeden, so will be very close result in 1st set|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: i guess declarer has no choice other than to finesse the spade|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: usually, this choice is made with strong trumps in the four cards hand|pg||
nt|psyck: this table is superfast, half a dozen deals ahead of the other room|pg||
nt|doks: but still 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: thanks all|pg||
nt|muppe: Thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: he might lead a diamond immediately|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: that may be statiustically true, but it sort of depends what the cards are on a given hand. that statistic still contains many hands where 4M makes on the misdefense and 3N doesnt, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if the hand in questio n is one of those then the generalized statistic over 1000 hands simply isnt applicable|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: ok, i assume he took @HAK and ruffed a heart?|pg||
nt|psyck: Next set in about 1.5 hours|pg||
nt|athene: definitely playing strong club i would open it 2@C every time|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|psyck: Next set half an hour after this, thanks all.|pg||
nt|doks: open room clear overbiding by Latvian NS pair save the day for SWE|pg||
nt|athene: knocking out the @DA would be ok if hearts were 4-4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|psyck: yes, you need to be able to ruff with the small trumps & had good enough one to draw trumps in the 4 card trump hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
