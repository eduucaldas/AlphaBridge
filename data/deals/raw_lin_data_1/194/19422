nt|ahollan1: 6-9 = micro,  10-12 = mini,  12-14 = weak,  15-17 = strong,  14-16 =   good question |pg||
nt|3for3: east considering black suit shift|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he is playing with the spade two|pg||

nt|bigtrain: meckwell|pg||

pc|h9|nt|thorvald: Playing Lebensohl i would only bid 3@h on the west hand|pg||
nt|barnets: after opening bid hough by south|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But when North shows up with @CK it is so much easier|pg||
nt|barnets: in open South opened 1N|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|barnets: but e/w still got to 4@H|pg||

nt|Walddk2: OK, so much for that|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|thorvald: With AKJxx, QX, ??, JTxx wouldnt he open 1@s anyway ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same ciontract in the closed room|pg||
nt|barnets: Nunes did switch at trick 2 to a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Nunes did shift to a club at trick 2, queen, king, ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room Nunes opened a 12-14 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So unless he upgraded he has both red queens|pg||
nt|barnets: the fact south did not fnd the club switch perhaps makes the hand more difficult to read|pg||
nt|barnets: as the position of th @CK is unknown|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, he only needs to get one suit right now|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's possible he thinks S has the @C K and N has both red queens.  it's possible to go down if he thinks that|pg||
nt|barnets: a spec suggests leading the @CQ now|pg||
nt|barnets: from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With the singleton ace in dummy? :)|pg||
nt|barnets: to find out about the K|pg||
nt|warrens:  except East is dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: the club Q is in declarer's hand though|pg||

nt|Walddk2: There is a chance he will|pg||
nt|thorvald: he is locked at table now a will make it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: a 1 board match!!!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|phil:  I suppose its worth the outage for the other tables!|pg||
nt|3for3: but unlike other sports...the players dont know the score|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-17|pg||
nt|poohbear: keep in mind the result you see here is NOT official . We will only have official results once the players compare|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kareno: Not the first in history :) |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: indeed, and we were one IMP off in the last set|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @D and a major|pg||
nt|gambit: start the doubling now|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|gambit: what a bid! |pg||
nt|andyv:  a hand that neither side really wants to win the contract|pg||
nt|kareno: Live by the sword, die by the sword.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  this may be a big ouch|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: this will be death by 1,000 cuts|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bigtrain: X is likely neg|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: ouch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Misunderstood as negative double?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Incredible to last deal!|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond lead for sure.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: most play X there as negative of natural suits|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: really amazing |pg||
nt|andyv:  even though rho is know to have one of those suits?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: still not sure what Rodwell's major is|pg||
nt|3for3: any chance smirnov can escape for -1 to tie ?|pg||
nt|gambit: doesn't look like a neg double to me...|pg||
nt|kareno: It is a negative double.  But curious because major is unknown at the time of the double.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|gambit: I know, but ............|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|3for3: europeans are less worried about shape, more about points with their doubles...|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told it is.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not to me either....looked more like do something intelligent pd double|pg||
nt|kareno: :)  I play it penalty cooperative.|pg||
nt|gambit: to answer the question  - no chance for down 1, Rodwell pulls a rabbit out of his hat |pg||
nt|kareno: Their nt is what?  14-16?|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, the trick will be for W to make this or hold it to down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-17|pg||
pc|h2|nt|3for3: i dont see much chance either.  and the defense has a good idea what is going on |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Meck:  "you rate to be 5-3-3-2?"   Smirnov nods yes|pg||
nt|3for3: this will take a while|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: Meckwell are just very hard to play against.  Very active and sometimes opponents are afraid they are being stolen blind when they are not :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: this set was more about constructive bidding than stealing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  still, in this set, the aggressiveness of EW which stood them well so far, was ultimately their downfall|pg||
nt|gambit: If opps intervene with such trash, maybe neg doubles should be scrapped at the 2 level.....there is leb and it seems an opportunity lost to punish such indiscretions |pg||
nt|kareno: I like double somewhat penalty oriented at the two-level.  I may be quite alone but my results have been good.|pg||
nt|othered1: Mine, too, with the same approach|pg||
nt|kareno: Can't answer you all, sorry, specs.|pg||
nt|andyv:  you have to congratulate the Nickell team for always providing drama in these events|pg||
nt|kareno: Mind games here.|pg||
nt|gambit: how is he supposed to find 8 tricks? MI|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: and almost always coming out on top|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, fine :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  how can he find 7?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  who leads small from AQJ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: if you "know" there are 5 spades on your left, you might|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: might|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rodwell published his book too soon     so many hands from this week that could have been used|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gambit: next volume, I sure he has enough for another|pg||
nt|gambit: This being one|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: 2 or 3 weeks ago  was release of Rodwell book on Play|pg||
nt|gambit: The Roswell Files, so incredible, it can only be a government conspiracy |pg||
nt|3for3: he signed copies of the book here in toronto.|pg||
nt|kareno: There are always great hands from this pair.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with his name?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  LOL|pg||
nt|gambit: This is like SAW 1, the pain of watching someone gettng tortured|pg||
nt|3for3: at least there will be no sequel here|pg||
nt|tarekr:  I agree! I am sure he senses doom!|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|andyv:  the K?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  no!|pg||
nt|andyv:  Joe, you sure?|pg||
nt|gambit: misclick and will not accept undo|pg||
nt|kareno: Not possible ... Operator???|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he must have played the ten earlier.  I didn't see it; only say MEck was on lead.  Sorry|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
