nt|peachy: For those interested, history of this event http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagar_Women%27s_Knockout_Teams|pg||
nt|puncher99: 9th trick is going to be hard to get here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it will fall from the sky in diamonds|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: a few imps to make up for Hampton but no panic|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzfe: Hi Shirley.|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|gambit: Welcome all to the quarter-final of the Spingold, nail-biting final session |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welland is deep into the tank.  He is a 'fast' player, so him taking this time is not|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: usual.|pg||
nt|gambit: 6@D is a good spot, and with KD onside, a great one |pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: actually 10 tricks on layout should be par|pg||

nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|kareno: Good day from Las Vegas :)|pg||
nt|chick: Welcome everyone :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello from Italy :)|pg||
nt|psyck: "Sementa"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Yes, the name is Antonio Sementa|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W play a system very similar at Lauria-Versace|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello all|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Your commentators are Warren and CK|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks like a pretty straightforward 4@S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: thanks Joe, we will remember that and 1 IMP could make a difference|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|psyck: The strong @c system may not work too well here allowing opps to possibly find a @d sacrifice|pg||
nt|kareno: I had the pleasure of losing to Versace and Lauria in a KO match earlier this week :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all   and welcome back to Toronto |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|psyck: N will be happy to hear 2@s by S|pg||
nt|kareno: The next KO fortunately we won so I can still show my face around here.  It was this exact team that defeated us.|pg||
nt|kareno: Did I say hello from Vegas?  I'm still in Toronto watching baseball games :)|pg||
nt|psyck: South has maximum for the earlier pass, no wastage in opps suit, & shape|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i hate the first pass... clearly worth a double|pg||
nt|bigtrain: now impossible to catch up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, assuming double was 5-7, it was certainly possible on 2@d|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree - now she hasn't got a good bid but 2@s will do.|pg||
nt|psyck: double or 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: depending on agreement|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|duschek: Hellp|pg||
pc|s7|nt|duschek: Hello :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Quinn:  you better play the spots off of this one|pg||
nt|rv: technically West invites and East accepts with max|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bridge_one: giving a medium hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: staggering their way to the right place|pg||
nt|xenya: double possible as S's hand is limited by his 1st bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Askgaard - Bjarnarson East-West against  Fantoni-Nunes|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome |pg||
nt|sybarra: what a table!! |pg||
nt|duschek: A bit of explanation needed. West's 2@D showed 5+@H and less than game-forcing strength - EW open almost all hands containing 10+ HCP and a 5cM|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kareno: West never showed his diamond fit - |pg||
nt|ady: 1 imp to Cayne|pg||
nt|psyck: I guess W felt he had too much in def to bid more|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: Ho Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Giorgio :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: this could make if declarer takes a @h hook, plays for @hs 3-3 and @CA rite|pg||
nt|xenya: NS play Polish Club|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D is safe contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tarekr:  Exactly but Shawn is not taking any chances to miss game even though it is a non-vul one|pg||
nt|ady: meantime 5@D  only down 1|pg||
nt|xenya: where all strong hands are opened 1@C|pg||
nt|duschek: The rest was natural - Askgaard accepted the invitation, having promised 10-15 HCP initially|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|duschek: Those heart intermediates in dummy are quite handy for East|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psyck: the 2@d could be a wide ranging hand too i guess|pg||
nt|kareno: I would hope south would take the push to 5@s.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|duschek: Sorry, with East being Bjarnarson, he was obviously the one accepting the invitation to game|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: yes, @d more comfortable to play than @s's here I guess|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|rv: Mildred is well on way to 9 tricks here if she plays a @c to K|pg||
nt|xenya: also many weak ones|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|duschek: (and after a bit of warming up I will also be able to tell who is declarer...)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not quite the way i envisioned it|pg||
nt|peachy: just 1 IMP in, could have been a game swing|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|peachy: or out, depends on one's view :)|pg||
nt|puncher99: friendly lie of cards for NS if they can  get to the heart suit|pg||
nt|peachy: EW play strong club and weak NT |pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome back to this Quarterfinal match from Spingold|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: 10-13 nt nv|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wiill north/south get ito the action?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: French law used to forbid sans a tout weak|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|bal 12-14|nt|santyclz: Nice @s "low".|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble is supposed to show a five card minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here it may help NS find hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Extended notes between South and West....|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Greetings to all.|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w miss a game but you can see why on the hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H + @C/@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: will north regret that bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H -hearts and minor is the toy of this decade|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: we may play it here|pg||
nt|gambit: still make 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's been around since 1980s   an entire millenium ago|pg||
nt|roswolf: sizeable gain for team USA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cards friendly for 2 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: its popularity is more recent-|pg||
nt|odysseus69: best lead|pg||
mb|3C|nt|puncher99: tough to find hearts now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was it really west who bid 2@H??|pg||
nt|gambit: 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Is this real|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yes it was.|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you operator/Ross|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chick: NS have more points than EW, about time they stuck their nose in|pg||
nt|ybob: 2down in 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh maybe for rest-of-world   in USA  it was a battle of who got the credit  Cappelletti or Hamilton|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Brave balance on that suit.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gambit: nice Q@D and 1/2 a club stopper that just truned into a full one|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: there will be a director at this table soon|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr for interrupting once. Sport by high level.|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|santyclz: 3@c?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: That's the bid.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfe: I don't know what the 2@h means, but there was a lengthy conversation between|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Westheimer and von Arnim at the time.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: Seems more likely n would bid that...|pg||
nt|chick: a hand to pass out :)|pg||
nt|peachy: West had enough, understandably.  She knows NS on shaky ground, doesnt need much math to figure that|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzfe: This should be a fairly quick table.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: mnight need the spade shift whoon |pg||
nt|gambit: push, next one |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Back down 25. They say we have a hard time finding minor suit slams in America. Obviously not so!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfe: At least, so far it has been.|pg||
nt|peachy: Bramley Welland def is UDCA, o/e first discard only|pg||
nt|ybob: after KQ@S + A@D on N, S has A@C and KQ @H|pg||
nt|ybob: clear to declarer ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia is taking his time on this.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: now spade nine|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not at all obvious of course, but you need a miracle|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|tarekr:  this does not look like fun for EW|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|peachy: now has to avoid 2 club losers|pg||
nt|peachy: doable but does he have info on where ace is?|pg||
nt|ybob: he plays 3 rounds @D and home after N shows only 3@D|pg||
nt|ybob: later ruff @S ruff next @D with 8@C and win|pg||
nt|ybob: because J@C on N|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to John Stewart|pg||
nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
nt|ybob: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi John|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia pulls out  a card then folds his hand.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s7|nt|peachy: Would declarer have stranded spades on purpose if she had two of them?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Perhaps she is depending on Qx of @hs in one hand.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|puncher99: she must b|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well auken played 10 first round, causing the confusion|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s4|pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: do they want the credit ?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Had to double check that trick :)|pg||
nt|stewball: elegant but doomed|pg||
nt|stewball: zia is long on elegance|pg||
nt|ybob: declarer need 3/3 @C so N showed 5@S 2@H what wrong with play QJ@D and another @D ?|pg||
nt|stewball: its not clear what this line catered to ,other than elegance|pg||
pc|d9|nt|peachy: since they missed the heart fit, it really does not matter what happens on this hand|pg||
nt|stewball: well at least theres not as much at stake given the OR result|pg||
nt|stewball: i have a feeling Hamman doesnt think this hand is worth 20 minutes of his life|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s5|nt|odysseus69: flier for e-w in open room|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SJ832HKJ9DK8752C7,S965HA52DQT6CAQ65,SKQ4HQT876D3CJ943,SAT7H43DAJ94CKT82|sv|n|nt|tarekr:  Mildred would have accepted with 14|pg||
nt|rv: if East doesn't open, will you open 1@d or 1n with North hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: the director was here getting the auction from a board in the last set, where there was some sort of appeal in the other room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Sementa and Duboin started to play togheter few years ago, so they at Versace the system|pg||
nt|psyck: dec showed something in minors in the bidding & likely the @hA for the 3N bid, so likely to have nothing much in @s; so @s shift was possible to find maybe|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: there are only few change, depending on style to play, but 88% is equal|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  when I am short oM, i generally will bid a good 4 cd major in 3rd or 4th seat|pg||
nt|duschek: EW play a strong club showing 16+ or possibly 15 balanced. 1NT is 12-14 at all seats and vulnerabilities.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bridge_one: 98%|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@C possible  but likely to play in 3NT|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tarekr:  support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is limited at 9 hcp exclude 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: double?|pg||
nt|xenya: must be a specialised bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by North is aggressive in vuln|pg||
nt|psyck: even playing equal level conversion, it would not occur to me at this vul|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl give @H + a minor|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with sgl @s North think the partner can have @s and points, so he must bid anything|pg||
nt|xenya: if it shows the reds, S is not pleased|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  shows 3 cd support|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psyck: S clearly expected more|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now depending on agreement - i suppose 2Nt was convetional for N/S in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: invite sequence it looks like|pg||
nt|psyck: 3NT will have better chances played by E|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|psyck: no more tricks than the 5@d, & 2 aces in sight|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3N need a present by defence|pg||
nt|xenya: good defence will obviously beat this|pg||
nt|chick: clubs could be set up, but I think defense will get their major suits first|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, should set it 1 or 2 w/o much difficulty i think|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, with 11 decent HCP, Askgaard invites game opposite 12-14. This sequence is a standard Jacoby sequence; I believe that 2@S denied 4-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: some wastage in diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: each bidding their weakness|pg||
nt|kareno: This looks like some sort of relay auction.  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s 2@H 1@C are ON for defence in all case|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but can make more tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Bill Jacobs in Australia|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Bill |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bill plays the same system as Fantunes, so we are well covered now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: anything from 11 to 13 tricks in clubs |pg||
nt|Walddk4: as Jacob knows the Danish system pretty well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, and I might learn something as well|pg||
nt|duschek: Bjarnarson decides on 3NT, based on the bad distribution and slow values|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a coded lead:  normal count from hands that include an honour|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: some might not show supp double with sub-min hand (11 hcp with Mildred)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: same auction in the other room to 3NT on 49, and they made an overtrick|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told 2@h was a gf|pg||
nt|psyck: if dec ducks 2 @h's, def may need to switch to @s|pg||
pc|h7|nt|warrens:  yes, it was played by East at the other table, so the defense has a good chance here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kareno: Club slam requires picking up the suit.  Stiff king in either hand twice as likely as stiff jack in north.|pg||
nt|duschek: I have learnt a bit too much from Askgaard and Bjarnarson this year, losing 4-25 to them in the round-robin of this year's Danish championship, then by 80 imps in the semifinal|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bunch as we say |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The Norwegians were a little conservative in the closewd room and it is going to hurt them|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe I'm not meant to call them Norwegians ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Declarer has thumbed @H3 several times|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is assuming "we" make it here|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|tarekr:  I bet it is not going to be the same auction in other room on this hand|pg||
nt|rv: @s back could be best here|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|duschek: Communications are not very good, but the cards are friendly towards declarer this time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: speaking of communications, connection here has been unreliable. |pg||
pc|h6|nt|chick: a stiff king in either hand doesn't guarantee picking up the suit|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bjacobs: Fulvio will be going through all the permutations and combinations, trying to visualize a layout where he can beat this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: pull up a chair, get a drink. This is going to be a long set.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: so still same odds overall|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may see low @S  off dummy now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: we will, surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think declarer is wondering whether he should play @SA first|pg||
nt|bjacobs: in case South has @SK singleton|pg||
nt|bebechira: we have to congratulate Bill for the wonderful win yesterday for Victoria in the Australian National Championship :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, well, not exactly the spingold ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: congrats Bill! |pg||
pc|h8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|rv: here both Mildred and Quinn could have shown restraint in second round of bidding, case for both to pass|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kareno: If you can get two round of clubs in safely then spades might break.  I'm not sure how I would play this in six.  |pg||
nt|psyck: picking up @c's is hardly 6%|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kareno: Lauria is a fine declarer... let's watch!  Heart lead best for the defense.|pg||
nt|psyck: a very poor slam, and both Q 1st & A 1st are equal odds|pg||
nt|psyck: it is just a question of J single with N or K single with S..about 6% on a @h lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: you have to add Jxx offside with xxx+ in spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Lauria is declarer.  Lynch on lead.  Without a spade lead it is easier but club suit still an issue.  Then spades a problem.|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, still say calling it 10% doesn't make it sound so good either :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Sorry, without a HEART lead |pg||
nt|bigtrain: so makeable if singleton K in S by picking up trump OR singleton K in N if S has xxx+ in spades|pg||
nt|kareno: No but remember the Italians winning a world championship because Kx of spades was in the pocket.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however this result is the risk to overcall with light hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kareno: Right it was clubs. |pg||
nt|kareno: Okay good lead.|pg||
nt|psyck: now all up to his table feel :)|pg||
nt|psyck: we are lucky to get an exciting start anyway :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: 4@H now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: So now is the time to get really simple, a second club finesse, more spades and hope|pg||
nt|sybarra: how does he get back to hand? |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: my worst bridge nightmare, a two way guess for a slam|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bigtrain: he clearly chose the % line|pg||
nt|chick: I average about 7% getting it right |pg||
nt|ady: 11 imps to Lynch|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, A is better as you mentioned due to additional @s chances|pg||
nt|kareno: This was a total guess except that he knew two cards in south's hand, KQ.  That could have swayed him.|pg||
nt|kareno: King singleton either hand gives him a chance for the hand.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: He doesn't|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: yes, more normal to wait for pd to balance aggresively than entering before opps limit hand, at least at this vul|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4 spades, 3 clubs, a heart and a diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: and doesnt care actually I see |pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: 3 down|pg||
nt|xenya: hardly an achievement by NS, this one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the line played by south is a little strange, because if East hold Q@C then can find one trick - probably better continue  with Q @H for KJ @S in east|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: If the hands are going to be like this it is going to be as looooong evening.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: A bit remarkable in that Hamman never says much at the table.|pg||
nt|ybob: calm 3NT here|pg||
nt|gambit: Tarek, congrats on your second place finish with Zia |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about Monaco -- the 3 pairs have moved from other countries and there is some politics involved|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: What?  Politics in bridge?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sybarra: they tried 4 @S in other room on bd 33 for the save|pg||
nt|roswolf: a natural 2nt missed the @H fit in the other room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Multon certainly conservative there - maybe mini NT|pg||

nt|gambit: sorry|pg||
nt|gambit: spade through |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|peachy: Welland-Branley system nnotes say thi:    We are pretty aggressive and imaginative, so we might show up without the shape or strength that we have promised at any time.      Expect ...|pg||
nt|peachy: excitement during the match, at some point|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|santyclz: Must have been shortness rather than a minimum.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|tarekr:  should easily come to ten tricks.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|gambit: squeezing declarer|pg||
pc|h5|nt|santyclz: Let me take that back, n could easily go opposite a minimum with such good controls out of the suit.|pg||
nt|chick: yes, but still they are probably too high|pg||
nt|rodal f: A lot of cards are placeded now after S bid.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|stewball: would welland open 2@h on KTxxx?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d3|pc|s7|nt|santyclz: It didn't show a "subminimum".|pg||
nt|peachy: First seat favorable, I wouldn't put it past him, don't know though|pg||
nt|peachy: I have seen interesting actions in the past|pg||
nt|stewball: well the K convinced zia that he might apparently|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Didn't notice where Zia won that one.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: When the cards start flying at this table, they do so very fast.|pg||
nt|stewball: he;s likely to lose a couple on this defence|pg||
nt|ybob: declarer can play small, J@S and @S to K if @S are 4/2 play next @H and squeezed N later|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d5|pc|c6|nt|santyclz: I'm told they play Ogust, in which case 3@c was "bad hand" "bad suit", surely an accurate description.|pg||
nt|chick: but she still went on to game?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|peachy: An old CC for Arnim- von Auken says "Canape style with longer minors but neverl onger majors" so Martin got it right|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d7|pc|c2|nt|ybob: same after J@S and K@S |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ybob: :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: wd|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ybob: now with @S 4/2 play  9@H ...|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|santyclz: It's makable double dummy, run the q then ruff a @d.|pg||
nt|stewball: why|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d4|pc|h7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d6|nt|stewball: curious|pg||
nt|ybob: run @H N is squeezed @S and m|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: Ah she has enough entries to ruff the @d later.|pg||
nt|chick: well, guess her play matched her bidding :)|pg||
mc|6|pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SKJ7H42DT2CJ98642,SA83HKQT98DAQCKQ3,SQT654HA3DKJ64CA7,S92HJ765D98753CT5|sv|e|nt|tarekr:  some of the spots are missing:)|pg||
nt|kareno: This IS Carolyn Lynch, isn't it?  Not Peter Lynch?|pg||
nt|kareno: Once the club ace drew the jack, that was the preferred line of play|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@c is limited as !@c is available with stronger hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 3@d requires right @d guess here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C polish, so 10/15 5+ cards in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: One of the key aspects of the Fantunes system is that you have to open 1NT on many many many hands|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: This is one of them ... although he did have a 2@S opening as an option (in third seat)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|duschek: What does 1NT show in their system?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: about 12-14, semi balanced|pg||
nt|sybarra: "any thing"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's opened with all 5332 shapes, and most of the 5422's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 12-14 announced|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now if you believe the rule of 11, you play the 7 here|pg||
nt|duschek: And he needs a lot of overtricks to match the 400 from the open room|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: plenty of wastage in rounded suits for E-W, after South's entry into auction, Quinn should get @ds right|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kareno: South fell in love with her hand.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many write me 2@C 11/14 - OK, but the concept is similar :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and there you are in dummy |pg||
pc|s8|nt|rv: Cronier could have doubled 2@d to show @hs and @c tolerance (snapdragon double) which would have allowed Willard to compete in @hs|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: Yes, he needs 10 overtricks ... too difficult, even for Fantoni|pg||
nt|duschek: Apart from the diamonds, cards are breaking terribly for declarer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The precious @CA is the entry ... can E/W find a way to remove it?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tarekr:  Very good point Venky|pg||
nt|rv: maybe too ambitious opposite a passed partner who bid 2@c at these colors, reasonable auction all around|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|psyck: after 2N, S's hand becomes worse, but some would open 4@s anyway 1st time |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C in napolitan, blueteam, precision and polisch are very similar|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: Nope|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: might be held to 6 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Not a bad 4@s opening bid and here she should gain IMPs.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bigtrain: forced to win 7 as e/w don't have requisite communication to win 3 @C tricks|pg||
nt|ady: if a spade comes now will have to rise with ace and exit with spade|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And  North has his 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rv: I suspect Quinn will get @ds right here, especially after Willard shows @SA as well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tarekr:  A lot of people forget snapdragon at 2 level!|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, then west will be righteously endplayed.|pg||
nt|psyck: Should find it as E may have bid more with more values|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well ... he's isolated from @DA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|warrens:  the 5th spade will be uncomfortable for declarer|pg||
nt|warrens:  but the same thing at both tables|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kareno: Well done by Carolyn Lynch!!|pg||
nt|ady: well done   3 imps to Lynch|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|rv: now 1 down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: now a club trick for NS|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|duschek: There will be an endplay somehow|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Vugraphzfc: diamond Imeant of course|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks like it ... with clubs 6-1, doubt the defence can do anything|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Say North plays a low club here ... E/W can grab their hearts, but then they are stuck, whoever wins the 3rd heart|pg||
nt|duschek: However, if declarer plays the @CA and another club, it will be over|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think he will do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we can see why the other room had trouble with 3 nt |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: Yes, you could certainly post-mortem their auction|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|psyck: hmm|pg||
nt|psyck: vul, should have settled for -2|pg||
