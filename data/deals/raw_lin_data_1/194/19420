nt|henryb:  Another simple game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Should create some swings one would imagine|pg||

nt|henryb:  on which everything behaves nicely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helgemo can invite through 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or force to game with 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or just punt game|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and this was the fourth option|pg||
nt|henryb:  or invite with 2N? which would be my choice|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|Walddk2: 2NT would deny five spades|pg||
nt|chorush: More attractive to invite when you are not playing opposite a precision 19 point opening|pg||
nt|chorush: 10 point opening|pg||
nt|henryb:  with the stiff @hJ, I would not feel I had to show the fifth spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|phil:  playing against relay is brutal on hands like this - I predict West will declare 3N and the defenders willl have little clue what the closed hand has|pg||
nt|phil:  it will start with a spade lead|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|jbgood: a nasty lead |pg||
nt|phil:  been told that West described his hand - so the closed hand is known|pg||
nt|phil:  and that also defeats a lot of the advantage of relays|pg||
nt|phil:  still appears declarer can reach a long club with a slow heart|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|jbgood: but since hearts are nice declarer doesnt need to develop an extra club trick for the nineth|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|c3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5-4, 11 count and two 10's perhaps worth an invite|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: declarer is not happy now. he can't believe spades are 5-1|pg||
nt|phil:  this doesnt seem like the right approach - clubs still might have been 3-3; he was trading 4-2 clubs + a heart guess for 3-3 spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: as i was about to say it, a kib found the solution: "could have made playing on spades if he had cashed QD first -- then could endplay north" - double dummy of course|pg||
nt|jbgood: if he exits with a spade now, N can take 2 but not the 3rd spade before playing a di|pg||
nt|jbgood: jon's only hope now (i thinks) is that N is 5-3-2-3|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: EW esplaining the auction - 2@s might have shown 5 or maybe 6 spades|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|poohbear: To make 4 nt on a @H lead declarer has to cash 2 spades to squeeze south|pg||

nt|henryb:  As I said early, I would have raised to 2N|pg||

nt|chorush: vul it is unquestionable he would have invited IMO|pg||

nt|jbgood: the different NT ranges tend to create lots of swings|pg||
nt|phil:  yes, in many ways too|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|chorush: Whatever 2 spades was it did a number on the Norwegians|pg||
nt|henryb:  So 2@s propelled the Norwegians to a 19 point vul game|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Monegasque Henry?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that they represent Monaco now|pg||
nt|henryb:  wherever the claim to live, those two will always be Norwegian, just as Zia will always be Paki and Pepsi Polish|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jbgood: the preemptive effect of bidding NT first is underrated|pg||
nt|phil:  personally I think a weaker NT randomizes you against the field in pairs, but its great at IMPs |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  A good save in 5@d, or even maybe in 6@d against a @s contract|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chorush: possibly 22 tricks on this hand, 11 for each side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW have a very cheap save here, at virtually any level|pg||
nt|smoller: Will is be 4@S NS or 5@D EW?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 5@S NS|pg||
nt|smoller: If N can show a splint in diamonds, NS may go to 5@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would guess that once Helness did not open it is not that likely that E-W will get in the auction|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: The East hand is an opener for Bjarnarson at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|henryb:  Wow. |pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: I would say 80% of the players left in this event consider Helness' hand an auto opener|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb:  Helgemo is right in there|pg||
nt|jbgood: good raise |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Was 3@S enough?|pg||
nt|chorush: Most play a form of unusual v unusual where Madsen could have shown a limit raise in spades had he chosen to|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would think so. Not enough trumps for 4. not enough hand for anything else|pg||
nt|chorush: His hand is not quite worth it IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: Maybe not, Roland. Could bid with 3 spades only|pg||
pc|s4|nt|phil:  3N looks good with an opener on your right to me|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Schaltz did well to bid 5@H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chorush: Henry, if 3D by Madsen showed limit raise or better in spades would you choose it?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|henryb:  No, as I said, not enough hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dangerous pass by Madsen|pg||
nt|chorush: ok I agree. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It may encourage Schaltz to bid slam|pg||
nt|smoller: Is pass from N forcing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is it for you?|pg||
nt|henryb:  If Helness guesses the @h, he might even make 6@d!|pg||
nt|chorush: I dont think he can handle it all Henry, but that is not a GIB declaration|pg||
nt|henryb:  but maybe not quite enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exciting deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I don't see how he has 12 tricks on a heart lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S are not regular partners. I am not sure they have an agreement regarding forcing pass or not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: they need to draw trumps and can only have 5, 5, and a ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know it would be forcing for Martin in other partnerships|pg||
nt|chorush: If Schaltz had the stiff Ace would his bidding be different?|pg||
nt|henryb:  The question is really on a spade lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  spade ruff, club, now I think they have to play another spade|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He needs a lot for 6@S to make|pg||
nt|chorush: moving the heat 8 to dummy in exchange for the 5 might allow 6 to make|pg||

nt|poohbear: It is very important ( especially over 1m openings ) to define your hand type at a low level|pg||

mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|nt|kit: This is a really greedy double.  Opponents non-vul, and might help them play it|pg||

mb|p|pc|c5|nt|bessi2: agreed.. I don't understand this dbl|pg||
nt|poohbear: well I guess it worked out great for NS . If South tries for slam best he can do is push the board :)|pg||
nt|kit: He may think he is doing worse in the match than he actually is|pg||
nt|kit: And after this board, that may well be true|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure why he should think that.. he has 1 very good result plus some possible gains like on the last board |pg||
nt|poohbear: i cant imagine why. They had an iffy result on the first board but teammates could easily cover it. And the 3NT hand was worth 10 at least|pg||
nt|poohbear: they were only stuck 9 entering this set|pg||
nt|kit: So, how will this play (other than very slowly).  Off the top, 2 clubs and 1 diamond.  Suppose he goes for straight crossruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: Not like Levin togamble|pg||
nt|bessi2: Jorgensen is a great declarer and that dbl will help him make it for sure|pg||
nt|kit: I think he comes to 7 trump tricks, and he might get a spade trick also.|pg||
nt|kit: Granted Levin was a little unlucky finding his partner, who made a vul overcall, with AK of spades which don't take tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: only thing Levin can be dbling on is 5 trumps and perhaps the @d king|pg||

nt|poohbear: 11-13 bal|pg||
nt|kit: if 1@D is always unbalanced, maybe it shows this sort of hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: ns play unbal @d I believe, and then they should be able to raise to 2@s on 3 cards... a system error if not|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: Anyway, they stopped in a reasonable spot|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|kit: far from clear how this hand should be tackled|pg||
nt|poohbear: looks right to try and ruff @cs in dummy then got trumps drawn as quickly as possible. The alternative is to try and draw trumps and set up @ds while there is a @c entry|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kit: This is a tricky hand in 4@H -- short on dummy entries|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Levin's dbl is takeoutish. just shows values to compete to 3 level|pg||
nt|kit: Problem is he needs 3 diamond winners along with his 5 hearts and 2 clubs|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: Double dummy he could probably do it by arranging to take diamond finesse and ruffing club in dummy not touching trumps|pg||
nt|kit: Natural start will be to win king of clubs and lead heart to ace, getting the news.  Can he survive from there?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|nt|poohbear: i think so|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe he can.  Run queen of diamonds, heart to jack, ace of diamonds, club to ace, jack of diamonds king ruff, club.|pg||
nt|bessi2: me 2|pg||
nt|poohbear: @d finesse |pg||
nt|poohbear: or just give up a @c |pg||
nt|kit: Then can ruff fourth club in dummy and take another heart finesse.  It works, and will be what he does.|pg||
nt|warrens:  @H A, @D Q, @D A, @C A, small @H, @C, ruff 4th @C and last @H finesse|pg||
nt|poohbear: take 6 @h tricks 2@c 2@d|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|poohbear: for results after the 3rd qtr http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-8|pg||
nt|kit: He is working it through now.|pg||
nt|poohbear: we have 2 of the 4 matches up here for live results in the 4th . other 2 matches results only after they compare at the end'|pg||
nt|kit: Alternative would be to take heart finesse now and play ace and a diamond, hoping to pitch both clubs on the diamonds.  That needs North to have 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: This is winning line if South has Kxx of diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: So not clear at all|pg||
nt|poohbear: certainly possible for S to have KJ10xxxx Kxx 109x|pg||
nt|kit: exactly -- and with the 9 of clubs missing, he doesn't know whether or not South has led a short suit.|pg||
nt|poohbear: big swing to Fleisher I hear on board 56. Stansby martel making 4@s dbled|pg||
nt|kit: But if he thinks South has 6 spades from only 2@S bid, he will play South for 4 diamonds and get it right.|pg||
nt|poohbear: true|pg||
nt|kit: So it looks like the diamond finesse is the percentage (and successful) line of play.|pg||
nt|poohbear: But there was no raise from North with Hxx of @s|pg||
nt|kit: good point|pg||
nt|poohbear: so he might suspect 7-2|pg||
nt|poohbear: I wonder how much he is factoring in the 4@s bid from board 57|pg||
nt|poohbear: that was vul vul|pg||
nt|kit: So let's suppose South known to have 7 spades.  Then which is percentage play?  It feels like a tossup as I see it.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|kit: he got it right!|pg||

nt|poohbear: still has a guess here|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3-3 @cs or not|pg||
nt|poohbear: if @cs 3-3 needs to play a trump|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: which is why he should have continued diamonds -- then would be no guess|pg||
pc|h9|nt|poohbear: if 4-2 then not|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s8|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|kit: He should have cashed ace of diamonds, club to ace, ruffing finesse in diamonds, and play club.  Then 3-3 clubs wouldn't hurt him unless I'm missing something.|pg||
