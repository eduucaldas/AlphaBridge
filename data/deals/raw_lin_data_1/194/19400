nt|othered1: rehi, everybody!|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|chorush: hi Kit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Let me find N-S' CC|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: NS in danger of having their 4 spade contract stolen|pg||
nt|othered1: Have preemptive NT bids struck again here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: does anyone know where east west is from?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Asya, you have reversed a couple of letters in East's name. It should be  Pachtmann|pg||
nt|kit: Not attractive to sell to 3@D with a diamond void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: from Israel|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||
nt|kit: If North does reopen with double or 3@S, South would surely bid 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: okie and we are off|pg||
nt|swanson: The high card count is not as important as distribution when balancing against an auction like this.  If North hand one more heart he would surely double.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: right John -- shape before strength, always|pg||
nt|chorush: Potentially big swing for Shwartz. They will pick up _110 instead of -420 or -450|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I also have EW's CC I think. One moment|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|swanson: (And one fewer black cards - he is not - balancing witn 14 cards is unlikely to be succssful.)|pg||

nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: there is a problem because the Screen has no flap... :/|pg||
nt|kit: we get to start off with a nice dull grand slam which won't be so easy to bid I don't think.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: perfect fit|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: hi William|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|joest: this is quite the fitting hand for a grand slam|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|kit: key question is whether Robinson will bid 3@S or think his hand is stronger|pg||
nt|joest: it's on the borderline|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we are starting this set about half an hour late|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|nt|timb: the 1=5 @C break would point the right way to play the @Ds|pg||
nt|joest: with spades 32 you don't need to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H shows a balanced 4@S call|pg||
nt|timb: true, i'm a bit slow this laye at nihjt|pg||
nt|joest: just curious: 4@s is some 'playing strength' call?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like 3@d = weak and natural|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Julian, David and Bill|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@d could be a good save|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All British team of commentators|pg||
nt|athene: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Hi Bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: it happens to everybody Tim.  Just keep putting out those great books of yours and we'll all be happy|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S would be a distributrional thing of some kind|pg||
nt|timb: I was thinking 7NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: good day all|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: This is an unusual use for a double jump reverse.  The most frequent use is short hearts of some kind.|pg||
nt|athene: south, with nothing in diamonds, doesn't mind massively if his partner wants to bid on here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do not think South's pass is forcing here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|joest: 0 or 3|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd can see the keycards, but not the fillers|pg||
nt|athene: but that was rarely going to happen|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  faling to X will not be costly as looks like only 1 down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: this would be a harder choice if dummy had @CKxx|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-16  for 1st quarter scores (except one)|pg||
nt|athene: because giving declarer an extra club trick for a heart pitch from his hand might be fatal|pg||
nt|athene: but here, playing the ace is not likely to cost because  a pitch from dummy on @CQxx is going to be useless|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South should be thinking what can declarer usefully throw from dummy on the @cQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as declarer cannot have @sKxx on the bidding, there wil be no useful discard|pg||
nt|athene: south just wondering if declarer might possibly have the bare @CQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps I should have phrased that differently after the previous set|pg||
nt|athene: i don'tt hink north can really have seven clubs but i suppose it's conceivable|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Kranyak-Schwartz do plenty of thinking without any encouragement :(|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: Robinson has the fillers, but he isn't in charge|pg||
nt|joest: now does 6@d ask for third round control?|pg||
nt|athene: certainly the jump to 4@S as a passed hand tends to be a two-suiter|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: but not 5-7 :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: no 3rd round control stuff I don't think|pg||
nt|kit: Now Boyd might bid 6NT, which has to suggest the grand|pg||
nt|joest: that is dynamite I agree.  Even good pairs revert to cue bidding or other stuff|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|kit: so laydown grand missed here -- and missed in other room also|pg||
nt|swanson: 6@S is no kings.  In the old days 6@C would show none and South could make a further try if he tought it was appropriate.|pg||
nt|timb: If there was a conventional agreement that 6@D over 5@C promise both minor suit kings...|pg||
nt|kit: 6@D would be offer to play I think|pg||
nt|timb: True but "if"|pg||
nt|joest: understood. Critical point for all partnerships.   In some I play it is an offer to play over a queen denial but not otherwise|pg||
nt|kit: Would have been better if North had been the RKC bidder.  He has the key queens, so he knows which kings are working.|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|swanson: If your opponents bid a making grand against you with 33HCP, a 4-4 fit, and no singletons, you aren't having a good session.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South should have no problem cashing tw9o aces when in |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson's shape was known to be 4-4-3-2, not 5-4-2-2 by the way|pg||
nt|timb: In my partnerships, given he had bid 4NT, partner would have denied 4+ diamonds |pg||
nt|athene: you can play hearts here and hope they cash out wrong|pg||
nt|athene: i guess|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer has to have 1 spade or you are not beating it|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|chorush: This bid willnot be what Ginossar was waiting for|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-16  for 1st quarter scores (except one)|pg||
nt|swanson: 3@H is natural and forcing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|chorush: 4 hearts can be beaten by ace of diamonds. I dont think 5 diamonds can be beaten|pg||
nt|kit: uh oh -- now a number is coming|pg||
nt|swanson: Not forcing on North, I don't think.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Undo please, Asya|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: East bid 3NT|pg||

nt|kit: I believe that Boyd should have gambled it -- try constructing hands Robinson can have which justify the 4@H call, and I don't think the grand will ever be worse than a finesse.|pg||
nt|joest: i was just thinking that|pg||
nt|athene: not any more :)|pg||
nt|athene: another club to force dummy there would not work|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could set up hearts and then run them through south and neutralize his trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS missed their spade game in the OR|pg||
nt|athene: so south had to cash the sapde|pg||
nt|athene: the spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but that was hardly a taxing defence to find|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kit: If the grand is no worse than a finesse and there is a reasonable chance it is laydown, the odds on bidding it at IMPs are good.|pg||
nt|joest: although AJxx/AQ/Axxx/QJx wouldn't be so hot. That's why 6@d as a 3rd round ask would be great|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wygbe1: well you could change the club qj into the heart king, same shape, no play|pg||
nt|kit: that hand wouldn't be a 4@H bid IMO|pg||
nt|kit: but you know he doesn't have the king of hearts!|pg||
nt|wygbe1: very true|pg||
nt|joest: Are Boyd and Robinson playing transfer responses?|pg||
nt|ady: seems 11 tricks were made in spades on hand 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 1@H shows spades, as seems clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: double here will be support|pg||
nt|joest: support X|pg||
nt|kit: so they will get to 4@S -- Robinson will probably invite|pg||
nt|joest: well over a 3@h raise the 3@s bid loses a little of its invitational flavor but south would carry on nonetheless|pg||
nt|wygbe1: you could stick the club q into the h suit, same shape = is that worth a 4h bid? |pg||
nt|swanson: This is a type of hand where support doubles really come to th fore.  If North returns to 2@S, South can bid 3@C to show extra values with a long club suit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know who is who?|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry all we are having some technical problems|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D reopening?|pg||
nt|athene: no-one really knows what 2@D, 3@D and 2@S show here by west|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  4@h, 5@d and 3NT all seem to have play|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Any kind of transfer type bid (rather than making a bid which might be passed) works better with a further message to say|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1this is wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: North would like to tranfer once again.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: do ns play 14-16 nt openers? or 15-17?|pg||
nt|kit: Now not clear if 3@S is invite or not -- But Boyd will go anyway|pg||
nt|kit: 15-17|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d will induce Berk to save|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: i think its 15-17 not sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt by north?|pg||
nt|athene: i think 2@D is a bit wet|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  with Bill here - 2@h hardly suggests a 3-loser hand |pg||
nt|athene: cayne doesn't ever seem to want to jump when he has a monster|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@d rather|pg||
nt|athene: it cost him a vul game last set|pg||
nt|athene: when he rebid only 2@C rather than 3@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only nonvul this time|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: However, e-W look like they will be saving|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: 4@d was an excellent call|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: Good decision by Boyd|pg||
nt|joest: was 4@s really alerted?|pg||
nt|kit: Cohler will probably go back to hearts now|pg||
nt|joest: i'm surprised he didn't the first time|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: Meckwell took push to 5@S in other room, so we should have new leader it looks like|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would East have bid 3NT over 3@d or raised the diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt |pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: i would imagine|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|swanson: This is a dangerous save - it will do well only because hearts are 2-2.|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- I think Cohler should have played in hearts|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|joest: yes it is.   diving in a 4-4 is not a growth industry|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|yorkbeach:  yes nearly all values are in the blacks|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D got home in OR   needs ace and anothr diamond start to defend|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps Cayne was giving Schwartz the chance to bid 2@s, suspecting that East could double 2@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  taking the risk of a missed non-vul game for the chance of a useful penalty|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  was quite disciplined of Schwartz to pass over 2@d - many players would just take one look at the sixth spade and bid 2@s|pg||
nt|athene: well this auction suggests strongly that east has a spade stack|pg||
nt|athene: west usually has a spade void to reopen with 2@D rather than double|pg||
nt|athene: so i think pass was judicious|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  either that or very short in @c, though as West could convert @c to @d, West could could afford to X 1@s even without @c support|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|dJ|nt|kit: apparently heart shift not found vs. 5@S at other table -- a disaster.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wygbe1: if s puts n in with spade for another club play, e will need to discard to prevent losing the heart suit|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|nt|swanson: Maybe 4@D should be used to show at least 5 diamonds; East could bid 3NT to show his actual shape.|pg||
nt|joest: now a club|pg||
nt|timb: if trumps were 4-1 we might need an abacus to calculate the damage|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Scored as made, we saw that it did not and Kranyak is disputing it|pg||

nt|chorush: then he was set 1 as you say|pg||
nt|kit: this particular 4th suit auction is always ugly, since the 4th suit bid is at the 3-level|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kit: 4@C presumably a slam try in spades -- no other way to make one|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|swanson: I would prefer a rasie to 2@S by South rather than 2@D, put the decision is a partership style matter - doesn't usually find it's way to a convention card.|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerability may silence EW here, at least if South opens|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H - 1@S; 2@S and you might get to 6@S i suppose|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in these days of RKCB, it is rare to bid a slam missing an ace and the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though on your sequence North may think the fit is 6-4 and not worry about the @sQ|pg||
nt|athene: he can ask over 2@S and find out how many spades his partner has|pg||
mb|1H|nt|joest: oh I thought maybe somebody underled diamonds to score a ruff|pg||

nt|joest: we will see Berk's hand in the Master Solvers Club in about 18 months|pg||
nt|joest: impossible decision|pg||

nt|kit: I don't know this one, sorry|pg||
nt|joest: they are bidding their four card majors up the lne|pg||
nt|joest: line|pg||
nt|timb: looking for a @D stopper?|pg||
nt|joest: maybe catching a heart raiase|pg||
nt|kit: It may be conventional looking for 4-card major -- I think it is something new in their methods|pg||
nt|athene: no 2@C from north?|pg||
nt|ady: 4 of either major  sees ok for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 2 i am told by the operator that 3nt was -2|pg||
nt|athene: do we have names for the players operator?|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is EW are lauria versace|pg||
nt|athene: but could be sementa duboin?|pg||
nt|ady: 4@Smade 11 tricks in open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, could you please put player names up?|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh i do trust you but canadians!?|pg||
nt|ady: auction in open room west 1@H   2@C   dbl    south 2NT    west 4@C   east 4@H   west 4@S   all pass   |pg||
nt|athene: a 2@C overcall might silence east; double isn't really ideal with only three hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but even a good raise from south isn't going to shut out west|pg||
nt|ady: not an every day auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: west is in 4@H here|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S 2@C P 2@S [@C raise] 3@H and now east is bidding 4@H or 4@S (or maybe 4@C choice of games, if he is given the room)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Schwartz-Kranyak  are N-S  against  Lauria-Versace|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so what is the likelihood EW can be talked out of game?  arrange these words into a common phrase: snowball's, hell, not, chance, in, a|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: most use 2NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|kit: this I know is conventional, looking for major-suit holdings|pg||
nt|joest: I have played 3@d a couple of ways here|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H shows 3 or 4 hearts I think|pg||
nt|swanson: Any bid other than pass my North looks like an effort to turn a plus into a minus.|pg||
nt|joest: looking for a three card major is one treament|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kit: E-W have no idea it is their hand|pg||
nt|joest: Well if Cohler is thinking ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: chances of getting to a slam with an immediate spade raise|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D now probably showing 3-5-4-1|pg||
mb|3D|nt|joest: when you open these hands with 3@c, 3NT by partner was not what you had in mind|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  loses the option to use 2NT as a natural game but can gain on big hands|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  natural game try|pg||
nt|athene: singleton club opposite is fairly good news for north|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kit: Boyd runs before anything happens|pg||
nt|timb: 3nt over 3@C would probably have got a @S lead...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but only three trumps in dummy is VERY bad news especially if you are going to try to establish hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so 4@S sensible|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but will be hard work to ruff 3@c|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yorkbeach:  seems that North planned to go for a slam only if South showed 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: can set up hearts    favourable lie|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4@C over 2NT might have been a splinter with four spades, say 4-5-3-1|pg||
nt|athene: and that would get north a bit more excited|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmmmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: very well done by NS in the other room to reach slam after the opposing 1@C opener|pg||
mb|1C|nt|joest: is this 3@h too big?|pg||
nt|joest: guess so|pg||
nt|swanson: A 3@C preempt with the South hand can cause serious problems for the opponents but creates havoc with consturctive bidding over your own preempts.  A partnership style.|pg||
nt|joest: Kit you would bid 3@h in your sleep, right?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  just what I was about to say|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: EW play fairly standard 5-card majors, strong notrump, short club - i am hunting for NS's convention card|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Yes, I would|pg||
nt|joest: transfer then key cards?|pg||
nt|joest: then a mournful signoff in 5@s|pg||

nt|sybarra: can Berk get back in iwth H!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: with @H?|pg||
nt|joest: not over 4@h he can't|pg||

nt|roswolf: just need to rightside the slam|pg||
nt|ady: still only 11 sure tricks    |pg||
nt|ady: trumps 3-0  but hearts ok  for 6@S|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair though south does not need very much from his partner|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the @dA and good spades|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: Anyone know contract, declarer and number of tricks on board 2, so that I can give Bruce the code|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: kranyak might be worried that schwartz has another very light overcall like the 1@H that got into trouble last set|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that neither South bid 3@h as a fit-showing jump|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I'm surprised -- I thought they made 4-level transfer and then RKC|pg||
nt|kit: Pass over the double shows doubleton spade I think|pg||
nt|athene: doubling 2@C is not very pre-emptive|pg||
nt|athene: how about 2nt or something|pg||
nt|athene: get the minors into it|pg||
nt|athene: partner might have five diamonds over there!|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a huge fan of 3@H fit showing because south is simply too strong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if the NS spade fit is only 5-3, West needs to be careful when vulnerable|pg||
nt|athene: you don't really need a fitting heart honour |pg||
nt|athene: and you don't need a club control|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no idea that South has so many spades|pg||
nt|athene: south should be just taking control|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: inly a club lead from south does not immediately give the 12th|pg||
nt|athene: i think Versace can happily bid 3@C there to show his long club suit without implying loads of hcp|pg||
nt|athene: because with any strong hand he would start with a double|pg||
nt|athene: first ask partner if he has total rubbish; when he says no, ask for keycards|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: they are playing 5@s in the open|pg||
nt|ady: as kibs suggest almost certain to make|pg||
nt|athene: it might look as though declarer is sure to succeed, even on a club lead, in 6nt, because both red suit finesses work|pg||
nt|athene: a fit-showing jump tries to make partner captain of the auction and south is too strong to want to do that, i think|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably North could have bid 2@s over 2@c X to show total rubbish|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: whoops|pg||
nt|athene: but there are ways to go down|pg||
nt|athene: you might play for a strip-and-throw-in on south, playing him for @HQ or @DK |pg||
nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|ady: best contract 6@C from east side   can ruff out the diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: i think Lauria intended that 4nt as blackwood|pg||
nt|roswolf: there could be an animated post-mortem on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, again, that is something that an experienced pair will have discussed but this NS might not have|pg||
nt|athene: yes i think on fast arrive principles, 2@S would be north's weakest action|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: maybe he should simply have bid 6NT - not really possible for Versace to have no ace|pg||
nt|athene: but not everyone agrees|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: I don't like a double here with the West cards.  You don't want to demand a heart lead, buying the contract is unlikely, and it gives help to the opponents in the auction and the ...|pg||
nt|swanson: play.|pg||
nt|ady: did not expect this swing|pg||
nt|athene: south is waiting patiently for a diamond control-bid|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: I agree John, but one hates to never bid with that hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: world class players having a bidding misunderstanding in a very simple sequence - there is hope for us mere mortals still|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ...and there we are|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is determined to reamain captain of this auction :)|pg||
nt|athene: now 4NT|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|kit: The 4@D call is a splinter, and when Robinson showed no interest Boyd gave up on slam -- reasonable|pg||
nt|kit: After all, could have been off 3 aces on a bad day.|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: what was wrong with good ol' blackwood?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is 5@s two way, either good controls and bad spades or good spades and bad controls?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard for North to go on with two heart losers|pg||
nt|athene: jumping to 5 of a major is most often a Partner Torture bid|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it says "i want you to bid slam with exactly xxxxxx but not yyyyyyy" and partner has to fill in the blanks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  that is what everyone tells me when I do it :)|pg||
nt|athene: i like my partner to bid blackwood :) i have at least a 60% chance of getting the subsequent auction right|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: 2nt from west over 2@C might have worked better in that north would not have been able to show extras immediately, as we think the pass after double did|pg||
nt|athene: also east might have bid lots of diamonds, which would have been exciting|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will need to set up the hearts to make enough tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c6|nt|athene: maybe he was still interested in a grand slam|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: of course, every pair must have its own rules about when 4NT is (or is not) blackwood, so it's hard to know who is to blame|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in view of West's opening bid and void in spades, declarer will not want to finesse East for the @hQ|pg||
nt|ady: once the trumps are 3-0  declarer would have to get things right with a ruffing finesse had west had QXXX hearts   but all is well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  whether declarer plays a ruffing finesse or simply hopes the @hQ falls in 3 rounds, the slam is there|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have four obvious tricks against 7@D (@HAK, ruff, @DA)- is that all?|pg||

nt|athene: great board at BAM|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so a possible 1 IMP gain blown :)|pg||
nt|athene: bidding diamonds might talk NS out of slam though|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. 1@C 1@S P 2@C 2N P 5@D and it's murky|pg||

mb|3D|mb|d|nt|joest: I've played it often and I think it's primary benefit is on hands where it is not used|pg||
nt|joest: you can respond 1NT a lot more often over 1@h and not have to worry about responding 1@s on Jxxx or something like that|pg||
nt|athene: the EW convention card does say they play modified turbo rather than blackwood when clubs are trump|pg||
nt|athene: certainly 4nt blackwood is not so much use in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Looks like both 2@S and 3@D are makes here, so possible pickup for Robinson|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead declarer will run round to ace|pg||
nt|athene: so turbo uses 4NT to say "i have an even number of keycards"|pg||
nt|ady: then obviously play on diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what 4nt said - "i have slam interest in clubs and an even number of keycards" and versace was not at libterty to pass it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South takes advantage of being passed hand to make what some call a pre-balancing action |pg||
nt|athene: east has good news/bad news - max hcp but soft and 433|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: The 3@C preempt gives West a difficult problem|pg||
nt|kit: With partner being a passed hand game less likely, so he chooses to pass -- but they still may lose a double part-score swign|pg||
nt|swanson: 3@C is heavy at these colors for most partnerships.|pg||
nt|chorush: or even a game swing, since 3NT is making|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|swanson: We see lots of 3@C preempt not vul vs vul with QJxxxx and a side singleton.|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|athene: interesting that Lauria passes 1@H; i would have thought 2@C was ok with that suit|pg||

nt|athene: they don't play support doubles, as mentioned before, so that was not an option|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|joest: 4@s is a bit pushy but 'I was vulnerable at IMPs' covers a lot of ground|pg||
nt|kit: hmm -- something may have gone wrong -- East hand surely not worth 4@S if 3@S preemptive, and West hand surely not worth limit raise|pg||
nt|joest: ok 4@s is a lot pushy |pg||
nt|kit: Still, on a better day 4@S might have made|pg||
nt|athene: worth a mention here that south bids 2@D as a cue rather than 2@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: here the matter should rest|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is more clearly a cue raise of hearts because south can't want to show diamonds naturally, after west bid them|pg||
nt|athene: given south passed over 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: but he might well have great clubs (e.g. 7 solid) and want to bid clubs naturally|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|ady: surely west wont sit for 2@H?|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||

pc|cA|nt|athene: and unless game is a possibility, you are risking a lot to gain little|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  after East had reopened with 3@d?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thde website to scores is OK; it's just that the server is slow and can't take too many hits at a time|pg||
pc|c8|nt|swanson: Yes, but North will fear ducking any red suit card from dummy for fear of giving up the contract.|pg||
nt|athene: south has no top heart honour and not the @H10 or @H9, so he should take that as a warning - his partner might just be bidding on a very good suit but nothing else|pg||
nt|athene: if south had better hearts it would be a lot more reasonable to be aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: since if partner hasn't got a great suit he should have a decent hand|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|ady: kib suggest down 1|pg||
nt|ady: maybe after no cover of J@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: seriously why south bid as he did is perplexing - surely you know the propensity of pards overcalls at this level|pg||
nt|athene: down only one is not possible|pg||

nt|joest: we have had a bunch of lead changes.  This match has been close throughout and remains so with 10 boards left|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south thought that the misunderstanding over 4NT meant he could take liberties - that's a rash assumption; EW don't give a whole lot away in the play or defence|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|joest: anyone for Garbage Stayman here?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: should n bid 2c, planning to pass any response?|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson can bid 2@C puppet, and get to 2@D|pg||
nt|swanson: IT is very considerate of the players to be giving us such a close match.  Many of the realy round matches were surprising runaways.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  curious choice of contract in the OR|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest: I would prefer to be playing 'regular Stayman' on this one|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, playing normal Stayman can and would have same auction|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting that north chooses double rather than 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: normally you bid 2@H with five and a strong hand|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for n/s   but still seems only 11 tricks in hearts   unless diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe they play negative free bids? (immediate 2@H would be non-forcing)|pg||
nt|ady: chance in 5@C for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: early|pg||
nt|swanson: This is an auction where it is almost never a winning action to balance.  Don't even look at your hand.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  club suit lost in the bidding, as happens from time to time|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  bidding geared towards all the other suits|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: Cohler hates to sell to 2@D with a stiff diamond, but has no convenient way into the auction|pg||
nt|joest: and that's for the best!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: 2NT in other room, will fare a lot worse.|pg||
nt|joest: the hesitation suggests perhaps short diamonds in east and starting diamonds from the dummy|pg||

nt|roswolf: a pass missed out here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H bid by north|pg||

nt|athene: if he pulls three rounds of trumps|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  the pre-emptive 3! raise did its job - forced the opponents to guess and they guessed wrong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s raise|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: fortunately he need only 8 tricks, so has margin for error|pg||

nt|athene: i think that was +2, not +3?|pg||
nt|ady: squeezed|pg||
nt|roswolf: methinks only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: hands where you have a big side suit fit but a thin trump suit are a real pain because you can't crossruff |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes would be a good try - if North ducks, you can make it - not that I can see a good reason to duck|pg||
nt|athene: you have to draw trumps to use your side suit but you can never do that and keep control|pg||
nt|ady: diamond now|pg||

mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  different problem...|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  South is enjoying this :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S perhaps from south|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is unlikley to have 5@s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest: now all Berk has to do is duck the jack of spades lead!|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: 3n rates to go down on spade lead, unless w makes amazing duck of first trick|pg||
nt|joest: btw ducking is nuts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but no certainty of having 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: cash the @CK first, i guess, as you can only pick up 4-0 with south|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North knows South is either very weak or has only 3@s because South had the chance to bid 1@s over 1@h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders know too :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|joest: so this looks to be a push at -50|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|swanson: This would not be a good time for 'coded' leads where jack is top.  Declarer would find the winning duck.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

pc|sK|nt|joest: yes last set another hand came up which showed that convention in a poor light|pg||
nt|wygbe1: very true|pg||
nt|joest: one of many examples I'm afraid|pg||
nt|joest: so Berk has to hope the @HA is in the right hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|ady: not a pleasant hand to play|pg||

pc|h4|nt|yorkbeach:  one sure entry to hand with the @hK and another possible entry by ruffing a good heart - how best to use them?|pg||

nt|swanson: Berkowitz is asking everybody to check the backs of the cards at this point.|pg||
nt|joest: cards lie very favorably for east-west|pg||
nt|kit: Cohler is lighter than Berk will be playing him for -- by quite a bit.|pg||
nt|athene: a very offensively-oriented double in the other room backfired|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: Problem with that sort of overcall is always the third opponent|pg||
nt|swanson: 1@C opening looks fine to me, but I don't see any merit in a 1@D overcall.|pg||
nt|joest: of course if they roll 600 he'll forgive him|pg||
nt|athene: if you are going to double on hands like that it means partner can never ever pass them|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this is a common misunderstanding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the pace may be slow but at least the systems are not too complicated|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: but four looks the limit|pg||
nt|athene: it's not enough to know a double is "takeout"|pg||
nt|roswolf: great result for schwartz in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: you have to know "HOW takeout-ish?"|pg||
nt|athene: in other words how often is partner allowed to pass it? is a decent 4-card trump holding enough?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|athene: 2@H from north now|pg||

nt|vugraphzfg: N pulled pass card then changes to 2s|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS COULD BE DANGEROUS|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South overcalled 2NT at the other table to show 5-5 in @H and @c|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: south will try 3@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  simplifies the auction but makes it hard to find a 5-3 @s fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: has anyone ever cue bid with a hand as big as WEst's and NOT heard their partner sign off?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you cannot do everything|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Why not 3@C with the South hand after partner rebids clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he will try 4@S :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: because that would be invitational|pg||
nt|roswolf: another double|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@s should be non-forcing but perhaps ns haven't played together much|pg||
nt|roswolf: well only 50's|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S definitely sounds non-forcing to me|pg||
nt|athene: north had lots of ways to force, didn't he?|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead in 5@C best   with only 2 tricks outside clubs  will need 9 trump tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW @d fit should tell North that South is void|pg||
pc|dA|nt|joest: surely Berkowitz will hit him out|pg||
nt|joest: let him out|pg||
nt|bessi2: but.. his pd did freely bid 1@s and south has a very pretty hand|pg||
nt|athene: sure|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: even though he has shown his hand with 1NT, in a way|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: That third opponent will get you every time|pg||
nt|wygbe1: west having trouble envisioning red v white overcall that wont produce game|pg||
pc|h5|nt|joest: a pass would have been plus at both tables and a six imp gain|pg||
nt|athene: he still has a better hand for play in spades than he might have|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: that is why 3@S was perfectly justified|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: well, ok, 3@S was not ridiculous|pg||
nt|bessi2: I fell 3@s is about the value bid.. I think pass is too cautious|pg||
nt|athene: i think cayne should just have bid 2@S over 2@D, personally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner passes with 18 and 5 decent trumps and it makes +1....he has a right feel a bit miffed|pg||
nt|athene: of course Seamon never feels miffed :) but he has a right to there|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|swanson: It may be a 'switcheroo' where 2@D and 2@H are reversed.  The advantange of that treatment is that you can stop in 2@H with invitational hands.  Here Sementa would have bid over ...|pg||
nt|swanson: 2@H.|pg||

mb|3H|nt|joest: does double here show both majors or no majors?|pg||
nt|bessi2: Kranyak is doing a lot of bidding at the moment|pg||
nt|athene: now lauria might look more kindly on his @Sxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that was a fairly horrible holding initially, but if the opponents have a nine-card fit, and you think partner can handle the force...|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi computer crashed:(|pg||
nt|athene: as mentioned before, versace doesn't miss a whole lot of games|pg||
nt|athene: north and south both had good hands|pg||
nt|athene: just a matter of keycards|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bessi2: scwartz will surely bid 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: dbl and an easy trump lead|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|joest: great board a match result for n-s|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead is sort of auto here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: i would think dbl by w would show both majors - maybe he bid 2h for the lead, expecting to be outbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i remember in bridge magazine bidding panels, when Tony Forrester thought it was obvious to double, he would just put "i lead a trump" as his proposed bid :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: North's eyes sort of rolled from side to side at dummy|pg||
nt|ady: 5 level too high    the best hope for Cayne they get that high|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: as wilde might have said - "to reach six missing two aces might be counted a misfortune; to reach six missing two aces and the king of trumps looks like overbidding"|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bessi2: I don't like to say it.. but I feel south got what he deserved with that 3@s bid|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|joest: or if he played it there he wanted to play in the stronger trump suit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|athene: i'm told NS are a fairly new partnership|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: and on board 6, 9 and 10 here we see the same thing|pg||
nt|athene: both players getting aggressive on the same hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|athene: and ending overboard|pg||
nt|athene: it suggests each is used to playing with a "sounder" partner|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|swanson: Could one double with 4-2-2-5, planning to pull 2@H to 3@C?|pg||
nt|swanson: to 2@S I mean|pg||
nt|joest: i suppose.  When I do that it goes 3@d on my left and partner bids 3@h :)|pg||
nt|swanson: Then you have to bid 3@S.  Just have a few values for the double.|pg||
nt|swanson: It is never far wrong just to bid one's suit, however.|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|joest: when I 'expand' on a convention, bad things usually happen|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  plenty of minor suit contracts this set|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: north in the other room treated his hand as a limit raise in diamonds (i assume that is what 3@C was anyway)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not obvious to reach game|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D looks a bit wet to me|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: ok looks as though NS play some sort of two-way club|pg||
nt|roswolf: all roads lead to 3nt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|swanson: It might be tempting for East to make an agressive game try here.  Won't work out well.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and to me|pg||
nt|athene: north might try 3@S now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trying to catch up now...|pg||
nt|athene: now he knows his partner probably has a singleton in hearts at most|pg||
nt|ady: club honors lay well for n/s   loos like they may play part score|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: it is an interesting sign of the times that partners open all 11 counts but responders keep right on making game tries with hands like east's. Everybody likes to bid :)|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C = min bal or any strong i guess|pg||
nt|athene: they might be in a 30-point-pack|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard for South to envisage 11 tricks facing a single raise|pg||
nt|ady: initial 2@D raise conservative|pg||
nt|athene: south will now be wondering if his partner could possibly have four spades|pg||
nt|athene: if he does, 4@S will be the spot|pg||
nt|athene: if he doesn't, it really won't, as the wrong hand is getting forced|pg||
nt|athene: playing a 4-3 fit you want the 3-card trump holding to take the force|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if diamonds were 2-2, you might make 5@d with just one club honor right (so long as you guess well)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it all comes down to that initial evaluation from north|pg||
nt|athene: when he showed a good 3@D bid, south took the plunge|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: if Boyd leads a club this will be over before Cohler gets started|pg||
pc|h4|nt|swanson: South does need to lead a club, however.|pg||
nt|athene: when he shows "merely" a good 2@D bid, even though that is only a whisker less...it's enough to dissuade his partner|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: cash the @HAJ and knock out the @DA for at least ten tricks i suppose|pg||
nt|ady: seems a decent raise to 3 level  ie 2@S  first round|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  2@H|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in the OR, when South took the plunge, I do not think North had to have nothing wasted in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of illustrates meckstroth's maxim|pg||
nt|athene: always early in the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if you have to choose between underbidding slightly and overbidding|pg||
nt|athene: overbid!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  still at least they were consistent - if you bid a slam on 26, you can hardly bid less than game here|pg||
nt|athene: you can't catch up if you don't|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|joest: is this the right major suit 7 that Cohler led?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: lots of books, bridge teachers, scholarly articles, etc say you should underbid rather than overbid|pg||
nt|athene: as "it is easy to catch up later"|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: they are wrong and meckstroth is right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it depends upon whether your bid is likely to end the auction|pg||

nt|joest: I'msure Rodwell played it well but it seems he might have received a helping hand|pg||
nt|kit: So likely to get heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: East will know declarer has four hearts and South four spade by the time this is over and will avoid a major suit lead.|pg||
nt|kit: yes Jack, a mis-discard at the end|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will be hard to apply the breaks now West has reversed|pg||
nt|ady: can keep out of game on this auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  how?|pg||
nt|athene: was that a typo for "can't"? :)|pg||
nt|ady: would 4@C be absolutely forcing|pg||
nt|ady: if 3@D is forcing to game  best just to rebid 3@C  especially with partner bidding hearts|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: 2@S showing values i guess, suggesting to partner that notrumps will be wrong if he has a singleton club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  leaves room for partner to bid 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: no, North's heart holding concealed|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bessi2: I don't like that 3N bid very much.. why not 3@c|pg||
nt|ady: because you would expect more from opener?|pg||
nt|athene: well just because i would never be sure it was non forcing|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|joest: Robinson's heart suit concealed off this puppet auction|pg||
nt|joest: Berk will discourage|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: Means declarer will get the heart suit right eventually, but still only 8 tricks unless a misdefense|pg||
nt|ady: then best for west to supress 2nd suit when the auction has taken a bad turn|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at matchpoints you might  take view but not in an important match|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 3@C over 2@S was an option|pg||
nt|athene: it's difficult; partner might of course pass 3@C with something horrible like 5-5 in the reds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North should have a count on the spade suit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: looks like upside down discouragement|pg||
nt|swanson: Wouldn't the 7 (instead of the 6) be a bit easier for East to read?|pg||
nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|kit: a lot easier John -- I don't think the 6 is readable|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Robinson played the 4, giving his own encouraging signal|pg||
nt|joest: on the general theory that declarer must adopt the defender's signalling methods|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|kit: If Cohler does continue hearts, I think Robinson will have very good chances|pg||
nt|joest: the demonstrably correct theory|pg||

nt|roswolf: on this lead you can set up the hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: a good swing likely for schwartz|pg||

nt|bessi2: Schwartz superior judgment with that 3@c bid earned his side 10 imps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  7 IMPs back|pg||
nt|ady: still the gap closed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  another chance for Cayne|pg||
nt|athene: west should surely have redoubled 2@D in the other room rather than bidding 2@H|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bessi2: or at least his judgment was superior result wise|pg||
nt|athene: firstly he has equal length majors|pg||
nt|athene: secondly it will be worth a bit for east to be declarer|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: both to conceal the strength and to have the lead run up to the stronger hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm, 5@C might be preferable to 4@H here|pg||
nt|ady: e/w out  of trouble|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  many pairs do not have a penalty X of a strong 1NT available|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: what was 2@C|pg||
mb|2D|nt|joest: it would be nice if 3@c were forcing opposite a passed hand but i don't think it is|pg||
nt|joest: that leaves the 'agricultural' 3NT call i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: on board 60 it was a correct claim of 3nt making|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H needs hearts 3-3 onside|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C might make even on 4-2 hearts, as long as the king is right|pg||
nt|roswolf: i like 5@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  assume @c and another|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: we believe you operator.  WE just don't know how|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 3n by east down on h lead, but 3n by west should make|pg||
nt|joest: b/c hearts block|pg||
nt|kit: big chance for swing here -- 5@C cold, as is 3NT by West|pg||
nt|joest: maybe 3@c should be forcing |pg||
nt|joest: this hand would talk me into it|pg||
nt|wygbe1: they could try 6c, down |pg||
nt|athene: even on a bad break you have extra chances, like @DQx or a red squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  DONT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north passed assuming it was clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i guess|pg||
nt|athene: it could have been meckwell i.e. clubs and a major|pg||
nt|ady: is there not a rule with a limited hand  not to bid again opposite a passing partner?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: that is also possible|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMMM another lapse by the normally impeccable italians|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: wrong-sided now|pg||
nt|wygbe1: uh oh, wrongsided nt|pg||
nt|kit: And I would expect Boyd to choose his stronger suit to lead|pg||
nt|joest: of course 3@c now is forcing but it suggests spade shortness.  Berkowitz with an impossible bidding problem in standard (imho)|pg||
nt|kit: unless 2@H was real|pg||
nt|swanson: Tough for South to find a heart lead, expecting four hearts at his left.|pg||
nt|athene: yuck to 3@S in both rooms|pg||
nt|roswolf: south may kick himself|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: 4333 hands are unspeakably evil|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that perhaps it was west who bid 2@D|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: west who bid 2@C, sorry|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: the best u will attain with 3@S is to go -100 in 3@S two off vs -130 defending clubs|pg||
nt|athene: to gain 1 imp|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  yes but love all is a good time for competing the partscore|pg||
nt|athene: and decided to pass 2@D before the opponents woke up and brought out the axe|pg||
pc|cT|nt|joest: berkowitz hopes his 2@h call at least served to ward off a heart lead|pg||
nt|joest: and it did|pg||
nt|kit: LC says natural, so will lead spade|pg||
nt|kit: and match is very close again with 2 more boards -- and 63 won't be dull|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: the worst - well let's not think about it|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has had too much red meat|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure I would call it a lapse.. VERY difficult to bid|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: survived here|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we will find out in a minute I hope if the bidding is wrong|pg||
pc|c2|nt|swanson: This hand is a demostration of how difficult it is to 'settle' for minor suit games when 3NT is a possibility.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|joest: it's easier at imps b/c you don't get punished for being in five of a minor instead of 3NT if they bothmake|pg||
nt|joest: in a bidding contest, 5@c is the top spot here|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C does seems strange from south|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we have confirmation that the bidding is correct|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|d2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|bessi2: the bidding progressed in the same manner in the open room until that 4@c bid where proojinen bid 4@h, probably because their 1@h opening is often only 4 cards I beliee|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|s2|nt|roswolf: hmm north cant believe south has 4 card support and passed over 2@S|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: well east could see the 5-2 fit might be ok if his pd has two spades and a doubleton heart honour|pg||
nt|athene: if they play std count south has to have four? wouldn't raise on two would he|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2 BDS LEFT AND SCHEDULED RESTART IS IN 15 MINS|pg||
nt|roswolf: any problem bruce?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Kranyak left table gone for more red meat:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: back|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  both sides were applying the principle that nobody is vulnerable you should bid... because if you go down you go dwon in 50s|pg||

nt|ady: now level|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  could be exciting for those of you able to stay|pg||
mb|1D|nt|joest: Meckwell have arrived in 6@h on these cards at the other table|pg||
nt|roswolf: very competitive in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S is not such a bad contract for NS, is it?|pg||
nt|athene: especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is decent... 2 finesses, not to mention the very live possibility of a @d lead from the K|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, diamond lead from the king is quite possible|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You only have to wait 2 hours|pg||
nt|athene: sementa had to pass in the other room because 2@C overcall would have been 5-4 majors?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And you can't even be certain that they will continue with this match|pg||
nt|athene: there is no end to the indignities the club suit has to endure these days :(|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  another solid looking result for Cayne in the OR|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: good 6@H contract here, reached in other room|pg||
mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  are they as slow having dinner as they are playing?|pg||
nt|athene: now east might cue to get to 4 of a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Danger is getting too high -- they will certainly be in the slam|pg||
nt|wygbe1: seems they should reach it after this start|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: a good hand for 'serious 3NT"|pg||
nt|roswolf: well depending on the style of vul weak 2's i think 4@S is automatic here|pg||
nt|bessi2: I would just bid 4@s directly with the north hand.. |pg||
nt|roswolf: so would i|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: Of course, 7@H can make -- and maybe it would out of desparation|pg||
nt|joest: playing that Boyd must cue bid a diamond control no matter how bad his hand|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n bids blackwood, will find out no diam king|pg||
nt|kit: 4@D is not a diamond control -- it is a last train sort of bid|pg||
nt|athene: the trouble with passing now is, what do you do when south bids 4@C?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe seamon is intending to double and defend|pg||
nt|athene: in view of his singleton diamond, and the vulnerability|pg||
mb|4C|nt|swanson: An improbable spade lead would make 6@H difficult for declarer.|pg||
nt|athene: this won't work out well|pg||
nt|athene: now the @SK gets exposed|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when versace can't overruff|pg||
nt|bessi2: lol.. versace will drop his pd's K of @s|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kit: 4@S is RKC|pg||
nt|joest: ic|pg||
nt|athene: wow, hasn't cayne just bid his hand a lot of times?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|joest: not showing the void|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6@c + 1@d + 1 ruff = 800 in 4@c doubled if my counting is right|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he assumes from the NS bidding that his partner has a fit somewhere and some values|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure this will be dbled|pg||
nt|athene: but can't his partner bid his own hand?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  crazy to bid 5@h on a 4-4 fit|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: :(|pg||
mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  I wonder whether Larry Cohen is watching. |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course declarer might just throw his diamond loser on the third club|pg||
nt|athene: and play for both kings onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: if clubs continued declarer might well divine the trump position|pg||
nt|athene: cayne bids his hand AGAIN|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Who said the 5-level belongs to the opponents? Ed Manfield and Ron Klinger, and they were absolutely right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  A 9-card fit one way and a 8-card fit the other does not saye both sides |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should be bidding at the five level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  say|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|athene: but the failure to play the third club is itself suspicious|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so let's say double of 3@D just showed good diamonds, fine|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wygbe1: well done|pg||
nt|joest: a trump start seems best|pg||
nt|wygbe1: diam lead will probly speed up the play|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: best lead -- now declarer has problems|pg||
nt|kit: far from clear how this hand should be played|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson has to make it now to keep the lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer counts 5 hearts, 1 spade, 2 clubs, 2 diamonds - needs another two tricks.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: of course, west can also NOT overruff the third club with @SKxx, as a nice grosvenor|pg||
nt|athene: now 4@C says "i have 4-4-6-0 and a great hand"|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bessi2: now he can play the club throw the diamond and be sure |pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: now obvious:)|pg||
nt|athene: now if declarer hooks hearts first|pg||
nt|athene: he might decide that west would have bid with all he has AND the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: like a 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: fine|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: so where did he find 5@H?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  has anyone worked out how many IMPs West's 5@h has blown?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 14 or 15|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  was 800 on offer in 5@c X?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|swanson: Maybe ruff a club and lead a low diamond?|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, it's all a bit irrelevant in 3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bessi2: still worth 2 imps for Schwartz|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might get out for -1 and hold the loss to 2 IMPs but a big missed opportunity|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  needs to play a diamond|pg||
nt|stc: on @d N discards @s|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h6|nt|kit: at other table, won heart, club ruff, drew trumps, diamond finesse.  Now spade back would have beaten them, but wasn't found|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  with 25 HCP and an 8-card @s fit NS should reach 4@s ... but stranger things have happened this set|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  like this 2@c overcall|pg||
nt|athene: north can't act over 2@C really|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a fan of the 2@C bid because it is just so likely to pre-empt your side out of spades or notrumps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: weirdly, it can work out better to overcall very heavy at the 1-level as it's less likely to end things|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  indeed - prefer X or 1NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: when the @H8 falls first round declarer has a guess which way to play for 4-1 trumps - he can pick either up|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|joest: even rolling this would not be good enough so congratulations to the Spector team|pg||
nt|joest: and thanks to all the players for a great match|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. after a 1@C opener you can overcall 1@D on almost anything as it never gets passed out|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  rattled perhaps by the previous board?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: thanks operator|pg||
nt|ady: another swing for Cayne|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bessi2: good result for Schwartz in the open room.. 4@h seems like a very fragile contract|pg||
nt|athene: that is why the 8 is an obligatory falsecard from 108xx|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: not sure what the difference is between this and a simple 4@H from east over 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@C asks if versace has a good hand, 2@D says "no" so lauria settles for game|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I have a simple rule that if the hand is too strong for a 1NT overcall, it is too strong for a suit overcall|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|athene: lauria has played with versace for 20 years and versace has never had extras, but lauria is hopeful there will be a first time|pg||
