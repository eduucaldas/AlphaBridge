nt|bigtrain: ira:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|chorush: Hi Walter|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North must decide how many points to add for the long diamonds. |pg||
mb|3D|an|natural, inviitational|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: even had the diamonds split 2-2 there is a suit blockage and they cant pay for 6 tricks in nt|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brolucius: A well-judged pass from South, who had good diamond support but not much outside for his bid.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell carding is all upside/down including suit preference and smith echo|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|chorush: As the cards lie, Fantoni will have to guess the diamond layout to make|pg||
nt|barnets: still likely down 2|pg||
nt|chorush: sorry, to be set only 1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: There is no reason to play for diamonds to be 3-1, because then one of the defenders might have found a bid.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes especially when they are NV|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and an aggressive pair |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|barnets: 1n was the best spot here and would make|pg||
nt|henryb:  reverse suit preference, so the low club suggests spades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we can see both spade honors are wrong but declarer will be thinking about how to play the suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: North-South play a highly unusual system where the bids from 1@C to 1@S suggest at least 14 points and are forcing.|pg||
nt|chorush: Its not clear to me that a heart lead wouldnt establish 3 hearts and still require 4 diamonds for a male|pg||
nt|brolucius: All the two-level suit openings show 10-13 points and a particular range of shapes. |pg||
nt|henryb:  and 1N covers all other 10-13 shapes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: except 5@S and 4@H i think|pg||
nt|kit: seems like declarer will just play ace of diamond, diamond to king (hoping for 2-2) and spade to jack, hoping to limit loss in the major suits.|pg||
nt|barnets: in the closed north opened 2@D and this went PP Xnd e/w now playing 3@H|pg||
nt|henryb:  He did not open 1N because he was too strong|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  when he finds a trump loser, he may assume the @hA is onside|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|brolucius: North here could not open a weak 2@D because that opening shows 5+ diamonds and 10-13 points.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: hi all the match has begun but there is an issue with the hands so please stop asking me to change the names of the players i will do it thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator, the spelling of the N-S names are not accurate|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Lauria|pg||

nt|gambit: not exactly the meek vs. the meek, more like battle of the titans|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|daman: here we go|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Krishna|pg||
nt|ady: if Katz has a natural 2@D opening South might try 3NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|daman: fantunes are at the other table    they are slow players|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  No problem with the names, just pretend the 'n's are 'r's|pg||
nt|daman: and we're off and pacing|pg||
nt|chthonic: NS might get overboard.|pg||
nt|ady: will fail |pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Welcome to 3rd quarter of Spingold Semi-Finals|pg||
nt|joest: Zia proving that 3rd seat nonvulnerable is not 100% forcing: even on him|pg||
nt|joest: with 11 highs and only a spade stiff, Zimmerman will toss this back in|pg||
nt|daman: I think that the next cycle begins with the 2012 Spingold Jack|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/component/content/article/2-latest-news/988-hamman-joins-new-team-for-next-cycle|pg||
nt|joest: One common rule of thumb in fourth seat: add your HCP + your   of spades.  If 15 or more, open.  If not, pass|pg||
nt|daman: not enough pearson points to open|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: ok, color me surprised :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: that is quite a view     to pass 2@D|pg||
nt|chthonic: But not -- south did not overreact to his "points"|pg||
nt|psyck: Not the suit I'd like for a 1st seat weak 2, buf normal 2@d NV i guess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gambit: :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hi again to Cam and Walter|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Terry, Walter and Cam|pg||
nt|gambit: hi Jo....|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C shows 8+ minors over 1@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they can be 53 either way even|pg||
nt|chthonic: worked.  Was not making 3N|pg||
nt|ady: Nickell decided not enough ace  even if diamonds run  especially on a heart lead|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gambit: 4@S from Eric, what else|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gambit: look at Meck's raise!|pg||
nt|gambit: indeed|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Rodwell just might eek out 8 tricks........|pg||
nt|gambit: Zia might not make 5@D* off three toppers|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe even 9|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello again|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gambit: :)|pg||
nt|gambit: ok now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is art GF|pg||
nt|joest: the theory is: either you partner has spades (which will force you to rebid which is bad) or the opponents have spades and can outbid you so your cheapest exit is passing right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Hi Jo Anne|pg||
nt|gambit: delaying the inevitable|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT shows 9 minors with a singleton spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|ady: well bid hand    this should make on the nose|pg||
nt|psyck: with @c33, only 1 loser in each suit|pg||
nt|chthonic: Would seem to be  making, yes|pg||
pc|d7|nt|joest: George points out that the change will not take place until next year's spingold so Zia-Hamman will still play the REisinger and Vanderbilt this year|pg||
nt|daman: they need to get a @D trick before the @Cs are set up to beat|pg||
pc|d6|nt|casenjo:  this will only make on a non-@H lead|pg||
nt|gambit: Can N lead a heart? |pg||
nt|gambit: no....|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|psyck: even overtrick if @s trick dissappears|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT -2 is better than -140|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gambit: will make it now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|casenjo:  Hamman would have overcalled 1@H, he loves those good 4 card suits,, but unfortunately, he is sitting North|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|peachy: Nickell luck is on|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|h7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|chthonic: whatever the details, it won't be much of a swing -- small score to EW in both rooms likely.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|h3|nt|ady: should be able to place K@H with North|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: south has shown up with a lot already|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|ady: can make an overtrick by finessing hearts and playing 3rd heart|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 1@S shows 4+|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Nunes has the last board and is looking at the hands|pg||
nt|barnets: 1N by north is fraught with danger|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|brolucius: Because E/W play a strong 1@C system, they have more freedom to open light with the other one-bids.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Rodwell can just preference to 2@H I think, since his partner is limited|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yorkbeach:  yes you have game available when they open and respond more often than against other pairs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@D is known to be weak, because he could otherwise have bid a 4th suit 3@C.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is natural and invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Larry, if the @sJ was the @dJ, maybe, but I think the @sJ is not worth a point towaards the 20|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C would have established a GF, yes|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yorkbeach:  so many pairs could duplicate this auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: I prefer Kit's preference to 2@H, rather than 2NT.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Fantunes treat H98 as an interior sequence|pg||
nt|kit: assuming East opens the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 9 is either top from an odd number  or any honor 98... any length|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: When a bid shows, say, 10-15 points, 10 points is more likely than 11, 11 is more likely than 12, etc...  So, there is no reason to hope for a maximum.|pg||
nt|henryb:  but wouldn't Eric treat the W hand as a 2@c opener? so he has an opening bid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  yes system card shows 9xx and 9xxxx as possible holdings but not 9xxx|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kit: In Rodwell's defense, on a better day Meck would have a doubleton club honor and 3NT might roll with the help of the club suit.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  likely to go one down|pg||
nt|sudi:  V |pg||
nt|bigtrain: certainly roddy's hand has options...  i'm sure no one is surprised that he took the high road|pg||
nt|kit: Fantoni has logical trump return I think, looking at his strong diamond holding.|pg||
nt|henryb:  In fact, Rodwell, imho, has a better opening bid than Meckstroth|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better not to take the high road when your friend and partner is on the low road.|pg||
nt|barnets: with |pg||
nt|barnets: a trump shift dec wont make the @SQ|pg||
nt|kit: Problem is Fantoni doesn't know which black singleton declarer has|pg||
nt|barnets: without a trump shift dec needs 5 trump tricks along with 2 spades and 2 clubs|pg||

nt|joest: diamond shift as well as diamond underlead|pg||
nt|chthonic: Could not have anticipated that line.|pg||
nt|ady: start with 4 imps to Nickell   so all square|pg||
nt|chthonic: So, four IMPs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: he took so long he fell asleep|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: bsr henri|pg||
nt|daman: time for a slam|pg||

mb|p|nt|gambit: range? Where is Al Holland when you need him?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 5+@D GF|pg||
nt|daman: hey don't play well unless they are 40-50 behind|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: Hi Henri|pg||
nt|joest: 6NT is best b/c it can make even if hearts do not come home|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 2NT probably a club transfer|pg||
nt|daman: Sominex Coup|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: 15-17|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is waiting|pg||
nt|joest: in some partnerships, 4@c now by south shows 4 clubs + 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: but we'll see how they do it|pg||
nt|daman: trump|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: hardly expect a heart lead here|pg||
nt|psyck: W could have tried more on 2@d, but settled for 2@h NV|pg||
pc|c6|nt|joest: at this point Hamman would like to use double roman key card for hearts and clubs|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gambit: J@S lead after that auction |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Roddy knows Jeff is broke|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.archiviobridge.it/lauria-versace.pdf  NS card. It is a WBF card but surely they havvent changed much|pg||
nt|casenjo:  For those non-Precision people, please read Bigtrain's commentary for perfect explanations|pg||
nt|tez: 8 of @s great card:)|pg||
nt|gambit: assuming E/W can unblock the clubs, this is an easy defeat |pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, and we see it went down in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: but i don't know if they play that|pg||
nt|joest: he just cares about aces, the heart king, and the round queens|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ace lead from AKx(x); meck's signal is standard|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hi Walter|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi joanne|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a diamond  cash K@C  and ruff a club  and ruff a diamond with A@H|pg||
nt|daman: Rodwell bid 2NT over 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: thats 6 tricks    then play 4th club and discard a spade|pg||
nt|chthonic: As would I.|pg||
nt|chthonic: But they are playing Precision, so it would be less likely to do so for them.|pg||
nt|chthonic: I would think|pg||
nt|daman: they always scratch for a makeable game|pg||
nt|chthonic: Can trick two be so hard?|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, E's hand more likely to be lighter other room than this room, that did not stop Rodwell from inviting |pg||
nt|chthonic: Ace of D, ruff, cash KC, maybe play another club and pitch a spade, ....|pg||
nt|daman: look how long he took on the last one|pg||
pc|dA|nt|joest: that looks like two + a queen|pg||
nt|joest: some pairs have steps that distinguish which queen, or whether both queens|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|peachy: Glad to have Walter here, he knows Meckwell system |pg||
nt|gambit: puts terror into the heart of the declarer, he doesn't know E can't get the lead...|pg||
nt|casenjo:  for the hundres watching 'bigtrain' was my first bridge teacher at Ohio State|pg||
nt|gambit: wow...nice to have such a mentor|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|joest: this sounds like it could be to play|pg||
nt|joest: 6@c is still safer than 6@h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|casenjo:  I'm happy with the results :)|pg||
nt|daman: six key card that shows @C Q and not @H Q|pg||
nt|joest: thanks George|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|psyck: This will probably be the last set these two pairs play, with the other two pairs finishing the final two sets|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gambit: nice lead, and fortuitous break. Wd by Roddy |pg||
nt|peachy: Rodwell might/might not be having discard trouble soon\|pg||
nt|gambit: Declarer fantazing about Kx@D onside allowing contract to make, but not today|pg||
nt|bigtrain: won't have much of a problem|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Was Meckstroth's 9@H a spade indicator?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  If so, Eric can safely pitch a spade|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bigtrain: yeah he really likes that 10 :)  seriously it was count...  remember they play upside-down suit preference|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|psyck: Good - Bad does not apply in this seq, it is when RHO makes a 2 level bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gambit: he want to lead a heart but can't from that holding|pg||
nt|joest: of course from his point of view that is conceding going down unless he drops the king|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gambit: hmmm|pg||
pc|dK|nt|casenjo:  Nice lead by Jeff Meckstroth|pg||
nt|gambit: that helps the def|pg||

nt|bigtrain: E pitched3 spades which squeezes W in 3 suits|pg||

pc|cT|nt|bigtrain: hamman zia never exposed south's distribution so the defense was guessing|pg||

nt|ady: defenders cant attack spades with any success  and a club trick can be set up for a discard   though Katz can ruff the 3rd club  but that is with his trump trick|pg||

mb|2H|nt|kit: very light overcall -- presents problems for partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: Three rounds of diamonds may make life difficult for declarer in 4@H.|pg||
mb|3H|an|club fit ;often short hearts|nt|kit: I think 3@H shows a good club raise|pg||
nt|brolucius: If this is a splinter bid, then declarer has more chance of guessing the hearts right in 4@H.|pg||
nt|kit: N-S likely will be propelled into 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 3@H was so much better than the 3@C that many would choose.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: ... after ruffing the third diamond with the @HA.|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  North is expecting to get another chance to show his heart support|pg||
nt|barnets: @SA ;ead from south\|pg||
nt|barnets: lead from south @SA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  partner did bid @s, so may well find that lead|pg||
nt|kit: South would certainly lead ace of spades vs. 5@C whether spades bid or not -- plan of finding partner's red ace and getting ruff.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|kit: Aggressive bid -- Meckstroth may have projected the singleton heart in his partner's hand -- figures partner has some shortness, and not spades since spades not raised.|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  for the benefit of those of you who cannot hear Roland, if South plays in 4@h and West leads 3 @d |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will need to ruff high in dummy and guess whether East has J-x-x or West has J-x|pg||

nt|brolucius: My partners don't usually think so. |pg||

nt|brolucius: North declines to cover with the @SK, to give declarer a guess on the second round. |pg||
nt|barnets: same def exactly to 5@C so push board|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer can work out exact enemy distribution -- South presumably has only 6 hearts, and North known to have 2 diamonds, so North must be 3-5-2-3|pg||

mb|6H|nt|joest: I don't think 2@s goes for enough to compensate for a red game|pg||
nt|daman: nah    they want to be in game and not defending|pg||
nt|joest: anyway Hamman didn't want to wait around to find out|pg||
nt|joest: random unbiddable spot cards can affect that kind of result|pg||
nt|daman: plus   he LOVES to play 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: i'm being told it goes 800 on a trump promo which looks right.  That is still a random result and Hamman has a lifetime experience of whether it's worth passing 2@s at these colors|pg||

nt|chthonic: what a debacle.|pg||
nt|ady: got everything right to make 11 tricks in spades OR|pg||
nt|ady: cant accuse north of fielding a psche|pg||

nt|chthonic: could have picked up six IMPs improbably, but felt relieved, I imagine to have avoided a major loss.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gambit: all true|pg||
mb|2C|nt|joest: note that Hamman has both majors for his double.  I sometimes see newer players double with only one major here|pg||

nt|daman: @D Q was led|pg||

nt|chthonic: After that excitement, the players have to calm down and play each hand as if it were the only one that matters.  No matter how mundane.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2NT must be some form of Dormer limit raise|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT by some pairs here is "four card limit raise"|pg||

mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Wow and just told only a 2 imp difference in the other match with 10 boards to go|pg||
nt|gambit: the player in blue jeans was a friend, Doug Fox|pg||

mb|5C|nt|gambit: Meck?|pg||
nt|joest: that didn't prove so easy in the open room|pg||
nt|daman: but I wouldn't have bid 4@C with the west hand on board 20 either|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  2@H is a friendly little contract with 3-3 hearts and 3-3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 5 IMPs riding on it|pg||
nt|joest: this was the start next door, followed by ace and a spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: East hand *|pg||
nt|chthonic: Orttman would do well here...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gambit: Doug asked Ron if he he borrow thelighter...|pg||
nt|daman: if He leads the @S Ace    he can make|pg||
nt|ady: even 4@C can go down|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: and in fairness to West if a low spade comes back, a spade return (for a possible ruff) looks more appealing than leading away from the heart king|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||

nt|daman: yes it does|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gambit: @D through|pg||
nt|casenjo:  An interesting note, that applies to this match. Paul Soloway once said, "The average hand is a partial, the average hand is boring, the average hand I have played too many times to count...concentrating on ALL the hands is winning bridge"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gambit: the words of a champion and gentleman, brb|pg||
nt|ritong: in fact the trick is to recognize quickly the hands you can relax a bit, in order to save energy|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Boards 51 and 53 won 10 IMPS both determined by 'parials'|pg||
nt|casenjo:  partials|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|psyck: how should the bidding have gone after 2@c?|pg||
nt|daman: perhaps    2@D   or 2@H by South|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, 3D a bid extreme.|pg||
nt|chthonic: 3C is a tiny underbid -- maybe worth one cue bid -- 2H|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, I think both could bid less, though all comments so far are about S bidding less|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@d is as aggresive as 3@d in my opinion|pg||
nt|chthonic: I think South's choice of bids over the "free" 2C bid is crucial.|pg||

pc|h6|nt|brolucius: Even though he does (again) have some diamonds.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: previous lead was attitude because the had bid the suit;  Fantoni is explaining this lead with the help of a chart !  -- Meckstroth asks him to start again; it is a very long ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: explanation|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South has no attractive lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @C10 far from safe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: low is even without an honor or odd without an honor; higher spot is odd with no honor or even with an honor|pg||
nt|brolucius: South can expect there to be three hearts in dummy, since West was not interested in 5 spades.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|barnets: had n/s diamonds been reversed south could play THe @DK but declarer could reach dummy still with @HQ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  A benefit of using 2NT rather than 2@c as 5-card Stayman: North cannot X 2@c for the lead|pg||

nt|sybarra: and an entire set after this,   would not sell anyone short|pg||
nt|casenjo:  club lead in other room gave Hamman time for 12 trickes|pg||

nt|psyck: whech meands he played for all the rest of the high cards to be with S for the bidding|pg||

mb|p|nt|chthonic: And none to N, despite the raise.|pg||

mb|p|nt|chthonic: On last hand 1NT not forcing?  1S - 1N; 2D - 3D; 3N...??|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 3@C = both minors, less than invitational values|pg||

nt|sybarra2: did we miss a pass? |pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|chthonic: what was the problem?  I don't attribute to the 1S bid.|pg||
nt|daman: they play SEF    whcih is like sayc|pg||
mb|2C!|an|drury|nt|gambit: perhaps dble from N might help S do the right thing|pg||
nt|joest: I suspect Zia will bid 2@h.  It is worth it to bid out your pattern (even if you know partner doesn'ts have four hearts)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: b/c you know the opps have at least nine spades|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|casenjo:  yes, that was when system went down|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: he has a great hand...should be |pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: i suppose this is a shortened auction|pg||
nt|daman: right    good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Then 1NT would have been better, it would appear|pg||
nt|psyck: surely non forcing for them, but passing E's hand over a non forcing bid is not for me, i would bid something|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: contract is right and declarer too|pg||
nt|joest: maybe some question about whether 3@c is forcing.  Reversing after a 1NT response not necessarily the same as after one of a suit|pg||
nt|daman: but it will be unsuccessful|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: they have 2 boards remaining in the Open Room|pg||
nt|chthonic: Agree, but that leaves bidding 2D on xxx - not appealing, either.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: I play non forcing NT & bid with either shape or non minimum hands|pg||
nt|ady: not the best game|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: but duboin had no reason to bid 4@s here|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h would have been a great result|pg||
nt|daman: down 2 if E switches to a @D|pg||
nt|joest: making on a dummy reversal|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bigtrain: @CQ is rusinow|pg||
nt|gambit: hands fit well, and things on-side and best lead for the def, S will hook the spade successfully knowing the W hand|pg||

pc|sA|pg||

nt|joest: Depending on what you are playing 3@c directly by Zia might have been 'invitational or better' in diamonds|pg||
nt|chthonic: As a very able kibitzer pointed out, it takes a diamond lead to beat 4H.  Well, how do you get a diamond lead?  By bidding diamonds....|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|Vugraphzfc: i am not sure how to change the scores but will find out|pg||

nt|ritong: what is the score, for info?|pg||
nt|ritong: ok ty|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the opening lead is everything here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @S jack or 10 beats 3NT|pg||
nt|jchiu: may pop king on a low spade, as Lauria did (but Helness did not)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: anything else and the contract scores if declarer works out the @S position|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Zia led a spade in the other room|pg||
nt|bigtrain: since 57 went -1 the actual score is nickell 103 cayne 101|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 140 is 4 imps|pg||
nt|ritong: 90+50 that is|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Good question: Kibbitzer wants to know what is difference between open and closed room when we can see either room|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  At the tournament site, open room has kibbitzers, closed room does not|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or at least that was the way it was in the old days|pg||
nt|ritong: what s going on, nikita?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: closed room allows kibs at the beginning but no one enters after the play begins|pg||

nt|gambit: 8+ Forcing, all us former precision players know that |pg||

nt|bigtrain: it's not imo...  if the J were in any other suit i'd agree though|pg||

mb|5C|nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|ady: did take the sacrifice|pg||
nt|chthonic: Get Lizzie Borden, quick|pg||
mb|d|nt|casenjo:  Let's focus on this hand people|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 3 controls (A = 2 K = 1)|pg||
nt|ritong: heavy @d guess|pg||
nt|casenjo:  another partial battle|pg||
nt|joest: Having a double argues in favor of it.  Having an unmentioned KQ109xx suit argues against it|pg||
nt|joest: having a doubleton heart I mean|pg||
nt|chorush: Many pairs have the agreement that an immediate 4S by South shows the worst hand, which he certainly has, so we may be waiting while zimmerman decides about 5 clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gambit: ty big train for system notes, that really helps us all |pg||
nt|sybarra: Walter how does he show the club void?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  bigtrain will walk you through theauction|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Getting to 7 would be a swing for Nickells|pg||
nt|bigtrain: probably not until the keycard level|pg||
nt|gambit: will Versace venture in with 4@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: here is the vugraph schedule for future session    please bookmark it    http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|ady: great pickup for Nickell|pg||
nt|daman: this could tie the match|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bigtrain: if meck had a fit it would be shown as a part of a relay response|pg||
nt|ritong: bingo|pg||
nt|psyck: match will remain close at the end of 1st set, like it was at the end of 1st, not good for Nickell who prefer to trail at the half :)|pg||
nt|ady: all square now|pg||
nt|psyck: *2nd set|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, need to be behind 30 or more|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bigtrain: XX is penalty|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bigtrain: hoping for a couple of clubs with partner :)|pg||
nt|joest: my personal take is that Ralph took a pretty deep position|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|chorush: Seems certain to. 9 tricks for EW seems predestined|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|sybarra: bet that is a splinter|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C is exclusion RKC|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gambit: look at Rodwell's hand, and his partner has opened a forcing club, and shown a balnced NT, he is salivating|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok exc |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D = 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: exc or voidwood |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, they need that for inspired finish|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|bigtrain: 5@H = queen ask|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bigtrain: 5N Q with no kings|pg||
nt|gambit: behind in the match....the grand has to be on the table|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I would think Rodwell will bid this one........but what do I know?|pg||
nt|joest: anyway Zimmerman looks like they will pick up about 10 imps or so|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|daman: yes and yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: time clock has withered away with break and recent very slow play|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s9|pc|cT|nt|sybarra: taaaaaaaaadaaaaaa |pg||
nt|bigtrain: he knows 14 of the points...  and is unsure how many are in clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gambit: as predicted, wd Eric|pg||
nt|casenjo:  For those of you who told me the fatlady was singing, It ain't over til it's over ;)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s6|pc|c3|pc|d8|pg||

nt|daman: hoping for a huge error|pg||
nt|chorush: Maybe he is trying to put NS to sleep|pg||
nt|daman: Sominex Coup|pg||
nt|pfbr: hehehe :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h5|nt|daman: we have 5000 kibitzers     putting them to sleep as well|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: When West considers his switch (on the previous hand), he must bear in mind that he needs 4 tricks to beat the contract. So, @DK is more attractive than it may seem at first.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S = 99% 4-card raise|pg||
nt|brolucius: (In the case where South is declarer)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|barnets: epecially if his partner follows with suit pref |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  which is why West bids 4@s rather than offering 3NT as an alternative|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||

nt|chorush: This board looks very flat|pg||
nt|psyck: kibz can sleep through this one as ewell|pg||
mb|1N!|an|10-13|nt|daman: bid some @Ds'|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  down to an 18 imp difference in 2 boards! 19 to go|pg||
nt|daman: you?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|joest: well I guess how many was the question :)|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d most days|pg||
nt|ady: this should be flat   and hopefully quicker|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 1@D seems right|pg||
nt|joest: it certainly seems normal, which has a lot going for it!|pg||
nt|daman: now we''l see what happens|pg||
nt|joest: I doubt Mr. Hamman expects a lot of cooperation from Zia|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gambit: neg...|pg||
nt|joest: I could see him driving this to slam by himself frankly|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: yes...  a best he could do negative X :)|pg||
nt|joest: it's a big bid but not out of the realm|pg||
nt|daman: 6 is down on @D and another @D    yes?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|daman: 6@H looks to be gin|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  2@H = 5+ hearts and 4+ minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: pity the penalty double has been lost here, see last night Zia's last board if you don't believe me|pg||
nt|daman: in 6@H    low @D to King and a @S ruff|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, should be uneventful push board 420|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: let's see if they even get there|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|daman: just a lazy Sunday afternoon     4400 kibitzers     |pg||
nt|daman: and they all have an opinion|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: looks like scrambling 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|joest: i think it's cold George as long as he takes a first round spade hook|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: he was always finessing the @S|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|joest: takes the tap crosses to the heart queen picks up the trumps returns to his hand with a heart ruff, etc.|pg||

nt|casenjo:  Dave Dressman correctly pointed out that Rodwell knowsSOuth is marked with length in spades on the auction|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|joest: now this hand is in Zia's wheelhouse. He lives for these|pg||

nt|brolucius: 10-13, or a good 9.|pg||
mb|2S|an|relay|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  2@h = 10-13 5+@h unbalanced|pg||
nt|kit: This will keep E-W out of the good but doomed 4@S contract perhaps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as you will have gathered, all Fantunes 2 bids are similar|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North is forced to guess and 'takes the high road'.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lead could be critical|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @d gives 9th trick|pg||
nt|kit: 9th?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Meck asking quesitons of Fantoni about the auction and "what would he do if...." kinds of questions|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@c 2@h 2@d if East leads a @d|pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: it does|pg||
nt|kit: oh right -- defense can't run spades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West would need 2 entries to run spades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might lead @sA to take a look?|pg||
nt|brolucius: East would have to be a superman to avoid a diamond lead...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|barnets: unlucky for e/w|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: @DT shows the jack or AQT9|pg||
nt|brolucius: A small piece of evidence, then, that he is human.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: Declarer will win and just lead back a diamond, hoping spades can't run|pg||
nt|chorush: declarer will likely win this and play one back, hoping th spade 10 is right|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|barnets: very lucky contract|pg||
nt|barnets: needs @S 10 right of course or blockage|pg||
nt|kit: Should Meckstroth have doubled rather than bidding 3@D in order to bring spades into the picture?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Maybe a double of the artificial 2@S relay would show spades.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yorkbeach:  alternative is to play east for the @hQJ but better to play for 1 card right (the @s10) than 2|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Both hearts onside is not very good odds when East has so many more diamonds than West.|pg||
nt|kit: and spades might (likely are) 6-3, so big favorite|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes so ods are far better than 2:1 in favor of the @d play|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, fortune favors the brave (and Italians).|pg||
nt|brolucius: ... particularly brave Italians.|pg||
nt|barnets: anyone know when is the restart ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the next hand will be the last of this segment: we are back with the final 32 boards in one hour and 25 minutes, at the top of the hour|pg||
nt|chorush: 6:00 Eastern time is listed in the schedule|pg||
nt|barnets: quick answer you read my mind|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there will be some boards to watch in the CR after we finish here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Joe, our excellent VuGraph operator. Splendid job. We appreciate it!|pg||
nt|barnets: will they be finished play in the closed room ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes, my error, make that 2 hours and 25 minutes (6:00 PM local time)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good question 6 baords to go suggests 45 minutes+|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth doesn't know the club position, so he doesn't have a clear play here -- he also doesn't know where 9 of spades is.|pg||
nt|barnets: rates to be a close match|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so long as you do not mind watching the same baords again :)|pg||
nt|barnets: cashing the @SA could give dec his ninth trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer doesn't claim, because he might make an overtrick (on a heart/spade position) if the spade ace is not cashed.|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like he would play Rodwell for 9 of spades, but he may have read that declarer has it on swift cover of the 10.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Or clubs could be 4-0, someone points out. How true.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||

nt|joest: I just have to say that imho Zia was brilliant on that last hand|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|casenjo:  now Meckstroth has found the club fit!|pg||

nt|chthonic: Regardless, 3NT making NS inthe other room will lead to a significant gain for Monaco|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|sT|pc|d4|pg||

nt|barnets: best lead for defence|pg||
