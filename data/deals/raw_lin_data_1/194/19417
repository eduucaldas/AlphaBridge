nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: there is a problem because the Screen has no flap... :/|pg||
nt|kit: we get to start off with a nice dull grand slam which won't be so easy to bid I don't think.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: perfect fit|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: hi William|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: we're not ready to start quite yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: no boards|pg||
nt|othered1: Good evening, everybody, from drizzily central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|joest: hello all|pg||
nt|joest: + ed! :)|pg||
nt|joest: this is the second straight day that BBO has done a grea job guessing what match would be closest|pg||
nt|barnets: Hi all|pg||
nt|joest: hi barnet|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Barnet!|pg||
nt|joest: so here are in Toronto with an Israeli pair squaring off against an Italian one|pg||
nt|joest: here we are|pg||
nt|othered1: Same players as were in Open Room for the second quarter|pg||
nt|othered1: NS are likely to get to 2 or 3@S, after a 1N opening.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Sementa carefully considering his hand|pg||
nt|joest: wonder why|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: (just kidding, for those of you who just joined we're stuck without boards)|pg||
nt|othered1: Convention card for NS:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/israel/ronpa-gino.pdf|pg||
nt|othered1: And for EW:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|othered1: Hope they still reflect the actual methods used today|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: the margin should be 3|pg||
nt|barnets: Hi all|pg||
nt|warrens:  Hi Barnet|pg||
nt|barnets: Hi warren well done in the GNT|pg||
nt|warrens:  thanks :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play a Big Club with weak NT [(11)12-14] throughout|pg||
nt|ady: n/s close to a game    but 3NT fails on a club lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S play, I think, la longue d'abord, that is to say French Standard|pg||
nt|ady: sorry heart lead|pg||
nt|oleberg: Hi all, I'll mainly stick to desriping the EW system|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|joest: this is quite the fitting hand for a grand slam|pg||
nt|joest: this hand is a case study in not jumping to 3@s after a transfer just because you have four|pg||
nt|henryb:  and E-W are cold for 4@h |pg||
nt|ady: meantime e/w have 4@H|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: old CCs available only for both   NS from 2008 World Champs [Beijing]   EW from 2010 European Champs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: key question is whether Robinson will bid 3@S or think his hand is stronger|pg||
nt|joest: it's on the borderline|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we are starting this set about half an hour late|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks likely|pg||
nt|ady: hi William|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4S|nt|timb: the 1=5 @C break would point the right way to play the @Ds|pg||
nt|joest: with spades 32 you don't need to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H shows a balanced 4@S call|pg||
nt|timb: true, i'm a bit slow this laye at nihjt|pg||
nt|joest: just curious: 4@s is some 'playing strength' call?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like 3@d = weak and natural|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Julian, David and Bill|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@d could be a good save|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All British team of commentators|pg||
nt|athene: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Hi Bill|pg||
nt|joest: admittedly even for 'law followers' there would be what they call 'negative adjustments' here|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: it happens to everybody Tim.  Just keep putting out those great books of yours and we'll all be happy|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S would be a distributrional thing of some kind|pg||
nt|timb: I was thinking 7NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: good day all|pg||
nt|barnets: So Dan says the score is only 3|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: This is an unusual use for a double jump reverse.  The most frequent use is short hearts of some kind.|pg||
nt|athene: south, with nothing in diamonds, doesn't mind massively if his partner wants to bid on here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do not think South's pass is forcing here|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
pc|c8|nt|joest: 0 or 3|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd can see the keycards, but not the fillers|pg||
nt|athene: but that was rarely going to happen|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  faling to X will not be costly as looks like only 1 down|pg||
nt|othered1: good for NS that they don't superaccept a transfer with a minimum|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: this would be a harder choice if dummy had @CKxx|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-16  for 1st quarter scores (except one)|pg||
nt|athene: because giving declarer an extra club trick for a heart pitch from his hand might be fatal|pg||
nt|athene: but here, playing the ace is not likely to cost because  a pitch from dummy on @CQxx is going to be useless|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South should be thinking what can declarer usefully throw from dummy on the @cQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as declarer cannot have @sKxx on the bidding, there wil be no useful discard|pg||
nt|athene: south just wondering if declarer might possibly have the bare @CQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps I should have phrased that differently after the previous set|pg||
nt|athene: i don'tt hink north can really have seven clubs but i suppose it's conceivable|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Kranyak-Schwartz do plenty of thinking without any encouragement :(|pg||
nt|joest: it would help Ginossar greatly to be able to see the opponent's cards to make this one|pg||
nt|joest: down 2 would not surprise me|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: Robinson has the fillers, but he isn't in charge|pg||
nt|joest: now does 6@d ask for third round control?|pg||
nt|athene: certainly the jump to 4@S as a passed hand tends to be a two-suiter|pg||
nt|warrens:  Pachtmann-Ginossar play transfers over 1@C, so 1@S here denies a 4-card major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but different boards for the 2 matches|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: but not 5-7 :)|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  down 2    north did the right thing and cheap undoubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helgemo-Helness remembered to DBL|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: no 3rd round control stuff I don't think|pg||
nt|kit: Now Boyd might bid 6NT, which has to suggest the grand|pg||
nt|joest: that is dynamite I agree.  Even good pairs revert to cue bidding or other stuff|pg||
nt|joest: i think Sementa may play count signals here which will definitely not clear up the club jack story if i'm right|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: well, if they continue he has an elimination|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: overtricks how many|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: ok, we're going to restart hold on a sec|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: so laydown grand missed here -- and missed in other room also|pg||
nt|swanson: 6@S is no kings.  In the old days 6@C would show none and South could make a further try if he tought it was appropriate.|pg||
nt|timb: If there was a conventional agreement that 6@D over 5@C promise both minor suit kings...|pg||
nt|kit: 6@D would be offer to play I think|pg||
nt|timb: True but "if"|pg||
nt|joest: understood. Critical point for all partnerships.   In some I play it is an offer to play over a queen denial but not otherwise|pg||
nt|kit: Would have been better if North had been the RKC bidder.  He has the key queens, so he knows which kings are working.|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|swanson: If your opponents bid a making grand against you with 33HCP, a 4-4 fit, and no singletons, you aren't having a good session.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South should have no problem cashing tw9o aces when in |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson's shape was known to be 4-4-3-2, not 5-4-2-2 by the way|pg||
nt|timb: In my partnerships, given he had bid 4NT, partner would have denied 4+ diamonds |pg||
nt|athene: you can play hearts here and hope they cash out wrong|pg||
nt|athene: i guess|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer has to have 1 spade or you are not beating it|pg||
nt|chorush: Hello everyone.welcome to the 2nd quarter of this match|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bagman: Not much in the play here; the defense can take one more ace|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: most rooting for the underdog|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Both E and W wrote several things about 1@s, but I can't read either note - I think it's most often a weak NT with 3 spades, but maybe doesn't promise 3|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree, Barnett, this week|pg||
pc|c3|nt|barnets: funny how a week changes everything warren|pg||

nt|kit: I believe that Boyd should have gambled it -- try constructing hands Robinson can have which justify the 4@H call, and I don't think the grand will ever be worse than a finesse.|pg||
nt|joest: i was just thinking that|pg||
nt|athene: not any more :)|pg||
nt|athene: another club to force dummy there would not work|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could set up hearts and then run them through south and neutralize his trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS missed their spade game in the OR|pg||
nt|athene: so south had to cash the sapde|pg||
nt|athene: the spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: he was deciding whether or not to be annoyed by partner's failure to overtake and lead back a diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: every overtrick is important|pg||
nt|barnets: at this stage|pg||
nt|chorush: Hello Pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi Ira|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: some system discussions here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we'll see lots of alerts this set|pg||
nt|chorush: Looks like a red suit part score battle with neither team being able to make more than about 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play a Big 1@C with weak 1N throughout |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|bagman: Askaard probably opens with 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1-suit openings are all one round force, 2-suit are 10-13, natural unbalanced  |pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|chorush: Nunes Fantoni play a system of their own design where all opening bids at the one level in suits are forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the NS 1N is also weak throughout  and can include more distributions than most NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/denmark/bjarnarson-askgaard.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other rooms are visible without login via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but each match is playing a different set of boards|pg||
nt|hedyg: for security reasons|pg||
nt|oleberg: The action is picking up speed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st Quarter scores at  http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-16/978-2011-spingold-quarter-final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no realtime updates available|pg||
nt|oleberg: Could we be disconnected again? Operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I can disconnect if you like, but....|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL pls dont|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last set we proved  network connections account for most hesitations|pg||
nt|oleberg: Ok. Thx. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: we're having some actual trouble at the table over conventions and defenses to conventions|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: but that was hardly a taxing defence to find|pg||
nt|joest: interesting decision here.  1@s has no lead directing value whatsover but it's always important to stake claim to the boss suit if you can|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I wonder if the Italians would have acted on south's hand.  My guess is they would|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: If the grand is no worse than a finesse and there is a reasonable chance it is laydown, the odds on bidding it at IMPs are good.|pg||
nt|joest: although AJxx/AQ/Axxx/QJx wouldn't be so hot. That's why 6@d as a 3rd round ask would be great|pg||
nt|hedyg: does this mean the players did not have to hand in their CCs in advance?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: E/W play a lot of constructive transfers after 1-level natural openings|pg||
nt|hedyg: that would allow for time to discuss defenses etc|pg||
nt|bagman: North has a real marginal hand for other action than pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for both pairs  1N = (11)12-14   but not many 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I don't believe anyone has to do a formal submission for the spingold|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Dan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: players don't even have to submit CC for USBF Team Trials ... let alone events open to the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but some conventions do need pre-approval|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: well you could change the club qj into the heart king, same shape, no play|pg||
nt|kit: that hand wouldn't be a 4@H bid IMO|pg||
nt|kit: but you know he doesn't have the king of hearts!|pg||
nt|wygbe1: very true|pg||
nt|joest: Are Boyd and Robinson playing transfer responses?|pg||
nt|ady: seems 11 tricks were made in spades on hand 1|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: 1@H shows spades, as seems clear|pg||
nt|barnets: I am with south|pg||
nt|joest: this is an auto balance here|pg||
nt|othered1: balance with what?|pg||
nt|joest: how about 2@d?|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT is virtually a club raise.|pg||
nt|joest: i cannot see defending 1NT with this cards although I can see I have the worst possible buy if I act|pg||
nt|othered1: after 1@C-1N, opponents often have @D length between them|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@D should be 2 suits|pg||
nt|barnets: as |pg||
nt|joest: i agree barnet|pg||
nt|barnets: as he did not bid 1@D|pg||
nt|joest: plus west may take the push to 3@c|pg||
nt|tez: hi|pg||
nt|barnets: If they played that the bid would jump out|pg||
nt|joest: as clear as the 'two suit inference' might be to us, Barnet, it may not be so clear in real life|pg||
nt|barnets: so I doubt they do|pg||
nt|othered1: an ok method after extensive discussion, but I wouldn't expect partner to take that inference as I could have laid back with @C length|pg||
nt|joest: highly unlikely when responder bids 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: well, don't they tend to open 1@C, even with a doubleton, on balanced minimums?|pg||
nt|joest: yes but with diamonds and clubs you'd just bid 1@d and be done with it|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: there is definitely an online system summary required for the team trials and these transfers would be included|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: double here will be support|pg||
nt|joest: support X|pg||
nt|kit: so they will get to 4@S -- Robinson will probably invite|pg||
nt|joest: well over a 3@h raise the 3@s bid loses a little of its invitational flavor but south would carry on nonetheless|pg||
nt|wygbe1: you could stick the club q into the h suit, same shape = is that worth a 4h bid? |pg||
nt|swanson: This is a type of hand where support doubles really come to th fore.  If North returns to 2@S, South can bid 3@C to show extra values with a long club suit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know who is who?|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry all we are having some technical problems|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D reopening?|pg||
nt|athene: no-one really knows what 2@D, 3@D and 2@S show here by west|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yorkbeach:  4@h, 5@d and 3NT all seem to have play|pg||
nt|joest: at the other table Versace just overcalled 1@s and got everything outof his system|pg||
nt|othered1: But that's not their methods -- card says they open 1@C with minor 4-4, I think|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: Any kind of transfer type bid (rather than making a bid which might be passed) works better with a further message to say|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1this is wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: E/w have to stop in 5@C here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|swanson: North would like to tranfer once again.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: do ns play 14-16 nt openers? or 15-17?|pg||
nt|kit: Now not clear if 3@S is invite or not -- But Boyd will go anyway|pg||
nt|kit: 15-17|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d will induce Berk to save|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: i think its 15-17 not sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt by north?|pg||
nt|athene: i think 2@D is a bit wet|pg||
nt|barnets: not a terrible decsiion in spades e/w have 5 trump tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yorkbeach:  with Bill here - 2@h hardly suggests a 3-loser hand |pg||
nt|athene: cayne doesn't ever seem to want to jump when he has a monster|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@d rather|pg||
nt|athene: it cost him a vul game last set|pg||
nt|athene: when he rebid only 2@C rather than 3@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only nonvul this time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside down count & attitude, reverse smith vs NT  |pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: However, e-W look like they will be saving|pg||
nt|warrens:  they have to get there first|pg||
nt|barnets: yes they will|pg||
nt|warrens:  but probably Versace will just drive it there|pg||
nt|barnets: wild horses wont stop versace|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d was an excellent call|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|barnets: and in the open in 2@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: Good decision by Boyd|pg||
nt|joest: was 4@s really alerted?|pg||
nt|kit: Cohler will probably go back to hearts now|pg||
nt|joest: i'm surprised he didn't the first time|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|barnets: hes still tring|pg||
nt|barnets: trying for slam|pg||
nt|barnets: lauria has decent hand now - he thinks|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|kit: Meckwell took push to 5@S in other room, so we should have new leader it looks like|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would East have bid 3NT over 3@d or raised the diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt |pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: i would imagine|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|barnets: versace did bid his 7 high suit as overcall|pg||

nt|othered1: as expected|pg||
nt|othered1: auction and result|pg||
nt|barnets: good stop|pg||
pc|s4|nt|swanson: This is a dangerous save - it will do well only because hearts are 2-2.|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- I think Cohler should have played in hearts|pg||
pc|s7|nt|joest: yes it is.   diving in a 4-4 is not a growth industry|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = bad 2@H/@S opener   2@H/@S = good weak 2s|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yorkbeach:  yes nearly all values are in the blacks|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D got home in OR   needs ace and anothr diamond start to defend|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps Cayne was giving Schwartz the chance to bid 2@s, suspecting that East could double 2@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  taking the risk of a missed non-vul game for the chance of a useful penalty|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  was quite disciplined of Schwartz to pass over 2@d - many players would just take one look at the sixth spade and bid 2@s|pg||
nt|athene: well this auction suggests strongly that east has a spade stack|pg||
nt|athene: west usually has a spade void to reopen with 2@D rather than double|pg||
nt|athene: so i think pass was judicious|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  either that or very short in @c, though as West could convert @c to @d, West could could afford to X 1@s even without @c support|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: on board 33, Versace did great to get out for down one in 3@s to push the board.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: apparently heart shift not found vs. 5@S at other table -- a disaster.|pg||
nt|oleberg: Very popular treatment in Denmark|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 2@D opener can be 5 or 6 card major|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|wygbe1: if s puts n in with spade for another club play, e will need to discard to prevent losing the heart suit|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|hT|nt|swanson: Maybe 4@D should be used to show at least 5 diamonds; East could bid 3NT to show his actual shape.|pg||
nt|joest: now a club|pg||
nt|timb: if trumps were 4-1 we might need an abacus to calculate the damage|pg||
nt|joest: i am not sure why Duboin is not driving the club out with the spade as an entry|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N West in other room  will that matter?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d8|pc|cQ|nt|chorush: will likely get club lead which will be less damaging|pg||
nt|pelu: y no @hlead - entry to @d!|pg||
nt|hedyg: or @s|pg||
nt|bagman: N has indicated that he wants a spade thru|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: when i'm getting tapped I like the safety of a six card suit :)|pg||
nt|kit: Now down only 1|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|wygbe1: even if e discards, another club would have allowed n to ruff |pg||
pc|cK|nt|timb: playing in the 6-3 fit would have been far, far safer|pg||
nt|joest: 5@s made?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're "good"  is  7-9    others who upgrade 2M opening to something like 8-11|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You have to guess diamonds, though|pg||
pc|s5|nt|thorvald: Playing Lebensohl i would only bid 3@h on the west hand|pg||
nt|barnets: after opening bid hough by south|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But when North shows up with @CK it is so much easier|pg||
nt|barnets: in open South opened 1N|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|barnets: but e/w still got to 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Schaltz will likely shift to a club now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||

nt|Walddk2: OK, so much for that|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|thorvald: With AKJxx, QX, ??, JTxx wouldnt he open 1@s anyway ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same ciontract in the closed room|pg||
nt|barnets: Nunes did switch at trick 2 to a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Nunes did shift to a club at trick 2, queen, king, ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room Nunes opened a 12-14 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So unless he upgraded he has both red queens|pg||
nt|barnets: the fact south did not fnd the club switch perhaps makes the hand more difficult to read|pg||
nt|barnets: as the position of th @CK is unknown|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, he only needs to get one suit right now|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's possible he thinks S has the @C K and N has both red queens.  it's possible to go down if he thinks that|pg||
nt|barnets: a spec suggests leading the @CQ now|pg||
nt|barnets: from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With the singleton ace in dummy? :)|pg||
nt|barnets: to find out about the K|pg||
nt|warrens:  except East is dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: the club Q is in declarer's hand though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think that spec thinks East is declarer|pg||
nt|barnets: shows he was thinking anyway |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Will he play for @D10x in South now?|pg||
nt|barnets: same thing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is a chance he will|pg||
nt|thorvald: he is locked at table now a will make it|pg||

nt|timb: how!!!!|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes that one could have gotten a little ugly|pg||
nt|ady: cannot see the point of last play   wjy not come to hand with A@C draw trump  and either hearts break or not|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerability may silence EW here, at least if South opens|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H - 1@S; 2@S and you might get to 6@S i suppose|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in these days of RKCB, it is rare to bid a slam missing an ace and the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though on your sequence North may think the fit is 6-4 and not worry about the @sQ|pg||
nt|athene: he can ask over 2@S and find out how many spades his partner has|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: the match tightens!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N here?|pg||
nt|bagman: Nunes has 1NT opening?|pg||
nt|bagman: Fantunes normally open any 54|pg||
nt|bagman: 22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: except 54 @H & @S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: oh I thought maybe somebody underled diamonds to score a ruff|pg||
nt|kit: I think|pg||
nt|joest: we will see Berk's hand in the Master Solvers Club in about 18 months|pg||
nt|joest: impossible decision|pg||
nt|kit: yes, that's what happened|pg||
nt|ady: very nice lay for 12 tricks   in spades   but likely to play in game|pg||
nt|athene: well, he might not be able to as this is a new partnership|pg||
nt|joest: another part score hand|pg||
nt|barnets: Versace playing this board in 2@H from south|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: joest :) :)|pg||
nt|kit: Berkowitz has tough hand over the preempt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  how does the ask work?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: ok and kit what does 3@h mean?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know this one, sorry|pg||
nt|joest: they are bidding their four card majors up the lne|pg||
nt|joest: line|pg||
nt|timb: looking for a @D stopper?|pg||
nt|joest: maybe catching a heart raiase|pg||
nt|kit: It may be conventional looking for 4-card major -- I think it is something new in their methods|pg||
nt|athene: no 2@C from north?|pg||
nt|ady: 4 of either major  sees ok for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 2 i am told by the operator that 3nt was -2|pg||
nt|athene: do we have names for the players operator?|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is EW are lauria versace|pg||
nt|athene: but could be sementa duboin?|pg||
nt|ady: 4@Smade 11 tricks in open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, could you please put player names up?|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh i do trust you but canadians!?|pg||
nt|ady: auction in open room west 1@H   2@C   dbl    south 2NT    west 4@C   east 4@H   west 4@S   all pass   |pg||
nt|athene: a 2@C overcall might silence east; double isn't really ideal with only three hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but even a good raise from south isn't going to shut out west|pg||
nt|ady: not an every day auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: west is in 4@H here|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S 2@C P 2@S [@C raise] 3@H and now east is bidding 4@H or 4@S (or maybe 4@C choice of games, if he is given the room)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Schwartz-Kranyak  are N-S  against  Lauria-Versace|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so what is the likelihood EW can be talked out of game?  arrange these words into a common phrase: snowball's, hell, not, chance, in, a|pg||
nt|joest: i don't like his chances|pg||
nt|barnets: and 5@C in open too|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: most use 2NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|kit: this I know is conventional, looking for major-suit holdings|pg||
nt|joest: I have played 3@d a couple of ways here|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H shows 3 or 4 hearts I think|pg||
nt|swanson: Any bid other than pass my North looks like an effort to turn a plus into a minus.|pg||
nt|joest: looking for a three card major is one treament|pg||
nt|barnets: He has already gone a few down in first 2 and is heading fo|pg||
nt|bagman: with both red queens coming down, EW can make 4@H here|pg||
nt|bagman: even 5|pg||
nt|chorush: Hard for EW to figure out that 4H is a lucky make for them|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit: E-W have no idea it is their hand|pg||
nt|joest: Well if Cohler is thinking ...|pg||
nt|barnets: for more here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: chances of getting to a slam with an immediate spade raise|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D now probably showing 3-5-4-1|pg||
nt|joest: at the other table north tried to find a 4-4 major suit fit (unsuccessfully). Same result east-west here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: we'll go back and do 2 afterwards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS have changed system since 2008 Bejing      DBL used to say NO Major|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: when you open these hands with 3@c, 3NT by partner was not what you had in mind|pg||
nt|othered1: That's no everyone's 1N overcall.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  wrong auction|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yorkbeach:  loses the option to use 2NT as a natural game but can gain on big hands|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  natural game try|pg||
nt|athene: singleton club opposite is fairly good news for north|pg||
nt|joest: in most |pg||
nt|joest: "garbage stayman' sequence I'm familiar with|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT is not possible|pg||
nt|joest: either pass 2@h or correct to 2@s|pg||
nt|joest: but this east west knows what they are doing for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: not garbage stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: 2@H was a range ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Boyd runs before anything happens|pg||
nt|timb: 3nt over 3@C would probably have got a @S lead...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: not so hard :p|pg||
nt|bagman: well judged|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but only three trumps in dummy is VERY bad news especially if you are going to try to establish hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so 4@S sensible|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but will be hard work to ruff 3@c|pg||
nt|barnets: and 2N a min|pg||
nt|joest: thx|pg||
nt|joest: in a vacuum he might like to duck but he doesn't want a club switch|pg||
nt|barnets: strangely a club lead would have been best|pg||
nt|bagman: the opening helps a bit in the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finding @CK in North will place @DQ in South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless there is some way to try to endplay South if he holds @CK|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a club switch and declarer needs both red queens to come down|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yorkbeach:  seems that North planned to go for a slam only if South showed 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: can set up hearts    favourable lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CCs   NS http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/France/multon-zimmerman.pdf|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|barnets: if he wins he can power 3 spade trikcks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: yes, 4@C over 2NT might have been a splinter with four spades, say 4-5-3-1|pg||
nt|athene: and that would get north a bit more excited|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East has heard about the singleton club in dummy and leads a trump to cut down on ruffs, hoping West has the hearts covered|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead will hold it to 12 :)|pg||
nt|athene: as good as anything else|pg||
nt|joest: pinning the 8 yes|pg||
nt|barnets: if he ducks he has only 2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|joest: he also saves anothe entry to the diamonds |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with the hearts lying this well, all plays lead to 12|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there ANY way to score @D8?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: that clears that up|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: hmmmm, is declarer going for ruffs rather than the heart establishment?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect to see more and more takeout DBL of 1@C with balanced hands|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: nice result for E-W in other room, virtually tying the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Duboin showed the faintest sign of happiness when he played the @sT|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|barnets: Dec knows south has the @DQ now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nothing new  Italian Blue Team won tons of world championships doing that from late 1950s thru early 1970s|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if 1@C doesn't especially promise clubs, a double of 1@C shouldn't especially promise short clubs :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|barnets: and has 8 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: and why is that|pg||
nt|barnets: from the opening bid|pg||
nt|barnets: and norths pause|pg||
nt|joest: yes from the slow duck of the heart king|pg||
nt|barnets: with the @HK|pg||
nt|barnets: hard to fault n/s bidding I too am a responder|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: great match|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|joest: if he reads it right Ginossar will get squeezed into allowing an overtrick|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: that works as well|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 12 anyway with the @CK falling|pg||
nt|joest: these guys are already two boards behind|pg||
nt|othered1: are we still connected?|pg||
nt|joest: yes we are|pg||
nt|barnets: South will have to discard his heart on the @S7|pg||
nt|joest: at some point Pachtmann might lead his partner's bid suit :)|pg||
nt|barnets: and then dec can manage an overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H West in other room    will that be an ongoing theme?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yorkbeach:  now the @sQ has gone, ruffing clubs becomes more attractive|pg||
nt|bagman: E probably soon asks N if the opening can be 5=2=2=4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: these days people like to get into the auction early and show some values; you can use responsive doubles and scrambling bids to find fits thereafter, so being a bit offshape is ...|pg||
nt|athene: not such a big deal|pg||
nt|chorush: playing 1NT from the other side cost Bjarnason 5 imps since it made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it definitely mattered on  18 where North led @C|pg||

nt|athene: very well done by NS in the other room to reach slam after the opposing 1@C opener|pg||
nt|barnets: goodn push by the italians here|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@H a good spot here|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|joest: is this 3@h too big?|pg||
nt|joest: guess so|pg||
nt|swanson: A 3@C preempt with the South hand can cause serious problems for the opponents but creates havoc with consturctive bidding over your own preempts.  A partnership style.|pg||
nt|joest: Kit you would bid 3@h in your sleep, right?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  just what I was about to say|pg||
nt|bagman: If the @CK were S, the defense could not have attacked the clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky because Qx in @d|pg||
nt|bagman: The releays are soon gone|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: EW play fairly standard 5-card majors, strong notrump, short club - i am hunting for NS's convention card|pg||
nt|bagman: N takes care of that|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: Yes, I would|pg||
nt|joest: transfer then key cards?|pg||
nt|joest: then a mournful signoff in 5@s|pg||
nt|kit: seems normal -- basically what happened in other room, after 2@H opening and 2NT overcall|pg||
nt|sybarra: can Berk get back in iwth H!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: with @H?|pg||
nt|joest: not over 4@h he can't|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, after 3@H opening might have been more interesting|pg||
nt|roswolf: just need to rightside the slam|pg||
nt|ady: still only 11 sure tricks    |pg||
nt|ady: trumps 3-0  but hearts ok  for 6@S|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair though south does not need very much from his partner|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the @dA and good spades|pg||
nt|joest: a phantom sacrifice in the open room|pg||
nt|chorush: The play will not be so clearcut in the other room since south opened 1 spade.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Anyone know contract, declarer and number of tricks on board 2, so that I can give Bruce the code|pg||
nt|chorush: Good 4 hearts here that will wind up depending on guessing the diamond queen|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S is 500 but due t|pg||
nt|barnets: to luckly lie for dec|pg||
mb|5S|nt|athene: kranyak might be worried that schwartz has another very light overcall like the 1@H that got into trouble last set|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w taking a phantom|pg||
nt|joest: this auction does not appear that it will develop the momentum they did at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: is this a 3@h call?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that neither South bid 3@h as a fit-showing jump|pg||
nt|joest: or just 2@h?  The problem is you would bid 2 on way less in comp|pg||
nt|barnets: they started a level higher in open|pg||
nt|joest: now if sementa raises to 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: with north at this table it's hard to imagine we'll have any momentum at all|pg||
nt|joest: as i suspect he will|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I'm surprised -- I thought they made 4-level transfer and then RKC|pg||
nt|kit: Pass over the double shows doubleton spade I think|pg||
nt|athene: doubling 2@C is not very pre-emptive|pg||
nt|athene: how about 2nt or something|pg||
nt|athene: get the minors into it|pg||
nt|athene: partner might have five diamonds over there!|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a huge fan of 3@H fit showing because south is simply too strong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if the NS spade fit is only 5-3, West needs to be careful when vulnerable|pg||
nt|athene: you don't really need a fitting heart honour |pg||
nt|athene: and you don't need a club control|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no idea that South has so many spades|pg||
nt|athene: south should be just taking control|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: inly a club lead from south does not immediately give the 12th|pg||
nt|athene: i think Versace can happily bid 3@C there to show his long club suit without implying loads of hcp|pg||
nt|athene: because with any strong hand he would start with a double|pg||
nt|athene: first ask partner if he has total rubbish; when he says no, ask for keycards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: as it requires a speed|pg||
nt|barnets: so all have done well so far here|pg||
nt|hedyg: due to the strong @c system they missed the 4 4 @H fit|pg||
nt|oleberg: "Missed" is a strong word. 5@H is in more trouble than 5@S|pg||
nt|chorush: Some hands you don't want to get to 4-4 fit.|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 3 3 @cs and 4-1 @hs 5@s is the making contract, 5@H isnt|pg||
nt|chorush: I would go out on a big limb and say that had they gotten to 6 spades Bjarnson would have made it|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer probably needs to take a spade finesse to make this|pg||
nt|hedyg: well missed because the @H fit is where most would play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure i agree with either of the last 2 comments|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont think he needs the @s finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: can lose 1@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc 2@hs on @c|pg||
pc|dA|nt|joest: they are playing 5@s in the open|pg||
nt|ady: as kibs suggest almost certain to make|pg||
nt|athene: it might look as though declarer is sure to succeed, even on a club lead, in 6nt, because both red suit finesses work|pg||
nt|athene: a fit-showing jump tries to make partner captain of the auction and south is too strong to want to do that, i think|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably North could have bid 2@s over 2@c X to show total rubbish|pg||
nt|joest: now 3@h all pass?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = Bergen raise   4@S   you decide on strength :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: whoops|pg||
nt|athene: but there are ways to go down|pg||
nt|athene: you might play for a strip-and-throw-in on south, playing him for @HQ or @DK |pg||
nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|ady: best contract 6@C from east side   can ruff out the diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: i think Lauria intended that 4nt as blackwood|pg||
nt|roswolf: there could be an animated post-mortem on this one|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: well, again, that is something that an experienced pair will have discussed but this NS might not have|pg||
nt|athene: yes i think on fast arrive principles, 2@S would be north's weakest action|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he should simply have bid 6NT - not really possible for Versace to have no ace|pg||
nt|athene: but not everyone agrees|pg||
nt|joest: Duboin will be afraid of pushing them into a heart game|pg||
nt|barnets: that was quite amusing nikita|pg||
pc|d2|nt|swanson: I don't like a double here with the West cards.  You don't want to demand a heart lead, buying the contract is unlikely, and it gives help to the opponents in the auction and the ...|pg||
nt|swanson: play.|pg||
nt|ady: did not expect this swing|pg||
nt|athene: south is waiting patiently for a diamond control-bid|pg||
nt|joest: so we will have a new leader here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kit: I agree John, but one hates to never bid with that hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: world class players having a bidding misunderstanding in a very simple sequence - there is hope for us mere mortals still|pg||
nt|chorush: Paying 500 against a game that was 50-50 will not do well in the long run|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: ...and there we are|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is determined to reamain captain of this auction :)|pg||
nt|athene: now 4NT|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what he can't do  is use dummy entry for @S finesse |pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least i don't think he can|pg||
nt|hedyg: draw 2@s, K@C, A@C, @c ruff, Q@s and @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe double dummy    @C to Ace, spade finesse   @H to 8|pg||
nt|bagman: He can play a club to the A and take the spade finesse; then run @H9 |pg||
nt|bagman: cannot play @H7 to 8|pg||
nt|hedyg: dummy discs @hs on @ss, S has only @Hs left|pg||
nt|bagman: On this bidding at least one of his suits breaks badly|pg||
nt|bagman: He can pick up the hearts if spades are 3-2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: The 4@D call is a splinter, and when Robinson showed no interest Boyd gave up on slam -- reasonable|pg||
nt|kit: After all, could have been off 3 aces on a bad day.|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: what was wrong with good ol' blackwood?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is 5@s two way, either good controls and bad spades or good spades and bad controls?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard for North to go on with two heart losers|pg||
nt|athene: jumping to 5 of a major is most often a Partner Torture bid|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting in 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has 3 sure losers|pg||
nt|barnets: if he throws def in with a club|pg||
nt|barnets: they must give him a ruff and sluff|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|barnets: to stop him guessing the diamond suit|pg||
nt|bagman: When the spades are 4-1 declarer needs the hearts to run or clubs to break|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cannot combine the 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: slim chance that @SJ would fall on 1st round -- would give extra entry to dummy if @C 42|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which doesn't really help, does it|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that the percentage play is to finesse the spade now|pg||
nt|oleberg: Isnt there a problem in setting up clubs?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Ole|pg||
nt|hedyg: not if they are 3-3|pg||
nt|oleberg: On a diamond force, declarer cannot knock out the @SJ|pg||
nt|bagman: If diamonds are 7-3 he cannot afford the 4th spade|pg||
nt|oleberg: So the fifth clubs will never be played|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can, once @cs are set up S has only J@s and @hs left|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: it says "i want you to bid slam with exactly xxxxxx but not yyyyyyy" and partner has to fill in the blanks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  that is what everyone tells me when I do it :)|pg||
nt|athene: i like my partner to bid blackwood :) i have at least a 60% chance of getting the subsequent auction right|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: 2nt from west over 2@C might have worked better in that north would not have been able to show extras immediately, as we think the pass after double did|pg||
nt|athene: also east might have bid lots of diamonds, which would have been exciting|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will need to set up the hearts to make enough tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was still interested in a grand slam|pg||
nt|oleberg: South will ruff the fourth club|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: of course, every pair must have its own rules about when 4NT is (or is not) blackwood, so it's hard to know who is to blame|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in view of West's opening bid and void in spades, declarer will not want to finesse East for the @hQ|pg||
nt|ady: once the trumps are 3-0  declarer would have to get things right with a ruffing finesse had west had QXXX hearts   but all is well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  whether declarer plays a ruffing finesse or simply hopes the @hQ falls in 3 rounds, the slam is there|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have four obvious tricks against 7@D (@HAK, ruff, @DA)- is that all?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yorkbeach:  they are now 2 whole boards ahead in the OR|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: nice defense|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there any chance Fantoni started with 7@D instead of 8?|pg||
nt|chorush: Since EW play udca declarer can be reasonably sure diamonds are 8-2 based on the diamond 10 that was played|pg||
nt|smoller: 4@D vul on a 7-card suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i didn't think so either -- but really like Ira's answer to make me certain|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|barnets: so this is a case for giving a ruff and discard|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|s5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|barnets: quite unusual|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is playing my line down to drawing 2@ss first :)|pg||
nt|chorush: now he has to play 2 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this means 2 rounds of @S is safe since Fantoni known to be 1 1 8 3|pg||
nt|bagman: for hearts to run declarer needs N with a singleton quack or QJ bare; if N has singleton heart, he has 1183|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: he can't play a heart to dummy and good clubs, endplaying if necessary?|pg||
nt|smoller: almost an open book now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He does not have to play spades, Ira|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Multon did play 4@H   sorry about that bagman|pg||
nt|chorush: right, he can go to heart and play a clubl if ruffed, overruff and exit small heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: as the cards lie he can play a @H to the K and a @c, ruff, overruff, pull last @s and play 10@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute position Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but slightly DD isnt it?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d5|pc|h2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d7|pc|h3|nt|yorkbeach:  @c ruff too?|pg||
nt|athene: ah, yes|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so 1400|pg||
nt|athene: great board at BAM|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so a possible 1 IMP gain blown :)|pg||
nt|athene: bidding diamonds might talk NS out of slam though|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. 1@C 1@S P 2@C 2N P 5@D and it's murky|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it would appear that North is claiming|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even murkier than on the actual auction with South's 5@s bid :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: cute|pg||
mc|11|nt|bagman: well done|pg||
nt|oleberg: Much ado for a flat board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed   many more possibilities arose once we're convinced of North's distribution|pg||

nt|athene: true, if your opponents are capable of self-inflicted murk maybe you don't take risks to do it to them|pg||

mb|3C|an|minimum, no major|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, 6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: theorists would argue it's has too a low frequency to use for a 2-level bid|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H not constructive ( he has lots of other bids for that)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php, or http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  Watch multiple tables (without logging in) |pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: here west did well to pas 3@H s north would surely smack 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: pachtmann asking if east could have shown both majors directly over 1@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D at least invite|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have rarely seen a precision 2@c opening with such a bad suit|pg||
nt|bagman: W has the nightmare hand after 2@C; if he passes he misses a game and if he bids, he ends up in 3@C|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest: I've played it often and I think it's primary benefit is on hands where it is not used|pg||
nt|joest: you can respond 1NT a lot more often over 1@h and not have to worry about responding 1@s on Jxxx or something like that|pg||
nt|athene: the EW convention card does say they play modified turbo rather than blackwood when clubs are trump|pg||
nt|athene: certainly 4nt blackwood is not so much use in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: 2@c could be canape|pg||
nt|athene: obviously you make two more tricks in 1nt if you finesse diamonds, but that would be very rash with the hearts and spades wide open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing transfer responses to 1@C -- i wonder why Multon opens 1@D instead of 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: (after @SK lead)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: Looks like both 2@S and 3@D are makes here, so possible pickup for Robinson|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead declarer will run round to ace|pg||
nt|athene: so turbo uses 4NT to say "i have an even number of keycards"|pg||
nt|ady: then obviously play on diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what 4nt said - "i have slam interest in clubs and an even number of keycards" and versace was not at libterty to pass it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South takes advantage of being passed hand to make what some call a pre-balancing action |pg||
nt|athene: east has good news/bad news - max hcp but soft and 433|pg||
nt|athene: 4333|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 6@h, I would just bid 3@h as West|pg||
pc|s3|nt|timb: like many conventions ;)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you haven't been watching carefully :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol i have!|pg||
nt|bagman: that's my experience after 2@C openings|pg||
pc|d4|nt|joest: plus when you do bid 1@s and get raised it is almost 100% to be a 3 card raise|pg||
nt|ady: great lead|pg||
nt|ady: will have to try and set up clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  Because he has 4@d and 4@c|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will have to set up the clubs but still big trouble|pg||
nt|ady: at least 500|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Hedy's point is taken   Bjar felt ok to relay with 2@D because if not 4M, then Askgaard had 6+ decent @C  usually|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: minimum 9 tricks    likely more with west getting squeezed holding all the important cards|pg||
nt|athene: a guess in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: cashing the ace first would have resolved that|pg||
nt|ady: I would have tht ace first|pg||
nt|athene: Versace can count his partner for very few HCP|pg||
nt|athene: surprising decision from cayne to penalize them at the 3 level with a sixth heart|pg||
nt|barnets: the only way down is a heart finesse|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: EW spot card leads 2nd/4th vs suit & nt|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: with that dummy west knows this will make |pg||
nt|athene: but it sure has worked|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|swanson: My experience is that Flannery is an OK convention.  If I remember correctly William Flannery gave up using his own convention.|pg||
nt|barnets: otherwise he must make 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: nice d|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might not want to deal with a second heart from east, which is good news in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: club lead gives you more time; it's pretty safe to finesse the diamond|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: no way the defenders are winning the @DQ and running six heart tricks :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: usually...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: as he will play the ace to guard against that|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: now when the spade hook loses anothe diamond, a pitch by cohler and voila a second trump trick|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s7|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|joest: partner has values but no heart raise so declarer almost for sure 0=4=5=4|pg||
nt|chorush: Cayne gained 12 imps when 4H was set 1 on the hand NS went for 500|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dJ|nt|ady: looks like 800|pg||
nt|athene: so should be two imps to monaco|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: First quarter scores at  http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-16|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps my decision to bid 3@h is influenced by the fact that I am not used to playing a system where East would bid 2@h with the hand he has |pg||
pc|d7|pc|c7|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: might only make 9|pg||
nt|athene: duck a heart is safe now, and might be indicated by the play|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: actually sorry still not totally safe; versace might have all the hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Ginossar in the other room after the same start bid 3@h|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  by EW|pg||
nt|ady: should just make|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: interesting that Lauria passes 1@H; i would have thought 2@C was ok with that suit|pg||
nt|ady: seems normal to open on east hand     but not to get as high as 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: they don't play support doubles, as mentioned before, so that was not an option|pg||
nt|oleberg: 1@H = 20+|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes @h friendly, making up for @cK offside|pg||
nt|ady: useful part score swing for Schwartz|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Ole -- that wasn't on their CC|pg||
nt|athene: now 1@S would be 0-2; others 5-7 game forcing|pg||
nt|athene: 0-4|pg||
nt|pelu: where would u like to play?|pg||
nt|oleberg: 2@S shows clubs, several variations|pg||
nt|athene: east might wait with 2nt now|pg||
nt|oleberg: Single-suited a reliable sitce informs|pg||
nt|henryb:  tricky to find a safe contract|pg||
nt|oleberg: 2@S also shows 5-7 and is GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I have 19+ from a more reliable source|pg||
nt|athene: they will end in 3nt i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 4+@D, unbal in 1st/2nd, not always in 3rd/4th|pg||
mb|2D|nt|joest: 4@s is a bit pushy but 'I was vulnerable at IMPs' covers a lot of ground|pg||
nt|kit: hmm -- something may have gone wrong -- East hand surely not worth 4@S if 3@S preemptive, and West hand surely not worth limit raise|pg||
nt|joest: ok 4@s is a lot pushy |pg||
nt|kit: Still, on a better day 4@S might have made|pg||
nt|athene: worth a mention here that south bids 2@D as a cue rather than 2@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: here the matter should rest|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is more clearly a cue raise of hearts because south can't want to show diamonds naturally, after west bid them|pg||
nt|athene: given south passed over 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: but he might well have great clubs (e.g. 7 solid) and want to bid clubs naturally|pg||
nt|athene: so it's not clear 2@C should be a cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: looks like they play some version of what is called "XYZ" in the United Sttes|pg||
nt|oleberg: :)|pg||
nt|oleberg: 2NT = relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: surely west wont sit for 2@H?|pg||
nt|athene: south got a bit over-excited here, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: THAT IMO IS A GROSS OVERBID|pg||
nt|joest: States|pg||
nt|joest: 2@d = artificial game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Sontag-Weichsel were first pair to play this treatment of 1@C-1@D//1@H|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead gives you eight tricks; you only have one entry to dummy so the double diamond finesse is a bit difficult; maybe you just plot away at spades to set up the long card ...|pg||
nt|athene: there|pg||
nt|oleberg: 3@H = some 7-3-2-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: promotion|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  you can understand why East passed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bjarn PASS = 0-2@H  [else support dbl/raise]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hope nobody objects to me shortening west's name|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: 2@D says "i have a good hand with hearts", 2@H says "good for you, let's play 2@H"|pg||
nt|joest: so this shows a hand a little too big to bid 4@s directly|pg||
nt|barnets: coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: sorry, I actually didn't see who doubled|pg||
nt|barnets: second club|pg||
nt|chorush: will be beaten by heart 7|pg||
nt|barnets: promotes a trump trick|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: if he really wants, he can go 3@H saying "i have a REALLY good heart raise" but that's about all|pg||
pc|sT|nt|joest: next door meckwell have powered themselves to 4@h north-south and east-west are mulling over a save|pg||
nt|joest: all pass and 4@h looks to go down |pg||
nt|roswolf: CLEARLY SOUTH HASNT REMEMBERED HOW WEAK HIS PARDS OVERCALLS CAN BE:)|pg||
nt|joest: i'm wondering how they came to make just ten tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did 2@S say anything about 4@H/@S?|pg||
nt|athene: the advantage of this sort of auction is declarer's hand is completely unknown|pg||
nt|athene: which makes the opening lead and subsequent defence extremely difficult|pg||
nt|oleberg: 2@S denied 4-card majors|pg||
nt|athene: this is a big advantage over traditional methods where opener goes around bidding his suits and stuff like that|pg||
nt|athene: of course, the downside is, that if the hand which has taken great pains to describe itself ends up as declarer, the defence is pretty much double dummy|pg||
nt|oleberg: The system is "Viking-Club", a Norweigan system with one Bermuda Bowl in its belt.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: nothing like having the english and the danish to do commentary. opposite flags, naturalists vs. scientists...|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: well done multon|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might try a variety of technical and/or psychological plays from here|pg||
nt|athene: for example cash a couple of hearts ending in dummy and lead a diamond to the jack|pg||
nt|athene: say goodbye to the @CA temporarily, trusting that the defence will have to resurrect it eventually|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: looks like down 2    so 300 in each room for Cayne|pg||
nt|athene: yes it's hard to imagine a game if partner can't bid over 3@C|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzfg: Pachtmann: you have to win|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wygbe1: trump returns best|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do you agree with West's 3@s in the OR?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: and unless game is a possibility, you are risking a lot to gain little|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzfg: (in re 1st trick)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: @CK a possible card now|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer doesn't play on clubs you know he has no more than a singleton in hand at most|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  after East had reopened with 3@d?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thde website to scores is OK; it's just that the server is slow and can't take too many hits at a time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room same contract played by same seat    how did that happen|pg||
pc|h9|nt|swanson: Yes, but North will fear ducking any red suit card from dummy for fear of giving up the contract.|pg||
nt|athene: south has no top heart honour and not the @H10 or @H9, so he should take that as a warning - his partner might just be bidding on a very good suit but nothing else|pg||
nt|athene: if south had better hearts it would be a lot more reasonable to be aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: since if partner hasn't got a great suit he should have a decent hand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|ady: kib suggest down 1|pg||
nt|ady: maybe after no cover of J@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: seriously why south bid as he did is perplexing - surely you know the propensity of pards overcalls at this level|pg||
nt|athene: down only one is not possible|pg||
nt|athene: the defence will just play ace and a spade now|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: versace has the @HA and lauria has the @H5 for the third round of diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk4: www.confsudbridge.org   photos from Toronto, courtesy of Catarina Robles|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you can make 6@d, 1@H and 1@c, you just need one more trick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  for 3NT|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|athene: so declarer isn't getting two spades way|pg||
nt|ady: yes   then 2 down|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: away|pg||
nt|henryb:  contract is clearly 4@h, which is cold on a non-trump leadand on a @s finesse if they lead trump (and no astonishingly bad breaks)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: The defense is likely to make one club and one diamond in the end game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: in the other room i'm told they safety played the hearts, hence the +420|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: versace knows his partner has the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: what else can he have?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c6|nt|athene: you mean, the best contract is 4@H? if they were actually in 4@H south would lead another heart now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|bagman: or maybe declarer gets the diamonds more or less accidentally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since day 1 -- i've always liked hands where trump are never led|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d3|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|bagman: W knows that S has the @DK|pg||
nt|chorush:  assuming the diamond J is covered the 7 will come into its own|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SJ seems clear to me  ---   but is there potential uppercut concern??|pg||
nt|bagman: W also knows that S has the @HA so diamonds are 3-2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||

nt|joest: we have had a bunch of lead changes.  This match has been close throughout and remains so with 10 boards left|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south thought that the misunderstanding over 4NT meant he could take liberties - that's a rash assumption; EW don't give a whole lot away in the play or defence|pg||
nt|joest: and indeed Ginossar would have been in seroius trouble had the top heart gotten ruffed off|pg||
nt|barnets: Here Lauria played 4@S on the ead of the @CA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Ginossar: nice defense|pg||
nt|chorush: grand slam time|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like a grand slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: versace did double|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: he was afraid his partner would bid again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: shows you what i know|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: amazingly enough, we're ahead of the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i missed Pekka's inference that since South still had !AH then trump must be 32|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: always nice to have it in the bank|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: anyone for Garbage Stayman here?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: should n bid 2c, planning to pass any response?|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson can bid 2@C puppet, and get to 2@D|pg||
nt|swanson: IT is very considerate of the players to be giving us such a close match.  Many of the realy round matches were surprising runaways.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  curious choice of contract in the OR|pg||
nt|joest: it doesn't look like he dropped the diamond king either :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 5 imps to schwarz on 53|pg||
nt|athene: will east double 1@S - 1NT (t/o of spades)?|pg||
nt|athene: he has the hcp, i suppose, but not really the shape|pg||
nt|oleberg: one very odd thing in the original book: 1@D-1@H, 1@S-2@S = 8-11|pg||
nt|oleberg: Sry, private|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: I would prefer to be playing 'regular Stayman' on this one|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, playing normal Stayman can and would have same auction|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: this was good for him|pg||
mb|p|an|alerted|nt|athene: interesting that north chooses double rather than 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: normally you bid 2@H with five and a strong hand|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for n/s   but still seems only 11 tricks in hearts   unless diamond lead|pg||
nt|barnets: but when he misguessed the diamond suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe they play negative free bids? (immediate 2@H would be non-forcing)|pg||
nt|ady: chance in 5@C for e/w|pg||
nt|barnets: he was dead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pass probably forces RDBL  to play or show certain 2-suiters|pg||
nt|bagman: W not happy if pass is transfer to XX|pg||
nt|bagman: hoping for something else|pg||
mb|2H|nt|swanson: early|pg||
nt|swanson: This is an auction where it is almost never a winning action to balance.  Don't even look at your hand.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  club suit lost in the bidding, as happens from time to time|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  bidding geared towards all the other suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Cohler hates to sell to 2@D with a stiff diamond, but has no convenient way into the auction|pg||
nt|joest: and that's for the best!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 2NT in other room, will fare a lot worse.|pg||
nt|joest: the hesitation suggests perhaps short diamonds in east and starting diamonds from the dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i still haven't found the mysterious elusive NS convention card sorry|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass missed out here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H bid by north|pg||
nt|roswolf: not west|pg||
nt|ady: west has to choose between double or overcalling diamonds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would be happt yo play in a @c partial with the EW cards|pg||
nt|bagman: might become 1NT XX with about even strength with the declarer having the advantage of seeing his sides forces|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh  or allowing opener to bid 5+ suit|pg||
nt|bagman: Would you pass if N has XX'd denying a 5 card suit? (or run to black suit rescue)?|pg||
mb|d!|nt|joest: 1@s showed precisely three|pg||
nt|joest: 1@h showed spades|pg||
nt|joest: things might go very differently here on the @Dj lead|pg||
nt|barnets: the def appear to have 4 sure tricks from this siade|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: or just leading queen from hand|pg||
nt|barnets: south has enough now|pg||
nt|barnets: to bid 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough rebid for North   i suspect 2@S woud also get some votes   unless playing Gazilli or Bart |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe only 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|barnets: well predicted|pg||
nt|chorush: spade J is a huge grand slam card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in thinner days i did --  it never worked|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: should be an imp to Cayne|pg||
nt|athene: if he pulls three rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|joest: it's amazing how differently hands play from one side as opposed to the other|pg||
nt|athene: small club off dummy, hoping for @CH10 with west|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense has to be careful here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SK = Queen or shortness|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yorkbeach:  the pre-emptive 3! raise did its job - forced the opponents to guess and they guessed wrong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s raise|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: fortunately he need only 8 tricks, so has margin for error|pg||
nt|barnets: the simplest line is to ruff 2 diamonds in hand|pg||
nt|bagman: they have to stay out of clubs; they also need to be careful in diamonds not to grab the ace to give a spade ruff  with a trump trick|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not just drive @s taking 3@s, 3@d and 2 aces?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i guess that might be better, true|pg||
nt|athene: club shift now to get @C@C@S@S@H@H for the defence?|pg||
nt|athene: kinda hard to find that one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D shift seems more likely  on the auction|pg||
pc|sA|nt|swanson: Declarer won't lead another round of trumps.  Time for a cross-ruff.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no -- i'd like to retract that statement please|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: too late :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  retract anything you'd like, Al|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: looks like 2nd/4th applies in middle of hand too|pg||
nt|athene: on this auction declarer should be well-stocked in both red suits, so looking for clubs to be his weak spot is not out of the question|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ady: finesse diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does that include retract foot from mouth/|pg||
nt|athene: but still very hard; he could have the @CQ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: actually i guess versace might get squeezed anyway|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: Q@H?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: now I think I have this right:  Schwartz will be picking up this time right?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|barnets: I wonder what X of 1@H would have been|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how did West get that right??|pg||
nt|bagman: This might take some time|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense is still in control with a diamond, a heart and 2 clubs to come|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then again -- how many would DBL 1N with East hand?  CC just says "strong"  but all of those Jacks ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the question is   is it clear that Askgaard has natural trump trick|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: spade pitch now, but then what on the @HA?|pg||
nt|barnets: by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: E/W not very happy|pg||
nt|barnets: des it show a 1@H overcall ?|pg||
nt|joest: good question barnet.  It might have gotten a heart lead which would have been a huge difference|pg||
nt|athene: east would have had more chance finding the club attack if he had @CQ10x|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|henryb:  Of course, Al|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: if he comes down to @DAx declarer just leads a diamond to the queen and ducks the next one|pg||
nt|ady: squeeze on west|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room in 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schaltz opened 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Acolites all over the world would approve|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: now 12|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: a defender who has to guard three suits might as well give up - you always get crushed|pg||
nt|roswolf: doesnt have to|pg||
nt|ady: was aqeezed in 3 suits|pg||
nt|athene: i think that was +2, not +3?|pg||
nt|ady: squeezed|pg||
nt|roswolf: methinks only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: hands where you have a big side suit fit but a thin trump suit are a real pain because you can't crossruff |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Askgaard still trying to beat 2N|pg||
nt|pelu: even in DEN we are few 1@C-openers |pg||
nt|henryb:  Helness, as you can see, made 4@h against a trump lead with only a slight slip in the defense|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yorkbeach:  yes would be a good try - if North ducks, you can make it - not that I can see a good reason to duck|pg||
nt|athene: you have to draw trumps to use your side suit but you can never do that and keep control|pg||
nt|ady: diamond now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  why not a spade?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not a heart anyway|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might get out for -1 and gain 3 IMPs|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bagman: It was clear to West that N had the @DQ|pg||
nt|bagman: so grabbing the ace would always lose a diamond trick|pg||
nt|bagman: or set up a trick for N|pg||
nt|bagman: Now Fantoni needs a lucky club position or some kind of secondary squeeze in clubs and spades|pg||
nt|bagman: maybe JT of clubs in West|pg||
nt|chorush: Well, I would be declaring 3D unsuccesfully but it looks like the Danes will go +200 instead|pg||
nt|bagman: with JTx of clubs and a spade west, there might be a vice type of squeeze|pg||

nt|vugraphzfg: East seems unhappy with the lead, but it's hard to see what West was supposed to lead on this auction|pg||
nt|barnets: I like these hands|pg||
nt|henryb:  on board 6|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|joest: at the other table south was see that all three players had taken calls in front of him and that the bidding was in 4@s already|pg||
nt|joest: not surprised that he didn't double though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's Fantonin 2@C  10-13 HCP, 5+@C unbalance|pg||
mb|2D|nt|joest: not so surprised that he didn't double|pg||
nt|joest: 3 is obviously preemptive|pg||
nt|othered1: There's been a bunch of interesting numbers in this match.  Add another from OR here.|pg||
nt|joest: now Ginossar's action is much harder.  He might just try 4@h|pg||
nt|chorush: EW are very likely to make 3NT if they can get there|pg||
mb|3C|nt|joest: 3@c = puppet stayman asking for a five card major|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if West rebids 1@s, will North take some action?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  passed in the other room - seems a but wet with a 4-loser hand|pg||
nt|barnets: and 13 possible in diamonds here|pg||
nt|chorush: another slam|pg||
nt|barnets: but 6 is better|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would like 2@H by S|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@H might show a better hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: probably|pg||
nt|bagman: Nunes supports and hopes to reach something playable|pg||
nt|bagman: and at the same time preempt the sapdes|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can still bid @H over 3@d|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  bit wet|pg||
nt|chorush: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  different problem...|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  South is enjoying this :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S perhaps from south|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is unlikley to have 5@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious   2@H opening needs 6@H, and this hand TOO STRONG to open 2@D which could be 5 or 6 card major|pg||
nt|chorush: now, wil Fantoni-Nunes take the save?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|joest: now all Berk has to do is duck the jack of spades lead!|pg||
nt|othered1: Depending on style (or sanity level) of jump overcall, 4@H looks normal.|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting club suit|pg||
nt|barnets: dec can play for no losers|pg||
nt|joest: you would be leading the queen and then the nine right barnet?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have made for an interesting auction|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the queen is the right card here|pg||
nt|athene: if it wins you can afford a diamond loser|pg||
nt|bagman: West has no filler in diamonds, single stopper and no quick tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in case you weren't aware  ---  this is good stuff|pg||
nt|hedyg: Nunes has a good hand for a save, not for defense|pg||
nt|chorush: may hold their loss to down 1 in 4 clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Al|pg||
nt|bagman: but he was a passed hand so partner was probably not playing him for much|pg||
mb|4D|nt|wygbe1: 3n rates to go down on spade lead, unless w makes amazing duck of first trick|pg||
nt|joest: btw ducking is nuts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but no certainty of having 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: cash the @CK first, i guess, as you can only pick up 4-0 with south|pg||
nt|barnets: Schwarz misjudged board 54 when they saved in 5@C over 4@H which went down|pg||
nt|barnets: that will be a big swing to Cayne|pg||
mb|4N|nt|yorkbeach:  North knows South is either very weak or has only 3@s because South had the chance to bid 1@s over 1@h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders know too :)|pg||
nt|barnets: by leading the Q and then the 9|pg||
nt|athene: no point playing low because even if that draws the king, you will get a heart shift|pg||
nt|athene: and same with playing the ace - then if the diamonds don't come in you are a trick short anyway|pg||
nt|chorush: holy s---|pg||
nt|bagman: East took 3NT quite seriously|pg||
nt|hedyg: he thought W was strong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: so this looks to be a push at -50|pg||
nt|chorush: magnificent|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: west and north each thought a little|pg||
nt|bagman: E has 6 diamonds and the spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: i got water|pg||
nt|bagman: From E point of view, 4NT might be cold and it must have some play because of the spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the 6th @d|pg||
nt|bagman: assuming that the defense do not take 4 first tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: not far fetched on the bidding|pg||
nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@D was a game force|pg||
nt|barnets: and 3@d was support|pg||
nt|chorush: South a long way from being finished bidding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: note the spade jack as suit preference |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|swanson: This would not be a good time for 'coded' leads where jack is top.  Declarer would find the winning duck.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yorkbeach:  definite chances here|pg||
nt|athene: assuming you get an immediate heart shift|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joest: yes last set another hand came up which showed that convention in a poor light|pg||
nt|wygbe1: very true|pg||
nt|joest: one of many examples I'm afraid|pg||
nt|joest: so Berk has to hope the @HA is in the right hand|pg||
nt|barnets: a sound shot|pg||
nt|barnets: this may take more time to play|pg||
nt|chorush: now all he has to do is make it. We can all see that whatever he does will work but he cannot see that diamonds are not 4-1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: not a pleasant hand to play|pg||
nt|bagman: MIght be claimed asking if @SJ drops now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: or South having Kx of clubs -- much less likely|pg||
nt|joest: this is halfway through the final set so the players might be taking a breather|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: little break time for the players|pg||
nt|joest: ?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yorkbeach:  one sure entry to hand with the @hK and another possible entry by ruffing a good heart - how best to use them?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not so bad; you can fiddle around and if you go down, well it's only fifties|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  probably going to take club finesse|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yorkbeach:  but not quite yet...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: but the pleasure of squeezing opps!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chorush: tempting to play king and start spades|pg||
nt|bagman: should have cashed AQ of spades before 3rd diamond|pg||
nt|bagman: then entries to cash if the @SJ had come down|pg||
nt|chorush: Very nice swing to the Danes, fully deserved|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: he may be hoping the spades don't work legitimately so that 5@d can't make|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|barnets: a spec says he made a slam with that exact play of Q and 9 at rubber bridge no less|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Madsen didn't have weak NT  so  everybody bidding in the other room |pg||
pc|d6|nt|barnets: when it was worth some cash|pg||
nt|joest: kaching!|pg||

nt|joest: what a friendly layout for east-west|pg||
nt|barnets: I think he played it well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: definitely some imps there   other room in 5@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Nunes had bid the @hs..could EW play NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: bye all   |pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: meanwhile Cayne opened up 25 imp lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 HCP, 5+@H or 4441@D|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: Meckwell opened 2@c Precision at the other table which permitted them to compete to 4@c|pg||
nt|joest: Berk has an amazingly good hand for all this bidding|pg||
nt|swanson: Berkowitz is asking everybody to check the backs of the cards at this point.|pg||
nt|joest: cards lie very favorably for east-west|pg||
nt|kit: Cohler is lighter than Berk will be playing him for -- by quite a bit.|pg||
nt|athene: a very offensively-oriented double in the other room backfired|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Problem with that sort of overcall is always the third opponent|pg||
nt|swanson: 1@C opening looks fine to me, but I don't see any merit in a 1@D overcall.|pg||
nt|joest: of course if they roll 600 he'll forgive him|pg||
nt|athene: if you are going to double on hands like that it means partner can never ever pass them|pg||
nt|poohbear: not me|pg||
nt|hedyg: prbably not|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this is a common misunderstanding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the pace may be slow but at least the systems are not too complicated|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: but four looks the limit|pg||
nt|athene: it's not enough to know a double is "takeout"|pg||
nt|roswolf: great result for schwartz in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: you have to know "HOW takeout-ish?"|pg||
nt|athene: in other words how often is partner allowed to pass it? is a decent 4-card trump holding enough?|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry|pg||
nt|barnets: grandslam bid by Cayne in open|pg||
nt|chorush: Remember when Versace doubled 4H to keep his partner from going on. At the other table, he went on to 5 clubs doubled for 800|pg||
nt|oleberg: Wests hand is not worth a GF-relay, as 10-counts are normally opened.|pg||
nt|bagman: probably not, because then N would support to 4@H, x'd and down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they could never bid 4NT over that|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: Romex game tries apply here -- i don't remember exactly what that means  [i think can distinguish short vs long suit tries]|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: 2@H from north now|pg||
nt|athene: and he has shown his hand quite nicely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OR  Ole  does 2N just get info about 3 vs 4@S and min/max|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2nt forces 3@C to show one sort of try, and 3@D@H@S are the other sort|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is obscure|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|athene: south will try 3@S now, i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: N pulled pass card then changes to 2s|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS COULD BE DANGEROUS|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South overcalled 2NT at the other table to show 5-5 in @H and @c|pg||
nt|oleberg: I feel certain they have a method to distinguish 3 and 4-card support|pg||
nt|athene: but looks as though 2nt is something else here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: south will try 3@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  simplifies the auction but makes it hard to find a 5-3 @s fit|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is 2nt just asking if partner has four spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess 3@D=natural, 3@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: And now: XX|pg||
nt|athene: that double might slightly backfire - is south really so sure he can beat 3@DXX?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess it's hard for west to do that as his diamonds are not great and east doesn't have to have all those honours in diamonds|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: has anyone ever cue bid with a hand as big as WEst's and NOT heard their partner sign off?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you cannot do everything|pg||
pc|d3|nt|swanson: Why not 3@C with the South hand after partner rebids clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he will try 4@S :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: because that would be invitational|pg||
nt|roswolf: another double|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@s should be non-forcing but perhaps ns haven't played together much|pg||
nt|roswolf: well only 50's|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S definitely sounds non-forcing to me|pg||
nt|athene: north had lots of ways to force, didn't he?|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead in 5@C best   with only 2 tricks outside clubs  will need 9 trump tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW @d fit should tell North that South is void|pg||
pc|d5|nt|joest: surely Berkowitz will hit him out|pg||
nt|joest: let him out|pg||
nt|bessi2: but.. his pd did freely bid 1@s and south has a very pretty hand|pg||
nt|athene: sure|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: even though he has shown his hand with 1NT, in a way|pg||
nt|joest: declarer will lead two low clubs up, in case south has Kx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder how they differentiate  PASS vs RDBL vs bid over that DBL|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you asked for @D partner!|pg||
nt|athene: ok so declarer is grateful to the double (club lead looks more threatening) but still he hasn't got nine tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play for 3@H or 3@S??     @H seems best to me|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: That third opponent will get you every time|pg||
nt|wygbe1: west having trouble envisioning red v white overcall that wont produce game|pg||
pc|sA|nt|joest: a pass would have been plus at both tables and a six imp gain|pg||
nt|athene: he still has a better hand for play in spades than he might have|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: that is why 3@S was perfectly justified|pg||
nt|athene: as it happens with the 6-2 club split declarer might have time to get the hearts going|pg||
nt|athene: now even with two heart entries south does not have time to knock out the @CA and @CK AND force an entry to his partner's hand in spades|pg||
nt|oleberg: Not an enviable position for South. A club-switch is the only logical, but it looks like no future.|pg||
nt|athene: but of course declarer can't see the layout and might go for spades, hoping for Kxx onside|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: well, ok, 3@S was not ridiculous|pg||
nt|bessi2: I fell 3@s is about the value bid.. I think pass is too cautious|pg||
nt|athene: i think cayne should just have bid 2@S over 2@D, personally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner passes with 18 and 5 decent trumps and it makes +1....he has a right feel a bit miffed|pg||
nt|athene: of course Seamon never feels miffed :) but he has a right to there|pg||
nt|bessi2: agree.. that dbl was just asking for trouble|pg||
nt|bessi2: seems right to start @h's now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yorkbeach:  chances for 12 tricks from here|pg||
nt|henrik_r:  De spiller sgu' godt, men nu er sponsor ikke pÃ¥ banen i resten af kampen, sÃ¥ det blir svÃ¦rt...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|athene: ok, that diamond return was very revealing|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|joest: once Cohler finds (needs) the spade ace onside he will certainly try to drop the @Hk offside|pg||
nt|joest: diamond to the king and a spade up is my best guess |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|athene: i wonder if declarer will work out from that that south must have the heart entries and only two clubs|pg||
nt|athene: well, yes, 3@C looks ok to me :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise a club shift would have looked more appealing for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 28 Cayne 26-2 for the set   now leads Lynch by 24|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
mc|8|nt|wygbe1: down 2 now, if s wins sp and leads d|pg||
nt|ady: trumps lead  and south can play a spade early from north hand  which east hast to duck  and the 11 tricks can be made on a cross ruff|pg||

mb|4H|nt|athene: hard to get there, though, with only an 8-card fit, and combined 20 count|pg||
nt|oleberg: 1@D is always unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: shows 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: does double here show both majors or no majors?|pg||
nt|bessi2: Kranyak is doing a lot of bidding at the moment|pg||
nt|athene: now lauria might look more kindly on his @Sxxx|pg||
nt|oleberg: showing (10) 11-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 4+@D   in 1st/2nd seat always unbal   3rd/4th maybe bal|pg||
nt|athene: surprising pass from east; you would expect 1nt|pg||
nt|oleberg: I sit corrected|pg||
nt|athene: even if you can't have game on, it looks normal to respond|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that was a fairly horrible holding initially, but if the opponents have a nine-card fit, and you think partner can handle the force...|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi computer crashed:(|pg||
nt|athene: as mentioned before, versace doesn't miss a whole lot of games|pg||
nt|athene: north and south both had good hands|pg||
nt|athene: just a matter of keycards|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT = 15-17 so perhaps this is a downgrade|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bessi2: scwartz will surely bid 4s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've got other suits covered -- trump is YOUR responsibility|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bessi2: dbl and an easy trump lead|pg||
nt|barnets: def need a safe lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Ole -- i was typing instead of watching you|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they play 1NT response as a relay|pg||
pc|s7|nt|barnets: thats safe|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|joest: great board a match result for n-s|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead is sort of auto here|pg||
nt|oleberg: the pass of 1@D is likely because many replies are artificial, and the hand doesn't meet the requirements|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D-1N shows @C  by unpassed hand, not sure if passed hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wygbe1: i would think dbl by w would show both majors - maybe he bid 2h for the lead, expecting to be outbid|pg||
nt|othered1: they also allow some 14's, so no 1N with 3.5 honor tricks looks unusual|pg||
nt|barnets: all roads seem to lead home|pg||
nt|athene: okie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this lead will hold declarer to 4 -- other leads would have held declarer to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Diamond finesse or 3rd spade when in the dummy with the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: both work|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a top heart is marked to W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it doesn't matter on this hand, but would you lead @S or @D from West|pg||
nt|bagman: more or less marking the @DK east|pg||
nt|chorush: which marks the diamond K in east which means that declarer doesnt have to guess 3rd spade or diamond finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: diamond trying for a ruff or overruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to say  if i'd been on lead  declarer would have found @DK at trick 1|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: i remember in bridge magazine bidding panels, when Tony Forrester thought it was obvious to double, he would just put "i lead a trump" as his proposed bid :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: North's eyes sort of rolled from side to side at dummy|pg||
nt|ady: 5 level too high    the best hope for Cayne they get that high|pg||
nt|barnets: but dec cant see friendly layout|pg||
nt|joest: Duboin mulling over whethre partner can have AJ10x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so unpassed would have bid 1N - but for a different reason than you're thinking Bill|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H bid with north hand would have worked out better, i guess|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: as wilde might have said - "to reach six missing two aces might be counted a misfortune; to reach six missing two aces and the king of trumps looks like overbidding"|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bessi2: I don't like to say it.. but I feel south got what he deserved with that 3@s bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck @H means NOT 2@S|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: with 2@S  win @HK play @S  then get ruff when partner wins @HA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's my story and i'm sticking to it|pg||
nt|chorush: would be a better story with the heart 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i think Askgaard  IF he plays back @S -- it should be Jack|pg||
pc|s9|nt|joest: or if he played it there he wanted to play in the stronger trump suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  meanwhile in the other vg match the score is 18-14|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: i'm told NS are a fairly new partnership|pg||
nt|othered1: They do play standard (abigouous J) leads.|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  9  our 3N   Helgemo in 4@S West after  3@C-DBL-P-4@S|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: and on board 6, 9 and 10 here we see the same thing|pg||
nt|athene: both players getting aggressive on the same hand|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|joest: rises ace to block the suit in case east started wtih J10x|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: and ending overboard|pg||
nt|athene: it suggests each is used to playing with a "sounder" partner|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|swanson: Could one double with 4-2-2-5, planning to pull 2@H to 3@C?|pg||
nt|swanson: to 2@S I mean|pg||
nt|joest: i suppose.  When I do that it goes 3@d on my left and partner bids 3@h :)|pg||
nt|swanson: Then you have to bid 3@S.  Just have a few values for the double.|pg||
nt|swanson: It is never far wrong just to bid one's suit, however.|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|joest: when I 'expand' on a convention, bad things usually happen|pg||
nt|joest: and my partner's first words: "what was double"? |pg||
nt|swanson: I've heard that a few times.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes their styles dont seem to mesh|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: that should get 12 imps for Bjarnarson|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even 13|pg||
nt|athene: not a clear-cut decision to bid 4@S with the west hand after 3@C X P|pg||
nt|athene: pass, 3NT possible|pg||
pc|hK|nt|barnets: now a heart|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bessi2: I don't think north's 4@s was aggressive at all..|pg||
nt|barnets: play has taken an age here in open|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: this will be very expensive|pg||
nt|athene: partner doesn't have to have four spades and even when he does, 3nt can be right|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer can afford to ruff a diamond high (@HK + @CA + diamond)|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: pass doesn't seem right when vul   but 3N definitely an option|pg||
pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  absolutely :)|pg||
nt|joest: so a push|pg||
nt|joest: hard to believe but this table is now actually ahead!|pg||
nt|joest: but i am just guessing a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: versace did not play slowly|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I just clicked slowly, my fault|pg||
nt|barnets: then he had little chance|pg||
nt|barnets: your fault I make it against you dan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other vugraph match is close too Lynch over Cayne by 5|pg||
nt|athene: mini NT from Multon now|pg||
nt|athene: that guarantees a different auction from the other room, anyway :)|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how high now?|pg||
nt|athene: but might not matter too much; i guess NS will wander into 4@S either way|pg||
nt|oleberg: North will probably 4@S in both rooms, 1NT or not.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S from north, if not playing transfers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 3@S preempt?|pg||
nt|athene: i would prefer to transfer if possible|pg||
nt|athene: with those red suits|pg||
nt|athene: i want partner playing it|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt is possible too actually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing 1 round   natural 14+ hcp or balanced 15+|pg||
mb|1D!|an|!h|nt|yorkbeach:  plenty of minor suit contracts this set|pg||
nt|barnets: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transfer to a mini-NT   does anybody else do this???|pg||
nt|henryb:  at imps? I doubt it. At matchpoints, maybe|pg||
nt|oleberg: Maybe North has both options|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from the '08 convention card -- it appears ALL bids starting at 2@D are transfers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-9 HCP, 4+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  0-11|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: north in the other room treated his hand as a limit raise in diamonds (i assume that is what 3@C was anyway)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not obvious to reach game|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D looks a bit wet to me|pg||
nt|joest: south might get away with 2@h as a passed hand but that is still pretty pushy.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: everyone is having a better time at the table now|pg||
mb|d!|an|cards|nt|ahollan1: it is very common over mini-NT to use Stayman and maybe 2N as the ONLY artificial bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok looks as though NS play some sort of two-way club|pg||
nt|roswolf: all roads lead to 3nt|pg||
nt|joest: i am checking their convention card now :)|pg||
nt|joest: i mean 2@c could be a raise but I would think he woudl make a negative double or something to keep hearts in play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EVERYTHING else = to play|pg||
nt|pelu: if u hve a good system, why not use it? - I play 12-14 /15-17 AND SAME SYSTEM|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: you put a little more pressure on the 4th hand without transfers|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: especially when you bid 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zimmermann's decision probably a hedge between  try to buy hand to make vs blast to preempt|pg||
mb|2S|nt|swanson: It might be tempting for East to make an agressive game try here.  Won't work out well.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and to me|pg||
nt|athene: north might try 3@S now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trying to catch up now...|pg||
nt|athene: now he knows his partner probably has a singleton in hearts at most|pg||
nt|ady: club honors lay well for n/s   loos like they may play part score|pg||
nt|athene: he still wants his partner playing it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and all 3/4 level responses as natural are brutally effective|pg||
nt|athene: east might be thinking about 5@D now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so now  Zimmermann forcing to game -- so 2@H seems very silly to me|pg||
nt|athene: east might think that his partner's 2nt shows short hearts, which fits very nicely with his hand|pg||
nt|athene: well, south did double 2@S, remember|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that shows some spade support|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: it is an interesting sign of the times that partners open all 11 counts but responders keep right on making game tries with hands like east's. Everybody likes to bid :)|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C = min bal or any strong i guess|pg||
nt|athene: they might be in a 30-point-pack|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard for South to envisage 11 tricks facing a single raise|pg||
nt|ady: initial 2@D raise conservative|pg||
nt|athene: south will now be wondering if his partner could possibly have four spades|pg||
nt|athene: if he does, 4@S will be the spot|pg||
nt|athene: if he doesn't, it really won't, as the wrong hand is getting forced|pg||
nt|athene: playing a 4-3 fit you want the 3-card trump holding to take the force|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if diamonds were 2-2, you might make 5@d with just one club honor right (so long as you guess well)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I think he just has a claim if he ducks, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: he knows the king of diamonds is on|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: so he ducks the heart and west is triple endplayed|pg||
nt|barnets: cn he get to his hand though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: specs are saying he can return the diamond king|pg||
nt|barnets: on the @D K|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: but you still have the club plays available|pg||
nt|barnets: he cant|pg||
nt|barnets: dummy must ruff and he is stuck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if going to game -- why give EW room to maneuver?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: north might have bid 2@H intending to just bid 3@S over 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: but after south doubles he wants to play game|pg||
nt|athene: all seems fair enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh  good point  --  i missed the DBL :(|pg||
nt|henryb:  There is a lot to keep track of|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D isn't so bad, is it? has to be @CA then @HAKQ for club pitch then club ruff to get the max|pg||
nt|athene: not likely to find that defence|pg||
nt|athene: so only two down is most likely result|pg||
nt|athene: as in the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is very slow. Well over 10 minutes a board. Which is not right|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, molasses and/or glaciers spring to mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other match not playing any faster  one table on 11 the other on 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: 53 on the clock|pg||
nt|henryb:  or continents drifting apart|pg||
nt|henryb:  at 1cm a century or so|pg||
nt|oleberg: Paint drying|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it all comes down to that initial evaluation from north|pg||
nt|athene: when he showed a good 3@D bid, south took the plunge|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: if Boyd leads a club this will be over before Cohler gets started|pg||
nt|joest: ok 2@c clearly conventional then|pg||
nt|barnets: the defence can only make 1 diamond play|pg||
nt|joest: nice takeout double by east|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: South does need to lead a club, however.|pg||
nt|athene: when he shows "merely" a good 2@D bid, even though that is only a whisker less...it's enough to dissuade his partner|pg||
nt|barnets: winners in hand and no way to get them|pg||
nt|chorush: that spade overcall looks like it will be worth 2 imps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: cash the @HAJ and knock out the @DA for at least ten tricks i suppose|pg||
nt|ady: seems a decent raise to 3 level  ie 2@S  first round|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: sorry  2@H|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in the OR, when South took the plunge, I do not think North had to have nothing wasted in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of illustrates meckstroth's maxim|pg||
nt|athene: always early in the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if you have to choose between underbidding slightly and overbidding|pg||
nt|athene: overbid!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  still at least they were consistent - if you bid a slam on 26, you can hardly bid less than game here|pg||
nt|athene: you can't catch up if you don't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: except asia getting closer to north america   [that's what caused japan earthquake]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: continents drift apart about 400 times as fast as that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: director call now|pg||
nt|athene: come on Multon let's see if you can find the club lead|pg||
nt|athene: NS calling director because west paused over 4@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I think so|pg||
nt|athene: @HA is ok, still have time to shift to the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: East will probably say that he was going to sac unless west doubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from our perspective  either West huddled or another glitch with network connection|pg||
nt|athene: not impossible to find either i think|pg||
nt|athene: hmm..maybe it is|pg||
nt|henryb:  or South thought about whether 4@h was natural perhaps?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we wait     which honor do you lead from AKQ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: E went quietly at the OT so no @s lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: Ginossar havng a tough time seeing where four more tricks might come from|pg||
nt|joest: so am I|pg||
nt|barnets: actually trump and one when with the @CA|pg||
nt|barnets: still wont help|pg||
nt|joest: a trump return, or possibly a club, seems sort of normal|pg||
nt|oleberg: Fourth best|pg||
nt|athene: another suit, apparently|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: sorry, bad analysis by me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|joest: is this the right major suit 7 that Cohler led?|pg||
nt|athene: "we lead the queen from AKQ, but not in that suit of course"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: lots of books, bridge teachers, scholarly articles, etc say you should underbid rather than overbid|pg||
nt|athene: as "it is easy to catch up later"|pg||
nt|henryb:  I place all three on the table face down and invite declarer to choose one :)|pg||
nt|athene: multon wants to get a force going on east, so i guess a heart is the last thing he wants to lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Henry wins grand prize|pg||
nt|athene: but force is not likely to work against a 5-4 fit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: nothing helps def|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer likely to grab his 9 tricks instead of trying for an overtrick with risk going down in a cold contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: the lead was...........the 8@H!|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|barnets: this is more diff slam|pg||
nt|chorush: Declarer has a way to go set here, If he draws trumps he may think he can just led the club J, but a spade return would then leave him a trick short|pg||
nt|chorush: well they opened 2NT so he didnt havemuch choice|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|athene: they are wrong and meckstroth is right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it depends upon whether your bid is likely to end the auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no good planning to catch up later if your bid is liable to end the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you saw prize -- maybe not so grand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|joest: the auction just ended in the open room and they too are in 3@d|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|wygbe1: might find club shift now|pg||
nt|chorush: Yet that line seems less risky than ruffing diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|nt|swanson: A bit of a ping-pong match here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: its called table tennis not ping pong btw|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 2N=21-22|pg||
nt|bagman: E needs to find 3 discards|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|swanson: Seems like the only possibility for three more tricks.|pg||
nt|joest: Spector will be winning 1 or losing 4|pg||
nt|swanson: Depends on whether a small white ball is involved, maybe.|pg||
nt|chorush: West will have to find spade shift|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how does the committee rule -- is it reasonable for East to PASS|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: 2N showed some values|pg||
nt|athene: depends what 2@S showed|pg||
nt|athene: was 2@S michaels or just a t/o double |pg||
nt|athene: if the former, he doesn't really have the extra shape to bid at the 5-level, in my opinion|pg||
nt|oleberg: Also, to adjust the score, the huddle should indicate that bidding on is better than the alternative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dan -- did anyone ever question 2@S??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: east could have bid more than just 3@d if he had agood hand and north passed 2N|pg||
nt|oleberg: It's never iron clad, but here I think the huddle indicates it|pg||
nt|athene: some play that x of 2@H is a t/o X of spades, and hence the cue can be michaels|pg||
nt|athene: maybe what we ought to do is play board 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: East is saying that he was waiting to see if West doubled 4@s because he didn't know whether north had a good hand or a weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: to quote someone or other - i was a young man when this hand started|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: now South and West are debating how many minutes West paused for over 4@s|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D!|an|4+ !hs|mb|p|mb|2C!|an|6 !cs, not 3 !hs|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|asking|nt|warrens:  a @D lead and a @S back beats 3NT by W, but that's pretty hard to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: need to lead a diamond to beat 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double dummy|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  oops|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: now spade lead easier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Qx is often a good holding for notrump but not here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could easily have been right, just give South @SK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Schaltz asks about auction Z: "he has 4+ @hs and he just relayed ... I showed 6-7 clubs and nothing special"|pg||
pc|sT|nt|warrens:  better, give partner Axx of @S, then East's bid is ideal|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|h3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: so that was 1 point to monaco|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|nt|warrens:  the key to this hand is that S has to keep 1 @H, that's all|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You sound like the European Song Contest, Barnet. Monaco 1 point|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Must be a bad song|pg||

nt|joest: i would say +600 is a fine result here|pg||
nt|athene: is there a break for dinner after this set?|pg||
nt|chorush: I feel for Ginossar because I would be set too|pg||
nt|oleberg: The meaning of 2nt, as opposed to pass and XX is probably importent.|pg||
nt|bagman: Asgaard made the assumption that his partner had the @CK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since 1@C forcing, not really any need to upgrade|pg||
nt|bagman: If declarer had @HA and and AK of clubs, he had 9 tricks|pg||
mb|2C!|an|natural, 10/11-15|nt|yorkbeach:  if there is time :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a 2@C opener even Hedy would make|pg||
mb|2D!|an|asking, inv+|nt|bessi2: 6@d makes.. but not a slam you want to be in|pg||
nt|athene: i think if you are debating "how many minutes", it counts as a break in tempo :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: 3@c over 2@s would be pass/correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: 2@s was @h + minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW can open 1N with 11 -- but i guess that needs good 11 rather than favorable vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: the Italians raised to 3@h (weak) in the replay|pg||
nt|joest: this seems like a straightforward 4@s call|pg||
mb|3C!|an|minimum, no major|nt|ady: ambitious 5@C   did well to get out down 1|pg||
nt|joest: three ten nine combinations, the fourth ten ( as a kicker) and a fifth spade|pg||
nt|joest: this is more than 'a ten count' imho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=relay, inv+|pg||
nt|hedyg: see? thats the kind of suit i like for the precision 2@c opening :p|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  agree with North's overcall here|pg||
nt|barnets: it would take a 5-1 diamond split to stop it making playing diamonds provided trumps split which was likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we've seen this all before -- but this time opener has GOOD suit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: Here puppet will conceal North's 4-card heart holding|pg||
nt|joest: I'msure Rodwell played it well but it seems he might have received a helping hand|pg||
nt|kit: So likely to get heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: East will know declarer has four hearts and South four spade by the time this is over and will avoid a major suit lead.|pg||
nt|kit: yes Jack, a mis-discard at the end|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will be hard to apply the breaks now West has reversed|pg||
nt|ady: can keep out of game on this auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  how?|pg||
nt|athene: was that a typo for "can't"? :)|pg||
nt|ady: would 4@C be absolutely forcing|pg||
nt|ady: if 3@D is forcing to game  best just to rebid 3@C  especially with partner bidding hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 3N?|pg||
nt|chorush: Better grab it while he can. there are limits to science|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S blackjack too positional to do anything else|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: 2@S showing values i guess, suggesting to partner that notrumps will be wrong if he has a singleton club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  leaves room for partner to bid 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: no, North's heart holding concealed|pg||
nt|joest: well this will be ahuge pick up just when Spector needed it|pg||
nt|athene: i would never pass 4@C with east on this auction|pg||
nt|joest: I'm not sure what this shows as opposed to a direct 3@s|pg||
nt|joest: even in my own partnerships! :)|pg||
nt|othered1: In the days of the Blue Team, the great Italians used to double off-pattern.  Guess they're more structured now.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|joest: Sementa probably playing him for some slow ten count with a four card spade suit but I am just guessing|pg||
nt|barnets: strange|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so much for telepathy|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I don't like that 3N bid very much.. why not 3@c|pg||
nt|ady: because you would expect more from opener?|pg||
nt|athene: well just because i would never be sure it was non forcing|pg||
nt|joest: they will discuss this at the bar though for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: that board may put the match out of reach|pg||
nt|athene: wow, south likes his hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  In 2/1 I guess you have to respond 1N|pg||
nt|athene: south has a nice hand if his partner raises hearts|pg||
nt|athene: not otherwise though|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, North melds 100, 120 if @s is trump|pg||
nt|pelu: Ss hand show why I dont like to play 21hGF|pg||
nt|henryb:  that's the only redeeming feature of his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great catch Henry|pg||
nt|athene: interesting the club suit here is similar to that on board 7, in 2nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H did not establish game force -- but 3@C probably did|pg||
nt|athene: lead problem for east|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will have decent diamonds here, maybe four, even five|pg||
nt|athene: but still diamond lead is ok with good texture i suppose|pg||
nt|pelu: So S could pass 2@s? that would be a normal bid!|pg||
nt|henryb:  Other match is tied at 19 after I think 13 boards|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are up to 11 minutes a board and slowing down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did they start on time?|pg||
nt|henryb:  3 minutes late or so|pg||
nt|athene: glaciers have given way to the build-up of fossil records...the collapse of stars into red dwarfs....Barnet Shenkin's opening leads...|pg||
nt|athene: i am running out of metaphors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: american congress  doing    well anything other than posturing|pg||
nt|henryb:  but that time, I presume, was spent on system discussion, which counts as part of playing time|pg||
nt|oleberg: They don't have running scores for these matches. but maybe walking scores would be an idee.|pg||
nt|henryb:  or waking scores?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in vaudeville   that would get a 'rim shot'   ba da bump|pg||
nt|henryb:  tune in tomorrow morning for the first quarter results?|pg||
nt|oleberg: Maybe we have lost connection again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does ACBL have any evidence to support the idea that their KOs are timed events??|pg||
nt|pelu: Monaco played Denmark i Bonn grand nations - same Monaco Team, but Den was the Senior team - the fight wasOT to be last :):)|pg||
nt|henryb:  been 6 minutes since the auction ended|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we may be lost in cyberspace again|pg||
nt|oleberg: Can the operator confirm the lead has yet to be made?|pg||
nt|athene: Monaco might be my pick for this autumn's bermuda bowl actually - they have this four plus fantunes don't they?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Fantoni made good nondouble which would have let them get it right |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i knew more about their agreements   3@S instead of 3N is confusing without a playbook|pg||
pc|sT|nt|barnets: he had already passed so could not be forcing|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: Robinson's heart suit concealed off this puppet auction|pg||
nt|joest: Berk will discourage|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: Means declarer will get the heart suit right eventually, but still only 8 tricks unless a misdefense|pg||
nt|ady: then best for west to supress 2nd suit when the auction has taken a bad turn|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at matchpoints you might  take view but not in an important match|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 3@C over 2@S was an option|pg||
nt|athene: it's difficult; partner might of course pass 3@C with something horrible like 5-5 in the reds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North should have a count on the spade suit|pg||
nt|chorush: It would also take a 5-1 club split on the wrong side this way|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: looks like upside down discouragement|pg||
nt|swanson: Wouldn't the 7 (instead of the 6) be a bit easier for East to read?|pg||
nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|kit: a lot easier John -- I don't think the 6 is readable|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Robinson played the 4, giving his own encouraging signal|pg||
nt|joest: on the general theory that declarer must adopt the defender's signalling methods|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|kit: If Cohler does continue hearts, I think Robinson will have very good chances|pg||
nt|joest: the demonstrably correct theory|pg||
nt|athene: but with a lot of those hands partner was doubling 1@S rather than bidding 2@H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|barnets: looked like an immediate 3@S|pg||
nt|barnets: may have worked better|pg||
nt|joest: so schwartz regains the lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could be -2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barnets: both slams bid and made by n/s were flat|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: Just what will Berk discard on 4 rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|swanson: A good thing to remember is that, as declarer, you want to use the same signals the opponents use: low if you want LHO to continue, high to discourage.|pg||
nt|joest: north has shown up with 12 so Duboin might play south for the club kig|pg||
nt|joest: king|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: endplay, doesn't matter|pg||
pc|cK|nt|warrens:  this looks like a good stop.  still have to find the @S Queen|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer guessed the diamonds well in the OR to escape for -1|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: Unfortunately Robinson chose to attack diamonds first -- now defense will be a lot easier|pg||
nt|barnets: he has a discard|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h2|pc|d5|nt|hedyg: Nunes needs to disc his @ss|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: Now a diamond back, and no more pressure on West|pg||
nt|athene: the fourth club was a valuable threat against west but of course declarer did not know that|pg||
pc|d8|nt|joest: plus diamonds break when you work those first|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: yes a strip squeeze looms absent that|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|vugraphzfg: duboin thought about claiming when pachtmann took the heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: his eyes and shoulders shrugged, but he held off|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|joest: Berk needs to blank the diamond|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yep has a chance now|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|thorvald: Interesting unblocking of spades|pg||
nt|barnets: wrongsided in closed as well|pg||
nt|warrens:  did risk the contract if declarer could read it|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Luck of the draw I would say|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: west could have bid 3N but chose 3@S|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Give South Kxxxx and it's a winner|pg||
nt|barnets: same lead so will be flat|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|thorvald: I agree declarer had a teoretical chance, but show me a player that would have been able to read that distribution|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|thorvald: Nunes also discarding spades in the other room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Declarer could actually have made after South's first unblock|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So it was not as pretty as it looked|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|warrens:  most of us would have been content with 3@D as S, but Schaltz went for the vul game.  dummy will be disappointing|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c3|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|barnets: def have to cash @SA to beat it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|barnets: when diamond knocked out|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|warrens:  10 of @S now and -2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: any spade will do for down 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, of course|pg||
nt|barnets: hard to let it through|pg||
nt|barnets: has to play another heart and then misguess what to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although declarer could have stronger spades and weaker clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again it's so easy for us to see|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@D in closed|pg||
nt|barnets: anything but a spade is down 1|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think E can see that this is going down unless declarer has AKxxxxx of @C|pg||
nt|warrens:  so a @S back looks pretty safe|pg||
nt|warrens:  but he might play a @D to be sure|pg||
nt|barnets: he is considering souths 3n with a singleton spade|pg||
nt|warrens:  a @C is unnecessary|pg||
nt|barnets: and how that is not likely|pg||
nt|warrens:  I mean a @D is unnecessary|pg||
nt|warrens:  but he want want to prevent a first round duck if declarer has AKxxxx of @C|pg||
nt|warrens:  he might want to ...|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N was a youthfull bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jan may well have a tough job when she must select the two matches for the second half. The bridge is good in all matches, so we will obviously accept the ones we get|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Had the @c 7 out to play and then put it back|pg||
nt|thorvald: Somehow Closed room have managed to get in front starting board 30 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: now took a spade out and put it back|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be 6 or 8 to Monaco|pg||

nt|wygbe1: huh?|pg||
nt|joest: what?|pg||
nt|joest: operator did Robinson endplay Berkowitz?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: west must have stiffed the diamond|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C a bit of an underbid here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course 3N wasn't cold from West hand -- but would have been interesting to see Fantoni lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=10-13 HCP, 5+@D, unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great example of perfect fit and distribution overcoming shortage of HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but those pesky 3 aces for defense|pg||
nt|bagman: In the open room they are in 3NT; here Nunes might look for 5@D (Axx x Qxx KQJ9xx) but not for 3NT|pg||
mb|2D|an|10-13, !d|nt|athene: 3@C would get them to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  someone useful looking results coming up for NS in the OR|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20  here   if Cayne can keep out of trouble can have a pick up here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  chance for Cayne to get a few IMPs back|pg||
nt|athene: somewhat peculiar decision from south in the other room to pass over the 1@D overcall|pg||
nt|othered1: At the moment the Wagar final is closer than this match -- in a dead tie.|pg||
mb|2H!|an|relay, inv+|nt|joest: whatever happened, that was a big chance that got away|pg||
nt|barnets: here south is in 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: indeed.. 2@c would not be an option for me.. 2N or 3@c both look ok to me|pg||
nt|athene: it's interesting how you should play these clubs|pg||
mb|2S!|an|some singleton|nt|athene: bash from the top gains against QJ, Q9  or J9 falling|pg||
nt|barnets: on a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but finesse the 10 first is possible|pg||
nt|bessi2: depends on where you win the first trick perhaps.. if a small @d lead to the 7 then you don't really want to cross to dummy for that play|pg||
nt|athene: can't he bid his spades or something|pg||
nt|ady: 4 down in 3@H seems a lot|pg||
nt|joest: the big question there is: can west find the duck of the heart ten from dummy?|pg||
nt|othered1: Your action on south's hand?|pg||
nt|barnets: that is still just 8 tricks|pg||
nt|chorush: Aaron Haspel has suggested an improvement to declarers line in 6H which seems right to me. Play 2 rounds of trumps leaving the heart Q in dummy then run the club J. If clubs are ...|pg||
nt|chorush: indeed 5-1 the way they were but the opponent with the singleton has only 2 trumps, you will still make it. This seems to give up nothing except rho having 6 clubs and you still ...|pg||
nt|chorush: have chances then|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2@h = RELAY, INV+|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes bidding 1@s seems normal|pg||
nt|barnets: 9 if he ducks it !!|pg||
nt|joest: i think I would guess 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know the responses :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d nf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hedy -- do you know what 2@S showed?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: and declarer works it out|pg||
nt|othered1: I like south's pass, even vulnerable.  Just a crap shoot whether partner can use those @H effectively and current methods don't allow for that investigation.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably shows supper @C fit|pg||
nt|athene: yes and asks for a stopper :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no @S stop|pg||
nt|henryb:  and looks for @s stopper|pg||
nt|athene: north should have just passed quietly and he might have been on lead against 3nt very shortly|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you have the @C9|pg||
nt|joest: so the Israelis are playing for far lower stakes|pg||
nt|barnets: well 3@S is down a trick|pg||
nt|bagman: missed 4@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely showed something in @s|pg||
nt|bagman: well bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: not what Nunes was looking for|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bessi2: hmmm.. a mute point since clearly 3N will be played from the south side :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this looks gin on that lead|pg||
nt|athene: if you have the @C9 then you bash them from the top|pg||
nt|athene: gaining against 3-3 or Qx or Jx|pg||
nt|athene: or singleton honour if you have the 8 as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: on this lead you can set up the hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: a good swing likely for schwartz|pg||
nt|athene: an interesting hand - my guess is he will just bash out three rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests he might go for 3 diamonds and 3 spades|pg||
nt|athene: but the diamonds are a bit blocked|pg||
nt|athene: sure he can lose one and then finesse against the honour-8|pg||
nt|athene: but he is short of entries to hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed.. it the 6 and 7 of @d were reversed that would work|pg||
nt|barnets: on 58 cayne also were down but down 2 in 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: ahhhhhh ty Dan :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|joest: the third and final no trump|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H +3@s+2@C+1@D IF YOU PLAY ON HEARTS FIRST|pg||
nt|barnets: where we saw the clubs misgueesed|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Nunes decided not to ask where|pg||
nt|bagman: Give Fantoni the @SA instead of the @SK and he would have certainly continued|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2@H=INV+  then Fantoni would move with a better hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|joest: i'm getting a lot of questions about what happened at the end onthelast hand.  Operator can you clear it up by any chance?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was a bit heavy according to 2010 CC   but after 1@S  11-14 is tough range to play|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yorkbeach:  Sementa led a low @d from Kx and declarer guessed everything wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: Declarer took a heart finesse and lost an extra trick|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bessi2: Kranyak had thought for some time.. certainly about the club play we have been discussing|pg||
nt|roswolf: going for the clubs|pg||
nt|joest: Some norths would rebid 2@c, then over south's 2@h would bid 2@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  10+-16 works okay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or what bagman said |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|joest: that bid is pretty delicate though|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec in 6@H on same lead of trump on 59 Duboin playing the hand|pg||
nt|athene: you really have to have quite a wide range for 1nt after a spade overcall|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: exactly right Bill|pg||
nt|athene: you don't want to double and have to bid 2nt just on some 15 or something|pg||
nt|athene: it's easier after 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: you could double with some confidence you will get to rebid 1nt|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: sorry i mean 1nt balance after a spade opener :)|pg||
nt|bagman: If Fantoni passes 3@D, Nunes can be fairly sure that they have missed nothing|pg||
pc|d8|nt|loe48: i think 2c rebid is correct|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: he did not duck the @H in the open|pg||
nt|barnets: yes it is strange dec did not use his 2 entries|pg||
nt|barnets: to fin clubs|pg||
nt|joest: so they may well go down 1 and push this board|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: I prefer that auction, but I don't know the NS methods enough to know if that was available|pg||

nt|bessi2: Schwartz superior judgment with that 3@c bid earned his side 10 imps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  7 IMPs back|pg||
nt|ady: still the gap closed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  another chance for Cayne|pg||
nt|athene: west should surely have redoubled 2@D in the other room rather than bidding 2@H|pg||
nt|othered1: was there a case for taking the @C finesse at trick 2?|pg||
nt|joest: while you had the entries.  It seems to me, yes|pg||
nt|loe48: deffinately should finesse club trick 2 imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: east claimed 10 unless @hKQ were with long diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cayne over lynch by 24  [they've finished 2nd set]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores get posted to  http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-8|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I think everyone else has finished the 2nd set|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: or at least his judgment was superior result wise|pg||
nt|athene: firstly he has equal length majors|pg||
nt|athene: secondly it will be worth a bit for east to be declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seminal book on balancing by Mike Lawrence shows how 1N range should slide according to which suit opened|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 15+ bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: both to conceal the strength and to have the lead run up to the stronger hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm, 5@C might be preferable to 4@H here|pg||
nt|ady: e/w out  of trouble|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  many pairs do not have a penalty X of a strong 1NT available|pg||
nt|oleberg: Pass shows weakness, 0-4 I believe.|pg||
nt|athene: well, not much point double being t/o of clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = majors   but how many in each :)|pg||
nt|athene: if it's a strong club|pg||
mb|1S!|an|14+, f1|nt|ady: what was 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's the only posted score so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: it would be nice if 3@c were forcing opposite a passed hand but i don't think it is|pg||
nt|joest: that leaves the 'agricultural' 3NT call i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: on board 60 it was a correct claim of 3nt making|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H needs hearts 3-3 onside|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C might make even on 4-2 hearts, as long as the king is right|pg||
nt|roswolf: i like 5@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  assume @c and another|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: we believe you operator.  WE just don't know how|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 3n by east down on h lead, but 3n by west should make|pg||
nt|joest: b/c hearts block|pg||
nt|kit: big chance for swing here -- 5@C cold, as is 3NT by West|pg||
nt|joest: maybe 3@c should be forcing |pg||
nt|joest: this hand would talk me into it|pg||
nt|wygbe1: they could try 6c, down |pg||
nt|athene: even on a bad break you have extra chances, like @DQx or a red squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: if west has limited his hand to 0-4 with his first pass, he might feel he has enough to wade in here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  DONT?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=forcing  5+@S  usually 14+ HCP, maybe fewer with @S & @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N= YOU MADE ME BID|pg||
mb|2N|an|6+-4 or 5+-5+|nt|athene: north passed assuming it was clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i guess|pg||
nt|athene: it could have been meckwell i.e. clubs and a major|pg||
nt|ady: is there not a rule with a limited hand  not to bid again opposite a passing partner?|pg||
nt|henryb:  and if partner has majors, why bid 1@s instead of 1@h?|pg||
nt|athene: well, it lets you bid 2@H later and offer a choice? :) no, wait, you only do that when you actually have the majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@C = natural OR  artificial 17+ unbal|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: that is also possible|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMMM another lapse by the normally impeccable italians|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he just bid his better major|pg||
nt|athene: south might bid 2@D now or double or something|pg||
mb|3C!|an|asking|nt|kit: wrong-sided now|pg||
nt|wygbe1: uh oh, wrongsided nt|pg||
nt|kit: And I would expect Boyd to choose his stronger suit to lead|pg||
nt|joest: of course 3@c now is forcing but it suggests spade shortness.  Berkowitz with an impossible bidding problem in standard (imho)|pg||
nt|kit: unless 2@H was real|pg||
nt|swanson: Tough for South to find a heart lead, expecting four hearts at his left.|pg||
nt|athene: yuck to 3@S in both rooms|pg||
nt|roswolf: south may kick himself|pg||
nt|joest: the cards don't lie as well this time as they did on  41|pg||
nt|barnets: no not at all|pg||
nt|barnets: He won trump cashed a second high trump|pg||
nt|barnets: and ran the @Cj|pg||
nt|barnets: the def cant beat him now|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 2 sure entries to his hand|pg||
nt|athene: and north will give preference|pg||
nt|athene: and then thank his partner for the dummy in 2@S, or not of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: might north think that south is 4531 now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: 4x1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I thought 2N was a 6-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh    2N=18+ HCP, 5+5+ or 6+4|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 4333 hands are unspeakably evil|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that perhaps it was west who bid 2@D|pg||
nt|barnets: the @HQ and spase ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i missed that in first scan :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|3S!|an|5+!s, 5+!d|nt|athene: west who bid 2@C, sorry|pg||
nt|athene: will he thank his partner for the dummy in 2@SX? that is a sterner test of partnership harmony|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the best u will attain with 3@S is to go -100 in 3@S two off vs -130 defending clubs|pg||
nt|athene: to gain 1 imp|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|yorkbeach:  yes but love all is a good time for competing the partscore|pg||
nt|athene: and decided to pass 2@D before the opponents woke up and brought out the axe|pg||
nt|othered1: does 2N feel conservative to you?|pg||
nt|athene: this is all sort of surreal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i seem to recall a pair [sweden or netherlands] that play the DBL as (43) Majors  that would fit Multon's actions|pg||
nt|henryb:  can he hold it to down 2 for a push?|pg||
nt|oleberg: North intended to bid 2@H, but West beat him to it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: berkowitz hopes his 2@h call at least served to ward off a heart lead|pg||
nt|joest: and it did|pg||
nt|kit: LC says natural, so will lead spade|pg||
nt|kit: and match is very close again with 2 more boards -- and 63 won't be dull|pg||
nt|pelu: N prob told E: both majors, and S to W: just TO - could be balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I think someone is trying to tell me that East should pass 1@sx, but they're telling me in Danish so I'm not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: shows the values for 3@S in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the worst - well let's not think about it|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has had too much red meat|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure I would call it a lapse.. VERY difficult to bid|pg||
nt|barnets: so 6@H made|pg||
nt|barnets: and maybe that is the best line|pg||
nt|barnets: thats why he is such a great player|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: survived here|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all know it shows @ds because we see his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dan to the rescue -- specifically 5+5+|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|athene: quite a lot of these tricky guessy modern auctions work on the "assumed fit" principle - people assume their opps know what they are doing, and hence actually have a fit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yorkbeach:  we will find out in a minute I hope if the bidding is wrong|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|swanson: This hand is a demostration of how difficult it is to 'settle' for minor suit games when 3NT is a possibility.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|joest: it's easier at imps b/c you don't get punished for being in five of a minor instead of 3NT if they bothmake|pg||
nt|joest: in a bidding contest, 5@c is the top spot here|pg||
nt|bagman: nicely landed; 5@D goes down because of the 5-2 spade break|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: so they just find another suit and bid that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Only one thing to do, Dan, learn Danish|pg||
nt|athene: he ought to know it already? :)|pg||
nt|oleberg: Eat Danish|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: 2@C does seems strange from south|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we have confirmation that the bidding is correct|pg||
nt|joest: mildly yes but it's white|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|barnets: 3n did finally go down 1|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, but I would prefer to be in 5 than 4. Barely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room in       1@S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|barnets: so was a flat board|pg||
pc|d3|nt|loe48: not really, flat hand |pg||
pc|d2|nt|bessi2: the bidding progressed in the same manner in the open room until that 4@c bid where proojinen bid 4@h, probably because their 1@h opening is often only 4 cards I beliee|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT might make or might go down...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I'm betting for one of the two|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: but those are the only possibilities|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|barnets: he would only go down if west would give his partner a club ruff|pg||
nt|bagman: 7 tricks ready and then needs 2 spades (easy) without losing 4 other tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|loe48: i think 2nt is okay|pg||
nt|joest: must have gone down 1|pg||
nt|joest: 2|pg||
nt|joest: b/c it is scored as a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: such an unexpected result that it crashed the room|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: hmm north cant believe south has 4 card support and passed over 2@S|pg||
nt|joest: there was a crash of the table in the other room I understand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: well east could see the 5-2 fit might be ok if his pd has two spades and a doubleton heart honour|pg||
nt|athene: if they play std count south has to have four? wouldn't raise on two would he|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2 BDS LEFT AND SCHEDULED RESTART IS IN 15 MINS|pg||
nt|roswolf: any problem bruce?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Kranyak left table gone for more red meat:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: back|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  both sides were applying the principle that nobody is vulnerable you should bid... because if you go down you go dwon in 50s|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  when nobody is vulnerable|pg||
nt|joest: so there is no score period|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: assuming undoubled|pg||
nt|joest: at least in cyberspace there isn't|pg||
nt|joest: so if it was down one it will be 3 imps for cayne and they now trail by one|pg||
nt|barnets: yes so it is|pg||
nt|joest: so low spade here is the only chance for Sementa to go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: hard to imagine that he will|pg||

nt|roswolf: very competitive in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S is not such a bad contract for NS, is it?|pg||
nt|athene: especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is decent... 2 finesses, not to mention the very live possibility of a @d lead from the K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: see previous remarks about 1@S|pg||
mb|2C!|an|gf, either !c, bal, or support|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, @C or BAL or @S support |pg||
nt|bagman: in 3NT one might win the first club hoping for club blockage (1 down) or duck one and then go up on the heart switch (makes)|pg||
nt|bagman: so hard to say if it makes or not single dummy|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: yes, diamond lead from the king is quite possible|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You only have to wait 2 hours|pg||
nt|athene: sementa had to pass in the other room because 2@C overcall would have been 5-4 majors?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And you can't even be certain that they will continue with this match|pg||
nt|athene: there is no end to the indignities the club suit has to endure these days :(|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  another solid looking result for Cayne in the OR|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: good 6@H contract here, reached in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  are they as slow having dinner as they are playing?|pg||
nt|athene: now east might cue to get to 4 of a major|pg||
nt|joest: tough rebid coming for East|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: Danger is getting too high -- they will certainly be in the slam|pg||
nt|wygbe1: seems they should reach it after this start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 12-14 NT in 4th seat  --  i must admit i never understood that|pg||
nt|athene: that's fairly logical? you know no-one has a big hand so it's safe|pg||
nt|athene: and quite pre-emptive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially when system opens everything in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: a good hand for 'serious 3NT"|pg||
nt|roswolf: well depending on the style of vul weak 2's i think 4@S is automatic here|pg||
nt|bessi2: I would just bid 4@s directly with the north hand.. |pg||
nt|roswolf: so would i|pg||
nt|othered1: vulnerability keeps north from a light t-o double|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Of course, 7@H can make -- and maybe it would out of desparation|pg||
nt|joest: playing that Boyd must cue bid a diamond control no matter how bad his hand|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n bids blackwood, will find out no diam king|pg||
nt|kit: 4@D is not a diamond control -- it is a last train sort of bid|pg||
nt|athene: the trouble with passing now is, what do you do when south bids 4@C?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe seamon is intending to double and defend|pg||
nt|athene: in view of his singleton diamond, and the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: An improbable spade lead would make 6@H difficult for declarer.|pg||
nt|athene: this won't work out well|pg||
nt|athene: now the @SK gets exposed|pg||
nt|barnets: west has a heart stopper in nt|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: when versace can't overruff|pg||
nt|bessi2: lol.. versace will drop his pd's K of @s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: 4@S is RKC|pg||
nt|joest: ic|pg||
nt|athene: wow, hasn't cayne just bid his hand a lot of times?|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c looks to be a transfer to 2@d with some invitational hand usually|pg||
pc|d7|nt|joest: not showing the void|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6@c + 1@d + 1 ruff = 800 in 4@c doubled if my counting is right|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he assumes from the NS bidding that his partner has a fit somewhere and some values|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure this will be dbled|pg||
nt|athene: but can't his partner bid his own hand?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  crazy to bid 5@h on a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|joest: so this is a straightforward diamond invite|pg||
nt|henryb:  now there is a lead I would not have found|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: :(|pg||
nt|barnets: the 6 spot is good|pg||
nt|joest: KJ of diamonds too good to pass up |pg||
pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  I wonder whether Larry Cohen is watching. |pg||
nt|athene: did declarer really have to rise the king there?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room 4@S south|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: of course declarer might just throw his diamond loser on the third club|pg||
nt|athene: and play for both kings onside|pg||
nt|barnets: lauria thinks of possible def|pg||
nt|barnets: but there is no real hope|pg||
nt|barnets: the next board will be the last |pg||
nt|barnets: so Congrats to the Cayne team |pg||
nt|barnets: very well played|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks dan for your excellent job and helpfull commentary|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: if clubs continued declarer might well divine the trump position|pg||
nt|athene: cayne bids his hand AGAIN|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Who said the 5-level belongs to the opponents? Ed Manfield and Ron Klinger, and they were absolutely right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  A 9-card fit one way and a 8-card fit the other does not saye both sides |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should be bidding at the five level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  say|pg||
nt|athene: it's not as though the hearts are wide open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this seems like lucky make to me|pg||
nt|bagman: Here N has a surprise entry; the defense has only 4 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: but the failure to play the third club is itself suspicious|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so let's say double of 3@D just showed good diamonds, fine|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wygbe1: well done|pg||
nt|joest: a trump start seems best|pg||
nt|wygbe1: diam lead will probly speed up the play|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|joest: declarer will not relish hooking the diamond into south and seeing aheart back|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he just wants to get this set over with and get his dinner|pg||
nt|henryb:  A King has risen in the West|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: best lead -- now declarer has problems|pg||
nt|kit: far from clear how this hand should be played|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson has to make it now to keep the lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer counts 5 hearts, 1 spade, 2 clubs, 2 diamonds - needs another two tricks.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: of course, west can also NOT overruff the third club with @SKxx, as a nice grosvenor|pg||
nt|athene: now 4@C says "i have 4-4-6-0 and a great hand"|pg||
nt|loe48: he will hood dia now|pg||
nt|bagman: 4th best would have worked better |pg||
nt|ahollan1: please but don't ask me how to get to 5@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bessi2: now he can play the club throw the diamond and be sure |pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: now obvious:)|pg||
nt|athene: now if declarer hooks hearts first|pg||
nt|athene: he might decide that west would have bid with all he has AND the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: like a 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: fine|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: so where did he find 5@H?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  has anyone worked out how many IMPs West's 5@h has blown?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 14 or 15|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  was 800 on offer in 5@c X?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  I want to get this set over with, don't you|pg||
pc|s4|nt|swanson: Maybe ruff a club and lead a low diamond?|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, it's all a bit irrelevant in 3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bessi2: still worth 2 imps for Schwartz|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|loe48: yes its normal safe play to protect hearts trough|pg||
nt|bagman: Having cashed 2 diamonds, E plays a spade hoping to keep N out|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might get out for -1 and hold the loss to 2 IMPs but a big missed opportunity|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  needs to play a diamond|pg||
nt|stc: on @d N discards @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pitching @S????|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: but many interestting hands henry?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're only 5 minutes past scheduled restart time  and board 16 shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: at other table, won heart, club ruff, drew trumps, diamond finesse.  Now spade back would have beaten them, but wasn't found|pg||
nt|kit: Play is going same way here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joest: looks like the match might well be in Berkowitz's hands in  just a few seconds|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

nt|roswolf: is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators William, David and Sigurdbjorn for their company and perceptive comments. Also to our specs whose ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it would seem he did|pg||
nt|Walddk4: he did Bruce says|pg||
nt|joest: thanks Dan, great job as operator btw|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks to jan Martel and ACBL for putting this wonderful show on for everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's not a good board for DK|pg||
nt|athene: Bjarnson would be happy to i think|pg||
nt|athene: Bjarnarson sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 15+ bal|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S a bit of a funny bid |pg||
nt|pelu: just like the time when we had US-trials|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT makes on a diamond lead, though, and HH were on their way|pg||
nt|henryb:  Segment 2, fo those who are curious, started 5 minutes ago|pg||
nt|oleberg: 3@S was probably lead-directing, and North wasn't in on the joke.|pg||
nt|bagman: not any more; spade pitch tells to cash the @HA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess @C established so didn't matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can this really be final board of the half???|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: and that looks to be it|pg||
nt|athene: if partner shows long diamonds, do you really go out of your way to introduce five spades on a weak hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks to all dedicated specs who stuck with us thru all of the room crashes|pg||
nt|bagman: E had planned to play a spade; W's spade discard told that no hope there so E cashed the @HA to prevent an overtrick|pg||
mb|2S!|an|10-13, natural|nt|joest: a great hand to end a great match on|pg||
nt|athene: sorry as a spec points out, even with the @SK west would not have a 2nt overcall but he might have a double|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: scheduled restart in 10 mins from now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Slip of the mind. Kranyak had it a certain 1 down |pg||
nt|barnets: along with BBO for making it all possinle|pg||
nt|barnets: possible|pg||
nt|barnets: and thanks to all the specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: for their comments|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H probably sets up game force|pg||
nt|oleberg: It does.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  with 25 HCP and an 8-card @s fit NS should reach 4@s ... but stranger things have happened this set|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@S by Schaltz was a good bid if only partner had not taken him seriously|pg||
nt|henryb:  You want to introduce @s so partner leads them and not his anemis @d suit against 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=10-13, 5+@S unbal, NOT @S & @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room 2@D north|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barnets: look in tomorrow for the qurter finals|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yorkbeach:  like this 2@c overcall|pg||
nt|athene: north can't act over 2@C really|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a fan of the 2@C bid because it is just so likely to pre-empt your side out of spades or notrumps|pg||
nt|joest: this particular sequence is a dangerous one for standard pairs b/c it is easy to lose a 44 spade fit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: weirdly, it can work out better to overcall very heavy at the 1-level as it's less likely to end things|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  indeed - prefer X or 1NT|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: when the @H8 falls first round declarer has a guess which way to play for 4-1 trumps - he can pick either up|pg||
nt|athene: i guess it's possible if a bit aggressive|pg||
nt|bagman: I would be a bit afraid after hearing 3 passes with the N hand; in fact NS can make something in clubs (like 12 tricks)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: even rolling this would not be good enough so congratulations to the Spector team|pg||
nt|joest: and thanks to all the players for a great match|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: e.g. after a 1@C opener you can overcall 1@D on almost anything as it never gets passed out|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  rattled perhaps by the previous board?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: thanks operator|pg||
nt|ady: another swing for Cayne|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As Michael Rosenberg points out, 3@S was a good bid regardless when opps were going to reach 3NT anyway|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bessi2: good result for Schwartz in the open room.. 4@h seems like a very fragile contract|pg||
nt|athene: that is why the 8 is an obligatory falsecard from 108xx|pg||
nt|joest: Many players play suit preference here when partner is known to be leading shorntess|pg||
nt|barnets: spade is best now|pg||
nt|joest: that doesn't seem consistent with Sementa's 7 play though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Welland leads Nickell by 11    our match has widest spread|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-16/978-2011-spingold-quarter-final|pg||
nt|athene: tricky decision for west; play for 6-1 spades is the only way to try to make?|pg||
nt|athene: you have to play for the @CA with north for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could somebody please call room service for me?|pg||
nt|athene: if you duck, a diamond back is killing you definitely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If this is slow, let me remind you that we haven't even seen Fantoni yet. He will be playing in the second quarter|pg||
nt|athene: south might possibly have @DJx i suppose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the pause sure seems to tell Multon @S9 in North  [hope that hasn't already been mentioned]|pg||
nt|oleberg: If another match catches a whole set on them, maybe both these teams should be knocked out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd/4th leads  always look strange to me   probably because i've never had a chance to play them|pg||
nt|hedyg: how do you propose to find a @c contract?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd half scheduled to begin in 90 minutes  1.5 hours|pg||
nt|bagman: have wire|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 AM CET :(|pg||
nt|bagman: North hand is a player with 3 first round controls and good shape; opening it with a preemptish bid looks risky|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: not sure what the difference is between this and a simple 4@H from east over 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@C asks if versace has a good hand, 2@D says "no" so lauria settles for game|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe he knew|pg||
nt|barnets: now def can make a spade nd a second heart|pg||
nt|barnets: dont need any ruffs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yorkbeach:  I have a simple rule that if the hand is too strong for a 1NT overcall, it is too strong for a suit overcall|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: lauria has played with versace for 20 years and versace has never had extras, but lauria is hopeful there will be a first time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The other match is about to restart. They don't play the same boards, so there is not a security issue|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: we have a director's ruling of 4@s making 5 on board 11|pg||
nt|athene: now north worried that declarer has @DKQ2 left? if he has that is just too bad surely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks for the update Dan!!|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so the 5@D bid not allowed|pg||
nt|oleberg: The ruling seems reasonable, even when routing for Denmark|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 3 match scores posted:  Iceland [original  21] leads Fleisher by 38    Welland over Nickel by 32  Cayne over Lynch by 26|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|joest: thanks also to Kit, John and Jim|pg||
nt|barnets: unless endplay comes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|barnets: which it will|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzfg: sry too fast N a little upset!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What do you bid over 2@D if you double?|pg||
nt|ady: OR  same opening 1@H   but double from south|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: S I mean|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yorkbeach:  3@c I guess|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  having a night off tomorrow - will see some of you on Saturday no doubt|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bessi2: kranyak will surely play a spade now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: commentator's curse|pg||
nt|athene: another obligatory falsecard to give a guess:- south drops the 8 from @HA108x there when declarer leads to the king|pg||
nt|bessi2: hmm... don't see why he wanted to open up either minor|pg||
nt|bessi2: why he would want to that is|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bessi2: A spec suggests that Kranyak may have interpreted his pd's 3 of @s as suit preferance|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bessi2: preference|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: so all 3   4-person teams are leading|pg||
pg||
