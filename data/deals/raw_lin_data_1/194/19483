nt|veistikke:  maybe they find 3!n here|pg||
nt|sveing: 3NS pretty normal contract|pg||
nt|geot: Yes, N will show a 12-14, and if S invites they should get there|pg||
nt|geot: or, I mean 1@D - 2@D inverted.....|pg||
nt|sveing: yes and probebly would East lead|pg||
nt|geot: it depends a bit on system agreements|pg||
nt|sveing: 1@D-2@D-2NT-3NT or?|pg||
nt|geot: I kinda like 1@D - 2NT though, South has NT values all over the place |pg||

nt|geot: No, he will not open 1NT. He will consider it:)|pg||

nt|loe48: what nt range do they have N-S?|pg||

nt|andersk: is it possible?|pg||
nt|loe48: if they had 14 i think we would see 1nt|pg||

nt|sveing: mostly pairs will be in 4@S i think. but now i think he will make it|pg||
