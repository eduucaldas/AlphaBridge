nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|kareno: Good day from Las Vegas :)|pg||
nt|chick: Welcome everyone :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello from Italy :)|pg||
nt|psyck: "Sementa"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Yes, the name is Antonio Sementa|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W play a system very similar at Lauria-Versace|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: thanks Joe, we will remember that and 1 IMP could make a difference|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|psyck: The strong @c system may not work too well here allowing opps to possibly find a @d sacrifice|pg||
nt|kareno: I had the pleasure of losing to Versace and Lauria in a KO match earlier this week :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: N will be happy to hear 2@s by S|pg||
nt|kareno: The next KO fortunately we won so I can still show my face around here.  It was this exact team that defeated us.|pg||
nt|kareno: Did I say hello from Vegas?  I'm still in Toronto watching baseball games :)|pg||
nt|psyck: South has maximum for the earlier pass, no wastage in opps suit, & shape|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i hate the first pass... clearly worth a double|pg||
nt|bigtrain: now impossible to catch up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, assuming double was 5-7, it was certainly possible on 2@d|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree - now she hasn't got a good bid but 2@s will do.|pg||
nt|psyck: double or 2@H?|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: depending on agreement|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfc: Quinn:  you better play the spots off of this one|pg||
nt|rv: technically West invites and East accepts with max|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: giving a medium hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chick: staggering their way to the right place|pg||
nt|xenya: double possible as S's hand is limited by his 1st bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: West never showed his diamond fit - |pg||
nt|ady: 1 imp to Cayne|pg||
nt|psyck: I guess W felt he had too much in def to bid more|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Ho Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Giorgio :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rv: this could make if declarer takes a @h hook, plays for @hs 3-3 and @CA rite|pg||
nt|xenya: NS play Polish Club|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D is safe contract|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tarekr:  Exactly but Shawn is not taking any chances to miss game even though it is a non-vul one|pg||
nt|ady: meantime 5@D  only down 1|pg||
nt|xenya: where all strong hands are opened 1@C|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: the 2@d could be a wide ranging hand too i guess|pg||
nt|kareno: I would hope south would take the push to 5@s.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, @d more comfortable to play than @s's here I guess|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|rv: Mildred is well on way to 9 tricks here if she plays a @c to K|pg||
nt|xenya: also many weak ones|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bridge_one: probably make 10 tricks because must cuess A second in @C|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c4|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|rv: playing a @d off table also works as cards are|pg||
nt|tarekr:  nice @d|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|psyck: good, & we have Giorgio to help us out with EW's system which he says is similar to Lauria-Versace|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|d8|nt|bridge_one: play exatly the same Krisma :)|pg||

nt|stc: as noticed "chances" was an understatement, overtricks|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|bessi2: avoiding a @s lead possible as declarer will often hold @s length when balancing there|pg||

nt|rv: if East doesn't open, will you open 1@d or 1n with North hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: the director was here getting the auction from a board in the last set, where there was some sort of appeal in the other room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Sementa and Duboin started to play togheter few years ago, so they at Versace the system|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: there are only few change, depending on style to play, but 88% is equal|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  when I am short oM, i generally will bid a good 4 cd major in 3rd or 4th seat|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: 98%|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: 6@C possible  but likely to play in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is limited at 9 hcp exclude 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: double?|pg||
nt|xenya: must be a specialised bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by North is aggressive in vuln|pg||
nt|psyck: even playing equal level conversion, it would not occur to me at this vul|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl give @H + a minor|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with sgl @s North think the partner can have @s and points, so he must bid anything|pg||
nt|xenya: if it shows the reds, S is not pleased|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tarekr:  shows 3 cd support|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: S clearly expected more|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now depending on agreement - i suppose 2Nt was convetional for N/S in this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|psyck: no more tricks than the 5@d, & 2 aces in sight|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3N need a present by defence|pg||
nt|xenya: good defence will obviously beat this|pg||
nt|chick: clubs could be set up, but I think defense will get their major suits first|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, should set it 1 or 2 w/o much difficulty i think|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: some wastage in diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: each bidding their weakness|pg||
nt|kareno: This looks like some sort of relay auction.  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s 2@H 1@C are ON for defence in all case|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but can make more tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: anything from 11 to 13 tricks in clubs |pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: some might not show supp double with sub-min hand (11 hcp with Mildred)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: same auction in the other room to 3NT on 49, and they made an overtrick|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told 2@h was a gf|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|kareno: Club slam requires picking up the suit.  Stiff king in either hand twice as likely as stiff jack in north.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tarekr:  I bet it is not going to be the same auction in other room on this hand|pg||
nt|rv: @s back could be best here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|chick: a stiff king in either hand doesn't guarantee picking up the suit|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|c6|nt|chick: so still same odds overall|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rv: here both Mildred and Quinn could have shown restraint in second round of bidding, case for both to pass|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: If you can get two round of clubs in safely then spades might break.  I'm not sure how I would play this in six.  |pg||
nt|psyck: picking up @c's is hardly 6%|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kareno: Lauria is a fine declarer... let's watch!  Heart lead best for the defense.|pg||
nt|psyck: a very poor slam, and both Q 1st & A 1st are equal odds|pg||
nt|psyck: it is just a question of J single with N or K single with S..about 6% on a @h lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: you have to add Jxx offside with xxx+ in spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Lauria is declarer.  Lynch on lead.  Without a spade lead it is easier but club suit still an issue.  Then spades a problem.|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, still say calling it 10% doesn't make it sound so good either :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Sorry, without a HEART lead |pg||
nt|bigtrain: so makeable if singleton K in S by picking up trump OR singleton K in N if S has xxx+ in spades|pg||
nt|kareno: No but remember the Italians winning a world championship because Kx of spades was in the pocket.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however this result is the risk to overcall with light hand|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kareno: Right it was clubs. |pg||
nt|kareno: Okay good lead.|pg||
nt|psyck: now all up to his table feel :)|pg||
nt|psyck: we are lucky to get an exciting start anyway :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: 4@H now|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|chick: my worst bridge nightmare, a two way guess for a slam|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bigtrain: he clearly chose the % line|pg||
nt|chick: I average about 7% getting it right |pg||
nt|ady: 11 imps to Lynch|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, A is better as you mentioned due to additional @s chances|pg||
nt|kareno: This was a total guess except that he knew two cards in south's hand, KQ.  That could have swayed him.|pg||
nt|kareno: King singleton either hand gives him a chance for the hand.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|psyck: yes, more normal to wait for pd to balance aggresively than entering before opps limit hand, at least at this vul|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rv: 3 down|pg||
nt|xenya: hardly an achievement by NS, this one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the line played by south is a little strange, because if East hold Q@C then can find one trick - probably better continue  with Q @H for KJ @S in east|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h3|nt|tarekr:  2 more tricks for W|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|kareno: He needed four spades in the south hand on his assumption she had Kxx in clubs.  |pg||
nt|kareno: So therefore the spade finesse - if she has four spades, then it is a better than even money finesse.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|h7|pg||
mc|8|nt|rv: based on last deals, looks like both Mildred and Quinn bid spots of their cards as Joe suggested|pg||

nt|ady: 20-20  here    partial  8 tricks in clubs|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: e/w  have a heart contract|pg||
nt|stc: EW with play in @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bessi2: a clear protective dbl there in my opinion|pg||
nt|stc: 8 or 9 @h tricks for EW |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bessi2: 2@c can be defeated, but unlikely defense|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||

nt|kareno: This IS Carolyn Lynch, isn't it?  Not Peter Lynch?|pg||
nt|kareno: Once the club ace drew the jack, that was the preferred line of play|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@c is limited as !@c is available with stronger hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 3@d requires right @d guess here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C polish, so 10/15 5+ cards in @C|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|rv: plenty of wastage in rounded suits for E-W, after South's entry into auction, Quinn should get @ds right|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|kareno: South fell in love with her hand.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many write me 2@C 11/14 - OK, but the concept is similar :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: Cronier could have doubled 2@d to show @hs and @c tolerance (snapdragon double) which would have allowed Willard to compete in @hs|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|tarekr:  Very good point Venky|pg||
nt|rv: maybe too ambitious opposite a passed partner who bid 2@c at these colors, reasonable auction all around|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
mc|8|nt|psyck: after 2N, S's hand becomes worse, but some would open 4@s anyway 1st time |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C in napolitan, blueteam, precision and polisch are very similar|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks in clubs for e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tarekr:  it seemed sh could have pulled trumps before playing @s. Of course had to find Q@d|pg||
nt|ady: maybe only 9|pg||
nt|xenya: routine 3N here -- probably doomed|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psyck: surely S was worth another bid|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, unfortunate lie of @c's|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rv: 6@h good slam|pg||
nt|psyck: knows won't win it at 1 level|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: I think a 2@S bid is clear, if only to prevent 2@C|pg||
nt|kareno: In particular to keep e/w out of clubs.  |pg||
nt|psyck: with those good @s's, i prefer 2@s to 2@d rebid|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rv: it needs correct handling from West hand on @c lead|pg||
nt|kareno: I do too, Krishna|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but Balicki will play for all chances ! here the chance is a mistake by opps|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|psyck: they do not have communication for @d, but dec has no sourse of tricks either|pg||
nt|xenya: 8 tricks and no sign of a 9th|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A @d at first trick and @D would give the chance of a error by East|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psyck: a @h switch sometime will defeat this|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rv: if North leads a @c, declarer should draw trumps, pitch dummy's @c on @s and take ruffing finesse in @cs or guess @d for @c pitch|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not, it was the same, having the 8 in @D|pg||
nt|xenya: i can see 2 clubs, 1 diamond, 2 hearts and 3 spades for declarer -- and no endplay on the horizon|pg||
pc|hT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|rv: 6@H lot better from East hand since declarer can first guess @ds before postponing @c play|pg||
nt|psyck: may not be easy to defend though|pg||
nt|kareno: The defense needs to tap dummy.  If east gets his diamond ruff it will be an easy hand for north.  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W carding is inverted count, small encourage|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: Balicki would probably make it if i were defending, but not against these opponents|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rv: all of this discussion is academic since @hs break 4-1 here|pg||
nt|psyck: they needed to set up @h trick before @d ruff|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed.|pg||
nt|psyck: W having passed 1st time & N having bid @h, it was tough|pg||
nt|kit: seems pretty clear to return a heart and put it to declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe @hT was reverse suit preference|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the question is that any return is Ok for the defence :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: except @C, of course|pg||

mb|3D|nt|bridge_one: 5@D 2(3) down |pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: I think 2nt is a limit raise perhaps with 4 spades.|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Dbl by East means a H in @D |pg||

mb|5D|nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 7 cards and weak hand 5@D is automathics|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: after Quinn's 4@d, maybe Mildred should have taken push|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: 5@d would be excellent especially if West had @h length instead of @cs, even now only 2 down|pg||
nt|tarekr:  she thinks she can beat 4@s that's why she passed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: 2@d instead of 3 like other table seems to have worked better here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West can stabilise a @C|pg||
nt|kit: he will have to lose a second spade trick unless something strange happens, so down 3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: try ruffing finesse|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|psyck: I'm guessing Lauria would have opened 4@s with S's hand deal 3 :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Sorry, with only 3 spades.  New keyboard messing me up here in Toronto.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i agree with 2@D with bad suit|pg||
nt|chick: 3@H by N would have made it much harder for E to show diamond tolerance|pg||
nt|bridge_one: overall they are also a passed p|pg||
nt|psyck: @s suit is frozen, so may well escape for -2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct krishna|pg||
nt|kit: why will defense ever be forced to break spades?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|rv: in my view at IMPs, Mildred should take insurance at these colors|pg||

pc|d2|nt|kareno: Yes, straight finesse too risky - could lose diamond, 2 hearts and a club.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|h3|pg||

nt|tarekr:  Remote possibility I should say :)|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|bridge_one: 3 down is ok, so to use A@H to make the finesse in @S is a risk to go 4 down|pg||

nt|stc: to take 4 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: dummy has almost surely 5@s, yes|pg||
nt|ritong: question is which @d|pg||
nt|bessi2: I wonder what line Cayne will take on a @d lead.. looks straightforward to take the king and play the Q of spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: she had J@D out, put it back|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: roughly, it is good to lead top @d when pard has 3+ and low if he has 2|pg||
nt|ritong: very roughly|pg||
nt|ritong: but the general idea is that, i believe|pg||
nt|stc: CR MS overbid to 3NT on the 3@c hand and lost some iMP|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|psyck: will likely pass i suppose|pg||
nt|kareno: Not a great suit but north wants to get into the auction in case west has only four hearts.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h is natural, hearts, for the specs asking.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, at this vul, worth getting into auction by N with good shape|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: pretty ratty heart suit for this bid, even over something like Qxxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ady: this looks a misunderstanding|pg||

nt|psyck: I suppose S was did not take it as Natural & N passed assuming misunderstanding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C polish, so 15/18|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rv: coffee deal here|pg||
nt|tarekr:  How about a Tea Party deal here:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead by Versace.|pg||
nt|psyck: there are several bids like 2@d, 1NT, Double to show other suits, so it is common to play 2@h as natural as the 1@h could come with weak hands & you are sitting above the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Tarek, same deals played in Spingold and Wagar?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no|pg||
nt|kit: so they have to open 2@C with 5+ clubs or lose the suit?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is forcing (after 1@S 7+)|pg||
nt|psyck: both 1@c & 2@c can have @c suits|pg||
nt|psyck: just that 2@c is limited, like prec|pg||
nt|kit: I mean with minimal opening|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many told me that 2@C is forcing in polish club - i amn't sure about this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s limited (of course) but dont means weak like in natural !|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like it is forcing, otherwise it would be pretty risky on that big a hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@h is very conservative by Sementa|pg||

pc|c6|nt|psyck: best even, or should i say beastial lead|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt not the best contract either.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 5@c is comfy, but normal to end in 3N|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@s to show a stopper I guess here. |pg||
nt|psyck: they may just not see enough values or shape to be in 5 level & with a different arrangement of cards 3N may be superior|pg||
nt|chick: Will N figure that one is enough?|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, S needs to be declarer in NT to protect that K, so perhaps best to just bid it now|pg||
nt|kareno: Kt9 doesn't need much  protection.|pg||
nt|chick: (if she's going to try for it)|pg||
nt|kareno: Zmudzinski led the A of @h in the OR against 3nt - definitely NOT best.|pg||
nt|chick: It could happen here too, if she shows a spade stopper|pg||

nt|chick: a couple of kibs are pointing out that there is a squeeze for 7C as well|pg||
nt|kareno: Right you are.  See you all later - have to run!!  Thanks to all :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tarekr:  if in 3 naturally in 5 LOL|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, the @sT is a nice card to have in 7N|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|ritong: you get the drift|pg||
nt|chick: first they have to get past the 5 level :)|pg||
nt|xenya: on the @SQ lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good lead - many lead 5@S with that figure|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: yes, danger defense gets 2 spades 1 club, 1 diamond, 1 heart before declarer has 9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rv: Henri likes dramatic effect as you would expect an artisitic frenchman:)|pg||
nt|chick: moot now :(|pg||
nt|xenya: very good, yes|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: why thank you:)|pg||
nt|tarekr:  We must not forget Deas-Palmer|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|kit: now jack of spades continuation is winner, but is it so obvious?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: having A 10  and A J out correct the lead with Q|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: North has to win this and play a spade I believe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@D @S beat|pg||
nt|xenya: should be obvious after S's @S7 -- middle card from 3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: N knows S has the 9|pg||
nt|kit: Accurate defense no play now I don't believe|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer had won the first spade and gone after the red aces, the spade suit would have been blocked.  Should he have found that?|pg||
nt|xenya: also, as a few kibitzers have pointed out to me, declarer would have never ducked 1st spade wth AK9  |pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps he should "find it" as the best chance to make|pg||
nt|kit: But defense can counter I believe -- South unblocking 7 and 9 of spades|pg||
nt|kit: Well, maybe not -- then declarer ducks second spade|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s9|nt|rv: this is tricky hand to play, crucial @d9 might bail out declarer here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ritong: and some other american associations, yes  plus d ovidio and her part|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|rv: best defense was @s back here|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|tarekr:  I think there are at least ten outstanding women's pairs in the world. Hard to rank them|pg||
nt|ritong: right|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c4|pc|s6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|rv: she could have postponed second @d since partner is unlikely to cash more than 2 tricks and doesn't have an entry to set-up and enjoy|pg||
nt|ritong: also, any sport is also a matter of form|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d6|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|xenya: in the OR, N also led @SQ, but then fell out of grace by continuing with a small one|pg||

nt|rv: based on scores in last 3 brds, can't see too much opportunity for trailing team to recover IMPs|pg||
nt|chick: That hand has potential for a big swing|pg||
nt|psyck: kibs point out there cards wrong for squeeze|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tarekr:  2 more folks! We witnessed a certainly enjoyable contest!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|rv: Joe, as per correct scores,Wesheimer trailing only by 16 rite?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no 18|pg||
nt|rv: 1 less?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  143-125|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfc: right|pg||
nt|ritong: not an everyday's auction|pg||
nt|rv: ok, this could end contest|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Westheimer has 1 fewer IMP than we are showing|pg||
nt|chick: yes, some pointed that out to me as well, the entries were not good enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: entries would be fine on a minor suit lead though|pg||
nt|kit: Many pairs play this 2@H call as natural.  Either could work on any hand, but you better have solid agreements.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|ritong: mrs breed might get disappointed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Quinn says "it's a first time auction for me, too"|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Mildred could have checked for aces though it is best not to comment about Quinn's pre-empt |pg||
nt|ritong: well..|pg||
nt|ritong:  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Mildredwas hoping for the spade ace, obviously|pg||
nt|psyck: still, NS can be happy that they only missed 7@d not 7N|pg||
nt|psyck: there was a confusion last set on this seq|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@H i suppose inviting in @S|pg||
nt|kit: If there is confusion here, E-W will be getting a very bad result in 3@H doubled|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: There are plenty of other bids to show the other two suits, a cue is not needed, so it only makes sense to keep it natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: pass by sementa instead 3@S becames GF|pg||
nt|bridge_one: mixed hand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|psyck: on non @s or @h lead, there would have been a criss cross squeeze for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: well, the OR stopped in 5@D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: stronger would bid a cue |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: thanks to the commentators and to the specs; join us again in 2 and 3/4 hours (on the hour) -- *8PM in Toronto|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: spade part score e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: could get too high|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|d|an|3 hearts|mb|3C|nt|stc: now @s a bit hidden|pg||
nt|ady: support double showing 3 hearts   but spades now not bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: that hand is much more like a support (re)double|pg||
nt|bobholl: and will not i guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: other room way slower; now playing 26|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|stc: could be a double part score swing for Cayne|pg||
nt|bessi2: good aggressive overcall by Seamon... |pg||
nt|stc: normal at this vuln|pg||
nt|bessi2: normal for you and me perhaps,  but not for all|pg||
nt|ritong: basically, east will act over 3@c in the other room, if the auction is duplicated, which is very likely|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||

nt|rv: incidentally on @SA and back for ruff and @d shift beats 4@h|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|psyck: Last deal, thanks all, see you in about 20 mins foe next set.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|rv: that could be only consolation for Westheimer though it might be too little too late for second seeds here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chick: This is the last board of this set, the remaining two sets will be played tonight|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks all|pg||
nt|kit: I'm really surprised by West's pass over 2@C with a singleton club and some other good features.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now dbl by east i suppose (opener can have 4@S)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: west would nid 2@H woth a top honor in @H - with xxx vuln pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: can't see a way back for Westheimer|pg||
nt|kit: Now he has to guess at the 3-level|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by sementa conservative|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@d now is a risk - probably pass by West|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: what else can he do?  No reason to expect to make 3 of anything, king of clubs bad, etc.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Mildred congratulates the French ladies and says they played well.  |pg||
nt|bridge_one:  ip refere 3D at dbl with 5 good @D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rv: I suspect German ladies will play in 4@h in CR on last deal and defense of @s ruff followed by @d shift unlikely to be found|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tarekr:  I think they are going to sing the Marseillaise in the french bridge lands.|pg||
nt|xenya: good heavens|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|kit: So Duboin had choice of defending 3@C or playing 4@S.  Something seems wrong here.|pg||
nt|psyck: E forgot that W did not x 2@c|pg||
nt|xenya: can be made on this lead|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|rv: yes, French pair played at a very high level|pg||
nt|kit: Can this make?  5 spades, 1 heart, 1 club, 3 diamonds?  Doesn't seem likely without knowing about the diamond layout.|pg||
nt|chick: falsecard by Sementa may cause a bit of problem|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this time i understood nothing about the pass by East|pg||
nt|kit: What could East have sensibly bid?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 10 points and 4@s dbl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: without dbl i, in west, i would reopen 3@D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: assuming the same contract at the other table, we end the first quarter today essentially tied|pg||
nt|chick: many would play a double of 2@C as showing spades|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|chick: Two very strong teams, fun to watch|pg||
nt|chick: apparently he wasn't able to do that|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right, can't use dbl to give 4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl at 2@C means strong hand|pg||
nt|psyck: well, most play is as supp x, but for this pair is would show @s with better than min hand|pg||
nt|kit: I guess he can take the needed tricks -- ace of diamonds, diamond ruff, etc.  5 trumps, 3 diamonds, 1 club, 1 heart.|pg||
nt|psyck: so 4@s was punishing pd's balance, may get lucky though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no - i think sementa decide to play 3@C with balanced hand at the partner|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West could reopen only with unblanced hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is the reason of pass at 3 @C and after 4@s|pg||
nt|kit: yes, he could work out West's shape for sure|pg||
nt|xenya: so the whole thing was not as crazy as it looked, after all|pg||
nt|kit: But you would think South should have also worked it out and not led the ace of clubs.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the reasoning of sementa is: if i don't have game i play 3@C - if my p is unbalanced with 4@S he must reopen - so better pass that dbl at 3@C, becasue with dbl i can''t know if my ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: p have 11 balanced or 14 unbalaced|pg||
nt|xenya: cute|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rv: big thanks to excellent Vugraph operator Joe and my wonderful co-commentators Henri and Tarek|pg||
nt|xenya: wide choice of plays for B here|pg||
