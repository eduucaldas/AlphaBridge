mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: good decision to pass. Turning +50 into +100 isn't worth the risk finding someone with a heart void and running|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: Cool I'll let her know you're watching|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Deal 1 now starting - players sorting cards....|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not an opening of beauty|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Balanced 11 counts should not be opened in my opinion|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|kemperg: hi all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: we start with a partscore no blood here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless you play a mini NT of course, say 10-12|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Mike :) |pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: and "right siding"  4 @H with transfer |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kemperg: what happened with the score of the first session?|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@C is precision style|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@S can be made, but very tough to finesse spades on the 2nd round if they start AK@H|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@D actually plays more easily, but hard for West to believe that|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ianmcc: good valuation West|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Germ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just as well that N-S do not; that would have been costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Wayne Burrows|pg||
nt|cascade: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A Smolen sequence for E-W|pg||
mb|4D|nt|cascade: well Smolen for west but not east :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West showing four spades and five hearts|pg||
nt|bebechira: Hi Shirley and Mike..thx a lot for helping us|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Traian, pleasure here |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: Hello Uans|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hans|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|bebechira: we have Cathy operating and she is doing a wonderful job|pg||
nt|patricck: At least east is in control, perhaps he will be able to choose 6@D|pg||
mb|5S|nt|Walddk2: Mundeel thought the other way round I suspect|pg||
nt|cascade: luckily everything behaves and 3NT will survive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mundell, sry|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: and Ian|pg||
nt|haans: most would bid only 2@H |pg||
mb|6D|nt|cascade: 4@H looks a slightly better contract to me|pg||
nt|bebechira: youth final will be 4 sets of 10 boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|7S|mb|p|nt|haans: bad 10 pointer|pg||
nt|bebechira: she is playing in NSW youth team...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cascade: the advantage of Smolen is that the strong NT hand gets to play the 5=3 fit if it exists (and you bid it)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: The upside of the Smolen convention is that you will always make the stronger hand declare the contract, provided that they both remember the convention|pg||
nt|bebechira: Victoria has a 29 imps carryover|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  hi Kath|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: I'll try my best to keep up with the players :)|pg||

nt|bebechira: we are playing 2 sets tonight and the rest og 4 tomorrow|pg||
nt|bebechira: tomorrow we will have Youth final as well.... 4 sets of 10 brds|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh good hope I am there and also see Cathy in finals |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  will EW find their @d game or 3NT|pg||
nt|cascade: might be hard for north to only invite here|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s hands fit well |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Unfortunately NSW didn't do so well with youth..|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|bebechira: 30 boards to go in this final|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|cascade: and then the defense need to establish their heart trick before declarer can build a club trick to beat 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which did not happen next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is a Bergen raise, limit|pg||
nt|cascade: five card support, two aces, two doubletons and vulnerable at IMPs i think i would be bidding game!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand a tad too good for that in my view|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@h may show min. with @ss|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@s a likely make, how good is it|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: hard to imagine south accepting her hand is as bad as it could be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree that Wood should sign off opposite a limit raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: next year Cathy!! |pg||
nt|bebechira: N will play 4h and itwill be quick i suppose|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cascade: some players make a limit bid then bid game|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: But Touyz changed her mind|pg||
nt|cascade: as Touyz has done here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: need diamonds 3-3|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Viv may get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Other suits are not attractive to lead from|pg||
nt|mamos: i guess this must be two-suiter weak South is presumably jst raising |pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike,  you happy with only 3?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ianmcc: but maybe @s Kx in pocket|pg||
nt|haans: but all honors working|pg||
nt|mamos: but you dont have @s10 so probably not one you care about missing|pg||
nt|cascade: i feel if you choose to consult partner then you should stick with that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would you lead, Wayne?|pg||
nt|cascade: its true but trumps are not that attractive either|pg||
nt|sybarra: magic hand,  as the @D are 3/3 |pg||
nt|sybarra: pesky that @H's are 3/1 |pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  I didn't think E had that option (to bid 4@s) but this should go down 2 (4@s and A@h), minimum|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bebechira: this is not the kind of board ACT needs...they need swingy boards|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cascade: i like to attack but that is a guess here|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of tricks here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cascade: a trump will usually give declarer a tempo|pg||
nt|cascade: would you lead a trump Roland?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome to Frank Budai|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think I know what went through Touyz's mind. "I am not good enough for a Jacoby 2NT, and I am too good for 4@S. So I'll make a limit raise then bid game later. That should convey ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the message". Just a guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  please correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 8@s did not win the first trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  first spade trick that is|pg||
nt|andyv:  we may not be able to get a record of how the hand was played|pg||
nt|sybarra: little does she know |pg||
nt|mamos: may be if WA are already quite away behind there is a case for bidding  more|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry lost them|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: esp. red |pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: if you do not pass 4@S you find many slams that will not make|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mamos: 5@S  is always a horrid thing to play -- no gain but lots of strain :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d7|pc|sQ|nt|haans: not p-clubs at its best|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: howcome 11?|pg||
nt|frankaus: we will get them for the final set i expect|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  I don't know what 2@h is here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strange when looking at four in the dummy|pg||
nt|cascade: and they didnt cash their diamond tricks |pg||
nt|bebechira: intersting hand... open room in 4s making|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  perhaps it's weak with majors|pg||
nt|haans: my vote for 3@H|pg||
nt|cascade: EW need to stay low with their distributional hands |pg||
mb|4H|nt|mamos: did he dperhaps draw trump and conceded Diamond?|pg||
nt|cascade: this is potentially 800 i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know that Viv would like to double, but I also know that her partner expects 4-4 in the majors for that, so she will probably abstain|pg||
nt|sybarra: W with a lot of points  but where to land? |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 3 nt?|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we have 2 very good matches on VG from ANC... i do not understand their option for the spingold|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  W has an easy 3N bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, she did :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hands with voids are always difficult to evaluate when preempt openings|pg||
nt|bebechira: TD is Laurie Kelso...and he is trying to mantain a good "tempo" to all matches ...he is sometimes very strict with time at the club|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: that not best surely|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry  was distracted by my grandchildren|pg||
nt|bebechira: he offered 80 mins for 10 boards... lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: i think 90 would have been more generous|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to speed it a bit |pg||
nt|bebechira: we had last week Albena..and they were more generous there|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not be where W had thought she would play this bd if it goes all pass|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S ? then a kiss|pg||
nt|bebechira: big kiss|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S has no play|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  the @s holding is such that EW do have a @s stopper|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now he doesn't know which suit to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At this level I think you should have 4-4 if you are this weak|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow Max double din his room...more imps for ACT|pg||
nt|patricck: A loser in every suit, and possibly more if EW get their ruffs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  E should have little trouble getting 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wayne?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At the 2-level fine with me|pg||
nt|cascade: yes i would pass|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably we play with screens - 85 is the standard time for ten boards|pg||
nt|bebechira: we play with screens yes|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 80 is not very generous from Laurie|pg||
nt|bebechira: doubled in this room ..lol sorry for my spelling mistakes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cascade: partner needs a good hand to make anything|pg||
nt|cascade: and the odds favour her not having enough|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Mercifully undoubled but it matters little as 3NT was made next door|pg||
nt|bebechira: how many off...i can not count lol|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: this could be a disaster |pg||
nt|bebechira: i think this IS a disster :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: surprised no X but maybe didnt want to give hand away and afraid of another suit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: undo undo,  I bet there is a X |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry I missed the bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: but will claim at the end|pg||
nt|sybarra: Cathy,  no X?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I don't think so|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: The play will finish soon|pg||
nt|mamos: NS clearly on different pages of the manual|pg||

nt|cascade: hope NS have good agreements as to strength|pg||

mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Take the money!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have 800 again this|pg||
nt|cascade: although wood is probably going to game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 1100 if declarer misguesses trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two top hearts, @SA, spade to king, spade ruff, @CK|pg||
nt|cascade: they have to get their spade ruff which might not be obvious with the stiff trump|pg||
nt|cascade: easy if you play obvious switch |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't|pg||

nt|bebechira: so can not be a huge disaster |pg||
nt|frankaus:  pd i only had KJTxxx so did not X :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S cannot take 2 clubs ruffs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Declarer might still lose three spade tricks, mind|pg||
nt|cascade: in general it must be better to get a look at dummy on this sort of auction before committing the defense|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Nice smooth duck by Joan|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Now 800 is a certainty|pg||

nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: and me|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: of course most people can't bid 2@C naturally as a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: because of Drury|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Wood feared declarer had @HQ10 left and that she would get two spades away|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry they played a bit too quick for me :(|pg||

nt|Walddk2: First time for you I hear|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yep|pg||
nt|athene: well maybe 2@C WAS drury here :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and decided if you play drury or not |pg||
nt|mamos: im afraid thats a pretty awful sequence and outcome - any bid that precludes 4@h  must be wrong|pg||
nt|sybarra: but given the raise to 5 @C, ...not sure that looked/sounded like drury |pg||
nt|athene: it definitely wasn't drury for north :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: maybe for south though|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Cathy is a member of the NSW youth team|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: We're not doing so well though....|pg||
nt|cascade: perhaps but she should have had a count from north|pg||
nt|athene: north should have splintered with 3@S over 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: then you have room for 3nt, 4@H and other luscious things|pg||
nt|bebechira: please check the VG schedule..tomorrow we hae 4 sets coming to you...|pg||
nt|sybarra: dealing machine having a field day!|pg||
nt|patricck: they will probably get to 4@H, a game which makes, but perhaps it is a little lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I agree, but it's so much easier for us|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2nt = 18-19 in my book|pg||
nt|haans: 12-14 in beginners books|pg||
nt|cascade: indeed it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think double is much better than 2@H|pg||
nt|bebechira: we are clashing a bit with Toronto...but forget about Toronto...Melbourne more important |pg||
nt|patricck: Nope, famous last words|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kemperg: 3N can be made|pg||
nt|patricck: A very odd decision by Zollo, not to transfer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  a decent slam |pg||
nt|sybarra: you time zones so different,  really does not come into play |pg||
nt|athene: Melbourne is much sunnier than Toronto (usually - maybe not this time of year) :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: yesterday we had 3 celsius in the morning....freezing|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought a 4@D splinter was most descriptive with the south hand|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@C Slam try  but North wont be excited|pg||
nt|athene: if north thinks 4@C is a splinter, she has a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: today was a better day 16 at lunch...so quite pleasant|pg||
nt|athene: she might offer 6@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  6@d probably makes, 6@h wont|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not after West bids, surely|pg||

nt|cascade: with this heart suit yes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: we are in the very high heat range well over 30c |pg||

nt|Walddk2: I think this is a make despite the 5-0 break|pg||
nt|cascade: a diamond was a little optimistic |pg||
nt|patricck: 4@H needs the K@H onside and probably the K@C well places too, but it is going to make today so a chance for New South Wales to stretch their lead in the other room|pg||

mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: So I can't see how they can be behind|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  but it certainly isn't pretty|pg||

nt|cascade: not on this side of the planet :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kemperg: 2@D both majors|pg||
nt|mamos: gain to Wellington on the hand where 4@s went three off 4@h succeeded in OR|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|andyv:  3@s (showing shortness) would be a nice gadget to have for W|pg||
nt|kemperg: weak NT sure, but with this distribution no other bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: our youth are wonderful...ready to help our cause all the time|pg||
nt|bebechira: 16-10 for ACT this set...so 6 imps back|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 6nt would be interesting|pg||
nt|cascade: the WBF rate is nearly 90 minutes|pg||
nt|athene: spade or @CA lead would be costly|pg||
nt|mamos: looks  a fairly ordinary 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: now,  do you bid 4th suit (gf) or 3 @H or ??|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mamos: not my favourite opening method but works well here|pg||
nt|haans: Can 2@D be Ekrens?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I strongly disagree with the 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|cascade: passing 1@s with that much is really trusting partner at this vul :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No points and no room taken away from opps|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S is clearly spades but i have seen people have misunderstandings over whether it's forcing|pg||
nt|frankaus: gr8 hands - they have been feeding the dealing machines red meat :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos: 5-9 nine cards in Majors|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry 6-10|pg||

nt|kemperg: not easy to get 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: yes Germ trying to work out best line - may take some time|pg||
nt|athene: what is west supposed to do with, say that same hand but no @CK or @DAKQ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with E |pg||
mb|d|nt|cascade: but a good suit and favourable vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: this may fail |pg||
nt|athene: i don't bid 3@H  because it's surely not forcing in australia|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: now the pull to 4 @H is slamish |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this will not do well on @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They may get to 6@H and that is easy to defeat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as Viv Wood will lead her singleton|pg||
nt|cascade: west may opt for 6NT yet|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S can make by getting the club position right|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  if they go down, EW will have had back to back disasters|pg||
nt|kemperg: i'm not impressed by Wellington :(|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: i think east has slightly overstated her hand - 4H over 2@D was ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would be afriad 3 @H also nf |pg||
pc|h2|nt|cascade: then the spade overcall may be punished|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: no-one needs to know about the spade lead + heart hook|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 6 sorry|pg||

nt|athene: tricky choice with east - double gets both suits across but loses the fifth heart which might be quite important|pg||
nt|bebechira: the director is looking for brd 25 now :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: @c lead holds it to 4@S|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: oh yes, she went two down|pg||
nt|athene: errrr|pg||
nt|frankaus: or @DA then @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  or canape style...not sure it fits into any catagory except The Little Major system|pg||
nt|mamos: two good boards for Wellington|pg||
nt|kemperg: S happy he did notbid 2@D for majors this time:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if east wants to bid over 3@D then i prefer 3@H|pg||
nt|patricck: Perhaps there is some confusion as to the meaning of North's double|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  EW already getting too high|pg||
nt|haans: hard to see S cards as prempts|pg||
nt|athene: tricky lead decision for south here|pg||
nt|patricck: If it is takeout one would think South would have chosen 2@S|pg||
nt|patricck: it probably shows 3 card @H support and South wasn't keen to introduce his weak @S suit|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: people often lead unsupported aces just because partner bid the suit and it usually costs|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand nothing is really appealing|pg||
nt|athene: that basically has to say "i have a 4@C raise but with an extra heart"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: (yes seen it :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: easy pass by milne|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mamos: seems slightly odd to bid 2@S   West is maximum (Precision) |pg||
nt|cascade: usually?|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have diamonds it's sort of good to emphasize hearts rather than clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely that 3 @H buys the pot |pg||
nt|athene: well, 3@H is as likely as 4@C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  with a passed partner, there was little reason for W to bid again unless it's a system requirement in which case they may wish to modify some parts of their system.|pg||
nt|athene: ok, "very often" costs|pg||
nt|cascade: certainly if you have something better to do|pg||
nt|cascade: here south's alteratives were also unattractive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, I would lead a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let declarer fiddle around with the side suits|pg||
nt|bebechira: this will end it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: i guess 4@C shuts out 3@S from south|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: 2@S usually show extra|pg||
nt|kemperg: and his distribution|pg||
nt|basu_4139: extra with shape too|pg||

nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  finally, NS have a hand to bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: They have screens|pg||
nt|bebechira: we are in Albert Park in Melbourne...the venue of the Formula 1 event...fantastic spot near the city|pg||
nt|bebechira: we are 200 m from the pit stops building...|pg||
nt|sybarra: this table needs to adopt the speed of the Formula 1's |pg||
nt|bebechira: they did ..3 to go|pg||
nt|patricck: :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: but not a good fit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  6@d looks like it qualifies for a Roland slam award|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N |pg||
nt|bebechira: Melbourne is the sport capital of the world... we have Formula 1, Australian Open and the Boxing Day Test at the MCG.. worl class events|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to guess where this auction will stop|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: Precision|pg||
nt|bebechira: open room just finished bidding 28...so they are late as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  it almost looks like EW are playing a forcing pass system|pg||
nt|patricck: Probably most roads led to 2@S anyway, but that is pretty chunky if it is a weak 2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: quite boring|pg||
nt|mamos: hmmm   heading towards  ................|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt will not be a success |pg||
nt|mamos: a cliff|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: yes coffee for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I expect WA to gain an IMP here|pg||

nt|bebechira: what now?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ianmcc: no action here|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c was slated for down 5|pg||
nt|kemperg: just took coffe|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  or down 4 anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could produce 4@c tricks for NS|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow...how many off? i can not count again|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cascade: not a trump?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: 2@H looks like transfer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although there is a case for leading a low heart rather than the jack|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|andyv:  and it will|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@C a @C ruff and 2 more aces, can declarer guess to finesse for the J@S to make|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kemperg: get contract in strong hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: in fact.not many|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S@S@S then @C holds it to -2 ?|pg||
nt|bebechira: lets see...|pg||
nt|frankaus: not now but at T1|pg||
nt|frankaus: white save V white game has very little margin 4 error IMO|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: east might as well play ace and another heart|pg||
nt|cascade: low still makes 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know|pg||
nt|athene: play her partner for @HKJ10x or a top spade|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  N unaware that 3N now is a laydown|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ianmcc: looks like 9|pg||
nt|athene: with the @H9 in dummy you aren't getting a second heart - also your ace can be dropped anyway|pg||
nt|athene: or take the ace and shift to something|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: so sorry, lost them again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would you play a diamond at trick 2?|pg||
nt|cascade: trump was better |pg||
nt|Walddk2: She will hopefully make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|cascade: yes there is a small danger and trumps will not be a problem|pg||
pc|hA|nt|frankaus: however these days 4@H by opps 41S save is quite the norm|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kemperg: somtimes different i mixed matches:(|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kemperg: sorry ladies :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|frankaus: can pick up @C suit 4 1 loser |pg||

pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|vivienne: is it normal to bid 4@D and 5@D with the same hand ?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|frankaus: not been a good days 4 saves|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bebechira: lol Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: -5 now|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol again|pg||
nt|bebechira: director called 5 minutes|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mamos: I play that 3NT from East there just denies the ability to support Spades so P can choose to pass 3NT if she has the right hand |pg||
pc|h8|nt|frankaus: no|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will start again at 13.30 melbourne time ..after a short lunch break|pg||
pc|hK|nt|frankaus: back to -4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this is a path to -1?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: low @c needed|pg||
nt|mamos: still nine tricks or even 10|pg||
nt|ianmcc: against this passive defence looking at that dummy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|frankaus: those internanional call on the scores (1100) sheet make a mess|pg||
nt|bebechira: another good board for victoria|pg||
nt|bebechira: true Frank.... the victorians punished twice for big gains|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: high cross ruff |pg||
nt|athene: auctions after 3m - 3M are nasty because most of the time responder just wants to offer the major but play 3nt otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: but opener playing the notrumps is not usually best|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder if 3 nt by W would have made sense |pg||
nt|athene: this auction was a bit weird|pg||
nt|sybarra: she might have gotten a @S lead from N|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought 4@D would be forcing without specific agreement|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Fuller just called Director|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: They are outside talking|pg||
nt|athene: east surely could have tried 4@S over it anyway - she has a pretty good hand for spades|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|patricck: did East really put up the Jack?|pg||
mc|7|nt|vugrapha4: no sorry there was an error on the play of that board on my part the final score was 2S -1|pg||

mb|1C|nt|andyv:  EW will have to stay|pg||
nt|patricck: ok, so declarer misguessed spades after all, a shame as it looked like she was intending to choose the winning option|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: even if north thought 4@D was forcing, what is she going to do?|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Bill|pg||
nt|bebechira: 1 off in the open room so more imps for ACT , they need it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|frankaus: imp scales concentrates the result|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: -800 = -12 -1100 -14|pg||
nt|bebechira: 28-22 for victoria this set..|pg||

mb|3S|nt|mamos: South knows the danger |pg||

nt|bebechira: 2 to go with 7 mins on the clock|pg||
nt|frankaus: home town advantage :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 3NT a chance|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt a bit more appealing than 4@H here|pg||
nt|frankaus: they know the rolls on the greens :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  quite an overbid but perhaps driven there by the vul.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: South needed to bid 3NT  |pg||
nt|ianmcc: might as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: might miss the @S 's here? |pg||
nt|sybarra: N, bidding them now |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: 5 minutes remaining|pg||
nt|frankaus: -1 = good bridge :) so both sides were -1 = excellent bridge :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: lool frank|pg||
nt|patricck: The cards lie fairly wee for declarer here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  with a 7 loser hand, W should just dbl|pg||
nt|bebechira: they certainly do.... very lucky this pair is playing for victoria to be honest|pg||
nt|frankaus: Vic's have big lead in the open final as well|pg||
nt|bebechira: fantastic addition to Juzz and Max and the others|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: well never easy|pg||
nt|mamos: nope|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S opening next door. Declarer was lucky, no-one had a double|pg||
pc|h9|nt|patricck: @C onside @H onside Q@S onside|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|cascade: 4@s in the other room was very successful|pg||
nt|patricck: although the Q@S doesn't help that much as the 9@S is still a trick|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ianmcc: 5@c was a better prospect|pg||
nt|athene: perfect fit here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and all the @S spots |pg||
nt|sybarra: etc|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mamos: WA   getting bits and pieces back  this might well be another chance|pg||

nt|athene: not sure what the @D6 is supposed to be|pg||
nt|sybarra: no problem,  this and and another hand  poc  (piece of cake) |pg||
nt|athene: surely west should either be playing a big diamond (8) or a little one (3)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: How to make only one heart trick on defence|pg||
nt|cascade: even with a double she wins as the normal lead results in -600 here|pg||
nt|patricck: but I would be very surprised if George didn't make this|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: 3NT had some chances and 5@c more than 5@d  I think that they would all fail but 5@d  never making I fear|pg||

nt|haans: allways best :)|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|mamos: I agree Hans  -- win your tricks before your idiot P revokes :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Wood's duck was correct|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer might make the mistake of playing another one|pg||
nt|athene: and you can take @SAQ and @DK|pg||
nt|mamos: NS in OR playing in 3NT   our auction much better but 3NT will survive which is lucky for NSW and unluckt for WA|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer should not do that :)|pg||

pc|c3|nt|athene: so she can lead a club up only once and that is not enough|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: next hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: open room starting last board now...so all well when ends well|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: of course north ducks this as well|pg||
