mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|athene: declarer can hold up twice in hearts but then south may find the spade shift|pg||
nt|athene: it might not be trivial for him to lead a spade, though - leading from J8xx round to A10x is very often going to be costly|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps north should overtake the @HJ and stick the @SK on the table|pg||
nt|brolucius: If declarer can read the hearts as 4-4, he can win and set up the diamonds.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: of course both defenders will fear declarer has more in spades than he does :)|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|brolucius: Norwegians usually play 3rd and 5th leads, so the lowest spot-card lead in hearts could not be from a 4-card suit.|pg||
nt|athene: whichever minor declarer has to develop, he can do it without letting north in|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the heart continuation was simply a safe play as much as anything|pg||
nt|athene: with the outside chance of getting in via a spade|pg||
nt|athene: @SK lead isn't going to cost - if declarer has the jack he has two tricks anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sigurbjörn Haraldsson from the Iceland Bermuda Bowl team|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|brolucius: With 12 opposite 12, it would be possible in a normal match that the other table might stay out of game. Not likely here, though.|pg||
nt|athene: well, it's not going to cost a trick in the suit - i suppose it might give away a tempo|pg||

pc|s2|nt|santyclz: Brave balance on that suit.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gambit: nice Q@D and 1/2 a club stopper that just truned into a full one|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sr for interrupting once. Sport by high level.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|santyclz: 3@c?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: That's the bid.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfe: I don't know what the 2@h means, but there was a lengthy conversation between|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Westheimer and von Arnim at the time.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|santyclz: Seems more likely n would bid that...|pg||
nt|chick: a hand to pass out :)|pg||
nt|peachy: West had enough, understandably.  She knows NS on shaky ground, doesnt need much math to figure that|pg||

nt|peachy: doable but does he have info on where ace is?|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|peachy: Would declarer have stranded spades on purpose if she had two of them?|pg||

nt|ybob: declarer need 3/3 @C so N showed 5@S 2@H what wrong with play QJ@D and another @D ?|pg||
nt|stewball: its not clear what this line catered to ,other than elegance|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: since they missed the heart fit, it really does not matter what happens on this hand|pg||
nt|stewball: well at least theres not as much at stake given the OR result|pg||

nt|brolucius: Anyway, a splendid board for E/W - with every chance of a big swing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2nt opener from west might end proceedings|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In fact, the full Fleisher team here *are* USA1 in October|pg||
nt|bessi2: unless Leven tries to improve the partscore|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|athene: if playing a form of puppet where opener will often bid 3@D, then you might try that|pg||
nt|bessi2: this is a rather unelegant contract but perfectly normal sequence though|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will knock out the heart and have to find two pitches on the spades|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|brolucius: A contract of 2NT passed out goes down around 70% of the time, which is why some players say you should always double in the pass-out seat. Even when declarer has 21-22 points at ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: his disposal, it is difficult when you always have to play from your own hand.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: given that he has to throw one heart anyway he might as well throw two, to keep all the clubs?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: you can get into some interesting game-theoretic situations if people "always" double 2NT in the passout seat|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|athene: responder might start passing 2nt with some values|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: In real life, you would never dare to rely on the 4th player doubling.|pg||

pc|d5|pc|c6|nt|brolucius: Helgemo will soon kick himself for not doubling.|pg||
nt|athene: but then north can exit a heart|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d7|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: helgemo has given count on the hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: Helness did in fact play his middle spade on the third round (which would show diamonds, if a true card). Not that there was much chance that his partner would gain the lead, when ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: he was so strong.|pg||
nt|athene: helgemo might not know if it's two hearts or four, though - declarer might have attacked hearts from @HKQx|pg||
nt|athene: in which case you don't want to lead ace and a club|pg||
nt|bessi2: but then he wouldnt have pitched a heart nor would declarer|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|c2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: heart exit has to be right|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bessi2: agreed|pg||

nt|gambit: Tarek, congrats on your second place finish with Zia |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about Monaco -- the 3 pairs have moved from other countries and there is some politics involved|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: What?  Politics in bridge?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sybarra: they tried 4 @S in other room on bd 33 for the save|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: When the cards start flying at this table, they do so very fast.|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: this looks likely to be a push|pg||

nt|puncher99: prob 1 suited major|pg||
nt|peachy: Their old card says 2D is onesuiter H or 2-suiter w spades|pg||
nt|peachy: I dont have a fresh one at hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-22|pg||

nt|puncher99: wht does 3c mean?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Well, it certainly isn't dull.|pg||
nt|peachy: 3C tends to me, to confirm what I said about 2D. E has spade support in case partner had 2-suiter with spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 3@c alerted on both side.  No explanation asked for or given.|pg||

nt|gambit: Declarer didn't get here with just his charming personality, very tough, but he will go with the odds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia annoyed at the distraction|pg||
nt|gambit: the room (I was just here) is samll, it was silent when I was there, so i assume he should be annoyed|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: the table.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this could get very ugly to play, 4@H is better|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H should be off 1 on the spade lead so in that light, 4S is not much worse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is making double dummy as several spectators have noted|pg||
nt|ybob: 3nt is the best spot from E than W|pg||

nt|athene: 3@S does look a bit forward, given you are ahead of the game from having bid 2@c in the first place|pg||

nt|gambit: wow|pg||

mb|p|nt|tarekr:  They do fly the cards at the end of the hand!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|santyclz: Hefty nt.|pg||
nt|chick: If she goes up with the @SA, then she needs either the @DA onside or the @HK onside.  Better odds than the finesse.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfe: A somewhat normal auction.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|tarekr:  still a 2imp loss for Westheimer|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: warned by bad breaks Zia may fly low|pg||
nt|kareno: The spade suit is not a source of tricks - Zia knows that.|pg||
nt|kareno: GMTA.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tarekr:  4@s and 3@h for NS|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Director: "you have 38 minutes for 7 boards."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Lost the play with the directors in the room.|pg||
nt|peachy: dont worry, we all appreciate your tableside observations!|pg||
nt|gambit: EOK? Was 3@C conventional?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but the lure of the vul game bonus willpush them there|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: GMTA = Great Minds Think Alike!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: as someone pointed out, in the other room, W overcalled a spade on bd 25, makes the decision at trick 1 very easy|pg||
nt|gambit: Ty CC |pg||

nt|stewball: perhaps he should have:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: 4@D probably some kind of pseudo-splinter|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps showing certain aces, we don't have their system card here|pg||

nt|bessi2: Weinstein will duck this and then there is a question which Major he will go for|pg||
nt|athene: it's a big play to finesse against the @H10 (ace and run the nine)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: people tend not to commit themselves to a low card being onside so early in the hand|pg||
nt|athene: it's usually better to set up some sure tricks and fiddle around|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bessi2: that will solve all of declarer's problems|pg||
nt|brolucius: By ducking the first diamond, declarer ensures that he breaks communications between the defenders in that suit. |pg||
nt|athene: well, this makes declarer's life easier|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Wein: attidude?|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess on those occasions when the game could be defeated, the spade shift was the way to do it|pg||
nt|athene: Helgemo perhaps thinking back to board 2 :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: this play in spades is the standard way to gain a tempo if you think north has all the strength|pg||
nt|athene: imagine if north has @SAJ9x|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Helgemo did have a side entry, it was open to him to play low on the first round of diamonds, forcing declarer to use up one of his stoppers.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: he has to win this but he can't continue the spade attack|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North then won an early trick, he could return his second diamond while South's entry was intact.|pg||
nt|athene: diamond exit and declarer can play @DJ, @DA, @S8 squeezing Helness|pg||
nt|athene: so he shouldn't have to guess the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: heart might work better? declarer can play low but then the suit is blocked|pg||
nt|athene: (helness DOESN'T play the king, of course)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|bessi2: ace and another @h looks normal now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bessi2: if the Q holds then diamond finesse and pass the 10/J of @c.. only losing if south had 3361 with stiff Q|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Same deals in both matches. Cayne 6-5 against Nickell in the other semi-final after 9 boards|pg||
nt|athene: now Helness has to throw one club and one heart?|pg||
nt|bessi2: and when Helgemo shows out on @h then 100%|pg||
nt|athene: if he throws two hearts declarer just crosses to the @CK and exits a heart|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c4|nt|athene: now declarer still has to guess the @CQ|pg||

nt|gambit: what can S do? 2NT seems the least of evils |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welland has already bid.  It is Zia who is thinking.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: Breed deep in thought....|pg||
nt|frankaus: some use their Jacoby  - responses after 2M - 2NT|pg||
nt|chick: From North's point of view, she only needs the @HA and a side K to be in slam|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 2D is checkback|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would any of you bid 2@D over the 1@D transfer response?|pg||
nt|barnets: someetimes has a thirr 4th meaningsoriginated in UK in early 70c|pg||
nt|barnets: seventies|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am afraid I would open the hand 1 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: it's not a reverse for me |pg||

nt|gambit: wishinfg|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|chick: lots of ideas from kibs ... 4@S kickback?  4@D last train?  my guess is 4@D shows both minor suit aces|pg||
nt|sybarra: meaning 1 @C then bidding 1 @D or 2 1d |pg||
nt|tarekr:  me too! however she apparently was prepared to rebid 1NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D |pg||
nt|puncher99: i dont see making 6 from either side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are you sure about 2@D?  could also just be re-transfer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 2@C as "checkback"|pg||
nt|barnets: looks as if 2@D starts a game force|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: round.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Right you are.  |pg||

nt|ahollan1: whatever the bids meant -- the sequence sure generated a swing|pg||

mb|4S|nt|athene: west surely is never letting opps play slam now|pg||
mb|6H|nt|Walddk2: That will be mighty expensive on repeated heart leads|pg||
nt|brolucius: South is worth 6 already, but may consider the tactics. No, he just bid 6.|pg||
nt|bessi2: to be fair. I've been praising Weinstein a lot,  he has played superbly when I've watched him.. and he certainly has earned one inaccurate play, and still made his contract which ...|pg||
nt|bessi2: is the important part|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he will hope that his four-card trump holding will cause handling problems for declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: If West reads partner for 5-6 in the blacks, he may fancy a sacrifice. No. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7@C is also expensive|pg||
nt|brolucius: I always enjoy seeing world-class players bid competitive hands. Excellent!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No way Levin can bid 6@S|pg||
nt|bessi2: if he were sure of 65 he would sacrifice, but there is nothing to suggest that.. his pd was perhaps just trying for the 44 fit on his way to 5@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is one of the most difficult parts of the game.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S must have shown 6-5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did 4@S not indicate 6-5, bessi?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how levin can bid again|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has surely shown his hand already. He has the @DK in defense too.|pg||
nt|bessi2: not in my view.. if he is bidding 5@c why not try for the 44 fit.. perhaps pd even has bad 5@s|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|brolucius: Partner needs to know whether you have 4 or 5 spades, though, or how can he judge whether to sacrifice?|pg||
nt|bessi2: and from the looks of it Weinstein wasn't sure either or he would have sacrificed with his hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i think 4@S should show five because the number of times it's right to introduce only 4 spades there is not high enough - partner could have doubled 2@H to get spades into it|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. with 56 you will often overcall 1@s|pg||
nt|bessi2: that is a good point though|pg||
nt|athene: overcalling 1@S with 5-6 pretty much says goodbye to the club suit permanently|pg||
nt|brolucius: You bid the clubs first if you intend to bid the spades as well. Otherwise just show the spades.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is a problem when hearts are 4-0 because diamonds are blocked|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course, you could use Michaels over a 1@H opening. More difficult when they begin with 1@D.|pg||

nt|brolucius: @HQ-8 no good. And he had only 15.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is their way of making a balanced slam try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H would have been a wish to sign off in 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: this sequence shows slam ambitions but still levin might not move - he has a lot of rubbish in the side suits|pg||
nt|brolucius: Three key cards, though.|pg||
nt|bessi2: this usually shows very mild slam interest.. at least that's how I once played it|pg||
nt|brolucius: A heart lead will prevent declarer from setting up a club for a heart discard.|pg||
nt|athene: on a non-heart lead you can strip squeeze north in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|athene: if you read the cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Or take an intra-finesse, club to the 9.|pg||
nt|bessi2: Levin's hand isn't that pretty opposite a balanced hand.. no suit of his own for tricks|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: you would much rather have, say, 3-2-3-5|pg||
nt|brolucius: East cannot write off his red queens, when partner is likely to be balanced.|pg||
nt|bessi2: but to be fair.. these 2 hands fit rather horribly.. slam could easily be laydown from Levin's point of view|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't think he can pass with three key cards and four spades.|pg||
nt|athene: east's problem is that even if he decides to move it will be very hard to show partner what he has|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@C?|pg||
nt|athene: i think if he bids a new suit here it should be concentration of strength really|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then it would have to be 5@S. |pg||
nt|athene: maybe you just blackwood and bash it in, tell the defence nothing|pg||

nt|athene: so 6@S by west was actually cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There might be a slam lurking around the corner. We shall see|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, that shouldn't worry levin-weinstein too much|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or one more I should have said perhaps|pg||
nt|brolucius: @CK lead from North would aid declarer's cause.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The fact that the chosen sequence was a mild slam invite is because West would have used a 4-level transfer on a hand where game was the limit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meanwhile, we give the closed room an opportunity to catch up. They are four boards behind us|pg||
nt|brolucius: They have been smoking more than the players at our table?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, Ekeblad is eliminated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Worth the wait if we are getting a grand slam now|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hamman-Zia bid 7NT, Cayne-Seamon did not|pg||
nt|brolucius: And South may not be able to discover that North has two diamonds rather than one.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Likely that 4@S is RKCB.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C RKCB?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is game-forcing, no need for Helgemo to jump to 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@S would then show two without the @CQ.|pg||
nt|athene: why would helness not just bid 6@C now? he knows they are off the @CQ|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1080|pg||
nt|brolucius: Did you learn that number from the plus column of your scorecard or the other one?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, I got it from 81 specs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Tor asked Bobby: what's that double? Bobby shaked his head|pg||
nt|brolucius: So popular.|pg||
nt|athene: helgemo has a pretty good hand, given what he has shown|pg||
nt|bessi2: the problem is that Helgemo has a MUCH better hand than he could have had|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very risky attempt 4@S redoubled when you may not know for certain how many spades partner has.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1080 will be cheap for E-W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 IMPs in|pg||
nt|brolucius: A pass of a doubled Blackwood response may have some meaning other than suggesting that the contract can be played. |pg||
nt|athene: helgemo might be a bit worried his partner has two losing spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not if 4@C was RKCB.|pg||
nt|athene: sure, you shouldn't use blackwood with two fast losers in an unbid suit, but it does happen|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S=a) @C/@D, usually not 9-11  b) 6-8 BAL|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|santyclz: The got a bit overboard in the open room.|pg||
nt|barnets: its a board like that that makes hours spent practising bidding worthwhile|pg||
nt|barnets: and this pair have put in the hours|pg||
nt|kit: 1@s shows no major I believe|pg||
nt|roswolf: virtue is its own reward|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Kamil had option of RDBL to show 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Fleisher has bid.  Waiting on Zimmermann.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gambit: Flannery Strikes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Some people's least favourite and other's most favourite.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I would pass with the w hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: I play it in my four card major partnerships - makes a lot of sense in that style.|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: zia chooses 2@h over 2nt|pg||
nt|gambit: too rich|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: Making a wild guess that 3H forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will bid again?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Good rule for misfits:  Pass before the doubling starts.|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Willard taking her time....|pg||
nt|tarekr:  critical move at this point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Usually she is a fairly quick player.|pg||
nt|tarekr:  good thing they are not playin upside down on this hand|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Karen this makes sense to me but not with 5cd majorites|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kit: Kamil has good diamond support, but 4-3-3-3 not attractive and being vul a further deterrent to bidding|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w are wrongsied|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 4 imps to Hampton i expect|pg||
nt|ybob: friendly @D to win 3NT|pg||
nt|kareno: No, not in that style.  Actually Bill Flannery invented it for one hand only - 4522|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Looked like the Q from across the table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: The connection might wink out of existance for a moment again. :(|pg||
nt|stewball: zia will do well to play @d not @s,,he has had a lot of tuff hands to play this set|pg||

nt|peachy: ww.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: I think he should have passed -- too likely he is just plain bidding for a minus score, and opponents probably won't be taking the push.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: talking about wild guesses, mildred breed's bid other room was something|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another contract that should be doubled|pg||
nt|ritong: but she could expect better @ss|pg||
nt|tarekr:  well shae expected P tohave A@s of course|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|kareno: @d j insisting on spade return.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|santyclz: This isn't going to be a bed of roses with the 5-1 @S break.|pg||
nt|chick: probably won't be down 4 though|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2, maybe even 1...|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: will they grt the club ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|chick: down 1 = 4 imps|pg||
nt|frankaus: next is the last in this set?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then why not blackwood|pg||
nt|tarekr:  looking at KQJ??|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for down 2|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Vugraphzfe: Lost the play.  The contract was doomed.|pg||
nt|stewball: he wont go wrong now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: gulp|pg||
nt|kit: wow -- what went wrong there?|pg||
nt|roswolf: french fatigue|pg||
nt|barnets: Multon usually gets things right|pg||
pc|hK|nt|frankaus: tu all 4 your company - many interesting hands|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: This is the penultimate board (I think it says in our contract we have to use the word "penultimate".)|pg||
nt|stewball: voila|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He thought Zinmmermann had QJx|pg||
nt|kit: Of course Zimmerman might have made life easier by leading a high heart|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Sorin, our excellent operator in Toronto|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: i bet KnR wasn't opening that west hand either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our commentators, David, Bill and Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|athene: "you all have to stop bidding so much!" it wails, but no-one listens|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: may i interest you in KnR 2.0, David? a simple extra line of code at the end and you can open almost any hand :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|athene: two-way checkback; 2@c forces 2@D so east can invite and stop in 2@H|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|brolucius: I will think about it. On this deal, East must be amazed that he has bought it at the two level.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Last of this match.|pg||

nt|roswolf: brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators (and other gatecrashersJ) Victor, Al and Barnet for their company and perceptive comments. Also to our ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I like 'gatecrashers'|pg||

mb|1C|nt|sybarra: thx to Ross |pg||

nt|peachy: Last hand on the set is upm the final set is scheduled to begin in about 25 minutes from now|pg||
nt|stewball: i'm not convinced that was % line but sure was successful|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|an|Alerted|nt|sybarra: how soon back? |pg||
nt|sybarra: 15 min or so?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Thank to all in the audience!|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Ur comments were very much appreciated.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: very soon.  Enough time to compare, and a small break.  15 minutes or so.|pg||
nt|stewball: i take that back,,i am convinced|pg||
nt|gambit: Zia speculated on the strategical advantages to knowing the "state of the match" No doubt if know, this would impact this last hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 4@H sort of fortunate -- finding a good fit and hand lying well|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chick: oops, I confuse easily, the 4 imps went to Hampton|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you to our operator Ross in Toronto, to all commentators, and especially the kibitzers. Hope you all enjoyed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: But that East hand is the type of hand which gets those good fits and breaks, so there is a lot to be said for driving to game with it.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|stewball: thanks to all|pg||
nt|ybob: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: It is a pleasure for me to do this. :)|pg||
nt|peachy: 2S might be invite with 5-4, I dont think it can be gf|pg||
nt|stewball: 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Some discussion between Zia and Welland....  They are also chatting about the|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: previous board.|pg||
nt|ybob: a clear 4@H by N|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibs say it could be Smolen.  Some play Smolen on the 3-;eve; GF, some have other agreements.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Many thanks to our excellent vugraph operator Ross :)|pg||
nt|ritong: punchy double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last board now, congratulations to hampton team who played well especially in final set, and thanks to our operator Ross for keeping us aware of all developments|pg||
nt|puncher99: ok hope u enjoyed the match folks and fellow commentators and operator|pg||
nt|kareno: Four comparisons pending though.  Keep the room open for those?  Or specs move to the OR.  Thanks for a great job Operating, Ross.|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Thank you to all the specs and their comments. Abravo for Ross who always gives us the "scoop" and my collegues Karen and Cam|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Thank-you Karen.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gambit: Yes, WD Ross, loved those notes (Roy rocking back and forth, Zia mumbling....great stuff, TY) |pg||
nt|kareno: And of course thanks to ACBL for letting us broadcast these great events and to Jan Martel for organizing the vugraph.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Otherwise it's just 'bridge'.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S probably denies 3@H|pg||
nt|kit: But this game can be defeated if defense is sharp|pg||
nt|roswolf: they will be tired after this marathon|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfe: Thanks all for your comments and compliments. It has been a fun session.|pg||
nt|tarekr:  May be they did not let Shawn bid|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks all, especially specs for their participation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Thanks all.  This has been a very interesting session. :)|pg||
nt|tarekr:  thank you Ross and all friends and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welland: "We have no agreement." (2@s call)|pg||
nt|kit: Not only does Fleisher have to lead a high spade, but Kamil would have to not play the jack|pg||
pc|h5|nt|frankaus: b|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that is some bid! |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Director call.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Breed may feel there was some UI in the auction.|pg||
nt|tarekr:  5@s showed 2 w/Q and 4@c showed 5@c with 2/3 top honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the unauthorized was what?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  2/3 top honors or better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: They are discussing....|pg||
nt|tarekr:  This is part of Jacoby 2NT structure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Not too sure what the issue is...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: EW think the auction is over.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Breed claims it isn't and that she was just rearranging her pass cards on the tray.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfe: Too busy typing -- I missed who took that trick.|pg||
nt|sybarra: someone should smack this |pg||
nt|tarekr:  only 12 tricks in 7NT|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C was definitely either Invite or Game Force -- i can't tell by looking at either hand :(|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer probably thinks the hearts are 4-2, so from his point of view even if clubs come home he doesn't have 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They should be panalised for taking 2 hours and 50 minutes to play 16 boards, but it never happens. There is a clock, why I don't know|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will be a close match after this|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|kareno: Specs thanking all the commentators also :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Yes, kudos to Jan for the work she does to make this all happen|pg||
nt|kit: So he might cross and lead a diamond|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kareno: And what a platform we have on BBO!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: OK.  Last board and I lost the play. :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: At least it isn't a doubled slam. ;)|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Final Kudo to Roland for directing the traffic on all of this|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed!!|pg||
nt|gambit: TY Fred Gitleman, Uday, Roland, Jan and you Ross who help us share this wonderful event|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Tough to say what will happen here in this session.  Hamman and Zia have kept|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: the Nickell team still in it with the last results of this set.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Seven tricks played.  Zia has 2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia has 5.|pg||
nt|kit: and then defense can recover|pg||
nt|roswolf: claim time|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gambit: Thx all, over to another table |pg||
nt|kit: we see it is a claim, but he doesn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: penalize ACBL for letting it go this long???|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: true but no other line|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ritong: von arnim feeling better now|pg||
nt|ritong: and soon much better|pg||
nt|kit: no -- he might try to steal a diamond|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|vugraphzfe: Hamman had the @d 2 out to play several times  but puts the card back.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|frankaus: bye  4 now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Quick hand.  3rd quarter starts at 8:00|pg||
