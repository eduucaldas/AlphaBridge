pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfg: There was a technical problem|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lc:  Martel's 2@S was on the conservative side, but with the 5-0 break, it was a good view to take!|pg||

nt|lc:  No human would likely figure that one out!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we've seen a bunch of nail bitters from Toronto|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc:  Nickell has made a (life time) habit of pulling out matches at the end.  |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: and women's semi-finals that were not on vugraph ended  +1 & +3|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 4@S is a fairb game ... but I'm not sure that it will make on this layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc:  Apparently, H-H don't play opener's jump-shift as forcing.|pg||
nt|lc:  Other table bid 1@S-1N-3@D -- which is GF in standard.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: I was about to ask if anyone will play 1@S|pg||
nt|lc:  So, either that have a special system, or West just took a view and passed a forcing bid.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: I think it takes an unlikely club lead to break 4@S|pg||
nt|lc:  One modern method is to use 1@S-1N-3@C as ANY GF hand.  And to use jumps to 3@D or 3@H as hands like this.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: Well, I suppose that if you are allowed to respond on the West hand, it makes sense to have a number of non-forcing strong rebids in reply|pg||

pc|d5|nt|othered1: players find it advantageous to show the balanced hand within 1N range.  At one time some authorities suggested you not open 1N with 4@C and 4@S because of the easy rebid . . . |pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Bill has convinced me    Fantunes 1@C opener is usually Strong NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc:  Actually, he was almost right, in that the @S spots produce 9 tricks (2@S, 5@H and 2@D), but unfortuantely, the defense had 5 easy tricks to take.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Al, sometimes it's BOTH natural and a strong NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: So it's not totally easy to decide which is more frequent ... you also have to include the 18-20 balanced hands in there|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Fantoni's pass over 1@S showed about 14-16|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So Nunes was not tempted even a little|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc:  So, this deal will likely tie the match.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Larry - when you were full time, how did you defend against this 1@C?|pg||
nt|lc:  (almost)|pg||
nt|lc:  Oh -- This 1@C sent me to retirement. :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: lol|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: somebody  write that down!|pg||
nt|lc:  Actually, David and I didn't do much against this kind of 1@C -- we just played X=cards and natural overcalls.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it's the Polish 1@C (weak NT, or strongish with clubs or very strong) that requires great thought about defence|pg||
nt|lc:  We should have done more -- but somehow managed to glide by without having too much discussion.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lc:  Martel is great about defending against all sorts of systems. Whenever I was his teammate (often), he told us what to play and we just played it.|pg||

nt|lc:  Some experts would overcall 2NT with East's hand, but I definitely prefer X.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lc:  With only 1 shaky @H stop, and 4@S, I think this is much preferable.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lc:  Stansby likely to raise this to 4@S.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lc:  Vul at IMPs -- and he has a little extra and prime cards.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Nickell now trails Cayen by  only 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or even Cayne|pg||
nt|lc:  So, there are minor-suit ruffs threatening -- will declarer be able to cope?  (Easier on a @H lead).|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: On a heart lead, Chip will have a choice of several 75% plays in trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I will be most interested to see which one he chooses|pg||
nt|lc:  It is possible for him to go wrong in the trump suit. If he plays @SA and another -- and guess to put up the @SQ, he won't make it.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My favorite (not sure if it is best here) is to play a low spade from East|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think he will play ace and another spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ostensibly 2@H is unbal  [6@H=unbal] and NOT secondary @S    but in 3rd seat  many rules are off|pg||
nt|lc:  Not really the best way to play @S, but he might prefer that to trying to come to hand to finesse twice (setting up potentital ruffs).|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The point is that you don't have to play two finesses from West to have a valid 75% play in the suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You can play a low card from East, take a finesse, and if it loses, finesse on the way back|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The complexity arises when you try to cater for various 4-1 breaks and singleton honours|pg||
nt|ahollan1: isn't there a coup  where you lead from wrong hand to see which opponent objects?|pg||
nt|lc:  Of course, there is "how to play this suit" with no ruff threatening and no opposing bidding -- as opposed to ruffs threatening and @H known to be 6-3.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: At lest in this case, there is no IMMEDIATE threat of a ruff ... if North had led a minor, it would be a different ballgame|pg||
nt|lc:  Against VERY weak players, they always hop with the king (when you lead from dummy) -- or think about hopping (never ducking smoothly), so that would also be a consideration.  |pg||

nt|lc:  At the other table (same N-S bidding, but known 6-3 @H), declarer won the @H in hand (WEST) and played a @S to the 10 and jack.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc:  Helgemo-Helness seem to be producing a relentless string of plus scores in the Closed Room -- broken only by an inevitable smoking break at the halfway point.|pg||

pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: this might see a change in leader|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps it depends which minor suit ace he knocks out first?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, 7 tricks wins the race|pg||
nt|lc:  The vagaries of different system (as often happened) produce a swing here.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: The 1@C opening with a strong notrump is a two-edged sword|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: In this case, it allowed South to get his spades bid, and them to rest in NT|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But in others, it lets the opposition in|pg||
nt|lc:  When a team trails enterring the 4th quarter, and has "seeding rights," they like to line up so that the same system isn't in the same seats (i.e. don't have both weak notrump pairs sitting N-S -- fewer swings that way).|pg||

pc|s3|nt|lc:  On the deal where we discussed how to play 4@S with A10xx opp. Q9xx, Lauria-Versace somehow missed the 4-4 fit and played 3NT down -- a huge gift to NICKELL since Hamman-Zia stopped in a @S partial at the other table (so like a 20-IMP swing).|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lc:  Bids such as this (1@H showing 5@S) are quite effective, in that you play @S from the correct side (the likely strong side, and more importantly, you put the overcaller on lead -- often a big advantage).|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I'm not sure what they do with 4 spades|pg||

nt|lc:  Fantoni does have some concerns here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have in my notes from 2011 italian open  that DBL did show 4@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: which is why I'm a little surprised about the explanation|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so what do they do with hearts?|pg||
nt|lc:  Aside from worrying about 4-1@S, he has to figure out how to handle the @D6542 in dummy.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: bid 1@S perhaps ... I don't know.  This is a departure from the version I am playing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nunes got from the board the 5@S bid to show Martel what that meant, or that's what I've seen :)|pg||
nt|lc:  He might be thinking about an early @HK play to cut communications.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: closer inspection  responding hand held   xxx Kxx xxx KQJ9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: What 1@H meant|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My interpretation of the auction was that 1@H showed spades, 1@S showed THREE spades, non forcing, 2@D was a game try|pg||
nt|inquiry:  Tomorrow 11am and 1:30pm spingold sessions will have "voice" commentary in open room. I'm writing the news now. Larry cohen and Roland Wald speaking. You neeed the new BBO to hear the commentary (FLASH VERSION)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H was a counter try|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thru 56  Cayne regained lead +2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, after all the huffing and puffing, this is going to be an imp to Fleisher, or maybe a flat board|pg||
nt|lc:  One of the tough things for me, was that as East here, I really wouldn't be sure what North's hand is all about.  I was always more comfortable defending against pair playing "Standard American" -- where I could work out declarer's likely hand.|pg||
nt|lc:  Does Stansby know that North has a "strong NT" with 3 spades?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You can Larry ... this is almost identical to the auction 1NT-2@H-2@S-3NT-4@S|pg||
nt|lc:  But, I'd have to ask questions to know this.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: you would|pg||
nt|bjacobs: sorry about that|pg||
nt|lc:  It's not a complaint -- just an observation.  If I played against this all the time, it would get easier, of course.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I know you wrote a terrific article in the bridge world mentioning this challenge of system|pg||
nt|lc:  Of course, Stansby can ask questions if he wishes to.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but it's part of America's making, with their very homogenous methods|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lc:  I found, though, that asking questions didn't always get the desired result -- language barrier, unclear answers, etc.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: true|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lc:  I usually get in big trouble when I venture into this topic. :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: go on ... venture|pg||
nt|lc:  :)|pg||
nt|lc:  If I return to top-level competition, I do want to try playing some of these systems -- that is the best way to get comfortable/familiar with them.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "if"?  not "when"?|pg||
nt|lc:  How about: "Maybe."|pg||
nt|lc:  :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One of the reasons my partner and I took up Fantunes was to discover things about bidding theory|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And it's turned out that we've learned a lot|pg||
nt|lc:  No doubt.  Good idea.|pg||
nt|lc:  From afar, it seems like many of the methods played by the Italians are superior to "Standard."|pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't many of the fantunes ideas come from Roth?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Many years ago, Joe Amsbury wrote a book called (I think): "Bidding better ... naturally"|pg||
nt|lc:  If you mean the Sound Openings -- that part, yes -- but I don't think Roth was their role model.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice the careful phrasing by Larry   he did NOT say anything about Big Club|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He made a crucial point ... it doesn't matter what methods you play, you will do better if you discuss them EXTENSIVELY|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The reason that the top Americans play SAYC or 2/1 so well is all their discussion|pg||
nt|lc:  Absolutely.  I don't care what "we" play as long as we know what the bids mean.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So, I don|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I don't actually think that the Italian methods are intrinsically "superior" to Standard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think they are just a little bit more discussed or evolved|pg||
nt|lc:  So, Fantoni has to be condering what to do about 4-1@S here.|pg||
nt|lc:  If they are 3-2, he claim claim.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, this is one of the famous Fulvio trances|pg||
nt|lc:  In case anyone is wondering, there really is no official time limit -- or constraint.|pg||
nt|lc:  One of Fanotni's most famous trances came on a deal I'll never forget. He was on lead against me, and if he led a @S he would take all 13 tricks!  (Against 6NT).  He took 5 minutes to lead!|pg||
nt|lc:  And, he led ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry Larry   i should have waited|pg||
nt|lc:  Maybe 2NT is 15-17 and X is this hand?|pg||
nt|lc:  I've never played a weak notrump system -- one of my fears is sorting out all the follow-ups to announce whether or not you started with 15-17 balanced.|pg||
