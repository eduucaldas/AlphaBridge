pc|h2|nt|grebrof: EW had some success about 10 years ago - I dont know why Ole Marius Myrvold didnt play for a few years, but its good to see he is back - Sam Inge has several titles - most notable ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: for Ole Marius must be winning the junios championships in 97 (or ao...)|pg||

nt|psyck: Standings after last segment: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=F2011Monradpar|pg||
nt|andersk: East suddely did have cards to bid 2 @H, I guess he cant have @H AK or KQ, so @H A is more likely, with @S Q, no place for @c A  Thats my opinioun:)|pg||
nt|psyck: sure, i'd place the @cA with the person who made a vul overcall 1st round then the one who passed 1st time|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I think without the dbl, he would let 10 go to A|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|andersk: reamember East pass with Qx in sp, wouldnt he bid 2 @h with 5 or 6 hearts with an honnour, and sp Q and cl A, I would for sure!|pg||
nt|andersk: link to results: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=F2011Monradpar|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why. It is a 50 - 50 but always odd for the hook.|pg||
nt|andersk: W probably have 6-4 i majors since he didnt overcall michaels|pg||

nt|penseur9: hi Frank, welcome|pg||
nt|grebrof: can he find the @H shift?|pg||
nt|andersk: South is ouhr excellent Norwegian vougraph operator, Toro Reistad, finally we can watch him in action!|pg||
nt|psyck: also good controls & honors cobining well|pg||
nt|veistikke:  should be hard to find @h shits since East didnt support it.|pg||
nt|psyck: *combining|pg||
nt|veistikke:  shift*|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andersk: North might be endplayed in hearts!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|grebrof: Toro actually claimed he stopped playing, but I guess it was only temporarily|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|rodal f: From here it is only minus. Is it better to use this at team and not pair??|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|andersk: why didnt he continiue @S, maybe he didnt see Norths @S 8?|pg||

nt|andersk: Now Jørn is in control, 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andersk: Toro missed the @H switch, and then too late to set|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe the bidding did not deny 3 card @h with E, still S could find the switch i suppose|pg||
nt|grebrof: Ringseth is also known as "King Kong" - he has the size for it too :)|pg||
nt|andersk: I think the @S 8 from Lunna was a suit preference|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|andersk: why did North play sp 8?  When East played the sp J he didnt know about the sp 8, so the discard of sp 8 had to be for @H switch|pg||

nt|psyck: however S may have meant 3@c as nat as did not try to find if they had @c fit|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 3@C was a search|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|psyck: normally 3@h on 3@d would have asked if N's minor was @c or @d|pg||
nt|grebrof: Jan Tore Solli Berg is one of the people working hardest in Norway to recruit new players - very nice person indeed - we DO need more players in this fabulous game|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andersk: I like 3 @D as suit and 3 @H as club suit(if u can not have 5 majors) However 2 @S is free as reley, and then u have 2 more bids to describe hand!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: EW13HP and NS fare from 3NT. The best is 5@C|pg||
