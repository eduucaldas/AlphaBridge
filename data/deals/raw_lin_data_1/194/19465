mb|p|nt|rv: 2@h is Michaels here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rv: some play Michaels as split range (either weak <11 or strong 15+)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am in that campe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the question is whether east hand is understrength, for me it would be|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: I suspect South's double of 2@h was stolen bid (I wanted to bid 2@h) and not willingness to penalize opps |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: I go even further, very weak or very strong (17+ will bid again)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: with 12-16 you don't know what to do when partner gives preference. You don't know if you have a fit|pg||
nt|ssbux: I think 3H as premptive and 2S as inviting, will steal the bid from West|pg||
nt|rv: in my view, West's 3@h is not right evaluation here, his @HAK unlikely to pull much weight in offense|pg||
