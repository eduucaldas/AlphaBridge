mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|rain:  Hi everyone. In addition to Barnet Shenkin, you can also "hear" some experts speak in this room. You can only hear them if you are using the new BBO version. Anyway, if you have problems, there is a sliding volume thingy you can adjust. |pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=(9)-10-13 HCP, 5+@C unbal  [6@C = unbal but 6322 maybe 1N]|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rain:  Also, please leave this room and return if you do not hear anything. |pg||
nt|inquiry:  but first click on the green arrow next  to commentors name and slide the volume control to the right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe that should be Jack|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: there is an issue with the hands because it is not the right hands give me a moment to resolve please|pg||
nt|gambit: 38 imp difference, 32 boards left,,expect some fireworks |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Meckwell has lots of experience grinding out come from behind victories|pg||
nt|gambit: indeed|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi everybody|pg||
nt|jpes: its lauria and versace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hi all the match has begun but there is an issue with the hands so please stop asking me to change the names of the players i will do it thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator, the spelling of the N-S names are not accurate|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Lauria|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Versace|pg||
nt|gambit: not exactly the meek vs. the meek, more like battle of the titans|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|daman: here we go|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Krishna|pg||
nt|ady: if Katz has a natural 2@D opening South might try 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: Welcome to the 3rd quarter of the Spingold final|pg||
nt|joest: from Toronto|pg||
nt|joest: welcome back all|pg||
mb|1C|nt|daman: fantunes are at the other table    they are slow players|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  No problem with the names, just pretend the 'n's are 'r's|pg||
nt|daman: and we're off and pacing|pg||
nt|chthonic: NS might get overboard.|pg||
nt|ady: will fail |pg||
mb|1H|nt|casenjo:  Welcome to 3rd quarter of Spingold Semi-Finals|pg||
nt|joest: Zia proving that 3rd seat nonvulnerable is not 100% forcing: even on him|pg||
nt|joest: with 11 highs and only a spade stiff, Zimmerman will toss this back in|pg||
nt|daman: I think that the next cycle begins with the 2012 Spingold Jack|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/component/content/article/2-latest-news/988-hamman-joins-new-team-for-next-cycle|pg||
nt|joest: One common rule of thumb in fourth seat: add your HCP + your   of spades.  If 15 or more, open.  If not, pass|pg||
nt|daman: not enough pearson points to open|pg||
nt|joest: Nickell starts down 15 but they have come from behind to win the fourth quarter of both their last two matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: ok, color me surprised :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|daman: that is quite a view     to pass 2@D|pg||
nt|chthonic: But not -- south did not overreact to his "points"|pg||
nt|psyck: Not the suit I'd like for a 1st seat weak 2, buf normal 2@d NV i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hi again to Cam and Walter|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Terry, Walter and Cam|pg||
nt|gambit: hi Jo....|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C shows 8+ minors over 1@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they can be 53 either way even|pg||
nt|chthonic: worked.  Was not making 3N|pg||
nt|ady: Nickell decided not enough ace  even if diamonds run  especially on a heart lead|pg||
mb|4C!|an|Shortness|nt|gambit: 4@S from Eric, what else|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|gambit: look at Meck's raise!|pg||
nt|gambit: indeed|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Rodwell just might eek out 8 tricks........|pg||
nt|gambit: Zia might not make 5@D* off three toppers|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe even 9|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello again|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: :)|pg||
nt|gambit: ok now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is art GF|pg||
nt|joest: the theory is: either you partner has spades (which will force you to rebid which is bad) or the opponents have spades and can outbid you so your cheapest exit is passing right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Hi Jo Anne|pg||
nt|gambit: delaying the inevitable|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT shows 9 minors with a singleton spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 4@c a spade raise with shortness which will prompt a fast signoff|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|ady: well bid hand    this should make on the nose|pg||
nt|psyck: with @c33, only 1 loser in each suit|pg||
nt|chthonic: Would seem to be  making, yes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|joest: George points out that the change will not take place until next year's spingold so Zia-Hamman will still play the REisinger and Vanderbilt this year|pg||
nt|daman: they need to get a @D trick before the @Cs are set up to beat|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|casenjo:  this will only make on a non-@H lead|pg||
nt|gambit: Can N lead a heart? |pg||
nt|gambit: no....|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: even overtrick if @s trick dissappears|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT -2 is better than -140|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gambit: will make it now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|casenjo:  Hamman would have overcalled 1@H, he loves those good 4 card suits,, but unfortunately, he is sitting North|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: hiall|pg||
nt|joest: hi geoffrey|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|peachy: Heart lead just does not seem right, quite normal not to|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sK|pc|c3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|chorush: This is a poor slam that makes, although it depends on the club finese and something reasonable in hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = slam try relay   but now we need Walter|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|bad hand|nt|barnets: so 6 either major or 6N all work|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an|relay|nt|odysseus69: i hate slams on a pure finesse and even more slams which need more and make and are bid by oppo|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|some  4-4-3-2 with 4 hearts|nt|barnets: still 32 hcp e/w and 2 4-4 fits|pg||
nt|barnets: hard to stay out I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4C|an|doubleton club|nt|chorush: the mirrored distribution is part of what makes this a less desirable slam|pg||
nt|barnets: and helgemo helness bid 6@H|pg||
nt|barnets: in closed|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|an|last train|nt|hedyg:  if you log in on the web client you can listen to voice commentary by Roland, David Greenwood and John Swanson|pg||

mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: easy for us to see its a por slam|pg||
nt|barnets: poor slam but in practice most pairs would bid this |pg||
nt|odysseus69: it would be very good to have methods which told you to keep out of this - maybe another 100 0 years needed|pg||
nt|chorush: Rodwell will start with heart K to see where, if anywhere an honor drops|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chorush: now he wont have to bother|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

pc|h8|nt|chorush: Rodwell should knock out the diamond before he takes the club finesse lest he go down more than 1|pg||

nt|ritong: hello there|pg||
nt|casenjo:  hi, Henri @H|pg||
nt|joest: well done|pg||
nt|joest: diamond shift as well as diamond underlead|pg||
nt|chthonic: Could not have anticipated that line.|pg||
nt|ady: start with 4 imps to Nickell   so all square|pg||
nt|chthonic: So, four IMPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam possible here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: he took so long he fell asleep|pg||
nt|joest: east-west may do a lot of bidding here but their hands are 'mirroors"|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: bsr henri|pg||
nt|daman: time for a slam|pg||
nt|joest: mirrors|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|joest: Zia for once at the top|pg||
nt|daman: that will change|pg||
nt|chthonic: self-hypnosis?|pg||
nt|joest: so they will need to pick up hearts and hve the club hook work as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: range? Where is Al Holland when you need him?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 5+@D GF|pg||
nt|daman: hey don't play well unless they are 40-50 behind|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont think slam will be bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: Hi Henri|pg||
nt|joest: 6NT is best b/c it can make even if hearts do not come home|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 2NT probably a club transfer|pg||
nt|daman: Sominex Coup|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk5: 15-17|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is waiting|pg||
nt|joest: in some partnerships, 4@c now by south shows 4 clubs + 3 hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: HH|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: but we'll see how they do it|pg||
nt|daman: trump|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ady: hardly expect a heart lead here|pg||
nt|psyck: W could have tried more on 2@d, but settled for 2@h NV|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: at this point Hamman would like to use double roman key card for hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|5D|nt|gambit: J@S lead after that auction |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Roddy knows Jeff is broke|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.archiviobridge.it/lauria-versace.pdf  NS card. It is a WBF card but surely they havvent changed much|pg||
nt|casenjo:  For those non-Precision people, please read Bigtrain's commentary for perfect explanations|pg||
nt|tez: 8 of @s great card:)|pg||
nt|gambit: assuming E/W can unblock the clubs, this is an easy defeat |pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, and we see it went down in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: but i don't know if they play that|pg||
nt|joest: he just cares about aces, the heart king, and the round queens|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: ace lead from AKx(x); meck's signal is standard|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hi Walter|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi joanne|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a diamond  cash K@C  and ruff a club  and ruff a diamond with A@H|pg||
nt|daman: Rodwell bid 2NT over 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: thats 6 tricks    then play 4th club and discard a spade|pg||
nt|chthonic: As would I.|pg||
nt|chthonic: But they are playing Precision, so it would be less likely to do so for them.|pg||
nt|chthonic: I would think|pg||
nt|daman: they always scratch for a makeable game|pg||
nt|chthonic: Can trick two be so hard?|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, E's hand more likely to be lighter other room than this room, that did not stop Rodwell from inviting |pg||
nt|chthonic: Ace of D, ruff, cash KC, maybe play another club and pitch a spade, ....|pg||
nt|daman: look how long he took on the last one|pg||
nt|joest: Helgemo and Helness obviously open four card majors|pg||
mb|6H|nt|joest: that looks like two + a queen|pg||
nt|joest: some pairs have steps that distinguish which queen, or whether both queens|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: Glad to have Walter here, he knows Meckwell system |pg||
nt|gambit: puts terror into the heart of the declarer, he doesn't know E can't get the lead...|pg||
nt|casenjo:  for the hundres watching 'bigtrain' was my first bridge teacher at Ohio State|pg||
nt|gambit: wow...nice to have such a mentor|pg||
nt|ady: good evening all|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: this sounds like it could be to play|pg||
nt|joest: 6@c is still safer than 6@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: THE NORSEMEN ARE FEARLESS|pg||
nt|joest: good evening David|pg||
nt|ady: hi Jack|pg||
nt|joest: i'm downloading their card from the net now|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w are very aggressive - and light openings are common|pg||
pc|sT|nt|casenjo:  I'm happy with the results :)|pg||
nt|daman: six key card that shows @C Q and not @H Q|pg||
nt|joest: thanks George|pg||
nt|roswolf: you should see some hands they have opened!|pg||
nt|ady: not a great slam    duplicated shape      but will come home|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|psyck: This will probably be the last set these two pairs play, with the other two pairs finishing the final two sets|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gambit: nice lead, and fortuitous break. Wd by Roddy |pg||
nt|peachy: Rodwell might/might not be having discard trouble soon\|pg||
nt|gambit: Declarer fantazing about Kx@D onside allowing contract to make, but not today|pg||
nt|bigtrain: won't have much of a problem|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Was Meckstroth's 9@H a spade indicator?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  If so, Eric can safely pitch a spade|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bigtrain: yeah he really likes that 10 :)  seriously it was count...  remember they play upside-down suit preference|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

mb|3D|nt|gambit: no doubt Jeff and Eric are hoping for more shapely and imaginative hands|pg||
nt|joest: one questin to discuss with your partner if you play Drury:  is 2@c drury here or natural?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Double again?|pg||
nt|ady: did well to get our for down 1 in 3@H|pg||

nt|psyck: N will not sell out easily at this vul|pg||
nt|chthonic: even favorable vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|chthonic: seems NS should have had a way to bid 3C non-aggressively -- a version of Good-bad, for example?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 3@d seems sort of straightforward but some pairs play that must be fit-showing by a passed hand in which case I guess you have to do something else|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cards lay that this should make|pg||
nt|joest: yes the hammer was awaiting in 4 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I think N shd double again|pg||
pc|dT|nt|casenjo:  remember last quarter? they gained 20 in 2 boards|pg||
nt|gambit: no...venturing too high |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Patience can be a virtue.....running out of patience can be a disaster|pg||
nt|joest: anyway: a great chance for Nickell to be plus at both tables|pg||

nt|daman: idgebase.com/index.php|pg||
nt|daman: for those who want the audio|pg||
nt|joest: Hamman may 'guess' the heart king solely bbecaus he wants to avoid a spade ruff if he loses to the king|pg||
nt|joest: note that having raised Zia leadshigh from three to clue his partner in to the fact that he has nothing in diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: not the greatest contract i have seen|pg||
nt|roswolf: north knows that already:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: with north known to be two suited it would not amaze me to see Helness start the @hQ out of his hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: it would be a super play|pg||
nt|roswolf: but a fair point|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|psyck: Good - Bad does not apply in this seq, it is when RHO makes a 2 level bid|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D   down 2   might have got 300   with sing. club on lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gambit: he want to lead a heart but can't from that holding|pg||
nt|joest: of course from his point of view that is conceding going down unless he drops the king|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup david|pg||
pc|d5|nt|casenjo:  Nice lead by Jeff Meckstroth|pg||

nt|casenjo:  On Board 34, sorry|pg||
nt|bigtrain: E pitched3 spades which squeezes W in 3 suits|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: they keep playing 1 level lower than the OR at this table   they need to compete and push the opps up|pg||
nt|joest: yeah I think Zia's 3@d was predicated on a hope his opponents might bail him out|pg||
pc|c7|nt|casenjo:  correct|pg||
nt|gambit: q@D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bigtrain: hamman zia never exposed south's distribution so the defense was guessing|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: defenders cant attack spades with any success  and a club trick can be set up for a discard   though Katz can ruff the 3rd club  but that is with his trump trick|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|casenjo:  The auction more or less gave the hand away, but now, you need the guts to underlead your Ace|pg||

nt|daman: if partner has the @S Ace it will never go away    if he has the @S K    you are letting them make|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c was a reasonable contract, needed @sA right or a long neck|pg||

nt|ady: a little high to come in at the 4 level?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: looked the unusual variety|pg||

pc|s6|nt|casenjo:  ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE, NOW GONE|pg||
nt|joest: with the ace of diamonds only doubleton, it won't be possible to stop 7 tricks|pg||

nt|chthonic: Spade Ace then heart looks right, is right.|pg||
nt|joest: yes but a bit tough to reach|pg||
nt|roswolf: ultra tough|pg||

pc|s5|nt|daman: and maybe an endplay for 8|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|daman: easy defense to beat this   Cash the @S Ace  over to a @H   @S ruff|pg||
nt|psyck: E had no @h wastage, & bidding markd pd with short @h's, so all pd's cards should fit well, so I think 4@c bid was ok|pg||

nt|joest: i'm being told it goes 800 on a trump promo which looks right.  That is still a random result and Hamman has a lifetime experience of whether it's worth passing 2@s at these colors|pg||

nt|chthonic: what a debacle.|pg||

nt|daman: no idea why he hung onto that @S|pg||
nt|daman: they had them set up beautifully     for about 20 seconds|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bigtrain: its a forced shift since he knows @C pitches coming|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Board 53 narrowed the gap even more.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  We now have a mere 7 IMP match|pg||
nt|chthonic: my goodness.... opportunities flying about the table and on one picked any up.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chthonic: no one|pg||
nt|chthonic: could have picked up six IMPs improbably, but felt relieved, I imagine to have avoided a major loss.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: all true|pg||
nt|joest: uh no|pg||
nt|joest: Helness raised to 2@s on a lot less a few hands ago|pg||
nt|joest: of course he was nonvulnerable|pg||
mb|4H|nt|joest: note that Hamman has both majors for his double.  I sometimes see newer players double with only one major here|pg||
nt|joest: looks like a trick got away in the open room in 4@c|pg||
nt|joest: ace and a spade looks like a likely suspect|pg||
nt|joest: what would you bid here George?|pg||
nt|daman: @D Q was led|pg||
nt|daman: I would cuebid|pg||
nt|chthonic: After that excitement, the players have to calm down and play each hand as if it were the only one that matters.  No matter how mundane.|pg||
nt|joest: let's take a look at this again operator|pg||
mb|4S|nt|daman: 2NT must be some form of Dormer limit raise|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT by some pairs here is "four card limit raise"|pg||
nt|daman: no support double as you can see|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gambit: OK, here is a wild one....what bridge player was rescued by his uncle "Bugsy Seigal" after falling into the family pool?|pg||
nt|ady: going overboard again|pg||
nt|psyck: I would not make a supp x with E's hand even playing supp x|pg||
nt|daman: neither would I|pg||
nt|psyck: Need better than a 4333 min hand for it|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, too flat a hand.  Support doubles should not be played mandatory -- judgment counts.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|joest: on an equivalent auction at the other table, north bid 4@c|pg||
mb|d|nt|casenjo:  Wow and just told only a 2 imp difference in the other match with 10 boards to go|pg||
nt|gambit: the player in blue jeans was a friend, Doug Fox|pg||
nt|gambit: indeed Soloway it was|pg||
nt|joest: turns out 3@d can't make|pg||
nt|daman: as did hamman|pg||
nt|daman: but they have 4 losers|pg||
nt|joest: if they cash them|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: Meck?|pg||
nt|joest: that didn't prove so easy in the open room|pg||
nt|daman: but I wouldn't have bid 4@C with the west hand on board 20 either|pg||
nt|ady: very nice lay for e/w   can make 11 trricks in spades|pg||
mb|5S|nt|casenjo:  2@H is a friendly little contract with 3-3 hearts and 3-3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 5 IMPs riding on it|pg||
nt|joest: this was the start next door, followed by ace and a spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: East hand *|pg||
nt|chthonic: Orttman would do well here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: Doug asked Ron if he he borrow thelighter...|pg||
nt|daman: if He leads the @S Ace    he can make|pg||
nt|ady: even 4@C can go down|pg||
nt|roswolf: the norsemen wield the axe|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: and in fairness to West if a low spade comes back, a spade return (for a possible ruff) looks more appealing than leading away from the heart king|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|gambit: after Ron denied permission I guess Doug did notheng, no idea|pg||
nt|daman: yes it does|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|gambit: @D through|pg||
nt|casenjo:  An interesting note, that applies to this match. Paul Soloway once said, "The average hand is a partial, the average hand is boring, the average hand I have played too many times to count...concentrating on ALL the hands is winning bridge"|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gambit: the words of a champion and gentleman, brb|pg||
nt|ritong: in fact the trick is to recognize quickly the hands you can relax a bit, in order to save energy|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Boards 51 and 53 won 10 IMPS both determined by 'parials'|pg||
nt|casenjo:  partials|pg||
nt|joest: 5@h was a bold move by Hamman imho|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|casenjo:  At this level, it is often the partials that win the event and not the slams.|pg||
nt|joest: voila|pg||
nt|daman: and there it is|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm inspired bid by west|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|psyck: how should the bidding have gone after 2@c?|pg||
nt|daman: perhaps    2@D   or 2@H by South|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, 3D a bid extreme.|pg||
nt|chthonic: 3C is a tiny underbid -- maybe worth one cue bid -- 2H|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, I think both could bid less, though all comments so far are about S bidding less|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@d is as aggresive as 3@d in my opinion|pg||
nt|chthonic: I think South's choice of bids over the "free" 2C bid is crucial.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|chthonic: The club honors are almost redundant to the implied length.  Not enough "juice" in the majors for the 3D bid.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: not a fgood move by west  feel removing 5@HX|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: so a push at 130 and both east wests will be glad to see it|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks  fortunate |pg||
nt|joest: all's well that ends well|pg||
nt|joest: Hamman's play of the jack at T2 left this situation in doubt but Helness really can't gowrong.  He can ruff our clubs and reenter the dummywith the spade 8|pg||
nt|ady: needed spades 2-2 to gain 2nd entry to play diamonds   and KJ diamonds onside |pg||
nt|joest: Fantoni-Nunes also bid 6@h on board 37|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably suspects a doublecross|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|daman: losing just 6|pg||

nt|chthonic: True|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|dT|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|sQ|nt|joest: If Hamman wins the second club and makes that play, now declarer must guess between the hook and clubs 33|pg||

nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg:  so does @H|pg||
nt|barnets: he can try that then go back to heats|pg||
nt|barnets: if diamond loses still time for hearts|pg||
nt|chorush: hearts seems a bit less desiorable due to entry considerations|pg||
nt|hedyg:  he must go for @H while he has a sure entry to hand|pg||
nt|barnets: except he can get cut off|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the problem with that is the entries to his hand are few and far between|pg||
nt|barnets: from the hearts|pg||

nt|chthonic: This hand is not crucial.... opening lead of a heart would hold to three..  now time to set up a tenth trick?  Seems likely|pg||

nt|casenjo:  He is consistant and does it every hand, even if it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|daman: 4th from your longest and strongest|pg||

nt|ady: north had shown up too much Jack   passed hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: contract is right and declarer too|pg||

nt|daman: but it will be unsuccessful|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: they have 2 boards remaining in the Open Room|pg||

pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: @CQ is rusinow|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|casenjo:  yes, Jeff and I are one of the few smoking dinosaurs left|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: interesting that there was no 'support double' by Zimmerman showing 3 hearts. They probably play it as something else|pg||
nt|joest: opposite a support double Multon would already have bid 4@h by now|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chthonic: ought to be a push -- down 2|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C   1 down only|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  It's the WiFi at the Ryal York|pg||
nt|daman: they seldom play support doubles on the other side of the pond|pg||
nt|daman: Rusinow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: Rusinov leads promis the immediate higher honor|pg||

pc|sK|nt|casenjo:  15-17 NT (took a view)|pg||
nt|ritong: wo-ow|pg||
nt|ady: can see 7 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: great opening lead even though Zia now apparently playing under an assumed name|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: the short hearts are on play so the singleton club is not getting led|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bigtrain: 3NT -1 on 59|pg||
nt|sybarra2: did we get this one right?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Is this contract correct?|pg||
nt|ritong: nikita says so|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this is rare fumble by this pair|pg||
nt|casenjo:  alerted|pg||
nt|ritong: absolutely astonishing|pg||
nt|ritong: makes more sense|pg||
nt|casenjo:  ah, that makes sense|pg||
pc|h8|nt|casenjo:  This pair has over 200 pages of notes, when I asked Meckstroth if he knows it all, he said Eric does|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Jeff pled the 5th|pg||
nt|bigtrain: their SUMMARY is 200 pages|pg||
nt|casenjo:  That's why Isaid over 200!|pg||
nt|ritong: do they still have " MOST OF OUR BIDS ARE NATURAL" on the top of their CC, walter?|pg||
nt|joest: not that a club lead appeals that much with Jxxxof trumps anyway|pg||
nt|chthonic: no mishap|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: w3ll he doent have to most days:)|pg||
nt|joest: by rising king Hamman has now unfortunately for him blocked the spade suit|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|peachy: Looks like the view led to problems this time|pg||
nt|casenjo:  wow, I'm getting jammed with comments on the 1NT opener|pg||
nt|casenjo:  14 prime HCP and a 5 card suit and protecting his Kings, is very reasonable|pg||
nt|bigtrain: KNR values the hand at 14.50 so it's in the ballpark for an upgrade|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I would probably stretch this to a 1NT opener also|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you open a club what is your rebid? |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: that is the problem |pg||
nt|bigtrain: how about 1NT :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Yes, I like 1NT in all seats with this hand|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi for those who want to have a look at the K&R hand evaluator|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I think it is a litte too good for the 1NT rebid, and agree with Shirley|pg||
nt|gambit: this has no play, wish him luck |pg||
nt|bigtrain: it's not imo...  if the J were in any other suit i'd agree though|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Meckstroth's double of 2@D also seduced North in believing his singleton was big, knowing partner doesn't have much in Diamonds|pg||
nt|gambit: note how Rodwell did not lead a diamond....what does that say?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  we do have a possible swing board coming up, so stay tuned|pg||
nt|gambit: I throw it out there, I don't know and he WAS RIGHT....so I guess he knows what he is doing, funny thing that for a world class player|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|joest: n-s bidding without a lot of high cards|pg||
nt|ady: can get a 2nd diamond trick  but may lose too many tricks|pg||
nt|joest: declarer just does not have quite enough tricks I don't think|pg||
pc|cA|nt|casenjo:  Meckwell have been playing together since 1978...without any break in partnership....they get to know a lot about style.....more than husband and wife ;)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d2|nt|gambit: he made the best lead because he is a world class player, nothing more, nothing less, he is great|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|casenjo:  ok, I asked for this one, kibbitzers now asking if I played with 'Drewsky' Casen when we were married|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Not only did we play together, but it was ONLY time we NEVER fought|pg||
nt|gambit: neat play , though delaying the inevitable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have operated for Meckwell agst various opps many times |pg||
nt|casenjo:  VERY TRUE!  If I played poorly, he only found kind things to say.  If I played well, he said nothing, which is often best.  When we finished very high in a Men's event (while married), I asked him, "Why are you such a wonderful partner and such |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting dynamic,  calm, pleasant, intense, fun in many ways |pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult to describe|pg||
nt|casenjo:  a horrible partner?" His answer: "I'm a professional bridge player, not a professional husband"|pg||
nt|casenjo:  excuse me; it was horrible husband|pg||
nt|begse: 2 içeri belki 3|pg||
nt|begse: sry|pg||
nt|joest: Zia falsecarded at trick one but that would seem to make it more likely, rather than less likely, north has the club king|pg||
pc|cK|nt|famus: hi--correct|pg||

nt|bigtrain: this should be interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: other room on board 64  we will have direct comparisons all along|pg||
nt|joest: they are on the final board in the open room|pg||
nt|daman: with AQJ10x    I would always lead the Q|pg||
mb|1C|nt|aitch99: it was quite conservative of Rodwell to pass the 1NT|pg||
nt|daman: Fantoni led the Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: might even be totally constructive|pg||
nt|ady: nice fir n/s|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any shape|pg||
nt|joest: not clear that the Nickell east-west pair collected enough against 1@h doubled|pg||
nt|joest: we will see|pg||
nt|daman: strange result here|pg||
nt|daman: i like 3 NT|pg||
nt|joest: at the other table Helgemo doubled 1@c which led to the contract of 1@h doubled|pg||
nt|ady: fit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|joest: not clear where north-south should wind up although if I had to guess, I'd say 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@H GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: in the other room Ralph Katz had to decide whether to sit 1@h doubled.|pg||
nt|ady: wonder if e/w may make a phantom|pg||
nt|psyck: not now|pg||
nt|chthonic: And now EW must show their defensive technique for a push.|pg||
nt|ady: top club lead   east can give suit preference|pg||
nt|joest: which is not such a hot spot either|pg||
nt|ady: where will this end?|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks possible|pg||
nt|joest: Zia may stall with 2@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: bidding to 3nt|pg||
nt|joest: he is too big for 3@d|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bigtrain: 1NT is control asking|pg||
nt|aitch99: whoops i think this is wrong|pg||
nt|psyck: a normal suit preferance on @c lead will make it easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|ady: did take the sacrifice|pg||
nt|chthonic: Get Lizzie Borden, quick|pg||
mb|2S|nt|casenjo:  Let's focus on this hand people|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 3 controls (A = 2 K = 1)|pg||
nt|ritong: heavy @d guess|pg||
nt|casenjo:  another partial battle|pg||
nt|joest: Having a double argues in favor of it.  Having an unmentioned KQ109xx suit argues against it|pg||
nt|joest: having a doubleton heart I mean|pg||
nt|chorush: Many pairs have the agreement that an immediate 4S by South shows the worst hand, which he certainly has, so we may be waiting while zimmerman decides about 5 clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|gambit: ty big train for system notes, that really helps us all |pg||
nt|sybarra: Walter how does he show the club void?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  bigtrain will walk you through theauction|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Getting to 7 would be a swing for Nickells|pg||
nt|bigtrain: probably not until the keycard level|pg||
nt|gambit: will Versace venture in with 4@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: here is the vugraph schedule for future session    please bookmark it    http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|ady: great pickup for Nickell|pg||
nt|daman: this could tie the match|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bigtrain: if meck had a fit it would be shown as a part of a relay response|pg||
nt|ritong: bingo|pg||
nt|psyck: match will remain close at the end of 1st set, like it was at the end of 1st, not good for Nickell who prefer to trail at the half :)|pg||
nt|ady: all square now|pg||
nt|psyck: *2nd set|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, need to be behind 30 or more|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: XX is penalty|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bigtrain: hoping for a couple of clubs with partner :)|pg||
nt|joest: my personal take is that Ralph took a pretty deep position|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Seems certain to. 9 tricks for EW seems predestined|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: bet that is a splinter|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C is exclusion RKC|pg||
nt|joest: now this is Zia backing his judgment about a hopeless misfit|pg||
nt|joest: right down to bidding 2NT to give his partner more room to bid out his shape|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gambit: look at Rodwell's hand, and his partner has opened a forcing club, and shown a balnced NT, he is salivating|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok exc |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D = 3|pg||

pc|hT|nt|psyck: yes, they need that for inspired finish|pg||

nt|bigtrain: to not balance would be classified as strange|pg||
nt|kareno: I know it is live but partner can prebalance with short spades and values.  Especially at favorable.|pg||
nt|kareno: Balancing live.|pg||
nt|barnets: looks to me as if he should be ruffing a club in dummy|pg||
nt|chorush: It was not a live auction. Fantunes had announced they were willing to play 2 spades, on a hand that Hamman had jumped to 4 spades without even making a try. Meckstroth should have ...|pg||
nt|chorush: every expectation that his side had a playable fit and that he had a chance ro beat 3 spades, which is what the game is all about|pg||
nt|barnets: and loses one trump one diamond and 1 spade|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure why that @CK is still there|pg||
nt|bigtrain: lots of interesting comments...  but people i greatly respect agree the balance is automatic|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, specs.  Too many of you to respond individually|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I'd give Meck's opinion strong weight, and we know what he thinks|pg||
nt|chorush: I have been reminded of an important consideration which is that Fantonis 1 spade was forcing, so Nunes might have a considerably lesser hand|pg||
nt|barnets: it is easy to criticise a bid when we see it is not the winner|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Fantoni: "sorry"|pg||
nt|barnets: and a play|pg||
nt|barnets: the fact it is a loser does not necessarily make it wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: the question is here is there a losing play he can make ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I'd love to have a transcript of what he is thinking in this very long pause|pg||
nt|kareno: At least you can be the 'fly on the wall'  :)|pg||
nt|barnets: I dont see one|pg||
nt|barnets: the specs say call the clock as in a poker hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: please check the board number|pg||
nt|joest: George or John do you know when the second set begins?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gambit: as one commentator said, when we all thought he was going for his life - live by the sword, die by the sword|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 5+@D GF|pg||
nt|casenjo:  another big club auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is waiting|pg||
nt|ritong: looks ok|pg||
nt|ritong: they apparently skipped the 62|pg||
nt|ritong: momentarily|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 3@H is both minors|pg||
nt|daman: this is now the penultimate hand of this session|pg||
nt|joest: Zia does not belong to the school where you respond on anything.  Good thing too|pg||
nt|daman: begins in 17 minutes   lol|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 62 a push looks like|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe they took 63 before 62|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no one skipped anything the bbo server continues to freeze and forces me to restart everything|pg||
nt|joest: I just have to say that imho Zia was brilliant on that last hand|pg||
nt|joest: he catered to the layout that existed and it paid off|pg||
nt|daman: the next session is supposed to begin in 16 minutes|pg||
nt|psyck: a bigger swing if it makes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|ritong: it s ok  relax nikita|pg||
nt|chthonic: I don't get dealt AK and not lead that suit.|pg||
nt|chorush: with that lead it may wellmake|pg||
nt|psyck: well, it it does, he can be happy the lead only cost 3 imps|pg||
nt|ady: this hand going to be bad for Nickell and may get worse|pg||
nt|ady: where Zia went down in 3@S  Meck opened the 11 that Helness passed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|casenjo:  now Meckstroth has found the club fit!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  pretty auction|pg||
nt|gambit: low spade lead from S will scuttle any slam......|pg||
nt|casenjo:  south isn't on lead|pg||
nt|gambit: sad but rrue|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gambit: SAD BUT TRUE|pg||
nt|gambit: nice to see V have the chance for glory |pg||
nt|chthonic: I can protect against their setting up hearts with my length. |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: making 140 on this one is huge|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't look like it can be made|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|daman: we have been told the next session will start 20 minutes after this table has finished|pg||
nt|joest: another pick up for Nickell provided Hamman can go plus |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chthonic: Regardless, 3NT making NS inthe other room will lead to a significant gain for Monaco|pg||
nt|ady: down 1 in spite of the lead|pg||
nt|chthonic: Nunes opened the south hand with 2H|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|joest: if Helness duckes there and Hamman hooks again...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|casenjo:  no spade guess here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  diamonds split 4-3 and a ruff in dummy for 12|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: 10-13 5 card @h for Nunes maybe|pg||
nt|joest: but I don't think Hamman would hook again|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|joest: defenders got their tap suit going in time|pg||
nt|psyck: with adjustments for shape|pg||
pc|dA|nt|aitch99: in danger of going off|pg||
nt|chthonic: 11 IMPs |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|joest: Hamman now developshis @d trick|pg||
pc|d4|nt|casenjo:  if they pick up 22 next quarter............|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|casenjo:  Nickell has picked up 22 this quarter|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bigtrain: did that really happen?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|joest: this table is a full four boards ahead of their counterparts|pg||
nt|ady: they have played quickly|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes very commendable|pg||
nt|joest: so if spdes 3-2 and club jack doesn't drop Hamman needs toruff a club now|pg||
nt|joest: if spades 4-1 and club jack does drop he needs to pull trumps now|pg||
nt|ady: would be against the odds|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|daman: doesn't look good|pg||
nt|joest: so now Hamman will be tapped out while East has an entry|pg||
pc|d5|nt|daman: wow|pg||
nt|joest: so here comes the last hand of the set|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|joest: yes if spades 3-2 he can draw trumps ending in dummy and get clubs away on the hearts|pg||

mb|1C|an|strong 16+ artificial|nt|barnets: before it was made|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thx all-enjoy the last sgment |pg||
nt|barnets: ok chance for Nickell here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|barnets: e/w pushed themselves to 4N|pg||
nt|chorush: this must be an opening for Nickell. 4NT-1 is not often a good score|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
nt|barnets: and N/s defended well to beat it|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = nat GF|pg||
nt|barnets: Hamman led the @SK and in the end game unblocked his @SJ|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2NT is natural/waiting|pg||
nt|barnets: how will the ng go walter ?|pg||
nt|barnets: bidding|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X by west would have been penalty...  but wrong color for a 2-level double|pg||
mb|3H|an|meant as showing 4 clubs|nt|chorush: the club layout is friendly enough so that 6 clubs could be made; not that it is a very good contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|barnets: if 6@C is bid the play very reasonably will not be swift|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: well, we will find out if this can make soon enough|pg||
nt|barnets: north has no attractive lead may lead a trump|pg||
nt|barnets: that would not work well|pg||
nt|barnets: cant lead a major|pg||
nt|chorush: the general plan for the play is likely to establish diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe a diamond dummys suit|pg||
nt|barnets: here north has a severe problem|pg||
nt|barnets: with his lead|pg||
nt|chorush: the club spots are friendly but the diamonds not so much. Opening lead will be critical|pg||
nt|barnets: who would have thought a club lead would be disastrous|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|barnets: this is a tough hand to play |pg||
nt|chorush: tough is an understatement|pg||
nt|chorush: when I said earlier that I thought it was makeable, I wasn't cnsidering playing it:)|pg||

nt|casenjo:  they will once again be the 'come from behind guys'|pg||
nt|ritong: ok|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Jack of @D lead, followed by a spade shift|pg||
nt|joest: my suspicion is that we will see 4@s here as well|pg||
nt|daman: can they stay out of game?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|bigtrain: 2+@D 10-15|pg||
mb|2D|nt|joest: At the other table 1@c was the chosen opening bid which may have helped influenced south to just bid a gamewhen he got raised|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: tough call for Helgemo.  3NT might sound like 18|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bigtrain: X can be 5@H with GF values|pg||
nt|chorush: Multon passed where Meckstroth doubld|pg||
nt|ady: some would open west hand   maybe cant  in their system|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s is a compromise that sounds maybe like a fifth club but not so clear in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely to end in 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expected that|pg||
nt|joest: Helness has a pretty good hand|pg||
mb|4C|nt|joest: interesting  he suppresses his spades to play for penalties (I presume)|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  last board of a truly excitging match|pg||
nt|roswolf: and iws bidding it|pg||
nt|joest: the fourth and final NT! :)|pg||
nt|ady: even white against red  not wild about heart overcall|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bigtrain: but here it's "normal"|pg||
nt|daman: would you have bid 1@S Joe?|pg||
nt|joest: Yes I would.  I admit it|pg||
nt|daman: Jack   sorry|pg||
nt|joest: but pass is certainly more exciting|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal, thanks all, next set in a couple of hours.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: this is the second time this set that the Nickell team has 'taken a view' by defending 1@h doubled|pg||
nt|roswolf: firm;y does it|pg||
nt|joest: but actually the heart overcall helped create some of this ambiguity|pg||
nt|roswolf: f[rmly|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: something happened to board 61 result...  thats why score changed|pg||
nt|pfbr: ty commentators :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: start 6 eastern|pg||
nt|pfbr: and ty operator :) |pg||
nt|ady: this not exactly a favourate to make|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|joest: it didnt work last time|pg||
nt|ady: thx all |pg||
nt|joest: Hamman knew not to lead a heart|pg||
nt|ady: own suit so bad    tried something a bit desparate|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|joest: in fairness he has a very difficult lead problem|pg||
nt|ady: yes   agree|pg||
nt|joest: if each of you tell me you would unerringly lead the @d 10 i believe you|pg||
nt|roswolf: geir has a very difficult declarer problem|pg||
pc|s2|nt|casenjo:  more or less the same auction at the other table|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Please return for an exciting 4th quarter!!!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Wow, slow down guys, too many questions!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Board 61 is now correct as Henri says|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it looks like things are a bit messed up so we'll have to wait for comparasions to see who wins|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: will not take long|pg||
nt|casenjo:  And yes Meckstroth made 2@H, shortens his trump length to the same as North and throws him in to pick up the trump suit|pg||

nt|daman: they shd get 7 tricks on D    no?|pg||
nt|joest: Multon may be off a card playing Hamman for 4=1=4=4 or 4=0=4=5|pg||
nt|joest: it looks to me like Zia's shot will pay off here|pg||
