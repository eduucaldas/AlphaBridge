nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: there is a problem because the Screen has no flap... :/|pg||
nt|kit: we get to start off with a nice dull grand slam which won't be so easy to bid I don't think.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: perfect fit|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: hi William|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: we're not ready to start quite yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: no boards|pg||
nt|othered1: Good evening, everybody, from drizzily central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|joest: hello all|pg||
nt|joest: + ed! :)|pg||
nt|joest: this is the second straight day that BBO has done a grea job guessing what match would be closest|pg||
nt|barnets: Hi all|pg||
nt|joest: hi barnet|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Barnet!|pg||
nt|joest: so here are in Toronto with an Israeli pair squaring off against an Italian one|pg||
nt|joest: here we are|pg||
nt|othered1: Same players as were in Open Room for the second quarter|pg||
nt|othered1: NS are likely to get to 2 or 3@S, after a 1N opening.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Sementa carefully considering his hand|pg||
nt|joest: wonder why|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: (just kidding, for those of you who just joined we're stuck without boards)|pg||
nt|othered1: Convention card for NS:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/israel/ronpa-gino.pdf|pg||
nt|othered1: And for EW:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|othered1: Hope they still reflect the actual methods used today|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: the margin should be 3|pg||
nt|barnets: Hi all|pg||
nt|warrens:  Hi Barnet|pg||
nt|barnets: Hi warren well done in the GNT|pg||
nt|warrens:  thanks :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|joest: this is quite the fitting hand for a grand slam|pg||
nt|joest: this hand is a case study in not jumping to 3@s after a transfer just because you have four|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|kit: key question is whether Robinson will bid 3@S or think his hand is stronger|pg||
nt|joest: it's on the borderline|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we are starting this set about half an hour late|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|timb: the 1=5 @C break would point the right way to play the @Ds|pg||
nt|joest: with spades 32 you don't need to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H shows a balanced 4@S call|pg||
nt|timb: true, i'm a bit slow this laye at nihjt|pg||
nt|joest: just curious: 4@s is some 'playing strength' call?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like 3@d = weak and natural|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Julian, David and Bill|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@d could be a good save|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All British team of commentators|pg||
nt|athene: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Hi Bill|pg||
nt|joest: admittedly even for 'law followers' there would be what they call 'negative adjustments' here|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: it happens to everybody Tim.  Just keep putting out those great books of yours and we'll all be happy|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S would be a distributrional thing of some kind|pg||
nt|timb: I was thinking 7NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: good day all|pg||
nt|barnets: So Dan says the score is only 3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|swanson: This is an unusual use for a double jump reverse.  The most frequent use is short hearts of some kind.|pg||
nt|athene: south, with nothing in diamonds, doesn't mind massively if his partner wants to bid on here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do not think South's pass is forcing here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|joest: 0 or 3|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd can see the keycards, but not the fillers|pg||
nt|athene: but that was rarely going to happen|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  faling to X will not be costly as looks like only 1 down|pg||
nt|othered1: good for NS that they don't superaccept a transfer with a minimum|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: this would be a harder choice if dummy had @CKxx|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-16  for 1st quarter scores (except one)|pg||
nt|athene: because giving declarer an extra club trick for a heart pitch from his hand might be fatal|pg||
nt|athene: but here, playing the ace is not likely to cost because  a pitch from dummy on @CQxx is going to be useless|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South should be thinking what can declarer usefully throw from dummy on the @cQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as declarer cannot have @sKxx on the bidding, there wil be no useful discard|pg||
nt|athene: south just wondering if declarer might possibly have the bare @CQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps I should have phrased that differently after the previous set|pg||
nt|athene: i don'tt hink north can really have seven clubs but i suppose it's conceivable|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Kranyak-Schwartz do plenty of thinking without any encouragement :(|pg||
nt|joest: it would help Ginossar greatly to be able to see the opponent's cards to make this one|pg||
nt|joest: down 2 would not surprise me|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson has the fillers, but he isn't in charge|pg||
nt|joest: now does 6@d ask for third round control?|pg||
nt|athene: certainly the jump to 4@S as a passed hand tends to be a two-suiter|pg||
nt|warrens:  Pachtmann-Ginossar play transfers over 1@C, so 1@S here denies a 4-card major|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: but not 5-7 :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: no 3rd round control stuff I don't think|pg||
nt|kit: Now Boyd might bid 6NT, which has to suggest the grand|pg||
nt|joest: that is dynamite I agree.  Even good pairs revert to cue bidding or other stuff|pg||
nt|joest: i think Sementa may play count signals here which will definitely not clear up the club jack story if i'm right|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: well, if they continue he has an elimination|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: overtricks how many|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: ok, we're going to restart hold on a sec|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: so laydown grand missed here -- and missed in other room also|pg||
nt|swanson: 6@S is no kings.  In the old days 6@C would show none and South could make a further try if he tought it was appropriate.|pg||
nt|timb: If there was a conventional agreement that 6@D over 5@C promise both minor suit kings...|pg||
nt|kit: 6@D would be offer to play I think|pg||
nt|timb: True but "if"|pg||
nt|joest: understood. Critical point for all partnerships.   In some I play it is an offer to play over a queen denial but not otherwise|pg||
nt|kit: Would have been better if North had been the RKC bidder.  He has the key queens, so he knows which kings are working.|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|swanson: If your opponents bid a making grand against you with 33HCP, a 4-4 fit, and no singletons, you aren't having a good session.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South should have no problem cashing tw9o aces when in |pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: Robinson's shape was known to be 4-4-3-2, not 5-4-2-2 by the way|pg||
nt|timb: In my partnerships, given he had bid 4NT, partner would have denied 4+ diamonds |pg||
nt|athene: you can play hearts here and hope they cash out wrong|pg||
nt|athene: i guess|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer has to have 1 spade or you are not beating it|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzfg: for -1 or making|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|joest: now the heart through and he is down one pretty much no matter what|pg||

nt|kit: I believe that Boyd should have gambled it -- try constructing hands Robinson can have which justify the 4@H call, and I don't think the grand will ever be worse than a finesse.|pg||
nt|joest: i was just thinking that|pg||
nt|athene: not any more :)|pg||
nt|athene: another club to force dummy there would not work|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could set up hearts and then run them through south and neutralize his trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS missed their spade game in the OR|pg||
nt|athene: so south had to cash the sapde|pg||
nt|athene: the spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: he was deciding whether or not to be annoyed by partner's failure to overtake and lead back a diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: every overtrick is important|pg||
nt|barnets: at this stage|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but that was hardly a taxing defence to find|pg||
nt|joest: interesting decision here.  1@s has no lead directing value whatsover but it's always important to stake claim to the boss suit if you can|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I wonder if the Italians would have acted on south's hand.  My guess is they would|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kit: If the grand is no worse than a finesse and there is a reasonable chance it is laydown, the odds on bidding it at IMPs are good.|pg||
nt|joest: although AJxx/AQ/Axxx/QJx wouldn't be so hot. That's why 6@d as a 3rd round ask would be great|pg||
mb|d|nt|wygbe1: well you could change the club qj into the heart king, same shape, no play|pg||
nt|kit: that hand wouldn't be a 4@H bid IMO|pg||
nt|kit: but you know he doesn't have the king of hearts!|pg||
nt|wygbe1: very true|pg||
nt|joest: Are Boyd and Robinson playing transfer responses?|pg||
nt|ady: seems 11 tricks were made in spades on hand 1|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kit: 1@H shows spades, as seems clear|pg||
nt|barnets: I am with south|pg||
nt|joest: this is an auto balance here|pg||
nt|othered1: balance with what?|pg||
nt|joest: how about 2@d?|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT is virtually a club raise.|pg||
nt|joest: i cannot see defending 1NT with this cards although I can see I have the worst possible buy if I act|pg||
nt|othered1: after 1@C-1N, opponents often have @D length between them|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@D should be 2 suits|pg||
nt|barnets: as |pg||
nt|joest: i agree barnet|pg||
nt|barnets: as he did not bid 1@D|pg||
nt|joest: plus west may take the push to 3@c|pg||
nt|tez: hi|pg||
nt|barnets: If they played that the bid would jump out|pg||
nt|joest: as clear as the 'two suit inference' might be to us, Barnet, it may not be so clear in real life|pg||
nt|barnets: so I doubt they do|pg||
nt|othered1: an ok method after extensive discussion, but I wouldn't expect partner to take that inference as I could have laid back with @C length|pg||
nt|joest: highly unlikely when responder bids 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: well, don't they tend to open 1@C, even with a doubleton, on balanced minimums?|pg||
nt|joest: yes but with diamonds and clubs you'd just bid 1@d and be done with it|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: double here will be support|pg||
nt|joest: support X|pg||
nt|kit: so they will get to 4@S -- Robinson will probably invite|pg||
nt|joest: well over a 3@h raise the 3@s bid loses a little of its invitational flavor but south would carry on nonetheless|pg||
nt|wygbe1: you could stick the club q into the h suit, same shape = is that worth a 4h bid? |pg||
nt|swanson: This is a type of hand where support doubles really come to th fore.  If North returns to 2@S, South can bid 3@C to show extra values with a long club suit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know who is who?|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry all we are having some technical problems|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D reopening?|pg||
nt|athene: no-one really knows what 2@D, 3@D and 2@S show here by west|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yorkbeach:  4@h, 5@d and 3NT all seem to have play|pg||
nt|joest: at the other table Versace just overcalled 1@s and got everything outof his system|pg||
nt|othered1: But that's not their methods -- card says they open 1@C with minor 4-4, I think|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: Any kind of transfer type bid (rather than making a bid which might be passed) works better with a further message to say|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1this is wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: E/w have to stop in 5@C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: North would like to tranfer once again.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: do ns play 14-16 nt openers? or 15-17?|pg||
nt|kit: Now not clear if 3@S is invite or not -- But Boyd will go anyway|pg||
nt|kit: 15-17|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d will induce Berk to save|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: i think its 15-17 not sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt by north?|pg||
nt|athene: i think 2@D is a bit wet|pg||
nt|barnets: not a terrible decsiion in spades e/w have 5 trump tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  with Bill here - 2@h hardly suggests a 3-loser hand |pg||
nt|athene: cayne doesn't ever seem to want to jump when he has a monster|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@d rather|pg||
nt|athene: it cost him a vul game last set|pg||
nt|athene: when he rebid only 2@C rather than 3@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only nonvul this time|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: However, e-W look like they will be saving|pg||
nt|warrens:  they have to get there first|pg||
nt|barnets: yes they will|pg||
nt|warrens:  but probably Versace will just drive it there|pg||
nt|barnets: wild horses wont stop versace|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 4@d was an excellent call|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|barnets: and in the open in 2@S|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: Good decision by Boyd|pg||
nt|joest: was 4@s really alerted?|pg||
nt|kit: Cohler will probably go back to hearts now|pg||
nt|joest: i'm surprised he didn't the first time|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: hes still tring|pg||
nt|barnets: trying for slam|pg||
nt|barnets: lauria has decent hand now - he thinks|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|kit: Meckwell took push to 5@S in other room, so we should have new leader it looks like|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would East have bid 3NT over 3@d or raised the diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: versace did bid his 7 high suit as overcall|pg||
nt|barnets: and went down 2|pg||
nt|othered1: as expected|pg||
nt|othered1: auction and result|pg||
nt|barnets: good stop|pg||
pc|sK|nt|swanson: This is a dangerous save - it will do well only because hearts are 2-2.|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- I think Cohler should have played in hearts|pg||
mc|11|nt|joest: yes it is.   diving in a 4-4 is not a growth industry|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerability may silence EW here, at least if South opens|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H - 1@S; 2@S and you might get to 6@S i suppose|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in these days of RKCB, it is rare to bid a slam missing an ace and the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though on your sequence North may think the fit is 6-4 and not worry about the @sQ|pg||
nt|athene: he can ask over 2@S and find out how many spades his partner has|pg||

nt|joest: line|pg||

nt|joest: maybe catching a heart raiase|pg||
nt|kit: It may be conventional looking for 4-card major -- I think it is something new in their methods|pg||

nt|ady: auction in open room west 1@H   2@C   dbl    south 2NT    west 4@C   east 4@H   west 4@S   all pass   |pg||
nt|athene: a 2@C overcall might silence east; double isn't really ideal with only three hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but even a good raise from south isn't going to shut out west|pg||
nt|ady: not an every day auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: west is in 4@H here|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S 2@C P 2@S [@C raise] 3@H and now east is bidding 4@H or 4@S (or maybe 4@C choice of games, if he is given the room)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Schwartz-Kranyak  are N-S  against  Lauria-Versace|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so what is the likelihood EW can be talked out of game?  arrange these words into a common phrase: snowball's, hell, not, chance, in, a|pg||
nt|joest: i don't like his chances|pg||
nt|barnets: and 5@C in open too|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: most use 2NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|kit: this I know is conventional, looking for major-suit holdings|pg||
nt|joest: I have played 3@d a couple of ways here|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H shows 3 or 4 hearts I think|pg||
nt|swanson: Any bid other than pass my North looks like an effort to turn a plus into a minus.|pg||
nt|joest: looking for a three card major is one treament|pg||
nt|barnets: He has already gone a few down in first 2 and is heading fo|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|kit: E-W have no idea it is their hand|pg||
nt|joest: Well if Cohler is thinking ...|pg||
nt|barnets: for more here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: chances of getting to a slam with an immediate spade raise|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D now probably showing 3-5-4-1|pg||
nt|joest: at the other table north tried to find a 4-4 major suit fit (unsuccessfully). Same result east-west here|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: when you open these hands with 3@c, 3NT by partner was not what you had in mind|pg||
nt|othered1: That's no everyone's 1N overcall.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  loses the option to use 2NT as a natural game but can gain on big hands|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  natural game try|pg||
nt|athene: singleton club opposite is fairly good news for north|pg||
nt|joest: in most |pg||
nt|joest: "garbage stayman' sequence I'm familiar with|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT is not possible|pg||
nt|joest: either pass 2@h or correct to 2@s|pg||
nt|joest: but this east west knows what they are doing for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: not garbage stayman|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: 2@H was a range ask|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: Boyd runs before anything happens|pg||
nt|timb: 3nt over 3@C would probably have got a @S lead...|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: but only three trumps in dummy is VERY bad news especially if you are going to try to establish hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so 4@S sensible|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but will be hard work to ruff 3@c|pg||
nt|barnets: and 2N a min|pg||
nt|joest: thx|pg||
nt|joest: in a vacuum he might like to duck but he doesn't want a club switch|pg||
nt|barnets: strangely a club lead would have been best|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yorkbeach:  seems that North planned to go for a slam only if South showed 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: can set up hearts    favourable lie|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|barnets: if he wins he can power 3 spade trikcks|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4@C over 2NT might have been a splinter with four spades, say 4-5-3-1|pg||
nt|athene: and that would get north a bit more excited|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East has heard about the singleton club in dummy and leads a trump to cut down on ruffs, hoping West has the hearts covered|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead will hold it to 12 :)|pg||
nt|athene: as good as anything else|pg||
nt|joest: pinning the 8 yes|pg||
nt|barnets: if he ducks he has only 2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|joest: he also saves anothe entry to the diamonds |pg||
pc|c4|nt|yorkbeach:  with the hearts lying this well, all plays lead to 12|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: hmmmm, is declarer going for ruffs rather than the heart establishment?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: nice result for E-W in other room, virtually tying the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Duboin showed the faintest sign of happiness when he played the @sT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|barnets: Dec knows south has the @DQ now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|barnets: and has 8 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: and why is that|pg||
nt|barnets: from the opening bid|pg||
nt|barnets: and norths pause|pg||
nt|joest: yes from the slow duck of the heart king|pg||
nt|barnets: with the @HK|pg||
nt|barnets: hard to fault n/s bidding I too am a responder|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|joest: great match|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|joest: if he reads it right Ginossar will get squeezed into allowing an overtrick|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: that works as well|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 12 anyway with the @CK falling|pg||
nt|joest: these guys are already two boards behind|pg||
nt|othered1: are we still connected?|pg||
nt|joest: yes we are|pg||
nt|barnets: South will have to discard his heart on the @S7|pg||
nt|joest: at some point Pachtmann might lead his partner's bid suit :)|pg||
nt|barnets: and then dec can manage an overtrick|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmmmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: very well done by NS in the other room to reach slam after the opposing 1@C opener|pg||
nt|barnets: goodn push by the italians here|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@H a good spot here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|joest: is this 3@h too big?|pg||
nt|joest: guess so|pg||
nt|swanson: A 3@C preempt with the South hand can cause serious problems for the opponents but creates havoc with consturctive bidding over your own preempts.  A partnership style.|pg||
nt|joest: Kit you would bid 3@h in your sleep, right?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  just what I was about to say|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: EW play fairly standard 5-card majors, strong notrump, short club - i am hunting for NS's convention card|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: Yes, I would|pg||
nt|joest: transfer then key cards?|pg||
nt|joest: then a mournful signoff in 5@s|pg||
nt|kit: seems normal -- basically what happened in other room, after 2@H opening and 2NT overcall|pg||
nt|sybarra: can Berk get back in iwth H!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: with @H?|pg||
nt|joest: not over 4@h he can't|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, after 3@H opening might have been more interesting|pg||
nt|roswolf: just need to rightside the slam|pg||
nt|ady: still only 11 sure tricks    |pg||
nt|ady: trumps 3-0  but hearts ok  for 6@S|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair though south does not need very much from his partner|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the @dA and good spades|pg||
nt|joest: a phantom sacrifice in the open room|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: Anyone know contract, declarer and number of tricks on board 2, so that I can give Bruce the code|pg||
nt|chorush: Good 4 hearts here that will wind up depending on guessing the diamond queen|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S is 500 but due t|pg||
nt|barnets: to luckly lie for dec|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: kranyak might be worried that schwartz has another very light overcall like the 1@H that got into trouble last set|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w taking a phantom|pg||
nt|joest: this auction does not appear that it will develop the momentum they did at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: is this a 3@h call?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that neither South bid 3@h as a fit-showing jump|pg||
nt|joest: or just 2@h?  The problem is you would bid 2 on way less in comp|pg||
nt|barnets: they started a level higher in open|pg||
nt|joest: now if sementa raises to 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: with north at this table it's hard to imagine we'll have any momentum at all|pg||
nt|joest: as i suspect he will|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I'm surprised -- I thought they made 4-level transfer and then RKC|pg||
nt|kit: Pass over the double shows doubleton spade I think|pg||
nt|athene: doubling 2@C is not very pre-emptive|pg||
nt|athene: how about 2nt or something|pg||
nt|athene: get the minors into it|pg||
nt|athene: partner might have five diamonds over there!|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a huge fan of 3@H fit showing because south is simply too strong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if the NS spade fit is only 5-3, West needs to be careful when vulnerable|pg||
nt|athene: you don't really need a fitting heart honour |pg||
nt|athene: and you don't need a club control|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no idea that South has so many spades|pg||
nt|athene: south should be just taking control|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: inly a club lead from south does not immediately give the 12th|pg||
nt|athene: i think Versace can happily bid 3@C there to show his long club suit without implying loads of hcp|pg||
nt|athene: because with any strong hand he would start with a double|pg||
nt|athene: first ask partner if he has total rubbish; when he says no, ask for keycards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: as it requires a speed|pg||
nt|barnets: so all have done well so far here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: they are playing 5@s in the open|pg||
nt|ady: as kibs suggest almost certain to make|pg||
nt|athene: it might look as though declarer is sure to succeed, even on a club lead, in 6nt, because both red suit finesses work|pg||
nt|athene: a fit-showing jump tries to make partner captain of the auction and south is too strong to want to do that, i think|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably North could have bid 2@s over 2@c X to show total rubbish|pg||
nt|joest: now 3@h all pass?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: whoops|pg||
nt|athene: but there are ways to go down|pg||
nt|athene: you might play for a strip-and-throw-in on south, playing him for @HQ or @DK |pg||
nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|ady: best contract 6@C from east side   can ruff out the diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: i think Lauria intended that 4nt as blackwood|pg||
nt|roswolf: there could be an animated post-mortem on this one|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: well, again, that is something that an experienced pair will have discussed but this NS might not have|pg||
nt|athene: yes i think on fast arrive principles, 2@S would be north's weakest action|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he should simply have bid 6NT - not really possible for Versace to have no ace|pg||
nt|athene: but not everyone agrees|pg||
nt|joest: Duboin will be afraid of pushing them into a heart game|pg||
nt|barnets: that was quite amusing nikita|pg||
pc|s4|nt|swanson: I don't like a double here with the West cards.  You don't want to demand a heart lead, buying the contract is unlikely, and it gives help to the opponents in the auction and the ...|pg||
nt|swanson: play.|pg||
nt|ady: did not expect this swing|pg||
nt|athene: south is waiting patiently for a diamond control-bid|pg||
nt|joest: so we will have a new leader here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: I agree John, but one hates to never bid with that hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: world class players having a bidding misunderstanding in a very simple sequence - there is hope for us mere mortals still|pg||
nt|chorush: Paying 500 against a game that was 50-50 will not do well in the long run|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: ...and there we are|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is determined to reamain captain of this auction :)|pg||
nt|athene: now 4NT|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: The 4@D call is a splinter, and when Robinson showed no interest Boyd gave up on slam -- reasonable|pg||
nt|kit: After all, could have been off 3 aces on a bad day.|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: what was wrong with good ol' blackwood?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is 5@s two way, either good controls and bad spades or good spades and bad controls?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard for North to go on with two heart losers|pg||
nt|athene: jumping to 5 of a major is most often a Partner Torture bid|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting in 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has 3 sure losers|pg||
nt|barnets: if he throws def in with a club|pg||
nt|barnets: they must give him a ruff and sluff|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|barnets: to stop him guessing the diamond suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: it says "i want you to bid slam with exactly xxxxxx but not yyyyyyy" and partner has to fill in the blanks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  that is what everyone tells me when I do it :)|pg||
nt|athene: i like my partner to bid blackwood :) i have at least a 60% chance of getting the subsequent auction right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: 2nt from west over 2@C might have worked better in that north would not have been able to show extras immediately, as we think the pass after double did|pg||
nt|athene: also east might have bid lots of diamonds, which would have been exciting|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will need to set up the hearts to make enough tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was still interested in a grand slam|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: of course, every pair must have its own rules about when 4NT is (or is not) blackwood, so it's hard to know who is to blame|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in view of West's opening bid and void in spades, declarer will not want to finesse East for the @hQ|pg||
nt|ady: once the trumps are 3-0  declarer would have to get things right with a ruffing finesse had west had QXXX hearts   but all is well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  whether declarer plays a ruffing finesse or simply hopes the @hQ falls in 3 rounds, the slam is there|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have four obvious tricks against 7@D (@HAK, ruff, @DA)- is that all?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yorkbeach:  they are now 2 whole boards ahead in the OR|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|barnets: so this is a case for giving a ruff and discard|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|barnets: quite unusual|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|s7|pc|d8|pg||

nt|kit: oh, sorry -- okay|pg||
nt|athene: versace might have felt that lauria had other ways to set clubs before bidding 4nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: a gift for schwartz|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. 4@C|pg||
nt|athene: true, if your opponents are capable of self-inflicted murk maybe you don't take risks to do it to them|pg||
nt|barnets: cayne are already in front though|pg||

nt|barnets: there are always exceptions|pg||
mb|1C|nt|joest: the feared Flannery|pg||
nt|joest: maybe I should take steps to change that|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: 2@H is Flannery|pg||
nt|timb: Reese intimated it was almost useless|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland bans us from commenting for using that word :) |pg||
nt|joest: an overly maligned convention|pg||
nt|roswolf: an upgrade?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|timb: which one - Reese or useless|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: flannery!|pg||
nt|ady: no problem to make 3NT for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This may steal the pot|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|timb: theorists would argue it's has too a low frequency to use for a 2-level bid|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H not constructive ( he has lots of other bids for that)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php, or http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  Watch multiple tables (without logging in) |pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: here west did well to pas 3@H s north would surely smack 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: pachtmann asking if east could have shown both majors directly over 1@c|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: I've played it often and I think it's primary benefit is on hands where it is not used|pg||
nt|joest: you can respond 1NT a lot more often over 1@h and not have to worry about responding 1@s on Jxxx or something like that|pg||
nt|athene: the EW convention card does say they play modified turbo rather than blackwood when clubs are trump|pg||
nt|athene: certainly 4nt blackwood is not so much use in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: 2@c could be canape|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: Looks like both 2@S and 3@D are makes here, so possible pickup for Robinson|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead declarer will run round to ace|pg||
nt|athene: so turbo uses 4NT to say "i have an even number of keycards"|pg||
nt|ady: then obviously play on diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what 4nt said - "i have slam interest in clubs and an even number of keycards" and versace was not at libterty to pass it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South takes advantage of being passed hand to make what some call a pre-balancing action |pg||
nt|athene: east has good news/bad news - max hcp but soft and 433|pg||
nt|athene: 4333|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 6@h, I would just bid 3@h as West|pg||
pc|c4|nt|timb: like many conventions ;)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: plus when you do bid 1@s and get raised it is almost 100% to be a 3 card raise|pg||
nt|ady: great lead|pg||
nt|ady: will have to try and set up clubs|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will have to set up the clubs but still big trouble|pg||
nt|ady: at least 500|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: minimum 9 tricks    likely more with west getting squeezed holding all the important cards|pg||
nt|athene: a guess in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: cashing the ace first would have resolved that|pg||
nt|ady: I would have tht ace first|pg||
nt|athene: Versace can count his partner for very few HCP|pg||
nt|athene: surprising decision from cayne to penalize them at the 3 level with a sixth heart|pg||
nt|barnets: the only way down is a heart finesse|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|roswolf: with that dummy west knows this will make |pg||
nt|athene: but it sure has worked|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|swanson: My experience is that Flannery is an OK convention.  If I remember correctly William Flannery gave up using his own convention.|pg||
nt|barnets: otherwise he must make 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|joest: nice d|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might not want to deal with a second heart from east, which is good news in diamonds|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: as he will play the ace to guard against that|pg||
pc|h3|nt|joest: now when the spade hook loses anothe diamond, a pitch by cohler and voila a second trump trick|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: partner has values but no heart raise so declarer almost for sure 0=4=5=4|pg||
nt|chorush: Cayne gained 12 imps when 4H was set 1 on the hand NS went for 500|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h6|nt|ady: looks like 800|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: First quarter scores at  http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-16|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps my decision to bid 3@h is influenced by the fact that I am not used to playing a system where East would bid 2@h with the hand he has |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|d3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: might only make 9|pg||
nt|athene: duck a heart is safe now, and might be indicated by the play|pg||
nt|athene: if versace did not have the @HK he would likely have returned the suit hoping his partner had a diamond entry|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d5|pc|sT|pg||

nt|barnets: there is no play record|pg||
nt|chorush: no, but its hard to see what else could have been lost|pg||
nt|barnets: a gambling 3N may work here|pg||
nt|barnets: except clubs dont split|pg||
nt|barnets: too bad|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|joest: we'll see if they play 3@s is weak here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: they do -- and effective here|pg||
nt|ady: 22 pts 3NT came to grief in OR|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  3NT appears to be makeable|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  by EW|pg||
nt|ady: should just make|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: interesting that Lauria passes 1@H; i would have thought 2@C was ok with that suit|pg||
nt|ady: seems normal to open on east hand     but not to get as high as 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: they don't play support doubles, as mentioned before, so that was not an option|pg||
mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  yes @h friendly, making up for @cK offside|pg||
nt|ady: useful part score swing for Schwartz|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: 4@s is a bit pushy but 'I was vulnerable at IMPs' covers a lot of ground|pg||
nt|kit: hmm -- something may have gone wrong -- East hand surely not worth 4@S if 3@S preemptive, and West hand surely not worth limit raise|pg||
nt|joest: ok 4@s is a lot pushy |pg||
nt|kit: Still, on a better day 4@S might have made|pg||
nt|athene: worth a mention here that south bids 2@D as a cue rather than 2@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: here the matter should rest|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is more clearly a cue raise of hearts because south can't want to show diamonds naturally, after west bid them|pg||
nt|athene: given south passed over 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: but he might well have great clubs (e.g. 7 solid) and want to bid clubs naturally|pg||
nt|athene: so it's not clear 2@C should be a cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: looks like they play some version of what is called "XYZ" in the United Sttes|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: surely west wont sit for 2@H?|pg||
nt|athene: south got a bit over-excited here, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: THAT IMO IS A GROSS OVERBID|pg||
nt|joest: States|pg||
nt|joest: 2@d = artificial game force|pg||
pc|c2|nt|barnets: promotion|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  you can understand why East passed|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D says "i have a good hand with hearts", 2@H says "good for you, let's play 2@H"|pg||
nt|joest: so this shows a hand a little too big to bid 4@s directly|pg||
nt|barnets: coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: sorry, I actually didn't see who doubled|pg||
nt|barnets: second club|pg||
nt|chorush: will be beaten by heart 7|pg||
nt|barnets: promotes a trump trick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: if he really wants, he can go 3@H saying "i have a REALLY good heart raise" but that's about all|pg||
pc|h9|nt|joest: next door meckwell have powered themselves to 4@h north-south and east-west are mulling over a save|pg||
nt|joest: all pass and 4@h looks to go down |pg||
nt|roswolf: CLEARLY SOUTH HASNT REMEMBERED HOW WEAK HIS PARDS OVERCALLS CAN BE:)|pg||
nt|joest: i'm wondering how they came to make just ten tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: looks like down 2    so 300 in each room for Cayne|pg||
nt|athene: yes it's hard to imagine a game if partner can't bid over 3@C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzfg: Pachtmann: you have to win|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wygbe1: trump returns best|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do you agree with West's 3@s in the OR?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: and unless game is a possibility, you are risking a lot to gain little|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzfg: (in re 1st trick)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|yorkbeach:  after East had reopened with 3@d?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thde website to scores is OK; it's just that the server is slow and can't take too many hits at a time|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|swanson: Yes, but North will fear ducking any red suit card from dummy for fear of giving up the contract.|pg||
nt|athene: south has no top heart honour and not the @H10 or @H9, so he should take that as a warning - his partner might just be bidding on a very good suit but nothing else|pg||
nt|athene: if south had better hearts it would be a lot more reasonable to be aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: since if partner hasn't got a great suit he should have a decent hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|nt|ady: kib suggest down 1|pg||
nt|ady: maybe after no cover of J@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: seriously why south bid as he did is perplexing - surely you know the propensity of pards overcalls at this level|pg||
nt|athene: down only one is not possible|pg||
nt|athene: the defence will just play ace and a spade now|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: versace has the @HA and lauria has the @H5 for the third round of diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk4: www.confsudbridge.org   photos from Toronto, courtesy of Catarina Robles|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you can make 6@d, 1@H and 1@c, you just need one more trick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  for 3NT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|athene: so declarer isn't getting two spades way|pg||
nt|ady: yes   then 2 down|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: away|pg||

nt|joest: we have had a bunch of lead changes.  This match has been close throughout and remains so with 10 boards left|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south thought that the misunderstanding over 4NT meant he could take liberties - that's a rash assumption; EW don't give a whole lot away in the play or defence|pg||
nt|joest: and indeed Ginossar would have been in seroius trouble had the top heart gotten ruffed off|pg||

nt|kit: Robinson can bid 2@C puppet, and get to 2@D|pg||
nt|swanson: IT is very considerate of the players to be giving us such a close match.  Many of the realy round matches were surprising runaways.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  curious choice of contract in the OR|pg||
nt|joest: it doesn't look like he dropped the diamond king either :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 5 imps to schwarz on 53|pg||
mb|1H|an|!s|nt|joest: I would prefer to be playing 'regular Stayman' on this one|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, playing normal Stayman can and would have same auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: this was good for him|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: interesting that north chooses double rather than 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: normally you bid 2@H with five and a strong hand|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for n/s   but still seems only 11 tricks in hearts   unless diamond lead|pg||
nt|barnets: but when he misguessed the diamond suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe they play negative free bids? (immediate 2@H would be non-forcing)|pg||
nt|ady: chance in 5@C for e/w|pg||
nt|barnets: he was dead|pg||
mb|4N|an|keycard|nt|swanson: early|pg||
nt|swanson: This is an auction where it is almost never a winning action to balance.  Don't even look at your hand.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  club suit lost in the bidding, as happens from time to time|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  bidding geared towards all the other suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Cohler hates to sell to 2@D with a stiff diamond, but has no convenient way into the auction|pg||
nt|joest: and that's for the best!|pg||
mb|5D!|an|0/3|nt|kit: 2NT in other room, will fare a lot worse.|pg||
nt|joest: the hesitation suggests perhaps short diamonds in east and starting diamonds from the dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i still haven't found the mysterious elusive NS convention card sorry|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass missed out here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H bid by north|pg||
nt|roswolf: not west|pg||
nt|ady: west has to choose between double or overcalling diamonds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would be happt yo play in a @c partial with the EW cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 1@s showed precisely three|pg||
nt|joest: 1@h showed spades|pg||
nt|joest: things might go very differently here on the @Dj lead|pg||
nt|barnets: the def appear to have 4 sure tricks from this siade|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: or just leading queen from hand|pg||
nt|barnets: south has enough now|pg||
nt|barnets: to bid 7|pg||
mb|7S|nt|athene: maybe only 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|barnets: well predicted|pg||
nt|chorush: spade J is a huge grand slam card|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: should be an imp to Cayne|pg||
nt|athene: if he pulls three rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|joest: it's amazing how differently hands play from one side as opposed to the other|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  the pre-emptive 3! raise did its job - forced the opponents to guess and they guessed wrong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: fortunately he need only 8 tricks, so has margin for error|pg||
nt|barnets: the simplest line is to ruff 2 diamonds in hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|swanson: Declarer won't lead another round of trumps.  Time for a cross-ruff.|pg||

pc|s4|nt|athene: a defender who has to guard three suits might as well give up - you always get crushed|pg||

nt|ady: was aqeezed in 3 suits|pg||
nt|athene: i think that was +2, not +3?|pg||
nt|ady: squeezed|pg||
nt|roswolf: methinks only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: hands where you have a big side suit fit but a thin trump suit are a real pain because you can't crossruff |pg||
pc|s2|nt|yorkbeach:  yes would be a good try - if North ducks, you can make it - not that I can see a good reason to duck|pg||
nt|athene: you have to draw trumps to use your side suit but you can never do that and keep control|pg||
nt|ady: diamond now|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  bit wet|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yorkbeach:  different problem...|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  South is enjoying this :)|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  North is unlikley to have 5@s|pg||
mb|2D!|an|art gf|nt|joest: now all Berk has to do is duck the jack of spades lead!|pg||
nt|othered1: Depending on style (or sanity level) of jump overcall, 4@H looks normal.|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting club suit|pg||
nt|barnets: dec can play for no losers|pg||
nt|joest: you would be leading the queen and then the nine right barnet?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: 3n rates to go down on spade lead, unless w makes amazing duck of first trick|pg||
nt|joest: btw ducking is nuts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but no certainty of having 5@c|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: cash the @CK first, i guess, as you can only pick up 4-0 with south|pg||
nt|barnets: Schwarz misjudged board 54 when they saved in 5@C over 4@H which went down|pg||
nt|barnets: that will be a big swing to Cayne|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North knows South is either very weak or has only 3@s because South had the chance to bid 1@s over 1@h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders know too :)|pg||
nt|barnets: by leading the Q and then the 9|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|joest: so this looks to be a push at -50|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: not far fetched on the bidding|pg||
nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@D was a game force|pg||
nt|barnets: and 3@d was support|pg||
nt|chorush: South a long way from being finished bidding|pg||
mb|6D|nt|joest: note the spade jack as suit preference |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: This would not be a good time for 'coded' leads where jack is top.  Declarer would find the winning duck.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  definite chances here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|joest: yes last set another hand came up which showed that convention in a poor light|pg||
nt|wygbe1: very true|pg||
nt|joest: one of many examples I'm afraid|pg||
nt|joest: so Berk has to hope the @HA is in the right hand|pg||
nt|barnets: a sound shot|pg||
nt|barnets: this may take more time to play|pg||
nt|chorush: now all he has to do is make it. We can all see that whatever he does will work but he cannot see that diamonds are not 4-1|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|nt|ady: not a pleasant hand to play|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: or South having Kx of clubs -- much less likely|pg||

nt|joest: ?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yorkbeach:  one sure entry to hand with the @hK and another possible entry by ruffing a good heart - how best to use them?|pg||

nt|roswolf: great result for schwartz in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: you have to know "HOW takeout-ish?"|pg||
nt|athene: in other words how often is partner allowed to pass it? is a decent 4-card trump holding enough?|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry|pg||
nt|barnets: grandslam bid by Cayne in open|pg||
nt|chorush: Remember when Versace doubled 4H to keep his partner from going on. At the other table, he went on to 5 clubs doubled for 800|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@H from north now|pg||
nt|athene: and he has shown his hand quite nicely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: that is obscure|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|athene: south will try 3@S now, i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: N pulled pass card then changes to 2s|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS COULD BE DANGEROUS|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South overcalled 2NT at the other table to show 5-5 in @H and @c|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: south will try 3@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  simplifies the auction but makes it hard to find a 5-3 @s fit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: has anyone ever cue bid with a hand as big as WEst's and NOT heard their partner sign off?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you cannot do everything|pg||
pc|s9|nt|swanson: Why not 3@C with the South hand after partner rebids clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he will try 4@S :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: because that would be invitational|pg||
nt|roswolf: another double|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@s should be non-forcing but perhaps ns haven't played together much|pg||
nt|roswolf: well only 50's|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S definitely sounds non-forcing to me|pg||
nt|athene: north had lots of ways to force, didn't he?|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead in 5@C best   with only 2 tricks outside clubs  will need 9 trump tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW @d fit should tell North that South is void|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest: surely Berkowitz will hit him out|pg||
nt|joest: let him out|pg||
nt|bessi2: but.. his pd did freely bid 1@s and south has a very pretty hand|pg||
nt|athene: sure|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: even though he has shown his hand with 1NT, in a way|pg||
nt|joest: declarer will lead two low clubs up, in case south has Kx|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: That third opponent will get you every time|pg||
nt|wygbe1: west having trouble envisioning red v white overcall that wont produce game|pg||
pc|s8|nt|joest: a pass would have been plus at both tables and a six imp gain|pg||
nt|athene: he still has a better hand for play in spades than he might have|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: that is why 3@S was perfectly justified|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: well, ok, 3@S was not ridiculous|pg||
nt|bessi2: I fell 3@s is about the value bid.. I think pass is too cautious|pg||
nt|athene: i think cayne should just have bid 2@S over 2@D, personally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner passes with 18 and 5 decent trumps and it makes +1....he has a right feel a bit miffed|pg||
nt|athene: of course Seamon never feels miffed :) but he has a right to there|pg||
nt|bessi2: agree.. that dbl was just asking for trouble|pg||
nt|bessi2: seems right to start @h's now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yorkbeach:  chances for 12 tricks from here|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: once Cohler finds (needs) the spade ace onside he will certainly try to drop the @Hk offside|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wygbe1: down 2 now, if s wins sp and leads d|pg||
nt|ady: trumps lead  and south can play a spade early from north hand  which east hast to duck  and the 11 tricks can be made on a cross ruff|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|joest: north rates to be 4=2=1=6 so ace and a heart will let him out for d1|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  set up fifth heart - harder now after switching to spades|pg||

nt|bessi2: Kranyak is doing a lot of bidding at the moment|pg||
nt|athene: now lauria might look more kindly on his @Sxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that was a fairly horrible holding initially, but if the opponents have a nine-card fit, and you think partner can handle the force...|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi computer crashed:(|pg||
nt|athene: as mentioned before, versace doesn't miss a whole lot of games|pg||
nt|athene: north and south both had good hands|pg||
nt|athene: just a matter of keycards|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT = 15-17 so perhaps this is a downgrade|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: scwartz will surely bid 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: dbl and an easy trump lead|pg||

pc|s2|nt|joest: great board a match result for n-s|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead is sort of auto here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wygbe1: i would think dbl by w would show both majors - maybe he bid 2h for the lead, expecting to be outbid|pg||
nt|othered1: they also allow some 14's, so no 1N with 3.5 honor tricks looks unusual|pg||
nt|barnets: all roads seem to lead home|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: i remember in bridge magazine bidding panels, when Tony Forrester thought it was obvious to double, he would just put "i lead a trump" as his proposed bid :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: North's eyes sort of rolled from side to side at dummy|pg||
nt|ady: 5 level too high    the best hope for Cayne they get that high|pg||
nt|barnets: but dec cant see friendly layout|pg||
nt|joest: Duboin mulling over whethre partner can have AJ10x|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: as wilde might have said - "to reach six missing two aces might be counted a misfortune; to reach six missing two aces and the king of trumps looks like overbidding"|pg||

nt|joest: i suppose.  When I do that it goes 3@d on my left and partner bids 3@h :)|pg||
nt|swanson: Then you have to bid 3@S.  Just have a few values for the double.|pg||
nt|swanson: It is never far wrong just to bid one's suit, however.|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|joest: when I 'expand' on a convention, bad things usually happen|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|yorkbeach:  plenty of minor suit contracts this set|pg||
nt|barnets: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north in the other room treated his hand as a limit raise in diamonds (i assume that is what 3@C was anyway)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not obvious to reach game|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D looks a bit wet to me|pg||
nt|joest: south might get away with 2@h as a passed hand but that is still pretty pushy.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: everyone is having a better time at the table now|pg||

nt|roswolf: all roads lead to 3nt|pg||
nt|joest: i am checking their convention card now :)|pg||
nt|joest: i mean 2@c could be a raise but I would think he woudl make a negative double or something to keep hearts in play|pg||
mb|3D|nt|swanson: It might be tempting for East to make an agressive game try here.  Won't work out well.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and to me|pg||
nt|athene: north might try 3@S now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trying to catch up now...|pg||
nt|athene: now he knows his partner probably has a singleton in hearts at most|pg||
nt|ady: club honors lay well for n/s   loos like they may play part score|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: it is an interesting sign of the times that partners open all 11 counts but responders keep right on making game tries with hands like east's. Everybody likes to bid :)|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C = min bal or any strong i guess|pg||
nt|athene: they might be in a 30-point-pack|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard for South to envisage 11 tricks facing a single raise|pg||
nt|ady: initial 2@D raise conservative|pg||
nt|athene: south will now be wondering if his partner could possibly have four spades|pg||
nt|athene: if he does, 4@S will be the spot|pg||
nt|athene: if he doesn't, it really won't, as the wrong hand is getting forced|pg||
nt|athene: playing a 4-3 fit you want the 3-card trump holding to take the force|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if diamonds were 2-2, you might make 5@d with just one club honor right (so long as you guess well)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I think he just has a claim if he ducks, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: he knows the king of diamonds is on|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: so he ducks the heart and west is triple endplayed|pg||
nt|barnets: cn he get to his hand though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: specs are saying he can return the diamond king|pg||
nt|barnets: on the @D K|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: but you still have the club plays available|pg||
nt|barnets: he cant|pg||
nt|barnets: dummy must ruff and he is stuck|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: it all comes down to that initial evaluation from north|pg||
nt|athene: when he showed a good 3@D bid, south took the plunge|pg||
mb|5S|nt|joest: if Boyd leads a club this will be over before Cohler gets started|pg||
nt|joest: ok 2@c clearly conventional then|pg||
nt|barnets: the defence can only make 1 diamond play|pg||
nt|joest: nice takeout double by east|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: South does need to lead a club, however.|pg||
nt|athene: when he shows "merely" a good 2@D bid, even though that is only a whisker less...it's enough to dissuade his partner|pg||
nt|barnets: winners in hand and no way to get them|pg||
mb|6H|nt|athene: cash the @HAJ and knock out the @DA for at least ten tricks i suppose|pg||
nt|ady: seems a decent raise to 3 level  ie 2@S  first round|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: sorry  2@H|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in the OR, when South took the plunge, I do not think North had to have nothing wasted in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of illustrates meckstroth's maxim|pg||
nt|athene: always early in the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if you have to choose between underbidding slightly and overbidding|pg||
nt|athene: overbid!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  still at least they were consistent - if you bid a slam on 26, you can hardly bid less than game here|pg||
nt|athene: you can't catch up if you don't|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Ginossar havng a tough time seeing where four more tricks might come from|pg||
nt|joest: so am I|pg||
nt|barnets: actually trump and one when with the @CA|pg||
nt|barnets: still wont help|pg||
nt|joest: a trump return, or possibly a club, seems sort of normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: sorry, bad analysis by me|pg||
pc|h9|nt|joest: is this the right major suit 7 that Cohler led?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: lots of books, bridge teachers, scholarly articles, etc say you should underbid rather than overbid|pg||
nt|athene: as "it is easy to catch up later"|pg||
pc|h5|nt|barnets: nothing helps def|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|barnets: this is more diff slam|pg||
nt|chorush: Declarer has a way to go set here, If he draws trumps he may think he can just led the club J, but a spade return would then leave him a trick short|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|athene: they are wrong and meckstroth is right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it depends upon whether your bid is likely to end the auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no good planning to catch up later if your bid is liable to end the auction|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|joest: the auction just ended in the open room and they too are in 3@d|pg||

nt|joest: i would say +600 is a fine result here|pg||
nt|athene: is there a break for dinner after this set?|pg||
nt|chorush: I feel for Ginossar because I would be set too|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if there is time :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|bessi2: 6@d makes.. but not a slam you want to be in|pg||
mb|d|an|4+!H|nt|joest: the Italians raised to 3@h (weak) in the replay|pg||
nt|joest: this seems like a straightforward 4@s call|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|ady: ambitious 5@C   did well to get out down 1|pg||
nt|joest: three ten nine combinations, the fourth ten ( as a kicker) and a fifth spade|pg||
nt|joest: this is more than 'a ten count' imho|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  agree with North's overcall here|pg||
nt|barnets: it would take a 5-1 diamond split to stop it making playing diamonds provided trumps split which was likely|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: Here puppet will conceal North's 4-card heart holding|pg||
nt|joest: I'msure Rodwell played it well but it seems he might have received a helping hand|pg||
nt|kit: So likely to get heart lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|swanson: East will know declarer has four hearts and South four spade by the time this is over and will avoid a major suit lead.|pg||
nt|kit: yes Jack, a mis-discard at the end|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will be hard to apply the breaks now West has reversed|pg||
nt|ady: can keep out of game on this auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  how?|pg||
nt|athene: was that a typo for "can't"? :)|pg||
nt|ady: would 4@C be absolutely forcing|pg||
nt|ady: if 3@D is forcing to game  best just to rebid 3@C  especially with partner bidding hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S showing values i guess, suggesting to partner that notrumps will be wrong if he has a singleton club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  leaves room for partner to bid 3@d|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: no, North's heart holding concealed|pg||
nt|joest: well this will be ahuge pick up just when Spector needed it|pg||
nt|athene: i would never pass 4@C with east on this auction|pg||
nt|joest: I'm not sure what this shows as opposed to a direct 3@s|pg||
nt|joest: even in my own partnerships! :)|pg||
nt|othered1: In the days of the Blue Team, the great Italians used to double off-pattern.  Guess they're more structured now.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: Sementa probably playing him for some slow ten count with a four card spade suit but I am just guessing|pg||
nt|barnets: strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I don't like that 3N bid very much.. why not 3@c|pg||
nt|ady: because you would expect more from opener?|pg||
nt|athene: well just because i would never be sure it was non forcing|pg||
nt|joest: they will discuss this at the bar though for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: that board may put the match out of reach|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|barnets: he had already passed so could not be forcing|pg||
pc|dA|nt|joest: Robinson's heart suit concealed off this puppet auction|pg||
nt|joest: Berk will discourage|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|kit: Means declarer will get the heart suit right eventually, but still only 8 tricks unless a misdefense|pg||
nt|ady: then best for west to supress 2nd suit when the auction has taken a bad turn|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  at matchpoints you might  take view but not in an important match|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 3@C over 2@S was an option|pg||
nt|athene: it's difficult; partner might of course pass 3@C with something horrible like 5-5 in the reds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North should have a count on the spade suit|pg||
nt|chorush: It would also take a 5-1 club split on the wrong side this way|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: looks like upside down discouragement|pg||
nt|swanson: Wouldn't the 7 (instead of the 6) be a bit easier for East to read?|pg||
nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|kit: a lot easier John -- I don't think the 6 is readable|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Robinson played the 4, giving his own encouraging signal|pg||
nt|joest: on the general theory that declarer must adopt the defender's signalling methods|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: If Cohler does continue hearts, I think Robinson will have very good chances|pg||
nt|joest: the demonstrably correct theory|pg||
nt|athene: but with a lot of those hands partner was doubling 1@S rather than bidding 2@H|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|barnets: looked like an immediate 3@S|pg||
nt|barnets: may have worked better|pg||
nt|joest: so schwartz regains the lead|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  could be -2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barnets: both slams bid and made by n/s were flat|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: Just what will Berk discard on 4 rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|swanson: A good thing to remember is that, as declarer, you want to use the same signals the opponents use: low if you want LHO to continue, high to discourage.|pg||
nt|joest: north has shown up with 12 so Duboin might play south for the club kig|pg||
nt|joest: king|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: endplay, doesn't matter|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks like a good stop.  still have to find the @S Queen|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer guessed the diamonds well in the OR to escape for -1|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: Unfortunately Robinson chose to attack diamonds first -- now defense will be a lot easier|pg||
nt|barnets: he has a discard|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|kit: Now a diamond back, and no more pressure on West|pg||
nt|athene: the fourth club was a valuable threat against west but of course declarer did not know that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|joest: plus diamonds break when you work those first|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|hQ|nt|joest: yes a strip squeeze looms absent that|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: duboin thought about claiming when pachtmann took the heart|pg||

nt|wygbe1: huh?|pg||
nt|joest: what?|pg||
nt|joest: operator did Robinson endplay Berkowitz?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: west must have stiffed the diamond|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C a bit of an underbid here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C would get them to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  someone useful looking results coming up for NS in the OR|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20  here   if Cayne can keep out of trouble can have a pick up here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  chance for Cayne to get a few IMPs back|pg||
nt|athene: somewhat peculiar decision from south in the other room to pass over the 1@D overcall|pg||
nt|othered1: At the moment the Wagar final is closer than this match -- in a dead tie.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|joest: whatever happened, that was a big chance that got away|pg||
nt|barnets: here south is in 3N|pg||
mb|d|nt|bessi2: indeed.. 2@c would not be an option for me.. 2N or 3@c both look ok to me|pg||
nt|athene: it's interesting how you should play these clubs|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!s|nt|athene: bash from the top gains against QJ, Q9  or J9 falling|pg||
nt|barnets: on a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but finesse the 10 first is possible|pg||
nt|bessi2: depends on where you win the first trick perhaps.. if a small @d lead to the 7 then you don't really want to cross to dummy for that play|pg||
nt|athene: can't he bid his spades or something|pg||
nt|ady: 4 down in 3@H seems a lot|pg||
nt|joest: the big question there is: can west find the duck of the heart ten from dummy?|pg||
nt|othered1: Your action on south's hand?|pg||
nt|barnets: that is still just 8 tricks|pg||
nt|chorush: Aaron Haspel has suggested an improvement to declarers line in 6H which seems right to me. Play 2 rounds of trumps leaving the heart Q in dummy then run the club J. If clubs are ...|pg||
nt|chorush: indeed 5-1 the way they were but the opponent with the singleton has only 2 trumps, you will still make it. This seems to give up nothing except rho having 6 clubs and you still ...|pg||
nt|chorush: have chances then|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes bidding 1@s seems normal|pg||
nt|barnets: 9 if he ducks it !!|pg||
nt|joest: i think I would guess 3NT|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|joest: and declarer works it out|pg||
nt|othered1: I like south's pass, even vulnerable.  Just a crap shoot whether partner can use those @H effectively and current methods don't allow for that investigation.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you have the @C9|pg||
nt|joest: so the Israelis are playing for far lower stakes|pg||
nt|barnets: well 3@S is down a trick|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bessi2: hmmm.. a mute point since clearly 3N will be played from the south side :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this looks gin on that lead|pg||
nt|athene: if you have the @C9 then you bash them from the top|pg||
nt|athene: gaining against 3-3 or Qx or Jx|pg||
nt|athene: or singleton honour if you have the 8 as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: on this lead you can set up the hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: a good swing likely for schwartz|pg||
nt|athene: an interesting hand - my guess is he will just bash out three rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests he might go for 3 diamonds and 3 spades|pg||
nt|athene: but the diamonds are a bit blocked|pg||
nt|athene: sure he can lose one and then finesse against the honour-8|pg||
nt|athene: but he is short of entries to hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed.. it the 6 and 7 of @d were reversed that would work|pg||
nt|barnets: on 58 cayne also were down but down 2 in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|joest: the third and final no trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@H +3@s+2@C+1@D IF YOU PLAY ON HEARTS FIRST|pg||
nt|barnets: where we saw the clubs misgueesed|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: i'm getting a lot of questions about what happened at the end onthelast hand.  Operator can you clear it up by any chance?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Sementa led a low @d from Kx and declarer guessed everything wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: Declarer took a heart finesse and lost an extra trick|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|bessi2: Kranyak had thought for some time.. certainly about the club play we have been discussing|pg||
nt|roswolf: going for the clubs|pg||
nt|joest: Some norths would rebid 2@c, then over south's 2@h would bid 2@s|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|joest: that bid is pretty delicate though|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec in 6@H on same lead of trump on 59 Duboin playing the hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|loe48: i think 2c rebid is correct|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|barnets: he did not duck the @H in the open|pg||
nt|barnets: yes it is strange dec did not use his 2 entries|pg||
nt|barnets: to fin clubs|pg||
nt|joest: so they may well go down 1 and push this board|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: I prefer that auction, but I don't know the NS methods enough to know if that was available|pg||
pc|h9|nt|barnets: as if he knew it was wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: somehow|pg||
nt|joest: right ed.  I don't either|pg||
pc|c8|nt|joest: Sorry folks.  I haven't been successful in finding out what happened|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s might be going down now|pg||
nt|ady: down now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  give East a @c ruff|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West can cash the @sK and exit safely with a @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East rather can cash the @sK and exit with a @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  after making the club ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: That auction: 2@C rebid by north|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|joest: Pachtman can make this only if Kx of clubs is in the slot|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|joest: so he will take the heart hook|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|c2|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|cQ|pc|h5|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: That's my guess too, but no one has asked or explained|pg||

nt|bessi2: Schwartz superior judgment with that 3@c bid earned his side 10 imps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  7 IMPs back|pg||
nt|ady: still the gap closed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  another chance for Cayne|pg||
nt|athene: west should surely have redoubled 2@D in the other room rather than bidding 2@H|pg||
nt|othered1: was there a case for taking the @C finesse at trick 2?|pg||
nt|joest: while you had the entries.  It seems to me, yes|pg||
nt|loe48: deffinately should finesse club trick 2 imo|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bessi2: or at least his judgment was superior result wise|pg||
nt|athene: firstly he has equal length majors|pg||
nt|athene: secondly it will be worth a bit for east to be declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: both to conceal the strength and to have the lead run up to the stronger hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: hmmm, 5@C might be preferable to 4@H here|pg||
nt|ady: e/w out  of trouble|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  many pairs do not have a penalty X of a strong 1NT available|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: what was 2@C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|joest: it would be nice if 3@c were forcing opposite a passed hand but i don't think it is|pg||
nt|joest: that leaves the 'agricultural' 3NT call i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: on board 60 it was a correct claim of 3nt making|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H needs hearts 3-3 onside|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C might make even on 4-2 hearts, as long as the king is right|pg||
nt|roswolf: i like 5@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  assume @c and another|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: we believe you operator.  WE just don't know how|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 3n by east down on h lead, but 3n by west should make|pg||
nt|joest: b/c hearts block|pg||
nt|kit: big chance for swing here -- 5@C cold, as is 3NT by West|pg||
nt|joest: maybe 3@c should be forcing |pg||
nt|joest: this hand would talk me into it|pg||
nt|wygbe1: they could try 6c, down |pg||
nt|athene: even on a bad break you have extra chances, like @DQx or a red squeeze|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:  DONT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north passed assuming it was clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i guess|pg||
nt|athene: it could have been meckwell i.e. clubs and a major|pg||
nt|ady: is there not a rule with a limited hand  not to bid again opposite a passing partner?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: that is also possible|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMMM another lapse by the normally impeccable italians|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: wrong-sided now|pg||
nt|wygbe1: uh oh, wrongsided nt|pg||
nt|kit: And I would expect Boyd to choose his stronger suit to lead|pg||
nt|joest: of course 3@c now is forcing but it suggests spade shortness.  Berkowitz with an impossible bidding problem in standard (imho)|pg||
nt|kit: unless 2@H was real|pg||
nt|swanson: Tough for South to find a heart lead, expecting four hearts at his left.|pg||
nt|athene: yuck to 3@S in both rooms|pg||
nt|roswolf: south may kick himself|pg||
nt|joest: the cards don't lie as well this time as they did on  41|pg||
nt|barnets: no not at all|pg||
nt|barnets: He won trump cashed a second high trump|pg||
nt|barnets: and ran the @Cj|pg||
nt|barnets: the def cant beat him now|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 2 sure entries to his hand|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: 4333 hands are unspeakably evil|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that perhaps it was west who bid 2@D|pg||
nt|barnets: the @HQ and spase ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west who bid 2@C, sorry|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: the best u will attain with 3@S is to go -100 in 3@S two off vs -130 defending clubs|pg||
nt|athene: to gain 1 imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes but love all is a good time for competing the partscore|pg||
nt|athene: and decided to pass 2@D before the opponents woke up and brought out the axe|pg||
nt|othered1: does 2N feel conservative to you?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: berkowitz hopes his 2@h call at least served to ward off a heart lead|pg||
nt|joest: and it did|pg||
nt|kit: LC says natural, so will lead spade|pg||
nt|kit: and match is very close again with 2 more boards -- and 63 won't be dull|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the worst - well let's not think about it|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has had too much red meat|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure I would call it a lapse.. VERY difficult to bid|pg||
nt|barnets: so 6@H made|pg||
nt|barnets: and maybe that is the best line|pg||
nt|barnets: thats why he is such a great player|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: survived here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we will find out in a minute I hope if the bidding is wrong|pg||
pc|hA|nt|swanson: This hand is a demostration of how difficult it is to 'settle' for minor suit games when 3NT is a possibility.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: it's easier at imps b/c you don't get punished for being in five of a minor instead of 3NT if they bothmake|pg||
nt|joest: in a bidding contest, 5@c is the top spot here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C does seems strange from south|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we have confirmation that the bidding is correct|pg||
nt|joest: mildly yes but it's white|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|barnets: 3n did finally go down 1|pg||
pc|h8|nt|barnets: so was a flat board|pg||
pc|h6|nt|loe48: not really, flat hand |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bessi2: the bidding progressed in the same manner in the open room until that 4@c bid where proojinen bid 4@h, probably because their 1@h opening is often only 4 cards I beliee|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|barnets: he would only go down if west would give his partner a club ruff|pg||
pc|s2|nt|loe48: i think 2nt is okay|pg||
nt|joest: must have gone down 1|pg||
nt|joest: 2|pg||
nt|joest: b/c it is scored as a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: such an unexpected result that it crashed the room|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: hmm north cant believe south has 4 card support and passed over 2@S|pg||
nt|joest: there was a crash of the table in the other room I understand|pg||

nt|athene: well east could see the 5-2 fit might be ok if his pd has two spades and a doubleton heart honour|pg||
nt|athene: if they play std count south has to have four? wouldn't raise on two would he|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2 BDS LEFT AND SCHEDULED RESTART IS IN 15 MINS|pg||
nt|roswolf: any problem bruce?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Kranyak left table gone for more red meat:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: back|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  both sides were applying the principle that nobody is vulnerable you should bid... because if you go down you go dwon in 50s|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yorkbeach:  when nobody is vulnerable|pg||
nt|joest: so there is no score period|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: assuming undoubled|pg||
nt|joest: at least in cyberspace there isn't|pg||
nt|joest: so if it was down one it will be 3 imps for cayne and they now trail by one|pg||
nt|barnets: yes so it is|pg||
nt|joest: so low spade here is the only chance for Sementa to go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: hard to imagine that he will|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|sQ|mc|10|nt|vugraphzfg: or if north had both aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: or you're talking about the slam|pg||
nt|barnets: yes I am|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: lauria got a little risky in 4@h here|pg||
nt|barnets: there was a lot of discussion about it|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: he must have expected south to lead a stiff|pg||
nt|barnets: and cayne now has the match secure|pg||
nt|barnets: very strong play by both Italian pairs|pg||

nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|ady: -100   a bargain|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  match all square|pg||
nt|ady: now level|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yorkbeach:  could be exciting for those of you able to stay|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: Meckwell have arrived in 6@h on these cards at the other table|pg||
nt|roswolf: very competitive in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S is not such a bad contract for NS, is it?|pg||
nt|athene: especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is decent... 2 finesses, not to mention the very live possibility of a @d lead from the K|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3H|nt|athene: yes, diamond lead from the king is quite possible|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You only have to wait 2 hours|pg||
nt|athene: sementa had to pass in the other room because 2@C overcall would have been 5-4 majors?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And you can't even be certain that they will continue with this match|pg||
nt|athene: there is no end to the indignities the club suit has to endure these days :(|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  another solid looking result for Cayne in the OR|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: good 6@H contract here, reached in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  are they as slow having dinner as they are playing?|pg||
nt|athene: now east might cue to get to 4 of a major|pg||
nt|joest: tough rebid coming for East|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kit: Danger is getting too high -- they will certainly be in the slam|pg||
nt|wygbe1: seems they should reach it after this start|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: a good hand for 'serious 3NT"|pg||
nt|roswolf: well depending on the style of vul weak 2's i think 4@S is automatic here|pg||
nt|bessi2: I would just bid 4@s directly with the north hand.. |pg||
nt|roswolf: so would i|pg||
nt|othered1: vulnerability keeps north from a light t-o double|pg||
mb|5C!|an|1/4|nt|kit: Of course, 7@H can make -- and maybe it would out of desparation|pg||
nt|joest: playing that Boyd must cue bid a diamond control no matter how bad his hand|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n bids blackwood, will find out no diam king|pg||
nt|kit: 4@D is not a diamond control -- it is a last train sort of bid|pg||
nt|athene: the trouble with passing now is, what do you do when south bids 4@C?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe seamon is intending to double and defend|pg||
nt|athene: in view of his singleton diamond, and the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: An improbable spade lead would make 6@H difficult for declarer.|pg||
nt|athene: this won't work out well|pg||
nt|athene: now the @SK gets exposed|pg||
nt|barnets: west has a heart stopper in nt|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: when versace can't overruff|pg||
nt|bessi2: lol.. versace will drop his pd's K of @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 4@S is RKC|pg||
nt|joest: ic|pg||
nt|athene: wow, hasn't cayne just bid his hand a lot of times?|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c looks to be a transfer to 2@d with some invitational hand usually|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: not showing the void|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6@c + 1@d + 1 ruff = 800 in 4@c doubled if my counting is right|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he assumes from the NS bidding that his partner has a fit somewhere and some values|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure this will be dbled|pg||
nt|athene: but can't his partner bid his own hand?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  crazy to bid 5@h on a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|joest: so this is a straightforward diamond invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: :(|pg||
nt|barnets: the 6 spot is good|pg||
nt|joest: KJ of diamonds too good to pass up |pg||
pc|sK|nt|yorkbeach:  I wonder whether Larry Cohen is watching. |pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: of course declarer might just throw his diamond loser on the third club|pg||
nt|athene: and play for both kings onside|pg||
nt|barnets: lauria thinks of possible def|pg||
nt|barnets: but there is no real hope|pg||
nt|barnets: the next board will be the last |pg||
nt|barnets: so Congrats to the Cayne team |pg||
nt|barnets: very well played|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks dan for your excellent job and helpfull commentary|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: if clubs continued declarer might well divine the trump position|pg||
nt|athene: cayne bids his hand AGAIN|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Who said the 5-level belongs to the opponents? Ed Manfield and Ron Klinger, and they were absolutely right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  A 9-card fit one way and a 8-card fit the other does not saye both sides |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should be bidding at the five level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  say|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: but the failure to play the third club is itself suspicious|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so let's say double of 3@D just showed good diamonds, fine|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wygbe1: well done|pg||
nt|joest: a trump start seems best|pg||
nt|wygbe1: diam lead will probly speed up the play|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|joest: declarer will not relish hooking the diamond into south and seeing aheart back|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: best lead -- now declarer has problems|pg||
nt|kit: far from clear how this hand should be played|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson has to make it now to keep the lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer counts 5 hearts, 1 spade, 2 clubs, 2 diamonds - needs another two tricks.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: of course, west can also NOT overruff the third club with @SKxx, as a nice grosvenor|pg||
nt|athene: now 4@C says "i have 4-4-6-0 and a great hand"|pg||
nt|loe48: he will hood dia now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bessi2: now he can play the club throw the diamond and be sure |pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: now obvious:)|pg||
nt|athene: now if declarer hooks hearts first|pg||
nt|athene: he might decide that west would have bid with all he has AND the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: like a 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: fine|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: so where did he find 5@H?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  has anyone worked out how many IMPs West's 5@h has blown?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 14 or 15|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  was 800 on offer in 5@c X?|pg||
pg||

nt|roswolf: is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators William, David and Sigurdbjorn for their company and perceptive comments. Also to our specs whose ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it would seem he did|pg||
nt|Walddk4: he did Bruce says|pg||
nt|joest: thanks Dan, great job as operator btw|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks to jan Martel and ACBL for putting this wonderful show on for everybody|pg||
mb|1D|nt|joest: and that looks to be it|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: a great hand to end a great match on|pg||
nt|athene: sorry as a spec points out, even with the @SK west would not have a 2nt overcall but he might have a double|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: scheduled restart in 10 mins from now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Slip of the mind. Kranyak had it a certain 1 down |pg||
nt|barnets: along with BBO for making it all possinle|pg||
nt|barnets: possible|pg||
nt|barnets: and thanks to all the specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: for their comments|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  with 25 HCP and an 8-card @s fit NS should reach 4@s ... but stranger things have happened this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: look in tomorrow for the qurter finals|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yorkbeach:  like this 2@c overcall|pg||
nt|athene: north can't act over 2@C really|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a fan of the 2@C bid because it is just so likely to pre-empt your side out of spades or notrumps|pg||
nt|joest: this particular sequence is a dangerous one for standard pairs b/c it is easy to lose a 44 spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: weirdly, it can work out better to overcall very heavy at the 1-level as it's less likely to end things|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  indeed - prefer X or 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when the @H8 falls first round declarer has a guess which way to play for 4-1 trumps - he can pick either up|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: even rolling this would not be good enough so congratulations to the Spector team|pg||
nt|joest: and thanks to all the players for a great match|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: e.g. after a 1@C opener you can overcall 1@D on almost anything as it never gets passed out|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  rattled perhaps by the previous board?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|joest: thanks operator|pg||
nt|ady: another swing for Cayne|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bessi2: good result for Schwartz in the open room.. 4@h seems like a very fragile contract|pg||
nt|athene: that is why the 8 is an obligatory falsecard from 108xx|pg||
nt|joest: Many players play suit preference here when partner is known to be leading shorntess|pg||
nt|barnets: spade is best now|pg||
nt|joest: that doesn't seem consistent with Sementa's 7 play though|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: not sure what the difference is between this and a simple 4@H from east over 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@C asks if versace has a good hand, 2@D says "no" so lauria settles for game|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe he knew|pg||
nt|barnets: now def can make a spade nd a second heart|pg||
nt|barnets: dont need any ruffs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yorkbeach:  I have a simple rule that if the hand is too strong for a 1NT overcall, it is too strong for a suit overcall|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: lauria has played with versace for 20 years and versace has never had extras, but lauria is hopeful there will be a first time|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|joest: thanks also to Kit, John and Jim|pg||
nt|barnets: unless endplay comes|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|barnets: which it will|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzfg: sry too fast N a little upset!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What do you bid over 2@D if you double?|pg||
nt|ady: OR  same opening 1@H   but double from south|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: S I mean|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yorkbeach:  3@c I guess|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  having a night off tomorrow - will see some of you on Saturday no doubt|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|bessi2: kranyak will surely play a spade now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: commentator's curse|pg||
nt|athene: another obligatory falsecard to give a guess:- south drops the 8 from @HA108x there when declarer leads to the king|pg||
nt|bessi2: hmm... don't see why he wanted to open up either minor|pg||
nt|bessi2: why he would want to that is|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bessi2: A spec suggests that Kranyak may have interpreted his pd's 3 of @s as suit preferance|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bessi2: preference|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: versace fiddling around trying to find out which way trumps can be 4-1|pg||
nt|bessi2: declarer is on track and will make this|pg||
nt|athene: okie, he got it right|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|swanson: Yes, congratulations to the Spector team and condolences to the Washington team.  They played outstanding bridge for five days and were unlucky at the very end.|pg||
nt|bessi2: but why then not a higher club the 9 for instance, as many kibs suggest, I cannot say|pg||
nt|athene: this is tough |pg||
nt|barnets: still down 1|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: the normal play when you have Axxx trumps in defence is to hold up the ace at least once, usually twice|pg||
nt|bessi2: good duck by Schwartz|pg||
nt|bessi2: another heart play now is no good it seems|pg||
nt|bessi2: he must start diamonds now|pg||
nt|athene: now if versace plays another trump, Schwartz can play @HA, spade and versace can't get to dummy to draw the last trump|pg||
nt|bessi2: I think... I get headaches trying to analyse these sort of hands|pg||
nt|athene: ace and a diamond is a better shot for declarer but it still does not work; north just goes @DK, @HA, spade and again you can't get to dummy to draw the @H10|pg||
nt|bessi2: GIB says -1.. there we have it|pg||
nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
nt|athene: versace thinking about ways to endplay north to lead away from the @DK if he gets a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but it's all down one from here|pg||
nt|bessi2: if ace and another @d then Schartz can win cash ace of @h and play a spade I suppose|pg||
nt|ferlema: apurate porque estan haciendo los de lo seniors|pg||
nt|athene: let's see how it made in the other room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wygbe1: thx and gn all|pg||
nt|swanson: Thanks BBO.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|athene: interesting play from west in the other room, just not touching trumps for a long time|pg||
nt|joest: indeed|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: that worked out really well when he was able to cash many tricks without suffering a ruff|pg||
nt|bessi2: wait.. if now a spade.. then ruff home.. cash k of clubs and ace and another D right ?|pg||
nt|bessi2: just another trump ofc|pg||
nt|athene: ah, you can endplay north?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but the trump now works|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One trick short on a trump return|pg||
nt|athene: north just sits there with @DK and a cashing spade, basically|pg||
nt|athene: of course south has to keep his clubs|pg||
nt|bessi2: Schwartz will work this out I believe|pg||
nt|reisig: 100%|pg||
nt|bessi2: for a decent 22 imp lead|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out that north misdefended in the other room - he could have thrown his third diamond on the third round of clubs|pg||
nt|bessi2: but surely the next segment should have started by now :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They never penalise them anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this has been extremely slow|pg||
nt|athene: time penalties in bridge do seem ridiculously arbitrary and unclear|pg||
nt|athene: compared with chess :)|pg||
nt|athene: in chess, it's sort of clearcut :) of course technically much easier to implement|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2hrs 45 mins for 15.75 bds is excessive and they tool short breaks as well|pg||
nt|bessi2: especially difficult in knockout matches|pg||
nt|athene: as far as i can make out, the policy on slow play in bridge seems to be "don't do it or we will be cross, and we might penalize you, except we probably won't, unless we do, which ...|pg||
nt|athene: we probably won't"|pg||
nt|roswolf: quite easy pairs must be split for future segments|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in teams of 6, you could have a rule that the slow pairs have to sit out|pg||
nt|roswolf: playong in an unfamiliar pship for 16 bds would hurt:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed.. the schedule is more like guidelines in the knocout competitions at the nationals, which I like by the way|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I strongly disagree|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Time is part of the game|pg||
nt|joest: thanks all|pg||
pc|dT|nt|reisig: well ..almost 100%  :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with Roland here - disrupts the shedule for everyone else if a pair is too slow|pg||
nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|joest: thanks ed and barnet|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: well that has let the contract through according to GIB|pg||
nt|joest: and thanks to the specs|pg||
nt|barnets: tks all specs see you shortly|pg||
nt|joest: I think the next starts in about 20 minutes or so after the other table is done|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks everyone and bye for now.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: he needed to rise with the queen|pg||
nt|bessi2: disrupts nothing at this point.. since, if I am not mistaken, the same boards aren't being played in all matches|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some play better if they can think forever, and they should not be allowed to|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Else they must change the rules|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chorush: spade 5 still beats|pg||
