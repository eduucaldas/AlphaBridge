nt|bigtrain: it's not imo...  if the J were in any other suit i'd agree though|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Meckstroth's double of 2@D also seduced North in believing his singleton was big, knowing partner doesn't have much in Diamonds|pg||

nt|casenjo:  we do have a possible swing board coming up, so stay tuned|pg||

nt|gambit: neat play , though delaying the inevitable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have operated for Meckwell agst various opps many times |pg||
nt|casenjo:  VERY TRUE!  If I played poorly, he only found kind things to say.  If I played well, he said nothing, which is often best.  When we finished very high in a Men's event (while married), I asked him, "Why are you such a wonderful partner and such |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting dynamic,  calm, pleasant, intense, fun in many ways |pg||
