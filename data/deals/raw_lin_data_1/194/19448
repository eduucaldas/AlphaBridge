nt|Vugraphzfc: there is an issue with the hands because it is not the right hands give me a moment to resolve please|pg||
nt|gambit: 38 imp difference, 32 boards left,,expect some fireworks |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Meckwell has lots of experience grinding out come from behind victories|pg||
nt|gambit: indeed|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi everybody|pg||
nt|jpes: its lauria and versace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hi all the match has begun but there is an issue with the hands so please stop asking me to change the names of the players i will do it thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator, the spelling of the N-S names are not accurate|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Lauria|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Versace|pg||
nt|gambit: not exactly the meek vs. the meek, more like battle of the titans|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|daman: here we go|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Krishna|pg||
nt|ady: if Katz has a natural 2@D opening South might try 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: Welcome to the 3rd quarter of the Spingold final|pg||
nt|joest: from Toronto|pg||
nt|joest: welcome back all|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|daman: fantunes are at the other table    they are slow players|pg||
nt|joest: hello everybody and welcome to the final 16 boards of the 2011 Spingold in Toronto|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  No problem with the names, just pretend the 'n's are 'r's|pg||
nt|daman: and we're off and pacing|pg||
nt|chthonic: NS might get overboard.|pg||
nt|ady: will fail |pg||
nt|kareno: Specs, for this fourth quarter of the 2011 Spingold, we are privileged to watch two of the premier pairs of the world of bridge.|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c = Precision 11-15 6+clubs|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|casenjo:  Welcome to 3rd quarter of Spingold Semi-Finals|pg||
nt|joest: Zia proving that 3rd seat nonvulnerable is not 100% forcing: even on him|pg||
nt|joest: with 11 highs and only a spade stiff, Zimmerman will toss this back in|pg||
nt|daman: I think that the next cycle begins with the 2012 Spingold Jack|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/component/content/article/2-latest-news/988-hamman-joins-new-team-for-next-cycle|pg||
nt|joest: One common rule of thumb in fourth seat: add your HCP + your   of spades.  If 15 or more, open.  If not, pass|pg||
nt|daman: not enough pearson points to open|pg||
nt|joest: Nickell starts down 15 but they have come from behind to win the fourth quarter of both their last two matches|pg||
nt|kareno: Jack :)|pg||
nt|joest: hey karen|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT asks but is intended here as obfuscation|pg||
nt|joest: as West well knows|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: ok, color me surprised :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|daman: that is quite a view     to pass 2@D|pg||
nt|chthonic: But not -- south did not overreact to his "points"|pg||
nt|psyck: Not the suit I'd like for a 1st seat weak 2, buf normal 2@d NV i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hi again to Cam and Walter|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Terry, Walter and Cam|pg||
nt|gambit: hi Jo....|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C shows 8+ minors over 1@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they can be 53 either way even|pg||
nt|chthonic: worked.  Was not making 3N|pg||
nt|ady: Nickell decided not enough ace  even if diamonds run  especially on a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: 4@S from Eric, what else|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|gambit: look at Meck's raise!|pg||
nt|gambit: indeed|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Rodwell just might eek out 8 tricks........|pg||
nt|gambit: Zia might not make 5@D* off three toppers|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe even 9|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello again|pg||
nt|joest: then correct 3@hto 3@s (possibly) or raise 3@s to 4|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gambit: :)|pg||
nt|gambit: ok now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is art GF|pg||
nt|joest: the theory is: either you partner has spades (which will force you to rebid which is bad) or the opponents have spades and can outbid you so your cheapest exit is passing right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Hi Jo Anne|pg||
nt|gambit: delaying the inevitable|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT shows 9 minors with a singleton spade|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest: 4@c a spade raise with shortness which will prompt a fast signoff|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Meckwell play a hyperactive style and create huge problems like this for their opponents|pg||
nt|joest: now Fantoni definitly enough to kick it in|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: well bid hand    this should make on the nose|pg||
nt|psyck: with @c33, only 1 loser in each suit|pg||
nt|chthonic: Would seem to be  making, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: George points out that the change will not take place until next year's spingold so Zia-Hamman will still play the REisinger and Vanderbilt this year|pg||
nt|daman: they need to get a @D trick before the @Cs are set up to beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  this will only make on a non-@H lead|pg||
nt|gambit: Can N lead a heart? |pg||
nt|gambit: no....|pg||
nt|joest: his partner was too good to just reopen with 2@s after double so Fantoni has a clear raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: even overtrick if @s trick dissappears|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT -2 is better than -140|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gambit: will make it now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|casenjo:  Hamman would have overcalled 1@H, he loves those good 4 card suits,, but unfortunately, he is sitting North|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: hiall|pg||
nt|joest: hi geoffrey|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kareno: Nothing much to the play.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is visible without login via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|joest: hi al|pg||
nt|joest: Nunes suspects that Meck has 'a king' but which king?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|peachy: Nickell luck is on|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|daman: great shift|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|joest: not that king|pg||

nt|joest: hi John|pg||

nt|peachy: Heart lead just does not seem right, quite normal not to|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|joest: so Nunes is home free now|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|chthonic: whatever the details, it won't be much of a swing -- small score to EW in both rooms likely.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c3|pc|dQ|nt|ady: should be able to place K@H with North|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: south has shown up with a lot already|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|ady: can make an overtrick by finessing hearts and playing 3rd heart|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|daman: he is teasing us by not cashing the @D King|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@C is 11-15 so N sould have had KKK@CA|pg||
nt|granguru:  could*|pg||
pc|c7|nt|daman: wow|pg||

nt|ritong: hello there|pg||
nt|casenjo:  hi, Henri @H|pg||
nt|joest: well done|pg||
nt|joest: diamond shift as well as diamond underlead|pg||
nt|chthonic: Could not have anticipated that line.|pg||
nt|ady: start with 4 imps to Nickell   so all square|pg||
nt|chthonic: So, four IMPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam possible here|pg||
nt|joest: 4@s really went off one in the other room?|pg||
nt|granguru:  but in such a case lead would have been @CA..so most probable N had other 2 kings|pg||
nt|joest: Nickell has come behind in each of the last two matches in the fourth quarter but not starting that way|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|daman: he took so long he fell asleep|pg||
nt|joest: east-west may do a lot of bidding here but their hands are 'mirroors"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=10-13 HCP, 5+@D, unbal  [6@D=unbal]|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: bsr henri|pg||
nt|daman: time for a slam|pg||
nt|joest: mirrors|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|joest: Zia for once at the top|pg||
nt|daman: that will change|pg||
nt|chthonic: self-hypnosis?|pg||
nt|joest: so they will need to pick up hearts and hve the club hook work as well|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@D is in fact 9-13 in 1st and 2nd position|pg||
nt|joest: Nunes Fantoni play a unique system where all their one bids (except 1NT) are unlimited and forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: Al is our systems encyclopedia :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  6@D mainly in third and 4th|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: range? Where is Al Holland when you need him?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 5+@D GF|pg||
nt|daman: hey don't play well unless they are 40-50 behind|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont think slam will be bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  if a real weak 2|pg||
mb|r|nt|peachy: Hi Henri|pg||
nt|joest: 6NT is best b/c it can make even if hearts do not come home|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 2NT probably a club transfer|pg||
nt|daman: Sominex Coup|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Walddk5: 15-17|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is waiting|pg||
nt|joest: in some partnerships, 4@c now by south shows 4 clubs + 3 hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: HH|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: but we'll see how they do it|pg||
nt|daman: trump|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@H shows 12+ nf|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h an artificial ask and I suspect redouble asked for further description, particularly a heart stopper|pg||
nt|joest: NF on four small?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ady: hardly expect a heart lead here|pg||
nt|psyck: W could have tried more on 2@d, but settled for 2@h NV|pg||
nt|granguru:  u are right it is a relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jack is right  2@H=RELAY,  INV+|pg||
nt|granguru:  they use a relay over all 2 opening with next suit|pg||
nt|granguru:  y sorry ..|pg||
nt|joest: unless they skip a beat, they are headed for a pretty boring 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: at this point Hamman would like to use double roman key card for hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gambit: J@S lead after that auction |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Roddy knows Jeff is broke|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.archiviobridge.it/lauria-versace.pdf  NS card. It is a WBF card but surely they havvent changed much|pg||
nt|casenjo:  For those non-Precision people, please read Bigtrain's commentary for perfect explanations|pg||
nt|tez: 8 of @s great card:)|pg||
nt|gambit: assuming E/W can unblock the clubs, this is an easy defeat |pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, and we see it went down in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: but i don't know if they play that|pg||
nt|joest: he just cares about aces, the heart king, and the round queens|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: ace lead from AKx(x); meck's signal is standard|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hi Walter|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi joanne|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a diamond  cash K@C  and ruff a club  and ruff a diamond with A@H|pg||
nt|daman: Rodwell bid 2NT over 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: thats 6 tricks    then play 4th club and discard a spade|pg||
nt|chthonic: As would I.|pg||
nt|chthonic: But they are playing Precision, so it would be less likely to do so for them.|pg||
nt|chthonic: I would think|pg||
nt|daman: they always scratch for a makeable game|pg||
nt|chthonic: Can trick two be so hard?|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, E's hand more likely to be lighter other room than this room, that did not stop Rodwell from inviting |pg||
nt|chthonic: Ace of D, ruff, cash KC, maybe play another club and pitch a spade, ....|pg||
nt|daman: look how long he took on the last one|pg||
nt|joest: Helgemo and Helness obviously open four card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: that looks like two + a queen|pg||
nt|joest: some pairs have steps that distinguish which queen, or whether both queens|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|peachy: Glad to have Walter here, he knows Meckwell system |pg||
nt|gambit: puts terror into the heart of the declarer, he doesn't know E can't get the lead...|pg||
nt|casenjo:  for the hundres watching 'bigtrain' was my first bridge teacher at Ohio State|pg||
nt|gambit: wow...nice to have such a mentor|pg||
nt|ady: good evening all|pg||
nt|granguru:  I was mistaken because i play a modified fantunes system where relay over 2D and majors is 2N |pg||
nt|joest: that's a mistake any of us could make :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: this sounds like it could be to play|pg||
nt|joest: 6@c is still safer than 6@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: THE NORSEMEN ARE FEARLESS|pg||
nt|joest: good evening David|pg||
nt|ady: hi Jack|pg||
nt|joest: i'm downloading their card from the net now|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w are very aggressive - and light openings are common|pg||
pc|h3|nt|casenjo:  I'm happy with the results :)|pg||
nt|daman: six key card that shows @C Q and not @H Q|pg||
nt|joest: thanks George|pg||
nt|roswolf: you should see some hands they have opened!|pg||
nt|ady: not a great slam    duplicated shape      but will come home|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|joest: he might even just claim to save time for the hard hands |pg||
nt|granguru:  rodwell meckstroth play a udca style of signaling...all encouraging in inverted way--|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|psyck: This will probably be the last set these two pairs play, with the other two pairs finishing the final two sets|pg||
mc|10|nt|gambit: nice lead, and fortuitous break. Wd by Roddy |pg||
nt|peachy: Rodwell might/might not be having discard trouble soon\|pg||
nt|gambit: Declarer fantazing about Kx@D onside allowing contract to make, but not today|pg||
nt|bigtrain: won't have much of a problem|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Was Meckstroth's 9@H a spade indicator?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  If so, Eric can safely pitch a spade|pg||

nt|granguru:  maybe I didnt express myself well....low is encouraging in all posible situations|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gambit: no doubt Jeff and Eric are hoping for more shapely and imaginative hands|pg||
nt|joest: one questin to discuss with your partner if you play Drury:  is 2@c drury here or natural?|pg||
nt|joest: Meck's 2@c rebid shows four but his minor suit lengths are still ambiguous|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Double again?|pg||
nt|ady: did well to get our for down 1 in 3@H|pg||
nt|chthonic: Sure.  have to compete.|pg||

nt|chthonic: even favorable vul|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt most likely ending to the auction.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|granguru:  count, attitude, preference, smith and surrogate|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: seems NS should have had a way to bid 3C non-aggressively -- a version of Good-bad, for example?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|joest: 3@d seems sort of straightforward but some pairs play that must be fit-showing by a passed hand in which case I guess you have to do something else|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cards lay that this should make|pg||
nt|joest: yes the hammer was awaiting in 4 :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|casenjo:  remember last quarter? they gained 20 in 2 boards|pg||
nt|gambit: no...venturing too high |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Patience can be a virtue.....running out of patience can be a disaster|pg||
nt|joest: anyway: a great chance for Nickell to be plus at both tables|pg||

nt|daman: idgebase.com/index.php|pg||
nt|daman: for those who want the audio|pg||
nt|joest: Hamman may 'guess' the heart king solely bbecaus he wants to avoid a spade ruff if he loses to the king|pg||
nt|joest: note that having raised Zia leadshigh from three to clue his partner in to the fact that he has nothing in diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: not the greatest contract i have seen|pg||
nt|roswolf: north knows that already:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: with north known to be two suited it would not amaze me to see Helness start the @hQ out of his hand|pg||

nt|roswolf: but a fair point|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck: Good - Bad does not apply in this seq, it is when RHO makes a 2 level bid|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D   down 2   might have got 300   with sing. club on lead|pg||
nt|joest: things don't split so well here|pg||
nt|granguru:  fantoni nunes play slavinsky defensive leads|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gambit: he want to lead a heart but can't from that holding|pg||
nt|joest: of course from his point of view that is conceding going down unless he drops the king|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gambit: hmmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup david|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Nice lead by Jeff Meckstroth|pg||
nt|gambit: that helps the def|pg||
nt|joest: 2 diamonds + 2 clubs + 1 heart + 1 spade|pg||
nt|joest: not to mention that the heart length cuts his communicaton with dummy at trick one|pg||
pc|hK|nt|casenjo:  Zia ran off his clubs and managed 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gambit: how will Zia make that? He must be swinging (as predicted) already |pg||
nt|casenjo:  On Board 34, sorry|pg||
nt|bigtrain: E pitched3 spades which squeezes W in 3 suits|pg||
nt|granguru:  that is small from xx xxxx Hxx  Hxxxx Hxxxxxx|pg||
nt|bigtrain: sorry putting kids to bed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: they keep playing 1 level lower than the OR at this table   they need to compete and push the opps up|pg||
nt|joest: yeah I think Zia's 3@d was predicated on a hope his opponents might bail him out|pg||
pc|c4|nt|casenjo:  correct|pg||
nt|gambit: q@D|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hamman zia never exposed south's distribution so the defense was guessing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: defenders cant attack spades with any success  and a club trick can be set up for a discard   though Katz can ruff the 3rd club  but that is with his trump trick|pg||
pc|h2|nt|granguru:  except 10 where they lead hi with 10x|pg||
pc|s2|nt|casenjo:  The auction more or less gave the hand away, but now, you need the guts to underlead your Ace|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2nt shows 9 minors with a singleton in responders major|pg||
nt|joest: so 3-1-5-4 or 3-1-4-5|pg||
nt|granguru:  some exceptions where finesse are involved: low with kj92 q1082 they lead the 2|pg||
nt|joest: well the uber-straightforward play is to cash the heart and play for luck in @ds|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chthonic: As it is written, but I play it on in this sequence -- you can make it work.|pg||
nt|daman: gonna beat it 1 if he plays anything but a @S|pg||
nt|psyck: oh, you meant 3@c by S on 2@h, yes that would fit in GB, i thought you meant when N's turn|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes.... |pg||
pc|h9|nt|chthonic: ah...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: gag|pg||
nt|granguru:  surrogate signals are those made in a different suit reflecting a situation regarding a critical suit|pg||
nt|kareno: Nine calling spades I suppose.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|casenjo:  On the auction NOrth is marked with 5-4-4|pg||
nt|chthonic: no, I meant by south, correct|pg||
nt|ady: no sorry   of course wrong   no club can be set up|pg||
pc|d5|nt|daman: snatched defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: Fantoni still has to be worried Meck has a five card club suit|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|casenjo:  1-5-4-3 is possible, but not likely without having shown a big hand|pg||
nt|gambit: I remember playing Barry Crane in Cobo Hall in Detroit, 1978/79 and we were killing them after 3 boards, I prayed for 4 banal, simplistic hands, alas my prayers were answered, but ...|pg||

nt|granguru:  for instance dummy has a long suit and no side entries..KQJxxxx. declarer plays trumps before playing this suit..how to know if you take in second position your ace at once or at second round? if you use trump spots to signal this side suit|pg||

nt|daman: if partner has the @S Ace it will never go away    if he has the @S K    you are letting them make|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c was a reasonable contract, needed @sA right or a long neck|pg||
nt|joest: now is 2NT here a strong NT or the minors?|pg||
nt|joest: it varies from partnership to partnership|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggression is the hallmark of the norsemen|pg||
nt|joest: and I can't tell what Zia intends on this one!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|daman: they don't play Sandwich NT I assume :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: he could have cashed the fifth heart so long as he cashed the spade ace first|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gambit: I did not play WITH Barry, folow the postedlink, I played against him and Mike Smolen |pg||
nt|joest: no and fewer and fewer expert pairs do|pg||
nt|daman: yes    |pg||
nt|daman: but it has it's place with those trying to learn the game|pg||
nt|joest: in these days you can get stolen blind.  You need something to protect yourself although admittedly you always take a chance coming in the sandwich seat|pg||
nt|ady: a little high to come in at the 4 level?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: looked the unusual variety|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: 4@C is straight from hunger with no fit for partner|pg||

nt|joest: did 1@s show anything extra?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|casenjo:  ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE, NOW GONE|pg||
nt|joest: with the ace of diamonds only doubleton, it won't be possible to stop 7 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: can always beat 5@C  by cashing A@S  and playing a heart |pg||
nt|chthonic: Spade Ace then heart looks right, is right.|pg||
nt|joest: yes but a bit tough to reach|pg||
nt|roswolf: ultra tough|pg||
nt|ady: also 4@S makes|pg||

pc|h3|nt|daman: and maybe an endplay for 8|pg||
nt|joest: note Zia leads low in case stiff ace is onside|pg||
nt|joest: precisely|pg||
nt|kareno: 3 spades I assume|pg||
pc|hT|nt|daman: easy defense to beat this   Cash the @S Ace  over to a @H   @S ruff|pg||
nt|psyck: E had no @h wastage, & bidding markd pd with short @h's, so all pd's cards should fit well, so I think 4@c bid was ok|pg||

nt|joest: that is a big bid!|pg||
nt|joest: I think Zia will just shoot out 6@h|pg||

nt|roswolf: great minds think alike:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I think it's courageous to think about balancing|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: double here in modern parlance is just "I have extra values and no clear cut call"|pg||

nt|psyck: Nickell can buy my id from me|pg||

nt|joest: let's see where a forcing pass takes him|pg||
nt|kareno: Thinking isn't the courageous part - doing it is :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|chthonic: Katz still thinking??  Why|pg||
mb|3D|nt|daman: gag|pg||
nt|chthonic: oh, no|pg||

nt|joest: Helgemo and Hellness defended that last hand well.  I believe Monaco is in a position to make 3@c right now in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: the forcing pass is akin to hiding away ready to spring to slam if pard shows any sign of life:)|pg||

nt|daman: nah    they want to be in game and not defending|pg||
nt|joest: anyway Hamman didn't want to wait around to find out|pg||
nt|joest: random unbiddable spot cards can affect that kind of result|pg||
nt|daman: plus   he LOVES to play 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: i'm being told it goes 800 on a trump promo which looks right.  That is still a random result and Hamman has a lifetime experience of whether it's worth passing 2@s at these colors|pg||
nt|daman: he will play the King   and finesse a @S|pg||
nt|chthonic: ......................|pg||
nt|daman: I can't believe North's bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: 6@c=2 key cards without trump Q|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psyck: 6@h asks for 3rd round @h control for 7@s|pg||
nt|daman: in the old days      and even now        4@H would always be the last bid|pg||
nt|chthonic: what a debacle.|pg||
nt|ady: got everything right to make 11 tricks in spades OR|pg||
nt|ady: cant accuse north of fielding a psche|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|bigtrain: its a forced shift since he knows @C pitches coming|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Board 53 narrowed the gap even more.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  We now have a mere 7 IMP match|pg||
nt|chthonic: my goodness.... opportunities flying about the table and on one picked any up.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: no one|pg||
nt|chthonic: could have picked up six IMPs improbably, but felt relieved, I imagine to have avoided a major loss.|pg||
nt|kareno: I would expect a push board here.|pg||
nt|joest: a classic 33 highs.  Just what were taught to have for 6NT|pg||
nt|frusco: 2@h|pg||
nt|granguru:  1@C might be bal 15-17 or 23+ or 14+ with @c|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|gambit: all true|pg||
nt|joest: uh no|pg||
nt|joest: Helness raised to 2@s on a lot less a few hands ago|pg||
nt|joest: of course he was nonvulnerable|pg||
nt|joest: i guess the only risk would be getting too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: note that Hamman has both majors for his double.  I sometimes see newer players double with only one major here|pg||
nt|joest: looks like a trick got away in the open room in 4@c|pg||
nt|joest: ace and a spade looks like a likely suspect|pg||
nt|joest: what would you bid here George?|pg||
nt|daman: @D Q was led|pg||
nt|daman: I would cuebid|pg||
nt|chthonic: After that excitement, the players have to calm down and play each hand as if it were the only one that matters.  No matter how mundane.|pg||
nt|joest: let's take a look at this again operator|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT = 10+ HCP 5-3-3-2|pg||
nt|granguru:  a 1NT nat opening in this case|pg||
nt|joest: with one of the majors being the five card suit|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|daman: 2NT must be some form of Dormer limit raise|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT by some pairs here is "four card limit raise"|pg||
nt|daman: no support double as you can see|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|gambit: OK, here is a wild one....what bridge player was rescued by his uncle "Bugsy Seigal" after falling into the family pool?|pg||
nt|ady: going overboard again|pg||
nt|psyck: I would not make a supp x with E's hand even playing supp x|pg||
nt|daman: neither would I|pg||
nt|psyck: Need better than a 4333 min hand for it|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, too flat a hand.  Support doubles should not be played mandatory -- judgment counts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: on an equivalent auction at the other table, north bid 4@c|pg||
nt|joest: i don't know what 4@c is|pg||
nt|kareno: Maybe hearts?|pg||
nt|joest: I am told that it is five hearts with game forcing values|pg||
nt|joest: If you folks can slow it down a second that would be good.  My computer is lighting up like a Christmas tree :)|pg||
mb|6N|nt|casenjo:  Wow and just told only a 2 imp difference in the other match with 10 boards to go|pg||
nt|gambit: the player in blue jeans was a friend, Doug Fox|pg||
nt|gambit: indeed Soloway it was|pg||
nt|joest: turns out 3@d can't make|pg||
nt|daman: as did hamman|pg||
nt|daman: but they have 4 losers|pg||
nt|joest: if they cash them|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: Meck?|pg||
nt|joest: that didn't prove so easy in the open room|pg||
nt|daman: but I wouldn't have bid 4@C with the west hand on board 20 either|pg||
nt|ady: very nice lay for e/w   can make 11 trricks in spades|pg||
nt|joest: hmmm|pg||
nt|joest: wonder if there was an upper limit on 4@c|pg||
nt|kareno: Mad leaps to slam bar partner in my systems.  Let's see ...|pg||
nt|joest: it's just that 6NT seems like an abrupt end for this pair :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 4@C = 5@H, 15+ HCP  [hope that hasn't been mentioned already]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C was a RELAY|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: W reached for 7NT, but balked|pg||
nt|joest: well if its "+" how can Fantoni have any confidence that they can't make more than six?|pg||
nt|kareno: May I take a base?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: all runners advance|pg||
nt|kareno: Sorry, I've been to five baseball games in the past week :)|pg||
nt|joest: I'm getting lots of folks telling me what the bids mean|pg||
nt|joest: Ironically Nunes and Fantoni don't seem sure :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Fantoni seems sure|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@C asking |pg||
nt|joest: well Nunes has touched the 7NT card once already|pg||
nt|kit: I know what 7NT will likely mean -- lose 17|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  2@H is a friendly little contract with 3-3 hearts and 3-3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 5 IMPs riding on it|pg||
nt|joest: this was the start next door, followed by ace and a spade|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@H would have been min any major|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm a big Blue Jays fan.  We have their AAA club in Las Vegas, the 51's|pg||
nt|joest: well the play won't take as long as the auction|pg||
pc|dT|nt|daman: East hand *|pg||
nt|chthonic: Orttman would do well here...|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@c is max with 5@H 4@D is max with 4@S|pg||
nt|granguru:  max meaning 15+|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gambit: Doug asked Ron if he he borrow thelighter...|pg||
nt|daman: if He leads the @S Ace    he can make|pg||
nt|ady: even 4@C can go down|pg||
nt|roswolf: the norsemen wield the axe|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: and in fairness to West if a low spade comes back, a spade return (for a possible ruff) looks more appealing than leading away from the heart king|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gambit: after Ron denied permission I guess Doug did notheng, no idea|pg||
nt|daman: yes it does|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gambit: @D through|pg||
nt|casenjo:  An interesting note, that applies to this match. Paul Soloway once said, "The average hand is a partial, the average hand is boring, the average hand I have played too many times to count...concentrating on ALL the hands is winning bridge"|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gambit: the words of a champion and gentleman, brb|pg||
nt|ritong: in fact the trick is to recognize quickly the hands you can relax a bit, in order to save energy|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Boards 51 and 53 won 10 IMPS both determined by 'parials'|pg||
nt|casenjo:  partials|pg||
nt|joest: 5@h was a bold move by Hamman imho|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|casenjo:  At this level, it is often the partials that win the event and not the slams.|pg||
nt|joest: voila|pg||
nt|daman: and there it is|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: hmm inspired bid by west|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
mc|12|nt|psyck: how should the bidding have gone after 2@c?|pg||
nt|daman: perhaps    2@D   or 2@H by South|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, 3D a bid extreme.|pg||
nt|chthonic: 3C is a tiny underbid -- maybe worth one cue bid -- 2H|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, I think both could bid less, though all comments so far are about S bidding less|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@d is as aggresive as 3@d in my opinion|pg||
nt|chthonic: I think South's choice of bids over the "free" 2C bid is crucial.|pg||
nt|joest: needing a rally, so far Nickell has yet to score here in the fourth quarter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Nunes was confused|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2nt 5 card major 5-3-3-2 pattern|pg||
pg||

mb|1N|mb|2C|nt|barnets: I have to bid some other suits|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb:  on power: you have 20 or 21 and partner opens 1N|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|d4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|henryb:  3@h by north was probably a form of Lebensohl showing a @s stopper, denying a @h stoppen and forcing to 3N or maybe 5 of a minor|pg||

mc|8|nt|Vugraphzfd: for our younger viewers, Sammy Kehela is one of Canada's great players.  He and his partner Eric Murray represented North America against the Italian Blue Team many times in the ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 1960s.|pg||

nt|ady: down 2     would think that west would have competed to £@D   so 4@C  would be the lowest they could have played|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: nunes left, now back|pg||
mb|1N!|an|14-16|nt|gambit: Of course Barry murder never solved, a sad blight on justice|pg||
nt|joest: I suspect this is West that bid 2@c|pg||
mb|2C|an|majors|mb|d|an|cards|nt|ady: this should be flatish unless e/w get too busy|pg||
mb|3H|an|preempt|nt|joest: in the other room north bid 3@h, a splinter.  Hamman took the push to 4@h and north-south took the cash|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gambit: no overcall, maybe Meck will spring to life |pg||
nt|daman: 1NT - 3NT here|pg||
nt|joest: interesting to see what lead Zia chooses.  Nothing is particularly appealing|pg||
nt|daman: low @S lead|pg||
nt|kit: This is a somewhat fortunate 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: both spade honors on|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: too rich for 3S, will bid 4|pg||
nt|gambit: or some treatment|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT = limit raise|pg||
nt|gambit: hell of a LR |pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt seems pre-destined|pg||
nt|ady: will play 3NT e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Up to Nunes to duplicate the result.|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  3@S should make, losing a @S, 2@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|casenjo:  North opened 2@H|pg||
nt|ritong: we might miss a pass|pg||
nt|bigtrain: extra pass operator|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gambit: here comes 4@S|pg||
nt|daman: low @D could be fatal|pg||
nt|chthonic: This hand is not crucial.... opening lead of a heart would hold to three..  now time to set up a tenth trick?  Seems likely|pg||
pc|h9|nt|casenjo:  Again, the partial and not shooting for the stars, should produce a nice gain for Nickell|pg||
nt|ritong: i am sure EW would declare game if left to themselves|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: director call at the moment by meckstoth|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meckstroth*|pg||
nt|ritong: which one is an other story|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: oh never mind its for the restroom...|pg||
nt|gambit: or puff....|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Rodwell has a wonderful habit of thinking at trick 1|pg||
nt|gambit: Well the crime scene suggested as much |pg||
nt|casenjo:  He is consistant and does it every hand, even if it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|daman: 4th from your longest and strongest|pg||
nt|joest: Hamman may well play his spade honors 'out of order', first king then queen to indicate that he has KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|granguru:  small @h from Hxx Hxxxx or xxxx|pg||
nt|joest: so let's see what Jeff Meckstroth thinks is the right line|pg||
nt|granguru:  might also be from HHxxx|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|joest: probably playing for what exists.  Other lines exist but they are deep|pg||
nt|kit: does he have a choice other thatn to play West for AQ of spades?|pg||
nt|joest: sure.  play east for Qx of spades and the club ace|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: as I said: deep|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gambit: no|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|peachy: not too far off, just spade fin working|pg||
nt|joest: i've learned just to say 'may well' :)|pg||
nt|daman: the @S 9 would be cool now|pg||
nt|chthonic: Why not run the diamonds?|pg||
nt|ady: little problem when J@C holds|pg||
nt|roswolf: always likely to get a trick on the lead|pg||
nt|ady: choice of plays that all seem to work|pg||
nt|joest: which red suit will he work?|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamonds look convenient|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: very deep|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bigtrain: i'm pretty sure meck off tabacco currently...  but changes status frequently :)|pg||

nt|jtr: Sorry:(|pg||
nt|pfbr: hi david :) nice introduciton :)|pg||
nt|daman: you don't have to call me God|pg||
nt|joest: Multon knows he is down if the heart king is off|pg||
nt|chthonic: And now a heart --|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|chthonic: sooner or later|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bigtrain: 3@D is a help suit game try in theory although space is limited so it is somewhat random|pg||
nt|casenjo:  same contract in other room|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Oftentimes, a hand may look so easy and you might do lttle errors like winning the first trick in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Jeff and Eric were both born in 1956|pg||
nt|joest: now he is cold with no further finesses|pg||
nt|joest: besides the heart|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: excellent year|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: guessed well|pg||
nt|joest: assuming declarer has five hearts, Zia can see that declarer has nine tricks now|pg||
nt|joest: on the last board Meckstroth and Rodwell alsopushed to 5@s|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: Helness switched to a @D|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: that's 3 imps the hard way|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|joest: so long as he plays clubs into the safe hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|daman: I might have won the @C Ace and played another @S after my partner signalled with the 2     I'm sure ralph has a good reason for ducking|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|c5|pg||

mb|p|nt|gambit: I thought we were friends...guess we can't talk about barry or whatever...|pg||
nt|ady: cold  because we see all 4 hands|pg||

nt|kit: Declarer may have enough info to make 4@S on this auction|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|gambit: 3@D?|pg||
nt|joest: but one that enables his partner to compete to 3@c|pg||

nt|joest: Between Helgemo-Helness last set and Nunes-Fantoni this one I honestly do not believe they have dropped a single trick on defense|pg||

mb|d|mb|2C!|an|!D|nt|chthonic: what was the problem?  I don't attribute to the 1S bid.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C=5+@D   if you hadn't figured that out|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT = 12-14|pg||
nt|frusco: standard bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|gambit: perhaps dble from N might help S do the right thing|pg||
nt|joest: I suspect Zia will bid 2@h.  It is worth it to bid out your pattern (even if you know partner doesn'ts have four hearts)|pg||
nt|joest: wonder which one he would have played had Zia returned a spade instead of a diamond :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|joest: b/c you know the opps have at least nine spades|pg||
nt|frusco: can NS bid 3nt?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|casenjo:  yes, that was when system went down|pg||
nt|joest: i suspect Jeff will 'grab' this|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@C is trf to 2@D|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gambit: he has a great hand...should be |pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: i suppose this is a shortened auction|pg||
nt|daman: right    good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Then 1NT would have been better, it would appear|pg||
nt|psyck: surely non forcing for them, but passing E's hand over a non forcing bid is not for me, i would bid something|pg||
nt|kareno: Did 2@d ostensibly show 3 diamonds?|pg||
nt|joest: the cards lie quite well for east-west in this spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt it Karen  just takes away a cue bid from opp|pg||
nt|joest: it is possible Rodwell might remove to 3NT.  I"m sure he thinks defending 3@d is scary|pg||
nt|kareno: I'll say.  Maybe he bids 3@s and south 3nt?|pg||
nt|joest: 3@s could be a suit couldn't it?|pg||
nt|granguru:  what side are you if 3@d doubled ?|pg||
nt|kareno: The @c ten will be a pleasant surprise if he does bid it|pg||
nt|granguru:  do you want to play or defend?|pg||
nt|granguru:  play wins 11-0|pg||
mb|3N|nt|granguru:  and now 3nt do you want to play or defend?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: north had shown up too much Jack   passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: contract is right and declarer too|pg||
nt|joest: maybe some question about whether 3@c is forcing.  Reversing after a 1NT response not necessarily the same as after one of a suit|pg||
nt|daman: but it will be unsuccessful|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: they have 2 boards remaining in the Open Room|pg||
nt|chthonic: Agree, but that leaves bidding 2D on xxx - not appealing, either.|pg||
nt|joest: now a heart back and another club|pg||

nt|granguru:  lost count|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: but duboin had no reason to bid 4@s here|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h would have been a great result|pg||
nt|daman: down 2 if E switches to a @D|pg||
nt|joest: making on a dummy reversal|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|joest: these guys are defending extremely well this set|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bigtrain: @CQ is rusinow|pg||
nt|gambit: hands fit well, and things on-side and best lead for the def, S will hook the spade successfully knowing the W hand|pg||
nt|gambit: needs the K@H onside or not play therefore W is 1-2-5-5- or the like|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|joest: much easier to see looking at all four hands|pg||
nt|daman: has to play the K|pg||
nt|psyck: 2m rebid on 1N does not promise the earth even playing NF NT|pg||
nt|granguru:  around 12 defend if s lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|granguru:  8 for playing it|pg||
nt|joest: a spade shift there was a might tough play|pg||
nt|joest: i think rodwell may have to win this in dummy and play hearts|pg||
pc|c3|nt|casenjo:  Kibbitzers have askedme about the 3@C bid, frequently used in Precision auctions|pg||
nt|roswolf: good to watch = we can all learn something|pg||
nt|kareno: Time for east to call spades.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did 3N have a chance if Fantoni makes Canape lead of @S?|pg||
nt|joest: then he can block the spade suit|pg||
nt|joest: this is looking at all four hands mind you|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bigtrain: i bet he's regretting not doubling about now|pg||
nt|gambit: neat toy |pg||
pc|c9|nt|gambit: doubt tht|pg||
nt|gambit: why double whwn they will make it or even, 1 trick set? |pg||
nt|gambit: will be claiming shortly |pg||
nt|bigtrain: actually was referring to the 5@S bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  @C9 means @s interest|pg||
nt|joest: then west gets squeezed in 3 suits on the run of the clubs|pg||
nt|joest:  I think |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|joest: I guess Zia thought that Helness would not pass an 11 count|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|daman: imo    4@C was a bit of a reach but I can understand his enthusiasm on the auction|pg||
nt|joest: yeah.  I'm sure if he knew 100% that 3@c was forcing he would have bid that|pg||
nt|granguru:  South will be squeezed on the last @C|pg||
nt|granguru:  E can throw a @h|pg||
pc|h7|nt|daman: -1 now|pg||
nt|joest: I suspect (but don't know) that he had some concern about that|pg||
nt|frusco: dummy discard 1@H and 1@s|pg||

pc|h4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kareno: 2 hearts maybe for the swindle|pg||

pc|d9|nt|chthonic: Only question is whether Katz will take all of the rest of the tricks.|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 1@C shows 16+ hcp and any distributuion|pg||

pc|hK|nt|bigtrain: the X was just cards (nothing more to contribute)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|joest: this is the second straight five of a minor that might have made ona very good day - but which won't|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a decent save|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gambit: will never make|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The 2@C bid is highlighted without explanation, but Bigtrain explained that it sets a Game Force|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5+@C and GF values|pg||
nt|gambit: 8+ Forcing, all us former precision players know that |pg||
nt|gambit: need new glasses?|pg||

mb|3D|nt|joest: interesting that there was no 'support double' by Zimmerman showing 3 hearts. They probably play it as something else|pg||
nt|joest: opposite a support double Multon would already have bid 4@h by now|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: ought to be a push -- down 2|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C   1 down only|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  It's the WiFi at the Ryal York|pg||

nt|daman: Rusinow|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: FAntoni went low here where Hamman went high|pg||
nt|joest: but the rot set in when Zia got a 4@d lead director in as west and had to table hishand in 4@h|pg||

nt|joest: great opening lead even though Zia now apparently playing under an assumed name|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|joest: the short hearts are on play so the singleton club is not getting led|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bigtrain: 3NT -1 on 59|pg||
nt|sybarra2: did we get this one right?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Is this contract correct?|pg||
nt|ritong: nikita says so|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this is rare fumble by this pair|pg||
nt|casenjo:  alerted|pg||
nt|ritong: absolutely astonishing|pg||
nt|ritong: makes more sense|pg||
nt|casenjo:  ah, that makes sense|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This pair has over 200 pages of notes, when I asked Meckstroth if he knows it all, he said Eric does|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Jeff pled the 5th|pg||
nt|bigtrain: their SUMMARY is 200 pages|pg||
nt|casenjo:  That's why Isaid over 200!|pg||
nt|ritong: do they still have " MOST OF OUR BIDS ARE NATURAL" on the top of their CC, walter?|pg||
nt|joest: not that a club lead appeals that much with Jxxxof trumps anyway|pg||
nt|chthonic: no mishap|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: w3ll he doent have to most days:)|pg||
nt|joest: by rising king Hamman has now unfortunately for him blocked the spade suit|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|peachy: Looks like the view led to problems this time|pg||
nt|casenjo:  wow, I'm getting jammed with comments on the 1NT opener|pg||
nt|casenjo:  14 prime HCP and a 5 card suit and protecting his Kings, is very reasonable|pg||
nt|bigtrain: KNR values the hand at 14.50 so it's in the ballpark for an upgrade|pg||
pc|sK|nt|casenjo:  I would probably stretch this to a 1NT opener also|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you open a club what is your rebid? |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is the problem |pg||
nt|bigtrain: how about 1NT :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Yes, I like 1NT in all seats with this hand|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi for those who want to have a look at the K&R hand evaluator|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I think it is a litte too good for the 1NT rebid, and agree with Shirley|pg||
nt|gambit: this has no play, wish him luck |pg||
nt|bigtrain: it's not imo...  if the J were in any other suit i'd agree though|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Meckstroth's double of 2@D also seduced North in believing his singleton was big, knowing partner doesn't have much in Diamonds|pg||
nt|gambit: note how Rodwell did not lead a diamond....what does that say?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  we do have a possible swing board coming up, so stay tuned|pg||
nt|gambit: I throw it out there, I don't know and he WAS RIGHT....so I guess he knows what he is doing, funny thing that for a world class player|pg||
nt|joest: this seems more like it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joest: n-s bidding without a lot of high cards|pg||
nt|ady: can get a 2nd diamond trick  but may lose too many tricks|pg||
nt|joest: declarer just does not have quite enough tricks I don't think|pg||
pc|h6|nt|casenjo:  Meckwell have been playing together since 1978...without any break in partnership....they get to know a lot about style.....more than husband and wife ;)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|gambit: he made the best lead because he is a world class player, nothing more, nothing less, he is great|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|joest: I think Eric has two more coming and that's it|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|casenjo:  ok, I asked for this one, kibbitzers now asking if I played with 'Drewsky' Casen when we were married|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Not only did we play together, but it was ONLY time we NEVER fought|pg||
nt|gambit: neat play , though delaying the inevitable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have operated for Meckwell agst various opps many times |pg||
nt|casenjo:  VERY TRUE!  If I played poorly, he only found kind things to say.  If I played well, he said nothing, which is often best.  When we finished very high in a Men's event (while married), I asked him, "Why are you such a wonderful partner and such |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting dynamic,  calm, pleasant, intense, fun in many ways |pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult to describe|pg||
nt|casenjo:  a horrible partner?" His answer: "I'm a professional bridge player, not a professional husband"|pg||
nt|casenjo:  excuse me; it was horrible husband|pg||
nt|begse: 2 içeri belki 3|pg||
nt|begse: sry|pg||
nt|joest: Zia falsecarded at trick one but that would seem to make it more likely, rather than less likely, north has the club king|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|famus: hi--correct|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Great bridge player, great dad,great teacher, great golfer, backgammn player and poker player....lousy husband|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: Zia gets in with A@D   cash Q@S and play J@H nakes it clear|pg||
nt|ady: makes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: so Zimmerman will give up an imp here but roll home|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d8|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Can't be perfect :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||

mb|p|nt|aitch99: it was quite conservative of Rodwell to pass the 1NT|pg||

mb|1D|nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any shape|pg||

nt|joest: we will see|pg||
nt|daman: strange result here|pg||
nt|daman: i like 3 NT|pg||

mb|1H!|an|!S|nt|joest: not clear where north-south should wind up although if I had to guess, I'd say 3NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@H GF|pg||
mb|3C|nt|joest: in the other room Ralph Katz had to decide whether to sit 1@h doubled.|pg||
nt|ady: wonder if e/w may make a phantom|pg||
nt|psyck: not now|pg||
nt|chthonic: And now EW must show their defensive technique for a push.|pg||
nt|ady: top club lead   east can give suit preference|pg||
nt|joest: which is not such a hot spot either|pg||
nt|ady: where will this end?|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks possible|pg||
nt|joest: Zia may stall with 2@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: bidding to 3nt|pg||
nt|joest: he is too big for 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1NT is control asking|pg||
nt|aitch99: whoops i think this is wrong|pg||
nt|psyck: a normal suit preferance on @c lead will make it easy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4NT was quant, not RKC|pg||
nt|joest: I understand 4NT was quantitative|pg||
mb|3D|nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|ady: did take the sacrifice|pg||
nt|chthonic: Get Lizzie Borden, quick|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Let's focus on this hand people|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 3 controls (A = 2 K = 1)|pg||
nt|ritong: heavy @d guess|pg||
nt|casenjo:  another partial battle|pg||
nt|joest: Having a double argues in favor of it.  Having an unmentioned KQ109xx suit argues against it|pg||
nt|joest: having a doubleton heart I mean|pg||
nt|chorush: Many pairs have the agreement that an immediate 4S by South shows the worst hand, which he certainly has, so we may be waiting while zimmerman decides about 5 clubs|pg||
nt|joest: Hamman bought well at that|pg||
nt|kareno: I'll say!!  |pg||
nt|joest: he doesn't want to give his partner any idea that spades might be trump|pg||
nt|kareno: For the record, I believe that the Nickell team gets its placement points for the Trials irrespective of outcome.  Anyone know for sure?|pg||
nt|joest: 1@h was spades btw|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John -- do you know if 1@H establishes game force?|pg||
nt|joest: good question.  Fantoni has a VERY solid 3@c call|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told no.  That used to be the case but apparently not now.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|joest: exclusion blackwood for clubs is my guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: ty big train for system notes, that really helps us all |pg||
nt|sybarra: Walter how does he show the club void?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  bigtrain will walk you through theauction|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Getting to 7 would be a swing for Nickells|pg||
nt|bigtrain: probably not until the keycard level|pg||
nt|gambit: will Versace venture in with 4@C?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|daman: here is the vugraph schedule for future session    please bookmark it    http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|ady: great pickup for Nickell|pg||
nt|daman: this could tie the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: if meck had a fit it would be shown as a part of a relay response|pg||
nt|ritong: bingo|pg||
nt|psyck: match will remain close at the end of 1st set, like it was at the end of 1st, not good for Nickell who prefer to trail at the half :)|pg||
nt|ady: all square now|pg||
nt|psyck: *2nd set|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, need to be behind 30 or more|pg||
mb|5N|nt|bigtrain: XX is penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: hoping for a couple of clubs with partner :)|pg||
nt|joest: my personal take is that Ralph took a pretty deep position|pg||
nt|joest: of course that doesn't tell him anything about the king of spades|pg||
mb|7C|nt|chorush: Seems certain to. 9 tricks for EW seems predestined|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: bet that is a splinter|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C is exclusion RKC|pg||
nt|joest: now this is Zia backing his judgment about a hopeless misfit|pg||
nt|joest: right down to bidding 2NT to give his partner more room to bid out his shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: look at Rodwell's hand, and his partner has opened a forcing club, and shown a balnced NT, he is salivating|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok exc |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D = 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: exc or voidwood |pg||
nt|joest: great recovery!|pg||
nt|chorush: I would guess that 5NT was a grand slam invitation confirming all keys|pg||
nt|joest: when partner keeps it alive with 5NT, Nunes knows he has what partner needs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: yes, they need that for inspired finish|pg||

nt|chthonic: Yes, should be uneventful push board 420|pg||

pc|sA|nt|bigtrain: looks like scrambling 8 tricks here|pg||

pc|s5|nt|daman: he was always finessing the @S|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|joest: takes the tap crosses to the heart queen picks up the trumps returns to his hand with a heart ruff, etc.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|joest: on the hand where Zia down in 3@s Meckwell landed in 4@h and are on the way to make it for a swing|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|daman: vugraph schedule    http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|joest: Team Monaco has played lights out|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: please check the board number|pg||
nt|joest: George or John do you know when the second set begins?|pg||
mb|d|nt|gambit: as one commentator said, when we all thought he was going for his life - live by the sword, die by the sword|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 5+@D GF|pg||
nt|casenjo:  another big club auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is waiting|pg||
nt|ritong: looks ok|pg||
nt|ritong: they apparently skipped the 62|pg||
nt|ritong: momentarily|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 3@H is both minors|pg||
nt|daman: this is now the penultimate hand of this session|pg||
nt|joest: Zia does not belong to the school where you respond on anything.  Good thing too|pg||
nt|daman: begins in 17 minutes   lol|pg||
mb|1N|nt|granguru:  this is the forelast hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bigtrain: 62 a push looks like|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe they took 63 before 62|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no one skipped anything the bbo server continues to freeze and forces me to restart everything|pg||
nt|joest: I just have to say that imho Zia was brilliant on that last hand|pg||
nt|joest: he catered to the layout that existed and it paid off|pg||
nt|daman: the next session is supposed to begin in 16 minutes|pg||
nt|psyck: a bigger swing if it makes|pg||
nt|kareno: They surely have.  They will be a real factor in world championships very soon.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: it s ok  relax nikita|pg||
nt|chthonic: I don't get dealt AK and not lead that suit.|pg||
nt|chorush: with that lead it may wellmake|pg||
nt|psyck: well, it it does, he can be happy the lead only cost 3 imps|pg||
nt|ady: this hand going to be bad for Nickell and may get worse|pg||
nt|ady: where Zia went down in 3@S  Meck opened the 11 that Helness passed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|casenjo:  now Meckstroth has found the club fit!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  pretty auction|pg||
nt|gambit: low spade lead from S will scuttle any slam......|pg||
nt|casenjo:  south isn't on lead|pg||
nt|gambit: sad but rrue|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gambit: SAD BUT TRUE|pg||
nt|gambit: nice to see V have the chance for glory |pg||
nt|chthonic: I can protect against their setting up hearts with my length. |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bigtrain: making 140 on this one is huge|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't look like it can be made|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|daman: we have been told the next session will start 20 minutes after this table has finished|pg||
nt|joest: another pick up for Nickell provided Hamman can go plus |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|chthonic: Regardless, 3NT making NS inthe other room will lead to a significant gain for Monaco|pg||
nt|ady: down 1 in spite of the lead|pg||
nt|chthonic: Nunes opened the south hand with 2H|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|joest: if Helness duckes there and Hamman hooks again...|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|casenjo:  no spade guess here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  diamonds split 4-3 and a ruff in dummy for 12|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: 10-13 5 card @h for Nunes maybe|pg||
nt|joest: but I don't think Hamman would hook again|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|joest: defenders got their tap suit going in time|pg||
nt|psyck: with adjustments for shape|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|aitch99: in danger of going off|pg||
nt|chthonic: 11 IMPs |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d2|pc|c5|nt|joest: Hamman now developshis @d trick|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|casenjo:  if they pick up 22 next quarter............|pg||
nt|joest: no red suit squeeze exists so +140|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|casenjo:  Nickell has picked up 22 this quarter|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bigtrain: did that really happen?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|joest: this table is a full four boards ahead of their counterparts|pg||
nt|ady: they have played quickly|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes very commendable|pg||
nt|joest: so if spdes 3-2 and club jack doesn't drop Hamman needs toruff a club now|pg||
nt|joest: if spades 4-1 and club jack does drop he needs to pull trumps now|pg||
nt|ady: would be against the odds|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: doesn't look good|pg||
nt|joest: so now Hamman will be tapped out while East has an entry|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: wow|pg||
nt|joest: so here comes the last hand of the set|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: yes if spades 3-2 he can draw trumps ending in dummy and get clubs away on the hearts|pg||

nt|henryb:  The Soprano is warming up|pg||
nt|henryb:  running her scales|pg||
nt|barnets: again an excellent def from fantoni and nunes|pg||
nt|henryb:  The reference is to the lead singer at the opera, not to Kate Smith|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thanks to all the great commentators and to the specs -- we will keep this room open until the other table finishes|pg||
nt|henryb:  and she was often fat|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|barnets: zia knows he is off one key card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|barnets: well done not bther about the trump q at this stage of match|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, the players do not know the score, although one can often estimate pretty well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Zia:  how many aces did you show?  Hamman:  I showed the wrong number  Zia: I hope you have some|pg||
pc|s5|nt|barnets: so nickell has a decent run in from this run|pg||
nt|barnets: room|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|barnets: but not likely to be enough|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
mc|12|nt|henryb:  they had two seriously bad boards: 49 and 60|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks all our operator Joe , all commentators ACBL and to BBO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thanlks|pg||
nt|barnets: 60 i forgot disaster|pg||
nt|henryb:  This was a fairly low scoring match: we usually expect about 4 and a quarter imps per board, or some 270 over 64 boards|pg||
nt|barnets: On 60 playing 3@D n/s|pg||
nt|barnets: that will put the match out of reach|pg||
nt|henryb:  so that will be 12 or 14 to Monaco|pg||
nt|barnets: congrats to Monaco|pg||
nt|barnets: they played a fine match|pg||
nt|henryb:  For those who are curious, Gordon-Pratap and company won the Swiss|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 national Ko  championships for Zimmerman|pg||

nt|casenjo:  they will once again be the 'come from behind guys'|pg||
nt|ritong: ok|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Jack of @D lead, followed by a spade shift|pg||
nt|joest: my suspicion is that we will see 4@s here as well|pg||
nt|daman: can they stay out of game?|pg||
nt|joest: congratulations to Team Monaco for winning  in what was really a star studded field|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2+@D 10-15|pg||
mb|2C|nt|joest: At the other table 1@c was the chosen opening bid which may have helped influenced south to just bid a gamewhen he got raised|pg||
nt|kareno: It is indeed a great win.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: tough call for Helgemo.  3NT might sound like 18|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bigtrain: X can be 5@H with GF values|pg||
nt|chorush: Multon passed where Meckstroth doubld|pg||
nt|ady: some would open west hand   maybe cant  in their system|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s is a compromise that sounds maybe like a fifth club but not so clear in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely to end in 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expected that|pg||
nt|joest: Helness has a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@C ask 5 card major|pg||
mb|3H|nt|joest: interesting  he suppresses his spades to play for penalties (I presume)|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  last board of a truly excitging match|pg||
nt|roswolf: and iws bidding it|pg||
nt|joest: the fourth and final NT! :)|pg||
nt|ady: even white against red  not wild about heart overcall|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bigtrain: but here it's "normal"|pg||
nt|daman: would you have bid 1@S Joe?|pg||
nt|joest: Yes I would.  I admit it|pg||
nt|daman: Jack   sorry|pg||
nt|joest: but pass is certainly more exciting|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal, thanks all, next set in a couple of hours.|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: this is the second time this set that the Nickell team has 'taken a view' by defending 1@h doubled|pg||
nt|roswolf: firm;y does it|pg||
nt|joest: but actually the heart overcall helped create some of this ambiguity|pg||
nt|roswolf: f[rmly|pg||
mb|r|nt|bigtrain: something happened to board 61 result...  thats why score changed|pg||
nt|pfbr: ty commentators :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: start 6 eastern|pg||
nt|pfbr: and ty operator :) |pg||
nt|ady: this not exactly a favourate to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|joest: it didnt work last time|pg||
nt|ady: thx all |pg||
nt|joest: Hamman knew not to lead a heart|pg||
nt|ady: own suit so bad    tried something a bit desparate|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|joest: in fairness he has a very difficult lead problem|pg||
nt|ady: yes   agree|pg||
nt|joest: if each of you tell me you would unerringly lead the @d 10 i believe you|pg||
nt|roswolf: geir has a very difficult declarer problem|pg||
nt|joest: once again, many thanks to our tireless operator John Schwartz|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  more or less the same auction at the other table|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Please return for an exciting 4th quarter!!!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Wow, slow down guys, too many questions!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Board 61 is now correct as Henri says|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it looks like things are a bit messed up so we'll have to wait for comparasions to see who wins|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: will not take long|pg||
nt|casenjo:  And yes Meckstroth made 2@H, shortens his trump length to the same as North and throws him in to pick up the trump suit|pg||
nt|joest: John and Karen thanks|pg||
nt|kareno: <applause> ... that is such a hard job!|pg||
nt|kareno: And to you, Jack :)|pg||
nt|joest: yes he might not be 'tireless' at this point|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|joest: I would tell you what the bids meant if only I knew :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|casenjo:  Thanks to Cam, Walter and all my co-commentators|pg||
nt|kareno: Don't give up your seats, specs!!  |pg||
nt|kareno: I've no idea.  But some do play that 3@h is a spade raise.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Nickell has to make this to obtain a push|pg||
nt|ady: good start|pg||
mb|6H|nt|chthonic: Interesting play -- worked well.|pg||
nt|chthonic: True.... |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade best|pg||

nt|joest: good job|pg||
nt|daman: they shd get 7 tricks on D    no?|pg||
nt|joest: Multon may be off a card playing Hamman for 4=1=4=4 or 4=0=4=5|pg||
nt|joest: it looks to me like Zia's shot will pay off here|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  breakk should be about 15-20 minutes|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kareno: I think all roads lead to two spade finesses here.|pg||
nt|joest: well you could pitch a spade on the club ace and try for a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|pfbr: i so hope so :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that's possible - diamond ruff.  But I think spades are more promising.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks everyone for your patience!|pg||
nt|daman: this is not good|pg||
nt|joest: even though Zia must put declarer in dummy, the two pitches do not help him|pg||

nt|joest: but all roads lead to success|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||

nt|casenjo:  go to Vugraph Archive and look at Spingold Semi FInal Cayne/Nickell 4th quarter|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Nikita, you were awesome|pg||
nt|joest: yes I think spades is %|pg||
nt|joest: what's more: so does Fantoni|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|ady: seems 7 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: can also try ruffing out spades|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|joest: now Zia just takes a minor suit ruff and waits for his 2 naturals|pg||
nt|joest: it may be incumbent upon Hamman soon to unblock the spade jack|pg||
nt|kareno: IMO the double finesse is stronger.  We will see.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|casenjo:  It is so tough to lose connections and get back online, especially since the players do not wait for you! @H|pg||
nt|chorush: can make on endplay|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|casenjo:  Thanks again to Henri and Walter for great commentary|pg||

nt|fifee: quite a match|pg||
