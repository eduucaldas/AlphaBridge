nt|Vugraphzfc: there is an issue with the hands because it is not the right hands give me a moment to resolve please|pg||
nt|gambit: 38 imp difference, 32 boards left,,expect some fireworks |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Meckwell has lots of experience grinding out come from behind victories|pg||
nt|gambit: indeed|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi everybody|pg||
nt|jpes: its lauria and versace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hi all the match has begun but there is an issue with the hands so please stop asking me to change the names of the players i will do it thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator, the spelling of the N-S names are not accurate|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Lauria|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Versace|pg||
nt|gambit: not exactly the meek vs. the meek, more like battle of the titans|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  No problem with the names, just pretend the 'n's are 'r's|pg||
nt|daman: and we're off and pacing|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Welcome to 3rd quarter of Spingold Semi-Finals|pg||
nt|joest: Zia proving that 3rd seat nonvulnerable is not 100% forcing: even on him|pg||
nt|joest: with 11 highs and only a spade stiff, Zimmerman will toss this back in|pg||
nt|daman: I think that the next cycle begins with the 2012 Spingold Jack|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/component/content/article/2-latest-news/988-hamman-joins-new-team-for-next-cycle|pg||
nt|joest: One common rule of thumb in fourth seat: add your HCP + your   of spades.  If 15 or more, open.  If not, pass|pg||
nt|daman: not enough pearson points to open|pg||
mb|1D|nt|joest: ok, color me surprised :)|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2@C shows 8+ minors over 1@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they can be 53 either way even|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: 4@S from Eric, what else|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|gambit: look at Meck's raise!|pg||
nt|gambit: indeed|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Rodwell just might eek out 8 tricks........|pg||
nt|gambit: Zia might not make 5@D* off three toppers|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe even 9|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello again|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gambit: :)|pg||
nt|gambit: ok now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is art GF|pg||
nt|joest: the theory is: either you partner has spades (which will force you to rebid which is bad) or the opponents have spades and can outbid you so your cheapest exit is passing right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Hi Jo Anne|pg||
nt|gambit: delaying the inevitable|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT shows 9 minors with a singleton spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|joest: George points out that the change will not take place until next year's spingold so Zia-Hamman will still play the REisinger and Vanderbilt this year|pg||
nt|daman: they need to get a @D trick before the @Cs are set up to beat|pg||
pc|h6|nt|casenjo:  this will only make on a non-@H lead|pg||
nt|gambit: Can N lead a heart? |pg||
nt|gambit: no....|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gambit: will make it now|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: Hi Henri|pg||
nt|joest: 6NT is best b/c it can make even if hearts do not come home|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: 15-17|pg||

nt|joest: in some partnerships, 4@c now by south shows 4 clubs + 3 hearts|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|joest: but we'll see how they do it|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|joest: at this point Hamman would like to use double roman key card for hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: J@S lead after that auction |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Roddy knows Jeff is broke|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.archiviobridge.it/lauria-versace.pdf  NS card. It is a WBF card but surely they havvent changed much|pg||
nt|casenjo:  For those non-Precision people, please read Bigtrain's commentary for perfect explanations|pg||
nt|tez: 8 of @s great card:)|pg||
nt|gambit: assuming E/W can unblock the clubs, this is an easy defeat |pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, and we see it went down in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: but i don't know if they play that|pg||
nt|joest: he just cares about aces, the heart king, and the round queens|pg||
mb|5S|nt|bigtrain: ace lead from AKx(x); meck's signal is standard|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hi Walter|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi joanne|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: that looks like two + a queen|pg||
nt|joest: some pairs have steps that distinguish which queen, or whether both queens|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|peachy: Glad to have Walter here, he knows Meckwell system |pg||
nt|gambit: puts terror into the heart of the declarer, he doesn't know E can't get the lead...|pg||
nt|casenjo:  for the hundres watching 'bigtrain' was my first bridge teacher at Ohio State|pg||
nt|gambit: wow...nice to have such a mentor|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: this sounds like it could be to play|pg||
nt|joest: 6@c is still safer than 6@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  I'm happy with the results :)|pg||
nt|daman: six key card that shows @C Q and not @H Q|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|gambit: nice lead, and fortuitous break. Wd by Roddy |pg||
nt|peachy: Rodwell might/might not be having discard trouble soon\|pg||
nt|gambit: Declarer fantazing about Kx@D onside allowing contract to make, but not today|pg||
nt|bigtrain: won't have much of a problem|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Was Meckstroth's 9@H a spade indicator?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  If so, Eric can safely pitch a spade|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|gambit: no doubt Jeff and Eric are hoping for more shapely and imaginative hands|pg||
nt|joest: one questin to discuss with your partner if you play Drury:  is 2@c drury here or natural?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|joest: 3@d seems sort of straightforward but some pairs play that must be fit-showing by a passed hand in which case I guess you have to do something else|pg||

nt|casenjo:  remember last quarter? they gained 20 in 2 boards|pg||
nt|gambit: no...venturing too high |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Patience can be a virtue.....running out of patience can be a disaster|pg||
nt|joest: anyway: a great chance for Nickell to be plus at both tables|pg||

nt|daman: idgebase.com/index.php|pg||
nt|daman: for those who want the audio|pg||
nt|joest: Hamman may 'guess' the heart king solely bbecaus he wants to avoid a spade ruff if he loses to the king|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|daman: it would be a super play|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|gambit: he want to lead a heart but can't from that holding|pg||
nt|joest: of course from his point of view that is conceding going down unless he drops the king|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gambit: hmmm|pg||
pc|s4|nt|casenjo:  Nice lead by Jeff Meckstroth|pg||
nt|gambit: that helps the def|pg||
nt|joest: 2 diamonds + 2 clubs + 1 heart + 1 spade|pg||
pc|h4|nt|casenjo:  Zia ran off his clubs and managed 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gambit: how will Zia make that? He must be swinging (as predicted) already |pg||
nt|casenjo:  On Board 34, sorry|pg||
nt|bigtrain: E pitched3 spades which squeezes W in 3 suits|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|casenjo:  1-5-4-3 is possible, but not likely without having shown a big hand|pg||
nt|gambit: I remember playing Barry Crane in Cobo Hall in Detroit, 1978/79 and we were killing them after 3 boards, I prayed for 4 banal, simplistic hands, alas my prayers were answered, but ...|pg||

nt|daman: nah    they want to be in game and not defending|pg||
nt|joest: anyway Hamman didn't want to wait around to find out|pg||
nt|joest: random unbiddable spot cards can affect that kind of result|pg||
nt|daman: plus   he LOVES to play 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: i'm being told it goes 800 on a trump promo which looks right.  That is still a random result and Hamman has a lifetime experience of whether it's worth passing 2@s at these colors|pg||
nt|daman: he will play the King   and finesse a @S|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|bigtrain: just another cold game :)|pg||

nt|daman: no idea why he hung onto that @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: its a forced shift since he knows @C pitches coming|pg||

nt|casenjo:  We now have a mere 7 IMP match|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|gambit: all true|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: note that Hamman has both majors for his double.  I sometimes see newer players double with only one major here|pg||
nt|joest: looks like a trick got away in the open room in 4@c|pg||

mb|2N|an|!D raiise|nt|daman: 2NT must be some form of Dormer limit raise|pg||

mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Wow and just told only a 2 imp difference in the other match with 10 boards to go|pg||
nt|gambit: the player in blue jeans was a friend, Doug Fox|pg||
nt|gambit: indeed Soloway it was|pg||
nt|joest: turns out 3@d can't make|pg||
nt|daman: as did hamman|pg||
nt|daman: but they have 4 losers|pg||
nt|joest: if they cash them|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: Meck?|pg||
nt|joest: that didn't prove so easy in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  2@H is a friendly little contract with 3-3 hearts and 3-3 spades|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: 5 IMPs riding on it|pg||
nt|joest: this was the start next door, followed by ace and a spade|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|gambit: Doug asked Ron if he he borrow thelighter...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|joest: and in fairness to West if a low spade comes back, a spade return (for a possible ruff) looks more appealing than leading away from the heart king|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|gambit: after Ron denied permission I guess Doug did notheng, no idea|pg||
nt|daman: yes it does|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gambit: @D through|pg||
nt|casenjo:  An interesting note, that applies to this match. Paul Soloway once said, "The average hand is a partial, the average hand is boring, the average hand I have played too many times to count...concentrating on ALL the hands is winning bridge"|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gambit: the words of a champion and gentleman, brb|pg||
nt|ritong: in fact the trick is to recognize quickly the hands you can relax a bit, in order to save energy|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Boards 51 and 53 won 10 IMPS both determined by 'parials'|pg||
nt|casenjo:  partials|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|casenjo:  At this level, it is often the partials that win the event and not the slams.|pg||

nt|gambit: neat play , though delaying the inevitable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have operated for Meckwell agst various opps many times |pg||
nt|casenjo:  VERY TRUE!  If I played poorly, he only found kind things to say.  If I played well, he said nothing, which is often best.  When we finished very high in a Men's event (while married), I asked him, "Why are you such a wonderful partner and such |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting dynamic,  calm, pleasant, intense, fun in many ways |pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult to describe|pg||
