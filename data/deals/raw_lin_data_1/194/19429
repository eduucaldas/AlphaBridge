nt|santyclz: Oh we of little faith...|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w want some exciting bds |pg||
nt|sybarra: or ones they can score on |pg||
nt|rodal f: If @H was 3-2|pg||
nt|stewball: well thats for 3|pg||
nt|ybob: if S run 2 @H tricks ...|pg||
nt|stewball: he had 9 on top|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all 3 were 4-man teams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all 3 were leading after 3rd Quarter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NONE are in the Semi-Finals|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: the last hand was won and lost in bidding, not the defense|pg||
nt|ybob: now of ocurse with @S 3/3|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ybob: course|pg||
nt|gambit: Geoff Hampson and John Diamond won a pairs event this afternoon|pg||
nt|odysseus69: obvious message- dont come 4 handed-good spot Al|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: not sure why 6@H was down 3, is certainly a reasonable contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|puncher99: even if u opn lite thts real lite vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: we wont be on edge of seats for this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Today is quite a contrast from yesterday....  Today we are in a room alone.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why ACBL allows same boards in both matches -- no issues with security|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: There are currently 4 vg tables running, to watch multiple tables:  www.bridgebase.com/mobile  Open 1 browser window/table.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well .....  fewer/different security issues|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfe: I'm sure it is best if I concentrate on just one table. :)|pg||
nt|chick: this should be easy with all the black honors favorably placed|pg||
nt|santyclz: A spec points out that if s passes and n opens 1nt s might like her 6-4 enough to push to game.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: normal for them in strong club|pg||
nt|rodal f: U find the other table bu the BBO vug TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and they have the tools to stay low when needed|pg||
nt|gambit: We all play 2s promised 13 cards and little else|pg||

nt|duschek: So another 7 imps for Bjarnarson. This time generated from the open room.|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely the table feels that is a push or minor scoring  certainly not & |pg||
nt|sybarra: not 7|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, that was an expensive guess|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: what the?|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  risked 5 imps versus hoping to gain 3.  a reasonable gamble if he thinks S has the Ace|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks in clubs for e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tarekr:  it seemed sh could have pulled trumps before playing @s. Of course had to find Q@d|pg||
nt|ady: maybe only 9|pg||
nt|xenya: routine 3N here -- probably doomed|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: surely S was worth another bid|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, unfortunate lie of @c's|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: 6@h good slam|pg||
nt|psyck: knows won't win it at 1 level|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Sorry, we had to close and reopen to fix the match name. Will claim when they finish play|pg||
mc|11|nt|chick: I think a 2@S bid is clear, if only to prevent 2@C|pg||
nt|kareno: In particular to keep e/w out of clubs.  |pg||
nt|psyck: with those good @s's, i prefer 2@s to 2@d rebid|pg||
nt|duschek: Askgaard decided that @CQT9xx was unsuitable for a 2@C opener, with 1NT being a decent alternative|pg||
nt|duschek: With 75% of the HCP in the short suits, I can understand him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 1NT 12-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: its sort of a 12|pg||
nt|duschek: 12-14 as far as I know - 15 balanced HCP should be within the 1@C opening|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North has to decide a strategy for the defence ... go for ruffs, or try to force declarer?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the OR, they went for the force ... a losing heart lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course, it was a different auction, with N/S bidding and raising hearts|pg||
nt|duschek: Morten Lund Madsen's lead of a small heart in the open room did not give declarer a hard time|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they did bid hts in the OR |pg||
pg||

nt|tarekr:  which, looking at the hand does make sense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the usually slow men are 3 boards ahead of this match|pg||
nt|ybob: was better 3NT, only down 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will north bid 1S -for sure|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry- thot he was 3rd|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is unclear|pg||
nt|odysseus69: weak NT |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Waiting on Zimmermann's bid.  N passed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the plus score for fleischer in the other room is probably v good|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: mini NT    weak = 12-14    modern=14-16  strong = 15-17  monster = Roman 18-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: N hard to stop but W have a nice sac.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: If they keep inventing auctions like this, then it will be a long session.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: not sure what to call 13-15    intermediate??|pg||
nt|roswolf: support double position!? after 1@S|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|puncher99: feels like a 4diam bid is better|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Been interesting. Need to go back where I shall be. See u later.|pg||
nt|puncher99: ok bye|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand has improved to point 4@S bid seems right|pg||
nt|peachy: Quinn in other room bid 4D instead of 3|pg||
nt|puncher99: pard is usually 65 on these colors|pg||
nt|gambit: Thames...naw, bench player, not enough pop to play everyday |pg||
nt|odysseus69: he decided against 1NT -presumably planing to raise major|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: choosing to ignore the spade suit worked out ok this time|pg||
nt|stewball: chunky weak 2|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ybob: on a good day win 6@D, cold if no @S lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia's turn to check out Levin's table.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i like to forget i have hearts with West and respond 1NT suggesting clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: IDENTICAL AUCTION AS OTHER ROOM SO FAR|pg||
nt|roswolf: rdbl showing HX in spades|pg||
nt|barnets: xx shows 2 spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah not quality then!?|pg||
nt|barnets: so North may compete|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|stewball: suit pref by bramley|pg||
nt|barnets: missed part score n/s|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be a push as well|pg||
mb|3C|nt|peachy: We can be fairly sure it is not S who is hesitating|pg||
nt|barnets: with spades and diamonds both making|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|puncher99: lol|pg||
nt|gambit: just look at that opener, Al Roth would be apopletic|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: and spades break nicely here  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but can she handle 4 @S?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|santyclz: 9 top tricks in nt, sometimes preempts work.|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Q@C onside is big help|pg||
nt|tarekr:  however it will still depend on how she handles @c's if she has to do it herself|pg||
nt|stewball: or not|pg||
nt|barnets: diamond ruffs can beat 2@S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|casenjo:  on the road to making 5|pg||

nt|casenjo:  well 4 now|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|tarekr:  home free even with @d ruff|pg||
nt|ybob: why not ruff @C to 11 tricks ?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|casenjo:  I don't know, that was my play|pg||
nt|tarekr:  I agree with you Cam.|pg||
nt|gambit: marrooned in the dummy...yikes|pg||
nt|tarekr:  about Al Roth|pg||
pc|c9|nt|casenjo:  I was a little surprised|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gambit: he has to play a heart, but then what?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Frank Budai|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphpl3: licytacji niestety nie widzialam|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: Welcome, Frank.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Short break for Zimmermann and Fleisher.|pg||
nt|barnets: flat boards so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Now Multon and Kamil have left the room.|pg||
nt|barnets: 6-5 cayne in other match after 9 boards|pg||
nt|barnets: with same hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6 is leading|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Everyone returning....|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be feeling a bit better now |pg||
nt|tarekr:  for certain|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: It was a @d loser anyway.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|frankaus: just on daybreak here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dJ|mc|8|pg||
qx|c5|st||md|3SQ2HKQ87DK9864CT4,S84H6543DTCAQJ832,SKJT93HT9DQJ3CK96,SA765HAJ2DA752C75|sv|n|nt|rv: if Cronier had @cK this would be an excellent defense since declarer can't test @hs before playing @cs (only hope is @Ck inside on 4-1 @h break)|pg||
nt|tarekr:  yeah rite I lost the begining of the auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: final contract 4 s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|tarekr:  they play 2-way NMF|pg||
nt|duschek: As mentioned earlier, EW open almost all hands with 10 HCP and a 5cM, so this one is not even close to passing for Bjarnarson|pg||
nt|sybarra: "any 10"  opening |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fair enough, but it's now impossible to imagine Fantunes duplicating the OR result|pg||
nt|sybarra: W likely to jump in hts?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rv: Westheimer leading by 1 IMP actually here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 5@D 2(3) down |pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: I think 2nt is a limit raise perhaps with 4 spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 5@d good save here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by East means a H in @D |pg||
nt|kit: he might take the save now|pg||
nt|duschek: 3@C is probably Bergen, showing some 7-9 points and 4-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 7 cards and weak hand 5@D is automathics|pg||
nt|sybarra: some sort of ht support I assume|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Explained as diamonds by the vugraph operator|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W are doing well ... they are on the way to heavily pushing N/S around|pg||
nt|warrens:  Nickell decides he's not good enough to bid 1@S, then 2@H, so he raised directly with 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: after Quinn's 4@d, maybe Mildred should have taken push|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North shows a good raise to 4@S, in the context of his previous pass|pg||
nt|duschek: In that context East's 3@H looks quite odd|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but n/s seriously got pushed around at other table|pg||
nt|warrens:  no 1@S overcall and no 2@S balance by N.  cautious at unfavorable.  as a passed hand, I'm surprised he didn't bid 1@S|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|duschek: West has so great diamonds that he decided one of them might as well be a trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bad eyes from operator|pg||
nt|bjacobs: ok, so 3@C did show hearts, and then 4@D was natural - it all starts to make sense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: writing small and long way from me|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rv: 5@d would be excellent especially if West had @h length instead of @cs, even now only 2 down|pg||
nt|tarekr:  she thinks she can beat 4@s that's why she passed|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d instead of 3 like other table seems to have worked better here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West can stabilise a @C|pg||
nt|kit: he will have to lose a second spade trick unless something strange happens, so down 3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W might be "happy" to have pushed to the 5 level|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even if East now bids on, I don't think N/S will go overboard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They both have two many secondary cards in the red suits|pg||
nt|bjacobs: too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But 6@D is close to making if you guess hearts|pg||
nt|duschek: East should be 6@D, it seems - those three small spades tell him that there will be many tricks available for both sides|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Probably a trick short|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: try ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, there is a lot of work to do in 6@D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|psyck: I'm guessing Lauria would have opened 4@s with S's hand deal 3 :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Sorry, with only 3 spades.  New keyboard messing me up here in Toronto.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i agree with 2@D with bad suit|pg||
nt|chick: 3@H by N would have made it much harder for E to show diamond tolerance|pg||
nt|bridge_one: overall they are also a passed p|pg||
nt|psyck: @s suit is frozen, so may well escape for -2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct krishna|pg||
nt|kit: why will defense ever be forced to break spades?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even more in 6@H ... this is a very wrong contract|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: as we said earlier,  this table is not for faint of heart  (or granny)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|rv: in my view at IMPs, Mildred should take insurance at these colors|pg||
nt|duschek: Of course, Bjarnarson does not realize that Askgaard only has 3-card heart support so simply bids the sure 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right ... expecting to ruff spades with all those hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Whereas in 6@D, he was worried about ruffing spades with partner's diamonds, and then his weak diamonds being exposed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: However, it seems wrong that East never bid diamonds even once|pg||
nt|duschek: The unlucky expert...|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This will be tough for Ralph Katz to find Tricks.  Best to ruff as many diamonds as possible, but might try to set up clubs.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, straight finesse too risky - could lose diamond, 2 hearts and a club.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: I think that, having bid 5@H, he could have offered 6@D as an alternative|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tarekr:  Venky you r rite because there is also the possibility 5@d makes|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Remote possibility I should say :)|pg||
nt|kit: I'm sort of surprised by this line of play.  Ace of hearts was only sure entry to dummy, so seems like it should have been used for spade finesse|pg||
nt|psyck: @sQ & @dQ are entries to @c|pg||
nt|kit: they are, but declarer doesn't know that|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: 3 down is ok, so to use A@H to make the finesse in @S is a risk to go 4 down|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d2|mc|8|nt|sybarra: maybe should not have touched trumps?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Now, Katz is down to 2@H and 1@S loser, nicely down|pg||
pg||

nt|tarekr:  back hampton only down 4 imps. 4@s went down at other table|pg||
nt|peachy: Hampton creating distance, but still 10 boards to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Bart is the most deliberate player at the table, but this was the first hand that he|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: showed it.|pg||
nt|gambit: Will Hamman open, yes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: They are going at twice our speed- and I am committed for 8.30 gmt so lets gee them up here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: looks a flattish bd again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-17 vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if they play a form of Texas Transfer|pg||
nt|odysseus69: its only a question of how long until 650|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if so -- most play it thru interference of 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will bid heart related and west will show his spades etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so responder can jump to show either major|pg||
mb|2H|mb|4D|an|spades|nt|santyclz: Probably have votes for 1, 2, 3 and 4.|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West sure looks like a hand where you'd want partner to declare via transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I guess they don't use Texas transfers in Monaco.|pg||
nt|roswolf: is north tempted by the colors to sac?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: making it a close match again |pg||
nt|peachy: Limited 1H (strong club)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gambit: why not 2NT forcing |pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|chick: 3@S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphpl3: wyniki na ¿ywo http://www.kongres-slawa.pl/2011/k7.html|pg||
nt|frankaus:  needs a @C switch to set it|pg||
nt|tarekr:  interesting NT but 2@d would be NMF probably|pg||
nt|gambit: woops|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Both sides writing something about the 3NT call.|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like800|pg||
nt|odysseus69: was 2D a transfer or single major- think north expected 6 hearts|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: Kamil was treating his hand as 1-suiter   2@D is 1-major|pg||
nt|roswolf: south 's distribution will be disappointing for declarer|pg||
nt|barnets: not much of a save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but only costs 4 imps|pg||
nt|barnets: North really hoping e/w go on to 5@S and be down|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|gambit: nice to know that.....must be a system tweak by their coach .. :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: someone I know says when pd does this -"if you want to save go to the bank"|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|peachy: As N, I wouldn't know what to lead against this auction|pg||
nt|tarekr:  2NT is forcing indeed. It gives P a chance to complete his pattern.|pg||
nt|barnets: thats nice|pg||
pc|s9|nt|casenjo:  nowhere for tricks to escape to, looks like only 9 tricks here|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|peachy: but maybe H regardless of opening|pg||

nt|duschek: Still a successful sacrifice against the 5@S that was, or was not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: quite true ... the big problem was the other room|pg||
nt|casenjo:  nicely done|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: I have to step out for 20 minutes ... will return.  Probably I'll only miss one hand!|pg||
nt|duschek: Apart from that, I agree with your point. If partner does not have long diamonds, he will retreat to hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: again looks like issue with other room |pg||
nt|casenjo:  And a tied match after 5 boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|psyck: will likely pass i suppose|pg||
nt|kareno: Not a great suit but north wants to get into the auction in case west has only four hearts.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h is natural, hearts, for the specs asking.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, at this vul, worth getting into auction by N with good shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: pretty ratty heart suit for this bid, even over something like Qxxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|ady: this looks a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|kareno: South obviously thinks north has some sort of 5/5 takeout!!|pg||
nt|ady: fortunately  not too much grief|pg||
nt|kareno: So they are lucky and land on their feet.|pg||
nt|psyck: I suppose S was did not take it as Natural & N passed assuming misunderstanding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C polish, so 15/18|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rv: coffee deal here|pg||
nt|tarekr:  How about a Tea Party deal here:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead by Versace.|pg||
nt|psyck: there are several bids like 2@d, 1NT, Double to show other suits, so it is common to play 2@h as natural as the 1@h could come with weak hands & you are sitting above the suit|pg||
nt|duschek: 1@S is forcing to game, so West's pass is for takeout|pg||
nt|duschek: You might say that Monaco needed those 12 imps on the previous board|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rv: Tarek, same deals played in Spingold and Wagar?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no|pg||
nt|kit: so they have to open 2@C with 5+ clubs or lose the suit?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is forcing (after 1@S 7+)|pg||
nt|psyck: both 1@c & 2@c can have @c suits|pg||
nt|psyck: just that 2@c is limited, like prec|pg||
nt|kit: I mean with minimal opening|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many told me that 2@C is forcing in polish club - i amn't sure about this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s limited (of course) but dont means weak like in natural !|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like it is forcing, otherwise it would be pretty risky on that big a hand|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|tarekr:  I don't think so! anyone?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it is forcing -- to game in this sequence|pg||
nt|duschek: Askgaard can almost visualize short diamonds in East. He will not be that enthusiastic about his 16 HCP. They were fine when the auction started, but with the opponents bidding ...|pg||
nt|duschek: hearts, that doubleton @HKQ is not particularly wonderful|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 1@C 1@d , 2@C isn't forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@c 1M , 2@C is forcing (of course) bec 1M 7+|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: can E pass?  guess not|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|bridge_one: 1@C 1M 2@C 2@S isn't a strong hand, but i think forcing 1 because can hold 9 points !|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
mc|11|nt|duschek: No, 1@S is forcing to game, so if anybody should take a chance, West should be the one. After all, East has more or less denied 10 HCP, having passed initially.|pg||

nt|puncher99: wht does 3c mean?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Well, it certainly isn't dull.|pg||
nt|peachy: 3C tends to me, to confirm what I said about 2D. E has spade support in case partner had 2-suiter with spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 3@c alerted on both side.  No explanation asked for or given.|pg||
nt|peachy: EW play Flannery so 1S should promise 5|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Other tables are a bit noisy.  Seems there are some lively system discussions:|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: not in English...|pg||
nt|gambit: Declarer didn't get here with just his charming personality, very tough, but he will go with the odds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia annoyed at the distraction|pg||
nt|gambit: the room (I was just here) is samll, it was silent when I was there, so i assume he should be annoyed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welland has his head in his hands, rocking back and forth in the chair.|pg||
nt|gambit: I love those details....thx |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Now he puts on his glasses to study dummy.  Not even close to playing a card.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia and Hamman are sitting like statues.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Here we go:|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: Seems only fair.  EW have been bidding N's suits.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Valerie does a double take at the bidding when the tray is passed to her side of|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the table.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this could get very ugly to play, 4@H is better|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H should be off 1 on the spade lead so in that light, 4S is not much worse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is making double dummy as several spectators have noted|pg||
nt|ybob: 3nt is the best spot from E than W|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Minutes of boredom interspersed with seconds of furious action.|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice quote ross:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: I like 3@h here though slightly risky|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: gives Cronier a a difficult problem|pg||
nt|rv: Cronier can't double with only doubleton @s, choices are to pass or bid 4n asking partner to pick minor|pg||
nt|psyck: no game makes, but someone will get to some game here likely|pg||
nt|kareno: Our Operator is new to the game and doing very well :)|pg||
nt|duschek: So this should be a standard 1NT for Nunes, 12-14 and (5422)|pg||

nt|bridge_one: same auction in open room|pg||
nt|casenjo:  welcome back|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Nickell has chosen a tough lead for Cayne, a spade would have made it very easy|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe give up @cA, play low @s to J, get 3@s, 2@h, 2@d, 2@c tricks & lose 2@h, 1@s, 1@c|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I've been told that Mr. Hamman got a @S lead|pg||
nt|psyck: true, that would not trouble him|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Cayne has a lot of choices here. Must work out best %.  We can see all the cards.|pg||
nt|psyck: duck 1@h & start @c maybe|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Playing for 3-3 in either black suit; leading up to jack of spades, lead to 9@C and the slim chance of Kx@D onside|pg||
nt|casenjo:  All lead to the possible 9th trick, but which wins???|pg||
nt|casenjo:  easy when you see all the cards|pg||
nt|psyck: 1st knock out @cA, that is only sure communication in case @h's unfav|pg||
nt|psyck: also you may have 9 tricks without going to opps after knocking out @cA, if @c & @d or @s fav|pg||
nt|casenjo:  But one kibbitzer has pointed out that a club to the 9 is what he likes since "it virtually gets me home if it works with a lotta choices"|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Where is Michael Rosenberg when you need him? He knows ALL the % :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i think rosenberg would burst out laughing about @c to the 9 hi there|pg||

nt|xenya: how did it go down in OR|pg||
nt|psyck: operator likely missed the play|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: lynch made a basic mistake, winning the @C opening lead with the J, then no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: dec must have lost track somewhere, all normal lines should make|pg||
nt|kit: club lead, declarer continued clubs, ruffed, diamond to queen and king, another club, and couldn't handle it after that apparently|pg||
nt|psyck: @d ruff entries were there still, could have made by playing @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@h is ON for sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but must call 4@H|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Duboin can pass|pg||
nt|chick: bridge is a game of mistakes, she still makes fewer than I do :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3N is possible, yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i bet Duboin  first: pass, second 3N|pg||
nt|duschek: Here we have the 15 balanced included in the strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: not the beast lead other room...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bridge_one: 3@h is very conservative by Sementa|pg||
nt|kit: West had difficult to evaluate -- he thinks king of spades worthless on auction.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree with Duboin pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: best even, or should i say beastial lead|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt not the best contract either.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 5@c is comfy, but normal to end in 3N|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@s to show a stopper I guess here. |pg||
nt|psyck: they may just not see enough values or shape to be in 5 level & with a different arrangement of cards 3N may be superior|pg||
nt|chick: Will N figure that one is enough?|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, S needs to be declarer in NT to protect that K, so perhaps best to just bid it now|pg||
nt|kareno: Kt9 doesn't need much  protection.|pg||
nt|chick: (if she's going to try for it)|pg||
nt|kareno: Zmudzinski led the A of @h in the OR against 3nt - definitely NOT best.|pg||
nt|chick: It could happen here too, if she shows a spade stopper|pg||
nt|kareno: But they won't lead a heart if west doubles spades, I'm sure.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only chance is try 3N with K10xxx in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: getting to 4 @S is questiong here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: @d three times virtually beats this|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rv: West employed garbage stayman here, intending to pass any bid by partner|pg||
nt|kareno: So this WILL be a pickup for Cayne.|pg||
nt|duschek: Actually, I seem to recall that Askgaard has told me that 1@S is 100% forcing to game. It is true that they used to be able to show 15 balanced and then stop below game, but they ...|pg||
nt|duschek: have abandoned this possibility.|pg||

pc|d3|nt|tarekr:  exact. A good tool|pg||
nt|rv: such auctions normally cry for trump lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hi again|pg||
nt|sybarra: re|pg||
nt|duschek: Instead they try to have 8 good HCP at least for their positive responses, hoping that 15+8 will often equal to game when necessary|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: 15+8 = game, hmm|pg||
nt|bjacobs: that's not the math they taught me at bridge school|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have the play the hand better Bill :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: quite so|pg||
nt|duschek: 1NT is a relay, 2NT shows 8-11 HCP with 6+@S and a 4-card minor. 3@C asks which one, and 3@D shows diamonds, the distribution not being a 6421 type|pg||
nt|duschek: Sorry, 3NT shows diamonds etc.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: N and E whispering, can't hear it.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, this should be a push|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: because it would need a direct @h 10 hook, which, this time, is clearly against the odds|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|duschek: So to sum up, West knows that East has 6+@S4@D, but not a 6421 type|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|duschek: If East's whispering is loud enough, North will know that too|pg||
nt|sybarra: again,  faster than a speeding bullet |pg||
nt|casenjo:  On  the last hand, Cayne made 4 on the line of 9@H-3@H-J@H-!A|pg||
nt|casenjo:  trick 2 K@C|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: doesn't want to make 11 tricks as not in 5@c?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|casenjo:  On @H return Katz unblocked the !Q letting Cayne set up the 7@H|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tarekr:  Avons-nous des spectateurs Francais?|pg||
nt|rv: should go 1 down on accurate defense|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|ritong: now, if defense delays the third @d, declarer can pitch on the second @s|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: Always justify your bidding!|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s opennig minimized the losses there i guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: all players on a break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: E probably a little careless with second club play seemed momentarily unhappy with W pass|pg||
nt|kit: not careless -- just trying to make as many tricks as he can.  Why should he suspect 7-1 split?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: everyone in a good mood two very evenly matched teams|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, they were tied at end of 1st set & scores still close|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hoverwev i would bid dbl over 2@S two suit hand weak|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because with a 2 suit hand 3@H can be a big risk finding long @D at the partner|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and bec i have the force to bid 3@H over 3@C|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|psyck: considerately not allow pd to figure out you missed game|pg||
nt|ritong: and preserve his choice|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|duschek: 8 boards in 90 minutes is not impressive. Or maybe it is.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: 1N for me|pg||
mb|3H|nt|duschek: 8 HCP forcing to game opposite what could be 15 balanced. This time Bjarnarson saves Bill the trouble of calculating 15+8 and comparing against bridge school requirements for game|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W seem to have missed a fairly easy slam in the OR|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridge_one: all people told me 1N :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chick: mainly because no good rebid after 1@S |pg||
nt|bridge_one: i agree with 1@S|pg||
nt|poohbear: Would you dbl with the West hand Kit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  welcome back folks. The show is on!|pg||
nt|kit: much as I dislike opening 1NT with a 5-card major, this hand really does have notrump written on it.|pg||
nt|xenya: i believe they hardly ever open 1N with a 5-card major|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, thank you ... |pg||
nt|sybarra: guess that is the 1 @S game force again |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: bonsoir:)|pg||
nt|rv: double of 3@h is negative|pg||
nt|rv: bonjour Henri|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Welcome Henri|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: 1@S is a relay - 2@D shows 8-11 HCP and precisely 5 hearts + 4 or 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  3@S red?|pg||
nt|psyck: experimental :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tarekr:  bonsoir Henri|pg||
nt|chick: a nice comfortable game, even with a 4-1 split|pg||
nt|ritong: i m not sure the @h xxxx dictates such a move|pg||
pc|sT|nt|duschek: 2@H asks which minor, and 2@S shows exactly 4 clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: Probably would not double opposite passed hand -- downside greater than upside vul vs. not|pg||
nt|psyck: double is tempting, but for the vul|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C give the raise in @S (after passed hand) - so 3N by N is perfect|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The OR auction makes a point that is quite well known in the expert world|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: playing matchpoints, would be an other story, and even so|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I'm not sure I want a spade lead|pg||
nt|psyck: even mp, it's a defensive & not offensive hand, at wrong vul|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|duschek: 2NT=relay, 3@C=2524|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is that a 2@C overcall of a natural 1@D opening is a powerful weapon|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: seamon would have bid 4@h anyways|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Well, I'm glad to be back.........;)|pg||
nt|psyck: we'd be gladder if the table did not keep flickering in & out of vision though|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Probably WiFi Bruce ????|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so|pg||
nt|casenjo:  You're doing great under the circumstance|pg||
nt|ritong: internet is pure magic, but sometimes a bit fragile|pg||
nt|ritong: our operator understandably lost track, especially with seamon who is faster than a rocket  let s wait for the claim|pg||
nt|warrens:  certainly can make this, but the handling isn't so easy.  ducking a @D, planning to take 1@S, 1@D, 2@C's + 6 trumps seems reasonable|pg||
nt|psyck: connections have generally been fine this Spingold so far|pg||
nt|ritong: hello warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi Henri. had to step out for a couple minutes, but with you all now.|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  I would like to know how he played this|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I do not know who to root for!!! Having dinner with Michael Seamon next week and visiting Ralph and Martha Katz in Chicago Aug. 12th.... oh my!|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rv: Willard had a tough problem on 3@h, ideally she would have liked 4th @s or hcp or 2 more for negative double at this level|pg||
nt|warrens:  root for good bridge and an exciting finish|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: West felt he didn't have enough for 2@H, and so the easy slam was lost|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|duschek: 3@D=relay, 3@S=0 aces (of 4)|pg||
nt|duschek: Tough for Bjarnarson now - should he continue relaying with 4@C, or bid 4@D to invite slam in hearts and let partner in on the conversation?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yawn..... |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: disconnect, missed nothing.|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if they will finish all the hands in the set|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: I'm sure they will.  The question is more what day (or week) that will occur|pg||
nt|duschek: So relaying, 4@D=1 king|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rv: trump promotion with still a @c to come even if declarer ruffs with @SJ and draws trumps here|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he knows that if partner has the KQ of @H, slam is laydown on 2-2 trump or 3-3 @D or the J of @D with W or falling doubleton.  I think that's enough to go |pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh yes, this will be bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  so, he can just ask in trump|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sybarra: system so complex, they might not be able to use Josephine|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|kit: It is worth noting that 4@S is not cold if defense goes passively.|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well just bid it!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|duschek: He should probably have bid 4NT to ask partner which king he held - this contract might be very silly if West held a different king|pg||
nt|duschek: Or 5@H as the naturalists suggest|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems to me that Helgemo - Helness are having a truly awful set in the OR ... they are about down 40 imps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's not an automatic make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The slam is around 75% on a spade lead (you have to refuse the finesse).  On a non-spade lead, it increases to about 88%|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Sorry, BBO system got tired of waiting, took a short break :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Reds or blacks?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how many lead for jxxx? but maybe this auction permits you to do so |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think all 4 suits are possible opening leads|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so will make no attempt to predict|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As I said in the other room, they have promised to finish this set before noon European time, in about 8 hours|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they have another set tonight?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Really?  I can't see Fantunes making such a rash promise|pg||
nt|duschek: EW play naturalish initial responses to 1@C. This means that relay sequences often reveal declarer's hand. There are versions of this system trying to avoid that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, that has to be a serious weakness|pg||
nt|bjacobs: With relay auctions, it's pretty important to make the relayer declarer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: wherever possible|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, West should not be allowed to bid a 5c major over 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe reverse them?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: many do|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H = spades, 1@S = hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fantoni is going to give his lead full consideration.  I just hope he knows it IS his lead|pg||
nt|duschek: Their relay sequences are according to Grøtheim's original book on the system - for some reason they have decided not to change that, although most other Danish pairs using this ...|pg||
nt|duschek: system switch the major suits in one way or the other|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's very hard to comment on the lead, because we don't know what Nunes' double meant|pg||
nt|duschek: Another popular choice is 1@H=@S, 1@S=balanced, 1NT=hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Does Fulvio know he is on lead is the question|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is we dont see a black suit lead|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 1N easy after the auction|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psyck: sure, I'd stop doubling 2@h otherwise|pg||
nt|chick: the X is for a lead ... unless you have agreement with partner that it also shows a playable suit, I'd be cautious|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: is PO in the room? |pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: 1NT=clubs, any strength; 3@D=GF with 3@D5+@C|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Now, that is an aggressive auction!|pg||
nt|ritong: indeed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psyck: indeed, 3@s would not occur to most :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tarekr:  also lho because they bid short m's often|pg||
nt|warrens:  this lead is helpful to declarer, but not enough|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: somehow needs a bare QJ in either black suit|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, no way to avoid a loser in each suit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: also, béné and sylvie oplay "sandwich" 1NT as natural, i guess like a vast majority nowadays|pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, looks like a loser in each suit and no Devil's Coup here for the vanishing Spade trick|pg||
nt|ritong: although @cs are double hookable|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: I am surprised Von Arnim climbed up to 5@h in the deal where Willard-Cronier had misunderstanding to play in 4n, lucky she was not doubled|pg||
nt|tarekr:  sandwich is on the vane I believe.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Cronier closed screen and asked for a review of the auction, but was told it is too late|pg||
nt|rv: normally you lose less if both sides of partnership have bad result on same deal, IMP scale is such|pg||
nt|psyck: it has to be a suit also, cannot risk x otherwise|pg||
nt|kareno: You need a suit to make those doubles - otherwise you can end up defending 2@h redoubled :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: at 2L you have to have some lebgth else its too dangerous to act|pg||
nt|kareno: I think three of us are aligned on that subject :)|pg||
nt|chick: I not disagreeing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: strange 1N by Duboin :) he is prudent ... |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, glad to see he was not getting frivolous|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|xenya: also, S might have a stronger hand|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|bigtrain: some are just faster typists than others :)|pg||
nt|chick: but I still advocate caution, NS are vul, EW have the balance of points, all you have is heart length|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ritong: katz will no doubt go for that|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: sooner or later|pg||
nt|psyck: may should have sooner due to lack of entries|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure he could afford to wait|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Nickell's 'dream' on this hand would have come true if Katz had 17 HCP with Ace@D instead of the King|pg||
nt|ritong: or @d xx(x)|pg||
nt|ritong: which is the best holding facing a shortness|pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes! with stronger spades or clubs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: Club king is a value.  If you're afraid, stay home :)|pg||
nt|ritong: now, seamon would not underlead @c QJ|pg||
nt|ritong: so perhaps the best shot is to play for QJ bare offside|pg||
nt|ritong: seamon would not underlead @cs because dummy is poor with entries|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rv: surprised Mildred didn't review it, presume sportswoman spirit right?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ritong: i m not enthusiastic either about such conformism|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: after the hand, Cronier asks what Breed had opened and everyone laughed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I think the rules are clear on that|pg||

mb|3D|nt|chick: lots of ideas from kibs ... 4@S kickback?  4@D last train?  my guess is 4@D shows both minor suit aces|pg||

mb|2D|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This is what I was talking about before ... in Fantunes, you have to open 1NT on all sorts of shapes, including this one|pg||

nt|bjacobs: All 5422 shapes, except both majors|pg||

nt|ritong: 2@d = any game force|pg||
mb|3H|nt|tarekr:  2@h neg|pg||
nt|kareno: Perhaps 2@h.  Perhaps 1nt.  It is a tough choice and 2@d is okay too.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: on 41 N lead @D, and delarer in 6@H won and played @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|psyck: 2@h also a possibility even 43 cannot be bad at 2 level|pg||
nt|bridge_one: KQJx over the sgl is the worst figure for N :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: So Shirley's guess of "red" was a good one|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|warrens:  this looks pretty flat.  might even make an overtrick.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: with very poor @s's, my preference would be for 2@d or 2@h|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: sylvie considers her hand as balanced, more precisely 3 of a minor would show seven cards, basically|pg||
nt|tarekr:  or always required|pg||
nt|sybarra: so I won,    not a black suit lead|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rv: on likely @s lead or shift, 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: men overboard here|pg||
nt|duschek: Well, if EW believe that 15+8 produce game, NS might believe the same for 12+11|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: S won @CA, and returened @D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: not more that 8 tricks for declarer - the defence is obvious|pg||
nt|kit: playing a club not safe now, as defence could cash winners and promote a trump trick if West has the queen|pg||
nt|ritong: and east 4:@s|pg||
nt|kit: or if East has 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, to promote the Q 4@S must be in east :)|pg||
nt|ritong: @ds a natural chance, yes, so declarer has to draw trumps without informations|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: I think 2@D is safest ... if partner can't stand it, then he has somewhere else to go|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|psyck: yes 2@d most normal, 2@h could lead pd to expect 4 with you|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: Same total, 23.  And this deal just goes to show that 23 is usually not enough.  Even with the heart finesse on, and spades as friendly as can be|pg||
nt|duschek: They will probably complain that clubs do not behave as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Sorry, system froze after bidding on 41|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sure, the club is off, and that is a killer ...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: Exactly and that suit bears rebidding.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Correct, if I interpret the hand gestures correctly.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: However they are  pinpointing the lead.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Lauria on a break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: back|pg||
nt|kareno: Lauria smokes so he's always running for a puff |pg||
nt|psyck: e.g., if the @s's were 53 you may end up getting a lot of ruffs in @h contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 4@S for E/W are possible to call|pg||
nt|duschek: So 23 HCP is normally all you need for a game|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c in other room a Ghestem style bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: goddammit|pg||
nt|ritong: nickell's hand certainly deserves an overcall, but which one?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|psyck: In Ghestem, cue shows top 2 suits, 2N bottom two, & 3@c top & bottom suits|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: ty Henri, Tarek can add this info to his encyclopedia if it is not already there:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: what is their 2@C opening?|pg||
nt|chick: as long as the defense doesn't lead hearts :)|pg||
nt|ritong: extremely|pg||
nt|psyck: possible to make, calling is the tough part|pg||
nt|duschek: We can learn a lot from watching these guys. They can too.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: back to remedial school for me, apparently|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: Helgemo bid 4@S (after a takeout double):  the pressure bid, but technically a violation of the Law ... and he was justly punished|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: yes, they tend to do that when you least expect it, nasty people|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This 3@H bid, whatever it means, is legal, and probably successful|pg||
nt|duschek: I am not sure about the EW methods, but there should definitely be a bid available for showing a "Bergen 6-9" raise of spades. Perhaps that's 3@H.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Whatever your methods, Bergen, or any other, the point is this:  with a weak hand and 4 card support, you take yourself to the 3 level|pg||
nt|duschek: Agree|pg||
nt|casenjo:  lots of the top players are now playing systems where 2 suiters are known, this works for both Michael's Cue Bids and Unusual NT|pg||
nt|psyck: it is arguably superior to Michaels as you get to show specific suits|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|ritong: semi forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@s is XL, 2@d is XXL|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: 2@c*|pg||
nt|tarekr:  fg to 2Nt or 3 of a major Henri?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and being red,  doubt fluvio can come back in |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Spec suggests that at this vulnerability, 4@S is the right choice, but I don't agree.  The vul only changes the size of your minus swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i think responder can pass 2@c 2@d 2M|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h is support stronger that 3@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S is sufficient 13 hcp unbalanced|pg||
nt|psyck: actually, Ghestem is slightly different, though there are many variations i guess. http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Ghestem.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the "do something smart" X,    |pg||
nt|psyck: so cue is top & bottom & not as i mentioned|pg||
pc|s3|nt|duschek: Yes, that amounts to saying that the opponents will always make game at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tarekr:  OK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nunes has a counter to it ... he asks Fantoni to "do something smart"|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfc: a reminder that our BBO score if off by one; Westheimer has one fewer IMP than shown|pg||
nt|ritong: regarding albarran, his carreer ended in the 50's, he started in 1935 to participate to world events|pg||
nt|rv: this lead should help declarer here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A sensitive auction by N/S, but they will struggle to make 4@D|pg||
nt|duschek: Of course, game may make, in which case 4@S will work out fine, but it is certainly not guaranteed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But a raise to the 3-level doesn't stop PARTNER from trying 4@S|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chick: not sure I approve of setting up the @SJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: so his convention must have seen the light in 1940 or so|pg||
nt|ritong: how would you tackle @ds? ace first?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|duschek: Right - West should show his hand type, and East should make the final decision.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really important "bread and butter" competitive hand.  Much more instructive than those 23+8 things :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: W was certain to have one of the royal honors|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: ace of hearts, king of diamonds, queen of spades.  Need 2 out of 3 to be right in order to make, so basically a tossup.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 15+8, I should say|pg||
nt|duschek: 23+8 should be enough for game though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: with a competent declarer, certainly |pg||
nt|bjacobs: anyway, this is a tough hand for Fantoni to play|pg||
nt|sybarra: the competent declarer is not an issue for this table |pg||
nt|duschek: This also needs about 10 overtricks to equal the result from the open room. Fantoni will get used to it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: over 20 minutes behind on clock|pg||
pc|hK|nt|duschek: Not many losers, but must be very careful|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|warrens:  for sure, draw trump, then the safety play in @D's|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rv: so rare to see a convention last so many years|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: especially a heavy one like that one, but it has some positive aspects|pg||
nt|ritong: like knowing the color of a possible ace with responder|pg||
nt|rv: maybe Willard was better off to ruff a @d before cashing @cs|pg||
nt|kareno: Good heart shift|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I feel he needs to find @HJ, and it's in the less likely hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet he feels that trick is good news/bad news  trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, smells like 4-1 diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East being less likely to duck with @DKJx|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A strong spec has pointed out to me that maybe West is more likely to have @HJ in his 7-9 range|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Let's see, West has @SK, and nothing in diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So if East has @HA, then West must have the other two honours|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: small @D now|pg||
nt|psyck: game much better after South bids of course|pg||
nt|bridge_one: discarding 3@C in the dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: got no pigeon that time, kit|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chick: needed to switch to a red suit and diamonds was clearly out|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Hmm, Fantoni has drawn exactly this conclusion|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|chick: the @SQ might have put a lot more pressure on declarer ... forcing a ruff|pg||
nt|kareno: Are we still waiting for Versace?|pg||
nt|duschek: Though the singleton diamonds counts for some of the 7-9 points|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: likely 1 down now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: could still ruff a diamond and throw E in with a spade|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: no, we are waiting for more exciting hands|pg||
nt|kareno: All in due course :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart now can promote an extra trump trick for south.|pg||
nt|psyck: ruff @h with 9, @d to A , pitch @dQ on @h etc|pg||
nt|kareno: I said 'can' not 'will' - west needs to be careful.  But a low heart is troublesome to him.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: trump Q before @da before |pg||
nt|duschek: Making now - East will get two trump tricks, but no more|pg||
nt|duschek: But that's 5 imps for Bjarnarson|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's only a partscore deal, but this is a really good hand, both bidding and play|pg||

nt|xenya: 10 or 11?|pg||
nt|duschek: And of course interesting play too|pg||
nt|psyck: yes A 1st is the safety play in @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ritong: katz' hand is worth a mild try|pg||
nt|casenjo:  So, Cayne picks up 2 more for a 9 IMP lead in a very low scoring 1st quarter|pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: 10 confirmed|pg||
nt|duschek: West must bid 2@D, as 2@H would be non-forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see how they proceed to show that|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Transfer perhaps.  |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rv: @d lead would scuttle both 3n and 4@s|pg||
nt|duschek: Actually, with a minimum hand, 2@C denies four diamonds. 3@C shows a minimum hand with a club single-suiter|pg||
mb|4C|nt|tarekr:  I think that playing only 4 in such an event is wearing even on the best of them!|pg||
nt|chick: 1@H shows spades over a 1@C opening ... the 2@S bid shows 5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2N raise of course|pg||
nt|ritong: that way|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This could be the 'flat hand slam try'|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: If Askgaard asks for distribution with 3@D, I wonder which lie Bjarnarson will prefer|pg||
nt|duschek: The system bid would be for Bjarnarson to open 1@D, but one can imagine why he hated that|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit weird, but..|pg||
nt|casenjo:  hard to believe it is Gerber, and it certainly doesn't look like a splinter|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Vugraphzfc: passing French mints around the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: 3@H would show any 6322, 3@S shows any 6331, and anything else would have shown at least 7 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: the atmosphere here has been very pleasant in this set|pg||
nt|psyck: non @h lead, had chances for 12 the way the minors are placed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rv: technically low @d lead is right lead with no semblance of entry in Cronier's hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they are good (the mints)|pg||
nt|ritong: grr|pg||
nt|ritong: slam is awful, to say the least both rooms did well to avoid it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: Good practical bid by Mike Passell.|pg||
nt|duschek: So he reasonably decided to show the hand as 3136, which is confirmed by 4@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Which leaves West in a tricky position|pg||
nt|warrens:  was that a balanced try or a fake splinter?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Didn't like the singleton heart longer spades ... I can understand why they have missed this slam|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Have to credit H-H here ... this is a hand where you can know too much, and talk yourself out of slam|pg||
pc|sA|mc|11|nt|ahollan1: maybe West needed to break out of relays to set @C for slam investigation|pg||

nt|duschek: Sorry, West had...|pg||

nt|casenjo:  Doesn't make much sense|pg||
nt|ritong: well, either 4@c is a try or it s not|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: no comment:)|pg||
nt|tarekr:  my vote!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|chick: 13 clubs or diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: reduce that to three and you get mine|pg||
nt|rv: yes in my view as well, both pairs might even be in top 3 in my book:)|pg||
nt|ritong: particularly auken/von arnim|pg||
nt|psyck: a tad more tricks in @d|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bridge_one: 3N can be hard to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|chick: oops, only 7@D, not 7@C, sorry|pg||
nt|kareno: Likely to play in diamonds but the pressure is on with the spade suit.|pg||
nt|psyck: the typical problem with strong @c system, at 5 level you have to start bidding suits for 1st time|pg||
nt|chick: a couple of kibs are pointing out that there is a squeeze for 7C as well|pg||
nt|kareno: Right you are.  See you all later - have to run!!  Thanks to all :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|tarekr:  if in 3 naturally in 5 LOL|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, the @sT is a nice card to have in 7N|pg||
nt|ritong: for the record, some play 1NT 2@h 2@s 4@s as a mild try  i do, and so does cayne, for example|pg||
nt|casenjo:  me too|pg||
mb|3N|nt|duschek: So 13 imps for Monaco, and the match is close once more|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: you get the drift|pg||
nt|chick: first they have to get past the 5 level :)|pg||
nt|xenya: on the @SQ lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good lead - many lead 5@S with that figure|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kit: yes, danger defense gets 2 spades 1 club, 1 diamond, 1 heart before declarer has 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: A simple auction after a weak NT (12-14) this time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some Q3 scores posted  Iceland lead over Fleisher down to 9  [was 42 at half]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-8|pg||
nt|ritong: the idea behind this is that 2@h is an "unuseful" bid, considering that playing from the strong hand is clearly overrated|pg||
nt|warrens:  hmm, is 4@C here natural or Gerber?|pg||
nt|warrens:  sounds natural to me|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, it is a common treatment with 4 level transfers used for hands with no slam interest|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when responder has no slam intentions, he simply bids 1NT 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: i'd take this as natural too|pg||
nt|psyck: N has a very good hand for the bidding so far|pg||
mb|6C|nt|rv: Henri likes dramatic effect as you would expect an artisitic frenchman:)|pg||

nt|tarekr:  We must not forget Deas-Palmer|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Betting that @H2 is suit preference|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: now jack of spades continuation is winner, but is it so obvious?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yep, and now this contract is under some pressure|pg||
nt|psyck: not sure what would be best continuation though|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: having A 10  and A J out correct the lead with Q|pg||
nt|warrens:  for the Kibs asking, 3NT by N showed extras, either 15-17 or 16-17|pg||
nt|psyck: surely could temporize with a cue|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Zia bid 3@D over 2@C which gave North a picture of tricks available, allowing him to proceed to 7NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: North has to win this and play a spade I believe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@D @S beat|pg||
nt|xenya: should be obvious after S's @S7 -- middle card from 3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|xenya: N knows S has the 9|pg||
nt|kit: Accurate defense no play now I don't believe|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer had won the first spade and gone after the red aces, the spade suit would have been blocked.  Should he have found that?|pg||
nt|xenya: also, as a few kibitzers have pointed out to me, declarer would have never ducked 1st spade wth AK9  |pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps he should "find it" as the best chance to make|pg||
nt|kit: But defense can counter I believe -- South unblocking 7 and 9 of spades|pg||
nt|kit: Well, maybe not -- then declarer ducks second spade|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rv: this is tricky hand to play, crucial @d9 might bail out declarer here|pg||

nt|stewball: i take that back,,i am convinced|pg||
nt|gambit: Zia speculated on the strategical advantages to knowing the "state of the match" No doubt if know, this would impact this last hand |pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: previous board.|pg||
nt|ybob: a clear 4@H by N|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibs say it could be Smolen.  Some play Smolen on the 3-;eve; GF, some have other agreements.|pg||

nt|puncher99: ok hope u enjoyed the match folks and fellow commentators and operator|pg||

nt|tarekr:  Thank you to all the specs and their comments. Abravo for Ross who always gives us the "scoop" and my collegues Karen and Cam|pg||

nt|kareno: And of course thanks to ACBL for letting us broadcast these great events and to Jan Martel for organizing the vugraph.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Otherwise it's just 'bridge'.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Vugraphzfe: Thanks all for your comments and compliments. It has been a fun session.|pg||
nt|tarekr:  May be they did not let Shawn bid|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|frankaus: b|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that is some bid! |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Director call.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Breed may feel there was some UI in the auction.|pg||
nt|tarekr:  5@s showed 2 w/Q and 4@c showed 5@c with 2/3 top honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the unauthorized was what?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  2/3 top honors or better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: They are discussing....|pg||
nt|tarekr:  This is part of Jacoby 2NT structure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Not too sure what the issue is...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: EW think the auction is over.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Breed claims it isn't and that she was just rearranging her pass cards on the tray.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Vugraphzfe: Too busy typing -- I missed who took that trick.|pg||
nt|sybarra: someone should smack this |pg||
nt|tarekr:  only 12 tricks in 7NT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs thanking all the commentators also :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Yes, kudos to Jan for the work she does to make this all happen|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|kareno: And what a platform we have on BBO!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: OK.  Last board and I lost the play. :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: At least it isn't a doubled slam. ;)|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Final Kudo to Roland for directing the traffic on all of this|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed!!|pg||
nt|gambit: TY Fred Gitleman, Uday, Roland, Jan and you Ross who help us share this wonderful event|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Tough to say what will happen here in this session.  Hamman and Zia have kept|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: the Nickell team still in it with the last results of this set.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Seven tricks played.  Zia has 2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia has 5.|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|sybarra: was there a rush for the ace?|pg||

nt|rv: incidentally on @SA and back for ruff and @d shift beats 4@h|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|psyck: Last deal, thanks all, see you in about 20 mins foe next set.|pg||
nt|ritong: uh?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: jimmy boy, you need a break|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rv: that could be only consolation for Westheimer though it might be too little too late for second seeds here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: This is the last board of this set, the remaining two sets will be played tonight|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks all|pg||
nt|kit: I'm really surprised by West's pass over 2@C with a singleton club and some other good features.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now dbl by east i suppose (opener can have 4@S)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: west would nid 2@H woth a top honor in @H - with xxx vuln pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: can't see a way back for Westheimer|pg||
nt|kit: Now he has to guess at the 3-level|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by sementa conservative|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@d now is a risk - probably pass by West|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: what else can he do?  No reason to expect to make 3 of anything, king of clubs bad, etc.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Mildred congratulates the French ladies and says they played well.  |pg||
nt|bridge_one:  ip refere 3D at dbl with 5 good @D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rv: I suspect German ladies will play in 4@h in CR on last deal and defense of @s ruff followed by @d shift unlikely to be found|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: The internet router is in the open room, so the wifi connection in our closed room has not been as good|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|tarekr:  I think they are going to sing the Marseillaise in the french bridge lands.|pg||
nt|xenya: good heavens|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: So Duboin had choice of defending 3@C or playing 4@S.  Something seems wrong here.|pg||
nt|psyck: E forgot that W did not x 2@c|pg||
nt|xenya: can be made on this lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  4@H or 5@C here, but 3nt depends on the lead|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@d is prolly game forcing|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This one will end the 1st quarter of a close and exciting match.  Hope to see all back!|pg||
nt|warrens:  either a @D lead or a high @S and a @D shift to beat this|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@D definitely GF |pg||
nt|ritong: not sure why nickell opted for that with a 2@c inviting available|pg||
pc|d9|nt|casenjo:  Thanks to Warren, Henri, and Krishna!|pg||
nt|warrens:  that lead should make for a quick -1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ought to play the @DQ here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rv: yes, French pair played at a very high level|pg||
nt|kit: Can this make?  5 spades, 1 heart, 1 club, 3 diamonds?  Doesn't seem likely without knowing about the diamond layout.|pg||
nt|chick: falsecard by Sementa may cause a bit of problem|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this time i understood nothing about the pass by East|pg||
nt|kit: What could East have sensibly bid?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 10 points and 4@s dbl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: without dbl i, in west, i would reopen 3@D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: assuming the same contract at the other table, we end the first quarter today essentially tied|pg||
nt|chick: many would play a double of 2@C as showing spades|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ritong: you re late, walter:) see yopu next segment?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psyck: Thanks all. Next set imn about 20 mins|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: Two very strong teams, fun to watch|pg||
nt|chick: apparently he wasn't able to do that|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right, can't use dbl to give 4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl at 2@C means strong hand|pg||
nt|psyck: well, most play is as supp x, but for this pair is would show @s with better than min hand|pg||
nt|kit: I guess he can take the needed tricks -- ace of diamonds, diamond ruff, etc.  5 trumps, 3 diamonds, 1 club, 1 heart.|pg||
nt|psyck: so 4@s was punishing pd's balance, may get lucky though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no - i think sementa decide to play 3@C with balanced hand at the partner|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West could reopen only with unblanced hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is the reason of pass at 3 @C and after 4@s|pg||
nt|kit: yes, he could work out West's shape for sure|pg||
nt|xenya: so the whole thing was not as crazy as it looked, after all|pg||
nt|kit: But you would think South should have also worked it out and not led the ace of clubs.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the reasoning of sementa is: if i don't have game i play 3@C - if my p is unbalanced with 4@S he must reopen - so better pass that dbl at 3@C, becasue with dbl i can''t know if my ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: p have 11 balanced or 14 unbalaced|pg||
nt|xenya: cute|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: big thanks to excellent Vugraph operator Joe and my wonderful co-commentators Henri and Tarek|pg||
nt|xenya: wide choice of plays for B here|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|psyck: yes, he did a good job in the face of connection issues so that we did not miss the action|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rv: also thanks to ACBL, Canadian bridge federation and BBO for broadcasting this match and to specs for patiently listening to us with their insightful comments|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks all ;  we will stay open until the other room finishes|pg||
nt|rv: congrats Hampton, thanks all, bye|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Thanks to all specs. We certainly appreciated your input and always a special thx for Joe and Venky and Henri|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Une belle bataille bien gagnee par nos dames|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c2|mc|8|nt|warrens:  Katz might have bid 3@D over 3@C, that would have saved the day|pg||
