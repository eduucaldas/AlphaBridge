pc|dK|pc|sT|nt|kareno: No squeeze - position is wrong.  Heart length in west so south may finesse for down two.|pg||

nt|bessi2: how could versace pass 3@s on that aucion.. impossible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they had the wrong hands also, so prob a catchup auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kareno: Most likely|pg||
nt|jcwla: That E hand looks like one of mine.  Now maybe a spl bid by N?|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see how zia hamman show the @s shortness|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: This hand looks like a good one for a cup of tea ... (_)? ... and some cookies OOO|pg||
nt|ritong: since i believe hamman will not bash 3NT with that hand|pg||
nt|ritong: that was unexpected|pg||
nt|kareno: Can north redouble for business?|pg||
nt|kareno: That's a very weak hand to double 1nt - must be for takeout.|pg||
nt|bessi2: they play penalty dbl's there I believe.. saw them do it earlier in the tournament if I remember correctly|pg||
mb|2S!|an|clubs|mb|p|nt|kareno: East relieved|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bessi2: even with the information of all the hcp's in the west hand, zia can't make 3N I believe|pg||
mb|3S|an|short spades|mb|p|nt|ritong: presumably 2 NT is "i like @cs"|pg||
nt|kareno: That really is a weak hand for a penalty double.|pg||
nt|ritong: so they use direct splintering|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bessi2: unlucky really.. if zia held the 10 of @s then he would make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Takeout of NT - please bid your longest suit because I'm almost surely shortest in it.|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: where you can t have 4+ cards since stayman was not used|pg||

nt|jcwla:  And as N - what does pass mean/force?  What does XX mean/force etc.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d4|pc|s2|nt|bessi2: Semente better not throw another spade now.. needs to hold 3 if im not mistaken|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|sT|pc|d7|nt|bessi2: and now he will make it|pg||

nt|peachy: Rodwell might/might not be having discard trouble soon\|pg||
nt|gambit: Declarer fantazing about Kx@D onside allowing contract to make, but not today|pg||
nt|bigtrain: won't have much of a problem|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Was Meckstroth's 9@H a spade indicator?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  If so, Eric can safely pitch a spade|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: thanks a lot to Karen, Jordan, Sigurbjorn, and Henri -- and thanks to specs for being here|pg||
nt|bessi2: my guess is that is shows a good 3@s bid, but given his earlier rdbl he hardly has the values for that|pg||
nt|ritong: to the numerous specs who are lecturing me, i m not sneering at zia  i just would like tounderstand what is behind his actions on that board|pg||
nt|kareno: Not only for being here but for their wit and wisdom which keeps us awake and alert!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Zia said the RD was 8+ with clubs; Hamman said 8+ with 2 spades.  Both right|pg||
nt|ritong: in order to do same when i m grown up:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Henri, do you really plan to grow up?|pg||
nt|ritong: i do|pg||
nt|ritong: i m ambitious, you know|pg||
nt|bessi2: I play it the way Hamman explained it... never heard of zia's approach|pg||
nt|kareno: I play it shows a high honor in spades.|pg||
nt|ritong: i would understand more easily if opening was 1@d|pg||
nt|ritong: a kind of snapdragon redouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes.  I'm sure they will discuss it :)|pg||
nt|kareno: mmm|pg||
nt|ritong: an extremely reliable source tells me big bob's explanation is the right one|pg||
nt|bessi2: meckwell reached the 7@h|pg||
nt|kareno: So the match has tightened some.|pg||
nt|bessi2: and I'm sure they will reach 6@c as well.. |pg||
nt|kareno: Absolutely they will|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: as I look at Zia's not again, it is possible he said just 8+ and the "clubs" below the 8+ is from another explanation -- not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Zia has left and Kehela is turning dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Zia's note, I meant|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, those little pages get pretty full of questions and answers.|pg||
nt|bessi2: this is not exactly laydown.. seems possible for Hamman to finesse @s now|pg||
nt|bessi2: playing east for a singleton 3 4 or 5 instead of J or Q|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Hamman:  "sorry" [for taken a long time]|pg||
nt|bessi2: this is a complicated hand....he probably has a strong feeling the @s are 4-1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: and he has to get the diamonds right as well|pg||
nt|kareno: If he takes six spades, then two diamonds and a club are enough.|pg||
nt|bessi2: perhaps nearly certain.. after east's K of @c it looks like he is 4432 shape|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Meckwell did find 7@H on the 8-4 hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: perhaps he will play a @d to the 10 now.. if it holds lay down the Ace of @s intending to cross to dummy for another spade play if east plays low|pg||
nt|kareno: A sensible line of play|pg||
nt|bessi2: hmm.. I just noticed a flaw in my analysis |pg||
nt|kareno: Hearts are pretty well marked as honors divided with east not leading one.|pg||
