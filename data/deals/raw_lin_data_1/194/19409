nt|rodal f: By @S4+|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Two-way choice to pick up 4 trumps to jack ... so has to guess right. A second top heart, of course, likely to be fatal|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mamos: 4@H is everyone's contract surely|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|suzanna2: Hoffman/Brightling are playing Standard|pg||
nt|suzanna2: Thompson/Jacobs are playing 'Looney Tunes'|pg||

nt|mamos: the funny thing here is Babs that North has sort of got both types|pg||
mb|d|nt|runnerup: wd|pg||
nt|benj_k:  Very agressive push by Hoffman. If partner had some interest I assume they would have been able to show it over 3@c.|pg||

nt|babs59: for those who want to know, the carryforward is 10% of the difference between the team's qualifying VPs|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s looks pretty safe for N-S|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Just pass half way mark for the session|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: a part-score hand I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ianmcc: but maybe 4@s|pg||
nt|babs59: and during the qualifying rounds, in reality each IMP is worth 2 IMPs because if you win by 25 IMPs, the score is +25 for the winners, and -25 for the losing team|pg||
nt|mamos: EW in Or got in a muddle after 1@s x and a conventional 3@h was accidentally passed out|pg||

pc|cA|nt|vugrapha3: One of the bidding boxes just spilled, the director has been called to fix the situation|pg||
nt|mamos: the Diamond position is unkind |pg||
nt|ianmcc: this could be close|pg||
nt|babs59: in the Open Room, West must have meant his 3H to be 10-12 points with 3-card support for spades|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: so the defence start off ahead here |pg||
nt|babs59: however, the double confused the issue |pg||

nt|loganrun: 2C = relay as well 1NT is max 1D I think|pg||
nt|henryb:  and probably some distributional info as well|pg||
