nt|andyv:  4@c or 4@d rkc, depending on their style, also merits attention|pg||
nt|rv: in a minor fit, it is better to play 4m+1 as RKC for minor so that you can stop safely at 5 level if 2 keys are missing|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rv: as Andy mentioned some play minorwood (4m as autorkc) or kickback (4m+1 as rkc)|pg||
