mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: perhaps a chance?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|othered1: Slam is @S here is rather good, and 7 isn't terrible (but maybe not good enough, especially if the opponents stay in game)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: does E make another try? |pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like yes|pg||
mb|5C|nt|twcho: so likely they will end up in grand|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|sybarra: not sure 7 is easy to imagine |pg||
mb|d|nt|ssbux: after the 3S from W, E have every reasons to push to slam|pg||
nt|twcho: east can count the tricks|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|twcho: 6@s + at least 5@c and 2 aces|pg||
nt|twcho: and he knows they need points|pg||
nt|twcho: imps|pg||
nt|ssbux: as EW is playing absolute 2/1, the 3S promise a good 6+ card suit|pg||
nt|twcho: The jump to 3@s should be stating semi-solid or solid suit depending on their partnership agreement|pg||
nt|ssbux: now the 6S after the 5D promise 3 + trump Q|pg||
nt|othered1: East knows west has good long @S, AKQ, and @CA.  Unless the ace is singleton, grand figures to be pretty good.   But grands when the opponents stop in game give 11-3 odds . . . |pg||
nt|twcho: but one can't really tell what happens at the other table|pg||
nt|ssbux: 6S (if breaking) + 5C + 2 red A = 13 tricks|pg||
nt|twcho: 1500 is 17 imps and 750 is 13 imps|pg||
nt|twcho: so a difference of 4 imps if east bids the grand|pg||
nt|othered1: True, but if it looks touch and go, and involves counting tricks and controls, not just points, sometimes opponents come up short.|pg||
nt|sybarra: queston is are the spades breaking? |pg||
nt|sybarra: same for clubs |pg||
nt|twcho: if @s is not breaking, probably even 6@s will go down|pg||
nt|twcho: opponent certainly lead a red suit|pg||
nt|othered1: @S10 is unbid.  @C don't need to be 3-2, since you'll have a red ace to get back to dummy after ruffing out the suit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: ok, 13 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: Reasonable, conservative decision by east|pg||
nt|ssbux: just to inform you, E has a nickname of chicken Book|pg||
