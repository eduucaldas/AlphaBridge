mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this could be all over the place|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Sigurbj√∂rn|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi Sig|pg||
mb|2S|an|12(13) 5!S|nt|roswolf: hi sigurbjorn|pg||
nt|bessi2: looks like a fair 3@s bid to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: east passed -hmmm|pg||
nt|chorush: East will be heard from before this is over is my bet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both of them, or all three rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: how rosy will north judge his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=10-13 HCP, 5+@S unbal  NOT 4+@H   of course 3rd seat, you never know|pg||
nt|roswolf: the americans are known to be solid but this solid!?|pg||
nt|chorush: NS can make 6 spades on this hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed al|pg||
nt|roswolf: wonder if 4@D is a void splinter?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Impossible to predict where this will end|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me try. 6@DX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now you|pg||
nt|chorush: EW can take 11 tricks in either minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW system is derived from KS [Kaplan-Sheinwold]   that tends to mean that minor suit openers are sound  [and if NT rebid -- strong NT]|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chorush: 7CX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now comes 4NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: IF EAST PASSES SOUTH MIGHT TOO|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk2: I got one right, what did I win?|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: her5e we go -south can upgrade his hand|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: both matches playing the same boards    other tables visible without login via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
mb|5D|an|Probably unbal?|nt|bessi2: north might bid 5@d now|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south will bid to the 6 level at least|pg||
nt|bessi2: and then Nunes might very well bid over 6m if they should bid it|pg||
nt|chorush: srry internet prob|pg||
nt|roswolf: cuebid by fulvio 0great judgment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other match pushed this board   at NS +750|pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: rdbl?|pg||
nt|bessi2: that dbl seems very misguided to me after that 5@d bid|pg||
nt|chorush: no one won the pool. Do I get a prize for being the furthest off?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   all 4 tables  5@SX|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks flat here too|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: an exciting push|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|s6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: specs reminding me   Stripe-Tailed Ape Double  --  double 5-level so they don't bid making SLAM|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|s4|nt|chorush: with spades 1-1, Nunes can arrange to ruff out all the minors and pass a heart to west, endplaying him|pg||
nt|bessi2: 1-0 you mean|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|chorush: yes 1-0|pg||
mc|12|nt|roswolf: this will be a test for the e/w's who will believe they have lost a lot of omps|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Same line-up as the previous set.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: nice easy game to get warmed up|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: The table just getting settled after discussing systems with the opponents.|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher99: welcome back folks|pg||
nt|kit: nice dull hand to start with :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|barnets: in Nickell match n/s made 5@SX +1|pg||
nt|barnets: that was katz|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: a straightforward 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: This was not the bid Weinstein was expecting to hear from partner|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|kit: Not clear what his best tactical action is.  He can be pretty sure he won't be buying it for 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: Weinstein is agreat poker player|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: A GENTLE INTRODUCTION INTO THE MATCH|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfe: Hi all.  same lineup in this room as the second quarter.|pg||
nt|kit: Making sure he gets diamond lead vs. 6@C|pg||
mb|5S|nt|peachy: Hello everybody, final set of the Wagar Womens KO Teams from Toronto|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Raija  and Glenn |pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Glenn|pg||
nt|puncher99: HI all|pg||
nt|barnets: that would be a good result e/w|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: and we expect the margin of victory to be under 10 imps|pg||
nt|peachy: For those interested, history of this event http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagar_Women%27s_Knockout_Teams|pg||
nt|puncher99: 9th trick is going to be hard to get here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it will fall from the sky in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a few imps to make up for Hampton but no panic|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: Hi Shirley.|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|sybarra: Ross :) |pg||
pc|c2|nt|barnets: so same result as the Nickell match - in this match east who passed backed in with 4N ovr 4@S as expected|pg||
nt|kit: He will take a trump, ruff out the minors, and pass a heart to West, making 6 on end-play|pg||
mc|12|nt|gambit: Welcome all to the quarter-final of the Spingold, nail-biting final session |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welland is deep into the tank.  He is a 'fast' player, so him taking this time is not|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: usual.|pg||
nt|gambit: 6@D is a good spot, and with KD onside, a great one |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Here we go....|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: hmm a great bd to start with|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could also be fun|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: one advantage of the delay   -   cayne vs nickell is 5 boards ahead, so we can see what they did with these boards|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not quite the way i envisioned it|pg||

nt|barnets: and 5@Sx in open too here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|peachy: or out, depends on one's view :)|pg||
nt|puncher99: friendly lie of cards for NS if they can  get to the heart suit|pg||
nt|peachy: EW play strong club and weak NT |pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome back to this Quarterfinal match from Spingold|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: 10-13 nt nv|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wiill north/south get ito the action?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: French law used to forbid sans a tout weak|pg||
nt|barnets: so all roads seem to lead to 5@SX|pg||
nt|gambit: and a push |pg||
mb|d|nt|gambit: nice when -750 is a push |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Nice @s "low".|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble is supposed to show a five card minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here it may help NS find hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Extended notes between South and West....|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Greetings to all.|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w miss a game but you can see why on the hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H + @C/@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: will north regret that bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H -hearts and minor is the toy of this decade|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we may play it here|pg||
nt|gambit: still make 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's been around since 1980s   an entire millenium ago|pg||
nt|roswolf: sizeable gain for team USA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cards friendly for 2 hearts|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|odysseus69: its popularity is more recent-|pg||
nt|odysseus69: best lead|pg||
nt|gambit: Kit why did the Levin upgrade  - the quality of his diamonds and overall "texture?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher99: tough to find hearts now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was it really west who bid 2@H??|pg||
nt|gambit: 6|pg||
nt|barnets: par for board 17 was 7@C X - 3 500 n/s|pg||
nt|kit: upgrade?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: Is this real|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yes it was.|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you operator/Ross|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: NS have more points than EW, about time they stuck their nose in|pg||
nt|ybob: 2down in 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh maybe for rest-of-world   in USA  it was a battle of who got the credit  Cappelletti or Hamilton|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Brave balance on that suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: nice Q@D and 1/2 a club stopper that just truned into a full one|pg||
nt|kit: seems to me he is just bidding his hand normally|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: there will be a director at this table soon|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr for interrupting once. Sport by high level.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@c?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: That's the bid.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfe: I don't know what the 2@h means, but there was a lengthy conversation between|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Westheimer and von Arnim at the time.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|santyclz: Seems more likely n would bid that...|pg||
nt|chick: a hand to pass out :)|pg||
nt|peachy: West had enough, understandably.  She knows NS on shaky ground, doesnt need much math to figure that|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: This should be a fairly quick table.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: mnight need the spade shift whoon |pg||
nt|gambit: push, next one |pg||
pc|h4|nt|tarekr:  Back down 25. They say we have a hard time finding minor suit slams in America. Obviously not so!|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: At least, so far it has been.|pg||
nt|peachy: Bramley Welland def is UDCA, o/e first discard only|pg||
nt|ybob: after KQ@S + A@D on N, S has A@C and KQ @H|pg||
nt|ybob: clear to declarer ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia is taking his time on this.|pg||
nt|gambit: Why not open 1NT? Too strong, perhaps but the weak dbltn offsets that |pg||
mc|12|nt|fabsayc: now spade nine|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not at all obvious of course, but you need a miracle|pg||

nt|bessi2: a boring 3N it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: they might investigate 6@D NOW|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: Multon-Zimmermann in 5@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW bid 2@S with both majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: solidity personnified|pg||
nt|ahollan1: overtrick imps in the other match   same might happen here|pg||
nt|chorush: On a club lead, declarer has 8 top tricks. If he cannot divine whether clubs are breaking, he has to decide how to get his ninth trick. We can see that he can't do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes declarer will be worried |pg||
nt|chorush: By then, he would also know hearts started 5-1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Plenty of questions and explanations offered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no thank you partner -- why don't YOU lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I cannot read or hear them|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart lead is possible|pg||
nt|chorush: But IMO if it comes to that he will take the diamond finesse, because if clubs are 4-4, that leaves him a chance to take the spade finessse later|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet   explaining Stansby shows 4@H |pg||
nt|roswolf: good point ira|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Martel  4/5@S not 4@H|pg||
nt|bessi2: Multon is declaring 5@d at the other table.. not a boring 3N after all :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chorush: so much for the intricacies of play on a club lead|pg||
nt|bessi2: not the best lead as the cards are.. but I would have lead a @h too|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: If the hands are going to be like this it is going to be as looooong evening.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: A bit remarkable in that Hamman never says much at the table.|pg||
nt|ybob: calm 3NT here|pg||
nt|gambit: Tarek, congrats on your second place finish with Zia |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about Monaco -- the 3 pairs have moved from other countries and there is some politics involved|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: What?  Politics in bridge?|pg||
nt|kit: closer to 2NT opening than 1NT opening IMO|pg||
nt|barnets: just wht iwas typing|pg||
nt|gambit: WD|pg||
nt|barnets: with one more diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: would open 2N|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: they tried 4 @S in other room on bd 33 for the save|pg||
nt|roswolf: a natural 2nt missed the @H fit in the other room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Multon certainly conservative there - maybe mini NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 10-13|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Vugraphzfe: A practical rubber bridge bid.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul 2N=20-21|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: not a friendly layout |pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: can this be a canape?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is coming from the Convention Card they used in 2008 at Beijing|pg||
nt|roswolf: this wont be fun to play|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Vugraphzfe: Both sides of the screen writing explanation of this sequence.|pg||
nt|gambit: sorry|pg||
nt|gambit: spade through |pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|peachy: Welland-Branley system nnotes say thi:    We are pretty aggressive and imaginative, so we might show up without the shape or strength that we have promised at any time.      Expect ...|pg||
nt|peachy: excitement during the match, at some point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college we professed that after 2N-P-P   DBL was automatic|pg||
nt|kit: This is dangerous -- they may wind up in 4@H instead of 3NT now|pg||
nt|kit: If East thinks his partner has stiff club, he won't bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it made for some interesting  double-cross situations|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i did a few times and if my defence had been good enough......|pg||
nt|odysseus69: same in our sanitorium|pg||
mb|3S|nt|santyclz: Must have been shortness rather than a minimum.|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  should easily come to ten tricks.|pg||
nt|barnets: we saw east make 4@H on  a5-1 break last set|pg||
nt|kit: 3@S looks like a scary call to me with partner having bid spades.  Might it not be interpreted as suggesting playing a 4-3 spade fit?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|gambit: squeezing declarer|pg||
nt|kit: Which is exactly what happened|pg||
nt|gambit: woops|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D ok|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, if they wind up in 6@D it just might make|pg||
nt|gambit: 5@C E? he has to extricate himself from this mess somehow |pg||
mb|5D|nt|santyclz: Let me take that back, n could easily go opposite a minimum with such good controls out of the suit.|pg||
nt|chick: yes, but still they are probably too high|pg||
nt|rodal f: A lot of cards are placeded now after S bid.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)   that's the place Victor!!|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will bid 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: would welland open 2@h on KTxxx?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: But West may think this is a slam move in conjunction with the 3@S call|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: actually you canmake  6@D by dropping the @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Weistein giving this a good think.|pg||
nt|kit: that is to make 7@D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|santyclz: It didn't show a "subminimum".|pg||
nt|peachy: First seat favorable, I wouldn't put it past him, don't know though|pg||
nt|peachy: I have seen interesting actions in the past|pg||
nt|stewball: well the K convinced zia that he might apparently|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Didn't notice where Zia won that one.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: When the cards start flying at this table, they do so very fast.|pg||
nt|stewball: he;s likely to lose a couple on this defence|pg||
nt|ybob: declarer can play small, J@S and @S to K if @S are 4/2 play next @H and squeezed N later|pg||
nt|barnets: 7@D even|pg||
nt|kit: 5 diamond tricks, 3 spade tricks, 4 heart tricks, 1 club trick.  Easy game.|pg||
nt|kit: And no reason for him to play differently here.  Win lead, pass 8 of diamonds, etc.|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N in other room|pg||
nt|barnets: close but maybe 5@D is better -not so clear|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks likely to be a push|pg||
pc|dT|nt|santyclz: I'm told they play Ogust, in which case 3@c was "bad hand" "bad suit", surely an accurate description.|pg||
nt|chick: but she still went on to game?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Barnet Shenkin|pg||
nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi barnet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs use relatively standard signals|pg||
nt|odysseus69: should pitch 2 hearts -not that it should help|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: An old CC for Arnim- von Auken says "Canape style with longer minors but neverl onger majors" so Martin got it right|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT looks a lot better to me on balance|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: Well, maybe not -- |pg||
nt|barnets: not if north has 5 clubs and @D K though|pg||
nt|barnets: think its close|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ybob: same after J@S and K@S |pg||
nt|luffe12:  trying some kind of safetyplay|pg||
nt|kit: Looks to me like he is trying to find a way to go down|pg||
nt|luffe12:  :) exactly|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi Barnet|pg||
nt|barnets: Hi victor|pg||
nt|odysseus69: heart must be right|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: wd|pg||
nt|barnets: so it was easier to play in 7|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: If Weinstein wins and shifts to a heart, he might achieve that goal|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c2|nt|ybob: now with @S 4/2 play  9@H ...|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|santyclz: It's makable double dummy, run the q then ruff a @d.|pg||
nt|stewball: why|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry about that.  red cards looked similar|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: he spits now|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: well done|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|barnets: and has 2 more tr|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 more|pg||
nt|barnets: tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: h|pg||
nt|kit: yep, he has gone down -- he can't keep control now|pg||
nt|barnets: has control|pg||
nt|luffe12:  so this was dangerplay - not safetyplay|pg||
nt|kit: I have no idea why he played it this way -- seems like this line gains only when North has stiff jack of diamonds.|pg||

nt|santyclz: A spec points out that if s passes and n opens 1nt s might like her 6-4 enough to push to game.|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|barnets: nice to know what XX was|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe kit knows|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|Vugraphzfe: Some discussion between Quinn and Willard.  I think it is about the 2@s call|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 2@D transfer or multi?|pg||
nt|puncher99: prob 1 suited major|pg||

nt|puncher99: wht does 3c mean?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Well, it certainly isn't dull.|pg||
nt|peachy: 3C tends to me, to confirm what I said about 2D. E has spade support in case partner had 2-suiter with spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 3@c alerted on both side.  No explanation asked for or given.|pg||
nt|peachy: EW play Flannery so 1S should promise 5|pg||

pc|d5|nt|kit: play might not be so dull|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Other tables are a bit noisy.  Seems there are some lively system discussions:|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: not in English...|pg||
nt|gambit: Declarer didn't get here with just his charming personality, very tough, but he will go with the odds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia annoyed at the distraction|pg||
nt|gambit: the room (I was just here) is samll, it was silent when I was there, so i assume he should be annoyed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welland has his head in his hands, rocking back and forth in the chair.|pg||
nt|gambit: I love those details....thx |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: Valerie does a double take at the bidding when the tray is passed to her side of|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: the table.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this could get very ugly to play, 4@H is better|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H should be off 1 on the spade lead so in that light, 4S is not much worse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is making double dummy as several spectators have noted|pg||
nt|ybob: 3nt is the best spot from E than W|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Minutes of boredom interspersed with seconds of furious action.|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice quote ross:)|pg||
nt|barnets: Declarer just has to lead a spade towards the J for his ninth trick|pg||

nt|odysseus69: that doesnt hurt|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfe: By her gestures, it seems North is a bit surprised by the auction.|pg||

nt|roswolf: some meat here perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Discussions in French and English.|pg||
nt|roswolf: play not talk is required|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the force is with the defence|pg||
mb|2H|an|Alerted|mb|p|nt|kit: I guess this shows both majors, less than opening bid|pg||
nt|luffe12:  they may reach 4@s from the right side|pg||
nt|barnets: 1 imp to fleisher on last board|pg||
nt|kit: But they still have to make it -- not clear it will make|pg||
nt|kit: We can see the QJ doubleton, but East can't -- he may play for stiff honor.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: it is only minors if explanations same on both sides of the screen, which i doubt they were|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: It has been a very strange set so far.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Yes, this seasoned team is very patient|pg||
nt|casenjo:  We will not see them swinging from the trees, they will grind it out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  includes all balanced hands   3=3=5=2 gets to choose 1@C or 1@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL=4+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: spared a mess, if EW did not ask.|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: snails have more purpose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4@H  [support dbl would show 3]|pg||
nt|luffe12:  true - question is, if you can produce 10 tricks without a lucky break|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: oh oh,  @H lead and this is down |pg||
nt|odysseus69: gib says 4H cold but he is allowed to lean over and pick the heart suit|pg||
nt|kit: right -- and answer is -- not clear|pg||
nt|luffe12:  :) also true|pg||
nt|gambit: very tough, prob no hope on 4-1 spade break so must play for 3-2 |pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in open after west opened wk nt|pg||
nt|kit: isn't his percentage play to just take immediate double spade finesse, winning when South has QJx?|pg||
nt|barnets: spade lead here|pg||
nt|gambit: that helps...|pg||

pc|d2|nt|barnets: I think he will go down here|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: Smoke break.|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they have to go way outside or something nearby?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  they played from the N at other table and no @h lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what the 1 @H bid was |pg||
nt|sybarra: 1@H was alerted as "3+@Hs"   |pg||

nt|tarekr:  it was alerted but I don't know either. Ross do u know how 1@h was explained|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|barnets: old age brings moderation in criticism|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gambit: yes, but is this the right time for the "normal" play, what about the result, heart through?|pg||
nt|luffe12:  100% for 2 - as it happens|pg||
mc|8|nt|vugraphzfe: Smoke Break.|pg||
nt|gambit: Crappy opener, too quick to use a gadget|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 3 sure losers in the hand and needs no spade losers|pg||
nt|kit: he needs to pick up spade suit without losee to have a chance most likely -- and that is best play to do it.|pg||
nt|barnets: the lead gave away the hand in the other room|pg||
nt|luffe12:  comment was just result-policy, i believe ur right|pg||
nt|barnets: and stansby dropped teh @SQJ|pg||
nt|kit: In other room South led a trump, and that tipped off the trump layout -- so contract will make for big swing for Fleisher.|pg||
nt|barnets: Nickell trail 39-3 this set and by 47imps total|pg||
nt|barnets: the hand we saw e/w make 5@CX here cayne mad 4@Sx in this way and 5@CX in other room|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@D probably asks which major|pg||
nt|chorush: almost everyone who uses this has discussed how to avoid the wrong major. Some use 4D here, some use 4H P/cc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when you agree to play the convention  it helps to know if 4@C is FORCING|pg||

nt|barnets: he has to ruff high now|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|barnets: and on a club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: I APPROVE|pg||
nt|kit: At any rate, looks like normal 4@S contract.  Even if they move for slam, RKC will show keycard and queen of trumps missing.|pg||
nt|gambit: and that will stop you now, maybe not in the 4th quarter down by 40 |pg||
nt|luffe12:  East will not rate his stiff club very much, i think|pg||

nt|ybob: 3NT by W|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Correct, if I interpret the hand gestures correctly.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|barnets: going|pg||
nt|gambit: perhaps the failure of W to bid 2@S the first time will allow E to stay low|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Sometimes the direct approach is best.|pg||
nt|barnets: hamman safety played the trumps|pg||
mb|4D|nt|santyclz: However they are  pinpointing the lead.|pg||

nt|roswolf: the dbl is understandable if wrong|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe they play double shows 1 defensive trick|pg||

mb|5H|nt|chick: @H lead at the other table allowed declarer to pitch a @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Too much science.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Kit  does anyone ever adjust responses to RKC when they've shown a [semi]Solid suit?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4S - 3 Key carrds|pg||
nt|kit: if I have shown a solid suit (i.e. AKQ), then I count jack as queen in the queen asks|pg||
nt|barnets: helness chose 2@D rebid|pg||
nt|barnets: which could be the difference|pg||
nt|roswolf: festart  should be 10 mins approx after they finish here|pg||

nt|odysseus69: this has to be my last- thx all|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe a system misunderstanding coming up!?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: Assuming North unblocks queen of hearts, and of course he will, this hand is headed down.|pg||

nt|barnets: sorry helgemo chose 2@D rebid get it right|pg||

nt|Walddk4: They can't, Al. They are playing the same boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @DQ|pg||
nt|kit: I guess they play that the 3@D call shows solid suit, as otherwise North would have asked for queen of trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: NS confirming they were in sync with this bidding sequence.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no boards showing yet -- just opened room|pg||

nt|stewball: voila|pg||
nt|luffe12:  he is facing severe comm problems|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: yes, you know you are in trouble when you can't get to either hand :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: He thought Zinmmermann had QJx|pg||
nt|kit: Of course Zimmerman might have made life easier by leading a high heart|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps east missiganalled|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: in memory of mariner1 :)|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein knows declarer knows he has ace of clubs, so he leads it rather than underleading -- maybe declarer will play him for AQ|pg||
nt|luffe12:  N cannot hold both club by count - I think|pg||
nt|barnets: has shown up with15 points so far|pg||
nt|kit: Jack of hearts not certain|pg||
nt|luffe12:  but S let the Q of @h ride|pg||
nt|luffe12:  would he have done so with KJ?|pg||
nt|kit: why not?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|stewball: i think he was committed more or less|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|kit: He knows where ace is|pg||
nt|luffe12:  ok|pg||
pc|s5|nt|barnets: e/w playing 2@H here in open|pg||
nt|kit: Levin can see he would be trump couped if he cashes king of hearts and exits, so instead he puts it to declarer right now.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: Weinstein played 10 of spades at trick 2 -- would he have falsecarded there?|pg||
mc|7|nt|kit: trick 1|pg||

mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: 2@H corrected to minus 2 on 31|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Nunes' double is responsive. Cards to compete but no clear direction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And usually denies four spades|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|roswolf: ouch|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: blood qill flow|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@CX likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: I'm shocked stansby didnt double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S next door was a poor bid with support for hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what about his DBL of 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: punch drunk!?|pg||
nt|chorush: after the 4 spade bid his hand is terrible for hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: forcing pass situations are always tricky|pg||
nt|chorush: He may not be sure he is beating 5 clubs but he should be sure he doesnt want to play 5 hearts|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: especially if both pards dont agree if pass is forcing in a particular auction|pg||

nt|barnets: this is the board Nickell won 12 for making 4@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: thx to Ross |pg||
nt|tarekr:  there surely has been a lot of fireworks on this set!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Tarek, for joining me |pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: reducing the mrgin to 38|pg||
mb|2S|an|Weak|nt|Vugraphzfe: You are welcome Shirley.|pg||

nt|peachy: Last hand on the set is upm the final set is scheduled to begin in about 25 minutes from now|pg||
nt|stewball: i'm not convinced that was % line but sure was successful|pg||
nt|gambit: 1@S, 2@H or other?|pg||
nt|kit: looks like other|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: how soon back? |pg||
nt|sybarra: 15 min or so?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Thank to all in the audience!|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Ur comments were very much appreciated.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: very soon.  Enough time to compare, and a small break.  15 minutes or so.|pg||
nt|stewball: i take that back,,i am convinced|pg||
nt|gambit: Zia speculated on the strategical advantages to knowing the "state of the match" No doubt if know, this would impact this last hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 4@H sort of fortunate -- finding a good fit and hand lying well|pg||
nt|gambit: sillywith a fit and a singleton|pg||
nt|barnets: terrible bid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: oops, I confuse easily, the 4 imps went to Hampton|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you to our operator Ross in Toronto, to all commentators, and especially the kibitzers. Hope you all enjoyed.|pg||
nt|kit: Let's say unsuccessful|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: But that East hand is the type of hand which gets those good fits and breaks, so there is a lot to be said for driving to game with it.|pg||
nt|gambit: let's say terrible |pg||
nt|luffe12:  they desperately need a break I would say|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|stewball: thanks to all|pg||
nt|ybob: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: It is a pleasure for me to do this. :)|pg||
nt|peachy: 2S might be invite with 5-4, I dont think it can be gf|pg||
nt|stewball: 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Some discussion between Zia and Welland....  They are also chatting about the|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: previous board.|pg||
nt|ybob: a clear 4@H by N|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibs say it could be Smolen.  Some play Smolen on the 3-;eve; GF, some have other agreements.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|chick: Many thanks to our excellent vugraph operator Ross :)|pg||
nt|ritong: punchy double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last board now, congratulations to hampton team who played well especially in final set, and thanks to our operator Ross for keeping us aware of all developments|pg||
nt|puncher99: ok hope u enjoyed the match folks and fellow commentators and operator|pg||
nt|kareno: Four comparisons pending though.  Keep the room open for those?  Or specs move to the OR.  Thanks for a great job Operating, Ross.|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Thank you to all the specs and their comments. Abravo for Ross who always gives us the "scoop" and my collegues Karen and Cam|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Thank-you Karen.|pg||
nt|barnets: another case of doing something foolish on the last board of the set|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|gambit: Yes, WD Ross, loved those notes (Roy rocking back and forth, Zia mumbling....great stuff, TY) |pg||
nt|kareno: And of course thanks to ACBL for letting us broadcast these great events and to Jan Martel for organizing the vugraph.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Otherwise it's just 'bridge'.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S probably denies 3@H|pg||
nt|kit: But this game can be defeated if defense is sharp|pg||
nt|roswolf: they will be tired after this marathon|pg||
nt|barnets: amazing how often you see the mistakes on the last board|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphzfe: Thanks all for your comments and compliments. It has been a fun session.|pg||
nt|tarekr:  May be they did not let Shawn bid|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks all, especially specs for their participation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Thanks all.  This has been a very interesting session. :)|pg||
nt|tarekr:  thank you Ross and all friends and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welland: "We have no agreement." (2@s call)|pg||
nt|kit: Not only does Fleisher have to lead a high spade, but Kamil would have to not play the jack|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|frankaus: b|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that is some bid! |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Director call.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Breed may feel there was some UI in the auction.|pg||
nt|tarekr:  5@s showed 2 w/Q and 4@c showed 5@c with 2/3 top honors|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the unauthorized was what?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  2/3 top honors or better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: They are discussing....|pg||
nt|tarekr:  This is part of Jacoby 2NT structure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Not too sure what the issue is...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: EW think the auction is over.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Breed claims it isn't and that she was just rearranging her pass cards on the tray.|pg||
nt|kit: I think you guys are being overly harsh.  While I wouldn't have bid 2@S, I can see how it might be a big winner.  He ran into about the worst layout possible for the call.|pg||
nt|luffe12:  The Dbl might have warned him|pg||
nt|barnets: did someone x ?|pg||
nt|barnets: just kidding|pg||
nt|gambit: Indeed, last night I was on Vug when board 63 was lose 12 to tie the match! And board 64 should have been routine, a little partscore, alas Rodwell stirred the pot and his opps ...|pg||
nt|gambit: went crazt and down five (to lose the match) in 3NT when they had him for +500/800 and winning the match ....terrific action |pg||
nt|luffe12:  Question is: would you bid 2@S uncontested?|pg||
nt|barnets: I call it last board syndrome|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfe: Too busy typing -- I missed who took that trick.|pg||
nt|sybarra: someone should smack this |pg||
nt|tarekr:  only 12 tricks in 7NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: 3@C was definitely either Invite or Game Force -- i can't tell by looking at either hand :(|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer probably thinks the hearts are 4-2, so from his point of view even if clubs come home he doesn't have 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They should be panalised for taking 2 hours and 50 minutes to play 16 boards, but it never happens. There is a clock, why I don't know|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will be a close match after this|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs thanking all the commentators also :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Yes, kudos to Jan for the work she does to make this all happen|pg||
nt|kit: So he might cross and lead a diamond|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|kareno: And what a platform we have on BBO!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: OK.  Last board and I lost the play. :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: At least it isn't a doubled slam. ;)|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Final Kudo to Roland for directing the traffic on all of this|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed!!|pg||
nt|gambit: TY Fred Gitleman, Uday, Roland, Jan and you Ross who help us share this wonderful event|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Tough to say what will happen here in this session.  Hamman and Zia have kept|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: the Nickell team still in it with the last results of this set.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Seven tricks played.  Zia has 2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia has 5.|pg||
nt|kit: and then defense can recover|pg||
nt|roswolf: claim time|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gambit: Thx all, over to another table |pg||
nt|kit: we see it is a claim, but he doesn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: penalize ACBL for letting it go this long???|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but no other line|pg||
nt|gambit: true |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|ritong: von arnim feeling better now|pg||
nt|ritong: and soon much better|pg||
nt|kit: no -- he might try to steal a diamond|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hamman had the @d 2 out to play several times  but puts the card back.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|frankaus: bye  4 now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Quick hand.  3rd quarter starts at 8:00|pg||
pc|d7|pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: always go for the genuine line and not the mis-defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: thx all for 5-10 mins|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Thanks all.  I'm keeping the table open until both rooms finish.|pg||
nt|barnets: in the open room east called a sensible 2@H after the double|pg||
