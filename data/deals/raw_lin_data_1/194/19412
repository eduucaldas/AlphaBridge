nt|mamos: the funny thing here is Babs that North has sort of got both types|pg||
pc|s6|nt|runnerup: wd|pg||
nt|benj_k:  Very agressive push by Hoffman. If partner had some interest I assume they would have been able to show it over 3@c.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  5@c looks like a safer contract, but 4@h just needs no early club ruff and a trump break|pg||

nt|babs59: for those who want to know, the carryforward is 10% of the difference between the team's qualifying VPs|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s looks pretty safe for N-S|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Just pass half way mark for the session|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|ianmcc: a part-score hand I think|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: but maybe 4@s|pg||
nt|babs59: and during the qualifying rounds, in reality each IMP is worth 2 IMPs because if you win by 25 IMPs, the score is +25 for the winners, and -25 for the losing team|pg||

nt|xenya: i don't agree with N's pass here |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: One of the bidding boxes just spilled, the director has been called to fix the situation|pg||
nt|mamos: the Diamond position is unkind |pg||
nt|ianmcc: this could be close|pg||
nt|babs59: in the Open Room, West must have meant his 3H to be 10-12 points with 3-card support for spades|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: so the defence start off ahead here |pg||
nt|babs59: however, the double confused the issue |pg||
nt|henryb:  who will get to bis @s first?|pg||
nt|loganrun: 2C = relay as well 1NT is max 1D I think|pg||
nt|henryb:  and probably some distributional info as well|pg||
nt|suzanna2: EW can't make 3NT or 5D here with the H situation|pg||
pc|s4|nt|suzanna2: the 1NT overcall normal 15-18|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: yes as a spectator comments EW will gain imps for bidding 4@S even if it fails by a couple|pg||
pc|d8|nt|runnerup: ok your partner was not on map -double partner  (norths thoughs)|pg||
nt|xenya: some specs suggest that N's pass had to be forcing -- but i fail to see why|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|runnerup: if you have support double you cant double for penalties in this hand -so either bid 3nt or trust your partners double to takout|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm going to guess that N's 3N bid now shows 3-1-6-3 shape|pg||
nt|loganrun: Souths bids after 1C are all relays - North is describing his points and shape|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb:  nope|pg||
