nt|vugrapha3: It's a multi and some other options, but I can't see the written explanation|pg||
nt|loganrun: 4H does make|pg||

nt|mamos: (I hate 1nT from South here  know I'm old fashioned  looks like 1@s to me :))|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S  is likely to go down but probably flat|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I would rather open 1@h with all that playing strength than show a weak 2|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: I do not have the EW card|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mamos: in the OR Gold in West opened 2NT  again some two suiter (major or minors?)  and that concluded the bidding|pg||

nt|henryb:  in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|suzanna2: I am told that Hills/Ali have played together for about 20 years|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|mamos: this looks more straightforward|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|4C|mb|4H|nt|mamos: 4@H is everyone's contract surely|pg||
nt|babs59: from memory, NS use 2C as either a Drury type of bid or for Limit Raise hands|pg||
nt|babs59: sorry, that was a silly comment|pg||
nt|suzanna2: a kib tells me 6C can make with a finesse with the singleon heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: now i think 3nt is out but may bid 6 @c|pg||
nt|loganrun: 4H makes of course and loks like the correct bid|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: I mean it's either clubs or Drury (limit raise type hands) in all positions|pg||
nt|mamos: the funny thing here is Babs that North has sort of got both types|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: wd|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb:  5@c looks like a safer contract, but 4@h just needs no early club ruff and a trump break|pg||

nt|babs59: for those who want to know, the carryforward is 10% of the difference between the team's qualifying VPs|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s looks pretty safe for N-S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ianmcc: a part-score hand I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ianmcc: but maybe 4@s|pg||
nt|babs59: and during the qualifying rounds, in reality each IMP is worth 2 IMPs because if you win by 25 IMPs, the score is +25 for the winners, and -25 for the losing team|pg||
nt|mamos: EW in Or got in a muddle after 1@s x and a conventional 3@h was accidentally passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: halfway through|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|runnerup: club guess in trick one but normal J makes the day in 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: 1H is a strong relay|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzgw: yikes|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't agree with N's pass here |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: One of the bidding boxes just spilled, the director has been called to fix the situation|pg||
nt|mamos: the Diamond position is unkind |pg||
nt|ianmcc: this could be close|pg||
nt|babs59: in the Open Room, West must have meant his 3H to be 10-12 points with 3-card support for spades|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos: so the defence start off ahead here |pg||
nt|babs59: however, the double confused the issue |pg||
nt|henryb:  who will get to bis @s first?|pg||
nt|loganrun: 2C = relay as well 1NT is max 1D I think|pg||
nt|henryb:  and probably some distributional info as well|pg||
nt|suzanna2: EW can't make 3NT or 5D here with the H situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mamos: yes as a spectator comments EW will gain imps for bidding 4@S even if it fails by a couple|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: ok your partner was not on map -double partner  (norths thoughs)|pg||
nt|xenya: some specs suggest that N's pass had to be forcing -- but i fail to see why|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb:  this is the start of an auction where E-W run out of pass cards in their bidding boxes :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|suzanna2: 1C opening is 15+|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|runnerup: if you have support double you cant double for penalties in this hand -so either bid 3nt or trust your partners double to takout|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm going to guess that N's 3N bid now shows 3-1-6-3 shape|pg||
nt|loganrun: Souths bids after 1C are all relays - North is describing his points and shape|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|babs59: I do recall one NPC of Australian Open team who refused to allow his team to look for 1-level penalties|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|babs59: And in the CR, Gold's objective to get a big penalty at this vul is somewhat extreme because slam is such a possibility|pg||
nt|mamos: Well Richard Hills is not looking for them|pg||
nt|loganrun: 2D = g.f. checkback|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|babs59: they are playing symmetric relay so there'll just be a lot of alerts|pg||
nt|babs59: Hills is asking,  Ali is telling|pg||
nt|mamos: Slam is as it happens doomed so the 1100 should turn out to be a very good score for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|babs59: anyhow, immediately after this NPC told the Women's team I was on about his non-belief in low level penalties, my partner and I got 1100 v. 1-level|pg||

mb|p|nt|babs59: 6NT by West can make on a Morton's fork - club through North - then a later spade endplay on south (if south has no diamonds left)|pg||

mb|p|nt|babs59: an odd sort of safety play, given he had a re-entry in clubs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: scorecheck? 12 trx|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sorry didn't see|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 11 tricks were claimed|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mamos: this may get passed out|pg||
nt|ianmcc: should|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h = @h & @c, minimum opening bid strength?|pg||
nt|henryb:  not quite I see|pg||
nt|suzanna2: 54 imps out in 4 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: ok should|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mamos: but I am always reticent to predict anything on BBO  been wrong before :)|pg||
nt|mamos: you see|pg||
nt|henryb:  seems to be a constructive weak 2 in @h, which is not exactly what Brightling has|pg||
nt|thommos: 8-11 with exactly 5H|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: It probably is a 5- I just can't see it from this angle|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  N-S should bid to 4@d, then defend 4@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|henryb:  hard to do with S hand|pg||
nt|loganrun: Hard for South to defend|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I'm relying on the explanation written on the SW side|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|babs59: 2C showed a single suiter |pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: an echo in here?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mamos: this is a single suiter  any Cappelletti|pg||
nt|babs59: and Thompson certainly has his maximum 1NT bid here (12-14)|pg||
nt|mamos: is that how you spell Capelletti ? |pg||
nt|babs59: 2 Ps, 2 Ls, 2 Ts|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|mamos: ty :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|runnerup: copyed from other table|pg||
nt|xenya: i would prefer to be in 2@C on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgw: final results: womens waik/b 89, ot/s 49; seniors auck 80.3, cd 40; youth auck 53, cant 23|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok-but seems impossible to find a way to bid it|pg||
nt|babs59: of course you guys call it Pottage|pg||
nt|babs59: that's for ease of spelling|pg||
nt|babs59: and that's what is on their system card too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no not usually called Pottage in England - not much played here as a defence indeed|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|xenya: right|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this will be lucky to make|pg||
nt|babs59: ah ok|pg||

mb|p|nt|reisig: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|babs59: while the first 2 sets (2 x 10 boards) of the Open Seniors and Women's finals are played tonight, the Youth play their last qualifying match|pg||
nt|babs59: and tomorrow THEIR final is only 40 boards|pg||
nt|suzanna2: so now a flat board on AC lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|babs59: I just had to go check scores because my daughter is in the SA Youth team|pg||
nt|reisig: Henry ..I was trying to think ..how long I know you|pg||
nt|loganrun: I don't even know what 'simultenaity' is|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|runnerup: precision or any natural system and bdding seems the same|pg||
nt|xenya: my 2nd choice would be 2@H -- but 2@S plays nicely here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|henryb:  1961 Ithaca sectional, which you came to with the Warners and Jerry Friedlander; although you may not have noticed a young kid at the time|pg||
