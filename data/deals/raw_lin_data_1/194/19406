nt|vugrapha4: Deal 1 now starting - players sorting cards....|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Not an opening of beauty|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Balanced 11 counts should not be opened in my opinion|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
mb|1D|an|hearts|nt|ianmcc: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|kemperg: hi all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: we start with a partscore no blood here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless you play a mini NT of course, say 10-12|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Mike :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and "right siding"  4 @H with transfer |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kemperg: what happened with the score of the first session?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: good valuation West|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Germ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just as well that N-S do not; that would have been costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Wayne Burrows|pg||
nt|cascade: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A Smolen sequence for E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: well Smolen for west but not east :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West showing four spades and five hearts|pg||
nt|bebechira: Hi Shirley and Mike..thx a lot for helping us|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Traian, pleasure here |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kemperg: Hello Uans|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hans|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|bebechira: we have Cathy operating and she is doing a wonderful job|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mundeel thought the other way round I suspect|pg||
nt|cascade: luckily everything behaves and 3NT will survive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mundell, sry|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello everybody|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kemperg: and Ian|pg||
nt|haans: most would bid only 2@H |pg||
pc|d8|nt|cascade: 4@H looks a slightly better contract to me|pg||
nt|bebechira: youth final will be 4 sets of 10 boards|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: bad 10 pointer|pg||
nt|bebechira: she is playing in NSW youth team...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|cascade: the advantage of Smolen is that the strong NT hand gets to play the 5=3 fit if it exists (and you bid it)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The upside of the Smolen convention is that you will always make the stronger hand declare the contract, provided that they both remember the convention|pg||
nt|bebechira: Victoria has a 29 imps carryover|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  hi Kath|pg||

nt|andyv:  1st board 1N by W and I thought the E hand was worth an invite|pg||
nt|kemperg: have to play with my grandchildren ( 4 and 6 ) at the same time :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have site with standings? |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I'll try my best to keep up with the players :)|pg||

nt|bebechira: the youth played a full 3 round robin ,and top2 teams qualified for the final|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome back|pg||
nt|bebechira: ACT have some work to do to catch up|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@d multi|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I have the N-S convention card in front of me|pg||

nt|bebechira: tomorrow we will have Youth final as well.... 4 sets of 10 brds|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh good hope I am there and also see Cathy in finals |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  will EW find their @d game or 3NT|pg||
nt|cascade: might be hard for north to only invite here|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s hands fit well |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Unfortunately NSW didn't do so well with youth..|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|bebechira: 30 boards to go in this final|pg||
mb|1N|an| |mb|p|nt|cascade: and then the defense need to establish their heart trick before declarer can build a club trick to beat 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which did not happen next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is a Bergen raise, limit|pg||
nt|cascade: five card support, two aces, two doubletons and vulnerable at IMPs i think i would be bidding game!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand a tad too good for that in my view|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  3@h may show min. with @ss|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@s a likely make, how good is it|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: hard to imagine south accepting her hand is as bad as it could be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree that Wood should sign off opposite a limit raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: next year Cathy!! |pg||
nt|bebechira: N will play 4h and itwill be quick i suppose|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cascade: some players make a limit bid then bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But Touyz changed her mind|pg||
nt|cascade: as Touyz has done here|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|haans: need diamonds 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Viv may get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Other suits are not attractive to lead from|pg||
nt|mamos: i guess this must be two-suiter weak South is presumably jst raising |pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike,  you happy with only 3?|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|ianmcc: but maybe @s Kx in pocket|pg||
nt|haans: but all honors working|pg||
nt|mamos: but you dont have @s10 so probably not one you care about missing|pg||
nt|cascade: i feel if you choose to consult partner then you should stick with that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would you lead, Wayne?|pg||
nt|cascade: its true but trumps are not that attractive either|pg||
nt|sybarra: magic hand,  as the @D are 3/3 |pg||
nt|sybarra: pesky that @H's are 3/1 |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I didn't think E had that option (to bid 4@s) but this should go down 2 (4@s and A@h), minimum|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bebechira: this is not the kind of board ACT needs...they need swingy boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: i like to attack but that is a guess here|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of tricks here|pg||
mb|6H|nt|cascade: a trump will usually give declarer a tempo|pg||
nt|cascade: would you lead a trump Roland?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome to Frank Budai|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think I know what went through Touyz's mind. "I am not good enough for a Jacoby 2NT, and I am too good for 4@S. So I'll make a limit raise then bid game later. That should convey ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the message". Just a guess|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  please correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 8@s did not win the first trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  first spade trick that is|pg||
nt|andyv:  we may not be able to get a record of how the hand was played|pg||
nt|sybarra: little does she know |pg||
nt|mamos: may be if WA are already quite away behind there is a case for bidding  more|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry lost them|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: esp. red |pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: if you do not pass 4@S you find many slams that will not make|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mamos: 5@S  is always a horrid thing to play -- no gain but lots of strain :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|haans: not p-clubs at its best|pg||
nt|bebechira: it is very unfortunate that the spingold is on...they are stealing all our spectators|pg||

nt|mamos: 4@H for EW would not have been a barrel of fun either|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: lucky slam 6 @h or 6 @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|loganrun: Now he bids his diamonds|pg||
nt|suzanna2: This is the 4th of 6 * 10 board stanzas of the final of the Australian National Open teams|pg||
nt|suzanna2: ACT and Victoria finished 1st and 2nd respectively  in a round robin of 8 Australian states|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I'm a conservative old fashioned bidder, but even I think the N hand is an opening bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d "Multi"?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: It's a multi and some other options, but I can't see the written explanation|pg||
nt|loganrun: 4H does make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: not often p transfers to your five card suit|pg||
nt|mamos: (I hate 1nT from South here  know I'm old fashioned  looks like 1@s to me :))|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S  is likely to go down but probably flat|pg||
nt|suzanna2: ACT started with a carryover of 12 imps but Vic are now well ahead at the halfway point|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|henryb:  I would rather open 1@h with all that playing strength than show a weak 2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 @s sems ok -just have to guess how ti play,but all goes here|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|ianmcc: big position from Jacobs will pay off|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzgw: Will try to find out, pls hold ;)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: so North has done well  -- the way I plat 3@S shows 4 Spades but a minimum in points I think it's hard for North to pas  but the right thing here as it happens|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|loganrun: Could not agree more Henry - a weak two doesn't start to show the playing strength|pg||
pc|s8|nt|runnerup: same thing in both tables ,when they found @s they stopped on no mans land|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|mamos: hi Ian|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|xenya: well done i think -- 6@S is not really with the odds, looking at the EW hands|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|henryb:  I'm not criticizing the methods, just the evaluation of the hand: that hand (in my book) does not fall in a 5-10 range|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: howcome 11?|pg||
nt|frankaus: we will get them for the final set i expect|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  I don't know what 2@h is here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strange when looking at four in the dummy|pg||
nt|cascade: and they didnt cash their diamond tricks |pg||
nt|bebechira: intersting hand... open room in 4s making|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  perhaps it's weak with majors|pg||
nt|haans: my vote for 3@H|pg||
nt|cascade: EW need to stay low with their distributional hands |pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: did he dperhaps draw trump and conceded Diamond?|pg||
nt|cascade: this is potentially 800 i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know that Viv would like to double, but I also know that her partner expects 4-4 in the majors for that, so she will probably abstain|pg||
nt|sybarra: W with a lot of points  but where to land? |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 3 nt?|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we have 2 very good matches on VG from ANC... i do not understand their option for the spingold|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W has an easy 3N bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, she did :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hands with voids are always difficult to evaluate when preempt openings|pg||
nt|bebechira: TD is Laurie Kelso...and he is trying to mantain a good "tempo" to all matches ...he is sometimes very strict with time at the club|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: that not best surely|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry  was distracted by my grandchildren|pg||
nt|bebechira: he offered 80 mins for 10 boards... lol|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bebechira: i think 90 would have been more generous|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to speed it a bit |pg||
nt|bebechira: we had last week Albena..and they were more generous there|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not be where W had thought she would play this bd if it goes all pass|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S ? then a kiss|pg||
nt|bebechira: big kiss|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  the @s holding is such that EW do have a @s stopper|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now he doesn't know which suit to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At this level I think you should have 4-4 if you are this weak|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow Max double din his room...more imps for ACT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  E should have little trouble getting 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wayne?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At the 2-level fine with me|pg||
nt|cascade: yes i would pass|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably we play with screens - 85 is the standard time for ten boards|pg||
nt|bebechira: we play with screens yes|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 80 is not very generous from Laurie|pg||
nt|bebechira: doubled in this room ..lol sorry for my spelling mistakes|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|cascade: partner needs a good hand to make anything|pg||
nt|cascade: and the odds favour her not having enough|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Mercifully undoubled but it matters little as 3NT was made next door|pg||
nt|bebechira: how many off...i can not count lol|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: this could be a disaster |pg||
nt|bebechira: i think this IS a disster :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: surprised no X but maybe didnt want to give hand away and afraid of another suit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: undo undo,  I bet there is a X |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry I missed the bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: but will claim at the end|pg||
nt|sybarra: Cathy,  no X?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I don't think so|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: The play will finish soon|pg||
nt|mamos: NS clearly on different pages of the manual|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: 5@c |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s dodgy here, 5@c best I think|pg||
nt|cascade: 2NT lowest two |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT showing hearts and clubs, at least 5-5|pg||
nt|cascade: hope NS have good agreements as to strength|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Take the money!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have 800 again this|pg||
nt|cascade: although wood is probably going to game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 1100 if declarer misguesses trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two top hearts, @SA, spade to king, spade ruff, @CK|pg||
nt|cascade: they have to get their spade ruff which might not be obvious with the stiff trump|pg||
nt|cascade: easy if you play obvious switch |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 12 the other room was in 4 @H |pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|bebechira: now we go in hundreads territory....|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @H was best spot |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: finding 5@C very good bidding|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cascade: i think south still has a double after the long think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed she has|pg||
nt|cascade: not clear what the long think was about |pg||
nt|mamos: dont like that 5@c bid far too precipitous|pg||
nt|bebechira: ok done now|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  this will not do well|pg||
nt|haans: most play that fourth suit is GF|pg||

nt|mamos: exactly Shirley|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 9 tricks for Milne here|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: it is Traian here..Kirsten having a quick break :)|pg||

nt|bebechira: lucky Max will give undrtricks in 50s|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  declarer will have to run 4@s tricks to avoid a total disaster|pg||
nt|cascade: @hA (or K) must be better |pg||
nt|bebechira: so can not be a huge disaster |pg||
nt|frankaus:  pd i only had KJTxxx so did not X :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: 4@S cannot take 2 clubs ruffs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Declarer might still lose three spade tricks, mind|pg||
nt|cascade: in general it must be better to get a look at dummy on this sort of auction before committing the defense|pg||
nt|cascade: yes and a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice smooth duck by Joan|pg||
nt|cascade: maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the odds favour the finesse regardless|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @c lead|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|ianmcc: of course, sorry a likely make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now 800 is a certainty|pg||
nt|cascade: she should get the spade right as south is marked now with at most two spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: I could raise to 3 @C (that is forcing after 2 @C for me) |pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|andyv:  if E signals for a @c, W should ignore it and lead a @h instead|pg||

pc|cK|nt|frankaus: - obviosly was worried about running to @C|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d2|pc|s9|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|athene: But 2@C is by a passed hand...easy for that to cause misunderstandings|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: and me|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|athene: of course most people can't bid 2@C naturally as a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: because of Drury|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Wood feared declarer had @HQ10 left and that she would get two spades away|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry they played a bit too quick for me :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hence the shift|pg||
nt|cascade: south had a safe club and the spade wasnt going anywhere|pg||

mb|1D|nt|runnerup: here the trap is 3nt -4@s and 5 C ok|pg||
nt|henryb:  in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|suzanna2: I am told that Hills/Ali have played together for about 20 years|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mamos: this looks more straightforward|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mamos: 4@H is everyone's contract surely|pg||
nt|babs59: from memory, NS use 2C as either a Drury type of bid or for Limit Raise hands|pg||
nt|babs59: sorry, that was a silly comment|pg||
nt|suzanna2: a kib tells me 6C can make with a finesse with the singleon heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: now i think 3nt is out but may bid 6 @c|pg||
nt|loganrun: 4H makes of course and loks like the correct bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|suzanna2: Hoffman/Brightling are playing Standard|pg||
nt|suzanna2: Thompson/Jacobs are playing 'Looney Tunes'|pg||
pc|c7|nt|babs59: I mean it's either clubs or Drury (limit raise type hands) in all positions|pg||
nt|mamos: the funny thing here is Babs that North has sort of got both types|pg||
pc|cA|nt|runnerup: wd|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb:  5@c looks like a safer contract, but 4@h just needs no early club ruff and a trump break|pg||

nt|haans: -1 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First time for you I hear|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yep|pg||
nt|athene: well maybe 2@C WAS drury here :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and decided if you play drury or not |pg||
nt|mamos: im afraid thats a pretty awful sequence and outcome - any bid that precludes 4@h  must be wrong|pg||
nt|sybarra: but given the raise to 5 @C, ...not sure that looked/sounded like drury |pg||
nt|athene: it definitely wasn't drury for north :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe for south though|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Cathy is a member of the NSW youth team|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: We're not doing so well though....|pg||
nt|cascade: perhaps but she should have had a count from north|pg||
nt|athene: north should have splintered with 3@S over 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: then you have room for 3nt, 4@H and other luscious things|pg||
nt|bebechira: please check the VG schedule..tomorrow we hae 4 sets coming to you...|pg||
nt|sybarra: dealing machine having a field day!|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|Walddk2: I agree, but it's so much easier for us|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2nt = 18-19 in my book|pg||
nt|haans: 12-14 in beginners books|pg||
nt|cascade: indeed it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think double is much better than 2@H|pg||
nt|bebechira: we are clashing a bit with Toronto...but forget about Toronto...Melbourne more important |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 3N can be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a decent slam |pg||
nt|sybarra: you time zones so different,  really does not come into play |pg||
nt|athene: Melbourne is much sunnier than Toronto (usually - maybe not this time of year) :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: yesterday we had 3 celsius in the morning....freezing|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought a 4@D splinter was most descriptive with the south hand|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@C Slam try  but North wont be excited|pg||
nt|athene: if north thinks 4@C is a splinter, she has a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: today was a better day 16 at lunch...so quite pleasant|pg||
nt|athene: she might offer 6@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  6@d probably makes, 6@h wont|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ianmcc: not after West bids, surely|pg||

pc|c2|nt|sybarra: we are in the very high heat range well over 30c |pg||

nt|babs59: for those who want to know, the carryforward is 10% of the difference between the team's qualifying VPs|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s looks pretty safe for N-S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ianmcc: a part-score hand I think|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: but maybe 4@s|pg||
nt|babs59: and during the qualifying rounds, in reality each IMP is worth 2 IMPs because if you win by 25 IMPs, the score is +25 for the winners, and -25 for the losing team|pg||
nt|mamos: EW in Or got in a muddle after 1@s x and a conventional 3@h was accidentally passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: halfway through|pg||
mb|2D|nt|runnerup: club guess in trick one but normal J makes the day in 3nt|pg||
nt|suzanna2: Brightling/Hoffman system card is at http://www.abf.com.au/events/anc/2011/systems/actopen.pdf|pg||
mb|d|nt|loganrun: 1H is a strong relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgw: yikes|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't agree with N's pass here |pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugrapha3: One of the bidding boxes just spilled, the director has been called to fix the situation|pg||
nt|mamos: the Diamond position is unkind |pg||
nt|ianmcc: this could be close|pg||
nt|babs59: in the Open Room, West must have meant his 3H to be 10-12 points with 3-card support for spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: so the defence start off ahead here |pg||
nt|babs59: however, the double confused the issue |pg||
nt|henryb:  who will get to bis @s first?|pg||
nt|loganrun: 2C = relay as well 1NT is max 1D I think|pg||
nt|henryb:  and probably some distributional info as well|pg||
nt|suzanna2: EW can't make 3NT or 5D here with the H situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|suzanna2: the 1NT overcall normal 15-18|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: yes as a spectator comments EW will gain imps for bidding 4@S even if it fails by a couple|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: ok your partner was not on map -double partner  (norths thoughs)|pg||
nt|xenya: some specs suggest that N's pass had to be forcing -- but i fail to see why|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  this is the start of an auction where E-W run out of pass cards in their bidding boxes :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|suzanna2: 1C opening is 15+|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|cJ|nt|runnerup: if you have support double you cant double for penalties in this hand -so either bid 3nt or trust your partners double to takout|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm going to guess that N's 3N bid now shows 3-1-6-3 shape|pg||
nt|loganrun: Souths bids after 1C are all relays - North is describing his points and shape|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|henryb:  nope|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  wrong as usual, or N misbid|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c7|nt|loganrun: North has shown londg diamonds and a singleton heart I think|pg||

nt|loganrun: Just imagine if it was a slam hnad|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: No, the passes were quite plentiful in these boxes - someone may have planned ahead|pg||

nt|cascade: not on this side of the planet :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: 2@D both majors|pg||
nt|mamos: gain to Wellington on the hand where 4@s went three off 4@h succeeded in OR|pg||
mb|2N|an| |mb|3N|nt|andyv:  3@s (showing shortness) would be a nice gadget to have for W|pg||

nt|bebechira: 16-10 for ACT this set...so 6 imps back|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6nt would be interesting|pg||
nt|cascade: the WBF rate is nearly 90 minutes|pg||
nt|athene: spade or @CA lead would be costly|pg||

nt|sybarra: now,  do you bid 4th suit (gf) or 3 @H or ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: not my favourite opening method but works well here|pg||
nt|haans: Can 2@D be Ekrens?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I strongly disagree with the 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|cascade: passing 1@s with that much is really trusting partner at this vul :)|pg||

nt|kemperg: not easy to get 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: yes Germ trying to work out best line - may take some time|pg||
nt|athene: what is west supposed to do with, say that same hand but no @CK or @DAKQ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with E |pg||
pc|s5|nt|cascade: but a good suit and favourable vulnerability|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: this may fail |pg||
nt|athene: i don't bid 3@H  because it's surely not forcing in australia|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: now the pull to 4 @H is slamish |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will not do well on @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They may get to 6@H and that is easy to defeat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as Viv Wood will lead her singleton|pg||

pc|sK|nt|athene: i think east has slightly overstated her hand - 4H over 2@D was ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would be afriad 3 @H also nf |pg||
pc|s6|nt|cascade: then the spade overcall may be punished|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, to protect her @CK|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|mamos: @d9   may be the key|pg||

nt|mamos: more excitement  - perhaps too much for NS in the OR|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now some nice colour|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: We are taking a short break|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Everyone back now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|babs59: can't say I'm a fan of 1S by south|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mamos: it uses up lots of bidding space!|pg||
nt|henryb:  and we probably won't get towards it on this hand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|runnerup: if 4 @h makes then 5 @c seems a good save ,but it can fail |pg||
nt|xenya: so the adventure cost 7 imps -- not a big deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|suzanna2: 3S looks already too high|pg||
mb|4S|nt|babs59: I do recall one NPC of Australian Open team who refused to allow his team to look for 1-level penalties|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: And in the CR, Gold's objective to get a big penalty at this vul is somewhat extreme because slam is such a possibility|pg||
nt|mamos: Well Richard Hills is not looking for them|pg||
nt|loganrun: 2D = g.f. checkback|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: good save against 3N|pg||
pc|c6|nt|babs59: they are playing symmetric relay so there'll just be a lot of alerts|pg||
nt|babs59: Hills is asking,  Ali is telling|pg||
nt|mamos: Slam is as it happens doomed so the 1100 should turn out to be a very good score for EW|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|babs59: anyhow, immediately after this NPC told the Women's team I was on about his non-belief in low level penalties, my partner and I got 1100 v. 1-level|pg||
nt|babs59: and again in the next match!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ianmcc: defending 1-contracts tricky|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|runnerup: this time it makes ofcause |pg||
nt|mamos: I can remember (and its twenty years ago!) the last time I defended 1@Sx at the end I was relieved that it went -1   but partner was not consoled because we had 6@c|pg||
pc|h7|nt|babs59: 6NT by West can make on a Morton's fork - club through North - then a later spade endplay on south (if south has no diamonds left)|pg||

nt|frankaus: anothe huge hand - |pg||
nt|bebechira: 6 imps for ACT here |pg||
nt|bebechira: they will come for overbidding brd 5|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  EW will be either in @s or NT partial |pg||
nt|athene: when they are scoring up it will go "board 6, 6nt, one down, sorry" - "flat"|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no-one needs to know about the spade lead + heart hook|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 6 sorry|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  for their sake, hope they miss the @s suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@s probably a xfer to NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How do you explain the second downtrick?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and need to say out of game here |pg||
nt|sybarra: *stay |pg||
nt|athene: tricky choice with east - double gets both suits across but loses the fifth heart which might be quite important|pg||
nt|bebechira: the director is looking for brd 25 now :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: @c lead holds it to 4@S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|athene: oh yes, she went two down|pg||
nt|athene: errrr|pg||
nt|frankaus: or @DA then @C |pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  or canape style...not sure it fits into any catagory except The Little Major system|pg||
nt|mamos: two good boards for Wellington|pg||
nt|kemperg: S happy he did notbid 2@D for majors this time:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: if east wants to bid over 3@D then i prefer 3@H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  EW already getting too high|pg||
nt|haans: hard to see S cards as prempts|pg||
nt|athene: tricky lead decision for south here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: people often lead unsupported aces just because partner bid the suit and it usually costs|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand nothing is really appealing|pg||
nt|athene: that basically has to say "i have a 4@C raise but with an extra heart"|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: (yes seen it :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: easy pass by milne|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mamos: seems slightly odd to bid 2@S   West is maximum (Precision) |pg||
nt|cascade: usually?|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have diamonds it's sort of good to emphasize hearts rather than clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely that 3 @H buys the pot |pg||
nt|athene: well, 3@H is as likely as 4@C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  with a passed partner, there was little reason for W to bid again unless it's a system requirement in which case they may wish to modify some parts of their system.|pg||
nt|athene: ok, "very often" costs|pg||
nt|cascade: certainly if you have something better to do|pg||
nt|cascade: here south's alteratives were also unattractive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, I would lead a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let declarer fiddle around with the side suits|pg||
nt|bebechira: this will end it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: i guess 4@C shuts out 3@S from south|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: 2@S usually show extra|pg||
nt|kemperg: and his distribution|pg||
nt|basu_4139: extra with shape too|pg||
nt|mamos: but how likely was game ?|pg||
nt|kemperg: E no interest on 43 fit with max 15pts in W|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bebechira: 15-20 mins to go this session... and hey still have to play 25 as well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cascade: how often are these trumps leads right Roland?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mamos: @H position very favourable for EW|pg||
nt|mamos: if EW had ventured 4@H would they have pushed NS to 5@d?   I think so|pg||
nt|athene: very hard for south not to sacrifice with that hand once partner bids 3@D|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H 1@D 1@c to lose|pg||
pc|s8|pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: I have no idea|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry i lost them|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We have seen several examples already|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 15 min left|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is there a prize for fast play?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they not playing with screens?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kemperg: 4139 is a real extra shape:)|pg||
nt|bebechira: tomorrow morning I will continue with the OPEN teams and we will VG first set of the youth VIC-ACT|pg||

nt|ianmcc: scorecheck? 12 trx|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mamos: ok should|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: but I am always reticent to predict anything on BBO  been wrong before :)|pg||
nt|mamos: you see|pg||
nt|henryb:  seems to be a constructive weak 2 in @h, which is not exactly what Brightling has|pg||
nt|thommos: 8-11 with exactly 5H|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: It probably is a 5- I just can't see it from this angle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=relay, invite or better|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  N-S should bid to 4@d, then defend 4@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what they do after interference :(|pg||
mb|3S|nt|henryb:  hard to do with S hand|pg||
nt|loganrun: Hard for South to defend|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I'm relying on the explanation written on the SW side|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: 2C showed a single suiter |pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: an echo in here?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: this is a single suiter  any Cappelletti|pg||
nt|babs59: and Thompson certainly has his maximum 1NT bid here (12-14)|pg||
nt|mamos: is that how you spell Capelletti ? |pg||

pc|s6|nt|andyv:  N unaware that 3N now is a laydown|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ianmcc: looks like 9|pg||
nt|athene: with the @H9 in dummy you aren't getting a second heart - also your ace can be dropped anyway|pg||
nt|athene: or take the ace and shift to something|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: so sorry, lost them again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would you play a diamond at trick 2?|pg||

nt|bebechira: 2 to go with 7 mins on the clock|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ianmcc: 3NT a chance|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt a bit more appealing than 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  quite an overbid but perhaps driven there by the vul.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: South needed to bid 3NT  |pg||
nt|ianmcc: might as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: might miss the @S 's here? |pg||
nt|sybarra: N, bidding them now |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: 5 minutes remaining|pg||
nt|frankaus: -1 = good bridge :) so both sides were -1 = excellent bridge :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: lool frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  with a 7 loser hand, W should just dbl|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: well never easy|pg||
nt|mamos: nope|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S opening next door. Declarer was lucky, no-one had a double|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|cascade: 4@s in the other room was very successful|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@c was a better prospect|pg||
nt|athene: perfect fit here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and all the @S spots |pg||
nt|sybarra: etc|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|mamos: WA   getting bits and pieces back  this might well be another chance|pg||
nt|bebechira: director:15 mins|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2 to play...should be ok|pg||
nt|athene: not sure what the @D6 is supposed to be|pg||
nt|sybarra: no problem,  this and and another hand  poc  (piece of cake) |pg||
nt|athene: surely west should either be playing a big diamond (8) or a little one (3)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How to make only one heart trick on defence|pg||
nt|cascade: even with a double she wins as the normal lead results in -600 here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos: 3NT had some chances and 5@c more than 5@d  I think that they would all fail but 5@d  never making I fear|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  this should go down 2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: go for kill direct|pg||
nt|haans: allways best :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  cashing one high @c was a mistake...now should only go down 1|pg||
nt|athene: unless they play some very complicated arrangement when there is a singleton in dummy|pg||

mb|p|nt|suzanna2: another 8 imps for VIC|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|henryb:  I guess W must have gotten a @c ruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: Commented OR. Been some sporty once here.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|babs59: wow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough call for Hoffman   @DK looks better  4333 looks bad |pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: that's all I can think of to say :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a lead changer|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: EW underlead|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: tough hand for NS|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d is exclusion? shows black suits?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was joking; but thanks|pg||
nt|loganrun: I was looking at it myself - win the club lead with the King might cause some issues|pg||
nt|reisig: You need to understand Henry :) :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HQ --- who knows|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yes West doesnt have a great hand it's true but East is likely to have values|pg||
nt|babs59: ok ok, I apologise for making so many kibitzers choke on their laughter!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|runnerup: any game seems a challance but 3nt may be possible -ok they stopped here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Holland's auction of Negative DBL followed by 2@S looks better   amazing that Hinge didn't bid again|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: not a convincing auction i think -- but better than the 5@D in the other room|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||

nt|andyv:  14 tricks off the top|pg||
nt|mamos: South   trying 2@D here?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: routine 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand of the day here |pg||
nt|bebechira: last board now ...|pg||
nt|bebechira: next|pg||
nt|frankaus: tho its a small - insurance premium  V a vul game|pg||
nt|bebechira: last board here..|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bebechira: ths a lot to Teddy and Frank for helping us|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 6-10 nine cards in majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Cathy,  great job!   |pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set. Many thanks to Cathy, excellent operating. |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: no worries, sorry i got lost on a few hands..|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Think they need to give us a high chair, can't really see the cards properly :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: also thanks to Wayne and Bill for commentary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play will resume after a short break|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Mike and Bill,  always fun to be with you guys |pg||
nt|athene: 3nt = "we are in time pressure"?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Thx Shirley,Mike and William...fantastic job|pg||
nt|bebechira: and many thanks to Kirsten...our operator...fantastic job|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|andyv:  2@c almost looks natureral and positive response to the strong @c|pg||
nt|vivienne: ty |pg||
nt|bebechira: we will be back in 10 mins with the 2nd set of the morning|pg||
nt|frankaus: very exciting hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: hate 3NT |pg||
nt|bebechira: i hope to see you all back tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: (I think that is later tonight for me) |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: East will be happy to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: best west declaring|pg||
nt|athene: the spades lie nicely for declarer and the @H10 will be valuable too, but still there is too much work to do, too many aces to knock out|pg||
nt|bebechira: and the youth players are making them twice as exciting lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S loves to bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: well ?|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would not volunteer 3@S, but I don't think I will ever be selected for the WA women's team|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  3@c probably a xfer|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|cascade: looks like a save against a likely 3NT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get some help you never know |pg||
nt|mamos: AS a frequent TD I'm sure players shouldnt get into time-trouble  but if you do you must take your punishment - and play properly  fines usually = one or two imps playing badly ...|pg||
nt|mamos: double figures|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  6@d only goes for 1100|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would pass as S now|pg||
nt|andyv:  operator, are we sure as to who is doing all the bidding?|pg||
nt|vivienne: bye|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: now if declarer leads the @SK, north should duck|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer gets only two spade tricks and only one entry to dummy |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: so she can lead a club up only once and that is not enough|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mamos: next hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: open room starting last board now...so all well when ends well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: of course north ducks this as well|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kemperg: 1 up|pg||
nt|ianmcc: claim|pg||
nt|mamos: the match is close with only thre boards or so to play in each room  -- but 5-6 comparisons|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  ok, we can assume the EW got to 6@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  operator, need to undo auction all the way back to 3@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW will be plus 1460|pg||
nt|ianmcc: what about set 1?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  operator, probably best to just put up score|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cascade: I am told 3NT made at one table and went off at the other table in the Open|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|bebechira: Laurie Kelso TD smiling.... so no problems with time|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: It takes some imagination to go down|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: a more controlled auction would have been 1@D X pass 1@H pass 1NT all pass|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h3|pc|dT|nt|mamos: ty all been fun|pg||

nt|henryb:  Last board|pg||
nt|henryb:  of this set|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: last board for this session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe @DKxx  less appealling than @DKx   because increased chance partner is short|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess can't argue with success|pg||
mb|1N|nt|loganrun: Club to the ace ruff a club, heart to the king ruff a diamond and clubs go|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, not exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: does Brightling hold these cards playing Rubber Bridge?|pg||
mb|p|nt|suzanna2: :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|runnerup: this time 3nt /5 clubs |pg||
nt|mamos: EW will bid 3NT|pg||
nt|loganrun: yes you are right|pg||
nt|suzanna2: a lot of distributional hands in the final so far today|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb:  why 1@s rather than 1@h?|pg||
nt|suzanna2: 1D opening is 10-14, may haveno diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bebechira: thx a lot Meredith for helping us|pg||
nt|bebechira: great job.. and Cathy fantastic job as well|pg||
nt|suzanna2: another pickup for ACT here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|suzanna2: sorry i don't know a lot about their systems|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|henryb:  I guess you bid 1@s because you intend to bid both suits|pg||
nt|henryb:  on your 2 count|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bebechira: Victoria on the way to victory it seems.... i was in the youth rooms until now|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|xenya: i'm told that on 24 Auckland (EW) are in 2@D...|pg||
nt|xenya: which will cost them a few imps i think|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: so 2 imps to Wellington on 24 and probably a push here|pg||
nt|suzanna2: yes this has been a devastating set for ACT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bebechira: but this scorline pleases me loool|pg||
nt|suzanna2: me too :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: go Victoria :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||

pc|c7|nt|runnerup: tx all --bye |pg||
pc|cK|nt|bebechira: the ANC played on home turfff....so we must make the most out of it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|babs59: although South will endplay himself I guess|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h3|nt|mamos: difficult for South to avoid|pg||
nt|henryb:  He might make this if he takes a lot of right views|pg||
pc|s9|nt|suzanna2: we have a nice sunny winter day today too|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: and Wellington win by 8 imps -- if this score is correct|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|h5|nt|babs59: perhaps I should have said South will get endplayed with all this discarding|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|serhat: will make 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|bebechira: bye all back in 10 mins|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry I misclicked a card somewhere|pg||
nt|rodal f: What is the problem. A free @C hook and fin.|pg||
mc|6|nt|suzanna2: so ACT clawed back 20 imps in this set but still a big gap for them to close in the last 20 boards|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bye everybody, we'll be back at 1:30 AEST with the next 2 sets of the final|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Thanks all|pg||
