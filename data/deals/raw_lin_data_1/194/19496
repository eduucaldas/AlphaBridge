nt|uttam: good aft from India|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome everybody|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: Netherlands are 7th currently, which means they have plenty of motivation (6th place goes to the world championship)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w tej rundzie potykaj¹ siê dru¿yny z 2 i 3 miejsca depcz¹ce naszym po piêtach - Anglia i Izrael...¿yczymy im z calego serca remisu|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Straight forward 3NT to start with|pg||
nt|oosb: Hi Uttam|pg||
nt|kemperg: so an important match|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: looks like this can make, losing a @C, 2@Hs and 2@Ss|pg||
nt|kemperg: @CK and @DK weel placed, no problems |pg||
mb|1H|nt|frankbo: ok han er ikke her|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi apecs - Minko - Richard|pg||
nt|2hplus4: hi there everyone|pg||
nt|2hplus4: N might have tried a second round X|pg||
nt|rado: zdr:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess that they reversed 1@H and 1@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: hi Oosman bhai|pg||
mb|2H|nt|spenny80: Italy 3rd vs Poland 2nd...|pg||
nt|rodal f: *specs|pg||
nt|iceblue: Hi,|pg||
nt|zebutin: Di Franco bid quite little with minor monster, but partner doesn't have @C J so 5@D seems most likely to go down, would need 2 entries in Rubinos hand + ruff to raise diamond suit|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Hi all|pg||
nt|zebutin: hi Johan|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@H (trf)|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: 2@h should make in comfort, so an easy start to the championships|pg||
nt|rodal f: A invitation? Positive or negative trail? Nope.|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably ew will play in diamonds|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi|pg||
nt|bebechira: last match for the girls|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Trianin|pg||
nt|iceblue: Do they play Netherlands club?|pg||
nt|chick: I don't like the 4@S bid myself, it looks more like 3@S to me|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie wiem natomiast czy naszym na odprawie przypomniano, ¿e pod Warn¹ zgin¹³ jeden znaszych królów póniej Warneñczykiem zwany...z r¹k tureckich sk¹din¹d...|pg||

nt|dagold: 3@h in the other room|pg||
nt|dagold: on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|dagold: so going down|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Vladimir, welcome|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  E/W|pg||
nt|dagold: In the other room north didn't sell out to 2@h|pg||
nt|richie: two strong pairs facing each other in this match, it will be interesting to watch I expect|pg||
nt|richie: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|raghavan: What  has happened?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Bob.|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: I would have reopened, too|pg||
nt|bebechira: comfortable level.... probably Ticha expected more from such a hand :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4s in the open room as well...so quiet start to a decisive match :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  hi all|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: this is the 2nd or 3rd time that I've see Birman lead 4th instead of 3rd, starting to wonder about that|pg||
nt|kemperg: In OR W in 3@C|pg||
nt|bebechira: very simple equation for Agustin and co... they must win.. and win big|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  italy still has a tiny chance of winning this tournament...they need a huge win and a huge defeat by israel, not very likely but you never know|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  belgium is second to last but has done ok with an experimental team|pg||
mb|2S|nt|eliran_a: hi all and welcome going to be a great match ! 1st against the 2nd !|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dagold: double or 2@s?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the wont challenge declarer too much with 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|spenny80: a normal 3NT on 1st board |pg||
nt|richie: 3NT is the only game which may have a chance with these wild distriutions, Magdalena Ticha will probably bid it |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  8 ver - nine...?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ever|pg||
nt|asig: 2@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re Frank:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Our teams this morning: The Netherlands are 1st and Italy 3rd, so it will be a thrilling match|pg||
nt|mrdct: can make 12 now with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: 1@sX in the other room, it needs courage to pass 1@sX with 7 diamonds though!|pg||
nt|rodal f: As we saw, NL use invitation jacoby.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Here we see EW plays the new swedish club|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  ofc would never missed that in my own hometown|pg||
nt|zebutin: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: EW showed semi-forcing-to-game, NT range, E transferred to @H, W accepted|pg||
nt|josj: good morning eleni|pg||
nt|josj: and gm Vladimir|pg||
nt|ntmon: gm Eleni and Jos|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h good morning Jos:) welcome|pg||
nt|richie: extremely complex board, there is no communication between the hands |pg||
nt|bebechira: they are playing in 2d :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: but Israel will probably have to say something about this ....|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we must say that they had a great tournament.. fantastic players|pg||
nt|richie: probably, let's see, it has already been proven they are excellent players but  not infallable|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol... |pg||
nt|bebechira: Eliran will say something about this for sure....|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Markku|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: maybe there is an interesting defence|pg||
pc|h8|nt|frankbo: :)|pg||
nt|richie: probably @s7, @sK and @dQ will be the best you can do as declarer and hope for something good|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: good mornin - dzieñ dobry - witam Pañstwa w ostatnim dniu rozgrywek dziewcz¹t|pg||
nt|bcmandal: 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chick: will go down 3 against a partscore at best|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|oosb: Since AK@S are both with @S|pg||
nt|oosb: even @C are blocked for defence|pg||
nt|uttam: 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|oosb: 11?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|uttam: y 11 becos of @c lay out|pg||
nt|josj: 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|marionmi:  very important match here between the nr 1 and 2|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jest to przedostania runda, druga po³owa meczy pomiêdzy dwiema pierwszymi dru¿ynami w tabeli|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't mind the 4S but it should have cost|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Hei alle. Sorry for at eg e litt sein.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  1@c is 12-14 ntor 18-19 Nt or Natural with transfer respones|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like easy 10 tricks, losing 1 in both majors and diamond, so still little time to get coffee|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and it's a good occasion to meet some world class players such as Agustin Madala|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dan_ehh: possibly going down now, as Padon has discarded his low @H and might get to ruff declarer's king|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eliran_a: both players of italy and israel are players from the highest level in the juniors playing over 8 or 9 years of massive bridge |pg||
pc|c7|nt|bebechira: west in 2s dbled in the open room...fireworks starting... very good|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bebechira: may be special sequence|pg||
nt|raghavan: PARTNER OPENS BEUGER HAS good hand why stop in 2D|pg||
nt|iceblue: S must play this 2@D as XYZ, game forcing.|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden in 3nt in the open room|pg||
nt|raghavan: must be|pg||
nt|chick: doubled would have cost enough to make my point :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with J@C favourably placed, 3@S makeable.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bebechira: in the closed W in 2nt|pg||
nt|bebechira: easier for our West in Diamonds..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Marion:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Top on its ways to France (N/S)|pg||
nt|eliran_a: i am expecting a high level match with some creative stuff ! the players are really talented|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And now is the point of this deal made or not made|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps in 2nd seat 3S is enough|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eleni: but the contract is makeable, as the @h finess works:)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Trying to do 5 here  but|pg||
nt|bobholl: they helped declarer with the development of @C and @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  WAS on tiÂ´s way...|pg||
nt|mrdct: she has a beer card too|pg||
nt|richie: 3x@h now and exit a low club will work (double dummy) hard to see with closed cards|pg||
nt|richie: not low club but 7 or 8|pg||
nt|richie: at the other table I think Rosaline Barendregt had to escape from 1@sX, it's usually bloody when opps pass a TO dbl on the 1 level, but not sure if 2@hX is such a big party|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hawe45:  But still -100 should be good for N/S|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S is actually less likely to be doubled for penalty than 4@S is|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|richie: straight forward line will succeed here, taking 1 rounds of trump and ruff 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: well done|pg||
pc|hA|nt|_fonzie__:  very nice play by madala to make the double finesse|pg||
pc|h2|nt|josj: what will happen to that 3rd spade?|pg||
nt|richie: 3nt = 430 and in 2@s you have 6 tricks so -300 it seems|pg||

mb|1N|nt|bebechira: 5d in the open room so flat brd to start with|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h for NS...and 5d save for 3 imps for EW|pg||
nt|bebechira: only 5 tricks in the closed it seems.... so what is 2 imps between friends|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: north thinkinh|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have the values for game here - but none seem to be making|pg||
nt|eliran_a: looks like a flat board of 10 tricks in hearts contract|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  note that 6@s is a bad contract but not completely hopeless. all you need is spades 3-2, diamonds 3-2 and 2 spades with 2 diamonds (or bare @d QJ)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@C should be 9-11 with 4+@S|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if south bid @h|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards sitting well enough to make 4@h|pg||
nt|richie: many people will bid 1NT in north, but I like dbl more when you hold only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bebechira: England had a steady start in the test vs India... cricket of course|pg||
nt|szalay:  hi all!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: Har d for S to find the @H lead?|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: juniorskiej |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but N would not have been doubling for penalties|pg||
nt|chick: not only is it a level lower, but it would double to game, whereas NS had no game|pg||
nt|chick: exactly, and NS had no game|pg||
nt|chick: so it's safer, and might push the opps too high, whereas 4@S has all the downsides|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1nt overcall maybe not to everyones taste, in zone, with 14hcp and 5card major...|pg||

nt|zebutin: hi György|pg||
nt|szalay:  its a really funny 1N call|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Hi|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like 4 @C tricks, 2 @H tricks, but 7th might be a problem|pg||
nt|szalay:  u know crazy man or genious: depends on outcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: teams profiles|pg||
nt|bebechira: for Netherlands|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h or 3@H is the normal result, only when the dutch girls here bid 3NT they may win some imps|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT is a normal invite - pass is modest by Sigrid (east)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=POLAND@@892|pg||
nt|richie: well... not difficult for Joanna :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: WD and domed the contract is.|pg||
nt|marionmi:  nice lead. not sure i would have led the same but Axxx usually isnt so attractive to lead from either|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: 6@C is not a bad spot|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I wonder if they can find it after west showing both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||

nt|bebechira: so first blood to Israel|pg||
nt|richie: 2@s went 3 down, first imps to Israel|pg||
nt|szalay:  do u mean stiff J/T?|pg||
nt|szalay:  in that case West could lead that (6card)|pg||
nt|bobholl: vulnarable 2@H now ?|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  east has to make this against a probable pass out|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east declares might dodge the @d lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is a sort of minimum hand without unbalanced 4M|pg||
nt|raghavan: yES OTHER ROOM MADE ot TOO|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden need a 21-9 to capture the silver|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@C? strong2? seems unlikely|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and he has a chance with this lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Dbl here shows atleast same strengh as 1 NT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  With no chnace to reach the dummy this will go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew makes this difficult |pg||
nt|richie: "blood" ? :) they score in IMPS not in blood|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: uffffffff|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  Good start ther to play @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: dhamapur, Vijay Anand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
nt|richie: 1@c = natural or balanced hands, 2@c forced to 2@d|pg||
nt|zebutin: would he? with 2card support to partners major and only 1 entry?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mrdct: north might consider a canape @s lead - but @d looks automatic|pg||
nt|iceblue: I dislike this strong2 2@C|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello richard|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome back|pg||
nt|richie: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|szalay:  but he has at least 2@Ds and 2 @s..|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
nt|spenny80: she hasn't information to exclude @d lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will take their 5 tricks quickly i expect|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena has good hearts but otherwise lots of loosers, minimum values and "wasted" @dQx|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Ofc W could be stronger also :)|pg||

nt|bebechira: well... i would argue this in this match|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hey all|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bebechira: Schwartz in 3nt|pg||
nt|eliran_a: only if west had 3 hearts 4@h could go down on a @s lead now as the cards set nothing can take it down|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt looks beatable|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT can be defeated with a @clead or return, 4@h is shaky but it should make|pg||
nt|richie: Madala fears @cA is wrong for him...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|raghavan: 5 D is likely to make |pg||

mb|p|nt|oosb: Action hand!|pg||
nt|oosb: NS semi-balanced, but look at EW hands!|pg||
nt|richie: I like the 1NT opening here in south, you have major rebid problems if you open 1 minor|pg||
nt|marionmi:  EW can make 4@s here but the 1N opening might create difficulties getting there|pg||
nt|marionmi:  and 5@d by NS is a good save, has some chances of making but not today|pg||
nt|richie: depends if Magdalena Ticha decides to bid 2@c for majors, then it must be easy for east to bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 4 imps for the Dutch girls|pg||
nt|richie: 6@s here in south|pg||

nt|bobholl: trying |pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if you see 680 at alle tables on board 3|pg||
nt|richie: a very thin 2@d overcall here by east in these vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: oh puppet stayman, I keep forgetting that|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 @s can be dwfeated here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|oosb: if they cash AK@D and switch to @H though|pg||
nt|doks: here probably NT partscore for NS, but can made game on perfect guess|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes D not good enough the other way declarer played properly|pg||
mb|2N|nt|oosb: he wont have an entry to finesse @C and get rid of @H|pg||
nt|bebechira: i can see the dutch girls lost 11 on 17|pg||
nt|iceblue: puppet 3@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3Nt better|pg||
nt|bebechira: Ida thought for a while and passed 4d |pg||
nt|bebechira: so first blood in the 2nd set goes to the dutch girls|pg||
nt|doks: N probably upgraded his hand to 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|richie: they may even get to 4@s, dbl-ed in south?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Are those 3rd and 4th hand slight opening. Whome to win.|pg||
nt|loe48: he will pass or bid 2d now|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would've opened the south hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: 5/4/2/2?|pg||
nt|spenny80: mhmh|pg||
nt|bebechira: Richard will update us during the match with the profiles of the Dutch girls... we hope|pg||
nt|richie: south knows partner is 3rd seat and should pass 3@d IMO|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she might have bid majors with 6@s and 4@h, so she can bid 2@s next|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR the 3NT also with 6 tr.  Could have made a push by making 7. Going for the @C|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR @CQ is the lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: -west argees and 500?|pg||
nt|richie: west has a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Even a slamtry :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ohh well:) a few imps for sweeden|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
nt|richie: I try - I know Magdalena Ticha just a bit better than Sigrid Spangenberg :)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, extremely wild board - please look at the movie|pg||
nt|richie: oof... 2@c not really my choice here - you really like to play in hearts, so 3@h is IMO a better bid, lucky that Sigrid somehow found a 3@c bid|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT now? and then 4@h|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I think I like 3N with the E hand even though there is a remote chance of finding a 5-3 @H fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: a few only ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: they will probably end up in 4@s, lanzuisi not going to go any furhter|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will be upset about this |pg||
nt|richie: she will not for sure|pg||
nt|richie: Dutch a bit safer now for the silver medal and sweden has to watch out not to loose bronze to France, every IMP can make a different between medal / no medal or the colour of it|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: now should be fine|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N and find partner with xx in @S or @C :(|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrdct: either a weak two or a red 2-suiter depending on what my system was|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1 extra trick|pg||
nt|doks: good passive lead|pg||
nt|bcmandal: can he makes it?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ntmon: 2NT is just checkback in case S raised on three - i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1st seat green vs red you must|pg||
nt|spenny80: good valuetion in south: i like a game  try with her good @h|pg||
nt|richie: west is showing 14-17 with 6@h4@c, east is bidding every bit of her card|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re:)|pg||
nt|richie: we are back- apparently some conn problems in Albena|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@c artificial showing all types of strong hands, to which 2@d is a positive response|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|murat e: slammish hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry 480/490|pg||
nt|oosb: and has Q@H himself, so can afford to play another @D, and let North play @H|pg||
nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
nt|mrdct: rewarded with 2 working hooks and trumps breaking|pg||
nt|bebechira: no chance of making this|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT has no play, Carole and Claire (NS) should be able to cash their spade tricks|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena hoping too much for better spades with her partner|pg||
nt|marionmi:  the 1N opening did its work|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is a good sacrifice against 4@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  most likely 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  a normal lead  but @s lead would be the best |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D vul against non-vul.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|richie: nice lead...|pg||
nt|bebechira: another big swing for the french girls looming|pg||
nt|richie: 2 down is possible|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we will have almost a draw soon|pg||
nt|eliran_a: dror have a nice hand but still his daimonds are useless|pg||
nt|eliran_a: not a good hand to raise with for a game|pg||
nt|zebutin: they sailed in to 5@H on other room, so might be good gain for Netherlands|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wonder if south knows about the 4 card fit though|pg||
pc|c3|nt|2hplus4: Good lead when dummy is known to be short in D|pg||
nt|richie: is 3@h semi-natural? east could also bid 3@d as invitation|pg||
nt|eliran_a: 2 down if the defence finds the @h ruff|pg||
pc|c9|nt|spenny80: in north strange decision: 4@h else 3Nt with 4-3-3-3... but work well here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|murat e: depends on the trump queen which is well placed for slam bidders|pg||
nt|gio 89: looks like 4@S will make 10tricks|pg||
nt|gio 89: unless a particular trump play|pg||
nt|bebechira: France 2 vps behind at the moment|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  apparently not|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HJ ain't the wourst |pg||
nt|bebechira: 3h in closed as well , by S as well|pg||
nt|richie: @s back is giving the tempo, it seems EW had to try for some club ruff, but I don't see how it could go down when declarer guesses the @h|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is great Youngsters are in Bridge in Europe|pg||
nt|bcmandal: now c|pg||
nt|richie: @H2 is a clear indication|pg||
pc|c2|nt|richie: I am surprised a bit by the 4@s bid by Magdalena Ticha, 4@h would be more descriptive - she usually bids it with these hands|pg||
nt|doks: not easy, but @D are right suit to start|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ntmon: with HCP 12-12 and 4-4 M fit you could not stay out the game - this is the rule|pg||
nt|eleni: nowhere to discard the losing @h|pg||

nt|bcmandal: had he played k?|pg||
nt|doks: @H are blocked now, can be hard|pg||

nt|loe48: og det er lag stil|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as @D10 was correct. Else S wouldn't used the @HK|pg||
nt|oosb: But was a decent contract and a good try|pg||
nt|richie: same as France :) they have always been one of the top nations two - it's always exciting when they meet and show both quite natural but good bridge|pg||
nt|bebechira: slam time|pg||
nt|raghavan: smae result in Open room|pg||
nt|richie: North's active contribution in the  bidding helped a lot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if W open they will reach 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: easy 6nt|pg||
nt|richie: yeps, seems likely to be a push - too many points and 1 ace missing|pg||
nt|richie: they dealt some wild boards for us today|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sorry z Czech...ludziom takim jak ja Czechy i S³owacja zlewaj¹ siê jedno:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: Morning all|pg||
nt|josj: 3nt for EW|pg||
nt|bebechira: same sequence in the open room... Fisher thinking what to do|pg||
nt|richie: another light opening? or preempt in east?|pg||
nt|bobholl: he didn't know that a @C lead would have been much better :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|dagold: good morning Alan|pg||
nt|rodal f: For de som vil følge flere bord: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|richie: north has 11 hcp but it's good enough for opening the hand |pg||
nt|richie: 4@s is a make in NS, EW do well to "sacrifice"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mr Gronkvist is biased for obvious reasons, so you need to cheer for Israel, Andy :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: and he bid 4nt...this can be a big swing for Italy|pg||
nt|runnerup: in 4 @s -you must avoid @s finess -|pg||
nt|eliran_a: yea , its becoming more and more common to respond the opening bid with negative hands , less then 6 points |pg||
nt|richie: I would dbl in south, your hearts are a bit too weak to bid them and you have some alternatives|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S could return the 9@H for @S and then it was -2.|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: spade switch was better than many would think..they forced ace out of dummy|pg||
nt|richie: west will give a mixed raise with 3@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: should play in part score|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bebechira: East in 2s in the open room|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes upto 3 Spades possible- |pg||
nt|richie: 2NT - 3@c // 3NT - 4NT // pass is my guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N seems to be the destiny of this hand|pg||
nt|eliran_a: also x from north here|pg||
nt|richie: anyhow, west will bid 4@s, no matter what, north dbl I think |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: but down on a spade lead|pg||
nt|richie: or not :) maybe she decided for 2@h because of her 4333 also sensible|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H and @S home so a nice sac at 5@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, rah rah|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hawe45:  3 NT will only make double-dummy|pg||
nt|loe48: det kommer nok 2nt naa|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS may stretch for a vul game here|pg||
nt|richie: partner opens 1@c and you hold this south hand :) you're not stopping under 6 anymore!|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Magda Ticha odnios³a du¿y sukces na ostatnich ME w Poznaniu gdzie zdoby³a br¹zowy medal w konkurencji par mikstowych w parze z Rittmeijerem|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  ;)|pg||
nt|eliran_a: this should be end the action|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: kolata did well not to interfere since he was on lead|pg||
nt|murat e: against 3 nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close your eyes and play @C towards your Jack - and good luck, with @D-tricks in East|pg||
nt|loe48: and prevented him to get to 2 good clubs|pg||
nt|josj: or maybe not as S holds @CAK|pg||
nt|spenny80: now in south?|pg||
nt|mrdct: south a little bit in the dark now with a nice preempt by west|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@d denies 5@Ss and 4@Hs|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess this is the only available game try |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  difficult call by south but he apparently had no problems to double|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: puppet stayman auction|pg||
nt|doks: very nice fitted hands, but dont see reason 4@S bid|pg||
nt|eliran_a: and a heart lead looks normal|pg||
nt|zebutin: not much competition for 4@S in N/S...making (and might make even overtrick)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: At OR NS in 2NTN|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot in the closed...now to make it|pg||
nt|richie: 4@H will be easy with @s finesse working|pg||
nt|andyv:  with W on lead, this can't be touched as E has no entries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an attractive suit to lead from|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will at least stop any chances for overtricks|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I 've great fan of Israel way to play bridge|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But not in this match|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  A tough choice for W there|pg||
nt|andyv:  being Greek, I was rooting for Zambia|pg||
nt|richie: only when declarer decides to finesse in @s he may go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: quess to do make/ down -spades finess -or club J -south|pg||
nt|eliran_a: Birman 2@s openening is a good weak 2 8-10 points |pg||
nt|eliran_a: sry only in 1st and 2nd seat . so here its weak 2 6-10|pg||
nt|richie: even in 3rd?|pg||
nt|zebutin: most likely they now get 2@H + @H ruff for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|murat e: hmm we can do that seeing all four hands...|pg||
nt|loe48: og 4 ganger hj er vel normalt naa og 8 stikk|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be a steal here though|pg||
nt|bebechira: now it is even easier|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: dummy always tables the jack when I lead K from KQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: B3|pg||
nt|oosb: Yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: north's best move is probably to pass this but normal action is 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: very normal|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would not pass 3nt :(|pg||
nt|richie: Sigrid taking the conservative approach with 11 and 4333 - 3NT won't cause inevitable problems|pg||
pc|s4|nt|loe48: that will be a rough task to make 8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now down|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But he is young man man so they love attacking leads|pg||
nt|andyv:  are we sure he ducked?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  11 makeable now?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|murat e: club queen doubleton and partner jumps on us...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Several times|pg||
nt|rodal f: Velkommen til Frank Bogen:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: i admit i would probably lead a @C|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|josj: a @S shift then still makes it more difficult|pg||
nt|josj: on a neutral lead, declarer might go after the @H|pg||
nt|eleni: they have 9 tricks though, 5@h+4@d as they break +A@s|pg||
nt|gio 89: again 4@s by NS this time|pg||
nt|gio 89: AQ@C still make life a little easier for declearer|pg||
nt|richie: yes, overtrick is born - Puillet unlucky to find partner with such a weak suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: more imps for the dutch girls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fisher was unable to read @S8|pg||
nt|bcmandal: dbl then jump raise should w pass?|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i dont like the 1@s replay by west after the double, with such a poor suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ntmon: after @CA there comes @S shift|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess we are|pg||
pc|c4|nt|loe48: hvis han skulle stoppe i hj, er det bare aa proeve for 8de stikk i spar|pg||
nt|josj: Ok Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|eleni: just 3@h but now with this lead it's easier|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|spenny80: Also south can pass (no 5@s in north and 3NT is unprobably)|pg||
nt|spenny80: to assure points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He thought it was from shortage|pg||
nt|andyv:  who needs to read?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be very expensive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It looks silly to duck, but if West had 8x and @CA it was necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So it is no error, just an unfortunate guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  then you congratulate W on a great lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Their lead is 1,3,5  and 2/4 through decl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andy, I think the 8 is more likely to be from 85 than from AQ85|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I honestly don't think that Fisher did anything wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  you may convince me Roland, but that would also assume that W had the A of @c and decided to lead a worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Now Mike is thinking could Lothan really duck from Kxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunately for the defense, W can actually shift here and have time to correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an unreasonable lead from a doubleton once dummy did not stayman|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then there is a good chance that partner has long spades|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|doks: 1@S is free bid, so 3@S must be invitational, then W have minimum|pg||
pc|hA|nt|oosb: I dont like the play though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely this is a steal though|pg||
nt|richie: both north players bid 4NT, taking the initiative|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Oups - bad discard the @H 2|pg||
nt|richie: south obviously is looking for the @d cue|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S has no confidence in partners bid:)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|oosb: -2 now on a @d back|pg||
nt|bebechira: 10 tricks in the closed...so 1 imp at stake|pg||
nt|kemperg: playing strong K we lead the Q here|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  looks like 2 down vulnerable if they find the @h ruff|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  which they will find, madala is just hesitating between playing hearts rightaway or a minor first|pg||
pc|hK|nt|richie: seems to be too difficult, you have the majority of the points and quick tricks in defence - I have sympathy for not finding the sacrifice|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: tabeli|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eleni: still if ducked twice.......|pg||
nt|richie: 6NT is a slightly better bid I think, to protect @dK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|uttam: well  west was not thinking|pg||
nt|spenny80: sometimes you can make 3NT (xxxxxx@c or like) but bidding a new double you don't arrive at 3NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep...flat board and next :)|pg||
nt|richie: small @d lead by Magdalena Ticha?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|dagold: Some players would overcall 1@s with the south hand but these Israeli players are very sound|pg||
nt|oosb: needed some @C ruffs|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello Shirley :)|pg||
nt|bcmandal: yes inviiiiiiiiiiiiiitational but ace and a q 4s is not bat though marginal|pg||
pc|h3|nt|richie: well played:)|pg||

nt|andreasw:  @s now and back to 10 |pg||
pc|hT|nt|murat e: yes but i think that was a restricted choice situation anyway|pg||
nt|oosb: so instead of a minor pickup, they'll lose a couple of imps here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: God morgen|pg||
nt|richie: there are 11 tricks on an endplay, cash the black suits and play @sAK4 to endplay east|pg||

nt|bcmandal: and a doubletin|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|spenny80: in team match i think pass is best bid|pg||

nt|rodal f: Agree u. |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|richie: I hope she wished her partner good luck|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  Yes, North would habe made 4 @H-tricks|pg||
nt|spenny80: in this situation and qith south cards|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would have bid 4nt...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: bez ³apanki|pg||
pc|s3|nt|richie: same here |pg||
nt|richie: declarer shortened himself too much, 1 down seems inevitable now|pg||

nt|bebechira: 14 imps for italy in brd 3|pg||
nt|eliran_a: intresting now|pg||
nt|bebechira: very|pg||

nt|bebechira: running scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890|pg||
nt|eliran_a: daimond ruff and a club and he will make it any other play he is going down|pg||
nt|richie: @cQ could work, as one kib suggested|pg||
nt|bebechira: Alon will make this|pg||
nt|richie: no, after diamond ruff, north just takes the club and plays a spade through|pg||
nt|eliran_a: so actually he cant make it anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup: declarer made this difficult for him self -but still chances like all see |pg||
nt|eliran_a: cuz he if ruffs a daimond and plays a club N wins and return a spade |pg||
nt|eliran_a: should get a gift from the italians to make this contract|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|eleni: and no swingsin the last 3 boards|pg||

mb|2C|nt|bebechira: South in 3nt in the open room|pg||

mb|p|nt|loe48: hva melder man naa hvis 3d er krav|pg||

nt|ntmon: Judith is optimitic in general? :)|pg||
nt|richie: interesting board... NS will compete in diamonds, EW in @c, maybe even to 4th level|pg||
nt|rodal f: With -1 by a @H lead?|pg||
nt|doks: must be same outcome, 7card @S opposit opening bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: good bridge, dont mind the 4@S's|pg||
nt|richie: partner has a good diamond suit, AKxxxx can be enough with your 2 aces|pg||

mb|3H|an|alerted|nt|josj: she has such a nice hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: S will not pass this|pg||
nt|bebechira: Di Franco in 4s...he must make to minimize the loses|pg||
nt|szalay:  all pass, I predictÅ±he will make it: 3@Cs, 3@D, 1-1 majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: I may have competed to 2@s with E's hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: 5c in the closed by W|pg||
nt|richie: or even 5, west has a strong hand (knowing partner is short in spades)|pg||
nt|richie: they play TO dbls... otherwise West could have X-ed, maybe east can X this?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: doubleton QJ are dubious values so I like the pass|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  100 against this is no good - 130 are sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In practice 5 @D will make, the 13th @S will save the contract, and East canÂ´t attack @C|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut e nok krav|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@S = weakest hand possible|pg||
nt|josj: why? isn't that expressed by "pass" any more?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 1@d, 1@h and 2@s i think here|pg||
nt|bebechira: clubs break nicely for Jamilla so she will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be a 1 imp swing here|pg||
nt|zebutin: couple ducks in @C to save entries?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D-bergen, good raise of @H|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@D bør være krav. Ellers kommer lebensol inn i bildet.|pg||

nt|richie: how would you bid the north hand Traian? 2@d followed by 3@d or immediately 3@d? (my choice)|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably she feels she has another bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: some imps will come for the Dutch I think|pg||
nt|richie: south needs to lead a heart, will she again find it?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  might lead a diamond |pg||
nt|bebechira: king of spades is nicely placed :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure as p was protective side |pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: other table club was led and 5 made|pg||
nt|loe48: ja 3ruter er nok krav, det er mest brukt slik|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s are possible for the Netherlands, as Q@s drops, but it has to be played very carefully|pg||
nt|ntmon: that's the matter of approach|pg||
nt|richie: horrible distribution for Claire (north), 3 down is the expected result|pg||
nt|marionmi:  JT9 looks attractive|pg||
nt|richie: I guess so, @d lead seems natural|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  west has the ideal distribution for a take out double in last position|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: tror han tar sine 7 nå|pg||
nt|uttam: agreed |pg||
nt|rodal f: A better color so natural lead.|pg||
nt|bebechira: and West bid 1spade|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s seems normal, needs some careful declarerplay|pg||
nt|richie: @s leads helps fortunately, now declarer has time to finesse twice in diamonds and also to ruff a @h|pg||
nt|bebechira: it is good that she is taking her time...important board|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Lothan is an expert|pg||

pc|sT|nt|murat e: does not matter since 4th spade is good problem is to bid the game|pg||
nt|loe48: it was a good lead here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but sometimes no arrival is much safer...|pg||
nt|josj: just stay at home where you are|pg||
nt|bebechira: not an inspired lead... |pg||
nt|richie: normal lead :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity East has not overtaken D|pg||
nt|bebechira: big mistake|pg||
nt|vasmar: this is the only lead to set 3NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  I was just told, that in practice 3 NT will make for the same reason, East will be squeezed, because only he can control the @C-suit|pg||
nt|josj: @H leads forcing dummy|pg||
nt|ntmon: if we are forced to bid at some level, the quicker we get there, the weaker we are - fast arrival rule |pg||
nt|richie: yes, I think she will raise - she never leaves an opportunity for game :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|richie: now Sigrid (east) has time to establish her clubs - won't take too long|pg||
nt|kemperg: but I ment the 4@S in N|pg||
pc|s3|nt|richie: it's not a bad game looking at her own hand, if partner's @dK is placed somewhere else it has already good chances|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would bid 2d...but in Oz we are shy :)|pg||
nt|richie: lol really? :) I was playing in Oz for one year but have a completely different experience :) :) :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: if reversed vulnerability i will think harder :)|pg||

nt|loe48: er vanskelig aa ungaa aa komme ut med de korta|pg||
nt|ntmon: in fact, there is no danger at 2@S - just partner should be on same wavelength|pg||
nt|josj: costs 100 more now...a great chance missed by Italy|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... where?|pg||
nt|bebechira: easier rather|pg||
pc|h5|nt|josj: assuming 1@S shows five already, passing 2@H is mandatory, een more so with this particular partner|pg||
nt|josj: even|pg||
nt|eleni: had Rosaline passed after the 2@h by Flavia, things would have been easieer for N-S|pg||
nt|spenny80: last board 3Nt was down 4 because south has played x@s tu the 9! I don't know why...|pg||
nt|spenny80: hi Frank|pg||

nt|2hplus4: Don't think so Any passive lead would do it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ntmon: when you bid such 2@S you make life harder for opps, in case deal belongs to them|pg||
nt|gio 89: 110 for NS where EW can make 3@S|pg||
nt|richie: yarrawonga :) near albury/wodonga|pg||
nt|bebechira: VBA is the main club in Victoria...have you been there?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden can not afford a big loss here...they can loose cthe bronze medal|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a push board|pg||
nt|kemperg: lots of playersdont like a weak two with taht|pg||
pc|hT|nt|_fonzie__:  belgium has pulled 3 imps back after an italian overbid in the open room|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|richie: on her way to making the contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: Ida in 4spades as well... 5 of hearts lead|pg||
nt|richie: I guess only the @c lead would put major pressure on the declarer|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ntmon: though i don't know what 1@S exactly promised|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1OT so 1 imp gain|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland marching along... 15-1 after 4 vs. France|pg||

pc|s5|nt|richie: at the other table South (judith nab) overcalled 1@h and was raised by north, they may find the @h lead now|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: OR still struggling with B3 2NTN|pg||

mb|p|nt|loe48: med hand som det der kan en x nu vaere rett..etter 3c fra makker meld 3d som er invitt?|pg||
nt|richie: nice result for the French pair in Open, after the 2NT opening it will be copied|pg||
mb|1D|nt|timve:  normal 4@H by south|pg||
nt|ntmon: she might have excited with @DQ|pg||
nt|ntmon: exited *|pg||
nt|eleni: a really weak pre-empt, but then as they are not vul, it sure makes life difficult for E-W|pg||
nt|mrdct: disciplined 3rd seat pass by west|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 5c was a flat board...|pg||
nt|richie: firm preemptive action by Carole Puillet but very reasonable, only the 3-3 majors are against it |pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab only 3c in the closed and playing there|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s most likely spot|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I guess Birman was going to bid 2@C if Padon bids 1@H|pg||
nt|richie: we will never know :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: they will bid 4@S again as N/S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: og ikke 3d krav til utgang|pg||
nt|spenny80: if someone open..|pg||
nt|mrdct: north may pass this out|pg||
nt|frankaus: cansino count suggest 4th seat pass|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: maybe Birman can bid a "bad" 2NT here as Padon surely has a fit in one of the minors|pg||
nt|eliran_a: the action gonna end in 3cl|pg||
nt|richie: 3@c is some invitational hand with 6+@c I think|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  dangerous hand, even 2@s by E can go down here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|loe48: i og med de aapner lett|pg||
nt|oosb: This could get dbled|pg||
nt|ntmon: defence was soft but i can imagine EW were happy to set the contract|pg||
nt|gio 89: X by W is best decision for me|pg||
nt|richie: good suit and green vs red are favouring this pressure bid - it's difficult for opps to exchange information but as we can see it did not work here|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is invitational|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  At the club you often see people ruffs with their small trumphs that you need later :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  dbl is @s |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Good way to get auction over quickly|pg||

mb|p|nt|dagold: 14 imps to israel on board 4 for making 3NX+2|pg||

nt|richie: or will North do some sacrificing?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bergen from Ticha?|pg||

mb|2C|nt|murat e: pass...|pg||
nt|murat e: 12 hcp and double fit on the bidding is too much for me to pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 @D should be an easy winner here|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hope they do not go to slam|pg||
nt|bebechira: there 2-3 marginal boards per set///and they must be given special attention|pg||
nt|richie: 3@H or 4@H?|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h|pg||
nt|doks: 2@H is on, so going down in 3@C are not that bad|pg||
nt|bcmandal: yes intreshing auction|pg||
nt|eliran_a: might be a little swing for israel in this board , N-S can make 3@s|pg||
nt|szalay:  its a must after DBL|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  See if Rubino find the killing def|pg||
nt|zebutin: @H J well positioned, so opponents can't get 3 heart tricks if declarer doesn't play that suit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: E should know that W must have 4@D|pg||
nt|gio 89: since she didn't bid 3@s over her double|pg||
nt|gio 89: and opps should have 9card fit in @H|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  1Cl was 12-14 / 18-19 Bal or Nat|pg||
nt|szalay:  what is the killing def?|pg||
nt|zebutin: hmm, yes could lead @H J to pin 10|pg||
nt|szalay:  but East is on lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: but how to get to rubinos hand?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But has no entry to do that|pg||
mb|2D|nt|loe48: 3d er krav, derfor sier jeg at x kanskje er mer korrekt melding..og etter 3c. meld 3d som er invitt hand nu|pg||
nt|timve:  east west can maybe make 5@C|pg||
nt|timve:  but very hard to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  lets sea if E/W can defeat this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... 1nt-3c all pass|pg||
nt|richie: South surely won't :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@s xfer to @D i think and 2nt showing good @d's?|pg||
nt|bobholl: minors with short @S ?|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  overboard now|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N was definitely wrong sided|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: 3@hX in the other room...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is perhaps a bit of a stretch but Cilla would have raised 3 anyway|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Remind that E just shows 6 points w the double :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@s in open room|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Play should not take long either He'll try to ruff D in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Lebensohl|pg||
nt|murat e: though tehe right bid here...|pg||
nt|murat e: lebensohl |pg||
nt|asig: Yes, taht was a rather lucky contract|pg||
nt|timve:  normally two spade losers|pg||
nt|timve:  but on 7x hearts....|pg||
nt|bebechira: woow|pg||
nt|richie: wow! south really doubled... now things become interesting...|pg||
nt|richie: on board 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... this will a swing|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|richie: I think 4@h is justifiable|pg||
nt|richie: but 3@h probably better in green, still need good values from partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  this will help the decl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@s should bid bye a nice 12-14 bal so |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Karlsson's @HQ at the other table was better|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  When you have KQx in trumphs you dont want ruff with them|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: *that|pg||
nt|asig: 4@S is makeable here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, no double, but not very nice|pg||
nt|uttam: cards are well placed for defence again|pg||
nt|josj: I think so too as they had not doubled|pg||
nt|eleni: S did not open in the open room, neither N bid anything, so E-W reached 4@s|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@S should make with the favorable @H lie|pg||
nt|kemperg: bad or scramble, 2N is goaad|pg||
nt|kemperg: good|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: favorable @S lie too, need two entries to finesse twice|pg||
nt|kemperg: my typing is bad today:(|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 4 of a minor makes too|pg||
nt|szalay:  generally better if u play a game when STRENGTH is on lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|loe48: de aapner med 11..saa ikke desidert krav hand|pg||
nt|gio 89: 4@s not a very thoughful bid I think|pg||
nt|gio 89: pd can't have 4@s and the suit is kinda ugly|pg||
nt|richie: East wants a spade return, so in signalling she could best take by Ace, then King, then Queen and 9|pg||
nt|bebechira: so more imps for the Dutch girls and Richard is happy :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B5 OR ended 3@HSX|pg||
nt|doks: same contract here as well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|timve:  aj|pg||
nt|timve:  now a spade discard by Ticha|pg||
nt|timve:  and I think she will pitch a spade|pg||
nt|timve:  with AK10xxxx east would have opened 3@D|pg||
nt|timve:  I hardly see another line to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: any chance for an extra trick?|pg||
nt|richie: you can make an overtrick if you play the diamonds for 1 looser|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And a @c in to W suit(often could be 18-19 bal) is not a good start|pg||
nt|2hplus4: These 5 major + 4 minor bids are fine if you win the auction|pg||
pc|s6|nt|raghavan: 2 tricks loss cannot be avoided|pg||
nt|bebechira: farnce 157 sweden 156 after 21 brds|pg||
nt|bebechira: france |pg||
nt|richie: yes, they overjumped them - poor swedes at the open room, they missed a few chances|pg||
nt|2hplus4: If you defend, it is almost double dummy for declarer|pg||
nt|richie: I am not sure if NS can enter the bidding, but there is a greater risk EW will play in @d|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they are on their way to the slam.. and it is not easy to bid after 1nt!|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|oosb: Well I dont like the flat 14 upgraded to 1NT, unless they play a smaller range 1NT ?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  that might get expensive|pg||
nt|richie: likely to be -500|pg||
nt|richie: they led a trump which solved one problem|pg||
nt|bebechira: Mikael from Sweden recomended 6d...and right he is|pg||
nt|runnerup: but this goes dont with normal play perhaps|pg||
pc|s9|nt|doks: by the way, Denmark take 3rd place now, by leading 22-0 vs Poland|pg||
nt|zebutin: so if 4@S is played from S, and makes @H J lead this could go down...don't see that happening to any of the matches... |pg||
nt|szalay:  btw:|pg||
pc|s7|nt|richie: lol, absolutely :)|pg||
nt|richie: farce?|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, the it seems like 4@s should make even with a @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like an overtrick now that spades are 2-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure about making with a heart lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  in CR, W tried to pull trump immediately which cause the loss of control on hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It seems normal to cash @CAK|pg||
nt|bebechira: Di Franco going down...so 13 to Israel soon|pg||
nt|eliran_a: now he is going down|pg||
nt|eliran_a: in 3@c|pg||
pc|sK|nt|szalay:  if East doent open:|pg||
nt|szalay:  may be go down now|pg||
nt|szalay:  for small@H switch|pg||
nt|bobholl: kib says : 2@S shows 5 diffirent hands...3 spade show 1354 with intrest in slam|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: lead from wrong hand|pg||
nt|murat e: kolata at the other table one off in 4 spades interesting after heart lead|pg||
nt|oosb: but once he has opened 1NT, with QJxx @H, the 3@H free bid makes sense|pg||
nt|gio 89: board looking pretty bad for us|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 4@D was setting the suit?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hawe45:  @H King seems to come from right hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 500 enough Y|pg||
nt|szalay:  no its 3easy|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i think it is better to pass 3@D as west|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: B3 ended 2NTN-1 and 11IMP to Norway|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: sneaky switch|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but west can see that everything works for declarer, so why not|pg||
nt|kemperg: only entries are in trump, that's leaders problem|pg||
nt|bobholl: has to guess @C Queen|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that is correct and needs two finesses @C and @D.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|richie: but lots of work to do, Sigrid (east) is probably happy to see @HK (I would :))|pg||
nt|raghavan: On hearing a 9 card fit in Spade, others are forgotten. But Open too in Spades only|pg||
nt|kemperg: now he is home|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has to very careful not to lose control of hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  now no problems|pg||
nt|bebechira: we have 1000+ spectators wow... fantastic for the young players|pg||
nt|andreasw:  knowing where @h K is and later finding @d Q would be a small sign of W having it? |pg||
nt|bobholl: has to guess @D too :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: makeable but not a good slam imo.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  why not a good slam ? can finesse both way in both suit wich needs finessing and @h K can be well placed?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slams which are dependent on placement of particular cards cant be called good.|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is better than a roland slam but not good enough :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  this looks like at least down 2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|murat e: draw trumps play a heart north takes and must exit with another heart|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: well done by Wackwitz|pg||

nt|eliran_a: now dror should play club to make it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bebechira: the swedish girls are my favourites for the bronze|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|timve:  yeah always hard to see for east|pg||
nt|marionmi:  ok, then its not THAT expensive since 3N made here. but on the other hand, they surely would have found the killing lead so they lost a chance for a big pickup|pg||
nt|szalay:  sure East has the Ace|pg||
pc|d9|nt|richie: @d for 1 looser: you have to guess which of your opponents has Honour doubleton: either play small to JTx or play J|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: not to be fooled|pg||
nt|zebutin: well Di Franco has told the points...but small @H would give some option... @H J gives no chance for defence|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|hawe45:  We have been told, that West can always make 4 ! S - I call it double-dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: Although theres always the possibility that pd has a bust hand, and you get dbled.|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|ntmon: 4@S  a normal outcome of this deal|pg||
nt|gio 89: if E menages to hold it to -3/4 it could be a push since NS should make 4@H|pg||
nt|richie: still not easy to defend this, Magdalena will play @c now, west will have to play a spade at one point|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eleni: -1 is a good score for Italy|pg||
nt|szalay:  but I say if East is passin in 1st hand|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome to Bas van Beijesterveld|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h and 3@h were a bit too much...|pg||

nt|mrdct: usually right to pass it out in 4th seat if you don't have the @s suit|pg||
nt|spenny80: strange|pg||
nt|frankaus: P + number of @S = pass with <15|pg||
nt|spenny80: with 5/5 11count and a major...|pg||
nt|richie: the more conservative approach in the open room is paying off so far|pg||
nt|richie: hello Marleen :) excited to watch your team?|pg||
nt|neobas: Thanks Traian :)|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, 2H worked well in assuring a heart lead, but i wouldnt have bid it on a 4 count. And 3H..... well.... :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Fisher in 3d in brd 5 as well ...so that will be flat|pg||
nt|zebutin: but you know 11 is mandatory opening with balanced in junior games...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: chyba W wistowa³ przeciwko 3 BA?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|eleni: right Vladimir|pg||
nt|spenny80: I open|pg||
nt|richie: when France and Sweden both have the same number of VPs, France will probably become third, they won the match against sweden 18-12|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: But would you have dbled with South's hand?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sweden got a lead of 12 now|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: north has a nice hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal 3nt here ,but you never know|pg||
nt|szalay:  its not true|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  east took the right decision to withdraw from 3nt undoubled, as 5@d x -1 is a better result than what would have happened in 3nt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|loe48: its very fast to get out on thoose..but a cleat 1s opener imo|pg||
nt|loe48: clear|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: opposite a weak 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: En interresant hand. |pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all - There was a duplication error which meant that board 20 was duplicated into board numbers 20 and 21. The boards they cannot play will be replaced with new ones. However, ...|pg||
nt|neobas: due to the operator not having the file with the hand recrods, we will probably not be able to broadcast it on BBO, regretfully|pg||
nt|richie: these north hands are problematic in many systems: many points, no stopper, no 4+@S |pg||
nt|neobas: Not a good result for the Dutch in the OR|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  5 cl in other room here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mrdct: whenever i open those sorts of hands i write down -110 5 minutes later|pg||
nt|frankaus: no of @S is an important factor|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witam ponownie|pg||
nt|spenny80: here 4@s could make|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the Dutch girls now to recover some imps?|pg||
nt|garden2005: pa³uj|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B4 2@HE as here.|pg||
nt|timve:  in the other room Barendregt even ducked @DQ lead.... |pg||
nt|gio 89: NS should make 4@s, conceding 1@d, 1@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|richie: Claire Chaugny and Carole Puillet probably solved this problem by bidding 1@s and X showing 4+@s|pg||
nt|richie: Big score for the french again...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is easier|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @h K lead (not the best )|pg||
nt|2hplus4: france made 3NT on 2NT hand. declarer played a D at trick 2 which was ducked|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: just need AK of @H for 6 |pg||
nt|kemperg: tried for 6, will now bid4, S showed a minimum|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@H likely some sort of minimum|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 2@d to takie silniejsze BA jak widaæ|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gio 89: not so easy to get there though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and makes even on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|doks: after quite partscore, doubled slam deal|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, they did open in other room too, but opened with 1@C, so S could not come in with x|pg||
mb|2S|nt|loe48: ja, men vil de komme i topkontrakten 6nt naa med daarlig tilpass|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S fra S nå så blir det vanskelig for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: the solitary @h stopper wont do the job here - so @s is the only viable game|pg||
nt|richie: I guess Magdalena (west) will lead a trump|pg||
nt|kemperg: still trying|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pos³uszny|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  passive bidding by N/S|pg||
nt|timve:  although I agree with both bids|pg||
nt|timve:  3@H or 2NT with south is too agressive|pg||
nt|marionmi:  now what will Ticha lead? ace of spades, trying to shorten declarer? a trump to prevent the ruffs?|pg||
nt|richie: it's often good with 4 small trumps to lead them|pg||
nt|marionmi:  you know her better than i do :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 2NTW and a swing to come.|pg||
nt|richie: we made it to some kind of rule :) 4 small trumps = trump lead|pg||
nt|marionmi:  a lot of bad breaks here|pg||
nt|chick: poor defense doesn't count :)|pg||
nt|chick: finally EW bid hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: s vet at makker har max singel ruter naa|pg||

nt|frankbo: tror han prøver med 6sp|pg||
nt|loe48: fordi ikke stoette fra 3 til 4d|pg||
nt|oosb: Meanwhile Hungary picked up 7 imps in the 2@D deal|pg||
nt|eleni: Margherita is right thinking |pg||
nt|frankaus: i willl see if they are short elsewhere as there are 3 comment. here cu |pg||
nt|neobas: Surely W has a hand to get into the auction here|pg||
nt|richie: depends on your perspective|pg||
nt|bebechira: nope|pg||
nt|iceblue: 4@C=trans to me |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Counted for about 15 IMPs there!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Here a @C-lead is the only CHANCE to keep declarer to his 10 tricks|pg||
nt|loe48: this is a typical need to cash tricks contract..a slip and it makes|pg||
nt|frankbo: her må motspillet sitte|pg||
nt|frankbo: kommer nok kl ess|pg||
nt|frankbo: 10 fra håkon ,nå må sp skiftet komme|pg||
nt|loe48: yes ace of clubs are probably next|pg||
nt|loe48: he cant see his king of h as a trick yet so want a ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: but 3NT quite difficult|pg||
nt|mrdct: defending 3@hx will pay dividends|pg||
nt|marionmi:  how should she play? win in hand and play a spade?|pg||
nt|richie: interesting board, declarer has to be careful, and NOT finesse in @hs|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@d is puppet to 3@h with supp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: support for what?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So a dangerous board for sweden|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well, 93 is not what I call support :)|pg||
nt|doks: other room Lightner double discover @S suit and @DQ as well|pg||
nt|garden2005: wist kierowy najlepszy na 3NT i na 4@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@D+2@C+1@S=5, -1. and no disposal of losers.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eleni: unless she attacks @d early|pg||
nt|eleni: and this is what happens when one opens so light instead of a weak 2 or multi opening|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT final destination - it will be difficult enough|pg||
nt|bebechira: Magdalena pass?|pg||
nt|bebechira: but after 4c ...what can she do?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@d can be defeated, you need accurate defence: club lead, ruffed, @d to K, club ruff|pg||
nt|neobas: Peculiar X by Nab in the OR|pg||
nt|richie: @s to K|pg||
nt|richie: 3rd5th lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h went 2 down in the open room|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 22|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrdct: particularly on a passive defence|pg||
nt|richie: as the cards lie you can make 2@s, if you get a @h lead 1@h, 2@d and 3@c for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  something is being lost in the translation|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like we are heading to 5@c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And 4 cl Short @c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So we may ending very wrong here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a feeling that East meant 3@D as stopper ask after South's interference|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes she mean that|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: 4@H er fort que med litt i @C. Men...... usikker.|pg||
nt|loe48: 6 kloever , 6d og 6nt staar..vil de lande paa fotene her?|pg||
nt|frankbo: sorry han melder jo self 6 kl|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H looks ok on the surface, but there is a forcing defense|pg||
nt|kemperg: its a 50% slam|pg||
nt|richie: I like the 1NT overcall here, even though you don't have a double stopper you have plenty of tricks available - 2@c overcall would make life much more complicated|pg||
nt|garden2005: raczej wygra niestety, przez trefle|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: korzystna pozycja trefli dla rozgrywaj¹cego - krótka 9-ka ale jeszcze trzeba trafiæ|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if you look at it the way i do:D.. it is almost a 100% slam unless the is a ruff out likeig @S where sitting 9-0|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|murat e: this must be a flat board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I said CHANCE - no good guess, indeed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not after @C10|pg||
nt|timve:  only if you play Bergen|pg||
nt|spenny80: may be -1 in 3@h|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or draw trumps and take the double club hook?|pg||
nt|richie: 2 more imps|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 2 more imps for the dutch girls|pg||
nt|doks: @S are not in picture this deal here. Goes for @D slam probably|pg||
nt|chick: yes, counts for score but not for whether to bid it or not :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: i would quess kind of "puppet" sequence, 3nt telling 5c @H and 4@D transfering to it|pg||
nt|szalay:  couldnt: instead of it: didnt|pg||
nt|szalay:  I think if u have 3.3 majors, u can|pg||
nt|szalay:  yes, u can:)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so now with everthing wrong for decl|pg||
nt|zebutin: this might need some help from defence|pg||
nt|szalay:  no other option than @C lead, imho|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  look s like north is describing an invitational hand with 5@h and 4+@d|pg||
pc|sA|nt|timve:  you can bid 3@C|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT is off from the top (with a @H trick) and defence should be able to cash out|pg||
nt|richie: I guess you could better try to ruff 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or take in dummy and start playing clubs right away?|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes same in Open too|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  W continue to Que|pg||
nt|atalok: slmlar|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And a Cl lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@s on last board for Ita to|pg||
nt|szalay:  sgtrongly doubt North could switch another than @S|pg||
nt|szalay:  @D is ok if pd has stiff K/A of @H and @D honour to 3 (exactly)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|richie: I would try for that, and establish diamonds as we go|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, but then you have to win a high heart in dummy right away and you may have to ruff 1 or 2 spades with your high trumps in hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HK lead was what declarer needed in the other room|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so i think he pass now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which seems a strange lead after West had shown hearts. Then the other red king looks more attractive|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: chyba Tuczek pokryje 10-kê trefl królem?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mrdct: getting @s right the key now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ruff one seems to be enough for =|pg||
nt|andreasw:  like if*|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Eller topp kontrakten. Well done.|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know how, but good end here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am wrong it seems:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes so both swedish pair should remember board 7 |pg||
nt|atalok: yorumcu olarak sadece ben varým herhalde artýk idare edersiniz.|pg||
nt|szalay:  or AKx in @D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|richie: playing spades, however is not very appealing... and neither of the opps will play it for you|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab in 2c in the closed|pg||
nt|richie: that's also true- maybe @sJ9 stops the spades a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately, Johan was right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-2 fits at the 4-level usually don't play well|pg||
nt|doks: E expected more from W 3@D bid, so both Q must be found|pg||
nt|doks: very big swing on air|pg||
nt|bcmandal: yes either way|pg||
nt|chick: or as someone points out, a simpler club ruff :)|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  club lead is most comfortable for declarer|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wilkinsona: yes seems Scotland may have done better than -2|pg||
nt|uttam: deal 4,5,6 are good for Hungary|pg||
nt|timve:  still north will decline the invite, missing good spots in the side suits|pg||
nt|josj: E had better bid 2nt rather than 3 if they play this sort of light opening bids|pg||
nt|2hplus4: C ruff gets it over quickly but even so declarer has a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|h3|nt|loe48: er en ok slem ..skal man vaere i slem saa er 6nt rett|pg||
nt|frankbo: rut 3-3 kl 3-3|pg||

nt|rodal f: Seems u was right.|pg||
nt|ntmon: but as in many cash-out situations, things might no go right way |pg||
nt|richie: 5@d made now, carole puillet evaluated her hand better than Judith Nab in open room with the 4@c bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... you were saying about finessing richard????|pg||
nt|richie: 4@h will go down here, @druff coming |pg||
nt|richie: I don't remember :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: why is Magdalena thinking....is this worring you?|pg||
nt|richie: not at all worrying|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|richie: just contemplating, only problem is that @d8 can also be played from 832|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes|pg||
nt|richie: and 2nd problem is that partner encouraged in spades|pg||
nt|richie: and third...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But we have seen examples of a 4-2 fit being the only makeable game|pg||
nt|doks: imagine You play vs Zia siting on S and DBL 7@D. Where You place @DQ?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: playing safely|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bebechira: defeating or making is a 4 imps difference|pg||
nt|richie: @s2 is disappointing... another trump would have worked better|pg||
nt|marionmi:  would easts diamonds be count? should be lavinthal maybe|pg||
nt|richie: they show count|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 OR the NT ended -1|pg||
nt|richie: small swing|pg||

nt|rodal f: @C10 should have been a nice warning.|pg||
nt|josj: that's what I meant|pg||
nt|eleni: now Margherita is home:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: here we are :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: but @c switch when S gets in will kill dummy|pg||
nt|spenny80: need @c back to beat|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I think thier rule is to playing their ordinary system when W could bid nat 2@h but if Opps bid after the answer they play more natural like that Cilla thought|pg||
nt|doks: E was completely sure about @DQ on W, he dont even ask|pg||
nt|bcmandal: my way|pg||
nt|doks: or 6th @D|pg||
nt|bcmandal: another hurdlt|pg||
nt|bcmandal: hurdle|pg||
nt|zebutin: so one down and on to the next board|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eleni: and simply take them and run:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: :)|pg||
nt|josj: interesting: S can see 9 tricks once she ducks @SJ...|pg||
nt|eleni: at times shooting an impossible contract pays back:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: of course, we know .. she should take it and play @DA  .. but ..|pg||
nt|eleni: probably never heard of the rule "3rd high" and never rescue your partner either:)|pg||
nt|richie: big swing at stake here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well 5 here and 5 there make 10 for me:)|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hmm, west can't get more than one ruff, so maybe safely was not required here|pg||

pc|h5|nt|mrdct: all that remains for the defence now is to duck one round of @d|pg||
nt|richie: no overcall in spades at the other table, so the contract is played in north, it could make a difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A board to forget for Sweden in both rooms. Happens to all of us|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: always fun when your 2N opening gets passed out|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes it is often so that your partner cant support you because you have sutch good suit and you miss an eay came --1 such looking board where here 2 days a go and both tables in 2@d ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: that time -just a like hand as west had -both bid 2@d -that time and passed |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  another slam hand here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mrdct: @h vs @s here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Making 4@H here is the easy part|pg||

nt|loe48: og kan hadde kort for meldingen..kan ikke vaere kylling om man skal skape noe|pg||
nt|loe48: sperr er effektivt|pg||
nt|bebechira: 10 VPs separate 2nd from 4th   7 between NED and SWE and 3 between SWE-FRA|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  should be easier to bid than the one on board 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: but as they are so young, they will learn:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: @s usually win but at what level here - 2 or 3?|pg||
nt|bebechira: np Bas... lucky compression applies|pg||
mb|1H|nt|loe48: stjele melderom fra motparten|pg||
nt|mrdct: at least 3 now :)|pg||
nt|spenny80: lol|pg||
nt|richie: I think it should be a push on board 7 as the first 2 tricks went|pg||
nt|raghavan: may risk a Heart bid|pg||
nt|richie: anyhow, a chance for Sweden to get back into the match|pg||
nt|andyv:  all finesses work here|pg||

nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|spenny80: 2@c?|pg||
nt|ntmon: nice of Magda Ticha in OR to stop low|pg||
nt|richie: time to sign-off in south, ugly hand|pg||
nt|doks: DBL=4+@S and 2@H most likely transfer as well|pg||
mb|3N|nt|loe48: han har 7 stikk, saa er grei nok 3h..man regner alltid med litt hjelp fra makker|pg||
nt|raghavan: well passed|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT looks like a compensation bid for the lost imps in the previous board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||
nt|chick: NS can make about 3@H|pg||
nt|andreasw:  altho @c lead will take the income away and will need @d Q well placed anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: her blir det noen beter ja|pg||

nt|rodal f: Netherland got one IMP at B4 2@HE+1 here and = at OR|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT is very thin, 2NT will be hard enough :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This is now a 5 @C X for 300|pg||
nt|spenny80: reasonable bidding|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|richie: yes but I think even the other 3 countries (Sweden, France and Italy) have a chance for silver or even gold when they perform well in the next three matches - they all play against ...|pg||
nt|richie: each other|pg||
nt|marionmi:  i think i would like 2@s here better by east than 2n, then you make partner aware of your spade shortness |pg||
nt|marionmi:  she doesnt need to have a very good spade stopper for a 1 level nt bid|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, usually 1nt is more like 8-10 in this situation|pg||
nt|andyv:  more interesting for us would have been what E would have done over 3@s by W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT 14-16 Johan?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  no 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your son must learn to count then :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: D may prevent the protection|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 3D|pg||
nt|frankbo: only 3 loosers|pg||
nt|frankbo: not enougt tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: getting @s right will be helpful and if you can get east to open-up the @d suit you are in good shape|pg||

nt|josj: maybe she thinks she is...|pg||
nt|spenny80: maybe :)|pg||
nt|richie: slam on a finesse - both tables stay out of it |pg||
nt|bebechira: W had a very good hand...depending on what 4s was|pg||
nt|marionmi:  i doubt this contract will make|pg||

nt|frankbo: god skift|pg||
nt|oosb: top 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3N may be bid now though..|pg||
nt|richie: and another small swing... here west may make 8 or 9 tricks, after this lead and lucky singleton @dQ|pg||
nt|richie: south will try a small @c I think|pg||
pc|d7|nt|richie: me too but we can never be sure|pg||
nt|bebechira: 23 a flat board in the end|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't 2 8's count as 1 point?|pg||
nt|doks: good news is that no one dbl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  10 tricks now|pg||
nt|zebutin: kibitzer suggested @S J on 1st trick, which could make life easier for partner|pg||
nt|bobholl: it helped prevented NS from the making slam|pg||
pc|d3|nt|richie: it's good when partner either has @cT or J|pg||
nt|andreasw:  S pretty sure of where @d Q is:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|murat e: 4 hearts one off if defence can manage a spade ruff but unlikely|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s helped n/s but i think 3@s was the normal end|pg||
nt|mrdct: east may need to unblock the @cK to avoid being endplayed|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  belgium missed game on board 7. the defeat is starting to get heavy|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|richie: even 10 tricks possible now!|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But math isnt his best part :) |pg||

nt|josj: 5-5 is right|pg||
nt|gio 89: NS landed in an unmakebla slam|pg||
nt|gio 89: missin AJ109 of trump|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ntmon: wonder if they have method to show medium 5-5|pg||
nt|spenny80: Final contract is not so bad at 26 cards.... at 52 is the worst|pg||
nt|josj: I doubt it...|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Not so easy things to count points|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  in 4@h Madal lead @sA so a nice score to Netherlands now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|spenny80: but is strange consider W hand as strong hand.... a natural bid is better when it can|pg||

nt|zebutin: so there was some other lead than @C... :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|spenny80: 3Nt with @h lead (probably) is near to make|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|loe48: han tok den rett vei, men bogen er ogsaa kort i spar, saa ikke mye glede av den finessen|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|loe48: bogen signaliserer spar naa|pg||
nt|ntmon: E might have tried 3NT instead of 4@D ?|pg||
nt|spenny80: could bid 3@h|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@H would give away too much i think|pg||
nt|spenny80: 5@d is long with a balance hand and only 5/3 trump |pg||
nt|richie: Rosaline Barendregt was more careful in her declarerplay|pg||

nt|bebechira: wow...nice|pg||
nt|eliran_a: ok , well done|pg||
nt|richie: clearly they do :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: for sure... now Delle Cave thinking|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -but north is he thinking or asking -well done anyway|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1@h xfer to @s and i think 3@c is 3@S and a good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: This should make comfortably|pg||
nt|eleni: For results pls go to : http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|mrdct: you aren't going to get partner too overboard with a 2@h bid given that you are a passed hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: I prefer 2@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  this contract will make, but 2@s might make as well|pg||
nt|richie: pass over 1@d by west looks strange but her philosophy is that an overcall should be useful for the lead, @sA9xxx is worse than @sKT9xx, then she would surely overcall|pg||
nt|doks: 3NT good for NED, but from right side (W) there are no defence|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Bos like to support his partner|pg||
mb|3N|nt|asig: I think I would have upgraded the South hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is nearly @h game but bad distributions again so only 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Forsvinner @D fargen?|pg||
nt|loe48: der forsvant ruter farven ja|pg||
nt|oosb: Both black aces are friendly|pg||
nt|spenny80: good pass, very difficult for me to pass with W hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: and 2@h will surely have some @s tolerance or support|pg||
nt|richie: Hungary plays well, agressive style and putting lots of pressure - they made a pretty tough already for some top teams|pg||
nt|marionmi:  NS can also make 3@d but it wil be difficult to get there after the 1@c opening from north|pg||
nt|iceblue: yes, by E. but why not raise 3@C?|pg||
nt|richie: now, south made a TO dbl, north had to do the same, but didn't|pg||
nt|garden2005: 500 do zarobienia, pa³uj|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: vanskelig utspill fra S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: chance to go plus here, then|pg||
nt|ntmon: nice to win over heavy favorite, even for a half :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w 24 o jedno s³owo za du¿o...i to jeszcze przed Blackwoodem|pg||
nt|bebechira: how can theey make this?|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|murat e: doubling 4 dia cue bid for the same reason|pg||
nt|uttam: in fact aLL Aces are friendly|pg||
nt|josj: W gets another chance now|pg||
nt|spenny80: y a minimum sure|pg||
nt|richie: @dJ lead, @s to A and @d (north spade) east LOW!|pg||
nt|richie: misclick|pg||
nt|bebechira: true..|pg||
nt|jkotor: E has to know sth more about his partner to pass twice :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: i believe E wanted to try 3nt..but he stopped in 3d|pg||
nt|garden2005: nie dos³ysza³ :(|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @c ace and a @C now is best but i dont think this can win?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|hawe45:  But as both North and South can count on a hopeless @D-situation, we will stop in 4 @S|pg||
nt|loe48: and its not a hopeless spot if cards sit|pg||
nt|spenny80: Hxx with bad @h... i prefer 2@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, but maybe you can double|pg||
nt|richie: she can try, maybe partner will pass - and so she does|pg||
nt|doks: and this 5@D is more difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: som vi ser 6 ruter er en fin kontrakt|pg||
nt|timve:  3@S was a cuebid|pg||
nt|timve:  not splinter|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think one down here|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Nice play in C|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 7 ..another big swing for Israel coming up...Ron bought the hand in 2h undbled|pg||
mb|5S|nt|dagold: that should seal the deal|pg||
nt|asig: Killing led from Jones|pg||
nt|timve:  that is surprising|pg||
nt|spenny80: now i was better to bid 2@h not 3@c, to show raise @c (pass before) and long @h|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or make something yourself, like here|pg||
nt|richie: yes, dbl is perfectly fine of course|pg||
nt|richie: Israelians show their superiority|pg||
nt|bebechira: great bunch of kids...a great program as well for bridge development|pg||
nt|bebechira: World Champions and veryy soon European Champions|pg||
nt|eliran_a: birman might affraid of a an overruff in @D and ruff with the @dA whice is doesnt matther the hand always makes |pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  well....|pg||
nt|timve:  this is lucky for th Italitans, they cannot stop, while knowing they miss 2 aces|pg||
nt|timve:  but luckily for them @HK is onside|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the juniors Israel is edging ahead...they will be hard to stop.... may be Agustin will have something to say about this|pg||
nt|doks: even @S are 3-3 and @H 3-3  I cant see from where 11th trick can come|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  1nt was probably a tactical bid, hoping for a @s lead against nt|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  3@s was a splinter and there i think east got scared of his own bid|pg||
mb|6N|nt|asig: *lead|pg||
nt|ntmon: such a X is normally for T/O|pg||
nt|mrdct: possibly 2 down if @h misguessed|pg||
nt|spenny80: A@h is probably in W when she see Q@d K@c and probably Q@s....|pg||
nt|richie: france 158  sweden 157|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't want to be in 3NT on this deal|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  he has 3 cards that could be important for partner so 4@h was an underbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: I don't see how this can go down|pg||
nt|spenny80: it would be very strange|pg||
nt|ntmon: a thrilling contract, why not to look at|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|richie: clearly some moment of misconcentration|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2down for 1 imp?|pg||
nt|bebechira: and israel in veldhoven in october... great results|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: also a thin neg x vul from w|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if e play @h when she take with Q@d...|pg||
nt|bebechira: for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good play by Cilla not to win her @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When you have trump length you don't want to release your big card too early|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same goes for Axxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It probably does not matter here, but she showed very sound technique|pg||
nt|andyv:  it will pay off in the long run|pg||
mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  and i would never have continued bidding with wests hand after 4@h|pg||
pc|s8|nt|murat e: one of the well on paper but doomed slams...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I guees, many pairs will - without this anti-bridge-@d-bid - will come too high here|pg||
nt|asig: (and obviuos, too)|pg||
nt|spenny80: Gib says +1, but only seeing all cards|pg||
nt|josj: I tend to agree with GIB :)|pg||
nt|josj: he plays them so well...|pg||
nt|spenny80: :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na widno sz³o 12 lew w BA|pg||
nt|richie: here it can also still go wrong|pg||
nt|richie: but @c back by east seems normal|pg||
pc|s9|nt|timve:  nice lead by Sigrid|pg||
nt|bebechira: Murdoch father and son at westminster live...very rarely you see a media mogul questioned on live TV|pg||
nt|zebutin: now opponents get ruff in @H... needed to duck the lead for that not happening, but that is playing with open cards|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  to answer specs questions, running scores are on http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  and i'm not sure about the meaning of 4@s|pg||
mc|13|nt|rodal f: Som 6@H med fargen 3-3 eller finne 10X contra KX|pg||
nt|richie: they Israelian juniors are extremely impressive... also in White House Juniors this year they overclassed all other teams - and likely to get another gold medal here too|pg||
nt|bebechira: I vugraphed Israel in the semis and in the final in Philadelphia and they are a very good team|pg||
nt|richie: professional team almost, some of the players even are pros|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C K and @H makes it very difficult|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i think its just blackwood, to which east answered that he has 2 keycards and no @h queen|pg||

nt|loe48: then 3c-3d|pg||
nt|richie: yes, look at the other matches: Poland will play Italy, Netherlands, France and Netherlands will play France, Poland Sweden |pg||
nt|bebechira: i play some sort of multi|pg||
nt|richie: you can say whatever you want, but it's not boring|pg||
nt|bebechira: lucky not doubled|pg||
nt|doks: so we have allmost level at this match|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i didnt like the bidding sequence but good judgement in the end to push to 6@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: scotland has opened their a/c|pg||
nt|richie: I prefer 3@h|pg||
nt|bebechira: we integrated in precision|pg||
nt|richie: ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N makes here and 4@s didn't in CR|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Or the explantion of a bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: 2@H Muiderberg|pg||
nt|zebutin: partner opens and you have 24hcp...seems good?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|richie: I think they looked at the results two years ago and scheduled accordingly: in the last match no 1 and 2 meet (Poland and France), no 3 and 4 (Netherlands and Sweden) etc|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol...Friday and Saturday will be a feast|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good news for Danish supporters. Denmark were 0-25 down after 4 boards, now the scoreline reads 33-25|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: EW make lots of tricks in C|pg||
nt|chick: I think they can make 5@C with some crossruffing|pg||
nt|bebechira: we are on brd 10 and the closed is on brd 7|pg||
nt|richie: east has only 9HCP but great values and a void, it's enough to open 1@s|pg||
nt|atalok: geçen elin moral bozuklugu ile burdada forsingmiydi oynamak içinmiydi karýþmýþ|pg||

mb|2C|nt|murat e: 4 of a major too high for both|pg||
nt|asig: NS may bid 4@h on this one|pg||
nt|runnerup: nice 5 @d but because ew om board -cards well placed and makes :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: can may 6@c or 6@s here if you are good at dropping Qs offside|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: I say that North should nt take bidding to shes hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: against Italy|pg||
nt|bebechira: i vugraphed Ron-Lotan in Philadelphia and they drove me crazy... the slowest juniors ever|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pikowy zabójczy na 5 karo|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Tuczek - tylko spokojnie proszê|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mariasz kier ci siê "marnuje" |pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: and go 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|rodal f: B7. 6@S-1 i OR og 17IMP til Belgia.|pg||
nt|loe48: med 2 langfarver so i den 6nt de meldte her er beste kontrakt alltid  6nt..for det er nok en av farvene ordner seg|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as def slipped at 1!NX made 7 and Netherland back in the lead.|pg||
nt|ntmon: large gain for Italy, now match almost close|pg||
nt|spenny80: they don't play polish club?|pg||
nt|mrdct: assuming the dbl promises 4@s (i have no idea if it does)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not sure|pg||
nt|doks: if I remember correctly, this is of city in NED|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 @h seems makeable|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Will they duck grand now?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|spenny80: 4@s??? over overcall 1@d?|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i heard polish club is out of favour with a lot of the juniors these days|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Danes had the same horrible start against Israel yesterday but went on to win the match by 19-11 VPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: deja vu perhaps|pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason for N to insist on @s contract?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Tell their captain to wake them earlier|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Is he good enough for 5C?|pg||
nt|richie: now he tells partner about the good fit and shortness in @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: so no worry about ns playing this board|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@HNX. Sr|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: She should bid 4@d instead of 4 NT|pg||
nt|richie: in the meanwhile Hungary has a small margin (40- 11 imps) over Sweden, no 3 at this moment|pg||
nt|chick: the @D bid makes his singleton worth more (less chance partner has wasted values there)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: E may save the day|pg||
nt|eliran_a: Lotan player with bar taranovski in phili|pg||
nt|eliran_a: played|pg||
nt|eliran_a: but they are still slow|pg||
nt|zebutin: diamonds behave so 7 makes...but not exactly best contract|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿na wytrfzymaæ|pg||
mb|3H|an|alerted|nt|murat e: east must avoid spade lead though|pg||
nt|oosb: Is everyone bidding 3@H here?|pg||
nt|uttam: 4h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure after the x..|pg||
nt|uttam: but he has devalued @ck|pg||
nt|oosb: yes so I like 3@H|pg||
nt|oosb: but can imagine some aggressive 4@H bidders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the x is doubtful, but hard to stay out of these auctions|pg||
nt|uttam: free 3@h bid conveys enough information to ur p|pg||
nt|oosb: Honestly against a passed partner that hand is too flat for a dbl for me|pg||
nt|oosb: So I might lose imps in this deal, but I pass as West|pg||
nt|spenny80: really?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i meant by south|pg||
nt|richie: straightforward 3NT, @hK is protected so it should  not be very problematic|pg||
nt|antoniz: Witam serdecznie|pg||
nt|doks: 2M promises 5M and 4+ in any minor weaker than normal opening|pg||
nt|chick: 5 clubs to the Q and a major suit Q are all he needs|pg||
nt|andreasw:  E-W in other room Rimstedt are twins and for me at least it is impossible to see who is who:D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 8, no slam in OR either.|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: no, well done|pg||

nt|richie: time to claim :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: S must no its a misfit for him, p has 4 or 5 @H|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass good|pg||
nt|richie: I believe you have to do too much work in 6@s, unless North leads @dK there is a chance|pg||
nt|atalok: burdaki 2 D 4.renk yerine kullanýlýyor|pg||
nt|atalok: klasikte 2 cl der gibi|pg||
nt|bobholl: exactly not :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  7@h is better|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, 7@H might even make to decentish...or closer to it :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: and good morning to Bob too :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H T is not easy to find :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So Drivjer mada an light openingin board 8 so they are in 2@d dbl|pg||
nt|bobholl: in the bidding|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wrrrrrrrrr|pg||
mb|4S|nt|spenny80: 3@d i think is forcing...|pg||
nt|richie: what happened here? doesn't west have a normal 1NT rebid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|richie: in 1NT you count 7 tricks when you manage to make 3 spade tricks, best line would be to attack them a.s.a.p. and leave the heart suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: you want to help here?|pg||
nt|bebechira: sorry.....private|pg||
nt|richie: hi everyone|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi Richard|pg||
nt|bebechira: tell us what was the mood in the Dutch camp after the defeat to Poland|pg||
nt|bebechira: oh yes... where Tarnovski disspeared?|pg||
nt|bebechira: very talented as well|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can count upto 8 tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: I hope so :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: ok|pg||
nt|chick: 4@D down one but he has to do the hearts right for that|pg||
nt|richie: 5@c is an overbid IMO - after the splinter 4@h tells your hand enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: thu we have 17.18, fri 19.20 and sat 21 isn't it?|pg||
nt|bebechira: strange|pg||
pc|s3|nt|murat e: oh|pg||
nt|spenny80: lol|pg||
nt|doks: I recieve some very trustfully confirmations about my bridge history knowledges.|pg||
nt|eliran_a: 4@d i guess is a last train bid , and 5 daimond is first cue bid|pg||
nt|eliran_a: nice stop |pg||
nt|runnerup: and in that number 7 -west bid 2@c with that hand -which was 1nt here -so they never found any big ns -300 but not enought -so listen to Richie 1nt with such hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 2 karo to nie by³ negatywny wybór koloru tylko magister |pg||
pc|s2|nt|loe48: 11|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's better not to test partner here, being a passed hand |pg||
nt|josj: defence can take 4 tricks at most on this layout|pg||
nt|spenny80: with lead K@d, if when you take with Q@s don't play A@H you make 6...|pg||
nt|richie: good question by one of the kibs, where should EW have entered the auction on board 25? I have no idea... maybe 3@d overcall by east when you play it as preemptive|pg||
nt|richie: honestly I have no idea - I am not in Albena|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith rebid 1nt on the same auction|pg||
pc|sT|nt|timve:  good contract, but normally going off|pg||
nt|richie: aha! for the juniors!!|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes ... :)|pg||

nt|hawe45:  No more comments to-day - this is too much|pg||

nt|timve:  srr|pg||
nt|richie: makes more sense|pg||
nt|richie: this can go 3 down with maximum defence|pg||
nt|chick: @H10 right now|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Duck and give partner H ruff still beats it 2|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @H 10 you could try to raise @S, without it might try for @H even & @D not more than 4-2, or @H 4-2 and @D 3-3/J10 doubleton... or something like that...|pg||

pc|d2|nt|timve:  it does|pg||

pc|c9|nt|spenny80: 5@d asking Q@s|pg||

nt|zebutin: of course you could have some @D+@S squeeze too which ads little to the possibilities|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bebechira: that's for sure... very good team|pg||

pc|c3|nt|timve:  aj|pg||
