mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|stoffers: good and actual 5@c bid from Sam here|pg||
nt|sveing: 5@C are top spot but think E will bid 5@H?|pg||
nt|stoffers: shows exactly 5-5 also, as he would bid 4NT with 6-4 and wouldnt pull with 5-4|pg||
nt|sveing: agree|pg||
nt|muppe: N thinking about 6@c?|pg||
nt|stoffers: partner always have 5+ @s in this spot, so 4@s was an option i guess|pg||

nt|sverjohn: Yes|pg||
nt|stoffers: Thats just bad|pg||
nt|muppe:  i like that at 5+ level K for count, too. parter with QJ+ should still show count, not to play the Q always as playing Q is pretty natural but count is then more important.|pg||
nt|stoffers: The case for Q is when u can put partner in for a lead trough declearer|pg||

nt|oliverc: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: perhaps should have finessed other way -because then only 1 doen ,which is better than in 3nt (-2)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in the slam zone|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|d!|mb|2D|mb|3H|nt|andersk: Might be case for playing @S Q, since South opened and N have @C A|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|andyv:  E didn't make things easier by making some silly bid showing the minors so N basically has to rely on his instincts and table feel on the @s suit.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|runnerup: ligth takeout double and they found a game -now only to make /+1 -even perhaps|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|andersk: Even with @D K lead, u have nothin to discard @C on, so better find out where @C A is by playing @C|pg||
nt|loe48: east have showed kq in club..so maybe put some values west also|pg||
nt|loe48: but still a pure guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  and, if he  decides W has the J@s, will have to finesse it immediately as entries to dummy are sparse.|pg||

nt|vugraphztc: they are writing on the bridgemate, not thinking|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Liv Marit, good morning to you|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Liv|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: hi all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Bjørn Olav Ekren is the man behind the 2@D weak with both majors convention|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting Michaels (presumably) on five to the nine. Still, West has nice spades  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Goes without saying that he does not play it himself|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I used to, in one of my partnerships - but we gave it up |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Thx Liv Marit :)|pg||

nt|oliverc: a fairly routine 4@S for NS here|pg||
mb|5S|nt|runnerup: 25 -ok anyway -easy gane|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the reason we gave it up is that in a competitive auction it was not easy sorting out the suit lengths|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: hi John|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is eith 26 Hcp -so top for defenders for sure|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|oliverc: everything well placed. Just 2 @S and a Heart to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N might be even more routine. @s suit so poor for NS that possible to lose 3@s tricks|pg||

nt|andyv:  probably 3N by NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: By North even|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Probably on a D lead|pg||
nt|loe48: both ways should lead to 3nt as i assume 3c show some values|pg||
nt|oliverc: So Declarer got the Spades wrong on  9|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to tell whether lack of entries or E having only 1@h influenced N in the @s suit.|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sorry, I have visitors and have to go. Thanks everyone. Enjoy the rest of the set|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think 3@D is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, prefer 2@S|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|andyv:  that probably was the most convenient play because of the entry to dummy and give N one more chance (stiff J@s), then playing immediately to hook W.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The thing is that they can't beat 3NT, unfair|pg||

nt|Walddk4: All too predictable|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW did well to drive NS out of their makeable contract(s)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 matches of 7 boards today, 4 tomorrow to end the week long festival|pg||
nt|andyv:  with lots of pairs using Ogust over weak 2 bids, the quality of the suit becomes less relevent...and multi 2@ds also has no requirement as to suit quality.|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: well played by Marstrander|pg||
nt|andyv:  final board of this set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am willing to risk that spades are not 7-0|pg||
