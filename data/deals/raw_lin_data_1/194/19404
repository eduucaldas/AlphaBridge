pc|hK|nt|vugrapha2: Yuen has revokes with the @S7 (on the @HK)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: director called etc.|pg||
nt|woozle: Thompson goes for a crude sequence (2C then 2NT over 2H/2S looks more flexible) and Gardiner chooses a very poor 3NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugrapha2: the @S7 is now a major penalty card|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: good valuation West|pg||

mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|bebechira: we have Cathy operating and she is doing a wonderful job|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Mundell, sry|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello everybody|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kemperg: and Ian|pg||
nt|haans: most would bid only 2@H |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cascade: 4@H looks a slightly better contract to me|pg||
nt|bebechira: youth final will be 4 sets of 10 boards|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|haans: bad 10 pointer|pg||
nt|bebechira: she is playing in NSW youth team...|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cascade: the advantage of Smolen is that the strong NT hand gets to play the 5=3 fit if it exists (and you bid it)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: The upside of the Smolen convention is that you will always make the stronger hand declare the contract, provided that they both remember the convention|pg||
nt|bebechira: Victoria has a 29 imps carryover|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: hard to see this going too fer wrong|pg||
nt|woozle: er..far|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|woozle: Thompson, who apparently never gets two aces in dummy, prefers a 4H opening|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|woozle: a budding disaster for victoria here, if thompson shows two keycards and the trump queen with 5S|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: a passive lead gives this a chance, although East can still start leading trumps after he wins the club ace|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Yuen in the tank and now scribbling questions|pg||
pc|cA|nt|woozle: If Yuen leads the club ace, he should work out that there's another ace missing after he sees dummy|pg||
nt|woozle: Higgins will need to clearly discourage|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: could be the @HK missing though|pg||

nt|sybarra: oh good hope I am there and also see Cathy in finals |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  will EW find their @d game or 3NT|pg||
nt|cascade: might be hard for north to only invite here|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s hands fit well |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Unfortunately NSW didn't do so well with youth..|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|bebechira: 30 boards to go in this final|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|cascade: and then the defense need to establish their heart trick before declarer can build a club trick to beat 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which did not happen next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is a Bergen raise, limit|pg||
nt|cascade: five card support, two aces, two doubletons and vulnerable at IMPs i think i would be bidding game!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand a tad too good for that in my view|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  3@h may show min. with @ss|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@s a likely make, how good is it|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: hard to imagine south accepting her hand is as bad as it could be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree that Wood should sign off opposite a limit raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: next year Cathy!! |pg||
nt|bebechira: N will play 4h and itwill be quick i suppose|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cascade: some players make a limit bid then bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But Touyz changed her mind|pg||
nt|cascade: as Touyz has done here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: need diamonds 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Viv may get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Other suits are not attractive to lead from|pg||
nt|mamos: i guess this must be two-suiter weak South is presumably jst raising |pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike,  you happy with only 3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: but maybe @s Kx in pocket|pg||
nt|haans: but all honors working|pg||
nt|mamos: but you dont have @s10 so probably not one you care about missing|pg||
nt|cascade: i feel if you choose to consult partner then you should stick with that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would you lead, Wayne?|pg||
nt|cascade: its true but trumps are not that attractive either|pg||
nt|sybarra: magic hand,  as the @D are 3/3 |pg||
nt|sybarra: pesky that @H's are 3/1 |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I didn't think E had that option (to bid 4@s) but this should go down 2 (4@s and A@h), minimum|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bebechira: this is not the kind of board ACT needs...they need swingy boards|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cascade: i like to attack but that is a guess here|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of tricks here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cascade: a trump will usually give declarer a tempo|pg||
nt|cascade: would you lead a trump Roland?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome to Frank Budai|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: I think I know what went through Touyz's mind. "I am not good enough for a Jacoby 2NT, and I am too good for 4@S. So I'll make a limit raise then bid game later. That should convey ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the message". Just a guess|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  please correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 8@s did not win the first trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  first spade trick that is|pg||
nt|andyv:  we may not be able to get a record of how the hand was played|pg||
nt|sybarra: little does she know |pg||
nt|mamos: may be if WA are already quite away behind there is a case for bidding  more|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry lost them|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. red |pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: if you do not pass 4@S you find many slams that will not make|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: 5@S  is always a horrid thing to play -- no gain but lots of strain :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
mc|11|nt|haans: not p-clubs at its best|pg||

mb|2H|an|alert|nt|woozle: Higgins starts with the scientific 1H instead of the bludgeon of 3H or 4H|pg||
mb|2S|an|alert|nt|woozle: At this vulnerability, Yuen does best to describe his hand rather than seek a low-level penalty|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|sybarra2: this is cue raise of some sort |pg||
nt|sybarra2: (my guess) |pg||
nt|woozle: Thompson looks at his bidding box...does he have any pass cards?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra2: sort of like unusual over unusual |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Good for EW as long as Higgins sticks the double..but 5H may make anyway on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: This is part of the case for opening 4H...if partner doubles 4S, you know you can pass it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|woozle: probably SK lead anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S in the other room went for 1100, so Higgins is playing to only lose 10 imps. EW achieved that contract by the back door of West doubling 4S to say that he was itching to bid ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: howcome 11?|pg||
nt|frankaus: we will get them for the final set i expect|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  I don't know what 2@h is here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strange when looking at four in the dummy|pg||
nt|cascade: and they didnt cash their diamond tricks |pg||
nt|bebechira: intersting hand... open room in 4s making|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  perhaps it's weak with majors|pg||
nt|haans: my vote for 3@H|pg||
nt|cascade: EW need to stay low with their distributional hands |pg||
mb|4H|nt|mamos: did he dperhaps draw trump and conceded Diamond?|pg||
nt|cascade: this is potentially 800 i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know that Viv would like to double, but I also know that her partner expects 4-4 in the majors for that, so she will probably abstain|pg||
nt|sybarra: W with a lot of points  but where to land? |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 3 nt?|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we have 2 very good matches on VG from ANC... i do not understand their option for the spingold|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  W has an easy 3N bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Oh, she did :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hands with voids are always difficult to evaluate when preempt openings|pg||
nt|bebechira: TD is Laurie Kelso...and he is trying to mantain a good "tempo" to all matches ...he is sometimes very strict with time at the club|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: that not best surely|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry  was distracted by my grandchildren|pg||
nt|bebechira: he offered 80 mins for 10 boards... lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: i think 90 would have been more generous|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to speed it a bit |pg||
nt|bebechira: we had last week Albena..and they were more generous there|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not be where W had thought she would play this bd if it goes all pass|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S ? then a kiss|pg||
nt|bebechira: big kiss|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the @s holding is such that EW do have a @s stopper|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now he doesn't know which suit to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At this level I think you should have 4-4 if you are this weak|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow Max double din his room...more imps for ACT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  E should have little trouble getting 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wayne?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At the 2-level fine with me|pg||
nt|cascade: yes i would pass|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably we play with screens - 85 is the standard time for ten boards|pg||
nt|bebechira: we play with screens yes|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 80 is not very generous from Laurie|pg||
nt|bebechira: doubled in this room ..lol sorry for my spelling mistakes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cascade: partner needs a good hand to make anything|pg||
nt|cascade: and the odds favour her not having enough|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mercifully undoubled but it matters little as 3NT was made next door|pg||
nt|bebechira: how many off...i can not count lol|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: this could be a disaster |pg||
nt|bebechira: i think this IS a disster :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: surprised no X but maybe didnt want to give hand away and afraid of another suit?|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: 5@c |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s dodgy here, 5@c best I think|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2NT showing hearts and clubs, at least 5-5|pg||
nt|cascade: hope NS have good agreements as to strength|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Take the money!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have 800 again this|pg||
nt|cascade: although wood is probably going to game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 1100 if declarer misguesses trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two top hearts, @SA, spade to king, spade ruff, @CK|pg||
nt|cascade: they have to get their spade ruff which might not be obvious with the stiff trump|pg||
nt|cascade: easy if you play obvious switch |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't|pg||

nt|cascade: yes and a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice smooth duck by Joan|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: of course most people can't bid 2@C naturally as a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: because of Drury|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Wood feared declarer had @HQ10 left and that she would get two spades away|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry they played a bit too quick for me :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hence the shift|pg||
nt|cascade: south had a safe club and the spade wasnt going anywhere|pg||

nt|Walddk2: First time for you I hear|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yep|pg||
nt|athene: well maybe 2@C WAS drury here :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and decided if you play drury or not |pg||
nt|mamos: im afraid thats a pretty awful sequence and outcome - any bid that precludes 4@h  must be wrong|pg||
nt|sybarra: but given the raise to 5 @C, ...not sure that looked/sounded like drury |pg||
nt|athene: it definitely wasn't drury for north :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe for south though|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Cathy is a member of the NSW youth team|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: We're not doing so well though....|pg||
nt|cascade: perhaps but she should have had a count from north|pg||
nt|athene: north should have splintered with 3@S over 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: then you have room for 3nt, 4@H and other luscious things|pg||
nt|bebechira: please check the VG schedule..tomorrow we hae 4 sets coming to you...|pg||
nt|sybarra: dealing machine having a field day!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: I agree, but it's so much easier for us|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2nt = 18-19 in my book|pg||
nt|haans: 12-14 in beginners books|pg||
nt|cascade: indeed it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think double is much better than 2@H|pg||
nt|bebechira: we are clashing a bit with Toronto...but forget about Toronto...Melbourne more important |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 3N can be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a decent slam |pg||
nt|sybarra: you time zones so different,  really does not come into play |pg||
nt|athene: Melbourne is much sunnier than Toronto (usually - maybe not this time of year) :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: yesterday we had 3 celsius in the morning....freezing|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought a 4@D splinter was most descriptive with the south hand|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@C Slam try  but North wont be excited|pg||
nt|athene: if north thinks 4@C is a splinter, she has a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: today was a better day 16 at lunch...so quite pleasant|pg||
nt|athene: she might offer 6@D|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ianmcc: not after West bids, surely|pg||

pc|c2|nt|sybarra: we are in the very high heat range well over 30c |pg||

nt|athene: easy for EW to get overboard here|pg||

nt|cascade: not on this side of the planet :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 2@D both majors|pg||
nt|mamos: gain to Wellington on the hand where 4@s went three off 4@h succeeded in OR|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@s (showing shortness) would be a nice gadget to have for W|pg||
nt|kemperg: weak NT sure, but with this distribution no other bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: our youth are wonderful...ready to help our cause all the time|pg||
nt|bebechira: 16-10 for ACT this set...so 6 imps back|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: 6nt would be interesting|pg||
nt|cascade: the WBF rate is nearly 90 minutes|pg||
nt|athene: spade or @CA lead would be costly|pg||
nt|mamos: looks  a fairly ordinary 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: now,  do you bid 4th suit (gf) or 3 @H or ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: not my favourite opening method but works well here|pg||
nt|haans: Can 2@D be Ekrens?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I strongly disagree with the 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|cascade: passing 1@s with that much is really trusting partner at this vul :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No points and no room taken away from opps|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S is clearly spades but i have seen people have misunderstandings over whether it's forcing|pg||
nt|frankaus: gr8 hands - they have been feeding the dealing machines red meat :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: 5-9 nine cards in Majors|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry 6-10|pg||
nt|haans: bidding good Avoided slam though|pg||
nt|haans: and best lead|pg||
nt|ianmcc: will be lucky to squeak 4@h|pg||
nt|kemperg: not easy to get 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: yes Germ trying to work out best line - may take some time|pg||
nt|athene: what is west supposed to do with, say that same hand but no @CK or @DAKQ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with E |pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: but a good suit and favourable vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: this may fail |pg||
nt|athene: i don't bid 3@H  because it's surely not forcing in australia|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: now the pull to 4 @H is slamish |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  this will not do well on @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They may get to 6@H and that is easy to defeat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as Viv Wood will lead her singleton|pg||
nt|cascade: west may opt for 6NT yet|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  if they go down, EW will have had back to back disasters|pg||
nt|kemperg: i'm not impressed by Wellington :(|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: i think east has slightly overstated her hand - 4H over 2@D was ok|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: How do you explain the second downtrick?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and need to say out of game here |pg||
nt|sybarra: *stay |pg||
nt|athene: tricky choice with east - double gets both suits across but loses the fifth heart which might be quite important|pg||
nt|bebechira: the director is looking for brd 25 now :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: @c lead holds it to 4@S|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|athene: oh yes, she went two down|pg||
nt|athene: errrr|pg||
nt|frankaus: or @DA then @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  or canape style...not sure it fits into any catagory except The Little Major system|pg||
nt|mamos: two good boards for Wellington|pg||
nt|kemperg: S happy he did notbid 2@D for majors this time:)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: if east wants to bid over 3@D then i prefer 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  EW already getting too high|pg||
nt|haans: hard to see S cards as prempts|pg||
nt|athene: tricky lead decision for south here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: people often lead unsupported aces just because partner bid the suit and it usually costs|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand nothing is really appealing|pg||
nt|athene: that basically has to say "i have a 4@C raise but with an extra heart"|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: (yes seen it :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: easy pass by milne|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos: seems slightly odd to bid 2@S   West is maximum (Precision) |pg||
nt|cascade: usually?|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have diamonds it's sort of good to emphasize hearts rather than clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely that 3 @H buys the pot |pg||
nt|athene: well, 3@H is as likely as 4@C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  with a passed partner, there was little reason for W to bid again unless it's a system requirement in which case they may wish to modify some parts of their system.|pg||
nt|athene: ok, "very often" costs|pg||
nt|cascade: certainly if you have something better to do|pg||
nt|cascade: here south's alteratives were also unattractive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, I would lead a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let declarer fiddle around with the side suits|pg||
nt|bebechira: this will end it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: i guess 4@C shuts out 3@S from south|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S usually show extra|pg||
nt|kemperg: and his distribution|pg||
nt|basu_4139: extra with shape too|pg||
nt|mamos: but how likely was game ?|pg||
nt|kemperg: E no interest on 43 fit with max 15pts in W|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|bebechira: 15-20 mins to go this session... and hey still have to play 25 as well|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cascade: how often are these trumps leads right Roland?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: @H position very favourable for EW|pg||
nt|mamos: if EW had ventured 4@H would they have pushed NS to 5@d?   I think so|pg||
nt|athene: very hard for south not to sacrifice with that hand once partner bids 3@D|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H 1@D 1@c to lose|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: I have no idea|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugrapha4: sorry i lost them|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Is there a prize for fast play?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they not playing with screens?|pg||

nt|woozle: He played 2DX in the qualifying with Axxxx opposite void, with KQJ98x sitting over him|pg||

mb|4D|nt|woozle: Higgins should figure out what 3H means|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: But he doesn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: The auction - hearts not raised, mean that his partner cannot have hearts shorter than about 5, so the 3H bid is nonsensical if not natural|pg||
nt|sybarra2: wll this is not worse contract in the world|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|woozle: 4D may make|pg||

nt|frankaus: white save V white game has very little margin 4 error IMO|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: east might as well play ace and another heart|pg||
nt|cascade: low still makes 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know|pg||
nt|athene: play her partner for @HKJ10x or a top spade|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  N unaware that 3N now is a laydown|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianmcc: looks like 9|pg||
nt|athene: with the @H9 in dummy you aren't getting a second heart - also your ace can be dropped anyway|pg||
nt|athene: or take the ace and shift to something|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: so sorry, lost them again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would you play a diamond at trick 2?|pg||
nt|cascade: trump was better |pg||
nt|Walddk2: She will hopefully make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|cascade: yes there is a small danger and trumps will not be a problem|pg||

nt|bebechira: last board here..|pg||
nt|bebechira: but we welcome them... and they should feel at home in melbourne|pg||
nt|frankaus: due to spingold and NZ national - many top players made themselves unavailable for interstate carnival selection|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bebechira: ths a lot to Teddy and Frank for helping us|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 6-10 nine cards in majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Cathy,  great job!   |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set. Many thanks to Cathy, excellent operating. |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: no worries, sorry i got lost on a few hands..|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Think they need to give us a high chair, can't really see the cards properly :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: also thanks to Wayne and Bill for commentary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play will resume after a short break|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Mike and Bill,  always fun to be with you guys |pg||

nt|bebechira: Thx Shirley,Mike and William...fantastic job|pg||
nt|bebechira: and many thanks to Kirsten...our operator...fantastic job|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: roland was saying in the morning that abf misstimed the event|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  2@c almost looks natureral and positive response to the strong @c|pg||
nt|vivienne: ty |pg||
nt|bebechira: we will be back in 10 mins with the 2nd set of the morning|pg||
nt|frankaus: very exciting hands|pg||

nt|sybarra: (I think that is later tonight for me) |pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: East will be happy to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: best west declaring|pg||
nt|athene: the spades lie nicely for declarer and the @H10 will be valuable too, but still there is too much work to do, too many aces to knock out|pg||
nt|bebechira: and the youth players are making them twice as exciting lol|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  S loves to bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: well ?|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would not volunteer 3@S, but I don't think I will ever be selected for the WA women's team|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  3@c probably a xfer|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|cascade: looks like a save against a likely 3NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: and thx to Kirstyn our operator..super job|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get some help you never know |pg||
nt|mamos: AS a frequent TD I'm sure players shouldnt get into time-trouble  but if you do you must take your punishment - and play properly  fines usually = one or two imps playing badly ...|pg||
nt|mamos: double figures|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  6@d only goes for 1100|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would pass as S now|pg||
nt|andyv:  operator, are we sure as to who is doing all the bidding?|pg||
nt|vivienne: bye|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: now if declarer leads the @SK, north should duck|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer gets only two spade tricks and only one entry to dummy |pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: so she can lead a club up only once and that is not enough|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mamos: next hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: open room starting last board now...so all well when ends well|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: of course north ducks this as well|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kemperg: 1 up|pg||
nt|ianmcc: claim|pg||
nt|mamos: the match is close with only thre boards or so to play in each room  -- but 5-6 comparisons|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will be back in 30 mins .....more or less lol|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  ok, we can assume the EW got to 6@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  operator, need to undo auction all the way back to 3@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW will be plus 1460|pg||
nt|ianmcc: what about set 1?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  operator, probably best to just put up score|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s9|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cascade: I am told 3NT made at one table and went off at the other table in the Open|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|bebechira: Laurie Kelso TD smiling.... so no problems with time|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: It takes some imagination to go down|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: a more controlled auction would have been 1@D X pass 1@H pass 1NT all pass|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c8|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot in the open room|pg||
