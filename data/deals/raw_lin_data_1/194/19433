nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|kareno: Good day from Las Vegas :)|pg||
nt|chick: Welcome everyone :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello from Italy :)|pg||
nt|psyck: "Sementa"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Yes, the name is Antonio Sementa|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W play a system very similar at Lauria-Versace|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello all|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Your commentators are Warren and CK|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks like a pretty straightforward 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: thanks Joe, we will remember that and 1 IMP could make a difference|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|psyck: The strong @c system may not work too well here allowing opps to possibly find a @d sacrifice|pg||
nt|kareno: I had the pleasure of losing to Versace and Lauria in a KO match earlier this week :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all   and welcome back to Toronto |pg||
mb|2S!|mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|psyck: N will be happy to hear 2@s by S|pg||
nt|kareno: The next KO fortunately we won so I can still show my face around here.  It was this exact team that defeated us.|pg||
nt|kareno: Did I say hello from Vegas?  I'm still in Toronto watching baseball games :)|pg||
nt|psyck: South has maximum for the earlier pass, no wastage in opps suit, & shape|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i hate the first pass... clearly worth a double|pg||
nt|bigtrain: now impossible to catch up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, assuming double was 5-7, it was certainly possible on 2@d|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree - now she hasn't got a good bid but 2@s will do.|pg||
nt|psyck: double or 2@H?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|bridge_one: depending on agreement|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|duschek: Hellp|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: Hello :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S is @C GF|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzfc: Quinn:  you better play the spots off of this one|pg||
nt|rv: technically West invites and East accepts with max|pg||
mc|12|nt|bridge_one: giving a medium hand|pg||
pg||

nt|rv: if East doesn't open, will you open 1@d or 1n with North hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: the director was here getting the auction from a board in the last set, where there was some sort of appeal in the other room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Sementa and Duboin started to play togheter few years ago, so they at Versace the system|pg||
nt|psyck: dec showed something in minors in the bidding & likely the @hA for the 3N bid, so likely to have nothing much in @s; so @s shift was possible to find maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: there are only few change, depending on style to play, but 88% is equal|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tarekr:  when I am short oM, i generally will bid a good 4 cd major in 3rd or 4th seat|pg||
nt|duschek: EW play a strong club showing 16+ or possibly 15 balanced. 1NT is 12-14 at all seats and vulnerabilities.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: 98%|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@C possible  but likely to play in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is limited at 9 hcp exclude 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: double?|pg||
nt|xenya: must be a specialised bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by North is aggressive in vuln|pg||
nt|psyck: even playing equal level conversion, it would not occur to me at this vul|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl give @H + a minor|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with sgl @s North think the partner can have @s and points, so he must bid anything|pg||
nt|xenya: if it shows the reds, S is not pleased|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tarekr:  shows 3 cd support|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psyck: S clearly expected more|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now depending on agreement - i suppose 2Nt was convetional for N/S in this auction|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: invite sequence it looks like|pg||
nt|psyck: 3NT will have better chances played by E|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4H|mb|5C|nt|psyck: no more tricks than the 5@d, & 2 aces in sight|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3N need a present by defence|pg||
nt|xenya: good defence will obviously beat this|pg||
nt|chick: clubs could be set up, but I think defense will get their major suits first|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, should set it 1 or 2 w/o much difficulty i think|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, with 11 decent HCP, Askgaard invites game opposite 12-14. This sequence is a standard Jacoby sequence; I believe that 2@S denied 4-card support|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: some wastage in diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: each bidding their weakness|pg||
nt|kareno: This looks like some sort of relay auction.  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s 2@H 1@C are ON for defence in all case|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but can make more tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Bill Jacobs in Australia|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Bill |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bill plays the same system as Fantunes, so we are well covered now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: anything from 11 to 13 tricks in clubs |pg||
nt|Walddk4: as Jacob knows the Danish system pretty well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, and I might learn something as well|pg||
nt|duschek: Bjarnarson decides on 3NT, based on the bad distribution and slow values|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a coded lead:  normal count from hands that include an honour|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: some might not show supp double with sub-min hand (11 hcp with Mildred)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: same auction in the other room to 3NT on 49, and they made an overtrick|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told 2@h was a gf|pg||
nt|psyck: if dec ducks 2 @h's, def may need to switch to @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  yes, it was played by East at the other table, so the defense has a good chance here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: Club slam requires picking up the suit.  Stiff king in either hand twice as likely as stiff jack in north.|pg||
nt|duschek: I have learnt a bit too much from Askgaard and Bjarnarson this year, losing 4-25 to them in the round-robin of this year's Danish championship, then by 80 imps in the semifinal|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bunch as we say |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The Norwegians were a little conservative in the closewd room and it is going to hurt them|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe I'm not meant to call them Norwegians ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Declarer has thumbed @H3 several times|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is assuming "we" make it here|pg||

nt|kareno: This IS Carolyn Lynch, isn't it?  Not Peter Lynch?|pg||
nt|kareno: Once the club ace drew the jack, that was the preferred line of play|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@c is limited as !@c is available with stronger hands|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rv: 3@d requires right @d guess here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C polish, so 10/15 5+ cards in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: One of the key aspects of the Fantunes system is that you have to open 1NT on many many many hands|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: This is one of them ... although he did have a 2@S opening as an option (in third seat)|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: What does 1NT show in their system?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: about 12-14, semi balanced|pg||
nt|sybarra: "any thing"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's opened with all 5332 shapes, and most of the 5422's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 12-14 announced|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now if you believe the rule of 11, you play the 7 here|pg||
nt|duschek: And he needs a lot of overtricks to match the 400 from the open room|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rv: plenty of wastage in rounded suits for E-W, after South's entry into auction, Quinn should get @ds right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: South fell in love with her hand.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many write me 2@C 11/14 - OK, but the concept is similar :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and there you are in dummy |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Cronier could have doubled 2@d to show @hs and @c tolerance (snapdragon double) which would have allowed Willard to compete in @hs|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  please do not complian that it is too  fast, whatever you do |pg||

mc|10|nt|yorkbeach:  yes not often that two five-level doubled contracts are both flat|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 5@c fit showing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I wonder how many people play fit-showing jumps at the 5 level|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  need to get the @D ruff to beat this|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yorkbeach:  interesting question - if 3@d is not FG, would pass from N be forcing?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is better|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here down finding the ruff in @D|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@D can be beat too, but that requires a @C lead|pg||
nt|bagman: This might be a double game swing for Cayne; a big win anyhow|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|yorkbeach:  if 5@c is explained as fit showing, finding the @d switch should be easy|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though looks like a misunderstanding on the @h signals. did South intend the 9 as suit preference?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C lead 5@D is ON with K sgl in @D in south|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: strange defence|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or maybe Nickell was not expecting his partner to have so many hearts|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 5@C North can read the sgl in @D in South - so, with A@C can try @D to give a ruff at the p|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do we know what explanation North had about 5@c?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: I don't think there was any alert for 5@C, and if it were fit showing, surely Sementa would not have passed it doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  did not like South's 3@d bid; unfortuantely we do not have the auction in the other room|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bagman: 3NT the best game here for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  cannot argue with that - 9 on top|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H value (3th suit)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now it's time for Nickel to slow down with 3NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|bridge_one: however are ON both 3N and 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  hard for Katz to bid 3NT with only @d10-x but perhaps should as his hand is so flat|pg||
nt|bagman: This makes because the @SA is onside|pg||
nt|stc: what I meant was that 5@D is never on as you said, I said 5@c...|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that NIckel should have bid 3NT; one of his teammate's rule|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with AK@D North could bid 3N - perhaps he was afraid to lose a slam in @C|pg||
mb|5D|nt|yorkbeach:  yes Nickell had to bid it|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|bagman: 3NT does not end all auctions even though there's a player who so suggests; with a good hand Katz can go on|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Nickell had very little extras as 2@c was FG|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|yorkbeach:  and had already shown 6@c with 3@c presumably|pg||
nt|bagman: Now they are unlikely to go plus|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe this is misduplicated and NIckell holds the @SA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we can see the result form the other room now, so hands appear to be correct|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 5@C difficult find the cards to play slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Katz's hand, which I can see, is as shown|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could 6@c make on a non-heart lead?|pg||
mb|p|mb|7C|nt|bagman: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: oh boy|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow|pg||
nt|bagman: THis makes against Ax xx AKx KQTxxx|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hey are veru strong players, and you can see a misunderstand - this happen anytime also at great players|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this auction looks like it went wrong when Nickell tried looking for a 6-2 @s fit with 3@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I think Nickell thinks spades is trumps|pg||
nt|warrens:  same result as 6@C.  against 6 they lead a @H, against 7 the A of @S.  though this could get doubled.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  even with a misunderstanding of what suit they have agreed, they have bid an awful lot with a minimum opening facing a minium 2 over 1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bagman: Looks like Sementa holds the @SA even though Nickell has bid like having it|pg||

nt|duschek: Still a successful sacrifice against the 5@S that was, or was not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: quite true ... the big problem was the other room|pg||
nt|casenjo:  nicely done|pg||
nt|psyck: we only missed some boring doubled games making overtricks or several undertricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Players are taking a short break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: we're going to enter some of the bidding from earlier boards, they have already been played, so this is just so you'll have the iinformation about the auctions|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I have to step out for 20 minutes ... will return.  Probably I'll only miss one hand!|pg||
nt|duschek: Apart from that, I agree with your point. If partner does not have long diamonds, he will retreat to hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: again looks like issue with other room |pg||
nt|casenjo:  And a tied match after 5 boards|pg||
nt|psyck: back to normal pace now|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|psyck: will likely pass i suppose|pg||
nt|kareno: Not a great suit but north wants to get into the auction in case west has only four hearts.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h is natural, hearts, for the specs asking.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, at this vul, worth getting into auction by N with good shape|pg||
nt|ady: easy 3NT|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chick: pretty ratty heart suit for this bid, even over something like Qxxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ady: this looks a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|kareno: South obviously thinks north has some sort of 5/5 takeout!!|pg||
nt|ady: fortunately  not too much grief|pg||
nt|kareno: So they are lucky and land on their feet.|pg||
nt|psyck: I suppose S was did not take it as Natural & N passed assuming misunderstanding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C polish, so 15/18|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rv: coffee deal here|pg||
nt|tarekr:  How about a Tea Party deal here:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead by Versace.|pg||
nt|psyck: there are several bids like 2@d, 1NT, Double to show other suits, so it is common to play 2@h as natural as the 1@h could come with weak hands & you are sitting above the suit|pg||
nt|duschek: 1@S is forcing to game, so West's pass is for takeout|pg||
nt|duschek: You might say that Monaco needed those 12 imps on the previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Tarek, same deals played in Spingold and Wagar?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no|pg||
nt|kit: so they have to open 2@C with 5+ clubs or lose the suit?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is forcing (after 1@S 7+)|pg||
nt|psyck: both 1@c & 2@c can have @c suits|pg||
nt|psyck: just that 2@c is limited, like prec|pg||
nt|kit: I mean with minimal opening|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many told me that 2@C is forcing in polish club - i amn't sure about this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s limited (of course) but dont means weak like in natural !|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like it is forcing, otherwise it would be pretty risky on that big a hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  I don't think so! anyone?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it is forcing -- to game in this sequence|pg||
nt|duschek: Askgaard can almost visualize short diamonds in East. He will not be that enthusiastic about his 16 HCP. They were fine when the auction started, but with the opponents bidding ...|pg||
nt|duschek: hearts, that doubleton @HKQ is not particularly wonderful|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|rv: thanks Joe|pg||
nt|rv: for latest Spingold R16 scores (after 3rd segment), please access the excellent new web-site http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-16 |pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: on @h lead, dec will give up a @s & if @sT does not come down, fall back on @c's|pg||
nt|psyck: @d may be lead though|pg||
nt|psyck: doubleton leads aren't often a good idea, but would have worked on previous deal|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bridge_one: 1@C 1@d , 2@C isn't forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@c 1M , 2@C is forcing (of course) bec 1M 7+|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: can E pass?  guess not|pg||
nt|ady: kib suggested 6@C   which could make without a heart lead|pg||
nt|ady: this looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: can safely play a spade towards king|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    tht south had won 1st trick   only 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: 1@C 1M 2@C 2@S isn't a strong hand, but i think forcing 1 because can hold 9 points !|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|duschek: No, 1@S is forcing to game, so if anybody should take a chance, West should be the one. After all, East has more or less denied 10 HCP, having passed initially.|pg||
nt|sybarra: so even as passed hand it is forcing to game,....interesting|pg||

pc|h7|nt|chick: Same for all 1minor P 1major ... bidding either of the opp's suit should be natural|pg||
nt|duschek: Well, almost forcing to game. West might show 15 balanced (or 16 bad), in which case I believe that EW can stop below game. I am not sure if they can show such a hand in this ...|pg||

nt|ady: looks like 6 imps for Cayne|pg||
nt|duschek: For 4@S to have any chance, South must have the @CK singleton now. Then declarer also needs the @DK with South, but that is hardly possible based on the 1@H overcall.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 20+ minutes behind on clock|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: It does not appear as if time clock pressure will speed anybody up here.|pg||
nt|duschek: As long as everybody agrees to play slowly, there is not much you can do in a knockout match|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Nunes just called director to notify about opponent's speed (lack of).|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphzfc: Askgaard agreed it was his side that is slow.|pg||
nt|duschek: They often are, it must be admitted|pg||

nt|bagman: Having made 2 heart tricks declarer switches to diamonds with time to make 3 tricks there to go with 2 aces for 7 sure tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: defending against 1N can be right to take with A@H at first trick and switch @C or @D second the call by the p (lavinthal over A @h)|pg||
nt|bagman: If Sementa fails to attack the clubs now, declarer can build 2 extra spade tricks for 2 overtricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Sementa can read 2@C in South|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa knows the red suit count; could W have KQxxx of spades?|pg||
nt|bagman: that would leave S 3 clubs and the spade switch would set up that suit for the defense|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: I like 3@h here though slightly risky|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: gives Cronier a a difficult problem|pg||
nt|rv: Cronier can't double with only doubleton @s, choices are to pass or bid 4n asking partner to pick minor|pg||
nt|psyck: no game makes, but someone will get to some game here likely|pg||
nt|kareno: Our Operator is new to the game and doing very well :)|pg||

nt|bridge_one: West could try 3@c, but vuln better to play 2@S not doubled - opener can have 6@S and xx in @C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: same auction in open room|pg||
nt|casenjo:  welcome back|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Nickell has chosen a tough lead for Cayne, a spade would have made it very easy|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe give up @cA, play low @s to J, get 3@s, 2@h, 2@d, 2@c tricks & lose 2@h, 1@s, 1@c|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I've been told that Mr. Hamman got a @S lead|pg||
nt|psyck: true, that would not trouble him|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Cayne has a lot of choices here. Must work out best %.  We can see all the cards.|pg||
nt|psyck: duck 1@h & start @c maybe|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Playing for 3-3 in either black suit; leading up to jack of spades, lead to 9@C and the slim chance of Kx@D onside|pg||
nt|casenjo:  All lead to the possible 9th trick, but which wins???|pg||
nt|casenjo:  easy when you see all the cards|pg||
nt|psyck: 1st knock out @cA, that is only sure communication in case @h's unfav|pg||
nt|psyck: also you may have 9 tricks without going to opps after knocking out @cA, if @c & @d or @s fav|pg||
nt|casenjo:  But one kibbitzer has pointed out that a club to the 9 is what he likes since "it virtually gets me home if it works with a lotta choices"|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Where is Michael Rosenberg when you need him? He knows ALL the % :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i think rosenberg would burst out laughing about @c to the 9 hi there|pg||
nt|psyck: dec may be thinking of winning 1st trick in hand & playing @c from hand|pg||

nt|psyck: *thought|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|rv: normally I play Texas transfers only with a jump, in my methods for quantitative hand I need to double 3@h and then invite, still good point by Tarek for partnerships to discuss|pg||

nt|xenya: how did it go down in OR|pg||
nt|psyck: operator likely missed the play|pg||
nt|psyck: listing the various shapes i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: lynch made a basic mistake, winning the @C opening lead with the J, then no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: dec must have lost track somewhere, all normal lines should make|pg||
nt|kit: club lead, declarer continued clubs, ruffed, diamond to queen and king, another club, and couldn't handle it after that apparently|pg||
nt|psyck: @d ruff entries were there still, could have made by playing @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@h is ON for sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but must call 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: with @hK & @sA well placed, dec will make in comfort here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Duboin can pass|pg||
nt|chick: bridge is a game of mistakes, she still makes fewer than I do :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3N is possible, yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i bet Duboin  first: pass, second 3N|pg||
nt|duschek: Here we have the 15 balanced included in the strong hand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck: not the beast lead other room...|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3-suiter short @D 10-15 or so...  might be 43 in majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: more notes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@h is very conservative by Sementa|pg||
nt|kit: West had difficult to evaluate -- he thinks king of spades worthless on auction.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree with Duboin pass|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psyck: best even, or should i say beastial lead|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt not the best contract either.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 5@c is comfy, but normal to end in 3N|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@s to show a stopper I guess here. |pg||
nt|psyck: they may just not see enough values or shape to be in 5 level & with a different arrangement of cards 3N may be superior|pg||
nt|chick: Will N figure that one is enough?|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, S needs to be declarer in NT to protect that K, so perhaps best to just bid it now|pg||
nt|kareno: Kt9 doesn't need much  protection.|pg||
nt|chick: (if she's going to try for it)|pg||
nt|kareno: Zmudzinski led the A of @h in the OR against 3nt - definitely NOT best.|pg||
nt|chick: It could happen here too, if she shows a spade stopper|pg||
nt|kareno: But they won't lead a heart if west doubles spades, I'm sure.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only chance is try 3N with K10xxx in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: getting to 4 @S is questiong here |pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: @d three times virtually beats this|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C = all minimums|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D asks again|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT 4414|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: West employed garbage stayman here, intending to pass any bid by partner|pg||
nt|kareno: So this WILL be a pickup for Cayne.|pg||
nt|duschek: Actually, I seem to recall that Askgaard has told me that 1@S is 100% forcing to game. It is true that they used to be able to show 15 balanced and then stop below game, but they ...|pg||
nt|duschek: have abandoned this possibility.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: point alerts, but no written ones|pg||
mb|4D|nt|tarekr:  exact. A good tool|pg||
nt|rv: such auctions normally cry for trump lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hi again|pg||
nt|sybarra: re|pg||
nt|duschek: Instead they try to have 8 good HCP at least for their positive responses, hoping that 15+8 will often equal to game when necessary|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@D transfers to 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 15+8 = game, hmm|pg||
nt|bjacobs: that's not the math they taught me at bridge school|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have the play the hand better Bill :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: quite so|pg||
nt|duschek: 1NT is a relay, 2NT shows 8-11 HCP with 6+@S and a 4-card minor. 3@C asks which one, and 3@D shows diamonds, the distribution not being a 6421 type|pg||
nt|duschek: Sorry, 3NT shows diamonds etc.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: N and E whispering, can't hear it.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, this should be a push|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: because it would need a direct @h 10 hook, which, this time, is clearly against the odds|pg||
nt|bigtrain: for a sign-off in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|duschek: So to sum up, West knows that East has 6+@S4@D, but not a 6421 type|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: If East's whispering is loud enough, North will know that too|pg||
nt|sybarra: again,  faster than a speeding bullet |pg||
nt|casenjo:  On  the last hand, Cayne made 4 on the line of 9@H-3@H-J@H-!A|pg||
nt|casenjo:  trick 2 K@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: doesn't want to make 11 tricks as not in 5@c?|pg||
nt|ady: spade best    but game a bit high|pg||
nt|ady: with QJ spades doubleton this will likely make|pg||
pc|s6|nt|casenjo:  On @H return Katz unblocked the !Q letting Cayne set up the 7@H|pg||
nt|psyck: cannot stop short of game once W openes anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|bigtrain: the trump lead may expose the position|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Avons-nous des spectateurs Francais?|pg||

nt|ady: as kib mentioned  got it played the right way    the other way  heart lead  down immediately|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|ritong: now, if defense delays the third @d, declarer can pitch on the second @s|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kareno: Always justify your bidding!|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s opennig minimized the losses there i guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: all players on a break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: E probably a little careless with second club play seemed momentarily unhappy with W pass|pg||
nt|kit: not careless -- just trying to make as many tricks as he can.  Why should he suspect 7-1 split?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: everyone in a good mood two very evenly matched teams|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, they were tied at end of 1st set & scores still close|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hoverwev i would bid dbl over 2@S two suit hand weak|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because with a 2 suit hand 3@H can be a big risk finding long @D at the partner|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and bec i have the force to bid 3@H over 3@C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: would be difficult to cope with 4-1 split   so should rise with king I think|pg||
nt|ady: not likely the lead was from QXX|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: considerately not allow pd to figure out you missed game|pg||
nt|ritong: and preserve his choice|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rv: now 2 down|pg||
nt|ady: QXXX more likely than QXX|pg||
nt|bigtrain: once this hurdle is crossed he then has to get hearts correct also|pg||
nt|ady: this might be a much needed change of fortune for Nickell   had to very bad losses recently|pg||

nt|casenjo:  Absolutely!!!! Mine will definately be unbiased commentary|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 1N or 1@S ?|pg||
nt|ady: should not stop e/w playing 4@S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: NT|pg||
nt|duschek: 8 boards in 90 minutes is not impressive. Or maybe it is.|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: 1N for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: 8 HCP forcing to game opposite what could be 15 balanced. This time Bjarnarson saves Bill the trouble of calculating 15+8 and comparing against bridge school requirements for game|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W seem to have missed a fairly easy slam in the OR|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bridge_one: all people told me 1N :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: mainly because no good rebid after 1@S |pg||

nt|poohbear: Would you dbl with the West hand Kit?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tarekr:  welcome back folks. The show is on!|pg||
nt|kit: much as I dislike opening 1NT with a 5-card major, this hand really does have notrump written on it.|pg||
nt|xenya: i believe they hardly ever open 1N with a 5-card major|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, thank you ... |pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: bonsoir:)|pg||
nt|rv: double of 3@h is negative|pg||
nt|rv: bonjour Henri|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Welcome Henri|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: 1@S is a relay - 2@D shows 8-11 HCP and precisely 5 hearts + 4 or 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  3@S red?|pg||
nt|psyck: experimental :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  bonsoir Henri|pg||
nt|chick: a nice comfortable game, even with a 4-1 split|pg||
nt|ritong: i m not sure the @h xxxx dictates such a move|pg||
pc|hA|nt|duschek: 2@H asks which minor, and 2@S shows exactly 4 clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: Probably would not double opposite passed hand -- downside greater than upside vul vs. not|pg||
nt|psyck: double is tempting, but for the vul|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C give the raise in @S (after passed hand) - so 3N by N is perfect|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The OR auction makes a point that is quite well known in the expert world|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: playing matchpoints, would be an other story, and even so|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I'm not sure I want a spade lead|pg||
nt|psyck: even mp, it's a defensive & not offensive hand, at wrong vul|pg||
nt|psyck: Sementa upgraded his hand to an NT opening in 3rd seat last deal for a push|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|duschek: 2NT=relay, 3@C=2524|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is that a 2@C overcall of a natural 1@D opening is a powerful weapon|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: seamon would have bid 4@h anyways|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Well, I'm glad to be back.........;)|pg||
nt|psyck: we'd be gladder if the table did not keep flickering in & out of vision though|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Probably WiFi Bruce ????|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so|pg||
nt|casenjo:  You're doing great under the circumstance|pg||
nt|ritong: internet is pure magic, but sometimes a bit fragile|pg||
nt|ritong: our operator understandably lost track, especially with seamon who is faster than a rocket  let s wait for the claim|pg||
nt|warrens:  certainly can make this, but the handling isn't so easy.  ducking a @D, planning to take 1@S, 1@D, 2@C's + 6 trumps seems reasonable|pg||
nt|psyck: connections have generally been fine this Spingold so far|pg||
nt|ritong: hello warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi Henri. had to step out for a couple minutes, but with you all now.|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  I would like to know how he played this|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I do not know who to root for!!! Having dinner with Michael Seamon next week and visiting Ralph and Martha Katz in Chicago Aug. 12th.... oh my!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: Willard had a tough problem on 3@h, ideally she would have liked 4th @s or hcp or 2 more for negative double at this level|pg||
nt|warrens:  root for good bridge and an exciting finish|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West felt he didn't have enough for 2@H, and so the easy slam was lost|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|duschek: 3@D=relay, 3@S=0 aces (of 4)|pg||
nt|duschek: Tough for Bjarnarson now - should he continue relaying with 4@C, or bid 4@D to invite slam in hearts and let partner in on the conversation?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yawn..... |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: disconnect, missed nothing.|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if they will finish all the hands in the set|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: I'm sure they will.  The question is more what day (or week) that will occur|pg||
nt|duschek: So relaying, 4@D=1 king|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rv: trump promotion with still a @c to come even if declarer ruffs with @SJ and draws trumps here|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he knows that if partner has the KQ of @H, slam is laydown on 2-2 trump or 3-3 @D or the J of @D with W or falling doubleton.  I think that's enough to go |pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh yes, this will be bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  so, he can just ask in trump|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: system so complex, they might not be able to use Josephine|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: It is worth noting that 4@S is not cold if defense goes passively.|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well just bid it!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|duschek: He should probably have bid 4NT to ask partner which king he held - this contract might be very silly if West held a different king|pg||
nt|duschek: Or 5@H as the naturalists suggest|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems to me that Helgemo - Helness are having a truly awful set in the OR ... they are about down 40 imps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's not an automatic make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The slam is around 75% on a spade lead (you have to refuse the finesse).  On a non-spade lead, it increases to about 88%|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Sorry, BBO system got tired of waiting, took a short break :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Reds or blacks?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how many lead for jxxx? but maybe this auction permits you to do so |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think all 4 suits are possible opening leads|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so will make no attempt to predict|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As I said in the other room, they have promised to finish this set before noon European time, in about 8 hours|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they have another set tonight?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Really?  I can't see Fantunes making such a rash promise|pg||
nt|duschek: EW play naturalish initial responses to 1@C. This means that relay sequences often reveal declarer's hand. There are versions of this system trying to avoid that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, that has to be a serious weakness|pg||
nt|bjacobs: With relay auctions, it's pretty important to make the relayer declarer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: wherever possible|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, West should not be allowed to bid a 5c major over 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe reverse them?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: many do|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H = spades, 1@S = hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fantoni is going to give his lead full consideration.  I just hope he knows it IS his lead|pg||
nt|duschek: Their relay sequences are according to Grøtheim's original book on the system - for some reason they have decided not to change that, although most other Danish pairs using this ...|pg||
nt|duschek: system switch the major suits in one way or the other|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's very hard to comment on the lead, because we don't know what Nunes' double meant|pg||
nt|duschek: Another popular choice is 1@H=@S, 1@S=balanced, 1NT=hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Does Fulvio know he is on lead is the question|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is we dont see a black suit lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: commitment, Shirley ... well done|pg||

pc|d4|nt|psyck: indeed, 3@s would not occur to most :)|pg||

nt|ady: might have got 500 out of 1NTX?|pg||
mc|8|nt|rv: I am surprised Von Arnim climbed up to 5@h in the deal where Willard-Cronier had misunderstanding to play in 4n, lucky she was not doubled|pg||
nt|tarekr:  sandwich is on the vane I believe.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Cronier closed screen and asked for a review of the auction, but was told it is too late|pg||
nt|rv: normally you lose less if both sides of partnership have bad result on same deal, IMP scale is such|pg||
nt|psyck: it has to be a suit also, cannot risk x otherwise|pg||

pc|s3|nt|psyck: with very poor @s's, my preference would be for 2@d or 2@h|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ritong: sylvie considers her hand as balanced, more precisely 3 of a minor would show seven cards, basically|pg||

pc|h2|nt|rv: on likely @s lead or shift, 10 tricks here|pg||

nt|duschek: Well, if EW believe that 15+8 produce game, NS might believe the same for 12+11|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: S won @CA, and returened @D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bridge_one: not more that 8 tricks for declarer - the defence is obvious|pg||
nt|kit: playing a club not safe now, as defence could cash winners and promote a trump trick if West has the queen|pg||
nt|ritong: and east 4:@s|pg||
nt|kit: or if East has 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, to promote the Q 4@S must be in east :)|pg||
nt|ritong: @ds a natural chance, yes, so declarer has to draw trumps without informations|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: I think 2@D is safest ... if partner can't stand it, then he has somewhere else to go|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|psyck: yes 2@d most normal, 2@h could lead pd to expect 4 with you|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Same total, 23.  And this deal just goes to show that 23 is usually not enough.  Even with the heart finesse on, and spades as friendly as can be|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Sorry, system froze after bidding on 41|pg||

nt|bigtrain: sometimes even meck has a max|pg||
nt|psyck: then surely won't get to slam|pg||
nt|bigtrain: roddy will stayman and show slam interest with short @C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll go out on a limb...|pg||
nt|reisig: Don't fall - Walter :0|pg||
nt|psyck: Walter knows their system better than they do, so i'd bet on him :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: stayman-f-3@H for eric|pg||
nt|bigtrain: leading to RKC and then a sign-off|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but just a guess :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: got to keep the audience interested :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: goddammit|pg||
nt|ritong: nickell's hand certainly deserves an overcall, but which one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: In Ghestem, cue shows top 2 suits, 2N bottom two, & 3@c top & bottom suits|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rv: ty Henri, Tarek can add this info to his encyclopedia if it is not already there:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: what is their 2@C opening?|pg||
nt|chick: as long as the defense doesn't lead hearts :)|pg||
nt|ritong: extremely|pg||
nt|psyck: possible to make, calling is the tough part|pg||
nt|duschek: We can learn a lot from watching these guys. They can too.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: back to remedial school for me, apparently|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Helgemo bid 4@S (after a takeout double):  the pressure bid, but technically a violation of the Law ... and he was justly punished|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: yes, they tend to do that when you least expect it, nasty people|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This 3@H bid, whatever it means, is legal, and probably successful|pg||
nt|duschek: I am not sure about the EW methods, but there should definitely be a bid available for showing a "Bergen 6-9" raise of spades. Perhaps that's 3@H.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Whatever your methods, Bergen, or any other, the point is this:  with a weak hand and 4 card support, you take yourself to the 3 level|pg||
nt|duschek: Agree|pg||
nt|casenjo:  lots of the top players are now playing systems where 2 suiters are known, this works for both Michael's Cue Bids and Unusual NT|pg||
nt|psyck: it is arguably superior to Michaels as you get to show specific suits|pg||
nt|ady: another big swing for cayne  on hand 27   4@S X  plus 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ritong: semi forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@s is XL, 2@d is XXL|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Over Major opener: 1M-2M = Other Major and Clubs; 1M-3@C = Other Major and DIamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: 5N like Zia bid other room, will now ask to pick a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 2@c*|pg||
nt|tarekr:  fg to 2Nt or 3 of a major Henri?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and being red,  doubt fluvio can come back in |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Spec suggests that at this vulnerability, 4@S is the right choice, but I don't agree.  The vul only changes the size of your minus swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i think responder can pass 2@c 2@d 2M|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h is support stronger that 3@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S is sufficient 13 hcp unbalanced|pg||
nt|psyck: actually, Ghestem is slightly different, though there are many variations i guess. http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Ghestem.html|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no slam try :)|pg||
nt|psyck: no 3@h :(|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: the "do something smart" X,    |pg||
nt|psyck: so cue is top & bottom & not as i mentioned|pg||
pc|c4|nt|duschek: Yes, that amounts to saying that the opponents will always make game at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|reisig: Where's that limb?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tarekr:  OK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nunes has a counter to it ... he asks Fantoni to "do something smart"|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: a reminder that our BBO score if off by one; Westheimer has one fewer IMP than shown|pg||
nt|ritong: regarding albarran, his carreer ended in the 50's, he started in 1935 to participate to world events|pg||
nt|rv: this lead should help declarer here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A sensitive auction by N/S, but they will struggle to make 4@D|pg||
nt|duschek: Of course, game may make, in which case 4@S will work out fine, but it is certainly not guaranteed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But a raise to the 3-level doesn't stop PARTNER from trying 4@S|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|chick: not sure I approve of setting up the @SJ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: so his convention must have seen the light in 1940 or so|pg||
nt|ritong: how would you tackle @ds? ace first?|pg||
mc|11|nt|duschek: Right - West should show his hand type, and East should make the final decision.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really important "bread and butter" competitive hand.  Much more instructive than those 23+8 things :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@C by Duboin isn't cue - means only 4cards in @S|pg||

nt|xenya: 10 or 11?|pg||
nt|duschek: And of course interesting play too|pg||
nt|psyck: yes A 1st is the safety play in @d|pg||
nt|ady: maybe nickell will gain some pts this way|pg||
nt|ady: 39 imps 3 recent hands for Cayne|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ritong: katz' hand is worth a mild try|pg||
nt|casenjo:  So, Cayne picks up 2 more for a 9 IMP lead in a very low scoring 1st quarter|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 10 confirmed|pg||
nt|duschek: West must bid 2@D, as 2@H would be non-forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see how they proceed to show that|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: Transfer perhaps.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: @d lead would scuttle both 3n and 4@s|pg||
nt|duschek: Actually, with a minimum hand, 2@C denies four diamonds. 3@C shows a minimum hand with a club single-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  I think that playing only 4 in such an event is wearing even on the best of them!|pg||
nt|chick: 1@H shows spades over a 1@C opening ... the 2@S bid shows 5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2N raise of course|pg||
nt|ritong: that way|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This could be the 'flat hand slam try'|pg||
nt|bigtrain: should be an interesting evening anyway :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|duschek: If Askgaard asks for distribution with 3@D, I wonder which lie Bjarnarson will prefer|pg||
nt|duschek: The system bid would be for Bjarnarson to open 1@D, but one can imagine why he hated that|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit weird, but..|pg||
nt|casenjo:  hard to believe it is Gerber, and it certainly doesn't look like a splinter|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfc: passing French mints around the table|pg||
pc|hT|nt|duschek: 3@H would show any 6322, 3@S shows any 6331, and anything else would have shown at least 7 clubs|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfc: the atmosphere here has been very pleasant in this set|pg||
nt|psyck: non @h lead, had chances for 12 the way the minors are placed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rv: technically low @d lead is right lead with no semblance of entry in Cronier's hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they are good (the mints)|pg||
nt|ritong: grr|pg||
nt|ritong: slam is awful, to say the least both rooms did well to avoid it|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno: Good practical bid by Mike Passell.|pg||
nt|duschek: So he reasonably decided to show the hand as 3136, which is confirmed by 4@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Which leaves West in a tricky position|pg||
nt|warrens:  was that a balanced try or a fake splinter?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h2|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Didn't like the singleton heart longer spades ... I can understand why they have missed this slam|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: Have to credit H-H here ... this is a hand where you can know too much, and talk yourself out of slam|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: maybe West needed to break out of relays to set @C for slam investigation|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|chick: I don't like the 2N bid myself ... void in partner's suit leads to exactly this kind of problem, no entry to use them|pg||
nt|kareno: Looking for doubleton T or Q or 3/3 clubs.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfc: director here encouraging faster play|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Ah les gourmandises francaises! Joe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: distribution wasn't the key  for how high  just @C vs @H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bjacobs: Well, yes, West woiuld have liked to know if East controlled spades|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|chick: fortunately, he has enough tricks in his own hand this time|pg||
nt|kareno: He can make this out of his hand.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: But, it looks like Helgemo didn't know either ... he just punted|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|hJ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|duschek: East had two options for getting into a cooperative auction, either 4@C after 3@C, or 4@D after 3@S, which would also agree clubs as trumps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: since the hearts were so friendly|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d7|pc|cT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ady: at last a plus for Nickedll|pg||
nt|ady: Nickell|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: director called now since Jimmy played AJ6 of spades and W claimed last two tricks for down one Jimmy is stating that he didnt do that and claimed two|pg||

nt|psyck: i knew we'd get exciting hands soon|pg||
nt|duschek: Sorry, West had...|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I don't know, but of the possibilities seems like a balanced try to me, But when I have the next 2 cuebids in my hand, what can partner bid???|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Doesn't make much sense|pg||
nt|ritong: well, either 4@c is a try or it s not|pg||

nt|bigtrain: looks like they ruled -1|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ritong: no comment:)|pg||
nt|tarekr:  my vote!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 13 clubs or diamonds|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: reduce that to three and you get mine|pg||
nt|rv: yes in my view as well, both pairs might even be in top 3 in my book:)|pg||
nt|ritong: particularly auken/von arnim|pg||
nt|psyck: a tad more tricks in @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3N can be hard to make|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|chick: oops, only 7@D, not 7@C, sorry|pg||
nt|kareno: Likely to play in diamonds but the pressure is on with the spade suit.|pg||
nt|psyck: the typical problem with strong @c system, at 5 level you have to start bidding suits for 1st time|pg||
nt|chick: a couple of kibs are pointing out that there is a squeeze for 7C as well|pg||
nt|kareno: Right you are.  See you all later - have to run!!  Thanks to all :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|tarekr:  if in 3 naturally in 5 LOL|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, the @sT is a nice card to have in 7N|pg||
nt|ritong: for the record, some play 1NT 2@h 2@s 4@s as a mild try  i do, and so does cayne, for example|pg||
nt|casenjo:  me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: So 13 imps for Monaco, and the match is close once more|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: you get the drift|pg||
nt|chick: first they have to get past the 5 level :)|pg||
nt|xenya: on the @SQ lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good lead - many lead 5@S with that figure|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: yes, danger defense gets 2 spades 1 club, 1 diamond, 1 heart before declarer has 9|pg||
mb|3C|nt|duschek: A simple auction after a weak NT (12-14) this time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some Q3 scores posted  Iceland lead over Fleisher down to 9  [was 42 at half]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-8|pg||
nt|ritong: the idea behind this is that 2@h is an "unuseful" bid, considering that playing from the strong hand is clearly overrated|pg||
nt|warrens:  hmm, is 4@C here natural or Gerber?|pg||
nt|warrens:  sounds natural to me|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, it is a common treatment with 4 level transfers used for hands with no slam interest|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when responder has no slam intentions, he simply bids 1NT 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: i'd take this as natural too|pg||
nt|psyck: N has a very good hand for the bidding so far|pg||
nt|psyck: a passive trump lead will defeat 4@h here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Henri likes dramatic effect as you would expect an artisitic frenchman:)|pg||
nt|chick: moot now :(|pg||
nt|xenya: very good, yes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: why thank you:)|pg||
nt|tarekr:  We must not forget Deas-Palmer|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Betting that @H2 is suit preference|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: now jack of spades continuation is winner, but is it so obvious?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yep, and now this contract is under some pressure|pg||
nt|psyck: not sure what would be best continuation though|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: having A 10  and A J out correct the lead with Q|pg||
nt|warrens:  for the Kibs asking, 3NT by N showed extras, either 15-17 or 16-17|pg||
nt|psyck: surely could temporize with a cue|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Zia bid 3@D over 2@C which gave North a picture of tricks available, allowing him to proceed to 7NT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 4+ forcing, might have longer minor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the rest is natural|pg||
nt|ady: seems only spade lead gives 10th trick|pg||
nt|psyck: there are endplays possible on @d lead |pg||
nt|psyck: or @c lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT shows @C but MIGHT be 2533|pg||
nt|bigtrain: so 3@C is a raise|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: North has to win this and play a spade I believe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@D @S beat|pg||
nt|xenya: should be obvious after S's @S7 -- middle card from 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 4@D is @C blackwood|pg||
nt|bigtrain: wonder if roddy is thinking about passing|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell might put meckstroth with a small singleton heart and @SQ in which case 6@C is conceivable|pg||
nt|athene: or if he has a fifth club...|pg||
nt|reisig: Glad I'm at home :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: when roddy bid 1NT he could have had 4@H and 6@C even|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt suggests meckstroth has some of his 5-7 points wasted in diamonds though, so slam really needs a perfecto|pg||
nt|ady: might make 4@H   if north is put in with 3rd round of hearts and 1 club is played earlier|pg||
nt|athene: you can make 4@H by endplaying south in the black suits, i would have thought|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: N knows S has the 9|pg||
nt|kit: Accurate defense no play now I don't believe|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer had won the first spade and gone after the red aces, the spade suit would have been blocked.  Should he have found that?|pg||
nt|xenya: also, as a few kibitzers have pointed out to me, declarer would have never ducked 1st spade wth AK9  |pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps he should "find it" as the best chance to make|pg||
nt|kit: But defense can counter I believe -- South unblocking 7 and 9 of spades|pg||
nt|kit: Well, maybe not -- then declarer ducks second spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: now has to pen spades  or play king of diamonds in which case south can be squeezed for 10th trick|pg||
nt|psyck: on @h lead, N may have to unblock @hQ to defeat|pg||
nt|reisig: Great Pass|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: this is tricky hand to play, crucial @d9 might bail out declarer here|pg||
nt|athene: or you could try cashing one club and @DA and putting north in with the trump, and when he leads the @DK just throw your little club|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ritong: and some other american associations, yes  plus d ovidio and her part|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: now he is endplayed for sure|pg||
nt|psyck: now several endplay options|pg||
nt|ady: has to take 1 round of clubs before 3rd heart and also A@D   and put in north hopefully|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rv: best defense was @s back here|pg||
nt|ady: club gone anyway|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|tarekr:  I think there are at least ten outstanding women's pairs in the world. Hard to rank them|pg||
nt|ritong: right|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, a good bid by Zia.  missed an excellent grand, since 3-2 @D's or picking up clubs makes 7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think when partner leads an ace, and dummy tracks with a singleton, suit preference should be the key signal: not count or attitude|pg||
nt|tarekr:  A small come back for Monaco! This match should remain a nail biter|pg||
nt|athene: north might find the @HQ unblock, giving his partner a diamond exit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|duschek: It is not that clear. When you have no suit to signal for, you might wish you could just encourage|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: she could have postponed second @d since partner is unlikely to cash more than 2 tricks and doesn't have an entry to set-up and enjoy|pg||
nt|ritong: also, any sport is also a matter of form|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|psyck: he will have to find it now, else can make|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: played normal spade to the king   rather than some miracle|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jbgood: most experts prefer suit pref I guess|pg||

nt|rv: based on scores in last 3 brds, can't see too much opportunity for trailing team to recover IMPs|pg||
nt|chick: That hand has potential for a big swing|pg||
nt|psyck: kibs point out there cards wrong for squeeze|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and you should just have a simple agreement: suit preference, and damn the torpedoes|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, it is hard to show more than one thing at a time when you only have two or three cards to choose from|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - it is either or, cant have it both ways|pg||
nt|warrens:  and we're right back to a virtual tie|pg||
nt|ady: is this serious|pg||
mb|p|nt|tarekr:  2 more folks! We witnessed a certainly enjoyable contest!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|rv: Joe, as per correct scores,Wesheimer trailing only by 16 rite?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no 18|pg||
nt|rv: 1 less?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  143-125|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: right|pg||
nt|ritong: not an everyday's auction|pg||
nt|rv: ok, this could end contest|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Westheimer has 1 fewer IMP than we are showing|pg||
nt|chick: yes, some pointed that out to me as well, the entries were not good enough|pg||
nt|duschek: So 4 more for Monaco, closing in indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: entries would be fine on a minor suit lead though|pg||
nt|kit: Many pairs play this 2@H call as natural.  Either could work on any hand, but you better have solid agreements.|pg||
mb|d|nt|tarekr:  Al mentions that the last set of this match was schedule to start ten minutes ago :)|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a misunderstanding over the double in the other room|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X = 1 minor or both majors|pg||
nt|ady: double shows majors after passing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: mrs breed might get disappointed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Quinn says "it's a first time auction for me, too"|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rv: Mildred could have checked for aces though it is best not to comment about Quinn's pre-empt |pg||
nt|ritong: well..|pg||
nt|ritong:  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Mildredwas hoping for the spade ace, obviously|pg||
nt|psyck: still, NS can be happy that they only missed 7@d not 7N|pg||
nt|psyck: there was a confusion last set on this seq|pg||
nt|ritong: any move would lead to 4@h imo|pg||
nt|athene: you would think people ought to have that double sorted out - that is not exactly a wildly exotic auction|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: 3@H i suppose inviting in @S|pg||
nt|kit: If there is confusion here, E-W will be getting a very bad result in 3@H doubled|pg||
nt|duschek: 1ut=15-19, but could be a 4441 type of hand, though a balanced hand is of course much more likely|pg||
mb|2H|nt|duschek: 1NT=15-19, in case there are any English-speaking around|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Helgemo went 3 down in 1NT?   What is he, some sort of beginner?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|chick: There are plenty of other bids to show the other two suits, a cue is not needed, so it only makes sense to keep it natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: pass by sementa instead 3@S becames GF|pg||
nt|bridge_one: mixed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psyck: on non @s or @h lead, there would have been a criss cross squeeze for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: well, the OR stopped in 5@D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: stronger would bid a cue |pg||
nt|ady: north entering after limit bid     they play a 4-3 fit  instead of opps|pg||
nt|athene: north obviously thought the double meant clubs|pg||
nt|reisig: Wouldn't you?|pg||
nt|athene: i think it should be takeout of clubs, actually|pg||
pc|h7|nt|casenjo:  this should have a good play after the club lead, Henri correct again|pg||
nt|ritong: but will not be enough|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: two unavoidable @ss, plus a @d and a trump|pg||
nt|athene: since 2@C is pass or correct|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: the opponents might be about to let the auction die in 2@C so you are in the pre-balancing seat|pg||
nt|bigtrain: in my experience most play it shows clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't double 2@C with that south hand whatever |pg||
pc|c3|nt|casenjo:  J@S now will do it|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: there will be a silence after that one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another suit preference|pg||
nt|warrens:  this was all over after a @D lead, but now he's got a chance|pg||
nt|casenjo:  for sure|pg||
nt|warrens:  but in the end I think the defense will still prevail|pg||
nt|casenjo:  ah, but there is the dreaded 9 of @S|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: Nickell quite aggresive today, with the 3@s in deal 10 & the 2@h here|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: maybe not|pg||
nt|warrens:  Helgemo found out that S had 4 black cards and finessed the 10 of @D's.  in the endgame, he was squeeze-endplayed.  it was terrific defense with reasonable choices by declarer.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If West reads @D6 as an honest high card, he will make ... but is Nunes entirely trustworthy?|pg||
nt|duschek: Helgemo used the club entry for a diamond finesse, which is odds-on, a least a priori|pg||
nt|athene: it should either be clubs, in which case my clubs are not good enough, or takeout of clubs, in which case my clubs are too good|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|ady: all seemed a little busy on this hand  exvept east|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: he does not hit good flops so far|pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, each costing 5-6 imps|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: south obviously thought it just showed "values", which is playable IFF you discuss your subsequent actions|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tarekr:  One must laugh rather than cry when the 2@s card hit|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|warrens:  now I expect declarer to endplay N|pg||
nt|duschek: Yes, North will have a hard time finding discards on the diamonds|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Soon or later. Later rather than soon :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll pitch one @C and one @H, then 3 rounds of @C's and he's dead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That 4th round of diamonds is a killer for North ... he will have to pitch a card he wants to keep|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|ady: looks around 200 as in OR|pg||
nt|athene: i have to say i am surprised there was a misunderstanding with double in both rooms|pg||
nt|ady: 300|pg||
nt|athene: i mean, opps balancing your 1nt with some artificial bid is hardly diabolical germ warfare|pg||
nt|athene: it really shouldn't knock you off the rails so easily|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzfc: Quinn apologizes for her undisciplined 2@S;  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: He still has to guess who has @HA?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|duschek: So 6 imps for Bjarnarson - many exciting swings in this set, large and small|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d7|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s8|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|duschek: Strike my last remark...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Funny, the endplay only works if North has @HA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|warrens:  ok, just 3 imps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If South has it, declarer has set up 7 tricks for N/S by "endplaying" North|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4 spades, 1 club, 1 heart and the long diamond with South|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Board 16 removed|pg||
nt|duschek: OK - thanks for watching and commenting everybody, kibs included|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3 IMPS to NS|pg||

mb|d|mb|3D|nt|bagman: Nickell is famous for huge come backs; being down 40 is just another day in the office|pg||

nt|ritong: uh?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: jimmy boy, you need a break|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rv: that could be only consolation for Westheimer though it might be too little too late for second seeds here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in the OR East scored 2@h ruffs and then his last trump on an overruff|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chick: This is the last board of this set, the remaining two sets will be played tonight|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks all|pg||
nt|kit: I'm really surprised by West's pass over 2@C with a singleton club and some other good features.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now dbl by east i suppose (opener can have 4@S)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: west would nid 2@H woth a top honor in @H - with xxx vuln pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: can't see a way back for Westheimer|pg||
nt|kit: Now he has to guess at the 3-level|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by sementa conservative|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@d now is a risk - probably pass by West|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: what else can he do?  No reason to expect to make 3 of anything, king of clubs bad, etc.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Mildred congratulates the French ladies and says they played well.  |pg||
nt|bridge_one:  ip refere 3D at dbl with 5 good @D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you might recall that Meckstroth led the @h2 when he gave Rodwell a ruff - they play reverse suit prefr|pg||
nt|athene: somewhat ugly 2nt bid; will warn meckstroth off now i guess|pg||
nt|ady: see if e/w can stay out of game|pg||
nt|athene: i mean warn him off compared with the other room|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, reverse count/att/sp|pg||
nt|athene: if rodwell is thinking that must mean he is contemplating 4@H? since 3@H is his only other option?|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe there are more points in the deck this room than other room|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there were a lot in the other room :)|pg||
nt|athene: singleton in partner's second suit is not really such a huge asset unless you have a lot of trumps|pg||
nt|athene: the bidding suggests meckstroth is short in spades rather than clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so how much has rodwell got, exactly?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: I suspect German ladies will play in 4@h in CR on last deal and defense of @s ruff followed by @d shift unlikely to be found|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: The internet router is in the open room, so the wifi connection in our closed room has not been as good|pg||
nt|athene: of course, he will be very conscious of the fact that he has THREE-card support, which he won't usually have here|pg||
nt|ady: if west had A@D  instrad of KJ   might well make 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tarekr:  I think they are going to sing the Marseillaise in the french bridge lands.|pg||
nt|xenya: good heavens|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|kit: So Duboin had choice of defending 3@C or playing 4@S.  Something seems wrong here.|pg||
nt|psyck: E forgot that W did not x 2@c|pg||
nt|xenya: can be made on this lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  4@H or 5@C here, but 3nt depends on the lead|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@d is prolly game forcing|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This one will end the 1st quarter of a close and exciting match.  Hope to see all back!|pg||
nt|warrens:  either a @D lead or a high @S and a @D shift to beat this|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@D definitely GF |pg||
nt|ritong: not sure why nickell opted for that with a 2@c inviting available|pg||
nt|psyck: last deal, thanks all, next set in about 2.5 hours|pg||
pc|c9|nt|casenjo:  Thanks to Warren, Henri, and Krishna!|pg||
nt|warrens:  that lead should make for a quick -1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ought to play the @DQ here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rv: yes, French pair played at a very high level|pg||
nt|kit: Can this make?  5 spades, 1 heart, 1 club, 3 diamonds?  Doesn't seem likely without knowing about the diamond layout.|pg||
nt|chick: falsecard by Sementa may cause a bit of problem|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this time i understood nothing about the pass by East|pg||
nt|kit: What could East have sensibly bid?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 10 points and 4@s dbl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: without dbl i, in west, i would reopen 3@D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chick: assuming the same contract at the other table, we end the first quarter today essentially tied|pg||
nt|chick: many would play a double of 2@C as showing spades|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: thx all   |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|ritong: you re late, walter:) see yopu next segment?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck: Thanks all. Next set imn about 20 mins|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|chick: Two very strong teams, fun to watch|pg||
nt|chick: apparently he wasn't able to do that|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right, can't use dbl to give 4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl at 2@C means strong hand|pg||
nt|psyck: well, most play is as supp x, but for this pair is would show @s with better than min hand|pg||
nt|kit: I guess he can take the needed tricks -- ace of diamonds, diamond ruff, etc.  5 trumps, 3 diamonds, 1 club, 1 heart.|pg||
nt|psyck: so 4@s was punishing pd's balance, may get lucky though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no - i think sementa decide to play 3@C with balanced hand at the partner|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West could reopen only with unblanced hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is the reason of pass at 3 @C and after 4@s|pg||
nt|kit: yes, he could work out West's shape for sure|pg||
nt|xenya: so the whole thing was not as crazy as it looked, after all|pg||
nt|kit: But you would think South should have also worked it out and not led the ace of clubs.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the reasoning of sementa is: if i don't have game i play 3@C - if my p is unbalanced with 4@S he must reopen - so better pass that dbl at 3@C, becasue with dbl i can''t know if my ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: p have 11 balanced or 14 unbalaced|pg||
nt|xenya: cute|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rv: big thanks to excellent Vugraph operator Joe and my wonderful co-commentators Henri and Tarek|pg||
