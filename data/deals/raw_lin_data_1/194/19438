nt|henryb:  Will Fantoni correct back to 3@d?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher 1N tends to deny 3@S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: i'd be more positive with no overcall from south|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bjacobs: and there's the third step.  Now it's up to Fantoni to read diamonds as the spot|pg||

nt|bjacobs: North can read South as having 2 more diamonds than hearts in this sequence.  Hence the pass of 3@D, playing in the long suit.  Not everyone would get this right|pg||

nt|ahollan1: bill -- as someone who plays the system -- should opp treat 1@C as natural or as a big club??   i.e. should Fleisher overcall 1N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so Sorin can't and should not do anything about that|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|Walddk2: He asked them 3 times|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: May be I've done a mistake during the play...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Al I can tell you right now that the strong balanced hand is much more frequent than the natural club hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S 0-11 HCP|pg||
nt|bjacobs: However, I'm not convinced you should play your big club defence to it|pg||
nt|henryb:  okay. I hope Fleisher does not lose by 1 or tie|pg||
mb|1S|an| |nt|bjacobs: South has a marginal hand at this point.  He can (I think) bid either 2@S weak (0-6) or 2@C showing some strength and short clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@S showed 4 spades or about 23+ points balanced|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: However, East has got in South's way, so now he has an entirely different problem|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't know what Fantunes' methods are here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok  Bill plays  His Version  of  Fantunes system |pg||
mb|d|an|shortness 0-2|nt|bjacobs: It's possible that the double substitutes for the 2@C shortness bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's how my partnership plays it, but there is no definitive statement anywhere of this level of detail into Fantunes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: all other tables played 3@S   on time or +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well done Bill!!|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So here we see the edge in the 2-way 1@C bid ... East had no idea whether North had clubs, and so came in with a fairly doubtful delayed overcall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you vote for  immediate 1N overcall?|pg||
nt|henryb:  and a fairly doutful sit of the double|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I think that East should probably have come in directly, non vulnerable, with a fairly descriptive 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  act immediately or forever hold your peace|pg||
nt|bjacobs: that sort of principle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then it's a question of wheter east or west gets to show his Major|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wonder if Fulvio will find that double dummy @C8 here ... it's vaguely possible, looking at stiff @C7 in dummy|pg||
