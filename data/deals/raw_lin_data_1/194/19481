mb|p|nt|Walddk4: and Ida, our brilliant operator|pg||

mb|1H!|nt|Walddk4: Sorry, Angelica it is|pg||
nt|doks: 11@S for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: @D T or small @S ?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: she is also good|pg||
nt|athene: three small clubs is a flaw, certainly|pg||
nt|athene: but i would still bid 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: 1@H strong relay|pg||
nt|psyck: Mostly Precision style bids|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: yes, not great suit & unfav vul, but your hand is still ok to enter at 1 level|pg||
nt|athene: well, north finds the heart lead anyway|pg||
nt|athene: now NS might be able to untangle four hearts, three spades and the @CA|pg||
nt|athene: but they would still do better playing in 2@H, i think|pg||
nt|psyck: if S tries 3N now, it will not be a success|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraph815: According to the methods of PO Sundelin|pg||
nt|psyck: @s for me too I guess|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 6 crds always pretty :)|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|muppe: interesting  lead|pg||
nt|psyck: with values marked in S's hand...|pg||
nt|psyck: this is usually one of the rate times it is ok to underlead Aces, when you know the bulk of the points are sitting above you|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi again, had a bit of a technical difficulty there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: *rare|pg||
nt|bobholl: a quick small one better than this :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, and with opps only in 1, you know you & pd will come in a few times to continue working on the @s's|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|muppe: Maybe west could still have bid 2@h but his hand didn't look so temptating to compete|pg||
nt|doks: W have nice support for partner suit, 100 for honors in money game|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|tomi2: not the best board for the NS methods, in other styles one of the players would habe bid 1NT in some point and become declarer there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: K of @H now (he knows P has 4)|pg||
nt|athene: has to be a spade now|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: E denied @s length in bidding|pg||
nt|doks: @D K ofside and no hope|pg||
pc|c9|nt|psyck: luckily does not matter here with everything breaking fine|pg||
nt|doks: but now its ok|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|psyck: not easy for W to stop below slam once pd shows 6@s's & @hA|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: very hard for north to find that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: they ger the @d ruff at the cost of a natural @h trick|pg||
nt|athene: south hasn't had a chance to show any suit-preference either|pg||
nt|psyck: sry, W showed @s length would be more pertinent|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|nt|bobholl: will be 1NT +1 i guess|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south could have been very creative|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|muppe: declarer still needs to guess @s|pg||
nt|athene: and won the @HQ at trick 1|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: trying to show spades|pg||
nt|athene: the trouble is it might well just deceive north|pg||
nt|henryb:  On the other hand some would reach 3N and go down quietly when the opponents take 3@s and 2 aces|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|psyck: @sK should be marked on bidding & values shown so far|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|psyck: a common strategem to underlead Ace with most values on left, not a success there|pg||

mb|d|nt|muppe: Test of slam bidding, 7@s for EW|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|gmarco24: 4@d is try for more, but no interest for Nielsen|pg||

pc|sA|nt|psyck: 6@h's 1@c ruff, need two @s's|pg||
nt|muppe: yes, and i think its findable as declarer will find E with the @cK and J and W overcalled|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think I would have tried 3N from W.|pg||
nt|psyck: they have certainly done very well to get to the finals here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck: I would just bid 4@s on 2@d|pg||
nt|psyck: not sure it is worth doubling nv opps who freely bid game|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Seems a little likely to tell them how to make it.|pg||
nt|psyck: the double may help dec restrich trump loser to 1, & 1 black suit loser each|pg||
nt|doks: this time good lead, it will be hard to manage this contract due to unfavorable minor position|pg||
pc|s3|nt|muppe: so after that W is pretty much marked with @sK|pg||
nt|psyck: good point|pg||
nt|psyck: S should be careful not to get endplayed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: some might not bid michaels with west as it's "middling" strength but showing 5-5 majors is worth a lot, and after 2@D there is room for either player to invite|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|santyclz: For example, if s is expecting to lose 2 trump tricks anyway, he could play the ace then 4 rounds of @ds pitching a @c |pg||
nt|psyck: dec will likely go down at least 1 as unlikely to get @h right either|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|muppe: well and quickly bid|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|henryb:  On the other hand, without a @h lead, 4@s would go down|pg||
nt|psyck: stopping in 3@s may work here (on a passive lead); but I do not understand 3@d - it's not like you need help here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobholl: wgy not a @S and hope @D K rigth ?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||

nt|bobholl: 1 trick in every colour so seems to make|pg||
nt|gmarco24: no possible ruffs in dummy, so @c switch could be look for partner's ruff|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: playing transfer responses to 1@C you have 1@S denying a major so 1NT doesn't have to be natural|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|psyck: Intermediate at vul for them I guess|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|athene: slightly unexpected decision in diamonds there|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobholl: i would finesse @D now but after @D K and @S back he has a guess |pg||
nt|santyclz: Not the auction s had in mind when he picked up his hand.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|ritong: no real reason to throw a trick away when there is @s Kx onside|pg||
nt|athene: with so much strength, declarer is just going for 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: so it looks normal to put the @DQ in at trick 1 ensuring you don't lose a diamond quickly|pg||
nt|psyck: as the cards are S could have been endplayed in @c for 2nd overtrick if Q played 1st trick|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@h also needs aggrement & pdship understanding|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bobholl: tof @D now but will he guess that ?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: after the @DQ holds (or gets covered) you play on the black suits|pg||

nt|psyck: They got to 6@s other table too|pg||
nt|psyck: I'm guessing @c9 will not be lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: declarer's problem will be managing entries in order to be able to cumulate chances|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: I would always bid my better major on that auction|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c was more Aspro style, where the bids are @h oriented|pg||

nt|psyck: other table, they got to a doubled @s contract on the 1@sx deal, 3 levels higher than here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|muppe: NS probably playing strong club as it could be dangerous pass that S hand in natural system|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: after all, maybe west is out of @cs|pg||

nt|psyck: doubt he will try for it though|pg||

nt|psyck: with the bulk of the values known to be with N, underleading A is a possibility|pg||
nt|psyck: lead, defense could cash top @d & @h & switch to trump, still cannot make|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: now dec will likely just lose 1@s & 2 trumps|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think so too, underleading the queen might cost a trick as well, as in that 3/4@S board and you are more likely to find the king in dummy and jack in hand here|pg||

nt|psyck: W's hand is a clear pass|pg||
nt|doks: E|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: thx for the update|pg||
nt|athene: rare to get enough at the 1-level, especially at these colours|pg||
nt|psyck: may work out to be a good choice to bid 1@d instead of 1@h|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, I meant E|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: but they might do it here if they start with @HKQ and then shift to a diamond|pg||
nt|psyck: E's good judgement in not opening deal 22 fetched 13 imps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: you're doing fine ida :)|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if west will be able to ask for a diamond with his trump spots|pg||
nt|doks: down 1 looks like|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: 3@h informs W of the sourse of trick, so just a matter of checking key cards after that|pg||
nt|muppe: depends how strong hand 3@h showed|pg||
nt|psyck: it should be a suit playable for max 1 loser opposite a void|pg||
nt|psyck: so with Jx, W knows it is running|pg||
nt|daman: this should be enough to move to slam|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: should make it|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@s, 1@h, 3@d, 1@c for -1, but NS deserve 2@d to be making for this auction|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gmarco24: K@c is standard|pg||

nt|daman: 4@C followed by 4@H?    what other way is there to invite?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: actually it doesn't matter, declarer has nowhere to go anyway|pg||
nt|psyck: well bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: This has been a quite low-scoring match, 97 boards, 197 imps.  Those 13 imps may decide the match.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck: maybe they will be in 4M making other table anyway|pg||

pc|s2|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|ritong: hi K|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi|pg||
nt|athene: but he can still scramble 4 tricks (two clubs, diamond, spade) so EW would have done better in their game - if they make it!|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ritong: south is inquiring about the auction|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: and declarer shows his hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: even if not, he can see the 5 level is safe & there are lots of source of tricks in majors|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: declarer would not know there who had the @CA |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: if he knew west had it, he might try the king there|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: i am told is actually two way, weak in spades or strong in hearts, hence the 2@S response|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gmarco24: to mislead S if he has A@c, he might not cash it next time when he gets in trick|pg||
nt|athene: getting two entries to hand to lead spades up twice and get away for 300|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|doks: in 4@H must manage @S position, so -200 not a big deal vs potential +170 or even 420|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: though in this board could be 200 to 50 - 6 imps together|pg||
nt|psyck: N will play @sT now or on @cA to ensure he gets a @d trick|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: west might not realise the urgent need for the diamond shift|pg||
nt|athene: if the club went small - king - ace|pg||
nt|athene: he can draw trumps but then hard to play diamond, club looks natural|pg||
nt|athene: i guess east could signal on the trumps |pg||
nt|athene: but that would be a harder test|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: if he threw a spade, one spade lead towards dummy sets up both declarer's tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: when he throws a diamond north can just lead a spade to the jack then exit a diamond and wait for the @SK|pg||

pc|c9|nt|athene: when you play 2@C as 2+ clubs, though, there is a case for rebidding with "only" five a bit more often, just to let partner know you do have a club suit|pg||

nt|muppe: i might even have jumped to 3@d as N after the 1@c by W|pg||
nt|psyck: & W's hand could be too wide ranging for E to take action|pg||
nt|bobholl: kibs asks wheather 5@C would have been exclusion or to play :) interesting question :)|pg||
nt|psyck: you cannot do exclusion without setting trumps 1st|pg||

nt|othered1: with no distributional storms EW, 3N costs 2 imps v. 4@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the "Old Days" when bidding wasn't as competitive, low was considered 2 imps/board, now it's more like 4.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1D|nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|psyck: that may well be what happend, Angelica could have got the play wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: so 1@c is not strong & the alert is just that @c could be short|pg||

nt|psyck: good choice|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|psyck: 3N has chances here i suppose|pg||

nt|psyck: Strong @c & stronger @d|pg||
nt|doks: 1@S here not forsing, 16-19|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: weak pass & weaker @h|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: NS lead third best so i suppose the @H3 could be from @H9432|pg||
nt|athene: if he had decided 1nt was more descriptive than a negative double |pg||
nt|athene: so south might put the ace on nothing|pg||
nt|doks: but only 2 points weaker|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|muppe: ok 3@h, splinter|pg||
nt|doks: N have 19 pointss and partner bid @H :) hard to stay low|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: last makeable contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: good auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: strange pass by N 1st time|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h has its chances|pg||
nt|psyck: normally, when opps bid two suits, you bid the suit where you have stopper|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: they certainly play big @c, but that does not justifi a pass imho|pg||
nt|psyck: reverse way around here|pg||
nt|tomi2: he had no space to bid their other suit|pg||
nt|psyck: oh, my mistake|pg||
nt|doks: there are more than 40 combined points in this deck|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 49,75:)|pg||
nt|doks: 2@Dx indeed create 6IMPs to Sweeden|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, too much shape & possibilities|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not difficult to build a hand which produces slam , even under strong 1@c opening, so there are thousands which produce game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this lead is stranger than the pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: then we don t teach players what is best in boards:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|gmarco24: either needs 2 @h ruffs in hand or 2 @d ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tomi2: 2@H can be played as "i have one stopper, do you have the other"?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes it was unfortunate, maybe 4@s could make there but 4@h was normal spot to be in|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|muppe: but 4@h doesnt|pg||
nt|bobholl: already thinking about continuation i guess but @H looks obvious|pg||
nt|tomi2: here, and in most deals partner can see fron his holding what stoper partner has|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 3@h is only 1 down, how many down would be 3@d? I opted 2 down|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|athene: i wonder if two down was possible, if south finessed against dummy at trick 1|pg||

pc|sK|nt|bobholl: that @H may be costly :)|pg||

nt|psyck: 6 an interesting card to lead from K62|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could be polish style|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe they play some kind of coded leads|pg||
nt|ritong: 2/4, for instance|pg||
nt|psyck: oh, ok|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: leaving declarer with losing clubs|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, it's imps, it doesn't matter much|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: such an easy endplay    his hand counted out|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|psyck: no super acceptance for EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this sequence i play as slam try|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C two-way checkback i imagine; forces 2@D either to play there or to make an invitational bid|pg||
nt|psyck: that lead should save time|pg||
nt|othered1: Some play this sequence as a mild slam try and use a 4-level transfer for hands just wanting to punt 4!F|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H, reather|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: responder can't gamble to try for minor fit, since opener can be with 4@d|pg||

nt|doks: in classic Gazilly S hand is direct 3@C bid|pg||
nt|Vugraph815: yes 2@C strong or nat, 2@D FG if p is strong, 3@C strong with 5-5|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: its not problem of @D discards but take 13 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer should manage to hold his losers to @CK, @DAQ, @HAK|pg||
nt|athene: he can't, surely, be considering running this?|pg||
nt|athene: does he think that the lead of the lowest outstanding spot card guarantees the queen?|pg||
nt|athene: a pitch on the spades would not help him that much anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so it's just risking a lot without any great upside|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: guess S felt he was not strong enough to make a try on 4@c|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: which west is too weak for, hence either 3@S splinter rebid or Texas transfer directly|pg||
nt|doks: so something went wrong, open room even with @S action slam was bid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|muppe: i think X is good with that bad @s suit|pg||
nt|muppe: but i dont mind 2@s|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: @c would actually have been best possible lead double dummy, 3rd & 4th round of @c's would force dec to guess the @dQ location to make & would likely get it wrong|pg||

nt|santyclz: Not the killing lead...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|muppe: and maybe north should have passed,what do you think?|pg||
nt|psyck: Other table E opened on deal 26 & that was enough for W to blast to slam|pg||
nt|doks: 3@H probably Hx in @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: has chances without @c lead|pg||
nt|gmarco24: this should be expensive|pg||
nt|psyck: lost 2 @h tricks, but was likely making anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: that lead does not hurt :)|pg||
nt|doks: same outcome, may influence @D lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: so, he should start with a reopening double, i think|pg||
nt|psyck: N does have a defensive balanced hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: I'm not sure I'd start with 3@c in the 1st place|pg||
nt|daman: I would pass    I have D   esp AJ10x behind the obvious @H hand|pg||
nt|gmarco24: looks like -3 or -4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: 5@H is not my choice with east swiss cheese|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|psyck: maybe it is some kind of Good-Bad seq for them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west has a tough hand, the actual auction seems reasonable to me if 4@D not forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: well 3@c is a bit scary, but perhaps hiding @c AJxxxx when opps are susceptible to preempt is even more scary|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|gmarco24: :/|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: if dec played low @h from hand S cannot win without giving 3 @h tricks, if S ducks on the other hand, dec plays 2 @hs & sets up @c|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: I play Bad-Good 2NT, & would bid 3@c myself, & would be able to bid 4@d later NF|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Janis can explain something of this bidding?|pg||
nt|doks: 2@S is pass/correct bid, so now what is 4@H?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ryskiel_: 1NT - kind of Dynamic NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: EW playing canape overcalls?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i was interested in seeing what would happen after 1@d 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: 1NT= minors or majors|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tx|pg||
nt|doks: kind of defence against Polish club or like|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|psyck: normall bidding until 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: north isn't going to duck a club lead towards dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently inevitable to get to this spot|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psyck: maybe 3@s Henri?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Most effective lead, and could lead to a 4 or five imp pickup for Rubin|pg||
nt|henryb:  wh just took the lead with a 6 imp gain on 28|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ritong: mm|pg||
nt|athene: he can see one off in his own hand, he won't get cute looking for two off|pg||
nt|psyck: Pharma found the @c lead i mentioned in the 4@h deal :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: dec even had the pleasure of discarding two winning K's in the last two tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: we could well see swings for Pharma last to deals to even it up :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: other table, the previous deal was played by W, so 11 tricks could not be prevented, this table had a chance - with @c lead|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|psyck: they played 4 rounds of @c, & with 5 carded @c with W, likely to guess @dQ wrong|pg||
