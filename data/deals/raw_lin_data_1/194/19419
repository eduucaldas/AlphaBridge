mb|p|pc|sK|nt|santyclz: 3@c?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfe: I don't know what the 2@h means, but there was a lengthy conversation between|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Westheimer and von Arnim at the time.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|santyclz: Seems more likely n would bid that...|pg||
nt|chick: a hand to pass out :)|pg||
nt|peachy: West had enough, understandably.  She knows NS on shaky ground, doesnt need much math to figure that|pg||

nt|peachy: doable but does he have info on where ace is?|pg||
nt|ybob: he plays 3 rounds @D and home after N shows only 3@D|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|peachy: Would declarer have stranded spades on purpose if she had two of them?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Perhaps she is depending on Qx of @hs in one hand.|pg||

nt|ybob: declarer need 3/3 @C so N showed 5@S 2@H what wrong with play QJ@D and another @D ?|pg||
nt|stewball: its not clear what this line catered to ,other than elegance|pg||
pc|d8|nt|peachy: since they missed the heart fit, it really does not matter what happens on this hand|pg||
nt|stewball: well at least theres not as much at stake given the OR result|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: When the cards start flying at this table, they do so very fast.|pg||
