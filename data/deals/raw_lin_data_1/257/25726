nt|bjacobs: howdy|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|2C|nt|djneill:  North has proved very aggressive this tournament, should be a fun round to watch|pg||
nt|djneill:  But South also is, clearly, with a 14 HCP NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|djneill:  Stayman by North Bill?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bjacobs: Well, North couldn't Stayman in the first place, because of the risk of a 2@D response|pg||
nt|djneill:  E-W are top German pair, but their names would make you think not from Germany|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  Wonder if North is considering 3H! must show 4414|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, they came 3rd in the World Open Pairs in 2010 in Philadelphia|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  Lauria and Garozzo are part of the old (and very old) guard for Italy|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bjacobs: They first played together in the Bermuda Bowl in, I think, 1979|pg||
nt|bjacobs: in Rio de Janiero|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Lauria was very much a youngster then|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|an| |nt|djneill:  well a possible swing to E-W - if South opens 1@c instead of 1NT, and North responses 1@h, then East is shut out, and N-S might have won it in 2@s making|pg||
mb|p!|an| |mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C Stayman, but includes INV 5@S 4@H|pg||
nt|djneill:  East went with Stayman instead of a transfer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now what?  This is an excellent slam ... in theory|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|ahollan1: 3@C relay for distribution|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok at other table, South did open 1@c, and North did bid @h, except via a 1@d transfer, and now East could bid 1@h naturally!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4@D   they try to have responses to relays as natural|pg||
nt|djneill:  I guess East is trying to indicate a strong hand with @s, instead of a limit hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H is another relay  or  3@S = RKC|pg||
mb|3S|an| |mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 0314 responses|pg||
nt|djneill:  seems slam is doomed without a nice guess in spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So, um, 4@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012worldchampionships-lille/openteams/germany/piekarek-smirnov.pdf|pg||
mb|4D|an| |nt|ahollan1: but it doesn't have these details :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.cavendishmonaco.com/files/miniram1/miniram1.html  for round 1 results|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok North knows they have @s and @d, so a @c or @h lead is coming|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in some situations EW use "optional RKC"  where step 1 = minimum   i'm sure Smirnov just confirming this is straight RKC|pg||
nt|djneill:  it is normal to lead a suit they do not bid|pg||
pc|h7|nt|djneill:  North espouses leading from Kings against slam - so West is not going to just rise without a good think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, he won't rise.  I think he'll put in @H9|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 9 seems clear|pg||
nt|djneill:  welcome Walter|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If that should happen to win, it's Game Set and Match|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Dan's point is that Garozzo is known to have advised attacking leads against slams|pg||
nt|djneill:  so you are thinking it is more likely from the King, than from a singleton|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Auken leads @D2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: did W show his interest in slam at anytime al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope -- just answered questions|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|djneill:  here we go, needs the guess|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, that seems like a very strange play to me, leading to no fallback outcomes should there be a trump loser|pg||
nt|bigtrain: E doesn't feel like a slam force to me|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: e/w may get to  @S   and may go down|pg||
nt|ady: get to 6@S|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  yes, @s guess is necessary in both slams|pg||
nt|ady: would need to guess the spade position  - unlikely|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ady: 17 opposite 14   all 4 top controls  and 9 card fit   hard to stay out of a slam|pg||

nt|SFoxa:  so, rather down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  from the other hand, N have heard "trump invite" sequence and rejected trump lead|pg||

nt|djneill:  hmm, West could have tried playing @d then ruffing a heart, then a spade to endplay North if they have the @cK|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|bjacobs: That requires the player with long trumps to have 4 diamonds, etc, etc|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And for the @HK to be onside anyway?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H usually max of 18  [can be stronger if 2-suiter]|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  East is maxing out|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW system = Baltic Club|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|djneill:  ok North goes quietly - the short @s was a warning|pg||
