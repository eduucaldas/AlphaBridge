nt|jbgood: 12 pairs A-final, also other heats for prizes B (12 pairs) - C (next 12) and D|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzkx: no D , only 3 groups|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: leaders seem to be getting opponents in reverse order of qualification  1st the lowest qualifier  now the 11th qualifier|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: ok - sry about that:)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzkx: A and B have carryover, no C|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I guess that North's sequence is an invitational hand with clubs (along with the hearts he has shown)|pg||

nt|vugraphzkx: the carryover for schwaz is 246|pg||
nt|vugraphzkx: Schwartz* sorry|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: Spade lead looks like the best combination of safety and productivity --|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: very aggressive by Schwartz on the misfit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i agree but this diamond is going to work|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: how will it work?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well diamond 10 or 9 would work, this blocked the suit in a sense|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: And if the 10 were led, do you think East would duck?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 0-2 yes|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: and if the lead were from K109x?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that treatment is for a reason|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unlucky :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: he is home now|pg||
nt|kit: The reality is that there is no way Grue would ever duck.|pg||
nt|kit: if 10 (or 9 depending on agreements) were led, it could have been from K109xx -- so it is impossible for East to duck.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: assuming @S5 was a difficult to read Smith or count signal -- was there a reason for Grue to get the defense on right track with @S duck?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: sorry  typing at same time Kit answered the question|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see how Grue could have realistically gotten it right after any diamond lead.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: NS do play Namyats  so 4@S weaker than 4@D opener|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aggresive|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but passing is probably even more aggressive -- if you think aggressive means risky|pg||
nt|kit: 5@S will make unless East makes a very inspired club lead -- i don't see that happening.|pg||
mb|5S|nt|jbgood: so 6 @h will be a good save|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: even 6 @c |pg||
nt|kit: Quite a bid by West here -- nice decision.|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: Now South has the last guess.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is he seriously thinking of anything but double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Grue 4N can be any 2-suiter so del'Monte couldn't bid immediate 6@H|pg||
nt|kit: I agree -- double seems pretty clear.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: leads 2nd/4th|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 NT  not for minors as some kibs suggest - but shows a 2- suiter|pg||
nt|kit: Nice lead -- if partner can figure it out, that is.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: preemptor leads are singletons|pg||
nt|kit: But will South work out that North has a heart void?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond back is good enough|pg||
nt|kit: If it were a singleton, that would give West 5 diamonds|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if del'Monte held @C & @D   does he bid 5N instead of 6@C|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|s8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|c9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: Sometimes taking the setting trick has unexpected rewards :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: unfair that 20-somethings play this well|pg||
nt|kit: Actually there was no reason not to cash the ace of hearts and returning a diamond -- unless something unexpected happens on the heart lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kit, anyway to get to hearts you can think of|pg||

nt|kit: it seems as though on such an elementary auction an experienced pair shouldn't have a mixup on what 3@S means|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: The queen of diamonds lead is helpful, since now declare knows the double finesse is on.  Why not lead a small diamond?|pg||

nt|jbgood: must be the point|pg||
nt|vugraphzkx: I didnt feel any slow bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lol|pg||
nt|kit: You can't adjust because an opponent makes a bid you think is bad and it works.|pg||
nt|SukritV:  where was the slow pass? over 3NT?|pg||
nt|jbgood: so true, Kit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is the argument|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Conditions of Contest for the recent Buffett Cup  defined how to handle perceived slow transfer of tray|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ideally TD should be called before Fisher bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: screens for all tables throughout the event|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that would be before you knew there was going to be a bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Buffett Cup started with screens, but they were removed after 1st set [or maybe after 1st day]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right   call if perception of slow transfer of tray|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Buras/Fisher  call if they think slow to get bids from Schwartz/Narkiewicz|pg||
