nt|uni_dennis: Fantunes under more pressure as EW compete to 5@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: and Fantunes bid 7@S!|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|SFoxa:  in fact even 7@h is worth sacrificing|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  wow! that's good idea, if EW lead @h|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @h lead was found!|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  hard to believe!|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  kind of action. yes!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|uni_dennis: well, S showed @d suit, so might needed to cash an Ace. And since W did not double, he wanted the normal @h lead|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  unlike this board - normal contract, normal lead, average result expected|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: lot of work to do for declarer here|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  yes, without helping hand from defence declarer will rather go down|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  still the outcome should be duplicated (or multiplicated?)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: well, if S opens 18-19 BAL without showing @d (like the italians) then W might lead @d|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and Fantunes only play 1NT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: after 1@c (1@d) etc.|pg||

nt|SFoxa:  still @s lead looks very well after this bidding|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h2|pc|d4|nt|uni_dennis: declarer might have started with @d to Q at trick 2|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|uni_dennis: if it wins, can play @c with 1@d trick already in|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if it loses, still gives you chance for 4@d + 5 others|pg||
pc|h3|nt|SFoxa:  a lot of opportunities after uncontested auction|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  few E may open 2@h|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  then @h start is indicated but possible lay of the cards in other suits as well|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if S plays @d now, W needs to play a @h, else East will be endplayed after 2@s|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  yes, hard ending for both sides|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|uni_dennis: but if S plays @dQ from dummy W might as well just duck|pg||

nt|ritong: my idea is they had a misfit about turbo|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|johnathan:  1@h = 14+ or 11-13 with 4@S|pg||
mb|3N|an| |mb|4C|mb|4D|mb|4S|nt|dbrenner: no turbo in that situation|pg||
mb|5H|an| |mb|p|nt|dbrenner: I guess he tought Nunes had the Aces to cue d withoutu the A at that level|pg||
nt|ritong: there s something wrong in paradise, then|pg||
nt|ritong: there must be a way to check aces when opponents are violent|pg||
nt|dbrenner: yes|pg||
nt|johnathan:  5@H should be odd number of keycards and no minor controls|pg||
nt|vugraphzkx: nunes is asking something to Hornslien|pg||
nt|vugraphzkx: he wants to know something on the 4@c|pg||
nt|dbrenner: 3NT is a decent 4@h bid|pg||
nt|dbrenner: 4@h would be weaker|pg||
nt|vugraphzkx: and hornslien is not sure...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkx: he say : "perhaps" or "perhaps"...|pg||
