nt|psridhar: gud choice of match for vug|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2 contenders at the moment|pg||
nt|r_tibre: i know N wud not overcall 1@S on this hand... but after initial hiccups, they seemed to have dev a decent understanding|pg||

nt|psridhar: when u bid @h and they @s, and it looks like 4@s is likely you have 3 choices -1. slow the auction so that everyone bids his hand and they let u play 4@h 2.blast 4@H and create ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: uncertaintly , put them under pressure 3. make a descriptive bid like 4@d here and let pd decide|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s5|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||

nt|psridhar: i would resort to option 2 when i want them to bid 4@s |pg||
nt|r_tibre: they reached the par... def cud put more pressure by cashing 4 top tricks and playing the 4rth @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|1H|nt|psridhar: Venky wd probably opened weak 2@h first seat-but 2nd seat experts are more classical , gud suit etc|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: idea is first seat it preempts TWO oppo so the risk pays dividend|pg||
nt|r_tibre: and neither the shape nor the vul favor a 2@H opening|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|r_tibre: a @S shift now?|pg||
nt|psridhar: it was not clear but ducking the @H lost him a tempo|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|r_tibre: yes.. question is do u trust the @H75 or not.. more often than not, leads are true cards|pg||
nt|r_tibre: if u trust 75 to be dblton, then can try and duck a @D to N|pg||
nt|psridhar: more than 75 focus on that 1@H bid missing the @c ace vul|pg||
nt|psridhar: does it 'fell' like it wd be on a 5 bagger?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|psridhar: 'feel'|pg||
nt|r_tibre: yes that too.. so almost certainly 6 cards|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|psridhar: @s 4 ws bad choice on this layout for Pd to return the suit|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|r_tibre: yes.. w/ Q it wud have been ok|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|psridhar: NK also cd hv won and returned his @c forcing decl to cash his winnners in dummy|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h4|nt|r_tibre: declarer has still to decide which suit breaks 3-3|pg||
nt|r_tibre: think he will gues right, as N returned a small @S|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h8|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psridhar: @s Q, @h A, @d AK, @c king with 1 @c opener did seem a possibility but the @s jack was bothersome card unless pd had 4 card @s|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|r_tibre: no slam here if def can find a @S ruff|pg||
nt|psridhar: or 6@c for that matter|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|psridhar: NK waiting|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 4@d will make|pg||
nt|r_tibre: N's 3rd seat openers often not trusted by his p to be genuine.. perhaps that explains S's lack of action|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|r_tibre: think S can dbl 3@Ds in their methods to show both blacs and some HCP|pg||

nt|psridhar: risky yes but passing was riskier as we saw |pg||
nt|r_tibre: 2 missed opp for NS this round.. the 3n def, and then the 5@H game|pg||
