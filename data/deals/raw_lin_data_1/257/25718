nt|chmitty: yep ... match is over for sure now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup no bds left to recover|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has to avoid a @d switch|pg||
nt|chmitty: the French will grab 5 imps on board 13 (3@s next door), 14 is a push for sure|pg||

This way after 2NT opening ...|pg||
nt|trotto: you can show hands with exactly 4@h/5@s, which you can't bid in natural way before 3NT level. |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  3nt is optimistic here 11+11 but on a good day -maybe .but not ew|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|trotto: There is another similiar solution to this, which I use with my partners: 3@s after 2NT as transfer to NT, and direct 3NT after 2NT = 4@h/5@s|pg||
