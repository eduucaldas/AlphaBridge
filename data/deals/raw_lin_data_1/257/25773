nt|ahollan1: thru 14  Fisher-Schwartz over Zia-Madala by  65|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those pairs meet in the penultimate round|pg||

nt|ahollan1: real imps  approximately that total divided by 5|pg||

nt|dbrenner: the penultimate round will decide it then |pg||

nt|ahollan1: 6 tables in Group A  so 5 comparisons for the cross-imp score|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  18 was scored as 5@DX +300  for 25 imps to NS   if reverts back to 3N  that gives NS -400|pg||

nt|djneill:  after the mahmood-madala 4@h-1, we may see a catchup, not sure|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20    likely part score in on of the najors|pg||
nt|vugraphzky: I guess that the live score is not up to date since 2 rounds|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok|pg||
nt|djneill:  double 3@c by South?|pg||
mb|p|nt|SFoxa:  as it was yesterday - no live scores for last 3 rounds|pg||

nt|djneill:  the @s blockage is annoying|pg||
nt|djneill:  amazing, East did not think long about a @c ruff, what if South is 2443|pg||
nt|djneill:  whoops South is dummy, forget that|pg||
nt|djneill:  North is pretty sure the @sQ is with West, since East has @cAQJ and @hQ, yet Passed originally with 6 clubs|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: a very impressive tournament for the young Israelis|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ritong: so, first they hope for a neutral board|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: which is better   Cavendish win or  Transnational win in Veldhoven?|pg||

nt|ady: only 2 club losers on the surface  will need to either set up clubs  or need 2 ruffs for 11 tricks|pg||
