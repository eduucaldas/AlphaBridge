nt|vugraphzkx: tomorrow session'll start at 9:30 am instead of 10:00am|pg||
nt|ritong: strange huddle|pg||
nt|vugraphzkx: we've stopped because of an announcement of the director of the tournament|pg||

nt|vugraphzkx: ok, we can go|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|ritong: so the standard spot|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ritong: @ss remained hidden, so a lead which does not hurt much|pg||
nt|po-s: better go for spades now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: yes, looks like 9 tricks with the long @s|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: but perhaps a @h now counters this|pg||
pc|d7|nt|po-s: very true, but difficult to find|pg||

nt|ady: once again   thx Sveta  Greg and spex|pg||
nt|vugraphzky: thx|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  have a nice evening and be ready for tomorrow - high stakes, high emotions|pg||
nt|vugraphzky: tomorrow starts at 09.30am|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  good point - in BBO still 10|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  EW will be lucky to win 3NT here|pg||
nt|vugraphzky: they advanced it because some have a flight early in the evening|pg||
mb|p|nt|SFoxa:  keeping S out of lead in @h after @c start|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|ady: major suits breaking badly|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  N is destined to present declarer with a trick for the start|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  the contract isn't an easy walk though|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead does not give a trick   maybe some tempo|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  declarer will do well continuing the suit defence started|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: defence will do well to play diamonds|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  or even @h now|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|SFoxa:  a lot of work to do by declarer - establishing tricks in each suit|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  well done by N|pg||
nt|ady: declarer trying for 3 spades 3 diamonds  2 hearts and 1 club|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: needs to play a spade now|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|po-s: 6 diamonds may go down if you doublefiness hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: lorenzini may like @c AJ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: and accept despite his 12 count|pg||
nt|ritong: but he reasonably gives up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW convention card doesn't explain why 2@C response rather than something else|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only that 2/1 was game force  and 2N rebid  12-14 or 18-19|pg||

pc|c8|pc|dT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|johnathan:  5@D could go down on a spade lead, if declarer plays double finesse on hearts|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ady: but I think defence could prevail by ducking if playing a club to the jack   not enough entried to set up long spade|pg||
