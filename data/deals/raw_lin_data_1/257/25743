mb|p|mb|3C|an| |mb|p|mb|3D|nt|stoffers: puppet stayman it seems|pg||
nt|geot: Puppet Stayman, East primise a major. West will tell about hearts (3@S) and then 3NT|pg||
nt|pelu:  3@c asking for 5 card major, 3@D - no 5-card, but 1 or 2 4-card|pg||

nt|stoffers: That will get ducked, then have to finesse spades to get the clubs good for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|stoffers: Might try a heart, but the opening bid makes Fantoni favourite to hold the ace. |pg||

pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|SFoxa:  to apply max. penalty, defence has to play trump at any moment preventing declarer from @c ruffs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: seems like N is aware that S only has 5@s for his 2@s bid|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: S did not open a weak-2, so probably doesn't have 6|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  or very weak hand - passed at the first round|pg||

pc|sA|nt|stoffers: Agree|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|mc|9|nt|geot: Board 4: Lunds agressive 3@S worked in a way. Note that on a weak 2@S opening North would normally overcall, and N/S might end up in 3NT (for sure 3NT if N overcalls 2NT)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|uni_dennis: but 2@s will give NS enough room to find a contract to go down|pg||

mb|3S|nt|SFoxa:  3@h, sorry|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but 4@s will make on a better day (with @dA and @sK onside)|pg||

nt|geot: It will be much better to play a NT contract from the North hand here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: and an easy 3NT to finish the first session|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|SFoxa:  after W pass, E doesn't go overboard|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks routine for e/w|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|SFoxa:  at least, he shouldn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: results: http://www.cavendishmonaco.com/index.php?option=com_bridgeresultats&view=resultats&layout=menu2&Itemid=245&lang=en|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead best|pg||
pc|hT|nt|SFoxa:  W asked for majors so S can refuse @s lead and start with @c|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: cumulate rankings  at session 3 for the overall standings|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  that's lesser help for declarer|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  3 tricks in @h all in all|pg||
nt|ady: declarer can make 3 diamond tricks when stiff queen appears 1st round|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: any sensible line of play will lead to at least 9 tricks here|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|ady: now diamond to ace or king   and low diamond to pick up 3 tricks|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|uni_dennis: north guards @c as well|pg||
