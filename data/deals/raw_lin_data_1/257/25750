nt|vicky888: why would prabhakar win with ace?|pg||
nt|jAiN: operator,was that right?|pg||
nt|r_tibre: if N has @SQTxx, then declarer cant play a trump from hand, and needs to get to dummy|pg||
nt|jAiN: operator,did prabha win the @D with A?|pg||
nt|r_tibre: dbl of a thin game can often work wonders for defence|pg||

nt|DSIP:  normally the person who does 4th suit forcing, sets the suit on his next bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfz: this is rkc in @s for E?|pg||
nt|DSIP:  since he did not do so here; it is ambiguous whether E just replied Aces or Key Cards for @s|pg||
mb|6H|nt|babumoshay: 2 aces and Cl King will suffice|pg||

nt|babumoshay: but he cd hv bid 5N showing 2 aces and a void, as far as I know in Sanjay's system|pg||
nt|DSIP:  then he can RKC for @h & then once he finds they have all key cards, he can bid 5NT to try for grand|pg||
