nt|SFoxa:  N bid 4@h (what else, actually), and NS landed in 6@h|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|SFoxa:  S is definitely allowed for one more bid|pg||

mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  who knows -depence what was 4nt -and not so easy to know that either-so north raised|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: but 4@H was very pessimistic imo|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|pelu:  what would u bid - 1@D very normal for me|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||

nt|djneill:  e.g. East could bid 3NT|pg||

pc|h5|nt|pelu:  we lost the @c-suit years ago - but I still have the @d's|pg||

nt|roswolf: ty for info|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  yes the missed slam tightened the match and with the 26 appeal it could be a lavazza win|pg||
nt|djneill:  here is that 1@c-1@d again|pg||
nt|roswolf: east tempted to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|pelu:  yes Dan - its bridge not poker :):(|pg||

nt|djneill:  bocchi banking on the @d layout and timid E-W auction|pg||

nt|pelu:  if W has @HA he will have 2 tricks, but if "only" KX then @HQ will cost a trick|pg||
pc|c3|nt|djneill:  somteimes you double because the auction tells you they have minimal HCP, like here - it's not like E-W could have 28 HCP on this auction - East is 12-14, West is 11 (from 2NT)|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup and i fancy lavazza will win the match regardless of the appeal|pg||
nt|djneill:  North tried to fool West with the @dK - that would mean North has the @sQ for the double|pg||
nt|pelu:  better to discard @h4 and "tell" that u have @sQ - finess and rest for defense :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  if North has @dKQ and @hA, as passed hand, likely no @sQ|pg||
