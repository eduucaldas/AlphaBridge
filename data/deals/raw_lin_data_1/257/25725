mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Pls tell us about Slawinsky leads, Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well ...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: Normal count from an honour, upside down count without an honour|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About sums it up|pg||
nt|pelu:  what to lead from N: @c7, @d2 or @hQ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So here, he's playing a normal count signal (@C7) from the suit that has an honour|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Kit Woolsey (I think) has made the excellent point that against NT, avoid leading from suits that have two honours separated by 2 cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In other words, K10xx and AJxx are poorish leads|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Here the club lead is quite likely to work well if partner can supply any honour at all|pg||
nt|pelu:  so if he would lead @D he has to lead @d8? a very high card from that suit|pg||
nt|pelu:  could often cost a trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's right Peter, the @D8 would be the Slawinski card, and that's unappealing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I love the Fantoni-Nunes system, but have never got the hang of their Slawinski leads, and gave them up after about 6 months of trying|pg||
nt|andyv:  as we can see, @c lead is effective as it knocks out the entry to the 4th @s|pg||

mc|8|nt|bjacobs: I reckon both positions were reasonable, but when you put them together, it adds up to getting too high|pg||
