nt|bjacobs: well 3NT will all depend on the lead.  This contract looks to be making comfortably|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helness led @D2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so NS took 1st 5 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu:  wow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other room without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|bjacobs: that was quite some lead.  East bid spades several times ... perhaps the lack of any double from South helped Helness|pg||
nt|pelu:  but as u see 3NT also need @cKx or stiff to make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No hurry Fulvio - we can surf the internet while waiting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fantoni won't play until he's found line that works when @CK is offside -- or he's convinced no line exists for that situation|pg||

nt|ahollan1: when it works, it's deliberate    only slow if it he goes down|pg||
nt|pelu:  what is his problem now?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Clubs 3-1 I guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that hearts are supposed to be 5-0|pg||
