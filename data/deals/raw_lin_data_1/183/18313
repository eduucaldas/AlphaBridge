pc|hA|nt|iceking: S took a rather passive view here|pg||

nt|iceking: not sure i could play def vs 2@H here, though bidding is little strange also as you are not sure you have fitt anywere|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Kunne √É¬òst ikke have overmeldt med 4 Ru?|pg||
nt|grebrof: the norwegians are naturalists (besides the bery weak NT in nonvul 1st-3rd) opposite the more artificial approach from the finnish|pg||
nt|haans: finns Magic Diamond?|pg||

nt|sharkey: Marianne Harding and Ann Karin Fuglestad are the anchor pair of the Norwegian team - many years international experience|pg||

nt|grebrof: she is NOT playing with you now my friend :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2NT may be with 5 hearts so bidding an error|pg||
nt|diaoff: Hi all|pg||
nt|haans: missed a trick |pg||
nt|haans: defense|pg||
pc|sA|nt|zebutin: different openings from 1st/2nd hand and 3rd/4th for finnish pair, but from 1st and 2nd they play weak nt, and 1@D-1@S openings are 10-14 and 4card suit|pg||
nt|gautis2: :) ..well, cant argue with sucess, since 4@s was born to go down|pg||

mb|1H|nt|zebutin: and if some pairs card interests you http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.2354|pg||
nt|zebutin: has convention card for all players it seems|pg||
nt|grebrof: Gunn Tove was in the winning team in 2007 - then partnering Siv Thoresen who is by many considered being the best female player in Norway. for the first time in many years (dont ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: know hom many), she is not in the bracket this time|pg||
nt|diaoff: Starting the chase|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: a well deserved lead too|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  Anyway, ti was easier to play than to bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: good start for Norway avoiding the impossible 4@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: some kind of Multi...|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
nt|haans: very high in hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 if E doesnt get a spade ruff|pg||
nt|diaoff: Need to find the @S ruff to beat 6@H|pg||
nt|haans: now slamming|pg||
nt|grebrof: good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 1nt 15-17 from 3rd hand|pg||
nt|haans: easy make in 3nt at last board|pg||
nt|haans: very few will bid to slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: may be pushed if EW saves too much|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find diamonds|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@s on NS|pg||
nt|iceking: good slam here |pg||
nt|iceking: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|grebrof: the +15 @c comes into action|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pass or Correct|pg||
nt|diaoff: 4NT now, maybe?|pg||
nt|haans: yep find it now|pg||
nt|jbgood: but of course difficult to know what to do on S's cards - doesnt know about the di void|pg||
nt|diaoff: If she passes, She will soon find out the possibility I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: lot of options for S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They finished in 5@c last deal in open after some relay bids with 3 rounds of @h for -1|pg||
nt|jbgood: one push - yes, she will be wiser if W prefers @d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a grand.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|psyck: chose drury|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@C probably one way drury|pg||
nt|sharkey: If N can find a take out x now....|pg||
nt|haans: 1. Interview Fulvio Fantoni http://www.confsudbridge.org/hitsII/fantoni001i.aspx: If you had to choose a convention, which one would you pick?|pg||
nt|haans: 2. Fantoni: Gazzilli... is a convention that I think should be used by all who play natural bridge|pg||
nt|haans: 3. Gazzilli:  http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/public/1239625981_14209_FT0_gazzillind.pdf |pg||
nt|grebrof: 2@d showing +8hp (if Gazilli)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|psyck: 2@d showing a good opening with at least game interest|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D real opening,as i play myself here i would bid 3@D with north hand natural and slammish|pg||
nt|nubmaster: So a good start for Sweden here|pg||
nt|gautis2: partscore battle|pg||
nt|grebrof: as a guess I would think the dbl of 1@h from E is 5-7hp - their card says nothing about what "neg dbls" are|pg||
nt|gautis2: i guess x shows hp s not @s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: too complicated to remember Haans:)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D GF if strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6@D had been my choice|pg||
nt|jbgood: dbl seems a bit much? Prd is likely to have 10 minor cards...|pg||
nt|haans: scary|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|psyck: 3@d a nice treatment there Magnus|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 3D/3H transfer nodays 3@C just showing max|pg||
nt|jbgood: so a doubled overtrick...|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree its a good convention - you rarely stop in 2@c anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 4@h seems to need to find @dQ, tho 4th @s could be useful|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|zebutin: in 4@H you would seem to lose 2 @S + @C, because spades are 3-3 you can throw one diamond to 4th spade|pg||
nt|zebutin: so might not need to quess diamond suit|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room finnish women played 2@S some down, there is magic diamond system in effect, that has 8-11 openings in 1st and 2nd hand, so makes often for different scores|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is a very good contract for NS|pg||
nt|haans: You can later read: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/public/1239625981_14209_FT0_gazzillind.pdf |pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|psyck: N will likely blast to slam in spite of missing a keycard|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Anyone who can tell us about the bidding here? 2NT like good/bad NT or something?|pg||
nt|haans: thats a "modern" weak 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl from N is good seing the layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: good morning|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|iceking: W made a very light 3rd seat opening in open room|pg||
nt|grebrof: can they count to 13?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  THis aggressive lead will cost the defense a trick, and HQ another one, so all of a sudden nine tricks turned to eleven. No big deal in teams though |pg||
nt|haans: scoring blood|pg||
mb|6D|nt|psyck: wonder what 5@s here was|pg||
nt|iceking: 4nt might be even number of aces |pg||
nt|psyck: oh Turbo|pg||
nt|iceking: at least it looks like it |pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably negative|pg||
nt|iceking: been told 4nt shows 3+aces|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, not Turbo then, just their own methods|pg||
nt|iceking: nicely done anyway |pg||
nt|nubmaster: well done here, both K and J in @s works so no trouble with Q of @h offside|pg||
nt|gautis2: not fan of 4@h  ..better to do an invitasional bid after 2@s ...not this "shot"|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is sometimes the problem with strong 1@c - in a contested auction like this, you dont always know if 2@s is a bid with 4 or 5 @ss - now they escaped|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe...|pg||
nt|sharkey: may escape with down 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice to see such a young table in a very strong competition like this|pg||
nt|haans: dont understand @DA now does Fuglestad know who has @DK and Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E can therefore 5NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: good day Juho, its allready 14.00 in finland...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Juho, 2100 in Melbourne|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks and next|pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like one loser in each suit|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|gautis2: y, should  be 200|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - 4 nt told about 4 @ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: after Souths free bid & jump to 4@s, N could have also bid slam other table, but was tougher after opps intervention i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: :( :( :( Gazzilli :( :( :(|pg||
nt|grebrof: lol|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|mbruun:  Back to nine again. Interesting|pg||
nt|gautis2: board 1 was a coopy of 3NT, so well done to both teams|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like the overtrick has gone - much easier for us seeing all cards to make 12 of course|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: Rimsted should have started with Blackwood|pg||
pc|s3|nt|grebrof: otherwise I agree with not bidding 4@h (allthou it looks like P has a single @s) but P only made a single raise - guess they have ways to show a better raise - well, the ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: vulnerability is "right", so can understand 4@h too|pg||
nt|diaoff: Unless color blind, the opps also know the vulnerabilities, so I also vote for 6@D.|pg||
nt|haans: and play must be safe|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: best defense|pg||
nt|diaoff: Thats also easier from here than at the table though...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nubmaster: In Open Marie and Pia get to 4@h which seems to be doomed, especially when E lead a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was a bad play. return @cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and defence will have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not finessing @h first round... doesn't matter if E got the Q alone... E indicates both A and Q of @s because of the play|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|mc|13|nt|iceking: 1@S in closed room was the problem, for sure S should have bidded more powerful bid then 1@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what bid did the damage? other than 6@S:)|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C cue o say|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, good shape, decent 5 carder, & useful touching honors in @c|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah - but as I said more than once in the first match between these: it is easier seeing all hands|pg||
nt|yuval10: not a bad contract at all, but very misfortune breaks|pg||
nt|haans: I|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree she could have bid 6@h on the way|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|mbruun:  I suppose 2D is a very light Multi, but Im not sure|pg||

nt|derric: pass by north?|pg||
nt|derric: i think they play precision|pg||
nt|zebutin: some would bid too, A + J109x seem quite nice values...no support for partner though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wondering. But not much for East - West|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@s was certainly possible|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - we will see|pg||
nt|sharkey: i think the hand was open then Espen - shud have read the ending|pg||
nt|haans: little weak for 3@H|pg||
nt|grebrof: the contract is wrong and there are more failures that awaits when you are there|pg||
nt|grebrof: normal frisky nonul opening from S|pg||
nt|sharkey: that is a WEAK 3@H....|pg||
nt|grebrof: I like it|pg||

mb|d|nt|zebutin: Ahonen has quite bad values for balancing at red zone, even though has decent 6 card suit...but risks are quite high|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No comments...|pg||

mb|2S|nt|iceking: option ofcourse but will catch very bad dummy and on best def will go for 1100|pg||
nt|haans: and spade lead?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Guess she asked for it - now just make it....|pg||
nt|grebrof: this CAN make|pg||
nt|haans: home if hearts better|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: when she doesn't balance it argues bad spades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh dear... system error|pg||
nt|grebrof: N showing 20-21hp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this will probably run to the J, and N will switch to a Major. the question is - which one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: Looks like 140 in sight for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Ah - East wanted to know, which major South had, before bidding 3 NT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Here you'd like to play canap√©, first showing 4c @s and then longer @d but there's no room for that|pg||
nt|grebrof: the good @c-suit being the missing hp|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I bet she is not going to make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even be 170|pg||
nt|haans: Solid bidding by NS|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gautis2: y, fair upgrade|pg||
nt|grebrof: never lead from the J as they say - no leads look appealing for E|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very favourable layout.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yuval10: @s looks reasonable enough|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nubmaster: They play transfer bids over 1@c, ie 1@d=@h etc...|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Careful defense will hold this to nine tricks, if South ducks heart in trick 2|pg||
nt|psyck: not a good start for Iceland|pg||
nt|iceking: might be the worsed possible dummy W could get|pg||
nt|iceking: now @D return and 4 down for 1100|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but major suit wastages were known on bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but couldn¬¥t W suspect bad @s honours on E?|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Christer|pg||
nt|haans: yep my money on that 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is always a wrong line, but ok|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yuval10: you only need from partner something like HXX for it to be very successful. not this time though|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  Alsowithout ducking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if 1@h shows @s - why not bid the 6-card @d?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|iceking: if w was on heat one dummy would be J9xx AKx Ax AJxx and 5@C is easy make |pg||
nt|gautis2: but this will probably fail by 1..  so i presume 4 more imps to Finland,..  I need my coffee..brb:)|pg||

nt|yuval10: hello|pg||
pc|d4|nt|derric: might go down now|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But shouldn't W bid 1@s as 2-3 @s and minimum?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jbgood: anyone for a double from W of 3 @c ? |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sharkey: why @HK - ruff @S and low up better...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|grebrof: the finnish is using reversed carding . the 2 showing an equal number of cards in @cs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|ianmcc: no hope|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  East will not play @C - so 4 tricks to N/S anyway|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Agree Ralf, an error in the system here or a bidding misunderstanding, think it's the first one though|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I'm sure 2@d is conventional here so there was no room for it as natural|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think it is a good slam and noone would have made it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  If your prempts can be such as in this case, partner should me more cautious|pg||
nt|haans: but lucky no clubs lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good play of @H for an additional entry to hand.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: live by the sword - die by the sword....|pg||
nt|cenglund:  be|pg||
nt|haans: Final Norse: lennartj: Norseman=Viking eller nordbo|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: declarer has 7 tricks even without the @d finesse - 2@c, 1@h, 1@s, 1@d, so had South played @d, it was possible that E would just play the Ace|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: oldest of them all|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|derric: conceding down 1 now i suppose|pg||
nt|derric: oh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can¬¥t understand why a 4-card is more important to show than to bid 1@d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|iceking: 800 for 14imps |pg||
nt|nubmaster: But perhaps E will skip the @s and just go for the @ds from the start, it's teams and gamebonus looks really far away|pg||
nt|ralfwil: !¬Ωs10|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c10...|pg||
nt|yuval10: unless NS are playing 2nd/4th carding , then the K@d is marked|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nubmaster: 2@d direct is weak with @ds but she prefered showing the @ss first and then after a possible 1@s/1NT she could've used XY-NT to 2@d|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Cost 7 imp for just a partscore|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Is there a break or something op?|pg||

nt|grebrof: defensive errors like this is something that might effect your play later|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead wudnt matter Hans - stiff...|pg||
nt|grebrof: @c lead does defeat it, but - well not in this case|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I am from old school and I don't accept pre-empts like this in 1st and 2nd hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  N/S have no need for Blackwood on this board - one down...|pg||

nt|diaoff: Should be possible after 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: needed nothing more than 3@D|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - 3@d was a nice bid|pg||
nt|haans: in my book 2nt-3nt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Intial bid has to be a demand bid.|pg||

nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  1 NT is not everybody√Ç¬¥s taste|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@D was 11-16 or (11)12-13bal...so might end up too high|pg||
nt|derric: is north's hand unbal or did she upgrade to 12-13 bal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely|pg||
nt|grebrof: normally the opening would show 10-143-9hp, so I guess they will not get overboard at this table|pg||
nt|grebrof: ooops - 3-9p|pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: very brave 3@D:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: I had a partner who bid preemps like that . sometimes even with 5@cs and only 3@ds - I guess it is an agreement they have|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|iceking: NS are one of the best women pair in europe, been pdship for man years. Icelandic pair has less experience in international events|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: cards well placed here for a few o/t's|pg||
nt|iceking: N with some dubious holdings took the passive view here and didnt compete|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D shows @H|pg||
nt|yuval10: the only way of reaching 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 2@s shouls show a good 3 carder now|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess your guess is as good as any|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sharkey: Dbl = 3 @H|pg||
nt|haans: dbl = 3 spades (sipport doubles more and more popular)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  2 down on a @S-lead, it seems|pg||
nt|mbruun:  I dont mind 5cM for a NT, but a strong suit without the ace is not clear to open 1 NT|pg||
nt|cenglund:  4S is makeable in board 19|pg||
nt|sharkey: this shud make I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: as South denied 4 @s's earlier, the message from 2@s should be clear|pg||
nt|psyck: S has enuf on the auction to make a game try now|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't really understand 3@c from N then, would expect 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: without delay just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: urk|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|ralfwil: can be 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H suicide|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Open 2@C and 3NT.|pg||
nt|grebrof: 0-0 after two boards are scored|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: wonder if 2@s is game-force or invite|pg||
nt|derric: apparantely latter|pg||
nt|zebutin: hearts are well for declarer, everything else little less so...|pg||
nt|zebutin: lead might give 1 @C trick more|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @h and @c friendly|pg||
nt|gautis2: wd Finland, and they have a great start of this game!|pg||
nt|grebrof: reversing with  a single was not the best idea from Marianne Harding it seems|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd Opinion: shogunng: think so Helle plays woidwood|pg||
nt|diaoff: Excl RKC according to CC|pg||
nt|derric: good morning here then|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: easiest a clubs finesse?|pg||
nt|diaoff: Best to play on @H I'd say|pg||
nt|haans: need a lot of thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  In fact, the North hand is no so strong - the @D√Ç¬¥s doubtful values|pg||
nt|mbruun:  With no aces you should subtract 1 HCP from the hand. Good intermediates are a plus on the other side|pg||
nt|gautis2: seems like a not agreed auction in OR|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe she wanted to bid 3@h :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure splinters with only 3card support is the best, but I am not playing this event :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Denmark Sweden now are +7.|pg||
nt|grebrof: hi Juho|pg||
nt|haans: Morning or just now Good night for Denmark|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck: if 4@c instead, they could have possibly landed in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is still making though, so NS did well enough|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1nt-opener didnt know she actually had shown 15-17 already (at the other table)|pg||
nt|haans: may save them|pg||
nt|haans: strong spades in dummy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  Sure - but the @D-doubleton is not so great|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, clubs depend quite much how you play them that how friendly they are...with this lead they are friendly enough|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gautis2: i m sure it was a "slip of the mind" ..happens to all of us :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Right|pg||
nt|zebutin: and seems 3@H + 2@S + 2@C + @D make enough tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: good lead|pg||
nt|haans: play strait and fast|pg||
pc|hA|nt|zebutin: though might go after @D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: Harding have no diamond|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|grebrof: where is the @c K?|pg||
nt|psyck: doubling & then cueing is very strong action, so I think 3@c was ok, so has more than enuf with an A & a K to go to game after that i guess|pg||
pc|hK|nt|iceking: 10 tricks for one imp gain for Denmark|pg||
pc|h5|nt|derric: 3@D 1@h 2@s 2@c would do too|pg||
pc|h6|nt|grebrof: @d K - @s ruff|pg||
nt|haans: North may have AQJ in hertas and @DJ but @SQ?|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|ianmcc: good switch|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, even with playing on @D makes|pg||
nt|grebrof: for some of us more often than for others|pg||
pc|h9|nt|grebrof: well, you are endplayed if the @s-finesse dont work . N playing a @d to the K in dummy|pg||
nt|grebrof: ace - ace - ace - ace|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must discard a @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or a @d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S+@H!+@C=3 for the defense unless the declarer helps the defense.|pg||
nt|haans: yeah Bide|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nubmaster: Yes, no good to just ruff and play ace of @s and then minor cards, S will have a @h left together with a tr|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think South did very well with her hand, to be honest i'd expect N's hand to be AQJX X KTX AKQXX or something like that, then slam is laydown|pg||

nt|grebrof: I guess she led a @d|pg||
nt|grebrof: well played anyway - as kibz suggest - @d A was not a success|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree, S should have opened 2@C. |pg||
nt|haans: bidding it as a NT hand correct for me|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hawe45:  When East bids @S - E/W will buy the contract for sure - I hope...|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C = 11-16 anything|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  West will not believe her eyes when partner bids 3 Sp|pg||
nt|grebrof: good afternoon Christer|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Good morning everybody|pg||
nt|grebrof: I am reporting from Thailand and we are 5 hours ahead of Norway - 4 hours ahead of Finaland|pg||
nt|grebrof: can be 15-177bal|pg||
nt|sharkey: East attempting to interfer|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H would have been natural but 8-11|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps W will just bid 3 NT|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|hawe45:  6 @S is the right bid from West now|pg||
nt|mbruun:  6 Sp right away to apply pressure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We could play together, Mathisa|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Im a little concerned that I agree with you, about the bidding I mean |pg||
nt|ianmcc: close to a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @S would have been a better bid than 5!|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Very difficult for NS to get to the grand. I predict EW will buy it in 6 S X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But this might work - and West will not "sell out"|pg||
nt|zebutin: more or less clear 4@H... but if they feel bold they might even shoot for 6@H...|pg||
nt|zebutin: which isnt the best contract, but i have been in worse...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: tuf to get to game even after drury|pg||
nt|haans: 11-16 in quicker|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 NT focing app|pg||
nt|jbgood: forcing even|pg||
nt|haans: Yes she think so but ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  - not if South bids 7 @C now, Mathias...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: must be odds-on|pg||
nt|iceking: another drury hand|pg||
nt|psyck: S likes hand better after opps bid @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Impressive|pg||
nt|mbruun:  West knows 7 Sp is good insurance, but always difficult to save in a hot aucton like this. She should do it right I think  |pg||
nt|zebutin: 3@S most likely splinter of some sort, Pia might like her hand now because only Axxx in @S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: trump 2 @s and lose a diaamond|pg||
nt|haans: dont like that 2NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: EW getting very exited here :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: hmm, some play something like that or 13-17 in carrot club still...havent seen that working too well... :)|pg||
nt|haans: Multi was biggest at the 80th but still on in Scandinavia|pg||
mb|d!|nt|mbruun:  Well done all around|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From Wests point of view, 7 @S might cost about 500 only - with more @C by East|pg||
nt|gautis2: good result for Norway OR. .. seems hard with heart lead?|pg||
nt|zebutin: sorry, private|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anybody overcall 1 NT with East hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: in the open room, thhe norwegian 1nt opening showing (8)9-12hp|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: Gib says it makes..I have to get MORE coffee:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: their cc says multilandy, so i guess 2 NT asked for the minor..|pg||
nt|haans: blood|pg||
nt|rnmalik: pass and trouble:)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|derric: pessimistic|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@H very agressive and will catch perfect dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: that made S's choice easier, esp with vul game at stake|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Mikael G told me that the operator is new and are in training so we will have some allowance here... and she has no time to comment|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Heart lead is the killer|pg||
nt|grebrof: the small cards in dummy makes it easier to overtake the Q too, cause there are many layout where N will have a @h-suit good enough for it to run later|pg||
nt|gautis2: as I can see, I am agree..|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  No RD, please, that would loose 2 IMP√Ç¬¥s to 2140|pg||
nt|zebutin: well trumps cant be too badly, and with diamond lead neither can any other suits either so has enough entries&etc|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Sry, not Mikael, it was his dad, Johan who told me :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 3@H I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  One @H-trick might "disappear" here|pg||
nt|haans: in a good day acceptable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|derric: trumps 4-1 and @c:s 4-2?|pg||
nt|grebrof: my style is 1@d last hand too - if P cant answer 1@d, you rarely have any game|pg||
nt|haans: jack lead?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yuval10: the (persumably ) weak NT in the OR made many problems to the Swede pair|pg||
nt|haans: yes yout style is my style 2 but not with @CK singel|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|zebutin: something like that most likely is enough|pg||
nt|derric: the @HJT help a lot|pg||

pc|h6|nt|jbgood: Norway went down in 6 @d in OR|pg||

nt|grebrof: well played so far|pg||

nt|grebrof: claimtime|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|iceking: at this vul i think W had to be tempted go for 300 or so in 4@S|pg||

nt|zebutin: double or overcall?|pg||
nt|derric: overcall for me|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe a simple 4@h p/c by W now|pg||
nt|nubmaster: We'll propably se some action here|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In Open EW made a wrong decision to sacrifice vs 5@h but didn't get it doubled which is really difficult|pg||
nt|haans: 1NTx ido not give game score|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Undo|pg||
nt|yuval10: hmmm i think we miss a pass here|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: i must confess i would have just bid 1@S...|pg||
nt|zebutin: even though hand is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Not so far-fetched play given the bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: I frequently played 1nt XX when playing weak nts|pg||
pc|s8|nt|iceking: not so good methods here for ew. |pg||
nt|haans: right, double in my book not hearts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|iceking: for sure W should decl with his holding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 4@c from W = bid your suit under, and contract on the strong hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, some play 4@c |pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead needed I think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  If West finds the killing lead, they will call the police|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Will make in practice|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 1@s could be passed out (but I agree)|pg||
nt|derric: partner is likely to raise on any 3+ support|pg||

nt|iceking: with everything breaking nicely this should make |pg||
nt|gautis2: this seems like a flat boars..  this time I almost bet I m right:)|pg||

pc|sK|nt|sharkey: still time to switch|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|derric: though some pass all 7-counts opposite overcall|pg||
pc|cT|nt|zebutin: mostly matter of partnership agreements and individual bidding style|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mbruun:  With 9 HCP partner is weak, so heart is more natural in teams. Partner cant have a strong spade holding|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck:  will play @h 1st & can fin @s into safe hand later if reqd|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h is automatic in trick 2 in order to take out a possible entry to E's hand|pg||
nt|diaoff: Norway will need some other kind of boards now|pg||

nt|gautis2: 500 is a good score.. 4@h seems like few loosers, but not enough winners?|pg||

nt|iceking: should have no problems stop in 4@H here|pg||
nt|psyck: 5 level is safe too i guess|pg||
nt|iceking: would be good to have 3@H forcing here |pg||
nt|nubmaster: If 2NT shows the red suits why not start with 4@h and then 5@d? But N took it for the minors because of the fact that the 1@c opening is 2+?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I guess without the @s lead, you can possibly make some @d-tricks, but|pg||
nt|haans: system works well here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - think they'll bid slam|pg||

mb|2S|nt|haans: 4@S not doubled Optimal contract|pg||
nt|diaoff: Expected a Dbl there, yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: must start on @d at once to win this - and use @d to pull S's 4th trump - very difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: lucky that N has all the aces|pg||
nt|jbgood: club ace with S and the contract would stand no chance on best def|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: and that is logical if bypass @D with marginal canape hands|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h will now be frcd after 4th suit bid|pg||

nt|gautis2: this play will take sometime..belive me:)|pg||
nt|derric: 2@d = Gf 5+@d4M|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mbruun:  Denmark gained 7 IMP on board 5, because South unblocked her AK of hearts in due time, so 7 Sp X was five off|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a happy spot|pg||
nt|zebutin: well no double... seems like 2 down or something|pg||
nt|grebrof: I assume the 5 from E|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they play count when Q is at the table|pg||
nt|gautis2: not best lead.. may make now|pg||
nt|haans: yep 0-7 is 0-7|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|iceking: so 3@H and now S will deny @S control so should end in 4@H|pg||
nt|iceking: Danish que-bidding style is though little odd at least i have never understood it|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S shows interest in slam perhaps N shud be able to bid it based on @H length and max|pg||
nt|grebrof: Magic Diamond comes from Sweden originally, but many play it in  Finland too - they are more artificial in Sweden-Finland than we are in Norway-Denmark - I have myself sat down ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: that 1@c meant either a) 5-11hp any suit or b) 17hp+ any distribution - conventions like that are not allowed in Norway, but it is fun, isnt it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: East are at the bathroom|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: we see what you mean Magnus :)|pg||

nt|diaoff: Its a tough game...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Yes  - but after a slow start|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This looks like a coffee-board for 420 N/S|pg||
nt|mbruun:  4 Sp seems to be the spot, and its a very natural contract|pg||
nt|psyck: they have to be careful not to get too high here with cards unfav|pg||
nt|haans: but is no ace|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|zebutin: 2@D most likely multi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks with open cards|pg||

nt|haans: not more than 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: In open the Icelandic ended up in 5@d|pg||
mb|d!|nt|zebutin: Johansson has many quick tricks in hand, so didnt want to bid lame 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: or east could maybe dbl 3@D here |pg||
nt|jbgood: Norway had a bye last round - seems like they have problems adjusting to playing again...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what a hand, a nightmare:)|pg||
mb|r|an|(16) 17 +|nt|iceking: 3@D looks alot down 5-6 down|pg||
nt|derric: would you bid the south hand?|pg||
nt|haans: good question what does Pass show now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  North will raise to three, and a well placed DK will make South go to game|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Ah, started to write that before it showed up on the screen, sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have 12 top tricks and it looks possible that you can squeeze your way to the 13th|pg||
nt|psyck:  could there be 13 tricks here with W squeezed in majors?|pg||
nt|haans: How many knows that?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|grebrof: 1@c +15hp|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1@s balanced +9 or 4441|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 3@s is presumably preempting|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 8-11 ? really?|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S the winner|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: did we get the result  of board 2 Johanna?  |pg||
nt|cenglund:  This a better slam than the previous one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: some prospects|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room they got to open 1@H telling 4+ @H and 8-11...and after that sailed to 3nt|pg||
nt|derric: 3NT went down after declarer broke entries in open|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Cards are not lying in favour of making 6NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: I would XX ;)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|zebutin: this lead destroys one entry to @C suit, but give ruffing finese in @S suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: became a winner - 500 was available|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes, you have the values, showing a hand worth 18-19.|pg||
nt|haans: Asplund had cards for double of 2@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gautis2: and they figure it out, so a  stop...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finnish ladies avoided the tempation|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I think the director chosed to let it be (4heartsx-2), but I'm not shore!|pg||
nt|grebrof: not that I can see EW doing something viable over 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may have bid 4@S with West hand - but 5332 distribution is a negative|pg||
nt|santyclz: 29 hcp so it may not be automatic to get there.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|zebutin: so if takes that, she is losing 2@D + @H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Maybe 4@s here|pg||
nt|gautis2: ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: I wouldnt change that board 2 either|pg||
nt|grebrof: but ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: not the best lead here|pg||
nt|grebrof: if there is any|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nubmaster: good bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep, surely not 7... 6 will probably be good enough|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|ianmcc: it removes a useful entry|pg||
nt|psyck: stopping low with a key card missing & the 3@d x|pg||
nt|haans: rersponder tend to make transfers all the time|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont really understand why east didnt dbl 3@D|pg||
nt|iceking: east should know dummy in 3@D dbl will hold most often 0-1@D and very few hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this might be a chance for the Swedes in the OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly left the door open.|pg||
nt|haans: so she may not have understood the Pass|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true, xx @S was acceptable to P.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nubmaster: They must continue @d after the 2 @c to take away the entrance to E|pg||
nt|psyck:  as usual, minor slams with borderline values tuf to get to|pg||
nt|yuval10: using a natural system it looks like 1NT - 2@c - 2@h  - 3@d and then N should lead the way with 3 keycards and a Q of trump|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|psyck: double dummy, you can reel off 8 tricks in the majors & squeeze South in the minors for the rest|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|gautis2: I told it was a close group a while ago, with 2 VP fom 1st to 3rd...  as we speak, it is actually thighter! (1 VP 1st-3rd :))|pg||
nt|haans: but could E have passed with Qxxxxxx and no more|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wrong pitch, I think she needed @cK onside|pg||
nt|zebutin: discarded @C so doesnt have to take @C finese, but @D suit is so lousy they will not raise as any extra tricks, so needs Ax(x) in front of @D K|pg||
nt|rnmalik: doubt, @C honours were the catch and stiff @H.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: yep :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d6|nt|nubmaster: @d now or she makes|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|haans: even 1NT would have been transfer|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam bidding not the strength of the Finnish women in this match|pg||
nt|grebrof: last board was the first nonconquested auction NS had - EW are not known for being shut off|pg||
nt|haans: its not fashion today to pen double|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|vugraphzdq: Vist Gunn says that she would have play different if she had get the correct information and then only loose one trick, so the result only would be down one|pg||
nt|grebrof: if any ladies form Faroe Islands are watching, I hope you soon come up with a team that can compete in this championships - there is a bye in the womens group - shich in my mind it ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: shouldnt|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Game over |pg||
nt|zebutin: ofcourse can still take @C finese if wants to, but little riskier|pg||
nt|grebrof: cant say I think W should dbl again|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hawe45:  South will not hav to fear a singleton @C - in case, this would have been played earlier - and faster...|pg||
nt|derric: so E should lead @c after @hQ to remove choices|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: and now clubs ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|mbruun:  I think 4C directly after 2 Sp will show shortage|pg||
nt|haans: lucky them|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|zebutin: so might be small gain to finns|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S have 3NT|pg||
nt|iceking: S will dbl 2@S i assume|pg||
nt|psyck: S may balance|pg||
nt|cenglund:  In the open room they played 3NT|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Without club lead 10 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: do assume they had no pen double|pg||
nt|jbgood: wow - off the schneid...|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6@H has a chance|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Dealer did not sleep well and not smiling this Sunday morning:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|iceking: now N might gamble on 3nt |pg||
nt|iceking: 3@D could be very wrong give pd like 14-16 hcp and 2-4-3-4 shape and he most likely will pass 3@D even playing leb|pg||
nt|iceking: i bet she will gamble on 3nt, been very agressive so far|pg||
nt|psyck: leb may not apply here anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: can make a lot with majors favorable|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  Does√Ç¬¥nt matter - it forces East to show the suits with control, and 4 @H is a true dream to hear|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Thats true. Might work out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In my world, a doubleton is shortage|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead are not so good|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|iceking: ok 3@H it is have to admit i was not thinking about 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: that is one bid no one could have guessed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not 4@s - at least -1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not off to a good start...|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: looks like lost 2@s 4@d 1@c in open|pg||
nt|zebutin: @D Q helped atleast 1 trick|pg||
nt|grebrof: just as my gf - its her birthday, but she is still cleaning :)|pg||
nt|derric: didn't expect a raise on with cards|pg||
nt|haans: raise with three can cost|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hawe45:  3 rounds of @S - East discarding the @C Queen... voila!|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Thick single some players call it |pg||
nt|mbruun:  Any play for 3 NT here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mathias, please take a look at the defence, I just figured out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6-7 tricks N/S - or so|pg||
nt|jbgood: operator - didnt 3 @h go down?|pg||
nt|haans: understand nothing|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: 2@c and 2 aces|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Well I asked about 4@s last deal if it makes or not, the kibbs say yes and no :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: this contact is no party .. |pg||
nt|gautis2: but no double, no trouble..  probably 3 imps to Finland|pg||
nt|haans: @H5 cannot have the 8 or Q|pg||
nt|psyck: now dummy can be killed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course, there was no indication that @cs were so unevenly divided.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c should be a @d signal|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: and if now returns @D helps 1 more because ruffs winner anyway|pg||
nt|derric: and @d return now would help another|pg||
nt|iceking: another pick-up for iceland here|pg||
nt|grebrof: it is more than a party :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: @cs is just as good as any - or?|pg||
nt|sharkey: looking at all hands - yes...|pg||
nt|grebrof: well. you have 7cards in the suit and "maybe" an entrance|pg||
nt|haans: Harding do not want to play :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol - has to be a black suit I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Not the best start for defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: @S lead.:)|pg||
nt|derric: cards lie well yet again|pg||
nt|haans: they find game by not passing before|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iceking: well judged from east here go low with good @S support|pg||
nt|gautis2: think T was a fail there...|pg||
nt|gautis2: may escape with 2 off|pg||
nt|grebrof: there are reasons for 1nt with Es hand - who knows how many @cs P have - in this case W would not had passed 1nt|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|derric: though can try ruff the 4th anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ???|pg||
nt|haans: @SJ hoping|pg||
nt|haans: not as good|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Vores sidste kampe i dag, kl. 17.40, er Finland-Sverige Open og Norge-Danmark Damer. Yuval will translate for you|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D was tranfer to @H?|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mbruun:  But declarer can only come to eight tricks any way|pg||
nt|jbgood: N has shown 20-21, and 2@d was waiting - showing cards|pg||
nt|diaoff: Not straightforward on a @D lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psyck: if could be a bigger pickup if this goes down, say if dec reads cards wrong|pg||
nt|psyck: well, not more confy ones @d's home|pg||
nt|ralfwil: shorten dummy with @s|pg||
nt|psyck: *now more|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, @s would have been better than @d there|pg||
nt|iceking: iam waiting for undo for this @D return|pg||
nt|psyck: lot of work still to do everywhere|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: a lot easier with all hands in view|pg||
nt|haans: 9 have the 8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|haans: Fuglestad can count|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's making again, if South play @h to Ace then J@h discarding @c|pg||
pc|s8|nt|santyclz: The @s return rather than a @d cost a fatal tempo.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|grebrof: brb - my woman went away on a "businesstrip", so I am doing the laundry . imagine! :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cenglund:  Not a good line of play|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|derric: 7imps to finns|pg||
nt|iceking: would have been better if decl had used her entry to play @C|pg||
nt|yuval10: something like final match today at 17:40 Final-Sweden? :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mbruun:  Forget the 10 IMPs for Denmark on board 8, and the 3 IMP for Norway on board 6. Difficulties in correcting these scores, but they are not right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so far-fetched for West to double 3 NT and take the 800 on a normal @S-lead. If you do√Ç¬¥nt now and then write 750 for the opponents, you hav√Ç¬¥ent doubled enough|pg||
nt|mbruun:  The actual standing should be 20-16 for Norway|pg||
nt|gautis2: dont belive u:)|pg||
nt|haans: good play in spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yuval10: and Norway-Denmark ladies of course|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|iceking: how about @S King now|pg||
nt|yuval10: by the way Roland, my license is for Svensk only :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: this time the @C was a winner - 1 trick difference|pg||
nt|haans: @HJ would have been tricker|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|haans: @SJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hawe45:  Wake-up call - it would be difficult for East to discard the @C Queen on the third @S-round - as East must follow suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|grebrof: yes,this was not good play (or after the @HK) not good defense either|pg||
nt|sharkey: off 2 cud very well be copied OR|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|iceking: now east should fallow with @H 9|pg||
nt|psyck: dec hoping for trump 33 now|pg||

nt|haans: Big Diamonds has its problems|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H not GF I think|pg||
nt|cenglund:  You shouldn't miss this one under any circumstances|pg||
nt|grebrof: allthou these are artificial bidders - it might not be so easy|pg||
nt|haans: Magic Diamonds comes from Carroy Clubs as natural as possible (possible)|pg||
nt|psyck: this should be easier to get also for E|pg||
nt|santyclz: A slam too good for Roland  but sub-par for the rest of us.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Off an ace and qjxx of trump.|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks as if it made on a different defense than we saw.. |pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  THis board wont take long. 450 for EW |pg||
nt|hawe45:  450 both tables, next|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s - at least on this board|pg||
nt|sharkey: as long as N can show @S support shud be in slam|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - N doesnt have a lot to offer besides @s-support|pg||
nt|grebrof: did S show @S now?|pg||

pc|d9|nt|iceking: on normal @C lead its possible win all the tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: it depends over the lead...if the lead is the natural @s lead then it looks like they should go for restricted choice|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: but after a @d lead...|pg||
nt|iceking: creative lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: ty Hans|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Even the grand one is making|pg||
nt|sharkey: S probing - shud keep in mind they have messed up all slams so far|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud this be affecting South now?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I am not saying you should be in 7|pg||
nt|haans: missing @HK they wont|pg||
nt|haans: have they forgotten steps?|pg||
nt|haans: urkkkkkkkkkk|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nubmaster: After this start they will get to slam and make some imps here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice bidding so far:))|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Probably a push board|pg||
nt|gautis2: 3N is reached..seems like a flat board |pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: if the lead isn't @s then you can still make it if the hand with 3 @h's also have 3 @d's|pg||
nt|haans: no @HT good card|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: 3/5th against suit :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: follow with @dQ|pg||
nt|iceking: unbid suit |pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sQ is a keycard|pg||
nt|jbgood: now E gets squeezed in the reds instead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|grebrof: well, its only one board they lost in a slam position - N could hardly do anymore than 4@s now|pg||
nt|grebrof: well done by S|pg||
nt|sharkey: N thinking 7?????|pg||
nt|sharkey: extras :)?|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe its Marianne in E|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hardly - I think|pg||
nt|haans: maybe asking about bids|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  Now 12 tricks possible - in fact easy, South beeing caught in a show-up-squeeze|pg||
nt|nubmaster: The Icelandic kibbs are hoping for the grand, lol|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|psyck: @d ruff will set up a trump trick for only 1 o/t|pg||

pc|h4|nt|cenglund:  I need to leave now, by all|pg||
nt|grebrof: by Christer|pg||
nt|grebrof: or bye - again my thai keyboard tricks me|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@d was asking for singelton, 4@c denied|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jbgood: if S reads it, that is (not evident)|pg||
nt|haans: think declarer take her cards|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - I do too|pg||
nt|haans: its not MP|pg||
nt|haans: but cost nothing|pg||
nt|jbgood: so Denmark is currently leading the pack - Norway 7 VPs behind per now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gautis2: may get 10?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psyck: if 4@s was cue, i'd have expected E to bid slam even missing 1 key card|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: claim 12....|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|santyclz: Now tactically should w play against restricted choice, hoping the slam fails?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzdq: now the director is here, because W got the wrong explanision, but know they decided to wait until afterwards|pg||
pc|d8|nt|grebrof: the last board - looked more of a success playing the @c K at trick 1 - the trumpswitch wasnt a winner|pg||

nt|grebrof: 3nt?|pg||
nt|gautis2: 3@c = bid 3@d if 20-21 NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: its a bad hand in some ways N too - how to show 3 suits after 2@c?|pg||
nt|gautis2: i vote for 1@s opening, but .. :)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  5C seems the best game spot|pg||
nt|grebrof: easier when you see dummy :)|pg||
nt|haans: pass = 0-7|pg||
nt|haans: by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Since 2 D is forcing after 2-o-1, 3D is a Splinter. Similar to the first board, where 2D would have been reverse and strong, so 3D is therefore Splinter  |pg||
nt|mbruun:  3 NT seems to be the evident bid|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Unless she thinks 3D is 55 and strong|pg||
nt|derric: or east protecting?|pg||
nt|grebrof: if bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: possible 3 down here|pg||

mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Thats what happened. Misunderstanding NS|pg||

nt|haans: 2@H weakish|pg||
pc|cK|nt|iceking: they might not play 2 suited overcalls here|pg||
nt|santyclz: To watch multiple tables:  www.bridgebase.com/mobile  Open 1 browser window/table.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: safe contract.|pg||
nt|haans: Expert player do not rebid diamonde with 5 carder|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mbruun:  Or maybe she thinks her hand is good enough for a cuebid. |pg||
nt|mbruun:  Well see|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Board 13 - always difficult|pg||
nt|zebutin: @C Q is sitting nicely, so most likely this wont be any gain for either team...if doesnt try double finese in @S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: My friend came here ti visit me about deal 24 and then the Swedes has make very good. Think he's better than a "hartass" :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3nt it is|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s lead is the best|pg||
nt|gautis2: bet a coke for a heart lead:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: this time, no long suit|pg||
nt|psyck: this could be another swing if they get to a @c contract other table|pg||
nt|jbgood: just for major preference|pg||
pc|c3|nt|grebrof: I would lead @h too|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Last stop for a +-score|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  I have been told, that 6 @C is possible - would you make it Mathias??|pg||
nt|mbruun:  North cant raise without heartcontrol, unless partner hesitates before 5 C. In that case director will be called and the score will be corrected if slam is on. So North did the right thing|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it seems right, probably South will make the 12 tricks here also|pg||
nt|mbruun:  I think 6C is lay down with S K onside. Five spadetricks, six clubtricks and the DA|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Five clubs in hand and a diamond ruff. Shoudnt represent any troubles|pg||
nt|mbruun:  A sneaky spadelead will keep this to 11|pg||
nt|mbruun:  The king might not work|pg||
nt|iceking: have a feeling this will make now|pg||
nt|grebrof: 4@h tricks?|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|pelu: in the "good old days" I would bid 1NT = both unbid suist, but to dau where u open on 9-10 and bid og 3-4 u need 1NT to be strong :)|pg||

nt|yuval10: nice 4@c bid by E, she can imagine that her partner is short in @h but doesn't have too many @s's, otherwise she'd havepre-empt over 1@h in favourable vul.|pg||
nt|haans: i prefer 5@D to xx Have better @D|pg||
pc|s6|nt|zebutin: @S lead could make this hard to handle|pg||
nt|grebrof: hehe|pg||
nt|grebrof: we used to have 69 pages - had been playing 2 years or so... :)|pg||
nt|haans: but not North|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ianmcc: nasty lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: now need to take right views|pg||
nt|derric: E can't get in safely if takes this with ace|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gautis2: with letter size 20?:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: hmmm - evert|pg||
nt|yuval10: this isn't your usual, touch-and-go contract, but when declarer plays AK@d and the Q will drop the path will be clear|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|iceking: but just dreaming this hand is just one of those you cant reach slam playing natural methods|pg||
nt|sharkey: they may have to work to make this...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ianmcc: KISS is the answer - @hAK then @c|pg||
nt|iceking: strong @C system might have better shot|pg||
pc|h5|nt|grebrof: everything was written in detail so my P could remember|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3nt is not a winner|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mbruun:  If defense ducks a spade at some point, declarer is home though|pg||
nt|haans: count hand as 16 p|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|psyck: assuming they play some king of lebensohl over reverse, 3@h showed a better hand than 2N there i guess, still difficult|pg||
nt|ralfwil: difficult to make|pg||
nt|haans: and wait wait wait|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|grebrof: minimum is a lot it seems|pg||
nt|gautis2: I am NOT sure they have 100% agreement in this auction!|pg||
nt|gautis2: if Q ask from N, i bet S says..I DONT have the Q:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: in normal circumstances, N (by going the long way) has already said she has the bunch, so if S doesnt have any more to tell - N can bid 4@h|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|pelu: even Finland after a strong 1@D only bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cover for 2@h tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can make now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cenglund:  A major disaster for the Finnish ladies in the open room|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems that Andersson took the right view and is on her way to making 4@H|pg||
nt|gautis2: she didnt have the @h Q:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: the opponents put some nasty stuff in there too|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree with S|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: discard a @c|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is not more than anything - @h Q or not|pg||
pc|c3|nt|grebrof: P didnt opemn 2@c this time|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gautis2: u know in S that some is wrong, and we are going into BIG trouble....|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: means that declarer plays wrong|pg||
nt|haans: not Big Diamonds??|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: Iceland in 6@H in the open room; well done|pg||
nt|iceking: wow|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like they had a Gazzillish sequence|pg||
nt|iceking: so even now at 44|pg||
nt|grebrof: shit happens here too - good to see for leathal players in this game|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the other room on bd 12 e preempted 5@h(!) and n-s got to 6-1.|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|iceking: in iceland we play the swedish version of Gazzilli called Haxan|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 4c @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but easiest was to cover @hJ|pg||
mb|3S|nt|zebutin: 6@H doesnt seem totally hopeless, but black suits arent breaking even|pg||
nt|psyck: that sounds equally menacing|pg||
nt|iceking: its very simular|pg||
nt|grebrof: normally contested auctions are harder than where you "live in free", but board 30 seemed otherwise - 10 imps to Norway|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is the last board of this match - thanks to all commentators, operator, kibs and to Roland|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW.|pg||
nt|haans: :) Time to thank us and  you and Johanna Vindeful VUGRAPH :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: at least one person is bidding @c naturally here|pg||
nt|diaoff: 4@S looks tricky on a trump lead|pg||
mb|4S|nt|nubmaster: and 4c support with minimum|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board|pg||
nt|gautis2: oh..was going for a coffee...thougt it wasa "claim"|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: or @H for that matter|pg||
nt|haans: simple 4@S     :) We¬¥ll meet again :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: second dbl many play takout here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Double?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Gosh... another one for the Swedes here|pg||
nt|grebrof: obviously N was not strong enough for 1@d|pg||
nt|santyclz: Y, what's wrong with e?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Is it still legal to bid @cs naturally?|pg||
nt|derric: cheap save|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Indeed, thanks Haans:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Why would it be takeout when you are sitting over the suit?|pg||
nt|iceking: S might have forgotten|pg||
nt|sharkey: Have to avoid two @H losers here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mbruun:  EW were caught for 500 in the other room on board 14, so Denmark now in the lead 24-20. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: if can trump 2X@d in dummy it looks OK-ish|pg||
nt|iceking: i play it takout not sure why though, i just fallow orders from my pds dont really think logical about it if its good or bad methods:)|pg||
nt|pelu: for me Ns X = penalty|pg||
nt|rnmalik: non vul 5@D good save.|pg||
nt|haans: next session in 40 minutes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: ant this is a typical example when it¬¥s necessary to act immediately and not intend balance|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Well some kibbs say thieves but you won't get any points placing the green ones at the table eihter|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mbruun:  Good stop by the Norwegians|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's easy to remember. Under the suit = takeout, over the suit = penalty|pg||
nt|grebrof: again: seeing all 4 hands makes you sleep|pg||
nt|gautis2: last board, and seems like this match will end in a friendly score of VP 15-15|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah|pg||
nt|haans: no if they say 17+ hcp they must have 17+ hcp|pg||
nt|psyck: ya minors are dying a natural death, with no one bibbing them naturally anymore|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Last hand, the play resumes at 12.40|pg||
nt|pelu: agree|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Declarer should have played trumps only twice and ruffed the 4th diamond|pg||
pc|hK|nt|zebutin: yes, ruffing diamonds shouldnt be too hard|pg||
nt|sharkey: Best contract here is 5@C I think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|derric: entry problem i think|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|haans: then @HK must be right|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ianmcc: best lead - damages communications|pg||
nt|derric: unless you play @S:s immediately|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|grebrof: thank you all for watching . we tried to be funnier, but us: Christer, Kjell Gaute and me are a boring bunch - we hope to improve with all our jokes at a latter point in time :)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The match is a draw|pg||
nt|grebrof: Jx or single in @ds would made little difference, but ok|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not the contract s dreamed about when she picked up her hand.|pg||
nt|yuval10: down 2 ?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: trump might have worked better - not much went Norway's way in this match - but full credit to the Danes!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mbruun:  130 NS since declarer can dispose of his clubloser on dummies two majortricks|pg||
nt|iceking: most importand you and your pd play it the same way|pg||
nt|gautis2: tx all|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mbruun:  See you soon for more good and entertaining bridge|pg||
