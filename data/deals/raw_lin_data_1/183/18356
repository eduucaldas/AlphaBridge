nt|azwer46: :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: one more effective strategy in recovery matches is the use of PENALTY X|pg||
nt|azwer46: right|pg||
nt|psridhar: a couple of speculative penalty X can bring more return than just the imps |pg||
nt|azwer46: this brd may give a few to India|pg||
nt|psridhar: and a failed penalty X does not increase their lead 2 much ( assuming no XX of course)|pg||
nt|mango joe: he may go more than 2 off by winning in dummy & playing @h to K, his only chance|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sumit was close to a penlaty X here but (1) auction was too confident (2) no trump trick- but if he had chanced he might hv won 6|pg||
nt|mango joe: @hs 3-2 with A onside & trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|mango joe: but @S pips are no good for that play|pg||

mb|1S|nt|sybarra: had a trememdous score yesterday in game,  mostly on defending :)|pg||
nt|ehsana: slam coming up :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: was a live game |pg||
nt|ehsana: 3NT for E/W|pg||
nt|sga1: EW are playing 17+ @C, strong @C system. He could have opened the hand 1@c|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: this looks like a weak 2@D to me|pg||
nt|glen: expect same auction as open room|pg||
nt|rodal f: Prec by EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|alok_daga: so bid 3nt vasanti,|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mango joe: his hand was certainly worth 17+|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vasanti: club 9 stops|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes :)|pg||
nt|khaled_m: Was this a strong NT or upgraded her 14|pg||
nt|ehsana: H lead better|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: some W's would bid 2@S after 2@D here|pg||
nt|ehsana: game safer for E/W |pg||
nt|azwer46: u shd hav whishpered|pg||
nt|ehsana: true|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chick: not me this time, too red|pg||
nt|sga1: definitely that is what he showed his partner.|pg||
nt|vkassam:  1C wud be better. 3D consumed too much bidding space|pg||
mb|p|nt|azwer46: even if @H is led makes no diff|pg||

mb|4S|nt|vasanti: sri lankan missed the slam too|pg||

nt|vasanti: true s here did try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are NS to fight a 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasanti: 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: nice defense :)|pg||
nt|alok_daga: both will feel the pressure when he runs his spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: if they get the @C ruff, 2@Cs, 2@Ds, 2 major aces|pg||
nt|khaled_m: Should be 1 down easily|pg||
nt|vkassam:  the club position is tridky|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: 3NT is cool|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sarkar_suk: thats true :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sga1: 1@c is better if opponents dont interfere as in the last hand. If they do u are unable to show two suits which are easier in natural methods.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Then max was bidded by bought sides. Well done|pg||
pc|c4|nt|glen: no @C ruff but not easy to play to dummy for @D finesse|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|roghog:  Another game NS, but very limited values and I'm not surprised they've chickened out|pg||
pc|cK|nt|darrene: Looks like an easy 13 tricks|pg||

nt|vkassam:  but 11 tricks are there|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: or even had a chance  |pg||

nt|vugraph814: 3NT looks the best spot, not easy to bid to it|pg||
nt|chick: but you are right, he could afford to lose a club so unless 5-0, will make that way|pg||
