nt|athene: sometimes you want to play in the 4-4 fit to get an extra trick but i am not sure that can apply here - if you assume south has 5@S4@D then whatever he has in the other two suits ...|pg||
nt|athene: it will play equally well in spades or diamonds|pg||

pc|h5|nt|athene: i guess if he was 5-5 that could matter|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, west might well have doubled 2@C, in view of the vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: doesn't 3@S show a good hand if 2@H is GF?|pg||
nt|athene: what would it show if north just bid 4@S over 2NT?|pg||
nt|puncher99: i dont play Roth Stone but i would pass the south hand in second seat|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|athene: no aces automatically makes it a bad hand :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Only 8 losers...|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 3@s is not a fast arival style & 4@s would show something else, some particulat shape maybe|pg||
nt|athene: if he leads the @S10 can he pick the suit up?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: he tries the queen because if it wins he can get a club away on a diamond|pg||
nt|psyck: there is the @h ruff threat looming too|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: true, if he had ducked in dummy that makes the heart shift more appealing too|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: actually if 2nt promised a balanced hand, then surely west might have led a heart at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: with the singleton @SA he knows he can give his partner a heart ruff|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|athene: but maybe he doesn't especially want to, since east is pretty likely to have four trumps|pg||

nt|psyck: just ruffing @c's likely line|pg||

nt|athene: well...if all east needed for the grand was @SK @CA you would think he could just use blackwood|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: west has decided the @DQJ are just what the doctor ordered|pg||

nt|athene: did north think they were playing puppet or something?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|santyclz: So trite -- maybe he had a @h in his @ss.|pg||
nt|athene: if you try to win a beer with the @H7 you not only lose a beer but you go down and also establish several revokes|pg||

nt|athene: when you have a wide-open suit, as the spades are here, you really want to lose the lead to your LHO|pg||
