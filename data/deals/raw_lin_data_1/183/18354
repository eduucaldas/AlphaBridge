nt|mango joe: this is the third time this competition is being in India and on both of the previous occasions, Pakistan won|pg||

mb|1C|nt|mango joe: in 1981, those of you old enough will remember that Pakistan got to the Bermuda Bowl final|pg||
nt|azwer46: Pakistan won BFAME last in 1991 with Zia. In1999, they shared the title due to death of a player immediately after start of Finals, game being abandoned, the title was shared by SA|pg||
nt|mango joe: India and Pakistan have each won 6 titles; the last 5 have been won by India|pg||

nt|mango joe: after 1@H bid by West, East cant be blamed for leading his partners suit|pg||
nt|azwer46: yes three top losers in 5@d|pg||
nt|psridhar: problem was India bid @h and perhaps felt committed to leading that suit-another reason for not o/c alling poor suits ?|pg||

nt|vasanti: 25 hcp and sp fit still only 9 tricks unless defence fumble|pg||
nt|vugraphzgm: Welcome Sir :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't it easyer to open 1@H or even 2@C21+?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: had a trememdous score yesterday in game,  mostly on defending :)|pg||
nt|ehsana: slam coming up :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: was a live game |pg||
nt|ehsana: 3NT for E/W|pg||
nt|sga1: EW are playing 17+ @C, strong @C system. He could have opened the hand 1@c|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: this looks like a weak 2@D to me|pg||
nt|glen: expect same auction as open room|pg||
nt|rodal f: Prec by EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|alok_daga: so bid 3nt vasanti,|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|mango joe: his hand was certainly worth 17+|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasanti: club 9 stops|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes :)|pg||
nt|khaled_m: Was this a strong NT or upgraded her 14|pg||
nt|ehsana: H lead better|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: some W's would bid 2@S after 2@D here|pg||
nt|ehsana: game safer for E/W |pg||
nt|azwer46: u shd hav whishpered|pg||
nt|ehsana: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: not me this time, too red|pg||
nt|sga1: definitely that is what he showed his partner.|pg||

pc|c4|nt|vasanti: sri lankan missed the slam too|pg||

nt|rodal f: Are NS to fight a 2@S?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vasanti: 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: nice defense :)|pg||
nt|alok_daga: both will feel the pressure when he runs his spades|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|glen: if they get the @C ruff, 2@Cs, 2@Ds, 2 major aces|pg||
nt|khaled_m: Should be 1 down easily|pg||
nt|vkassam:  the club position is tridky|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ehsana: 3NT is cool|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sarkar_suk: thats true :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sga1: 1@c is better if opponents dont interfere as in the last hand. If they do u are unable to show two suits which are easier in natural methods.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Then max was bidded by bought sides. Well done|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|glen: no @C ruff but not easy to play to dummy for @D finesse|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roghog:  Another game NS, but very limited values and I'm not surprised they've chickened out|pg||
pc|h8|nt|darrene: Looks like an easy 13 tricks|pg||
