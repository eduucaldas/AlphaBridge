nt|bjacobs: yep, it sure is dangerous to cross the street|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  one clue was that East could not have 4@h because he responded 1@s|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bjacobs: I don't mind the non heart lead if something else was more attractive.  But leading from 3 small clubs is just a wild shot in the dark|pg||
mb|1D|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if the hearts were A-Q-10-x, there would be more of a case for the non-heart lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: To a degree, the non-heart bid from East was balanced by the non-2@C bid from West.  But really, this is a situation where you should not overthink|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yorkbeach:  when the spot cards are poor, declarer probably has a stopper whether you lead into the king or not|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: Play suspended, TD goes to check the Open Room|pg||

nt|yo_yo: was it the last european where england was sitting wrongly and it wasnt discovered till the end of the set?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: that will give commentators time to calculate if 4@h makes, if he's allowed to play it!|pg||

nt|pjs_ch: and a 9 card fit is easier in some ways but if you have to ruff two spades you might miss the chance to ruff three hearts|pg||

nt|dburn: still, might not be so easy for the defenders to cash out|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|c5|nt|pjs_ch: It's a most weak suit in which to overcall btu with a 5431 shape you do want to bid|pg||
nt|dburn: although North knows enough to cash the club next, at least|pg||
nt|dburn: unless West would ask for a club stopper with a void in clubs and nothing in spades, which seems unlikely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Lindsay's pondering this|pg||
nt|dburn: Burns ought to give count, not attitude, if North plays @cA next|pg||
nt|dburn: but I guess his signal will be the same in either case|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: the CC says standard count so yes|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: it appears Gunnar forgot the system, 3@s explained as @h slam try - he's explaining now to opp what he thinks he has.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I suppose North is worried that JH has 16-18 balanced and therefore not enough for a slam|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: Luck passes as fast as he can|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: hardly with a strong nt on his right|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: better cover that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: indeed!|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@s not a bad contract, but an unlucky lie of cards|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: i can see 6 tricks|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6 ok but 7 will be a struggle I think|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: Dixon has just a bit too much to pass 3@C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Silverston's first declarer play of the set|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c was apparently forcing - this looks like a variation on Godzilla|pg||

pc|s9|nt|dburn: well done by Lindsay - if spades were 3-2 onside he would not need that position for his contract|pg||
nt|dburn: so he guarded against @sQx with East|pg||

mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: she also played in the lady milne|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: you weren't at this morning's CR session, David :) Finished at 12:46, 106 min for 14 boards :)|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a very good slam for East-West, but the auction may be complex and the pace may slow a little|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i would have been tempted to raise @H there|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yo_yo: the scorecard looks depressing for NI|pg||

nt|mcarroll: 3 Aces to lose - no hope for a 4th trick|pg||

nt|dburn: sorry - had forgotten the style; just bid Blackwood and then...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: gosh lots of women  - well not lots  |pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: not sure I heard explanations correctly but it'll be on the CC :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: last night there was a very unlucky 7@c / 7@s contract|pg||
nt|dburn: looks like a specific-king asking sequence rather than wholesale|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Both partners held AKQT9x facing xxx in their suits|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case East may bid 6@h to ask for the king of those|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Both suits broke 4-0 offside, the defender having Jxxx|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: if partner has 11  then game possible|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Holland looks at @hK, then @c2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Sir Victor ( as he is known) might be tempted to glare at Dixon this time|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|jcomyn: well Kath so few women are over 60!!!|pg||
nt|dburn: good decision - a grand slam that needs 3-2 trumps is just about worth bidding, but only just about|pg||
nt|dburn: if it needs anything else at all, it enters the dodgy category|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: i believe the average age of the US player is 68 years|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i assume  it's similar here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: McDowell ruminates|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: this is a true story - a dublin golf club advertised an open event fo ladies over 60 - they got 6 entries|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they shouldnt have passed out 19 for a start|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: and this one needs something else - either a favourable diamond break or a club finesse|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|dburn: both of which exist, but that 3-2 spade break...|pg||

nt|pjs_ch: looks a respectable 4@h here but the bad diamond break makes it v difficult|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|dburn: still, even if in theory they could, in practice most of the time they would not|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i prefer 2NT to show the 2 suiter|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me too|pg||
nt|granguru: a normal @H lead reduces declarer to 7 tricks in NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: whoa, I didn't foresee that bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcarroll: yes - especially with such a good quality @D suit|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i dont like it!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: depends how you play 2NT - I favour "weak or strong"|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: needs a perfect defence from here?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it does - in theory this now has no chance, but in practice....|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: perhaps he didn't like NT because of the doubleton heart?|pg||
nt|granguru: a better spot to land but @C are ruffed in the long side...not good|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer to show my balanced hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I preferr a 5-4 fit |pg||
pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: ammunition  ......?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: players have now noticed they skipped 25|pg||
nt|granguru: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I suspect they don't have checkbacks available, but I could be wrong|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: why not 3@D over 3 @C?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: I'm not so sure - I like to play 2N as clearly obstructive/weak or clearly constructive/strong|pg||

nt|granguru: Is there a chance?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: forcing but some play 3@C as t/fer to @D|pg||
nt|granguru: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: that would be useful|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: we're getting chat from patio outside|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: why did north lead K@D, did i miss something?|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps declarer just played a diamond to the ace|pg||
