nt|sfoxa:  oops...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: have we a problem|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can't appreciate N's switch, but supposingly, he has a reason for it. |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now it's up to E|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the obvious reason is to cut off the dummy, but having decent @c trick, why doesn't N retrurn partner's suit - @d?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|passell: looks like deutch had his rose colored glasses on here|pg||
nt|gulyas: really, a simple double followed by a cue sould have been enough|pg||
nt|gulyas: or at least pass the 4@S|pg||
nt|passell: might have defended 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|bessi2: unfortunately we didn't get to see Larsen's decision over 2@h dbl|pg||
nt|gulyas: its only 500|pg||
nt|bessi2: I prefer pass,  but it is by no means automatic in my view|pg||
nt|passell: against 450 or 420|pg||
nt|sybarra: got off to ok lead for n/s |pg||
nt|sybarra: gave nothing away |pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah he didnt play the ace|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Hello all.|pg||
nt|taliga: We start the second section with a dull 4@h|pg||
nt|taliga: Hi Rodal|pg||
pc|c5|nt|passell: his only legitimate make is both dia honors onside|pg||
nt|passell: or catching 3 spades in the weak 2 bidders hand|pg||
nt|psyck: At this vul, 2@h-x-pass could well be the favorite|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree|pg||
nt|daman: I would have played a low @H towards the King at trick 2   while I still had the @S entry|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly would force S to make a quick decision |pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no problem in 3nt either but then E dopesnt know that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: everything works|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi John|pg||
nt|chick: well, double dummy it does :)   the club finesse doesn't|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: with the cards this favorable game might conceiveably be made|pg||
nt|daman: ouch|pg||
nt|daman: mind you   it would have probably come to this in the end game|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|passell: looks like down 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: he could make with W having 3631, and @SJ9 doubleton in E|pg||
nt|passell: yes exactly or both dia onside and east forgetting to cover the 9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: welcom -- sorry for the slightly late start|pg||
nt|granguru: Jan Paulissen, also a WIM, is ranked 161. started in 1990 becoming 7th in the 12th youth european championship|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gulyas: cash 2 trumps, and cash all @Hs, ruffing 2 @Ds in hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mark and Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You'll get more, don't worry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This was the last table up because the operator opened an invisible one by mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's why we don't have a result on board 1 entered|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and no names yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Susan will catch up, eventually, please be patient|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Sometimes best if no one knows your name|pg||

nt|bessi2: at least -3 it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Except Diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All good now, thanks Susan|pg||
nt|passell: with a club lead and dia return east has to find the heart shift|pg||
nt|roswolf: a filthy opening even 3rd in hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk4: 2/1 for N-S, Precision for E-W|pg||
nt|bessi2: good decision by Diamond to pass 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 13-15|pg||

nt|sybarra: be lucky you are blasted off of bbo for using that word.|pg||
nt|daman: is 3@D a transfer bsck to @Hs?|pg||
nt|sybarra: >if you are not blasted off |pg||
nt|daman: Roland took it on the chin recently   I had a lot of Flanneryites with me when commentating|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: making |pg||
nt|karesz:  did you bid 3 NT by N?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: killing lead|pg||
nt|karesz:  yes!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No never! 3@h for me|pg||
nt|taliga: so N decision of bidding 4@s immediately is a bit strange for me|pg||
nt|rodal f: Luckely no X.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfj: thx|pg||
nt|gulyas: weird lead|pg||
nt|passell: yes  very aggressive against this bidding|pg||
nt|bessi2: I like it.. his prospects with jx in @s aren't very exciting|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I would probably have lead a @c myself... a @h is out of the question in my view|pg||
nt|passell: I also like a club|pg||
nt|passell: diamond in a way makes the defense fool proof|pg||
nt|roswolf: going for the throat|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 76 e/w in the other room bid and made 3nt for a 7 imp pickup|pg||
nt|granguru: frederic in fact.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i fancy defence here|pg||
nt|puncher99: low diam off table south should play king|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Pekka Viitasalo|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ben Thompson|pg||
nt|benjent: Hi everybody|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day ben|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: sorry -- we had some difficulties setting up but should be good to go now -- welcome all|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi|pg||
nt|puncher99: south is wondering who has spade k|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with max 14 points on opener.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: yes, cannot go wrong now|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 8 tricks here...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: might make 3 on the same lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|puncher99: or how to untangle suit if pard has it|pg||
nt|bagman: S should play the Q in most cases (except when the lead is singleton)|pg||
nt|taliga: son only 200 :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, declarer gets an easy life|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|frankaus: very fine bid by Hampson|pg||
nt|roswolf: about to have some with my dinner|pg||
nt|taliga: so|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: on a @C lead, a @D return looks natural, and E has to find the @H switch|pg||
nt|passell: after a club lead west should return a trump to make things easier for partner later in the hand|pg||
nt|karesz:  wow!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S could be hardly blamed for spade opening lead - but if one respects the opps, (s)he makes imagi nation working|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This board confirms, that you should have better suit quality for 2 @S - the @C-lead would have been better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: bd 16 they did pass 2@Hx, collecting the mentioned 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the @S may easily block but declarer runs out of tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: He just needs to see what developes after that|pg||
nt|puncher99: now is the key play|pg||
nt|bagman: N can duck also, I think, if S plays low|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a little help from my friends.....|pg||
pc|d9|nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: and probably a flat bd|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|passell: the contract on the 1st hand was indeed 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 12 to Diamond, taking the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes playing on diamonds brings home the bacon|pg||
nt|daman: this is a lot different lead than the @C Ace and King|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he cashes @H's might come home now in ruffing mode |pg||
pc|d6|nt|puncher99: its easier to cover the j then to play the king with low one led|pg||
nt|chick: a threatening lead, but 8 tricks off the top now|pg||
nt|granguru: is ranked 3454 and has 6 MPs ...partner in not registered yet. |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bagman: N cashes the spade and switches according to S's suit preference|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bagman: If heart, declarer wins that, plays the @DA and and later pushes the @CQ thru south|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a series of avoidance type plays|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much for Diamond to play, but the cards are very friendly and he' s very likely to make the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: a very quiet bd in the other room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: only a d causes any problem|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen:  "Everything is working - running out of finesses"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: agree pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: When S starts thinking, Diamonds hopes get up|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he only needs the @DK to drop :) (so that he can get back to dummy to cash his namesakes)|pg||
nt|puncher99: hand much harder to  play if diam K was played at trk3|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H as a good raise or ask for @H hold a better bid. At least a stop in 3@S|pg||
nt|daman: this is a strange way to play it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E sold red two-suiter and spade stopper, so he's short in @c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now @c danger persuades declarer to play @h form top dropping the Q|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: sorry|pg||
pc|c8|nt|granguru: Frederic started to play for sweden in 1984 at the 9th youth european championship in Hasselt|pg||

nt|karesz:  Szabo did not believe himself|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: against a nice discussion between Elinescu and Wladow at the table :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: a misfit but NT loks best|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I have seen ppl open 4@H on such a hand in this vul:)|pg||
nt|passell: yes  young and bold ones|pg||
nt|passell: or old and desperate ones|pg||
nt|bessi2: west's hand is pretty vulnerable.. I would simply raise to 4@h giving up on slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Tough position for NS in the auction, and they'll be worried about the double-game swing out|pg||
nt|roswolf: lead changes hands again|pg||
nt|sybarra: just the bid N wanted to hear |pg||
nt|jbgood: they (Sylvan and Wrang) just finished the Nordic Ch.ship - came 2nd 1 vp behind Norway and 1 vp before Iceland|pg||
mb|1C|an|15+|nt|passell: yes if you think what partner needs for slam|pg||
nt|frankaus: Greco had 7 losers  - i would expect 6 |pg||
nt|rodal f: Some ffun to come? A hard slam but EW need it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: disaster struck again on bd17|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  does it make sense? I know the answer, not so NS, it seems.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sommer: friday night dinner with ketchup?:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats a strong 2 - what system|pg||
nt|tomi2: I am not sure what system is on now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT - doÂ´nt care about a @S-stopper|pg||
nt|tomi2: north's 1@C is natural if they play natural in that seat or the strong 1@C if they play strong club or he mixed it up|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H MUST be played by South|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: in non-vulnerable, 1@c is 15+|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the only outcome of all the discussion at the table is one and the same all the time: partner becomes angry, but not aware (or awake).|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW got into the auction, but played their worst suit, going for 500 in 4@Dx|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11H IS CONTRO;S?OR A TRANSFER?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may get passed |pg||
nt|daman: I always bid my six card major rather than my 4 card minor in this sequence|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, thx|pg||
mb|3S|an|RCKB !h|nt|bagman: EW likely to end in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher99: shows spades|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that 1@H was positive balanced|pg||
nt|viren169: anothe dble by greco?|pg||
mb|4H|an|2KC + !hQ|nt|roswolf: iam told 8-11, no 5@S|pg||
nt|motu: 3@S is KCB for S|pg||
nt|motu: hi all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: a trump lead seems safe from west's point of view|pg||
nt|passell: yes when they had a make in 4clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: But it's down by a @C ruff.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Martin|pg||
nt|motu: 4@H 2+@HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: thats reversed to Martens' idea to play strong club non-vuln but natural vuln when your opps are more likely to preempt you after 1@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hallÃ¶chen|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: hi Martin, welcome!|pg||
nt|tomi2: all contracts possible now in this partnership, 4@H, 6@H or 7@H|pg||
mb|4S|an|relay|nt|bessi2: it could be disastrous of course but not on this deal|pg||
nt|rodal f: NT they will not find, but there are 12 by the layout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 2n=leb or scramble I guess|pg||
mb|5D|an|!dK or single or void|nt|chessmaste: Least dangerous perhaps - and I would rather underlead one of my aces than try a diamond|pg||
nt|bessi2: @d 7 is also a very normal lead imo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As I allready mentioned: 3 NT is often good|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Didn't find there best major but not unnatural endstation.|pg||
nt|daman: my 6 card suit needs to have texture though|pg||
nt|sybarra: you certainly "live" in the ht suit in this hand |pg||
nt|daman: if this hand makes....look for a star in the East|pg||
nt|daman: or poor defenders|pg||
mb|5H|nt|viren169: looks like leb|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive many would bid 4@H at Es first bid. Is the best by long term. Then slam is off for W here.|pg||
nt|motu: 4S ask for kings 5@D= @DK|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: normal contract|pg||
nt|viren169: this is destined to go 1 down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 9 rather easy tricks|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Read more|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now 10|pg||
nt|karesz:  weak two 2 @S it is funny for me |pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: there is merit on that hand in bidding 4clubs  as partner can still convert to 4diamonds if he is 5-4 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe E should have bid a scrambling 3NT, not sure if they have that available in that situation tho:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: killing the @h trick, hoping for a promotion|pg||
nt|benjent: In practice, Wolpert can now pick up the trumps, although he may not|pg||
nt|benjent: The cross-ruff is going to be a lot more appealing|pg||
nt|viren169: with 2@S likely to make another flatish bd|pg||
nt|hawe45:  N/S are right, when 4 @H is no winner, try something else|pg||
pc|sA|nt|taliga: Declarer can guess every card (after the bidding), and still it will not be enough|pg||
nt|taliga: 2 spades, 1 diamond, and a heart he sees going to the wrong way - at least|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bessi2: I totally agree with there being merit in bidding 4@c on that last hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: more than just merit even|pg||
nt|daman: given the terrible distribution     it might take a bit longer to play this hand than usual|pg||
nt|jcomyn: obviously meant to be weak but hopw can that be a weak 2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|passell: the modern way of thing bidding diamonds over clubs at any level is conversion  not extra values|pg||
nt|roswolf: must lose the 2 black aces|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|karesz:  with this good hand and short @S|pg||
nt|taliga: and now a club...|pg||
nt|sybarra: cards wont change,  my guess is Tom formualted and plan and went for it |pg||
nt|daman: the East player    Kaminski    plays a lot in the USA|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying to think of who is pard is in US |pg||
nt|daman: Fred Hamilton?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes think so |pg||
nt|sybarra: I operated for them in Philly I believe (Or as least Kaminski) |pg||
nt|daman: when he plays on BBO   Kaminski has the US flag on his profile|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@s is 10-13 and 6 cards http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/FWJS.pdf|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bagman: At some point N grabs the @CA and shoots back a spade. S should not duck|pg||
nt|tomi2: can he read partners 2 as encouraging here? nice board for udca players :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|jcomyn: oh right 10-13 6 card suit apparently|pg||
nt|chick: thanks Jon :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No swing against 4 @H - 1|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: 4c was key card i think|pg||
nt|passell: maybe steaming a little after going for numbers on 1st 2 hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it´s better with a rather good 6-card major and only a little beside|pg||
nt|daman: what would North have done had South rebid 2@H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=14366|pg||
nt|sybarra: another one |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe hits the deck |pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Well this is fun - the dealing machine is spitting out some nifty shapes!|pg||
nt|sybarra: on rebid of 2 @H |pg||
nt|daman: 3NT was weird|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder what E would do holding 4-card h suit |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|chessmaste: Another dull looking deal|pg||
nt|benjent: Several ways to approach the East hand. I like Hampson's choice (and I'm sure he'll be relieved to hear that :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D i expect from Hamson - traffic lights are green|pg||
nt|benjent: I don't - he's made his choice with 3@h. I expect he'll hope he's done the damage already|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably reach 4@S|pg||
nt|bagman: Two hearts and a diamond to lose in 4 @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: BBO-TV if any would like to look at open room as well as here: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: 5+h's gf|pg||
nt|benjent: It looks to me like Wolpert wants to make a bit of a slam try. I think that's optimistic.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: susan ross in las vegas - hi all|pg||
nt|jtmckee: choice of games on the spade finess|pg||
nt|granguru: easy 4@s here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gulyas: wow|pg||
nt|bessi2: I really hate this 4@s bid I must say|pg||
nt|gulyas: I was trying to be nice:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: but it will do its job.. Diamond will probably just drive to slam|pg||
nt|passell: it may work well  after he shows up with the spade ace he may play north for the dia king and go down in slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: are we live now?|pg||
nt|puncher99: mite b goin to 4hrts|pg||
nt|puncher99: if they find 44|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing a good raise|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Susan|pg||
nt|karesz:  Precision 16+|pg||
nt|chick: or 4@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good double fit and trump well placed|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 5@c NS just 500...|pg||
nt|granguru: obviously E is considering alternatives|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes jon but why would E suspect his partner held 4h unless part of system|pg||
nt|chick: I suspect North won't take the save .. S preempted with a whole lot of defense|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3nt wrongsided over there in 2, another swing for Turkey|pg||
mb|d|nt|gulyas: slam is makeable, agree, but its hard|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 4h but not 4s|pg||
nt|caitlin: Board 105...can't make 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: bd 105 or 106?|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 105|pg||
nt|caitlin: 106|pg||
nt|taliga: an easy to bid 4@s with bad breaks in the main suits... |pg||
nt|sybarra: is this a club system?|pg||
mb|2N|an|4!s's + maximum|nt|passell: they play this says he wants to bid|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak is going to overcall 3NT with worse hands than this. 3NT could easily be the last making spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: they might but imo should not|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart game more tricky|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 11-14NT for NS.|pg||
nt|sybarra: that we are watching |pg||
nt|daman: NS can make 2@S|pg||
nt|daman: I doubt it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bessi2: I prefer rdbl with north hand.. never learned to raise pd with only 2card support|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Agreed|pg||
nt|granguru: well N can also be thinking on a 5@C bid...or has already done|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E doubles and folds his cards:)|pg||
nt|benjent: Back on Hampson - once Wolpert moves over 3NT, the payoff structure changes a lot for Hampson. Now it's attractive to get his 2nd suit on the table ... and he did|pg||
nt|viren169: re|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tkx Daniel:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I am the sponsor for the best lead-directing double of this tournament: North is a candidate|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: this is there way of showing the biggest 5 heart bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: W obv inviting slam with this sequence|pg||
nt|psyck: W shows his slam interest by passing & pulling the x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: x was alerted, can't read it|pg||
nt|ybob: re :)|pg||
nt|viren169: a t/out dble would have been more interesting!|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 106 is correct|pg||
nt|jtmckee: sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i don't have it anymore|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3@S limit in hearts with spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, 4th place it's 12-14:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and othervise too they should have a 5+crd suit to bid 1nt with 11p|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 nt a bid strange (imo)|pg||
nt|daman: 1@D seems wet|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: The open room is playing board 65 so we'll be live soon|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 nt keeps n/s out of spade contact |pg||
nt|chick: no reason to expect anywhere near this much from his partner|pg||
nt|granguru: and E was considering doubling  or bidding 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: i think so too, but its not clear, screens are here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not the best lead|pg||
nt|granguru: after the lead a success for Netherlands|pg||
nt|hawe45:  :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sommer: I just had a nice tenderloin with new potatoes..no ketchup:)|pg||
nt|ybob: E-W can win 3NT |pg||
nt|jtmckee: 4 s can be beat with a d tap|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Could I ask? Was the double of 2 @H alerted - maybe by North himself?|pg||
nt|tomi2: Germany set 6@h doubled|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bessi2: did that actually happen ?|pg||
nt|gulyas: x probably just showing minimum|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure east would have accepted with @dk instead of @c Q so this was a very good decision by diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm 4@H needs care|pg||
nt|rodal f: 11 or 12 tricks? 11. Next|pg||
pc|d4|nt|caitlin: which one Jay?|pg||
nt|karesz:  1 @s balanced 8-12|pg||
nt|sybarra: wouldnt you compete to 3 @D |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well I don't think much of the second double, but E/W should emerge with a plus|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 3   I am informed that if South rebid 2@H, North would bid game since it shows a better hand.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: -3oo now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bagman: Now the @DA and a low back|pg||
nt|viren169: spade lead may defeat 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: not sure if duck first trick|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bessi2: I must confess that I would have blackwooded in a heartbeat|pg||
nt|passell: good 6nt on the bidding|pg||
nt|ybob: or second trick too|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gulyas: he can play low, he is in 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you paly that the cuebid promises 3 spades the west should bid 3@S over 3@H to suggest a poor quality @H suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: same auction in other room|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can see two probable heart losers; he cannot afford not to finesse|pg||
nt|puncher99: 3n was cold|pg||
nt|jtmckee: so good result for n-s|pg||
nt|karesz:  3 @d show distribution 3-4-2-4|pg||
nt|karesz:  @h is the best lead, but decl has 9 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|daman: NS play a 2M opening as constructive.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|frankaus: marked @C possition 3 @S 5@C 3@D 1@H|pg||
nt|jtmckee: this one|pg||
nt|karesz:  Szegedi is not the fastes player of the World|pg||
nt|karesz:  nor is CsehÃ³|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: by north maybe, but i was at the other screen side|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ybob: win and @D ...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bessi2: indeed... seems to be by far the safest line|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @HA|pg||
nt|taliga: y|pg||
pc|sA|nt|passell: good sing 10 of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wb Mike|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 106 made|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 106 was mistake|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR     North/South ended up in 3@H   -1|pg||
nt|granguru: 8 possible swing IMPs|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|passell: making 6 is easier in 5  than in 6|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day mike|pg||
nt|tomi2: 30 imps on 3 boards, I promised some action bridge - here we are :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even 6 @H RD in board 3 would have gained a lot...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chessmaste: Covering was a mistake I fear|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes,  and in a spot where playing low was pretty standard|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: indeed|pg||
nt|bagman: S probably holds at least one of the high hearts|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: sneaky|pg||
nt|rodal f: New @H and 8|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|granguru: yes -3oo reflects better the result than -300|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|viren169: with the @cs breaking 3@D looks like 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bessi2: I can't get over the bidding.. let alone west's second dbl which is bad imo, but east sitting in the dbl is beyond my understanding|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bagman: I think that the low heart was an illusory safety play|pg||
pc|sK|nt|puncher99: run the spades now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: the contract is cold|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer needs all three spades and a club to live|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is this ridiculous pace normal for these teams|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ybob: only @H lead from N defeat 3NT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|psyck: some invert the meanings of pass & double in forcing pass situations|pg||
nt|chick: well, bridge is a game in which you are Supposed to think :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chessmaste: He can overruff and claim after drawing the trump|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s8|pc|h7|pc|dK|pg||

nt|benjent: Goodness me. The dealing machine is still set on "goulash" :)|pg||
nt|passell: hi all|pg||
nt|sommer: a-live:)|pg||
nt|sommer: live!|pg||
nt|roswolf: good always good to see some real bridge|pg||
nt|granguru: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome John |pg||
nt|daman: Hey John|pg||
nt|granguru: gm|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT should be an easy task - especially after a @S-bid from South|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North has NO weak 2 in @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|karesz:  12-16 balanced, if 16 no 4-card major|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes cornelia but if i played at that pace i would fall asleep|pg||
mb|1S|nt|passell: just more random quiet hands here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be uncomfortable|pg||
nt|jtmckee: makes 5d n-s|pg||
nt|taliga: precision style bidding comes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Funny cards but only partscore as the best. EW in @H for 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 3nt looks likely here|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl seems natural|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 1H pass 2@H pass pass pass|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Vugraphzfj: was not doubvled need to correct|pg||
nt|benjent: NS are going to have to tread carefully here|pg||
nt|bagman: A bit untypical weak two with void, 4 controls and just a so-so suit; in strong club context 1@H could be considered|pg||
nt|ybob: 140 here|pg||
nt|viren169: best to pass with a mis-fit|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5@D|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow he passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|karesz:  a lot of tricks now|pg||
nt|jbgood: dbl now by Wrang|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@H both majors|pg||
nt|granguru: sorry 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 1@h 12-14 balanced|pg||
mb|2N|nt|passell: yes 3nt very likely|pg||
nt|passell: maybe 4nt|pg||
nt|benjent: 2@s was GF, but Kranyak will still feel he has plenty in reserve|pg||
nt|passell: very difficult for Kran to pass here|pg||
nt|benjent: Yeah, easy 4@c bid|pg||
nt|daman: he will try 3@D for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm,  we will need some assistance on the bidding (or at least I will)|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@H is strong with @Hs or 12-14 HP|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 NT - must be a joke...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Oh well|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump switch?|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed pekka|pg||
nt|ybob: 11 now|pg||
nt|viren169: defense need to be quick to hold it to 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|viren169: but not on that lead!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|passell: maybe he will pass 4nt  very difficult|pg||
nt|daman: oh   sorry|pg||
nt|granguru: now comes ALL PASS|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: yes, now it is 12-14 balanced, because of 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2@D was a transfer|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: I like 4@h ... if Wolpert gets the message. His intention is clearly to say "excellent @c's, @h control, bit worried about them there @d's"|pg||
nt|passell: no more plus score available dont see a 10th trick in nt|pg||
nt|benjent: But without explicit suit agreement, this is the kind of auction that can descend into a series of cue-or-signoffs very quickly|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like the same 11 tricks as the OR|pg||
nt|ybob: not sure if he play to 11, K@D @S to  k@S and low @C ?|pg||
nt|granguru: interesting transfer made by the strong hand|pg||
nt|granguru: "strong"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  My grandmother would have bid 3 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: 2@h will make easily enough|pg||
nt|passell: with the normal dia lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a little bit passive from W in my opinion|pg||
nt|rodal f: They don't use controls at the answering hand I see.|pg||
nt|daman: on this side of the pond the auction would go.....1@S - 1NT - 2@C - 3@C - all pass|pg||
nt|granguru: probably passable if p is weak long in @D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|benjent: They'll be lucky to escape a X now|pg||
nt|passell: the dbl is about to begin|pg||
nt|passell: I predict 6nt dbl down 2|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Hamson will X 6@C|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert's cheapest action now is the impossible pass :)|pg||
nt|passell: or 6nt|pg||
nt|passell: dont like forcing to slam  too likely partner has a stiff club|pg||
nt|taliga: no, it became quite natural|pg||
nt|sybarra: if pard (N) has the long diamond hand and bids 2 @D, you pass and wish him luck |pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully arriving undoubled|pg||
nt|motu: in my opinon it depends on how they play the 2@D bid|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chessmaste: The 5-1 trump break will annoy declarer, but the contract is in no danger |pg||
pc|hT|nt|passell: would bid this way with the Q of clubs |pg||
nt|frankaus: no X  :)|pg||
nt|benjent: And with the Red preempt, likely that @c aren't breaking kindly|pg||
nt|passell: yes |pg||
nt|passell: he may be thinking of 6nt to protect ruffs and the dia Q|pg||
nt|passell: seems like he should  now the dbl will come|pg||
nt|granguru: this contract will probably go -1|pg||
nt|granguru: 3 rounds of @Cs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|karesz:  against a 15-17 NT W will have invitation hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 points and a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|karesz:  or gameforcing:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-treatment will be interesting -maybe|pg||
pc|s3|nt|passell: oops|pg||
nt|passell: dbl for sure|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer has 2 spades, diamond and 4 hearts going one down against a careful defense|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Wladows lead killed an antry|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The winning line is not so far, @D to the 10 and right @C-guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru: declarer will go on a cross ruff process as much as defense permits him|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|passell: down 1 likely now|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3-1-1-1 tricks, cannot see anything else|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is likely to come up short|pg||
nt|rodal f: Understand W for take the safe sac, but unlucky this time.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the double finesse in hearts makes 10 - di shift good|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|benjent: The problem with 6NT is that you may actually be exposing the @dQ rather than protecting it. The red pre-empter could easily have @dK given your @h strength (and partner's @h ...|pg||
nt|benjent: stopper to boot)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: not by leading clubs    he would have been better off to lead a low @S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|passell: maybe down 1 hampson may not be greedy if they play dia at trick 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: www.german-bridge-trophy.de --> Bonn Nations Cup|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|gulyas: will try a @S now|pg||
nt|ybob: now 10|pg||
nt|karesz:  11 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jtmckee: so down 2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|passell: double dummy can duck a club and squeeze north|pg||
nt|passell: yes  true  but protecting the ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence are now in control|pg||
nt|granguru: I think the idea of a transfer with a second suit is that it is very likely that partner holds a 6 cards suit. if not they can play in a 5-2 or 5-1 trump suit |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jtmckee: 1|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bessi2: north must force dummy with the king of @c to hold declarer to 9 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|taliga: a boring game again|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: ty Mr GIB:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|passell: easier seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|benjent: 2 off? Kranyak's just going to pump @c's and accept a certain fate I would think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: ducked c a|pg||
nt|jtmckee: on 106?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|roswolf: a few back to deutsch|pg||
nt|bagman: Did the players go for a break?|pg||
nt|roswolf: they have only played 5 boards|pg||
nt|taliga: small diamond is an interesting idea :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well the 11th came at least|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|granguru: now declarer is going -2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well Played, indeed|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  Turkish delight|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|daman: On board 4 in the OR   North/South were one down in 3@S    5 Imps to England|pg||
pc|sK|nt|granguru: I am wondering how many times @CJ discard might give declarer a trick...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S made in the other room, so 5 back to Deutsch|pg||
nt|granguru: Moysean fits are recommended on special instances...|pg||
nt|daman: when they make :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|h6|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|granguru:  the toughest bridge book on play of the cards|pg||
mb|1C|nt|granguru:  ever written|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|phil: although I have heard that Martens' recent books are on par with Adventures, so they are on my list of things to buy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: i think he is very good|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|phil: presumably 1N showed a 14-16 or so|pg||
nt|granguru:  to be fair book was written with other top bridge writer Hugh kelsey|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are about 4 boards ahead of the closed room, or they are 4 behind if you prefer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same as a bottle half full or half empty|pg||
nt|jcomyn: AK and a D could have caused serious problem|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|phil: not really - declarer has 2 spades, 3 clubs, the @hA and the @d for 7, a @h to the Q must be ducked, and then declarer can choose to set up the 13th in either major for 9 I think|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: lets say it makes it tricky|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, the contract never was in jeopardy|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ritong: although the @d lead seemed logical, neither opponent claimed having 4 of them|pg||
nt|ritong: via doubling 1@d|pg||
nt|phil: true|pg||
nt|granguru:  last word on Ottlik's. Just checked.. Adventures in card play edited in 1987 is out of print...u will have to find it used. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: as i have said before - WE can see the 3NT with all 4 hands on view|pg||
nt|phil: sure, but dont you think LHO is 3343 on the bidding, (and the club lead?)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: remember the earlier when D was not returned|pg||
nt|phil: I suppose 4=4=4=1 is also possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7 is funny; hold your breath|pg||

nt|gulyas: still down by 15|pg||
nt|frankaus: another interesting lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: break|pg||
nt|roswolf: good result for diamond in the other room|pg||
nt|bagman: A partscore hand which probably belongs to NS. EW can take 6 tricks in NT in defense|pg||
nt|bagman: The nice lie of the red suits gives declarer 3 hearts and 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|granguru: I am informed that if opener retransfers to @S (bidding 2@H) he shows a 6 card spade suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and complaints re the system, its just often that a system does not cover every hand |pg||
mb|1C|nt|bagman: The system of Cohen-Smith was not available on the USBF web site; anybody know what they play?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 16+|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfj: yes|pg||
nt|jtmckee: bet he feels bad|pg||
nt|jtmckee: his dad would not be happy at ducking the setting trick|pg||
nt|caitlin: @Cs hadn't been played|pg||
nt|karesz:  16+|pg||
mb|r|nt|bessi2: I am not a big fan of south's pass here|pg||
nt|bagman: The club J is also onside so declarer can make 2 club tricks and come to 7 with 3 hearts, 2 clubs and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT? Major or a color?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 6c possibility|pg||
nt|nezihk: slm|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|nezihk: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: really 1@D by east!?|pg||
nt|bagman: The latter line probably needs some entry help from the defense|pg||
nt|chick: 6@H also makes, but not 6N on a @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 2/1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they try 4@S since they're at vul?|pg||
nt|rodal f: An interesting point can come in @S, but max 9 it seems|pg||
nt|taliga: I guess E compensated a bit his original pass... :)|pg||
nt|taliga: after a diamond lead both black kings will take a trick|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bessi2: it has its advantages surely.. but definately not my style|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I would open - 2@S weak, or 2@D Multi,or 2@S spades and a minor|pg||
nt|frankaus: did wolpert bid @H opp?|pg||
nt|karesz:  balanced 8-10 i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: So E have got a warning and can find best spot. 3NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even that is hard since u need to find @CJ|pg||
mb|d|an|2 or 3 !d's|nt|frankaus: will it end in 4@H?|pg||
nt|taliga: if S passes... :)|pg||
nt|granguru: bakhshi explains that 2@S would show @S AND @c ..pretty interesting|pg||
nt|tomi2: interesting board to have an agreement about passes in this seat - either "i would have passed 1@Cx" or "no preferance"|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I  like upgrading this south hand to a 2N opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am a big fan of rebidding 1NT with unbal hands that are short in pd's major, but it backfires when you cannot bid 2M with a mangy 5c suit, frearing a singleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: yes, as i know it|pg||
nt|jtmckee: seems cold at first glance|pg||
nt|jtmckee: this one seems cold at first glance|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3@C mixed raise in @Ds|pg||
nt|karesz:  relay|pg||
nt|karesz:  2 @d 4-crad @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: EW will probably bid 3nt on this board. A not so good 3nt as previous|pg||
nt|karesz:  and a 4-card minor|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: ah more understandable|pg||
nt|jtmckee: best lead|pg||
nt|caitlin: and ofte singleton trump not good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: good point, that is my style too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So 3@H is stronger than 4 as 2@H was GF|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the defense can take 6 tricks: 3 hearts 2 diamonds and a club to beat |pg||
nt|caitlin: often|pg||
nt|jtmckee: will have to husband his entrys|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Tkx Daniel:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: this seems a fair slam|pg||
nt|puncher99: trump lead beats it 2 trks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: probably 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can only see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|taliga: S had his problem, because they overcall very agressively, so it was very probable from his point of view, that at these colours 5@d would be good|pg||
nt|taliga: I always lose a g. Aggressively. :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well on the way now|pg||
nt|jbgood: running scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: The heart slam requires the trumps to behave|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Smith actually held up 1 finger for 5@d, guess it's clear from the auction he doesn't have 4 keycards :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have thankfully missed the 4-4 @Cfit|pg||
nt|bagman: NT slam has extra chances in clubs|pg||
nt|sommer:  There's a short version here...maybe ...   http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=711&pid=278|pg||
nt|bagman: This requires the heart switch in trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may be difficult to find|pg||
nt|bagman: otherwise E might be able to discard a heart and ruff a heart in dummy|pg||
nt|karesz:  against @s lead|pg||
nt|granguru: here South could have done so, considering the weakness of the @H suit. then 3@C wouls have been reached...|pg||
nt|daman: the @S 10 would have been double dummy   a "surround" lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: looks like -2|pg||
nt|jtmckee: a|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normal lead might, but would prefere a @H from N|pg||
nt|granguru: I think 2NT would have been no extras...support means extras. 3@D cue |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bidding 1 @C - D - 3 NT will give you a long and healthy bridge-life|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frankaus: has a chance but need to get it all right|pg||
nt|granguru: 3nt shows no singleton|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chessmaste: Looks like a simple two down|pg||
nt|gulyas: 10 tricks, coffee break:)|pg||
nt|passell: good 3nt by larsen   even if partner had 3 spades he might get beat in trumps  he has so much on the outside|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|caitlin: apparently 3@C mixed raise in @C and @Ds|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@C might be RKCB|pg||
nt|chick: so 4N is 2 keycards with the @CQ, apparently no d0p1 used|pg||
nt|granguru: jansma paulissen play OPTIONAL blackwood|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 4NT shows more than minimum|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gulyas: I never see the point in leading a singleton in an unbid suit against notrump|pg||
nt|roswolf: not too much to the play|pg||
nt|sommer: this is a great contract|pg||
nt|bagman: The club slam is the worst requiring the clubs to be 3-2 with Q onside (or Q singleton)|pg||
nt|sommer: no..it's easy..and will be copied most places|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it needs trumps 3-2 which is not really great|pg||
nt|roswolf: acccurate wd|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now it's home but W don't know. Some time will go|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chessmaste: But declarer must attack the side suit first|pg||
nt|bessi2: if Deutch had opened 2@s, Diamond might overcall 2N which would not have been a pleasant contract to play|pg||
nt|gulyas: not that it matters here|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak's got a plausible X, but I think it has a bit to do with how his set is going as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: X ruff from here|pg||
nt|karesz:  he can win the third spade and will have 9 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: probably with a minimum he would just bid 5@C declining blackwood|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: how?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@c 2@h 1@s and 3@d|pg||
nt|karesz:  N had to throw cards on diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sommer: this is around 55%|pg||
nt|taliga: d!6 was interpreted as suit preference... ?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|bagman: N is now in position to cash 5 first and see what happens then|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Best to continue clubs|pg||
nt|daman: as I predicted earlier    NS were in 3@C in the OR    making 4       2@H -2 here     8 IMPs to Israel|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chessmaste: Now he may well go 3 down|pg||
nt|benjent: Might need the @d finesse too|pg||
nt|rodal f: ?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jtmckee: down 2 it appears|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ybob: A@S and @H to 120|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bagman: Once declarer sees the dummy he wishes he's in 6NT but no problem here as hearts behave|pg||
nt|sommer: 68% minus the very bad shapes is ok to me|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: really!?|pg||
mc|9|nt|ralfwil: He can throw 2@h (@hQ) if E plays 3 rounds of@d|pg||

nt|ralfwil: in my opinion a bad defence from N. Should count declarers trick|pg||
nt|granguru: another one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine two six clubses in a row|pg||
nt|granguru: 6@C but not 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html for the actual results|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: re |pg||
nt|sommer: agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond has opened a fair lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss to Cohen "you couldn't ask for the queen"|pg||
nt|karesz:  yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and he's still wondering over the last one|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|daman: bad splits everywhere on this hand|pg||
nt|granguru: but 6 NT is also there here|pg||
nt|tomi2: this would be a 2@D opener in their old system|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D was reserved for some above opening hands with one suit or some NT range|pg||
mb|2D|an|one suiter 15+ or 19-20NT|nt|bagman: Did S try the 13th heart to set up T9x of spades?|pg||
nt|puncher99: must of|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I vote for pass with S hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jtmckee: dont think that happened in erd chair|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If he plays a small - either correct or doesn´t matter|pg||
nt|rodal f: 16+ again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 6d |pg||
mb|2S|nt|viren169: could be trouble here...|pg||
nt|caitlin: Bathurst 275 Nickell 212|pg||
nt|jtmckee: wow what a pass by east|pg||
nt|karesz:  and now...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D trancfere?|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@S - 2@D(FG5+) 2@S 3@C 4@C etc|pg||
nt|chick: 6N would be a bit nerve-racking, needing a lot of things to go well|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bessi2: I play notrump bids here showing @s raises with all suit bids natural after a strong club opening|pg||
nt|gulyas: has to make some good guesses in 3NT|pg||
nt|ybob: another 140 to E-W, now 2@C  p p 2@H ?|pg||
nt|karesz:  zoller tried double finesse in @d at board 4!|pg||
nt|karesz:  what about North"s step now?|pg||
nt|granguru: HI|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N could have had a better situation if he first had bid 2@c |pg||
nt|taliga: Declarer needed 1 black king at South, he had to decide which one|pg||
nt|daman: here comes the axe|pg||
nt|daman: or ax|pg||
nt|daman: or cl;eaver|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Zum Netz|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H - like Tennis|pg||
mb|4S|nt|taliga: 2N promises 20-22 here, but AK973 is +1 |pg||
nt|taliga: it is 20 anyway :) I miscounted :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: n-s not on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|ybob: or X from E|pg||
nt|viren169: or P P dble|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello John|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: tough but makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D a lucky make|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to find the @CQ in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be routine , i think, but you never know|pg||
nt|karesz:  but then E culd not bid @h|pg||
nt|karesz:  could|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4C minor key-card?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes the layout is fairly kind to declarer|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs 5 club tricks to pitch 2 hearts; he cannot make if W has Q9xx so should guess the clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah now that makes it certain|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: easier now|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 3rd|pg||
nt|granguru: Well the double permited E to bid @H. that was the moment where NS got out of troubles (supposely)|pg||
nt|karesz:  can be this 4 @h natural?|pg||
nt|karesz:  can N believe it?|pg||
nt|granguru: what else?|pg||
nt|karesz:  cue with @c|pg||
nt|rodal f: So we say 21 for S:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: can he find the club lead?|pg||
nt|daman: automatic @C lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: think so also |pg||
nt|granguru: this is going to be made if @C are not touched fast|pg||
nt|granguru: what about 5@S?|pg||
nt|granguru: would u bid it?|pg||
nt|granguru: thrilling moment|pg||
nt|granguru: 6@S has some chances |pg||
nt|daman: I would have passed quicker and done a jig|pg||
nt|daman: partner is a passed hand    you need a lot to consider even 5@S|pg||
nt|granguru: a @C lead might bring 5@D down 3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will West find the @D-lead against 4 @S?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck: he will get the @h right, cannot lose to E twice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: knew that moved but wasnt sure about the river part|pg||
nt|sommer: @DQ 3rd or 4th makes it for Fred|pg||
nt|sommer: ..in N|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like declarer needs all the diamonds. He can get them but entries are short and this might require quite accurate play|pg||
nt|viren169: East taking the low road!|pg||
nt|viren169: North will hopeful respect the bidding...|pg||
nt|ybob: if S has 6@C and pd 4333 2@H was the good bid|pg||
nt|viren169: if South had an opening they would pass...|pg||
nt|ybob: not opening but 6@C decent|pg||
nt|granguru: just @D 3-3 or @S 3-3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  he has at least 2 more choices|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both are ready for a @C-ruff|pg||
nt|tomi2: nice try to get a ruff, unlucky on this board|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @hQ - agreed suit, or @c - singleton|pg||
pc|cK|nt|passell: he should start hearts |pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that takes care of it|pg||
nt|benjent: Taken with the @c overcall, Greco will think that's a short @h lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Left to his own devices, he would like to work on the minors before drawing trumps, but that's not where he is|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping to put partner in for a heart thru|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bagman: Now one more entry to dummy helps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman: "leads are?" Smith "4th best"|pg||
nt|karesz:  no, it was natural for Hegedus|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely they will play in 6c|pg||
nt|granguru: agree|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|granguru: well it is in fact a makeable contract|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: now he only needs 1 extra trick|pg||
nt|benjent: A mid-range alternative is to draw two rounds of trumps then try @d's|pg||
nt|sybarra: S should be able to get all 3 trumps |pg||
pc|h5|nt|viren169: this wont be pretty...|pg||
nt|ybob: don´t like 2NT|pg||
nt|ybob: with xxx @S|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a pass to me...|pg||
nt|ybob: pd denies 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer runs the @DT|pg||
nt|taliga: no, because KQ is -1 for me :) :)|pg||
nt|daman: bold as brass|pg||
nt|daman: with the xx|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 2 in 45 minutes is Sweden vs Netherlands|pg||
nt|granguru: well the double backfired in Levit's face... lets see the playing now...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|passell: oops |pg||
nt|gulyas: with 3221 for sure|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Greco will not assay the @D position after this lead|pg||
nt|passell: interesting not to lead a high club  worked well as declarer placed his partner with 1 of the top honors|pg||
nt|benjent: Drawing all the trumps then playing @d's is risky - if you get them wrong, they can play on @c's, force out West's last trump and be ready to pounce with a @d and @c trick later|pg||
nt|ybob: -100 instead  win 140|pg||
nt|rodal f: 9 tricks and next|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: wil lose just 2@D and @C|pg||
nt|benjent: Greco's still going to be in the position where he can't draw all the trumps ... so I reckon he will draw 2, and then play the @dK, hating it all the way|pg||
nt|sommer: no:)|pg||
nt|viren169: 2 light if North ducks 2 rounds of hearts...|pg||
nt|caitlin: Wolfson 200  Aker 180 or so-------Wolfson playing w Larry Cohen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with no entry on W - just give E 2 @h tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: can ruff low...to be overruffed means W has 9 @D, clearly not for  the bidding|pg||
nt|granguru: from* the bidding|pg||
nt|granguru: @HK|pg||
nt|karesz:  SSzabo had opened, so he has @cQ, no problem in the play for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first @cA/K and then @hK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: of course @cA or @cK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for a later finess ....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine never got past 4h in open room board 18|pg||
nt|granguru: how is the possible answers?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bagman: A good try and a good bet S holding one spade and partner 5|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|granguru: careful play should N permit to win|pg||
nt|sybarra: no,  worried about the (Obvious) stiff ht) |pg||
nt|sybarra: looking JOhn,  may reconsider that |pg||
pc|h2|pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: play clubs an claim|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bagman: Smith covered in the hope that Cohen had the 9|pg||
nt|roswolf: nae bother as a scottish friend of mine would say|pg||
nt|sommer: he will just take the @D's and play a small @H now|pg||
nt|granguru: wrong play|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: S showed his hand, after that E/W claimed :)|pg||
nt|granguru: Normally optional Blackwood permits you to answer as RKCB bypassing the trump suit wich refuses to answer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bridge is a bidderÂ´s game|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bagman: Gitelman cannot be sure that the spades really are 4-2; the lead might have been false|pg||
nt|bagman: 4-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: not very likely though|pg||
nt|sommer: so?..does a @H finesse help then?|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart finesse does not help then, that's true|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is the 9th trick:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer was taking the club finesse to the safe hand protecting the @HK|pg||
nt|taliga: the excitement is about the number of the overtricks. Again. |pg||
nt|granguru: now -1|pg||
nt|granguru: no chance now|pg||
nt|granguru: might even go -2 if he doesnt touch cards carefully|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember "we"  rewound it |pg||
nt|granguru: as now a cross ruff permits to win 7 tricks in trumps only|pg||
nt|daman: and the got 500 vs 5@D X in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: y|pg||
nt|granguru: very difficult hand|pg||
nt|daman: It will take a few minutes to play I imagine|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gulyas: @Ss will be cleared|pg||
nt|passell: he will now have to guess well|pg||
nt|gulyas: cash @DAK and then finesse in @Hs? has to give up a @H trick first|pg||
nt|passell: likely as long as he doesnt run clubs first|pg||
nt|karesz:  no finesse:)|pg||
nt|granguru: for minus -1 declarer must establish @H|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chessmaste: A strange misunderstanding|pg||
nt|viren169: @d now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sommer: so is the small:)..and no @C suit opened|pg||
nt|bagman: If spades are 5-2 and heart finesse works, declarer can afford to play @HQ|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jtmckee: east going to take the rest|pg||
mc|10|nt|gulyas: if he does, he will see W started with 4-4 in the blacks|pg||
nt|caitlin: by East?|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 12 only|pg||
nt|jtmckee: has to take the d finess to make ten|pg||
nt|hawe45:  First score for "die Doktoren"|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Elinescu told E to give W a club ruff after @sA and laughed :)|pg||

mb|4S|nt|granguru:  entry problems|pg||

nt|granguru:  phantom defense..6@c is the only makeable contract|pg||
nt|ritong: zorlu has a good expectancy 7@h will be cheaper than game|pg||
mb|7H|nt|ritong: he just cares en route about a possible 7@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: right or wrong, I would have doubled 6@S for the lead|pg||

nt|sybarra: 'spensive |pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: here we have a regulation game|pg||
nt|taliga: 7@h is not a good save against the cold 6@s here :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: And here they will find the slam?|pg||
nt|granguru: this hand will be commented for a few days|pg||
nt|daman: 14 IMPs to Israel instead of a push    judgement at high levels is critical|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good lord another slam hand|pg||
nt|granguru: Here, probably over minors 4NT is used as a negative and the trump suit is just one step of the answers|pg||
mb|2D|an|onesuiter 15+ or 19-20NT|mb|3C|nt|ybob: 2@D = short @D 11/15 probably|pg||

mb|3H|nt|roswolf: n/s must restrain themselves|pg||
nt|bagman: North probably bids 4NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4C|pg||

mb|5C|nt|bagman: or passed, or doubles :)|pg||

nt|rodal f: Look at @S7 here. It will make a trick|pg||
mb|5S|nt|gulyas: strong @C in action again|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: welcome Marshall |pg||
nt|sommer: ..if Moss didnt;-)|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S didnt get in...|pg||
nt|viren169: what was 2@d?|pg||
nt|ybob: 3 suiters short @D may  be 3/4 4/3 in M' s|pg||
nt|viren169: i see...|pg||
nt|taliga: We shall see. I know, that their philosophy is not to go wrong in games. |pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H=splinter and @S. |pg||
nt|taliga: Slams are not "so" important. :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In 6 @C, East must decide, whether the @S King is bare - or from K 10...|pg||
mb|6C|nt|bessi2: 3N for n-s.. and at this time I don't see any reason for declarer to misguess @d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|swanson: Greco really wants a club lead, but he can't stand a diamond lead.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss did|pg||
nt|roswolf: well maybe e/w are going overboard?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, he did|pg||
nt|bagman: If 4NT is the right bid, 4@S was wrong (or vice versa)|pg||
nt|sommer: only chance in 5@S is a squeeze|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Although with all the running around I did to try to get this computer on the internet and not lose any other table, I certainly could miss a pass or two here and there :)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..the minorsqueeze against N|pg||
nt|roswolf: west fell in love with his 2 aces|pg||
nt|granguru: another alternative..is next step min, then partner can re-ask with next step, not the trump suit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W would perhaps bid 6 @C, not possible any longer|pg||
mb|6D|nt|chessmaste: 3NT is the obvious call |pg||
nt|jtmckee: diamond team playing strong right now|pg||
nt|caitlin: bd 11 Moss Xed in 4@S making|pg||
nt|caitlin: 111|pg||
nt|jtmckee: having a huge rally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or might not if W get a @D ruff.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hegedus is examining Macskasy's face right now:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfj: connection problem :(|pg||
nt|bagman: Did West really pass?|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were wet here imo a reopening double would have got them into the auction|pg||
nt|viren169: the vul and the 2@d bid kept N/S at bay!|pg||
nt|rodal f: LOL:)|pg||
mb|6S|nt|sommer: ..3?|pg||
nt|roswolf: it appears so pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: I admit that W holds a bad hand and they are vulnerable but still he's holding a reasonable spade suit and doubleton heart|pg||
nt|taliga: :)|pg||
nt|granguru: competitive bidding agreements at the high level are the keystones to pairs being successful in top compeition|pg||
nt|granguru: obviously in this format the 0 option does not exist as it would be min|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that should mean 6s next|pg||
nt|granguru: finally a non@C slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or 4nt|pg||
mb|d|nt|benjent: Unfortunately, we got dropped out at an interesting point in the play on the last, but I assume Greco managed it smoothly|pg||
nt|sommer: + Q:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Lead problem|pg||
nt|sommer: 4 keycards, actually|pg||
nt|roswolf: well so i cant count or perhaps type:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: @CK creates a parking place for the diamond loser|pg||
nt|sommer: always makeable I guess|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes but may work out ok|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|granguru: competition*|pg||

nt|rodal f: Using 0314. I like better 1403|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bessi2: i wonder if Larsen will try to sneak a @h to the king right away|pg||
nt|bessi2: which would give him leeway to misguess @d|pg||
nt|bessi2: if it held that is|pg||
nt|daman: most of the people I know would be in 4@S|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: well perhaps e/w have dodged one|pg||
nt|taliga: For some reason almost noone uses 1430 in Hungary. Do not know why|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am afraid I would be in 4 @S  |pg||
nt|granguru: 4@H didnt show controls ..just a slam intention before surpassing 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no problem|pg||
nt|granguru: convention called LAST TRAIN |pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzge: he alerted it like this :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bagman: Did not GIB this but I think that @HK lead lets S to play a diamond trhu  in time|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think Deutsch came in with guns blazing to get ahead by far and has backfired|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: poor lakers|pg||
nt|daman: do they play support doubles on that side of the pond?|pg||
nt|granguru: as you have seen, and will continue do so, many distributional hands appear in a match today...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sommer: with "squeeze" I included "endplay"..of course|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ybob: 4405,4414,3415,4315, 11/15 hcp|pg||
nt|granguru: because of the perfect computer dealing|pg||
nt|granguru: hand dealt hands are much more flat|pg||
nt|jcomyn: rare thing - slam after opps open the bidding|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|jtmckee: as mr gowdy points out   deutsch much better sporrts|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: deutsch got caught in the other room|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rodal f: It will come.|pg||
nt|granguru: so, 5@C min, 5@D 3 5@H 14 5@S 2 w/o|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|benjent: This plays very well|pg||
pc|d9|nt|benjent: and the lead didn't hurt :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Deutch probably going minus in both rooms to lose 6-8|pg||
nt|chick: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Train|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|bagman: depending how many tricks Kranyak makes here|pg||
nt|caitlin: is Gowdy online?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bagman: each undertrick is worth an IMP|pg||
nt|karesz:  @c 5|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|daman: missed a frigid game|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|taliga: misunderstanding. |pg||

nt|phil: I think frontwash was coined in the last 5 minutes - I could be wrong|pg||
nt|ritong: just for the record|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: welcome John |pg||
nt|sommer: actually N was endplayed from trick 1|pg||
nt|bagman: EW happy to go plus |pg||
nt|viren169: N/S will be relieved to find both 3N and 4@H are likly to go off!|pg||
nt|karesz:  East missplayed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Macskasy was a bit surprised that his @S7 earned a trick|pg||
nt|granguru: finally a flat one|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: in the open room they just ended in 7@hX|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: in board 8|pg||
mb|1H|nt|swanson: Hi to all.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be feisty|pg||
nt|karesz:  he had to ruff teh @c 9, and lead a heart!|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: bits and pieces hand now|pg||
nt|sommer: 2 @H NS looks best|pg||
nt|jtmckee: deutsch needs about 6 imps a board..|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) Was big from beginning.|pg||
nt|tomi2: 11H is limited if this is the strong club board|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: 0-7|pg||
nt|viren169: lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: I can't imagine where Gowdy's allegiance lies:)|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 17 pt 4s here|pg||
nt|taliga: hi all :)|pg||
nt|karesz:  hi, father:)|pg||
nt|granguru: Last train is used when you have no more space to cue bid or show extras before the game level is reached. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: gallop for the line in 3nt |pg||
nt|granguru: so normally it is a 4@D bid when @H is trump or a 4@H bid when @s is trump|pg||
nt|jcomyn: like a scalded cat|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bessi2: I play 2@s there pretty sound aswell but this east hand is too powerful for a 2@s bid there imo|pg||
nt|psyck: I may have tried a higher number of @h|pg||
nt|passell: the preemptive 1heart|pg||
nt|benjent: Indeed, don't make things worse. The wind will shift in their direction sometime. Need to make sure you haven't blown the match already when that happens.|pg||
nt|roswolf: will west bid here|pg||
nt|ybob: wrong hand|pg||
nt|karesz:  it is the other 2 @d:):)|pg||
nt|karesz:  perhaps in red?|pg||
nt|taliga: yeah, maybe :)|pg||
nt|granguru: NS have the balance of the hand but they are unfitted|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the opening bid, slam is with odds for E/W|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bagman: Facing a passed partner and holding a bad hand with no source of tricks S goes for the offshape X instead of the dangerous 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|ybob: now better :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Stolen. 4@S flat|pg||
mb|2H|nt|viren169: a light opener in 1st seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: (again) |pg||
nt|daman: 3NT looks like the final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north sticks his neck out|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt from N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice bidding from Elinescu here...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chessmaste: The real score is probably 4-3 to Deutsch|pg||
nt|swanson: There is no really good opening bid with the South hand.  |pg||
nt|taliga: they have their own developed system...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT waited becauce the 5th@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: will Wladow find another bid with his hand?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For me, 6 NT is the right contract - knowing the @H Queen and the @C King by North|pg||
nt|tomi2: then you will be surprised how often Wladow has even less and Elinescu holds one of both cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: very true   I prefer 1heart overcall to dbl with west  anyone have an opinion?|pg||
nt|benjent: 1@h for me too. Tell partner where you live|pg||
nt|bagman: S happy having avoided being dummy in 3@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now time to set up the 9th trick|pg||
nt|karesz:  sppade would be better, Wesz promised spades too|pg||
nt|karesz:  West |pg||
mb|3N|nt|passell: makes it very difficult for the opponents to get to 3nt  on many hands when it is cold|pg||
nt|sommer: calm down now...|pg||
nt|ybob: and light X too :)|pg||
nt|viren169: probably systematically t/out of @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i keep missing a spot of bidding :)|pg||
nt|ybob: over 1NT opening from W :)|pg||
nt|viren169: no worries... keeps us amused!|pg||
nt|caitlin: 21|pg||
nt|caitlin: brb.......|pg||
nt|granguru: so 3NT should be reached soon|pg||
nt|granguru: they did it faster than my writing!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and it "flops" well |pg||
nt|sybarra: as they say in poker|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: Larsen has to cash his 5 winners, otherwise he will wind up with only 4 it seems|pg||
nt|sommer: 9 tricks possible|pg||
nt|bagman: N cannot pass as 2@H is limited only by the inability to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: the chimera of the vul game bonus tempts north|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss asks Cohen if he had another way to raise 2@h to 3@h and Cohen says no|pg||
nt|bagman: N could have bid 2NT for the minors but 3@C is lead directing and normally also a good trump suit (facing a normal X=T/O)|pg||
nt|taliga: here we have the +1 point :)|pg||
nt|taliga: S tries to stop in 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: 9 tricks here ... but 6 losers first|pg||
nt|passell: 5 needed imps for deutsch|pg||
nt|passell: 7imps|pg||
nt|passell: hampson did have 1 suit stopped  just neither of theirs|pg||
nt|passell: Gavin did well to bid 1spade also|pg||
nt|benjent: I expect Kranyak will cash a big @d now|pg||
nt|sommer: sure sure..N has to raise to 3|pg||
nt|sommer: Cohen doesn't like it right now..I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed not clear how 3@S fares|pg||
nt|taliga: E can not tell how many... could have been 4|pg||
nt|udo: :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chessmaste: With clubs 4-1 he would need to find East with @D K10 doubleton|pg||
nt|granguru: 6@C depends on the position of the @SK and @CQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: quick claim|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|bagman: Everything else is friendly so S is unlikely to go down here|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|benjent: Get some attitude (just in case) and also make sure partner returns the right thing|pg||
nt|passell: hampson hoping he has only 2|pg||
nt|ybob: S has 2 moves, @H or low @S ...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If fast boards are OK, this might be 490 in a hurry|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ybob: now K @D and 8 @H  ...|pg||
nt|ybob: if duck N play @S ...|pg||
nt|taliga: Any idea for best line?|pg||
nt|granguru: a safety play in @C |pg||
nt|granguru: to protect the @SK|pg||
nt|granguru: not really necessary because declarer holds @S10 and @S9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is close to a claim|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bessi2: 4@s make but may be difficult to reach|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to guess the spades, avoid losing control and manage the diamonds (with ruff or luck)|pg||
nt|viren169: declarer will duck this expecting diamonds to be 5-3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|karesz:  and it could be enough|pg||
nt|taliga: 3? :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ybob: with 5@D on N he bids 2@D over 2@C|pg||
nt|viren169: and hope to bring the Ace down in 3|pg||
nt|granguru: 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: South could have bid 2@D    then North would play it|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|viren169: easy for us to see... looking at all 4 hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HK for me|pg||
nt|granguru: claim time|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bagman: Deutch probably going plus in both rooms again|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks to be drifting -1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chessmaste: Now declarer thinks 'Might East have ducked with @DK7?' - Not a chance so he cashes out|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and open room mis another slam|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: Taking the easy tricks for book|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is a bit unhappy but he really cannot go down on any sensible line he might take|pg||
nt|taliga: Actually I'd prefer bidding 3@h with 3 card supprort...|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ybob: can´ t win if A @D on N |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|bagman: Diamond away|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

mc|12|nt|hawe45:  Am I wrong is I suppose, that ext match will NOT start at schduled time?|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: this is am exciting lot |pg||
nt|bagman: A solid slam here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|benjent: Hampson will be wondering if slam is on. The @d overcall is good news, really|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@D looks a cinch to bid|pg||

mb|1D|nt|bagman: Both holding good looking two suiters|pg||
nt|roswolf: but which slam?|pg||
nt|bagman: EW have 12 tricks in both diamonds and NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Might have some communication problems in NT with heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room e/w never got to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|bagman: @HA|pg||
nt|roswolf: a relay sequence should do the trick here|pg||
nt|granguru: and 4 to score|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html for actual results|pg||
nt|granguru: remaining*|pg||
mb|d|nt|chessmaste: I would not pass the South hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: interesting pass from Deutsch here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 4 corrected|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is possiblr here|pg||
nt|bagman: But nothing unsolvable; take @H diamonds and then @SQ|pg||
nt|daman: he will punt 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: No way is Hampson going to sit for that|pg||
nt|frankaus: no entry to  8 tricks :(|pg||
nt|sommer: 6@D, 6NT..or maybe even 7@D?|pg||
nt|bagman: Soon they will know about the misfit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bessi2: a bidding challenge for n-s here.. to avoid the tempting 3N for the 11 trick gamecontract|pg||
nt|karesz:  1 @c Precision|pg||
nt|taliga: 1n is semiforcing|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chessmaste: 2@D looks like a limited 3 suiter|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed,  one of my two favorite opening bid conventions|pg||
nt|chessmaste: With N/S cold for 5@D this is not par so far|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is easy watching all 4 hands. but imo Larsen should protect here,  |pg||
nt|bessi2: could be disastrous, but you lose to many partscore swings by passing I think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps, and certainly if South is allowed to pass with this type of hand|pg||
nt|benjent: 3NT was bad news for Hampson (wasted @d card in his partner's limited hand) and he's sensibly focussing on game|pg||
nt|bagman: But they have lots of cards and a reasonable diamond fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes fortune will favor the brave here|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: TD is here because of the last board i think, so it takes a little bit more time...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gulyas: 5@D the only making game|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing diamonds i suppose and if so 4@D MUST BE A SLAM TRY|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok so is 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOW SLAM IS EASY PEASEY|pg||
nt|bagman: Not even trying to guess what's going on here biddingwise|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C precision, 1@S  i think positive unbal but not sure|pg||
nt|ybob: 8/11|pg||
nt|sybarra: this  can make |pg||
nt|granguru: NS can win 4@C but better 3NT if @HJ is played|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bessi2: I am not saying I would bid, I am somewhat of a chicken in these spots, I am saying one should|pg||
nt|passell: they are there|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D save? |pg||
nt|viren169: all routes lead to 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|karesz:  the others is not known by me|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Bodis is shaking his head|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: South could have staretd with either minor, or used a gadget - say 2@H a three suiter always with hearts   |pg||
nt|frankaus: green V gren saves not real value|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@D looks like a good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: @D is the trump suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 6@D|pg||
nt|granguru: sorry thought the lead was from the other side|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: guess 3@S would be 4th suit, so N saved it|pg||
nt|ybob: another NT ?|pg||
nt|karesz:  are|pg||
nt|taliga: i guess not known by anyone except E-W|pg||
nt|taliga: they work hard to develop their system (almost daily basis)|pg||
nt|granguru: Y..LET ME CHECK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bessi2: It must have been delightful for Deutsc to see that 3@d bid :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think a grand is possible|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H could be kickback but could also be something else|pg||
nt|granguru: sorry private|pg||
nt|hawe45:  An easy way to 5 IMPÂ´s for Germany|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chessmaste: He is relieved|pg||
nt|chessmaste: or even reprieved|pg||
nt|gulyas: well done|pg||
nt|benjent: How to get back to hand? A @d ruff is not 100% safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: to be bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman writing questions to Cohen, but I can't quite make it out - sorry|pg||
nt|bagman: Grand is possible but on a trump lead it might be a bit tricky to play|pg||
nt|sommer: S doesn't know about the @Cvoid, so he may go for the grand|pg||
nt|karesz:  5 @c is the limit|pg||
nt|granguru: here it is almost obvious|pg||
pc|c2|nt|passell: good lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Hampson did well to avoid a spade lead - that would put a lot of pressure on West to find the overtake and club shift.|pg||
nt|roswolf: NICELY BID|pg||
nt|bagman: The play is no problem|pg||
nt|puncher99: cashout time|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chessmaste: Declarer will claim in a moment|pg||
nt|sommer: 5n?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5nt may get north bidding 7@D|pg||
nt|bagman: I'd like to be in 6@S where I can draw trumps and then pass the @ST :)|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@D|pg||
nt|bagman: Or pass the @ST and then draw trumps |pg||
nt|daman: he needs to bring the @Cs home for 1 loser|pg||
pc|sK|nt|passell: hard to mis guess diamonds as only 1 4 -1 break is useful|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|passell: club now|pg||
nt|benjent: As it happens, he can't go wrong on the 2nd round of @d's, since the @h10 is short onside|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert may ruff the 2nd @c ... maybe a bit of uppercutting, chance to try a @d to promote partner's @h's|pg||
nt|taliga: boring 3N instead|pg||
nt|karesz:  16-16 after 9 boards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't it normaly 8-10 as long as they play a sort of prec|pg||
pc|s2|nt|puncher99: cranes law|pg||

nt|puncher99: lead aces vrs all slams|pg||

nt|viren169: 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|taliga: highest unnecessary|pg||
nt|sybarra: ace and a club  and home|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jtmckee: theres 8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|swanson: Now, by the time spades are led the situation will be clear to the defenders.|pg||
nt|jtmckee: and at Yankee stadium, mississippi state bulldog Jon Pappelbon takes the mound vs the evil empire|pg||
nt|jtmckee: he must duck this else the d has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|jtmckee: and if he does they can attack his heart entry|pg||
pc|hK|nt|passell: a tricky 3 rounds of hearts is the only chance|pg||
nt|sommer: S has a lot of trick potential..6@D looks a little puss..|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and 7 it was|pg||
nt|roswolf: OK SOUTH JUST BID IT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen " I've got some holes" Smith: "you've got some too?"|pg||
nt|bagman: THis might take some time|pg||
nt|sommer: N has to take a few deep breaths...but the lucky lie of the cards may help him through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen thinks so too - he's gone for coffee :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well we can see both ordinary finesses work|pg||
nt|bagman: There are 11 tricks with one ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: remember..S has no entry after @Hfinesse!|pg||
nt|roswolf: and i dont see how he can avoid taking at least 1|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might win this in dummy and then take the ordinary spade finesse and hope to ruff down the king|pg||

nt|sommer: exactly|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that looks the more practical line |pg||

nt|ralfwil: a @s finess in trick 2 for me|pg||

pc|d3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|swanson: East can be endplay now.  This was an unusual 3-suit squeeze.  Declarer still has the guess the situation, of course if West rises and leads a club.  It wouldn't be fun to lose the ...|pg||
nt|swanson: contract if hearts were 3-3 all along.|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now another teaser|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Meanwhile Diamond picked up on 67 when their South made a more successful lead (@h) against 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond increasing his lead nicely|pg||
nt|bagman: W knows what to do with solid diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: another 3nt|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi Gabor and welcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: last two boards for this round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - 1 for Turkey, North had a "difficult lead"...!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|swanson: Bad spelling.|pg||
nt|taliga: some action hopfully|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6nt on S  or any minor slam|pg||
nt|karesz:  nice 1 NT|pg||
nt|karesz:  11-14 no sibgleton|pg||
nt|karesz:  n|pg||
nt|taliga: 6m and 5M is systemic|pg||
nt|karesz:  but not both|pg||
nt|taliga: :)|pg||
nt|taliga: 11-14|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some also use. Agree with u|pg||
nt|rodal f: The 12-14NT again|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: thanks, John|pg||

nt|taliga: GF relay|pg||
mb|2H|nt|viren169: back again|pg||
nt|karesz:  gameforcing relay|pg||
nt|karesz:  :)|pg||
nt|taliga: 1n - 3n ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: In unfriendly game a proper comment by NS might put EW to tilt |pg||
nt|taliga: yap, I was slow|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The defence can hardly have tested declarer her - more or less throwing the overtricks after him|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chessmaste: 2@C - must be a Transfer|pg||
nt|karesz:  younger is faster|pg||
nt|taliga: shorter is faster :)|pg||
nt|taliga: EW has lost their 10 card spade fit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@s is a good save against any slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Not everyone responds with Kranyak's hand, but on average it's the right action|pg||
nt|rodal f: 11-14NT also at vul for NS?|pg||
nt|taliga: very common bidding :)|pg||
nt|taliga: yes, always|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: tkx|pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: :) thanks|pg||
nt|granguru: I remind you to register hand 7 to play it yourself afterwards..a good declarer play practice...you shoud make 5@S. |pg||
pc|sA|nt|benjent: Greco could almost bid 1NT without looking at his hand|pg||
nt|bagman: Not much in play here; declarer loses two hearts and the spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen played very quickly from dummy and Moss said "too fast" - so Cohen waited a moment and then played and Moss said "still too fast" Cohen: "sorry"|pg||
nt|sommer: a practical 4@S from N..and he's awarded with 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sommer: quite lucky, but ok|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much N can do; he either makes this or not (losing to 4-1 spades or uppercut/overruf)|pg||
nt|sommer: it's only around 33% but 4@S is "the bid"|pg||
nt|bagman: If E cashes a heart and plays a club; N might wonder weather to play @SK from hand or go to dummy and play a spade to pick up A singleton onside and risk diamond ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman took the @h A out, but now has folded his hand up again|pg||
nt|bagman: 1@H looks like no 5M, no 6m with positive values|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|roswolf: as before|pg||
nt|jtmckee: and the Mississippi State Bulldog shuts down the bronk bombers|pg||
nt|taliga: The weak no trump makes life hard for both pair here|pg||
nt|taliga: E couldnt introduce majors, |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South willlead @S Ace - to teach partner...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bessi2: hmm.. had to cancel my speech regarding the play in 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: can't read the notes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a wild guess. Easier if S had a natural @c opening|pg||
nt|taliga: N couldn't bid his hand or ask anything from partner|pg||
nt|karesz:  Hegedus as brave poiceman!|pg||
nt|taliga: After a bid like this, you lead like after gambling 3N: your ace |pg||
nt|taliga: this case... it was not very succesfull...|pg||
nt|taliga: only club would have been good|pg||
nt|chick: is the 1@H transfer?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|benjent: Double seems a bit optimistic with no @c pips|pg||
nt|gowdy: and the world is good !|pg||
nt|cicus: trying for the ruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: That was a funny lead. A @D and 10 now 11|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y:)|pg||
nt|cicus: I was just considering whether a small @D is indicated here instead of the Q|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would think so|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chessmaste: Well, South pushed the boat out with 2@H and has now left his ship in the harbour. 4@H would have had chances - this has none |pg||
nt|gulyas: this will not test declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: a trump lead would have prolonged the play|pg||
nt|sommer: @H for @C's?|pg||
nt|viren169: West didnt raise because East is limited|pg||
nt|viren169: 9 tricks here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|benjent: The 2nd @c trick gets Greco up to 6, and the @s finesse will make it 7|pg||
nt|benjent: No problem getting the @d suit right when North has bid both blacks|pg||
nt|jtmckee: yes it is|pg||
nt|cicus: now no headaches for declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|passell: looks like he will make this|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond play is not that risky as if there was a diamond ruff hangin, the defense might have gone for that|pg||
nt|sommer: @H2..|pg||
nt|roswolf: creaking to the obvious contract|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bagman: This is the best lead and declarer might have some difficulties as he's probably giving up a club |pg||
nt|bagman: then a diamond back and defense set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: win and lead a heart following with the club finesse looks very natural|pg||
nt|gowdy: note the lead @H 2  so S thinks  they are 44 or W has the length|pg||
nt|jtmckee: yes  he will knock out the wrong entry first and regret it later|pg||
nt|gowdy: rite @C to the A  then a @D hook|pg||
nt|karesz:  13 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: if you are using the web version of BBO it is easy to record them in your prefered hands file|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bessi2: imo,  both are to blame for this contract|pg||
nt|granguru: I think GIB analyses the play trick by trick if you want it|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|bagman: A low diamond now|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|taliga: double dummy analysis, as always... |pg||
pc|c3|nt|passell: 5 with any lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyhow E see the AXX at N and will use the K for a new if W lead Q@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: I'm sorry, they played too fast for me :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: I'm out|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: we all know that operator is the toughest job of all here|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: I need a brake ;-)|pg||
nt|granguru: And Lucas did it wonderfully|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: thanks John :)|pg||
nt|granguru: well just one more board for this set ...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: and I had also preferred to show both majors as E|pg||
pc|cA|nt|passell: the nine of clubs was a good card to see|pg||
nt|benjent: Cashing the @d's to squeeze some unhappy discards out of Wolpert|pg||
nt|sommer: @SQ and claim|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer is more or less forced to play clubs from hand|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|benjent: That @c pitch from Wolpert tells Greco he only had 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: on last hand inother room, they played 1N making 2, so 10 IMPs to Deutsch|pg||
nt|taliga: 2N?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|benjent: No way is he ditching tricks from a 6 card suit|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jtmckee: and dancingly down he went|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h4|nt|passell: if he had kept his spades a low spade shift would have beaten it|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: depends on the 2@d bid from N|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|jtmckee: diamond team hitting on all cylinders|pg||
nt|taliga: pure game force|pg||
pc|s5|nt|passell: 2 clubs 2 hearts 3 spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11 tricks fir the taking|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bagman: This is a bit risky, IMO as the losing heart finesse and heart back puts declarer in a bad position|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|s8|nt|bagman: with Kx in clubs onside and Jx of hearts onside this contract could not have gone down|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|rodal f: brb in 10 min|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: now Macskasy is complaining about the lead|pg||
nt|cicus: the lead cost only 1 trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: yes, they also agreed in it|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s7|pc|d4|nt|passell: the spade nine woulda been the setting trick|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: he did keep it down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss was thinking about overtaking the club, so Smith showed his hand and asked "how do I do?"|pg||
nt|sommer: dangerous partial now|pg||
nt|bagman: Yes the hand was down to the "skill cards"; play from top and see if the trumps break|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|benjent: I find that surprising - obviously didn't expect much from Wolpert's X|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes even 6N|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 7d|pg||
nt|granguru: I think it is the first time in my life...W opens 1NT and N having a 2 strong bal hand|pg||
nt|granguru: even 1NT is a weak one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how did they get to 2nt in open|pg||

mb|p|nt|sommer: Cohen doesnt believe his own eyes|pg||

nt|taliga: S knows, that N has strong balanced hand, or long clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Yes, but their side is leading 31-14!|pg||
nt|bagman: S checking if everybody has same coloured cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Smith: "no blue" (the RDBL bidding card is blue :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup and the vampires gather for the feast|pg||
nt|sommer: -2 or.MAYBE only -1..so not too expensive|pg||
nt|sommer: crossruff!..and @Dfinesse gives a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S scores 3 trump tricks and N the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: Cohen probably disapointed after the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: but in the other room i doubt e/w will be in game|pg||
nt|bagman: @CA, @S to !K|pg||
nt|sommer: @SA + 3 @Htricks is the strange outcome of best play|pg||
nt|taliga: knowing him well, he was considering that :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzge: last board for this round, i hope to see you at 20:30 CET for round 4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bessi2: @d J,  @c to the jack and queen,  east better play another @d there otherwise easy 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Then if N ducks, diamond finesse and another spade|pg||
nt|cicus: E took an aggressive but sensible road|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: everyone's asking Macskasy about his bid:)|pg||
nt|cicus: oh just noticed E has only 1 @C so 11 tricks can be made|pg||

nt|granguru: excellent lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|passell: 3hearts was not the winning decision here|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 13 trs|pg||
nt|granguru: :(|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ybob: 11 tricks anyway if they play in @H, only 10 in @S|pg||
nt|taliga: (ok, not long clubs, but distributional hand anyway)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ybob: he can pich @D on 3th @C too|pg||
nt|ybob: probably only 10|pg||
nt|ybob: playing 4@S he plays trump at trick 2|pg||
nt|ybob: A@D and trump|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|passell: dbl or pass or even 2nt woulda worked out|pg||
nt|roswolf: dd i think maybe -2|pg||
nt|bagman: here declarer can afford to play the heart and take the club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense cannot take enough tricks to strip squeeze declarer to anything harmful|pg||
nt|cicus: I like 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In theory we are back in 7 minutes with Sweden vs Netherlands|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Expect a delay|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: thanks for watching, thanks for the commentators|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|chessmaste: East is after an entry in the Bulletin - except there isn't one|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sommer: I agreed to that -2|pg||
nt|bagman: W eloping with the small trumps; he knows the hearts are likely to be 5-0|pg||
nt|roswolf: re|pg||
nt|sommer: The Italian waiter struck again!!|pg||
nt|bagman: The club ruff was too early as S can discard a diamond on the next club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sorry, slightly flakey internet connection too - you'd think with 4 choices I could find one that was solid :)|pg||
nt|sommer: right..thats why it's -2 now|pg||
nt|sommer: you havent been a waiter in Italy, do you, Susan?:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N needs to take this and play a club for a diamond discard; if W wins this, he should take his two diamond tricks as long as he can|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Actually, this is Jan - I switched with Susan when we couldn't get Susan's computer on the internet; haven't been a waiter any place|pg||
nt|roswolf: natural to win i think|pg||
nt|sommer: ok:)|pg||
nt|bagman: S can hold @SK and QJT98 of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: We're at trick 5 now - did something not get through (still worrying about connection :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room the grand is being played in 4@H!!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: FROZEN AT TRICK 3|pg||
nt|sommer: "The Italian waiter" is a BBO "thing"...from a vue-graff in Italy some years ago, where a waiter fell over the pc cables and turned all off |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss deciding whether to take the diamond finesse - if he hadn't been doubled, of course he'd need it for 4 (losing 2 hearts and a spade) but doubled, he knows hearts aren't ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: breaking|pg||
nt|bagman: Diamond lucky in the grand hand because 4@H does not lose much more than 6@D would lose|pg||
nt|roswolf: jan what happened at t3 did north win @SA?|pg||
nt|bagman: That also shows why on IMPs dubious grands should not be bid; the opps might end up in game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: I'll keep playing out the hand and then if it doesn't get through to you, I'll have to close and start again and hope I can do better. But spade to A, Club Q on which S pitched a ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: diamond & W ruffed, diamond J winning, |pg||
nt|roswolf: TY JAN|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: big thanks to the commentators! :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: calm waters|pg||
nt|taliga: so it is reasonable to give a shot|pg||
