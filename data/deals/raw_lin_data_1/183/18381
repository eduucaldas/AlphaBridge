nt|iceking: not sure i could play def vs 2@H here, though bidding is little strange also as you are not sure you have fitt anywere|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Kunne Ãst ikke have overmeldt med 4 Ru?|pg||
nt|grebrof: the norwegians are naturalists (besides the bery weak NT in nonvul 1st-3rd) opposite the more artificial approach from the finnish|pg||

pc|cK|nt|grebrof: Stine has had some very good results, so its about time she got her chance for the national team (gautis being biased or not)|pg||
nt|grebrof: she is NOT playing with you now my friend :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2NT may be with 5 hearts so bidding an error|pg||
nt|diaoff: Hi all|pg||
nt|haans: missed a trick |pg||
nt|haans: defense|pg||
pc|h2|nt|zebutin: different openings from 1st/2nd hand and 3rd/4th for finnish pair, but from 1st and 2nd they play weak nt, and 1@D-1@S openings are 10-14 and 4card suit|pg||
nt|gautis2: :) ..well, cant argue with sucess, since 4@s was born to go down|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|zebutin: and if some pairs card interests you http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.2354|pg||
nt|zebutin: has convention card for all players it seems|pg||
nt|grebrof: Gunn Tove was in the winning team in 2007 - then partnering Siv Thoresen who is by many considered being the best female player in Norway. for the first time in many years (dont ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: a well deserved lead too|pg||

nt|grebrof: good start for Norway avoiding the impossible 4@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: some kind of Multi...|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
nt|haans: very high in hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 if E doesnt get a spade ruff|pg||
nt|diaoff: Need to find the @S ruff to beat 6@H|pg||
nt|haans: now slamming|pg||
nt|grebrof: good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 1nt 15-17 from 3rd hand|pg||
nt|haans: easy make in 3nt at last board|pg||
nt|haans: very few will bid to slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: may be pushed if EW saves too much|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: no game|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dbl or 3 @H?|pg||
nt|derric: likely passed out|pg||
mb|2H!|an|8-11, 4h bal ej 4s|nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@s on NS|pg||
nt|iceking: good slam here |pg||
nt|iceking: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|grebrof: the +15 @c comes into action|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pass or Correct|pg||
nt|diaoff: 4NT now, maybe?|pg||
nt|haans: yep find it now|pg||
nt|jbgood: but of course difficult to know what to do on S's cards - doesnt know about the di void|pg||
nt|diaoff: If she passes, She will soon find out the possibility I guess|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 h has poschances -by w at least|pg||

nt|bjurn:  1@H relay|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@H bal 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: lot of options for S|pg||

nt|jbgood: one push - yes, she will be wiser if W prefers @d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a grand.|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|psyck: chose drury|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@C probably one way drury|pg||
nt|sharkey: If N can find a take out x now....|pg||
nt|haans: 1. Interview Fulvio Fantoni http://www.confsudbridge.org/hitsII/fantoni001i.aspx: If you had to choose a convention, which one would you pick?|pg||
nt|haans: 2. Fantoni: Gazzilli... is a convention that I think should be used by all who play natural bridge|pg||
nt|haans: 3. Gazzilli:  http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/public/1239625981_14209_FT0_gazzillind.pdf |pg||
nt|grebrof: 2@d showing +8hp (if Gazilli)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn:  2@S more relay|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|psyck: 2@d showing a good opening with at least game interest|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D real opening,as i play myself here i would bid 3@D with north hand natural and slammish|pg||
nt|nubmaster: So a good start for Sweden here|pg||
nt|gautis2: partscore battle|pg||
nt|grebrof: as a guess I would think the dbl of 1@h from E is 5-7hp - their card says nothing about what "neg dbls" are|pg||
nt|gautis2: i guess x shows hp s not @s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: too complicated to remember Haans:)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D GF if strong|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is a game|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6@D had been my choice|pg||
nt|jbgood: dbl seems a bit much? Prd is likely to have 10 minor cards...|pg||
nt|haans: scary|pg||
nt|haans: best for EW|pg||
nt|derric: ok, wouldn't re-open opposite 12-14NT|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|psyck: 3@d a nice treatment there Magnus|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 3D/3H transfer nodays 3@C just showing max|pg||
nt|jbgood: so a doubled overtrick...|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree its a good convention - you rarely stop in 2@c anyway|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would for sure|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not much to lose, lots to gain|pg||
nt|runnerup: 800 -a game yes|pg||
nt|runnerup: and for nothing real game |pg||
nt|mmmakela: and Hulda did nice to pas(of course imo)|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok 500 |pg||
nt|mmmakela: although 4 @H might slip home this is a sure winner|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes nicely nosed to pass -good decision|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bidding duplicated in OR|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok that s for that winning then|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 4@h seems to need to find @dQ, tho 4th @s could be useful|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|zebutin: in 4@H you would seem to lose 2 @S + @C, because spades are 3-3 you can throw one diamond to 4th spade|pg||
nt|zebutin: so might not need to quess diamond suit|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room finnish women played 2@S some down, there is magic diamond system in effect, that has 8-11 openings in 1st and 2nd hand, so makes often for different scores|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is a very good contract for NS|pg||
nt|haans: You can later read: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/public/1239625981_14209_FT0_gazzillind.pdf |pg||
nt|bjurn:  2NT 3433 or 34(42) (I think)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2NT =4@C (ty kibs)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@S 3424, 3 controls (A=2, K=1)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  so EW will probably end up in 4@S now|pg||
nt|haans: may go slamming?|pg||
nt|bjurn:  E needs @HA, @DK and @DA to be onside|pg||
nt|haans: clubs king in diamond|pg||
nt|bjurn:  or @DAK and @HA to be onside|pg||
nt|bjurn:  @SJxx @HQxxx @DAK @Cxxxx might be a picture|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|psyck: N will likely blast to slam in spite of missing a keycard|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Anyone who can tell us about the bidding here? 2NT like good/bad NT or something?|pg||
nt|haans: thats a "modern" weak 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl from N is good seing the layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: W made a very light 3rd seat opening in open room|pg||
nt|grebrof: can they count to 13?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  THis aggressive lead will cost the defense a trick, and HQ another one, so all of a sudden nine tricks turned to eleven. No big deal in teams though |pg||
nt|haans: scoring blood|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@S is a mild slam try, if I remember correctly|pg||
nt|haans: do like that bidding :)|pg||
nt|haans: often you start with relays all ending in slam Then you get older|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: wonder what 5@s here was|pg||
nt|iceking: 4nt might be even number of aces |pg||
nt|psyck: oh Turbo|pg||
nt|iceking: at least it looks like it |pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably negative|pg||
nt|iceking: been told 4nt shows 3+aces|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, not Turbo then, just their own methods|pg||
nt|iceking: nicely done anyway |pg||
nt|nubmaster: well done here, both K and J in @s works so no trouble with Q of @h offside|pg||
nt|gautis2: not fan of 4@h  ..better to do an invitasional bid after 2@s ...not this "shot"|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is sometimes the problem with strong 1@c - in a contested auction like this, you dont always know if 2@s is a bid with 4 or 5 @ss - now they escaped|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe...|pg||
nt|sharkey: may escape with down 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice to see such a young table in a very strong competition like this|pg||
nt|haans: dont understand @DA now does Fuglestad know who has @DK and Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E can therefore 5NT.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|zebutin: good day Juho, its allready 14.00 in finland...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Juho, 2100 in Melbourne|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks and next|pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like one loser in each suit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|gautis2: y, should  be 200|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - 4 nt told about 4 @ds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: EW play udca, 1st discard o/e|pg||
nt|bjurn:  wont be any problem to get 11 tricks here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: after Souths free bid & jump to 4@s, N could have also bid slam other table, but was tougher after opps intervention i guess|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: :( :( :( Gazzilli :( :( :(|pg||
nt|grebrof: lol|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Back to nine again. Interesting|pg||
nt|gautis2: board 1 was a coopy of 3NT, so well done to both teams|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like the overtrick has gone - much easier for us seeing all cards to make 12 of course|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|haans: Rimsted should have started with Blackwood|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|grebrof: otherwise I agree with not bidding 4@h (allthou it looks like P has a single @s) but P only made a single raise - guess they have ways to show a better raise - well, the ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: vulnerability is "right", so can understand 4@h too|pg||
nt|diaoff: Unless color blind, the opps also know the vulnerabilities, so I also vote for 6@D.|pg||
nt|haans: and play must be safe|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|haans: best defense|pg||
nt|diaoff: Thats also easier from here than at the table though...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nubmaster: In Open Marie and Pia get to 4@h which seems to be doomed, especially when E lead a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was a bad play. return @cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and defence will have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not finessing @h first round... doesn't matter if E got the Q alone... E indicates both A and Q of @s because of the play|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|runnerup: j spades and 800|pg||
nt|derric: declarer discarding @DJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no|pg||
pc|s7|nt|iceking: 1@S in closed room was the problem, for sure S should have bidded more powerful bid then 1@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what bid did the damage? other than 6@S:)|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, good shape, decent 5 carder, & useful touching honors in @c|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah - but as I said more than once in the first match between these: it is easier seeing all hands|pg||
nt|yuval10: not a bad contract at all, but very misfortune breaks|pg||
nt|haans: I|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree she could have bid 6@h on the way|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mbruun:  I suppose 2D is a very light Multi, but Im not sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt be surprised, if East bids 3 NT here|pg||
nt|derric: pass by north?|pg||
nt|derric: i think they play precision|pg||
nt|zebutin: some would bid too, A + J109x seem quite nice values...no support for partner though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wondering. But not much for East - West|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@s was certainly possible|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - we will see|pg||
nt|sharkey: i think the hand was open then Espen - shud have read the ending|pg||
nt|haans: little weak for 3@H|pg||
nt|grebrof: the contract is wrong and there are more failures that awaits when you are there|pg||
nt|grebrof: normal frisky nonul opening from S|pg||
nt|sharkey: that is a WEAK 3@H....|pg||
nt|grebrof: I like it|pg||
nt|sharkey: been there - done that...:)|pg||
nt|haans: she had no perfect bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: N thinking slam?|pg||
nt|grebrof: as they said about Marty Bergens preempts like that: "It doesnt matter what you have, its still not good enough"|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@C-4@H |pg||
nt|haans: dirty 2@D|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1NT 14-16|pg||

nt|haans: may not make 3@H|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mbruun:  Sounds reasonable|pg||
nt|haans: or 4NT -5@S-7@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|iceking: S bid 4@S and east dbl |pg||

nt|runnerup: it doent help east had 1 club trick still already|pg||
nt|derric: i hope this is agreed as worse weak 2 major opening|pg||
nt|bjurn:  EW makes 5@S though, guessing @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Ahonen has quite bad values for balancing at red zone, even though has decent 6 card suit...but risks are quite high|pg||
nt|iceking: will be disaster if w gamble on 5@C here|pg||

mb|3S|nt|hawe45:  No comments...|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: option ofcourse but will catch very bad dummy and on best def will go for 1100|pg||
nt|haans: and spade lead?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Guess she asked for it - now just make it....|pg||
nt|grebrof: this CAN make|pg||
nt|haans: home if hearts better|pg||
nt|derric: yes, 0-7hcp 5-6M|pg||
nt|haans: ahh she have extra :)|pg||
nt|derric: this can be defeated|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: when she doesn't balance it argues bad spades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh dear... system error|pg||
nt|grebrof: N showing 20-21hp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this will probably run to the J, and N will switch to a Major. the question is - which one?|pg||
nt|haans: agressive defense are not called for|pg||
nt|runnerup: Anni dint open in other table ,althought they have also that weak,very weak 2h opening  |pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: Looks like 140 in sight for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Ah - East wanted to know, which major South had, before bidding 3 NT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Here you'd like to play canapé, first showing 4c @s and then longer @d but there's no room for that|pg||
nt|grebrof: the good @c-suit being the missing hp|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I bet she is not going to make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even be 170|pg||
nt|haans: Solid bidding by NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: y, fair upgrade|pg||
nt|grebrof: never lead from the J as they say - no leads look appealing for E|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very favourable layout.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|bjurn:  I wonder what 2@H by East would've meant|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: @s looks reasonable enough|pg||
nt|haans: in my book 5-5 er|pg||
pc|d5|nt|nubmaster: They play transfer bids over 1@c, ie 1@d=@h etc...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mbruun:  Careful defense will hold this to nine tricks, if South ducks heart in trick 2|pg||
nt|psyck: not a good start for Iceland|pg||
nt|iceking: might be the worsed possible dummy W could get|pg||
nt|iceking: now @D return and 4 down for 1100|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but major suit wastages were known on bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but couldn´t W suspect bad @s honours on E?|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Christer|pg||
nt|haans: yep my money on that 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is always a wrong line, but ok|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and will be, once N gets in with @C Q will play spades|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|yuval10: you only need from partner something like HXX for it to be very successful. not this time though|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or pd's suit?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  Alsowithout ducking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if 1@h shows @s - why not bid the 6-card @d?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|iceking: if w was on heat one dummy would be J9xx AKx Ax AJxx and 5@C is easy make |pg||
nt|gautis2: but this will probably fail by 1..  so i presume 4 more imps to Finland,..  I need my coffee..brb:)|pg||

pc|s7|nt|jbgood: anyone for a double from W of 3 @c ? |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: why @HK - ruff @S and low up better...|pg||

nt|mmmakela: but costly if wrong|pg||
nt|haans: duck once them KING my motto|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  East will not play @C - so 4 tricks to N/S anyway|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Agree Ralf, an error in the system here or a bidding misunderstanding, think it's the first one though|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I'm sure 2@d is conventional here so there was no room for it as natural|pg||
pc|c2|nt|grebrof: I think it is a good slam and noone would have made it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  If your prempts can be such as in this case, partner should me more cautious|pg||
nt|haans: but lucky no clubs lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good play of @H for an additional entry to hand.|pg||

nt|derric: now give away a @D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 hearts 1st but then must play dias|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yuval10: declarer has 7 tricks even without the @d finesse - 2@c, 1@h, 1@s, 1@d, so had South played @d, it was possible that E would just play the Ace|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: oldest of them all|pg||
pc|h6|nt|derric: conceding down 1 now i suppose|pg||
nt|derric: oh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can´t understand why a 4-card is more important to show than to bid 1@d|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|iceking: 800 for 14imps |pg||
nt|nubmaster: But perhaps E will skip the @s and just go for the @ds from the start, it's teams and gamebonus looks really far away|pg||
nt|ralfwil: !½s10|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c10...|pg||
nt|yuval10: unless NS are playing 2nd/4th carding , then the K@d is marked|pg||
nt|haans: endplaying North|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nubmaster: 2@d direct is weak with @ds but she prefered showing the @ss first and then after a possible 1@s/1NT she could've used XY-NT to 2@d|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Cost 7 imp for just a partscore|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Is there a break or something op?|pg||

nt|grebrof: reversing with  a single was not the best idea from Marianne Harding it seems|pg||

nt|diaoff: Excl RKC according to CC|pg||
nt|derric: good morning here then|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: easiest a clubs finesse?|pg||
nt|diaoff: Best to play on @H I'd say|pg||
nt|haans: need a lot of thinking|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  In fact, the North hand is no so strong - the @DÂ´s doubtful values|pg||
nt|mbruun:  With no aces you should subtract 1 HCP from the hand. Good intermediates are a plus on the other side|pg||
nt|gautis2: seems like a not agreed auction in OR|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe she wanted to bid 3@h :)|pg||

nt|psyck: if 4@c instead, they could have possibly landed in 4@s|pg||

nt|grebrof: the 1nt-opener didnt know she actually had shown 15-17 already (at the other table)|pg||

pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  Sure - but the @D-doubleton is not so great|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, clubs depend quite much how you play them that how friendly they are...with this lead they are friendly enough|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|grebrof: where is the @c K?|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|iceking: 10 tricks for one imp gain for Denmark|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes blind spot|pg||
nt|bagman: the risk being that club ruffed, @HA and another club ruff|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Lirarna missed the game on board 3 in the open room|pg||
nt|bagman: A very low risk and typically one should not throw away an easy overtrick|pg||

nt|grebrof: well played anyway - as kibz suggest - @d A was not a success|pg||

nt|haans: bidding it as a NT hand correct for me|pg||

nt|haans: 1@H would have been natural but 8-11|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps W will just bid 3 NT|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|hawe45:  6 @S is the right bid from West now|pg||
nt|mbruun:  6 Sp right away to apply pressure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We could play together, Mathisa|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Im a little concerned that I agree with you, about the bidding I mean |pg||
nt|ianmcc: close to a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @S would have been a better bid than 5!|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Very difficult for NS to get to the grand. I predict EW will buy it in 6 S X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But this might work - and West will not "sell out"|pg||
nt|zebutin: more or less clear 4@H... but if they feel bold they might even shoot for 6@H...|pg||
nt|zebutin: which isnt the best contract, but i have been in worse...|pg||

nt|haans: Yes she think so but ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  - not if South bids 7 @C now, Mathias...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: must be odds-on|pg||
nt|iceking: another drury hand|pg||
nt|psyck: S likes hand better after opps bid @s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in the contrary, most intriguing contract to play and defend very often|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@C minimum|pg||
nt|haans: often min|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mbruun:  Impressive|pg||
nt|mbruun:  West knows 7 Sp is good insurance, but always difficult to save in a hot aucton like this. She should do it right I think  |pg||
nt|zebutin: 3@S most likely splinter of some sort, Pia might like her hand now because only Axxx in @S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: trump 2 @s and lose a diaamond|pg||
nt|haans: dont like that 2NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: EW getting very exited here :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: hmm, some play something like that or 13-17 in carrot club still...havent seen that working too well... :)|pg||
nt|haans: Multi was biggest at the 80th but still on in Scandinavia|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Well done all around|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From Wests point of view, 7 @S might cost about 500 only - with more @C by East|pg||
nt|gautis2: good result for Norway OR. .. seems hard with heart lead?|pg||
nt|zebutin: sorry, private|pg||

nt|haans: 3@C min better than normal Jacoby|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: Gib says it makes..I have to get MORE coffee:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: their cc says multilandy, so i guess 2 NT asked for the minor..|pg||
nt|haans: blood|pg||
nt|rnmalik: pass and trouble:)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@D game try, or slam try here|pg||
nt|haans: singel or asking for singel|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|derric: pessimistic|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@H very agressive and will catch perfect dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: that made S's choice easier, esp with vul game at stake|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Mikael G told me that the operator is new and are in training so we will have some allowance here... and she has no time to comment|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Heart lead is the killer|pg||
nt|grebrof: the small cards in dummy makes it easier to overtake the Q too, cause there are many layout where N will have a @h-suit good enough for it to run later|pg||
nt|gautis2: as I can see, I am agree..|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No RD, please, that would loose 2 IMPÂ´s to 2140|pg||
nt|zebutin: well trumps cant be too badly, and with diamond lead neither can any other suits either so has enough entries&etc|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Sry, not Mikael, it was his dad, Johan who told me :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 3@H I think|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@S needs heart K onside and hearts 3-3, 4-2 or J singleton; it is clearly under 50% and thus should not be bid|pg||
nt|bagman: In case NS need desperately a swing the slam would be good :)|pg||
nt|haans: cue mandatory to show cue below game|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hawe45:  One @H-trick might "disappear" here|pg||
nt|haans: in a good day acceptable|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not @DA or @HK|pg||
nt|bjurn:  42%-ish, vul, might be an options but it's too early in the match IMO|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|derric: trumps 4-1 and @c:s 4-2?|pg||
nt|grebrof: my style is 1@d last hand too - if P cant answer 1@d, you rarely have any game|pg||
nt|haans: jack lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: the (persumably ) weak NT in the OR made many problems to the Swede pair|pg||
nt|haans: yes yout style is my style 2 but not with @CK singel|pg||
mb|5S!|nt|bagman: AKQxxx Jx xxx xx would make the slam better|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|nt|zebutin: something like that most likely is enough|pg||
nt|derric: the @HJT help a lot|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: Norway went down in 6 @d in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  North will have to cash AK now otherwise she will be endplayed|pg||
nt|bagman: When E wins the @HK the auction tells that he must switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|bagman: w|pg||
nt|bjurn:  unless E decides to lead @H|pg||

nt|haans: E do have a natural lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|grebrof: well played so far|pg||
nt|bjurn:  N's failure to cuebid @Ds might encourage him to lead @DA|pg||
nt|bagman: E has an easy @CQ lead; N might win a spade and immediately take the heart finesse with @HQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mbruun:  Good stop at the other table on board 4 to bring Denmark in the match|pg||

nt|psyck: dec played for @s fin wrong i guess, expecting to lose 1@s, 2@c ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, normally (lately after Sweden was superior), the tendency has been that it is close encounters these nordic chamionships|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|zebutin: maybe they play 2@S as constructive and 3@S as weaker variant...|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|derric: though she can still try to endplay E and go -3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|bjurn:  maybe N should've bid 3@H looking for help in @S?|pg||

nt|cenglund:  I can't understand S's reasoning. The board is like an open book|pg||
nt|haans: @HK Big|pg||
nt|runnerup: really action boards ..he he..|pg||
nt|bjurn:  this wont be a push|pg||
mb|1S|nt|grebrof: sometimes running your winners will squeese your opponents - can be a good strategy even if you dont have enough tricks to begin with too|pg||
nt|sharkey: N shud hardly have Ax in @C as wud overtake and return 1. trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@S 17+|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D|pg||
nt|haans: hard fight here|pg||
nt|haans: Opening weaker and weaker (aceless hand 11 hcp)|pg||
nt|haans: openers have gone down for 50 years|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|diaoff: Potential for some action, yes|pg||
nt|haans: not all just overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: what to bid on Johanssons 2@H ?|pg||
nt|gautis2: 500 is a good score.. 4@h seems like few loosers, but not enough winners?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can they bid the slam?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 0-7|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 3@S with good guess in trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless EW score a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|bjurn:  I must confess that I would've opened souths hand as well, at least in a strong club system|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rnmalik: EW have good play for 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 3@d|pg||
nt|iceking: should have no problems stop in 4@H here|pg||
nt|psyck: 5 level is safe too i guess|pg||
nt|iceking: would be good to have 3@H forcing here |pg||
nt|nubmaster: If 2NT shows the red suits why not start with 4@h and then 5@d? But N took it for the minors because of the fact that the 1@c opening is 2+?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3-3 to paly here|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I guess without the @s lead, you can possibly make some @d-tricks, but|pg||
nt|haans: system works well here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - think they'll bid slam|pg||
nt|haans: but Blackwwod a problem = 2 keys missing|pg||
nt|haans: urp|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4@S not doubled Optimal contract|pg||
nt|diaoff: Expected a Dbl there, yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: must start on @d at once to win this - and use @d to pull S's 4th trump - very difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: lucky that N has all the aces|pg||
nt|jbgood: club ace with S and the contract would stand no chance on best def|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well this one at least looks like an opening(almost?)|pg||
nt|haans: all you can say is URKKK|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@C game try in spades with 4@Ss|pg||
nt|haans: yes most of us would|pg||
nt|bagman: W likely to lead @CQ or a low heart|pg||
pc|dT|nt|iceking: and that is logical if bypass @D with marginal canape hands|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h will now be frcd after 4th suit bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but 4@d will also do and after 4@h = no @s control|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Forcing?|pg||
nt|gautis2: this play will take sometime..belive me:)|pg||
nt|derric: 2@d = Gf 5+@d4M|pg||
nt|bjurn:  might try @DT|pg||
nt|bjurn:  :)|pg||
nt|haans: good lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mbruun:  Denmark gained 7 IMP on board 5, because South unblocked her AK of hearts in due time, so 7 Sp X was five off|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a happy spot|pg||
nt|zebutin: well no double... seems like 2 down or something|pg||
nt|grebrof: I assume the 5 from E|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they play count when Q is at the table|pg||
nt|gautis2: not best lead.. may make now|pg||
nt|haans: yep 0-7 is 0-7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|iceking: so 3@H and now S will deny @S control so should end in 4@H|pg||
nt|iceking: Danish que-bidding style is though little odd at least i have never understood it|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S shows interest in slam perhaps N shud be able to bid it based on @H length and max|pg||
nt|grebrof: Magic Diamond comes from Sweden originally, but many play it in  Finland too - they are more artificial in Sweden-Finland than we are in Norway-Denmark - I have myself sat down ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: that 1@c meant either a) 5-11hp any suit or b) 17hp+ any distribution - conventions like that are not allowed in Norway, but it is fun, isnt it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: East are at the bathroom|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The play of the Finnish ladies has been mildly put rather sloppy|pg||
nt|haans: i do assume they would not bid 1@H with A+K|pg||
nt|grebrof: when do you get to go, Johanna?|pg||
nt|haans: 52% slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be S or N shud have made more efforts here....|pg||
pc|d3|nt|iceking: undo|pg||
nt|gautis2: ..but a fair normal lead|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Spade must be attacked otherwise diamonds will be established|pg||
nt|grebrof: curiousity is always there with AK in a suit|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt played by East please|pg||
nt|bagman: Hopes to score a ruff and two spades :9|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psyck: we see what you mean Magnus :)|pg||
nt|iceking: so 3@S could maybe ask for @S control |pg||
nt|iceking: Danish asking bid i think they call it|pg||
nt|gautis2: God have given u an ace for one reason...take it!|pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: that card was meant for entry to dummy...|pg||
nt|diaoff: Needed that entry I'm afraid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: can not make Blackwood|pg||
nt|diaoff: You're faster :), but now it makes again|pg||
nt|jbgood: ok - no duck and no dinner:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: but it aint over yet|pg||
nt|haans: ok goes this time|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Difficult lead for West, and DK is natural but unfortunate|pg||
nt|iceking: dont try this at home folks :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: never , I can't leave my chair :)|pg||
nt|derric: maybe if S was gonna open, try 1NT|pg||
nt|haans: low @D = lavinthal for clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: S was unlikely to guess the trumps anyhow but the ruff makes sure of beating this|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cenglund:  This is capitulation|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ianmcc: this looking a bit better|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks and next....|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like ew 1nt without this mini opening so some imps |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Nice layout for declarer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: and 13 tricks - next|pg||
nt|iceking: ok 3@S was here some slam potential without shortness|pg||
nt|grebrof: hard to see any reason for the trumpshift|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iceking: so in a way they didnt know @S quebid was on or missing |pg||
pc|s6|nt|cenglund:  Even spade shift may not be enough to set the contact|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gautis2: as long @h K stiff, I think this was home after lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s-shift - and then?|pg||
nt|gautis2: dia|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok, bang down @h A and small @c later from W|pg||
nt|grebrof: or another @s|pg||
nt|gautis2: cant get another @s from W...just borned with one :)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Trump lead might help|pg||
nt|gautis2: that s true|pg||
nt|runnerup: finnish ladys found a better fit 4-3 |pg||
pc|sA|nt|grebrof: yes, but small @c AND a new @s is a monster - maybe|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ianmcc: It will make soon|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: now it is|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still not enough to win the board...|pg||

nt|jbgood: big numbers all over the place|pg||
nt|jbgood: 990 OR|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|derric: or trump after @HJ|pg||

nt|jbgood: making here and 9 imps away...|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|zebutin: other room got to stop in 2@D just made, so nice pick up for finns|pg||
nt|zebutin: if doesnt play 3 round spades, might be even more down|pg||

nt|runnerup: east missed to take her d ace|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|ianmcc: 3@d had good chances tho only 8 tricks other table|pg||

nt|bjurn:  a chance for Lirarna to earn some overtrick IMPs|pg||

mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  Yes  - but after a slow start|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This looks like a coffee-board for 420 N/S|pg||
nt|mbruun:  4 Sp seems to be the spot, and its a very natural contract|pg||

mb|1S|nt|haans: prefer 3nt to 5@C|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|zebutin: 2@D most likely multi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks with open cards|pg||
nt|iceking: slam makes |pg||
nt|haans: not more than 3@S|pg||
nt|haans: 1NT-3NT?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sorry misspeek|pg||
nt|bjurn:  South wont be able to find @HK with North|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT is clearly better than 5m as there are 9+ top tricks and nobody can ruff any of the winners|pg||
mb|d|nt|nubmaster: In open the Icelandic ended up in 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Johansson has many quick tricks in hand, so didnt want to bid lame 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: or east could maybe dbl 3@D here |pg||
nt|jbgood: Norway had a bye last round - seems like they have problems adjusting to playing again...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what a hand, a nightmare:)|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S a make|pg||
nt|bagman: As the auction tempoed, 3NT is nearly impossible to reach|pg||
mb|4D|nt|iceking: 3@D looks alot down 5-6 down|pg||
nt|derric: would you bid the south hand?|pg||
nt|haans: good question what does Pass show now|pg||
nt|haans: 6@C+1@S+1@S+1@H?|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes h lead lets this home|pg||
nt|mmmakela: spade J lead anyone?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  North will raise to three, and a well placed DK will make South go to game|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Ah, started to write that before it showed up on the screen, sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have 12 top tricks and it looks possible that you can squeeze your way to the 13th|pg||
nt|psyck:  could there be 13 tricks here with W squeezed in majors?|pg||
nt|haans: How many knows that?|pg||
nt|haans: OR bid 5@C alone|pg||
nt|bjurn:  South might try 4@S now|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@S makes 450?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|grebrof: 1@c +15hp|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1@s balanced +9 or 4441|pg||
nt|haans: of you lead @SJ = call TD|pg||
nt|derric: now @S towards K and pray|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 3@s is presumably preempting|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 8-11 ? really?|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S the winner|pg||
nt|runnerup: same in other room -bidding and lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: did we get the result  of board 2 Johanna?  |pg||
nt|cenglund:  This a better slam than the previous one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: some prospects|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room they got to open 1@H telling 4+ @H and 8-11...and after that sailed to 3nt|pg||
nt|derric: 3NT went down after declarer broke entries in open|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Cards are not lying in favour of making 6NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: I would XX ;)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|zebutin: this lead destroys one entry to @C suit, but give ruffing finese in @S suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: became a winner - 500 was available|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes, you have the values, showing a hand worth 18-19.|pg||
nt|haans: Asplund had cards for double of 2@D|pg||
nt|bagman: There's little in the play as declarer drives out the @SA and then cashes his top trumps and scores 420 or 450 depending on the spade break|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gautis2: and they figure it out, so a  stop...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finnish ladies avoided the tempation|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I think the director chosed to let it be (4heartsx-2), but I'm not shore!|pg||
nt|grebrof: not that I can see EW doing something viable over 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may have bid 4@S with West hand - but 5332 distribution is a negative|pg||
nt|santyclz: 29 hcp so it may not be automatic to get there.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mmmakela: no stayman....need some points from pd.....heart lead might give it away...... so not impossible.....|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|zebutin: so if takes that, she is losing 2@D + @H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Maybe 4@s here|pg||
nt|gautis2: ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: I wouldnt change that board 2 either|pg||
nt|grebrof: but ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: not the best lead here|pg||
nt|grebrof: if there is any|pg||
pc|cT|nt|nubmaster: good bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep, surely not 7... 6 will probably be good enough|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|ianmcc: it removes a useful entry|pg||
nt|psyck: stopping low with a key card missing & the 3@d x|pg||
nt|haans: rersponder tend to make transfers all the time|pg||
nt|haans: must play spade now|pg||
nt|haans: no futher delay|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont really understand why east didnt dbl 3@D|pg||
nt|iceking: east should know dummy in 3@D dbl will hold most often 0-1@D and very few hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this might be a chance for the Swedes in the OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly left the door open.|pg||
nt|haans: so she may not have understood the Pass|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true, xx @S was acceptable to P.|pg||
nt|haans: not fun but must|pg||
nt|mmmakela: is it clear it's the best play?|pg||
nt|runnerup: no but only change |pg||
nt|haans: of you know all cards you may endplay|pg||
nt|haans: but you dont|pg||
pc|s4|nt|nubmaster: They must continue @d after the 2 @c to take away the entrance to E|pg||
nt|psyck:  as usual, minor slams with borderline values tuf to get to|pg||
nt|yuval10: using a natural system it looks like 1NT - 2@c - 2@h  - 3@d and then N should lead the way with 3 keycards and a Q of trump|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I can think of some layouts where 4xclubs now is the winning line|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|psyck: double dummy, you can reel off 8 tricks in the majors & squeeze South in the minors for the rest|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|gautis2: I told it was a close group a while ago, with 2 VP fom 1st to 3rd...  as we speak, it is actually thighter! (1 VP 1st-3rd :))|pg||
nt|haans: but could E have passed with Qxxxxxx and no more|pg||
nt|runnerup: youll loose 3h +1 sp+1 d |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wrong pitch, I think she needed @cK onside|pg||
nt|zebutin: discarded @C so doesnt have to take @C finese, but @D suit is so lousy they will not raise as any extra tricks, so needs Ax(x) in front of @D K|pg||
nt|rnmalik: doubt, @C honours were the catch and stiff @H.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: yep :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: like it when east thinks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nubmaster: @d now or she makes|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|haans: even 1NT would have been transfer|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam bidding not the strength of the Finnish women in this match|pg||
nt|grebrof: last board was the first nonconquested auction NS had - EW are not known for being shut off|pg||
nt|haans: its not fashion today to pen double|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|vugraphzdq: Vist Gunn says that she would have play different if she had get the correct information and then only loose one trick, so the result only would be down one|pg||

nt|grebrof: shouldnt|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Game over |pg||
nt|zebutin: ofcourse can still take @C finese if wants to, but little riskier|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  South will not hav to fear a singleton @C - in case, this would have been played earlier - and faster...|pg||

nt|mbruun:  I think this was misscored|pg||
nt|hawe45:  miss-score for the ladies|pg||
nt|iceking: slam made in open room so 11 imps to Denmark|pg||
nt|grebrof: a club lead here is a disaster, but 5@d is safe|pg||
nt|grebrof: or, is it...|pg||
nt|haans: i would not have opened 1@H = no opening only 8-11 hcp|pg||
nt|sharkey: on Bd 22 4@S also made in OR - quite surprising...|pg||
nt|haans: mayor error in diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h was 8-11 and prob 3 card support - so 5@h was not to be recommended - trumps might easily have been 4-1 |pg||
nt|jbgood: and even 4@h might have been in trouble|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cenglund:  It's not on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|derric: @s overcall?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: undo|pg||
nt|gautis2: this seems like a hughe result in OR|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - if you have a fit, its a lot more than just 11hp|pg||
nt|haans: now 1@S is right|pg||
nt|sharkey: lots of voids in these hands - who's been dealing?|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt going down down down|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H no make|pg||
nt|haans: double better tyhan 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|bjurn:  in the OR North opened 2@S (6+@S, 10-13) giving EW less space to find 3@C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: 3nt?|pg||
mb|d|nt|grebrof: @d lead (a trump lead) kills 5@s too|pg||
nt|grebrof: 5@d|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk5: Vore kampe kl. 15.00 efter lunchpausen bliver Island-Danmark Open og Sverige-Finland Damer|pg||
nt|grebrof: I see swedish juniors open frequently at 8-9hp bal -  its their style - no system is perfect|pg||
nt|haans: NS bidding right this far|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H uppercut in clubs|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 3 is too high since S will get a heart promotion|pg||
nt|bagman: On a good day both hearts and clubs behave and EW can make a NT game. No both suits are unfriendly and resulted in 3 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Another grand slam|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Two grands in nie hands. Good cardshufflers|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: yes the last one was misscored, it was equal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and good bidders|pg||
nt|haans: would have preferred 3@H to 2|pg||
nt|haans: usually not hearts|pg||
nt|haans: easy way to win IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: W might even let this go undoubled|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@S should go a few down but there isnt that many losers so EW cant afford to slip too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: offshape overcall with 4cards, offshape x without 3rd @D...so many options for bidding...|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 1nt is 12-14. Last hand w opened 1nt with bal 13hcp|pg||
nt|ralfwil: dbl is 500|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@H is some bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: no hcp no shape no controls |pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: hard to stay below game now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|grebrof: never buy a thai keyboard - mainly I am guessing :D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The blockage in hearts is awkward for declarer in 5D|pg||
nt|bjurn:  good lead!|pg||
nt|bagman: EW are likely to score 2 spades by E , diamond overruf by W and the @CA|pg||
nt|bjurn:  @DK, @C towards the @CK?|pg||
nt|bagman: If west gets in with the @CA he can shoot a trump thru kill the club ruff|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: low score|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody steals from e.  5332 with a marginal (?) suit.|pg||
nt|haans: 31S now focing in my book|pg||
nt|runnerup: this looks like 2 down |pg||
pc|d6|nt|mbruun:  You have to play some kind of Exclusion-blackwood to bid it. Very difficult|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @C (W) - 4 @H (E) - 5 NT - how difficult can you make it, Culbertsonour good old freind|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I exclude exclusion|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Board 6 is also misscored. Hopefully they will be corrected shortly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph lead is normal on the bidding|pg||
nt|derric: shouldn't be a problem on this lie of cards|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: Sorry, I'm lost..|pg||
nt|haans: np :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: syntax error?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|derric: 1@c is 15+ i believe|pg||
nt|zebutin: but i think they have some bid over strong @C that tells majors, so even that could have been option...|pg||
nt|derric: i don't know if x is take-out|pg||
pc|d2|nt|grebrof: not sure I would have bid in these circumstnces anyway|pg||
pc|d4|nt|zebutin: seems like will lose atleast 3 @S, @D and @C...and cant raise @D suit either before has removed all trumps, and might lose control because of @C suit...|pg||
nt|zebutin: so needs some delicate play|pg||
nt|iceking: east should signal with @S K here|pg||
nt|haans: in scandinavia we all use reverse carding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|grebrof: not all|pg||
nt|yuval10: South needs to switch to @c before she cash the 2nd @d of course|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mbruun:  In the Open series, the Danish West, HC Graversen lead the HA to beat 3 NT by one on board 6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I doÂ´nt know heir system (either) - but 4 @C from West instead of 3 @H would have been better|pg||
nt|cenglund:  This may be a huge swing|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psyck: maybe worried @sK would suggest @d pref|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1@c opening in the other room contains a whole lot of diffferent stuff, so not that strange that lead wasnt found|pg||
nt|gautis2: yes, will be 11 imps to Norway|pg||
nt|grebrof: allthou I do prefer it|pg||
nt|haans: but: shogunng: but you have to take sps first|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  Next board...|pg||
nt|mbruun:  It seems strange to give up the investigations|pg||
nt|iceking: yes probably thinking about that|pg||
nt|santyclz: She was listening...|pg||
nt|jbgood: halfway through - and N has not scored a single imp..|pg||
nt|diaoff: Needed to score the club trick first|pg||
nt|jbgood: the pure downer has gone now - S needed to cash 2 clubs - but a club to the king and another is testing, E will have to double finesse @h 10-9 to make it|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I think 4@s will make so 5@h will probablu be correct... anyone to analyse if 4@s can be set?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: South cannot have 5 hearts|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Defence can't afford a slightest slip |pg||
pc|d9|nt|zebutin: this seems to be on road for atleast 1 down at this rate|pg||
nt|zebutin: but with @C return is able to raise @C suit, so defence needs to be sharp too|pg||
nt|derric: 4 black suit ruffs and @DAK@hAK would make 8|pg||
nt|sharkey: Marianne had a difficult decision over 4@S - 5@D not a winner this time as 4@S wud have failed|pg||
nt|bjurn:  should be 2 down now|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mbruun:  How about 5D after 4c. When partner shows two aces bid 5 N and partner will cuebid 6 H which will get them to the grand. Maybe they have other agreements of course|pg||
nt|haans: so the big question is Will 3@H make |pg||
nt|bagman: Not much for N to do; loses two clubs as cannot ruff the 2nd club loser|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|yuval10: the 4@c helped, of course|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

pc|c6|nt|jbgood: one can understand that their inspiration is not at its peak|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: can make a lot with majors favorable|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  DoesÂ´nt matter - it forces East to show the suits with control, and 4 @H is a true dream to hear|pg||

nt|rnmalik: @D was tranfer to @H?|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mbruun:  But declarer can only come to eight tricks any way|pg||
nt|jbgood: N has shown 20-21, and 2@d was waiting - showing cards|pg||
nt|diaoff: Not straightforward on a @D lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: if could be a bigger pickup if this goes down, say if dec reads cards wrong|pg||

nt|psyck: *now more|pg||

pc|s6|nt|sharkey: a lot easier with all hands in view|pg||

nt|yuval10: now it's making again, if South play @h to Ace then J@h discarding @c|pg||

pc|c7|nt|grebrof: brb - my woman went away on a "businesstrip", so I am doing the laundry . imagine! :)|pg||

pc|cK|nt|mbruun:  Forget the 10 IMPs for Denmark on board 8, and the 3 IMP for Norway on board 6. Difficulties in correcting these scores, but they are not right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so far-fetched for West to double 3 NT and take the 800 on a normal @S-lead. If you doÂ´nt now and then write 750 for the opponents, you havÂ´ent doubled enough|pg||
nt|mbruun:  The actual standing should be 20-16 for Norway|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You did well, Yuval|pg||
nt|yuval10: :) tack|pg||
nt|jbgood: i am afraid the standing is 50-0 - unless 3@h really made on   25 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT for NS and tea break.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: big chance for E/W|pg||
nt|haans: Big diamond 17+|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not very nice to go down in NT when 7 min available|pg||
nt|bagman: S not happy, though, as he cannot be sure that he lost only 5; could be worse if team mates missed the game or went minus in the game|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@H might give Lirarna a chance here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|derric: pass over 4@s by E wasn't good with 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|zebutin: cecilia didnt double with QJ1098 of spades when opponents were in 4@S...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Easy 12 tricks here in NT or @cs, let's see what Katrine and jessica will do|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S nat forcing|pg||
nt|sharkey: another slam possibility for the Finns...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another slam, this time a cold one|pg||
mb|2C|nt|zebutin: 3@D ? invite to fullgame?|pg||

nt|yuval10: this hand should be interesting as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: easy 3nt if no Hearts lead :)|pg||

nt|haans: and so we learn :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - we will see|pg||
nt|haans: Big Diamonds has its problems|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H not GF I think|pg||
nt|cenglund:  You shouldn't miss this one under any circumstances|pg||
nt|grebrof: allthou these are artificial bidders - it might not be so easy|pg||
nt|haans: Magic Diamonds comes from Carroy Clubs as natural as possible (possible)|pg||
nt|psyck: this should be easier to get also for E|pg||
nt|santyclz: A slam too good for Roland  but sub-par for the rest of us.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Off an ace and qjxx of trump.|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks as if it made on a different defense than we saw.. |pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  THis board wont take long. 450 for EW |pg||
nt|hawe45:  450 both tables, next|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s - at least on this board|pg||
nt|sharkey: as long as N can show @S support shud be in slam|pg||
nt|psyck: slam may still go down if bid, if dec played N for single @h honor|pg||
nt|jbgood: and this one presents no problems - duck and ten on a @d endplaying E|pg||
nt|runnerup: now 4h ew looks diificult to bid  -can it to made dont know but lookes possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: what?|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: well - N doesnt have a lot to offer besides @s-support|pg||
nt|grebrof: did S show @S now?|pg||
nt|haans: step respone = four cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: well - thats all S needs...|pg||
nt|bagman: In principle NS lose only heart, club and a diamond in heart contract|pg||
mb|3H|nt|iceking: on normal @C lead its possible win all the tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: it depends over the lead...if the lead is the natural @s lead then it looks like they should go for restricted choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but after a @d lead...|pg||
nt|iceking: creative lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: ty Hans|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Even the grand one is making|pg||
nt|sharkey: S probing - shud keep in mind they have messed up all slams so far|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud this be affecting South now?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I am not saying you should be in 7|pg||
nt|haans: missing @HK they wont|pg||
nt|haans: have they forgotten steps?|pg||
nt|haans: urkkkkkkkkkk|pg||
nt|bagman: In practice they might lose more|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nubmaster: After this start they will get to slam and make some imps here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice bidding so far:))|pg||
nt|runnerup: this if good stagegy -double and take your money wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Probably a push board|pg||
nt|gautis2: 3N is reached..seems like a flat board |pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: if the lead isn't @s then you can still make it if the hand with 3 @h's also have 3 @d's|pg||
nt|haans: no @HT good card|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3/5th against suit :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: follow with @dQ|pg||
nt|iceking: unbid suit |pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sQ is a keycard|pg||
nt|jbgood: now E gets squeezed in the reds instead|pg||
nt|haans: good strategy but rare nowdays|pg||
nt|mmmakela: lead was risky imo from that holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: well, its only one board they lost in a slam position - N could hardly do anymore than 4@s now|pg||
nt|grebrof: well done by S|pg||
nt|sharkey: N thinking 7?????|pg||
nt|sharkey: extras :)?|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe its Marianne in E|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hardly - I think|pg||
nt|haans: maybe asking about bids|pg||

nt|bjurn:  will be hard to find|pg||
nt|haans: true :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: will make now! win with @hK and a @s to @sA discard a @d on @cK|pg||
