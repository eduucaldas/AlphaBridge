nt|vugraphzds: 2 @D was 5 @H 4 @S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: hello good morning everyone|pg||
nt|milton_se: seems like 3NT is making - West is not likely to refrain from checking the spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzds: 3@H = transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|jbgood: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hi all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: as soon as they know singel diamonds off they go|pg||
nt|haans: 16 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: As it happens, E/W had no fit anywhere. Still, the opening bid was surely right.|pg||
nt|athene: normally if you open sub-minimum in third seat for the lead on a balanced hand you want to pass partner's response|pg||
nt|athene: but south has enough he isn't totally happy about abandoning partner to a possible (probable) 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, rebidding a 5-timer is not often the best idea in such circumstances. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hans Göthe from Sweden|pg||
nt|jakow:  12 14NT och simpel styman|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ísak|pg||

nt|milton_se: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good morning Roland, Bertil, Jon, Daniel and kibs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  With "normal" bidding this would be a tuff 4 @H E/W 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running scores   http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=474|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=474  for standings|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Four teams can still win it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Two of these playing here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: you might rebid 1NT if that was weak|pg||
nt|athene: but you would feel vaguely unhappy about it|pg||
nt|athene: still 2@D isn't wonderful either|pg||
nt|haans: have never seen it after 1@D-1@H-2D show 6 I say|pg||
nt|brolucius: There was little advantage in covering with the @HK. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt the first board|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good contract|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: N: 11-13 BAL, S: 5@D 4@H, FG, is what they showed in bidding|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 10/11|pg||
pc|sA|nt|diablo666: N/S playing strong club, E/W playing three way club.|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@c might go one down|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would have discarded @C 2, asking for @D|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: the lead set up declarer's ninth trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Play @sJ from dummy to keep entries on N|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  My norwegian collegue will explain this defence, please|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: The ace was bound to be offside and might (would) have dropped tripleton. Could not be doubleton or West would doubtless have overcalled.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: W shd play low to let E play ! J|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|haans: this bidding better that most play|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: of course, he doesn't know diamonds are breaking|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Not easy to bid though with low high card points and a dubious heart stopper|pg||
nt|milton_se: not likely|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Bertil|pg||
nt|shevek: @hQ has to be found|pg||
pc|c5|nt|milton_se: nice to have Sylvan's hand on the first board of the day|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: matches between a (supposedly) strong team and a (supposedly) weaker team can be tricky affairs. If the strong team fail to pick up some big swings early on, they can get anxious.|pg||
nt|haans: stronger team are stronger for they can wait|pg||
nt|athene: i assume west gave correct count there but east is still not sure about ducking - he is worried his partner might have the @SK, i suppose|pg||
nt|brolucius: The strong team fears that their rival strong teams will take the minnows to the cleaner's (not that I am one to mix metaphors).|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||

nt|athene: east should definitely exit a trump after ruffing|pg||
nt|athene: pinning declarer in hand|pg||
nt|athene: then west makes his @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: playing a spade through can't possibly be right - declarer can't have started with only four diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: so west isn't ruffing|pg||
nt|hawe45:  LetÂ´s be fair - Norway will hardly gain on board 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: upmark said he would take one more trick had it been pairs, by means of an endplay|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a good grand slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure is|pg||
mb|1N|nt|milton_se: was that correct, Daniel?|pg||
nt|iceak:  danger for EV to be in heart suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s ruff can defeat 6@h|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Ew has nice looking minor game here, will they bid slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: (and if west had more trumps he wouldn't have dropped his honours the way he did!)|pg||
nt|haans: ringt sloppy |pg||

mb|3D!|nt|haans: 4@H has a chance|pg||

nt|milton_se: hej Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 3@D alerted as showing 4441 shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: taking the trump in hand would be a serious mistake if 4-0 break ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: In their next match Iceland are planning to field the stronger partnership of Einarsson and Frisby. Should be good viewing.|pg||
nt|shevek: 1NT was 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: almost what he has :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|athene: haha|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many pairs now use transfer in response to a natural 1@C opening.|pg||
nt|athene: this should be fine|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H must find @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't really lose more than two spades and a club, can he?|pg||
nt|talion: Pass by salomaa promises 0-8 points. viitasalo & salomaa opens on every 9+hcp hands in first or second position. even with xxxx,QJx,QJx,QJx they open 1@s i think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This 4 @H-bid can be a help for N/S|pg||
nt|jakow:  Not  inviting, but some valuse|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: 1 NT is alerted. Does this means a spade suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 1NT strong or 3c @H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 6 @C dbl par here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@C Gazzilli|pg||

nt|shevek: convention cards:  http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.2354|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: From what I can see from the reult table Iceland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway can all be champions depending on the results in this last round.|pg||
nt|shevek: 1. 170 Iceland; 2. 167 Sweden; 3. 161 Norway|pg||
nt|shevek: yes Denmark is 4th with 159|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: or Häxan as we say in Sweden|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|m_niemi: looks like -1|pg||
nt|psyck: E has a balanced hand though. not unbal...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As N I could have bid 4@d instead of 4@h|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@d was GF|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzds: 1NT = FG|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 2@C = 12-15 HCP|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Despite of the bad trump distribution I think this contract may be won, but that is not an easy task|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: 1. Interview Fulvio Fantoni http://www.confsudbridge.org/hitsII/fantoni001i.aspx: If you had to choose a convention, which one would you pick?|pg||
nt|milton_se: 1@S = balanced if I have it right - then the trumps will be solved|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: 2. Fantoni: Gazzilli... is a convention that I think should be used by all who play natural bridge|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and should|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 4 of @H maybe suit-preference?|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: with a singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now S can't judge to bid 5 H|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: in that case they might find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: rest i cant see|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: long way to go for 4th spades|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Heart from hand is best!|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I think this will be too difficult without seeing all the four hands.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: Yes, trump lead seems to be the least dangerous, from North's point of view.|pg||
nt|granguru: this is the time when one is greatful for an opponent overcall |pg||
nt|iceak:  double from south as expected|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: This will be very interesting. I think 2 hearts may be made.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|granguru: and you dont fall in a 5-0 trump distribution...|pg||
nt|milton_se: overly disciplined to describe that as 12-15?|pg||
nt|jbgood: W is asking - and E telling him what we can already see|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: unsure exactly what he has been able to show though|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Solid hearts?|pg||
nt|jbgood: i wonder if he can ask for the spade jack:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You still want to be in it opposite  xxx|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but only a 3-card @s suppport can be good enough|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Flat board in the women's match, in 6@H and 6@S|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure, and he will know E's distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: Now I see what they've written :) 3NT showed his exact distribution|pg||
pc|dA|nt|leanderiii: 1NT is my choice.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  good morning|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is not as if it will serve any direct purpose, but the other leads might well cost a trick.|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Since W is the captain, the key issue is E showing solid hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 2@S was 6 @H, 3@C showed 331 any way in the side-suits, and 3NT singleton club|pg||

nt|milton_se: the two jacks are crucial to make this a good grand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psyck: well, the vul was in his favor here :)|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A better line would have been to take ace, king of diamonds before playing a club.|pg||
nt|granguru: this is a demonstration that sometimes a 5-0 is worst than a 4-1 ..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also how to defend. A @d ruff, @h back another @d ruff and @cK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Not @SJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: the bidding tray is getting full :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: IT is still 68% without it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: good enough for a grand slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 7@H that is|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|m_niemi: if W covers @sQ E must have @hQ|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so declarer will top the trumps then|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Now the contract is down when S play another diamond|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|milton_se: low spade against the ten seems fairly safe|pg||
nt|iceak:  If Bjarni Einarsson vins this - he will say: "never double "the maestro"|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|granguru: Charles Goren recommends not to make an informative at a low lwvel double being void|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If they have set hearts (have they?) it can't be difficult for Grøtheim to locate the cards he needs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|granguru: because partner coud pass with the suit and you cant lead trumps|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: If North can get four heart trick the contract will be down|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: I think 4@C set @H as trumps|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, then he just needs @HQ from here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and is now asking for it|pg||

pc|c4|nt|arvidsson: with void in spades.. there is usally a good idea not to encourage partner to much.. but this deal was the exception|pg||

mb|p|nt|m_niemi: declarer was unlucky to go down that one|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Kind of the Great Dealer to favour us with this little beauty. Still, I suppose something interesting might- just possibly - happen.|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  this opening will test North's understanding of fav. preempts|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  still an unlucky trump break|pg||
nt|arvidsson: an agressive opening bid, makes it hard for EW to bid spades|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  the question is for N how to find out if 6@H is any good|pg||
nt|arvidsson: true, but even with running 7 hearts, he can only count 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, definitely if N shows his void|pg||

mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|brolucius: Standard to respond nowadays, when NV and holding an ace. Here North has a jack to spare.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Nothing nice about it. It means we will have to watch a 1NT contract.|pg||
nt|haans: hard to do good in defense|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's true.|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt contracts are the chamber music of bridge!  "will he unblock that 6 - will he read his partner's subtle suit-preference signal?"|pg||
nt|pelu: would u all X in N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: my kind of bidding :)|pg||
nt|athene: they are marvellous|pg||

pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  What does East expect by partner - having a stron NT himself|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: west decides that a spade lead isn't giving declarer anything that is not his for the taking anyway|pg||
nt|milton_se: using all the brakes|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 1 @H = 20+ HCP, 1 @S = very weak|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: must leave that queen alone|pg||

nt|milton_se: 1@S = bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@S = weak 3@H = still weak|pg||

nt|granguru: right they are|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: do we know if 1@S shows 3 spades, or any weak notrump?|pg||

nt|athene: ok|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzds: 2 @C showed 6+ @D, 3 @S natural|pg||
nt|arvidsson: would all reopen by E?|pg||
nt|athene: if wrang has no idea what 6@C shows, he was not exactly holding back any to bid a grand, was he?|pg||
nt|athene: i mean, yes, he has the @DK that he might not have|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: he said "hopefully he has a good hand"|pg||
nt|athene: but you don't bid grands, usually, without a bit more certainty|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I'm betting down|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: his partner practically bid slam on his own hand, and he has the K109x in support|pg||
nt|athene: well, 4@D maybe shows some diamond support - and north might have thought it showed some values|pg||
nt|mmmakela: might just take club finesse in yte end|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead was normal on the auction so i don't think he can draw any inferences|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: no way you can have 3NT on, and it's rarely a good idea to bid 2NT on a weak misfit to run away from a suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite so.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North quite rightly expects more from partner.|pg||
nt|haans: best is no double|pg||
nt|athene: north quite reasonably thinks 2nt is invitational, and he has a complete maximum for a passed hand, so he bids game|pg||
nt|iceak:  Denmark could loose on this one|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: for example that east has strength in all the other suits so just wants to be safe|pg||
pc|h9|nt|milton_se: 4@S can be made, but will Johan choose the working line?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  opposite weak NT probably pass and hope opps miss something|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  then dbl is fine|pg||
nt|leanderiii: spec suggest D from Jörgensen, what do you think?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but x might be artificial, strange not to bid 3@C by W otherwise (might have 9 clubs) or should one stick to the 8 card fit one is sure off?|pg||

nt|milton_se: depends on the definition of normal :)|pg||
nt|athene: with the hearts 3-3|pg||
nt|athene: you might scramble enough tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: interesting hand...would u find a black contract game with your partner?|pg||
nt|athene: very big score for sweden, with a certain amount of luck|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe @d4 instead of the 2 would have been better?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jbgood: no ladies managed to bid 7 - 3 in 6 and 1 in 4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this can be expensive|pg||
mb|d|nt|milton_se: that trump shift made it easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: S endplayed himself by discarding the last spade|pg||
nt|granguru: Now easy 3NT by EW|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @hK for press and @c3-3|pg||
nt|shevek: 1NT here 15-17|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: quite true :)|pg||
nt|haans: double does not promise clubs|pg||
nt|milton_se: this is a problem when 1@C just shows 2+ cards|pg||
nt|haans: diamonds :)|pg||
nt|haans: 5@S now??|pg||
nt|milton_se: would prefer 6|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was certainly not the right move, as we said at the time. No reason to fear 2@D when you are adding those high cards to the pot.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so very lucky....|pg||
nt|milton_se: may be hard to convince Sylvan that 4@S is maximum|pg||
nt|shevek: Graversen is checking the cards on the back, he had a similar hand 2 boards ago|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Sylvan haas no other bid than 3 @H , has he?|pg||
nt|shevek: not sure about East's dbl....|pg||
mb|6D|nt|vugraphzds: else he could have exited with it upon winning the @D ace, while diamonds were still blocked|pg||
nt|iceak:  depends on bidding|pg||
nt|shevek: surprise, surprise?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6@H?|pg||
nt|athene: wow board 19, west in the other room did exactly what south did here - bid 2nt with a weak hand 4441 singleton in his partner's suit|pg||
nt|athene: and lost 9 imps for it|pg||
nt|brolucius: A lesson for us all (and for them).|pg||
nt|milton_se: as suspected|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: This is nonsense.|pg||
nt|shevek: if dbl by East was penalty, west has a point|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: But North still has 15-17. |pg||
nt|shevek: if dbl is, say 16+|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: yes, double was strong|pg||
nt|shevek: then north psyched|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: And how can he know he has not two heart losers?|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Not the right vulnerability for a psyche?|pg||
nt|shevek: he knows either north or east doesn't tell the truth|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I mean E is fairly close to the truth. |pg||
nt|milton_se: and rule  1: trust pard|pg||
nt|shevek: I would pass over 1NT with easts hand and score a plus|pg||
nt|milton_se: E is far from the truth I'd say|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Personally I would not dream of bidding 6 @D|pg||
nt|shevek: exactely, pd promised 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: 6@D might be more descriptive - what can South have less than KQ at least?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: now he does not like 5@S|pg||
nt|iceak:  3@h?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on W looks best|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: 1@H really alerted?|pg||
nt|milton_se: RD endplayed himself|pg||
nt|shevek: well it did come as a surprise to everyone|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Let him play it himself. Thats the spirit.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: maybe they swapped the 1@H and 1@S responses to 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: to 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: in that case, east forgot :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H must show support|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: Yes it was alerted. Dont know why|pg||
nt|brolucius: The deal will play well because of the club fit, which no-one will know about.|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so if 1@H and 3@H were natural, then 3nt must be some sort of "serious 3nt" i.e. showing a good hand for slam|pg||
nt|haans: and good hearts to ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: In which case 4@C totally obvious, but East is thinking.|pg||
nt|athene: there are many hidden possibilities - for example, 3@S might have been non-serious and 3NT is a spade cue with a serious hand|pg||
nt|haans: bidding slam either very good or beginners luck|pg||
nt|brolucius: The slowness of the auction must be a bit worrying for Iceland supporters.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this 3nt can not have a @H lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|milton_se: ooops|pg||
nt|haans: pass = VOID in spades |pg||
nt|jaapfr: but still can|pg||
nt|milton_se: !A and making|pg||
nt|milton_se: @HA|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Not a lucky choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: E double was explained as takeout, usually of spades|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|haans: pass stronger that double|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but in my view he will go down still|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: he he|pg||
nt|milton_se: if...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: 4@S probably key-card ask. Yes, Exclusion RKCB with a spade void.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1 step is 1 or 4 controls.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it was just showing the void, allowing west to ask for keycards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not including the @SA because it is opposite the disclosed void.|pg||
nt|athene: you can run the @HJ and when that works it tells you where the @DQ is as well|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: 0-3|pg||
nt|haans: 5!Q for @HQ|pg||
nt|cenglund: Seems unbeatable as the cards lie|pg||
nt|m_niemi: with lots of lower honors E passes 3NT|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now 4@h is clear choice|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now a very fast way to 620|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|milton_se: 1100 is still cheap|pg||
nt|haans: jump to 5M = leave them alone|pg||
nt|milton_se: yeah, should go down anyhow|pg||
nt|milton_se: "t/o usually of spades" - men det borde kanske vara lite kort också :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|milton_se: sorry private|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: steady bidding I say|pg||
nt|athene: west must know 7@H can't be good - @S- @HKQxx @DAKxxx @CAxxx would have bid more than 3@H, surely|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: 3@H to weak for Grand|pg||
nt|athene: and even if east has all that, the grand is still not laydown|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was not a good hand for keycard-asking because East also needed to know about fillers in the minors, as well as the trump ace.|pg||
nt|athene: north gets sneaky on lead|pg||
nt|athene: if the contract depended on a diamond finesse, north wants to talk declarer out of it right away|pg||
nt|brolucius: His heart will be pounding now.|pg||
nt|shevek: 4@s goes down too, so no big damage here|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|milton_se: but direct 6@S would probably have bought it|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes, of course, declarer has to bring in the suit for no losers with @DQx in hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: and you look a bit silly|pg||
nt|m_niemi: should have played @c first|pg||
nt|cenglund: careless play|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now cannot ruff @c to dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: count his tricks: 3@h + 4@S + 3 top = 10|pg||
nt|m_niemi: yes, always making|pg||
nt|cenglund: I wonder how he is going to make 4H|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbennet: ergo.. P har inte en jämn stark hand. så vad har han då??|pg||

nt|petka: ser ut som om det var 2 transfers, sedan 3R kanske exakt 54, sedan 3N 1-3 i hårda färger|pg||
nt|jbennet: ja 6 ruter råkar stå , men det är av akademiskt intresse antagligen|pg||
nt|monsted: ja enig|pg||
nt|monsted: han passer 3NT efter en lille pause mere !|pg||
nt|petka: troligtvis så är denna sekvens begränsad till 8-12 eller liknande|pg||

pc|s3|nt|jr7: så er der formentlig kun 9 stik|pg||
nt|monsted: ah - men hvad om spilfører tager lavt ?|pg||
nt|petka: bra analys johan. Man har inte tid om inte hjärtern sitter 3-3 eller ess singel eller ess andra framför damen|pg||
nt|jr7: Gælder det også med @SBonde ud?|pg||
nt|jbennet: nej men spel kan ducka spader (och det kostar inget)|pg||

nt|vugraphzdr: Förlåt, 7+ en väldigt rimlig överenskommelse eftersom det är |pg||
nt|monsted: han vinder stadig med ruder til bordet, hjerter til damen og klør|pg||

pc|c7|nt|petka: Får lite kommentarer från åskådare om att gå på klövern. Jo, men om man spelar på klöver 3-3 så är det väl sämre än at spela på hjärter 3-3 eller Ax framför damen eller ess singel? ...|pg||
nt|petka: Klöver har förstås tilläggschansen Hx hos öst... Vad är bäst?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|monsted: wd|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jbennet: om han har det minsta hum om oddsen. (kl 3-3 betydligt större chans än hj Ax|pg||
nt|vugraphzdr: Han hade tydligen visat 8-9 zz och sin exakta fördelning|pg||
nt|monsted: eller hvad nu snedigt tilspil af Vest|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|jbennet: exakt AX rätt ca 8% 3-3 36%|pg||

nt|monsted: men kan vel ikke klare 2 hjertertabere i 4NT ?|pg||
nt|petka: en liten detalj i sammahanget är att fienden inte får ha 4-4 spader då :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdr: zz är för övrigt en slags honnörspoäng där A=3, K=2 och Q=1|pg||

mb|1N|nt|cenglund: Another tough game in favour of the declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|m_niemi: 4@s will probably make|pg||
nt|m_niemi: not against us :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: 12 tricks w a @S + @D squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: a finesse for a king through the opening bidder is pretty good when you are only missing 16 hcp|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt they will diagnose it is that good, though|pg||
nt|athene: which will be fortunate for them :)|pg||

nt|shevek: true true, 4@s would've made|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|milton_se: agree|pg||
nt|psyck: lol true :)|pg||
nt|jakow:  S+C if they play the original Magic defence|pg||
nt|arvidsson: will E just leap to 4@S ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The better the player, the earlier he makes his plan. Really good players sometimes make a plan before they play the first card from dummy.|pg||
nt|athene: they will wander into 4@S here and lose two hearts and a diamond, i suppose|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h = @s+ m 55+|pg||
nt|m_niemi: i guess|pg||
nt|m_niemi: that's the Finnish style|pg||
nt|athene: or 2@H perhaps to show the good raise, if they play 2@D as a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|shevek: Since 1973 the NBU trophy has been won 9 times by Sweden, 5 by Denmark and 4 by Norway|pg||
mb|2H|nt|milton_se: but South can set it by ducking two @Hs|pg||

nt|m_niemi: no, not mine:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: The most common one also, but this one is hard.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and a favorable @SK|pg||
nt|jbgood: reliable sources claim that Norway is in 3@s doubled on   5....|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: Michael Rosenberg said in most slam auctions you should be trying to play the hand through before you actually finish bidding it|pg||
nt|haans: player playing relays can claim before 1st card|pg||
nt|brolucius: Difficult at our level, Bill, because we rarely have the faintest idea what will appear in the dummy.|pg||
nt|athene: true - of course neither did rosenberg, when he was playing with zia|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hah!|pg||
nt|athene: "partner has splintered - well that could be three small of course"|pg||
nt|haans: vulnerable game|pg||
nt|jakow:  Yes U r right. Their card sas Weak or strong lover minor'|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: a bit agressive I think|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S looks normal to me - he has six spades and a 16 count|pg||
nt|haans: right right 6 spades|pg||
nt|cenglund: Not very good judgement with all these scattered values|pg||
nt|arvidsson: he made the reasonble choice, but changed his mind |pg||
nt|athene: south likes his hand more after the double of 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: it means north is more likely to have fitting honours|pg||
nt|milton_se: and now it looks like Iceland|pg||

nt|talion: 1NT is 16-18 in third & fourth position|pg||
nt|m_niemi: note that E has limited his hand to 0-8 hcp, so he cant have game values, so EW dont play 2 way Stay in this position|pg||
nt|cenglund: There is no way going down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: close to 6@s:)|pg||

nt|m_niemi: this deal should be easy|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@h NS 11 tricks|pg||
nt|cenglund: Not so spectacular|pg||
nt|jakow:  I wonder was this wk or strong? Vulnerable vs not|pg||
nt|pelu: but from -100/300 to +500|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: Squeeze? Sylvan happily asked :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|granguru: Hi David |pg||
nt|dburn: and apologies for not being able to say that in either Icelandic or Danish|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 !|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The defence was less than perfect|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice understatement|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: balance hand go weaker and weaker|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  transfer from N, accepted by E?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H -> 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a good agreement here is to play 3NT as 4@H-bid with defense (what N has)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Try  God dag|pg||
nt|granguru: How do you say hello in those languages?|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 1 @S, natural, but 9-14 HCP|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|milton_se: prolly looked VERY innocent :)|pg||
nt|granguru: and Icelandic?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk5: Don't know|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@C is 2+ clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 2@C = Majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 2@d no major|pg||
nt|athene: north not too happy with this|pg||
nt|haans: nest is pass now|pg||
nt|haans: best|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has to guess whether to show the hearts, where there might be a fit, or to pass 1NT, Unlucky.|pg||
nt|haans: pass before they double|pg||
nt|athene: if you play 1nt as forcing or semi-forcing, so it has quite a high upper range, you are more stuck in this sort of situation that normally|pg||
nt|athene: because you can't run to 3 of your long suit without implying better values|pg||
nt|brolucius: I remember Forrester berating his partner for not passing 1NT with some 5-4-2-2 shape. The first time I passed 1NT on such a shape (5-4 in the majors, as here) we missed a heart ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: game. Partner had five hearts. |pg||
mb|2S|nt|Gerben42:  slam is not bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: did Forrester's partner have both majors?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Blame that one on Forrester, I told my partner.|pg||
nt|haans: slow pass = telling|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, I don't think F's partner did have both majors.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H can be made|pg||
nt|jaapfr: here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I don't speak 120 languages|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: Finally you are also human Roland!|pg||
nt|granguru: halló is a way|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4@S seems makeable |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: who has the @DQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is your screen dirty, Hans?|pg||
nt|haans: Jörgensen playing hearts??|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 12 tricks if guess @H|pg||
nt|granguru: hae with vowels together is another|pg||
nt|dburn: who's winning this event?|pg||
nt|iceak:  hallÃ³ is rht|pg||
nt|iceak:  right|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Iceland maybe|pg||

nt|Walddk5: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=474&csm=Rank&nt=3&nb=1&csh=0000000000111|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: E alerted 2 @S, saying 4@S and exactly 11 HCP|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@S can be made|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: declarer can be held to two trumps, @SAK and one club, i think, on best defence|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1-1 break is 52% a priori - 48% for 2-0|pg||
nt|dburn: not surprised they're winning, if they bid as precisely as that|pg||
nt|shevek: north didn't trust pd to play in 1NT|pg||
nt|shevek: or had a club in spades?|pg||
nt|shevek: now he has to work hard....|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: easy make (2 spades + 1 clubs) :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: unless he plays West for AQ in spades|pg||
nt|haans: I did see E problem|pg||
nt|athene: the main issue for east is whether to stick the @HQ through rather than playing the third diamond|pg||
nt|athene: assuming west continues diamonds here of course which is not obvious|pg||
nt|athene: this is another situation where count signals are just more use than attitude - west wants to know if a diamond will just ruffing finesse his partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: No need for E to signal attitude, because it was obvious he held the ace when the king won. But some would signal count, others SP. perhaps.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Only one thing is certain, the Faroe Islands will not win it|pg||
nt|jbgood: but then the suit has to come into the picture - too difficult here|pg||
nt|cenglund:  This contract should be OK as well|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - a @d lead doesnt hurt Tundal|pg||
nt|milton_se: esp after this lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not @d2 for me. if a @d =@d8|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Yes|pg||
nt|milton_se: in any case a doubtful decision|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: second round show @SJ|pg||
nt|psyck: as W may have bid on 2@h with unbal hand, wonder if pass shows 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|m_niemi: great bid by Nyberg|pg||
nt|pelu: wow - 9 toptrick - wd|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, even w a trump lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: i am happy when my partner says "we signal attitude, but count if that looks right" because count is ALWAYS right :)|pg||
nt|leanderiii: but you miss 2 aces :)|pg||
nt|granguru: 3@C should -1|pg||
nt|granguru: or -2|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess that with four spades and a "real" opening West would bid 2@s at his second turn (1@h showed spades)|pg||
nt|iceak:  8 or perhaps 7 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|milton_se: sorry makeable even then|pg||
nt|iceak:  Iceland played 4@s in no 4 and made 10 imps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: tricks are there but no entries|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like -1 in 4@h  with 4-1 in @c, but can you make 4@s?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|haans: Wrang did open thus game|pg||
nt|m_niemi: anyone knows the bidding?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nice examole with 18 hcp and 9 trumps 4@H C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: o=p|pg||
nt|granguru: E leads shows his perception that his side has the balance of the hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzds: 1@s 4@h 2@c GF 2@h= 2-3 @S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h=relay or asking bid or nat|pg||
nt|m_niemi: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: South has shown 3424|pg||
nt|talion: there might be some suspense in heart suit if NS reach 5@h and salomaa takes AK of spades....|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: Don't know|pg||
nt|m_niemi: the percentage play is still @hA, K and then 100 % finess|pg||
nt|cenglund: 5H is Ok, because the cards are lying in favour of the declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: Tundal had 6@h at the table but never relased it|pg||
nt|m_niemi: fast claim again|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|brolucius: An old guy at our club would always indicate a suit preference signal by thumbing the card into the baize.|pg||
nt|granguru: congrats to Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I am not sure I want Iceland to win. I mean, harassing innocent people with ash every spring. Only consolation is that they now found a volcano with a name most people can ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: pronounce|pg||
nt|granguru: who now leads the match|pg||
nt|shevek: convention cards and photos at:  http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.2354|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|athene: west was worried that if declarer was void in diamonds a diamond lead would pick up his partner's ace AND allow the spade ruff (or ruffs)|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the four corners of the card were pointing upwards, his partner would take the view that it could well be suit preference.|pg||
nt|athene: he can see declarer has no fast entry back to hand i guess so it would only be one ruff but even that might be too many|pg||
nt|m_niemi: both hands will lead spades i guess, so this time you can't win by bidding a slam|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3NT = rkc in @h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 4@s 2+Q|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: @sK is not impossible on the bidding. anyone else?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cenglund: Viitaslo is on lead, so why the double?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S plays @d, N hearts|pg||
nt|cenglund: I suppose heart is the agreed trump suit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S would XX with @sA|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so his bid denies @sA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cenglund: The double does mainly help the offensive side|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|iceak:  8 tricks almost sure|pg||
nt|dburn: not impossible that this will be passed out at the other table, even in these days|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why will 4@h go down? only one entry to dummy and @c are blocked|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|m_niemi: S may think that N has all the suits controlled|pg||
nt|milton_se: well, East has often a @S suit |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|m_niemi: and bid a slam|pg||
nt|cenglund: Salomaa would not have problem with lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Excuse me - but did anybody get the meaning with Wests double of 4 @S???|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S has shown all of his values, so he should pass now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S or @S or @S>?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|cenglund: No, at least I can't understand the meaning|pg||
nt|talion: three rounds of spades doesnt leave much choice how to play hearts in heart contract|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  What does West bid, when he has @S-values?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  claim|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: :) people often find creative ways to give signals in defence|pg||
nt|jbgood: leads are also among those things that people play the way they like it - some like the 8 - some like the 2, others like the 4 (and they are all happy)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so E sholud shift after 2@s's|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Yes, asking 'What are trumps?' let's partner know that you can ruff something.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|athene: one american pro was playing with a client in a national and he had to lead from 1NT 3NT with nothing so he chose @H87|pg||
nt|ritong: and prepare his @h7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now making even 11|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|shevek: we did see a couple of bad decisions in the last couple of boards (by both sides)|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Not perfect defense, but one down all the same. Diamond ruff was available.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d5|nt|athene: dummy hits with @HKJ and declarer with @Hxxx asks his partner "what leads does he make?"|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: "good ones" his partner said|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But what were North and South thinking about - when Nort has denied @S-control?|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: declarer still has a guess|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Down one if heart ruff spade to king and heart|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|sJ|pc|d3|pg||

nt|jbennet: men antag nu att väst tillämpat devisen "bjud mens man kan"'|pg||
nt|vugraphzdr: Precis, alltså var det väl inget fel i att välja just esset? På sådana här budgivningar brukar det ju till och med vara rekommenderat|pg||
nt|jbennet: han våldförde sig på basic strategy.'|pg||
nt|monsted: ja han var jo i første hånd :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: han hade chanse att på 3 kl gå in med 3 ruter.|pg||
nt|monsted: ja men det var dog farligt med evt. ruderåbning i Nord|pg||
nt|jbennet: han hade ju passat i given (vilket inte ska ha nån betydelse)|pg||
nt|petka: jag tycker att det var ett svårt läge för öst. Handen på hjärtat. med en passad partner och en känd stickkälla i klöver på bordet, nog vill man gå till attack i högfärg?|pg||
nt|jbennet: 1 ruter var väl slaskruter??|pg||
nt|monsted: Nord kunne vel have naturlig ruderåbn ?|pg||
nt|jbennet: ja han kunde det men det spelar ingen som helst roll.|pg||
nt|jbennet: han var favorit att ha 11-13 balabns väl?|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: easy 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you just bid 4@H here|pg||
nt|athene: or will be look for 3nt? that is rarely right but it might be better sometimes when you can use the clubs as a trick source and partner's hearts are not very good|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  if it's weak only W may pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: but he may fear missing a good 4 @S|pg||
nt|granguru: The play of the @HK by E didnt  make necessary to ruff a second @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1nt possible by north now; perhaps a little thin|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 3@C invitational with 3 or 4 @S|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|athene: your spot cards in the minors leave something to be desired|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT shows a stopper in the opener's suit - not in responders, since you expect the doubler to cover any unbid suit.|pg||
nt|athene: yes Jx is a very respectable heart holding after partner doubled 1@C for takeout|pg||
nt|athene: you don't expect opps to be running hearts - and indeed they aren't :)|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2@H by West?|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: they play hi/low Mich|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@c = relay|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: hard to undertsnad the bidding but effective|pg||
nt|m_niemi: nice bid by W|pg||
nt|jaapfr: bestb  to end in 4@D C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now 3@H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if partner's suit is @S, opps have all top @H and both minor suit Aces ... not clear it is us who is missing|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H must show @D support|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if N plays a small @s to ruff and overruff after @dA....|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Seemingly obvious double for East.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe double would be support|pg||
nt|athene: (three hearts)|pg||
nt|athene: so he just has to pass and hope that if 1nt is going a lot down his partner will find a double|pg||
nt|m_niemi: excactly 8 tricks is not likely so bid game or pass|pg||
nt|pelu: and??|pg||
nt|cenglund: Koistinen's 5S bid after parner's Michael's cue was not bold, it was bad judgement|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, non intermediate hands|pg||
nt|m_niemi: that hand is medium so to good to low, and too weak to high|pg||
nt|milton_se: @H lead (or A@C and @H) needed to set 5@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  West is doing a good job hiding that he has the best hand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: he didn't look all that happy when he passed 2 @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  slam was missed in the other room|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but on this board he does not want NS to bid more since a club or @S contract works out good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: On @sK S is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@d = 12+|pg||
nt|shevek: since they open with 10+|pg||
nt|milton_se: difficult to sneak out to 3@C now|pg||
nt|shevek: 2NT invit I guess|pg||
mb|3C|nt|haans: many see double as responsive double|pg||
nt|brolucius: A responsive double is when your partner has doubled.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@D cold with 3 losers and no dummy entry?|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Already too high|pg||
nt|granguru: well it was nice to meet you all...my flight to Central America (CAC) is now boarding...see you later. Bye |pg||
nt|vugraphzds: N's double was explained as "takeout-ish"|pg||
nt|iceak:  thks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting to see if E opens 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: with 4-5 in the reds it would be very popular but less with 5-4|pg||
nt|athene: but still some would open 1nt yes|pg||
nt|athene: gets the overall hand across ok and Qx of spades might be good to be led up to|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: 10 easy tricks now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Norway bid the slam in board 8|pg||
nt|pelu: u sh - as most topplayers in Denmark - drop the low/Weak Machael - the weak type is better help for opponemts|pg||
nt|psyck: this time it is a good sac|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S doesn't like this:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  well he will be happy after the board|pg||
nt|milton_se: ... or South ruffs @SK|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: and 3@C was to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: one up for Sweden|pg||
nt|milton_se: and even a @H must be followed by a trump|pg||

nt|mmmakela: best contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Points to Sylvan|pg||
nt|haans: i know that many dont|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't look at first as though there was any rush to take that club finesse|pg||
nt|m_niemi: minimum 4333 is not nice now|pg||
nt|milton_se: nicely undertaken|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Gerben42:  it is hard to decide what N's dbl should be - T/O of @D is nice but unlikely as there is a 6-card major out there|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I'm for @C+M or strong...|pg||
nt|arvidsson: he did start with pass|pg||
pc|d7|nt|m_niemi: no double, no trouble|pg||
nt|dburn: that was probably not what North intended - rather, it was "lead a club-ish"|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Then we have a minor misunderstanding, since the double surely was intended as showing clubs.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzds: W was a bit worried his hand was too bad - little does he know his partner has an absolute max|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|m_niemi: goes down as E will get his ruff|pg||
nt|shevek: Norway and Sweden are tied for 2nd now with 166, Iceland leading on 170|pg||
nt|milton_se: but won't make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: S has shown 2@S and usually 4 or 5@C on his bidding|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jaapfr: @C@C@H@D still down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S lead woulld be veyyyyy helpful|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: if east had @CQ109 then you would have to finesse immediately to keep the suit unblocked to run five tricks, but that isn't happening|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|m_niemi: claim|pg||
nt|mmmakela: too bad? seems very good to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 1@H was 8+ HCP and 4+ @H :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|m_niemi: some trump control problems too|pg||
nt|psyck: S does not have entry to play 3 rounds of trumps, so 4@s would have made i guess|pg||
nt|psyck: so he can afford a couple down undoubled here|pg||
nt|m_niemi: -11 is only -550 so better than -620:)|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|m_niemi: W doesn't know that S has only 4 trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: 9 for DEN bid and made 4@S with @sQ singleton and the @D-suit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: E should have clear picture of the shapes|pg||
nt|arvidsson: so what do you mean with strong ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  in unpassed hand|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|milton_se: if Iceland's trouble w Finland continues, Norway may go to top|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jaapfr: @H for -2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry-1|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Graversen led one eventually - as he would have done without the double, of course|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|athene: not sure that was such a good idea|pg||

nt|ralfwil: in that case there is a throw in on S - or?|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: 5@C could politely be described as 'awful'...|pg||
nt|athene: you need a LOT of shape and playing strength to overcall directly at the 5-level|pg||
nt|athene: more than 6421 10 count|pg||
nt|athene: north has the world and 5@C is still down|pg||
nt|cenglund: Awkard hand to intervene|pg||
nt|iceak:  You can make 6@s by seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|dburn: can you? crikey|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, I can see all the cards, and I'm not sure I could make more than four|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|pbmarstr: Thanks to the singleton club in W you could make six|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: if 5@C is a make p will bid 6|pg||
nt|brolucius: So is 6@C, if North takes that view.|pg||
nt|cenglund: awkward|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Can North now stay out of game? Should be difficult, IF Souths Double is classic|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if you reopen so often, i pass 2@D more often :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: this can be bloody |pg||
mb|3S!|nt|milton_se: Norway made 3NT on board 5 in OR after a spade lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: west should probably put a red card on this|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks life a nice invitation to get 500|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  bidding was reasonable though... huge swing on NT range possible|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but luckily N has only one entry|pg||
nt|arvidsson: he might get one in clubs or spades|pg||
nt|arvidsson: if A and @D 9 this will be very interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: but he doesn't know it, and he is very reluctant to give up his only sure entry, thinking for quite some time now|pg||
nt|arvidsson: true but if ducking declarer might continue @H so he can not be sure to maintain his entry|pg||
nt|cenglund:  This is the best spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 3@C showed 5@H and any 4c minor|pg||
nt|shevek: @@@c opening can be weak @d, or some strong bal hands, or acol 2 in clubs|pg||
nt|shevek: 2|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: nOT VERY CONVENIENT WHEN YOU HAVE THE STRONG HAND.|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s shows the strong club hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: yes, 3@D was to play if he had the weak hand, 3@S is spades and clubs|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Sorry for the big letters|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|brolucius: South should play the 7.|pg||
nt|haans: doubles not fashion any more|pg||
nt|m_niemi: i think EW doesn't use any adjustments when counting their points|pg||
nt|psyck: ya well, one rarely knows how well the vaules are working when they open, so ok i guess|pg||
nt|dburn: so you could, indeed|pg||
nt|iceak:  With a @c lead finesse spade - play @h to Ace and @hJ- throving club - W has no club|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@d is multi - and 3@c is an artificial answer...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Luckily enough it wasn't clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: will probably loose 3 tricks in @d-contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y totally different bidding|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good afternoon to Sabine Auken|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe 3@s shows strong @cs + @s|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|athene: as it turns out he is gaining so much the double would not be that much extra|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, the 3. Now West KNOWS that his partner has a singleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Unless they are playing reverse count.|pg||
nt|athene: i assumed reverse|pg||
nt|athene: on board 17 west played the @S7 from @S97 in a "give count" situation|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might not hold a trump anyway.|pg||
nt|haans: most in scandinavia play reverse (we call in Schneider)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer needs to know the opponents' methods in order to prepare his own false card.|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead - and have a nice trip!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @dA, @hJ and claim|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: hi|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, declarer may now not make more than three|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Yes, I think you are right, and they will find the slam now|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|m_niemi: -2 with correct defense|pg||
nt|cenglund: -500 to the Finns|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If West could have bid 2 @S directly, the Double would have been difficult|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To the finns - ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|shevek: yes, just read you Daniel|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|jbgood: the opener showed 5 cards of a major, guess 3 @c showed hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and it spoils the effect somewhat if you ask what their carding is THEN play your spot card :)|pg||
nt|dburn: if West ruffs and returns a diamond...|pg||
nt|iceak:  Careless in to easy contract|pg||
nt|dburn: ...which is what East presumably asked him to do...|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Even 6 @S is on.|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: S not content with small slam|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|athene: you want to have it all prepared beforehand :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Works against some...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and is the answer on 2nt always 3@c? otherwise lucky too|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: let us say unhappy S again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now declarer must be careful for @C10|pg||
nt|shevek: well, if they bid the grand that will make|pg||
mb|6C|nt|arvidsson: if S does not continue with @S Q declarer have atleast 5 tricks|pg||
nt|leanderiii: Well done!|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nice shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: @SK Lavinthal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D 8 had gaine 300 here!!!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  gained|pg||
nt|cenglund: Yes, +500 to the Norwegians|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N should know where the high cards lie|pg||
nt|cenglund: Now the prospects for a narrow escape have improved|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it wasn't that easy - he couldn't see all the cards|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|mmmakela: weird|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think south can have shown 55 majors by this sequence, or north would surely have gone for hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: S showed 5+@S 4+@H|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they play smolen here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: problems after a @c lead|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@C was normal stayman and then 3@H showed 5 spades and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: maybe unlucky he didn't show it the other way around :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: club lead not auto|pg||
nt|shevek: but I wouldn't be impressed :)|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: They bid the slam without making one natural bid....|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: but E will duck this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: cannot lose with that|pg||
nt|milton_se: board 6 gave the expected 10 imps but in a shaky 5@C|pg||
nt|milton_se: not the kind of contract you long for :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: and once againg be incontrol|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to devise methods to show 55 majors if you are prepared to go past 3nt of course|pg||
nt|milton_se: 3@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|m_niemi: @hJ is a surprise|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Well, it was alerted|pg||
nt|milton_se: :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|m_niemi: now @d's|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not play "normal" - @S Ace and a @S?|pg||
nt|cenglund: That would have guaranteed 1 down, because S would be endpalyed|pg||
nt|dburn: and he only had nine sure tricks - it wasn't ridiculous to duck that club|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: but a 2nt opener might be 22 majors so maybe NS are not|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But now @D and a @D|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S showed his even length in @d so declarer will get only one ruff anyway|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: so with 55 majors you just play smolen and hope to guess right :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: playing @SA then @SK was the suit-prefence i think|pg||
pc|c6|nt|m_niemi: so save @s10 if it takes a trick in the end|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@S and no X would solve all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: don´t agree Markku, Declarer must have a solid @d so how can I find to defeat|pg||
nt|athene: unfortunate for the defence - west had good enough clubs to make a club lead right but not good enough clubs to double 3@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry not if 3@c showed @h:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  Now the book is "open" - 500|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but still is short on tricks|pg||
mc|13|nt|athene: *suit-preference|pg||
nt|cenglund: No, S can be still endplayed|pg||

nt|brolucius: So, 300 down against plus 300 for defending. A fair measure of the 5@C overcall on such a modest suit.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  back to slams|pg||
nt|arvidsson: a very nice board indeed. good declaring and good defence|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A missed chance for Iceland|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess it wasn't so easy for West to play a diamond either, though he might have seen the danger|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: apparently 3@S by north over 3@H would have shown 3-c @H, but he forgot it :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: a kib pointed out that 4! was playable as the cards lie|pg||
nt|jbgood: @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 3@C was 5@H and any 4c minor, 5-10 HCP, 3@D would be 5@S and any 4c minor|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another 3nt on NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: now they picked up their cards, Graversen isn't thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  7@S on finesse so not really good|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: No DD play on that 6NT board in OR|pg||
nt|athene: ah, right, just in case responder had 55|pg||
nt|athene: that would wrongside of course but still gets you to the 8-card major fits all the time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|m_niemi: easy 12 tricks|pg||
nt|cenglund: But not so easy reach|pg||
nt|psyck: the perfect maximum for the 1NT that E wants with pd...|pg||
nt|jcmax: A potential slam deal here, but it's not very likely to be bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: Thank you, Daniel|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: looks like transfer|pg||
nt|haans: usually transfer to nt|pg||
nt|milton_se: it does - balanced?|pg||
nt|athene: if south's singleton spade had been another club, then he just about had a 5-level overcall|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has to choose between 2@S and 3@H, 3@S would be pre-emptive with 4-card support. |pg||
nt|haans: soon a double|pg||
nt|m_niemi: nice save to -1 by Viitasalo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sporty slam here|pg||
nt|jcmax: If EW agree on hearts, they will discover that one key card and the trump queen are missing|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: and I think they said 3M would show 5-5, but not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: it is a little better, K of @D can drop|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 3 @C 5+ @S 4+ @C, FG|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: what????????????????????????????????|pg||
nt|athene: 0-2-4-7 and you can bid 5@C over 4@S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But not with 2 x @D|pg||
nt|m_niemi: -2 would have been expensive|pg||
nt|athene: what strength is 1nt?|pg||
nt|athene: hard to imagine north doing anything but simply bidding 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: I believe 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 2@h?|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: The scores are still the same after 10 boards have been scored. Norway 20, Iceland 15 and Norway lack 4 VP|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cenglund: Nyberg has got a dream hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: However, they may still decide to bid it knowing they have a 9-card fit|pg||
nt|iceak:  slam is bad - end in 4@h most likely|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: maybe scared with spade void|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|haans: but 3 aces|pg||
nt|athene: he was worried his partner might pass when it was wrong|pg||
nt|athene: a huge board for EW in the other room - east found a way to show a modicum of heart support, which he might have been unable to do normally|pg||
nt|talion: 1@s is 9-14 4+@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: It may seem obvious for North to bid 3@S now, but he is rightly worried about a spade stack.|pg||
nt|dburn: slam is OK with West as declarer|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: it would be a bit unlawful to bid 3 over 3 here wouldn't it?|pg||
nt|haans: 8 boards to Iceland this far |pg||
nt|athene: the Total Tricks police would swoop down on you and drag you away screaming|pg||
nt|m_niemi: may get 13 tricks now|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  how much better is that?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: a couple pf % :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: of|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 2@S, FG, 2NT any 5c suit, 3@C asking, 3NT any 5c minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: this shouldn't take long +1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: one more claim|pg||
nt|psyck: E shows @c suit & slam interest, & that is about all he can do in practice|pg||
nt|cenglund: Another miss in the long list magic diamond failures|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: N was probably looking for a 5-3 major fit|pg||
nt|athene: ok that seems a bit odd - if 3@C asks you would think south has room to show all the suits|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D,3@H,3@S,3NT - he can say exactly which he has|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: true, maybe I misunderstood something :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund: of|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: will finess trumps|pg||
nt|cenglund: 13 tricks if you please|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: no bulletin|pg||
nt|athene: well it won't matter so much, he will capture the @SK and test both minors and find one that behaves and take his nine :)|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: This could be made I think.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: Well, HCP come into it as well. If he had 13 points he would bid 4S, even on a 5-3 fit.|pg||
nt|m_niemi: hard to bid in natural too|pg||
nt|athene: you might choose to test clubs first so that if both minors misbehave you are in hand to lead a heart to the king|pg||
nt|shevek: with @s 3-3, declarer needs to score a minor queen as the 9th trick|pg||
nt|shevek: ah, here comes the 9th trick :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|m_niemi: can you locate @s-honors|pg||
nt|cenglund: This one is a challenge for any bidding system|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4 trumps is enough now|pg||
nt|cenglund: On the way towards a push board|pg||
nt|iceak:  5@h simple RCKB - 2 aces and no queen|pg||
nt|shevek: not the ace!|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: of course not, thank you :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: 8th?|pg||
nt|shevek: :)|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Have to remove the A of @H first|pg||
nt|shevek: duck a @s?|pg||
nt|shevek: no, not good|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: then defense clears diamonds - and the A of @H is sitll an entry|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: King of @H is good enough|pg||
nt|milton_se: y|pg||
nt|shevek: @hK then|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pbmarstr: But then diamonds have to be 6-2. May be he is pondering on the double heart finesse|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: safe @CJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcmax: Now will they make it?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jcmax: If declarer starts trumps with the ace from dummy, an honour will appeear from North|pg||
nt|dburn: essentially, hearts for no loser is all 2-2 breaks except the "wrong" QJ doubleton plus a quarter of the 3-1 breaks|pg||
nt|shevek: why the Q, don't ask...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|arvidsson: once again a slam swing for Icland|pg||
nt|jcmax: And restricted choice would call for a finesse on the 2nd round of @H|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|dburn: but without a spade lead, the probabilities change slightly|pg||
nt|jcmax: But maybe the lack of NS bidding with a 9-card fit in @S will point declarer to the winning line of play|pg||
nt|shevek: Norway is now 2nd with only 1 VP behind|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|shevek: and has a much easier match than Iceland|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Interesting defense indeed|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  North had 2 tricks - now: 0|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcmax: When there was no bidding, it is a bit more likely the opposing hands are more balanced|pg||
nt|dburn: since if you cash the top trumps and find you have a loser, the man with three hearts might also have three diamonds|pg||
nt|shevek: well played by north|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|hawe45:  They have their fun...|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|milton_se: a couple of spades and @D10 seems a good idea|pg||
pc|dK|nt|shevek: now we can see the @sQ was a good play|pg||

mb|4C!|nt|rodal f: Hoftaniska tryed to make a result here? And did.|pg||
nt|m_niemi: NS has 8 tricks in @h|pg||
nt|cenglund: Bad bidding has cost dearly to the Finns|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 2 @H = 8-10|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: maybe we will se a 5@D sac.. going for 800|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, David, he definitely made us shut up :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: once again - 3nt is better than 4@h on 6-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: nasty surprise coming up for declarer|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|haans: i see 4@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Again North has a 5-4 hand in the majors and has to judge whether to rebid 2@H facing 1NT. I would not have done on that hand (missing the heart fit).|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not on a @S-lead to the 10 etc|pg||
nt|arvidsson: or will it be a flat 4@H making 650|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: not likely since the opening didn't promise length in diamonds :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  thought so :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: On this auction however, it may be North wondering whether his side has a slam.|pg||
nt|iceak:  Tempting for N to bid|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes! South could easily have the @CA instead of the K and slam would be laydown|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe Jorgensen could have followed his dream and bid six hearts anyway - I guess that's the par result|pg||
nt|jcmax: And at this vulnerability it often is a good tactic to simply bid slam. Look at that East hand. i don't think there is any way East would let his opponents play a confidently bid ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: 6@S|pg||
nt|iceak:  Problem for N - 4@s can be so many hands|pg||
nt|dburn: if Zia were North, he'd have bid 5@h - psychic exclusion keycard Blackwood|pg||
nt|jcmax: If N jumped to 6@S now, East would figure he must have a @H void and most likely would go for the save in 7@H|pg||
nt|dburn: then, East would certainly not let North-South play 6@s|pg||
nt|athene: north might double - he might have doubled 1@S too, especially if playing equal level conversion|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: deal 25: DEN made 4@s!x in OR|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@s X|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = @c|pg||
nt|athene: even if they don't usually play that, it must apply here|pg||
nt|athene: north can't have a monster with diamonds and pass over 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east has to wonder what happened to the heart suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: but both E and W said 7 HCP is possible :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes David, but then one would know he doesn't have the void. because with the void he would bid simple Blackwood :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes not dbling was bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: He will now find out.|pg||
nt|athene: actually i would not pass 1@S with that east hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: no point trying to trap 1@S - you are never defending 1@SX|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good point.|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: "Wise", said Sylvan when S passed|pg||
nt|dburn: of course he would - I was forgetting|pg||
nt|iceak:  forcing pass from south|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 4@h is still makeable|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: easy make|pg||
nt|athene: you know opps have at least an 8-card heart fit|pg||
nt|athene: just raise clubs|pg||
nt|haans: we seen that before direct 2@C forcing|pg||
nt|athene: well he must have some way to show a moderate club raise|pg||
nt|talion: 2@c is 9-14 5+@c|pg||
nt|milton_se: not so wise comment, then :)|pg||
nt|dburn: forcing? really?|pg||
nt|jcmax: S's pass was alerted, apparently he thinks it is forcing. More and more partnerships play fewer and fewer sequences as forcing. and I am quite sure that this would not be a forcing ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: pass for many top level partnerships despite the vulnerability|pg||
nt|iceak:  pass seems to be alerted|pg||
nt|dburn: would Larry Cohen's janitor think this one was forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: yep - it was alerted|pg||
nt|jbgood: but on a club lead the third @d trick goes away|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: 2!VC is no raise|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 2@C not forcing, you can bid 2@S to show a sound club raise.|pg||
nt|athene: even if i had to go to the 3-level, i would still do that|pg||
nt|athene: people get overly worried about their partner having a short minor|pg||
nt|m_niemi: this should go down|pg||
nt|jcmax: Oh, is it the janitor now, David? i always thought it was the bartender. :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the big difference - 3nt is easier.....|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But as often happens - when you can make 2, you bid 4|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @c + 2@s+2@d to EW|pg||
nt|jaapfr: make game|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jaapfr: @CK and @DA ok so 4@C+1 ok|pg||
nt|dburn: the poor fellow has two jobs nowadays - hard to make ends meet in these troubled times|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: Bilde alerted the double too, not sure what he thinks it is though|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Yes, make on a trump coup is apparent|pg||
nt|jbgood: pls disregard my previous comment:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|milton_se: 4@H +1 or 4@S =|pg||
nt|haans: so true :)|pg||
nt|athene: here, the odds are very low that west only has two clubs, because then he would have spade length - not likely, from east's hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, and he has let N/S find their heart fit, pushing them even higher in clubs.|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h = 11-16 against passed partner|pg||
nt|athene: in a sense declarer has seven tricks here with four spades, @HAK, @CA but he can't get to hand to finesse spades three times|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: 4@S make it harder for short spade suit to ruff|pg||
nt|athene: i mean west actually has the worst club length he could ever have and it would still have been better to raise directly|pg||
nt|cenglund: A good board for the Finns as the cards are lie|pg||
nt|cenglund: Only 8 trick against best defence|pg||
nt|dburn: well done everyone|pg||
nt|iceak:  ended in 5@h in 11 and 11 imps to Iceland|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|brolucius: Yes, it is losing bridge to hold back and say 'You might have had only 2 clubs'. What about all the other hands where West has more than 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S must find @h to keep this in 8 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|m_niemi: 7 imps to Finns|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|cenglund: even -3 is possible|pg||
nt|shevek: I cant see how declarer could avoid losing 1@s, 1@h and 2@c|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|milton_se: in theory, absolutely|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|milton_se: routine now|pg||

nt|ralfwil: finess....|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzds: will he play a club to the ace? if he assumes the @D ace is offside|pg||
pc|s3|nt|milton_se: nor can I|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: it's quite interesting how you SHOULD play those spades for four tricks if you do have plenty of entries to the east hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and S is squeezed|pg||
nt|athene: leading to the queen then the jack gains on a 3-3 break and the actual layout but loses to @SK10xx with south|pg||
nt|jbennet: dont worry about it south will be sqeezed.|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes, cashing the diamonds out was not the best move for the defence :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: not easy to discard ffrom dummy either|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|milton_se: expected 10 for Sweden on board 7 (the tough 4@H)|pg||
pc|cT|mc|9|nt|athene: as terence reese said, in defence against 3nt beware of cashing out four tricks unless you have a very good idea where the fifth is coming from|pg||
nt|athene: the same principle applies in 1nt too|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|monsted: 3 må være den rigtige melding og hæv fra Øst|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Konstruktiv. De har 2@D som en dårligere indmelding|pg||
nt|jbennet: öst har nu chansen a) han kan förhålla sig passiv eller b) narkera att "jag kan också va me på brickan"|pg||
nt|jr7: Ask må kunne 3 @S|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Så 2@S svarer i virkeligheden til hvad vi andre melder 3@S på|pg||
nt|monsted: jeg er ligeglad om det er konstruktivt man har ikke ca 8 stik på egen hånd|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka: tänkte väl det. Svårt för öst ändå, hade varit trevligt med ett ess eller 3-stöd. Men hackorna i hjärter ser lovande ut|pg||
nt|monsted: 3 spar beskriver hånden perfekt = den 7.spar|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbennet: skulle han förhålla passiv så kommer den passiviteten att leverera -15 IMP typ (lite brutalare än vanligt).|pg||
nt|jr7: men 4@S på egen hånd??|pg||
nt|monsted: se nu nu går det helt galt|pg||
nt|petka: nu ser hackorna i östs hand ännu bättre ut, skulle inte förvåna mig om han balanserar med 4S|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbennet: (det normal är att passivitet kostar typ 6-8 IMP men denna gång blev straffet lite hårdare. |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jr7: et dyrt spil til DK :(|pg||

nt|milton_se: no|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cheap mistakes in bidding and play here - the board was lost, when they bid over 2 @H|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N: "should I have passed"? :)|pg||
nt|pelu: nice result for NS - if playing pairs :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Einarson must be wondering why he is not playing rubber|pg||
nt|jcmax: This looks like an uncomplicated 2N-3N or similar|pg||
nt|iceak:  3NT or 5@c ?|pg||
nt|athene: i would have avoided the whole issue by doubling with north and getting into 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: still, when he took the club ruff in trick two he could often recover had he seen the bad split on the second round of trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS had got to 3@H on THEIR 9-card fit, so there was some lawfulness going on|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N has a very rotten opening hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: DEN has gotten to 6@c too, it's their day|pg||
nt|cenglund: Not necessarily, because many pairs may have gone overboard|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  he gets a lot of nice hands|pg||
mb|1C|nt|haans: 6@C?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: And E/W did well going to the 4-level on their 8-card fit. So, perhaps total trumps does not explain everything.|pg||
nt|haans: would like a take out here|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Both 4 @H and 4 @S is on|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@d really?|pg||
mb|d|nt|shevek: 1@s really??  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: no, misclick, yes 1@S really :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: really a make but who believes it|pg||
nt|milton_se: well, the splinter may pave the way|pg||
nt|haans: AQ in diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: trust that show five clubs|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south will bid 2nt now|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT, one hopes - 5@c might be difficult to make|pg||
nt|jcmax: The S hand is really quite balanced. There doesn't seem to be any obvious reason to go and look for 5@C instead of 3NT|pg||
nt|shevek: :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Gerben42:  now 4@C |pg||
nt|jbennet: now lets see if NS have the possibility to stay 1 major|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 3 nt ew|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: or maybe 3@C|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@c strong|pg||
nt|m_niemi: E ducked 1st heart to make sure of 8 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: Bjarnarsson-Askgaard in 6@C in board 27|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly not - of course, on a bad day partner has two low in a red suit, and 5@c makes while 3NT does not, but even so...|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though a double of 1@D would have been takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|mmmakela: impossible to get into now|pg||
nt|athene: rather than showing diamonds which is normal|pg||
nt|shevek: imo west should've bid a bigger number of @s|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|m_niemi: no 1@s bid by W|pg||
nt|shevek: he allowed NS to find their fit, now 5@h = good sac|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|brolucius: Not a very good 3NT if the @CQ is doubleton and it still goes down.|pg||
nt|athene: well you might lead the @CJ to pin east's @C10x|pg||
nt|athene: but just playing for either defender to have doubleton queen looks more sensible|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Declarer can afford to missguess the trumps|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I think this is the way to show a decent hand with long spades, a direct jump would have shown lesser defense.|pg||
nt|shevek: he's in 3rd seat though|pg||
nt|shevek: I mean, pd passed|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: But  I agree that you let your opponents get more room.|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Matter of taste, I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 3@D was inviting to heart game|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: and 3@H was a good raise in spades|pg||
nt|milton_se: even in 3rd hand some clarity is needed, I think|pg||
mb|4D|nt|brolucius: East's double makes the @CQ a more likely doubleton when so few points are out.|pg||
nt|athene: he knows he is down anyway so he will just knock out the @DA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bill's idea of bidding 2NT was at least 120% better than 3NT. Why not?|pg||
nt|athene: fourth best @H4 means the hearts can't be 6-3 so even if east has the @HA you can never isolate west|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 4@H is not easy to make|pg||
nt|jbennet: no they couldnt|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: 4@C-4@S-p|pg||
nt|milton_se: this is the crucial decision|pg||
nt|athene: you are sure to lose four hearts and the @DA|pg||
nt|m_niemi: which would have helped E to lead @sJ|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: At least EW will bid to 4 @S now|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe this was the plot to get doubled in 4@s?|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I do not think any NS player can double.|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: not likely since NS have found their double fit, at least if 3/4@D was semi-natural|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: But can they bid 5?|pg||
nt|milton_se: the problem will be 5@S or not|pg||
nt|milton_se: NS know that they have some 9 tricks|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Bilde better bid 5 now, or he has thought his partner out of the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: Bilde is holding a pass...|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: almost put it on the tray|pg||
nt|shevek: he's holding it for too long|pg||
nt|shevek: partner won't be able to bid now|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: but took it away again, and have it in his hand right now...|pg||
nt|milton_se: South has bid all his values|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: now taking a glance on the CC|pg||
nt|shevek: he won't find there what 1@s, 2@s and 4@s means :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund: The Danes are in the winning streak|pg||
nt|athene: you can often keep opps out by playing in a 4-3 fit :) neither defender is short enough to double|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: funny 3nt C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: and not the @C fit either|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: South can guess that there is only one heart stopper available and his bundle of secondary honors will be unproductive.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: not a good start for defence|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: of course you might find it's a pyrrhic victory when you lose lots of hundreds|pg||
nt|milton_se: I gues Sylvan qpuld like to finesse spades now - bu can't|pg||
nt|shevek: south bid @c and @h and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: if he thinks @S are 3-1 he might cash one, and try to cross with a club|pg||
nt|shevek: so not much room for Qxx|pg||
pc|sA|nt|milton_se: don't think 4@S is available anymore|pg||
nt|haans: looks like they cannot find a 6-2 in spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive me, N had that as a sarcastic quest. Tundal(the father of Wiking prec) is to good for that|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3x@d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|arvidsson: ok easy 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|arvidsson: understandble lead not seeing all cards|pg||
nt|jbennet: thats why the sequence 1 kl - 1 d (h) - 1 h - 1 spade=|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 card spade suit not forcing.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|m_niemi: EW must find their @c-suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  can afford to lose this trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  can claim next |pg||
nt|arvidsson: he will discard a club|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and then another @C goes on @SQ|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|haans: scary|pg||
nt|milton_se: really - @S ruff och @H shift|pg||
nt|milton_se: or|pg||
nt|arvidsson: some kibitzers saying that discarding a @C is no good if @H are 5-0|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The same contract was played in the OR|pg||
pc|sK|nt|m_niemi: after @dA Easts only chance is to play @c|pg||
nt|psyck: it was bid well, E showed his @c suit, @h shortness & @s cue, so W could bid 6@c|pg||
nt|shevek: the 9!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: question what did 3@S mean?|pg||
nt|athene: south doesn't want to play low here and then run into a ruff when west underled the ace|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|cenglund: Now defence can't afford a single slip|pg||
nt|shevek: always Q9 ...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbennet: have played that for 15 years or so and the estimated total IMP-flow is about +1,5 -2 IMP:s/board|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The defence has been very good so far|pg||
pc|hK|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jbennet: now 2 rounds of D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cenglund: That was 1 too much|pg||
nt|psyck: if i understand the bids that is :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Gerben42:  @C 4-1 is more likely though|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|s4|nt|cenglund:  They missed that opportunity|pg||
nt|athene: two rounds of diamonds first might work well if south took the force - then you can draw his trump and run the diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but it didn't matter as the cards lay|pg||
nt|jbennet: that should have been played before cashing heart queen.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wrong tempo now|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: it doesn't matter, declarer can always just discard a spade on the diamond|pg||
nt|athene: and cut west out|pg||

nt|jcmax: There is a school that calls for the lead of the 4-card suit, when you old both a 5- and a4-card suit. But here East went even further :)|pg||

mb|d!|nt|haans: again transfer|pg||
nt|athene: you are going to score 450|pg||
nt|mmmakela: here a typical spot to W make a psych bid|pg||
nt|shevek: dbl I guess shows 5@s|pg||
mb|3H|nt|milton_se: 1@H not 4-card|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@d = 0-7/13+|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1Nt = 15-17|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@H probably shows @S|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - maybe if the theory was refined still further, he'd have led his singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: for many suedes it dent 18-19 hcp balanced|pg||
nt|haans: deny|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 1@h = 11-13 2-3@h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West had some discards to show, what he had - so...|pg||
nt|cenglund: With a decent 2-suiter W's hand was worth an overcall|pg||
nt|iceak:  2@c propably convention called "hexan" in Iceland - most of the time 16+HCP |pg||
nt|vugraphzds: D = transfer, 4+@S|pg||
nt|shevek: thx D|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: 13 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: they are fast running out of time. 12 min for this and two more boards|pg||
nt|athene: 13 on top but can you find that out?|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@C here looks like some version of the popular Italian Gazilli convention, where 2@C over 1N is artificial and shows all stronger hand types|pg||
nt|iceak:  16+ or @h and @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: was explained as either strong, balanced or natural|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west could have got cute|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: @sK by W would have made situation clear to E|pg||
nt|cenglund: All the big numbers in IMPs stem from good bidding versus bad|pg||
nt|arvidsson: if S pass will West reopen with 2 @D ?|pg||
nt|jcmax: What does hexan actually mean? As a word?|pg||
nt|iceak:  Like a witch|pg||
nt|dburn: I think West is supposed to bid 2@d with 8+ hcp or so, so that 2@h shows less than that|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceak:  2@d means 9+ HCP|pg||
nt|jcmax: Interesting, I wonder why the convention got that name.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Presumably 1@H-2@H would have been constructive.|pg||
nt|dburn: easier to spell than Gazzilli, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: negative double perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: or something :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: as a discard|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N has @sA so switch please|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 3 @H = absolute max for passing, with support|pg||
nt|milton_se: this make be an important board - 4@S may make|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 2 NT would be a weaker good raise|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: What does 3 @H means. Weak? In that case S is much too strong for the bid.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: Not an easy grand to reach. We will see,|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In the other room, Charlsen also found this brillant lead|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = 14-16? or 15-17?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Without the @D-finesse, the contract looks fine...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A push board|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: Relays the way|pg||
nt|athene: all west has to do is ask for keycards and then find the @HK really|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: cards for 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, because he knows now that East has four hearts.|pg||
nt|athene: he could do that by simply bidding blackwood over 2@H, if that is possible|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT is quite a bid |pg||
nt|jcmax: If that is the case, clearly W has a mximum for his bidding so far. Can he go on over 3@H?|pg||
nt|jcmax: He could. :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|milton_se: no grand slam on board 9 in OR|pg||
nt|haans: was not easy to find|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 14-16|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D Ace, @S and the loosing @D-finesse = a lot of tricks to E/W|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like that D from N - he know that N+E has 34 HCP - why push partner|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I mean pass would have been a view but this too|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 3nt is a god result, declarer only have 8 certain tricks|pg||
nt|arvidsson: can get the 9th in @H |pg||
nt|arvidsson: but this is the kind of contracts you are very happy to make|pg||
nt|iceak:  W does not like to bid 2@h with so many loosing tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: 1 nt plays much better than 3@c did next door|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Top spot for E-W on this lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a pickup for norway - 8 tricks and 4 imps|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|athene: looks as though he is relaying for the shape in which case he will find out what he needs to know|pg||
nt|athene: relay methods are really very good at finding grand slams|pg||
nt|haans: 5 controls (A=2 K=1)|pg||
nt|brolucius: They will be happy to pick up some hands so well suited to relay bidding.|pg||
nt|cenglund: Three of the four misses go to the account of Nyberg-Koistinen|pg||
nt|dburn: does the Icelandic alpahbet include the letter "z"?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer has 10 tricks in @H. The only thing he has to be careful about is establishing dummy's @C trick, before dummy's trump entry is gone.|pg||

nt|brolucius: On a spade lead, the hearts are blocked and you may need clubs 2-1.|pg||

nt|milton_se: has to make the right decision in Cs though|pg||
nt|athene: right, otherwise a spade lead takes an entry out and you can't get back to the east hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  8 tricks to E/W is not -1|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|milton_se: @CK and @CJ now |pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: some bid showing 3-4-3-3 am sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is what you meant by playing the hand during the bidding, Bill. A good example.|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 6@c is easier to bid after 15-17 1NT than after 12-14 opening|pg||
nt|m_niemi: DEN had better bidding methods though|pg||

pc|h6|nt|jbgood: NS might have competed in @ds though|pg||

pc|h9|nt|iceak:  Was - but Z has been removed from Icelandic alphabet|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Yet on a  lead defence would prevail|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if E shows @hKQ and @cQJ W must have all the other high cards, for pass is 0-8 hcp by E|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  a very solid set by Iceland|pg||
nt|iceak:  Z vas abandoned 1974 or 1976|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|jbgood: Iceland and Sweden currently co-leaders, Sweden up ag Denmark in the last round, whereas Iceland faces Finland|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Many thanks too to my fellow commentators, Hans and Bill. Always a pleasure to sit alongside them on the virtual commentators' bench.|pg||
nt|psyck: bjarnarsson opened 1NT with 12 too, so same 12-14 range for them too|pg||
nt|m_niemi: oh, sry, they play (11)12-14 hcp 1NT in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: D = 0-5 HCP|pg||
nt|arvidsson: a good reult from open room NS |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Difficult to bid, this one|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@c = 16+, 1NT 9-13 hcp bal|pg||
nt|cenglund: This is an excellent slam, because of the superb fit|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@D = good @H raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: N's pass alerted as showing some extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: I wonder if this is defined as a forcing pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 1@H = 0-6 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  3@H next?|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: W's double showed diamonds|pg||
nt|arvidsson: he sure does have a good hand, if EW have 8-9 @D|pg||
nt|dburn: if so, North-South may be in some jeopardy|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: Graversen alerted the pass|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|haans: may go one down|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cenglund:  A good save|pg||
nt|cenglund:  4S looks unbeatable|pg||
nt|jbgood:  2 more imps for Norway|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: Wrang in deep thought on what to lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: will be fine unless he underleads the @H ace :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: a low heart is what he should try to avoid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: one of his aces and everything is clear|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: he is probably deciding which one to lead|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Low heart is a bit far-fetched|pg||
nt|jbgood: was kidding:)|pg||
nt|milton_se: as is @CQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E has probabli 6-5 in @d and @c on the bidding. with only 4@c, 4nt instead of 5@c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably...|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may ask his prd to borrow a @d for a trump lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: Wrang asks west if he wants to pick a card at random for him...|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: now gives him two cards to choose from|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: his aces :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|m_niemi: this is beatable, i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: when S tabled dummy Sylvan asked declarer if he wanted to buy out for 1 down - he did not :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: once again a borderline contract|pg||
nt|dburn: not that 5@c is cold necessarily, of course|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  what can you do, allow them to play 3@D?|pg||
nt|jbennet: man har 5404.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: hearts now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cenglund: The Norwegians did not even sniff the possibility of a slam|pg||
nt|jcmax: Wow! West is very convinced of his case! he can "envision his partner holding a void in @S. but sometimes 3rd hand opens a 4-card @S-suit and then partner all of a sudden doesn't ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: have a void....|pg||
nt|iceak:  If anyone makes it - it is AÃ°alsteinn|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|milton_se: can wait|pg||
nt|m_niemi: just continue @c|pg||

nt|milton_se: second bad comment from Johan :) :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: that was the option|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  still hard to beat this one|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  can lose @SAK and two trumps|pg||
pc|h9|nt|m_niemi: not a norwegian slam so stay in game:)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: and dec is in problems|pg||
nt|psyck: the @d's are dead, but E can be endplayed a bit, will be a tuf fight|pg||
nt|cenglund: However, the bad breaks may bring them an undeserved gain|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|pelu: agree Christer - 4@H is the pålace where u like to be|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer has only two losers, but he doesn't have eleven winners, and a trump lead...|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: that's one way to solve the problem!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: ... though I suppose, with a winning view in diamonds, he has six clubs, three diamonds and two heart ruffs on the table|pg||

nt|shevek: I'd like to thank my fellow commentators Bertil Johnson & Peter Marstrander|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: he claimed that he would play everything from the top, and maybe have a show-up squeeze in the end, but there was none, so one IMP to Sweden|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: :) Until we meet again :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: last hand of the match, back soon with the last match of the tournament|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still, Einarsson's redouble had everything going for it - the contract was very unlikely to be more than one down, and if it panicked his opponents into redoubling, he could ...|pg||
nt|dburn: envisage a massacre|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|dburn: sorry, into running|pg||
nt|jcmax: 3N-1 in the other room. It looks like there are 9 tricks, but declarer has serious communication problems in a NT contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: E thought he could beat 4@h on   12 and doubled - for 5 more imps to Norway|pg||
mb|d|nt|shevek: and our capable operator, Daniel Gullberg who did an excellent job|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: thank you|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: A splnter bid gets Iceland to this slam. Let's see if North finds the same rebid.|pg||
nt|cenglund: This might be a costly excercise|pg||
nt|m_niemi: last time S had 12 hcp when he doubled|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  on a trump lead @HJ wins, @DA, @CA, @D ruff, @C ruff, @D ruff, @S|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|haans: slam?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: ok last board in both rooms|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks all|pg||

nt|pelu: in OR N open|pg||
nt|m_niemi: making 2spades and @hAQ|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N knows that NS has maximum 25 hcp, opps have at least 8 spades,...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: non vul means that game should be 50% to bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  dbl = @H, 2nd dbl = support|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Yes as well as 5H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 5@s is 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  2 @D is a winner|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Where do you dispose the losing heart?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: already said no:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: will S find another bid?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 5@c is beatable too|pg||

nt|milton_se: time to X|pg||
nt|cenglund: They are off the hook now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: nice bid|pg||
nt|dburn: and the diamonds came in for no losers, but poor South was still left wishing (like the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz) "if I only had a heart..."|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@h was interesting but 5@d will never make I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 4@H down two on two club ruffs - creating a trump trick for E|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: And still 3 NT could win when the @D Q drops|pg||
nt|pbertheau: good  wrang|pg||
nt|shevek: Norway won the event 4 times out of the last 6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: I guess it could, with the @hJ dropping as well - six hearts, two diamonds and a black trick|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well, definitely 3N is the one game that has some hope. The question is how to get there when nobody has a clear @C stopper|pg||
pc|h3|nt|m_niemi: can make 2, bid 4 again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 2 more matches tomorrow - starting 9.00|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best is now 3 rounds of @s|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: 500|pg||
nt|milton_se: obvious that NS systematically open 11+|pg||
nt|haans: Skalmar bidding|pg||
nt|haans: Skalmar and then Carrot|pg||
nt|athene: NS in the other room were more in control and might have found a good grand if south had the @SA not @DA|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@D was a better rebid, even if 2@H was forcing to game and 3@H was therefore forcing. |pg||
nt|cenglund:  Well done by Wrang|pg||
nt|jbgood: wd by S|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|m_niemi: 2@ds and a @s-switch by E|pg||

nt|vugraphzds: N has shown his exact pattern|pg||

pc|sT|nt|brolucius: Still, both sides did well to reach 6@H.|pg||
