mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|3C|an|4!h, inv|nt|sheila a: Yes, leader needs to know when to underlead and trick 2 and when to keep cashing|pg||

nt|idc: For most of this set we won't get comparisons from the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: thus he couldn't play @dQ - K dropping 9 to set up 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: he asked for a club I believe, Hackett led a diamond having none and the club ruff stood out a mile|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ady: heart position very favourable for e/w|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: other room playing the slam hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: EW CC at http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/hollandhallberg.pdf|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Strange to see john holland playing a strong NT, he's played a weak NT for 45 years|pg||
nt|capercliff: it wasnt easy from south's point of view was it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: mind you i can tell you a few of my defensive errors if you like :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I'm all ears|pg||
nt|yo_yo: more difficult for south|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: so obviously not all that difficult|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|idc: A borderline invitational hand for East|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: the 9@h was a curious card from that holding, looking at dummy it looks as though the A@d couldn't hurt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but wouldnt the biddin tell you somebody has got to lead a D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Brian Short is very experienced, he will put that one behind him quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: a risky balance|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: (we celebrated his 60th birthday back in december)|pg||
nt|idc: At matchpoints at least - oplaying teams you have to make a try|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: shure he's only a youngfella|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes indeed, but Soouth could have been leading into the A@d|pg||
nt|capercliff: with Qx in dummy|pg||
nt|idc: Mind you, since this should go -2, perhaps something to be said for not inviting|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Penton borrows opp CC and heads to the Leads section|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jtr: Declarer started well next door but ran out of steam|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead best    difficult to find|pg||
nt|ady: diamond tricks now gone|pg||
nt|jtr: Eventually losing 2@hs and 3@cs|pg||
nt|ady: 3 clubs seems odd    would have tht 2 clubs and 3 hearts |pg||
nt|idc: As one of you notes, West didn't break the transfer, so some maximum hands for spades can be excluded|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: even this 13 doesn't feel very max, feels more min|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: well why did N double without trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Maybe north thought partner was void, if it had been a fit jump|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: I like West's 1NT|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i think brian short was a bit too forward here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pjs_ch: yes but very awkward bid for Hallberg - what woudl you bid with his hand?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe they are playing 6-ace blackwood|pg||

nt|ady: problem getting to east   no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: the card says 1430 and he explained it as 1|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|ady: south has problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzhw: a kind of endplay now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or even a drop|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pjs_ch: with 3@H passable, X must be takeout, but you lack four spades|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Penton asks about discards: odd encouraging, even suit-preference|pg||
nt|idc: I guess West's 1NT is fine playing a weak-NT system - partner won't have a balanced minimum|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|capercliff: North could have given @s count?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Goodman puts hand down, leans forward|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ianmcc: like 4NT|pg||

pc|h6|nt|pjs_ch: what typing !! must do better  !!1|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: ok, board annulled, 3 IMP to EW and we move on to board 8|pg||
nt|idc: I guess N-S have missed 4@h as a result|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|capercliff: if Goodman plays the J@c will W cover?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but he probably wont|pg||

pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event  May 26-29|pg||

nt|jtr: Ah!  1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice to meet you|pg||
nt|Walddk1: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if Im opened 1H vul on that w hand I would be crucified - by my partner|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree but many think 1 aces and a King make for a compulsory opening|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 aces i mean|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and to be fair he simply said "Brilliant defence"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Hallberg folds hand up, ponders|pg||
nt|jcomyn: on this auction i would pass the x|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: But I am the best|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he might to see how the land lies|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: OR now playing this board, we are soon to be overtaken|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we believe you :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: he needs to find @HQ   |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk1: No you are not!|pg||
nt|jtr: Hope you analyse better than 2-14:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Why the pause?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: 2N was not GF for this pair, which means they must allow 3@H as minimum|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what clues does he have?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can imagine John's comment if this goes down|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: fact of no trump lead might point him the right way|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: John looks in very good mood, can't imagine a bad comment if it goes down :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: If he manages to count the hand, he will play S for @HQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|capercliff: on the surface it may be the right play anyway, unless playing for a stiff Q|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pjs_ch: but he can survive misguessing because the clubs are 33 and spade loser goes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: millions wouldn't|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ady: declarer thinking about 4-1 spade split|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he must play 2 anyway surely?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: along the lines of "hard luck pd?" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: perhaps he'll try and get defence to open trumps somehow?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he'll wonder why North led from a dangerous Kxxx now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think that's the normal thing to do , bad luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: that's an odd return given he should have full count|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: dangerous though|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: yes    but likely thinking ahead what can be done if 4-1|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: he might be more worried about hearts-41 and he can only cope with that if South has length|pg||
nt|mcarroll: stating the obvious , how do I avoid a @H ;loser as 2 @S losers pretty inevitable|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: only one spade loser - one goes on club|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: well you might lead CJ and see if there is any flutter on your left|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pjs_ch: needed spade switch at trick two to test him|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||

nt|jcomyn: see anything breaking 2-2 with pre-dealt boards|pg||
nt|idc: That may well be the correct ruling in this situation but sometimes TDs in the UK seem too quick to solve a problem by cancelling the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: some very distributional hands this set|pg||
mb|2D|an|nat, min|nt|jcomyn: spades nicely placed|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: oh, is this Gazilli?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2 spades and a low club, but Pazur won't fall for it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: certain to get club right   but should still be only 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I hope we have people out there who understand it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: odd lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C  = 3 way if i understand their card|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what do you mean odd john?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|santyclz: S may have been forced to pass by the exposed card of may have chosen to because of 3 small @ss.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: hate quitting with 5-4 s fit|pg||
nt|capercliff: another interesting play hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: it's been explained as "hearts + 5c minor"|pg||
nt|santyclz: (or)|pg||
nt|idc: Very good Tim - did the rest of the table ask North to check he wasn't still holding cards from Bd 6?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we found empty slot in board 8, I believe - out of my vision|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|capercliff: Short will have to pin the (@s I think, will he find it?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Surely a low club now|pg||

nt|capercliff: the 9@s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think he will :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pjs_ch: agreed but not clear that even 2@S will make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: surely "the Law" indicates competing to 3@S?|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would have thought so|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: the w bid here he3lped|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pjs_ch: work cut out in 3@C here - a "winning" hearts guess might not be good for him|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe dixon not sure if it's a 5 card suit opposite|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: needs @SK and another now|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: to cut off the heart suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: indeed, it could well be 4@s with @d in South hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that would be the defence of the year |pg||
nt|ianmcc: what about the third @h?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|capercliff: it may be his only chance, unless he plays W for a stiff honor|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|vugraphzfv: Short asks: "count on @dA" Dew shrugs - no agreement.|pg||
nt|capercliff: he needs to start with the J or 10 here, a lot easier for us to see|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Yes, force him to ruff with K while trump stilloutstanding|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|idc: Last bd - can I thank the EBU for allowing us to feature the event,|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Final deal of the set here and Ireland due to win by 47-3 IMP (so far, incl the board 7 penalty) - 25-4 VP.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: he doesn't hang about|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: BBO as always for this great software, and my fellow commentator Joe|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: We will resume at 17:45, in half an hour's time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good for him|pg||
nt|yo_yo: :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|eamongall: but also as it was 2nd board that defence would not find a @S ruff |pg||
nt|santyclz: Thx Ian, great job Tim.|pg||
nt|idc: But last and most of all, thanks on your behalf to our Operator and Commentator, Tim Dickinson|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I'm sure he could manage playing as well if he put his mind to it :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: Not in front of a huge audience!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|capercliff: X|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: good preference for @h :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: ooo-er|pg||
nt|idc: Automatic redbls is a convention that goes well with 12-14 NT|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|capercliff: Short will not defend 2@h|pg||
mb|2N|nt|idc: and anyway, they are fun - I expect West will sit for this|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: North is first to blink :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: this all looks natural in a checkback-free system|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: last board of the set, this one, it's zipped by|pg||
mb|3N|nt|capercliff: is it possible to bid this game?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: no surprise there with that hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: they discovered no @H control, so no slam|pg||
nt|mcarroll: back to another making contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Dixon says not 100% sure 4@c was cue - either suit or cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: last hand of the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: any commentators been re-gagged?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont think sop|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: put your hand up if so and I'll ungag|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not me anyway|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Tim, your running commentry is first class!|pg||
nt|capercliff: no|pg||
nt|idc: To be honest, that SOuth hand is pretty sub-minimum for dbl with the singleton King|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: right, this is the last board of the set|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx all|pg||
nt|capercliff: thanks all, cu for the next set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: next at 13:05|pg||
nt|idc: and no good lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: So a mundane result instead of an exciting board.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit mousy in both rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: next set at 12:05|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yo_yo: no 4-4 or 5-3 fit   |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: presumably strong ten lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a quick play of the @H then claim|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so a good win for England|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: next set soon?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Holland very trusting of his partner at trick 1 :) much laughter when @hK holds|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 9.35 i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: that's all for now, folks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks, see you all then|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: next set 21:35, probably|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx all not an exciting set |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: TD confirms 21:35, be back then :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how does that affect the table ?|pg||
