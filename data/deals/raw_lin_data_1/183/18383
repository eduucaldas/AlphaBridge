mb|1N|nt|athene: a bit of an awkward auction in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|athene: it can't be right to open 1@S and rebid 2NT|pg||
nt|bagman: N might be forced to open 1NT as he has no convenient rebid|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: whatever you do with it :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: well 6 imps or so back to austria|pg||
nt|tez: i prefer 1@s..and 2@c rebid|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c8|mc|10|nt|bagman: I'm not sure but I think that N had options to open 1@D and then reverse in spades or open 1NT; from those two I prefer 1NT opening (please, correct me, if I 'm wrong, playd Blue ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|bessi2: but not sure I understand why he didn't start with a dbl|pg||

nt|noodle:  good morning George, Shirley|pg||
nt|daman: NS must be careful not to give East a Club pitch on the @H King     they have to take their tricks in order|pg||
nt|hawe45:  IÂ´m a little late - due to pc-problems... see you...|pg||

pc|hT|nt|rodal f: Ego, but wrong color.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E was lucky to find partner with A@s third, not xxx |pg||

nt|sfoxa:  http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html current results|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  1@d from E was negative bid - lesser than 7 points|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  rest is obvious|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d start allows defence to get extra trick - @d ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html for actual results|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  oops...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: have we a problem|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can't appreciate N's switch, but supposingly, he has a reason for it. |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now it's up to E|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the obvious reason is to cut off the dummy, but having decent @c trick, why doesn't N retrurn partner's suit - @d?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though this beginning is a helping hand for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying to count tricks, I do not see 9 yet |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|baldfriede: even 3@s will probably not make. noentries tothe @h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|passell: looks like deutch had his rose colored glasses on here|pg||
nt|gulyas: really, a simple double followed by a cue sould have been enough|pg||
nt|gulyas: or at least pass the 4@S|pg||
nt|passell: might have defended 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|bessi2: unfortunately we didn't get to see Larsen's decision over 2@h dbl|pg||
nt|gulyas: its only 500|pg||
nt|bessi2: I prefer pass,  but it is by no means automatic in my view|pg||
nt|passell: against 450 or 420|pg||
nt|sybarra: got off to ok lead for n/s |pg||
nt|sybarra: gave nothing away |pg||
nt|vugraphzge: no problem here, just thinking...|pg||
nt|granguru: Jan Jansma is ranked 68 in WBF 986 MP 4.5 PLACING POINT wim (world International Master)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|puncher99: welcome to the spectators and the operator|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: ah he didnt play the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: sorry, but we had connection problems|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hello all.|pg||
nt|taliga: We start the second section with a dull 4@h|pg||
nt|taliga: Hi Rodal|pg||
pc|s3|nt|passell: his only legitimate make is both dia honors onside|pg||
nt|passell: or catching 3 spades in the weak 2 bidders hand|pg||
nt|psyck: At this vul, 2@h-x-pass could well be the favorite|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree|pg||
nt|daman: I would have played a low @H towards the King at trick 2   while I still had the @S entry|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly would force S to make a quick decision |pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no problem in 3nt either but then E dopesnt know that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: everything works|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi John|pg||
nt|chick: well, double dummy it does :)   the club finesse doesn't|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi all|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: with the cards this favorable game might conceiveably be made|pg||
nt|daman: ouch|pg||
nt|daman: mind you   it would have probably come to this in the end game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's RR stage in 2 groups, winner of each group qualifies for the final|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello John|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: hi John|pg||
pc|sT|nt|passell: looks like down 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: he could make with W having 3631, and @SJ9 doubleton in E|pg||
nt|passell: yes exactly or both dia onside and east forgetting to cover the 9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: welcom -- sorry for the slightly late start|pg||
nt|granguru: Jan Paulissen, also a WIM, is ranked 161. started in 1990 becoming 7th in the 12th youth european championship|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I'm not public chat|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  too many HCP in @D and too few in the long suits|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gulyas: cash 2 trumps, and cash all @Hs, ruffing 2 @Ds in hand|pg||
nt|taliga: While waiting: EW employs a kind of big @c, NS has standard, with weak (11-14) NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running scores at  http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Gerben42:  maybe duck a @S and then squeeze W|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: does he really have a choice here? |pg||
pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  gift accepted with thanks...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Frank Budai|pg||
nt|taliga: (not every 11)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  duck two @S even to rectify the count|pg||
pc|cA|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this couil;d be a long day at this pace|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bessi2: yes or simply @s 3-2 and QJx in @d|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  on the other hand if you catch one of East's honors the @S10 may be  9|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting position |pg||
nt|sybarra: still an interesting position |pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: whatever, certainly was not easy at the table |pg||
pc|cT|nt|daman: no choice|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vbman: needs guess in sp|pg||
mc|8|nt|sfoxa:  is declarer waiting till defence starts playing trumps? |pg||

nt|ralfwil: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|granguru: there are 2 swedish wrangs in the rank..frederik and thomas..who is now playing?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: could learn from the seniors last week especially Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  could be costly for Germany|pg||
nt|hawe45:  IÂ´m back - which my two special frienmde "the doctorÂ´s" will deeply regret (N/S...)|pg||
nt|tomi2: Wladow-Elinescu have changed their system and now play strong-club / natural depending on vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Elinescu asked his partner, why he hasn't played @d back....|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: no, the last tricks were too fast for me...|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  good question, but bad time for it|pg||
mb|1D|nt|chessmaste: Welcome to all 8 spectators!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We'll be live soon|pg||
nt|karesz:  4 @h by NS?|pg||
nt|daman: East was a bit too heavy for a Flannery opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For sure - he didÂ´nt want partner to take tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  TY, Lukas :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: but the score is right :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that the most important point|pg||
nt|tez: this can make 4@s with open cards |pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mark and Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You'll get more, don't worry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This was the last table up because the operator opened an invisible one by mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's why we don't have a result on board 1 entered|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and no names yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Susan will catch up, eventually, please be patient|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Sometimes best if no one knows your name|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@s will be no picnic for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now names|pg||
nt|bessi2: at least -3 it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Except Diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All good now, thanks Susan|pg||
nt|passell: with a club lead and dia return east has to find the heart shift|pg||
nt|roswolf: a filthy opening even 3rd in hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk4: 2/1 for N-S, Precision for E-W|pg||
nt|bessi2: good decision by Diamond to pass 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 13-15|pg||
nt|puncher99: choice of lebensol or neg x here|pg||
nt|taliga: NS overcall very agressively|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  firstly, NS have to have a tool for intervention|pg||
nt|sybarra: so he made it |pg||
nt|chick: NS may reach 4@S, dependent on finesses in the black suits, but both lie wrong|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sommer: more ketchup?|pg||
nt|puncher99: may be playing better minor lebensol|pg||
nt|rodal f: A partscore to come if not EW want to play with there @S color.|pg||
nt|vbman: h' all|pg||
mb|d|nt|bessi2: missing a pass operator|pg||
nt|karesz:  1 NT 11-14|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not anymore.|pg||
nt|sybarra: be lucky you are blasted off of bbo for using that word.|pg||
nt|daman: is 3@D a transfer bsck to @Hs?|pg||
nt|sybarra: >if you are not blasted off |pg||
nt|daman: Roland took it on the chin recently   I had a lot of Flanneryites with me when commentating|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E cashed 2 last tricks|pg||
nt|stc: very important match between 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@S will be ,made if declared|pg||
nt|chick: probably a support double showing 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: making |pg||
nt|karesz:  did you bid 3 NT by N?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: killing lead|pg||
nt|karesz:  yes!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No never! 3@h for me|pg||
nt|taliga: so N decision of bidding 4@s immediately is a bit strange for me|pg||
nt|rodal f: Luckely no X.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfj: thx|pg||
nt|gulyas: weird lead|pg||
nt|passell: yes  very aggressive against this bidding|pg||
nt|bessi2: I like it.. his prospects with jx in @s aren't very exciting|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I would probably have lead a @c myself... a @h is out of the question in my view|pg||
nt|passell: I also like a club|pg||
nt|passell: diamond in a way makes the defense fool proof|pg||
nt|roswolf: going for the throat|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 76 e/w in the other room bid and made 3nt for a 7 imp pickup|pg||
nt|granguru: frederic in fact.|pg||
nt|granguru:  it will not|pg||
nt|tez: 3@s normal|pg||
nt|granguru:  y|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  do you often play game after opps 1NT strong opening?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i fancy defence here|pg||
nt|puncher99: low diam off table south should play king|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Pekka Viitasalo|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  well this is a close deal|pg||
nt|sybarra: this X may not work out well|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ben Thompson|pg||
nt|benjent: Hi everybody|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day ben|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: sorry -- we had some difficulties setting up but should be good to go now -- welcome all|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi|pg||
nt|puncher99: south is wondering who has spade k|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with max 14 points on opener.....|pg||
nt|granguru:  double fit permits it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, but you have to discover it|pg||
nt|vbman: souths royals are extremely useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: yes, cannot go wrong now|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 8 tricks here...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: might make 3 on the same lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  no entry to dummy though...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|puncher99: or how to untangle suit if pard has it|pg||
nt|bagman: S should play the Q in most cases (except when the lead is singleton)|pg||
nt|taliga: son only 200 :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, declarer gets an easy life|pg||
nt|granguru:  as nobody knows nothing about @cs  N shoud pass|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  whoa|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|frankaus: very fine bid by Hampson|pg||
nt|roswolf: about to have some with my dinner|pg||
nt|taliga: so|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E finds @c lead, even Fantoni will be hopeless|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|gulyas: on a @C lead, a @D return looks natural, and E has to find the @H switch|pg||
nt|passell: after a club lead west should return a trump to make things easier for partner later in the hand|pg||
nt|karesz:  wow!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S could be hardly blamed for spade opening lead - but if one respects the opps, (s)he makes imagi nation working|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This board confirms, that you should have better suit quality for 2 @S - the @C-lead would have been better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, if 1@s bid doesn't show spades, this lead seems normal, but still, declarer has a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|tez: @d lead normal:)|pg||
nt|stc: NS happy with a + score|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: bd 16 they did pass 2@Hx, collecting the mentioned 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the @S may easily block but declarer runs out of tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: He just needs to see what developes after that|pg||
nt|puncher99: now is the key play|pg||
nt|bagman: N can duck also, I think, if S plays low|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a little help from my friends.....|pg||
nt|granguru:  E 4@D helps to understand the greater grade of fitness between the NS hands...|pg||
nt|granguru:  but Is there streght enough?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
pc|h3|nt|viren169: and probably a flat bd|pg||
nt|chick: so they have done well to stop in 3, we'll see if the other table can also|pg||
nt|stc: declarer will be happy to make only 3|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|passell: the contract on the 1st hand was indeed 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 12 to Diamond, taking the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes playing on diamonds brings home the bacon|pg||
nt|daman: this is a lot different lead than the @C Ace and King|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he cashes @H's might come home now in ruffing mode |pg||
pc|c2|nt|puncher99: its easier to cover the j then to play the king with low one led|pg||
nt|chick: a threatening lead, but 8 tricks off the top now|pg||
nt|granguru: is ranked 3454 and has 6 MPs ...partner in not registered yet. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bagman: N cashes the spade and switches according to S's suit preference|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  hello Henry|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Henry |pg||
nt|henryb:  Gm all|pg||
nt|sybarra: in tempo low ht may put declarer to the test |pg||
pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  good move! W may be afraid of leading @c now|pg||
nt|vbman: l think its auto now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's really hard for defenders, to find right swith at the earlier stage|pg||
nt|stc: 2 key cards of three are offside|pg||
nt|chick: wow, underlead the @DA for a hoped club ruff|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|vbman: he will play a cl|pg||
nt|tez: i agree with all bidding|pg||
nt|granguru:  S must now increase his hand value as @H and @C are of greater value|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bagman: If heart, declarer wins that, plays the @DA and and later pushes the @CQ thru south|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a series of avoidance type plays|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much for Diamond to play, but the cards are very friendly and he' s very likely to make the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: a very quiet bd in the other room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: only a d causes any problem|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now -2 |pg||
pc|d8|nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen:  "Everything is working - running out of finesses"|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: agree pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: When S starts thinking, Diamonds hopes get up|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he only needs the @DK to drop :) (so that he can get back to dummy to cash his namesakes)|pg||
nt|puncher99: hand much harder to  play if diam K was played at trk3|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H as a good raise or ask for @H hold a better bid. At least a stop in 3@S|pg||
nt|daman: this is a strange way to play it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E sold red two-suiter and spade stopper, so he's short in @c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now @c danger persuades declarer to play @h form top dropping the Q|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
pc|cK|nt|granguru: Frederic started to play for sweden in 1984 at the 9th youth european championship in Hasselt|pg||
pc|cT|nt|benjent: Faith in his partner - expecting a chunky hand at vul vs not|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  but, as a lot of kibs suggested, what should W do, if he's going to beat the contract|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bagman: Making an overtrick in the endgame|pg||
nt|roswolf: is west really thinking?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s4|pc|h6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well played.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tez: defence must be carefull now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well defended|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hK|nt|chick: making himself an entry to finesse hearts|pg||
nt|chick: with the @DA underlead, W may still not know where it is, and probably feels endplayed right now|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now @H is safe if it was 4-2|pg||
nt|granguru: he used to play with Martin de Kneiff. Sylvan is a replacement althought they have played together a lot of times|pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: He might have gone down on a @C lead and continuation|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|tez: q of @c now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vbman: needs q to play|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as predicted, EW gained 10 imps in  1 - next door 3NT went 1 down|pg||

nt|bagman: The EW slam is on a finesse and 31/22 break; it's under 50% and should not be bid|pg||

nt|vugraphzge: against a nice discussion between Elinescu and Wladow at the table :)|pg||
nt|stc: NS may make 2@h|pg||
nt|chick: heart was the right choice, since he knows the @HQ was finessable anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: a misfit but NT loks best|pg||
nt|granguru:  There is no link to CC's|pg||
nt|baldfriede: slam on a non-working finesse here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I have seen ppl open 4@H on such a hand in this vul:)|pg||
nt|passell: yes  young and bold ones|pg||
nt|passell: or old and desperate ones|pg||
nt|bessi2: west's hand is pretty vulnerable.. I would simply raise to 4@h giving up on slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Tough position for NS in the auction, and they'll be worried about the double-game swing out|pg||
nt|roswolf: lead changes hands again|pg||
nt|sybarra: just the bid N wanted to hear |pg||
nt|jbgood: they (Sylvan and Wrang) just finished the Nordic Ch.ship - came 2nd 1 vp behind Norway and 1 vp before Iceland|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing polish club|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I am a commentator|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Hi Ian, welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html  running scores|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  looks like a @S partial|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1st from both groups after this round qualify for the finals later today|pg||
mb|3D|nt|passell: yes if you think what partner needs for slam|pg||
nt|frankaus: Greco had 7 losers  - i would expect 6 |pg||
nt|rodal f: Some ffun to come? A hard slam but EW need it.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gulyas: disaster struck again on bd17|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  does it make sense? I know the answer, not so NS, it seems.|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s in NS is an interesting try !|pg||
nt|chick: 1@H transfer to spades?|pg||
nt|stc: probably|pg||
nt|stc: in 4@s if defense starts with @cs you can crossruff to 10 tricks, if not you can establish @ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: friday night dinner with ketchup?:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats a strong 2 - what system|pg||
nt|tomi2: I am not sure what system is on now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT - doÂ´nt care about a @S-stopper|pg||
nt|tomi2: north's 1@C is natural if they play natural in that seat or the strong 1@C if they play strong club or he mixed it up|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H MUST be played by South|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: in non-vulnerable, 1@c is 15+|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the only outcome of all the discussion at the table is one and the same all the time: partner becomes angry, but not aware (or awake).|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Lukas|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW got into the auction, but played their worst suit, going for 500 in 4@Dx|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11H IS CONTRO;S?OR A TRANSFER?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may get passed |pg||
nt|daman: I always bid my six card major rather than my 4 card minor in this sequence|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, thx|pg||
nt|granguru:  nothing strange  indeed|pg||
nt|tez: NS/And EW|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@H shld be avoided, not easy when east goes on|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think a partial is the limit|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at MP North might balance but now... |pg||
nt|chick: I wonder about a club lead and trump switch, will that stop 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: EW likely to end in 3NT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|puncher99: shows spades|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that 1@H was positive balanced|pg||
nt|viren169: anothe dble by greco?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Why wouldn't N double 1@s? even at imps?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: iam told 8-11, no 5@S|pg||
nt|motu: 3@S is KCB for S|pg||
nt|motu: hi all :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ns in trbl|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I don't think 3-3 @s will play nicely|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bessi2: a trump lead seems safe from west's point of view|pg||
nt|passell: yes when they had a make in 4clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: But it's down by a @C ruff.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Martin|pg||
nt|motu: 4@H 2+@HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: thats reversed to Martens' idea to play strong club non-vuln but natural vuln when your opps are more likely to preempt you after 1@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hallÃ¶chen|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: hi Martin, welcome!|pg||
nt|tomi2: all contracts possible now in this partnership, 4@H, 6@H or 7@H|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i think it is a great contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  partner is a passed hand|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bessi2: it could be disastrous of course but not on this deal|pg||
nt|rodal f: NT they will not find, but there are 12 by the layout.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now the club suit in play|pg||
nt|henryb:  so?|pg||
nt|othered1: preempt simply eliminated the room EW needed to discover that they had a play for slam.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|viren169: 2n=leb or scramble I guess|pg||
nt|imp_jan: escape|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chessmaste: Least dangerous perhaps - and I would rather underlead one of my aces than try a diamond|pg||
nt|bessi2: @d 7 is also a very normal lead imo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As I allready mentioned: 3 NT is often good|pg||
nt|imp_jan: very dangerous to dbl by north opposite a passed hand and east who is still unlimited|pg||
nt|ianmcc: it might now induce a bad lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: Didn't find there best major but not unnatural endstation.|pg||
nt|daman: my 6 card suit needs to have texture though|pg||
nt|sybarra: you certainly "live" in the ht suit in this hand |pg||
nt|daman: if this hand makes....look for a star in the East|pg||
nt|daman: or poor defenders|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like leb|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive many would bid 4@H at Es first bid. Is the best by long term. Then slam is off for W here.|pg||
nt|motu: 4S ask for kings 5@D= @DK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: normal contract|pg||
nt|viren169: this is destined to go 1 down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 9 rather easy tricks|pg||
nt|vbman: needs a somehow fantastic cl play?|pg||
nt|vbman: dbl finesse is the percentage|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  anyway the NS interference lured EW into a law violation|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3-over-3 with 16 trumps|pg||
nt|henryb:  It's much safer to double 1@s than 2@s|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|chessmaste: Read more|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now 10|pg||
nt|karesz:  weak two 2 @S it is funny for me |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|passell: there is merit on that hand in bidding 4clubs  as partner can still convert to 4diamonds if he is 5-4 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe E should have bid a scrambling 3NT, not sure if they have that available in that situation tho:)|pg||
nt|tez: 1 down i think|pg||
pc|s8|nt|benjent: killing the @h trick, hoping for a promotion|pg||
nt|benjent: In practice, Wolpert can now pick up the trumps, although he may not|pg||
nt|benjent: The cross-ruff is going to be a lot more appealing|pg||
nt|viren169: with 2@S likely to make another flatish bd|pg||
nt|hawe45:  N/S are right, when 4 @H is no winner, try something else|pg||
nt|tez: only 1 time end play for west|pg||
pc|s5|nt|taliga: Declarer can guess every card (after the bidding), and still it will not be enough|pg||
nt|taliga: 2 spades, 1 diamond, and a heart he sees going to the wrong way - at least|pg||
nt|stc: on @s switch you establish @d|pg||
nt|chick: I don't like the preempt myself, 6-5 hands are too good.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bessi2: I totally agree with there being merit in bidding 4@c on that last hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: more than just merit even|pg||
nt|daman: given the terrible distribution     it might take a bit longer to play this hand than usual|pg||
nt|jcomyn: obviously meant to be weak but hopw can that be a weak 2|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but still doubling 1@S can go horribly wrong, if East has a support Rdbl|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|passell: the modern way of thing bidding diamonds over clubs at any level is conversion  not extra values|pg||
nt|roswolf: must lose the 2 black aces|pg||
nt|henryb:  since 3@c can be made and 3@s is likely to make or be down 1, |pg||

nt|bagman: N was not prepared to bid and then hear a jump canape |pg||
nt|athene: interesting view from east here - you might think about balancing, but if opps play canapé, it's more likely they are in a bad spot with a good fit elsewhere|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bagman: canape = showing longer suit on the 2nd bid|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||

nt|henryb:  declarer should guess clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Another dull looking deal|pg||
nt|benjent: Several ways to approach the East hand. I like Hampson's choice (and I'm sure he'll be relieved to hear that :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D i expect from Hamson - traffic lights are green|pg||
nt|benjent: I don't - he's made his choice with 3@h. I expect he'll hope he's done the damage already|pg||

nt|gulyas: I was trying to be nice:)|pg||

nt|granguru: obviously E is considering alternatives|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes jon but why would E suspect his partner held 4h unless part of system|pg||

nt|tomi2: 3nt wrongsided over there in 2, another swing for Turkey|pg||
nt|vbman: some ask what sd ns pair do after that 1st board?|pg||
nt|vbman: my answer is players at this level have already forgotten that|pg||
nt|granguru:  but a @S lead defeats it|pg||
nt|stc: is it ? NS will play a game and go down on good defense|pg||
nt|granguru:  5@D depends on @D finesse but also 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Dima Nikolenkov|pg||
nt|chick: and S could have had as little as @CAKx for game in clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S-2@S would figure to buy it, if available|pg||

nt|sybarra: is this a club system?|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: they play this says he wants to bid|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak is going to overcall 3NT with worse hands than this. 3NT could easily be the last making spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: they might but imo should not|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart game more tricky|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 11-14NT for NS.|pg||

nt|ianmcc: Hi Dima|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E doubles and folds his cards:)|pg||

nt|gulyas: W obv inviting slam with this sequence|pg||
nt|psyck: W shows his slam interest by passing & pulling the x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: x was alerted, can't read it|pg||
nt|ybob: re :)|pg||
nt|viren169: a t/out dble would have been more interesting!|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 106 is correct|pg||
nt|jtmckee: sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i don't have it anymore|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3@S limit in hearts with spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, 4th place it's 12-14:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and othervise too they should have a 5+crd suit to bid 1nt with 11p|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 nt a bid strange (imo)|pg||
nt|daman: 1@D seems wet|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h|pg||
nt|chick: probably not, the @SK became worthless|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: The open room is playing board 65 so we'll be live soon|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 nt keeps n/s out of spade contact |pg||
nt|chick: no reason to expect anywhere near this much from his partner|pg||
nt|granguru: and E was considering doubling  or bidding 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: i think so too, but its not clear, screens are here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not the best lead|pg||
nt|granguru: after the lead a success for Netherlands|pg||
nt|hawe45:  :)|pg||
nt|stc: and in both contract EW must lead @s to bea|pg||
nt|stc: t|pg||
nt|stc: even 2@h seems down|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sommer: I just had a nice tenderloin with new potatoes..no ketchup:)|pg||
nt|ybob: E-W can win 3NT |pg||
nt|jtmckee: 4 s can be beat with a d tap|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Could I ask? Was the double of 2 @H alerted - maybe by North himself?|pg||
nt|tomi2: Germany set 6@h doubled|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but N has 2 4-cards majors...|pg||
nt|vbman: l think h royal will give 9|pg||
nt|stc: EW mist be cartefull not to block @s, -1 or -2|pg||
nt|granguru:  must be a tied hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: everyone very active|pg||
nt|dima:  Looks like Khokhlov-Matushko use transfer responces to 1@c - that is X was 4+ @h|pg||
nt|imp_jan: here again a pre-bal dbl with 3@S only|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bessi2: did that actually happen ?|pg||
nt|gulyas: x probably just showing minimum|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure east would have accepted with @dk instead of @c Q so this was a very good decision by diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm 4@H needs care|pg||
nt|rodal f: 11 or 12 tricks? 11. Next|pg||
nt|othered1: Nor I, but I know competent players who would enter, perhaps making NS pay the price for playing "constructive raises"|pg||
pc|s3|nt|caitlin: which one Jay?|pg||
nt|karesz:  1 @s balanced 8-12|pg||
nt|sybarra: wouldnt you compete to 3 @D |pg||
nt|stc: @s,@d, 2@c,2@h|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chessmaste: Well I don't think much of the second double, but E/W should emerge with a plus|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 3   I am informed that if South rebid 2@H, North would bid game since it shows a better hand.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: -3oo now|pg||
nt|vbman: ns play a home brewed artificial|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bagman: Now the @DA and a low back|pg||
nt|viren169: spade lead may defeat 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: not sure if duck first trick|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bessi2: I must confess that I would have blackwooded in a heartbeat|pg||
nt|passell: good 6nt on the bidding|pg||
nt|ybob: or second trick too|pg||
nt|vbman: their one level openings is forciing|pg||
nt|imp_jan: decl bound to lose 2@h and 2@c and at least 1 trump|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this should fail but I should stop predicting|pg||
nt|dima:  first blood to Russia defeating 4@s in the OR on N1|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: he can play low, he is in 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you paly that the cuebid promises 3 spades the west should bid 3@S over 3@H to suggest a poor quality @H suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: same auction in other room|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can see two probable heart losers; he cannot afford not to finesse|pg||
nt|puncher99: 3n was cold|pg||
nt|jtmckee: so good result for n-s|pg||
nt|karesz:  3 @d show distribution 3-4-2-4|pg||
nt|karesz:  @h is the best lead, but decl has 9 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|daman: NS play a 2M opening as constructive.|pg||
nt|udo: after @H lead, they have to find early @C switch ?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|frankaus: marked @C possition 3 @S 5@C 3@D 1@H|pg||
nt|jtmckee: this one|pg||
nt|karesz:  Szegedi is not the fastes player of the World|pg||
nt|karesz:  nor is CsehÃ³|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: by north maybe, but i was at the other screen side|pg||
nt|vbman: some ask what is this system?|pg||
nt|vbman: dont forget this ns pair have won a dozen of world titles with it|pg||
nt|udo: as far as i remember this system 1 @D was a transfer to @H ??|pg||
nt|tez: i thk q of @s better than king|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ybob: win and @D ...|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed... seems to be by far the safest line|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @HA|pg||
nt|taliga: y|pg||
nt|vbman: 0-9 4+hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks simply to be overbid|pg||
nt|vbman: somedays u r unlucky somedays opps are lucky , somedays both|pg||
nt|vbman: one down is ok|pg||
nt|udo: 3NT diff to beat,,,,,,4@H much easier:))|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N looks like it will fail, even on @H lead, if west finds @C shift |pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,,,,3NT needs @C switch after @H lead|pg||
nt|vbman: as long as there are cards to play any funny thing can happen|pg||
nt|othered1: sure|pg||
nt|othered1: Any thoughts on what north is considering?|pg||
nt|udo: the slow 4 @H ?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: maybe east is asking about the auction...|pg||
nt|imp_jan: still not sure how 4@H was made on previous hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|passell: good sing 10 of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wb Mike|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 106 made|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 106 was mistake|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR     North/South ended up in 3@H   -1|pg||
nt|granguru: 8 possible swing IMPs|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  sorry it seems we have an Italian waiter in Germany ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: challenge here is the 4/1 trump break and even that is manageable |pg||
pc|hK|nt|passell: making 6 is easier in 5  than in 6|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day mike|pg||
nt|tomi2: 30 imps on 3 boards, I promised some action bridge - here we are :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even 6 @H RD in board 3 would have gained a lot...|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: sorry, we had connection problems here in Bonn :(|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chessmaste: Covering was a mistake I fear|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes,  and in a spot where playing low was pretty standard|pg||
nt|vbman: re hi i mean|pg||
nt|udo: wlcome back,,,so 4@H it is|pg||
nt|vbman: ns must be sensing theyre some behind|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  someone tripping over the cable|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|gulyas: indeed|pg||
nt|bagman: S probably holds at least one of the high hearts|pg||
nt|vbman: but cards look tame|pg||
nt|ianmcc: needs an inquest|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: sneaky|pg||
nt|rodal f: New @H and 8|pg||
nt|chick: and 2N :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|granguru: yes -3oo reflects better the result than -300|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tez: or small for sure|pg||
nt|granguru:  !@SQ probably asks to throw @SJ|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|viren169: with the @cs breaking 3@D looks like 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ianmcc: why pop @dA?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: looking at the rankings some pre-tournament favorite teams do perform quite disappointing like monaco (last in A) and Germany 7th in B|pg||
nt|imp_jan: may be suggesting AJ-4th :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|imp_jan: no|pg||
nt|imp_jan: played back a diamnond..|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bessi2: I can't get over the bidding.. let alone west's second dbl which is bad imo, but east sitting in the dbl is beyond my understanding|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bagman: I think that the low heart was an illusory safety play|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|puncher99: run the spades now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: the contract is cold|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bagman: Now declarer needs all three spades and a club to live|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is this ridiculous pace normal for these teams|pg||
nt|vbman: what a miracle can conjure up 10 tricks?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ybob: only @H lead from N defeat 3NT|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|granguru:  as you would like with @SKQ109x|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psyck: some invert the meanings of pass & double in forcing pass situations|pg||
nt|chick: well, bridge is a game in which you are Supposed to think :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chessmaste: He can overruff and claim after drawing the trump|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bagman: Now three spades and then more spades|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  well done|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ianmcc: just swapped losers, still -1|pg||
nt|imp_jan: this way jansma get rid of a club loser on the 4th spade and took an extra chance finding @SQ-dblton|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the uptrick |pg||
nt|vugraphzge: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html running scores|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That type of result is bad for morale|pg||
nt|bessi2: I still can hardly believe that just happened|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|bagman: standard end game position; N is helpless|pg||
pc|d8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: another swing to diamond|pg||
nt|chick: I always liked constructive raises, but gave them up for the exact reason you say ... I wonder if reversing the meaning would make them work ... 1@S 2@S weakest|pg||

nt|daman: Hey John|pg||
nt|granguru: gm|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT should be an easy task - especially after a @S-bid from South|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North has NO weak 2 in @H|pg||
nt|imp_jan: lucky 4@S|pg||
nt|stc: This one could be interesting|pg||
nt|chick: 4@S likely -1|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|karesz:  12-16 balanced, if 16 no 4-card major|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes cornelia but if i played at that pace i would fall asleep|pg||
mb|2N|nt|passell: just more random quiet hands here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be uncomfortable|pg||
nt|jtmckee: makes 5d n-s|pg||
nt|taliga: precision style bidding comes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Funny cards but only partscore as the best. EW in @H for 9|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hard to bid though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  NS likely to play a strong @C system|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @H opener |pg||
nt|stc: If W plays in @s N is endplayed from the elad :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|frankaus: 3nt looks likely here|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl seems natural|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: again, 2@C = 11-15, 6@C or 5+ with a major|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok ,  club system apparently |pg||
nt|vbman: sry for net inconvenience|pg||
nt|othered1: does 2@H show a 2-suiter or is it just a stab at a weak 2?|pg||
nt|chick: don't know, but if normal weak 2, is bad choice in first seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 1H pass 2@H pass pass pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: was not doubvled need to correct|pg||
nt|benjent: NS are going to have to tread carefully here|pg||
nt|bagman: A bit untypical weak two with void, 4 controls and just a so-so suit; in strong club context 1@H could be considered|pg||
nt|ybob: 140 here|pg||
nt|viren169: best to pass with a mis-fit|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5@D|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow he passed|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  most common system in Austria is Blue Team @C|pg||
mb|3N|nt|karesz:  a lot of tricks now|pg||
nt|jbgood: dbl now by Wrang|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@H both majors|pg||
nt|granguru: sorry 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 1@h 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c openings 12+ or any strong hands|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this gives a chance|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yes|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S almost has to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s should make|pg||
nt|stc: Now big numbers are possible|pg||
nt|chick: but E has shown a weak hand and W may not feel like pushing|pg||
nt|chick: I would have bid 1@H over 1@C with East's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told it's 5+@H, 5 other|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 2@h: 5M + 5(4)m, 6-10|pg||
nt|chick: makes better sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: yes 3nt very likely|pg||
nt|passell: maybe 4nt|pg||
nt|benjent: 2@s was GF, but Kranyak will still feel he has plenty in reserve|pg||
nt|passell: very difficult for Kran to pass here|pg||
nt|benjent: Yeah, easy 4@c bid|pg||
nt|daman: he will try 3@D for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm,  we will need some assistance on the bidding (or at least I will)|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@H is strong with @Hs or 12-14 HP|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 NT - must be a joke...|pg||
nt|stc: 8 or 9 NT tricks|pg||
nt|imp_jan: migth bid it now due to the dbl fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  apparently not|pg||
nt|chick: partner unpassed, could have enough for game or even more|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Oh well|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump switch?|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed pekka|pg||
nt|ybob: 11 now|pg||
nt|viren169: defense need to be quick to hold it to 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|viren169: but not on that lead!|pg||
nt|stc: NS must open @d early to take 5 tricks|pg||
nt|imp_jan: still not easy for south|pg||
nt|dima:  transfer to 4@s :)?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3@s obviously forcing because I get to play it|pg||
nt|imp_jan: he doesnt knwo about the club fit|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  only if it makes :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|passell: maybe he will pass 4nt  very difficult|pg||
nt|daman: oh   sorry|pg||
nt|granguru: now comes ALL PASS|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: yes, now it is 12-14 balanced, because of 2@h|pg||
nt|stc: wd|pg||
nt|tez: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2@D was a transfer|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: I like 4@h ... if Wolpert gets the message. His intention is clearly to say "excellent @c's, @h control, bit worried about them there @d's"|pg||
nt|passell: no more plus score available dont see a 10th trick in nt|pg||
nt|benjent: But without explicit suit agreement, this is the kind of auction that can descend into a series of cue-or-signoffs very quickly|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like the same 11 tricks as the OR|pg||
nt|ybob: not sure if he play to 11, K@D @S to  k@S and low @C ?|pg||
nt|granguru: interesting transfer made by the strong hand|pg||
nt|granguru: "strong"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  My grandmother would have bid 3 NT|pg||
nt|imp_jan: that's what i mean..|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no again|pg||
nt|sybarra: less pressure if white maybe|pg||
nt|stc: 3NT, even not Xed are morev than game|pg||
nt|chick: West is going to be thrilled with East's hand|pg||
nt|stc: N doing too much|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bessi2: 2@h will make easily enough|pg||
nt|passell: with the normal dia lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a little bit passive from W in my opinion|pg||
nt|rodal f: They don't use controls at the answering hand I see.|pg||
nt|daman: on this side of the pond the auction would go.....1@S - 1NT - 2@C - 3@C - all pass|pg||
nt|granguru: probably passable if p is weak long in @D|pg||
nt|dima:  Did someone figure out how to make 4@h on N3?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 10 tricks on 2 finesses plus|pg||
nt|imp_jan: play in movie stops half way on brd 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: because he claimed...|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: but i dont have heard his description exactly...|pg||
nt|chick: Yes, but remember the opps preempted and passed respectively|pg||
nt|chick: N has reason to expect more from partner than he actually has|pg||
nt|othered1: double may not be a success here|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer has lots of decisions to make, however and must go right in the minors to scorre 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: They'll be lucky to escape a X now|pg||
nt|passell: the dbl is about to begin|pg||
nt|passell: I predict 6nt dbl down 2|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Hamson will X 6@C|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert's cheapest action now is the impossible pass :)|pg||
nt|passell: or 6nt|pg||
nt|passell: dont like forcing to slam  too likely partner has a stiff club|pg||
nt|taliga: no, it became quite natural|pg||
nt|sybarra: if pard (N) has the long diamond hand and bids 2 @D, you pass and wish him luck |pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully arriving undoubled|pg||
nt|motu: in my opinon it depends on how they play the 2@D bid|pg||
nt|dima:  That is the way to make game :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: The 5-1 trump break will annoy declarer, but the contract is in no danger |pg||
nt|chick: 3N won't be easy ... can pick up the clubs with careful play but any heart will let E put a second spade thru the J|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: would bid this way with the Q of clubs |pg||
nt|frankaus: no X  :)|pg||
nt|benjent: And with the Red preempt, likely that @c aren't breaking kindly|pg||
nt|passell: yes |pg||
nt|passell: he may be thinking of 6nt to protect ruffs and the dia Q|pg||
nt|passell: seems like he should  now the dbl will come|pg||
nt|granguru: this contract will probably go -1|pg||
nt|granguru: 3 rounds of @Cs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  defence has no way to prevent declarer from 7th trick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|karesz:  against a 15-17 NT W will have invitation hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 points and a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|karesz:  or gameforcing:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-treatment will be interesting -maybe|pg||
nt|henryb:  Some other day both South's red queens will be working|pg||
pc|s2|nt|passell: oops|pg||
nt|passell: dbl for sure|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer has 2 spades, diamond and 4 hearts going one down against a careful defense|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Wladows lead killed an antry|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The winning line is not so far, @D to the 10 and right @C-guess|pg||
nt|chick: North's heart is heavy when he sees this dummy in E|pg||
pc|sT|nt|granguru: declarer will go on a cross ruff process as much as defense permits him|pg||
nt|udo: this lead helps declarer to get his 7th trick|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|passell: down 1 likely now|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3-1-1-1 tricks, cannot see anything else|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is likely to come up short|pg||
nt|rodal f: Understand W for take the safe sac, but unlucky this time.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the double finesse in hearts makes 10 - di shift good|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|benjent: The problem with 6NT is that you may actually be exposing the @dQ rather than protecting it. The red pre-empter could easily have @dK given your @h strength (and partner's @h ...|pg||
nt|benjent: stopper to boot)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: not by leading clubs    he would have been better off to lead a low @S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  4 spades, 2 diamonds and...|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  well if you play a strong @C and opps preempt - bound to have some guesses|pg||

pc|h3|nt|jtmckee: so down 2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|passell: double dummy can duck a club and squeeze north|pg||
nt|passell: yes  true  but protecting the ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence are now in control|pg||
nt|granguru: I think the idea of a transfer with a second suit is that it is very likely that partner holds a 6 cards suit. if not they can play in a 5-2 or 5-1 trump suit |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 1|pg||
nt|stc: very good @d play from N, now he can beat|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|daman: On board 4 in the OR   North/South were one down in 3@S    5 Imps to England|pg||
pc|s3|nt|granguru: I am wondering how many times @CJ discard might give declarer a trick...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gulyas: 2@S made in the other room, so 5 back to Deutsch|pg||
nt|granguru: Moysean fits are recommended on special instances...|pg||
nt|daman: when they make :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|chick: now his best hope is the club finesse, which fails|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer hasn't selected a winning line here.  I wonder if @C played low to ace and low back wouldn't have been better|pg||
nt|chick: (or dropping the now-singleton @HJ, which also fails)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

pc|h8|nt|granguru: strenght for game but no chances for 3NT or 5 in a minor singletons or void in the shorter hand|pg||

pc|h5|pc|c3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
mc|9|nt|othered1: @C toQ then ace is fine as cards lie but if north was playing for @C lelngth in east -- else why the @CJ? -- other play will do as well, since auction has marked @HA|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|tez: fucik bid 2 nt|pg||
nt|athene: but if you double there you are saying they landed in your suit so i guess they are going to run if they possibly can :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|tez: imposible singleton @h in this squence..|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|tez: if inv. why 3 nt with this hand?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||

nt|frankaus: another interesting lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: break|pg||
nt|roswolf: good result for diamond in the other room|pg||
nt|bagman: A partscore hand which probably belongs to NS. EW can take 6 tricks in NT in defense|pg||
nt|bagman: The nice lie of the red suits gives declarer 3 hearts and 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|granguru: I am informed that if opener retransfers to @S (bidding 2@H) he shows a 6 card spade suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and complaints re the system, its just often that a system does not cover every hand |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT EW here probably|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  may depend on NT range|pg||
nt|henryb:  Gold will get to play it. E-W play Acol|pg||
nt|chick: Thank you, Lukas :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: The system of Cohen-Smith was not available on the USBF web site; anybody know what they play?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 16+|pg||
nt|tez: 4@s ok for me|pg||
nt|tez: you?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@H 1N 2N 3N?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Vugraphzfj: yes|pg||
nt|jtmckee: bet he feels bad|pg||
nt|jtmckee: his dad would not be happy at ducking the setting trick|pg||
nt|caitlin: @Cs hadn't been played|pg||
nt|karesz:  16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I am not a big fan of south's pass here|pg||
nt|bagman: The club J is also onside so declarer can make 2 club tricks and come to 7 with 3 hearts, 2 clubs and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT? Major or a color?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 6c possibility|pg||
nt|nezihk: slm|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|nezihk: hi|pg||
nt|udo: @S slam not far away here,,,,,,,,,but Q fo @S is not where she should be:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  a personal query..please if anybody saved hand 7 from the first session please send me a copy for GIB analysis..tks a lot|pg||
nt|tez: 5@s i belive now|pg||
nt|tez: or 5@h|pg||
nt|granguru:  5@S X|pg||
nt|stc: good decision by W, not easy at this vuln|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: really 1@D by east!?|pg||
nt|bagman: The latter line probably needs some entry help from the defense|pg||
nt|chick: 6@H also makes, but not 6N on a @D lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: 2/1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they try 4@S since they're at vul?|pg||
nt|rodal f: An interesting point can come in @S, but max 9 it seems|pg||
nt|taliga: I guess E compensated a bit his original pass... :)|pg||
nt|taliga: after a diamond lead both black kings will take a trick|pg||
mb|r|an|3!h's|nt|bessi2: it has its advantages surely.. but definately not my style|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I would open - 2@S weak, or 2@D Multi,or 2@S spades and a minor|pg||
nt|frankaus: did wolpert bid @H opp?|pg||
nt|karesz:  balanced 8-10 i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: So E have got a warning and can find best spot. 3NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even that is hard since u need to find @CJ|pg||
nt|othered1: Redouble 3-card @H support?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|frankaus: will it end in 4@H?|pg||
nt|taliga: if S passes... :)|pg||
nt|granguru: bakhshi explains that 2@S would show @S AND @c ..pretty interesting|pg||
nt|tomi2: interesting board to have an agreement about passes in this seat - either "i would have passed 1@Cx" or "no preferance"|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S in trouble|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  maybe Acol is just Gold + Townsend?|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: yes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bessi2: I  like upgrading this south hand to a 2N opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am a big fan of rebidding 1NT with unbal hands that are short in pd's major, but it backfires when you cannot bid 2M with a mangy 5c suit, frearing a singleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: yes, as i know it|pg||
nt|jtmckee: seems cold at first glance|pg||
nt|jtmckee: this one seems cold at first glance|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3@C mixed raise in @Ds|pg||
nt|karesz:  relay|pg||
nt|karesz:  2 @d 4-crad @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: EW will probably bid 3nt on this board. A not so good 3nt as previous|pg||
nt|karesz:  and a 4-card minor|pg||
nt|tez: why dbl i dont understand this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I am not sure if this is % bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah more understandable|pg||
nt|jtmckee: best lead|pg||
nt|caitlin: and ofte singleton trump not good lead|pg||
nt|vbman: even a lead from dia j gives only 11|pg||
nt|tez: it is not forcing pass squence |pg||
nt|stc: not best lead....|pg||
nt|stc: now +1|pg||
nt|dima:  Georgi Matushko has no fear :)|pg||
nt|dima:  I gather Jansma Paulissen play negative free bids, that is 2@h is nonforcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: did Gold "take a view?"|pg||
nt|henryb:  No - they play 2/1. Acol is Teltscher, or at least was yesterday when playing with Silverstone|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: good point, that is my style too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So 3@H is stronger than 4 as 2@H was GF|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the defense can take 6 tricks: 3 hearts 2 diamonds and a club to beat |pg||
nt|caitlin: often|pg||
nt|jtmckee: will have to husband his entrys|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Tkx Daniel:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this seems a fair slam|pg||
nt|puncher99: trump lead beats it 2 trks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  may well rich it - bunch of points, all the aces and 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,,,,could even be a push in 6@S -1|pg||
nt|ianmcc: East will lead a @c which helps|pg||
nt|chick: a club splinter shouldn't excite N very much, since now his club honors are worthless|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ybob: probably 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can only see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|taliga: S had his problem, because they overcall very agressively, so it was very probable from his point of view, that at these colours 5@d would be good|pg||
nt|taliga: I always lose a g. Aggressively. :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well on the way now|pg||
nt|jbgood: running scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html|pg||
nt|vbman: what s wrong with 1 nt opener , weak originally?|pg||
nt|stc: 12 tricks here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: The heart slam requires the trumps to behave|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Smith actually held up 1 finger for 5@d, guess it's clear from the auction he doesn't have 4 keycards :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have thankfully missed the 4-4 @Cfit|pg||
nt|bagman: NT slam has extra chances in clubs|pg||
nt|sommer:  There's a short version here...maybe ...   http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=711&pid=278|pg||
nt|bagman: This requires the heart switch in trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may be difficult to find|pg||
nt|bagman: otherwise E might be able to discard a heart and ruff a heart in dummy|pg||
nt|karesz:  against @s lead|pg||
nt|granguru: here South could have done so, considering the weakness of the @H suit. then 3@C wouls have been reached...|pg||
nt|daman: the @S 10 would have been double dummy   a "surround" lead|pg||
nt|vbman: a timely splinter may save them|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in a team game of this level, push in 6@s -1 is more expectable than a swing |pg||
nt|dima:  still likely to go down|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bessi2: looks like -2|pg||
nt|jtmckee: a|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normal lead might, but would prefere a @H from N|pg||
nt|granguru: I think 2NT would have been no extras...support means extras. 3@D cue |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bidding 1 @C - D - 3 NT will give you a long and healthy bridge-life|pg||
nt|henryb:  He had 16 HCP|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|frankaus: has a chance but need to get it all right|pg||
nt|granguru: 3nt shows no singleton|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chessmaste: Looks like a simple two down|pg||
nt|gulyas: 10 tricks, coffee break:)|pg||
nt|passell: good 3nt by larsen   even if partner had 3 spades he might get beat in trumps  he has so much on the outside|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|caitlin: apparently 3@C mixed raise in @C and @Ds|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@C might be RKCB|pg||
nt|chick: so 4N is 2 keycards with the @CQ, apparently no d0p1 used|pg||
nt|granguru: jansma paulissen play OPTIONAL blackwood|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 4NT shows more than minimum|pg||
nt|chick: he can pitch 2 diamonds on hearts but then has to ruff 3 clubs before drawing trump|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gulyas: I never see the point in leading a singleton in an unbid suit against notrump|pg||
nt|roswolf: not too much to the play|pg||
nt|sommer: this is a great contract|pg||
nt|bagman: The club slam is the worst requiring the clubs to be 3-2 with Q onside (or Q singleton)|pg||
nt|sommer: no..it's easy..and will be copied most places|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it needs trumps 3-2 which is not really great|pg||
nt|roswolf: acccurate wd|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now it's home but W don't know. Some time will go|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tez: if they play 5@s pass is forcing.they must be change:)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chessmaste: But declarer must attack the side suit first|pg||
nt|bessi2: if Deutch had opened 2@s, Diamond might overcall 2N which would not have been a pleasant contract to play|pg||
nt|gulyas: not that it matters here|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak's got a plausible X, but I think it has a bit to do with how his set is going as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: X ruff from here|pg||
nt|karesz:  he can win the third spade and will have 9 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: probably with a minimum he would just bid 5@C declining blackwood|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done|pg||
nt|stc: no, dummy will be high|pg||
nt|stc: after @d finesse and @d ruff|pg||
nt|chick: only if he finesses diamonds instead|pg||
nt|stc: after X from E and A@h in w looks obvious|pg||
nt|othered1: On auction, play is a bit less than picking up trumps with one loser|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: how?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@c 2@h 1@s and 3@d|pg||
nt|karesz:  N had to throw cards on diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe more than a bit|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sommer: this is around 55%|pg||
nt|taliga: d!6 was interpreted as suit preference... ?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chessmaste: Good play by declarer, avoiding 3 down|pg||
nt|jtmckee: this is going to get bloody|pg||
nt|taliga: @d6|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|s7|nt|stc: @s for 8 is better|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bagman: N is now in position to cash 5 first and see what happens then|pg||
nt|stc: discard all @d on @cs and take the @h finesse|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chessmaste: Best to continue clubs|pg||
nt|daman: as I predicted earlier    NS were in 3@C in the OR    making 4       2@H -2 here     8 IMPs to Israel|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Now he may well go 3 down|pg||
nt|benjent: Might need the @d finesse too|pg||
nt|rodal f: ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jtmckee: down 2 it appears|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  last chance to stop|pg||
nt|henryb:  Gold could have bid 1N over 1@c, but having bid 1@d, pass was certainly reasonable|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ybob: A@S and @H to 120|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bagman: Once declarer sees the dummy he wishes he's in 6NT but no problem here as hearts behave|pg||
nt|sommer: 68% minus the very bad shapes is ok to me|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: really!?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: He can throw 2@h (@hQ) if E plays 3 rounds of@d|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: New @C to come for a hook? Or drop the J?|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: what a long auction... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: I'm not sure E has so much Pass-Cards ;-)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Gerben42:  on the basis that E didnt bid 2@H|pg||

mb|2H|nt|jtmckee: dont think that happened in erd chair|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If he plays a small - either correct or doesn´t matter|pg||
nt|rodal f: 16+ again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 6d |pg||
nt|stc: the ruffing finesse in @h needs the 9x in W|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: could be trouble here...|pg||
nt|caitlin: Bathurst 275 Nickell 212|pg||
nt|jtmckee: wow what a pass by east|pg||
nt|karesz:  and now...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D trancfere?|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@S - 2@D(FG5+) 2@S 3@C 4@C etc|pg||
nt|chick: 6N would be a bit nerve-racking, needing a lot of things to go well|pg||
nt|granguru:  easy to make 3NT now|pg||
nt|stc: 3@s X is a big number|pg||
nt|dima:  some work to do, let us see whether they get there first|pg||
nt|vbman: spades is a good strain but level who knows?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bessi2: I play notrump bids here showing @s raises with all suit bids natural after a strong club opening|pg||
nt|gulyas: has to make some good guesses in 3NT|pg||
nt|ybob: another 140 to E-W, now 2@C  p p 2@H ?|pg||
nt|karesz:  zoller tried double finesse in @d at board 4!|pg||
nt|karesz:  what about North"s step now?|pg||
nt|granguru: HI|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N could have had a better situation if he first had bid 2@c |pg||
nt|taliga: Declarer needed 1 black king at South, he had to decide which one|pg||
nt|daman: here comes the axe|pg||
nt|daman: or ax|pg||
nt|daman: or cl;eaver|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Zum Netz|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H - like Tennis|pg||
nt|dima:  X is TO of hearts I guess, so after 3@c Yuri Khokhlov is going to find a bid ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|taliga: 2N promises 20-22 here, but AK973 is +1 |pg||
nt|taliga: it is 20 anyway :) I miscounted :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bessi2: n-s not on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|ybob: or X from E|pg||
nt|viren169: or P P dble|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello John|pg||
nt|vbman: 3|pg||
nt|udo: dont go away from ur normal @H play,,,and thats the 2|pg||
nt|udo: 3,,sy|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this pair will definitely handle it :) just a work|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: tough but makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D a lucky make|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to find the @CQ in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be routine , i think, but you never know|pg||
nt|karesz:  but then E culd not bid @h|pg||
nt|karesz:  could|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4C minor key-card?|pg||
nt|granguru:  6@D is hard to reach|pg||
nt|tez: 6@d is ok|pg||
nt|granguru:  lets see|pg||
nt|tez: @c ace lead:)|pg||
nt|stc: 3@sx = 1100, let's is they write more|pg||
nt|dima:  ok they do emphasize unbid major|pg||
nt|othered1: see if EW can recover from 1@D opening -- i.e., can east evaluate his @CQ as a key to slam|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: yes the layout is fairly kind to declarer|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs 5 club tricks to pitch 2 hearts; he cannot make if W has Q9xx so should guess the clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah now that makes it certain|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: easier now|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 3rd|pg||
nt|granguru: Well the double permited E to bid @H. that was the moment where NS got out of troubles (supposely)|pg||
nt|karesz:  can be this 4 @h natural?|pg||
nt|karesz:  can N believe it?|pg||
nt|granguru: what else?|pg||
nt|karesz:  cue with @c|pg||
nt|rodal f: So we say 21 for S:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: can he find the club lead?|pg||
nt|daman: automatic @C lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: think so also |pg||
nt|granguru: this is going to be made if @C are not touched fast|pg||
nt|granguru: what about 5@S?|pg||
nt|granguru: would u bid it?|pg||
nt|granguru: thrilling moment|pg||
nt|granguru: 6@S has some chances |pg||
nt|daman: I would have passed quicker and done a jig|pg||
nt|daman: partner is a passed hand    you need a lot to consider even 5@S|pg||
nt|granguru: a @C lead might bring 5@D down 3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will West find the @D-lead against 4 @S?|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@S cue accepting @D slam|pg||
nt|granguru:  now they must confirm @C control only|pg||
nt|tez: they have scereen..|pg||
nt|stc: E not so happy with the @s cuebid|pg||
nt|tez: east thinking..not north|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s hardly dynamic|pg||
nt|chick: 4@C and E can take off to slam with his singleton @S|pg||
nt|chick: arghhh, 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: he will get the @h right, cannot lose to E twice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: knew that moved but wasnt sure about the river part|pg||
nt|sommer: @DQ 3rd or 4th makes it for Fred|pg||
nt|sommer: ..in N|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like declarer needs all the diamonds. He can get them but entries are short and this might require quite accurate play|pg||
nt|viren169: East taking the low road!|pg||
nt|viren169: North will hopeful respect the bidding...|pg||
nt|ybob: if S has 6@C and pd 4333 2@H was the good bid|pg||
nt|viren169: if South had an opening they would pass...|pg||
nt|ybob: not opening but 6@C decent|pg||
nt|granguru: just @D 3-3 or @S 3-3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  he has at least 2 more choices|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both are ready for a @C-ruff|pg||
nt|tomi2: nice try to get a ruff, unlucky on this board|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @hQ - agreed suit, or @c - singleton|pg||
mb|3S|nt|passell: he should start hearts |pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that takes care of it|pg||
nt|benjent: Taken with the @c overcall, Greco will think that's a short @h lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Left to his own devices, he would like to work on the minors before drawing trumps, but that's not where he is|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping to put partner in for a heart thru|pg||
nt|vbman: by the way this makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Now one more entry to dummy helps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman: "leads are?" Smith "4th best"|pg||
nt|karesz:  no, it was natural for Hegedus|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely they will play in 6c|pg||
nt|granguru: agree|pg||
nt|tez: 6@d enuf i think:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|granguru: well it is in fact a makeable contract|pg||
nt|othered1: What's wrong with 3@H, giving partner a chance to continue to describe?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: now he only needs 1 extra trick|pg||
nt|benjent: A mid-range alternative is to draw two rounds of trumps then try @d's|pg||
nt|sybarra: S should be able to get all 3 trumps |pg||
mb|4D|nt|viren169: this wont be pretty...|pg||
nt|ybob: don´t like 2NT|pg||
nt|ybob: with xxx @S|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a pass to me...|pg||
nt|ybob: pd denies 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead|pg||
nt|chick: what's wrong with 4@C continuing to describe yourself? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|bagman: Now declarer runs the @DT|pg||
nt|taliga: no, because KQ is -1 for me :) :)|pg||
nt|daman: bold as brass|pg||
nt|daman: with the xx|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 2 in 45 minutes is Sweden vs Netherlands|pg||
nt|granguru: well the double backfired in Levit's face... lets see the playing now...|pg||
nt|stc: when you AKQ of trump you must decide...wd by W|pg||
nt|tez: ty nowas:)|pg||
nt|stc: card play not so simple|pg||
nt|tez: now need @h finesse|pg||
nt|tez: we wil see|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: oops |pg||
nt|gulyas: with 3221 for sure|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Greco will not assay the @D position after this lead|pg||
nt|passell: interesting not to lead a high club  worked well as declarer placed his partner with 1 of the top honors|pg||
nt|benjent: Drawing all the trumps then playing @d's is risky - if you get them wrong, they can play on @c's, force out West's last trump and be ready to pounce with a @d and @c trick later|pg||
nt|ybob: -100 instead  win 140|pg||
nt|rodal f: 9 tricks and next|pg||
mb|5D|nt|frankaus: wil lose just 2@D and @C|pg||
nt|benjent: Greco's still going to be in the position where he can't draw all the trumps ... so I reckon he will draw 2, and then play the @dK, hating it all the way|pg||
nt|sommer: no:)|pg||
nt|viren169: 2 light if North ducks 2 rounds of hearts...|pg||
nt|caitlin: Wolfson 200  Aker 180 or so-------Wolfson playing w Larry Cohen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with no entry on W - just give E 2 @h tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: can ruff low...to be overruffed means W has 9 @D, clearly not for  the bidding|pg||
nt|granguru: from* the bidding|pg||
nt|granguru: @HK|pg||
nt|karesz:  SSzabo had opened, so he has @cQ, no problem in the play for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first @cA/K and then @hK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: of course @cA or @cK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for a later finess ....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine never got past 4h in open room board 18|pg||
nt|granguru: how is the possible answers?|pg||
nt|vbman: no h ace first?|pg||
nt|sybarra: should he cash ht now? |pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: A good try and a good bet S holding one spade and partner 5|pg||
nt|vbman: but if finesse lost and sp back h king fly away|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and then lose 2nd @S finesse to Gold's Q :)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|granguru: careful play should N permit to win|pg||
nt|sybarra: no,  worried about the (Obvious) stiff ht) |pg||
nt|sybarra: looking JOhn,  may reconsider that |pg||
nt|chick: N is making life difficult by holding up diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: play clubs an claim|pg||
nt|stc: declarer has his 8 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Smith covered in the hope that Cohen had the 9|pg||
nt|roswolf: nae bother as a scottish friend of mine would say|pg||
nt|sommer: he will just take the @D's and play a small @H now|pg||
nt|granguru: wrong play|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: S showed his hand, after that E/W claimed :)|pg||
nt|granguru: Normally optional Blackwood permits you to answer as RKCB bypassing the trump suit wich refuses to answer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bridge is a bidderÂ´s game|pg||
nt|dima:  3@s invitational or 3@h showing 4@s with invit+ (if available) is a closer to description|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well done|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bagman: Gitelman cannot be sure that the spades really are 4-2; the lead might have been false|pg||
nt|bagman: 4-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: not very likely though|pg||
nt|sommer: so?..does a @H finesse help then?|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart finesse does not help then, that's true|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is the 9th trick:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer was taking the club finesse to the safe hand protecting the @HK|pg||
nt|taliga: the excitement is about the number of the overtricks. Again. |pg||
nt|granguru: now -1|pg||
nt|granguru: no chance now|pg||
nt|granguru: might even go -2 if he doesnt touch cards carefully|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember "we"  rewound it |pg||
nt|granguru: as now a cross ruff permits to win 7 tricks in trumps only|pg||
nt|daman: and the got 500 vs 5@D X in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: y|pg||
nt|granguru: very difficult hand|pg||
nt|daman: It will take a few minutes to play I imagine|pg||
nt|vbman: poisoning himself?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gulyas: @Ss will be cleared|pg||
nt|passell: he will now have to guess well|pg||
nt|gulyas: cash @DAK and then finesse in @Hs? has to give up a @H trick first|pg||
nt|passell: likely as long as he doesnt run clubs first|pg||
nt|karesz:  no finesse:)|pg||
nt|granguru: for minus -1 declarer must establish @H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chessmaste: A strange misunderstanding|pg||
nt|viren169: @d now|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sommer: so is the small:)..and no @C suit opened|pg||
nt|bagman: If spades are 5-2 and heart finesse works, declarer can afford to play @HQ|pg||
nt|dima:  At the other table Vadim Kholomeev - Yuri Khyuppenen seem to have very solid results|pg||
nt|vbman: l know jan fucik but never heard about this ns pair before|pg||
nt|othered1: I have to run to handle a business emergency.  Thanks everyone and bye|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jtmckee: east going to take the rest|pg||
nt|henryb:  scary: if W held up, and wins the @sQ now, declarer might take only two more tricks!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gulyas: if he does, he will see W started with 4-4 in the blacks|pg||
nt|caitlin: by East?|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 12 only|pg||
nt|jtmckee: has to take the d finess to make ten|pg||
nt|hawe45:  First score for "die Doktoren"|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Elinescu told E to give W a club ruff after @sA and laughed :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  North is a former world junior champion|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bagman: and if the @HK is with south with original 5 spades, the contract is going down anyway|pg||
nt|tez: very hard choise now|pg||
nt|tez: small @c or big|pg||
nt|stc: must play A¨h and @h finesse|pg||
nt|tez: not now may be|pg||
nt|stc: when ?|pg||
nt|stc: endplay chancws here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gulyas: making him less likely to hold @H length, hence getting the finesse right|pg||
nt|psyck: as Mike pointed out, starting on @h would have given him more chances, if he could knock out the entry to the long @s hand|pg||
nt|passell: 10 of clubs a misprint|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably played a low @C|pg||
nt|sommer: wow..they missed the "easy" slam in OR|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|caitlin: Board 110 Gitelman bid/made 5@D|pg||
nt|caitlin: has he played?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no, is it still friday|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|jtmckee: this hand had one intersting thing for sure|pg||
nt|jtmckee: he led low|pg||
nt|caitlin: Eric!!!!|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 4th best|pg||
nt|caitlin: has he played to dummy yet!!|pg||
nt|jtmckee: had he led 3rd  best and kept all his diamonds   declarer might play him for a dbltn rather than length|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no no no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: will be time problems if they don't move faster|pg||
nt|caitlin: true Jay|pg||
nt|ralfwil: crossruff:)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

nt|athene: 4@H perhaps a mistake here|pg||
nt|athene: with three small spades|pg||
nt|athene: that is going to play very badly if partner has any spade length|pg||
nt|athene: and if he hasn't, opps are going to be bidding 4@S anyway|pg||

nt|athene: i don't see any way austria can gain on the last board|pg||
nt|bagman: Alarm clock is a signal, which asks partner to do something unexpected. Here the unexpected might be to continue hearts|pg||
nt|athene: very often when partner leads your suit and there is a singleton in dummy you just want him to continue|pg||
nt|athene: so you have to make sure you have some way to say that|pg||

nt|stc: wd by W and E|pg||
nt|tez: wd|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Both Dutch pairs (Paulissen-Jansma, Bertens-Westra) hope to be elected in the Dutch Bermuda Bow team|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chessmaste: here we have a regulation game|pg||
nt|taliga: 7@h is not a good save against the cold 6@s here :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: And here they will find the slam?|pg||
nt|granguru: this hand will be commented for a few days|pg||
nt|daman: 14 IMPs to Israel instead of a push    judgement at high levels is critical|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good lord another slam hand|pg||
nt|granguru: Here, probably over minors 4NT is used as a negative and the trump suit is just one step of the answers|pg||
nt|udo: thi s slam here is better|pg||
nt|stc: In the mean time Neth took the lead in the group|pg||
nt|dima:  :) Jan is right on the mney - Newski prospect is the main street in Sankt-Petersburg, where 3 of the current line-up members of Russian team come from :)|pg||
nt|chick: he made a good try for overtricks, and the defense did a good job of stopping them|pg||
nt|stc: no game for NS|pg||
nt|stc: because of the @d position|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|ybob: 2@D = short @D 11/15 probably|pg||
nt|ybob: 3°@C = to play|pg||
nt|karesz:  4-4-1-4 or 4-5-x-x 11-15|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D again, think they play the same opening here vuln and non vuln|pg||
nt|henryb:  Close whether to balance with 1N or pass 1@s out|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  South I don't know - possibly related to Susanne Kriftner - former member of Austria ladies team|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  who is now living in Germany|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s must restrain themselves|pg||

nt|dima:  Is there selection in Holland or team is hand picked?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: or passed, or doubles :)|pg||

nt|henryb:  2@c would not occur to me|pg||

nt|hawe45:  In 6 @C, East must decide, whether the @S King is bare - or from K 10...|pg||

nt|bagman: If 4NT is the right bid, 4@S was wrong (or vice versa)|pg||
nt|sommer: only chance in 5@S is a squeeze|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Although with all the running around I did to try to get this computer on the internet and not lose any other table, I certainly could miss a pass or two here and there :)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..the minorsqueeze against N|pg||
nt|roswolf: west fell in love with his 2 aces|pg||
nt|granguru: another alternative..is next step min, then partner can re-ask with next step, not the trump suit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W would perhaps bid 6 @C, not possible any longer|pg||
nt|henryb:  In which case no reason not to bid 1N|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chessmaste: 3NT is the obvious call |pg||
nt|jtmckee: diamond team playing strong right now|pg||
nt|caitlin: bd 11 Moss Xed in 4@S making|pg||
nt|caitlin: 111|pg||
nt|jtmckee: having a huge rally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or might not if W get a @D ruff.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hegedus is examining Macskasy's face right now:)|pg||
nt|othered1: why 2@H?|pg||
nt|udo: why do we have no scores from the other table ?|pg||
nt|ferlema: es que ves mas!!! antes hacias los mismos errores, pero no te dabas cuenta|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told the red suit rebids show length in other red suit.  If so, 3@H looks like 4th suit forcing . . . |pg||
nt|udo: i hear actual score  Austria 41:0|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: there seems to be be a problem with bbo, but they just play board 20 too in open-room|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: connection problem :(|pg||
nt|bagman: Did West really pass?|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were wet here imo a reopening double would have got them into the auction|pg||
nt|viren169: the vul and the 2@d bid kept N/S at bay!|pg||
nt|rodal f: LOL:)|pg||
nt|stc: going too high ?|pg||
nt|stc: -3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sommer: ..3?|pg||
nt|roswolf: it appears so pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: I admit that W holds a bad hand and they are vulnerable but still he's holding a reasonable spade suit and doubleton heart|pg||
nt|taliga: :)|pg||
nt|granguru: competitive bidding agreements at the high level are the keystones to pairs being successful in top compeition|pg||
nt|granguru: obviously in this format the 0 option does not exist as it would be min|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that should mean 6s next|pg||
nt|granguru: finally a non@C slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or 4nt|pg||
nt|vbman: l expect a 1370|pg||
nt|othered1: This auction isn't timing very well for them, but maybe it won't matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: for actual scores|pg||
pc|cK|nt|benjent: Unfortunately, we got dropped out at an interesting point in the play on the last, but I assume Greco managed it smoothly|pg||
nt|sommer: + Q:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Lead problem|pg||
nt|sommer: 4 keycards, actually|pg||
nt|roswolf: well so i cant count or perhaps type:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bagman: @CK creates a parking place for the diamond loser|pg||
nt|sommer: always makeable I guess|pg||
nt|sommer: now @D7 disappears|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but may work out ok|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|granguru: competition*|pg||
nt|daman: they almost passed out 3@C|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jtmckee: looks like Dallas vs the lakers|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  after 2NT what did N think that south has?|pg||
nt|sybarra: N obviously fell in love with his hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|taliga: weldone|pg||
nt|rodal f: Using 0314. I like better 1403|pg||
nt|othered1: did matter|pg||
nt|stc: no|pg||
nt|chick: a bit unlucky that the player on lead had the hearts|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bessi2: i wonder if Larsen will try to sneak a @h to the king right away|pg||
nt|bessi2: which would give him leeway to misguess @d|pg||
nt|bessi2: if it held that is|pg||
nt|daman: most of the people I know would be in 4@S|pg||
nt|vbman: oh this has been too far|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so far it looks like Verhees-Van Prooijen, another selection pair of Team Orange and the winners of the last NEC Cup do have the best papers|pg||
nt|sybarra: S may never balance again |pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb:  If S had the @cK instead of a red king, there would be 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|henryb:  which is what N was thinking|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: well perhaps e/w have dodged one|pg||
nt|taliga: For some reason almost noone uses 1430 in Hungary. Do not know why|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am afraid I would be in 4 @S  |pg||
nt|granguru: 4@H didnt show controls ..just a slam intention before surpassing 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no problem|pg||
nt|granguru: convention called LAST TRAIN |pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzge: he alerted it like this :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bagman: Did not GIB this but I think that @HK lead lets S to play a diamond trhu  in time|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think Deutsch came in with guns blazing to get ahead by far and has backfired|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: poor lakers|pg||
nt|daman: do they play support doubles on that side of the pond?|pg||
nt|granguru: as you have seen, and will continue do so, many distributional hands appear in a match today...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sommer: with "squeeze" I included "endplay"..of course|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ybob: 4405,4414,3415,4315, 11/15 hcp|pg||
nt|granguru: because of the perfect computer dealing|pg||
nt|granguru: hand dealt hands are much more flat|pg||
nt|jcomyn: rare thing - slam after opps open the bidding|pg||
pc|s6|nt|imp_jan: yes the pairs are picked by the npc Eric Laurant and coach Anton Maas|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jtmckee: as mr gowdy points out   deutsch much better sporrts|pg||
nt|dima:  DOes it matter who played in Ostende to earn the berth in the first place?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|roswolf: deutsch got caught in the other room|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodal f: It will come.|pg||
nt|granguru: so, 5@C min, 5@D 3 5@H 14 5@S 2 w/o|pg||
nt|dima:  I see|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vbman: grand makes?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: the final decision will be taklen right after the open EC in Poznan where all the pairs play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|benjent: This plays very well|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|benjent: and the lead didn't hurt :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Deutch probably going minus in both rooms to lose 6-8|pg||
nt|chick: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Train|pg||
nt|granguru:  pOLAND AND THE NEDS are tied with 85 now Russia 83|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|bagman: depending how many tricks Kranyak makes here|pg||
nt|caitlin: is Gowdy online?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bagman: each undertrick is worth an IMP|pg||
nt|karesz:  @c 5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: missed a frigid game|pg||
pc|d5|nt|taliga: misunderstanding. |pg||
nt|granguru: so it is of great importance to have it clear how to deal with them at the high level instances...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|caitlin: join us John|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|passell: unlikely that is what happened|pg||

nt|viren169: N/S will be relieved to find both 3N and 4@H are likly to go off!|pg||
nt|karesz:  East missplayed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Macskasy was a bit surprised that his @S7 earned a trick|pg||
nt|granguru: finally a flat one|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: in the open room they just ended in 7@hX|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: in board 8|pg||
nt|vbman: the first score they get is a missed grand not even a slam|pg||
nt|granguru:  austria 79|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the movie correctly |pg||
nt|vugraphzge: yes, i know... misklick :-/|pg||
nt|henryb:  easy 6 of either minor|pg||
nt|stc: and not many @ds :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 300 for N/S ws pretty good|pg||
nt|stc: not many points but 4@h is cold|pg||
mb|1C|nt|swanson: Hi to all.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be feisty|pg||
nt|karesz:  he had to ruff teh @c 9, and lead a heart!|pg||
nt|henryb:  :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: bits and pieces hand now|pg||
nt|sommer: 2 @H NS looks best|pg||
nt|jtmckee: deutsch needs about 6 imps a board..|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) Was big from beginning.|pg||
nt|tomi2: 11H is limited if this is the strong club board|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfj: 0-7|pg||
nt|viren169: lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: I can't imagine where Gowdy's allegiance lies:)|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 17 pt 4s here|pg||
nt|taliga: hi all :)|pg||
nt|karesz:  hi, father:)|pg||
nt|granguru: Last train is used when you have no more space to cue bid or show extras before the game level is reached. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: gallop for the line in 3nt |pg||
nt|granguru: so normally it is a 4@D bid when @H is trump or a 4@H bid when @s is trump|pg||
nt|jcomyn: like a scalded cat|pg||
nt|dima:  In any case it is going to be a strong team|pg||
nt|stc: flat 4@s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I play 2@s there pretty sound aswell but this east hand is too powerful for a 2@s bid there imo|pg||
nt|psyck: I may have tried a higher number of @h|pg||
nt|passell: the preemptive 1heart|pg||
nt|benjent: Indeed, don't make things worse. The wind will shift in their direction sometime. Need to make sure you haven't blown the match already when that happens.|pg||
nt|roswolf: will west bid here|pg||
nt|ybob: wrong hand|pg||
nt|karesz:  it is the other 2 @d:):)|pg||
nt|karesz:  perhaps in red?|pg||
nt|taliga: yeah, maybe :)|pg||
nt|granguru: NS have the balance of the hand but they are unfitted|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the opening bid, slam is with odds for E/W|pg||
nt|imp_jan: direct raise show 4crd support (NS play supp redbls)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: North worth precisely 2@s|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  found out more: S is an olympiad quarterfinalist (2000)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bagman: Facing a passed partner and holding a bad hand with no source of tricks S goes for the offshape X instead of the dangerous 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|ybob: now better :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Stolen. 4@S flat|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s may be @s and minor|pg||
mb|3D|nt|viren169: a light opener in 1st seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: (again) |pg||
nt|daman: 3NT looks like the final contract|pg||
nt|dima:  I would agree|pg||
nt|dima:  now 4@s and some handling|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: over bid 4@s over 4@h :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S bid = wow :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Bernard Teltscher is mostly a rubber bridge player, in his mid-eighties|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: north sticks his neck out|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt from N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice bidding from Elinescu here...|pg||
nt|tez: so 2 nt asking minor|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d ?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s likely|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d is a good save even on a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: The real score is probably 4-3 to Deutsch|pg||
nt|swanson: There is no really good opening bid with the South hand.  |pg||
nt|taliga: they have their own developed system...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT waited becauce the 5th@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: will Wladow find another bid with his hand?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For me, 6 NT is the right contract - knowing the @H Queen and the @C King by North|pg||
nt|tomi2: then you will be surprised how often Wladow has even less and Elinescu holds one of both cards|pg||
nt|stc: On a @d lead still makeable because of KQx@h in N, the J@H is the 11th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: *always bid|pg||
nt|dima:  looks like 4@h set up a force, though it is a bit strange|pg||
nt|henryb:  I played on a team with him in 1986 Rosenblu,|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: very true   I prefer 1heart overcall to dbl with west  anyone have an opinion?|pg||
nt|benjent: 1@h for me too. Tell partner where you live|pg||
nt|bagman: S happy having avoided being dummy in 3@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now time to set up the 9th trick|pg||
nt|karesz:  sppade would be better, Wesz promised spades too|pg||
nt|karesz:  West |pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: makes it very difficult for the opponents to get to 3nt  on many hands when it is cold|pg||
nt|sommer: calm down now...|pg||
nt|ybob: and light X too :)|pg||
nt|viren169: probably systematically t/out of @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i keep missing a spot of bidding :)|pg||
nt|ybob: over 1NT opening from W :)|pg||
nt|viren169: no worries... keeps us amused!|pg||
nt|caitlin: 21|pg||
nt|caitlin: brb.......|pg||
nt|granguru: so 3NT should be reached soon|pg||
nt|granguru: they did it faster than my writing!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: and it "flops" well |pg||
nt|sybarra: as they say in poker|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: i think 4@d was optional RCKB on @d, is this so?|pg||
nt|vbman: sorry for the internet inconvenience|pg||
nt|stc: in fact slam is cold|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bessi2: Larsen has to cash his 5 winners, otherwise he will wind up with only 4 it seems|pg||
nt|sommer: 9 tricks possible|pg||
nt|bagman: N cannot pass as 2@H is limited only by the inability to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: the chimera of the vul game bonus tempts north|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss asks Cohen if he had another way to raise 2@h to 3@h and Cohen says no|pg||
nt|bagman: N could have bid 2NT for the minors but 3@C is lead directing and normally also a good trump suit (facing a normal X=T/O)|pg||
nt|taliga: here we have the +1 point :)|pg||
nt|taliga: S tries to stop in 3@h|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|benjent: 9 tricks here ... but 6 losers first|pg||
nt|passell: 5 needed imps for deutsch|pg||
nt|passell: 7imps|pg||
nt|passell: hampson did have 1 suit stopped  just neither of theirs|pg||
nt|passell: Gavin did well to bid 1spade also|pg||
nt|benjent: I expect Kranyak will cash a big @d now|pg||
nt|sommer: sure sure..N has to raise to 3|pg||
nt|sommer: Cohen doesn't like it right now..I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed not clear how 3@S fares|pg||
nt|taliga: E can not tell how many... could have been 4|pg||
nt|udo: :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  well Gold talked him out of the slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: or was it E?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|chessmaste: With clubs 4-1 he would need to find East with @D K10 doubleton|pg||
nt|granguru: 6@C depends on the position of the @SK and @CQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: quick claim|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dima:  I think Holland is going to get on the board finally here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: do you think it will be made?|pg||
nt|vbman: even if misguesses trumps|pg||
nt|dima:  I have seen many hands that looked very tough to handle but Jan Jansma seems to mange them much more often than get them wrong|pg||
nt|stc: thanks to 3-3 @h|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: Everything else is friendly so S is unlikely to go down here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @cK very deep|pg||
nt|sybarra: who talked them out of slam|pg||
pc|h8|nt|benjent: Get some attitude (just in case) and also make sure partner returns the right thing|pg||
nt|passell: hampson hoping he has only 2|pg||
nt|ybob: S has 2 moves, @H or low @S ...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If fast boards are OK, this might be 490 in a hurry|pg||
nt|vbman: 54 - nill l hear|pg||
nt|udo: routine 4 @H here|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ybob: now K @D and 8 @H  ...|pg||
nt|ybob: if duck N play @S ...|pg||
nt|taliga: Any idea for best line?|pg||
nt|granguru: a safety play in @C |pg||
nt|granguru: to protect the @SK|pg||
nt|granguru: not really necessary because declarer holds @S10 and @S9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is close to a claim|pg||
nt|vbman: can u believe it?|pg||
nt|othered1: and their methods allowed them to find it -- justifying the 4th seat 1N opening.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It was N who did not cue bid 4@s|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bessi2: 4@s make but may be difficult to reach|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to guess the spades, avoid losing control and manage the diamonds (with ruff or luck)|pg||
nt|viren169: declarer will duck this expecting diamonds to be 5-3|pg||
nt|tez: @dnow|pg||
nt|dima:  :) Holland IS on the board|pg||
nt|dima:  he might transfer to some sort of cross ruff - let us see|pg||
nt|vbman: better try to keep it on four|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but East's @s are a threat|pg||
nt|dima:  not easy for defence here either|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|karesz:  and it could be enough|pg||
nt|taliga: 3? :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ybob: with 5@D on N he bids 2@D over 2@C|pg||
nt|viren169: and hope to bring the Ace down in 3|pg||
nt|granguru: 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daman: South could have bid 2@D    then North would play it|pg||
nt|granguru:  Now Poland 85 Russia and The Neds tied with 83|pg||
nt|vbman: l am surprised e wins first dia|pg||
pc|s7|nt|stc: even 4@s was a good save but W can't bid @s|pg||
pc|h7|nt|viren169: easy for us to see... looking at all 4 hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HK for me|pg||
nt|granguru: claim time|pg||
nt|udo: of course,,,,,,Austrai beat 4 @H with 3 rounds @D,,didnt bid slam where Q @S was wrong and so on and so on|pg||

nt|roswolf: this looks to be drifting -1|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @sK and crossruff|pg||
nt|stc: the suit is too bad|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chessmaste: Now declarer thinks 'Might East have ducked with @DK7?' - Not a chance so he cashes out|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and open room mis another slam|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bagman: Taking the easy tricks for book|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|bagman: In 4@S E might lose a club, a diamond and a spade|pg||
nt|tez: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|bagman: E needs to ruff two hearts and is a bit short of quick entries|pg||
nt|tez: small @c from dummy will work|pg||
nt|bagman: He might give up the chance of having @CA right and continue with a small club to open communications|pg||
nt|bagman: E has good spade spots and can afford to lose an overruf with the @SQ|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: 24 boards seems a very short final|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Smith: "made 3? got off to a slow start"|pg||
nt|sommer: slamtime|pg||
nt|bagman: Both N and S are happy right now|pg||
nt|jtmckee: u were|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: all tired here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Dec found a better line than me:) This one best in match. Now it's team|pg||
nt|rodal f: An easyer this time?|pg||
nt|daman: 1C 1D 1H 1S 2C 2D 2H 3NT|pg||
nt|vbman: 590 or 690?|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: no overtrick made...|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, sort of "I have a spade control" cue|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok,  singleton being enough|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  on  19 a strange overcall by W talked NS out of 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  South might have bid 3@s, but that would (to me) sound like looking for 3N|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and also no dbl as neither opponent was short in overcaller's suit :)|pg||
nt|chick: now we will have results from the other room|pg||
nt|chick: still a close match :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|frankaus: this is am exciting lot |pg||
nt|bagman: A solid slam here|pg||
nt|imp_jan: will win some imps i suppose, 4@S prob undlbd in or|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2X@S and @dA|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Hampson will be wondering if slam is on. The @d overcall is good news, really|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@D looks a cinch to bid|pg||
nt|karesz:  he had easy 10 and made hard 9|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe sp q was not played|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bagman: Both holding good looking two suiters|pg||
nt|roswolf: but which slam?|pg||
nt|bagman: EW have 12 tricks in both diamonds and NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Might have some communication problems in NT with heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room e/w never got to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|bagman: @HA|pg||
nt|roswolf: a relay sequence should do the trick here|pg||
nt|granguru: and 4 to score|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html for actual results|pg||
nt|granguru: remaining*|pg||
nt|sybarra: and vulnerable also! |pg||
nt|sybarra: geesh|pg||
nt|sybarra: N coming in?|pg||
nt|stc: and defense missed the @d lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chessmaste: I would not pass the South hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: interesting pass from Deutsch here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 4 corrected|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is possiblr here|pg||
nt|bagman: But nothing unsolvable; take @H diamonds and then @SQ|pg||
nt|daman: he will punt 3NT|pg||
nt|vbman: rehi|pg||
mb|2S|nt|benjent: No way is Hampson going to sit for that|pg||
nt|frankaus: no entry to  8 tricks :(|pg||
nt|sommer: 6@D, 6NT..or maybe even 7@D?|pg||
nt|bagman: Soon they will know about the misfit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Austrians need to win by 3VP more than Israelis to reach finals|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bessi2: a bidding challenge for n-s here.. to avoid the tempting 3N for the 11 trick gamecontract|pg||
nt|karesz:  1 @c Precision|pg||
nt|taliga: 1n is semiforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: rehi :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: here 6@S by north looks good (not with this lay out of course)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chessmaste: 2@D looks like a limited 3 suiter|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed,  one of my two favorite opening bid conventions|pg||
nt|chessmaste: With N/S cold for 5@D this is not par so far|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is easy watching all 4 hands. but imo Larsen should protect here,  |pg||
nt|bessi2: could be disastrous, but you lose to many partscore swings by passing I think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps, and certainly if South is allowed to pass with this type of hand|pg||
nt|benjent: 3NT was bad news for Hampson (wasted @d card in his partner's limited hand) and he's sensibly focussing on game|pg||
nt|bagman: But they have lots of cards and a reasonable diamond fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes fortune will favor the brave here|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: TD is here because of the last board i think, so it takes a little bit more time...|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: hmmm... now our scores are missing in the movie :(|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s no 4 card major means|pg||
nt|sybarra: Whack|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@D the only making game|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing diamonds i suppose and if so 4@D MUST BE A SLAM TRY|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok so is 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOW SLAM IS EASY PEASEY|pg||
nt|bagman: Not even trying to guess what's going on here biddingwise|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C precision, 1@S  i think positive unbal but not sure|pg||
nt|ybob: 8/11|pg||
nt|sybarra: this  can make |pg||
nt|granguru: NS can win 4@C but better 3NT if @HJ is played|pg||
nt|vbman: reasonably aftr cashing 5 tricks east plays a h to dummy and its one off|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 1@C = Polish|pg||
nt|sybarra: no whack ...probably afrain club wont cash|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1 down |pg||
nt|henryb:  who should whack what, Shirley?|pg||
nt|stc: looks like EW will not enter the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I am not saying I would bid, I am somewhat of a chicken in these spots, I am saying one should|pg||
nt|passell: they are there|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D save? |pg||
nt|viren169: all routes lead to 3N|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Austria charging now|pg||
nt|henryb:  If anything I think East should double 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|karesz:  the others is not known by me|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Bodis is shaking his head|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chessmaste: South could have staretd with either minor, or used a gadget - say 2@H a three suiter always with hearts   |pg||
nt|frankaus: green V gren saves not real value|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@D looks like a good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: @D is the trump suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 6@D|pg||
nt|granguru: sorry thought the lead was from the other side|pg||
nt|vbman: or just the decl losses 3 dias|pg||
nt|udo: actual score   Austria 65:0|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: i will fill in the scores after this board|pg||
nt|stc: 10 tricks is a minimum, 12 double dummy are possible|pg||
nt|stc: A@h and small @c|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sommer: guess 3@S would be 4th suit, so N saved it|pg||
nt|ybob: another NT ?|pg||
nt|karesz:  are|pg||
nt|taliga: i guess not known by anyone except E-W|pg||
nt|taliga: they work hard to develop their system (almost daily basis)|pg||
nt|granguru: Y..LET ME CHECK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bessi2: It must have been delightful for Deutsc to see that 3@d bid :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think a grand is possible|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H could be kickback but could also be something else|pg||
nt|granguru: sorry private|pg||
nt|hawe45:  An easy way to 5 IMPÂ´s for Germany|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He is relieved|pg||
nt|chessmaste: or even reprieved|pg||
nt|gulyas: well done|pg||
nt|benjent: How to get back to hand? A @d ruff is not 100% safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: to be bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman writing questions to Cohen, but I can't quite make it out - sorry|pg||
nt|bagman: Grand is possible but on a trump lead it might be a bit tricky to play|pg||
nt|sommer: S doesn't know about the @Cvoid, so he may go for the grand|pg||
nt|karesz:  5 @c is the limit|pg||
nt|granguru: here it is almost obvious|pg||
pc|c2|nt|passell: good lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Hampson did well to avoid a spade lead - that would put a lot of pressure on West to find the overtake and club shift.|pg||
nt|roswolf: NICELY BID|pg||
nt|bagman: The play is no problem|pg||
nt|puncher99: cashout time|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very marginal, not worth pushing for|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tez: nice lead for defence|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chessmaste: Declarer will claim in a moment|pg||
nt|sommer: 5n?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5nt may get north bidding 7@D|pg||
nt|bagman: I'd like to be in 6@S where I can draw trumps and then pass the @ST :)|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@D|pg||
nt|bagman: Or pass the @ST and then draw trumps |pg||
nt|daman: he needs to bring the @Cs home for 1 loser|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|passell: hard to mis guess diamonds as only 1 4 -1 break is useful|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|passell: club now|pg||
nt|benjent: As it happens, he can't go wrong on the 2nd round of @d's, since the @h10 is short onside|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert may ruff the 2nd @c ... maybe a bit of uppercutting, chance to try a @d to promote partner's @h's|pg||
nt|taliga: boring 3N instead|pg||
nt|karesz:  16-16 after 9 boards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't it normaly 8-10 as long as they play a sort of prec|pg||
nt|stc: best defense was to let S win and play a trump|pg||
nt|chick: wonder why he grabbed the ace|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|puncher99: cranes law|pg||
nt|bagman: Good lead; it scared Diamond|pg||
nt|puncher99: lead aces vrs all slams|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no info - sorry|pg||
nt|viren169: 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|taliga: highest unnecessary|pg||
nt|sybarra: ace and a club  and home|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and 6@S u first test diamonds and then check @CA right sided|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe being afraid of dummys dias khoklov try cl ace|pg||
nt|chick: seems like he would rather have the lead in S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jtmckee: theres 8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|swanson: Now, by the time spades are led the situation will be clear to the defenders.|pg||
nt|jtmckee: and at Yankee stadium, mississippi state bulldog Jon Pappelbon takes the mound vs the evil empire|pg||
nt|jtmckee: he must duck this else the d has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|jtmckee: and if he does they can attack his heart entry|pg||
nt|stc: best return|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|passell: a tricky 3 rounds of hearts is the only chance|pg||
nt|sommer: S has a lot of trick potential..6@D looks a little puss..|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and 7 it was|pg||
nt|roswolf: OK SOUTH JUST BID IT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen " I've got some holes" Smith: "you've got some too?"|pg||
nt|bagman: THis might take some time|pg||
nt|sommer: N has to take a few deep breaths...but the lucky lie of the cards may help him through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen thinks so too - he's gone for coffee :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well we can see both ordinary finesses work|pg||
nt|bagman: There are 11 tricks with one ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: remember..S has no entry after @Hfinesse!|pg||
nt|roswolf: and i dont see how he can avoid taking at least 1|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might win this in dummy and then take the ordinary spade finesse and hope to ruff down the king|pg||
nt|sommer: .. he MUST run @S10 for sure|pg||
nt|sommer: exactly|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that looks the more practical line |pg||
nt|cicus: ?|pg||
nt|granguru:  fanfantoni-Nunes recovering for Monaco against Israel...now Israel 84 England 83 shortening the gap from 5 to just 1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bagman: If the @SK does not come down, he has some chances left in hearts|pg||
nt|vbman: u cant check both,|pg||
nt|dima:  If 3@c is a cuebid then unlikely to lead so short @c A|pg||
nt|imp_jan: why not?|pg||
nt|dima:  We'll see|pg||
nt|vbman: u end up with a cl looser as dummys trumps need be played|pg||
nt|imp_jan: true|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sommer: only makeable, even..I think|pg||
nt|vbman: wont finesse now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bagman: But my line is easy to take when seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|imp_jan: still|pg||
nt|ianmcc: over we go|pg||
nt|henryb:  9 more imps to Austria|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|taliga: Maybe you are right :) |pg||
nt|cicus: hi Frank and all|pg||
nt|imp_jan: u ruff diamonds high|pg||
nt|vbman: i have a positive feeling for this hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|benjent: Bit of mostly harmless stewing|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: sorry, because of the connection i couldnt be at the table...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: a @s finess in trick 2 for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  on this side Poland 85 Russia and Ned 83|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: but he must aim to set up dummy|pg||
nt|sommer: he listened!|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|sommer: @C2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Smith: "the first hurdle" Cohen: "always happy to see things win"|pg||
nt|granguru: partial results till this moment section A Israel 40 Ireland 33 section B poland 39 Netherlands 38|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Which was the result before this lead. I repeat: I your dear GOD gives you Ace-King - you better lead one of them|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

pc|h4|nt|frankaus: g2g tu all 4 ur company|pg||

nt|dima:  Khokhlov came through on the opening lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|swanson: East is going to be squeezed out of a club now but I still think the defense can prevail.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|granguru: @DK will be lost but there are no more entries to E hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dima:  A bit unlucky for Holland here|pg||
nt|stc: 2 more IMP for Austria, may count in such a close match|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|swanson: East can be endplay now.  This was an unusual 3-suit squeeze.  Declarer still has the guess the situation, of course if West rises and leads a club.  It wouldn't be fun to lose the ...|pg||
nt|swanson: contract if hearts were 3-3 all along.|pg||

mb|3H|nt|bagman: In unfriendly game a proper comment by NS might put EW to tilt |pg||
nt|taliga: yap, I was slow|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The defence can hardly have tested declarer her - more or less throwing the overtricks after him|pg||
nt|stc: NS pushed them by bidding 4@h|pg||
mb|d|nt|chessmaste: 2@C - must be a Transfer|pg||
nt|karesz:  younger is faster|pg||

mb|4S|nt|gowdy: :) thanks|pg||
nt|granguru: I remind you to register hand 7 to play it yourself afterwards..a good declarer play practice...you shoud make 5@S. |pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Greco could almost bid 1NT without looking at his hand|pg||
nt|bagman: Not much in play here; declarer loses two hearts and the spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen played very quickly from dummy and Moss said "too fast" - so Cohen waited a moment and then played and Moss said "still too fast" Cohen: "sorry"|pg||
nt|sommer: a practical 4@S from N..and he's awarded with 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sommer: quite lucky, but ok|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much N can do; he either makes this or not (losing to 4-1 spades or uppercut/overruf)|pg||
nt|sommer: it's only around 33% but 4@S is "the bid"|pg||
nt|bagman: If E cashes a heart and plays a club; N might wonder weather to play @SK from hand or go to dummy and play a spade to pick up A singleton onside and risk diamond ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman took the @h A out, but now has folded his hand up again|pg||

nt|jtmckee: and the Mississippi State Bulldog shuts down the bronk bombers|pg||
nt|taliga: The weak no trump makes life hard for both pair here|pg||
nt|taliga: E couldnt introduce majors, |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South willlead @S Ace - to teach partner...|pg||
nt|imp_jan: dbl = inv for 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: hmm.. had to cancel my speech regarding the play in 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: can't read the notes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a wild guess. Easier if S had a natural @c opening|pg||
nt|taliga: N couldn't bid his hand or ask anything from partner|pg||
nt|karesz:  Hegedus as brave poiceman!|pg||
nt|taliga: After a bid like this, you lead like after gambling 3N: your ace |pg||
nt|taliga: this case... it was not very succesfull...|pg||
nt|taliga: only club would have been good|pg||
nt|chick: is the 1@H transfer?|pg||
nt|udo: same start other room, but than north did to much|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: when the @CJ works, he'll regret not bidding 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Poland leads again with 3 Imps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|benjent: Double seems a bit optimistic with no @c pips|pg||
nt|gowdy: and the world is good !|pg||
nt|cicus: trying for the ruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: That was a funny lead. A @D and 10 now 11|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y:)|pg||
nt|cicus: I was just considering whether a small @D is indicated here instead of the Q|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would think so|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chessmaste: Well, South pushed the boat out with 2@H and has now left his ship in the harbour. 4@H would have had chances - this has none |pg||
nt|gulyas: this will not test declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: a trump lead would have prolonged the play|pg||
nt|sommer: @H for @C's?|pg||
nt|viren169: West didnt raise because East is limited|pg||
nt|viren169: 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|vbman: some end plays|pg||
pc|hA|nt|benjent: The 2nd @c trick gets Greco up to 6, and the @s finesse will make it 7|pg||
nt|benjent: No problem getting the @d suit right when North has bid both blacks|pg||
nt|jtmckee: yes it is|pg||
nt|cicus: now no headaches for declarer|pg||
nt|granguru:  partial standings Poland 90 ned 83|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|passell: looks like he will make this|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond play is not that risky as if there was a diamond ruff hangin, the defense might have gone for that|pg||
nt|sommer: @H2..|pg||
nt|roswolf: creaking to the obvious contract|pg||
nt|dima:  looks like a bit too much by Paulissen|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: This is the best lead and declarer might have some difficulties as he's probably giving up a club |pg||
nt|bagman: then a diamond back and defense set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: win and lead a heart following with the club finesse looks very natural|pg||
nt|gowdy: note the lead @H 2  so S thinks  they are 44 or W has the length|pg||
nt|jtmckee: yes  he will knock out the wrong entry first and regret it later|pg||
nt|gowdy: rite @C to the A  then a @D hook|pg||
nt|karesz:  13 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: if you are using the web version of BBO it is easy to record them in your prefered hands file|pg||
nt|granguru:  russia 78 w/o hand 9 favorable to Russia |pg||
pc|h2|nt|bessi2: imo,  both are to blame for this contract|pg||
nt|granguru: I think GIB analyses the play trick by trick if you want it|pg||
nt|ianmcc: overboard|pg||
nt|dima:  or Pass by Jansma is encouraging?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bagman: A low diamond now|pg||
nt|stc: baorad 20 4@h not Xed -3, NS tried 4@s and went down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: breathless suspense|pg||
nt|stc: Austri may win 1 here|pg||
nt|chick: surely will, as there is now no way to avoid a diamond loser|pg||
pc|h8|nt|taliga: double dummy analysis, as always... |pg||

pc|hQ|nt|passell: 5 with any lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyhow E see the AXX at N and will use the K for a new if W lead Q@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: I'm sorry, they played too fast for me :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: I'm out|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: we all know that operator is the toughest job of all here|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: I need a brake ;-)|pg||
nt|granguru: And Lucas did it wonderfully|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: thanks John :)|pg||
nt|granguru: well just one more board for this set ...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: and I had also preferred to show both majors as E|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|passell: the nine of clubs was a good card to see|pg||
nt|benjent: Cashing the @d's to squeeze some unhappy discards out of Wolpert|pg||
nt|sommer: @SQ and claim|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer is more or less forced to play clubs from hand|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|benjent: That @c pitch from Wolpert tells Greco he only had 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: on last hand inother room, they played 1N making 2, so 10 IMPs to Deutsch|pg||
nt|taliga: 2N?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||

mb|4D|mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: that is a cautious 3@S; is he allowing for a 4-card overcall perhaps?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: he did keep it down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss was thinking about overtaking the club, so Smith showed his hand and asked "how do I do?"|pg||
nt|sommer: dangerous partial now|pg||
nt|bagman: Yes the hand was down to the "skill cards"; play from top and see if the trumps break|pg||
nt|sommer: who want's it?:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..wow..realy?|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a real ouch|pg||
nt|bagman: S ruffed the @D and played a top trumps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if natural 3@d otherwise 2nt|pg||
nt|taliga: After 2N it takes some time to convince partner about having majors, still, may worth the energy|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S is just on here, can they bid it?|pg||
nt|daman: this is now the last board of this session|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|chick: at least it wasn't a very exciting hand :)|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose if he had been in 4, he would have played it for 4|pg||
mb|1D|nt|granguru: extremely rare situation|pg||
nt|jbgood: E W do actually play transfers after 1@c...|pg||
nt|vbman: even more here?|pg||
nt|granguru:  last hand of the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Well, thats the last board for today, thanks to all commentators and kibitzers :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  As of now, Austria is 3VP ahead on running scores|pg||
nt|chick: if there is a decent play for 4 and you are in 3, best to play as if 4 goes down|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html|pg||
nt|stc: great result for Poland in OR|pg||
nt|chick: a heart block let's 5@D make|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: danger lurks|pg||
nt|sommer: even 1NT EW is far too high|pg||
nt|cicus: N may interfere|pg||
nt|baldfriede: good result for Poalnd at the other table; this will give themthe victory|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzge: For full vugraph schedule, http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php, all times local to you!|pg||
nt|henryb:  This is a trap board for E-W. The Austrian E chose to play 4@s on the 5-3 instead of 4@h on the 4-4|pg||
mb|4S|nt|benjent: And then Greco mis-guessed the spades on the low spade through|pg||
nt|sommer: 1@S best for NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bidding wont end here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Good pressed|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt is best|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Poland*|pg||
nt|stc: yes, and 5@s only -1|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sommer: nope|pg||
nt|bagman: Having opened subminimum, W is reluctant to X|pg||
nt|sommer: 2@S = minimum with 6|pg||
nt|cicus: no, colours disgusting|pg||
nt|granguru: nor will this one...probably|pg||
nt|dima:  last hand here |pg||
nt|sybarra: something tells me we might play in 5 @D here|pg||
nt|henryb:  instead of 4@h on the 4-4|pg||
nt|stc: or made if defense tries to cash a 2nd @d|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: neck on the chopping block|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 6d|pg||
nt|karesz:  drury|pg||
nt|tez: but hard to find|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 1@C Polish, 1@D = neg|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..2@H..|pg||
nt|sommer: ufffff|pg||
nt|bagman: The next X is not for take out|pg||
nt|taliga: double from S?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S or 5@C lost?|pg||
nt|taliga: Wild preepts has its culture in Hungary... (not like 1430 :))|pg||
nt|daman: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  this is the last hand of the RR - many thanks to our operator in Bonn, Lukas Schenk for the excellent show, also thanks to the German Bridge Federation for organizing this great tournament and last but not least my co-commentators :)_|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  S figured out what North's minor is...|pg||
nt|henryb:  and notice that played by W the @hK beats 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to you also Gerben,  and thx Lukas ":)|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: I find that surprising - obviously didn't expect much from Wolpert's X|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes even 6N|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 7d|pg||
nt|granguru: I think it is the first time in my life...W opens 1NT and N having a 2 strong bal hand|pg||
nt|granguru: even 1NT is a weak one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how did they get to 2nt in open|pg||
nt|chick: East bid it :)|pg||
nt|granguru: opened 2NT|pg||
nt|ianmcc: bye all I'd love to know about  3|pg||
nt|imp_jan: likely push|pg||
nt|vbman: bye|pg||
nt|henryb:  or certainly 5@s|pg||
nt|chick: 5@D undoubled would have been better for Poland|pg||
nt|stc: and a (normal ?) push|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: ouch|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Lukas, our great operator |pg||
nt|granguru: pasive lead is the order of the day|pg||
nt|daman: Bravo Lukas|pg||
nt|jcomyn: brave|pg||
nt|vbman: cl on|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: last board for this round, thanks to all commentators and kibitzers, see you in some minutes to round six|pg||
nt|tez: 4@h is normal|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sommer: Cohen doesnt believe his own eyes|pg||
nt|roswolf: that dbl was|pg||
nt|rodal f: wd S|pg||
nt|taliga: S knows, that N has strong balanced hand, or long clubs|pg||
nt|udo: Q ,,than A@C, small @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: oh sorry, round 5 of course :)|pg||
nt|vbman: better be careful with clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: I hope to see you all tomorrow again :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  have to take |pg||
nt|granguru:  if not @S and @S ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 10:00 CET, Russia - Netherlands :)|pg||
nt|tez: take ace cash trumps but @d's are problem|pg||
nt|tez: i hope 1 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: For full vugraph schedule, http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php all times local to you!|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html for actual scores|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ouch|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chessmaste: Yes, but their side is leading 31-14!|pg||
nt|bagman: S checking if everybody has same coloured cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Smith: "no blue" (the RDBL bidding card is blue :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup and the vampires gather for the feast|pg||
nt|sommer: -2 or.MAYBE only -1..so not too expensive|pg||
nt|sommer: crossruff!..and @Dfinesse gives a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S scores 3 trump tricks and N the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: Cohen probably disapointed after the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: but in the other room i doubt e/w will be in game|pg||
nt|bagman: @CA, @S to !K|pg||
nt|sommer: @SA + 3 @Htricks is the strange outcome of best play|pg||
nt|taliga: knowing him well, he was considering that :)|pg||
nt|karesz:  good save in open at former board|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: last board for this round, i hope to see you at 20:30 CET for round 4|pg||
nt|udo: or duck to hand @C to ace, @C to 10|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  expensive decision to bid 5-over-5|pg||
nt|sybarra: unfortunately  now N may lead a @D |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  S should have dbld?|pg||
nt|henryb:  why?|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard bid them? |pg||
nt|henryb:  but Briggida gave him @HKQJ which means she wants him to lead them|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bessi2: @d J,  @c to the jack and queen,  east better play another @d there otherwise easy 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Then if N ducks, diamond finesse and another spade|pg||
nt|cicus: E took an aggressive but sensible road|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: everyone's asking Macskasy about his bid:)|pg||
nt|cicus: oh just noticed E has only 1 @C so 11 tricks can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: they're just telling him, that it was an overbid|pg||
nt|granguru: excellent lead|pg||
nt|chick: 400 vs 550 is 4 imps, enough to swing the win to Austria|pg||
nt|stc: whar happens if tied ? more boards ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: i dont know|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: but it will not happen this year...|pg||
nt|stc: didn't notice, the very last board :)|pg||
nt|stc: so, congartulations for Poland for the Nations Cup 2011 after a good, close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thanks for watching the last two days, it was a very nice event here in Bonn, tomorrow the German Bridge Trophy starts|pg||
pc|cA|nt|passell: 3hearts was not the winning decision here|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 13 trs|pg||
nt|granguru: :(|pg||
nt|mcarroll: m|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ybob: 11 tricks anyway if they play in @H, only 10 in @S|pg||
nt|taliga: (ok, not long clubs, but distributional hand anyway)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe get a club away  or 2 if N decides to lead his tenace of kqjxx |pg||
pc|c6|nt|ybob: he can pich @D on 3th @C too|pg||
nt|ybob: probably only 10|pg||
nt|ybob: playing 4@S he plays trump at trick 2|pg||
nt|ybob: A@D and trump|pg||
nt|vbman: yes easy when doube dummy|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|passell: dbl or pass or even 2nt woulda worked out|pg||
nt|roswolf: dd i think maybe -2|pg||
nt|bagman: here declarer can afford to play the heart and take the club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense cannot take enough tricks to strip squeeze declarer to anything harmful|pg||
nt|cicus: I like 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In theory we are back in 7 minutes with Sweden vs Netherlands|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Expect a delay|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: thanks for watching, thanks for the commentators|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: I look forward to see you again tomorrow|pg||
nt|chick: well, it was a very close match, so congratulations to Poland and well done to Austria as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Congratulations to Poland|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Congratulation to Austria for silver medal|pg||
pc|c3|nt|udo: sure|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  England found 6@D|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chessmaste: East is after an entry in the Bulletin - except there isn't one|pg||
nt|vbman: no entry now|pg||
nt|vbman: so small is a must|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sommer: I agreed to that -2|pg||
nt|bagman: W eloping with the small trumps; he knows the hearts are likely to be 5-0|pg||
nt|roswolf: re|pg||
nt|sommer: The Italian waiter struck again!!|pg||
nt|bagman: The club ruff was too early as S can discard a diamond on the next club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sorry, slightly flakey internet connection too - you'd think with 4 choices I could find one that was solid :)|pg||
nt|sommer: right..thats why it's -2 now|pg||
nt|sommer: you havent been a waiter in Italy, do you, Susan?:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N needs to take this and play a club for a diamond discard; if W wins this, he should take his two diamond tricks as long as he can|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Actually, this is Jan - I switched with Susan when we couldn't get Susan's computer on the internet; haven't been a waiter any place|pg||
nt|roswolf: natural to win i think|pg||
nt|sommer: ok:)|pg||
nt|bagman: S can hold @SK and QJT98 of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: We're at trick 5 now - did something not get through (still worrying about connection :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room the grand is being played in 4@H!!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: FROZEN AT TRICK 3|pg||
nt|sommer: "The Italian waiter" is a BBO "thing"...from a vue-graff in Italy some years ago, where a waiter fell over the pc cables and turned all off |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss deciding whether to take the diamond finesse - if he hadn't been doubled, of course he'd need it for 4 (losing 2 hearts and a spade) but doubled, he knows hearts aren't ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: breaking|pg||
nt|bagman: Diamond lucky in the grand hand because 4@H does not lose much more than 6@D would lose|pg||
nt|roswolf: jan what happened at t3 did north win @SA?|pg||
nt|bagman: That also shows why on IMPs dubious grands should not be bid; the opps might end up in game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: I'll keep playing out the hand and then if it doesn't get through to you, I'll have to close and start again and hope I can do better. But spade to A, Club Q on which S pitched a ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: diamond & W ruffed, diamond J winning, |pg||
nt|roswolf: TY JAN|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: big thanks to the commentators! :)|pg||
nt|udo: easy seeing all cards|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: calm waters|pg||
nt|taliga: so it is reasonable to give a shot|pg||
nt|daman: this is a crushing victory for Israel|pg||
nt|othered1: still needs a 9th, when north ducks next @C|pg||
nt|vbman: molva suggests n ducks|pg||
nt|udo: should have talen @S in hand|pg||
nt|udo: taken |pg||
nt|vbman: now good dia guess|pg||
nt|udo: still difficult|pg||
nt|vbman: give him 44 in sp and cl so shor in dia|pg||
nt|vbman: easy when double dummy|pg||
nt|vbman: sp q was off the way|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: good play, cashing the @CAK would have let it thru|pg||
nt|gowdy: GIb might find it  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html for actual scores|pg||
nt|vbman: down now?|pg||
nt|udo: looks like|pg||
nt|vbman: but very difficult|pg||
nt|othered1: winning @S in hand, presumably to play @C to K then low back also faced some entry problems|pg||
nt|udo: guess he will try @D to 10 now ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 22:25 CET the next round begins|pg||
nt|vbman: l doubt if ns has the mind for that left|pg||
nt|udo: yes, ED , @H ace can than be removed|pg||
nt|henryb:  So Austria wins by 9|pg||
nt|henryb:  which is probably enough|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  still 1 hand missing for Israel|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but probably that hand is a win for their opps as it was  24 and Israel tried 4@H -5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bagman: Now the @S9 stops the spades and declarer holds enough tricks to make the contract|pg||
nt|bagman: Is he going to play a diamond up for an overtrick?|pg||
nt|roswolf: he probably should|pg||
nt|rodal f: The long @C came as an exsta premium anyway:)|pg||
nt|taliga: at least 4 :)|pg||
nt|taliga: (if not strong balanced)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not best minor?|pg||
nt|taliga: Better minor, yes. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Could then have 4-3-3-3 or?|pg||
nt|taliga: yes, but then he has to be strong|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|taliga: (15+)|pg||
nt|taliga: so finally I understood what you mean. The long club came as an extra premium..... yes, right :)|pg||
nt|taliga: I have to leave for 5 minutes, sorry|pg||
nt|vbman: king and a heart|pg||
nt|vbman: so we continue to respect you|pg||
nt|vbman: :))))|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
mc|11|nt|bessi2: not sure I understand this play by Larsen.. if loses to the @c Q then e-w have another oppertunity to play @d |pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: although it was an overbid, yes|pg||
nt|chick: Bye everyone :)|pg||
pg||
