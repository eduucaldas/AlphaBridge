nt|athene: then south could rise the ace but he doesn't get a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: as east has the 9 for the third round of clubs|pg||

nt|athene: the play might get interesting here|pg||

pc|h6|pc|c6|pc|s3|pc|h9|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: east probably knew the heart was getting ruffed but didn't think it was worth trying the @S6|pg||

pc|c8|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: even if you set up a heart trick for a club pitch that might not help you all that much|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: once club discard isn't necessarily any use at all if you can ruff clubs in dummy without cost|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like a peaceful 9 tricks here with the @CT falling|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: obviously not a "Senior"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: note that irelaznd broughtg in az\ wsorld champion at great expense from the U.S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Goodman asked about lead style|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who is that?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jtr: No slip|pg||
nt|jtr: Unless maybe a @h now|pg||
nt|ady: good play by north|pg||
nt|ady: yes   take a safety play|pg||
nt|ady: ace and king  and third towards the jack|pg||
nt|ady: south needed to win A@S    not obvious|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jtr: If the @d finesse is right he has 9|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: Simpson's giving this a long look|pg||
nt|santyclz: To watch multiple tables:  www.bridgebase.com/mobile  Open 1 browser window/table.|pg||
nt|santyclz: There are only 8 to watch at the moment, but that may increase...|pg||
nt|hedyg: he must have a pretty good idea of the count by now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I'm sure he does|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: he is originally from donegal|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ady: plat went the same way in CR  up to north ducking the spade   but declarer carried on with spades   and the diamond dwithc came|pg||
nt|ady: switch|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|hedyg: hoping to drop stiff J@S in S ?|pg||

nt|granguru: 20 HCP|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|jtr: X?|pg||
nt|athene: well, EW have 25 hcp, but it is a 30-point deck for them|pg||
nt|henryb:  34|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @sA is still in play|pg||
nt|granguru: hand fit so well that even 6@D can be made|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: yes, but i don't think 6@D would score heavily on a bidding competition|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|granguru: but you will sure be on the newspapers...|pg||
nt|athene: not sure exactly how good 6@C is - you need 33 hearts or the diamond finesse i suppose|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Or a show up maybe|pg||
nt|athene: but you might alternatively play the @DAK and run the trumps hoping the @DQ falls or there is a red suit squeeze|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|jtr: I really hate that 2@c bid  Even prefer 2@h|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: just test hearts, fall back on diamond finesse feels like the best odds|pg||
nt|henryb:  How good is the slam? needs clubs (88%) plus either @h 3-3 (36%) or the @d Q behaving (about 51%)|pg||

mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|hedyg: no support double...|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@cs reasonable here, basicly on the @d finesse and @c break.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I don't think that's in their arsenal|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yo_yo: system cards here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Penton asks about leads - 4th highest|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with 2 famous twin sons  - world class b ridge players too|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: good percentage for 3 tricks from hearts  takes Q10XX offside to go down  once spade is ducked|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: sorry about that, got it right now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok thnx Tim|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: or on @d/@h squeeze|pg||
nt|santyclz: With the possibility of 3-3 @hs obviating the need for the finesse.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|yo_yo: hi everyone |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: yeeha|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@D splinter may get them to the @C slam|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: McG thinking about a duck|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ady: might play low|pg||
nt|jtr: This is not routine|pg||
nt|jtr: Although can make 3@s tricks even going wrong at trick one|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Hi Kath|pg||
nt|jcomyn: This WILL NOT make|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Or win the Ace and play @ds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well slam is close |pg||
nt|idc: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hi Martin,  I see the 2 english teams matched together for the first round|pg||
nt|hedyg: since S only bid 2@s there might also be a possibility of ruff/discard after @S lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: i wonder how many "English"  playing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Standard procedure I believe Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that to stop collusion? |pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|hedyg: except if the 2@s bid shows 5 cards..:p|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: but should eventually make 3 tricks even playing low|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   you already mentioned that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well one is titled "Great Britain" so a bit more expansive|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Simpson asks about leads - low from honour, could be 3 to honour|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|santyclz: 5 card majors?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: 6h by n|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@h North|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: cant really go down   9 tricks  with 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|ady: was really correct to play A@S initially   would not welcome a club switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: now asks about count - reverse count|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|ady: 9@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhw: denies good clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzhw: 2nd 4th|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: on some lay outs  not a card that can be spared|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: it's worth pointing out that south's 3@S in the other room, as opposed to 2@S here, made things harder for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: even though west made exactly the same bid over it (4@C) in both rooms|pg||
nt|henryb:  3-0 is 24%, therefore 3-0 offside is 12%|pg||

pc|dA|nt|athene: sorry i mean 3@S in this room :)|pg||
nt|jtr: ok|pg||
nt|wstuart: 11% @C bad, 51% @D coming in + (49% * 35% @H coming in)|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: that is quite a common tactical bidding idea - you know someone is going to bid something so you bid just enough for his bid not to be a jump|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|c4|nt|athene: then his partner has to allow for the fact that he stretched to bid it|pg||

nt|yo_yo: http://www.camrosebridge.com/index.php|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzfv: O'Shea revoked there, throwing @c2 - Hackett asked "no spades?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: spade substituted and @c2 is a penalty card, Goodman being advised of his options by TD|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: Q@D best chance|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes Good shot|pg||
nt|ady: but only 1 discard needed|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: cricky , talk about letting them off the hook|pg||
nt|jcomyn: eggstraordinary|pg||
nt|idc: A contract in the 2 systems on display: E-W are 12-14 NT with a Multi 2@d|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jtr: Must play one anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: @d5 out, puts it back|pg||
pc|d5|nt|idc: 'contrast'|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: what now?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: that's a fairly recent change in the rules, being able to ask " no spades" |pg||
nt|yo_yo: and a sensible change too i think|pg||
nt|paulhac:  3NT wasa good shot as |pg||
pc|c4|nt|pjs_ch: safe 8 tricks now|pg||

nt|hedyg: now you go off|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like a good time to offer a settlement.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: would have thought club slam child's play for the H's|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pjs_ch: slam was awkward - W didn't know about partner's heart control, and E didn't know the clubs were as good as AKxx|pg||

nt|yo_yo: well well well|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||

mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: but it has some considerations depending on theopponents styles|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: i would have thought doubling 2@H for takeout shows south's hand a bit better than 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS dohave a club fit, not that anyone ever considers playing in clubs these days |pg||
nt|granguru: the one who always will jump, agressive bidder, will do so now, and you have to decide to defend sometimes a one level higher|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|granguru: it is a complicate matter..|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: 4@C would be an interesting contract|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead would be costly, allowing a spade discard from the south hand|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|granguru: a @S or a @D will do|pg||

nt|idc: For most of this set we won't get comparisons from the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: thus he couldn't play @dQ - K dropping 9 to set up 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: he asked for a club I believe, Hackett led a diamond having none and the club ruff stood out a mile|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ady: e/w can make 2@S in spite of 4 trump tricks to lose|pg||
nt|idc: Heh, thanks Tim - rare for dummy to be a fault in the play but it happens sometimes|pg||
nt|santyclz: The good news is 4@s isn't likely to  make either.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: heart position very favourable for e/w|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: other room playing the slam hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: EW CC at http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/hollandhallberg.pdf|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Strange to see john holland playing a strong NT, he's played a weak NT for 45 years|pg||
nt|capercliff: it wasnt easy from south's point of view was it?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: mind you i can tell you a few of my defensive errors if you like :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I'm all ears|pg||
nt|yo_yo: more difficult for south|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: so obviously not all that difficult|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|idc: A borderline invitational hand for East|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: the 9@h was a curious card from that holding, looking at dummy it looks as though the A@d couldn't hurt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but wouldnt the biddin tell you somebody has got to lead a D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Brian Short is very experienced, he will put that one behind him quickly|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: a risky balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: (we celebrated his 60th birthday back in december)|pg||
nt|idc: At matchpoints at least - oplaying teams you have to make a try|pg||
nt|hedyg: i could open the N hand weak 2@s as @s+ minor |pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to say who would get how high|pg||
nt|santyclz: 21-19 with  the 19 doing all the bidding.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 22-18?|pg||
nt|santyclz: 22-18 rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: shure he's only a youngfella|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes indeed, but Soouth could have been leading into the A@d|pg||
nt|capercliff: with Qx in dummy|pg||
nt|idc: Mind you, since this should go -2, perhaps something to be said for not inviting|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Penton borrows opp CC and heads to the Leads section|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like after a 2@s opening EW never enter the bidding|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|paulhac:  Wonder why North passed|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jtr: Declarer started well next door but ran out of steam|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead best    difficult to find|pg||
nt|ady: diamond tricks now gone|pg||
nt|jtr: Eventually losing 2@hs and 3@cs|pg||
nt|ady: 3 clubs seems odd    would have tht 2 clubs and 3 hearts |pg||
nt|idc: As one of you notes, West didn't break the transfer, so some maximum hands for spades can be excluded|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: even this 13 doesn't feel very max, feels more min|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: well why did N double without trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Maybe north thought partner was void, if it had been a fit jump|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: he thought he could beat 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: he didn't give much thought to bidding anything|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jtr: West made the 10 and East 2 |pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: just a s a matter of curiosity does nobody look for a minor slam any more|pg||
pc|h7|nt|capercliff: he dooubled them out of @h, felt obliged to double @s as well:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh, my reason was better|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|idc: Yes - would play fine opposite xx or Ax in hearts, but not opposite most holdings there|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: current Senior World Champion  but playing with Paul Hackett, i think|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jtr: Play will be similar here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzfv: he looked less than impressed with 5@h, I must say|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzfv: (Short)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely guaranteeing tricks outside the trump suit|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but he was only 59 then|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not even the slightest try|pg||
nt|hedyg: are they playing with screens?|pg||

mb|4H|an|possible 2nd round control|nt|pjs_ch: yes but very awkward bid for Hallberg - what woudl you bid with his hand?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: the card says 1430 and he explained it as 1|pg||
mb|4N|nt|yo_yo: I suppose sheridan was hoping for @HA  then it's on a finesse|pg||

pc|h3|nt|pjs_ch: what typing !! must do better  !!1|pg||

nt|pjs_ch: the slam hand on B2 was a flat board, with the same 5@C contract in the other room|pg||
nt|capercliff: these hands can always be tricky|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Short: "off 2 aces?" (shakes head)|pg||
nt|idc: 1NT not that unlikely a contract, could easily be a flat board|pg||

pc|c3|nt|capercliff: does everyone have agreements in their partnerships about these 2 doubles?|pg||

nt|jcomyn: my only agreement is I dont play weak NT|pg||
nt|idc: When it perhaps just about is worth something|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: looks like a keycard sequence here|pg||

mb|1C|an|16+|nt|ady:  possible to go down in 4 hearts or 4@S   if defence takes the 2 club tricks|pg||

nt|santyclz: Paul Heitner:  There are no 9 card suits...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|an|trump ask (?)|nt|vugraphzfv: Holland borrows Silverstone's alert card - none in his box|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@H = min - in this case extremely min, may stop pd from slam investigation|pg||
nt|jcomyn: same|pg||
nt|yo_yo: off the hook....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i would have been interested in the penalty score here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 800, I think, might be 1100|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my methods similarly wouldnt be able to punish|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Walddk1-14 have given up regarding Thursday through Sunday next week. 10 nations, 26 tables, 107 sessions inside 4 days|pg||
nt|yo_yo: usually 3@H stronger than 4, maybe playing 4 card majors they prefer to bid this way|pg||
nt|ianmcc: oh dear|pg||
nt|capercliff: too much to ask to enter now for East, South could have a very good hand and North has a limit hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: feels like South rather endplayed into that|pg||
mb|3C|an|5 to 1 honour (?)|nt|vugraphzfv: Goodman reminds himself about leads - "2nd & 4th"|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N is a pretty good contract really|pg||
nt|capercliff: and can be made I think|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not this time|pg||
nt|capercliff: but not today|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Short gets some water as Goodman makes his plan|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if declarer plays @CJ it will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: NS went rather quietly there|pg||
nt|santyclz: No x by n?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: ohhhh|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: North is playing the hand from last time, his real hand is in the slot!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: and we realise when he leads @dK !!|pg||
nt|idc: I love it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: TD is here ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: "The hand seemed vaguely familiar..."|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh, he's managed to pick out the board 8 hand I think|pg||
nt|idc: I always tell my beginners' classes not to feel that experienced players are gods|pg||
nt|idc: this will be another anecdote to add to my already huge collection :)|pg||
nt|idc: That explains why no bids from North|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: ok, board annulled, 3 IMP to EW and we move on to board 8|pg||
nt|idc: I guess N-S have missed 4@h as a result|pg||
nt|hedyg: Heitner was wrong, there are!|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I think he knew partner had another trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 2@s and 3@c alerted but I'm no Precision expert|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|capercliff: if Goodman plays the J@c will W cover?|pg||

nt|Walddk1: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if Im opened 1H vul on that w hand I would be crucified - by my partner|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree but many think 1 aces and a King make for a compulsory opening|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 aces i mean|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and to be fair he simply said "Brilliant defence"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Hallberg folds hand up, ponders|pg||

nt|yo_yo: we believe you :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: he needs to find @HQ   |pg||
nt|paulhac:  Played by the right hand as it goes off on a club llead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk1: No you are not!|pg||
nt|jtr: Hope you analyse better than 2-14:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Why the pause?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: 2N was not GF for this pair, which means they must allow 3@H as minimum|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what clues does he have?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can imagine John's comment if this goes down|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: fact of no trump lead might point him the right way|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: John looks in very good mood, can't imagine a bad comment if it goes down :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: If he manages to count the hand, he will play S for @HQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@s may be a trump asking bid with 3@c showing 5 to 1 top honor.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|capercliff: on the surface it may be the right play anyway, unless playing for a stiff Q|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pjs_ch: but he can survive misguessing because the clubs are 33 and spade loser goes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: millions wouldn't|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: fairly likely explanation, thanks Joe - they do play asking bids|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: declarer thinking about 4-1 spade split|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he must play 2 anyway surely?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: along the lines of "hard luck pd?" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: perhaps he'll try and get defence to open trumps somehow?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he'll wonder why North led from a dangerous Kxxx now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think that's the normal thing to do , bad luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: that's an odd return given he should have full count|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|jcomyn: dangerous though|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: yes    but likely thinking ahead what can be done if 4-1|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: he might be more worried about hearts-41 and he can only cope with that if South has length|pg||
nt|mcarroll: stating the obvious , how do I avoid a @H ;loser as 2 @S losers pretty inevitable|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: only one spade loser - one goes on club|pg||
pc|h7|nt|santyclz: That's from the original version of Precision.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: well you might lead CJ and see if there is any flutter on your left|pg||

mb|2H|nt|capercliff: Short will have to pin the (@s I think, will he find it?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: maybe dixon not sure if it's a 5 card suit opposite|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: needs @SK and another now|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: to cut off the heart suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: indeed, it could well be 4@s with @d in South hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that would be the defence of the year |pg||
nt|ianmcc: what about the third @h?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  North underbidding and South makes up for him|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@C, ruff a small @D and play J@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: would @s8 lead work better?|pg||
nt|hedyg: cross ruffs after discarding 2@ss is the other option|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Because he had good spades and they play 4 card Majors|pg||

mc|12|nt|idc: It may not spell doom to 4@h, that's true|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: normal contract-making service resumed :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: on board 7 3N was played from the North hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Dew returns and play resumes|pg||
nt|capercliff: and on the K@s lead from E(ducked) he had a swith to find|pg||
nt|idc: I guess both @d honours onside but clubs wrong would have made his line work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Board 8 will be played in the OR, and Mike Amos will rule (if he needs to) after that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3NT possible for EW so it was a good bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR has finished|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: 13 away|pg||
nt|hedyg: last match in 45 minutes|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|4H|nt|ady: 4 of either major doomed if defence cash their 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but what now|pg||
mb|5C|nt|capercliff: 12 rather|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we're on our own in CR now, both the other matches have finished|pg||
nt|capercliff: i wonder if the South hand is worth a 2@h bid here in the passout seat?|pg||
nt|idc: Ok, for these last 3 Bds of the match, we have scores from the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: South more likely to lead one than North|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: yes best|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 2@d is alerted - presumably some form of raise|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3NT amazing|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: they did well in the otehr room reaching 3N, which makes if either major runs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: horrible duplicated distribution in the minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I wonder if 3N makes with some strange squeeze-endplay on E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: see if Unia can keep up the good work|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no   cant|pg||
nt|jtr: Not a success|pg||
nt|ady: not an unreasonable shot   but will cost 2 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: good time to make a coffee, if you're so inclined|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ianmcc: this gives him an alternative line|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: The last match will likely feature the leaders in some form, to be decided|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a real Guessem hand|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: identiical bidding !|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzfv: perhaps I'm double-dummy|pg||
nt|idc: The Welsh SOuth in 4@h other room rather mangled the play - took wrong route back to hand at end, forgetting that West had bid spades I think|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: in the other room an initial spade lead means S had to cash his AKQ and that set up 5 tricks for East|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how do we see how other matches are going|pg||
nt|idc: 4@h should really make|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: if there is one|pg||
nt|mcarroll: There isnt |pg||
nt|yo_yo: John has to avoid being end played|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: his only concern is if spades don't run; if he cashes his hearts he sets up a 5th trick for|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: the defence so that never makes the contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what does e discard on hearts|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pjs_ch: what declarer doesn't know is that they can never get to the fifth heart|pg||

mb|1D|an|11-15, 2+!d|nt|yo_yo: just 2 bad boards for the scots  |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: big chance for scotland|pg||
nt|idc: The N-S hands fit well enough that 5@c is a decent spot, but not easy to reach|pg||
nt|idc: 3NT not as good, but makeable too with the @h blockage|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3nt with the @hs blocked.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 67+ IMP is 25-0, 39+ IMP 25-5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i missed the first 3NT   and cant see the hand records in the OR |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 3 imps for all that effort |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|capercliff: interesting splinter|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wires crossed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: splinter it says|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: CC says 1@h-3@s = "SPL" and I assume North can ask which suit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Might be in any suit - but still dubious with a void rather than a singleton|pg||
nt|capercliff: ah right, any splinter|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 1@h-4 any = void|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: so I wonder why he didn't bid 4@d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes 3nt shouild be one off|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh yes 4 @S winners and A@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: unlike Michael to miss the play of a hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: yes and that would keep them to 4h i guess|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Nowhere near slam too much action|pg||
nt|idc: I see the well played 4@h on Bd 10 actually made an overtrick in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: this and one more here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT is a positive bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: where we going now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Short's asking himself that question|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: the explanation is "15-17, clubs & spades"|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: seems a strong Precision 2@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice E preferred it to 1 @H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|capercliff: I dont see any eason for South not to start with 1@s on this hand|pg||
nt|capercliff: reason even|pg||
nt|jcomyn: trying to make the game difficult|pg||
nt|capercliff: or 2N perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Short looks baffled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: goodman gave up a bit early here|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 6 tricks in sight|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Simpson asks about leads - 3rd & 5th|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzfv: grr, sorry all, connection dropped for a mo|pg||
nt|jcomyn: probabvly saying - what the heck has he got|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yo_yo: not a bad game  but club ruff takes it off|pg||
nt|capercliff: now it is very muddy|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, w made the same low @d lead from hand, north ducked and s ruffed the 2nd @d...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: ooof|pg||
nt|idc: It's understandable SOuth stops in 3@c - it is North's singleton @h and AJx @d that makes his hand good|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely he can bid again|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs to find 3 tricks in @C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: still ok if guesses the h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ianmcc: defence has to be careful|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: so much for convention cards, I have one in front of me and it says "splinter, 4 new void"|pg||
nt|capercliff: i have a feeling this is going to make.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but Short has explained 3@s = "void somewhere"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah go eaqsy on them they have only 10 clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Paul claimed pronto giving three tricks :)|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: looks sunk now|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Needed to play for !q9x onside.|pg||
