nt|noodle:  good morning George, Shirley|pg||
nt|daman: NS must be careful not to give East a Club pitch on the @H King     they have to take their tricks in order|pg||
nt|hawe45:  IÂ´m a little late - due to pc-problems... see you...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Pekka, Povl and Geoffrey|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  oops...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: have we a problem|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can't appreciate N's switch, but supposingly, he has a reason for it. |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now it's up to E|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the obvious reason is to cut off the dummy, but having decent @c trick, why doesn't N retrurn partner's suit - @d?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|passell: looks like deutch had his rose colored glasses on here|pg||
nt|gulyas: really, a simple double followed by a cue sould have been enough|pg||
nt|gulyas: or at least pass the 4@S|pg||
nt|passell: might have defended 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|bessi2: unfortunately we didn't get to see Larsen's decision over 2@h dbl|pg||
nt|gulyas: its only 500|pg||
nt|bessi2: I prefer pass,  but it is by no means automatic in my view|pg||
nt|passell: against 450 or 420|pg||
nt|sybarra: got off to ok lead for n/s |pg||
nt|sybarra: gave nothing away |pg||

pc|h5|nt|roswolf: ah he didnt play the ace|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hello all.|pg||
nt|taliga: We start the second section with a dull 4@h|pg||
nt|taliga: Hi Rodal|pg||
pc|hT|nt|passell: his only legitimate make is both dia honors onside|pg||
nt|passell: or catching 3 spades in the weak 2 bidders hand|pg||
nt|psyck: At this vul, 2@h-x-pass could well be the favorite|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree|pg||
nt|daman: I would have played a low @H towards the King at trick 2   while I still had the @S entry|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly would force S to make a quick decision |pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no problem in 3nt either but then E dopesnt know that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: everything works|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi John|pg||
nt|chick: well, double dummy it does :)   the club finesse doesn't|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: with the cards this favorable game might conceiveably be made|pg||
nt|daman: ouch|pg||
nt|daman: mind you   it would have probably come to this in the end game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's RR stage in 2 groups, winner of each group qualifies for the final|pg||
pc|hA|nt|passell: looks like down 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: he could make with W having 3631, and @SJ9 doubleton in E|pg||
nt|passell: yes exactly or both dia onside and east forgetting to cover the 9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: welcom -- sorry for the slightly late start|pg||
nt|granguru: Jan Paulissen, also a WIM, is ranked 161. started in 1990 becoming 7th in the 12th youth european championship|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|gulyas: cash 2 trumps, and cash all @Hs, ruffing 2 @Ds in hand|pg||

nt|granguru: there are 2 swedish wrangs in the rank..frederik and thomas..who is now playing?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: could learn from the seniors last week especially Paul Hackett|pg||

nt|hawe45:  IÂ´m back - which my two special frienmde "the doctorÂ´s" will deeply regret (N/S...)|pg||

mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Welcome to all 8 spectators!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We'll be live soon|pg||
nt|karesz:  4 @h by NS?|pg||
nt|daman: East was a bit too heavy for a Flannery opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For sure - he didÂ´nt want partner to take tricks|pg||
mb|1S|an|0-9|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mark and Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You'll get more, don't worry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This was the last table up because the operator opened an invisible one by mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's why we don't have a result on board 1 entered|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and no names yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Susan will catch up, eventually, please be patient|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Sometimes best if no one knows your name|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@s will be no picnic for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now names|pg||
nt|bessi2: at least -3 it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Except Diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All good now, thanks Susan|pg||
nt|passell: with a club lead and dia return east has to find the heart shift|pg||
nt|roswolf: a filthy opening even 3rd in hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 2/1 for N-S, Precision for E-W|pg||
nt|bessi2: good decision by Diamond to pass 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 13-15|pg||
nt|puncher99: choice of lebensol or neg x here|pg||
nt|taliga: NS overcall very agressively|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sommer: more ketchup?|pg||
nt|puncher99: may be playing better minor lebensol|pg||
nt|rodal f: A partscore to come if not EW want to play with there @S color.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: missing a pass operator|pg||
nt|karesz:  1 NT 11-14|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not anymore.|pg||
nt|sybarra: be lucky you are blasted off of bbo for using that word.|pg||
nt|daman: is 3@D a transfer bsck to @Hs?|pg||
nt|sybarra: >if you are not blasted off |pg||
nt|daman: Roland took it on the chin recently   I had a lot of Flanneryites with me when commentating|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E cashed 2 last tricks|pg||
mb|2D|nt|frankaus: making |pg||
nt|karesz:  did you bid 3 NT by N?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: killing lead|pg||
nt|karesz:  yes!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No never! 3@h for me|pg||
nt|taliga: so N decision of bidding 4@s immediately is a bit strange for me|pg||
nt|rodal f: Luckely no X.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: thx|pg||
nt|gulyas: weird lead|pg||
nt|passell: yes  very aggressive against this bidding|pg||
nt|bessi2: I like it.. his prospects with jx in @s aren't very exciting|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I would probably have lead a @c myself... a @h is out of the question in my view|pg||
nt|passell: I also like a club|pg||
nt|passell: diamond in a way makes the defense fool proof|pg||
nt|roswolf: going for the throat|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 76 e/w in the other room bid and made 3nt for a 7 imp pickup|pg||
nt|granguru: frederic in fact.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: i fancy defence here|pg||
nt|puncher99: low diam off table south should play king|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Pekka Viitasalo|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ben Thompson|pg||
nt|benjent: Hi everybody|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day ben|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: sorry -- we had some difficulties setting up but should be good to go now -- welcome all|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi|pg||
nt|puncher99: south is wondering who has spade k|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with max 14 points on opener.....|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gulyas: yes, cannot go wrong now|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 8 tricks here...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: might make 3 on the same lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher99: or how to untangle suit if pard has it|pg||
nt|bagman: S should play the Q in most cases (except when the lead is singleton)|pg||
nt|taliga: son only 200 :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, declarer gets an easy life|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: very fine bid by Hampson|pg||
nt|roswolf: about to have some with my dinner|pg||
nt|taliga: so|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E finds @c lead, even Fantoni will be hopeless|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gulyas: on a @C lead, a @D return looks natural, and E has to find the @H switch|pg||
nt|passell: after a club lead west should return a trump to make things easier for partner later in the hand|pg||
nt|karesz:  wow!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S could be hardly blamed for spade opening lead - but if one respects the opps, (s)he makes imagi nation working|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This board confirms, that you should have better suit quality for 2 @S - the @C-lead would have been better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, if 1@s bid doesn't show spades, this lead seems normal, but still, declarer has a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gulyas: bd 16 they did pass 2@Hx, collecting the mentioned 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the @S may easily block but declarer runs out of tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: He just needs to see what developes after that|pg||
nt|puncher99: now is the key play|pg||
nt|bagman: N can duck also, I think, if S plays low|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a little help from my friends.....|pg||
pc|sT|nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|viren169: and probably a flat bd|pg||
pc|h5|nt|passell: the contract on the 1st hand was indeed 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 12 to Diamond, taking the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes playing on diamonds brings home the bacon|pg||
nt|daman: this is a lot different lead than the @C Ace and King|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he cashes @H's might come home now in ruffing mode |pg||
pc|h9|nt|puncher99: its easier to cover the j then to play the king with low one led|pg||
nt|chick: a threatening lead, but 8 tricks off the top now|pg||
nt|granguru: is ranked 3454 and has 6 MPs ...partner in not registered yet. |pg||
pc|h4|nt|bagman: N cashes the spade and switches according to S's suit preference|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good move! W may be afraid of leading @c now|pg||
nt|vbman: l think its auto now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's really hard for defenders, to find right swith at the earlier stage|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vbman: he will play a cl|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bagman: If heart, declarer wins that, plays the @DA and and later pushes the @CQ thru south|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a series of avoidance type plays|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much for Diamond to play, but the cards are very friendly and he' s very likely to make the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: a very quiet bd in the other room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: only a d causes any problem|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen:  "Everything is working - running out of finesses"|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: When S starts thinking, Diamonds hopes get up|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he only needs the @DK to drop :) (so that he can get back to dummy to cash his namesakes)|pg||
nt|puncher99: hand much harder to  play if diam K was played at trk3|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H as a good raise or ask for @H hold a better bid. At least a stop in 3@S|pg||
nt|daman: this is a strange way to play it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E sold red two-suiter and spade stopper, so he's short in @c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now @c danger persuades declarer to play @h form top dropping the Q|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzge: sorry|pg||
pc|c5|nt|granguru: Frederic started to play for sweden in 1984 at the 9th youth european championship in Hasselt|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|benjent: Faith in his partner - expecting a chunky hand at vul vs not|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but, as a lot of kibs suggested, what should W do, if he's going to beat the contract|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bagman: Making an overtrick in the endgame|pg||
nt|roswolf: is west really thinking?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: Well played.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s8|pc|cT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Now @H is safe if it was 4-2|pg||
nt|granguru: he used to play with Martin de Kneiff. Sylvan is a replacement althought they have played together a lot of times|pg||

nt|bagman: Might have some communication problems in NT with heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room e/w never got to grips with the hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|benjent: No way is Hampson going to sit for that|pg||

nt|taliga: 1n is semiforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: rehi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: 2@D looks like a limited 3 suiter|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed,  one of my two favorite opening bid conventions|pg||
nt|chessmaste: With N/S cold for 5@D this is not par so far|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is easy watching all 4 hands. but imo Larsen should protect here,  |pg||
nt|bessi2: could be disastrous, but you lose to many partscore swings by passing I think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps, and certainly if South is allowed to pass with this type of hand|pg||
nt|benjent: 3NT was bad news for Hampson (wasted @d card in his partner's limited hand) and he's sensibly focussing on game|pg||
nt|bagman: But they have lots of cards and a reasonable diamond fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes fortune will favor the brave here|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: TD is here because of the last board i think, so it takes a little bit more time...|pg||

pc|c3|nt|gulyas: 5@D the only making game|pg||

nt|frankaus: green V gren saves not real value|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@D looks like a good contract|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman writing questions to Cohen, but I can't quite make it out - sorry|pg||
nt|bagman: Grand is possible but on a trump lead it might be a bit tricky to play|pg||

nt|bagman: Or pass the @ST and then draw trumps |pg||
nt|daman: he needs to bring the @Cs home for 1 loser|pg||

nt|passell: club now|pg||

nt|jtmckee: he must duck this else the d has 5 tricks|pg||

nt|sommer: ..and 7 it was|pg||
nt|roswolf: OK SOUTH JUST BID IT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen " I've got some holes" Smith: "you've got some too?"|pg||
nt|bagman: THis might take some time|pg||
nt|sommer: N has to take a few deep breaths...but the lucky lie of the cards may help him through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen thinks so too - he's gone for coffee :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well we can see both ordinary finesses work|pg||
nt|bagman: There are 11 tricks with one ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: remember..S has no entry after @Hfinesse!|pg||
nt|roswolf: and i dont see how he can avoid taking at least 1|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might win this in dummy and then take the ordinary spade finesse and hope to ruff down the king|pg||

nt|roswolf: and now another teaser|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Meanwhile Diamond picked up on 67 when their South made a more successful lead (@h) against 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond increasing his lead nicely|pg||
nt|bagman: W knows what to do with solid diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: another 3nt|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi Gabor and welcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: last two boards for this round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - 1 for Turkey, North had a "difficult lead"...!|pg||
nt|vbman: no room f or a queen|pg||
nt|udo: now, first imps for monaco  ?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|3D|nt|swanson: Bad spelling.|pg||
nt|taliga: some action hopfully|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6nt on S  or any minor slam|pg||
nt|karesz:  nice 1 NT|pg||
nt|karesz:  11-14 no sibgleton|pg||
nt|karesz:  n|pg||
nt|taliga: 6m and 5M is systemic|pg||
nt|karesz:  but not both|pg||
nt|taliga: :)|pg||
nt|taliga: 11-14|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some also use. Agree with u|pg||
nt|rodal f: The 12-14NT again|pg||
nt|udo: but even in 4 @S u have to find the @h jack|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfj: thanks, John|pg||

nt|taliga: GF relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: back again|pg||
nt|karesz:  gameforcing relay|pg||
nt|karesz:  :)|pg||
nt|taliga: 1n - 3n ?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bagman: In unfriendly game a proper comment by NS might put EW to tilt |pg||
nt|taliga: yap, I was slow|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The defence can hardly have tested declarer her - more or less throwing the overtricks after him|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: 2@C - must be a Transfer|pg||
nt|karesz:  younger is faster|pg||
nt|taliga: shorter is faster :)|pg||
nt|taliga: EW has lost their 10 card spade fit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@s is a good save against any slam|pg||
mb|4S|nt|benjent: Not everyone responds with Kranyak's hand, but on average it's the right action|pg||
nt|rodal f: 11-14NT also at vul for NS?|pg||
nt|taliga: very common bidding :)|pg||
nt|taliga: yes, always|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: tkx|pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: :) thanks|pg||
nt|granguru: I remind you to register hand 7 to play it yourself afterwards..a good declarer play practice...you shoud make 5@S. |pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Greco could almost bid 1NT without looking at his hand|pg||
nt|bagman: Not much in play here; declarer loses two hearts and the spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen played very quickly from dummy and Moss said "too fast" - so Cohen waited a moment and then played and Moss said "still too fast" Cohen: "sorry"|pg||
nt|sommer: a practical 4@S from N..and he's awarded with 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sommer: quite lucky, but ok|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much N can do; he either makes this or not (losing to 4-1 spades or uppercut/overruf)|pg||
nt|sommer: it's only around 33% but 4@S is "the bid"|pg||
nt|bagman: If E cashes a heart and plays a club; N might wonder weather to play @SK from hand or go to dummy and play a spade to pick up A singleton onside and risk diamond ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman took the @h A out, but now has folded his hand up again|pg||
nt|bagman: 1@H looks like no 5M, no 6m with positive values|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|roswolf: as before|pg||
nt|jtmckee: and the Mississippi State Bulldog shuts down the bronk bombers|pg||
nt|taliga: The weak no trump makes life hard for both pair here|pg||
nt|taliga: E couldnt introduce majors, |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South willlead @S Ace - to teach partner...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bessi2: hmm.. had to cancel my speech regarding the play in 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: can't read the notes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a wild guess. Easier if S had a natural @c opening|pg||
nt|taliga: N couldn't bid his hand or ask anything from partner|pg||
nt|karesz:  Hegedus as brave poiceman!|pg||
nt|taliga: After a bid like this, you lead like after gambling 3N: your ace |pg||
nt|taliga: this case... it was not very succesfull...|pg||
nt|taliga: only club would have been good|pg||
nt|chick: is the 1@H transfer?|pg||
nt|udo: same start other room, but than north did to much|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|benjent: Double seems a bit optimistic with no @c pips|pg||
nt|gowdy: and the world is good !|pg||
nt|cicus: trying for the ruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: That was a funny lead. A @D and 10 now 11|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y:)|pg||
nt|cicus: I was just considering whether a small @D is indicated here instead of the Q|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would think so|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well, South pushed the boat out with 2@H and has now left his ship in the harbour. 4@H would have had chances - this has none |pg||
nt|gulyas: this will not test declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: a trump lead would have prolonged the play|pg||
nt|sommer: @H for @C's?|pg||
nt|viren169: West didnt raise because East is limited|pg||
nt|viren169: 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|vbman: some end plays|pg||
pc|s2|nt|benjent: The 2nd @c trick gets Greco up to 6, and the @s finesse will make it 7|pg||
nt|benjent: No problem getting the @d suit right when North has bid both blacks|pg||
nt|jtmckee: yes it is|pg||
nt|cicus: now no headaches for declarer|pg||
pc|s9|nt|passell: looks like he will make this|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond play is not that risky as if there was a diamond ruff hangin, the defense might have gone for that|pg||
nt|sommer: @H2..|pg||
nt|roswolf: creaking to the obvious contract|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bagman: This is the best lead and declarer might have some difficulties as he's probably giving up a club |pg||
nt|bagman: then a diamond back and defense set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: win and lead a heart following with the club finesse looks very natural|pg||
nt|gowdy: note the lead @H 2  so S thinks  they are 44 or W has the length|pg||
nt|jtmckee: yes  he will knock out the wrong entry first and regret it later|pg||
nt|gowdy: rite @C to the A  then a @D hook|pg||
nt|karesz:  13 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: if you are using the web version of BBO it is easy to record them in your prefered hands file|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bessi2: imo,  both are to blame for this contract|pg||
nt|granguru: I think GIB analyses the play trick by trick if you want it|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|bagman: A low diamond now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|taliga: double dummy analysis, as always... |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|passell: 5 with any lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyhow E see the AXX at N and will use the K for a new if W lead Q@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: I'm sorry, they played too fast for me :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: I'm out|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: we all know that operator is the toughest job of all here|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: I need a brake ;-)|pg||
nt|granguru: And Lucas did it wonderfully|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: thanks John :)|pg||
nt|granguru: well just one more board for this set ...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: and I had also preferred to show both majors as E|pg||
pc|s8|nt|passell: the nine of clubs was a good card to see|pg||
nt|benjent: Cashing the @d's to squeeze some unhappy discards out of Wolpert|pg||
nt|sommer: @SQ and claim|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer is more or less forced to play clubs from hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|benjent: That @c pitch from Wolpert tells Greco he only had 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: on last hand inother room, they played 1N making 2, so 10 IMPs to Deutsch|pg||
nt|taliga: 2N?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|benjent: No way is he ditching tricks from a 6 card suit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jtmckee: and dancingly down he went|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|passell: if he had kept his spades a low spade shift would have beaten it|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: depends on the 2@d bid from N|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|udo: @H now needed|pg||
nt|vbman: down?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtmckee: diamond team hitting on all cylinders|pg||
nt|taliga: pure game force|pg||
pc|h8|nt|passell: 2 clubs 2 hearts 3 spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11 tricks fir the taking|pg||
nt|vbman: another nail in the coffing nunes must be thinkng|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bagman: This is a bit risky, IMO as the losing heart finesse and heart back puts declarer in a bad position|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|bagman: with Kx in clubs onside and Jx of hearts onside this contract could not have gone down|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: brb in 10 min|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: now Macskasy is complaining about the lead|pg||
nt|cicus: the lead cost only 1 trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: yes, they also agreed in it|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|benjent: This is the 3rd time NS have found a pushy double of EW this set ... and they've made every time|pg||
nt|benjent: Just 1 I think - South will end up taking the last 2 tricks|pg||
nt|benjent: Sorry, last 1 trick :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: he did keep it down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss was thinking about overtaking the club, so Smith showed his hand and asked "how do I do?"|pg||
nt|sommer: dangerous partial now|pg||

nt|jbgood: E W do actually play transfers after 1@c...|pg||
nt|vbman: even more here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: danger lurks|pg||
nt|sommer: even 1NT EW is far too high|pg||
nt|cicus: N may interfere|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|benjent: And then Greco mis-guessed the spades on the low spade through|pg||
nt|sommer: 1@S best for NS|pg||

nt|rodal f: Good pressed|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sommer: nope|pg||
nt|bagman: Having opened subminimum, W is reluctant to X|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: I find that surprising - obviously didn't expect much from Wolpert's X|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|chessmaste: Yes, but their side is leading 31-14!|pg||
nt|bagman: S checking if everybody has same coloured cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Smith: "no blue" (the RDBL bidding card is blue :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup and the vampires gather for the feast|pg||
nt|sommer: -2 or.MAYBE only -1..so not too expensive|pg||
nt|sommer: crossruff!..and @Dfinesse gives a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S scores 3 trump tricks and N the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: Cohen probably disapointed after the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: but in the other room i doubt e/w will be in game|pg||
nt|bagman: @CA, @S to !K|pg||
nt|sommer: @SA + 3 @Htricks is the strange outcome of best play|pg||
nt|taliga: knowing him well, he was considering that :)|pg||
nt|karesz:  good save in open at former board|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: last board for this round, i hope to see you at 20:30 CET for round 4|pg||
nt|udo: or duck to hand @C to ace, @C to 10|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bessi2: @d J,  @c to the jack and queen,  east better play another @d there otherwise easy 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Then if N ducks, diamond finesse and another spade|pg||
nt|cicus: E took an aggressive but sensible road|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: everyone's asking Macskasy about his bid:)|pg||
nt|cicus: oh just noticed E has only 1 @C so 11 tricks can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: they're just telling him, that it was an overbid|pg||
nt|granguru: excellent lead|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|passell: 3hearts was not the winning decision here|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 13 trs|pg||
nt|granguru: :(|pg||
nt|mcarroll: m|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ybob: 11 tricks anyway if they play in @H, only 10 in @S|pg||
nt|taliga: (ok, not long clubs, but distributional hand anyway)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ybob: he can pich @D on 3th @C too|pg||
nt|ybob: probably only 10|pg||
nt|ybob: playing 4@S he plays trump at trick 2|pg||
nt|ybob: A@D and trump|pg||
nt|vbman: yes easy when doube dummy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|passell: dbl or pass or even 2nt woulda worked out|pg||
nt|roswolf: dd i think maybe -2|pg||
nt|bagman: here declarer can afford to play the heart and take the club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense cannot take enough tricks to strip squeeze declarer to anything harmful|pg||
nt|cicus: I like 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In theory we are back in 7 minutes with Sweden vs Netherlands|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Expect a delay|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: thanks for watching, thanks for the commentators|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|udo: sure|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chessmaste: East is after an entry in the Bulletin - except there isn't one|pg||
nt|vbman: no entry now|pg||
nt|vbman: so small is a must|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sommer: I agreed to that -2|pg||
nt|bagman: W eloping with the small trumps; he knows the hearts are likely to be 5-0|pg||
nt|roswolf: re|pg||
nt|sommer: The Italian waiter struck again!!|pg||
nt|bagman: The club ruff was too early as S can discard a diamond on the next club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sorry, slightly flakey internet connection too - you'd think with 4 choices I could find one that was solid :)|pg||
nt|sommer: right..thats why it's -2 now|pg||
nt|sommer: you havent been a waiter in Italy, do you, Susan?:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N needs to take this and play a club for a diamond discard; if W wins this, he should take his two diamond tricks as long as he can|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Actually, this is Jan - I switched with Susan when we couldn't get Susan's computer on the internet; haven't been a waiter any place|pg||
nt|roswolf: natural to win i think|pg||
nt|sommer: ok:)|pg||
nt|bagman: S can hold @SK and QJT98 of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: We're at trick 5 now - did something not get through (still worrying about connection :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room the grand is being played in 4@H!!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: FROZEN AT TRICK 3|pg||
nt|sommer: "The Italian waiter" is a BBO "thing"...from a vue-graff in Italy some years ago, where a waiter fell over the pc cables and turned all off |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss deciding whether to take the diamond finesse - if he hadn't been doubled, of course he'd need it for 4 (losing 2 hearts and a spade) but doubled, he knows hearts aren't ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: breaking|pg||
nt|bagman: Diamond lucky in the grand hand because 4@H does not lose much more than 6@D would lose|pg||
nt|roswolf: jan what happened at t3 did north win @SA?|pg||
nt|bagman: That also shows why on IMPs dubious grands should not be bid; the opps might end up in game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: I'll keep playing out the hand and then if it doesn't get through to you, I'll have to close and start again and hope I can do better. But spade to A, Club Q on which S pitched a ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: diamond & W ruffed, diamond J winning, |pg||
nt|roswolf: TY JAN|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: big thanks to the commentators! :)|pg||
nt|udo: easy seeing all cards|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: calm waters|pg||
nt|taliga: so it is reasonable to give a shot|pg||
nt|daman: this is a crushing victory for Israel|pg||
nt|othered1: still needs a 9th, when north ducks next @C|pg||
nt|vbman: molva suggests n ducks|pg||
nt|udo: should have talen @S in hand|pg||
nt|udo: taken |pg||
nt|vbman: now good dia guess|pg||
nt|udo: still difficult|pg||
nt|vbman: give him 44 in sp and cl so shor in dia|pg||

nt|vbman: sp q was off the way|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|vbman: down now?|pg||
nt|udo: looks like|pg||
nt|vbman: but very difficult|pg||
nt|othered1: winning @S in hand, presumably to play @C to K then low back also faced some entry problems|pg||
nt|udo: guess he will try @D to 10 now ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 22:25 CET the next round begins|pg||
nt|vbman: l doubt if ns has the mind for that left|pg||
nt|udo: yes, ED , @H ace can than be removed|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bagman: Now the @S9 stops the spades and declarer holds enough tricks to make the contract|pg||
nt|bagman: Is he going to play a diamond up for an overtrick?|pg||
nt|roswolf: he probably should|pg||
nt|rodal f: The long @C came as an exsta premium anyway:)|pg||
nt|taliga: at least 4 :)|pg||
nt|taliga: (if not strong balanced)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not best minor?|pg||
nt|taliga: Better minor, yes. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Could then have 4-3-3-3 or?|pg||
nt|taliga: yes, but then he has to be strong|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|taliga: (15+)|pg||
nt|taliga: so finally I understood what you mean. The long club came as an extra premium..... yes, right :)|pg||
nt|taliga: I have to leave for 5 minutes, sorry|pg||
nt|vbman: king and a heart|pg||
nt|vbman: so we continue to respect you|pg||
nt|vbman: :))))|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: although it was an overbid, yes|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chessmaste: Simply cash the king of clubs now|pg||
nt|bessi2: what on earth can he be thinking about I wonder|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|benjent: Safety first ... don't risk @c ruffs by trying for the @s finesse|pg||
nt|caitlin: position of @CK helps|pg||
nt|daman: North and South were no on the same page at all|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bagman: cashout time|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: yes the best part of the game|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC%202011/11_06_01_team.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: for results|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: bye|pg||
nt|vbman: still not over|pg||
nt|othered1: GIB ( a peeker) would have made this hand in about 12 seconds, Fantoni willing, and be home having its oil changed before the next round.  But humans who have to work things out ...|pg||
nt|othered1: for themselves find it tougher|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bagman: also claim time, the defense cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|udo: interesting when he plays ace now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: t|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That is dreadful play by declarer|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bessi2: he fell for Platnick's ruse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: sorry I missed a diamond discard -- south came down to a stiff @D ace and a spade, so he won the @D ace and threw declarer inwith a spade to lead away from hisking of clubs|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vbman: l think first round duck or finese of cl was needed|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bessi2: I must agree with you there.. I am speechless|pg||
nt|darth: Fanotoni woul unblock knowing declarer does not have @H10 when he played the J|pg||
