nt|haans: Hi Björn|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1@C 12-16 unbal or 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Hi :)|pg||

nt|haans: EW Relypass @C 17+or 0-7|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Fridrik we start with a slam|pg||
nt|friggi: looks like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: i wonder if anyone would open the minimum number of diamonds allowed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a routine 4@s|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|zebutin: good day for everyone watching|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Routine 3NT for NS.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for running scores etc|pg||
nt|robinswr: by south|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 @S shd be universal here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi, this is a problem hand to bid with east|pg||
nt|ianmcc: best in NT!|pg||
nt|gmarco24: hi all  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Friggi, Ian and Marko|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: retract 4@S|pg||
nt|friggi: but they could go up to 7 |pg||
mb|2S|nt|grebrof: Norway is the defending champions from Lillehammer 2007 and they are also the current leaders|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|haans: dont understand 2@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: lead invating opening here|pg||
nt|jwit: Not that wild about multi bid on 5 card suit and weak hand vulnerable|pg||
nt|jwit: East let them off the hook|pg||
nt|friggi: but that would have been more fun for us:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nagic diamonds thus 1@S 8-12 can have longer minor|pg||
nt|haans: magic|pg||
nt|haans: good game with spades 3-3|pg||
nt|haans: NS play Carrot clubs|pg||
nt|bjurn:  W is probably worried about a misfit|pg||
nt|haans: helping EW avoid slamming|pg||
nt|jwit: Not likely to bid a slam anyway, however, without the 2D bid, 4H would have problems.  Now at least declarer will know spade suit is breaking badly.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi to all kibs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  running scores|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|haans: 8 tricks 9th in clubs?|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: interestingly they they have typed some of finnish players first names too, so from finland there are playing Pia Erkkilä and Hulda Ahonen, pair that plays strong club (15+)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: also welcome to Magnus|pg||
nt|haans: got that better |pg||
nt|haans: skipping bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Hans, Jon and Dan|pg||
nt|haans: odds against 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|grebrof: the norwegians are playing a natural system with 5 card majors - the finnish girls prefer a strong (+15hp) 1@c|pg||

nt|haans: vScore: http://landslagsbridge.se/ + Twitter|pg||
nt|grebrof: 12?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can make 12 tricks on the placement of cards.|pg||
nt|haans: hi Espen|pg||
nt|derric: hello again|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Not the best of suits to overcall 1@s but some would, especially if pd has not passed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  so he did not|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but will lead one|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: S took a rather passive view here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W can perhaps see, that 1@d is bid on a 4-card suit, so a small from dummy|pg||
nt|iceking: not sure i could play def vs 2@H here, though bidding is little strange also as you are not sure you have fitt anywere|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Gautis|pg||
nt|haans: Hej Roland Jon & Dan|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3NT is better|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Markku|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hello Markku|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so now 9 from top|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: hello, and good morning:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: He may be a bit biassed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wife playing as South|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is the winning contract - espescially now with the natural @d-lead from E|pg||
nt|fabsayc: explain|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  Kunne Ãst ikke have overmeldt med 4 Ru?|pg||
nt|grebrof: the norwegians are naturalists (besides the bery weak NT in nonvul 1st-3rd) opposite the more artificial approach from the finnish|pg||
nt|haans: finns Magic Diamond?|pg||
nt|grebrof: I have thai keyboard, so there is a chance for mistyping - bery = very|pg||
nt|haans: yes close for me 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: these two plays magid diamond . the other pair strong @c|pg||
nt|sharkey: I have the same problem Espen - not Thai but Thumbs....|pg||
nt|grebrof: lol|pg||
nt|grebrof: I will try to look before I post|pg||
nt|grebrof: back to the game...|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt  a make|pg||
nt|grebrof: this ended in a draw 15-15VP last meeting|pg||
nt|sharkey: Marianne Harding and Ann Karin Fuglestad are the anchor pair of the Norwegian team - many years international experience|pg||
nt|grebrof: duck a @D is a loser if @ds are QJ block, but will make 9 tricks anyhow|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|haans: no they have played Magic Diamond before here|pg||
nt|haans: say yesterday |pg||
nt|runnerup: no it is the other pair|pg||
nt|haans: :) ok|pg||
nt|jwit: Still a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|robinswr: I play 4@h as an artificial spade slam try |pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi Marko|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: any way safer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure that hand justifies it|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gautis2: figure i still not know her well enoghe since i dont have a clue what 3@h means:)|pg||
nt|haans: still done understand 3@C cards for only 2@S|pg||
nt|bjurn:  this should be makeable if W handles @H with only two losers|pg||
nt|haans: Johansson may get a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Hi Hans, Skafti|pg||
nt|haans: transfer (to NT) response|pg||
nt|robinswr: obvious they don't do that|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H better that 3Nt|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|iceking: was no rush for Ace of @D|pg||
nt|grebrof: hello Hans :)|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, and at least they got the play in the right hand. Diamond lead through East would make a difficult hand more difficult|pg||
nt|bridge_one: losing 1@h 1@S and 1@D need a good job to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @D can be discarded aver K@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need a correct timing|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  Hi - mys danish were just the daily exercises...|pg||
nt|iceking: low would keep better control af everything|pg||
nt|sharkey: undo?|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing special happened because ew has 8-9 trick in clubs |pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think declarer will use a cross ruff |pg||
pc|s2|nt|grebrof: Stine has had some very good results, so its about time she got her chance for the national team (gautis being biased or not)|pg||
nt|grebrof: she is NOT playing with you now my friend :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2NT may be with 5 hearts so bidding an error|pg||
nt|diaoff: Hi all|pg||
nt|haans: missed a trick |pg||
nt|haans: defense|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|zebutin: different openings from 1st/2nd hand and 3rd/4th for finnish pair, but from 1st and 2nd they play weak nt, and 1@D-1@S openings are 10-14 and 4card suit|pg||
nt|gautis2: :) ..well, cant argue with sucess, since 4@s was born to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=475&csm=Rank&nt=3&nb=1&csh=0000000000111|pg||
nt|Walddk5: running scores|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes - Harding - Fuglestad also was part of the team that won last time at Lillehammer in 2007|pg||
nt|cenglund:  SpA was hardly discarded|pg||
nt|sharkey: She really pitched @SA on @C lead operator?|pg||
nt|haans: spade ace|pg||
nt|haans: on lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: Finland 2009 was the last championships I am told (thanks Geo) - looking at the unions homepage, you might get tricked|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - E sh come in first to play a heart through|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I play as here, 4 @H 55 no slam ambitions|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: and S has been cought already after trick1|pg||
nt|iceking: not so odd open room reached 4@H-3, |pg||
nt|gmarco24: 4@h was a slam try? do they play std 1nt or weak?  :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: well its not MP|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|haans: Operator wake up :)|pg||
mc|11|nt|grebrof: and Rashed :)|pg||

nt|diaoff: Starting the chase|pg||
nt|jwit: Battle of major part scores here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: The dealing Gods are stuck|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so far so spades for W  :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: a well deserved lead too|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hawe45:  Anyway, ti was easier to play than to bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: good start for Norway avoiding the impossible 4@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: some kind of Multi...|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
nt|haans: very high in hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 if E doesnt get a spade ruff|pg||
nt|diaoff: Need to find the @S ruff to beat 6@H|pg||
nt|haans: now slamming|pg||
nt|grebrof: good slam|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 8-11|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S make 9 tricks at Nt without lead @h in this strange hand (make 5@S guessing to play J@S from dummy)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|haans: ??|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|zebutin: 1nt 15-17 from 3rd hand|pg||
nt|haans: easy make in 3nt at last board|pg||
nt|haans: very few will bid to slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: may be pushed if EW saves too much|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: no game|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dbl or 3 @H?|pg||
nt|derric: likely passed out|pg||
nt|peachy: Which is why 2NT is called the slamkiller, though was not last hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  running scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@s on NS|pg||
nt|iceking: good slam here |pg||
nt|iceking: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|grebrof: the +15 @c comes into action|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pass or Correct|pg||
nt|diaoff: 4NT now, maybe?|pg||
nt|haans: yep find it now|pg||
nt|jbgood: but of course difficult to know what to do on S's cards - doesnt know about the di void|pg||
nt|diaoff: If she passes, She will soon find out the possibility I guess|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 h has poschances -by w at least|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1@D 8-11 bal, 4M 4+m or 5-5ms|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1@H relay|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@H bal 4@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: some might overcall 2@h|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|psyck: lot of options for S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They finished in 5@c last deal in open after some relay bids with 3 rounds of @h for -1|pg||
nt|jbgood: one push - yes, she will be wiser if W prefers @d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a grand.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D alerted bec not forcing ( i suppose)|pg||
nt|haans: grossly overbidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: chose drury|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@C probably one way drury|pg||
nt|sharkey: If N can find a take out x now....|pg||
nt|haans: 1. Interview Fulvio Fantoni http://www.confsudbridge.org/hitsII/fantoni001i.aspx: If you had to choose a convention, which one would you pick?|pg||
nt|haans: 2. Fantoni: Gazzilli... is a convention that I think should be used by all who play natural bridge|pg||
nt|haans: 3. Gazzilli:  http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/public/1239625981_14209_FT0_gazzillind.pdf |pg||
nt|grebrof: 2@d showing +8hp (if Gazilli)|pg||
nt|friggi: no problems here|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bjurn:  2@S more relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@d showing a good opening with at least game interest|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D real opening,as i play myself here i would bid 3@D with north hand natural and slammish|pg||
nt|nubmaster: So a good start for Sweden here|pg||
nt|gautis2: partscore battle|pg||
nt|grebrof: as a guess I would think the dbl of 1@h from E is 5-7hp - their card says nothing about what "neg dbls" are|pg||
nt|gautis2: i guess x shows hp s not @s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: too complicated to remember Haans:)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D GF if strong|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is a game|pg||
nt|haans: puppet|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in contrary 1X is often a game killer passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6@D had been my choice|pg||
nt|jbgood: dbl seems a bit much? Prd is likely to have 10 minor cards...|pg||
nt|haans: scary|pg||
nt|haans: best for EW|pg||
nt|derric: ok, wouldn't re-open opposite 12-14NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@d a nice treatment there Magnus|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 3D/3H transfer nodays 3@C just showing max|pg||
nt|jbgood: so a doubled overtrick...|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree its a good convention - you rarely stop in 2@c anyway|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would for sure|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not much to lose, lots to gain|pg||
nt|runnerup: 800 -a game yes|pg||
nt|runnerup: and for nothing real game |pg||
nt|mmmakela: and Hulda did nice to pas(of course imo)|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok 500 |pg||
nt|mmmakela: although 4 @H might slip home this is a sure winner|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes nicely nosed to pass -good decision|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bidding duplicated in OR|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok that s for that winning then|pg||
nt|haans: in my opinion not cards for 1@S|pg||
nt|skaftij:  easy 4@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: puppet seq|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@h cheap|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ianmcc: 4@h seems to need to find @dQ, tho 4th @s could be useful|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no, 420|pg||
nt|ianmcc: in fact makes if no @c switch|pg||
pc|s7|nt|zebutin: in 4@H you would seem to lose 2 @S + @C, because spades are 3-3 you can throw one diamond to 4th spade|pg||
nt|zebutin: so might not need to quess diamond suit|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room finnish women played 2@S some down, there is magic diamond system in effect, that has 8-11 openings in 1st and 2nd hand, so makes often for different scores|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is a very good contract for NS|pg||
nt|haans: You can later read: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/public/1239625981_14209_FT0_gazzillind.pdf |pg||
nt|bjurn:  2NT 3433 or 34(42) (I think)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2NT =4@C (ty kibs)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@S 3424, 3 controls (A=2, K=1)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  so EW will probably end up in 4@S now|pg||
nt|haans: may go slamming?|pg||
nt|bjurn:  E needs @HA, @DK and @DA to be onside|pg||
nt|haans: clubs king in diamond|pg||
nt|bjurn:  or @DAK and @HA to be onside|pg||
nt|bjurn:  @SJxx @HQxxx @DAK @Cxxxx might be a picture|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or 2@D = 3@H support |pg||
nt|gmarco24: A@s>10@d or A@s>@c ?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|psyck: N will likely blast to slam in spite of missing a keycard|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Anyone who can tell us about the bidding here? 2NT like good/bad NT or something?|pg||
nt|haans: thats a "modern" weak 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl from N is good seing the layout|pg||
nt|jwit: Don't mind it non vulnerable at one level.  If nothing else, it is surely the suit you want led|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so to open 2 NT/ 1x is delicate business|pg||
nt|robinswr: this auction doesn't make sense to me. at some point someone has to limit their hand. also if there is no slam posibility then why describe your hands|pg||
pc|cK|nt|derric: good morning|pg||
pc|c5|nt|iceking: W made a very light 3rd seat opening in open room|pg||
nt|grebrof: can they count to 13?|pg||
nt|peachy: Current trend is to respond lighter than we did in the past so the 1x passed is less prominent danger|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mbruun:  THis aggressive lead will cost the defense a trick, and HQ another one, so all of a sudden nine tricks turned to eleven. No big deal in teams though |pg||
nt|haans: scoring blood|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@S is a mild slam try, if I remember correctly|pg||
nt|haans: do like that bidding :)|pg||
nt|haans: often you start with relays all ending in slam Then you get older|pg||
nt|haans: no good lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder what 5@s here was|pg||
nt|iceking: 4nt might be even number of aces |pg||
nt|psyck: oh Turbo|pg||
nt|iceking: at least it looks like it |pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably negative|pg||
nt|iceking: been told 4nt shows 3+aces|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, not Turbo then, just their own methods|pg||
nt|iceking: nicely done anyway |pg||
nt|nubmaster: well done here, both K and J in @s works so no trouble with Q of @h offside|pg||
nt|gautis2: not fan of 4@h  ..better to do an invitasional bid after 2@s ...not this "shot"|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is sometimes the problem with strong 1@c - in a contested auction like this, you dont always know if 2@s is a bid with 4 or 5 @ss - now they escaped|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe...|pg||
nt|sharkey: may escape with down 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice to see such a young table in a very strong competition like this|pg||
nt|haans: dont understand @DA now does Fuglestad know who has @DK and Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E can therefore 5NT.|pg||
nt|haans: yes that is true |pg||
nt|jwit: Great start for declarer|pg||
nt|haans: but with spades you can come in later|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S with 3A 4333 and opener up isn't so ortodoxe - better a inviting bid with raise (2N, 2@H depending on agreements)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|zebutin: good day Juho, its allready 14.00 in finland...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Juho, 2100 in Melbourne|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks and next|pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like one loser in each suit|pg||
nt|jwit: Not that easy if you are at the 3 level the next time it's your turn to bid|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mmmakela: boring no chance for 6 except dias lead and K|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H seems too much with no spade honour, and i would for sure bid slam with south hand as auction went|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dirty waters but ok this time|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gautis2: y, should  be 200|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - 4 nt told about 4 @ds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: EW play udca, 1st discard o/e|pg||
nt|bjurn:  wont be any problem to get 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@H i meant|pg||
nt|robinswr: lucky can't misguess diamonds|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|psyck: after Souths free bid & jump to 4@s, N could have also bid slam other table, but was tougher after opps intervention i guess|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that's telling them|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: :( :( :( Gazzilli :( :( :(|pg||
nt|grebrof: lol|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|mbruun:  Back to nine again. Interesting|pg||
nt|gautis2: board 1 was a coopy of 3NT, so well done to both teams|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like the overtrick has gone - much easier for us seeing all cards to make 12 of course|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: well done small @D by West ! playing K would lose a trick|pg||

nt|mmmakela: C 10 odd nmbr|pg||
pc|d4|nt|grebrof: otherwise I agree with not bidding 4@h (allthou it looks like P has a single @s) but P only made a single raise - guess they have ways to show a better raise - well, the ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: vulnerability is "right", so can understand 4@h too|pg||
nt|diaoff: Unless color blind, the opps also know the vulnerabilities, so I also vote for 6@D.|pg||
nt|haans: and play must be safe|pg||
nt|gmarco24: poor S is thinking about singleton K@d or Kx@d at W... only what works for him|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: best defense|pg||
nt|diaoff: Thats also easier from here than at the table though...|pg||
mc|10|nt|nubmaster: In Open Marie and Pia get to 4@h which seems to be doomed, especially when E lead a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was a bad play. return @cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and defence will have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not finessing @h first round... doesn't matter if E got the Q alone... E indicates both A and Q of @s because of the play|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ofc, Kxx is less likely|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, good shape, decent 5 carder, & useful touching honors in @c|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah - but as I said more than once in the first match between these: it is easier seeing all hands|pg||
nt|yuval10: not a bad contract at all, but very misfortune breaks|pg||
nt|haans: I|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree she could have bid 6@h on the way|pg||
nt|haans: VUGRAPH operator found it boring 2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if they lose CS by 1 imp might remorse|pg||
nt|skaftij:  lol|pg||
nt|robinswr: so maybe the 10 of clubs just denied the king|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mbruun:  I suppose 2D is a very light Multi, but Im not sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt be surprised, if East bids 3 NT here|pg||
nt|derric: pass by north?|pg||
nt|derric: i think they play precision|pg||
nt|zebutin: some would bid too, A + J109x seem quite nice values...no support for partner though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wondering. But not much for East - West|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@s was certainly possible|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - we will see|pg||
nt|sharkey: i think the hand was open then Espen - shud have read the ending|pg||
nt|haans: little weak for 3@H|pg||
nt|grebrof: the contract is wrong and there are more failures that awaits when you are there|pg||
nt|grebrof: normal frisky nonul opening from S|pg||
nt|sharkey: that is a WEAK 3@H....|pg||
nt|grebrof: I like it|pg||
nt|sharkey: been there - done that...:)|pg||
nt|haans: she had no perfect bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: N thinking slam?|pg||
nt|grebrof: as they said about Marty Bergens preempts like that: "It doesnt matter what you have, its still not good enough"|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@C-4@H |pg||
nt|haans: dirty 2@D|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@H is high enough here, loosing 2@S, 1@H, 1@D, 1@C|pg||
nt|haans: may not make 3@H|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mbruun:  Sounds reasonable|pg||
nt|haans: or 4NT -5@S-7@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|haans: the correct scoring never done here |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 @S anyone?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: spades lost now?|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would double with the north hand since i have four spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: S bid 4@S and east dbl |pg||
nt|gautis2: victory |pg||
nt|gautis2: good to stop...system victory|pg||
nt|runnerup: it doent help east had 1 club trick still already|pg||
nt|derric: i hope this is agreed as worse weak 2 major opening|pg||
nt|bjurn:  EW makes 5@S though, guessing @Ss|pg||
nt|jwit: Can't be right auction|pg||
nt|haans: 5-5 spades + other|pg||
nt|jwit: This can't be right.  West would never pass initially.|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR see West|pg||
mb|2C|nt|zebutin: Ahonen has quite bad values for balancing at red zone, even though has decent 6 card suit...but risks are quite high|pg||
nt|iceking: will be disaster if w gamble on 5@C here|pg||
nt|psyck: bot at this vul maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: *not|pg||
nt|haans: nowday most play AK hoping|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No comments...|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Favourable lie for NS, a number of tricks in a @h contract|pg||
mb|2D|nt|iceking: option ofcourse but will catch very bad dummy and on best def will go for 1100|pg||
nt|haans: and spade lead?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Guess she asked for it - now just make it....|pg||
nt|grebrof: this CAN make|pg||
nt|haans: home if hearts better|pg||
nt|derric: yes, 0-7hcp 5-6M|pg||
nt|haans: ahh she have extra :)|pg||
nt|derric: this can be defeated|pg||
nt|haans: pass 17+ or weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: when she doesn't balance it argues bad spades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh dear... system error|pg||
nt|grebrof: N showing 20-21hp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this will probably run to the J, and N will switch to a Major. the question is - which one?|pg||
nt|haans: agressive defense are not called for|pg||
nt|runnerup: Anni dint open in other table ,althought they have also that weak,very weak 2h opening  |pg||
nt|haans: dont understand 1nt (5 minor + and 4-c M??)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: E/W could be in trouble|pg||
mb|3N|nt|diaoff: Looks like 140 in sight for EW|pg||
nt|haans: all in right|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Ah - East wanted to know, which major South had, before bidding 3 NT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Here you'd like to play canapé, first showing 4c @s and then longer @d but there's no room for that|pg||
nt|grebrof: the good @c-suit being the missing hp|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I bet she is not going to make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even be 170|pg||
nt|haans: Solid bidding by NS|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dias ruff beats 4 @H|pg||
nt|friggi: I think they already are|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: y, fair upgrade|pg||
nt|grebrof: never lead from the J as they say - no leads look appealing for E|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very favourable layout.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|bjurn:  I wonder what 2@H by East would've meant|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and 3 clubs to add to that(that's why I dbl)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: @s looks reasonable enough|pg||
nt|haans: in my book 5-5 er|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I am not a fan of that|pg||
nt|friggi: no anymore:)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: rescued|pg||
nt|gmarco24: almost everything off side here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nubmaster: They play transfer bids over 1@c, ie 1@d=@h etc...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: next and some coffee brb|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just 9 tricks, not very friendly|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mbruun:  Careful defense will hold this to nine tricks, if South ducks heart in trick 2|pg||
nt|psyck: not a good start for Iceland|pg||
nt|iceking: might be the worsed possible dummy W could get|pg||
nt|iceking: now @D return and 4 down for 1100|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but major suit wastages were known on bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but couldn´t W suspect bad @s honours on E?|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Christer|pg||
nt|haans: yep my money on that 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is always a wrong line, but ok|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and will be, once N gets in with @C Q will play spades|pg||
nt|haans: somethimes cost that strong hand have the options|pg||
nt|robinswr: actually i would double a 1@c opener also|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yuval10: you only need from partner something like HXX for it to be very successful. not this time though|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or pd's suit?|pg||
nt|friggi: this will make due the friendly layout|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not me ever if nat|pg||
nt|ianmcc: probably one down|pg||
nt|friggi: but decl has tempo to collect 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  Alsowithout ducking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if 1@h shows @s - why not bid the 6-card @d?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|iceking: if w was on heat one dummy would be J9xx AKx Ax AJxx and 5@C is easy make |pg||
nt|gautis2: but this will probably fail by 1..  so i presume 4 more imps to Finland,..  I need my coffee..brb:)|pg||

nt|derric: might go down now|pg||

pc|h4|nt|jbgood: anyone for a double from W of 3 @c ? |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: why @HK - ruff @S and low up better...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: you could be right, but D!Q?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sorry @dQ?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|grebrof: the finnish is using reversed carding . the 2 showing an equal number of cards in @cs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: right|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now dias|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ianmcc: no hope|pg||
pc|d5|nt|robinswr: I play equal level conversions so if partner bids diamonds, then a heart bid shows no extra values|pg||
nt|peachy: It becomes a matter of priorities, flaw in shape in a minor for TO Double in  my opinion is negligible|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that works out in some deals|pg||
nt|robinswr: last time i looked, you rather play in majors than minors|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i think N's hand had enough entries, so Q@h was interesting idea|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mmmakela: after the K|pg||
nt|haans: she was not fooled :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: can she read this?|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  East will not play @C - so 4 tricks to N/S anyway|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Agree Ralf, an error in the system here or a bidding misunderstanding, think it's the first one though|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I'm sure 2@d is conventional here so there was no room for it as natural|pg||
pc|h5|nt|grebrof: I think it is a good slam and noone would have made it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  If your prempts can be such as in this case, partner should me more cautious|pg||
nt|haans: but lucky no clubs lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good play of @H for an additional entry to hand.|pg||

nt|haans: Final Norse: lennartj: Norseman=Viking eller nordbo|pg||

nt|derric: now give away a @D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 hearts 1st but then must play dias|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer has 7 tricks even without the @d finesse - 2@c, 1@h, 1@s, 1@d, so had South played @d, it was possible that E would just play the Ace|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: oldest of them all|pg||
nt|jwit: Can't really make this hand unless he can swindle a club trick, which he just did!|pg||
nt|jwit: Might have needed to make that play before pulling second trump|pg||
pc|s4|nt|derric: conceding down 1 now i suppose|pg||
nt|derric: oh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can´t understand why a 4-card is more important to show than to bid 1@d|pg||
pc|s5|nt|iceking: 800 for 14imps |pg||
nt|nubmaster: But perhaps E will skip the @s and just go for the @ds from the start, it's teams and gamebonus looks really far away|pg||
nt|ralfwil: !½s10|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c10...|pg||
nt|yuval10: unless NS are playing 2nd/4th carding , then the K@d is marked|pg||
nt|haans: endplaying North|pg||
nt|robinswr: the 1@h overcall kept EW from finding their 8-card major suit fit|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for me t/o dbl is sacred: either all unbid suits or strong|pg||
nt|robinswr: for me all i need is support for the unbid majors|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@d direct is weak with @ds but she prefered showing the @ss first and then after a possible 1@s/1NT she could've used XY-NT to 2@d|pg||

nt|bjurn:  W has a big hand, forced to pass first round|pg||
nt|skaftij:  What do we have here?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Partscore|pg||
nt|mmmakela: nothing|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt invite|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @h lead and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|robinswr: good pass by west. long in hearts short in unbid major |pg||
nt|mmmakela: so no future 4 us playing together Steve then...|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|hawe45:  N/S have no need for Blackwood on this board - one down...|pg||
nt|grebrof: Ahonen surely would have played the A of @d - IF she had it|pg||
nt|sharkey: So preempt so far not a success in this match...|pg||
nt|haans: spades against nt|pg||
nt|bjurn:  0-7/17+|pg||
mb|1S|nt|zebutin: part score battle, where fit isnt to be found|pg||
nt|gautis2: i was about to say this is a "quiet" 4@s, but in OR they ve reached 6@s -2  .. |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|zebutin: seems 1@D opening most likely dropped finns out of this battle...|pg||
nt|grebrof: Finland got 8imps on the catastrophy on board 18 (2)|pg||
nt|haans: slam |pg||
nt|haans: 3NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes but so many HCP:)|pg||
nt|haans: good body|pg||
nt|haans: 4 carder M in both rooms|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1@C also 0-7/17+|pg||
nt|bagman: Nice to see a FP system in operation|pg||
nt|bjurn:  I'd like to bid 2@D with Souths hand|pg||
nt|haans: in dummy @HQ Gold|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S a make i assume|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Double?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S no spade = nt bid|pg||
nt|mmmakela: equals 1 nt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Rightsizing NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: steve's view i think is pretty standard in NA|pg||
nt|robinswr: i can easily play what my partner wants, even if i think it's not best|pg||
nt|gmarco24: do we have some translation of EW system?  :)|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ralfwil: I think there is some undo now....|pg||
nt|grebrof: the opening is +4-5 in the majors - norwegians got a bit too high in the open room|pg||
nt|gautis2: undo:)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: think she missplayed, risking an additional -100 was worth playing for, previous play indicated the actual layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: redo the bidding!|pg||
nt|haans: do far still very short :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: very difficult to bid - easier to play|pg||
nt|haans: and off u go|pg||
nt|diaoff: Should be possible after 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: needed nothing more than 3@D|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - 3@d was a nice bid|pg||
nt|haans: in my book 2nt-3nt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Intial bid has to be a demand bid.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: initial|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: :) :(|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending who play 2@S :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3 down at 3@C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: but who will double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by West take out - so now east can dbl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing negative dbl east can dbl (2-3 cards)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  1 NT is not everybodyÂ´s taste|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@D was 11-16 or (11)12-13bal...so might end up too high|pg||
nt|derric: is north's hand unbal or did she upgrade to 12-13 bal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely|pg||
nt|grebrof: normally the opening would show 10-143-9hp, so I guess they will not get overboard at this table|pg||
nt|grebrof: ooops - 3-9p|pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s now|pg||
nt|haans: even thinking Grand|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S a jump voidwood?|pg||
nt|haans: safed by a prempt :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very brave 3@D:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: I had a partner who bid preemps like that . sometimes even with 5@cs and only 3@ds - I guess it is an agreement they have|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D costly -3|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2@h is insufficient|pg||
nt|friggi: we need that due to the fact that they bid like it's no tomorrow:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|iceking: NS are one of the best women pair in europe, been pdship for man years. Icelandic pair has less experience in international events|pg||
nt|runnerup: this can be a double sving  now 2sp|pg||
nt|bjurn:  another 650|pg||
nt|bagman: Straighforward; W shows his strong playing hand and there's nothing more to add by anyone|pg||
nt|skaftij:  No D, no @s llead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: never liked it bec S can dbl for lead with little points|pg||
nt|haans: before 1@S nt was invite u usually had no bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: cards well placed here for a few o/t's|pg||
nt|iceking: N with some dubious holdings took the passive view here and didnt compete|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D shows @H|pg||
nt|yuval10: the only way of reaching 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 2@s shouls show a good 3 carder now|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess your guess is as good as any|pg||
nt|haans: do not fight 1nt|pg||
nt|runnerup: aha no double just kidding|pg||
nt|bjurn:  exactly, bid to make|pg||
nt|jwit: Wouldn't double show more values though?|pg||
nt|haans: @HK lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  running scores|pg||
nt|mmmakela: as could here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: and N/S?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: contracts below game aren't interesting enough|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: Dbl = 3 @H|pg||
nt|haans: dbl = 3 spades (sipport doubles more and more popular)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South must have pons - West dbl means points and raise in other suit - East could try a dbl, not a big risk|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  2 down on a @S-lead, it seems|pg||
nt|mbruun:  I dont mind 5cM for a NT, but a strong suit without the ace is not clear to open 1 NT|pg||
nt|cenglund:  4S is makeable in board 19|pg||
nt|sharkey: this shud make I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: as South denied 4 @s's earlier, the message from 2@s should be clear|pg||
nt|psyck: S has enuf on the auction to make a game try now|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't really understand 3@c from N then, would expect 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: without delay just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: urk|pg||
nt|ianmcc: has a chance|pg||
nt|friggi: N/S as well, this 3@H was ugly|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ralfwil: can be 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H suicide|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Open 2@C and 3NT.|pg||
nt|grebrof: 0-0 after two boards are scored|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: wonder if 2@s is game-force or invite|pg||
nt|derric: apparantely latter|pg||
nt|zebutin: hearts are well for declarer, everything else little less so...|pg||
nt|zebutin: lead might give 1 @C trick more|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @h and @c friendly|pg||
nt|gautis2: wd Finland, and they have a great start of this game!|pg||
nt|grebrof: reversing with  a single was not the best idea from Marianne Harding it seems|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd Opinion: shogunng: think so Helle plays woidwood|pg||
nt|diaoff: Excl RKC according to CC|pg||
nt|derric: good morning here then|pg||
nt|gmarco24: woo-hoo!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: easiest a clubs finesse?|pg||
nt|diaoff: Best to play on @H I'd say|pg||
nt|haans: need a lot of thinking|pg||
nt|gmarco24: no slam?  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  In fact, the North hand is no so strong - the @DÂ´s doubtful values|pg||
nt|mbruun:  With no aces you should subtract 1 HCP from the hand. Good intermediates are a plus on the other side|pg||
nt|gautis2: seems like a not agreed auction in OR|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe she wanted to bid 3@h :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure splinters with only 3card support is the best, but I am not playing this event :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Denmark Sweden now are +7.|pg||
nt|grebrof: hi Juho|pg||
nt|haans: Morning or just now Good night for Denmark|pg||
nt|jwit: Depends on NT range. Don't think it is enough for dbl with only spade suit and limited values|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no double??|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: if 4@c instead, they could have possibly landed in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is still making though, so NS did well enough|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1nt-opener didnt know she actually had shown 15-17 already (at the other table)|pg||
nt|haans: may save them|pg||
nt|haans: strong spades in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Phil Clayton|pg||
nt|phil: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Phil|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hi Phil|pg||
nt|haans: Phil u came at a boring deal|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This set is getting interesting, now a question of 2 overtricks|pg||
nt|phil: then I can refill my coffee!|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: actually the most exciting out of the 1st 4|pg||
nt|haans: rite u r|pg||
nt|gmarco24: just don't touch @s and this is -3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Sure - but the @D-doubleton is not so great|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, clubs depend quite much how you play them that how friendly they are...with this lead they are friendly enough|pg||
nt|mmmakela: oops|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might ruff the diamond or play safe for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K@D and @h now|pg||
nt|jwit: This could be brutal. Heart back. Three rounds of diamonds, then a fourth heart.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K@D to facilitate the counterplay (also if @D is obliged return, better use clear messages|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, discard @H on @D|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gautis2: i m sure it was a "slip of the mind" ..happens to all of us :)|pg||
nt|derric: should've changed to @h:s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  running scores|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Right|pg||
nt|zebutin: and seems 3@H + 2@S + 2@C + @D make enough tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: good lead|pg||
nt|haans: play strait and fast|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|zebutin: though might go after @D|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With highlights in bidding, lead and play :-)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y agree, didn't matter here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: Harding have no diamond|pg||
nt|mmmakela: shd play a heart|pg||
nt|derric: to make sure of contract|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|grebrof: where is the @c K?|pg||
nt|psyck: doubling & then cueing is very strong action, so I think 3@c was ok, so has more than enuf with an A & a K to go to game after that i guess|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @c9 short is a help|pg||
nt|friggi: big help|pg||
nt|friggi: @SA and more is the only hope for E-W|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|iceking: 10 tricks for one imp gain for Denmark|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes blind spot|pg||
nt|bagman: the risk being that club ruffed, @HA and another club ruff|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Lirarna missed the game on board 3 in the open room|pg||
nt|bagman: A very low risk and typically one should not throw away an easy overtrick|pg||
pc|hT|nt|derric: 3@D 1@h 2@s 2@c would do too|pg||
pc|hK|nt|grebrof: @d K - @s ruff|pg||
nt|haans: North may have AQJ in hertas and @DJ but @SQ?|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess if you sum it up, taking the finness in @s was just as goood|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: playing safe|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ianmcc: good switch|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, even with playing on @D makes|pg||
nt|grebrof: for some of us more often than for others|pg||
pc|d9|nt|grebrof: well, you are endplayed if the @s-finesse dont work . N playing a @d to the K in dummy|pg||
nt|grebrof: ace - ace - ace - ace|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and N shd've played spades now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must discard a @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or a @d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S+@H!+@C=3 for the defense unless the declarer helps the defense.|pg||
nt|haans: yeah Bide|pg||
pc|cT|nt|nubmaster: Yes, no good to just ruff and play ace of @s and then minor cards, S will have a @h left together with a tr|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think South did very well with her hand, to be honest i'd expect N's hand to be AQJX X KTX AKQXX or something like that, then slam is laydown|pg||
nt|haans: plat better than bidding|pg||
nt|derric: luckily for her, north didn't play @SQ|pg||
nt|runnerup: quen even|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mbruun:  Good Cl 10 to emphasize doubleton spade|pg||
nt|haans: play|pg||
pc|c2|nt|grebrof: leading trumps was good this time|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|gautis2: tru...that s why we sit here, and dont play there:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|robinswr: this is not a good save. down 500 will gain 4 or 5 imps against a possible 620 . But what there are ruffs and you go for 1100 or worst you can beat 4spades |pg||
pc|d7|nt|derric: interesting switch|pg||
nt|haans: queen are better played after :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ianmcc: undos?|pg||
nt|haans: holy ....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the OR scoe:)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yuval10: so maybe even 3@d over 3@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: score @D pass.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: all playing too quickly not pausing to think|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk5: There are other reasons|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h showed more balanced of a hand from North|pg||
nt|yuval10: would've show|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or did it?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|zebutin: seems declarer has gone offroad with this declarer play...|pg||

nt|grebrof: I guess she led a @d|pg||
nt|grebrof: well played anyway - as kibz suggest - @d A was not a success|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree, S should have opened 2@C. |pg||
nt|haans: bidding it as a NT hand correct for me|pg||
nt|runnerup: luckily only 1 imp out |pg||
nt|haans: playing 1nt not much to think about|pg||
nt|haans: rare for S to have 10 diamonds|pg||

nt|grebrof: good afternoon Christer|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Good morning everybody|pg||
nt|grebrof: I am reporting from Thailand and we are 5 hours ahead of Norway - 4 hours ahead of Finaland|pg||
nt|grebrof: can be 15-177bal|pg||
nt|sharkey: East attempting to interfer|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H would have been natural but 8-11|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps W will just bid 3 NT|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With the favourable lie, 10 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now finally NS can make game in  S's|pg||
nt|haans: nothing here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Not likely to be bid|pg||
nt|ianmcc: North's fast raise to 2@s helped get there|pg||
nt|friggi: in the other room they bidded the gran slamp and made it 7@H....|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the Dealing Gods are on song - another slam|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|hawe45:  6 @S is the right bid from West now|pg||
nt|mbruun:  6 Sp right away to apply pressure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We could play together, Mathisa|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Im a little concerned that I agree with you, about the bidding I mean |pg||
nt|ianmcc: close to a slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S and 5@D are ON with KJ@S in finesse|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt = 4@H and 5+ in a minor|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  7 @S would have been a better bid than 5!|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Very difficult for NS to get to the grand. I predict EW will buy it in 6 S X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But this might work - and West will not "sell out"|pg||
nt|zebutin: more or less clear 4@H... but if they feel bold they might even shoot for 6@H...|pg||
nt|zebutin: which isnt the best contract, but i have been in worse...|pg||
nt|bagman: not so rare for S to have xxx xxxx AKxxxx -|pg||
nt|haans: Stenberg|pg||
nt|bjurn:  @S game here, 6@S is so-so|pg||
nt|haans: a very rare bid nowdays|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H by west probably fix @S|pg||
nt|robinswr: switch the black kings and 4@s goes down|pg||
mb|d!|nt|psyck: tuf to get to game even after drury|pg||
nt|haans: 11-16 in quicker|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 NT focing app|pg||
nt|jbgood: forcing even|pg||
nt|haans: Yes she think so but ...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good jamming bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  - not if South bids 7 @C now, Mathias...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: must be odds-on|pg||
nt|iceking: another drury hand|pg||
nt|psyck: S likes hand better after opps bid @s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in the contrary, most intriguing contract to play and defend very often|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@C minimum|pg||
nt|haans: often min|pg||
nt|haans: most be natural 2nt :(|pg||
nt|peachy: S decided to show his spades, in a 5-card major system I prefer 2H, hand is not strong enough to try for anything|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|mbruun:  Impressive|pg||
nt|mbruun:  West knows 7 Sp is good insurance, but always difficult to save in a hot aucton like this. She should do it right I think  |pg||
nt|zebutin: 3@S most likely splinter of some sort, Pia might like her hand now because only Axxx in @S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: trump 2 @s and lose a diaamond|pg||
nt|haans: dont like that 2NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: EW getting very exited here :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: hmm, some play something like that or 13-17 in carrot club still...havent seen that working too well... :)|pg||
nt|haans: Multi was biggest at the 80th but still on in Scandinavia|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Well done all around|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From Wests point of view, 7 @S might cost about 500 only - with more @C by East|pg||
nt|gautis2: good result for Norway OR. .. seems hard with heart lead?|pg||
nt|zebutin: sorry, private|pg||

nt|gmarco24: 1@c-16+|pg||
mb|3N|nt|derric: pessimistic|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@H very agressive and will catch perfect dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: that made S's choice easier, esp with vul game at stake|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Mikael G told me that the operator is new and are in training so we will have some allowance here... and she has no time to comment|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Heart lead is the killer|pg||
nt|grebrof: the small cards in dummy makes it easier to overtake the Q too, cause there are many layout where N will have a @h-suit good enough for it to run later|pg||
nt|gautis2: as I can see, I am agree..|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, but S should have though little more about it|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No RD, please, that would loose 2 IMPÂ´s to 2140|pg||
nt|zebutin: well trumps cant be too badly, and with diamond lead neither can any other suits either so has enough entries&etc|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Sry, not Mikael, it was his dad, Johan who told me :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 3@H I think|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@S needs heart K onside and hearts 3-3, 4-2 or J singleton; it is clearly under 50% and thus should not be bid|pg||
nt|bagman: In case NS need desperately a swing the slam would be good :)|pg||
nt|haans: cue mandatory to show cue below game|pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @D lead more aggressive and effective|pg||
nt|skaftij:   800|pg||
nt|robinswr: i agree. support partner asap is my motto|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  One @H-trick might "disappear" here|pg||
nt|haans: in a good day acceptable|pg||
nt|skaftij:  500|pg||
nt|haans: blood from nowhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not @DA or @HK|pg||
nt|bjurn:  42%-ish, vul, might be an options but it's too early in the match IMO|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just overtricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|derric: trumps 4-1 and @c:s 4-2?|pg||
nt|grebrof: my style is 1@d last hand too - if P cant answer 1@d, you rarely have any game|pg||
nt|haans: jack lead?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: can't go wrong here on any line|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yuval10: the (persumably ) weak NT in the OR made many problems to the Swede pair|pg||
nt|haans: yes yout style is my style 2 but not with @CK singel|pg||
nt|robinswr: partner will not know that you have three hearts if the auction goes 1@h 1@s 2@d 2@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club by declarer now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: maybe he thought he was a fraction too good for 2 @H|pg||
nt|robinswr:   I wrote an article on that subject http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202008-02.aspx|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bagman: AKQxxx Jx xxx xx would make the slam better|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|phil: 500 looks likely as long as the defense doesnt stub their toe|pg||
nt|friggi: did not finnes!?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: as long as he takes this|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|gmarco24: even ducking twice would squeeze W pretty much in three suits, so one discard of @h will follow|pg||
pc|sA|nt|zebutin: something like that most likely is enough|pg||
nt|derric: the @HJT help a lot|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  @H-shift is important - otherwise only 800|pg||
nt|haans: a make now|pg||
nt|haans: @C3 = count even|pg||
nt|phil: declarer's shape is known then|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: Norway went down in 6 @d in OR|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mbruun:  North will have to cash AK now otherwise she will be endplayed|pg||
nt|bagman: When E wins the @HK the auction tells that he must switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|bagman: w|pg||
nt|bjurn:  unless E decides to lead @H|pg||
nt|bagman: Easts spade trick cannot run away but a diamond trick can|pg||
nt|haans: E do have a natural lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|grebrof: well played so far|pg||
nt|bjurn:  N's failure to cuebid @Ds might encourage him to lead @DA|pg||
nt|bagman: E has an easy @CQ lead; N might win a spade and immediately take the heart finesse with @HQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mbruun:  Good stop at the other table on board 4 to bring Denmark in the match|pg||
nt|derric: now just needs help with the diamonds to escape -200|pg||
pc|sK|nt|grebrof: 8 tricks|pg||
nt|grebrof: or?|pg||
nt|grebrof: lol|pg||
nt|grebrof: the @c-suit will provide the 9th|pg||
nt|gautis2: in that case, a 10imps pickup to Norway...|pg||
nt|grebrof: its a 1imp-pickup|pg||
nt|grebrof: claimtime|pg||
nt|gautis2: 1?|pg||
nt|gautis2: what coffee do u drink in thailand? :)|pg||
nt|haans: time for endplay|pg||
nt|mmmakela: all shd be clear|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: should take @sK then hook @c|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he is afraid of Q@c lose to K, @d switch|pg||
nt|ianmcc: what other option?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: A@c, @c  maybe, dunno|pg||
nt|friggi: I agree|pg||
nt|friggi: he has ti play W for the outstanding honors|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: was hard to believe|pg||
pc|s4|nt|skaftij:  actually, they get 800 now |pg||
nt|phil: yes I guess they do|pg||
nt|haans: @C4 lavinthal = hearts|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|iceking: at this vul i think W had to be tempted go for 300 or so in 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: off 1 I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: it looks like trump lead beats 2@h by 3 , but defense allowed declarer to score 2 more tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: attack in clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: don't see any help coming.:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: this has no hope :)|pg||
nt|derric: yes, majors can be lead for many rounds still|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much in play: N takes the heart finesse with the Q and tries to set up the 5th heart|pg||
nt|gmarco24: we know he can't really go wrong|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: Noth may be void in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: a1c|pg||
nt|skaftij:  blood blood blood we loves it!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: not the right moment to play @hQ. Duck one round|pg||
nt|sharkey: now off 2|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and after winning with @cQ, @hQ and another|pg||
nt|bagman: The worse line is to take double finesse in hearts requireing KJ onside|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hawe45:  Nice to see Nadia ruff "high" here...!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mbruun:  North is punished from that little slip|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  Nadia proved, that she is comning from the famous Blaksets Bridgecenter - by ruffing high...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  coming|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|iceking: very strong result 620 here |pg||

pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||

mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Not so far-fetched play given the bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: I frequently played 1nt XX when playing weak nts|pg||
nt|phil: can't imagining passing the East hand|pg||
nt|phil: (imagine)|pg||
nt|haans: Törnqvist had no opening :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Really?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|iceking: not so good methods here for ew. |pg||
nt|haans: right, double in my book not hearts|pg||
nt|ianmcc: West loved that opening|pg||
nt|friggi: no problem now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: claim 10|pg||
nt|gmarco24: once you are in 3nt this board is getting uninteresting :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|iceking: for sure W should decl with his holding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 4@c from W = bid your suit under, and contract on the strong hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, some play 4@c |pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead needed I think|pg||
nt|haans: big think No opening|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I'd open without the @c jack|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hawe45:  If West finds the killing lead, they will call the police|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Will make in practice|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 1@s could be passed out (but I agree)|pg||
nt|derric: partner is likely to raise on any 3+ support|pg||

nt|fabsayc: so what to do over 1@H opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: sometimes running your winners will squeese your opponents - can be a good strategy even if you dont have enough tricks to begin with too|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: 1@S 17+|pg||

nt|haans: hard fight here|pg||

mb|1H|nt|zebutin: what to bid on Johanssons 2@H ?|pg||
nt|gautis2: 500 is a good score.. 4@h seems like few loosers, but not enough winners?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can they bid the slam?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 0-7|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 3@S with good guess in trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless EW score a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|bjurn:  I must confess that I would've opened souths hand as well, at least in a strong club system|pg||
nt|haans: most can take a beating withouy being punch-drunk or they would not play Swedish Teams|pg||
mb|d|nt|rnmalik: EW have good play for 4@S.|pg||
nt|ady: club lead   though may mean defeat    2 ruffs A@D   ace of trumps|pg||
nt|robinswr: i don't like doubling with a singleton spade|pg||
mb|r!|nt|ianmcc: 3@d|pg||
nt|iceking: should have no problems stop in 4@H here|pg||
nt|psyck: 5 level is safe too i guess|pg||
nt|iceking: would be good to have 3@H forcing here |pg||
nt|nubmaster: If 2NT shows the red suits why not start with 4@h and then 5@d? But N took it for the minors because of the fact that the 1@c opening is 2+?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3-3 to paly here|pg||
nt|haans: Big Clubs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a quiet 3NT here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|grebrof: I guess without the @s lead, you can possibly make some @d-tricks, but|pg||
nt|haans: system works well here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - think they'll bid slam|pg||
nt|haans: but Blackwwod a problem = 2 keys missing|pg||
nt|haans: urp|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes|pg||
nt|jwit: agree|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now maybe 1nt-3nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok S taking slow road|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4@S not doubled Optimal contract|pg||
nt|diaoff: Expected a Dbl there, yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: must start on @d at once to win this - and use @d to pull S's 4th trump - very difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: lucky that N has all the aces|pg||
nt|jbgood: club ace with S and the contract would stand no chance on best def|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well this one at least looks like an opening(almost?)|pg||
nt|haans: all you can say is URKKK|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@C game try in spades with 4@Ss|pg||
nt|haans: yes most of us would|pg||
nt|bagman: W likely to lead @CQ or a low heart|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not so easy call 3N|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
nt|phil: believe your pard or believe your opps? |pg||
nt|haans: what rare choices|pg||
nt|skaftij:  not the ideal hand by North to bid 4 card M|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont like overcalling with 21 count|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@s shows this hand over a takeout double|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 17+|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, no fun a all|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 1@d=12-13 bal or... or...|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: and that is logical if bypass @D with marginal canape hands|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h will now be frcd after 4th suit bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but 4@d will also do and after 4@h = no @s control|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Forcing?|pg||
nt|gautis2: this play will take sometime..belive me:)|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 1 NT who wd pass as E not holding 6|pg||
nt|phil: I love my hand for 1@h x'd - doubleton trump and some working cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Denmark gained 7 IMP on board 5, because South unblocked her AK of hearts in due time, so 7 Sp X was five off|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a happy spot|pg||
nt|zebutin: well no double... seems like 2 down or something|pg||
nt|grebrof: I assume the 5 from E|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they play count when Q is at the table|pg||
nt|gautis2: not best lead.. may make now|pg||
nt|haans: yep 0-7 is 0-7|pg||
nt|haans: nope harder to pass 2nt|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club did cost here|pg||
nt|phil: why should 1N be any better? |pg||
nt|phil: or 2@c? |pg||
nt|mmmakela: more club tricks|pg||
nt|haans: Markku have a point :)|pg||
nt|phil: I dont remember my partner showing clubs with a 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|phil: but maybe its part of a system :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Because your @d Queen will not be ruffed and you have delivered your hand|pg||
nt|haans: they do not present best bridge ever :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jwit: Not at all an unexpected result|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt-3nt (natural)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|iceking: so 3@H and now S will deny @S control so should end in 4@H|pg||
nt|iceking: Danish que-bidding style is though little odd at least i have never understood it|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S shows interest in slam perhaps N shud be able to bid it based on @H length and max|pg||
nt|grebrof: Magic Diamond comes from Sweden originally, but many play it in  Finland too - they are more artificial in Sweden-Finland than we are in Norway-Denmark - I have myself sat down ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: that 1@c meant either a) 5-11hp any suit or b) 17hp+ any distribution - conventions like that are not allowed in Norway, but it is fun, isnt it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: East are at the bathroom|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The play of the Finnish ladies has been mildly put rather sloppy|pg||
nt|haans: i do assume they would not bid 1@H with A+K|pg||
nt|grebrof: when do you get to go, Johanna?|pg||
nt|haans: 52% slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be S or N shud have made more efforts here....|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|iceking: undo|pg||
nt|gautis2: ..but a fair normal lead|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Spade must be attacked otherwise diamonds will be established|pg||
nt|grebrof: curiousity is always there with AK in a suit|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt played by East please|pg||
nt|bagman: Hopes to score a ruff and two spades :9|pg||
nt|jwit: Even without big club, not clear to bid with South hand opposite a 2NT opener.  4-4 in majors might sway South to bid, but still far from clear cut.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|psyck: we see what you mean Magnus :)|pg||
nt|iceking: so 3@S could maybe ask for @S control |pg||
nt|iceking: Danish asking bid i think they call it|pg||
nt|gautis2: God have given u an ace for one reason...take it!|pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: that card was meant for entry to dummy...|pg||
nt|diaoff: Needed that entry I'm afraid|pg||
nt|haans: ok Stayman first|pg||
nt|robinswr: he could have overcalled 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: 11 tricks |pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: can not make Blackwood|pg||
nt|diaoff: You're faster :), but now it makes again|pg||
nt|jbgood: ok - no duck and no dinner:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: but it aint over yet|pg||
nt|haans: ok goes this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Johan Wahlberg|pg||
nt|wahlis:  Hi|pg||
nt|friggi: hi|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mbruun:  Difficult lead for West, and DK is natural but unfortunate|pg||
nt|iceking: dont try this at home folks :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: never , I can't leave my chair :)|pg||
nt|derric: maybe if S was gonna open, try 1NT|pg||
nt|haans: low @D = lavinthal for clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: S was unlikely to guess the trumps anyhow but the ruff makes sure of beating this|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cenglund:  This is capitulation|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I would be proud of my cards as dummy sitting South|pg||
nt|phil: yes|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this looking a bit better|pg||
nt|gmarco24: welcome Johan|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi Johan|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no swings this set|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 7@c is entry creating maneuver|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks and next....|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like ew 1nt without this mini opening so some imps |pg||
pc|s5|nt|mbruun:  Nice layout for declarer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: and 13 tricks - next|pg||
nt|iceking: ok 3@S was here some slam potential without shortness|pg||
nt|grebrof: hard to see any reason for the trumpshift|pg||
nt|ady: bidding a little odd    first content with 2@C 2nd time around  non forcing  and when parttners shows a weak hand with long spades gets bettwer and goes to 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense interesting, south has to win second club, cash spade ace and exit in clubs|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|iceking: so in a way they didnt know @S quebid was on or missing |pg||
nt|haans: 2Queens + 10 10 10|pg||
nt|mmmakela: IF E PASSES 1 @H D(and seems sane) I would never pass but bid 1 NT|pg||
nt|friggi: take @SK to hold them down to 10|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cenglund:  Even spade shift may not be enough to set the contact|pg||
nt|haans: i dont understand his pass|pg||
nt|robinswr: if my partner made a t/o double i would insist on playing in spades with the east hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gautis2: as long @h K stiff, I think this was home after lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s-shift - and then?|pg||
nt|gautis2: dia|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok, bang down @h A and small @c later from W|pg||
nt|grebrof: or another @s|pg||
nt|gautis2: cant get another @s from W...just borned with one :)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Trump lead might help|pg||
nt|gautis2: that s true|pg||
nt|runnerup: finnish ladys found a better fit 4-3 |pg||
nt|jwit: 2 queens not nearly as good as an ace.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|grebrof: yes, but small @c AND a new @s is a monster - maybe|pg||
nt|ady: what did you want west to do after south opening?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: agree |pg||
nt|robinswr: i would probably have overcalled 2@c|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ianmcc: It will make soon|pg||
nt|haans: agree to that|pg||
nt|jwit: 4-4 in majors might make it worthwhile to try Stayman|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: now it is|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still not enough to win the board...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can't go wrong such is the placement of cards.|pg||
nt|phil: North's? |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|haans: bit Q + 10?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i'm not sure EW can bring this one to only +1 after @h lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|skaftij:  I don't understand NORTHS pass|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|ianmcc: should have taken one pitch|pg||
nt|derric: back to down 2 if win this and a trump|pg||
nt|ralfwil:  no 12|pg||
nt|grebrof: trump lead might be the killer, yes|pg||
nt|haans: utp again|pg||
nt|jbgood: big numbers all over the place|pg||
nt|jbgood: 990 OR|pg||
nt|skaftij:  second chance to bid 1NT|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|derric: or trump after @HJ|pg||
nt|zebutin: or is it even 3 down now|pg||
nt|derric: correct|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 300|pg||
nt|jwit: Better play it better in 3 lol|pg||
nt|haans: one reason to bid after 2nt is that 2nt may be down as well |pg||
nt|jwit: 20 opposite 4 generally doesn't play anywhere near as well as 12 opposite 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree|pg||
nt|haans: again u are rite|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: :(|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: making here and 9 imps away...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S Ace please.|pg||
nt|derric: lucky since in both rooms south could equally well hold 2-5-2-4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|phil: I think 1@h created the issues; not the pass later|pg||
nt|haans: I do not understand South first pass|pg||
nt|skaftij:  big risk being caught|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west made a good play, countering my defense|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|zebutin: other room got to stop in 2@D just made, so nice pick up for finns|pg||
nt|zebutin: if doesnt play 3 round spades, might be even more down|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @H back and @H through|pg||
nt|derric: possibility of -4 after this pause for thought|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|runnerup: east missed to take her d ace|pg||
pc|hT|nt|phil: there just doesnt seem to be much upside overcalling on @hAJ87|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I agree with both of Souths passes, but there you go|pg||
nt|phil: me too|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3@d had good chances tho only 8 tricks other table|pg||
nt|iceking: ok they did know when north bypassed 3nt he denied @S control. Like i said very complicated que-bidding style in Denmark|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, this match isnt over yet - as it normally isnt after 7 boards|pg||
nt|gautis2: think u re right Espen:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: now the director is here again, to get the result of the case on board 2|pg||
nt|robinswr: i have to go now enjoyed commenting|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes bad def for push|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|derric: @h through king has to come early|pg||
nt|bagman: Eliminating hearts before playing a club up|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|zebutin: Johansson made the right choice and "only" 3 down|pg||
nt|mmmakela: could've been 200-300 to start with|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|friggi: need to play @C earlier|pg||

nt|zebutin: Andersson might have some weak jump in hearts as option|pg||
nt|gautis2: my guess is 200 and 7 imps...  coke-bet (ruling board 2)|pg||
nt|grebrof: I bet against you :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: North had a 6 card fit which she hadnt shown|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The 6th heart is valuable|pg||
nt|yuval10: finally an interesting one|pg||
nt|diaoff: Its a tough game...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this one looks dangerous|pg||
nt|bjurn:  a chance for Lirarna to earn some overtrick IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: Here NS can make 460 in notrumps to score 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|skaftij:  blood blood ahhh|pg||
nt|mmmakela: agree but if pd decided to do so , bidding tells u shd bid 1 NT|pg||
nt|friggi: when he ha full control|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Yes  - but after a slow start|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This looks like a coffee-board for 420 N/S|pg||
nt|mbruun:  4 Sp seems to be the spot, and its a very natural contract|pg||
nt|psyck: they have to be careful not to get too high here with cards unfav|pg||
nt|haans: but is no ace|pg||
nt|gmarco24: agree Fridrik|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: prefer 3nt to 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 2@D most likely multi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks with open cards|pg||
nt|iceking: slam makes |pg||
nt|haans: not more than 3@S|pg||
nt|haans: 1NT-3NT?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sorry misspeek|pg||
nt|bjurn:  South wont be able to find @HK with North|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT is clearly better than 5m as there are 9+ top tricks and nobody can ruff any of the winners|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: In open the Icelandic ended up in 5@d|pg||
nt|ianmcc: another partial|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Johansson has many quick tricks in hand, so didnt want to bid lame 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: or east could maybe dbl 3@D here |pg||
nt|jbgood: Norway had a bye last round - seems like they have problems adjusting to playing again...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what a hand, a nightmare:)|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S a make|pg||
nt|bagman: As the auction tempoed, 3NT is nearly impossible to reach|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also if 2@H isn't forcing north will raise with KQx and a sgl out|pg||
pc|d3|nt|iceking: 3@D looks alot down 5-6 down|pg||
nt|derric: would you bid the south hand?|pg||
nt|haans: good question what does Pass show now|pg||
nt|haans: 6@C+1@S+1@S+1@H?|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes h lead lets this home|pg||
nt|mmmakela: spade J lead anyone?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D|pg||
nt|ady: west got a good result    looking at the 2 hands 3NT does not look so good|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ?+??|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mbruun:  North will raise to three, and a well placed DK will make South go to game|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Ah, started to write that before it showed up on the screen, sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have 12 top tricks and it looks possible that you can squeeze your way to the 13th|pg||
nt|psyck:  could there be 13 tricks here with W squeezed in majors?|pg||
nt|haans: How many knows that?|pg||
nt|haans: OR bid 5@C alone|pg||
nt|bjurn:  South might try 4@S now|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@S makes 450?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I expect 1@h to be best spot and even make, if you overcall with 4M, you should have a second bid, ususally 5 card minor|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H alerted|pg||
nt|mmmakela: looking  better|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|grebrof: 1@c +15hp|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1@s balanced +9 or 4441|pg||
nt|haans: of you lead @SJ = call TD|pg||
nt|derric: now @S towards K and pray|pg||
nt|ianmcc: with overtricks|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: the quesstion remains, will W bid 5|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@s is presumably preempting|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 8-11 ? really?|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S the winner|pg||
nt|runnerup: same in other room -bidding and lead|pg||
nt|haans: assume three spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gautis2: did we get the result  of board 2 Johanna?  |pg||
nt|cenglund:  This a better slam than the previous one|pg||
nt|ady: winning lead impossible to find|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this scores better|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ianmcc: some prospects|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room they got to open 1@H telling 4+ @H and 8-11...and after that sailed to 3nt|pg||
nt|derric: 3NT went down after declarer broke entries in open|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Cards are not lying in favour of making 6NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: I would XX ;)|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead and down|pg||
nt|friggi: 3 down is ok|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|zebutin: this lead destroys one entry to @C suit, but give ruffing finese in @S suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: became a winner - 500 was available|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes, you have the values, showing a hand worth 18-19.|pg||
nt|haans: Asplund had cards for double of 2@D|pg||
nt|bagman: There's little in the play as declarer drives out the @SA and then cashes his top trumps and scores 420 or 450 depending on the spade break|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @H lead in this auction is ortodoxe|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|gautis2: and they figure it out, so a  stop...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finnish ladies avoided the tempation|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I think the director chosed to let it be (4heartsx-2), but I'm not shore!|pg||
nt|grebrof: not that I can see EW doing something viable over 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may have bid 4@S with West hand - but 5332 distribution is a negative|pg||
nt|santyclz: 29 hcp so it may not be automatic to get there.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mmmakela: no stayman....need some points from pd.....heart lead might give it away...... so not impossible.....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is no winning lead|pg||
nt|ady: in fact no winning lead as they lay|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I don't like that 1@s too wide a range if you can go down to 5 HCP and soft at that|pg||
pc|h8|nt|zebutin: so if takes that, she is losing 2@D + @H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Maybe 4@s here|pg||
nt|gautis2: ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: I wouldnt change that board 2 either|pg||
nt|grebrof: but ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: not the best lead here|pg||
nt|grebrof: if there is any|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|nubmaster: good bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep, surely not 7... 6 will probably be good enough|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ianmcc: it removes a useful entry|pg||
nt|psyck: stopping low with a key card missing & the 3@d x|pg||
nt|haans: rersponder tend to make transfers all the time|pg||
nt|haans: must play spade now|pg||
nt|haans: no futher delay|pg||
nt|phil: he can make a lot of tricks on this layout|pg||
pc|c4|nt|iceking: i dont really understand why east didnt dbl 3@D|pg||
nt|iceking: east should know dummy in 3@D dbl will hold most often 0-1@D and very few hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this might be a chance for the Swedes in the OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly left the door open.|pg||
nt|haans: so she may not have understood the Pass|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true, xx @S was acceptable to P.|pg||
nt|haans: not fun but must|pg||
nt|mmmakela: is it clear it's the best play?|pg||
nt|runnerup: no but only change |pg||
nt|haans: of you know all cards you may endplay|pg||
nt|haans: but you dont|pg||
nt|haans: all cards right|pg||
pc|d5|nt|nubmaster: They must continue @d after the 2 @c to take away the entrance to E|pg||
nt|psyck:  as usual, minor slams with borderline values tuf to get to|pg||
nt|yuval10: using a natural system it looks like 1NT - 2@c - 2@h  - 3@d and then N should lead the way with 3 keycards and a Q of trump|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I can think of some layouts where 4xclubs now is the winning line|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|gmarco24: OR is faster for 2 boards|pg||
nt|wahlis:  need to play for A @s onside now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck: double dummy, you can reel off 8 tricks in the majors & squeeze South in the minors for the rest|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|gautis2: I told it was a close group a while ago, with 2 VP fom 1st to 3rd...  as we speak, it is actually thighter! (1 VP 1st-3rd :))|pg||
nt|haans: but could E have passed with Qxxxxxx and no more|pg||
nt|runnerup: youll loose 3h +1 sp+1 d |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ianmcc: wrong pitch, I think she needed @cK onside|pg||
nt|zebutin: discarded @C so doesnt have to take @C finese, but @D suit is so lousy they will not raise as any extra tricks, so needs Ax(x) in front of @D K|pg||
nt|rnmalik: doubt, @C honours were the catch and stiff @H.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with this counterplay declarer can ruff a @C playing reverse dummy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: yep :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|haans: like it when east thinks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nubmaster: @d now or she makes|pg||
nt|friggi: but today players are bidding on air:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: even 1NT would have been transfer|pg||

nt|sharkey: on Bd 22 4@S also made in OR - quite surprising...|pg||
nt|haans: mayor error in diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h was 8-11 and prob 3 card support - so 5@h was not to be recommended - trumps might easily have been 4-1 |pg||
nt|jbgood: and even 4@h might have been in trouble|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in open room 4@H made with a squeeze against east|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: east went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|haans: direct 4@H i think|pg||
nt|phil: yes 4@h looks likely, but North may have an opinion about that|pg||
nt|mmmakela: to reconsider his heart opening level?|pg||
nt|phil: with a slower auction anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  It's not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: interesting play by declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: @s overcall?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: undo|pg||
nt|gautis2: this seems like a hughe result in OR|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - if you have a fit, its a lot more than just 11hp|pg||
nt|haans: now 1@S is right|pg||
nt|sharkey: lots of voids in these hands - who's been dealing?|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt going down down down|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H no make|pg||
nt|haans: double better tyhan 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|bjurn:  in the OR North opened 2@S (6+@S, 10-13) giving EW less space to find 3@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C like precision - 5+@C until 15 hcp|pg||
nt|jwit: 3NT pretty normal for NS, but might not be that easy to make|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: 3nt?|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: @d lead (a trump lead) kills 5@s too|pg||
nt|grebrof: 5@d|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no play in 6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now we see why no heart raise on prior hand|pg||
nt|friggi: hi |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h might just live|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk5: Vore kampe kl. 15.00 efter lunchpausen bliver Island-Danmark Open og Sverige-Finland Damer|pg||
nt|grebrof: I see swedish juniors open frequently at 8-9hp bal -  its their style - no system is perfect|pg||
nt|haans: NS bidding right this far|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H uppercut in clubs|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 3 is too high since S will get a heart promotion|pg||
nt|bagman: On a good day both hearts and clubs behave and EW can make a NT game. No both suits are unfriendly and resulted in 3 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass with 17 can be a risk|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Another grand slam|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Two grands in nie hands. Good cardshufflers|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: yes the last one was misscored, it was equal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and good bidders|pg||
nt|haans: would have preferred 3@H to 2|pg||
nt|haans: usually not hearts|pg||
nt|haans: easy way to win IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: W might even let this go undoubled|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@S should go a few down but there isnt that many losers so EW cant afford to slip too much|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, seen dbl now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2N constructive of course|pg||
nt|bridge_one: having 2@D @H @S to bid|pg||
nt|haans: cards look from for 3nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C or 3Nt now by south|pg||
nt|jwit: 8 tricks off the top. 9th trick may not be easy|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks to go close but 4@s quite cheap|pg||
mb|2C|nt|zebutin: offshape overcall with 4cards, offshape x without 3rd @D...so many options for bidding...|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 1nt is 12-14. Last hand w opened 1nt with bal 13hcp|pg||
nt|ralfwil: dbl is 500|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@H is some bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: no hcp no shape no controls |pg||
nt|skaftij:  East certainly has his bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: hard to stay below game now|pg||
nt|haans: good bidding by Åhlén|pg||
nt|mmmakela: as does W|pg||
nt|phil: the double fit for NS makes 5@c pretty inexpensive|pg||
nt|skaftij:  300|pg||
nt|friggi: 2@H now|pg||
nt|gmarco24: time for showing @h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: never buy a thai keyboard - mainly I am guessing :D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The blockage in hearts is awkward for declarer in 5D|pg||
nt|bjurn:  good lead!|pg||
nt|bagman: EW are likely to score 2 spades by E , diamond overruf by W and the @CA|pg||
nt|bjurn:  @DK, @C towards the @CK?|pg||
nt|bagman: If west gets in with the @CA he can shoot a trump thru kill the club ruff|pg||
nt|phil: not much to the play here|pg||
nt|haans: di not pay to find that 5@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wlc back to Phil Clayton|pg||
nt|phil: hi all|pg||
nt|gmarco24: not yet   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: low score|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody steals from e.  5332 with a marginal (?) suit.|pg||
nt|haans: 31S now focing in my book|pg||
nt|runnerup: this looks like 2 down |pg||
nt|haans: not often you see 2nt as constructive|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 tricks easy because east controls both minors|pg||
nt|ady: hi Phil|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  You have to play some kind of Exclusion-blackwood to bid it. Very difficult|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @C (W) - 4 @H (E) - 5 NT - how difficult can you make it, Culbertsonour good old freind|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I exclude exclusion|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Board 6 is also misscored. Hopefully they will be corrected shortly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph lead is normal on the bidding|pg||
nt|derric: shouldn't be a problem on this lie of cards|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: Sorry, I'm lost..|pg||
nt|haans: np :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: syntax error?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: best lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, 4@H makes but 4@S is only 300|pg||
nt|ianmcc: West now interested|pg||
nt|friggi: must be, he knows of a good fit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|derric: 1@c is 15+ i believe|pg||
nt|zebutin: but i think they have some bid over strong @C that tells majors, so even that could have been option...|pg||
nt|derric: i don't know if x is take-out|pg||
nt|bridge_one: declarer can make a mistake now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: J@H and @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: double fit, and all honors working almost|pg||
pc|c3|nt|grebrof: not sure I would have bid in these circumstnces anyway|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Would u sell?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think East should have bid @h|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|zebutin: seems like will lose atleast 3 @S, @D and @C...and cant raise @D suit either before has removed all trumps, and might lose control because of @C suit...|pg||
nt|zebutin: so needs some delicate play|pg||
nt|iceking: east should signal with @S K here|pg||
nt|haans: in scandinavia we all use reverse carding|pg||
nt|friggi: this might create some swing |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|grebrof: not all|pg||
nt|yuval10: South needs to switch to @c before she cash the 2nd @d of course|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mbruun:  In the Open series, the Danish West, HC Graversen lead the HA to beat 3 NT by one on board 6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I doÂ´nt know heir system (either) - but 4 @C from West instead of 3 @H would have been better|pg||
nt|cenglund:  This may be a huge swing|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: maybe worried @sK would suggest @d pref|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1@c opening in the other room contains a whole lot of diffferent stuff, so not that strange that lead wasnt found|pg||
nt|gautis2: yes, will be 11 imps to Norway|pg||
nt|grebrof: allthou I do prefer it|pg||
nt|haans: but: shogunng: but you have to take sps first|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nothing left to buy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might lead diamond king|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: that was the cheapest:)|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|wahlis:  4@h in the other room|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Next board...|pg||
nt|mbruun:  It seems strange to give up the investigations|pg||
nt|iceking: yes probably thinking about that|pg||
nt|santyclz: She was listening...|pg||
nt|jbgood: halfway through - and N has not scored a single imp..|pg||
nt|diaoff: Needed to score the club trick first|pg||
nt|jbgood: the pure downer has gone now - S needed to cash 2 clubs - but a club to the king and another is testing, E will have to double finesse @h 10-9 to make it|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a measly 50 for a vul game|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nubmaster: I think 4@s will make so 5@h will probablu be correct... anyone to analyse if 4@s can be set?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: South cannot have 5 hearts|pg||
nt|phil: with 3-2 trump there's no work to this|pg||
nt|ady: draw 3 rounds of trumps if leading KQ diamonds    but still I tghink 9 tricks|pg||
nt|friggi: very strange|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: now impossible lose the contract|pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cenglund:  Defence can't afford a slightest slip |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|zebutin: this seems to be on road for atleast 1 down at this rate|pg||
nt|zebutin: but with @C return is able to raise @C suit, so defence needs to be sharp too|pg||
nt|derric: 4 black suit ruffs and @DAK@hAK would make 8|pg||
nt|sharkey: Marianne had a difficult decision over 4@S - 5@D not a winner this time as 4@S wud have failed|pg||
nt|bjurn:  should be 2 down now|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 4@h is not cold, who knows|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@c is getting cool|pg||
nt|friggi: but W should show this @H regardless|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mbruun:  How about 5D after 4c. When partner shows two aces bid 5 N and partner will cuebid 6 H which will get them to the grand. Maybe they have other agreements of course|pg||
nt|haans: so the big question is Will 3@H make |pg||
nt|bagman: Not much for N to do; loses two clubs as cannot ruff the 2nd club loser|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: on hand 18 3NT failed by 1 trick  where n/s played 2@S on 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jwit: Good play of diamond Jack|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i know i would over 1@s for sure|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 4@c helped, of course|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jbgood: will not do|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: 4@S was the good winner|pg||
nt|haans: :) :(|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: one can understand that their inspiration is not at its peak|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c7|nt|bagman: The defense sets up the @HK in the process so they cannot  force N to lead 3 times clubs from hand|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|iceking: so 8 imp pick-up for iceland|pg||
nt|haans: play diamonds and hang|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: the endplay against east is very clear|pg||
nt|jwit: It is|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cenglund:  S must stick to all 3 hearts in a game contract|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: yep|pg||
mc|9|nt|derric: no success|pg||
nt|zebutin: now she is losing 2 more, so swedish women continue to gain imps|pg||
nt|derric: 2 more for south|pg||

nt|zebutin: and will opponents x or bid their own @C suit|pg||
nt|derric: prob 4|pg||
nt|iceking: been great action |pg||
nt|sharkey: the Norweigan girls bid the slam on Bd 24 - wd|pg||
nt|derric: found @cJ it seems|pg||
nt|haans: in the long run|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but 5 @H makes|pg||
nt|friggi: this was expensive|pg||
nt|gmarco24: @s lead at OR, but no @s return after A@h for -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: only worth 3@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: grand here|pg||
nt|haans: good 6@C|pg||
nt|runnerup: 7 on finess so 6 |pg||
nt|bjurn:  12-14|pg||
nt|bagman: looks like a good EW score in the open room; hearts badly and diamonds badly|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt to certain|pg||
nt|bjurn:  S might double 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  The mistake(s) started with the 2 NT-bid - why not allready there bid 4 @C?|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|hawe45:  You get 4 @H from partner and bid 5 NT|pg||
nt|jwit: Ugh!|pg||
nt|phil: yes, possible East would have pulled the double with AKQTxxx|pg||
nt|haans: some have said give THEM 5 level :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: big swing|pg||
mb|d|nt|mbruun:  I think 4C directly after 2 Sp will show shortage|pg||
nt|haans: lucky them|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C not so frequent with this cards|pg||
mb|r!|nt|zebutin: so might be small gain to finns|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S have 3NT|pg||
nt|iceking: S will dbl 2@S i assume|pg||
nt|psyck: S may balance|pg||
nt|cenglund:  In the open room they played 3NT|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Without club lead 10 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: do assume they had no pen double|pg||
nt|jbgood: wow - off the schneid...|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt not best possible|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@H looks like 500|pg||
nt|haans: and 3nt more likely to make @HT lead|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@H X is likely to go for 500 (and possibly 200)|pg||
nt|jwit: c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably because not vuln|pg||
nt|fabsayc: transfer responses, 1@H=spaded|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S on 4-3 fit looks the only game for e/w|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: 6@H has a chance|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Dealer did not sleep well and not smiling this Sunday morning:)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not always hans|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT and likely failing|pg||
nt|friggi: @S return look kind of auto play|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: now N might gamble on 3nt |pg||
nt|iceking: 3@D could be very wrong give pd like 14-16 hcp and 2-4-3-4 shape and he most likely will pass 3@D even playing leb|pg||
nt|iceking: i bet she will gamble on 3nt, been very agressive so far|pg||
nt|psyck: leb may not apply here anyway|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C-2@C-6@C in my book|pg||
nt|jwit: Couldn't agree more.  I don't even like overcalling 2 of a minor with 5-3-3-2 and full values, let alone subminimal|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1@h = spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: 3, I wrote wrong|pg||
nt|gulyas: they have the points, but the suits don't behave|pg||
nt|gulyas: need some help from the opps:)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psyck: can make a lot with majors favorable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: me too never bid 2@C with south cards :)|pg||
nt|haans: not winning contract = scoreing points|pg||
nt|friggi: a lot of help|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  DoesÂ´nt matter - it forces East to show the suits with control, and 4 @H is a true dream to hear|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Thats true. Might work out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In my world, a doubleton is shortage|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead are not so good|pg||
nt|runnerup: other table used 7 bids to reach 3nt -bad for F|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2NT will be at least 800|pg||
nt|phil: 1@s is like a weak NT? |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: many bid 1@C with 2+ clubs|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: ok 3@H it is have to admit i was not thinking about 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: that is one bid no one could have guessed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not 4@s - at least -1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not off to a good start...|pg||
nt|haans: National Teams?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only when it's right lol|pg||
nt|haans: transfer |pg||
nt|gulyas: nothing helps here|pg||
nt|gulyas: systemic misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ianmcc: is this correct?|pg||
nt|friggi: cant be right|pg||
nt|gulyas: somebody forgot they play (or don't play) 2 way checkback|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but South had opened 1@s|pg||
pc|dT|nt|derric: looks like lost 2@s 4@d 1@c in open|pg||
nt|zebutin: @D Q helped atleast 1 trick|pg||
nt|grebrof: just as my gf - its her birthday, but she is still cleaning :)|pg||
nt|derric: didn't expect a raise on with cards|pg||
nt|haans: raise with three can cost|pg||
nt|haans: no diamods stopper|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east is showing a big hand, so 2@S is lame|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I reckon this will make for a pickup!|pg||
nt|gmarco24: we can suggest to BBO:"autoplay for ruff, when partner is singleton option" :)|pg||
nt|friggi: agree to that:)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: hard work needed to make this one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: has to pop and play @hAx|pg||
nt|gmarco24: or peek in opponents cards|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  3 rounds of @S - East discarding the @C Queen... voila!|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Thick single some players call it |pg||
nt|mbruun:  Any play for 3 NT here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mathias, please take a look at the defence, I just figured out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6-7 tricks N/S - or so|pg||
nt|jbgood: operator - didnt 3 @h go down?|pg||
nt|haans: understand nothing|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wow, both souths bid 3 NT w void|pg||
nt|skaftij:  ugh|pg||
pc|d2|nt|runnerup: really strains |pg||
nt|haans: i open best minor 1@C with 3-3 = simple slam|pg||
nt|bagman: Sometimes bad things happen; it's part of the game|pg||
nt|bagman: It happens even to the best of the best|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@c and 2 aces|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Well I asked about 4@s last deal if it makes or not, the kibbs say yes and no :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: this contact is no party .. |pg||
nt|gautis2: but no double, no trouble..  probably 3 imps to Finland|pg||
nt|haans: @H5 cannot have the 8 or Q|pg||
nt|psyck: now dummy can be killed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course, there was no indication that @cs were so unevenly divided.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c should be a @d signal|pg||
pc|hA|nt|zebutin: and if now returns @D helps 1 more because ruffs winner anyway|pg||
nt|derric: and @d return now would help another|pg||
nt|iceking: another pick-up for iceland here|pg||
nt|grebrof: it is more than a party :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: @cs is just as good as any - or?|pg||
nt|sharkey: looking at all hands - yes...|pg||
nt|grebrof: well. you have 7cards in the suit and "maybe" an entrance|pg||
nt|haans: Harding do not want to play :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol - has to be a black suit I think|pg||
nt|mmmakela: seems ok in this seq|pg||
nt|haans: chicken bid by South|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mbruun:  Not the best start for defense|pg||
nt|haans: er have all seen it before many minors never found|pg||
nt|mmmakela: YES, pd has some cds|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: @S lead.:)|pg||
nt|derric: cards lie well yet again|pg||
nt|haans: they find game by not passing before|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Hulda recounting....|pg||
nt|bjurn:  it's seems like an odd choice tho, p would've passed with some high cards|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|iceking: well judged from east here go low with good @S support|pg||
nt|gautis2: think T was a fail there...|pg||
nt|gautis2: may escape with 2 off|pg||
nt|grebrof: there are reasons for 1nt with Es hand - who knows how many @cs P have - in this case W would not had passed 1nt|pg||
nt|haans: in my book K+Q = dubbleton|pg||
nt|ady: not surprising e/w stayed low    25 HCP  including stiff Q@H    5 of a minor too high  and 4@S  precarious|pg||
pc|h5|nt|derric: though can try ruff the 4th anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ???|pg||
nt|haans: @SJ hoping|pg||
nt|haans: not as good|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Vores sidste kampe i dag, kl. 17.40, er Finland-Sverige Open og Norge-Danmark Damer. Yuval will translate for you|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D was tranfer to @H?|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|bjurn:  W might try @HJ now, since S took out 2@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South would have gone down in 2@d unless he made inspired play in trumps|pg||
nt|gmarco24: wow|pg||
nt|wahlis:  well done|pg||
nt|jbennet: wd|pg||
nt|friggi: yes it is, also very nice when the King in off side anyway|pg||
nt|jbennet: declare did in fact choose the only sensible way and was rewarded for it.|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i wonder would he play it this way if there was one fast entry to hand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|mbruun:  But declarer can only come to eight tricks any way|pg||
nt|jbgood: N has shown 20-21, and 2@d was waiting - showing cards|pg||
nt|diaoff: Not straightforward on a @D lead|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|psyck: if could be a bigger pickup if this goes down, say if dec reads cards wrong|pg||
nt|psyck: well, not more confy ones @d's home|pg||
nt|ralfwil: shorten dummy with @s|pg||
nt|psyck: *now more|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, @s would have been better than @d there|pg||
nt|iceking: iam waiting for undo for this @D return|pg||
nt|psyck: lot of work still to do everywhere|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1 down|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, !K was marked off side|pg||
nt|ianmcc: all this for 1 IMP|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: a lot easier with all hands in view|pg||
nt|haans: 9 have the 8|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure it looks odd and from kibitzer point of view it looks stupid but S might have different thoughts of the auction and even different agreements|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: Fuglestad can count|pg||
nt|jbennet: so why it was the only sensible way???|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: now it's making again, if South play @h to Ace then J@h discarding @c|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|santyclz: The @s return rather than a @d cost a fatal tempo.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now East will be shortened and go -200|pg||
pc|c4|nt|grebrof: brb - my woman went away on a "businesstrip", so I am doing the laundry . imagine! :)|pg||
nt|bagman: If Gitelman Moss can go -1600 in 4@HXX with xx facing xxx we all can end up in someting silly :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cenglund:  Not a good line of play|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|derric: 7imps to finns|pg||
nt|iceking: would have been better if decl had used her entry to play @C|pg||
nt|yuval10: something like final match today at 17:40 Final-Sweden? :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: because club ace have to be right tp have a chance|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mbruun:  Forget the 10 IMPs for Denmark on board 8, and the 3 IMP for Norway on board 6. Difficulties in correcting these scores, but they are not right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so far-fetched for West to double 3 NT and take the 800 on a normal @S-lead. If you doÂ´nt now and then write 750 for the opponents, you havÂ´ent doubled enough|pg||
nt|mbruun:  The actual standing should be 20-16 for Norway|pg||
nt|gautis2: dont belive u:)|pg||
nt|haans: good play in spades|pg||
nt|mmmakela: can he make?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  No|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South will scaire all his trumps|pg||
nt|skaftij:  score|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes seems at least -1|pg||
nt|haans: but spades a worth 3 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: and Norway-Denmark ladies of course|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sure but D ruff, @S fin.... S gets 4 trumps|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjurn:  true dat! :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now can be 2 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q@S and @h to make 7 tricks|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|iceking: how about @S King now|pg||
nt|yuval10: by the way Roland, my license is for Svensk only :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: this time the @C was a winner - 1 trick difference|pg||
nt|haans: @HJ would have been tricker|pg||
nt|haans: Siuth will be endplayed|pg||
nt|haans: South|pg||
nt|phil: no he cant strip clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|haans: @SJ|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Wake-up call - it would be difficult for East to discard the @C Queen on the third @S-round - as East must follow suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: with all the nice @Ds in S, this will make|pg||
pc|d6|nt|grebrof: yes,this was not good play (or after the @HK) not good defense either|pg||
nt|sharkey: off 2 cud very well be copied OR|pg||
nt|phil: so South will take all four trump + 2 diamonds it seems|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will to to ruff @C now, @S and @S but S gets out w C|pg||
nt|haans: I agree: ldadmirer: kind of interesting but in a different way. They are wasting time which could be of better use on other bds :-)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|haans: playing hearts told West not to play diamonds|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You did well, Yuval|pg||

nt|jbgood: i am afraid the standing is 50-0 - unless 3@h really made on   25 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT for NS and tea break.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure how they play, but 1@H is possible with 0 points in some versions of this system|pg||
nt|friggi: but N-S shoudl have played trump earlier|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: big chance for E/W|pg||
nt|haans: Big diamond 17+|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not very nice to go down in NT when 7 min available|pg||
nt|bagman: S not happy, though, as he cannot be sure that he lost only 5; could be worse if team mates missed the game or went minus in the game|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@H might give Lirarna a chance here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C max for N/S - 4@H can be dangerous for E/W|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|skaftij:  9 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but he could have used @s as entry - didn't have to hook @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: east call himself an idiot, and says Hi to you all!|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: pass over 4@s by E wasn't good with 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|zebutin: cecilia didnt double with QJ1098 of spades when opponents were in 4@S...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Easy 12 tricks here in NT or @cs, let's see what Katrine and jessica will do|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S nat forcing|pg||
nt|sharkey: another slam possibility for the Finns...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another slam, this time a cold one|pg||
nt|wahlis:  2@c FG relay|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|zebutin: 3@D ? invite to fullgame?|pg||
nt|iceking: most likely final result here 4@S |pg||
nt|yuval10: this hand should be interesting as well|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: easy 3nt if no Hearts lead :)|pg||
nt|haans: may be stayman|pg||
nt|haans: stopping in 3@C good at OR|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|psyck: with a few o/t's :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 26 HCP not every day....|pg||
nt|haans: and so we learn :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - we will see|pg||
nt|haans: Big Diamonds has its problems|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H not GF I think|pg||
nt|cenglund:  You shouldn't miss this one under any circumstances|pg||
nt|grebrof: allthou these are artificial bidders - it might not be so easy|pg||
nt|haans: Magic Diamonds comes from Carroy Clubs as natural as possible (possible)|pg||
nt|psyck: this should be easier to get also for E|pg||
nt|santyclz: A slam too good for Roland  but sub-par for the rest of us.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Off an ace and qjxx of trump.|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks as if it made on a different defense than we saw.. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: but 3@H makeble|pg||
nt|mmmakela: par reached in OR|pg||
nt|mmmakela: lacking dbl to be excact|pg||
nt|phil: 2@s = 9-12|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  THis board wont take long. 450 for EW |pg||
nt|hawe45:  450 both tables, next|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s - at least on this board|pg||
nt|sharkey: as long as N can show @S support shud be in slam|pg||
nt|psyck: slam may still go down if bid, if dec played N for single @h honor|pg||
nt|jbgood: and this one presents no problems - duck and ten on a @d endplaying E|pg||
nt|runnerup: now 4h ew looks diificult to bid  -can it to made dont know but lookes possible|pg||
nt|ady: plent of strength e/w   but no fit  so will end in 3NT|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wait till he sees +5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this very thin 3NT probably has to make|pg||
nt|friggi: @S lead kills|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: what?|pg||
nt|zebutin: might be missing some pass somewhere...|pg||
nt|zebutin: maybe johanssen passed|pg||
nt|zebutin: Erkkilä bid 3@D|pg||
nt|zebutin: Andersson x:ed|pg||
nt|derric: possible|pg||
nt|zebutin: and Ahonen bid 3@H...|pg||
nt|zebutin: thats my quess|pg||
nt|zebutin: i see no way that this is the real bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: sorry, my misstake!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 5/5 bid 2@D is a risk|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D bid once and out|pg||
nt|wahlis:  2@d no SPL|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|hawe45:  Can make 480 with @C-continuation|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We really hope, that the mis-scored boards will be changed before sundau at midnoght...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  sunday|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I'm going to change them after this rond!|pg||
nt|haans: nothing say W have five spades|pg||
nt|haans: psychic bidding?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could lose only 3 @s and @dA. Anyway hypothetical|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: well - N doesnt have a lot to offer besides @s-support|pg||
nt|grebrof: did S show @S now?|pg||
nt|haans: step respone = four cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: well - thats all S needs...|pg||
nt|bagman: In principle NS lose only heart, club and a diamond in heart contract|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|iceking: on normal @C lead its possible win all the tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: it depends over the lead...if the lead is the natural @s lead then it looks like they should go for restricted choice|pg||
nt|haans: do assume that|pg||
nt|skaftij:  strange with @h suit|pg||
nt|phil: Ive been told that its good to achieve plus scores at IMPs :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: seems stupid with those hearts|pg||
nt|haans: we have all heard about that Rare :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not so sure about that, 4 of either major looks better|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but after a @d lead...|pg||
nt|iceking: creative lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: ty Hans|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Even the grand one is making|pg||
nt|sharkey: S probing - shud keep in mind they have messed up all slams so far|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud this be affecting South now?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I am not saying you should be in 7|pg||
nt|haans: missing @HK they wont|pg||
nt|haans: have they forgotten steps?|pg||
nt|haans: urkkkkkkkkkk|pg||
nt|bagman: In practice they might lose more|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|nubmaster: After this start they will get to slam and make some imps here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice bidding so far:))|pg||
nt|runnerup: this if good stagegy -double and take your money wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Probably a push board|pg||
nt|gautis2: 3N is reached..seems like a flat board |pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: if the lead isn't @s then you can still make it if the hand with 3 @h's also have 3 @d's|pg||
nt|haans: no @HT good card|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|psyck: 3/5th against suit :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: follow with @dQ|pg||
nt|iceking: unbid suit |pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sQ is a keycard|pg||
nt|jbgood: now E gets squeezed in the reds instead|pg||
nt|haans: good strategy but rare nowdays|pg||
nt|mmmakela: lead was risky imo from that holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: well, its only one board they lost in a slam position - N could hardly do anymore than 4@s now|pg||
nt|grebrof: well done by S|pg||
nt|sharkey: N thinking 7?????|pg||
nt|sharkey: extras :)?|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe its Marianne in E|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hardly - I think|pg||
nt|haans: maybe asking about bids|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead os the killer|pg||
nt|haans: is|pg||
nt|bjurn:  will be hard to find|pg||
nt|haans: true :)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  E know that partner wont hold much|pg||
nt|bagman: I would not consider a spade lead for a long time with E hand :)|pg||

nt|ady: opted for 5-2  spade fit     should have little problem with favourable lay -out|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 4@h in two rounds of bidding in OR|pg||
nt|friggi: yes here people are not wasting any cards in the box|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this would be a thin slam even if hearts broke|pg||
nt|jbennet: see if NS are on their way to get overboard. it lies with players nature to hope that the relay system may let them find a slam not bid ot the other table.|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|hawe45:  Now 12 tricks possible - in fact easy, South beeing caught in a show-up-squeeze|pg||
nt|nubmaster: The Icelandic kibbs are hoping for the grand, lol|pg||

nt|bjurn:  another great lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: @d ruff will set up a trump trick for only 1 o/t|pg||
nt|grebrof: she likes to think - which is the reason she is in this team :)|pg||

nt|jbgood: yes - I do too|pg||
nt|haans: its not MP|pg||
nt|haans: but cost nothing|pg||

nt|bagman: A spade or a diamond now?|pg||

nt|gmarco24: does bidding table here has a scroll option?  :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but must lose 1@h & 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: Upmark picked up 6@H, but put it back again!|pg||

nt|ianmcc: a joker with J10x|pg||

nt|mbruun:  They are not listening to you, Hans|pg||
nt|zebutin: np, it happens to everyone|pg||
nt|grebrof: I never get overtricks either - my chances in pairs are opps making mistakes :D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or 2 if av|pg||
nt|ady: kib suggests 6@C can make without a trump lead   ambitious  but maybe possible|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hawe45:  Normal for me|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 @H not a bad contr here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: a hughe score for Finland in OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: the Swede pair in the OR failed to reach 6@d as well ( speaking of board 8 ). This doesn't look like the best of set for them|pg||
nt|psyck: EW have a good sac against the @s game|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|iceking: 3@D maybe|pg||
nt|gautis2: pretty good lay in 5@c :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: (or 3N(|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2@c should give some gaz to N here too|pg||
nt|haans: why 1@H instead of 4|pg||
nt|runnerup: but unlucky|pg||
nt|jwit: Should be a push here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 @C at second trick declarer would try to duck his K|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, let's say doubleton K@c at W would leat to 6@h making!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: i @D call helps but ensures defeat in 4|pg||
nt|jbennet: this hand illsutrates the reason why evolution doesnt prmote relay systems.t |pg||
mb|3C!|nt|grebrof: 3@h?|pg||
nt|grebrof: S has normally shown a good and - and shes got one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting board.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Nothing exciting unless someone decides to shed more BLOOD|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last segment in Sweden postponed 15 minutes. New start time: top of the hour|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good pass from North - very tempting to X|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: an option  3rd seat fav for sure|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Pass: 0-7/17+|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@C: 8-11, 5+@C|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@D relay (17+)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: as  suppdbl promising 3|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iceking: for sure|pg||
nt|psyck: will poor breaks they will all do well to lie low however|pg||
nt|gautis2: 3N?|pg||
nt|haans: you may need to finesse clubs here|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: seems like overbid|pg||
nt|haans: may be hard bidding only game|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@D 3-3-1-6|pg||
nt|gulyas: double, with Ax in @H?|pg||
nt|gulyas: you mean 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: maybe invite 55 only|pg||
nt|grebrof: I like 4@c too|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's a big stop by N.... A@s K@d A@c is all she needs to slam|pg||
nt|haans: only 3 in OR|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H must be forcing|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Rdl = 3@s?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: never|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 12-14 notrump...but they seem to stop at reasonable level still...most likely wont make, but atleast its not in red...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@c is like Gazzilli, strong (any) or nat with @cs|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@h is minimum vs the strong hand with 2c support|pg||
nt|gautis2: oh..4 @c solved all problems|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|haans: why not 1@S with tre spades|pg||
nt|haans: three|pg||
nt|fabsayc: transfer style overcall is a game killer here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: routine 3NT I'll leave now with scores almost locked. Bye and thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: 2N = asking for 3c M, 3@C denied it|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: 5c of couse|pg||
nt|friggi: yes they can be a double edge swords|pg||
pc|d2|nt|grebrof: well done|pg||
nt|jbennet: North was hoping for a dream scenario , but south:s hand was pretty much what could be expected.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mbruun:  4H/S should be quite easy to reach, and nothing in the play. Dull board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  12-14 tror jeg|pg||
nt|cenglund:  5C depends on 1 successful finesse and DA onside, I wouldnt't stretch my luck that much|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 down - nothing much in it|pg||
nt|haans: lead hearts taking awat entry to fummy and spade finesses|pg||
nt|haans: d|pg||
nt|jbgood: unless S return a spade|pg||
nt|jbgood: (or even a @d ?)|pg||
nt|haans: but not enough|pg||
nt|haans: decl counting 9?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C finesse and @S play can reduce @D loosers to 2. Only Chance that I see.|pg||
nt|haans: recount shortly|pg||
nt|derric: scoring 4 black trick, 4 trumps and 2 ruffs would make 10|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not easy and may not make.|pg||
nt|gulyas: never double? agree|pg||
nt|ianmcc: never 3@d|pg||
nt|gulyas: disagree:)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yuval10: but it's rather hard to inquier.... 5@d from N would probably be natural|pg||
nt|haans: yep start with hearts|pg||
nt|bjurn:  that would promise 4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  for running scores|pg||
nt|ianmcc: probably cheaper than X here|pg||
nt|friggi: what about 3NT?|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think its a close call between 3@D and pass, but I would never ever double|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|iceking: ufh|pg||
nt|iceking: east had no reason bid 3@D here |pg||
nt|nubmaster: Jessica thinks... well it's teams :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt actually makes agains normal d lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=475&csm=Rank&nt=3&nb=1&csh=0000000000111|pg||
nt|haans: but can ever 3nt be bid|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N shd do more?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|derric: ducking a @s?|pg||
nt|psyck: it was going well upto the 3@c bid :)|pg||
nt|iceking: bidding suggest pd has 0-1@D|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@S long @C and most likely 3@H|pg||
nt|gautis2: after 600  u just hate to hear: push board:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: you are vul - we have seen their style earlier too|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The merit of the contact is that it's unbeatable|pg||
nt|grebrof: now dont need d! A onside anymore - providing a switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: true Christer|pg||
pc|s6|nt|diaoff: Only 6 trick available here, but might be hard for S to discard correctly on @D|pg||
nt|bjurn:  was wrong about E strength, shows 8-16|pg||
nt|bagman: They might find that they are off 2 keycards in clubs|pg||
nt|haans: on a pure finesse (clubs)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3NT: 3 controls (A=2, K=1)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@D: no @C control (or @CAKQ)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  W knows that @Cs are, at best, on a finesse|pg||
nt|jwit: Declarer says Oh No, not a spade lead|pg||
nt|friggi: in E ofcause|pg||
nt|gulyas: if nv W can have such a powerful hand, then maybe...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT for E/W that 3@c was loaded|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs 7 solid @Cs and something else, and maybe a lucky lie of cards or defensive error|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, but both players open 3@C|pg||
nt|ianmcc: bye now back in 45|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mmmakela: promises 4 and min I guess|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Would seem best to bid 2 @s with 4|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d shift and -2|pg||
nt|grebrof: you finnish or swedish?|pg||
nt|runnerup: can be beateng ofcause can make olso|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Immediate Law|pg||
pc|c3|nt|zebutin: opponents seem to be on right road by removing the trumps in both hands, diamonds arent even so they wont bring anything extra to the table|pg||
nt|ianmcc: playing @s looks best|pg||
nt|grebrof: or just simply South African?|pg||
nt|grebrof: "the @c K is always single?"|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Finnish, but I lived 7 years in South Africa|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|derric: now i don't see an alternative to the @c finesse|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here a crazy 6@S is ON with this layout|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: will make now! win with @hK and a @s to @sA discard a @d on @cK|pg||
nt|bjurn:  but if E has @DA instead of @HA 6@C is still a good contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only if 2@H promised spades, might not|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: not all would have bid game here|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - pick up for the Finns here as game not bid OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: 10 IMPs back|pg||
nt|haans: im of skaftj side|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Many thanks to Johanna, our excellent operator in Örebro. Well done as usual!|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pelu: HL = odd No|pg||
nt|ralfwil: very bad defence|pg||
nt|nubmaster: and it will make now|pg||
nt|haans: discarding not always funnt|pg||
nt|haans: funny|pg||
nt|mmmakela: check out the situation in open series live|pg||
nt|mmmakela: very tight|pg||
nt|haans: they are that bad? :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|runnerup: perhaps 4h has best changes-but no here so 5  ti D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bjurn:  and further relaying wont help, they'll end up too high|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I like suppdbl equeiviant there|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: and to all our commentators|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|diaoff: and that settles it|pg||

nt|psyck: on deal 10, after the same start, def switched to @d to beat the contract|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Thank you Roland|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|nubmaster: sry Ralf, didn't read your row there|pg||
nt|runnerup: open everybody bid 6 clubs in 26 .with diamond void and very good cards|pg||

nt|gmarco24: thanks for watching, see you soon|pg||
pc|d8|nt|derric: might make additional @s in the end|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gmarco24: i guess that catching the 9@d in trick one was a bad idea|pg||
