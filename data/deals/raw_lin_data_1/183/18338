nt|yorkbeach:  very few pairs play Kantar's recommended method|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  which is 1430 when the strong hand does the asking (as here)|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: People sat in wrong chairs, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Play suspended, TD goes to check the Open Room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That explains a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Players think they're in the right chairs, Open Room wrong?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: was it the last european where england was sitting wrongly and it wasnt discovered till the end of the set?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: that will give commentators time to calculate if 4@h makes, if he's allowed to play it!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: The director on the ball this time|pg||

nt|yo_yo: weak in @D or strong ?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: and a 9 card fit is easier in some ways but if you have to ruff two spades you might miss the chance to ruff three hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: how do people feel about 2s holding 4-card h|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzfv: this is the clash between the top two on the leaderboard: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/Internationals/SeniorsCamrose2011.htm|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|pjs_ch: 2@C here is either strong or a weak two in diamonds|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: this 3@C bid wil create some excitedment in North|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: he doesn't look particularly excited|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: coudl it be intended as an unassuming cue?|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulhac:  And NI are 3 ahead of England, but playing a resurrgent Scotland|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Holland moved to alert 3@h, but decided not to|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jcomyn: and will E find the s lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: JOhn Holland brushes the multi aside with disdain |pg||
nt|yo_yo: we call it the "dreaded multi"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: no @S cue bid- no interest|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am quite relaxed about it if I am weak |pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|pjs_ch: looks an impregnable contract, this|pg||
nt|mcarroll: infrangible  is I believe the commentator's term for this|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the 3@C bid is interesting, maybe they play opener's bid as a cue bid agreeing @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Scores are up-to-date at http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/Internationals/SeniorsCamrose2011.htm|pg||
nt|peachy: Practical bid, assume that partner has his share of outstanding HCP|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but this west hand is to strong for me|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I often do it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: yes, John H is a local boy so we are all rooting for him|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: lebensohl i presume|pg||
nt|yo_yo: usually 2NT is 16-18 balanced but i dont know their system|pg||

pc|hT|nt|dburn: not sure whether East saw it that way|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzfv: she did, she's explained it as such|pg||
nt|dburn: still, might not be so easy for the defenders to cash out|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d5|nt|pjs_ch: It's a most weak suit in which to overcall btu with a 5431 shape you do want to bid|pg||
nt|dburn: although North knows enough to cash the club next, at least|pg||
nt|dburn: unless West would ask for a club stopper with a void in clubs and nothing in spades, which seems unlikely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Lindsay's pondering this|pg||
nt|dburn: Burns ought to give count, not attitude, if North plays @cA next|pg||
nt|dburn: but I guess his signal will be the same in either case|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: the CC says standard count so yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: that sounds like a cue bid, but it isnt |pg||

nt|yo_yo: i think john H will bid on|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he is maximum with great controls|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|vugraphzfv: it appears Gunnar forgot the system, 3@s explained as @h slam try - he's explaining now to opp what he thinks he has.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I suppose North is worried that JH has 16-18 balanced and therefore not enough for a slam|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|pjs_ch: a lot of declarer's points (@SQ and @DQ) are wasted or slam woudl be good|pg||
nt|dburn: as against that, 4@h puts pressure on the opponents, while 1@h might end up putting pressure on partner, who thinks you have more high-card strength than you do|pg||

pc|d4|nt|dburn: North didn't show his primary club support at all - I don't know why he doubled 3@s rather than bidding 5@c (or even 4@s)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: the double showed something-or-other but I didn't catch the explanation|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: wrong way up - thats why i hate weak nt|pg||

nt|dburn: well, 2@c is either natural or any good hand (16+ or so)|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h shows a bad hand with hearts|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: good case here for 2N being scrambling - saying to partner to pick a suit - that woudl have got to 3@C|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: strong ten lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: here we go again with a 6-3 c fit - wears me out|pg||
nt|paulhac:  It needed a spade lead to beat it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Hallberg's looking for a bombproof line, if there is one|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|yo_yo: i suppose 50/50 between @S & @H though|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: even so, North might have bid 4@d rather than 4@h - slam is not out of the question|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: well, no one would seriously lead a club|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but it worked well|pg||
nt|yo_yo: really?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Hallberg demanding a spade?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems like it  |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Holland considering @sK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|dburn: and even with the bad hand South has, it doesn't need a lot more than the club finesse|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pjs_ch: but actually 3@C was going off anyway|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @C & @S i mean|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: pity hallberg has no entry |pg||
pc|s8|nt|dburn: still, that wasn't working, so no harm done|pg||
nt|dburn: still, a diamond was not out of the question - but the modern style is very much to lead as passively as you can after 1NT-all pass|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mcarroll: with that hand the only excuse for S to double rather than bid @Cs is that pd did not overcall a 5 card suit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcomyn: not the point we see far too much opf ignoring Clubs andf only taking a sideways look at D suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: not sure I heard explanations correctly but it'll be on the CC :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: last night there was a very unlucky 7@c / 7@s contract|pg||
nt|dburn: looks like a specific-king asking sequence rather than wholesale|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Both partners held AKQT9x facing xxx in their suits|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case East may bid 6@h to ask for the king of those|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Both suits broke 4-0 offside, the defender having Jxxx|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well Kath so few women are over 60!!!|pg||
nt|dburn: good decision - a grand slam that needs 3-2 trumps is just about worth bidding, but only just about|pg||
nt|dburn: if it needs anything else at all, it enters the dodgy category|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Where they pushed or would they have led it anyway|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: i believe the average age of the US player is 68 years|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a true story - a dublin golf club advertised an open event fo ladies over 60 - they got 6 entries|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they shouldnt have passed out 19 for a start|pg||
nt|hedyg: remember that they play 4 card majors so when he bid 2@s here it looked like 3 card fit|pg||

nt|vugraphzfu: Yep, I will.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfu: Apparently the result I gave for NI v Scotland was after just 7 boards scored, so things could have changed in the other 7.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we all owe a big thanks to Michael Clark, who has been the operator all weekend|pg||
nt|vugraphzfu: It's been exciting. Ireland looked to be running away with it at one point, but have had a disappointing last day. Wales' big 25-0 win over them has kept it all nice and close.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if NI score 20, that would mean a tie in VPs|pg||

nt|vugraphzfu: Still waiting on the other one.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfu: I'm told they're changing the regs to include a split-tie procedure, so this could be the last ever tie! :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Michael is right - the change will affect all the home international competitions|pg||

nt|dburn: jeu Irlande du Nord|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont usually play th Wolf sign-off but it would have been good there|pg||
nt|granguru: W is to be blamed 80% or perhaps 85%--for the 4@S bid|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pjs_ch: and 7@C just as good a contract, also doomed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: now this is really ridiculous - this game can drive you mad a 4-0 break again|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will it be a flat board all round ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Precision wheels in motion here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i blame both for not playing strong nt|pg||
nt|granguru: another partial hand|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: spanners inserted|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this aul spannner may keep them at 6|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: awkward for North who has a lot of extra values|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: everything's offside here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@H now|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: i was right |pg||
nt|mcarroll: spanners may alert them to bad distribution |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Jim never refuses an invitation :)|pg||
nt|granguru: I would like to top you John...really bright...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: thats what i meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: remarkable that NS bought this in the OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: looks like Multi at other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: played the other way up - any difference?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: will hallberg duck the @D i wonder|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: I suppose that's a "yes" :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzfv: par contract?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: or a fortunate 11 imps for the NI team :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: last board of the set now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: tomorrow morning we start at 11:00 with Wales v Scotland|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: poor result too for Scotland on this last board; hard ot reach 12 tricks although there is only one loser|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: in other room Scotland let NI steal it in 3@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: last board of the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: that finished rather abruptly :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we will resume tomorrow at 10:00|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: board 28 arrives|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hmmm says his partner |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I'm glad no-one's accused me of mismousing that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Players are just updating match card|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: and now start on 28|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: well done Tim,  and thanks David |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: which is the last of the match and event|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: we missed the play on 23|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: many thanks to all helpers, BBO, Roland, and vugraph ops - hope it was fun|pg||
nt|dburn: vile opening lead problem for South|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2@S  - 4@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: a bit of chat from the other table that just played 28 - they are silenced by TD|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks like it - they love their 4-3 fits in wales|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@H looks difficult to make|pg||
mb|2N|an|F|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 3@C is a bit of an underbid|pg||
nt|dburn: still, with the cards as they are nothing matters all that much|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Burns sighs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I'm assured he did make it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: I don't blame him|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: doesn't like his choices much|pg||
nt|dburn: and the sight of dummy won't alleviate his dismay at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we're getting chat from patio outside|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: why did north lead K@D, did i miss something?|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps declarer just played a diamond to the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: he thought he was cutting Dixon off, he was as surprised as anyone to see @dQ fall from declarer's hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this time 3-3 never happens to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: have to rename them, not "Moysian" any more but "Welsh" :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: auction started the same way in other room; it was a surprise that South passed 3@C|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: oops 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Irish captain moves to close window|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: the play was as you saw it|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, OK - that was also possible|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that sounds good - Welsh Fits|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: he'll be expecting declarer to win and cash four diamonds, giving him three discards...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: bridge chat, I meant!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: thanks to all our commentators over last 3 days: Kath Nelson, Joe Shair, Hedy Grey, David Burn, Cliff Gillis, Paul Hackett, Ian Crorie, John Comyn|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: ah bid the blooming thing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: he chose not to :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pjs_ch: am surprised now to find South pass; partner known to be short in spade so hands fitting well|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3-3 and the finesse working , it's Wales' lucky day|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Probably played a low heart to dummy and the 10 went up|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a big thanks to you Tim, you deserve a holiday|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: it did, actually|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: I have to say this failure to bid minor games and slams has me totally baffled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North should have supported @C sooner |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that void is magic|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a really excellent club game whats wsrong with the players|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Burns will like that|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|dburn: so he'll be mightily pleased to see not only the queen of diamonds but also the ten of hearts|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: flat board to finish  so a small win to GB |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 4 IMP = 16-14 VP|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfv: wonder why Lindsay didn't plough on with @h|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s7|nt|vugraphzfv: Brian McDowell smiles as he plays @sQ|pg||
nt|granguru: AROUND 24% chances|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we need to know how Ireland is doing, they are/were in the lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: well, Burns had to play the three, and to Lindsay that might have looked discouraging - "go back to spades, partner"|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: I have been told by more than one NPC you must bid vulnerable games at teams|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i hope they bought lottery tickets|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yo_yo: we all know that but it's easier said than done|pg||
nt|yo_yo: shame it's only one table shown on vugraph|pg||
nt|yo_yo: why not all 3?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: no other results yet but I'm sure Michael will have them up sharpish on the EBU site|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: as to why not all 3 - resources?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: whose resources?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: operators give their time freely|pg||
nt|yo_yo: BBO free|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: six BBO operators, wireless connection - but I'm only a dogsbody so you'd have to ask those in the know|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Manchester always has loads of helpers, not oxford?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we must ferry some of your chaps down!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or maybe hold it here :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: maybe!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but then I wouldn't be operating|pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyway good job tim , are you and Michael the only operators?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: yes, we're booked for the weekend|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: thank you! See you tomorrow ...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: see you tomorrow, thanks everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Dinner time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: and disco, if you believe Michael|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|s2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: thanks all, back at 14:40 - in 1h 10 minutes time. Lunch now for the players|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx all interesting set|pg||
nt|granguru: way to beat the hand would have been a @HQ lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 14-5 would be 17-13 in VP, if it stays that way|pg||
nt|granguru: if declarer plays low...then a small one|pg||
nt|granguru: have seen such a play in South american championship 1984...Ricardo Poleschi in the finals against Brasil|pg||
nt|granguru: closed room was on the third floor of the hotel. vugraph was in the lobby...|pg||
nt|granguru: applauses were so great  when he led what I have announced as the only possibility that we thought declarer would hear them and act accordingly|pg||
nt|granguru: Le Bridgeur published it even SA was an unknown bridge territory at the time|pg||
nt|granguru: see you all soon open room...|pg||
nt|granguru: Guten Apetit.|pg||
nt|granguru: Wir sehen uns...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzfv: a convincing win for Ireland|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: that's all for now, folks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Next match at 15:40, most likely Wales v Ireland|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: one hour from now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphzfv: right, all over|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: OR playing 25 but this looks like enough for Wales assuming no disasters in the NI - SCO match|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Wales have done more than enough, it looks like. Michael will have the final scores online as soon as he can after play finishes.|pg||
