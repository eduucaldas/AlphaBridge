pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: I think North has 1430'd in clubs and now asked for @CQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think maybe they have set the wrong suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and perhaps Smirnov wouold have been better off bidding 3@D over 3@C ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this will be a VERY important board|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but of course I am just guessing|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|vugrapha3: Alex alerted the 5h bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so it must mean something for him|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: But no, I was right with my analysis, and here they are in a truly dreadful contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's up to Geo to find the deadly spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's certainly plausible to lead the spade ... it's the "unbid" suit, and he has a little something in it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My post-mortem of this auction is that the 4@C bid was wrong.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 3@C was fine ... he had no spade stopper, so the mark-time bid of 3@C was indicated|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it is clear now...missunderstanding in bidding|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Great work Geo!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and a spade lead|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Running the diamond jack works beautifully to neutralize 10x in South|pg||
nt|steshome: Hinden stretching for a non-vul game here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|georgia19: bit thin for 3NT, but they have 24HCP between them, do you fancy Graham to get this on the card?|pg||
nt|steshome: I think Sime will duck the first heart and in time collect 2@H tricks and 3@D tricks - i don't think Hinden should move. No fitting cards in partner's suit|pg||

nt|steshome: Questionable high low in spades by North to give the count - Will Osborne believe him?|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: probably this one flat as well|pg||
mb|2D|nt|georgia19: another messy hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: West has a spade stopper|pg||
nt|bjacobs: gilt-edged|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes AKQ we can define as agood stopper|pg||
nt|serhat: but 2d?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A bit heavy for you Serhat?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|serhat: not just me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East had an interesting alternative:  3@S asking for a stopper|pg||
nt|serhat: ohh Smirnow saved it|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: wow..alexaved them|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: saved them|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Smirnov has a totally normal balancing double.  It's not his fault his opponents are crazy|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: why not rdbl now|pg||
nt|steshome: do you prefer 1@S chosen by jagger in the other room, or 2@H, georgia?|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: Yeah, it's horrible, but I think West was asleep at the wheel. |pg||
nt|georgia19: should be a close call to make this one|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|serhat: He didnt see his 7.5 tricks hand properly|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And there's no doubt East had a second chance to clarify his massive strength, and 3@D didn't really do that|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|georgia19: when I have a fit in a limited hand I like to say so, so 2@h for me|pg||
nt|steshome: I quite agree |pg||
nt|steshome: Is there another set after this one?|pg||
nt|georgia19: 1@s nf so could be left in a 5-1 fit which is silly when you know you have a heart fit|pg||
nt|steshome: Ah, good point|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: Board 8 of 32|pg||

nt|steshome: 4@S a curious call in the other room, don't you think?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|georgia19: bizarre|pg||
nt|steshome: although 3NT needs inspiration to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgia19: hate aceless 1NT overcalls, even with 17,,,|pg||
nt|steshome: that's why i don't like this 4@S bid with no aces|pg||
nt|steshome: and the lack of 3 trumps!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: Very sad result for E/W who were having a very nice set up till then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And Sveindal might be saying: "I didn't expect you to be that strong, hence my pass".  So technically, the blame goes to the partnership|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: ahh W.. no I dont agree with you.. I blame E . 2d can be anything. he has no @D fitno good clubs or H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh well, that's what makes horseracing.  The 2@D bid is a matter of partnership style, I guess|pg||
nt|serhat: at least he could have rdbled|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry...i saw first 1 heart lol|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: then i looked better |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|georgia19: but was the E hand really worth a jump, may be 5-5 but only a 7 count in HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgia19: this is not much better.....|pg||
nt|georgia19: what now E?|pg||
nt|steshome: All a bit murky but I suppose East must push when vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: Contract is 3NT to W|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|serhat: might dbl|pg||
nt|bjacobs: might bid 5@D|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|steshome: after heart to the ace and one back, Hinden needs to overtake the K@C and play a spade to the 9 to make. |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|vugrapha3: you wanted action...we have action|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wonder if he could have diagnosed his partner's spade singleton?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If South's double showed 3 spades, and North's 2@H shows 5-4 shape in the majors, then bob's your uncle|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So he could double 4@H, play @SA, @S4, @HA, spade, down up front|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: @CA in the middle|pg||
nt|serhat: I think Milne team is very close to win now|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, if he had bought @HA instead of @HK, 4@S is in with a fighting chance|pg||
