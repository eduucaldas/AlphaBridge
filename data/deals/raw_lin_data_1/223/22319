pc|h2|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: leading a diamond will only work when a force on north stops declarer using a long suit there, say spades|pg||
nt|iceking: but 1430 is a huge result with these values, and iam sure both N/S pairs will be dissapointed not gain on this board|pg||

nt|iceking: problem is w has no idea there is a @S in dummy might as well be @C suit like 3-5-0-5 shape |pg||
nt|athene: yes but when you have two possible suits to attack, you go for the one without the ace|pg||
nt|iceking: he has such a strong holding in both black suits |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|hJ|nt|athene: of course a club will be costly sometimes but i don't think it's out of the question|pg||
nt|iceking: both Tens that often make it harder run the suit|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||

nt|Walddk2: ouch|pg||
nt|iceking: 14hcp with void seldom happens, it might though|pg||
nt|athene: seldom, but 2@C is quite pre-emptive, and probably pd can't bid diamonds naturally very easily|pg||
nt|athene: so he might pass with 9 or 10 points and some diamonds|pg||
nt|iceking: just silly bidding from the start, S also should never  bid 1Nt with this holding, wrongside a possible 3nt contract is just crime|pg||
