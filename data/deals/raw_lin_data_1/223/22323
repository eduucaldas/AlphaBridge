nt|vugraphzae: After 23 comes 13|pg||
nt|clinch: Well 9 tricks on 13 after K@h lead|pg||
nt|jbennet: on a lucky day there might be an escape spot (1NT is surely not 1 of them)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice only in Open Room this set  [actually all sets except 1st of day]|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: if pd has a diamond stop the contract is down whatever you do, so you discount that|pg||

nt|iceking: not often you dont even hold 9 in your hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: agree with William - not easy at all|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 3 tricks in 1 NT x seems too much... E is squeezed on the 5th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N=any 2-suits|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how many overbids will we see on this hand|pg||
nt|athene: now north's bids are usually taken as "pass or correct"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is count so far martin?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 out of 3|pg||
nt|athene: he might find it difficult to say "i want to play in diamonds even though you don't have diamonds, pd"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at these colors, i thought you might only count 4N|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bvdahl: 5th @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@D/5N/6@D all seem reasonable|pg||
mb|5H|nt|clinch: Hid a losing spade behind his trumps?|pg||
nt|iceking: nice hand w has here|pg||
nt|iceking: east has 15hcp pretty sure he didnt pass|pg||
nt|jbennet: time if they find the 4-3 major fit it might go only -3 off (= same as 3NT NS)|pg||
nt|iceking: north also needs to discard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|clinch: My guess, looking at the board is that NS will have made 3NT on 13, gaining 900 since other room conceded 300|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: s j simon: when you're fixed, stay fixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: surely this is not right|pg||
nt|bigtrain: zia is playing with chip martel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Walter -- this tourney ends some well known partnerships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: martel-stansby  splitting after 30+ years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zia-hamman parting ways|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hamman with his new partner, Justin Lall  won the 3-day Platinum Pairs this week|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well the underbids were going to balance the overbids till that double|pg||
nt|jbgood: xfor a @d lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still i suppose this double has to be lead directing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Though when asked what the double was, W said could be "do you want to bid again" or a real double.|pg||
nt|athene: i am not actually convinced south has his bid here, at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with the singleton in spades you might feel you have to act, but with Ax, there is not so much pressure, as partner is finding a double more often|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iceking: blah this is probably not right either:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzae: Sorry, this is right|pg||
nt|iceking: eh i dont think so sry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kranyak only opens 3@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|clinch: This looks totally wrong|pg||
nt|clinch: Contract might be right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: pass on 2 hands with 15 points|pg||
nt|iceking: could be wrong board|pg||
nt|clinch: Ah yes, a spec points out we skipped board 13|pg||
nt|vugraphzae: sorry, wrong board|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d8|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i am from vancouver, we are use to "a lot wet"|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: yes south has something of a decision over 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: advancing a 3nt overcall is a really nasty area of bidding|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|iceking: S not thinking 3@C been discarded |pg||
nt|ahollan1: continuation [so far]   4@C[ask]-4@H [assume a trick-taking 3N rather than hcp]|pg||

nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|iceking: iam sure it was 500 though|pg||
nt|clinch: Was that only -2?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: good score EW here in CR|pg||

nt|clinch: EW are making some good claims!|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4@h makes NS and didn't get x|pg||
nt|vugraphzae: yes, he made a mistake, but they played so fast at the end|pg||
nt|athene: yes maybe 3@S is not THAT wet - his suit really is not very good :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: does Cullin open here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 7411 at favorable vul  [you not vul, they vul]   4@S looks right to me|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|iceking: ew will not enter the bidding here|pg||
nt|jbennet: west passed 1 h ??|pg||

nt|iceking: so 11 imps as 4@H making|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jbennet: now west can bid 4NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 0+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well NS here might find a 4-4 heart fit and then find they have all the trumps and all the aces and kings, and think that entitles them to some high-level contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@D=hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transfer responses, but 1@C=3+|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: often weak NT, but here  4+@D and LONGER @S|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=MAX, 5@S & 4+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H must be a transfer    that's one i hadn't seen before|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|Walddk2:  West passed over 4@H, North bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  18 4N North|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: did east really dbl 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzae: will do|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2:  Undo again please|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6@H can make, east squeezed|pg||
nt|athene: yes east can be squeezed in spades and diamonds|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|athene: and you can combine that chance with the boring 3-3 diamond break i would think|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: over transfer responses  2@H isn't really a "jump"   it is same as 1@C-1@H//2@H   4-fit, minimum opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sort of duck a diamond early, then ruff a club and run trumps|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|athene: and you are home if diamonds are 3-3 or someone got squeezed, as east will be|pg||
mb|6H|nt|Walddk2:  12 tricks?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: strange w didnt push to 5@C if east dbled 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: well deserved +11. |pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and we will se if he gets it right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what was 6@C, maybe two side kings?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: boards are NOT duplicated during these matches -- except Semi-Final where both matches on vugraph|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Either the Club K or the other 2|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they play that when you have two side kings you bid the suit you DON'T have the king in|pg||
nt|athene: the idea being that pd will have that king and will know you must have the other two|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jbgood: nice Sahron !|pg||
nt|athene: well either that or he will just assume you have forgotten the system|pg||
nt|jbgood: Sry - Sharon|pg||
nt|jillan:  any make?|pg||

nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jillan:  I have two suggestions: strip AK, AK and play 3rd @C disc @S|pg||

nt|fabsayc: needs to manage entries for the squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: yes but spades and diamonds are both very flexible i.e. winner in each hand|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Bathurst-Zagorin do NOT play transfers over 1@C  so 6@H North -- doubt that matters but tougher lead for East|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: yes the @D9 is a bit interesting but after you see that club break, the chances of east being short in diamonds is pretty low|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like proper technique to me, now diamond duck and claim |pg||
nt|fabsayc: last hurdle on spade shift must win in dummy|pg||

nt|athene: no way to get a club away on a diamond here even if you viewed to win king and finesse|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he upgraded then went timid after that, having extras after 1@D opening he might have persisted to 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: well i think north has shown his hand pretty well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wasn't next @S bid up to South??|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: seems North 1N//2@S perfect description of his hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: if he knew about 3 spades with prd - yes|pg||

nt|iceking: 1@D negative 2@C stayman|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  Send me an email at roland_wald@@hotmail.com if you want to a copy of my article "World Class Disasters on BBO Vugraph" and the creation of the "Ministry of Silly Bids and Contracts". I can't take *your* email address here, sorry|pg||
nt|athene: but even then, the diamond finesse immediately is no good as south has a trump for the diamond ace|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my point is if you stretch initially you will underbid later, so upgrading on marginal hands is not so clearly a winner|pg||
nt|jbgood: these boards are much more important than people think - 3 @h making versus 3 @s making OT|pg||
nt|jillan:  so funny Waldo|pg||
nt|athene: yes but the idea is that if you stretch originally it does not matter if you back off later as partner will do what needs to be done|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Smith echo will apply here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bigtrain: the bulk do...  but several are amatuers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at trick 2, when declarer plays HIS suit, defenders who do not need to show count, use carding to say whether or not they like the opening lead|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he wont for fear you stretched :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think the biggest problem here is that north has only @HAx|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: and south, even knowing of 3 spades opposite, might not want to compete to 3@S, because his partner could have a lot more in the heart suit|pg||

nt|athene: transfer rebids are a mildly cute way to take advantage of an "always unbalanced" 1@D opener|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you overcome some awkward hands e.g. 5@D4@H but not reversing strength|pg||
nt|athene: also you can use a 3-step bidding plan to show good complicated hands e.g. 5431|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: just reminded rest of week start times 1 hour earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: one of those hands, its very hard to reach slam here|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  -- actually was surprised by this start time, thought all sessions in 2012 would be 1 hour earlier than 2011|pg||
nt|athene: more likely to get to 4@H if you open 1@H, although 3nt might still be the final spot of course|pg||
pc|c6|nt|clinch: Very difficult slam to bid after 1NT opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common for 3@S to force 3N   but atypical to use 2N-3N as artificial|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: canape developed by Frenchman  Pierre Albarran   popularized by multiple systems used by Italian Blue Team|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S forcing 3nt - quite a few pairs play this; the idea is you can use 3nt to show something else, and you can move after 3nt here with various hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 3@S is ONLY way to play 3N|pg||
nt|athene: disadvantage is giving a lead double of 3@S and (maybe more importantly) partner forgetting 2nt - 3nt and passing it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canap%C3%A9_(bridge)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: perhaps easier if you can open with a natural 1@c|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but was this sequenced some sort of a slam-try, I wonder?|pg||
nt|clinch: Not sure why N bid the way he did|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe he was thinking if pd has 4@D i will try something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sabine auken - daniela von arnim play some canape sequences|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lynn deas and i created mechanism using 2N-3N artificial  during long drive to a tourney in 1980|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at end of drive we concluded -- too easy to hear 2N-3N//PASS|pg||
nt|athene: you shouldn't be driving whilst blind drunk|pg||
nt|athene: i am told you can have the "reverse problem" - you bid 2nt - 3nt and partner assumes YOU forgot, and passes it anyway, even though HE knows it is supposed to be forcing :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: The idea by showing a side suit is to find another 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|bvdahl: xx now showing 1st round control, then W will know that opponents can't take 2 spade tricks on the lead?|pg||
nt|iceking: i assume as this is from sweden 3@D means no stiff and good hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nystrom sees @SK  and does internal groan|pg||

nt|bvdahl: I use pass as asking for what kind of control pd gas|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: groan from @SK is because 3nt is a lot better :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|iceking: those relay system like Baldursson-Jonsson play  Nyström-Upmark Grötheim-pd would reach 7@C here easy |pg||
nt|iceking: reason is after they show shape they show location of all top Honors so it will be easy for east in the end bid correct spot|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  29  Zagorin also bids 4@C    Schwartz in West  bids 5@C  [i like it - we should have discussed here :(]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Kranyak continued with 6@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Director has told this table not to play Board 32 yet.  It looks unlikely that other table will get to it, and he doesn't want open room to play if they can't.  If closed room ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: picks up their pace, then the board will be played.  So stand by|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C is a slight stretch, but perhaps less so than 4@S an underbid|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i don't understand having this table delay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why not just play the board and if Closed doesn't catch up -- throw it out|pg||

nt|athene: and even if pd has something in clubs it will be hard to set up clubs and use them with the lead taking out the @DA at trick 1|pg||
