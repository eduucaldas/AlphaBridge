nt|vugrapha3: Alex alerted the 5h bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so it must mean something for him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The good thing is that diamonds is the "boss" suit, at least of the minors.  Smirnov knows about the 8-card fit there|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But no, I was right with my analysis, and here they are in a truly dreadful contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's up to Geo to find the deadly spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's certainly plausible to lead the spade ... it's the "unbid" suit, and he has a little something in it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My post-mortem of this auction is that the 4@C bid was wrong.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 3@C was fine ... he had no spade stopper, so the mark-time bid of 3@C was indicated|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it is clear now...missunderstanding in bidding|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: Great work Geo!|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Running the diamond jack works beautifully to neutralize 10x in South|pg||
nt|steshome: Hinden stretching for a non-vul game here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|georgia19: bit thin for 3NT, but they have 24HCP between them, do you fancy Graham to get this on the card?|pg||
nt|steshome: I think Sime will duck the first heart and in time collect 2@H tricks and 3@D tricks - i don't think Hinden should move. No fitting cards in partner's suit|pg||

pc|d3|nt|serhat: Nye is sorry for 2d bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He spent the rest of the auction backtracking.  Surely he owed partner a 4@H bid over 4@C|pg||
nt|serhat: because he didnt have real 2d bid. may be 3c better there|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so the match is getting closer|pg||

mb|2C|mb|d|nt|bjacobs: 3@D doesn't look forcing to me|pg||
nt|serhat: well may be 2nt =not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One of the problems with this auction is that E/W don't know South's suit.  Hence they have no easy cue-bids|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: wow|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think it's remotely forcing.  But it's certainly constructive, and certainly at least a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: flat board|pg||
nt|georgia19: NS playing strong NT so EW find spade fit.....cards badly placed for them|pg||
nt|steshome: E/W play 2@S bid by Hinden as showing the weakest hnad for an o/call in preference to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: lets say contstructive plus!|pg||
nt|georgia19: EW heading for a minus, but lead has helped.....|pg||

mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: Very sad result for E/W who were having a very nice set up till then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And Sveindal might be saying: "I didn't expect you to be that strong, hence my pass".  So technically, the blame goes to the partnership|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|grebrof: not really as 3@s were first time, but ok|pg||
nt|serhat: why not just 1s ? I dont understand the gain of those 4plus major bids.. |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The way I play, 1@S is used to deny spades|pg||
nt|serhat: when you have a chance to show 5 cards bid|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|georgia19: 50% diamond slam here|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|steshome: If West discards a club at any point, East is squeezed in the blacks|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|georgia19: I like to open 6 before 5, BUT sometimes, I let the suit quality decide - some suits can be treated as one shorter if they're awful.|pg||
