nt|lechcold: do we all like 1@S overcall?|pg||
nt|lechcold: hello|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd bid 4@S over the reopening double, but anything more (like working singleton) would make me cue-bid.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south vandering why north bid 4 @c but desided to pass 4 @s finally -so all well|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfb: Amoils: "sorry, maybe I should have bid 3@h with this"|pg||

nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chorush: not Dahl, IMO. He was bidding scientifically, trying to get to 7. After all from his perspective 7 was good opposite the heart ace and no 3rd rund diamond loser|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: was 2H right bid? how about spade spl|pg||

mb|4C|nt|lechcold: if played by East slam is reasonable|pg||
nt|mcphee: was wk NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes but in the back of your mind you know even if off AK of hearts opponents might sacrifice|pg||

nt|chorush: This looks to be going set 1 unless the defense does soething terrible|pg||

nt|runnerup:  if @d is a suit .but it nowadays isn't nessessary|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lechcold: 5@H would be probably down after Lightner double|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure if I care if wk or not |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No, it was 15-17 - he presumably upgraded for the 5 card suit|pg||
nt|mcphee: 5@H down with @C ruff right?|pg||
nt|sybarra: can pard pick the right minor?|pg||
nt|mcphee: he better:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: so 4@s overcall would definitely have made the hand more interesting!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe try ace of spade and look for signal?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: but that loses the entry for the second ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what if dahl ducks|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jbgood: another big swing - 1 imp for Amoils|pg||
