nt|lml: although neither table reached it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1-level opening suit presumed to be 14+ HCP  so 10+ hcp response sets up game force|pg||

nt|iceking: so not that good slam |pg||

nt|jbgood: yes, the operator will hear norwegian/swedish, and understand nothing:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = majors|pg||

nt|ahollan1: typically over strong 2@C  responder DBL = weak, but when possible 20-21 BAL makes sense to change that agreement|pg||

nt|iceking: with possible double fitt and very pure holding iam suprised N didnt gamble on game here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kareno: 6@s is good.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kareno: Certainly game is up to Vulnerable at IMP standard of 40 percent.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: its hard to pass up a vul game ... I agree|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@d from Tor may exclude the spade fit - but that is how they bid (and Geir came to the rescue with a careful 3@h - wonder if that was natural)'|pg||
nt|ahollan1: any guesses about 3@H??|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|bt: elaborate methods :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: the 'useful void' conundrum....|pg||
nt|jbgood: no alert - but guess it was "waiting"|pg||
mb|6S|nt|lml: but it seems to me to be a bit of a push on the south hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: waiting   that makes sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: so - opportunity lost. Can anyone suggest a sensible sequence to 6@h? |pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: k&r says west hand is 22.3|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  19  Zimmermann playing 5@SX|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kareno: I actually prefer 1@c with 5/5 blacks but that is an ongoing debate.  If n/s are playing forcing club then 1@s is mandated but otherwise ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Karen [also] read a lot of Acol books in misspent youth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are a few pairs who will still open 1@C with 5-5 blacks|pg||
nt|iceking: as it is 4@H looks rather cold so will save imps here |pg||
nt|kareno: 2@c - 1n not so often and I still prefer 1@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think michael rosenberg will in some circumstances and maybe chip martel??|pg||
nt|kareno: Someone asking me what do I do if partner responds 1nt to my 1@c|pg||
nt|bt: a heart lead looks normal knowing east has the pointed suits|pg||
pc|h3|nt|reisig: Pass ...a forcing Pass = firing squad|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zagorin asks about carding: "UD attitude, STD count"|pg||
nt|phil: is pass really forcing RR? |pg||
nt|reisig: For me ..YES ..for you ..who knows?|pg||
nt|phil: :P|pg||
nt|phil: I would file this under, "if the vugraph commentator doesnt think its forcing, its not".....|pg||
nt|phil: sounds so much better than the waiter or the janitor, dont you think? |pg||
nt|reisig: Some reverse the "Pass..and X" here|pg||
nt|phil: yes, their names tend to end in vowels however|pg||
nt|reisig: Meaning ...X = 6 might be OK ...and Pass = X or be killed :)|pg||
nt|phil: Kranyak has a pretty good sense of South's shape - I wonder why the tank|pg||
nt|reisig: He ordered a drink from the bar|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: not going to work out well to duck|pg||
nt|kareno: With worse clubs than south has I open 1@s.  For me it is always 'all things being equal'|pg||
nt|iceking: Peter didnt overcall 2@H in open room so never got into the bidding|pg||
nt|kareno: He thinks his partner is ruffing this.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on flip side   there is camp that says  if you don't open 5-card major  you don't have one!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ask steve robinson what he would open with  5008 :)|pg||
nt|kareno: That is the Steve Robinson school of bridge.  I'm not an adherent.|pg||
nt|lml: I think we have gone a little bit overboard on the 'love the majors front"|pg||
nt|kareno: Linda knows I'm a four-card major player :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it didn't apply here, but worth mentioning   even if you normally lead A from AK -- at 5+ level you should revert to King from AK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the arguments include:  King to get count    Ace often from Ace empty|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|kareno: In the CR, 1@d showed hearts and 2@h was a simple raise.|pg||

nt|kareno: Anyone be tempted to bid some sort of phony stayman with the south hand directly?|pg||
nt|bt: i dont know ...|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|kit: North might have tried 3@H -- he was probably influenced by his partner's failure to make a neg double, so unlikely 5-4 heart fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|phil: 3@h...3N?|pg||
nt|phil: ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|nt|reisig: I guessed right?|pg||

nt|xenya: frankly, i thought he would bid 4 straightaway|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the other room Helness had a double - game invite|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|chorush: my opion at imps is that if partner rejects the inv., you are not real likely to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: next set is at the top of the hours, 2 hours 15 min away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college all invites were accepted so we decided to make them SLAM tries :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  what really is wrong is 3 @s -all other bids ok|pg||
nt|chorush: bathurt will be rooting for 3-1 spades and no stiff q|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry, my bad -- he bid 4@S and I just noticed I typed 3 -- they are in 4@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok -looks normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: April Fools|pg||
nt|chorush: aha. So he was overbidding instead of underbidding:)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  to be in 4 @s|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|runnerup:  a long discussion about underbidding  and east actually bid 4 @s here|pg||

nt|reisig: Never for me!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|phil: but you are still exposed to a heart ruff - so better to gamble on another board|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|an|Game try|nt|kit: South wasn't close to action over 2@H -- North could be a lot worse with weaker heart suit.  The way to get to marginal game is for North to rebid 3@H|pg||
nt|kareno: How much worse could north be?|pg||
nt|jbgood: game try dbl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=5+   their opening scheme is 5443   [5@S 4@H/@D 3@C]|pg||
nt|kareno: Game try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: How much should South bid here?  Not clear.|pg||
nt|kareno: Mixed raise.  Fine with me.|pg||
nt|reisig: X = game try|pg||
nt|bt: very likely|pg||
mb|4S|nt|reisig: 2@c?  really?|pg||
nt|kit: I guess this is a mixed raise -- chosen to give opponents maximum room to describe their hands|pg||
nt|jbgood: Geir will cooperate|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: sometimes called Maximal DBL|pg||
pc|h6|nt|phil: I've heard of 4@d being a signoff in a major there, with 4M forward going|pg||
nt|reisig: Well deserved score :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Similar to maximal overcall double.  When you have no room for a try, double substitutes.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|phil: sometimes dogs that are walked...bite back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kit and i both need to find that sarcasm font/emoticon|pg||

mc|7|nt|runnerup:  the other table exactly same bidding and lead but small from table for +1|pg||

nt|ahollan1: can Bathurst PASS?|pg||
nt|kit: can and will|pg||
nt|kit: happily|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kareno: Better contract than 2@d :) (I recommend pass)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF  1N range is 15-17  -- would you open 1N or 1@C with south?|pg||
nt|kit: how bad can it be to contract for 7 tricks when your side has majority of trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D shows downside of 1@C-1@S transfer|pg||
nt|kareno: Almost always you want to play where you have more trumps than the opponents.|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- 4-4-1-4 shape in South hand is particularly bad for those methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: It is a shape that always plays worse than it looks like it will.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|reisig: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: what? |pg||

nt|ahollan1: @HQ only wins in 1 case|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: Pass and lead trumps I say|pg||
nt|kit: Pretty aggressive actions by South here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does Fantoni sit?|pg||
nt|kit: Bathurst may run first, although I don't think he should.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: does Bathurst?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Bathurst is deep in thought|pg||
nt|kareno: I would pass - it's not game and partner has expressed an opinion.  AND you have two trumps.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: Fantoni won't run after that huddle|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now is Fantoni's turn to worry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Karen's comment about showing preference may be key    note  4333 distribution does NOT have preference [imo]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 4234 ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 4324 do prefer @S over ... which??|pg||
nt|kareno: East is under pressure here|pg||

pc|h4|nt|phil: I have a feeling the Director will return with  32|pg||
nt|kareno: Trump lead is best.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st result posted on bridgewinners    Amoils over Cayne by 27|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: North can lead once, perhaps twice - trumps were really called for.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: low much better odds   absent a peek|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bt: like i said, 2 to 1 :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: declarer will now get a club ruff in dummy, but still will take only 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 clubs since South can get in and draw trumps|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jbgood: I know a few who would have a bid to show a (weakish) heart suit on the E hand|pg||

nt|runnerup:  4 @s here missed other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: most who play transfer responses to 1@C will respond with very weak hands  so no surprise that Multon doesn't stretch to bid 3@S|pg||
