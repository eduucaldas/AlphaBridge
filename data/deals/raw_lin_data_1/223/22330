mb|3D|nt|athene: if you play that style then 1@S 1N 2@c 2N 3@S is forcing, 6-4 with extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  a timid game here -beaten after @h lead (or switch-if diamonds taken first )|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: looks like they're headed that way|pg||

mb|p|mb|6D|nt|athene: AJ108xx is a lot better facing a doubleton than a singleton :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Ekeblad has left the table; now Madala goes while Bocchi is thinking|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: meckstroth himself alerted 1nt as clubs?|pg||
nt|chorush: there is a "rule" about not putting down an 8 card suit as dummy. There is also a rule about getting out of misfits asap|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I think the 8 card rule takes precedence|pg||

nt|athene: if it came to that|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: 1nt seems OK|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: i wonder why Madala didn't just raise @D  like earlier hand 1@D-2@D|pg||
nt|athene: if anyone is wondering about 1@S - it's quite common these days to play double as 4+ spades|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: or maybe specifically 4 or 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  1@D-(1@H)-?   DBL = 4/5@S|pg||
nt|athene: and use 1@S as a general takeout|pg||
nt|athene: minor-oriented|pg||
nt|athene: it is more use when the opening was a very loose 1@C (2+)|pg||

pc|dT|pc|c6|pc|dA|nt|athene: 3nt doesn't promise a balanced hand of course|pg||
nt|athene: just any hand that wants to play 3nt facing 8-10 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: so he might be hoping rodwell has a stiff club|pg||
nt|athene: but that is unlikely as he would have looked for a major fit|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  now back to those 3nt = hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: right, that's why they were disallowed|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphzfc: maybe it was something else|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's the NS  non-vul openings that i'm not sure about|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ex:  2@D = 4@S & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: whatever it was they did not have approved defenses for their opps|pg||
nt|athene: if anyone is wondering about "brown sticker" - basically a bid which is weak and does not have an "anchor suit" i.e. a suit you are known to hold, is deemed hard to defend against ...|pg||
nt|athene: and is often restricted or barred|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|athene: so if you open 2@H to say you have a weak hand with hearts that is ok because opps know a suit you have|pg||
