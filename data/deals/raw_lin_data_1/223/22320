nt|mmmakela: hmmm...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: can you construct N's hand which, from S's perspective, could be suitable for slam?|pg||
nt|xenya: considering the 1N opening?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|runnerup: i would say very strange bidding too .east doubled -with no vards to that -west with opening hans bid 1 @h ? and doubler bid 2 ? --3 @h was 3, bid i did 'nt understand-so |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|c8|pg||

nt|vugraphzae: After 23 comes 13|pg||
nt|clinch: Well 9 tricks on 13 after K@h lead|pg||
nt|jbennet: on a lucky day there might be an escape spot (1NT is surely not 1 of them)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|clinch: How?|pg||
nt|iceking: not often you dont even hold 9 in your hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 3 tricks in 1 NT x seems too much... E is squeezed on the 5th|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 5th @d|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|clinch: Hid a losing spade behind his trumps?|pg||
nt|iceking: nice hand w has here|pg||
nt|iceking: east has 15hcp pretty sure he didnt pass|pg||
nt|jbennet: time if they find the 4-3 major fit it might go only -3 off (= same as 3NT NS)|pg||
nt|iceking: north also needs to discard|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|clinch: My guess, looking at the board is that NS will have made 3NT on 13, gaining 900 since other room conceded 300|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||

nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S had 2 chances to show clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
