nt|Vugraphzfb: L seems to be thinking about playing a spade instead of cashing the @h 9, goes back and forth|pg||
nt|lechcold: now Bessis can make. Has to find @DQ and squeeze South|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: It's eash for us to see that the !q is onside, but not clear for him to play for that, is it?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in case you didn't know   Con Red was original  54 seed|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Bessis have count on either hand yet?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: an alert spec points out that S would have a 1NT opener with the @d Q and @c K in addition to what he's already played|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|sybarra: those second guessing points,   remember it was polish club by S |pg||
nt|sybarra: might be leading to wk nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: with Polish 1@C - most frequent hand type is weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with minimum opener and @C length  Precision 2@C opener available   you saw one earlier in the set|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  26|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like Bessis has played S for K of cl  we can see how play this  |pg||
