mb|p|nt|thenapster: 2cl showes 18-19 balanced in bocchi-madala sys|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i think 2@C was 18-19 balanced and 2@D was 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|athene: no notes for anything after that, unfortunately|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|athene: really impossible for east to find a club lead i think, in practice|pg||
nt|thenapster: 2h=3+hearts,3d strength,3sp cue,3nt unserious,4cl,4d cue,4sp cue,aces,3 aces|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: when you have A,K,Q against a slam you don't expect partner to have anything|pg||

nt|thenapster: any lead will beat the contract execpt this sp lead|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: yes any non-spade lead is good enough|pg||
nt|thenapster: so 980,a great results for Jacobs in the first board and 10 imps back|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he should have gone passive with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Much discussion in Italian . . . |pg||
nt|thenapster: i agree|pg||
nt|athene: but normally when opps bid slam you expect them to have enough tricks if left to their own devices|pg||
nt|athene: so you are supposed to attack|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|glen: interesting @S position, if S plays low on play from dummy, declarer will play @S 9, losing to T|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|davpro: everything behaves for declarer here. In a NT contract at least|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|athene: it is often better to take some risks to get into your 4-4 fit rather than defend 1nt|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|davpro: This is not a good 3NT. Well it is, but 3 kings behave aswell as the @ds.|pg||
nt|athene: because a 4-4 fit can only take 4 tricks in defence to 1nt|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: much better if you are playing in it|pg||
nt|athene: but of course it is very hard when the opponents are bidding your suits|pg||

pc|s9|pc|h7|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|mc|7|nt|thenapster: impossible i think|pg||

nt|sundiszno: 6 can be made on a non-@d lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Entries?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, not trivial for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you just concede the @D10 to establish communications in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: concede the @DQ sorry|pg||
nt|athene: but with only 5 diamond tricks you need another from somewhere|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Then need heart A onside|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||

nt|athene: maybe just try for stiff @DQ and then concede diamond|pg||

nt|athene: but now that those are gone, you can't expect much generosity from them at all|pg||
mb|3H|nt|thenapster: yes,but they are one of the pairs who like the be in zone and run all the set..can bring 60 imps in 1 match|pg||
mb|d|nt|sundiszno: we can congratulate to the winners, GAMAX team|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: they will represent Hungary at the EC|pg||
nt|bt: many would stayman here opp 15-17|pg||
nt|bt: and the club lie would make them very happy|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: no auction given from the other room, so we will never know how they managed to get to 4@H and not be doubled|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: many would go for 3@S with the south cards, but madala thinks, if i am going to contract for nine tricks, why not make it game?|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told west opened 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: north seems to have a fairly obvious double of that|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was worried his partner would bid 4@S too often|pg||
nt|thenapster: i think so too...clear double for me|pg||
nt|thenapster: so what?great shape and controls|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|MolvaM: 3@c is?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Don't know, puppet?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: is that lead systemic or devious?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: i'm guessing the latter|pg||
nt|thenapster: last hand he lead 10@d from j10|pg||
nt|thenapster: so...|pg||
nt|athene: madala would really like to tackle clubs from his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He can't ever get to hand?|pg||
nt|athene: in case west has @CKx or Qx, which is not at all unlikely|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead would have been way better for him|pg||
nt|athene: he might then have been able to make three clubs, two hearts, three spades and a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Falk isn't that nice :)|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps even if he didn't pick the spades he could score the @DJ|pg||

nt|glen: anybody have their eyes closed yet?|pg||

nt|thenapster: bocchi and madala will overcall ANY possible time when they have the @s suit|pg||
