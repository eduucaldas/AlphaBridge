mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|athene: do you double with north after 2@H 3@C 3@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you just bid 3@H??|pg||
nt|athene: or how about after 2@D multi, 3@C 3@H (p/c)?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: director called, as EW have not provided defense|pg||
nt|athene: i guess west might be a "6-4 fit = 4 level" guy|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'd guess X by meck|pg||
nt|athene: you really have to provide a defence to multi at this level of competition?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in ACBL events  pairs that play Multi 2@D are obligated to provide written defense to their opponents|pg||
nt|bigtrain: optionally he could try 4@C to show minors|pg||
nt|athene: i guess NS need some protection against these fiendish devices|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are 2 approved defenses on the ACBL Defense Database|pg||
nt|ritong: hello everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still opening this hand with 2@D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bigtrain: i stilll predict X by meck|pg||
mb|3H|an|pass or correct|nt|bigtrain: oh well  :)|pg||
nt|athene: right so we are back to the question of whether north is worth a double of this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: west likes both @hs and @ss, he says|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: not X|pg||
nt|ritong: so, looking for a 4/4 @s fit might prove dangerous|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT more likely|pg||
nt|athene: yes, although west might have only 3 spades|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ritong: also, north has not a rocket facing a simple overcall|pg||
nt|athene: now 4@H choice of games?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is too much but what do you do with that north hand?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose you can just pick a quiet 3@S or 4@D|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: neither acbl treatment talks about advancer's bidding after natural 3@C overcall|pg||
nt|athene: now rodwell might discover the diamond suit and bid 5@D? he still doesn't know what to do :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but both say Meck would not DBL at 1st turn|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: i have to say i prefer 4@H by north over the double of 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: offering 4@S or 5@D|pg||
nt|ritong: contract needs both minor kings with the weak 2 opener  i do not think meck feels confident about this|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he felt that the opponents were bidding like men with only a 9-card heart fit|pg||
nt|athene: and south having two hearts rather than one makes 5minor much less appealing|pg||

nt|bigtrain: X = exactly 4!|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: rodwell knows that these spades vs hearts battles have a habit of ending in 4@S, so he saves everyone a lot of time and trouble|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Zia bid 3@D in west  and Muzzio only 3@S north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 3@D was "mixed" raise|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer some higher bid than 2@D with west, to get the 4-card raise across immediately|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't look as though it would have made any difference here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S making = win 10|pg||
nt|bigtrain: alittle conservative?  north is a 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: a spectator points out that on a diamond lead declarer would have to play ace and a spade|pg||
nt|bigtrain: imo playing X as 4 or 5 pi=uts you at a cometitive disadvantage|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise would lose @SK and two aces and a ruff|pg||
nt|bigtrain: puts|pg||

nt|ahollan1: of course  in 3@S make 10 tricks   in 4@S make 9|pg||
nt|athene: finessing spades will be necessary if west has @SKxxx i guess|pg||
nt|athene: but "good raise" means different thing to different people|pg||
nt|bigtrain: all roads lead to -1 now|pg||

pc|sT|pc|hT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||

mb|d|mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|athene: some people say with min 6-4 you bid and rebid the 6-card suit so you might go 1@S 1N 2@S 2N 3@C now you can play lots more places at the 3-level|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: This is my first time doing VG, I will try to do my best! :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: right or wrong, i take pressure off partner and bid 4@S with north hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: if you play that style then 1@S 1N 2@c 2N 3@S is forcing, 6-4 with extras|pg||
pc|h5|nt|runnerup:  a timid game here -beaten after @h lead (or switch-if diamonds taken first )|pg||
