nt|henryb:  One of the nice things about commenting on French matches is that most of the pairs play pretty close to "French Standard" - very few exotic methods|pg||

nt|vugraphzas: hello Roberto and Rashed, welcome|pg||
nt|engsetter:  3Nt simple enough to reach if east opens|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would bid 3@h as South - when you are short in the opened suit it is really up to you to act with reasonable valyes|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzzq: 1nt on W, not a mistake :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzas: (He just alert it ;)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: 2)his @h stopper is thin|pg||
nt|ritong: but he goes for pragmatism|pg||
nt|ritong: now poizat on stage|pg||
nt|ritong: which @h to lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: he has chosen the Queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like an easy -2 for 300|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzzq: E alsmost bid 3nt,  but then bid only 2 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: on 3 the double is clear :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: of @c|pg||
nt|ritong: of clubs  very funny:)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @C looks like a standout to me|pg||
nt|ritong: so the question was: which @h to lead, if any?|pg||
nt|mamos:  good afternoon|pg||

nt|rnmalik: hi.|pg||
nt|henryb:  g'day Mike|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: 2@s here is 5 +, in the SEF system Poizat would show a stronger hand if he bid 3@D|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: welcome Barbara|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: I meant the contract.|pg||
nt|ybob: discard 1 @D on @H ... |pg||

nt|vugraphzas: I didnt see|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: maybe declarer played a small @d from hand|pg||
nt|april7: N should have discarded, and leave decision to E|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then? he ruffs small and exits in @D and waits|pg||
mb|p|nt|engsetter:  a simple 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: they don't play |pg||
nt|vugraphzas: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  would you make a negative X after P-P-1@h-1@s?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzas: I believe he did|pg||
nt|mamos:  North has a nice hand does outh have enough|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is close, but I would|pg||
nt|ybob: i pass|pg||
nt|ybob: better with 2@H|pg||
nt|ybob: or 9 cards minors|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ybob: 9 tricks on @S here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb:  or another Q somewhere, even better|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|baldjean: 20 hcp either way; this will end in a part score.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: East will They bid faster than I can commentate.|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: Piganeau's team is the holder of the senior bowl, the world senior championship|pg||
nt|engsetter:  not so simple now|pg||
nt|engsetter:  I had not anticpated the one spade overcall opposite passed p|pg||
nt|engsetter:  my reason is that against enemy contract I would not want to commit my side to a spade lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|rnmalik:  minus top control in minor suits would require some work. 8 tricks there.|pg||
nt|engsetter:  when a minor lead could be easily best|pg||
nt|baldfriede: good morning all|pg||
nt|rnmalik: welcome.|pg||
nt|april7: EW might go to slam in @S or @D , but both not makable|pg||
nt|ritong: lasserre has not a fantastic hand for @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 3NT would convey that message|pg||
nt|hedyg: the misfit should discourage them|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  2@c French is a good but not gf hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: then , poizat is not out of gas|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzas: senior is 60+ years old in bridge|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a @s loser, ok, but rest might be good|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hard for N to tell, but he would have done better doubling 2@s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|baldjean: I thought W might have invited.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: but with 2 aces in E's hand, W will go to 6@D|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|baldjean: declarer would like to know where J@d is|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: if it is in north it cant be 4th|pg||
nt|mamos:  this will work out well enough|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzzq: EW can make 3nt here if they find the @c |pg||
pc|h7|nt|april7: now 4NT to play or BW|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@H 2@s by E would have been forcing so 3 @s really showed his hand|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ybob: lost 1@H and 2@C or 1@C and 2 h@S|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@H|pg||
pc|sT|nt|baldjean: E would have declined though.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|april7: pass is now best, but human is to go on|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h a sort of last train, meaning " you really don t like your hand?"|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C & 2@H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: last chance|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: Besides the J@D @H hook required for 9 tricks.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: lasserre says " no, i really don t like it", but poizat really has a monster|pg||
nt|hedyg: no leaddirecting double by N|pg||
nt|hedyg: he doesnt think he would like opps to play in 5NT instead of in 5@s|pg||
nt|april7: @H ace ,then  @D ruff, and down you go unfortunately|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: hirschwald is thinking a lot...|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: for the lead|pg||
nt|april7: S might even start with @D and then E goes 2 down|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: huge swing possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: wondering why his pd didnt double|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: when other room managed to stay in 3NT|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ritong: the @c2 will seal it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|baldjean: N can be endplayed for making|pg||
nt|april7: 6 he would but not 5|pg||
nt|april7: 10 of @D asks for @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: the very light major 2suiter overcall in the OR kept EW from bidding too high there|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@D promises the 9|pg||
nt|ritong: was not good news for east, right|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ritong: no JT stiff on|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mamos:  there seemed lots of ways of arriving at his contract|pg||
nt|ritong: hi again there|pg||
nt|ybob: hi|pg||
nt|henryb:  is 420 really as good as 800? should S have doubled 2@s? what should a X of 2@s mean?|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 3/4 italian controls|pg||
nt|ritong: A=2, K=1|pg||
mc|10|nt|rnmalik: I thought that S at these colours may come in with 2NT but had no plausible defence to @S contract, so a pass.|pg||
nt|april7: but the lead might also convey suit preference|pg||
pg||

nt|ritong: we call it "semi forcing"|pg||
nt|ritong: as opposed to 2@d full game forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: can be 22/23 balanced or any strong 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  So its not well defined|pg||
mb|1N|nt|baldjean: Slam time.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|ritong: for people who have worked on it, also covers some exotic handtypes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: like 6@h/4@s, or the reverse|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ybob: lost 6@C|pg||
nt|ritong: identical auction next room, so a push|pg||
nt|engsetter:  east should downgrade hand with doubleton QJ|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|henryb:  2@h is @h and a minor?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would say so|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: @c slam would be right-sided now.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The DBL would prevent EW from bidding higher then required.|pg||
nt|ritong: not like them to distort a nat w2|pg||
nt|henryb:  and 2@s is nf |pg||
nt|mamos:  DDid South expect this to be passed?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think that is unplayable|pg||
nt|lokaty: witam|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand. W may opt for 3NT here. |pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|engsetter:  yes indeed without the double- normal  a bad no trump contract loomed|pg||
mb|d|nt|frankaus: this will not challenge declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|baldjean: Which will make without a problem.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is an overbid|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|ritong: hirschwald does not know how @cs are made|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: the Piganeau team has been very successful internationally|pg||
nt|april7: this will go down, but 4@S might also have gone down on @H KA lead and then @C , 2 down|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|baldjean: With this lead an ot even.|pg||

nt|lokaty: Marek jest pe³en nowoczesnych ustaleñ i by³ pewny, ¿e 4 d to piki|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|ritong: problem is, 1@d followed with 1NT is like 5/7|pg||
nt|bigtrain: its easy to let being vulnerable effect your bidding decision but many IMPs are lost by overbidding in the situation|pg||
nt|ritong: when 1@c 1NT is like 8/10|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: so, his other choice was immediate 1@c 1NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: which would look like a serioàus underbid, wouldn t it?|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|bigtrain: why isn't 1@D-f-1NT in the ballpark?|pg||

nt|baldfriede: Trump in hand will get him some overtricks now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: pitch @C from hand and ruff with the Q and small @C exit.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Only bother is the missing trumps in same hand.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|engsetter:  how many bridge players will use all their mental resource to worry about an overtrick that may not even matter?  Is it worth the effort? what do you think?|pg||

nt|april7: 2@S by S here, losing 2 @H and a few @S|pg||
nt|mamos:  the trouble with bids like three Diamonds is that p   will almost inevitably go 4@d|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: small @s from hand would make sense here|pg||
nt|ritong: thinking " if the A is on, i can lead towards K later on"|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes if nothing happens you can play a @s towards the king later|pg||
nt|ybob: 3 rounds @D defeat|pg||
nt|ritong: really?|pg||

nt|rnmalik: That is tough:)|pg||

pc|sA|nt|ritong: here east went to 4@d because of the 6/4 shape and good hand in general|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ritong: he must have some cards to justify the overcall, right?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: these guys are not suckers, you know  when they do something, there is an other reason than " but pard, we were not vulnerable"|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h must surely be just competitive?|pg||
nt|ybob: yes and why S bid the game |pg||
nt|henryb:  Poizat is trying to resurrect the @hK by pretending he does not have it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: if EW cashes the @H tricks, S doesn't need the @D finesse|pg||
pc|s9|nt|engsetter:  yes but north is allowed to give his p chance to play a part in the decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, that too|pg||
nt|henryb:  Maybe declarer will play Laserre for stiff K|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|d6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|ybob: because W bid 3@D with 2 cards so hard with the K@H ...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|engsetter:  needs to be  is it 38%  to be worth bidding what is the percentage?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|april7: now S has to cash @H first if he doesn't make the @D finesse|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||

nt|frankaus: we also need to add some for defensive errors|pg||
nt|engsetter:  can anyone remind me the exact % probability for bidding a Vul game?|pg||
nt|ritong: @s Ax is good news|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT will roll home comfortably|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|henryb:  2N or 2@c then 2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@H for EW.|pg||
nt|ybob: cold 4@S here|pg||
nt|ritong: this looks like a pure 3@h|pg||
nt|ritong: or equivalent|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c would be 22/263|pg||
nt|ritong: 22/23*|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|baldjean: Yes, looks like a logical ontract. But 5@c if right-sided are a good sac.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Rex by N would have made it comfortable.|pg||
nt|april7: 5@C looks quite good but goes down if W doesn't play ace of @C on first lead from S|pg||
nt|hedyg:  The winning team will represent France at the European Championships in Ireland next June |pg||
nt|henryb:  263 would be a LOT of high card points|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and poizat had no other choice than bid a losing contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: contract*|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: what is Rex?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Re double.|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|ybob: no way 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT won't work, because dummy is dead|pg||
nt|ritong: i would give up with marlier's hand  stinks|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if an opponent has a @c stack, might hurt to go further|pg||
nt|april7: not easy for N to pass|pg||
pc|sA|nt|engsetter:  this cant be right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S would play well, losing 2@S and a @C.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|baldfriede: The @s are absolutely useless here.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: surprising that W passed 3NT.|pg||
