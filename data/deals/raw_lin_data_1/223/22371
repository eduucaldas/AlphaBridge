nt|Vugraphzfd: I'm betting 2 minutes min. before next bid|pg||
nt|georgej: He has told his story|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: but he doesn't rush the endings|pg||
nt|georgej: one extra Q is all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: change QJ of clubs to the king, then you can make one more try maybe, but you expect a trump lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: decent if clubs were breaking|pg||
nt|georgej: All finesses win and still awful|pg||

nt|georgej: I am looking at all hands and Gib and cannot make it. Probably why I am out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond hook, spade hook, and at some point club towards dummy does it|pg||
nt|georgej: What about N pitching a @S on the @C?|pg||

nt|georgej: Those red numbers mean -1?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: can he force a diamond return from N for 3 D?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||

nt|fabsayc: how does he get off dummy|pg||
nt|georgej: not my problem|pg||

mb|p|nt|thenapster: i dont like the 4h with 3 aces|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he did bid 4@c - what do you want him to do now?|pg||
nt|thenapster: 4sp|pg||
nt|thenapster: 4cl its almost automatic |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: W is devoid of source of tricks after 3 Aces|pg||
nt|thenapster: its just denies 5422 with 11-12|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: everything behaves for declarer here. In a NT contract at least|pg||

nt|dburn: well, if you would open that hand and then bid 4@c - you'll be a man, my son :)|pg||
nt|thenapster: :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: declarer might have to guess hearts (finesse 9) to scramble home here|pg||
nt|thenapster: for me west MUST bid 4sp|pg||

nt|dburn: but sooner or later in 2/1 auctions, someone's got to say whether they have a mimimum|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: no, he is ok anyway|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: maybe West's 4@c was "serious", maybe not - but this slam is nowhere near as good as you think it is|pg||
nt|thenapster: so if you dont plan to bid over 4h try to bid other way|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|athene: it is often better to take some risks to get into your 4-4 fit rather than defend 1nt|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|davpro: This is not a good 3NT. Well it is, but 3 kings behave aswell as the @ds.|pg||
nt|athene: because a 4-4 fit can only take 4 tricks in defence to 1nt|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: much better if you are playing in it|pg||
nt|athene: but of course it is very hard when the opponents are bidding your suits|pg||
pc|c4|nt|davpro: Nothing wrong in stopping low. Imh (and uncontested)o|pg||

nt|dburn: at any rate, they stayed out of a so-so slam that might or might not make - probably tough to make on this lie|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|bt: and it is tempting to bid on north hand, but flat distribution and potential defensive tricks so |pg||

nt|sundiszno: 6 can be made on a non-@d lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Entries?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, not trivial for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you just concede the @D10 to establish communications in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: concede the @DQ sorry|pg||
nt|athene: but with only 5 diamond tricks you need another from somewhere|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Then need heart A onside|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe just try for stiff @DQ and then concede diamond|pg||
nt|athene: but now if madala, say, won the @DQ and returned a diamond, declarer might feel he has to run them, and that is going to squeeze his hand |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Club 10, 9, 8 makes it . . .|pg||
nt|koksoy: club  position  is  good  for  declearer.. so  defence will  have difficulty to  find  their 5th trick..|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Entries?  D spots?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: some specs bet that he will go down |pg||

mb|p|nt|koksoy: with 7411  its  normal  to  bid  5@C  for me ...  if   one  contract is  makeable you  may  win..|pg||

nt|athene: on a diamond lead, will bocchi take the queen and then finesse the ten? he needs all the dummy entries he can get|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay: easy 9 tricks with @H hook|pg||
mb|p|nt|thenapster: i think he will for sure,does it enough?kx sp onside and jh as well,might work somehow|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: lots of options in the play; for example if you had to bring in clubs with limited dummy entries, you might start by leading them from hand|pg||
nt|athene: that gains if east has @CKx or CQx, if you read the position|pg||
nt|athene: @CKx or @CQx|pg||

nt|bt: i agree but what can you do, wait for partner to T/O double when you have all those high cards?|pg||
nt|davpro: Whatever you do. in all situations; do the right thing :) Bridge becomes easy then :)|pg||
nt|bt: i think a jury would be equally split between D and 5@H|pg||

mb|d|mb|4S|nt|athene: no auction given from the other room, so we will never know how they managed to get to 4@H and not be doubled|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: He can't ever get to hand?|pg||
nt|athene: in case west has @CKx or Qx, which is not at all unlikely|pg||

nt|athene: very hard to say, knowing all the cards|pg||
nt|athene: he led a club to the queen with the idea that if it lost, the jack would be a dummy entry for a trump play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 4H was unmakeable last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|koksoy: ty  Murat...  and  specs who  watch  us...|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|thenapster: dbl by east|pg||
mb|p|nt|koksoy: not  easy  to  make  4@S...  diamond lead will force declearer|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wow 5@d at unfav vul|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: looks like 500|pg||
nt|thenapster: forgot the dbl|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfg: Bd 15 4C-1, will fix later|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: bocchi a little unlucky to find partner with three small hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|thenapster: wow,sadek made a tricky play in other room and made 4h|pg||
nt|athene: yeah, played other way up after leaping michaels, and he tried a small trump off dummy|pg||
nt|thenapster: indeed|pg||
nt|thenapster: 5cl going down other room|pg||
nt|thenapster: 5 or 7 imps back to Falk|pg||
nt|thenapster: but a big set for Jacobs..+35 imps|pg||
nt|thenapster: 5 back...55-17 this set|pg||
nt|thenapster: great segment by both of jacobs sides..all 4 players|pg||
nt|thenapster: so thank you all|pg||
nt|thenapster: we start soon again|pg||
nt|thenapster: next match start in few minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kvzacc: 2s and 3h are also made, not a good sign for dumbo|pg||
nt|koksoy: yes...  partner  has passed  hand..   sacrifice can not be  succesful  on  red vercus white..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs predict 800 if def leads trumps but with @hK onside I thk 500 is the limit|pg||
nt|koksoy: but  their teammates made 4@S  so  they  will  only loose  2 imps ý  guess|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|MolvaM: operator, when do we start the 3rd segment pls?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 7PM|pg||
nt|thenapster: will he duck?|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause really east wondering what to do here?|pg||
nt|athene: i am thinking maybe west should have played the @D6 as a clearer count signal|pg||
nt|athene: is east thinking that declarer must have another diamond|pg||
nt|athene: because west would "surely" play the 6 from Q643?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: E doesn't know about the A of H is worried|pg||
nt|athene: and if so, maybe ducking the first diamond will make declarer's life a little harder|pg||
nt|athene: the motto is, if you are giving a count signal, make it as clear as you can|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|athene: you could just claim 2 off undoubled :) same score|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that must be 2 hrs from now I guess?|pg||
nt|koksoy: ok  :)  then  whats  the  time over there  now ??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 7PM Eastern Daylight 2 hours from now :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|athene: but madala might resent the implication he can take only 8 tricks on this hand|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|thenapster: lol|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c2|pc|h9|pg||
