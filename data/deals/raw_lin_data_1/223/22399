nt|vugraphzas: I didnt see|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: maybe declarer played a small @d from hand|pg||
nt|april7: N should have discarded, and leave decision to E|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then? he ruffs small and exits in @D and waits|pg||
mb|1C|nt|engsetter:  a simple 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: they don't play |pg||
nt|vugraphzas: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  would you make a negative X after P-P-1@h-1@s?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzas: I believe he did|pg||
nt|mamos:  North has a nice hand does outh have enough|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is close, but I would|pg||
nt|ybob: i pass|pg||
nt|ybob: better with 2@H|pg||
nt|ybob: or 9 cards minors|pg||
mb|d|nt|ybob: 9 tricks on @S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  or another Q somewhere, even better|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|baldjean: 20 hcp either way; this will end in a part score.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: East will They bid faster than I can commentate.|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: Piganeau's team is the holder of the senior bowl, the world senior championship|pg||
nt|engsetter:  not so simple now|pg||
nt|engsetter:  I had not anticpated the one spade overcall opposite passed p|pg||
nt|engsetter:  my reason is that against enemy contract I would not want to commit my side to a spade lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|rnmalik:  minus top control in minor suits would require some work. 8 tricks there.|pg||
nt|engsetter:  when a minor lead could be easily best|pg||
nt|baldfriede: good morning all|pg||
nt|rnmalik: welcome.|pg||
nt|april7: EW might go to slam in @S or @D , but both not makable|pg||
nt|ritong: lasserre has not a fantastic hand for @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 3NT would convey that message|pg||
nt|hedyg: the misfit should discourage them|pg||
mb|4H|nt|henryb:  2@c French is a good but not gf hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: then , poizat is not out of gas|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzas: senior is 60+ years old in bridge|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a @s loser, ok, but rest might be good|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hard for N to tell, but he would have done better doubling 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: I thought W might have invited.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|april7: but with 2 aces in E's hand, W will go to 6@D|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|baldjean: declarer would like to know where J@d is|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: if it is in north it cant be 4th|pg||
nt|mamos:  this will work out well enough|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: EW can make 3nt here if they find the @c |pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: now 4NT to play or BW|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@H 2@s by E would have been forcing so 3 @s really showed his hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ybob: lost 1@H and 2@C or 1@C and 2 h@S|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|baldjean: E would have declined though.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|april7: pass is now best, but human is to go on|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h a sort of last train, meaning " you really don t like your hand?"|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C & 2@H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|april7: last chance|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Besides the J@D @H hook required for 9 tricks.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|ritong: lasserre says " no, i really don t like it", but poizat really has a monster|pg||
nt|hedyg: no leaddirecting double by N|pg||
nt|hedyg: he doesnt think he would like opps to play in 5NT instead of in 5@s|pg||
nt|april7: @H ace ,then  @D ruff, and down you go unfortunately|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: hirschwald is thinking a lot...|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: for the lead|pg||
nt|april7: S might even start with @D and then E goes 2 down|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: huge swing possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: wondering why his pd didnt double|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: when other room managed to stay in 3NT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: the @c2 will seal it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|baldjean: N can be endplayed for making|pg||
nt|april7: 6 he would but not 5|pg||
nt|april7: 10 of @D asks for @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: the very light major 2suiter overcall in the OR kept EW from bidding too high there|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@D promises the 9|pg||
nt|ritong: was not good news for east, right|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ritong: no JT stiff on|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|mamos:  there seemed lots of ways of arriving at his contract|pg||
nt|ritong: hi again there|pg||
nt|ybob: hi|pg||
nt|henryb:  is 420 really as good as 800? should S have doubled 2@s? what should a X of 2@s mean?|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 3/4 italian controls|pg||
nt|ritong: A=2, K=1|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: I thought that S at these colours may come in with 2NT but had no plausible defence to @S contract, so a pass.|pg||
nt|april7: but the lead might also convey suit preference|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|baldjean: And claim.|pg||

nt|ritong: we call it "semi forcing"|pg||
nt|ritong: as opposed to 2@d full game forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: can be 22/23 balanced or any strong 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  So its not well defined|pg||
mb|1H|nt|baldjean: Slam time.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ritong: for people who have worked on it, also covers some exotic handtypes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: like 6@h/4@s, or the reverse|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ybob: lost 6@C|pg||
nt|ritong: identical auction next room, so a push|pg||
nt|engsetter:  east should downgrade hand with doubleton QJ|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|henryb:  2@h is @h and a minor?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would say so|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: @c slam would be right-sided now.|pg||

nt|mamos:  DDid South expect this to be passed?|pg||

nt|bigtrain: unless your partner is al roth|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|ritong: problem is, 1@d followed with 1NT is like 5/7|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|engsetter:  now king spades = ZERO|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: lost 1 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: this will roll home comfortably|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S by S here, losing 2 @H and a few @S|pg||
nt|mamos:  the trouble with bids like three Diamonds is that p   will almost inevitably go 4@d|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: small @s from hand would make sense here|pg||
nt|ritong: thinking " if the A is on, i can lead towards K later on"|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes if nothing happens you can play a @s towards the king later|pg||
nt|ybob: 3 rounds @D defeat|pg||
nt|ritong: really?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have good defense and not so good offense opposite a non-invitational partner|pg||
pc|d9|nt|engsetter:  oh dear|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: NT final contract or may be 2@S.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That is tough:)|pg||
nt|frankaus: red games attract the over bid|pg||
nt|april7: S should play for doubleton ace of @S so losing only 3 @S instead of 4 by playing to the K|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: sry Henri, you are too quick :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: and see what happens...bingo!|pg||
nt|ritong: now, he just has to find @d K with the overcaller|pg||
nt|ritong: which is likely, when west did not lead a top @h, a priori denying AK in this suit|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: here east went to 4@d because of the 6/4 shape and good hand in general|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: he must have some cards to justify the overcall, right?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: these guys are not suckers, you know  when they do something, there is an other reason than " but pard, we were not vulnerable"|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h must surely be just competitive?|pg||
nt|ybob: yes and why S bid the game |pg||
nt|henryb:  Poizat is trying to resurrect the @hK by pretending he does not have it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|april7: if EW cashes the @H tricks, S doesn't need the @D finesse|pg||
pc|d3|nt|engsetter:  yes but north is allowed to give his p chance to play a part in the decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, that too|pg||
nt|henryb:  Maybe declarer will play Laserre for stiff K|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|ybob: because W bid 3@D with 2 cards so hard with the K@H ...|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|henryb:  2N or 2@c then 2N|pg||

nt|ybob: cold 4@S here|pg||
nt|ritong: this looks like a pure 3@h|pg||

nt|ritong: 2@c would be 22/263|pg||
nt|ritong: 22/23*|pg||
mb|r|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|baldjean: Yes, looks like a logical ontract. But 5@c if right-sided are a good sac.|pg||

nt|april7: 5@C looks quite good but goes down if W doesn't play ace of @C on first lead from S|pg||
nt|hedyg:  The winning team will represent France at the European Championships in Ireland next June |pg||
nt|henryb:  263 would be a LOT of high card points|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and poizat had no other choice than bid a losing contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: contract*|pg||

nt|april7: not easy for N to pass|pg||
pc|s4|nt|engsetter:  this cant be right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S would play well, losing 2@S and a @C.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|baldfriede: The @s are absolutely useless here.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: surprising that W passed 3NT.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
pc|d2|nt|baldjean: If @H are never mentioned they can't be found.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|engsetter:  surprising is a very mild word|pg||
nt|april7: N takes a chance and W has to stay low on 10 of @C played by S|pg||
nt|hedyg: S overbid his hand :)|pg||
nt|april7: after S ruffs a high @H in hand|pg||
