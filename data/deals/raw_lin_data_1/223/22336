mb|p|nt|athene: some people say with min 6-4 you bid and rebid the 6-card suit so you might go 1@S 1N 2@S 2N 3@C now you can play lots more places at the 3-level|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: This is my first time doing VG, I will try to do my best! :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: right or wrong, i take pressure off partner and bid 4@S with north hand|pg||
nt|chorush: This is a fair diamond slam not easy to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you play that style then 1@S 1N 2@c 2N 3@S is forcing, 6-4 with extras|pg||
mb|3C|nt|runnerup:  a timid game here -beaten after @h lead (or switch-if diamonds taken first )|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: rodwell now has to choose between the 6-1 and 4-3 fits|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: looks like they're headed that way|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: don't know after 2@H :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|chorush: club lead would force declarer to play for trumps 2-2 or hearts 3-3 or the heart J dropping|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: wonder if meckstroth thinks 3@S will always be a doubleton?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: AJ108xx is a lot better facing a doubleton than a singleton :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S=relay  2N=min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C relay  3@H  4@S 6@H short @C|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: two finesses, good chance to bring it in for 1 loser...facing a stiff, very slim chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Meck: Oh thanks!|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if north gave any thought to a double? sort of "on the bidding"|pg||

mb|6H|nt|glen: *6@H|pg||
nt|ritong: as far as duboin knows, the par might be 7@s doubled|pg||
nt|glen: W knows that a red vs. white 6@H is very shapely|pg||
nt|ritong: so he goes as slowly as possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: snickering by both when the pass comes back after 6@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|7H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: and he is almost constrained to bid one more|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ritong: and if it does not, the final loss will be minimized, compared to the huge number if 7@h or 6@s happens to make|pg||
nt|glen: 7@H = simply red's "If You Don't Know Me By Now"|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, if opponents do not hold the key @h A, they will oàften accept the blackmail and bid 7@s|pg||

nt|chorush: If West goes adventuring, they will need sound methods tostop at 4NT|pg||

nt|ritong: think 1NT is closer to this hand|pg||
nt|ritong: fill in @s J and decision would be superclose|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: out of those 2 statements  i got ZERO right :(|pg||
nt|kit: I would have been inclined to pass and pass a re-opening double.  Certainly figures to defeat 1@S, maybe a lot, and might not have a game|pg||
nt|ritong: makes sense|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we think Versace immediate 1N would have been transfer to @C|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt doesn't promise a balanced hand of course|pg||
nt|athene: just any hand that wants to play 3nt facing 8-10 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: so he might be hoping rodwell has a stiff club|pg||

nt|ahollan1: keep in mind   BBO scores are UNOFFICIAL|pg||
mb|6S|nt|kit: and here we go -- either north or south might well save|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: north knows east has the @h A|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Consus Red  original  54 seed   beats   6 Lynch by  86 !!!|pg||
