nt|sybarra: did we hear a sigh of relief?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: nice defense so he couldn't just knock out the @h A for the 9th trick|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and how many spades will N bid?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: can theyy bid7 here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: for me I will bid 4 |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I know,  vul,  etc,  but 8 card suit |pg||
nt|runnerup:  7 @d very good |pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chorush: not Dahl, IMO. He was bidding scientifically, trying to get to 7. After all from his perspective 7 was good opposite the heart ace and no 3rd rund diamond loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: you bob?   3 or 4? |pg||
nt|3for3:  looks like 4@S ns|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: was 2H right bid? how about spade spl|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S normal -- result there is not clear|pg||
nt|3for3:  sontag will offer 3nt, i'd think|pg||
nt|kit: If defense is sharp, can set up both club trick and heart trick in time|pg||
nt|3for3:  one potential loser in each suit, if defense gets them all|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|reisig: 1NT might drive them to slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought you might |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 4 might get E to bid 5@h which I think makes, so this auction was more successful :)|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT also runs a trick short with accurate defense|pg||
nt|3for3:  berk has conflicting values|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lechcold: if played by East slam is reasonable|pg||
nt|mcphee: was wk NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes but in the back of your mind you know even if off AK of hearts opponents might sacrifice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Dahl asks about the J - "one higher" then "1 higher of any description?" "yes"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Ventin has put the screen down to ask something - I think about how good 2NT is|pg||
nt|chorush: This looks to be going set 1 unless the defense does soething terrible|pg||
nt|chorush: Since NS -500 in the other room, Falk figures to lose 12|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if @d is a suit .but it nowadays isn't nessessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: 5@H would be probably down after Lightner double|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure if I care if wk or not |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No, it was 15-17 - he presumably upgraded for the 5 card suit|pg||
nt|mcphee: 5@H down with @C ruff right?|pg||
nt|sybarra: can pard pick the right minor?|pg||
nt|mcphee: he better:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: so 4@s overcall would definitely have made the hand more interesting!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe try ace of spade and look for signal?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: but that loses the entry for the second ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what if dahl ducks|pg||
nt|3for3:  terrible spades suggest nt, but 4522 looks like a suit hand|pg||
nt|kit: But seems clear for North to choose to play the 4-4 fit with 2 doubletons|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jbgood: another big swing - 1 imp for Amoils|pg||
nt|kit: Logical play is queen of hearts to king and ace.  Then AK of spades, and diamond finesse.  Another heart, and West must shift to king of clubs rather than try to cash third heart.|pg||
nt|3for3:  strange choice of spots|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: true that doesnt work |pg||
nt|mmmakela: now seems like 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I think 4@h is RKC|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: as a spec said,  signal=you cant beat it any more|pg||
nt|mcphee: i guess they had to lead to trump to get this 2 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: diamond then another now?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now for sure|pg||
nt|3for3:  any idea why he'd lead the 8?|pg||
nt|kit: 3rd and 5th it is consistent with|pg||
nt|3for3:  but 1098 looks like a sequence to me|pg||
nt|kit: Duck of heart interesting -- idea is to persuade defense he has 3 hearts|pg||

mb|2D|nt|reisig: Why 3@h...not 4@h?|pg||
nt|sybarra: pushing the limit here |pg||
nt|kit: East probably expecting opponents to bid 2@S -- then he can try 3@C.  Odds are he will strike some fit.|pg||

mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: but west pass of 3@C is criminal to me, friedland has never limited his hand|pg||

nt|jbgood: difference is that now S is declarer - and he cannot go more than 1 down:|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: why? underleading @HAK and...:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: low heart to get his first di ruff|pg||

nt|3for3:  dont, or, your methods, would work for that|pg||
nt|kit: If it comes to declaring 1NT or 2@C, surely North hand should prefer 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: In standard, NS can stay low enough here and in an OK spot.   In other suitations, north's hand is often better suited to a big @C system.|pg||

pc|sT|nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|3for3:  good lead|pg||
nt|kit: Normal lead IMO.  Much better than heart lead.|pg||

nt|sybarra: as opposed to kqxx of club?  leading k or q?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||

mb|1H!|an|4+!h, F1|nt|penseur9: much too strog for a multi|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Wrang wrote out a description of the strong hands that are possible, strong 1-suiter or 19 balanced or 25-27 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  an unlucky @s lead is natural,but still a lot of work to do |pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure that the @S is unlucky at all|pg||
nt|3for3:  1@H, i'd think|pg||
mb|2D!|an|5-7, 3-card !h |nt|3for3:  do you have a gadget for that hand in a club system>|pg||
nt|3for3:  ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: only if hand much stronger.  With this hand, just rebid 1@H -- generally works out okay.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the disadvantage of all these strong variations is responder cant bid tactically|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: NS might make 5@C the hard way|pg||
nt|kit: I think 2@D shows 3-card heart support and a hand somewhat better than he has.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: and 3nt is better, or even 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Joe Grue was operating heavy machinery in the other room over Cheek's Precision 1@D|pg||
nt|3for3:  the alert said 3@H, 5-7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|penseur9: but will loose 2 IMPs in the process|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lechcold: defence in OR was not perfect|pg||
nt|jbgood: again a surprising result from the OR: 2 NT making seems VERY good |pg||
nt|lechcold: 6 or even 8 imps to Amoils I predict|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok lets say normal but gives 2 @s tricks to declarer --meanwhile 2 @s is makeable ew |pg||
pc|d2|nt|lechcold: I think spade lead was against any rules:(|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|3for3:  maybe he upgraded for his good hearts :)|pg||
nt|kit: as I said, a hand somewhat better than he has|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|runnerup:  why?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: 2 to score   Gordon leads Bertheau by a mere 3 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder if that helps or hurts Jan in making decision for tonight|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|c4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jacobs 55-12 set with one to score   now leads falk by 18|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfb: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: other scores and a nice dinner will help :) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: session scores eventually posted at  http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|lechcold: Lewaciak had to duck a spade|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c7|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfb: L seems to be thinking about playing a spade instead of cashing the @h 9, goes back and forth|pg||
nt|lechcold: now Bessis can make. Has to find @DQ and squeeze South|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: It's eash for us to see that the !q is onside, but not clear for him to play for that, is it?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lechcold: spade is best now for defence|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|c2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond 177  O'Rourke with 76 withdraws after 3 sets|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|c5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores filtering in at  http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: in case you didn't know   Con Red was original  54 seed|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Bessis have count on either hand yet?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: an alert spec points out that S would have a 1NT opener with the @d Q and @c K in addition to what he's already played|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h8|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: those second guessing points,   remember it was polish club by S |pg||
nt|sybarra: might be leading to wk nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: with Polish 1@C - most frequent hand type is weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with minimum opener and @C length  Precision 2@C opener available   you saw one earlier in the set|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  26|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like Bessis has played S for K of cl  we can see how play this  |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h7|mc|8|nt|3for3:  on time|pg||
nt|3for3:  last board at this table|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: it has arrived, last board for this segment, then back in a short while|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont see this as a 19 imp board|pg||
nt|penseur9: Thanks to our fantastic operator, Jan Martel, for a job well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who can't access bridgewinners   Diamond over O'Rourke by 84   oh my|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this looks to be overboard bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=INV+|pg||
nt|3for3:  3nt to finish things off|pg||
nt|3for3:  6@D is not without play.....|pg||
nt|3for3:  but i'd rather not be there|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT might not make.  Will have guess on spade shift|pg||
nt|kit: when East gets in with queen of diamonds|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!d + M GF|nt|penseur9: great commenting from my partner Martin Johnson...|pg||

nt|sybarra: and thx Lech,  and Al from the other room |pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart  1 hour 50 minutes|pg||
nt|lechcold: thx all|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lechcold: bye|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: We'll return in about 15 minutes, I'd guess - probably the same two matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: We'll be back tomorrow at noon Memphis time, with two matches from the Quarterfinals (but note that the two matches will play different boards for security reasons). If you want to ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: vote on which matche we cover, go to bridgewinners.com where there will be a poll as soon as we know what the matches are going to be|pg||
nt|lechcold: this should be down |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this is a great result for Falk, the orginal 47th seed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|penseur9: we'll finish with a flourish :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: 10 of clubs play will be very costly |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|runnerup:  2 about opening hands meets -so isn't -2 unfear -but you must bid it -the other table surely will also|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyu thoughts on how you stay out of th is no play game?  Downgrade east hand to mere invite?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lechcold: Lewaciak's hope is that Bessis will solve trumps problem:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: and he did:)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: peek|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lechcold: declarer has to guess hearts correctly to be down one only|pg||
nt|kit: Now he will continue clubs, and not be in for spade shift|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|penseur9: I suppose it's ok to congratulate the Falk team... well done|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|3for3:  maybe he should have abandoned lubs...|pg||
nt|3for3:  clubs|pg||
nt|kit: This was an example of over-signalling.  Important principle is:  Never signal with a spot which might come in handy.|pg||
pc|sA|mc|10|nt|3for3:  bye everyone|pg||
