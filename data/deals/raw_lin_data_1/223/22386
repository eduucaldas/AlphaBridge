nt|bjacobs: I think maybe they have set the wrong suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and perhaps Smirnov wouold have been better off bidding 3@D over 3@C ...|pg||

pc|s6|nt|vugrapha3: Alex alerted the 5h bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so it must mean something for him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The good thing is that diamonds is the "boss" suit, at least of the minors.  Smirnov knows about the 8-card fit there|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: But no, I was right with my analysis, and here they are in a truly dreadful contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's up to Geo to find the deadly spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's certainly plausible to lead the spade ... it's the "unbid" suit, and he has a little something in it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My post-mortem of this auction is that the 4@C bid was wrong.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 3@C was fine ... he had no spade stopper, so the mark-time bid of 3@C was indicated|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it is clear now...missunderstanding in bidding|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: Great work Geo!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and a spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was clearly the indicated lead ... but that's easy to type.  It's not easy to do in the heat of battle|pg||

nt|serhat: well tough one now. Geo could have bid 3D I believe|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer has to take an a-priori inferior play in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lol...thats nice bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Running the diamond jack works beautifully to neutralize 10x in South|pg||
nt|steshome: Hinden stretching for a non-vul game here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|georgia19: bit thin for 3NT, but they have 24HCP between them, do you fancy Graham to get this on the card?|pg||
nt|steshome: I think Sime will duck the first heart and in time collect 2@H tricks and 3@D tricks - i don't think Hinden should move. No fitting cards in partner's suit|pg||
nt|steshome: Georgia, have England won with a match to go?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: yes well done|pg||
nt|steshome: Perhaps E/W have a glass of wine each at the table?|pg||

nt|steshome: Nice unblocking spade play by Osborne with the 10 to finesse the 9 later|pg||
nt|steshome: He'' be playing for Q9x clubs on side for 4 club tricks|pg||
nt|steshome: Questionable high low in spades by North to give the count - Will Osborne believe him?|pg||
nt|georgia19: as he'll be disappointed, the 9th trick seems elusive|pg||

mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: 2@H michaelish here|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: W holding some useful cards, in that case...|pg||
nt|ahalim: and 4@S is on|pg||
nt|josj: that's what W should bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: even opposite a passed hand pd?|pg||
nt|josj: E cannot hold less than Kxxxx Kxxxx|pg||
mb|3D|nt|josj: so just 3 losers|pg||
mb|3H|nt|josj: Eneeds a few jacks which he might well hold as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: in the OR E opened 2@s showing a weak 2 suiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: that's a diffeent story|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT asked for the minor suit so i assume they play that as 5 5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|josj: here he is in the sandwich so his suits should be OK 9which they are not but that's yet another story...)|pg||

pc|c6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|josj: yes, even more so as he does not hold an opening bid at all|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||

nt|josj: BTC|pg||
