mb|2C|nt|ady: 20-20     |pg||
nt|ady: north might suggest a partial in spades or diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: SBU off to a lucky start- missing a game and gaining imps|pg||
nt|cicus: the match is practically over with this game let be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: however this wont be bid to game like so many seem to be:)|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether the Robson School of Risky Overcalls would recommend 2@h with those East cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Károly and Gábor|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: this looks like another game attempt for england -4@S is just about decent at these colors|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Osborne fingering the pass card...|pg||
nt|roswolf: well so would i|pg||
nt|karesz: down, but 5 @d would down, too|pg||
nt|csabi: with those 10s W's overcall is acceptable|pg||
nt|vugraphzzv: W said: table of your dream..|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, borderline but all of us would make the bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 3 laydown games on 3 boards|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: settled for just 2 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 1@c - 2@s would have been weak, so this shows something slightly better.|pg||
nt|cicus: yes I know there is 30 more boards to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and probably shows exactly 5 spades|pg||
nt|zoro40: I think 4spades would be better contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: East hoping for Kxxx hearts and D Ace|pg||
pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: key card keeps pairs out of many bad slams|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|csabi: now the @D finesse has no chance|pg||
nt|karesz: not at all, East always bid 4 @s|pg||
nt|csabi: but he cannot do anything else|pg||
nt|csabi: he can play for the drop|pg||
nt|csabi: I think he will too|pg||

pc|s3|nt|zoro40: Leading spades is verx dangerous in the situation when you do not know how many spades the declerar has|pg||
nt|cicus: I think this game always makes if declarer cashes 2 @Ds then shoots back the club and waits|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cicus: discovered for sure that @DK is behind him - well played|pg||
nt|csabi: can try an endplay|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: passing 2@S would have been my choice|pg||

nt|karesz: and if @c is 4-4....|pg||
mc|9|nt|ady: get diamond right for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: but awkward   as 3 rounds would give west a ruff|pg||
nt|ady: would need to play a diamond to the 8 to get 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: I think likely 8 tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: however, why not make him do the hard work|pg||
nt|zoro40: I think Lakatos  should play the King of clubs instead of spades. Szilagyi should have DB or DBx. From DBxx he should drop small|pg||

nt|dburn: but I don't think Goodman believes that is what it meants|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: another suggestion is that 3NT was a spade cue and another that 3NT was a serious slam try-i|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm anothe interesting sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this should be a good result for England|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is already|pg||
nt|dburn: sensible enough to play as if partner opened 1NT when the opponents come in over a nebulous 1@c|pg||
nt|dburn: but sensible also to agree with partner that this is what you will do|pg||
nt|ady: yes   I did not see the result in the OR |pg||
nt|odysseus69: hard to see anything other than 8 tricks|pg||

nt|dburn: that ought not to have happened - North threw a diamond on the third heart rather than a club, which seemed the more affordable card|pg||
nt|ady: did not see all the play   but 9 tricks look a long way off last hand|pg||

nt|cicus: 3@C from North?|pg||

nt|cicus: but too late|pg||
mb|p|nt|karesz: relay |pg||

pc|hA|nt|golfsquash: not much on here|pg||

nt|csabi: only 8 tricks|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ady: spades worth 3 tricks    little problem here|pg||
nt|karesz: double for @h|pg||

nt|cicus: 3@H is normal|pg||

nt|zoro40: 3spades was serious?|pg||
nt|cicus: serious=I definitely see good slam prospects|pg||
nt|zoro40: Sorry it was not serious beacuse Szilagyi would have bid 3NT by having the ace of spades|pg||
nt|kuttner: in this case why 4@C?|pg||
nt|cicus: but this situation is unclear as @Hs have not been agreed|pg||
nt|kuttner: 3@S just a cue|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't think East's distribution has been discovered|pg||
nt|kuttner: some unwaited IMP-s to the leader (+63)|pg||
nt|zoro40: I wonder what E would have bid if W started his bidding by 2diamonds|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D surely because E would have thought West had 5 of them|pg||
nt|zoro40: It sounds well if 2diamonds always promises 5card at least|pg||
nt|zoro40: 5cards|pg||
nt|cicus: I think that is the case with them, 2@C shows only 2|pg||
nt|zoro40: Gabor! What would you think about 4NT bid at this moment?|pg||
nt|kuttner: W has not all the info needed, but with these cards the trial to slam is realistic|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe AK of spades?|pg||
nt|kuttner: p has 6+@H...|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: looks like an imp for England|pg||

nt|karesz: can make with finesse in @h  and then ruffing a @h|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d5|nt|cicus: but would it be passable?|pg||
nt|csabi: and the more tricks the opps can take the more chance that they err :)|pg||
nt|zoro40: I think Dumbo will not be happy again. It usually destroy the partnership if somebody does not lead in the agreed 9fit suit|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

pc|s4|nt|koksoy: There is no  problem  in  card play..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Bathurst said "we just talked about this auction"|pg||

nt|MolvaM: what about 5@d on repeated trump leads?|pg||

nt|koksoy: only 15 count  was  missing..  why  not  to  try  spade  10|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ahh no entry to repeat :)|pg||
nt|koksoy: defence  can play trump  only  once in 5@D|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no problem as the @cA is well placed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Club 10, 9, 8 makes it . . .|pg||

nt|roswolf: now another hand pregnant with possibilities|pg||
nt|karesz: i was faster!|pg||
nt|kuttner: a typist you are|pg||
nt|karesz: now a hand for Dumbo?|pg||
nt|zoro40: Unquestionable|pg||
nt|karesz: good for weak NT-player!|pg||
nt|zoro40: But you are a journalist ...|pg||
nt|zoro40: It is not fair -)|pg||
nt|karesz: ok, i lost|pg||
nt|kuttner: and a wk NT player|pg||
nt|zoro40: Balázs must be tired|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|trotto: Because while playing 3NT is always better to finesse the J@c, because it seems like East has no entry to his @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: the poisoned arrow soars into the sky|pg||
nt|csabi: no wonder I'm tired by only watching them|pg||
mb|1D|an|hearts|nt|roswolf: will this provide some action!?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|karesz: pass again|pg||
nt|kuttner: rdbl by N|pg||
nt|karesz: 2 @c is 3 down....|pg||
nt|cicus: so it is more expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT a lot down|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed will north venture an opinion?|pg||
nt|kuttner: hi:)|pg||
nt|zoro40: Other guy than Lakatos order a champaigne|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|cicus: he took quite some time to make this difficult decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east has|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like they did well to bid 3NT in OR- the cards are very friendly and it is a bit lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 6 Imps for Eng on bd 13. 3@c made on diamond lead which gave a diamond trick|pg||
pc|sT|nt|odysseus69: looks like 2NT here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|trotto: many pairs use 2@s as transfer to NT in this position. |pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will flow but whose?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could make|pg||
pc|s5|nt|golfsquash: I am speechless|pg||
nt|ady: this looks down 1|pg||
nt|karesz: @S jack was better lead|pg||
nt|karesz: but de cl has 8 minors nad 2 majors|pg||
nt|karesz: dcel and|pg||
nt|karesz: decl|pg||
nt|zoro40: To order a champaigne?|pg||
nt|cicus: to pass|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|karesz: 2 @C X made is not game, so easy to double|pg||
nt|cicus: he's going to drive home yet and what if he has to pay a fine?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|cicus: seems like normal play of small @C to Q then finessing backwards later will bring home the bacon|pg||
nt|sundiszno: a safe contract :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: on 14 the english declarer didnt get the clubs righr at T1 and went -1:(|pg||
nt|karesz: 4 down?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: now can make    9@H good|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup i agree|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: needed to duck the heart    seems only 9 tricks   1 heart 1 spade    7 trump tricks including 1 ruff|pg||
nt|karesz: and some imps back|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cicus: small @H here then @SJ back will give headache to declarer|pg||
nt|zoro40: Ohh Dombi has a new glasses -)|pg||
nt|kuttner: but they can have a rest sometimes, not like you:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|karesz: a tipical play by szilagyi, baut now it is not enough|pg||
mc|10|nt|ady: hands 14 and 15   expensive  for England|pg||
nt|cicus: this is for the gallery|pg||
nt|cicus: wile, at the same time, creates horror in declarer's hearts|pg||
nt|karesz: but perhaps Dombi ii afraid of the @c j in West's hand....|pg||
nt|cicus: exactly, declarer might abandon the @C finesse for fear of letting W in but what else can he do|pg||
nt|cicus: he might try to drop the @CJ as some extra chance|pg||
nt|karesz: 3 @c 4 @d and 2 majors are enough for him, so playing @c K @c 10|pg||
nt|cicus: he can do nothing if E has A-middle honour-8 left|pg||
nt|vugraphzzv: or he can play @C K and after a small the if west has only double clubs..|pg||

mb|p|nt|davpro: I agree. Again.|pg||
nt|koksoy: they  play  4 card  major ??|pg||

nt|vugraphzxs: I'm now wondering if I missed a bid. They seemed to pass that one out very quickly... Could be an adjustment.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 2@s does  seem unlikely, but I didn't see a 4@s card!|pg||
nt|ady: 2 big hands for Pownall|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of thesession     thx all  thx specs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thats all- thanks all|pg||

nt|zoro40: After overruffing by 10 of clubs I meant|pg||
nt|karesz: so i think this is Gamax's day|pg||
mb|p|nt|trotto: it worked well, but only because N felt himself like in squeeze. Some call it a "memory squeeze" some banana-strawberry squeeze.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|karesz: 3 NT?|pg||
nt|zoro40: But it is only 2off (1spade, 3 hearts, 3 diamonds)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm you have given us some hope michael!?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: sorry - my screen suggested finished - clearly plenty more|pg||

mb|p|nt|trotto: sorry: well done Ramot ofc|pg||
nt|ady: Q@D   well placed    3NT should make|pg||
nt|roswolf: will n/s attemppt game!?|pg||

mb|2C|an|16+|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|cicus: 3@S lead director|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: may stop in 2NT?|pg||
nt|karesz: for foreingner: kemény means hard in English|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sundiszno: so this is the last boarsd|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: surely 1@S was misguide|pg||
nt|csabi: clever bid by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well thank heavens for small mercies|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on a spade lead would be very lucky to make    but unlikely to get a spade lead on the auction|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant understand this -QX looks like good support on this auction|pg||
nt|csabi: worth at least 5 IMP, maybe 12|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|trotto: a very good lead by Banach leaving declarer with only 9 tricks. |pg||
nt|roswolf: this is the last bd of the segment -restart in 15-20 mins approx|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 2@h promised @d support|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see why N bid 3@S, does he really want to play 4 with those valueless @Hs?|pg||
nt|cicus: he could have passed and later reopened with 3@S|pg||
pc|d3|nt|odysseus69: I suppose that if pd did not open 2H then 2H is only 5 and promises 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kuttner: ty all:)|pg||
nt|sundiszno: thx all for watching, and gongatulations to GAMAX team, they will represent Hungary in the EC|pg||

nt|MolvaM: specs predict 800 if def leads trumps but with @hK onside I thk 500 is the limit|pg||
