nt|kareno: Here's a place:  http://bridgewinners.com/ for instant score|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well "instant" only after session scores reported|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bridgemate not in use, boards not duplicated   so  we must wait|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bridgewinners has done a very nice job with their design|pg||
nt|kareno: Presumably 2@s was forcing and that was the limit of what west wanted to add.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you mouse over the team name, it will pop-up the team roster and sometimes show player photo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C was game force|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: 6@S looks like a decent spot on these cards|pg||
nt|lml: although neither table reached it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1-level opening suit presumed to be 14+ HCP  so 10+ hcp response sets up game force|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: so just one down i guess on spade lead|pg||
nt|bt: this 3@C is not a thing of beauty |pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: NS in trouble -- the ultra-weak preempt has worked|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kareno: I actually prefer 1@c with 5/5 blacks but that is an ongoing debate.  If n/s are playing forcing club then 1@s is mandated but otherwise ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Karen [also] read a lot of Acol books in misspent youth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are a few pairs who will still open 1@C with 5-5 blacks|pg||
nt|iceking: as it is 4@H looks rather cold so will save imps here |pg||
nt|kareno: 2@c - 1n not so often and I still prefer 1@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think michael rosenberg will in some circumstances and maybe chip martel??|pg||
nt|kareno: Someone asking me what do I do if partner responds 1nt to my 1@c|pg||
pc|cT|nt|reisig: Pass ...a forcing Pass = firing squad|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zagorin asks about carding: "UD attitude, STD count"|pg||
nt|phil: is pass really forcing RR? |pg||
nt|reisig: For me ..YES ..for you ..who knows?|pg||
nt|phil: :P|pg||
nt|phil: I would file this under, "if the vugraph commentator doesnt think its forcing, its not".....|pg||
nt|phil: sounds so much better than the waiter or the janitor, dont you think? |pg||
nt|reisig: Some reverse the "Pass..and X" here|pg||
nt|phil: yes, their names tend to end in vowels however|pg||
nt|reisig: Meaning ...X = 6 might be OK ...and Pass = X or be killed :)|pg||
nt|phil: Kranyak has a pretty good sense of South's shape - I wonder why the tank|pg||
nt|reisig: He ordered a drink from the bar|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lml: not going to work out well to duck|pg||
nt|kareno: With worse clubs than south has I open 1@s.  For me it is always 'all things being equal'|pg||
nt|iceking: Peter didnt overcall 2@H in open room so never got into the bidding|pg||
nt|kareno: He thinks his partner is ruffing this.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on flip side   there is camp that says  if you don't open 5-card major  you don't have one!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ask steve robinson what he would open with  5008 :)|pg||
nt|kareno: That is the Steve Robinson school of bridge.  I'm not an adherent.|pg||
nt|lml: I think we have gone a little bit overboard on the 'love the majors front"|pg||
nt|kareno: Linda knows I'm a four-card major player :)|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it didn't apply here, but worth mentioning   even if you normally lead A from AK -- at 5+ level you should revert to King from AK|pg||
