nt|bjacobs: Declarer has to take an a-priori inferior play in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lol...thats nice bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Running the diamond jack works beautifully to neutralize 10x in South|pg||
nt|steshome: Hinden stretching for a non-vul game here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|georgia19: bit thin for 3NT, but they have 24HCP between them, do you fancy Graham to get this on the card?|pg||
nt|steshome: I think Sime will duck the first heart and in time collect 2@H tricks and 3@D tricks - i don't think Hinden should move. No fitting cards in partner's suit|pg||
nt|steshome: Georgia, have England won with a match to go?|pg||

nt|steshome: Nice unblocking spade play by Osborne with the 10 to finesse the 9 later|pg||

nt|steshome: Questionable high low in spades by North to give the count - Will Osborne believe him?|pg||
nt|georgia19: as he'll be disappointed, the 9th trick seems elusive|pg||

mb|d|nt|serhat: an other slam|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 2D is multi only weak option|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, and not easy for E/W, after the multi|pg||
nt|serhat: W has very good hand though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So does East, but it's still difficult.  For example, any suggestions on what East should do here?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 3@D doesn't look forcing to me|pg||
nt|serhat: well may be 2nt =not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One of the problems with this auction is that E/W don't know South's suit.  Hence they have no easy cue-bids|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I got stuck with exactly this problem in the NEC recently.  I had to guess ... wrongly as usual|pg||
nt|subhranp:  scores level in this segment so far 5-5 so maya meera continue to lead by 24 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: E bid 1@s before N, N called director and then comes up with dbl. 1@s stands for E |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|serhat: was forcing Bill!:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Here Sveindal has guessed rightly|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: wow|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think it's remotely forcing.  But it's certainly constructive, and certainly at least a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: flat board|pg||
nt|georgia19: NS playing strong NT so EW find spade fit.....cards badly placed for them|pg||
nt|steshome: E/W play 2@S bid by Hinden as showing the weakest hnad for an o/call in preference to pass|pg||
nt|subhranp:  North and East are screen mates?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|serhat: lets say contstructive plus!|pg||
nt|georgia19: EW heading for a minus, but lead has helped.....|pg||
nt|steshome: odd lead it seems|pg||
nt|subhranp:  another gain for DSM on B5, as 3NT is misdefended in the othe room.|pg||

nt|georgia19: yes, why not a club....|pg||

nt|steshome: do you prefer 1@S chosen by jagger in the other room, or 2@H, georgia?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|bjacobs: Yeah, it's horrible, but I think West was asleep at the wheel. |pg||

pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|serhat: He didnt see his 7.5 tricks hand properly|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And there's no doubt East had a second chance to clarify his massive strength, and 3@D didn't really do that|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||

nt|steshome: Is there another set after this one?|pg||
nt|georgia19: 1@s nf so could be left in a 5-1 fit which is silly when you know you have a heart fit|pg||

nt|steshome: that's why i don't like this 4@S bid with no aces|pg||

mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: Very sad result for E/W who were having a very nice set up till then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And Sveindal might be saying: "I didn't expect you to be that strong, hence my pass".  So technically, the blame goes to the partnership|pg||
mb|3C|nt|serhat: ahh W.. no I dont agree with you.. I blame E . 2d can be anything. he has no @D fitno good clubs or H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh well, that's what makes horseracing.  The 2@D bid is a matter of partnership style, I guess|pg||
nt|serhat: at least he could have rdbled|pg||
