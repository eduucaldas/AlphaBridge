mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2@H pass/correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [i assume]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Bertheau asking about the DBL - I think Molberg expressed some uncertainty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can imagine also using 2@D to ask for major  [then 2@H=own suit]|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: kind of dazngerous position, for a brand new pairing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: passed hand DBL should be takeout??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit, how would you treat Aa's DBL |pg||
nt|kit: Is West really thinking of doing something?  Seems like would be pretty big position.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: he's still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-17|pg||
nt|kit: Takeout if strong NT, penalty if weak NT|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: This looks very wrong to me -- opponents have max of 8 spades, may not have that, and no guarantee of a decent fit|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: and you thought the remaining hands were bland|pg||
nt|kit: However it probably didn't cost if 2@S was making, which I think it was.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: with a 3 IMP margin, bland hands are enough :)|pg||
nt|3for3:  plus that jack of spades is more likely to score on defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  59  Falk picks up 10  to lead Jacobs by  18|pg||
nt|ritong: guess this is an important part of Aa's decision   the bad case is both contracts fail|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Bertheau & Molberg having a discussion in Swedish and Norwegian|pg||
nt|kit: Hard to see more than 7 tricks coming to declarer in any variation.|pg||

pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: full credit to Bertheau  and partnership for having the agreement of balancing bid by passed hand|pg||
nt|kit: So the big swing was from North's decision to balance -- a decision I heartily approve of|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|kit: If you can hit partner with 3 spades, 2 clubs, and still come out a big winner, it is a pretty good indication that balancing is right |pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C  nat or strong hand -- 16+???|pg||
nt|ritong: 430+50 is 10 imps  430+100 is 11 imps|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: Likely king of clubs lead.  Then things get very interesting.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can now officially congratulate  Falk beats Jacobs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quite a feat for 4 man team originally seeded  47|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kit: oh my -- very unexpected contract|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: who wrote this script???|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: and getting worse|pg||
nt|ritong: well...|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|kit: not clear how many diamonds makes -- complex|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@d has play, and so do 6@ds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Bertheau explaining something - now going through the auction explaining the bids, but I can't translate, sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs  please  try to examine 5@D just looking at NS hands   as if you were at the table|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: Quite an opening lead problem for starters|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gib looks at all 4 hands  |pg||
nt|kit: Assuming he doesn't get diamonds right, he will need to guess spades.  If he does, he will have entry for long heart which is ruffed out, taking 5 diamonds, 4 hearts, 1 spade, 1 ...|pg||
nt|kit: club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF there is a tie    8-board overtime|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: But if he misguesses spades he also loses the entry, and will be down 2.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Now Aa asking something of Cullin - probably also about the auction|pg||
nt|kit: He might ruff club and lead diamond to 10, to protect spade position.  If so, that would be very good for declarer.|pg||
nt|kit: Then he would certainly make if he guesses spades.  But if not, only 6 diamonds, 3 hearts, 1 club for down 1 and overtime.|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will get diamonds right.  Both for the entry protection, and the inference that no trump led.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|d3|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|kit: yep, he is going to do just that.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: betting coke -- that is SERIOUS|pg||
nt|kit: But he still has the spade guess coming|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|kit: There is possible end-play on 4th round of hearts by ruffing out clubs - -- but he didn't find that.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: doesn't really know @C position  so no inferences from failure to see @S lead from Molberg|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|s2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|d7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|kit: he can set up heart -- might be better to ruff club and find out more.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: well done to keep @C|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: and here we are!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|ritong: 430+50 is 10 imps|pg||
nt|ritong: directors preparing 8 boards, just in case|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: They have the boards, but my computer's power source isn't working well, so I'm nervous!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: john swanson telling story of      i can't do it -- so flip @S over shuffle and have opponent pick|pg||
nt|ritong: jan told us previously they are set already|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't even joke about that Jan|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
