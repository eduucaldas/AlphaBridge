nt|vugraphzeg: This is the trials for the third spot on the Swedish ladies team for Dublin this summer|pg||
nt|arvidsson: NS is current leaders and EW are the runnerups|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some pairs use transfers after 1M-dbl, so here 2@d would be a decent raise to 2@h, and 2@h would, er, not be |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Two pairs have been pre-elected, Sandra Rimstedt (North's sister)-Emma Sjöberg and Pia Andersson-Marie Johansson|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in practice it seems to work quite well |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: NS do|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: 3nt might be the final spot, even though it will not make|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|arvidsson: that if there is a @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East upgraded quite heavily|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|arvidsson: S might consider leading a @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no real reason why S should not lead a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: West bid spades, so that is very unlikely|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: S might need to unblock if E wins the second round|pg||
nt|arvidsson: is there any agony for blockage in @H?|pg||

nt|arvidsson: the problem for E hand is that it neads either a @H stopper or the @S A to make (+diamonds are running)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :( three|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: only 50's|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: Cecilia escaped the axe for now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, N has run - very wise|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: all that you learn tells you that the East hand is unsuitable for a weak two - four decent spades, etc - but it is tempting|pg||
nt|runnerup: but if you open @h at any level -you miss ok @s -in @s -ofcause this time down -so rigth at table today|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: 6 @s/west|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: in the same way that a toast bacon sandwich is tempting|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|arvidsson: it is a little bit as is the glass half full or half emty, If I open 3@H I hope push opponents to a 4@S game instead of 3nt|pg||
pc|h7|nt|arvidsson: not being afraid to miss a 4@S game myself|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|arvidsson: what would be the meaning of x instead of bidding 2@S? is that a way to say I got @H covered or is it takeout?|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: takeout double gives better info -even some @d contract caan be rigth -or defende|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: with one of my partners we play double there as penalties of the first suit. Might not work every time, but at least it is an agreement |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and if partner has the second suit, he can pass for penalties|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Roland would want to be in 7@C here :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|runnerup: this is a good  slam -needs to be bid -should make if no to bad play done|pg||

nt|mdgraham: might as well go off in this as anything else|pg||
nt|runnerup: west made this choice -migth be soluted other ways in other table|pg||

nt|mdgraham: NS have been very affected by "field strangeness" this set - they do not seem to have anything poor, it's just that the other results have slaughtered them |pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu:  with misfit to partner I would pass in S|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: *but even if you do|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 5@d was very good contract but was not easy to bid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|arvidsson: ok this should be a good contract for NS, 2@H will make|pg||
nt|arvidsson: and 1nt makes EW?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: looks that way|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|pelu:  7-8 tricks in NT for EW|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|pelu:  a lucky 2@H bid by S - but NS need some luck|pg||
nt|pelu:  the 2@H making cost NS -3|pg||
nt|arvidsson: bidding 2@H with stiff @S lookes a bit strange to me, but dont argue with succes|pg||

nt|pelu:  why not a small @H from W?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: that is if only 5 card suit, with semi support in @S  you could normaly use @S as spare trumps|pg||
nt|arvidsson: raising with the Q of @H lookes strange to me|pg||
nt|arvidsson: so have no answer to that question|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|h9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|pelu:  sorry East played @h10 - so @hQ and small @H back|pg||
