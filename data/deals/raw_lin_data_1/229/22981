mb|2H|nt|ady: balance by north pushes  e/w overboard|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is a transfer to clubs here i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course madala knows his opponents have at least a game, and quite possibly more, so he makes as much noise as he can|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzdu: El remate hubo stayman y luego 3 st.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missed opportunity for trailing team|pg||
nt|runnerup:  nice kvick tricks in 3nt and south has no problems to bid that|pg||
nt|athene: good low-hcp 3nt; 100% secure on any lead and any lie|pg||
nt|athene: yes it shows the power of a long suit with quick tricks outside|pg||
nt|athene: NS don't have a single point wasted in fact|pg||
nt|athene: maybe Duboin is wondering which major to lead?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time 4 @s is anly 300 but you lose in a long run if you bid those -because in all cases ns aren't aware what they do and 3nt can go down|pg||
nt|athene: yes i don't think EW can reasonably contemplate a sacrifice|pg||
nt|athene: -300 vs -400 is the best you can possibly hope for|pg||
nt|athene: and it might often be -300 or -500 against +50|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - but 3@H looks like a make so down 1 may be good business|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts should make   so -50  best e/w can do|pg||

nt|queequeg: @H@H INTONTI Riccardo    VERSACE Alfredo     ZALESKI Romain|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may not bid 3@S with only 3 trumps so this could be IMPs to the Patane team|pg||
nt|athene: west has a lot more than he might have, but of course it is hard with no club control and no diamond honour|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzdu: El remate quedo en 3 st, poleschi abrio de 1st 2@c el compañero 2@d no tnego mayores y 3 st. contrato final.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 2@d was some sort of relay - wonder what 4@d meant|pg||
nt|athene: you would think south would have bid 5@H rather than 5@C if he knew what his partner had|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sharkey: Assuming they bid 3@H other room|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: argh|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|gsper:  More @C might have troubled the declarer more, but probably not that much|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: suggestion that 4@d showed hearts in some way, but if so then it is odd that S didn't bid them|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: everybody EW will be unhappy on that hand|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 4th club awkward now    |pg||

mb|2C|nt|Vugraphzfj: Lew and Shi make the universal sign for the strong 2@C bid: the bicep flex.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Now Gu and Martel flex their biceps... I'm not sure this is how ladies would communicate this information, but there you go.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfj: Hi all, and welcome! We had some technical delays but are now up and running.  Table commentary thus far: "They're gonna start penalize us for running late."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Lew and Jonathan are still playing in semi-darkness, as we fear hooking up our powerful stadium-style lighting will blow the fuses again...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Robinson: "good lead ..u found it"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Hello Jack|pg||
nt|joest: in teh other room east-west silent throughout so little chance (i.e. no chance) for Demeriv toguess the spades|pg||
nt|joest: things are different here|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfj: Actually Chip played 4 then 5, apologies.|pg||
nt|joest: Robinson doesn't really have time to discover that Garner might 'need' the queen of spades for his takeout double.  He can't really be sure of the red suit honor layouts|pg||

nt|sharkey: we shall never know....|pg||
nt|athene: i think he can be sure that east has short clubs, but even so, bidding 6 is not so easy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that wouild probably be a rotten pairs score |pg||
nt|runnerup:  west can wander where ns's tricks come if they make this -south must have lond @d -like 6 cards -north is more balanced perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: probably EW will get a free run in the other room, so then it is a matter of east's rebid after 1@D 1@H|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|sharkey: Some number of @D here...|pg||
nt|athene: west neither strong nor unbalanced enough for 2@C opener in first or second, but here the requirements are relaxed|pg||
nt|gsper:  NS can make a lot in @S|pg||
nt|athene: will Angelini bid 1@S or show the 2-suiter?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some prefer to keep the 2-suited overcalls weak or very strong, so a 12 count might not qualify|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|ady: 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||

nt|mdgraham: good evening all. |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Can't see W have another bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c 10-13, 5+@C, could be weaker in third seat|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Markku|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now north has to decide between 3@H and a second double|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: sharp double would reap 300|pg||
nt|queequeg: @s@S ====== Running Scores ====== @S@S|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|athene: close decision in my opinion|pg||
nt|runnerup:  vulnerability is bad so north has about cards to expect by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|gsper:  So 4@S is a good save, but unlikely to be found now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no chance here of course|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you just play spades and accept two down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double is more flexible, as they say|pg||
nt|queequeg: players in both the rooms:|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south has shape -not points but |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - but neither N nor S can x|pg||
nt|queequeg: welcome to our commentators: Mike Graham and Markku Pekkinen :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: with the @H lead surely|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/1.jpg|pg||
nt|queequeg: Open room, waiting to start|pg||
nt|athene: tricky declarer play problem here|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to decide whether to try to use the spades, or go for two diamond ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: a double for takeout by north if available would have worked well|pg||
nt|queequeg: welcome Bob :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: N obviously knows what to expect from 2@h |pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|gsper:  N might have doubled 2@D, but with both opponents showing cards, and vul, it was not very attractive|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H finesse and can make. 6@H+1@S+2@D+1@C=10|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would make this, but E may be good enough to find a losing line|pg||
pc|h2|nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/2.jpg|pg||
nt|runnerup:  even 4 ! has chance but so little strentgh |pg||
nt|runnerup:  @h|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4@S bid at the other table was perhaps unwise, left east guessing whose hand it was|pg||
pc|d3|nt|queequeg: Closed room|pg||
nt|runnerup:  aouth likes to defende 3 @d  -tx partner it is-because in many cases -he cant see to pass|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed has no other choice.:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  How much did 2@D show?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That is we can see all cards.|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/17.jpg Closed Room|pg||
nt|runnerup:  +100 with best lead -@h possible but  50 now --140 for ns looks odds on in @s|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: even with this nice start, and trumps 3-3, declarer should be one down|pg||
nt|athene: east just holds up in spades and there is nowhere to put the @D109|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure east did not especially like leading that unsupported ace, but it's just that nothing else appealed at all|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: ended quietly for 130|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about this kind of canape approach - if it is systematic|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|gsper:  @H raise or natural forcing I am told|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: S might have tried 3@S, but 3@h feels like a definite statement |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: the defence can't counter both threats now - if ace and another club, declarer can use the spades if he picks the layout|pg||

nt|queequeg: Closed room: http://td.bboitalia.it/25.jpg|pg||
nt|jaapfr: link to standing?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: is declarer going to cash the @CAK then try a spade to hand, hoping if that holds, to play a club throwing the @HA?|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's not a bad plan :)|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes that sort of thing is useful but here even if it worked, it would not help especially|pg||
nt|athene: even if clubs break you get 2 hearts, 4 clubs, spade...that's not 3NT by a fair way|pg||
nt|athene: in the play here the defence would have time to attack diamonds anyway|pg||

nt|queequeg: @H CAITI Stefano       @H PATTACINI Maurizio    @H ZAFFINO Maurizio|pg||
nt|athene: in the bidding, a hidden issue is whether north's "double-then-3@H" route showed just any hand too strong for 2@H first time, or whether it does promise a flexible hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: over a normal weak-two opener by opponents, a jump overcall is strong e.g. (2@D) 3@H|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/6.jpg Open Room|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: did the diamonds really go like that? seems odd|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: so you could argue that double then bidding a suit doesn't show a hand that definitely wants to commit to that suit|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/5.jpg   Closed Room|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|gsper:  Andy, the ambiguous nature of 2@D complicated it for N|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: but all that is a bit tenuous|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer can only get one diamond ruff but north gets squeezed in diamonds and spades|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: Open Room they all look very happy|pg||

mb|d|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the trouble with a splinter is you are not likely to get cooperation (ie. too strong)|pg||

nt|bobh1: N might have opened|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: i suppose he could bid 5@H now, saying lots of controls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S effectively the same, except should usually be spade void|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: which might have saved a partscore swing|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2@d probably 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|gsper:  1NT 12-14, often offshape|pg||
nt|athene: when south bids 3@H with only six he has to have some shape i think|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe declarer should have played for 4-1 spades, but not easy|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: maybe can block the diamonds and survive|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gsper:  Transfer, of course. E was doing the thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i prefer 2@C for that purpose, as partner can bid 2@D with no preference|pg||
nt|athene: interesting, he doesn't go 4@H|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt ew here and if something /else ) happens -it is a suprice|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with opening 4@H is that if opps bid 4@S or 5@C over it, as they very likely will, you are left not knowing what to do|pg||

pc|h5|nt|athene: however, the way it has gone, he has hardly shown his hand either|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: this auction would show extras for me, and for sure that double was penalty|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 2@H transfer to @S and 2@S for @S check. Am I right?|pg||

nt|gsper:  Hi|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: 3@D is hearts and 3@S is a super-accept, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D retransfer|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello CK and wlc.|pg||
nt|athene: yes i think just bidding 4 right away with north is reasonable|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not see how South can know what is useful and what is not.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: might have a club slam opposite suitable cards, but it's shooting for the moon a bit - 3NT is practical |pg||
nt|athene: might be 4@H or 4@D for them|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: on a club attack declarer might have to overtake in spades to get a fast pitch from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know what the redouble was|pg||
nt|athene: and i can't believe angelini did either|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: maybe if the auction had tempoed out differently he would have bid - for example if west made some raise and then east bid 4@S and that was passed round to him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although if the @s10 forces the king the defence would need an immediate diamond switch|pg||
nt|athene: so losing one heart, one diamond, and one club|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sharkey: perhaps being NV was a factor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: let's hope we are guessing well|pg||
nt|athene: on any other lead he can happily unblock the @SK as he has time to build an entry to his @SAQ, so plus one|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Rashed & Goran|pg||

pc|c7|nt|henryb:  "I like @s" perhaps?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: another problem on defense for west, succeeds if he clears the spades, but also must unguard the diamonds later|pg||
nt|athene: but as it went, bidding 5@D in front of his partner is a bit of a gamble|pg||
nt|athene: of course, passing is a big gamble too|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: the other table you can see Stevie Weinstein playing for Fleisher.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i wonder if 4m is a splinter or fit-showing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: so he chooses to show a limit raise, usualy 4 trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2NT is explained as invitational with hearts.  In response to Chip's questions, David writes, "usually four."|pg||
nt|bobh1: he probably intends to bid 4@C even if jonathan declines, which i dont think he will|pg||
nt|bobh1: most pairs play some kind of bromad after the double|pg||
mb|2S!|an|!c|nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby commented afterwards that he should've flashed Andy his @HQ, perhaps he would've passed 4@H.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a little gamesmanship|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: But he didn't know that he should flash it to Andy instead of Franco.  Franco then launched into an explanation of the "fishhead coup," which it seems we can expect to see on ...|pg||

nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/9.jpg |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: doubt if there will be any surprises on this one either - 4@h EW|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|sharkey: 30 points between them - cud be probing slam...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10-13, 5+@d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|athene: same sort of bidding problem for south here as faced north a moment ago over the 2@C opener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sort of like a strong weak two|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni-nunes 2-level bids do give their opponents some hard decisions|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzdu: holaa|pg||
nt|mdgraham: getting any higher would not be advisable|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bobholl: common expert treatment is 1NT on N hand |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a string weak two is presumably a bit weaker than a weak strong two|pg||
nt|athene: or a bit weaker than a rope weak two i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: interesting decision for north there|pg||

nt|queequeg: Closed room: http://td.bboitalia.it/21.jpg|pg||
nt|athene: pass (bit wet), double (if takeout), 2@D (your best suit) or 1@S (spades!) all worth consideration|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: declarer should make 10 tricks sometime today|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: lanzarotti obviously takes 2@S as showing a very weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: the immediate bid after the redouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I guess N could double 3@d with a good(ish) hand |pg||
nt|athene: you might say "well, obviously north must be broke, after the opponents have both shown decent hands"|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will be a bit worried here; only 8 obvious tricks even with the club finesse working|pg||
nt|psyck: I like dbl of the options|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C just makes but 3@S could be for -500|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not sure about this - 2@c may be Gazzilli |pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS are too balanced, but it's hard for either side to realise this|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobholl: @c queen is a nice card but not shown|pg||
nt|athene: well, no 4@C, so madala knows they are off the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: they'll play six, though, i would think|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2NT said he liked clubs|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jaapfr: 5@D might make|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have a great hand for clubs in that context|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: oh well :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@h not very good needs @C 32 and king rigth most times|pg||
nt|athene: but the point is, if you work out what partner has by trusting your opponents, then you get talked out of games when west has psyched the redouble|pg||
nt|psyck: beautiful venue indeed|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: but the spades are blocked so he can play on diamonds successfully|pg||
nt|athene: i think if 5@C was there, west would have bid it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: did E se 4@C as foricng?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: need to be cautious    even 5 level could be too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nobody ever won at bridge by trusting the opponents|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't think Sementa would compete to 3 level with a 4333 hand, but it works fine here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: so having agreements with partner is a better way to go, what with him being on your side|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most of the time.....|pg||
nt|athene: south can see declarer is all set to throw hearts on spades, so might as well attack hearts now?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C obviously something showing a good hand, maybe showing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on;y blocked if he wins this :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing king looks the odds play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
nt|athene: lead was @S9 showing bad suit|pg||
nt|athene: and if it was lauria who had the spades, he would have let versace win the first diamond to clear the suit surely|pg||
nt|athene: hello good morning|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: hi Martin|pg||
nt|athene: oh well|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Great,|pg||
nt|gsper:  Ducking this would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Now 10 tricks for NS.|pg||
nt|psyck: 9, has a trump to lose|pg||
nt|gsper:  Surely they must lose a trump too?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: with the idea that you will get your club tricks anyway?|pg||
nt|gsper:  You got ahead of me!|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@H promised five it looks ok|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c3|nt|athene: sure east has a maximum but it's all queens, and only two clubs|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: most irritating is to go down at the 5 level having mad a slam try   but will be ok here|pg||
nt|sharkey: still has to make it - like you stated David|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: of course it is always easier to work out how the cards lie when you can see how they lie :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is no joy  in Mudville....|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: in fact will have to play carefully       may go down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wonder if the @S4 had any significance|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he decided the only way to beat was partner having the @CA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for non baseball fans, that refers to a famous poem|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and a wasted @SQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|athene: if trumps are clubs are 3-2, you don't need the @CK right, do you? just lose club, ruff clubs good|pg||
nt|athene: *if trumps AND clubs are 3-2|pg||
nt|athene: because you can cash clubs and get the heart through as well|pg||
nt|athene: partner having the @HK is not in itself enough; even if you cash some hearts, declarer can throw enough clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H would be interesting|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north was waiting higher contracts -with his 3 aces -but nothing he could do now|pg||
nt|gsper:  And likely a @C loser too|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: has to look after 4th diamond|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's true but still not much better than 50%|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but there are other chances too|pg||
pc|c9|nt|psyck: yes, easier call if 1@h was 5, i play it as 4+|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C10 doesnt tell too much|pg||
nt|ady: if 3 rounds of trumps are drawn   no where for the 4th diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.federbridge.it/main.html|pg||
nt|runnerup:  even 3 @s has good chance -best played by north (so 1. round pass seem too wet -has to be repeated|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see why 4@C should be forcing|pg||
mc|10|nt|ady: if 2 rounds only drawn   and a diamond finesse   then north can play a heart to south for a club ruff|pg||

nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to ruff a club and pick up trumps, losing just one spade, two diamonds and the @CA|pg||
nt|psyck: to prevent losing 2 trump tricks via @c ruff on a bad day...|pg||
nt|athene: well 3@S can be beaten with diamond ruff and then club shift i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't draw trumps and then get back to dummy fast to throw his club losers on the two good diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: neither do I but else why E bids 5@C:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  making n/s   but an excellent save for e/w in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know the intricacies of the NS methods but i suspect 2nt showed extras|pg||
nt|athene: but if west led a spade, east could win the @CA and return a diamond and then throw two clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer could never get to dummy as east could overruff with the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, all irrelevant anyway|pg||
nt|athene: or just a club lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5 @c ok -here -4 @h makes ..so |pg||
mb|1C|nt|sharkey: think 3@S max|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some 9 in @h ew if opened and will |pg||
nt|athene: 5@D might come home but 4@C tick would have been a reasonable place to stop i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not sure e/w will be able to enter the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if north bid only 2@S and east doubled, that would find the club fit, but that is surely the only way|pg||
nt|athene: and i think north will bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  4 losers in spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: But NS likely will end up in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: the only way 4@S makes is if the defence don't attack diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to bid it - S will decline any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: but that's not happening|pg||
nt|athene: i think north just bids 3@S here and they play there|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree William|pg||
nt|ady: will east enter if north raises to 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@C also possibility - Splinter|pg||
nt|athene: i would probably double 2@S with the east cards|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@C NOT precision style, though it looks that way|pg||
nt|psyck: Right Bill, which is why I guess Markku said better chances played by N|pg||
nt|athene: double fit might come to light here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: now a support double for spades i guess, so they find their 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sing @s makes it ofcause dangerous to open 4. hand|pg||
nt|athene: well sort of double fit :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  mainly that and west will lead @h Q --normally -@c lead only after peeping|pg||
nt|athene: many would just raise clubs with east, but sementa obviously feels that with opps bidding hearts, it is worth a lot for your side to find spades, rather than clubs|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: south will have trouble showing hand now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: N has a shortage of points but great playing strength when pd bid @S|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt was a spade raise you would think south would bid a discouraging 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will pay to stop low here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like a direct 3@D invite, although the bid has several flaws|pg||
nt|psyck: 2C = 10-13 value, 5C-4other unbalanced, or 6+C|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@D relay asking for 3-card major|pg||
nt|psyck: N's hand becomes powerful with Aces in pd's suit now|pg||
nt|athene: angelini can't bid less than game now, can he? ace in both partner's suits for a single raise|pg||
nt|athene: transfer responses, so 1@S shows diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  3. hands pass -was a view =suprice also|pg||
mb|d|nt|gsper:  2NT relay again|pg||
nt|athene: ok, apparently he can|pg||
nt|athene: east might balance now with a double|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last makeble bid NS 2@D|pg||
mb|r|nt|athene: i think support doubles are not as popular in italy as in america, but still if you double 1@H with 4+ spades here you surely need them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could have responded 2@d, perhaps, but that may be FG, and S isn't quite strong enough for that (non strong-club opener)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry but don't have a CC for NS|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: still will easy enough for defence to collect their 4 winners  |pg||
nt|athene: ok, the fifth spade is nice, and QJ doubleton is much better when partner opens the suit, but even so...|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i'm told 2NT is 6-4|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tactical 3 @h to play in 4 ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and EW just make 2@S imo|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: ah a spec suggests north is "she" - i was assuming a different angelini haha|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 now -but ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: everyone has shown his hand fairly, except N who should have bid stronger|pg||
nt|athene: i don't understand why west bids spades rather than hearts, but it sure worked out|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so 3@H was just attempting to sign off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT is FG|pg||
nt|athene: even if 2@D response were not GF you might bid a spade anyway so as not to lose the suit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2000 |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h showed 3-4 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d showed 1345|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought the redouble might give EW a better chance to find the right major, if west could pass and let east bid spades|pg||
mb|3D|nt|runnerup:  200 -500 with x|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks too aggressive|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so north was weaker than i would have been |pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: very complicated hand, but at least the lead reveals south has no natural lead|pg||
nt|athene: you feel silly here if you try the jack and then south has a singleton queen|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if NS did bid game, east might well bid 5@C, surely?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: just take A and @D K|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: getting to a nice safe 3@D partscore is not trivial really|pg||
nt|athene: also i have no idea what the redouble is all about :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobholl: made now no problem|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless your playing flattery|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: but then north feels that facing any sort of heart fit it is worth a shot at game|pg||
nt|athene: run all the diamonds looks reasonable|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so if you pass 3. hand -why bid again ..ofcause souths 2 @s was aggressive also|pg||
nt|psyck: they have some defense, may not be all that clear to bid 5@c, though it is very likely they will bid it as insurance at this vul|pg||
nt|jaapfr: XX and 3@C and 3@D do mean: pls opps go to an unmakebele level:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|runnerup:   at least you get + score there -2 aces -and|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what north was worried about - pushing opps into 5@C making - but that is not a big danger when you have two aces and partner opened|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though west bid 2@S because he assumed opps would compete further and then he could show hearts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|runnerup:  norths|pg||
nt|athene: but why is he so anxious to bid 3 over 3?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as you said earlier about 2@S bid|pg||
nt|athene: partner doubled 2@D so you push them up to 3@D and beat them|pg||
nt|jaapfr: W thinks mb @H my pds suit|pg||

nt|athene: opps might well tell you how to play the spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, they have escaped without a double|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: as far as i can see, declarer had to go after spades, which lie favourably|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|runnerup:  actually a suprice|pg||
nt|jaapfr: could 3@D X -2 (think declarer can end with -1)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@S1@H2@D and 1@C loser|pg||

nt|jaapfr: easy 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  if you are afread of oppenents to make 5 -level with those cards after partner opens and invites -youll never can bid any games |pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: south had made a great lead, and should have known every card at the end|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S-1 on hand 4 cost 12 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|athene: perfect mesh here - singleton facing four small - let's see if they can identify it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to locate @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows some sort of good raise and *south* shows extras and a heart singleton, that will certainly do it|pg||
nt|athene: well, with a ten-card fit you don't usually count the queen of trumps as a problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT 12-14; not 5/4 majors or 4441|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D looking for a 5-3 spade fit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, CC not clear about 3@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3M would be a singleton or void|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead runs to the jack, and declarer will duck a club to north to protect the @SKx i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: if east is thinking this long he must have forgotten the system :)|pg||
nt|athene: wake up, fantoni!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, misread the CC. 1NT can include a 4441 shape.|pg||
nt|athene: EW's 1nt has to cover a lot of hands unsuitable for other bids, sort of like a precision 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: their 1-bids are 14+ points and their 2-bids are unbalanced so the weak notrump has to work hard for its living|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, lots of people; no idea about 3@d|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobholl: always difficult to rerach a normal 4@S after weak NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a partial available both sides.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lovely 1@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: only problem 6@S n/s  is the 3-0 trump split    needs to guess which way to play trumps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Any bidding by EW cud assist declarer in locating the Q|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S=at least 5/4 both minors |pg||
nt|gsper:  That is a heavy overcall by their standards|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S from north will certainly get them there in short order|pg||

mb|4S|nt|ady: this is where west showing a 2 suiter might give the distribution away     vulnerability was against west entering|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe just natural and strong, and then everything natural-ish, with 3@S showing stopper and concern about hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny, on the copy of the EW CC I have 1NT-3minor is not described at all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so presumably they are natural bids|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: even when the opponents are silent you can sometimes use that to help find the Qxx|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|athene: by asking "which defender would be more likely to bid if he DID have a spade void?"|pg||
nt|psyck: no idea what the bids mean, but they reach the normal contract|pg||
nt|psyck: i assume transfer adv & 1@s leass than 3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: i wonder if east had super-accepted, whether south would have bid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: he might well have done, as the super-accept would mark his partner with a singleton heart, so that is pretty good news |pg||
nt|mdgraham: expensive @sk|pg||

nt|gsper:  The Slawinski leads are not complex in themselves, but the follow-up may be|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: but at this vulnerability, that line of thought does not really help so much, because even with a lot of shape, the opponents are not going to be bidding|pg||
nt|ady: in my opinion that would not be a reasonable question to ask |pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny how often 4441 hands never quite live up to their potential (in terms of hcp) |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: i am very surprised east did not take another bid|pg||
nt|athene: it does look as though doubling 3@H helped NS though|pg||
nt|athene: gave madala more room to make a try|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult decision for madala|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would play on @D 33|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in positions similar to this, you might want to make the exotic play of ducking the first trick|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is you can draw trumps and keep control of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think that applied here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: he has virtually no defense to 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although looking at 3@d and 3@S you would guess puppet stayman |pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 3@c asks for 5M or 5422 shape|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart return he will test clubs and then maybe run the @DJ into north for a second avoidance play|pg||
nt|athene: still guarding those spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 3@d denies 5m4M|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they should put that on their CC for us poor old commentators :) |pg||
nt|athene: if the defence now play ace and a spade, of course declarer can afford to run the @DJ|pg||
nt|athene: @CQ would have saved a trick; now declarer can lead a heart to the queen then duck a heart and get a club pitch on the @HK|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: A @C lead will leave the lead in dummy  and -1; otherwise lead will go to hand and make - I predict|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: probably expected QJ10 in S, with the 9 in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i'm a bit surprised at versace showing the minors actually|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a 3nt raise to me|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: you mean declarer's natural play is to lead a small trump from whichever hand he finds himself in at trick 2?|pg||
nt|ady: swing could go either way|pg||
nt|athene: i think it is just about 50-50 to be honest|pg||
nt|athene: of course madala is not expecting the @CK to be onside|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's surely below 50%|pg||
nt|athene: he's wondering whether to overtake this, ruff the last heart, then play a small club |pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: oh well, at least he will be happy when he finds the bad break now - it means there is a chance 5@S can gain imps|pg||
nt|gsper:  The low @H showed even number without honor or odd with|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lets say well bid -no real idea if they were aware about possible @c slam -not this time ofcause |pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: the defence would then have time to set up a diamond trick but that might be ok|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but in hindsight N does not need so much to make a slam so 3@D better than my 4@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|runnerup:  i think you always make this but easyer now ofcause|pg||

nt|ady: was that 480    or 450|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: the lead gives declarer an easy ninth trick from diamonds but she would have been ok on a club lead anyway i guess - play spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: I have been given a link: http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psyck: ok, so NS play strong @c system, sry I came late did not realise|pg||
nt|athene: good play from bocchi; putting a lot of pressure on west if he has something like @HAxxx|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck: NS Leads are Slavinsky (standard count with an honour in the suit & reverse count without an honour).|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s8|nt|athene: he might worry that north has @HQJ doubleton so he might go in with the ace second time|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: and lo, it says 3C = asks 5-crd major or 5422, not used if just looking for 4-4 fit|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: interesting sort of squeeze here|pg||
nt|athene: if north throws a diamond declarer can't go wrong really|pg||
nt|athene: but if he throws a heart, south has to throw a spade, and then it becomes safe to take the diamond finesse anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm sorry that is not quite correct, as east will presumably throw a heart anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so then south can throw a heart and it is not quite safe to finesse diamonds through north|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that's what my copy of the CC says. Might be out-of-date of course|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: hard for east to know it was diamonds, not clubs, he should have been attacking|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: i would have thought 1nt was the obvious rebid there|pg||
nt|athene: getting your overall hand across|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: 4@D will only encourage camberos|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@C is ok, as long as partner doesn't think you have to have diamonds for it|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@H     but n/s may play 4@S   for -500|pg||
nt|gsper:  Par seems to be 6@DX|pg||
nt|psyck: only 2 red aces to lose in a @h contract|pg||
nt|psyck: since on @c lead, you can discard on @s & W cannot ruff profitably|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@H wins on @C lead aswell.|pg||
nt|gsper:  N probably has more defense than partner expects|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: EW might have 4@D, at this rate|pg||
nt|athene: obviously east thinks 4@D is forcing, though, which suggests he thinks it is a "new suit" i.e. 2@C does not guarantee any diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: but how to show it now (gazilli ?)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards lie remarkably badly |pg||
nt|athene: ok, i guess he did finesse, but of course makes anyway after no spade shift|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @h with 7 isn't everyones choice|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H opener gives east a much harder task|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 3nt by S|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: i assume the pause there was west thinking, not south|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C natural or various strong hands; 2@S less than 8 points|pg||
nt|athene: you might just bid 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|psyck: non vul, @h sequence, some shape & values on the side, a clear 3@h bid|pg||
nt|athene: no problem in 6@S of course with the miracle diamond lie so the 7 is good|pg||
nt|runnerup:  also in 5 . board 5 @c X -100 like expected -over 4 @h  =6 imps|pg||
nt|athene: but even if south had a higher diamond he would get squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|athene: unless it was diamond lead and diamond continuation after the trump, i suppose|pg||
nt|runnerup:  12 in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: making a slam is the best way to beer|pg||
nt|athene: yes, making a slam with the @D7 having squeezed someone is definitely a good beer|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: the EW misunderstanding here is a variation on a common theme:- when do you count a short minor opening as a "bid suit" and when not?|pg||
nt|sharkey: In the other room W opened a weak NT and East bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: if diamonds have been bid already, then 4@D is not forcing|pg||
nt|ady: good swing for Zaleski here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone for 3@D with four-card trump support?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if north opens 3 @h -what is east bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: I wonder what type hand West would bid 1 NT second time - may be conventional?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: running scores at http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: 2@h=maximum without majors or 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: in this auction where a suit agreed and we are past 4nt, i play 5NT is key card (probably i am alone :()|pg||
nt|fabsayc: alternatively 5NT should say he is interested in 7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: very scenic miht o overboard|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: I guess with three jacks it's a bit aggressive :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2nt was GF balanced, asking about minors; i assume 3@D showed five clubs|pg||
nt|athene: and south got mildly interested|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well as i said it is difficult - you might just bid 3nt |pg||
nt|psyck: same i suppose dbl planning 3N on 3M|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but if partner bid lets say 4 @c ?|pg||
nt|athene: you might double but that will often just give you a hard problem later on|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 4nt with @D lead can create big problems so better 5@C for NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: one can not develop both majors with @D lead so if @D lead doomed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: ok i'm told 3@D was a 5-card minor, 3@H asked, 3@S showed clubs|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jaapfr: i really miss why to lead @H as W|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: endplay coming up....draw trumps in 2, ruff the spade, exit diamond|pg||

pc|d2|nt|sharkey: Can duck this|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: yes, duck this looks simplest, then just draw trumps|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need to guess the hearts or anything|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@Sx by north in open room|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|athene: if you draw trumps you don't have a dummy entry, but when you lead the @H10, east has a tricky decision |pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: you might have started with @HA10 doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: now the double squeeze is pretty much marked|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: cash @CK, ruff a heart, and then run the trumps|pg||
nt|athene: and whoever has the diamonds will have to unguard them|pg||
nt|athene: not actually a double squeeze as only one person can guard them but that is how you play it|pg||
nt|psyck: well we don't get dealt such 24 everyday, so i don't like to just bid 3N, I will x & take my medicine on pd's rebid|pg||

pc|c7|pc|h5|pc|c5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: wondering whether to overtake and lead a club up|pg||
nt|athene: if you play low here and then another heart, east has to win and play a small diamond to give you a problem|pg||

nt|jdonn:  it looks like NS have 9 tricks on the fly here if they find them, which i think they will|pg||

mb|5C|nt|Babela: pero si el robot está lento no tiene chance|pg||
nt|ady: e/w should make 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry only 6-5 here of course|pg||
nt|athene: north was stuck; if he ducked at trick 1, hoping for a heart shift, declarer could win the ace immediately|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, after a similar start to the auction at the other table South did raise to 3@d :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dbl=both majors|pg||

nt|gsper:  And 2@S is not Muiderberg or something, but a constructive part of the system|pg||
nt|athene: well 6@C looks best here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @c +1  is easy ofcause |pg||
nt|athene: you can even make 7@C i suppose on the layout|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can S pass?? I doubt that he will|pg||
nt|athene: sure he can|pg||
nt|athene: well, he can if double is penalty|pg||
mb|5S|nt|bobholl: but vulnarable it is understandable the other one was nV|pg||
nt|runnerup:  110 available both ways -this -100 with best def|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H pass/correct invitational, by the look of it |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|athene: only @DA as an obvious loser, as you can throw a diamond on the @SK|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but if you draw trumps you only have 11 tricks with crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: i think north ought to be raising clubs if her partner can bid them twice|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, opposite vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt scramble now, perhaps|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW were thoroughly preempted out|pg||
nt|psyck: made it difficult for EW to enter at this vul|pg||
pc|c2|nt|runnerup:  not a good start for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 450 modest consolation|pg||
pc|h8|pc|cK|nt|ady: maybe a diamond lead would give problems|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead would certainly cause problems, but the club looks normal to me|pg||
nt|athene: even after a club lead, the defence might have a chance - suppose declarer wins the jack and returns a club; north can win and shift to a diamond now|pg||
nt|ady: even a club lead  may nopt make    diamond switch later may be ok for defence|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NS play a strong club system, i am guessing over 1@S a bid of 2@C is their only game force|pg||
nt|athene: after a club lead declarer can go for hearts immediately of course, but that looks risky with just a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: well when you only go for 500 with that dummy, i don't think you can be accused of rash bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: but it still costs an imp |pg||
nt|athene: maybe west comes under pressure, having to guard both majors, and you can ruff the @HK or @S10 good|pg||
nt|gsper:  A D by E risked 4 or 5@C from partner|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D was obviously something weird - maybe showed just a minimum hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: this lead stops 6|pg||
nt|runnerup:  under 6 @c you can stay with good justment|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cant|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: if declarer plays hearts early   should make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know if NS's agreement is that 2nt here is lebensohl or a scramble|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: in italy most doubles suggest a desire to compete further, even after the fit has been found|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that north does not unblock - you would think he would, as then either defender can win the third heart if need be|pg||
nt|athene: but even if you play it as scramble you can use it, like this, to show a weak 3@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: (direct 3@H bid is stronger)|pg||
nt|athene: of course if that is what the double meant then it is easy for south to bid on|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|athene: one possibility is to run the spades first - that often makes life hard for the defenders|pg||
nt|sharkey: He has to play on @H I think|pg||
nt|athene: i think versace might get trump squeezed|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: the trouble is, it might make things hard for you too - you have to find a couple of discards, and you also lose your dummy entries|pg||

nt|gsper:  No 10+ balanced|pg||
nt|athene: north decided that on the bidding, south can't have more than two hearts, and therefore must have three spades :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: 3@s 6+S, denies 3+H|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni does not have that many extras now i think|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C-then-3@S shows good spades and about 18+ or so|pg||
nt|athene: but it seems he is giving this a bit of thought|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkey: *view|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: then how about 1 spade?|pg||
nt|sharkey: i agree with 1@S |pg||

pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: i can hear the thunder now|pg||
nt|queequeg: yes you right :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|runnerup:  yes 2 @s is a clear bid -4 @s is -i cant say aloud --and 4 @h was overboard all ready|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: but south "bent" a 1nt call on board 1, 3, and 4|pg||
nt|athene: north must have noticed that|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose you might misguess spades twice, leading to the 8 then the jack?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h7|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|sharkey: Passing with North's hand first time just creates problems later on - as evidenced here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: i like this switch, add confusion to declarers thinking|pg||
nt|athene: so 2-2 in the majors is not beyond the realms of possibility|pg||

nt|mdgraham: the opening 3@C is a matter of style - the two aces and only a 6-card suit are negative factors, but you argue against that |pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, you can argue against that|pg||

nt|jdonn:  fun hand, both sides have a game|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it's very likely NS will take a push to 5S here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobh1: EW can make  n|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfj: Interesting 1N here|pg||
nt|jdonn:  north bids 2S, it looks kind of normal but I much prefer 1S since the defense is very good and it would be a great dummy for hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  you much prefer to preempt with a suit like KQJxxx than AT9xxx|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now south will bid 4S or maybe 4D, west will bid 5C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jdonn:  and everything pretty much rests on south taking the push to 5|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bobh1: transfer to @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  it sure looks right, but a lot of people are reluctant to bid 5 over 5|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if one of north's heart was in clubs NS might even make 5S, so it's hard to see not doing it|pg||
nt|jdonn:  also, suppose south wasnt planning to bid 5S on his own here, then he should have bid 4D instead of 4S so that north might bid 5S if it was right|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jdonn:  that way north would know to defend with short diamonds and bid with long diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  here it didnt matter a lot since south is always bidding on to 5|pg||
nt|jdonn:  we will see if east bids on to 6, i doubt it thought|pg||
nt|jdonn:  though|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  he will probably just defend with his strength opposite an opening hand and opponents having been pushed up, but you can never be sure|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the other table took a flyer at 6C, they didnt even get pushed there|pg||
nt|jdonn:  some days it's right, not today though|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|bobh1: S's response on air makes it tough for EW to find their game|pg||
nt|bobh1: same at the other table|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfj: Stark is not entirely sure about the bid here|pg||
nt|jdonn:  and east does the right thing this time|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jdonn:  so it's certainly down 1 with down 2 possible|pg||
nt|jdonn:  uh oh|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now if north guesses what is happening in diamonds he might make it|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|jdonn:  east wanted a heart ruff|pg||
pc|d6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|dQ|nt|jdonn:  so this does come down to how declarer plays the diamond suit|pg||
nt|jdonn:  and he has a real chance to go right, he will see east is 2-2 in the majors and probably has 5 clubs given west's bidding|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfj: Chip claimed, losing two diamonds and one club.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|jdonn:  but also declarer might not want to go for 500 but taking a deep finesse in diamonds, so it's a tough call|pg||
nt|jdonn:  there is a lot riding on this in such a close match|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if declarer is going to finesse for the jack he has to start doing it on the first round, leading to the king first isn't good enough|pg||
nt|jdonn:  then east's remaining AJ8 would prevent a third trick from developing|pg||

mb|1S|nt|jdonn:  that shows why it's right to bid more on such distributional hands, even when it's "wrong" it might have worked|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: now the segment even closer at bam scoring|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 14 mins left in round here, no director check in yet|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  here is a normal 13 and 13 3nt|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: i guess 4@H|pg||
nt|jdonn:  a spade lead will be very normal but not the best start for the defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: As some of the other tables finish up, it's getting a little noisy outside.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie is contemplating his bidding box.  On the other side of the screen, Bobby is running his fingers through his hair, rehashing a previous hand in his head.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Hopefully not enough to distract our heroes.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jdonn:  declarer will put in the 10 from dummy and be off to a good start|pg||
nt|jdonn:  3NT went down at the other table on a heart lead, north had risked a 1H overcall|pg||
nt|jdonn:  so there is a good chance of a swing here|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i was just asked why south would lead low instead of the queen from this holding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: NS play sort of upsidedown smith|pg||
nt|jdonn:  against notrump you want to develop the length in your suit so the honor is very valuable, if partner has a singleton or doubleton A K or T then if you start with low the suit won't be blocked|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if south had QJT or QJ9 he would risk the honor but anything worse than that low is more normal in notrump|pg||
nt|jdonn:  against a suit contract south would normally lead the queen, now as long as anyone has a doubleton you don't want to blow a fast trick|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i dont really see 3nt going down here as long as he puts in the 10 of spades|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jdonn:  even if he starts clubs with an honor, holding himself to 2 tricks there, he can get the last trick in hearts and the defense can't do anything|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: There is a lot of deep sighing and head-scratching going on.  It's been that kind of set.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jdonn:  he didn't put in the spade ten, very interesting|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfj: Not so much from Andy and Franco.  When things got rough, Franco ate a banana.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobh1: same auction in both rooms|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jdonn:  i'm not sure what east was playing for, QJ doubleton is unlikely so maybe north to make a mistake with something like Q8 doubleton?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jdonn:  however east has recovered by getting clubs right so now he can play on hearts and he is fine|pg||

nt|athene: was it possible south could have three diamonds though?|pg||
nt|athene: could he be 4-3-3-3 on that bidding?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand looks very interesting, two slams beaten by bad breaks|pg||
nt|athene: north might get endplayed in 3@C, for example heart lead ruffed, draw trumps, then play a spade|pg||
nt|athene: north will have to lead a spade or diamond|pg||
nt|jaapfr: needs @C lead to beat 4@H and 4@S doomed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: hopefully that's spades and a minor. If it's just spades.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@s would be a weak two in spades |pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: i dont believe this bidding|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|athene: east really bid 2@D? is this a 2-way bid, maybe weak spade raise or some strong options?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yy 5@H does make with @S @S lead kibs:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: maybe a better plan was to cash the @DA at trick 2, then return the heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice to see that even Fantunes can err occasionally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner started with @DKx he can cash the @DK before giving you the heart ruff, and you can give him a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no need to underlead your @DA trying to pick up @DQxx with declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt =dd and down in practive if no helping bids in defence (like here) perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so we see lauria's opinion of the tricky bidding problem for balanced 24 count after 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: might very well get the clubs right - we shall see|pg||
nt|athene: he doubled and basically forced to 6@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lucky 6 @s for bear card bid and made quite lucky|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West might have passed - six spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might deem it unsuitable for a weak two |pg||
nt|gsper:  E has a lot of cards but does not know where to go|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gsper:  And knows even less now|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would bid 3NT now and go down|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s maybe...|pg||
nt|athene: defence have to be slightly careful here to cash out the diamonds and not for example try to cash two hearts|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jaapfr: the systematic 2@D bid did S pass else he could bid and NS in a @H contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: i am told, on the NS methods, if south WAS 4333, he would be 18-20, so that was out|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i never see in table any one to finess @c -not expected here |pg||
nt|athene: west tries to conceal the position in clubs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gsper:  Opposite an overcall, Hedy?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kareno: 6 either major makes with spades friendly.|pg||
nt|athene: so the defence don't realise the urgency to cash out in diamonds|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bobholl: very good slam|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kickard, love it|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose 6@H is a bit better than 6@S because you might make it even with a bad spade break, but it's hard to get out of a 4-4 fit once you lock into it|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|kareno: Yes, diamonds might produce an extra trick.|pg||
nt|athene: so the underlead looks like a definite slip|pg||
nt|psyck: well, i did guess E would bid @s, just misguessed the number|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bobholl: no @S Q so 6 only|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if 2@S is 5/5, he knows W has diamonds - straw in the wind perhaps|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|jaapfr: but agustin did realize:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kareno: 5@h may show two without trump queen.|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should have taken control with blackwood over 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: normally you don't want the limited hand as captain|pg||
nt|athene: east just wants to know if her partner has @SAQ, @HA, @DA - then 7 is good|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno: There's no safety play in the spade suit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@c - so old hat these days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that could be a very expensive @d7 discard|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: west can never know if 7 is good because he does not know his partner has six solid hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @S2 to K and club finesse?|pg||
nt|gsper:  The voice commentators are criticizing 3@H, a bit unfairly I think|pg||
nt|gsper:  Considering the alternatives|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gsper:  3@H is not good, but what else is?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: some specs are suggesting that if west wants to give the impression he has no club honour in hand, the jack was a better card to play|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: that is usually what you would do, sure, but if you had a singleton club in hand you might try the king|pg||
pg||
qx|o29|st||md|3SJ87532HQ9DT5CQJ8,SHT874DAKQ943C542,SAQ4HKJ532DJ2CT93,SKT96HA6D876CAK76|sv|b|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jdonn:  south will probably make a light response here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Lloyd Arvedon is pacing outside.  |pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|min without maj or 4!S min/max|nt|Vugraphzfj: For the Bostonians in the room...|pg||
nt|jdonn:  at this vulnerabilty it's very effective to almost always respond to the opening bid, plus the fact the diamonds can be a short suit he doesn't want to play in 1D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Chip requests quieter bidding from the opponents, so that the opposite side of the screen cannot hear them pull the cards from the boxes.|pg||
mb|3C!|an|5/6!d and 4!h|nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie perusing Andy's convention card...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: More sighing...|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the raise to 2S is a bit weird, south could have passed 1S since he knows they don't have game values, now north might think he is good enough to bid again and get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  he is probably just trying to keep the opponents out, but he probably already had|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfj: For whomever asked earlier, the Rex Stout book that Chip is reading is "Three for the Chair."|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  and here we have it, this shows why passing 1S is a good idea once you know you don't belong in game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|jdonn:  and even worse|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jdonn:  lee holds hearts over the 1H response, and enough trumps and overall strength that he risks a double and it will pay off for him|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jdonn:  this is a great trump lead i think, partner probably has hearts to double here so if EW take out the trumps then NS will be very short on tricks|pg||
nt|jdonn:  since east has the minors locked up|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|jdonn:  that's another plus to the double, not only do you increase your score but you help partner make a good lead|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the other table shows exactly how i think the auction should have gone|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jdonn:  lee will win this diamond and play another trump, then win either a heart or a diamond overruff, declarer is just in big trouble here|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfj: Just disconnected briefly, have not missed anything.  Andy in the tank.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie consults the convention card again: "All right."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: There appears to be some sort of sighing contest between Bobby and Stevie.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "You're jack leads are standard, right?"|pg||

nt|queequeg: the auction was very interesting|pg||

nt|jaapfr: but much more work|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|athene: 3@D perhaps a slight underbid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: does E dare to bid 3nt now??|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D might end the auction now|pg||
nt|athene: east has some good news for 3nt (heart stop and two quick tricks on the side) but some very bad news (no diamond honour to help solidify the suit)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hard to show diamonds when partner opens precision 2@C, since all diamond bids are relays|pg||

pc|sA|nt|athene: i have to say west did not really have any obvious alternative to 3@D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: you could bid 2@H but that is usually going to force you to game so it's a bit much|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfj: There seems to be a misunderstanding about Lew's double.  Gu just asked Chip if it showed clubs, and Chip said yes.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: ... and we're caught up again, minus some of the pesky details.  Last board this set, hopefully the next will bring us better luck.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  the other table made 7 by sneaking the club over early|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|jdonn:  it pretty much will come down to north inviting slam and south accepting|pg||
nt|jdonn:  this 3D bid is weird with two ltitle diamonds and all the strength in the majors, i thought after 3C it would go 3NT 4NT 6NT or so|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now it comes down to agreements and style, but obviously north will move forward somehow|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|Vugraphzfj: At this point, I'm not sure I can reliably enter all the results for the preceding hands, so we may have to wait on the official score.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sol, the director, comes in to remind the players that they are in overtime.  Franco says yes, they know.|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it's not clear whether 4NT is rkc or a quantitative invite|pg||
nt|jdonn:  some partnerships would play 4nt is natural inviting slam, and if north wants to bid rkc for diamonds he has to set them as trumps by bidding 4d first|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jdonn:  even now it's not clear, if south is accepting the slam invitation he might just be showing a good heart suit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|jdonn:  it might also be showing keycards, some play that if you accept the slam invitation you show keycards anyway|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|jdonn:  south converts 6D to 6NT since he can't see much reason to play in diamonds, which makes you wonder why he bid 3D in the first place|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i think the reason was in case his partner could bid 3H he would want to play in 4H|pg||
nt|jdonn:  that is actually not unreasonable|pg||

nt|mdgraham: weird|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok --nonsence|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, E's hand could play very well opp fitting hands|pg||
nt|gsper:  3@C may be singleton ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think double is right|pg||
nt|gsper:  What on Earth is going on here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if they wake up and bid a cold 4@S you just hope that your teammate are in it anyway|pg||
nt|athene: now south might discover a diamond suit tucked away there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cc says 2@s=realy, but maybe that doesn't apply by a passed hand  |pg||
nt|athene: if partner asks you for non-spade suits and you have seven in one of them, you might want to bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s presumably some sort of fit-jump|pg||
nt|psyck: are we looking at the same boards :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  It is suggested that thay are playing board 29|pg||
nt|hedyg:  UNDO ?|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe the bidding is for board 29|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south is thinking how bad a dummy for diamonds his partner might put down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h-3@h might have bought it|pg||
nt|athene: i guess something like 2-4-3-4 shape is possible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: something maybe not quite right here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is not gonna make :) .heh heh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think W playing 3@d on a 3-2 fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a bright kib said better W bidding 2@H and then 3@H (for the ones who see 3@H as 5/5m)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: double 3@C looks normal with west but this will work out fine anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that might provoke 5@d|pg||
nt|athene: might be a problem now if north passes after a looong think, and south finds 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
nt|gsper:  But even then 3@D is not obvious|pg||
nt|psyck: if so 3@d @c single (with 3@h @d single & 3@s @s single)?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Quite possibly|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead you might well need five diamond tricks so small to the queen is right, isn't it? gains against @DKx onside or @Dxx as here|pg||
nt|athene: @DKx or @DKxx|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: even if North is known to have slow-passed, 5@d isn't unreasonable with 7411 shape|pg||

pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: but N has gone on anyway, so no problem|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: the down side of fit jumps is it also helps opponents to evaluate their fit|pg||
nt|psyck: if E found @c single , he did not want to try much beyond game...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: ok, so now you lay down the @DA|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|athene: west might duck a heart lead|pg||
nt|gsper:  We don't know how srong 2NT could have been|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h4|nt|psyck: yes, but if close to limit raise values, E can envisage a slam with right cards|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it would be interesting to know why East didn't simply raise hearts - but it might be a bit difficult to find out |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: when you can afford to lose one trick it's better to play the ace first because if you finesse the queen and lose to the king, you have a guess next time whether to play south for ...|pg||
nt|athene: singleton king or KJ doubleton|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: two rounds of diamonds for four down |pg||

nt|jdonn:  I'm talking to myself, plus all the comments from the spectators hitting me that I can't really reply to, those are like the voices in my head. So pretty much I feel like a crazy person|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  this last board seems like a straightforward 4S, but things might get a little interesting with trumps 5-0|pg||
nt|jdonn:  declarer can make it anyway although in practice it's very easy to go down|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jdonn:  2D here is some kind of heart raise, I think EW play transfers on this auction|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it looks like EW have at least 4 tricks, a club 2 diamonds and a trump|pg||
nt|jdonn:  but if declarer never plays trumps at all he can score 2 hearts, a club, and 7 trumps by ruffing back and forth|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  if he plays even one round then east can win a club and play a second round|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobh1: good decision to bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Kamil trying to figure out if he should bid...|pg||
nt|jdonn:  then it would be hard|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|an|gazzilli|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Again, the 10 is Rusinow.|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a good save|pg||
mb|2D!|an|relay|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: That's it for this session, thanks all for your patience!|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the risk of a ruff somewhere is probably greater than the risk of a 5-0 trump break plus both diamonds being off, i think it would be hard to blame declarer if he goes down here|pg||
nt|jbgood: same lead as in the OR|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|Vugraphzfj: Making a bad situation worse...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  this will be won by east who will probably switch to a heart|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bobh1: the ever popular trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  settnig up a trick if partner had KJ over declarer's queen|pg||
mb|3N|an|5!s332 15/19|nt|jbgood: a di switch at the other table..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  now declarer might play a diamond|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the less trumps he plays, the better|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|jdonn:  heart continuation|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jdonn:  or might west play more diamonds? it's not unthinkable but i think he will continue hearts|pg||
nt|jdonn:  he fooled me before though|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfj: Franco tells Andy, who had gone for a bathroom break and returned after the hand was played, that they made 3, but "that the club lead was important."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The bathroom is conveniently located in the same room.  We are in individual hotel rooms.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Short break here, I will need a CC from one of the players to update the scores before we can go on with our broadcast. Sho|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: *Short intermission :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jdonn:  and he has done it again by making the only play i didnt predict. maybe that was risky if declarer had a singleton club|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c3|pc|sJ|nt|jdonn:  now he might make it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: a short (10 min) break after bd 75..before the next segment|pg||
nt|jdonn:  declarer has done quite well to not play any trumps|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|jdonn:  he just has to avoid ruffing a diamond high and playing a high trump from dummy, then he won't get the last ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|jdonn:  trump to his hand now and he will make|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobh1: thx all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Thanks again all, and see you in a few minutes for the final set today.  These are two-day matches, so this continues for four more 15-board sets tomorrow.|pg||
nt|jdonn:  he should work it out, he knows the full EW shape at this point i believe|pg||

nt|gsper:  Low from 6 to honour would not be Slawinski|pg||
nt|athene: madala cashing the @DA first in here was a good play that made it a lot easier for his partner|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i smell a 5@C overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: West, under pressure, needs to act because his is the hand with distribution.|pg||
nt|gsper:  As 1@C shows only 2, not everybody plays 3@C as artificial|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: 6@C by north i suppose, maybe 5nt shows two suiter|pg||

nt|gsper:  The voice commentators discuss the sexiness of Ghestem vs Michaels|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: barry crane's laws apply, both of them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1. partner never has the right cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2. never bid a grand slam|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi might be contemplating 4nt here? heart lead, seven (!) diamonds, and lead a spade up for the tenth, just hoping the defence can't cash too many clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: Frankly I'm glad to be watching rather than having to make a bid with the north hand!|pg||
nt|lukiluke60: buonasera a tutti|pg||

nt|athene: 7 losers|pg||
nt|jaapfr: madala is quite young of age (30-40 i would say?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 20s i think|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: but he doesn't know that his singleton club is so suitable, facing such a weak suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: mucha concentraciòn en la mesa de juego.|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  i say nothing about that 14 (anymore)this is partscore only so defence gets +|pg||
nt|athene: 24, i'm told|pg||
nt|jaapfr: an Italian from Argentine or vv?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: that applies to the defense also, 6@D was going down|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: lets say could go down|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though the defence should have one trick in each suit here with no problems, but north is in danger of getting endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: so the spade shift was actually necessary|pg||
nt|psyck: going via an artificial 2@c bid to make an invitational raise|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psyck: I agree with Andy, Ghestem sounds sexier|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange i play 3@D 3@H 4@H as a slam try and a direct 4@D (or 4@C) as a "nothing bid|pg||
nt|athene: well, you could not ask for a kinder layout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes he has done - EW in big trouble now |pg||
nt|runnerup:  double for penalties -they exists|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps West might have bid 3@C- can then redouble for rescue to a red suit. Now he has to guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  angel=Angelini -west playing morsy perhaps |pg||
nt|mdgraham: surely Norht will pass - S did double 2NT. Any further doubles are surely for penalties |pg||
nt|runnerup:  what is he thinking|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder what Versace is thinking right now :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north Angelini |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: Ultimas 16 en los próximos 15 minutos.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok that i can understand|pg||
nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|jaapfr: strange XX|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: well, east may have made a mild slam try here, the same|pg||
nt|athene: both minors 3-3 with the key card onside|pg||
nt|athene: very tough; i guess you just have to pass as east|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if meant as SOS i can see|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: well i dont see it as a late bid except maybe for lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: partner could have redoubled but he bid 2@H, so he is not much interested in diamonds|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Al maestro carlos pellegrini se le volo el 10 de @S y lo puso como jugado, Se lo vio contento con la pasada del 10.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|athene: and the @SJ not likely to cause any trouble|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: on auctions like these a good mantra is to lead a trump|pg||
nt|runnerup:  last board but expensive -so quite pun after this i assume|pg||

nt|runnerup:  ok 10 +imps or so |pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DJ would have been good|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gsper:  4@S could even make on tired defence|pg||
nt|psyck: will get a beer this deal with @s loser going on @d & @d7 winning last trick?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the eldies became too tired|pg||

nt|athene: oh well, 1600 might not be that much worse than 800|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ic:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: how many off on @DJ at trick 1? Six?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  800 now and 1 slipped|pg||
