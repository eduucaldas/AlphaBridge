mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: the trouble with a splinter is you are not likely to get cooperation (ie. too strong)|pg||

nt|bobh1: N might have opened|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i suppose he could bid 5@H now, saying lots of controls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S effectively the same, except should usually be spade void|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: which might have saved a partscore swing|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: the other table you can see Stevie Weinstein playing for Fleisher.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i wonder if 4m is a splinter or fit-showing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: so he chooses to show a limit raise, usualy 4 trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2NT is explained as invitational with hearts.  In response to Chip's questions, David writes, "usually four."|pg||
nt|bobh1: he probably intends to bid 4@C even if jonathan declines, which i dont think he will|pg||

mb|4S|nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby commented afterwards that he should've flashed Andy his @HQ, perhaps he would've passed 4@H.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a little gamesmanship|pg||

mb|3S|nt|jdonn:  you much prefer to preempt with a suit like KQJxxx than AT9xxx|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now south will bid 4S or maybe 4D, west will bid 5C|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|nt|bobh1: transfer to @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  it sure looks right, but a lot of people are reluctant to bid 5 over 5|pg||

nt|jdonn:  also, suppose south wasnt planning to bid 5S on his own here, then he should have bid 4D instead of 4S so that north might bid 5S if it was right|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jdonn:  that way north would know to defend with short diamonds and bid with long diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  here it didnt matter a lot since south is always bidding on to 5|pg||

nt|jdonn:  if declarer is going to finesse for the jack he has to start doing it on the first round, leading to the king first isn't good enough|pg||

pc|c2|nt|bobh1: same auction in both rooms|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jdonn:  i'm not sure what east was playing for, QJ doubleton is unlikely so maybe north to make a mistake with something like Q8 doubleton?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jdonn:  however east has recovered by getting clubs right so now he can play on hearts and he is fine|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||

pc|sT|nt|ahollan1:  72  Demirev in 3N East on lead of @S2|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: For the Bostonians in the room...|pg||
nt|jdonn:  at this vulnerabilty it's very effective to almost always respond to the opening bid, plus the fact the diamonds can be a short suit he doesn't want to play in 1D|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfj: Chip requests quieter bidding from the opponents, so that the opposite side of the screen cannot hear them pull the cards from the boxes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie perusing Andy's convention card...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: More sighing...|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the raise to 2S is a bit weird, south could have passed 1S since he knows they don't have game values, now north might think he is good enough to bid again and get too high|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jdonn:  he is probably just trying to keep the opponents out, but he probably already had|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: For whomever asked earlier, the Rex Stout book that Chip is reading is "Three for the Chair."|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  and here we have it, this shows why passing 1S is a good idea once you know you don't belong in game|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  and even worse|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jdonn:  lee holds hearts over the 1H response, and enough trumps and overall strength that he risks a double and it will pay off for him|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jdonn:  this is a great trump lead i think, partner probably has hearts to double here so if EW take out the trumps then NS will be very short on tricks|pg||
nt|jdonn:  since east has the minors locked up|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jdonn:  that's another plus to the double, not only do you increase your score but you help partner make a good lead|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the other table shows exactly how i think the auction should have gone|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jdonn:  lee will win this diamond and play another trump, then win either a heart or a diamond overruff, declarer is just in big trouble here|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Just disconnected briefly, have not missed anything.  Andy in the tank.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie consults the convention card again: "All right."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: There appears to be some sort of sighing contest between Bobby and Stevie.  |pg||

nt|jdonn:  i see|pg||
nt|jdonn:  declarer can't really get to dummy for the club finesse|pg||
nt|jdonn:  and if he ever plays a diamond west can just throw a club|pg||
nt|jdonn:  so there is more than one way to skin a cat|pg||
nt|jdonn:  this will be 11 imps for lee, putting them on a big 44-4 run after the 0-18 start to this set|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: darn  correct quote from Monk:  a gift and a curse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Garner shows singleton @H  instead of @HK  huge difference for Weinstein|pg||
nt|jbgood: he might just put 6 NT on the table - having found out that prd has 5 hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: (and that they lack one ace)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their  System Summary form doesn't talk about response structure to 1N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Garner studying his cards and making faces :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|6N|nt|ahollan1: 4@H = shortness  or  6N = slam try???|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: slam try it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: the practical way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: HW explains (verbally since auction over) that 3@d showed both minors, at least 4-4 and 3NT said no interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 72  10 more imps to Lee   who's 4 pickups have been  6, 10, 7, 10|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Kit: "he could be 4-4" HW: "in theory he could bid 4@s over 1N to show 4-4 with a 4N bid, but his leaves more space"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Kit: "could he show shortness?" HW: "yes, but gets complicated"|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfb: Garner put dummy down with diamonds first, then clubs, then hearts and before he put the rest down said "and the AKQ of spades"|pg||

nt|jdonn:  so here we have a slam for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  it would be most straightforward in notrump, though if they stumble into a red suit they will be fine|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: There seems to be a misunderstanding about Lew's double.  Gu just asked Chip if it showed clubs, and Chip said yes.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Vugraphzfj: Chip had pulled 2@H out of the box, then changed his mind and tried 2@D.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzfj: Shi wrote something about 3@C, but sadly my eyesight does not extend so far.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: ... and we're caught up again, minus some of the pesky details.  Last board this set, hopefully the next will bring us better luck.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  the other table made 7 by sneaking the club over early|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  it pretty much will come down to north inviting slam and south accepting|pg||
nt|jdonn:  this 3D bid is weird with two ltitle diamonds and all the strength in the majors, i thought after 3C it would go 3NT 4NT 6NT or so|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now it comes down to agreements and style, but obviously north will move forward somehow|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: At this point, I'm not sure I can reliably enter all the results for the preceding hands, so we may have to wait on the official score.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sol, the director, comes in to remind the players that they are in overtime.  Franco says yes, they know.|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it's not clear whether 4NT is rkc or a quantitative invite|pg||
nt|jdonn:  some partnerships would play 4nt is natural inviting slam, and if north wants to bid rkc for diamonds he has to set them as trumps by bidding 4d first|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  even now it's not clear, if south is accepting the slam invitation he might just be showing a good heart suit|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  it might also be showing keycards, some play that if you accept the slam invitation you show keycards anyway|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  south converts 6D to 6NT since he can't see much reason to play in diamonds, which makes you wonder why he bid 3D in the first place|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i think the reason was in case his partner could bid 3H he would want to play in 4H|pg||
nt|jdonn:  that is actually not unreasonable|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jdonn:  lee goes for the glory on lead but today it just leads to a push|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jdonn:  if dummy had KJ of clubs it was the only card in his hand to give him a chance to set|pg||

mb|d|nt|jdonn:  this last board seems like a straightforward 4S, but things might get a little interesting with trumps 5-0|pg||
nt|jdonn:  declarer can make it anyway although in practice it's very easy to go down|pg||
mb|2D|an|raise to 2H|nt|jdonn:  2D here is some kind of heart raise, I think EW play transfers on this auction|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it looks like EW have at least 4 tricks, a club 2 diamonds and a trump|pg||
nt|jdonn:  but if declarer never plays trumps at all he can score 2 hearts, a club, and 7 trumps by ruffing back and forth|pg||
mb|2S|an|4|nt|jdonn:  if he plays even one round then east can win a club and play a second round|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: good decision to bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Kamil trying to figure out if he should bid...|pg||
nt|jdonn:  then it would be hard|pg||

nt|bobh1: this is a good save|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|Vugraphzfj: That's it for this session, thanks all for your patience!|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the risk of a ruff somewhere is probably greater than the risk of a 5-0 trump break plus both diamonds being off, i think it would be hard to blame declarer if he goes down here|pg||
nt|jbgood: same lead as in the OR|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphzfj: Making a bad situation worse...|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
