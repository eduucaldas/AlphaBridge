nt|Vugraphzfj: Levin: "My best chance was if he underled the AK of hearts, but it's SO EARLY."|pg||
nt|bobh1: trump lead backfired on David|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Lew conceded a heart, and we're onto the next.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: (And there is light in here!  Thank you to the hotel engineer, who showed up with a powerful generator...)|pg||
nt|joest: obviously he thought the value of 'learning' who had the heart king exceeded the % of stiff queen with garner|pg||
mb|1C|an|2+|nt|joest: 1@c = 2+|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfj: I intended making 5, not sure if that is what shows up for everyone.|pg||
mb|1D|an|4+ H|nt|joest: the nonvulnerable 4333 takeout double.  Something increasing in popularity over the last few years|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d = hearts|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Not a very friendly for either side declaring here|pg||
nt|joest: everybody upgrades 19 HCP to 20 these days.  They started out with 2NT on the east cards in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: there are various interesting structures running around about how to respond here to a takeout double after RHO has acted.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: Garner will double|pg||
mb|d|an|3H|nt|joest: to show three hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the trouble with a splinter is you are not likely to get cooperation (ie. too strong)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so now has to continue in some way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: He's rubbing his hands over his eyes and sighing.  So early for so much angst.|pg||
nt|bobh1: N might have opened|pg||
nt|joest: and Weinstein beats a fast retreat|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: i suppose he could bid 5@H now, saying lots of controls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S effectively the same, except should usually be spade void|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bobh1: which might have saved a partscore swing|pg||
nt|joest: now Garner must show extras and its not clear how|pg||
nt|joest: he might try 2NT (assuming that is natural)|pg||
nt|joest: or double (which is just a general good hand but not spades this good)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: really the hand depends on club holding, which is now revealed|pg||
mb|3H|nt|joest: 3@h is way too commital.  He doesn't know if Weinstein has five hearts.  2@h might have been a bid from desperation|pg||
nt|joest: 3@h is definitely a bid from desperation!  :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: no i guess u want to defend on this deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Jonathan brings the @D5 closest to thumb, then puts it back and goes with @HK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Very different auction than at the other table...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie confirms that 3@S was a splinter and 4@S was a cue.|pg||
nt|joest: this might (will) make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota: E/W did fair in the other room in declaring hearts to come home with 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfj: Carding asked, Stevie explains that the play suit preference usually at trick 1, otherwise standard count|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|leo lasota: small diamond helpful for E/W|pg||
nt|joest: so now they can cash their spade before it goes away but that means declarer gets two pitches on the spade and the diamond|pg||

nt|leo lasota: unlucky opening lead, but very well played by weinstein|pg||
nt|joest: yes.  he had to lead a low club or somehow work out to lead the queen or ten of diamonds : somewhat double dummy|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobh1: so weinstein gets a few back|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: a standard problem for north|pg||
nt|joest: do you stayman or not?|pg||
nt|joest: Demiriev did at the other table|pg||
nt|leo lasota: good save in open room against 4h|pg||
mb|2C|an|puppet|nt|bobh1: N's hand doesn't fit into the usual parameters|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: It has been pointed out by several observers that the two Weinsteins make this a little hard to follow... we are watching Jonathan Weinstein, the captain of the Weinstein team.  At ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: the other table you can see Stevie Weinstein playing for Fleisher.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i wonder if 4m is a splinter or fit-showing?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobh1: so he chooses to show a limit raise, usualy 4 trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2NT is explained as invitational with hearts.  In response to Chip's questions, David writes, "usually four."|pg||
nt|bobh1: he probably intends to bid 4@C even if jonathan declines, which i dont think he will|pg||
nt|bobh1: most pairs play some kind of bromad after the double|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby commented afterwards that he should've flashed Andy his @HQ, perhaps he would've passed 4@H.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a little gamesmanship|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: But he didn't know that he should flash it to Andy instead of Franco.  Franco then launched into an explanation of the "fishhead coup," which it seems we can expect to see on ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Bridgewinners soon...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: S asking about 2@s bid now... can't read the answer but obviously liked it |pg||
nt|joest: Over a puppet call you have no inference partner has even four hearts so you're constrained to pass as south|pg||
nt|joest: now in your partnerships is double: (a) I have four spades or (b) takeout?  :)|pg||
mb|3D|an|5D, nothing about Hs?|nt|fabsayc: interesting decision to pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie: "Good thing it's only a 15-board segment."|pg||
nt|joest: I think 2NT is kind of practical here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Steve/Peter have reasonable methods for handling competition with their puppet auctions|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d seems like he has put the hand into game force mode to me but obviously I don't know |pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: two rounds of hearts and three of spades for down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby confirms that they play upside-down count and attitude at trick 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gu gesticulating somewhat wildly with his hands to explain to Chip the meaning of 2@S.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Looks like the message was conveyed.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: N trying to figure out what the right answer is...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Andy pauses, Bobby apologizes for playing too fast.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 3@s is a bold bid|pg||
nt|joest: motivated by the colors no doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: motivated by the colors and the extra shape of 64 in the black suits|pg||
nt|joest: well so far their methods have not gotten them to mentions hearts.  |pg||
pc|dK|nt|leo lasota: well done|pg||
nt|joest: highway robbery|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzfj: Gu asks about leads: 4th|pg||
nt|leo lasota: appears peter maybe should have taken a call over 3s |pg||
nt|joest: perhaps he thought pass was forcing.  Or perhaps he should just hit it with AQx of spades and take at least some plus|pg||
nt|joest: in 'standard' it might just go stayman, 2@s, 3@h on the assumption partner has four hearts, and then 4@h|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I believe that dbl by robinson after 1nt-p-2c-2s-p-p- would have shown dblton spade|pg||
nt|joest: a good agreement.   Wonder what 2Nt would have been.  In any event, this is not an auction you see every day and even the best of pairs might not see it eye-to-eye|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Apologies for the interruption, looks like there are too many interested viewers for our poor servers.  Luckily, not much missed: Franco has been thinking about this trick for ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: about five minutes.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i see we have not missed much|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the key here is to play spades so north does not imply a heart doubleton|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart queen an automatic false card from Qxx|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: probably strongest was for Robinson to voertake the diamond and play a trump through.  Not the easiest play though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphzfj: ... and we're caught up.  As you may know if you've been following this afternoon, our connection has been sketchy at best.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|leo lasota: looking at 2 small clubs and 3 trumps in dummy, diamond overtake for trump switch was very logical|pg||
nt|joest: well that would have gotten +100.  they are still headed for +50|pg||
nt|leo lasota: rather than ruff club right away, correct play here is ace and a heart to setup queen before ruffing club|pg||

nt|joest: not so clear to get there|pg||
mb|2C|nt|joest: do you play that a one of a major call here is forcing?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: NF constructive|pg||
nt|joest: I play it 100% forcing|pg||
nt|joest: rightly or wrongly it solves a lot of problems|pg||
mb|2N|an|good-bad|nt|joest: 2NT = "good/bad"  "I am just competing in clubs"|pg||
nt|joest: now it will be difficult to find the spade suit at all|pg||
nt|joest: and to me this goes back to the failure (or inability) to bid 1@son the first round|pg||
nt|joest: but they might recover.  Let's see|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bobh1: if declarer can avoid 3 trump losers he can make 4@S|pg||
nt|jdonn:  east's 1nt bid instead of double is surely influenced by the fact that north didn't really promise diamonds apparantly|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it looks like NS have 9 tricks on the fly here if they find them, which i think they will|pg||
nt|jdonn:  north may have to think about it, the 6 of hearts could be low from a better holding. but i still think he finds the diamond switch|pg||
mb|d|nt|leo lasota: Peetr had the option of bidding 1S last time, but chose to show the 3 card LR in diamonds instead|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|leo lasota: back to Steve's first bid|pg||
nt|joest: but bidding 1@s doesn't preclude finding diamonds.  Bidding 2@c makes it harder to find spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: with solid opening bid, honor 3rd of both majors, dbl with 3361 was reasonable alternative to 1D|pg||
nt|joest: just my opinion though.  Many others disagree|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Jan Martel, who makes the Vugraph happen, has given me an alternative wireless network to try if we get disconnected again.  So the next shutdown (which hopefully will not happen) ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: will be longer if it does.  Sorry again for all the interruptions...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Shi asks Lew how weak their style can be.  Lew says usually six, can be five if something else to go with it.|pg||
nt|joest: Doubling three clubs here should be an option to save. I don't think you double to hear your own voice|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzfj: "Good luck."  "Thank you."|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Another swing here one way or another... looks down on the lead|pg||

nt|joest: garner needs to hop ace and switch to a heart to hold this to 4|pg||
nt|leo lasota: y|pg||

mb|1C|nt|Vugraphzfj: Interesting 1N here|pg||
nt|jdonn:  north bids 2S, it looks kind of normal but I much prefer 1S since the defense is very good and it would be a great dummy for hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  you much prefer to preempt with a suit like KQJxxx than AT9xxx|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now south will bid 4S or maybe 4D, west will bid 5C|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|an|17-19|nt|bobh1: transfer to @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  it sure looks right, but a lot of people are reluctant to bid 5 over 5|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if one of north's heart was in clubs NS might even make 5S, so it's hard to see not doing it|pg||
nt|jdonn:  also, suppose south wasnt planning to bid 5S on his own here, then he should have bid 4D instead of 4S so that north might bid 5S if it was right|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jdonn:  that way north would know to defend with short diamonds and bid with long diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  here it didnt matter a lot since south is always bidding on to 5|pg||
nt|jdonn:  we will see if east bids on to 6, i doubt it thought|pg||

mb|p|nt|jdonn:  he will probably just defend with his strength opposite an opening hand and opponents having been pushed up, but you can never be sure|pg||

nt|leo lasota: diamond to ten only gains on KQ both in peter hand or honor x|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|jdonn:  so this does come down to how declarer plays the diamond suit|pg||

pc|s4|nt|jdonn:  but also declarer might not want to go for 500 but taking a deep finesse in diamonds, so it's a tough call|pg||
nt|jdonn:  there is a lot riding on this in such a close match|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if declarer is going to finesse for the jack he has to start doing it on the first round, leading to the king first isn't good enough|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Hopefully not enough to distract our heroes.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jdonn:  declarer will put in the 10 from dummy and be off to a good start|pg||
nt|jdonn:  3NT went down at the other table on a heart lead, north had risked a 1H overcall|pg||
nt|jdonn:  so there is a good chance of a swing here|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i was just asked why south would lead low instead of the queen from this holding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: NS play sort of upsidedown smith|pg||
nt|jdonn:  against notrump you want to develop the length in your suit so the honor is very valuable, if partner has a singleton or doubleton A K or T then if you start with low the suit won't be blocked|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if south had QJT or QJ9 he would risk the honor but anything worse than that low is more normal in notrump|pg||
nt|jdonn:  against a suit contract south would normally lead the queen, now as long as anyone has a doubleton you don't want to blow a fast trick|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i dont really see 3nt going down here as long as he puts in the 10 of spades|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter has 3 keys plus q |pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  even if he starts clubs with an honor, holding himself to 2 tricks there, he can get the last trick in hearts and the defense can't do anything|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but he already showed his extras with 2nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 10 spades my choice against 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: There is a lot of deep sighing and head-scratching going on.  It's been that kind of set.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jdonn:  he didn't put in the spade ten, very interesting|pg||
nt|joest: well for starters, it's not clear Boyd will read this as being from shortness and recognize Garner as the danger hand|pg||
nt|joest: seems to me Boyd needs to guess quite well to roll this in|pg||
nt|leo lasota: reason 10 spades may be better; give south Kx spades and north J9x|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfj: Not so much from Andy and Franco.  When things got rough, Franco ate a banana.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
nt|joest: now Garner-Weinstein play Rusinow so this is already somewhat odd|pg||
nt|joest: with the appearance of the king in dummy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobh1: same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|leo lasota: right; 3 card or less|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jdonn:  i'm not sure what east was playing for, QJ doubleton is unlikely so maybe north to make a mistake with something like Q8 doubleton?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jdonn:  however east has recovered by getting clubs right so now he can play on hearts and he is fine|pg||
nt|joest: garner cannot afford to cover this|pg||
nt|leo lasota: still just 8|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 3 d, 2c, 2s, 1h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: a cover leads to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: good play|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jdonn:  he played south to lead from 98 of spades instead of QJ of spades i guess, very weird on the 2 lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota: easy duck|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|leo lasota: unlucky for peter; veryreasonable line he took|pg||

mb|2D|an|one Maj|nt|Vugraphzfj: Lloyd Arvedon is pacing outside.  |pg||
nt|leo lasota: 3334 8 counts not very promising; especially white all, so peter may just pass|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|joest: or then again he might not|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: For the Bostonians in the room...|pg||
nt|jdonn:  at this vulnerabilty it's very effective to almost always respond to the opening bid, plus the fact the diamonds can be a short suit he doesn't want to play in 1D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Chip requests quieter bidding from the opponents, so that the opposite side of the screen cannot hear them pull the cards from the boxes.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie perusing Andy's convention card...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: More sighing...|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the raise to 2S is a bit weird, south could have passed 1S since he knows they don't have game values, now north might think he is good enough to bid again and get too high|pg||
nt|leo lasota: or peter may just have his aggressive nature for today :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: J - Rus|pg||
nt|joest: i see only 8 tricks at the moment|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 8 is the limit, especially with garner holding 2 entries in hearts|pg||
nt|joest: his legit line is to win in hand and play two clubs up, hoping for diamond in the slot|pg||
nt|joest: or at least that is a simple line|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jdonn:  he is probably just trying to keep the opponents out, but he probably already had|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfj: For whomever asked earlier, the Rex Stout book that Chip is reading is "Three for the Chair."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: should definitely win trick 1 in hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota: rule of 7 applicable in deciding whetehr % is to duck or win|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jdonn:  and here we have it, this shows why passing 1S is a good idea once you know you don't belong in game|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jdonn:  and even worse|pg||
nt|leo lasota: when protectign against 52 break|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jdonn:  lee holds hearts over the 1H response, and enough trumps and overall strength that he risks a double and it will pay off for him|pg||
nt|leo lasota: however, suit was marked 61 on auction|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jdonn:  this is a great trump lead i think, partner probably has hearts to double here so if EW take out the trumps then NS will be very short on tricks|pg||
nt|jdonn:  since east has the minors locked up|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|leo lasota: fairly lucky to escape with 8 tricks her with the Qxx diamonds|pg||
nt|leo lasota: even though it is true he would have had 9 with same diamond holding plus the ace club onside|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jdonn:  that's another plus to the double, not only do you increase your score but you help partner make a good lead|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the other table shows exactly how i think the auction should have gone|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jdonn:  lee will win this diamond and play another trump, then win either a heart or a diamond overruff, declarer is just in big trouble here|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Just disconnected briefly, have not missed anything.  Andy in the tank.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie consults the convention card again: "All right."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: There appears to be some sort of sighing contest between Bobby and Stevie.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "You're jack leads are standard, right?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "Yep."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "He DID lead the jack, right?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "I don't remember."|pg||

pc|h6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||

nt|jdonn:  i see|pg||
nt|jdonn:  declarer can't really get to dummy for the club finesse|pg||
nt|jdonn:  and if he ever plays a diamond west can just throw a club|pg||
nt|jdonn:  so there is more than one way to skin a cat|pg||
nt|jdonn:  this will be 11 imps for lee, putting them on a big 44-4 run after the 0-18 start to this set|pg||

mb|2H|nt|jdonn:  it would be most straightforward in notrump, though if they stumble into a red suit they will be fine|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzfj: There seems to be a misunderstanding about Lew's double.  Gu just asked Chip if it showed clubs, and Chip said yes.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: in about 1  hr|pg||
nt|joest: now B-R may well play some form of 'serious 3NT" here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: a little surprised robinson did not make 4h "fast arrival"|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Chip had pulled 2@H out of the box, then changed his mind and tried 2@D.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Shi wrote something about 3@C, but sadly my eyesight does not extend so far.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: ... and we're caught up again, minus some of the pesky details.  Last board this set, hopefully the next will bring us better luck.|pg||
nt|joest: some play that denies side suit controls|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2H was GF, promising 5+|pg||
nt|leo lasota: the fats arrival 100% denies 4 controls|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jdonn:  the other table made 7 by sneaking the club over early|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: fast|pg||
nt|joest: depending on if they play 'serious 3NT", then 4@c is a very constructive slam try|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 3nt would have been non serious slam try; 4C was serious|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 4h rejects|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  it pretty much will come down to north inviting slam and south accepting|pg||
nt|jdonn:  this 3D bid is weird with two ltitle diamonds and all the strength in the majors, i thought after 3C it would go 3NT 4NT 6NT or so|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now it comes down to agreements and style, but obviously north will move forward somehow|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: some pairs play that it's so constructive north would be compelled to Q the diamond king here|pg||
nt|joest: anyway they arrive in the right spot; now make it!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Vugraphzfj: At this point, I'm not sure I can reliably enter all the results for the preceding hands, so we may have to wait on the official score.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sol, the director, comes in to remind the players that they are in overtime.  Franco says yes, they know.|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it's not clear whether 4NT is rkc or a quantitative invite|pg||
nt|jdonn:  some partnerships would play 4nt is natural inviting slam, and if north wants to bid rkc for diamonds he has to set them as trumps by bidding 4d first|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|jdonn:  even now it's not clear, if south is accepting the slam invitation he might just be showing a good heart suit|pg||
nt|joest: well that lead won't make it harder|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|leo lasota: quick push here at 450 likely|pg||
nt|leo lasota: playing imps, lead low trump out of hand here is reasonable|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jdonn:  it might also be showing keycards, some play that if you accept the slam invitation you show keycards anyway|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|leo lasota: exactly|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
mc|11|nt|jdonn:  south converts 6D to 6NT since he can't see much reason to play in diamonds, which makes you wonder why he bid 3D in the first place|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i think the reason was in case his partner could bid 3H he would want to play in 4H|pg||
nt|jdonn:  that is actually not unreasonable|pg||

nt|jdonn:  I'm talking to myself, plus all the comments from the spectators hitting me that I can't really reply to, those are like the voices in my head. So pretty much I feel like a crazy person|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jdonn:  this last board seems like a straightforward 4S, but things might get a little interesting with trumps 5-0|pg||
nt|jdonn:  declarer can make it anyway although in practice it's very easy to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  2D here is some kind of heart raise, I think EW play transfers on this auction|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it looks like EW have at least 4 tricks, a club 2 diamonds and a trump|pg||
nt|jdonn:  but if declarer never plays trumps at all he can score 2 hearts, a club, and 7 trumps by ruffing back and forth|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jdonn:  if he plays even one round then east can win a club and play a second round|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: good decision to bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Kamil trying to figure out if he should bid...|pg||

pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfj: That's it for this session, thanks all for your patience!|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the risk of a ruff somewhere is probably greater than the risk of a 5-0 trump break plus both diamonds being off, i think it would be hard to blame declarer if he goes down here|pg||
nt|jbgood: same lead as in the OR|pg||
