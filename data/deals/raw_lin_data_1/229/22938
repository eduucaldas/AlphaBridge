nt|fabsayc: so 1nt-2c- 2d-3nt was proper auction|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: balance by north pushes  e/w overboard|pg||

nt|sharkey: we shall never know....|pg||
nt|athene: i think he can be sure that east has short clubs, but even so, bidding 6 is not so easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: probably EW will get a free run in the other room, so then it is a matter of east's rebid after 1@D 1@H|pg||

pc|h6|nt|athene: no chance here of course|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you just play spades and accept two down|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: yes - but neither N nor S can x|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: with the @H lead surely|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a double for takeout by north if available would have worked well|pg||
nt|queequeg: welcome Bob :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: the 4@S bid at the other table was perhaps unwise, left east guessing whose hand it was|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|athene: is declarer going to cash the @CAK then try a spade to hand, hoping if that holds, to play a club throwing the @HA?|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's not a bad plan :)|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes that sort of thing is useful but here even if it worked, it would not help especially|pg||
nt|athene: even if clubs break you get 2 hearts, 4 clubs, spade...that's not 3NT by a fair way|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@D=majors|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  should make on the lay|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: maybe can block the diamonds and survive|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i prefer 2@C for that purpose, as partner can bid 2@D with no preference|pg||
nt|athene: interesting, he doesn't go 4@H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: the problem with opening 4@H is that if opps bid 4@S or 5@C over it, as they very likely will, you are left not knowing what to do|pg||
nt|athene: you would probably be tempted to bid 5@D as partner will never imagine what you have|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Assume 2@S constructive - surprised S didnt make an advance towards game|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: there's a saying : 65 come alive how about 75 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: however, the way it has gone, he has hardly shown his hand either|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: this auction would show extras for me, and for sure that double was penalty|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|athene: maybe if the auction had tempoed out differently he would have bid - for example if west made some raise and then east bid 4@S and that was passed round to him|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps being NV was a factor|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h2|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another problem on defense for west, succeeds if he clears the spades, but also must unguard the diamonds later|pg||
nt|athene: but as it went, bidding 5@D in front of his partner is a bit of a gamble|pg||
nt|athene: of course, passing is a big gamble too|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  making n/s   but an excellent save for e/w in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know the intricacies of the NS methods but i suspect 2nt showed extras|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sharkey: think 3@S max|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: not sure e/w will be able to enter the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if north bid only 2@S and east doubled, that would find the club fit, but that is surely the only way|pg||
nt|athene: and i think north will bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  4 losers in spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: But NS likely will end up in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: the only way 4@S makes is if the defence don't attack diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to bid it - S will decline any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: but that's not happening|pg||
nt|athene: i think north just bids 3@S here and they play there|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree William|pg||
nt|ady: will east enter if north raises to 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@C also possibility - Splinter|pg||
nt|athene: i would probably double 2@S with the east cards|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|athene: now a support double for spades i guess, so they find their 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sharkey: N has a shortage of points but great playing strength when pd bid @S|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt was a spade raise you would think south would bid a discouraging 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i think support doubles are not as popular in italy as in america, but still if you double 1@H with 4+ spades here you surely need them|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: still will easy enough for defence to collect their 4 winners  |pg||
nt|athene: ok, the fifth spade is nice, and QJ doubleton is much better when partner opens the suit, but even so...|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i'm told 2NT is 6-4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|athene: so 3@H was just attempting to sign off|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: very complicated hand, but at least the lead reveals south has no natural lead|pg||

nt|sharkey: *it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: west might go very quietly here, given the vulnerability here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: south had made a great lead, and should have known every card at the end|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S-1 on hand 4 cost 12 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|athene: perfect mesh here - singleton facing four small - let's see if they can identify it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to locate @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows some sort of good raise and *south* shows extras and a heart singleton, that will certainly do it|pg||
nt|athene: well, with a ten-card fit you don't usually count the queen of trumps as a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: always difficult to rerach a normal 4@S after weak NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: only problem 6@S n/s  is the 3-0 trump split    needs to guess which way to play trumps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Any bidding by EW cud assist declarer in locating the Q|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|nt|sharkey: 3@D some kind of @S raise - and W didnt x - he'll be on lead anyway|pg||
nt|sharkey: x 3@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: they seem to have no problem|pg||
mb|r|nt|ady: this is where west showing a 2 suiter might give the distribution away     vulnerability was against west entering|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: even when the opponents are silent you can sometimes use that to help find the Qxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: by asking "which defender would be more likely to bid if he DID have a spade void?"|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: i wonder if east had super-accepted, whether south would have bid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: he might well have done, as the super-accept would mark his partner with a singleton heart, so that is pretty good news |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: but at this vulnerability, that line of thought does not really help so much, because even with a lot of shape, the opponents are not going to be bidding|pg||
nt|ady: in my opinion that would not be a reasonable question to ask |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am very surprised east did not take another bid|pg||
nt|athene: it does look as though doubling 3@H helped NS though|pg||
nt|athene: gave madala more room to make a try|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult decision for madala|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would play on @D 33|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in positions similar to this, you might want to make the exotic play of ducking the first trick|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is you can draw trumps and keep control of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think that applied here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: he has virtually no defense to 2@H|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s6|nt|sharkey: A @C lead will leave the lead in dummy  and -1; otherwise lead will go to hand and make - I predict|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|athene: you mean declarer's natural play is to lead a small trump from whichever hand he finds himself in at trick 2?|pg||
nt|ady: swing could go either way|pg||
nt|athene: i think it is just about 50-50 to be honest|pg||
nt|athene: of course madala is not expecting the @CK to be onside|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's surely below 50%|pg||
nt|athene: he's wondering whether to overtake this, ruff the last heart, then play a small club |pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: oh well, at least he will be happy when he finds the bad break now - it means there is a chance 5@S can gain imps|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: EW might have 4@D, at this rate|pg||

nt|bobholl: but how to show it now (gazilli ?)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: i assume the pause there was west thinking, not south|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C natural or various strong hands; 2@S less than 8 points|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: the EW misunderstanding here is a variation on a common theme:- when do you count a short minor opening as a "bid suit" and when not?|pg||
nt|sharkey: In the other room W opened a weak NT and East bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: if diamonds have been bid already, then 4@D is not forcing|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|ady: maybe a diamond lead would give problems|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead would certainly cause problems, but the club looks normal to me|pg||
nt|athene: even after a club lead, the defence might have a chance - suppose declarer wins the jack and returns a club; north can win and shift to a diamond now|pg||
nt|ady: even a club lead  may nopt make    diamond switch later may be ok for defence|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NS play a strong club system, i am guessing over 1@S a bid of 2@C is their only game force|pg||
nt|athene: after a club lead declarer can go for hearts immediately of course, but that looks risky with just a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: well when you only go for 500 with that dummy, i don't think you can be accused of rash bidding|pg||

nt|athene: interesting that north does not unblock - you would think he would, as then either defender can win the third heart if need be|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|athene: one possibility is to run the spades first - that often makes life hard for the defenders|pg||
nt|sharkey: He has to play on @H I think|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: the trouble is, it might make things hard for you too - you have to find a couple of discards, and you also lose your dummy entries|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: if this holds the trick, what does declarer do next?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume play @C to the A and @C up.  @D A has to be in front|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is fairly sure now that north has the @HA, which makes it safer to play another heart, as north is probably not going to be the one with long hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no way the defence can set themselves up some long hearts|pg||
