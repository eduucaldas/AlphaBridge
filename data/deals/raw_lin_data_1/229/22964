mb|5S!|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Levin is in the think tank|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: he has taken his glasses off|pg||
nt|rain:  Added a commentator - old partner of stark, sometimes partner of weinstein and occasional teammate of jiang gu - welcome winkle :p|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: now he is the think man pose|pg||
nt|rain:  btw i meant jonathan weinstein. |pg||
nt|winkle:  hi :)|pg||
nt|winkle:  clubs play at least one trick better than spades, but hard to get to it on this auction|pg||
nt|winkle:  6@S would not even make on a club lead, but 7@C can be made if declarer picks up spades.|pg||
nt|roghog:  //usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=939&pid=288 for EW system|pg||
nt|winkle:  i have no idea what 5@S is.  assuming they play some form of dopi, 3rd step might be showing even key cards plus a void.|pg||
nt|roghog:  http://usbf.org/docs/2012usbc/acblcards/LevinWeinstein.gif detailed NS CC. (thanks, Dave)|pg||
nt|winkle:  double=1st step, pass=2nd step, 5@D=2 without trump Q, 5@H=2 with trump Q.  5S=2 with void.|pg||
nt|roghog:  http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=939&pid=288 for EW methods|pg||
nt|winkle:  4N by north is probably roman key card blackwood for spades|pg||
nt|winkle:  good stop on this auction.  not practical to get to clubs at this point, and 5@S is the most they can make on a club lead.|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|winkle:  oh i thought he passed.  my bad.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|winkle:  after a club ruff and a non-diamond return, declarer will have to lose a diamond.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: omnimous @C2 lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bigtrain: has to avoid the suit preference implications|pg||
nt|winkle:  yeah.  ouch.|pg||
nt|winkle:  although i think east should return passively anyways|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Lew and Jonathan are still playing in semi-darkness, as we fear hooking up our powerful stadium-style lighting will blow the fuses again...|pg||

nt|winkle:  may not be easy for east to switch to a club, however.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Levin looking at the opps convention card|pg||
nt|winkle:  wow martel stansby bid to 6S and dropped the stiff K off side.  they are on a row.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the spade plays indicate a @C back (KA vs AK)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Levin: "My best chance was if he underled the AK of hearts, but it's SO EARLY."|pg||
nt|bobh1: trump lead backfired on David|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: (And there is light in here!  Thank you to the hotel engineer, who showed up with a powerful generator...)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzfj: I intended making 5, not sure if that is what shows up for everyone.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: the trouble with a splinter is you are not likely to get cooperation (ie. too strong)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so now has to continue in some way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: He's rubbing his hands over his eyes and sighing.  So early for so much angst.|pg||
nt|bobh1: N might have opened|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: i suppose he could bid 5@H now, saying lots of controls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S effectively the same, except should usually be spade void|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bobh1: which might have saved a partscore swing|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: really the hand depends on club holding, which is now revealed|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobh1: no i guess u want to defend on this deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Jonathan brings the @D5 closest to thumb, then puts it back and goes with @HK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie confirms that 3@S was a splinter and 4@S was a cue.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|bobh1: N's hand doesn't fit into the usual parameters|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: the other table you can see Stevie Weinstein playing for Fleisher.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i wonder if 4m is a splinter or fit-showing?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bobh1: so he chooses to show a limit raise, usualy 4 trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2NT is explained as invitational with hearts.  In response to Chip's questions, David writes, "usually four."|pg||
nt|bobh1: he probably intends to bid 4@C even if jonathan declines, which i dont think he will|pg||
nt|bobh1: most pairs play some kind of bromad after the double|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby commented afterwards that he should've flashed Andy his @HQ, perhaps he would've passed 4@H.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a little gamesmanship|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: But he didn't know that he should flash it to Andy instead of Franco.  Franco then launched into an explanation of the "fishhead coup," which it seems we can expect to see on ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Bridgewinners soon...|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: interesting decision to pass|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: two rounds of hearts and three of spades for down 1|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i see we have not missed much|pg||
