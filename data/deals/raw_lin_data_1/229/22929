nt|vugraphzeg: this will not be a success|pg||
pc|sA|nt|muppe: how many tricks she can make, not many|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: West decision to make an old-school t/o-double worked out great|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: I believe that a 1@H-overcall is the mainstream auction on the West cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You don't collect 800 at the one-level every day|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: which let's NS off the hook|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They can on best defence|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bigtrain: with best defense e/w could have beaten this 4 for 1100|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @SA (J) low spade to the 10?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @C lead...  it changes the communication|pg||

nt|muppe: Not that u like -500, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: considering most e/w scores will be minus or partscores the difference between 500 and 800 is minimal|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: so the difference is 5 imps, not to be laughed at|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: play at the 1-level again?|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: and another one level contract|pg||
nt|muppe: S might balance|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: with the bad shape and suit, it might not happen though|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: i'll vote they get to the 3-level here|pg||

pc|hK|nt|runnerup: lead helps |pg||
nt|bigtrain: the hand belongs to e/w in 3m|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If they can get 100 it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|muppe: That lead takes the entry of dummy away, though|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: looks like they should be able to score 2@S 1@H 1@D 2@C for -1|pg||

pc|cK|nt|bigtrain: little reason to go fishing when you have one already hooked on a differnt line|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|muppe: Not much different here if she can make this|pg||
pc|dK|nt|muppe: spades are 3-3 so shdnt be too difficult|pg||
nt|runnerup: pass /north isn't very competitative -partner opened surely she is worth 2 @c |pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: showing 3-c supp and max.|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the system has no way to invite with 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so this is a way to cater to that hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bigtrain: with a 4333 including 2 jacks i strongly disagree with getting past 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: you agree when you miss game by bidding 2@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|runnerup: yes -now -1 at least --in 2 @hh entryes are so bad that you migth make it by cashing @h ace from hand at some point|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: at least with only a 3fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but sure, doesn't have to be right|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if in fact they really don't have a @H invite sequence available after JTB they are boxed in...  too much to give up imo though|pg||
nt|bigtrain: great hands with a 3fit and shape are fine also|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes i like that 4 cards support -agreement style -makes sence against something if partner is empty|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: When did your NT-system give you +170 with those cards the last time? :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: She's way too modest to do that, me on the other hand... :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: depends o the range|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bigtrain: mikael...  what range did N show?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2NT was 20-21 so it's a bit aggressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: a quantative 4NT is a possibility|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s4|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h7|nt|runnerup: no slam has any play -except 6 @c if west playes once low in @h -then alimination and she is in to help by doublevoid switch|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d3|pg||
mc|11|nt|runnerup: east -yes sorry|pg||

nt|bigtrain: N is in the poorish 20 counts for sure|pg||
nt|arvidsson: if N has a 4324 6@C might have 12 and 6nt only 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: and if the distribution would have been a bit different (North having a small spade instead of the small club) 6NT would be great|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|d|mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|runnerup: 4 @h is makeable -but biddable -hmm--5 @d looks like 500|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bigtrain: KNR says the last hand was worth 19.25|pg||
mb|2H|nt|runnerup: 3 times @c and 4 @h should go down to look better |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: what's your opinion on East's bidding?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Do you prefer double to 1@H?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|bigtrain: the hand is a tweener...  i don't mind either approach|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|arvidsson: I prefer to double to have the chance of finding a @S fit early, but overcalling 1@H is the best if NS bids ti the 3 level:)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|runnerup: i bid 1 @h ,but dont criticase east too much if this is her style|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d4|pc|c2|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzeg: There are of course merits to both, 1@h makes it more dificult to find diamonds for the opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: dbl finds a spade fit and is liklier to lead to game|pg||
pg||
qx|o17|st||md|3SQJ973HQ9874DT8C6,ST8542HJ52D3CQJ95,SHADJ9642CAKT8432,SAK6HKT63DAKQ75C7|sv|o|nt|vugraphzeg: or more likely|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|arvidsson: this could be an interesting hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|bigtrain: guess we've moved past the one level contracts|pg||
nt|runnerup: this time 1 ssuiter @c or 2.suiter =minors?|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|runnerup: north has 2-suiter -or she thinks so|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: how many spades will west bid?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think it shows extras|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2@d = natural reverse or 4+ @s with a strong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: remember that 1@H showed spades|pg||
nt|bigtrain: definitely doesn't have to have @D for a TOX of a 2+ 1@C bid|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|arvidsson: I did not remember the trf bid, but had a lucky prediction for a spade bid :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: now north have shown a natural reverse, E must be thinking "what has happend"|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|bigtrain: that is an interesting choice|pg||
nt|arvidsson: if 2@S is natural over a shown suit, EW might end up in 4 @S x|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|d|nt|bigtrain: wouldn't have thought of it...  seemed like another X was the best choice|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 3NT is better than 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|runnerup: bidding on 3-level was weird -4 @s and thats it partner cant count you 5 good @s and 9 points|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @CK isn't exactly worth full value here but bidding only 3 goes against the grain of this optimistic guy|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes, 3@S was an underbid that put way too much pressure on poor East|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|bigtrain: remember you are vulnerable so that about 1 in 4 chance of game is good enough|pg||
