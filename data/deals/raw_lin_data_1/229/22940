nt|vugraphzeg: Both pairs use a natural base where NS use transfer-responses to 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petka:  not that Gronkvist-Rimstedt are moving to the retirement home in the near future either|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  EW will play 3N|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|petka:  the idea is that after 1C-1red-1M-1N west does not have to guess to bid 2C with 5+, and also that the stronger hand gets the NT. with the transfer approach the weak hand often is declarer, as in 1C-red(transfer)-relay-1N|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Which cna be made playing on clubs|pg||
nt|petka:  ok, nough about that, but many specs were wondering|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  3@D is only inviting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: on this board, for example, EW's style will give South a harder opening lead problem|pg||
