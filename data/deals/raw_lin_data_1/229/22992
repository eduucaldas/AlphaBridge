pc|d8|nt|vugraphzdu: El remate hubo stayman y luego 3 st.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missed opportunity for trailing team|pg||
nt|runnerup:  nice kvick tricks in 3nt and south has no problems to bid that|pg||
nt|athene: good low-hcp 3nt; 100% secure on any lead and any lie|pg||
nt|athene: yes it shows the power of a long suit with quick tricks outside|pg||
nt|athene: NS don't have a single point wasted in fact|pg||
nt|athene: maybe Duboin is wondering which major to lead?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time 4 @s is anly 300 but you lose in a long run if you bid those -because in all cases ns aren't aware what they do and 3nt can go down|pg||
nt|athene: yes i don't think EW can reasonably contemplate a sacrifice|pg||
nt|athene: -300 vs -400 is the best you can possibly hope for|pg||
nt|athene: and it might often be -300 or -500 against +50|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|sharkey: yes - but 3@H looks like a make so down 1 may be good business|pg||

nt|sharkey: Some may not bid 3@S with only 3 trumps so this could be IMPs to the Patane team|pg||

nt|athene: i think he can be sure that east has short clubs, but even so, bidding 6 is not so easy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that wouild probably be a rotten pairs score |pg||
nt|runnerup:  west can wander where ns's tricks come if they make this -south must have lond @d -like 6 cards -north is more balanced perhaps|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: probably EW will get a free run in the other room, so then it is a matter of east's rebid after 1@D 1@H|pg||

nt|fabsayc: how many teams go to knockout stage|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Some number of @D here...|pg||
nt|athene: west neither strong nor unbalanced enough for 2@C opener in first or second, but here the requirements are relaxed|pg||
nt|gsper:  NS can make a lot in @S|pg||
nt|athene: will Angelini bid 1@S or show the 2-suiter?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some prefer to keep the 2-suited overcalls weak or very strong, so a 12 count might not qualify|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: interesting if Nunes overcalls 1NT ... West has ev. Dble on the limit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Hi Markku|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: now north has to decide between 3@H and a second double|pg||

nt|queequeg: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|athene: close decision in my opinion|pg||
nt|runnerup:  vulnerability is bad so north has about cards to expect by south|pg||
pc|s3|nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|gsper:  So 4@S is a good save, but unlikely to be found now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: no chance here of course|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you just play spades and accept two down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double is more flexible, as they say|pg||
nt|queequeg: players in both the rooms:|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south has shape -not points but |pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: yes - but neither N nor S can x|pg||

nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/1.jpg|pg||
nt|queequeg: Open room, waiting to start|pg||
nt|athene: tricky declarer play problem here|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to decide whether to try to use the spades, or go for two diamond ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is easy when you see all the cards :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: a double for takeout by north if available would have worked well|pg||
nt|queequeg: welcome Bob :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: N obviously knows what to expect from 2@h |pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|gsper:  N might have doubled 2@D, but with both opponents showing cards, and vul, it was not very attractive|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H finesse and can make. 6@H+1@S+2@D+1@C=10|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would make this, but E may be good enough to find a losing line|pg||
pc|d2|nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/2.jpg|pg||
nt|runnerup:  even 4 ! has chance but so little strentgh |pg||
nt|runnerup:  @h|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: the 4@S bid at the other table was perhaps unwise, left east guessing whose hand it was|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|queequeg: Closed room|pg||
nt|runnerup:  aouth likes to defende 3 @d  -tx partner it is-because in many cases -he cant see to pass|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed has no other choice.:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  How much did 2@D show?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That is we can see all cards.|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/17.jpg Closed Room|pg||
nt|runnerup:  +100 with best lead -@h possible but  50 now --140 for ns looks odds on in @s|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: even with this nice start, and trumps 3-3, declarer should be one down|pg||
nt|athene: east just holds up in spades and there is nowhere to put the @D109|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure east did not especially like leading that unsupported ace, but it's just that nothing else appealed at all|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: ended quietly for 130|pg||

nt|danilo1: can he guess rite ... thk so .. the only chance to make|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gsper:  @H raise or natural forcing I am told|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: S might have tried 3@S, but 3@h feels like a definite statement |pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: the defence can't counter both threats now - if ace and another club, declarer can use the spades if he picks the layout|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: is declarer going to cash the @CAK then try a spade to hand, hoping if that holds, to play a club throwing the @HA?|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's not a bad plan :)|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes that sort of thing is useful but here even if it worked, it would not help especially|pg||
nt|athene: even if clubs break you get 2 hearts, 4 clubs, spade...that's not 3NT by a fair way|pg||
nt|athene: in the play here the defence would have time to attack diamonds anyway|pg||

nt|queequeg: @H CAITI Stefano       @H PATTACINI Maurizio    @H ZAFFINO Maurizio|pg||
nt|athene: in the bidding, a hidden issue is whether north's "double-then-3@H" route showed just any hand too strong for 2@H first time, or whether it does promise a flexible hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: over a normal weak-two opener by opponents, a jump overcall is strong e.g. (2@D) 3@H|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/6.jpg Open Room|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: did the diamonds really go like that? seems odd|pg||
nt|danilo1: so ... @D 3-3 is not the chance|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: so you could argue that double then bidding a suit doesn't show a hand that definitely wants to commit to that suit|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/5.jpg   Closed Room|pg||
nt|athene: i can't believe versace wasted the ace|pg||

pc|d4|nt|athene: and on that basis i suppose south might consider 3@S|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but he is vulnerable, so not clear he should play to make|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gsper:  Andy, the ambiguous nature of 2@D complicated it for N|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: but all that is a bit tenuous|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: now declarer can only get one diamond ruff but north gets squeezed in diamonds and spades|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Open Room they all look very happy|pg||

nt|athene: when south bids 3@H with only six he has to have some shape i think|pg||

nt|fabsayc: where do i collect the 1085 cokes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: maybe can block the diamonds and survive|pg||

mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: i prefer 2@C for that purpose, as partner can bid 2@D with no preference|pg||

nt|runnerup:  3nt ew here and if something /else ) happens -it is a suprice|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with opening 4@H is that if opps bid 4@S or 5@C over it, as they very likely will, you are left not knowing what to do|pg||

mb|4S|nt|athene: however, the way it has gone, he has hardly shown his hand either|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this auction would show extras for me, and for sure that double was penalty|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 2@H transfer to @S and 2@S for @S check. Am I right?|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 3@D is hearts and 3@S is a super-accept, maybe|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello CK and wlc.|pg||
nt|athene: yes i think just bidding 4 right away with north is reasonable|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not see how South can know what is useful and what is not.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: might have a club slam opposite suitable cards, but it's shooting for the moon a bit - 3NT is practical |pg||
nt|athene: might be 4@H or 4@D for them|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: on a club attack declarer might have to overtake in spades to get a fast pitch from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know what the redouble was|pg||
nt|athene: and i can't believe angelini did either|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: maybe if the auction had tempoed out differently he would have bid - for example if west made some raise and then east bid 4@S and that was passed round to him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although if the @s10 forces the king the defence would need an immediate diamond switch|pg||
nt|athene: so losing one heart, one diamond, and one club|pg||
nt|danilo1: looks like -1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: perhaps being NV was a factor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: let's hope we are guessing well|pg||
nt|athene: on any other lead he can happily unblock the @SK as he has time to build an entry to his @SAQ, so plus one|pg||

nt|nilsland:  East has a minor suit card too little to be stripped|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe but could be some fantoni magic|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: another problem on defense for west, succeeds if he clears the spades, but also must unguard the diamonds later|pg||
nt|athene: but as it went, bidding 5@D in front of his partner is a bit of a gamble|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: Damas total: 182-118|pg||
nt|queequeg: the palace where we play is a very artistic place|pg||

mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: doubt if there will be any surprises on this one either - 4@h EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 30 points between them - cud be probing slam...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10-13, 5+@d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|athene: same sort of bidding problem for south here as faced north a moment ago over the 2@C opener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sort of like a strong weak two|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni-nunes 2-level bids do give their opponents some hard decisions|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzdu: holaa|pg||
nt|mdgraham: getting any higher would not be advisable|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: common expert treatment is 1NT on N hand |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a string weak two is presumably a bit weaker than a weak strong two|pg||
nt|athene: or a bit weaker than a rope weak two i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: interesting decision for north there|pg||
nt|runnerup:  partial figth in majors common situation 3 @h is winner if found |pg||

nt|queequeg: Closed room: http://td.bboitalia.it/21.jpg|pg||
nt|athene: pass (bit wet), double (if takeout), 2@D (your best suit) or 1@S (spades!) all worth consideration|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: lanzarotti obviously takes 2@S as showing a very weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: the immediate bid after the redouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I guess N could double 3@d with a good(ish) hand |pg||
nt|athene: you might say "well, obviously north must be broke, after the opponents have both shown decent hands"|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will be a bit worried here; only 8 obvious tricks even with the club finesse working|pg||
nt|psyck: I like dbl of the options|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C just makes but 3@S could be for -500|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cc does not cover this auction, anybody know what 3@C is?|pg||
nt|queequeg: Open Room http://td.bboitalia.it/30.jpg|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Will Sementa lead a low heart or the J :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: not sure about this - 2@c may be Gazzilli |pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS are too balanced, but it's hard for either side to realise this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kibitzers (some of them) say 3@C asks for 4 card major or 5 card minor, 3d denies|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not many pairs include 5-card majors in the weak NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since i got at least 4 versions i am more confused than before :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  maybe the have no choice with less than 14 pts|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: @c queen is a nice card but not shown|pg||
nt|athene: well, no 4@C, so madala knows they are off the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: they'll play six, though, i would think|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2NT said he liked clubs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jaapfr: 5@D might make|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have a great hand for clubs in that context|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: oh well :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@h not very good needs @C 32 and king rigth most times|pg||
nt|athene: but the point is, if you work out what partner has by trusting your opponents, then you get talked out of games when west has psyched the redouble|pg||
nt|psyck: beautiful venue indeed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: but the spades are blocked so he can play on diamonds successfully|pg||
nt|athene: i think if 5@C was there, west would have bid it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: did E se 4@C as foricng?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: need to be cautious    even 5 level could be too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nobody ever won at bridge by trusting the opponents|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't think Sementa would compete to 3 level with a 4333 hand, but it works fine here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: so having agreements with partner is a better way to go, what with him being on your side|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most of the time.....|pg||
nt|athene: south can see declarer is all set to throw hearts on spades, so might as well attack hearts now?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C obviously something showing a good hand, maybe showing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on;y blocked if he wins this :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing king looks the odds play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
nt|athene: lead was @S9 showing bad suit|pg||
nt|athene: and if it was lauria who had the spades, he would have let versace win the first diamond to clear the suit surely|pg||

nt|psyck: 9, has a trump to lose|pg||
nt|gsper:  Surely they must lose a trump too?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: with the idea that you will get your club tricks anyway?|pg||
nt|gsper:  You got ahead of me!|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@H promised five it looks ok|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|athene: sure east has a maximum but it's all queens, and only two clubs|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: most irritating is to go down at the 5 level having mad a slam try   but will be ok here|pg||
nt|sharkey: still has to make it - like you stated David|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: of course it is always easier to work out how the cards lie when you can see how they lie :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is no joy  in Mudville....|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: in fact will have to play carefully       may go down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wonder if the @S4 had any significance|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he decided the only way to beat was partner having the @CA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for non baseball fans, that refers to a famous poem|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and a wasted @SQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|athene: if trumps are clubs are 3-2, you don't need the @CK right, do you? just lose club, ruff clubs good|pg||
nt|athene: *if trumps AND clubs are 3-2|pg||
nt|athene: because you can cash clubs and get the heart through as well|pg||
nt|athene: partner having the @HK is not in itself enough; even if you cash some hearts, declarer can throw enough clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H would be interesting|pg||

nt|bobholl: that's true but still not much better than 50%|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but there are other chances too|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: yes, easier call if 1@h was 5, i play it as 4+|pg||

nt|hedyg:  http://www.federbridge.it/main.html|pg||
nt|runnerup:  even 3 @s has good chance -best played by north (so 1. round pass seem too wet -has to be repeated|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see why 4@C should be forcing|pg||

nt|athene: i don't know the intricacies of the NS methods but i suspect 2nt showed extras|pg||
nt|athene: but if west led a spade, east could win the @CA and return a diamond and then throw two clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer could never get to dummy as east could overruff with the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, all irrelevant anyway|pg||
nt|athene: or just a club lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5 @c ok -here -4 @h makes ..so |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok, essentially 3@C was modified puppet stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: think 3@S max|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some 9 in @h ew if opened and will |pg||
nt|athene: 5@D might come home but 4@C tick would have been a reasonable place to stop i think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: not sure e/w will be able to enter the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if north bid only 2@S and east doubled, that would find the club fit, but that is surely the only way|pg||
nt|athene: and i think north will bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  4 losers in spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: But NS likely will end up in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: the only way 4@S makes is if the defence don't attack diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to bid it - S will decline any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: but that's not happening|pg||
nt|athene: i think north just bids 3@S here and they play there|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree William|pg||
nt|ady: will east enter if north raises to 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@C also possibility - Splinter|pg||
nt|athene: i would probably double 2@S with the east cards|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@C NOT precision style, though it looks that way|pg||
nt|psyck: Right Bill, which is why I guess Markku said better chances played by N|pg||
nt|athene: double fit might come to light here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: now a support double for spades i guess, so they find their 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sing @s makes it ofcause dangerous to open 4. hand|pg||
nt|athene: well sort of double fit :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  mainly that and west will lead @h Q --normally -@c lead only after peeping|pg||
nt|athene: many would just raise clubs with east, but sementa obviously feels that with opps bidding hearts, it is worth a lot for your side to find spades, rather than clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: south will have trouble showing hand now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: N has a shortage of points but great playing strength when pd bid @S|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt was a spade raise you would think south would bid a discouraging 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will pay to stop low here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like a direct 3@D invite, although the bid has several flaws|pg||
nt|psyck: 2C = 10-13 value, 5C-4other unbalanced, or 6+C|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@D relay asking for 3-card major|pg||
nt|psyck: N's hand becomes powerful with Aces in pd's suit now|pg||
nt|athene: angelini can't bid less than game now, can he? ace in both partner's suits for a single raise|pg||
nt|athene: transfer responses, so 1@S shows diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|nt|runnerup:  3. hands pass -was a view =suprice also|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gsper:  2NT relay again|pg||
nt|athene: ok, apparently he can|pg||
nt|athene: east might balance now with a double|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last makeble bid NS 2@D|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: i think support doubles are not as popular in italy as in america, but still if you double 1@H with 4+ spades here you surely need them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could have responded 2@d, perhaps, but that may be FG, and S isn't quite strong enough for that (non strong-club opener)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry but don't have a CC for NS|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: still will easy enough for defence to collect their 4 winners  |pg||
nt|athene: ok, the fifth spade is nice, and QJ doubleton is much better when partner opens the suit, but even so...|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i'm told 2NT is 6-4|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tactical 3 @h to play in 4 ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and EW just make 2@S imo|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: ah a spec suggests north is "she" - i was assuming a different angelini haha|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 now -but ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: everyone has shown his hand fairly, except N who should have bid stronger|pg||
nt|athene: i don't understand why west bids spades rather than hearts, but it sure worked out|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: so 3@H was just attempting to sign off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT is FG|pg||
nt|athene: even if 2@D response were not GF you might bid a spade anyway so as not to lose the suit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2000 |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h showed 3-4 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d showed 1345|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought the redouble might give EW a better chance to find the right major, if west could pass and let east bid spades|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|runnerup:  200 -500 with x|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks too aggressive|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so north was weaker than i would have been |pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: very complicated hand, but at least the lead reveals south has no natural lead|pg||
nt|athene: you feel silly here if you try the jack and then south has a singleton queen|pg||

nt|athene: if NS did bid game, east might well bid 5@C, surely?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: just take A and @D K|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: getting to a nice safe 3@D partscore is not trivial really|pg||
nt|athene: also i have no idea what the redouble is all about :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: made now no problem|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless your playing flattery|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: but then north feels that facing any sort of heart fit it is worth a shot at game|pg||
nt|athene: run all the diamonds looks reasonable|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so if you pass 3. hand -why bid again ..ofcause souths 2 @s was aggressive also|pg||
nt|psyck: they have some defense, may not be all that clear to bid 5@c, though it is very likely they will bid it as insurance at this vul|pg||
nt|jaapfr: XX and 3@C and 3@D do mean: pls opps go to an unmakebele level:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now semanta must guess spade finesse or more diamonds|pg||
nt|danilo1: next "easy" 3NT ... but with @H wide opened ... after testing @C 3-3 (ending in dummy) ... Sementa may see better chance in @S finess than the risk to loose 3 @D tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he will get it right|pg||
pc|c2|nt|runnerup:   at least you get + score there -2 aces -and|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what north was worried about - pushing opps into 5@C making - but that is not a big danger when you have two aces and partner opened|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: it looks as though west bid 2@S because he assumed opps would compete further and then he could show hearts|pg||
pc|cK|nt|runnerup:  norths|pg||
nt|athene: but why is he so anxious to bid 3 over 3?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as you said earlier about 2@S bid|pg||
nt|athene: partner doubled 2@D so you push them up to 3@D and beat them|pg||
nt|jaapfr: W thinks mb @H my pds suit|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: south either has A,AJ alone in diamonds or AKJx|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: Zaleski picked up 12 UMPs on bd 4|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a natural line but wont work|pg||
nt|athene: opps might well tell you how to play the spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, they have escaped without a double|pg||
nt|danilo1: he should get it rite ... since with no @DJ, Nunes would probably stay low|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: as far as i can see, declarer had to go after spades, which lie favourably|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|runnerup:  actually a suprice|pg||
nt|jaapfr: could 3@D X -2 (think declarer can end with -1)?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2NT=20-21|pg||
nt|jaapfr: easy 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  if you are afread of oppenents to make 5 -level with those cards after partner opens and invites -youll never can bid any games |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: south had made a great lead, and should have known every card at the end|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S-1 on hand 4 cost 12 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|athene: perfect mesh here - singleton facing four small - let's see if they can identify it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to locate @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows some sort of good raise and *south* shows extras and a heart singleton, that will certainly do it|pg||
nt|athene: well, with a ten-card fit you don't usually count the queen of trumps as a problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT 12-14; not 5/4 majors or 4441|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D looking for a 5-3 spade fit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, CC not clear about 3@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3M would be a singleton or void|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead runs to the jack, and declarer will duck a club to north to protect the @SKx i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: if east is thinking this long he must have forgotten the system :)|pg||
nt|athene: wake up, fantoni!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, misread the CC. 1NT can include a 4441 shape.|pg||
nt|athene: EW's 1nt has to cover a lot of hands unsuitable for other bids, sort of like a precision 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: their 1-bids are 14+ points and their 2-bids are unbalanced so the weak notrump has to work hard for its living|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, lots of people; no idea about 3@d|pg||
nt|nilsland:  As often - when you take nine you get ten.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobholl: always difficult to rerach a normal 4@S after weak NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a partial available both sides.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lovely 1@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: only problem 6@S n/s  is the 3-0 trump split    needs to guess which way to play trumps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Any bidding by EW cud assist declarer in locating the Q|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S=at least 5/4 both minors |pg||
nt|gsper:  That is a heavy overcall by their standards|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2N = raise, 5-9 4 crd, 7-9 3-crd, or 8-11 with sing.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: maybe just natural and strong, and then everything natural-ish, with 3@S showing stopper and concern about hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny, on the copy of the EW CC I have 1NT-3minor is not described at all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so presumably they are natural bids|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: even when the opponents are silent you can sometimes use that to help find the Qxx|pg||

nt|psyck: i assume transfer adv & 1@s leass than 3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: i wonder if east had super-accepted, whether south would have bid 3@S|pg||

nt|nilsland:  3@D was 7-9 with 3@S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but at this vulnerability, that line of thought does not really help so much, because even with a lot of shape, the opponents are not going to be bidding|pg||
nt|ady: in my opinion that would not be a reasonable question to ask |pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny how often 4441 hands never quite live up to their potential (in terms of hcp) |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am very surprised east did not take another bid|pg||
nt|athene: it does look as though doubling 3@H helped NS though|pg||
nt|athene: gave madala more room to make a try|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult decision for madala|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would play on @D 33|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in positions similar to this, you might want to make the exotic play of ducking the first trick|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is you can draw trumps and keep control of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think that applied here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: he has virtually no defense to 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although looking at 3@d and 3@S you would guess puppet stayman |pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 3@c asks for 5M or 5422 shape|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart return he will test clubs and then maybe run the @DJ into north for a second avoidance play|pg||
nt|athene: still guarding those spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 3@d denies 5m4M|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they should put that on their CC for us poor old commentators :) |pg||
nt|athene: if the defence now play ace and a spade, of course declarer can afford to run the @DJ|pg||
nt|athene: @CQ would have saved a trick; now declarer can lead a heart to the queen then duck a heart and get a club pitch on the @HK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|sharkey: A @C lead will leave the lead in dummy  and -1; otherwise lead will go to hand and make - I predict|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: probably expected QJ10 in S, with the 9 in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i'm a bit surprised at versace showing the minors actually|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a 3nt raise to me|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: you mean declarer's natural play is to lead a small trump from whichever hand he finds himself in at trick 2?|pg||
nt|ady: swing could go either way|pg||
nt|athene: i think it is just about 50-50 to be honest|pg||
nt|athene: of course madala is not expecting the @CK to be onside|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's surely below 50%|pg||
nt|athene: he's wondering whether to overtake this, ruff the last heart, then play a small club |pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: oh well, at least he will be happy when he finds the bad break now - it means there is a chance 5@S can gain imps|pg||
nt|gsper:  The low @H showed even number without honor or odd with|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lets say well bid -no real idea if they were aware about possible @c slam -not this time ofcause |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: the defence would then have time to set up a diamond trick but that might be ok|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but in hindsight N does not need so much to make a slam so 3@D better than my 4@S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|runnerup:  i think you always make this but easyer now ofcause|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: So much for preditions...|pg||
nt|ady: was that 480    or 450|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|nt|athene: the lead gives declarer an easy ninth trick from diamonds but she would have been ok on a club lead anyway i guess - play spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: I have been given a link: http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, so NS play strong @c system, sry I came late did not realise|pg||
nt|athene: good play from bocchi; putting a lot of pressure on west if he has something like @HAxxx|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: NS Leads are Slavinsky (standard count with an honour in the suit & reverse count without an honour).|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: he might worry that north has @HQJ doubleton so he might go in with the ace second time|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: and lo, it says 3C = asks 5-crd major or 5422, not used if just looking for 4-4 fit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: interesting sort of squeeze here|pg||
nt|athene: if north throws a diamond declarer can't go wrong really|pg||
nt|athene: but if he throws a heart, south has to throw a spade, and then it becomes safe to take the diamond finesse anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm sorry that is not quite correct, as east will presumably throw a heart anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so then south can throw a heart and it is not quite safe to finesse diamonds through north|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that's what my copy of the CC says. Might be out-of-date of course|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: hard for east to know it was diamonds, not clubs, he should have been attacking|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: made +1 if switched to @D ??|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: but then as a spec points out you can cash two hearts|pg||
nt|nilsland:  At Bocchi's table the lead was @CQ - so he couldnt|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cT|nt|athene: yes i was wondering if they had changed their methods and 3@S forced 3nt|pg||

nt|sharkey: *game|pg||
nt|jaapfr: kibs agre with yr 2@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: well, if you open 11 counts and force to game with 11 counts, you better get used to 22 count games|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|ady: I very much doubt  Rod-Meckwell would be in 3NT on this collection|pg||

nt|mdgraham: after that we're struggling.....|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: it might look as though declarer only has five losers but if he draws trumps he can't ruff a diamond so he should go one down|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: 4@c cue, 5@C Turbo |pg||

nt|athene: 2@C 18-19 balanced|pg||

mb|2D|nt|bobholl: nice N hand|pg||

nt|runnerup:  a good day and 4 @h ok ns -not to day|pg||

nt|psyck: just table presence :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt played by S is fine\|pg||
nt|athene: well, he might take the scenic route, but that's where he is going|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|athene: i would have thought 1nt was the obvious rebid there|pg||
nt|athene: getting your overall hand across|pg||
nt|nilsland:  The @D9 makes the slam very good|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6@H (NT) ... and double @D finess probable|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 4@D will only encourage camberos|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@C is ok, as long as partner doesn't think you have to have diamonds for it|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@H     but n/s may play 4@S   for -500|pg||
nt|gsper:  Par seems to be 6@DX|pg||
nt|psyck: only 2 red aces to lose in a @h contract|pg||
nt|psyck: since on @c lead, you can discard on @s & W cannot ruff profitably|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@H wins on @C lead aswell.|pg||
nt|gsper:  N probably has more defense than partner expects|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: EW might have 4@D, at this rate|pg||
nt|athene: obviously east thinks 4@D is forcing, though, which suggests he thinks it is a "new suit" i.e. 2@C does not guarantee any diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: but how to show it now (gazilli ?)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards lie remarkably badly |pg||
nt|athene: ok, i guess he did finesse, but of course makes anyway after no spade shift|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @h with 7 isn't everyones choice|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H opener gives east a much harder task|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 3nt by S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: i assume the pause there was west thinking, not south|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C natural or various strong hands; 2@S less than 8 points|pg||
nt|athene: you might just bid 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|psyck: non vul, @h sequence, some shape & values on the side, a clear 3@h bid|pg||
nt|athene: no problem in 6@S of course with the miracle diamond lie so the 7 is good|pg||
nt|runnerup:  also in 5 . board 5 @c X -100 like expected -over 4 @h  =6 imps|pg||
nt|athene: but even if south had a higher diamond he would get squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|athene: unless it was diamond lead and diamond continuation after the trump, i suppose|pg||
nt|runnerup:  12 in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: making a slam is the best way to beer|pg||
nt|athene: yes, making a slam with the @D7 having squeezed someone is definitely a good beer|pg||
nt|queequeg: @s@S ====== Running Scores ====== @S@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW misunderstanding here is a variation on a common theme:- when do you count a short minor opening as a "bid suit" and when not?|pg||
nt|sharkey: In the other room W opened a weak NT and East bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: if diamonds have been bid already, then 4@D is not forcing|pg||
nt|ady: good swing for Zaleski here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone for 3@D with four-card trump support?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if north opens 3 @h -what is east bid?|pg||

nt|danilo1: Toni must (will) make one more bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@h=maximum without majors or 4@h|pg||
mb|5S|nt|fabsayc: in this auction where a suit agreed and we are past 4nt, i play 5NT is key card (probably i am alone :()|pg||
nt|fabsayc: alternatively 5NT should say he is interested in 7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: very scenic miht o overboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I guess with three jacks it's a bit aggressive :(|pg||
mb|5N|nt|athene: 2nt was GF balanced, asking about minors; i assume 3@D showed five clubs|pg||
nt|athene: and south got mildly interested|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well as i said it is difficult - you might just bid 3nt |pg||
nt|psyck: same i suppose dbl planning 3N on 3M|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but if partner bid lets say 4 @c ?|pg||
nt|athene: you might double but that will often just give you a hard problem later on|pg||
mb|6C|nt|jaapfr: 4nt with @D lead can create big problems so better 5@C for NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: one can not develop both majors with @D lead so if @D lead doomed|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok i'm told 3@D was a 5-card minor, 3@H asked, 3@S showed clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently 3@H was equivalent of jump after 2@D response|pg||
mb|6D|nt|jaapfr: i really miss why to lead @H as W|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with a less solid suit he would pass or double|pg||
nt|danilo1: opps, Danger now ... guess Toni bid too much with 5NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: endplay coming up....draw trumps in 2, ruff the spade, exit diamond|pg||
mb|7H|nt|gsper:  Therefore the double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but this looks like one too many cue bids to me|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Have East denied @DK?|pg||
nt|danilo1: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Should make now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Can duck this|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, duck this looks simplest, then just draw trumps|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need to guess the hearts or anything|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West did not think so|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: 4@Sx by north in open room|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|athene: if you draw trumps you don't have a dummy entry, but when you lead the @H10, east has a tricky decision |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: you might have started with @HA10 doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: now the double squeeze is pretty much marked|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: cash @CK, ruff a heart, and then run the trumps|pg||

nt|ady: e/w should make 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry only 6-5 here of course|pg||
nt|athene: north was stuck; if he ducked at trick 1, hoping for a heart shift, declarer could win the ace immediately|pg||

nt|runnerup:  6 @c +1  is easy ofcause |pg||
nt|athene: you can even make 7@C i suppose on the layout|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can S pass?? I doubt that he will|pg||
nt|athene: sure he can|pg||
nt|athene: well, he can if double is penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: but vulnarable it is understandable the other one was nV|pg||
nt|runnerup:  110 available both ways -this -100 with best def|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H pass/correct invitational, by the look of it |pg||
nt|danilo1: will end here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  East-West will not find the @S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|athene: only @DA as an obvious loser, as you can throw a diamond on the @SK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: but if you draw trumps you only have 11 tricks with crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: i think north ought to be raising clubs if her partner can bid them twice|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: yes, opposite vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt scramble now, perhaps|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW were thoroughly preempted out|pg||
nt|psyck: made it difficult for EW to enter at this vul|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not a good start for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 450 modest consolation|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|ady: maybe a diamond lead would give problems|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead would certainly cause problems, but the club looks normal to me|pg||
nt|athene: even after a club lead, the defence might have a chance - suppose declarer wins the jack and returns a club; north can win and shift to a diamond now|pg||
nt|ady: even a club lead  may nopt make    diamond switch later may be ok for defence|pg||
nt|danilo1: small @D now?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: NS play a strong club system, i am guessing over 1@S a bid of 2@C is their only game force|pg||
nt|athene: after a club lead declarer can go for hearts immediately of course, but that looks risky with just a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: well when you only go for 500 with that dummy, i don't think you can be accused of rash bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: but it still costs an imp |pg||
nt|athene: maybe west comes under pressure, having to guard both majors, and you can ruff the @HK or @S10 good|pg||
nt|gsper:  A D by E risked 4 or 5@C from partner|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D was obviously something weird - maybe showed just a minimum hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this lead stops 6|pg||
nt|runnerup:  under 6 @c you can stay with good justment|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cant|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: if declarer plays hearts early   should make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know if NS's agreement is that 2nt here is lebensohl or a scramble|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: in italy most doubles suggest a desire to compete further, even after the fit has been found|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: interesting that north does not unblock - you would think he would, as then either defender can win the third heart if need be|pg||
nt|athene: but even if you play it as scramble you can use it, like this, to show a weak 3@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: (direct 3@H bid is stronger)|pg||
nt|athene: of course if that is what the double meant then it is easy for south to bid on|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|athene: one possibility is to run the spades first - that often makes life hard for the defenders|pg||
nt|sharkey: He has to play on @H I think|pg||
nt|athene: i think versace might get trump squeezed|pg||
nt|danilo1: wd|pg||
pc|h9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: the trouble is, it might make things hard for you too - you have to find a couple of discards, and you also lose your dummy entries|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Will be 2 or 3 down now - good defence|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: if this holds the trick, what does declarer do next?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume play @C to the A and @C up.  @D A has to be in front|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is fairly sure now that north has the @HA, which makes it safer to play another heart, as north is probably not going to be the one with long hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no way the defence can set themselves up some long hearts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Pity on the nice defense to miss the second ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now heart best|pg||
nt|nilsland:  up to now ;)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|athene: north obviously worried about the weak opening|pg||
nt|athene: but as a dummy for clubs it is pretty good really|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|h2|nt|athene: @HJ suit-preference for diamonds over clubs of course|pg||
nt|danilo1: I do not disagree with @S back by Fantoni ... attacking options since declarer still fears @D overruffs|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his partner has five hearts of course from the 2@D bid|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|athene: so he tries to set up his suit|pg||

pc|h7|nt|athene: but south "bent" a 1nt call on board 1, 3, and 4|pg||
nt|athene: north must have noticed that|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: i suppose you might misguess spades twice, leading to the 8 then the jack?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||

nt|athene: was it possible south could have three diamonds though?|pg||
nt|athene: could he be 4-3-3-3 on that bidding?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand looks very interesting, two slams beaten by bad breaks|pg||
nt|athene: north might get endplayed in 3@C, for example heart lead ruffed, draw trumps, then play a spade|pg||
nt|athene: north will have to lead a spade or diamond|pg||
nt|jaapfr: needs @C lead to beat 4@H and 4@S doomed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: hopefully that's spades and a minor. If it's just spades.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@s would be a weak two in spades |pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|athene: east really bid 2@D? is this a 2-way bid, maybe weak spade raise or some strong options?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yy 5@H does make with @S @S lead kibs:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: maybe a better plan was to cash the @DA at trick 2, then return the heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice to see that even Fantunes can err occasionally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner started with @DKx he can cash the @DK before giving you the heart ruff, and you can give him a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no need to underlead your @DA trying to pick up @DQxx with declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt =dd and down in practive if no helping bids in defence (like here) perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so we see lauria's opinion of the tricky bidding problem for balanced 24 count after 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: might very well get the clubs right - we shall see|pg||
nt|athene: he doubled and basically forced to 6@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lucky 6 @s for bear card bid and made quite lucky|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nilsland:  25 to 7=32 now we surely will see a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West might have passed - six spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might deem it unsuitable for a weak two |pg||
nt|gsper:  E has a lot of cards but does not know where to go|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gsper:  And knows even less now|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would bid 3NT now and go down|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s maybe...|pg||
nt|athene: defence have to be slightly careful here to cash out the diamonds and not for example try to cash two hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: the systematic 2@D bid did S pass else he could bid and NS in a @H contract|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another failing 7 perhaps|pg||
nt|danilo1: hopefully only 6 this time :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We dont have any system notes. Has East showed @C+@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think so but just a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i am told, on the NS methods, if south WAS 4333, he would be 18-20, so that was out|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i never see in table any one to finess @c -not expected here |pg||
nt|athene: west tries to conceal the position in clubs|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2@H was natural or 22-24 bal|pg||
mb|4C|nt|gsper:  Opposite an overcall, Hedy?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 6 either major makes with spades friendly.|pg||
nt|athene: so the defence don't realise the urgency to cash out in diamonds|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bobholl: very good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: kickard, love it|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose 6@H is a bit better than 6@S because you might make it even with a bad spade break, but it's hard to get out of a 4-4 fit once you lock into it|pg||
mb|4N|nt|nilsland:  sry 24+ bal|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@C looks like nat (@C support) and slam interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Yes, diamonds might produce an extra trick.|pg||
nt|athene: so the underlead looks like a definite slip|pg||
nt|psyck: well, i did guess E would bid @s, just misguessed the number|pg||
mb|5D|nt|nilsland:  but I do not know more|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Your guesses is as good as mine (or better)|pg||
nt|danilo1: and 4NT is probably @D cue ...so Sementa asks for third round control in @H now I thk|pg||
nt|fabsayc: either way looks a shakey auction|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... but he may get third round @S control :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: no @S Q so 6 only|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if 2@S is 5/5, he knows W has diamonds - straw in the wind perhaps|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: but agustin did realize:)|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|nt|kareno: 5@h may show two without trump queen.|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should have taken control with blackwood over 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: normally you don't want the limited hand as captain|pg||
nt|athene: east just wants to know if her partner has @SAQ, @HA, @DA - then 7 is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: There's no safety play in the spade suit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@c - so old hat these days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that could be a very expensive @d7 discard|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west can never know if 7 is good because he does not know his partner has six solid hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @S2 to K and club finesse?|pg||
nt|gsper:  The voice commentators are criticizing 3@H, a bit unfairly I think|pg||
nt|gsper:  Considering the alternatives|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Again|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... 5NT is not the luckiest bid for EW|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Later today there will be some systemic discussion - in Italian....|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gsper:  3@H is not good, but what else is?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: some specs are suggesting that if west wants to give the impression he has no club honour in hand, the jack was a better card to play|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: that is usually what you would do, sure, but if you had a singleton club in hand you might try the king|pg||

nt|athene: now north may know his opponents have had a misunderstanding but he still has to judge whether to double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h=10-13, 5+@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: weird|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok --nonsence|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, E's hand could play very well opp fitting hands|pg||
nt|gsper:  3@C may be singleton ask|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: i think double is right|pg||
nt|gsper:  What on Earth is going on here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if they wake up and bid a cold 4@S you just hope that your teammate are in it anyway|pg||
nt|athene: now south might discover a diamond suit tucked away there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cc says 2@s=realy, but maybe that doesn't apply by a passed hand  |pg||
nt|athene: if partner asks you for non-spade suits and you have seven in one of them, you might want to bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s presumably some sort of fit-jump|pg||
nt|psyck: are we looking at the same boards :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  It is suggested that thay are playing board 29|pg||
nt|hedyg:  UNDO ?|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe the bidding is for board 29|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south is thinking how bad a dummy for diamonds his partner might put down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h-3@h might have bought it|pg||
nt|athene: i guess something like 2-4-3-4 shape is possible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: something maybe not quite right here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is not gonna make :) .heh heh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think W playing 3@d on a 3-2 fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a bright kib said better W bidding 2@H and then 3@H (for the ones who see 3@H as 5/5m)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: double 3@C looks normal with west but this will work out fine anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that might provoke 5@d|pg||
nt|athene: might be a problem now if north passes after a looong think, and south finds 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
nt|gsper:  But even then 3@D is not obvious|pg||
nt|psyck: if so 3@d @c single (with 3@h @d single & 3@s @s single)?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Quite possibly|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead you might well need five diamond tricks so small to the queen is right, isn't it? gains against @DKx onside or @Dxx as here|pg||
nt|athene: @DKx or @DKxx|pg||
nt|ritong: down two, seems|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: even if North is known to have slow-passed, 5@d isn't unreasonable with 7411 shape|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually there are no pure penalty doubles, so was not 100% clear for south to pass|pg||
pc|h2|nt|queequeg: @s@S ====== Running Scores ====== @S@S|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but N has gone on anyway, so no problem|pg||
nt|nilsland:  System notes says take-out but...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: the down side of fit jumps is it also helps opponents to evaluate their fit|pg||
nt|psyck: if E found @c single , he did not want to try much beyond game...|pg||
nt|ritong: four trumps and three aces, basically|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: ok, so now you lay down the @DA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: west might duck a heart lead|pg||
nt|gsper:  We don't know how srong 2NT could have been|pg||
nt|ritong: i think doubling 2@d means " i have a strong opinion about 2@h"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not necissarily a disaster, NS have decent play for 3nt|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: yes, but if close to limit raise values, E can envisage a slam with right cards|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a third undertrick now|pg||
nt|nilsland:  for sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade pitch|pg||
nt|nilsland:  four trumps 2@D and the black aces|pg||
nt|danilo1: Fantoni has @D count - so he knows parner has @DQ ... he is thinking what to discard (may disc. @C and South may take and play @CJ) ... |pg||
nt|ritong: the trump promotion is visible|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: it would be interesting to know why East didn't simply raise hearts - but it might be a bit difficult to find out |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|danilo1: @CJ now ... |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|athene: when you can afford to lose one trick it's better to play the ace first because if you finesse the queen and lose to the king, you have a guess next time whether to play south for ...|pg||
nt|athene: singleton king or KJ doubleton|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: two rounds of diamonds for four down |pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6@C by north i suppose, maybe 5nt shows two suiter|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: barry crane's laws apply, both of them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1. partner never has the right cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2. never bid a grand slam|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi might be contemplating 4nt here? heart lead, seven (!) diamonds, and lead a spade up for the tenth, just hoping the defence can't cash too many clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: Frankly I'm glad to be watching rather than having to make a bid with the north hand!|pg||
nt|lukiluke60: buonasera a tutti|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: i am glad tooo|pg||
nt|kareno: Only six diamonds in south, Bill.|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|athene: might even bid 4@H here|pg||
nt|athene: 7 losers|pg||
nt|jaapfr: madala is quite young of age (30-40 i would say?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In the open room they will play the 7@C board next|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 20s i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but he doesn't know that his singleton club is so suitable, facing such a weak suit|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling 1@s is a close decision|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1@S overcall must be very limited|pg||
nt|ritong: with @s Kx, chance that pard has a penalty pass is slim|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzdu: mucha concentraciòn en la mesa de juego.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|runnerup:  i say nothing about that 14 (anymore)this is partscore only so defence gets +|pg||
nt|athene: 24, i'm told|pg||
nt|jaapfr: an Italian from Argentine or vv?|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, we saw previously that they overcall on air easily|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: that applies to the defense also, 6@D was going down|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lets say could go down|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though the defence should have one trick in each suit here with no problems, but north is in danger of getting endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: so the spade shift was actually necessary|pg||
nt|psyck: going via an artificial 2@c bid to make an invitational raise|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: I agree with Andy, Ghestem sounds sexier|pg||

nt|mdgraham: South may hit this|pg||
nt|psyck: last deal, thanks all|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: thanks to our capable operator Santiago|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: Thanks.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when is the final set?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Falta el último match despues de este, continuamos con las ultimas manos.|pg||
nt|queequeg: @s@S ====== Running Scores ====== @S@S|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not a huge underbid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@C?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3NT I expect .. but probable correction by South|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3N has no chance|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now West has to lead a @D|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange i play 3@D 3@H 4@H as a slam try and a direct 4@D (or 4@C) as a "nothing bid|pg||
nt|athene: well, you could not ask for a kinder layout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes he has done - EW in big trouble now |pg||
nt|runnerup:  double for penalties -they exists|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps West might have bid 3@C- can then redouble for rescue to a red suit. Now he has to guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure why he corrected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  soon|pg||
pc|c7|nt|runnerup:  angel=Angelini -west playing morsy perhaps |pg||
nt|mdgraham: surely Norht will pass - S did double 2NT. Any further doubles are surely for penalties |pg||
nt|runnerup:  what is he thinking|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder what Versace is thinking right now :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north Angelini |pg||
nt|danilo1: logical 4@S by Nunes ... even if pd only 2-card in @S ... his entryless hand cannot play in NT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzdu: Ultimas 16 en los próximos 15 minutos.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok that i can understand|pg||
nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|jaapfr: strange XX|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: well, east may have made a mild slam try here, the same|pg||
nt|athene: both minors 3-3 with the key card onside|pg||
nt|athene: very tough; i guess you just have to pass as east|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if meant as SOS i can see|pg||
nt|ritong: danger is visible i think duboin will find out|pg||
nt|nilsland:  With another club it will make if declarer plays hearts|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: well i dont see it as a late bid except maybe for lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: partner could have redoubled but he bid 2@H, so he is not much interested in diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: ecco|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzdu: Al maestro carlos pellegrini se le volo el 10 de @S y lo puso como jugado, Se lo vio contento con la pasada del 10.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  nice defence|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: and the @SJ not likely to cause any trouble|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ritong: good play, gio|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on auctions like these a good mantra is to lead a trump|pg||
nt|runnerup:  last board but expensive -so quite pun after this i assume|pg||
nt|danilo1: logical thinking by Giorgio|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: weather clear, track fast|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok 10 +imps or so |pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DJ would have been good|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gsper:  4@S could even make on tired defence|pg||
nt|psyck: will get a beer this deal with @s loser going on @d & @d7 winning last trick?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the eldies became too tired|pg||
pc|d9|nt|queequeg: Next match: Lavazza - Angelini|pg||
nt|queequeg: next match: 15.00 CET (9.00 EST)|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|athene: oh well, 1600 might not be that much worse than 800|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ic:)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: how many off on @DJ at trick 1? Six?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  800 now and 1 slipped|pg||
