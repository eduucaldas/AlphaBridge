mb|2S!|an|bad raise|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the trouble with a splinter is you are not likely to get cooperation (ie. too strong)|pg||

nt|bobh1: N might have opened|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: i suppose he could bid 5@H now, saying lots of controls|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bobh1: N's hand doesn't fit into the usual parameters|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: the other table you can see Stevie Weinstein playing for Fleisher.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i wonder if 4m is a splinter or fit-showing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: so he chooses to show a limit raise, usualy 4 trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2NT is explained as invitational with hearts.  In response to Chip's questions, David writes, "usually four."|pg||
nt|bobh1: he probably intends to bid 4@C even if jonathan declines, which i dont think he will|pg||
nt|bobh1: most pairs play some kind of bromad after the double|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby commented afterwards that he should've flashed Andy his @HQ, perhaps he would've passed 4@H.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a little gamesmanship|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: But he didn't know that he should flash it to Andy instead of Franco.  Franco then launched into an explanation of the "fishhead coup," which it seems we can expect to see on ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Bridgewinners soon...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: interesting decision to pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie: "Good thing it's only a 15-board segment."|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: two rounds of hearts and three of spades for down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby confirms that they play upside-down count and attitude at trick 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gu gesticulating somewhat wildly with his hands to explain to Chip the meaning of 2@S.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: about five minutes.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i see we have not missed much|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the key here is to play spades so north does not imply a heart doubleton|pg||

nt|fabsayc: it did not stop justin, if a real overcall kevin has a clear raise|pg||

nt|andyv:  2nd part of statement scuttled by W's raise |pg||

pc|dA|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|bigtrain: i don't  believe this 2@D is forcing...  if playing RM style pass-f-@D shows invitational values with diamonds|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: It is noted for the record that Stevie did not screw up.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The bad moment came when Lew started contemplating his discard on the second trump.  Now sighing and shaking his head...|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: meaning he tabled the dummy correctly :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is resembling the second quarter of the knicks game yesterday|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: with system on redouble forces 3@C to get out in either minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: To clarify, the defense did not play three rounds of spades.  After the first spade, Franco shifted to a club.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: 1@S is not a misclick.  David slightly atilt.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Providing the otherwise unattainable second hook.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Chip asks about the double: "T/o."|pg||

nt|andyv:  6 more imps to the Milner team as the bought and made contract at both tables on board 38|pg||
nt|andyv:  they are on a 31 imp run since board 34|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 43 had the dealer/vul marked wrong, and the auction started before I noticed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: looks like 43/44 are reversed (44 is S deal no vul, 43 is W deal NS vul)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: going to 45 while we let director figure things out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: fortunately way ahead :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: i'll run this then fix scores later|pg||

mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Shi wrote something about 3@C, but sadly my eyesight does not extend so far.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: no no no|pg||

pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: Let me take this oppotunity to thank Joe Matise for an excellent job keeping us informed on all the table action and mixed up boards|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Vugraphzfd: actually|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: possible imp penalties for one side I guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  best here for N to tap dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to Andy Vinock for co=commentary, spectators and USBF for making this possible and so much fun|pg||
nt|andyv:  but with stiff K@d in S  hand, declarer can take two taps in dummy |pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|chorush: This was a super result for Milner in the other room. Based on the auction they had, Justin literaly stole 4 hearts|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: how did he make it?|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|andyv:  tricky hand for declarer...starts with 5@c and 2@h...playing J@s will give him 8th trick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chorush: won diamond lead, play to heart in dummy, led small club. North went up K and returned club. bingo|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: win spade, diamond and more spades, but heart hook right so should make|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d3|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4@H we thought would make was doubled and down 1, 9 more to Milner "Young Guns"|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|bigtrain: pretty unusual decision...  partners can usually be depended on to lead singletons against suit contracts|pg||
