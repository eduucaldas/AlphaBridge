mb|p|mb|2D|nt|henryb:  thanks|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard for N to pull the trigger as S's hand is limited in hcp|pg||
nt|andyv:  and as the cards lie, 4@s doesn't have a chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now pass the winner, but hard when opponents have 10 trumps|pg||
nt|nilsland:  hi henri|pg||
nt|ritong: compton will go to game facing the 19/20 bramley has shown|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|henryb:  Milner might try 3N now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Milner:  I wanted to drury but didn't think it was good enough, good luck!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: good decision|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s does not mean " i dislike @ss", it shows upper range than a direct 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|ritong: i.e. 19/20|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: Milner: "Wow... THAT hand..."|pg||
nt|ritong: 1NT*|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@s will be in trouble because of the taps|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: he will end up using clubs to extract trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I do agree that Milner has a gf, but I think that LC was better advised in his 2N rebid than HLall|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: well earned swing, heart jack was excellent|pg||
nt|nilsland:  but it not possible to find out without risk - even if 5@D or 4@S might have been better. 3N is the practical choice|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 2@d undersays 5 @ss, or at least asks for a delayed support|pg||
nt|nilsland:  True - especially when not investigate further - but it really not matters for East|pg||
nt|ritong: when bramley denies 3@ss, 3NT is the left spot|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree.  Happily for declarer this lead and the diamond break made the contract for him.  But there are numerous endings possible even without club lead |pg||
pc|s6|pc|h9|nt|Vugraphzfd: Justin: sorry|pg||

nt|fabsayc: things are getting interesting now|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West could have bid 3@H over 3@D and if he had 8-10 points he could afford to do that|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|andyv:  board 36 may be the first board to be more than an imp difference as 3N will be reached in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  2@D was FG Stayman|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|henryb:  a heart lead might beat 4@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  even a @d and a @h shift|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive 4@h bid doesn't deter good hands and W has a pretty good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: @D and @h shift has a better chance...  with @h lead declarer can save 3 heat winners for @C pitches since he knows the entire suit...  tougher to do with @h lead through declarer|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thru dummy that is|pg||
nt|andyv:  and he shows it by bidding that suit!|pg||
nt|ritong: tough situation|pg||
nt|ritong: east's @ss are weak, relatively|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW will have som problems here - East may give up and pass|pg||
nt|ritong: chances are defense can set them up in one round|pg||
nt|kareno: If west's hand is an opening bid, then east's is NOT a game force.  As a light opening bidder from day one, I learned that lesson early.|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 2@s shows the blacks - not great hand|pg||
nt|ritong: so, bart bravely passes|pg||
nt|kareno: And why did west feel compelled to bid over 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Great pass by Bramley|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bigtrain: guess its not going to work since i ignored that west is on lead  :)|pg||

nt|henryb:  Hi Walter|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|chorush: Very nice lead choice|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  North has been very quiet so far with the most high cards of anyone at the table|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s, especially not doubled, as an excellent sac as 4@h should make|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Declarer has to hurry with trumps|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or he will not make this|pg||
nt|ritong: i see six losers|pg||
nt|ritong: minimum|pg||
nt|nilsland:  sry I found the sixth now :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Each trump lead (for a while at least gets two of theirs for one of his).|pg||
nt|ritong: but 3 imps at stake anyway|pg||
nt|nilsland:  seven if South gets a ruff|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Can he make it in some way?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  A and small diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure he can engineer a trump coup|pg||
nt|kareno: I doubt he can make it.  Just hold it to minimum losses.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  On a @h lead this is down easily|pg||
nt|bigtrain: takes specifically a @h lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bigtrain: now should make|pg||
nt|bigtrain: at least cn make|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no @h shift not good enough|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: he certainly has to avoid the @c ruff|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bigtrain: fineese the 10 then fineese the spade then fineese the @HJ then claim with the S entry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Interesting that S has to take the first round @h finesse on a @h shift|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think Compton might have bid 4@d immediately|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  10 imps on board 36 to the Milner team as 3N was bid and made in open room|pg||
pc|s2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  a @h was led and then declarer played a low @c to board...N ducked and the whole club suit came home|pg||

mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: he had 5 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, if it is blacks, worth a game try and even in hearts pretty good|pg||
nt|nilsland:  so you will play in 3@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now is 2@S by Kevin natural?|pg||

nt|ritong: anyways, a thing of beauty, this auction|pg||
nt|nilsland:  The rest of the system seems not so perfecto. Jump to 4NT is not taking advantage of the 3@H bid :P|pg||

nt|ritong: bathurst might have accepted the invite with a secondary source of tricks, mind you|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|ritong: will lall o/c 1NT?|pg||
nt|ritong: ofc yes:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Sure, why not?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: This was a super result for Milner in the other room. Based on the auction they had, Justin literaly stole 4 hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: interesting race coming up for the game fulfilling trick vs game defeating trick|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|bigtrain: how did he make it?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kareno: Rise and play a club I think|pg||
nt|ritong: discipline helps bramley  he avoids the @d lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  tricky hand for declarer...starts with 5@c and 2@h...playing J@s will give him 8th trick|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chorush: won diamond lead, play to heart in dummy, led small club. North went up K and returned club. bingo|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: win spade, diamond and more spades, but heart hook right so should make|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|chorush: EW missed a great save in 5 clubs|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4@H we thought would make was doubled and down 1, 9 more to Milner "Young Guns"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our excellent operator Joann Stansby|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: pretty unusual decision...  partners can usually be depended on to lead singletons against suit contracts|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|chorush: Norht will now eventually ruff a diamond and make|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes.  This will make easily.|pg||
