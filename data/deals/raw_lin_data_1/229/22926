nt|vugraphzeg: 9-10 is what was written|pg||
nt|muppe: and 4@s will end the auction I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 4@S is a good contract that should be bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: i think so, you're vulnerable|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not that i disagree, but don't see any great harm in a gametry|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|arvidsson: a possible @D slam for NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: EW are not playing the popular 2M-openings where they show 10-13 hcp|pg||
nt|muppe: S has a nice hand now|pg||
nt|arvidsson: the options for south is putting the @S in the auction or deciding to show her @D support|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is 2@S forcing in Sweden|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Not a very good slam when West has opened, is it?|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|arvidsson: I guess standard is non forcing |pg||
nt|arvidsson: PO Sundelin suggestion a fitshowing jump in spades|pg||
nt|muppe: 3@h splinter showing shortness and @d support|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: simply too many controls for splinter, not likely to get any cooperation|pg||
nt|arvidsson: I get a lesson from the audience that 2@S ofcourse should be forcing, but the question was wether it was standard or not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: whatever bid they had for low level key card seems better|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|arvidsson: this will end up in 6@D a solid contract |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|arvidsson: if a @C lead N might get to the wrong track|pg||
nt|arvidsson: playing for @S 3-3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|arvidsson: or Q doubelton|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but with a @H lead declarer can test @S and fall back on @C finesse|pg||

nt|arvidsson: and is the lead were partner is the least likly to yell at you if it is wrong :)|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: thats a poor excuse|pg||
nt|arvidsson: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: when playing with some people, it's a great one :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok another possible slam|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but this one is very har to reach and not particulary good|pg||
nt|muppe: how good is this, worse than the previous one i think|pg||
nt|arvidsson: will S show @D first or choose to show 5@H|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|arvidsson: by showing the longer suit first might get the major suit out |pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok S showed her @H suit first|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is definitely harder to bid, and may come down to good technique, which makes judging its quality hard|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 1@S=clubs  2@C=diamonds (I think)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: correct|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|arvidsson: this is a modern way bidding 1nt on 5422|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzeg: 1NT is waiting, not necessarily balanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|muppe: N does have nice honours in partners suits but doesnt still know a real 8 card fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: i dislike 3NT on a 6-5 hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: depends how much of her shape she had already shown|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: she had shown 5-5 with 3@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|arvidsson: will S open 1nt ?|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|2H|nt|arvidsson: 2@h might buy the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: eller vänta, de spelade ut hjärter|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|vugraphzeg: What I meant with that was that there was a heart lead against 6NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|arvidsson: my predictions is as always inaccurate|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: 3@S is a strange reopening|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: it's a little heavy for a 14-16 NT, don't you think?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not done yet|pg||
nt|arvidsson: opposite a lily 11-13 balanced hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: and 3@S is... tough|pg||
nt|arvidsson: likly|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: to say the least|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but this is often the benefit of preemtive bids, the opponents stretch one level higher|pg||

nt|arvidsson: I wonder if 2@S over 2@H would be forcing ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: But then, 3@H is down so this will be a good board anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: It wouldn't have been|pg||

nt|arvidsson: playing strong @C makes pass a lot better, but still a game in @H or @D might be possible|pg||
