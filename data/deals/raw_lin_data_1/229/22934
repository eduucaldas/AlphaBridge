nt|mdgraham: Good evening|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: these six boards will be the last for today|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: and then beer?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: last 18 will be played tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: this is a very serious competition :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: oh, wine, apparently. Good enough |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: 5@D is a decent contract that makes on this layout|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: running scores available at http://www.bjeagle.se/bridge/resultat/damer/trial3.htm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW 1st, +123. 2nd has +59|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: however you have to divide these by 3 for a meaningful total|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I wonder what would have happened if West passed 2@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: She would have been on lead to 2@D, one suspects|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: North may pass, but could also try 2NT to invite game|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: that contract would not make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed so|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|arvidsson: this will be an interesting board|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|arvidsson: NS makes 3-4@C and ew almost nothing|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2@C = a good raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the worst good raise I've seen in a while but still|pg||
nt|arvidsson: so possible now that W jumps to game or bid 3@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's a bit quacky|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D!|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I know this might not be fashionable, but personally I dislike Drury|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|arvidsson: lets see if NS finds there ruffs in @D|pg||

pc|d5|nt|arvidsson: 1 is easy but will probbebly settle for 1 down|pg||
nt|arvidsson: cashing the @S A instead of underplaying it|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|arvidsson: the T@D is a signal for @S|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d6|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: as were EW (but in different partnerships)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: a game fon EW if plateyed with feeling, NS makes 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: They also have a couple of Venice Cup quarterfinals under their belt|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: not 4@C?|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|arvidsson: no|pg||
nt|arvidsson: or yes|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@S 1@H and 1@D not more to loose|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1NT is "Lebensohl" if I'm not mistaken|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|runnerup: but ew 'makes 4 @h |pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzeg: like 0-7 any or a strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: now West needs to double, and may have to do so over 4@c|pg||
nt|arvidsson: if playing trf, I would vid 2@D by east showing my @H suit, if that not avaible I would support @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 3NT....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes. Would not pass, with Qxx spades |pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzeg: this will make now|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok this will make |pg||
nt|Walddk4: East might have found the heart lead, much more difficult for West, and certainly not the ace|pg||
nt|arvidsson: just close your eyes demand the king and either make, or go many off|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If East had bid hearts over double, they would not get to 3N|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe East is "sitting" on the lead - if so, a large chunk of it has just disappeared. Can be a very dangerous tactic|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SAQ63HQ54DQCAKJ97,ST75H3DK65CQ86532,SKJ42HT862DA8743C,S98HAKJ97DJT92CT4|sv|b|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|mdgraham: -11 EW so far - 3@h+1 other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I might have tried 1@H on East's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: a bit dangerous, but I will get my lead|pg||
nt|arvidsson: even though you just got 9 hcp, you have goo suit and might be the last chance to show it|pg||
nt|arvidsson: so a clear cut 3:rd hand opening for me to|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ferdinand, for sure|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 4@S makes after 3 rounds of hearts with the rufing finesse available in clubs. It's a bit harder on a non heart lead|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: You have time to test clubs before you decide, as spades will be 2-2 after the ruff|pg||
nt|arvidsson: Micke do you know what 2nt is?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: my guess is that is 4414 or 4450 any|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suggestion N has shown 5440, club void|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did they locate the spade fit I wonder|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: I think it's either of those distributions with short @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running scores at  http://www.bjeagle.se/bridge/resultat/damer/trial3.htm|pg||
nt|arvidsson: if so the pass over 3nt lookes strange|pg||
nt|runnerup: not contract you expect to be in |pg||
nt|Walddk4: If North has shown a Marmic with short clubs, it seems strange that Forsberg did not opt for the spade game|pg||
nt|arvidsson: I only see 8 tricks with a @H lead|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but since E do not have anymore entries|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Marmic = 5440 or 4441|pg||
nt|arvidsson: this will probbeblu be alrigt, maybe a @D lead can set it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: may switch to @d2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't see how she can come to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|arvidsson: small @D shift also do the job|pg||

nt|runnerup: if declarer gets 1 @h -like small @h lead -she has 9 |pg||
pc|h5|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Might gain 24 cross IMPs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: if everyone else makes 4@S, yes|pg||

pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: 25 IMPs on 4, 12+13 (4@S)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: when E is pre passed is it possible for W to overcall 2-3@H?|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: So Mamma Grönkvist did not exactly do her daughter a favour when she went for 3NT. It cost Ida a bunch of IMPs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but since 2@S is 2 down this might the best way|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: our mother didn't have anything with that result to do|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 41 IMPs. "Thanks mum"|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: she showed her shape|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I thought bridge was a partnership game|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Sure, but that doesn't mean everything is both player's fault|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|arvidsson: playing clubs now makes E endplayed later on|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I doubt they will get to a small slam|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|arvidsson: but one result 170 for EW, and game in @C should not be impossible to reach|pg||

nt|arvidsson: not sure they will bid game :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: OK, will try to have it changed on the schedule page|pg||
