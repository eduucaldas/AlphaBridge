mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Lew and Shi make the universal sign for the strong 2@C bid: the bicep flex.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|nt|leo lasota: decision to go low with steve's hand and not bid 2nt to show both diamonds and hearts due to poor suit quality and unfav vulnerability|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|Vugraphzfj: Hi all, and welcome! We had some technical delays but are now up and running.  Table commentary thus far: "They're gonna start penalize us for running late."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Lew and Jonathan are still playing in semi-darkness, as we fear hooking up our powerful stadium-style lighting will blow the fuses again...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Robinson: "good lead ..u found it"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Hello Jack|pg||
nt|joest: in teh other room east-west silent throughout so little chance (i.e. no chance) for Demeriv toguess the spades|pg||
nt|joest: things are different here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|leo lasota: one heart, one diamond, one club, two trumps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|leo lasota: two diamonds|pg||
nt|leo lasota: d1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfj: Actually Chip played 4 then 5, apologies.|pg||
nt|joest: Robinson doesn't really have time to discover that Garner might 'need' the queen of spades for his takeout double.  He can't really be sure of the red suit honor layouts|pg||

nt|leo lasota: Nice result by Kit/Fred in other room staying low in 3D here|pg||
nt|penseur9:  no matter how we look at it, it's looking -3 here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Is D1 the score Jan?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Garner: "if I'd had your 10 of hearts I'd have made it"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|2+|nt|Vugraphzfb: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: And the play I put in is almost certainly correct|pg||
nt|penseur9:  so 12 boards to score and 19 IMPs difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: 1C is frequently a weak nt type hand for N/S|pg||
mb|2S!|an|4 !ss, 5+ !ds|nt|leo lasota: If they cashed ace diamonds, seems likely they were down more than 1; but its ok :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|leo lasota: nt definitely right sided based on club layout for E/W|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|leo lasota: tough break for Robinson, but 3nt will make now|pg||
nt|leo lasota: as pointed out by many kibs, this will likely still finish down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Garner asks about the lead "attitude in the context of the hand"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: king hearts, heart overtake then diamond queen and hope|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|leo lasota: b/c east hasd Jxx(xx) hearts, this will still go down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Garner asks about the @h 8 - standard carding|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Garner's only realistic hope is to win 4 hearts and 5 diamonds on friendly layouts; diamonds are, but hearts are not|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I beleive he'll play low and return @H king overtaking with ace|pg||
nt|leo lasota: So this will be 5 or 6 imps depending if he ends d1 or 2; well deserved by Fred for his decision not to open the North hand in the other room|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 5 or 7 imp[s|pg||
nt|leo lasota: expect him to overtake king hearts lead q diamonds finish d1|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I agree Leo|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c6|nt|penseur9:  seems the only logical play|pg||
nt|leo lasota: interesting though|pg||
nt|penseur9:  now going down a lot|pg||
nt|leo lasota: if he decided that J ghearts was definitely in opening leader|pg||
nt|leo lasota: then his cashing ace diamonds was only legit make (assuming opening leaders heart length was 4+)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: d3 now|pg||
nt|leo lasota: So this will end up slicing a big chunk off of Lee's lead |pg||
nt|penseur9:  so looks like 9 IMPs for Robertson team|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|penseur9:  now that's a switch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry - I don't know what the internet is doing, but it dumped me & I losst track of the play completely|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|c2|pg||

nt|leo lasota: No problem Jan :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we'll wait for the results now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think this is right - at least these are the cards left in dummy and this is consistent with who's been winning tricks|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Levin: "My best chance was if he underled the AK of hearts, but it's SO EARLY."|pg||
nt|bobh1: trump lead backfired on David|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Lew conceded a heart, and we're onto the next.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: (And there is light in here!  Thank you to the hotel engineer, who showed up with a powerful generator...)|pg||
nt|joest: obviously he thought the value of 'learning' who had the heart king exceeded the % of stiff queen with garner|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 1@c = 2+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2012/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16 shows who advances from today|pg||
nt|3for3:  do we have a result from 106?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell and Diamond play for the first time tomorrow|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 106..2H/S +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: I intended making 5, not sure if that is what shows up for everyone.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: unlucky 4s down 1 on 40 trump split here if defense untangles a diamond trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: the nonvulnerable 4333 takeout double.  Something increasing in popularity over the last few years|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d = hearts|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Not a very friendly for either side declaring here|pg||
nt|joest: everybody upgrades 19 HCP to 20 these days.  They started out with 2NT on the east cards in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: there are various interesting structures running around about how to respond here to a takeout double after RHO has acted.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|joest: Garner will double|pg||
mb|2C|nt|joest: to show three hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=2+@D  10-15 hcp|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: the trouble with a splinter is you are not likely to get cooperation (ie. too strong)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so now has to continue in some way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: He's rubbing his hands over his eyes and sighing.  So early for so much angst.|pg||
nt|bobh1: N might have opened|pg||
nt|joest: and Weinstein beats a fast retreat|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: i suppose he could bid 5@H now, saying lots of controls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S effectively the same, except should usually be spade void|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: which might have saved a partscore swing|pg||
nt|joest: now Garner must show extras and its not clear how|pg||
nt|joest: he might try 2NT (assuming that is natural)|pg||
nt|joest: or double (which is just a general good hand but not spades this good)|pg||
nt|3for3:  wow,no raise from Demirev?  Seems odd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or RDBL to show top honor  [ala Rosenkranz]|pg||
nt|bigtrain: his pass certainly puts extreme pressure on kit and fred|pg||
nt|3for3:  his partner is a passed hand, but....|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: really the hand depends on club holding, which is now revealed|pg||
nt|leo lasota: interesting that 3nt would have been tough to set as it would require diamond lead or king hearts, diamond shift to set; |pg||
nt|leo lasota: unluckily for N/S Peter's reasonable diamond lead allows contract to make here|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: 3@h is way too commital.  He doesn't know if Weinstein has five hearts.  2@h might have been a bid from desperation|pg||
nt|joest: 3@h is definitely a bid from desperation!  :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: probably end in 4@D'|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bobh1: no i guess u want to defend on this deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Jonathan brings the @D5 closest to thumb, then puts it back and goes with @HK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Very different auction than at the other table...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie confirms that 3@S was a splinter and 4@S was a cue.|pg||
nt|joest: this might (will) make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota: E/W did fair in the other room in declaring hearts to come home with 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter -- do you open North hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Carding asked, Stevie explains that the play suit preference usually at trick 1, otherwise standard count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their 1N opener 1st/2nd vul = 14-16, so bal 1@D=11-13|pg||
nt|bigtrain: optional in 1st...  in 2nd i pass|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bigtrain: i avoid crppy 11s when vul|pg||
nt|3for3:  If one opens all 11's, for sure.  If one opens most, this hand as a stray Qx, is 2d seat vul.  Not a great place for marginal action|pg||
pc|c4|nt|leo lasota: ace spades good safety play to make contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|leo lasota: small diamond helpful for E/W|pg||
nt|joest: so now they can cash their spade before it goes away but that means declarer gets two pitches on the spade and the diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what if swap  @CQ with @Sx ?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if white i open 110% or the time|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: that means use 1@D from your bidding box and your LHO|pg||
pc|s5|nt|leo lasota: down 1 it is|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2 imps for lee|pg||
nt|joest: can't this make?|pg||
nt|joest: up ace, ruff our the spade queen|pg||
nt|joest: reenter the dummy with teh heart atce|pg||
nt|joest: ace|pg||
nt|leo lasota: they have lost 2 tricks, now king clubs and 2 trumps|pg||
nt|joest: three pitches in all|pg||
nt|joest: no king of clubs|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|joest: ace of club|pg||
nt|leo lasota: correct|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: i think better was two top hearts then play clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: saving the spade ruffs for late dummy entries|pg||
nt|joest: king of spades spade ruff|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|d7|pc|s7|pg||

nt|leo lasota: unlucky opening lead, but very well played by weinstein|pg||
nt|joest: yes.  he had to lead a low club or somehow work out to lead the queen or ten of diamonds : somewhat double dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ACBL said that range was fine, but we couldn't use ANY conventions over it  [including stayman]|pg||
nt|bigtrain: so Qxx/AQ9x/QJxx/xx...  yes would open in 1st or 2nd vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: so weinstein gets a few back|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 14 HCP; good 5 card spade suit and 3 hearts|pg||

mb|1S|nt|joest: a standard problem for north|pg||
nt|joest: do you stayman or not?|pg||
nt|joest: Demiriev did at the other table|pg||
nt|leo lasota: good save in open room against 4h|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: N's hand doesn't fit into the usual parameters|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: It has been pointed out by several observers that the two Weinsteins make this a little hard to follow... we are watching Jonathan Weinstein, the captain of the Weinstein team.  At ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: the other table you can see Stevie Weinstein playing for Fleisher.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i wonder if 4m is a splinter or fit-showing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: so he chooses to show a limit raise, usualy 4 trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2NT is explained as invitational with hearts.  In response to Chip's questions, David writes, "usually four."|pg||
nt|bobh1: he probably intends to bid 4@C even if jonathan declines, which i dont think he will|pg||
nt|bobh1: most pairs play some kind of bromad after the double|pg||
nt|leo lasota: would be a 1nt consideration if the jack of diamonds was in another suit|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby commented afterwards that he should've flashed Andy his @HQ, perhaps he would've passed 4@H.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a little gamesmanship|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: But he didn't know that he should flash it to Andy instead of Franco.  Franco then launched into an explanation of the "fishhead coup," which it seems we can expect to see on ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Bridgewinners soon...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: S asking about 2@s bid now... can't read the answer but obviously liked it |pg||
nt|joest: Over a puppet call you have no inference partner has even four hearts so you're constrained to pass as south|pg||
nt|joest: now in your partnerships is double: (a) I have four spades or (b) takeout?  :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1nt by north is best|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C is 2nd choice|pg||
nt|3for3:  i think 2@C is the more mainstream bid with north's hand.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ugly |pg||
nt|3for3:  I prefer my 1nt to be a tad better than that...usually a decent 8-11|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C can be on 0,,,  best to show @S stop and constructive values|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: interesting decision to pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie: "Good thing it's only a 15-board segment."|pg||
nt|joest: I think 2NT is kind of practical here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Steve/Peter have reasonable methods for handling competition with their puppet auctions|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d seems like he has put the hand into game force mode to me but obviously I don't know |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: two rounds of hearts and three of spades for down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby confirms that they play upside-down count and attitude at trick 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gu gesticulating somewhat wildly with his hands to explain to Chip the meaning of 2@S.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: N trying to figure out what the right answer is...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: turns out N/S had a good club fit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Vugraphzfj: Andy pauses, Bobby apologizes for playing too fast.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 3@s is a bold bid|pg||
nt|joest: motivated by the colors no doubt|pg||
mb|3N|nt|leo lasota: motivated by the colors and the extra shape of 64 in the black suits|pg||
nt|joest: well so far their methods have not gotten them to mentions hearts.  |pg||
nt|leo lasota: and E/W will make 2h here in the 54 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: well done|pg||
nt|joest: highway robbery|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2 spades, ruff, and 2 diamonds for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Gu asks about leads: 4th|pg||
nt|leo lasota: appears peter maybe should have taken a call over 3s |pg||
nt|joest: perhaps he thought pass was forcing.  Or perhaps he should just hit it with AQx of spades and take at least some plus|pg||
nt|joest: in 'standard' it might just go stayman, 2@s, 3@h on the assumption partner has four hearts, and then 4@h|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I believe that dbl by robinson after 1nt-p-2c-2s-p-p- would have shown dblton spade|pg||
nt|joest: a good agreement.   Wonder what 2Nt would have been.  In any event, this is not an auction you see every day and even the best of pairs might not see it eye-to-eye|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3:  woolsey got nt from the right side.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: about five minutes.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i see we have not missed much|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the key here is to play spades so north does not imply a heart doubleton|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart queen an automatic false card from Qxx|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1:  108 [3@DX=]  Garner in 3N North on @H5 lead|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|joest: probably strongest was for Robinson to voertake the diamond and play a trump through.  Not the easiest play though|pg||
nt|leo lasota: now will make 3 as peter elected to try for a club switch rather than continue spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphzfj: ... and we're caught up.  As you may know if you've been following this afternoon, our connection has been sketchy at best.|pg||

nt|leo lasota: rather than ruff club right away, correct play here is ace and a heart to setup queen before ruffing club|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: I foresee east-west in a tenuous 3@s here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: meaning he tabled the dummy correctly :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is resembling the second quarter of the knicks game yesterday|pg||

nt|3for3:  big @C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest: Flannery to the rescue|pg||
nt|leo lasota: flannery|pg||
nt|leo lasota: only slight downgrade by steve with 16; very reasonable 4522, especially non vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
mb|p|an|0-6/7|nt|fabsayc: with system on redouble forces 3@C to get out in either minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: To clarify, the defense did not play three rounds of spades.  After the first spade, Franco shifted to a club.|pg||
nt|joest: double by Weinstein would be pretty aggressive in my view at these colors|pg||
nt|leo lasota: steve/peter aggressive 1 minor openers; |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry in this situation 16+/18+|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Vugraphzfj: 1@S is not a misclick.  David slightly atilt.|pg||
nt|joest: I'm not sure the risk-reward ratio stands up|pg||
nt|leo lasota: always a big win for flannery when you can steal the pot in 2h on 9 card fit|pg||
nt|leo lasota: steve transfers to hearts|pg||
nt|3for3:  5@C looks like it will be the spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Providing the otherwise unattainable second hook.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Chip asks about the double: "T/o."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2h = 4 with complete min by peter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: But Bobby did not read the position.  Still shaking his head.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bigtrain: 5@C is a productive save|pg||
nt|3for3:  woolsey plays his doubles of 4@S more penalty oriented than any other expert I know of..|pg||
nt|3for3:  which explains why he didn't double cards/takeout here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is hand/shape good enough for DBL?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|leo lasota: 2 of 3 finesses onside|pg||
nt|leo lasota: nice result here making 620 for N/S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: sheesh|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very undiscplined auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie calls the director.  There is some confusion over what Franco's second double showed.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Shi conferring again with Lew about 2@H, his eyebrows furrowed...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter already feeling very good about contract after lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: correction bd 94..2H +1|pg||
nt|leo lasota: from his perspective, he needs either ace diamond or ace spade onside now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont blame him for trying 1@S in that situation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah  again  Danny's comment made while i was typing :(|pg||
nt|3for3:  i think it is|pg||
nt|3for3:  i type faster :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 4 tricks to me [until seeing dummy] -- and if partner pulls a mostly penalty double -- it will be to make|pg||
nt|3for3:  will lee get the spades right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i ramble more|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: at the other table Demirev also 'downgraded' to 2@d flannery|pg||
nt|joest: but over 2@h he came one more time with 2NT and that was one time too many|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|bigtrain: no|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: "Good luck."  "Thank you."|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: Lee did that only to justify the NS bidding|pg||
nt|3for3:  it pays to type slow so you can see what happens!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Okay, so the director call: Sol Weinstein came in, but keboshed the call over a hesitation on Stevie's side of the screen.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The first sigh of the session from Shi...|pg||
nt|bigtrain: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 108 finally finished in other room  3N -1|pg||
mc|8|nt|leo lasota: yes, but he then felt nervous about downgrade and bid again over partner's 2h call|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: I would have thought that was much more true of matchpoints :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|leo lasota: this requires 22 trumps or picking up hearts for 3 tricks or remote possibility of scoring up the queen of clubs (like AK dblton being ruffed out)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|leo lasota: Fred elected for 6D close out bid in other room|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Chance for nice 13 imp pickup for Lee if Garner/Weinstein bid the grand|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|leo lasota: But Weinstein signs off in 6D also, so no gain for either team|pg||
nt|penseur9:  oportunity missed|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: doesn't have a doubleton spade or doubleton heart. Very complicated play hand in 7, so we should be grateful they didn't arrive there and get even farther behind!|pg||

nt|3for3:  did he go down 2?|pg||
nt|3for3:  good slam|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|joest: We might see a 4NT rebalance by Boyd here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: from west's perspective, he needs 2 of top 3 trumps from p and side card for slam to be good, or AKQ trumps|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 16 opp 11|pg||
nt|3for3:  good grand even|pg||

nt|joest: yes, all in teh hand of a nonvulnerable premptor|pg||
nt|leo lasota: too naroow a target; I agree with 4 S|pg||
nt|leo lasota: narrow|pg||
nt|joest: Qx is a terrible holding to keep bidding with.  I think Boyd did well to give up|pg||
nt|leo lasota: touchy game contracts here, but 3nt makes with wither J10 dblton or tripleton of spades, or king hearts onside, as it is here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C relay   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for  shape and range|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: "Is the 9 anything?" Bobby: "Could be..." Franco: "KQJ?"|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: ... a few minutes pass.  "In retrospect, that seems obvious."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Ah yes - 3f3 suggests lebensohl (nat+values), which seems right, long explanation though|pg||
nt|joest: this lead will cause spades to get ripped from the top|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|leo lasota: ace hearts onside|pg||

nt|3for3:  A quick 1390 and a missed chance|pg||
pc|h4|nt|leo lasota: with Jxx spades and 10xxx clubs, from peter's perspective this is a hand he needs to make an attacking lead against 3nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota: hence the diamond lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Vugraphzfj: Gu puts down the screen to ask about the range on 1NT by Lew, now they're good to go.|pg||

nt|bobh1: @C lead was better...a lot of trump leads this quarter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: demirev stepped out|pg||
nt|leo lasota: cash king spade and then cash one high spade from dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 1 min break|pg||
nt|leo lasota: using clubs as transportation|pg||
nt|leo lasota: before playing heart up, see if he is fortunate enough to find the spades coming in|pg||
nt|leo lasota: undfortunately for him, he cannot afford to cash all 3 spades, as this would mean 3 diamonds, 1 heart, 1 spade for the defense if the J10 spades do not both come down|pg||

nt|ahollan1: when seeing how 2@D is played in other parts of the world, it is a shame that ACBL-land refers to this as Multi  even though only 1 hand type [weak 2M opener]|pg||
mb|3H|an|pass/correct|nt|leo lasota: weak nt, some heart raise or GF hand in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true multi includes at least 1 strong hand type|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2@S is some sort of minor preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ACBL/USBF events  pairs that play "multi" are obligated to provide their opponents with a copy of the ACBL's Defense to Multi|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfj: "Good luck."  "Thank you."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Fleisher described 3NT as 'not discussed'|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: but meant it for minors, of course|pg||
nt|leo lasota: perhaps still in shock from prev bd|pg||
nt|joest: actually a 2@c rebid is not all that bad.  Pairs need to decide if that is natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: hence the ultra conservative view|pg||
nt|joest: to me 2@s is ultra-conservative, yes|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter's 1nt = 11-14 with less than 4 spades, 1, 2, or 3 hearts|pg||
nt|leo lasota: if 3 hearts, he has less than 5 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: robinson therefore passes 1nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota: another rule in play when deciding whether to rebid hearts or pass 1nt\|pg||
nt|leo lasota: with 5 card maj|pg||
nt|leo lasota: with decent 9 or 10, just pass and partner usually will be able to scramble 1nt on power|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: http://web2.acbl.org/defensedatabase/3b.htm|pg||
nt|bigtrain: team events only...  totally banned in pairs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: over 2@d, if partner preferences to 2@s, you can now bid 3@s and south will accept with the hand he has.  One possible auction|pg||
nt|leo lasota: friendly start for peter|pg||
nt|leo lasota: low club shift at trick 2 seems apparent from east hand when j diamond holds|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter reasonable will split club KQ; if he does get low club shift and he finds duck from hand, that would be amazing|pg||
nt|3for3:  don't get me started on that|pg||
nt|3for3:  3@Sx would not have been pretty.  Demirev had no losing options|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: NS play 2@S as preempt in @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D also preempt in @D but weaker hand than 2@S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bobh1: he might have tried 2N, which is probably a serious game try|pg||
nt|joest: but no question it is a tough rebid|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|leo lasota: usually the toughest hands to play are the ones that come immediately after a clear mistake has been made by you and your partner|pg||
nt|joest: yes.  You have to be good at putting those out of your mind|pg||
nt|joest: As Hamman says, "I assure you, they are not dealing you that hand again"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: exactly|pg||
pc|c8|pc|sJ|nt|bobh1: a dearth of tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  110  5@C-1 so 3 imps to Robinson|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|jdonn:  west's 2@H bid was a relay to 2@S showing either hearts or game forcing balanced, a convention called kokish|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|leo lasota: knocking out dummy's entries in diamonds is reasonable choice by nikolay as well|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: they're bidding the slam hand now|pg||

pc|s8|nt|3for3:  chance for garner weinstein to open up some room for LEE|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|jdonn:  the 3@C bid showed just hearts (whereas 3@H would have shown hearts and clubs). That switch is to make room for a "waiting" 3@D bid when opener has just hearts|pg||
nt|joest: headed to three overtricks|pg||

nt|leo lasota: great result of +100 for E/W, even though N/S had 12 opposite 10 in 1nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter considering his options here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: only way he may go down 2 is if he plays club to hand heart up, defense will take the rest|pg||
nt|leo lasota: if he plays spade up here, he is down 1|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|penseur9:  good point  about not worrying about time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I didn't see an alert on 2@h but Feldman just told Weinstein to wait a moment and then wrote something - don't know what|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: do E/W play transfers over 1d-2C, or was the auction really 1d-2c-2s?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: did it really go 2H -p-p?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  since the players not worried about the time, maybe Jan can take a 2 minute bathroom break :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The time rules do say that it is inappropriate use of time to play for overtricks. Also on the last hand, declarer could have stated his line of play and if an overtrick was going ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: to develop they would tell him whether it did. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, it really went 2@h P P - look at my note above.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: too bad for Robinson|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Feldman says "I told them I did not think this was a transfer by a passed hand" Pollack hasn't corrected him, so probably thinks it was his error|pg||

nt|joest: not so clear to get there|pg||

nt|leo lasota: NF constructive|pg||
nt|joest: I play it 100% forcing|pg||
nt|joest: rightly or wrongly it solves a lot of problems|pg||
nt|3for3:  3@C intermediate jump 'overcall'?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest: 2NT = "good/bad"  "I am just competing in clubs"|pg||
nt|joest: now it will be difficult to find the spade suit at all|pg||
nt|joest: and to me this goes back to the failure (or inability) to bid 1@son the first round|pg||
nt|joest: but they might recover.  Let's see|pg||
nt|3for3:  whatever it is woolsey won't be interested|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- natural|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  passed hand wide ranged|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: if declarer can avoid 3 trump losers he can make 4@S|pg||
nt|jdonn:  east's 1nt bid instead of double is surely influenced by the fact that north didn't really promise diamonds apparantly|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it looks like NS have 9 tricks on the fly here if they find them, which i think they will|pg||
nt|jdonn:  north may have to think about it, the 6 of hearts could be low from a better holding. but i still think he finds the diamond switch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i didn't think it would be hand that is this good|pg||
nt|bigtrain: pretty darn good:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: Peetr had the option of bidding 1S last time, but chose to show the 3 card LR in diamonds instead|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|leo lasota: back to Steve's first bid|pg||
nt|joest: but bidding 1@s doesn't preclude finding diamonds.  Bidding 2@c makes it harder to find spades|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter had an alternative option on his last bid|pg||
nt|leo lasota: dbl would have been snapdragon, normally showing a dblton spade and 5+ hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right Walter   Woolsey is passed hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 3C/N "to play"|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: with solid opening bid, honor 3rd of both majors, dbl with 3361 was reasonable alternative to 1D|pg||
nt|joest: just my opinion though.  Many others disagree|pg||
pc|c8|nt|leo lasota: peter reasonably decided to just raise spades since opponents have announce the hand is theirs on power by opening and making a free bid of 2d|pg||
nt|leo lasota: this makes it easy for steve should they end up on defense, plus gives steve the option of bidding spades again with extra shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the problem is  if you start with DBL  subsequent @C bids sound artificial|pg||
nt|bigtrain: best to plaay 2@C overcalls as natural|pg||
nt|bigtrain: solves all these problems of bidding over the BS 1@C|pg||
nt|3for3:  and 2@D as michaels?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 2+@C   Stewart 2@C would also be natural|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but over 3+@C  2@C=michaels|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i prefer 2@C natural  2@D michaels and 3@C as suer michaels|pg||
nt|bigtrain: super|pg||
nt|3for3:  3@D as super natural? :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no i like 2@C natural over any 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  111  final contract 6@D North|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfj: Jan Martel, who makes the Vugraph happen, has given me an alternative wireless network to try if we get disconnected again.  So the next shutdown (which hopefully will not happen) ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: will be longer if it does.  Sorry again for all the interruptions...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Shi asks Lew how weak their style can be.  Lew says usually six, can be five if something else to go with it.|pg||
nt|joest: Doubling three clubs here should be an option to save. I don't think you double to hear your own voice|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "Good luck."  "Thank you."|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfj: Another swing here one way or another... looks down on the lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota: great decision by peter of 3S here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: another success from peter';s bid|pg||
nt|leo lasota: fooled west into believing that his partner did not hold more than 2 spades|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|leo lasota: this will be down 2; excellent score, well deserved for peter/steve|pg||
pc|hA|nt|leo lasota: very nice|pg||
nt|joest: I wonder how it would have went had garner bid 4@c instead of doubling? :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|bobh1: he did it|pg||
nt|bobh1: still some work to do|pg||
nt|bobh1: a @H now|pg||

nt|joest: garner needs to hop ace and switch to a heart to hold this to 4|pg||
nt|leo lasota: y|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|joest: so at the other table, north-south took a minus in 5@d. could not avoid one club + one heart + one spade so a big pickup coming for the Robinson team|pg||

mb|p|nt|jdonn:  south opens 2C so they seem to be playing precision, that shows a minimum opener with long clubs|pg||
nt|leo lasota: relatively dull hand here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 11 HCP is usually a 1H opener for robinson here, but red all with 3 of the points as stiff king he has to ponder whether to open|pg||
nt|leo lasota: as is their style, he takes the aggressive view and opens|pg||
nt|leo lasota: almost certain this will result in excellent 6C contract|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jdonn:  and west's double instead of 2S is really interesting|pg||
nt|jdonn:  2S may not be totally safe but i think the double is weird anyway|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby asks about the 9, and Andy explains that it's Rusinow.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D can be very weak    2@S as good as just below opening bid|pg||

pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzfj: Franco confirms that the NT range is 14+-17, which it is.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfj: Interesting 1N here|pg||
nt|jdonn:  north bids 2S, it looks kind of normal but I much prefer 1S since the defense is very good and it would be a great dummy for hearts|pg||
nt|leo lasota: At these colors, Peter may just pass when east shows the majors, despite being 55|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2+@D, max 15 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  you much prefer to preempt with a suit like KQJxxx than AT9xxx|pg||

mb|3N|nt|bobh1: transfer to @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  it sure looks right, but a lot of people are reluctant to bid 5 over 5|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if one of north's heart was in clubs NS might even make 5S, so it's hard to see not doing it|pg||
nt|jdonn:  also, suppose south wasnt planning to bid 5S on his own here, then he should have bid 4D instead of 4S so that north might bid 5S if it was right|pg||
nt|leo lasota: king diamonds unfortunate lead by steev|pg||
nt|leo lasota: can now make 3 for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  that way north would know to defend with short diamonds and bid with long diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  here it didnt matter a lot since south is always bidding on to 5|pg||

nt|ahollan1: comments on 2N please|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jdonn:  he will probably just defend with his strength opposite an opening hand and opponents having been pushed up, but you can never be sure|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the other table took a flyer at 6C, they didnt even get pushed there|pg||
nt|jdonn:  some days it's right, not today though|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: att|pg||
nt|ahollan1: attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't quote me, but i think Woolsey's spot was standard count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  upside-down attitude, just not sure after Q wins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Danny, Walter  do you have rules about whether 3rd hand shows count or attitude here?|pg||
nt|3for3:  attitude|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfj: Stark is not entirely sure about the bid here|pg||
nt|jdonn:  and east does the right thing this time|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jdonn:  so it's certainly down 1 with down 2 possible|pg||

nt|leo lasota: higher % then leading low diamond toweards jack|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Bathroom break..|pg||
nt|joest: you can cross to the heart and play a diamond to the ten|pg||
nt|leo lasota: which works if guesses robinson for honor x or peter for KQ(xx)|pg||

nt|joest: or KQxx|pg||
nt|leo lasota: diamond to ten only gains on KQ both in peter hand or honor x|pg||
nt|leo lasota: way against the odds with steve having marked clubs|pg||
nt|joest: I'm trying to weigh that % vs spades 33|pg||
nt|leo lasota: honor dblton from peter's hand that is|pg||
nt|leo lasota: definitely xcorrect tio cash one high spade first|pg||
nt|joest: and if lho drops an honor?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: then he has tro decide to bang or play heart to ace and spade to 9|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|3for3:  taking early heart hook seems against the odds.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jdonn:  so this does come down to how declarer plays the diamond suit|pg||
nt|jdonn:  and he has a real chance to go right, he will see east is 2-2 in the majors and probably has 5 clubs given west's bidding|pg||
nt|leo lasota: wow nice smooth duck diamond; now makes 4!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|leo lasota: his play best|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jdonn:  but also declarer might not want to go for 500 but taking a deep finesse in diamonds, so it's a tough call|pg||
nt|jdonn:  there is a lot riding on this in such a close match|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if declarer is going to finesse for the jack he has to start doing it on the first round, leading to the king first isn't good enough|pg||
nt|jdonn:  then east's remaining AJ8 would prevent a third trick from developing|pg||
pc|h8|nt|leo lasota: cash second spade see jack, then ace diamond diamond|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
mc|9|nt|jdonn:  and declarer decides not to risk 500|pg||

nt|leo lasota: very likely to go down in 3nt; would take excellent card reading to make|pg||
nt|joest: I suspect it will go 2@d-3@d-3@s-3NT from here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2 of either major guarantees 5+, but normally shows a minor of 4+ as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  115  it did go 3@D-4@D   but same final  4@S East|pg||
nt|3for3:  22 with 6 to go, and 2 vul games in the bank for lee.  Robinson needs a swing quickly.|pg||

mb|2D|nt|joest: i suspect wrong :)|pg||
nt|joest: oh maybe I wasn't that wrong :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter's 2nt showed stoppers; bal hand; may result in great 3nt making for him|pg||
nt|joest: three boards to go after this one for those who have asked|pg||
nt|leo lasota: steve elects to pass it out with the 3523 distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i guess 4@H|pg||
nt|jdonn:  a spade lead will be very normal but not the best start for the defense|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Vugraphzfj: As some of the other tables finish up, it's getting a little noisy outside.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Robinson sets diamonds in 44 fit now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@H asks  3@S [lo] = 4441@C    then 3N regressive and ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie is contemplating his bidding box.  On the other side of the screen, Bobby is running his fingers through his hair, rehashing a previous hand in his head.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Hopefully not enough to distract our heroes.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 1nt will make here at least for E/W|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jdonn:  declarer will put in the 10 from dummy and be off to a good start|pg||
nt|jdonn:  3NT went down at the other table on a heart lead, north had risked a 1H overcall|pg||
nt|jdonn:  so there is a good chance of a swing here|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i was just asked why south would lead low instead of the queen from this holding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: NS play sort of upsidedown smith|pg||
nt|jdonn:  against notrump you want to develop the length in your suit so the honor is very valuable, if partner has a singleton or doubleton A K or T then if you start with low the suit won't be blocked|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if south had QJT or QJ9 he would risk the honor but anything worse than that low is more normal in notrump|pg||
nt|jdonn:  against a suit contract south would normally lead the queen, now as long as anyone has a doubleton you don't want to blow a fast trick|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i dont really see 3nt going down here as long as he puts in the 10 of spades|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter has 3 keys plus q |pg||
nt|3for3:  undo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh immediate regressive 3N|pg||
nt|3for3:  really regressive when the opponents bid it :)|pg||
nt|3for3:  feldman pollack played a 32 fit on 114 to hand LEE 8 imp's|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  even if he starts clubs with an honor, holding himself to 2 tricks there, he can get the last trick in hearts and the defense can't do anything|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but he already showed his extras with 2nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 10 spades my choice against 3nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: tx|pg||
nt|3for3:  Yes, it appears that Pollack was transferring and Feldman though it didnt apply (PH)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: flip-flop Woolsey's minors -- discouraging 3N seems wrong|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: There is a lot of deep sighing and head-scratching going on.  It's been that kind of set.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: steve would have to find small heart shift here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: to hold to one|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  116 [3NW=]  Garner playing 1@C North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that what you were talking about Danny?|pg||
nt|3for3:  no i was talking 114,the OTHER 32 fit!|pg||
nt|3for3:  1@C looks like 3 off...so 7 imps give or take to LEE|pg||
mb|6D|nt|jdonn:  he didn't put in the spade ten, very interesting|pg||
nt|joest: well for starters, it's not clear Boyd will read this as being from shortness and recognize Garner as the danger hand|pg||
nt|joest: seems to me Boyd needs to guess quite well to roll this in|pg||
nt|leo lasota: reason 10 spades may be better; give south Kx spades and north J9x|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Not so much from Andy and Franco.  When things got rough, Franco ate a banana.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: now Garner-Weinstein play Rusinow so this is already somewhat odd|pg||
nt|joest: with the appearance of the king in dummy|pg||
nt|3for3:  true, Fred must have heard me say good 6@D...|pg||
nt|3for3:  which it would be, other than the 2 losers|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Lee is calling the director..for the pause by Kit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he should just take his plus score|pg||
nt|3for3:  if the diamonds were the other way around, declarer could guess them.  of course he could play for stiff king in west too|pg||
nt|3for3:  1@C went down 4, so 5 to Lee|pg||
nt|3for3:  if south took time to bid 4@D, that would suggest he was considering passing 3nt, certainly doesnt make bashing a slam more attractive|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobh1: same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|leo lasota: right; 3 card or less|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jdonn:  i'm not sure what east was playing for, QJ doubleton is unlikely so maybe north to make a mistake with something like Q8 doubleton?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 120|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jdonn:  however east has recovered by getting clubs right so now he can play on hearts and he is fine|pg||
nt|joest: garner cannot afford to cover this|pg||
nt|leo lasota: still just 8|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 3 d, 2c, 2s, 1h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: a cover leads to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: good play|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: More sighing...|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the raise to 2S is a bit weird, south could have passed 1S since he knows they don't have game values, now north might think he is good enough to bid again and get too high|pg||
nt|leo lasota: or peter may just have his aggressive nature for today :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: J - Rus|pg||
nt|joest: i see only 8 tricks at the moment|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 8 is the limit, especially with garner holding 2 entries in hearts|pg||
nt|joest: his legit line is to win in hand and play two clubs up, hoping for diamond in the slot|pg||
nt|joest: or at least that is a simple line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 117  other room also 6@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jdonn:  he is probably just trying to keep the opponents out, but he probably already had|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfj: For whomever asked earlier, the Rex Stout book that Chip is reading is "Three for the Chair."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: should definitely win trick 1 in hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota: rule of 7 applicable in deciding whetehr % is to duck or win|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jdonn:  and here we have it, this shows why passing 1S is a good idea once you know you don't belong in game|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|leo lasota: lucky 3nt here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|leo lasota: makes b/c west has king spades, q clubs, and he has only singleton or dblton spade king|pg||
nt|leo lasota: robinson will of course cash one high club after ducking 2 hearts|pg||
nt|leo lasota: in case he sees the stiff q|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|jdonn:  and even worse|pg||
nt|leo lasota: when protectign against 52 break|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jdonn:  lee holds hearts over the 1H response, and enough trumps and overall strength that he risks a double and it will pay off for him|pg||
nt|leo lasota: however, suit was marked 61 on auction|pg||
nt|leo lasota: then plays to dummy's ace diamonds and leads j spades playing for K or Kx in West, then reenters dummyin spades, takes club finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting how 117 could have been a swing hand for Woolsey  if he had NOT bid over 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or stopped in 5@D -- but never tried to figure out if you can make 5 when only trying for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|3for3:  both pairs failed to use KC for @D's, which would have kept them out of the poor slam|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jdonn:  this is a great trump lead i think, partner probably has hearts to double here so if EW take out the trumps then NS will be very short on tricks|pg||
nt|jdonn:  since east has the minors locked up|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|leo lasota: fairly lucky to escape with 8 tricks her with the Qxx diamonds|pg||
nt|leo lasota: even though it is true he would have had 9 with same diamond holding plus the ace club onside|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jdonn:  that's another plus to the double, not only do you increase your score but you help partner make a good lead|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the other table shows exactly how i think the auction should have gone|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jdonn:  lee will win this diamond and play another trump, then win either a heart or a diamond overruff, declarer is just in big trouble here|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzfj: Just disconnected briefly, have not missed anything.  Andy in the tank.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie consults the convention card again: "All right."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: There appears to be some sort of sighing contest between Bobby and Stevie.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "You're jack leads are standard, right?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "Yep."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "He DID lead the jack, right?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "I don't remember."|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Danny -- do you know if the bracket is already set or do they shuffle again tonight?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|3for3:  bracket is set|pg||
nt|3for3:  no reshuffle, no picking, etc.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|leo lasota: nice to gain 3 imps when saving in 3nt against 2 maj other table|pg||
nt|leo lasota: :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|3for3:  iirc the winner here plays Fleisher|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|jdonn:  this heart play was harmless since declarer can't get to dummy to ruff any more hearts in hand|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i think this will be down 3|pg||
nt|leo lasota: his choice of plays not best|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|leo lasota: should have pitched diamond from dummy cashed ace clubs then duiamond over spade|pg||
nt|3for3:  jacobs vs diamond|pg||
nt|3for3:  nickell vs spector|pg||
mc|10|nt|3for3:  and mahaffey vs milner|pg||

mb|2D|an|natural|nt|leo lasota: 4h here by south; north will continually rejct any forward going moves by south for slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2 more bds to go before we break for lunch..Seg 7/8 scheduled to start 3:45 CDT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm opening daily bulletin now -- can confirm or correct|pg||
mb|2S|an|Non-forcing|nt|jdonn:  it would be most straightforward in notrump, though if they stumble into a red suit they will be fine|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: There seems to be a misunderstanding about Lew's double.  Gu just asked Chip if it showed clubs, and Chip said yes.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: in about 1  hr|pg||
nt|joest: now B-R may well play some form of 'serious 3NT" here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: a little surprised robinson did not make 4h "fast arrival"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: likely N/S end in 3S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Chip had pulled 2@H out of the box, then changed his mind and tried 2@D.|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: requires diamond lead to set 3S|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2nt by peter is 4+ spades; LR+|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfj: Shi wrote something about 3@C, but sadly my eyesight does not extend so far.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: ... and we're caught up again, minus some of the pesky details.  Last board this set, hopefully the next will bring us better luck.|pg||
nt|joest: some play that denies side suit controls|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2H was GF, promising 5+|pg||
nt|leo lasota: the fats arrival 100% denies 4 controls|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jdonn:  the other table made 7 by sneaking the club over early|pg||
pc|s3|nt|leo lasota: fast|pg||
nt|joest: depending on if they play 'serious 3NT", then 4@c is a very constructive slam try|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 3nt would have been non serious slam try; 4C was serious|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 4h rejects|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it pretty much will come down to north inviting slam and south accepting|pg||
nt|jdonn:  this 3D bid is weird with two ltitle diamonds and all the strength in the majors, i thought after 3C it would go 3NT 4NT 6NT or so|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now it comes down to agreements and style, but obviously north will move forward somehow|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: some pairs play that it's so constructive north would be compelled to Q the diamond king here|pg||
nt|joest: anyway they arrive in the right spot; now make it!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfj: At this point, I'm not sure I can reliably enter all the results for the preceding hands, so we may have to wait on the official score.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sol, the director, comes in to remind the players that they are in overtime.  Franco says yes, they know.|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it's not clear whether 4NT is rkc or a quantitative invite|pg||
nt|jdonn:  some partnerships would play 4nt is natural inviting slam, and if north wants to bid rkc for diamonds he has to set them as trumps by bidding 4d first|pg||
pc|s8|nt|leo lasota: certainly the 1nt bid by east slows down game possibilities from Peter's perspective|pg||
nt|leo lasota: good result here for N/S of +140|pg||
nt|leo lasota: cash both hearts duck club|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jdonn:  even now it's not clear, if south is accepting the slam invitation he might just be showing a good heart suit|pg||
nt|joest: well that lead won't make it harder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Milner over Wolfson  285-220|pg||
pc|s2|nt|leo lasota: quick push here at 450 likely|pg||
nt|leo lasota: playing imps, lead low trump out of hand here is reasonable|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jdonn:  it might also be showing keycards, some play that if you accept the slam invitation you show keycards anyway|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|leo lasota: exactly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our other table on board 118  where they are also playing 5@HX|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|jdonn:  south converts 6D to 6NT since he can't see much reason to play in diamonds, which makes you wonder why he bid 3D in the first place|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i think the reason was in case his partner could bid 3H he would want to play in 4H|pg||
nt|jdonn:  that is actually not unreasonable|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jdonn:  lee goes for the glory on lead but today it just leads to a push|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if dummy had KJ of clubs it was the only card in his hand to give him a chance to set|pg||
nt|jdonn:  this shouldnt take long to play|pg||

nt|3for3:  ok last board now..|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Director tells the players that they will not have any time between sessions.  "Fine with me."|pg||
nt|jdonn:  I'm talking to myself, plus all the comments from the spectators hitting me that I can't really reply to, those are like the voices in my head. So pretty much I feel like a crazy person|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 1H - P - 4H would put West in alot of pressure|pg||
mb|1S|an|5|nt|jdonn:  this last board seems like a straightforward 4S, but things might get a little interesting with trumps 5-0|pg||
nt|jdonn:  declarer can make it anyway although in practice it's very easy to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  2D here is some kind of heart raise, I think EW play transfers on this auction|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it looks like EW have at least 4 tricks, a club 2 diamonds and a trump|pg||
nt|jdonn:  but if declarer never plays trumps at all he can score 2 hearts, a club, and 7 trumps by ruffing back and forth|pg||
nt|leo lasota: But now Robinson is guessing with his 55 as well|pg||
nt|3for3:  Lee ready to advance to the round of 8 against Fleisher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: check bbo schedule to see start times for observer's timezone   http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
mb|2S|an|3|nt|jdonn:  if he plays even one round then east can win a club and play a second round|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: good decision to bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Kamil trying to figure out if he should bid...|pg||
nt|jdonn:  then it would be hard|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2h here for weinstein will be final contract|pg||
nt|leo lasota: dbl by west ends auction|pg||
nt|3for3:  Thanks to the spex, the VG people, Al, and BBO for the show|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Again, the 10 is Rusinow.|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: even though peter has his bidding shoes on today, would be silly to balance here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Flannery|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally the agreement is 1@S = 5+@S OR  4@S that wants to hear raise on 3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfj: That's it for this session, thanks all for your patience!|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the risk of a ruff somewhere is probably greater than the risk of a 5-0 trump break plus both diamonds being off, i think it would be hard to blame declarer if he goes down here|pg||
nt|jbgood: same lead as in the OR|pg||
nt|leo lasota: likely only d1|pg||
nt|3for3:  strangely making a comeback.  Maybe it was Steve Weinstein saying he LOVES ir|pg||
nt|3for3:  it|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  119  Feldman playing 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  as does Bart Bramley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: however Bart won't be playing that in his new partnership with Lew Stansby -- i believe they'll be playing a form of Precision|pg||
nt|3for3:  Interesting...Lew has been playing weak nt/std for all these years with Chip|pg||
nt|3for3:  Big club is gaining with each new partnership formed, it seems.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i recall somebody called  martel-stansby system   timid ks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfj: Making a bad situation worse...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jdonn:  this will be won by east who will probably switch to a heart|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bobh1: the ever popular trump lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota: spade, club shift?|pg||
nt|joest: club shift wiill beat it|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jdonn:  settnig up a trick if partner had KJ over declarer's queen|pg||
nt|leo lasota: easy for peter|pg||
nt|joest: very nice d|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: a di switch at the other table..|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now declarer might play a diamond|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the less trumps he plays, the better|pg||
nt|3for3:  among those playing 'standard' transfers over a usually balanced club, and unbalanced diamond is gaining as well|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|jdonn:  heart continuation|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jdonn:  or might west play more diamonds? it's not unthinkable but i think he will continue hearts|pg||
nt|jdonn:  he fooled me before though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|leo lasota: correct play by steve for d1|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfj: Franco tells Andy, who had gone for a bathroom break and returned after the hand was played, that they made 3, but "that the club lead was important."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The bathroom is conveniently located in the same room.  We are in individual hotel rooms.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Short break here, I will need a CC from one of the players to update the scores before we can go on with our broadcast. Sho|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: *Short intermission :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jdonn:  and he has done it again by making the only play i didnt predict. maybe that was risky if declarer had a singleton club|pg||
pc|c8|nt|leo lasota: establish 1 spade trick for 8 trumps, 1 spade, 1 diamond = down 1|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: weren't garner-weinstein  [NS in the other room]  the first to adopt that in ACBL-land?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now he might make it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: a short (10 min) break after bd 75..before the next segment|pg||
