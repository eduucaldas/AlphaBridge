nt|nilsland:  3 N woukd be better if you have the @HA|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|bigtrain: the prob;em lies in not THIS specific hand but what will generally be best|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: thats why 3NT on the last board is a standout to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Well, with Kx of @H 3NT is unlikely to make|pg||
nt|nilsland:  After preempts in general 3 NT is often better than looking for a major - I agree|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bigtrain: why partner holds KJxxx in clubs for instance|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: like Mats said, Ax is a completely different thing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thats not the point...  with a @H stopper this is your last chance to bid what may be the only making game|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Aces are normally better for suit play but after a preempt you want to be able to duck . to keep the long suit out of play|pg||

nt|petka:  I am told that 2S is a bit too cautious in NS system. They tend to bid 3 with full values and 4card support|pg||
