nt|Vugraphzfb: I don't really know that Cohler led the club K - but it seemed to be on the bottom of his pile of played cards :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|runnerup:  7 tricks and 5 top losers -so 2nt had some sort of play but didn't make |pg||
mb|3C!|an|!h raise|nt|bigtrain: well deserved may i say|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes -cards layd well and @c blocked -too high ofcause but sometimes you have to open that high|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ns makes 9 and ew only 8 in they main suits -but lets see -3 @h -1 is ok -like other table|pg||
nt|jbgood: I guess our operator par excellence is busy trying to get other operators going - doubt anyone at this table has a reason to still be in the tank|pg||
nt|athene: no i am sure it's gone pass 3@H pass pass pass already|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell has a sort of decision on lead, but small spade looks normal|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in both last boards ns made 1 trick more than here to get 7+6 in|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: wow|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell respect 2nd seat weak 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is Moysian|pg||
nt|jbgood: a lead director against 4 @h? or really serious? or just a shot?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thus they NEVER open with a 5-card suit in second seat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cohler accidentally dropped both the spade 10 and the spade 8 onto the table. The director tells him that he can now play either of them and the other card is a penalty card - if ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: it's an honor, it's a major penalty card, if it's not, it's a minor penalty card.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cohler chooses to play the spade 10 and so the spade 8 is now a minor penalty card and if Cohler is playing a spade he must play the 8 in preference to any other spot card|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: 3@S a lead director, prepared to play 4minor, i guess|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok -just our national name -easier to pronaus here|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  hello|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: North has the minors (2NT) so 3@c usually heart support + values (and you can use 3@d to show spades) |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||

nt|athene: will he think it is worth upgrading?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the infamous nebulous diamond 1@D = 2+ 10-15|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck: "I needed a spade lead" Rodwell: "they make 3@h" Meck: "not if you lead a spade ... didn't have to make the bid ... I wanted to beat 4@h, that's for sure"|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|runnerup:  ew can compete on 3 level here|pg||
nt|athene: both red tens worth a huge amount in those suits|pg||
nt|athene: @DAJ106 worth about half a trick more than @DAJ62|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|bigtrain: 14-16 1NT|pg||
nt|jbgood: ideal hand for stayman - you just pass prds rebid|pg||
nt|athene: i am not even sure that hand is a minimum 14-16 notrump|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: KNR values it as 14.80|pg||
nt|runnerup:  on a good day even 4 @h makes |pg||
nt|athene: now when rodwell passes 2@H, east knows he has a weak hand with short clubs, so spade length|pg||
nt|athene: so there is less reason to bid 2@S even if you were ever going to do that, with those nice hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - not so bad with all honors working - but the layout is not friendly|pg||
nt|bigtrain: upgrades reflect a true value of the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  even 10 @h is |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: the 4321 structure doesn't count 10s, or combination of honors or location of honors|pg||
nt|runnerup:  important in good day when you are in 4 @h|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thus hands with the same point count can be worth different strengths|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=ax+atxx+ajtx+t9x|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|athene: disciplined from spector there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell: "who knows"|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that is the site for the KNR tool (Kaplan aNd Rebens Hand Evaluator)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|athene: this is one of those hands where, if you just count tricks for EW, you might not find five, but declarer will have a lot of trouble coming to nine|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: with the bad trump break|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i apologize for any misspellings that are the result of poor typing skills|pg||
nt|athene: basically if declarer tries to draw trumps the black suits are wide open and if he doesn't, east will get two diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm ok that might have cost a vital tempo for the defence though|pg||
nt|bigtrain: looks like 9 tricks from here by setting up the sidesuit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and partner is there also -so sometimes he bid 3 @c with shortness in @s |pg||
nt|bigtrain: as is frequently correct, set up the side suit asap|pg||
nt|athene: now meckstroth is pretty much certain that trumps are 4-1, after that @h9 appeared|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|h7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bigtrain: splitting the honors allows the defense to pull an extra round of trump...  has nothing to do with the number of trump winners|pg||
nt|athene: declarer in control now; doesn't mind losing @DK and two trumps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the defense will always have 2 trump winners|pg||
nt|athene: yes but splitting you might get *three* trump winners|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer wins the ace and then leaves trumps entirely and you get two ruffs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  it's more important to exchange 2 for 1|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so is this a competition @h 6 against @h 5 -to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cohler: "sorry" Meck: "I don't think it matters here" Cohler: "I don't either" Meck: "looks like 140 to me, but I'm not 100% sure"|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|mc|9|nt|athene: he really ducked that? no, surely not|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he didn't duck that|pg||
nt|athene: no|pg||
pg||
qx|c7|st||md|1SA8HAT63DAJT6CT93,S754H9DK852CKJ754,SKT2HJ874DQ9743C2,SQJ963HKQ52DCAQ86|sv|b|nt|algraves:  so a normal result |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|algraves:  4@H a good contract until you see EW cards|pg||
nt|algraves:  absolutely perfect fit for ns|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  so normal to play partscore|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: 2@S an option with the East cards, but goes quietly - not unreasonable, as North would be prepared for a 2@S response|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|algraves:  1NT = 14 to 16 but in the modern style that can be expanded to 13 -16 for either valuation or tactical purposes|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d2|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|algraves:  good defense to duck |pg||

pc|s3|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|algraves:  South had an easy NT upgrade with the ACE s and the Tens and notice how they both played a role in making this an easy contract in spite of the bad breaks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|algraves:  Aces are undervalued by point count and tens get no value at all. |pg||
nt|algraves:  but they have hidden value|pg||

nt|athene: sure, we meant, he didn't duck the @HK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck: "I thought hearts were going to be 4-1, but I thought Warren would have the 4"|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: i bet 1NT by south vs pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: No, when the heart K was played they all started discussing the number of tricks so he could claim|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south has solved this differently -other table passed in this situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: must say I prefer 1 NT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: 2@H possible from east in the passout seat i guess|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bigtrain: pass seems like a strange decision|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is it cuts out 2 of a minor from pd if he has rubbish with no fit in the majors|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|athene: but still, it's love all...|pg||

pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c4|nt|jbgood: you can make a few hearts, but also take 1 NT down. Not a big deal really|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: declarer only has four tricks at the moment but the defence will have to give him two more in the red suits|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: yes, it's more of an issue at mp, when +50 or even +100 is just not cutting it vs your heart partscore|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes looks like -50 and 1 imp earned|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|vugraphzfc: having problems wt computer|pg||
nt|algraves:  south judged there was not a lot of reward to bidding opposite a passed partner when their style is to open very light|pg||

nt|runnerup:  earlyer in defence|pg||
nt|athene: surprising how often it costs to signal with nines|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Didin't matter - if he'd still had 109 of clubs, Meck would play low diamond to endplay East (he had it out then decided "let's do it this way"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D!|an|2+|mb|d|mb|1H!|an|4+ !ss|nt|runnerup:  he didn't signal -he put it because table had 8|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - could never be right - and of course E might have exited with the di king|pg||
nt|athene: i was wondering if it was a signal or just splitting but i thought it was a signal|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: west will be thinking about slam now|pg||
nt|athene: just 4@D shows his hand i suppose|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H shows 4+@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @h /west is ok -by east -not so ok|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the 3rd hand psyche has jockeyed them into wrongsiding it|pg||
nt|jbgood: stand corrected: then W would be thrown in with a club to give away the diamond|pg||
mb|4D!|an|Splinter for !hs|nt|bigtrain: if opposite an unpassed hand South's pass would deny 3@S...  but having opened a tad light :) he chooses not to show the fit|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead gets the defence off to a good start|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes i think if south made a support double of 2@H that would show an actual opening bid :)|pg||
nt|athene: still declarer should prevail, even after spade, diamond back, and another spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cohler asks Rodwell if he could have 4 @hs and he says only with 5 @s and 4@hs (at least I think that was the question - I'm sure that was the answer)|pg||
nt|jbgood: but may go wrong...|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s lead and you are in trouble and it comes ?-perhaps 60 votes for that|pg||
nt|athene: let's say spade to Q or 10, north wins, diamond back to ace, another spade.  declarer rises ace, then plays three rounds of clubs|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: that looks a decent line to me; even if south could ruff the third club low, you would still have the chance of picking up the trumps|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: declarer's main decision, i think, is whether to cash the @HA before playing clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but i think that loses more than it gains|pg||
nt|jbgood: I wonder what a double of 1 @h would be? if natural - then W would be declarer...|pg||
nt|runnerup:  other table lead was singleton  @H -now needs to play well|pg||
nt|athene: east wondering if south has @SJ87 now i suppose|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cohler asks Rodwell about whether they play support DBL here and if so whether it promises a real opening bid. I'm not sure how it was phrased, but what Rodwell said was: "no they ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: don't show a minimum opening bid"|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: now if rodwell ruffs low you overruff and throw the @S10 on the @DK, so all is well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Don't put any faith in the spot cards I play for Meckstroth - he's very good about most things (for instance, he was the one who gave me the scores for the boards I had missed, ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: without my asking) but he tends to put his hand on top of the cards when he plays them, so I can't see them :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: dbl of 1 @h would be to of 1 @s - so ... still not sure he had to bid 2 @h just to show 5 - but app they think otherwise... (it would surely be good to make prd declarer though)|pg||
nt|athene: well, from east's point of view, it might be better for him to declar, to protect the @DK|pg||
nt|athene: *to declare|pg||
nt|athene: i think 2@H was aok|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||

pc|hK|pc|s9|pc|c8|pg||

nt|algraves:  yes one way or another he will make at least one more trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  so some cards were played and a claim was made. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: you might try 3@d in third seat if you were desperate |pg||
nt|algraves:  it is not always easy for the room observer to see everything that happens |pg||
nt|algraves:  but we always can get the gist|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@c natural, could be 3/3 minors|pg||
nt|algraves:  All expert pairs have methods to show west hand at this point|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 4@d|pg||
nt|algraves:  a strong hand in support with a singleton|pg||
nt|algraves:  there are various complicated little schemes|pg||
nt|algraves:  for the rank and file 4@D is just fine|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|algraves:  it is important to be able to pinpoint shortness adn support because it allows partner an easy evaluation of the fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@d should also be a splinter, as 2@D can be used as a natural reverse |pg||
nt|algraves:  West now thinking of possible hands Katz might have where 6 is a good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  well we do not know the ramifications of there methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  we can assume that 4@D showed that hand |pg||
nt|algraves:  some play 3@D as weaker|pg||
nt|algraves:  etc|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@d is possibly better, as you then have the 4-level to explore - here West has a very good hand, and may feel that he hasn't quite done enough|pg||
nt|algraves:  it is all just speculation|pg||
nt|algraves:  presumably Nickell showed his hand |pg||
nt|algraves:  and trusts his partner now |pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 3@d is a limited splinter you can go on over a 3@h sign-off - still, they have stopped ok |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfc: the only way to invite to game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: was the explanation|pg||

mb|3N|nt|bigtrain: don't need 1@S fo natural|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to play a spade through the ace before declarer can get pitches on diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but with @HAK to knock out as well as a diamond, they have loads of time to do that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: in the other room south led a spade conceding the contract immediately|pg||

nt|runnerup:  seemed to be @s lead |pg||
nt|athene: to be fair he did have a nasty lead problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Spector asks about leads and carding - leads are 4th and upside down carding including upside down Smith|pg||

nt|algraves:  Club gives 3 club tricks and a pitch of the spade|pg||
nt|algraves:  spade of course did not work|pg||
nt|algraves:  neither would a diamond|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the problem is, when you are on lead, you have to lead something|pg||
nt|algraves:  He had to pass the lead but the founders were smart enough to reject that rule|pg||
nt|algraves:  so he gets to practice his table patience with the notion of bad luck|pg||

mb|3H|an|forcing|mb|p|nt|athene: he might think his partner has to have @DAK or something, given the opponents' silence at favourable|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and like you see 7 @d is cheap -500|pg||
nt|jbgood: 7 @d a good save against 4@h:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: of course the more diamonds south has the better, from north's point of view|pg||
nt|athene: because then there is no spade loser|pg||
nt|athene: playing in either hearts or clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: time for Mr Exclusion maybe|pg||
nt|athene: if they play that|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but 7 @d can come from heaven  |pg||
nt|bigtrain: south is sub minimum|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thus the 4@H raise vs a cuebid|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S would be keycard here, right? does that mean 4NT is exclusion for spades, and 5minor is natural exclusion|pg||
nt|athene: or do they use steps?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: techinaically speaking S has denied a @S control and 2/3+@C and the worse hand posssible|pg||
nt|bigtrain: promises 6+@C in meckwell|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: only STANDARD precision says 5C 4M|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Is the good news that in 6 the play will be quick?|pg||

nt|andyv:  a bit more than that|pg||
nt|andyv:  300 in other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  Ah, they went 3 down|pg||
nt|algraves:  aha |pg||
nt|algraves:  didnt see those|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although with the drop of the 10 he has a ruffing finesse - missed that |pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  final board of this set and Milner team will advance|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  What happened to 119?|pg||
nt|andyv:  rained out|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes sometimes it is bette to only see some of the cards rather than all of the cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks to our operator   |pg||
mb|4D|mb|5D|nt|mdgraham: decent 7@H NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@c too - difficult from here though!|pg||
nt|algraves:  7@C not 7@H|pg||
mb|5H|nt|andyv:  Thank you Henri and Debbie as well as all the specs|pg||
nt|algraves:  but that wont happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: congrats says compton you guys and bramley agrees|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Wait a mo - no, 7@h only 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  these hands are very difficult to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Debbie, you did a wonderful job, including giving us the byplay at the table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks for having me and I enjoyed working with all of you see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|algraves:  it is job one to go plus and get your game bonus|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  yes, almost felt like we were there|pg||
mc|12|nt|algraves:  neither Cheek nor Grue had a 6 bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@d by East could force S to bid a slam - like 5@d|pg||
nt|algraves:  and the basic principle is always to avoid getting stampeded into a losing slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all - everybody now off to the other table to see MR at work :)|pg||
nt|algraves:  This is good bridge by NS even though they missed laydown slam|pg||
nt|algraves:  and notice the Katz let sleeping dogs lie, He would have had to take a 7 @D save over 6 @H if he kept pushing|pg||
