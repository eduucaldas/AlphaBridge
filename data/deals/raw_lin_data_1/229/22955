nt|fabsayc: the operator tells me the computer is broken, will be no more transmission|pg||
nt|ady: easy 4 spades e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: Damas total: 182-118|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 30 points between them - cud be probing slam...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10-13, 5+@d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|athene: same sort of bidding problem for south here as faced north a moment ago over the 2@C opener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sort of like a strong weak two|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni-nunes 2-level bids do give their opponents some hard decisions|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzdu: holaa|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: common expert treatment is 1NT on N hand |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a string weak two is presumably a bit weaker than a weak strong two|pg||
nt|athene: or a bit weaker than a rope weak two i suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: declarer should make 10 tricks sometime today|pg||
nt|sharkey: All artificial bids sofar - assume 2@C relay|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: lanzarotti obviously takes 2@S as showing a very weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: the immediate bid after the redouble|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess N could double 3@d with a good(ish) hand |pg||
nt|athene: you might say "well, obviously north must be broke, after the opponents have both shown decent hands"|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will be a bit worried here; only 8 obvious tricks even with the club finesse working|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: not sure about this - 2@c may be Gazzilli |pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobholl: @c queen is a nice card but not shown|pg||
nt|athene: well, no 4@C, so madala knows they are off the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: they'll play six, though, i would think|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: oh well :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@h not very good needs @C 32 and king rigth most times|pg||
nt|athene: but the point is, if you work out what partner has by trusting your opponents, then you get talked out of games when west has psyched the redouble|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but the spades are blocked so he can play on diamonds successfully|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: need to be cautious    even 5 level could be too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nobody ever won at bridge by trusting the opponents|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: so having agreements with partner is a better way to go, what with him being on your side|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most of the time.....|pg||
nt|athene: south can see declarer is all set to throw hearts on spades, so might as well attack hearts now?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C obviously something showing a good hand, maybe showing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on;y blocked if he wins this :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing king looks the odds play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
nt|athene: lead was @S9 showing bad suit|pg||
nt|athene: and if it was lauria who had the spades, he would have let versace win the first diamond to clear the suit surely|pg||
nt|athene: hello good morning|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hi Martin|pg||
nt|athene: oh well|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: with the idea that you will get your club tricks anyway?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: most irritating is to go down at the 5 level having mad a slam try   but will be ok here|pg||
nt|sharkey: still has to make it - like you stated David|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: of course it is always easier to work out how the cards lie when you can see how they lie :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is no joy  in Mudville....|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: in fact will have to play carefully       may go down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wonder if the @S4 had any significance|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he decided the only way to beat was partner having the @CA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for non baseball fans, that refers to a famous poem|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|athene: if trumps are clubs are 3-2, you don't need the @CK right, do you? just lose club, ruff clubs good|pg||
nt|athene: *if trumps AND clubs are 3-2|pg||
nt|athene: because you can cash clubs and get the heart through as well|pg||
nt|athene: partner having the @HK is not in itself enough; even if you cash some hearts, declarer can throw enough clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H would be interesting|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|ady: has to look after 4th diamond|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's true but still not much better than 50%|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but there are other chances too|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: @C10 doesnt tell too much|pg||
nt|ady: if 3 rounds of trumps are drawn   no where for the 4th diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.federbridge.it/main.html|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: if 2 rounds only drawn   and a diamond finesse   then north can play a heart to south for a club ruff|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h2|pc|d5|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: could have made in various ways|pg||
nt|athene: for example just bash out @DAK and another without drawing trumps|pg||
nt|ady: was hoping for better fortune with clubs to get a loser away|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry there is a club ruff yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure this can be made with a @C lead|pg||
nt|athene: ok let's look more closely|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS still retains @H communication - declarer cant draw trumps|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to draw the trumps, and then he can endplay north in diamonds if he reads the cards|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby commented afterwards that he should've flashed Andy his @HQ, perhaps he would've passed 4@H.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a little gamesmanship|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: But he didn't know that he should flash it to Andy instead of Franco.  Franco then launched into an explanation of the "fishhead coup," which it seems we can expect to see on ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Bridgewinners soon...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: interesting decision to pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie: "Good thing it's only a 15-board segment."|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: two rounds of hearts and three of spades for down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby confirms that they play upside-down count and attitude at trick 1|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfj: Andy pauses, Bobby apologizes for playing too fast.|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Apologies for the interruption, looks like there are too many interested viewers for our poor servers.  Luckily, not much missed: Franco has been thinking about this trick for ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: about five minutes.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i see we have not missed much|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the key here is to play spades so north does not imply a heart doubleton|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart queen an automatic false card from Qxx|pg||

nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to ruff a club and pick up trumps, losing just one spade, two diamonds and the @CA|pg||
mb|2D!|an|multi|mb|2N!|nt|ady: 4@S  making n/s   but an excellent save for e/w in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know the intricacies of the NS methods but i suspect 2nt showed extras|pg||
nt|athene: but if west led a spade, east could win the @CA and return a diamond and then throw two clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer could never get to dummy as east could overruff with the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, all irrelevant anyway|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: think 3@S max|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not sure e/w will be able to enter the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if north bid only 2@S and east doubled, that would find the club fit, but that is surely the only way|pg||
nt|athene: and i think north will bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  4 losers in spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: But NS likely will end up in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: the only way 4@S makes is if the defence don't attack diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to bid it - S will decline any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: but that's not happening|pg||
nt|athene: i think north just bids 3@S here and they play there|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree William|pg||
nt|ady: will east enter if north raises to 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@C also possibility - Splinter|pg||
nt|athene: i would probably double 2@S with the east cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: now a support double for spades i guess, so they find their 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: south will have trouble showing hand now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: N has a shortage of points but great playing strength when pd bid @S|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt was a spade raise you would think south would bid a discouraging 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will pay to stop low here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like a direct 3@D invite, although the bid has several flaws|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: i think support doubles are not as popular in italy as in america, but still if you double 1@H with 4+ spades here you surely need them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could have responded 2@d, perhaps, but that may be FG, and S isn't quite strong enough for that (non strong-club opener)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry but don't have a CC for NS|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: still will easy enough for defence to collect their 4 winners  |pg||
nt|athene: ok, the fifth spade is nice, and QJ doubleton is much better when partner opens the suit, but even so...|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i'm told 2NT is 6-4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@H was just attempting to sign off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT is FG|pg||
nt|athene: even if 2@D response were not GF you might bid a spade anyway so as not to lose the suit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: very complicated hand, but at least the lead reveals south has no natural lead|pg||
nt|athene: you feel silly here if you try the jack and then south has a singleton queen|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|bobholl: made now no problem|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless your playing flattery|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: It is noted for the record that Stevie did not screw up.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: meaning he tabled the dummy correctly :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|r!|nt|fabsayc: with system on redouble forces 3@C to get out in either minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: To clarify, the defense did not play three rounds of spades.  After the first spade, Franco shifted to a club.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzfj: Providing the otherwise unattainable second hook.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: But Bobby did not read the position.  Still shaking his head.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: sheesh|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very undiscplined auction|pg||

pc|h7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: In other words, playing behind screens, you cannot call the director over a hesitation that occurred on YOUR side, because presumably the other side is in the dark about who took ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: the time.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby: "Sounds like you're not supposed to call until the hand is over."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Some discussion about what the contours of the rule are.  Stevie concludes: "Weird rule.  You lose all your rights if you call the director..."  Franco: "Sounds like Solly was ...|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2NT=20-21|pg||
mb|2D!|an|multi|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: south had made a great lead, and should have known every card at the end|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S-1 on hand 4 cost 12 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|athene: perfect mesh here - singleton facing four small - let's see if they can identify it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to locate @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows some sort of good raise and *south* shows extras and a heart singleton, that will certainly do it|pg||
nt|athene: well, with a ten-card fit you don't usually count the queen of trumps as a problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT 12-14; not 5/4 majors or 4441|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D looking for a 5-3 spade fit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, CC not clear about 3@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3M would be a singleton or void|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead runs to the jack, and declarer will duck a club to north to protect the @SKx i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: if east is thinking this long he must have forgotten the system :)|pg||
nt|athene: wake up, fantoni!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, misread the CC. 1NT can include a 4441 shape.|pg||
nt|athene: EW's 1nt has to cover a lot of hands unsuitable for other bids, sort of like a precision 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: their 1-bids are 14+ points and their 2-bids are unbalanced so the weak notrump has to work hard for its living|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, lots of people; no idea about 3@d|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|bobholl: always difficult to rerach a normal 4@S after weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: only problem 6@S n/s  is the 3-0 trump split    needs to guess which way to play trumps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Any bidding by EW cud assist declarer in locating the Q|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S=at least 5/4 both minors |pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: 3@D some kind of @S raise - and W didnt x - he'll be on lead anyway|pg||
nt|sharkey: x 3@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: they seem to have no problem|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: this is where west showing a 2 suiter might give the distribution away     vulnerability was against west entering|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: maybe just natural and strong, and then everything natural-ish, with 3@S showing stopper and concern about hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny, on the copy of the EW CC I have 1NT-3minor is not described at all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so presumably they are natural bids|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: even when the opponents are silent you can sometimes use that to help find the Qxx|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: by asking "which defender would be more likely to bid if he DID have a spade void?"|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: i wonder if east had super-accepted, whether south would have bid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: he might well have done, as the super-accept would mark his partner with a singleton heart, so that is pretty good news |pg||
nt|mdgraham: expensive @sk|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: but at this vulnerability, that line of thought does not really help so much, because even with a lot of shape, the opponents are not going to be bidding|pg||
nt|ady: in my opinion that would not be a reasonable question to ask |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am very surprised east did not take another bid|pg||
nt|athene: it does look as though doubling 3@H helped NS though|pg||
nt|athene: gave madala more room to make a try|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult decision for madala|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would play on @D 33|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in positions similar to this, you might want to make the exotic play of ducking the first trick|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is you can draw trumps and keep control of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think that applied here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: he has virtually no defense to 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although looking at 3@d and 3@S you would guess puppet stayman |pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 3@c asks for 5M or 5422 shape|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart return he will test clubs and then maybe run the @DJ into north for a second avoidance play|pg||
nt|athene: still guarding those spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 3@d denies 5m4M|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they should put that on their CC for us poor old commentators :) |pg||
nt|athene: if the defence now play ace and a spade, of course declarer can afford to run the @DJ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|sharkey: A @C lead will leave the lead in dummy  and -1; otherwise lead will go to hand and make - I predict|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: probably expected QJ10 in S, with the 9 in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i'm a bit surprised at versace showing the minors actually|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a 3nt raise to me|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: you mean declarer's natural play is to lead a small trump from whichever hand he finds himself in at trick 2?|pg||
nt|ady: swing could go either way|pg||
nt|athene: i think it is just about 50-50 to be honest|pg||
nt|athene: of course madala is not expecting the @CK to be onside|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's surely below 50%|pg||
nt|athene: he's wondering whether to overtake this, ruff the last heart, then play a small club |pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: oh well, at least he will be happy when he finds the bad break now - it means there is a chance 5@S can gain imps|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: the defence would then have time to set up a diamond trick but that might be ok|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|d5|mc|9|nt|sharkey: So much for preditions...|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|athene: it might look as though declarer only has five losers but if he draws trumps he can't ruff a diamond so he should go one down|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: 4@c cue, 5@C Turbo |pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|athene: i would have thought 1nt was the obvious rebid there|pg||
nt|athene: getting your overall hand across|pg||

nt|athene: i guess 2@C is ok, as long as partner doesn't think you have to have diamonds for it|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@H     but n/s may play 4@S   for -500|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: EW might have 4@D, at this rate|pg||
nt|athene: obviously east thinks 4@D is forcing, though, which suggests he thinks it is a "new suit" i.e. 2@C does not guarantee any diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: but how to show it now (gazilli ?)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i assume the pause there was west thinking, not south|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C natural or various strong hands; 2@S less than 8 points|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: the EW misunderstanding here is a variation on a common theme:- when do you count a short minor opening as a "bid suit" and when not?|pg||
nt|sharkey: In the other room W opened a weak NT and East bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: if diamonds have been bid already, then 4@D is not forcing|pg||
nt|ady: good swing for Zaleski here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone for 3@D with four-card trump support?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: I wonder what type hand West would bid 1 NT second time - may be conventional?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 4@Sx by north in open room|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|athene: if you draw trumps you don't have a dummy entry, but when you lead the @H10, east has a tricky decision |pg||

nt|athene: if you play low here and then another heart, east has to win and play a small diamond to give you a problem|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: you can put in the 8, capture the jack or 10, and play a diamond back|pg||

nt|ady: e/w should make 3NT|pg||

mb|d|nt|bobholl: but vulnarable it is understandable the other one was nV|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|athene: only @DA as an obvious loser, as you can throw a diamond on the @SK|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but if you draw trumps you only have 11 tricks with crossruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, opposite vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt scramble now, perhaps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|ady: maybe a diamond lead would give problems|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead would certainly cause problems, but the club looks normal to me|pg||
nt|athene: even after a club lead, the defence might have a chance - suppose declarer wins the jack and returns a club; north can win and shift to a diamond now|pg||
nt|ady: even a club lead  may nopt make    diamond switch later may be ok for defence|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NS play a strong club system, i am guessing over 1@S a bid of 2@C is their only game force|pg||
nt|athene: after a club lead declarer can go for hearts immediately of course, but that looks risky with just a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: well when you only go for 500 with that dummy, i don't think you can be accused of rash bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: but it still costs an imp |pg||
nt|athene: maybe west comes under pressure, having to guard both majors, and you can ruff the @HK or @S10 good|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: this lead stops 6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: if declarer plays hearts early   should make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know if NS's agreement is that 2nt here is lebensohl or a scramble|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that north does not unblock - you would think he would, as then either defender can win the third heart if need be|pg||
nt|athene: but even if you play it as scramble you can use it, like this, to show a weak 3@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: (direct 3@H bid is stronger)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|athene: one possibility is to run the spades first - that often makes life hard for the defenders|pg||
nt|sharkey: He has to play on @H I think|pg||
nt|athene: i think versace might get trump squeezed|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: the trouble is, it might make things hard for you too - you have to find a couple of discards, and you also lose your dummy entries|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: if this holds the trick, what does declarer do next?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume play @C to the A and @C up.  @D A has to be in front|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is fairly sure now that north has the @HA, which makes it safer to play another heart, as north is probably not going to be the one with long hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no way the defence can set themselves up some long hearts|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: @HJ suit-preference for diamonds over clubs of course|pg||

nt|ady: North seems to have trapped himself not entering the bidding first round|pg||

mb|d|nt|athene: if the double shows 4+ spades, then north might want to raise just because of the big fit, but he doesn't want to suggest he has anything|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: aggressive from north; if partner has only 3 spades, game will never be there, and even when he has 4, it needs a lot|pg||

nt|athene: was it possible south could have three diamonds though?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this hand looks very interesting, two slams beaten by bad breaks|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: 2@s would be a weak two in spades |pg||

nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/6.jpg rieccoli|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|athene: maybe a better plan was to cash the @DA at trick 2, then return the heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice to see that even Fantunes can err occasionally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner started with @DKx he can cash the @DK before giving you the heart ruff, and you can give him a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no need to underlead your @DA trying to pick up @DQxx with declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West might have passed - six spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might deem it unsuitable for a weak two |pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|athene: i am told, on the NS methods, if south WAS 4333, he would be 18-20, so that was out|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|kareno: 6 either major makes with spades friendly.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bobholl: very good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: kickard, love it|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose 6@H is a bit better than 6@S because you might make it even with a bad spade break, but it's hard to get out of a 4-4 fit once you lock into it|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kareno: Yes, diamonds might produce an extra trick.|pg||
nt|athene: so the underlead looks like a definite slip|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|bobholl: no @S Q so 6 only|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|kareno: 5@h may show two without trump queen.|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should have taken control with blackwood over 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: normally you don't want the limited hand as captain|pg||
nt|athene: east just wants to know if her partner has @SAQ, @HA, @DA - then 7 is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: There's no safety play in the spade suit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@c - so old hat these days|pg||
