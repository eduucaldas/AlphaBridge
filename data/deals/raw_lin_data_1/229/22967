pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|winkle:  here east/west have missed their major suit fits, but they'll surivive.|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 3NT is a standout with 4333 and total @D control|pg||
nt|winkle:  declarer can take the spade finesse savely and north has no more diamonds to lead.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: the trouble with a splinter is you are not likely to get cooperation (ie. too strong)|pg||

nt|bobh1: N might have opened|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: i suppose he could bid 5@H now, saying lots of controls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S effectively the same, except should usually be spade void|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: which might have saved a partscore swing|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: the other table you can see Stevie Weinstein playing for Fleisher.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i wonder if 4m is a splinter or fit-showing?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobh1: so he chooses to show a limit raise, usualy 4 trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2NT is explained as invitational with hearts.  In response to Chip's questions, David writes, "usually four."|pg||
nt|bobh1: he probably intends to bid 4@C even if jonathan declines, which i dont think he will|pg||

nt|fabsayc: a little gamesmanship|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: But he didn't know that he should flash it to Andy instead of Franco.  Franco then launched into an explanation of the "fishhead coup," which it seems we can expect to see on ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Chip had pulled 2@H out of the box, then changed his mind and tried 2@D.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfj: Shi wrote something about 3@C, but sadly my eyesight does not extend so far.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: ... and we're caught up again, minus some of the pesky details.  Last board this set, hopefully the next will bring us better luck.|pg||
