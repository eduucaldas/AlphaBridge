mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kareno: North adhering to my policy of underbidding 4-4-4-1 distributions.|pg||

mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|mildredb: but right in this case|pg||
nt|kareno: We're on opposite sides here, Mildred :)  I like the bid which also could block competition by the opponents.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  making n/s   but an excellent save for e/w in clubs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: think 3@S max|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not sure e/w will be able to enter the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if north bid only 2@S and east doubled, that would find the club fit, but that is surely the only way|pg||
nt|athene: and i think north will bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  4 losers in spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: But NS likely will end up in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: the only way 4@S makes is if the defence don't attack diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to bid it - S will decline any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: but that's not happening|pg||
nt|athene: i think north just bids 3@S here and they play there|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree William|pg||
nt|ady: will east enter if north raises to 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@C also possibility - Splinter|pg||
nt|athene: i would probably double 2@S with the east cards|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sharkey: N has a shortage of points but great playing strength when pd bid @S|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt was a spade raise you would think south would bid a discouraging 3@S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: still will easy enough for defence to collect their 4 winners  |pg||
nt|athene: ok, the fifth spade is nice, and QJ doubleton is much better when partner opens the suit, but even so...|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i'm told 2NT is 6-4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|athene: so 3@H was just attempting to sign off|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|athene: but then north feels that facing any sort of heart fit it is worth a shot at game|pg||

pc|d4|pc|h2|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|sharkey: Zaleski picked up 12 UMPs on bd 4|pg||

nt|sharkey: *it|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west might go very quietly here, given the vulnerability here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: south had made a great lead, and should have known every card at the end|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S-1 on hand 4 cost 12 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|athene: perfect mesh here - singleton facing four small - let's see if they can identify it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to locate @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows some sort of good raise and *south* shows extras and a heart singleton, that will certainly do it|pg||
nt|athene: well, with a ten-card fit you don't usually count the queen of trumps as a problem|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ady: only problem 6@S n/s  is the 3-0 trump split    needs to guess which way to play trumps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Any bidding by EW cud assist declarer in locating the Q|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3@D some kind of @S raise - and W didnt x - he'll be on lead anyway|pg||
nt|sharkey: x 3@H|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: this is where west showing a 2 suiter might give the distribution away     vulnerability was against west entering|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: even when the opponents are silent you can sometimes use that to help find the Qxx|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: by asking "which defender would be more likely to bid if he DID have a spade void?"|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: but at this vulnerability, that line of thought does not really help so much, because even with a lot of shape, the opponents are not going to be bidding|pg||
nt|ady: in my opinion that would not be a reasonable question to ask |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i am very surprised east did not take another bid|pg||
mb|5C|nt|fabsayc: he has virtually no defense to 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|sharkey: A @C lead will leave the lead in dummy  and -1; otherwise lead will go to hand and make - I predict|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: you mean declarer's natural play is to lead a small trump from whichever hand he finds himself in at trick 2?|pg||
nt|ady: swing could go either way|pg||
nt|athene: i think it is just about 50-50 to be honest|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: oh well, at least he will be happy when he finds the bad break now - it means there is a chance 5@S can gain imps|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||

mb|4D|nt|athene: EW might have 4@D, at this rate|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i assume the pause there was west thinking, not south|pg||

nt|athene: diamond lead would certainly cause problems, but the club looks normal to me|pg||
nt|athene: even after a club lead, the defence might have a chance - suppose declarer wins the jack and returns a club; north can win and shift to a diamond now|pg||
nt|ady: even a club lead  may nopt make    diamond switch later may be ok for defence|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: NS play a strong club system, i am guessing over 1@S a bid of 2@C is their only game force|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|athene: the trouble is, it might make things hard for you too - you have to find a couple of discards, and you also lose your dummy entries|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: if this holds the trick, what does declarer do next?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume play @C to the A and @C up.  @D A has to be in front|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is fairly sure now that north has the @HA, which makes it safer to play another heart, as north is probably not going to be the one with long hearts|pg||
