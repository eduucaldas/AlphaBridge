nt|andyv:  we will appoint you head of that committee, Martin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 44 is being played now under the original auction, but it's really 43|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: so this is going to be complicated|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no no no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I am not going to play the cards, will just do auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ie in Vugraph it's 43's cards, but it's now board 44|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: S opened 2@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i was refering to clubs and hearts, if either length switched slam was on|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chorush: I hate to admit it but I would be liely to have bid 2D N GOTEN IN TROUBLE|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzfd: I don't know the answer, actually :)  In a normal match there would probably be no immediate penalty for being <1 board behind|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: but I don't know for these types of matches|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Let me take this oppotunity to thank Joe Matise for an excellent job keeping us informed on all the table action and mixed up boards|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfd: actually|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfd: possible imp penalties for one side I guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  best here for N to tap dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to Andy Vinock for co=commentary, spectators and USBF for making this possible and so much fun|pg||
nt|andyv:  but with stiff K@d in S  hand, declarer can take two taps in dummy |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Martin, Joe and all the specs who have joined us.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: This was a super result for Milner in the other room. Based on the auction they had, Justin literaly stole 4 hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: interesting race coming up for the game fulfilling trick vs game defeating trick|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|bigtrain: how did he make it?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  tricky hand for declarer...starts with 5@c and 2@h...playing J@s will give him 8th trick|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chorush: won diamond lead, play to heart in dummy, led small club. North went up K and returned club. bingo|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: win spade, diamond and more spades, but heart hook right so should make|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|chorush: EW missed a great save in 5 clubs|pg||

nt|fabsayc: the 4@H we thought would make was doubled and down 1, 9 more to Milner "Young Guns"|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|bigtrain: pretty unusual decision...  partners can usually be depended on to lead singletons against suit contracts|pg||
