nt|sharkey: Some may not bid 3@S with only 3 trumps so this could be IMPs to the Patane team|pg||

nt|sharkey: we shall never know....|pg||
nt|athene: i think he can be sure that east has short clubs, but even so, bidding 6 is not so easy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that wouild probably be a rotten pairs score |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: probably EW will get a free run in the other room, so then it is a matter of east's rebid after 1@D 1@H|pg||

mb|4S|nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no chance here of course|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you just play spades and accept two down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double is more flexible, as they say|pg||
nt|queequeg: players in both the rooms:|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - but neither N nor S can x|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: with the @H lead surely|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/1.jpg|pg||
nt|queequeg: Open room, waiting to start|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: a double for takeout by north if available would have worked well|pg||
nt|queequeg: welcome Bob :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/2.jpg|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: the 4@S bid at the other table was perhaps unwise, left east guessing whose hand it was|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|queequeg: Closed room|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|athene: even with this nice start, and trumps 3-3, declarer should be one down|pg||
nt|athene: east just holds up in spades and there is nowhere to put the @D109|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure east did not especially like leading that unsupported ace, but it's just that nothing else appealed at all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: ended quietly for 130|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about this kind of canape approach - if it is systematic|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: S might have tried 3@S, but 3@h feels like a definite statement |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: is declarer going to cash the @CAK then try a spade to hand, hoping if that holds, to play a club throwing the @HA?|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's not a bad plan :)|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes that sort of thing is useful but here even if it worked, it would not help especially|pg||
nt|athene: even if clubs break you get 2 hearts, 4 clubs, spade...that's not 3NT by a fair way|pg||
nt|athene: in the play here the defence would have time to attack diamonds anyway|pg||

nt|queequeg: @H CAITI Stefano       @H PATTACINI Maurizio    @H ZAFFINO Maurizio|pg||
nt|athene: in the bidding, a hidden issue is whether north's "double-then-3@H" route showed just any hand too strong for 2@H first time, or whether it does promise a flexible hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: over a normal weak-two opener by opponents, a jump overcall is strong e.g. (2@D) 3@H|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/6.jpg Open Room|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: so you could argue that double then bidding a suit doesn't show a hand that definitely wants to commit to that suit|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/5.jpg   Closed Room|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|athene: and on that basis i suppose south might consider 3@S|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||

nt|mdgraham: two off with the spade misguess - but it was never making|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we all know the feeling - we are quite happy, until the result of the first board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then it all goes downhill |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@D=majors|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  should make on the lay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d probably 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: maybe can block the diamonds and survive|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: i prefer 2@C for that purpose, as partner can bid 2@D with no preference|pg||
nt|athene: interesting, he doesn't go 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with opening 4@H is that if opps bid 4@S or 5@C over it, as they very likely will, you are left not knowing what to do|pg||
nt|athene: you would probably be tempted to bid 5@D as partner will never imagine what you have|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Assume 2@S constructive - surprised S didnt make an advance towards game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s requests 2NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: there's a saying : 65 come alive how about 75 ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@d transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a lot of 11's are opened these days|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: however, the way it has gone, he has hardly shown his hand either|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: this auction would show extras for me, and for sure that double was penalty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: twice armed is he, etc|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is hearts and 3@S is a super-accept, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D retransfer|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|athene: on a club attack declarer might have to overtake in spades to get a fast pitch from dummy|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: maybe if the auction had tempoed out differently he would have bid - for example if west made some raise and then east bid 4@S and that was passed round to him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although if the @s10 forces the king the defence would need an immediate diamond switch|pg||
nt|athene: so losing one heart, one diamond, and one club|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharkey: perhaps being NV was a factor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: let's hope we are guessing well|pg||
nt|athene: on any other lead he can happily unblock the @SK as he has time to build an entry to his @SAQ, so plus one|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: ace and club shift looks best here|pg||
nt|athene: i mean even without peeking :)|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: another problem on defense for west, succeeds if he clears the spades, but also must unguard the diamonds later|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: common expert treatment is 1NT on N hand |pg||

nt|bobholl: 6@h not very good needs @C 32 and king rigth most times|pg||
nt|athene: but the point is, if you work out what partner has by trusting your opponents, then you get talked out of games when west has psyched the redouble|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: but the spades are blocked so he can play on diamonds successfully|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: need to be cautious    even 5 level could be too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nobody ever won at bridge by trusting the opponents|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: so having agreements with partner is a better way to go, what with him being on your side|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most of the time.....|pg||
nt|athene: south can see declarer is all set to throw hearts on spades, so might as well attack hearts now?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C obviously something showing a good hand, maybe showing a strong notrump|pg||

nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to ruff a club and pick up trumps, losing just one spade, two diamonds and the @CA|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  making n/s   but an excellent save for e/w in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know the intricacies of the NS methods but i suspect 2nt showed extras|pg||
nt|athene: but if west led a spade, east could win the @CA and return a diamond and then throw two clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer could never get to dummy as east could overruff with the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, all irrelevant anyway|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: think 3@S max|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not sure e/w will be able to enter the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if north bid only 2@S and east doubled, that would find the club fit, but that is surely the only way|pg||
nt|athene: and i think north will bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  4 losers in spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: But NS likely will end up in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: the only way 4@S makes is if the defence don't attack diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to bid it - S will decline any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: but that's not happening|pg||
nt|athene: i think north just bids 3@S here and they play there|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree William|pg||
nt|ady: will east enter if north raises to 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@C also possibility - Splinter|pg||
nt|athene: i would probably double 2@S with the east cards|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: now a support double for spades i guess, so they find their 5-3 fit|pg||

mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: south will have trouble showing hand now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: N has a shortage of points but great playing strength when pd bid @S|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt was a spade raise you would think south would bid a discouraging 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will pay to stop low here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like a direct 3@D invite, although the bid has several flaws|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|athene: i think support doubles are not as popular in italy as in america, but still if you double 1@H with 4+ spades here you surely need them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could have responded 2@d, perhaps, but that may be FG, and S isn't quite strong enough for that (non strong-club opener)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry but don't have a CC for NS|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: still will easy enough for defence to collect their 4 winners  |pg||
nt|athene: ok, the fifth spade is nice, and QJ doubleton is much better when partner opens the suit, but even so...|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i'm told 2NT is 6-4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@H was just attempting to sign off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT is FG|pg||
nt|athene: even if 2@D response were not GF you might bid a spade anyway so as not to lose the suit|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: very complicated hand, but at least the lead reveals south has no natural lead|pg||

nt|athene: perfect mesh here - singleton facing four small - let's see if they can identify it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to locate @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows some sort of good raise and *south* shows extras and a heart singleton, that will certainly do it|pg||
nt|athene: well, with a ten-card fit you don't usually count the queen of trumps as a problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT 12-14; not 5/4 majors or 4441|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D looking for a 5-3 spade fit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, CC not clear about 3@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3M would be a singleton or void|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead runs to the jack, and declarer will duck a club to north to protect the @SKx i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: if east is thinking this long he must have forgotten the system :)|pg||
nt|athene: wake up, fantoni!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, misread the CC. 1NT can include a 4441 shape.|pg||
nt|athene: EW's 1nt has to cover a lot of hands unsuitable for other bids, sort of like a precision 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: their 1-bids are 14+ points and their 2-bids are unbalanced so the weak notrump has to work hard for its living|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: always difficult to rerach a normal 4@S after weak NT|pg||

nt|sharkey: x 3@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: they seem to have no problem|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: this is where west showing a 2 suiter might give the distribution away     vulnerability was against west entering|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: maybe just natural and strong, and then everything natural-ish, with 3@S showing stopper and concern about hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny, on the copy of the EW CC I have 1NT-3minor is not described at all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so presumably they are natural bids|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: even when the opponents are silent you can sometimes use that to help find the Qxx|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|athene: by asking "which defender would be more likely to bid if he DID have a spade void?"|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if east had super-accepted, whether south would have bid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: he might well have done, as the super-accept would mark his partner with a singleton heart, so that is pretty good news |pg||
nt|mdgraham: expensive @sk|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: but at this vulnerability, that line of thought does not really help so much, because even with a lot of shape, the opponents are not going to be bidding|pg||
nt|ady: in my opinion that would not be a reasonable question to ask |pg||
pc|h6|pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: i am very surprised east did not take another bid|pg||
nt|athene: it does look as though doubling 3@H helped NS though|pg||
nt|athene: gave madala more room to make a try|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult decision for madala|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would play on @D 33|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in positions similar to this, you might want to make the exotic play of ducking the first trick|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is you can draw trumps and keep control of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think that applied here|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has virtually no defense to 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although looking at 3@d and 3@S you would guess puppet stayman |pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 3@c asks for 5M or 5422 shape|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart return he will test clubs and then maybe run the @DJ into north for a second avoidance play|pg||
nt|athene: still guarding those spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 3@d denies 5m4M|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they should put that on their CC for us poor old commentators :) |pg||
nt|athene: if the defence now play ace and a spade, of course declarer can afford to run the @DJ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s5|nt|sharkey: A @C lead will leave the lead in dummy  and -1; otherwise lead will go to hand and make - I predict|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably expected QJ10 in S, with the 9 in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i'm a bit surprised at versace showing the minors actually|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a 3nt raise to me|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: you mean declarer's natural play is to lead a small trump from whichever hand he finds himself in at trick 2?|pg||
nt|ady: swing could go either way|pg||
nt|athene: i think it is just about 50-50 to be honest|pg||
nt|athene: of course madala is not expecting the @CK to be onside|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's surely below 50%|pg||
nt|athene: he's wondering whether to overtake this, ruff the last heart, then play a small club |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: oh well, at least he will be happy when he finds the bad break now - it means there is a chance 5@S can gain imps|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: the defence would then have time to set up a diamond trick but that might be ok|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h9|pc|c9|nt|sharkey: So much for preditions...|pg||

pc|dT|nt|athene: interesting sort of squeeze here|pg||
nt|athene: if north throws a diamond declarer can't go wrong really|pg||
nt|athene: but if he throws a heart, south has to throw a spade, and then it becomes safe to take the diamond finesse anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm sorry that is not quite correct, as east will presumably throw a heart anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so then south can throw a heart and it is not quite safe to finesse diamonds through north|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that's what my copy of the CC says. Might be out-of-date of course|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: hard for east to know it was diamonds, not clubs, he should have been attacking|pg||

mb|2C|nt|bobholl: nice N hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: i would have thought 1nt was the obvious rebid there|pg||
nt|athene: getting your overall hand across|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 4@D will only encourage camberos|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@C is ok, as long as partner doesn't think you have to have diamonds for it|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@H     but n/s may play 4@S   for -500|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: EW might have 4@D, at this rate|pg||
nt|athene: obviously east thinks 4@D is forcing, though, which suggests he thinks it is a "new suit" i.e. 2@C does not guarantee any diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: but how to show it now (gazilli ?)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: i assume the pause there was west thinking, not south|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C natural or various strong hands; 2@S less than 8 points|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW misunderstanding here is a variation on a common theme:- when do you count a short minor opening as a "bid suit" and when not?|pg||
nt|sharkey: In the other room W opened a weak NT and East bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: if diamonds have been bid already, then 4@D is not forcing|pg||
nt|ady: good swing for Zaleski here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone for 3@D with four-card trump support?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: I wonder what type hand West would bid 1 NT second time - may be conventional?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@h=maximum without majors or 4@h|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: in this auction where a suit agreed and we are past 4nt, i play 5NT is key card (probably i am alone :()|pg||

nt|athene: you don't need to guess the hearts or anything|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: 4@Sx by north in open room|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|athene: if you draw trumps you don't have a dummy entry, but when you lead the @H10, east has a tricky decision |pg||

pc|d2|nt|athene: wondering whether to overtake and lead a club up|pg||
nt|athene: if you play low here and then another heart, east has to win and play a small diamond to give you a problem|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: you can put in the 8, capture the jack or 10, and play a diamond back|pg||

nt|ady: e/w should make 3NT|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: but vulnarable it is understandable the other one was nV|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|athene: only @DA as an obvious loser, as you can throw a diamond on the @SK|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: but if you draw trumps you only have 11 tricks with crossruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, opposite vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt scramble now, perhaps|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: maybe a diamond lead would give problems|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead would certainly cause problems, but the club looks normal to me|pg||
nt|athene: even after a club lead, the defence might have a chance - suppose declarer wins the jack and returns a club; north can win and shift to a diamond now|pg||
nt|ady: even a club lead  may nopt make    diamond switch later may be ok for defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: NS play a strong club system, i am guessing over 1@S a bid of 2@C is their only game force|pg||
nt|athene: after a club lead declarer can go for hearts immediately of course, but that looks risky with just a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: well when you only go for 500 with that dummy, i don't think you can be accused of rash bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: but it still costs an imp |pg||
nt|athene: maybe west comes under pressure, having to guard both majors, and you can ruff the @HK or @S10 good|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: this lead stops 6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: if declarer plays hearts early   should make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know if NS's agreement is that 2nt here is lebensohl or a scramble|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that north does not unblock - you would think he would, as then either defender can win the third heart if need be|pg||
nt|athene: but even if you play it as scramble you can use it, like this, to show a weak 3@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: (direct 3@H bid is stronger)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|athene: one possibility is to run the spades first - that often makes life hard for the defenders|pg||
nt|sharkey: He has to play on @H I think|pg||
nt|athene: i think versace might get trump squeezed|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: the trouble is, it might make things hard for you too - you have to find a couple of discards, and you also lose your dummy entries|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: if this holds the trick, what does declarer do next?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume play @C to the A and @C up.  @D A has to be in front|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is fairly sure now that north has the @HA, which makes it safer to play another heart, as north is probably not going to be the one with long hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no way the defence can set themselves up some long hearts|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|ady: North seems to have trapped himself not entering the bidding first round|pg||

nt|sharkey: Kib suggests 2@S preempt after TO x - to risky in my view as West likely to have @S virw x|pg||

nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/6.jpg rieccoli|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: maybe a better plan was to cash the @DA at trick 2, then return the heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice to see that even Fantunes can err occasionally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner started with @DKx he can cash the @DK before giving you the heart ruff, and you can give him a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no need to underlead your @DA trying to pick up @DQxx with declarer|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West might have passed - six spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might deem it unsuitable for a weak two |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: i am told, on the NS methods, if south WAS 4333, he would be 18-20, so that was out|pg||

nt|athene: no support doubles for EW |pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: east must have thought 2@S was a relay and west thought it was natural by a passed hand|pg||

mb|4H|nt|athene: if they wake up and bid a cold 4@S you just hope that your teammate are in it anyway|pg||
nt|athene: now south might discover a diamond suit tucked away there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cc says 2@s=realy, but maybe that doesn't apply by a passed hand  |pg||
nt|athene: if partner asks you for non-spade suits and you have seven in one of them, you might want to bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s presumably some sort of fit-jump|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: south is thinking how bad a dummy for diamonds his partner might put down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h-3@h might have bought it|pg||

mb|6D|nt|athene: double 3@C looks normal with west but this will work out fine anyway|pg||
