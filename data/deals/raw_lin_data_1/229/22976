nt|migry: partned couldn't have KQ@s Q@H and the A@c for a weak 2 opening bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|migry: so the only chance to beat the contract was the diamond ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  we could see the @h finesse was working, declarer couldn't so he took the percentage line even though it was doubtful that ducking the @h would have hurt|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul may stop S here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it did not stop justin, if a real overcall kevin has a clear raise|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  the problem is two fold...bidding too much or driving EW to a game they might not reach|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: Milner asks Compton, "You sure?" after the initial pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  2nd part of statement scuttled by W's raise |pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bigtrain: i don't  believe this 2@D is forcing...  if playing RM style pass-f-@D shows invitational values with diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Compton noted it was forcing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bigtrain: that is showwn by pass-f-cuebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks nearly impossible, but justin must cover if heart nine lead|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||

nt|andyv:  they are on a 31 imp run since board 34|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 43 had the dealer/vul marked wrong, and the auction started before I noticed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: looks like 43/44 are reversed (44 is S deal no vul, 43 is W deal NS vul)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: going to 45 while we let director figure things out|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|henryb:  Be easier if you played transfer advances: West could bid 2@d as a transfer, and E 3@d as a strong @s-@d hand|pg||

nt|andyv:  we will appoint you head of that committee, Martin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 44 is being played now under the original auction, but it's really 43|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: so this is going to be complicated|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no no no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I am not going to play the cards, will just do auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ie in Vugraph it's 43's cards, but it's now board 44|pg||

mb|2H|nt|chorush: I hate to admit it but I would be liely to have bid 2D N GOTEN IN TROUBLE|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfd: clock down to 8 minutes still 1 more bd after this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: I don't know the answer, actually :)  In a normal match there would probably be no immediate penalty for being <1 board behind|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: but I don't know for these types of matches|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: Let me take this oppotunity to thank Joe Matise for an excellent job keeping us informed on all the table action and mixed up boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: actually|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfd: possible imp penalties for one side I guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  best here for N to tap dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to Andy Vinock for co=commentary, spectators and USBF for making this possible and so much fun|pg||
nt|andyv:  but with stiff K@d in S  hand, declarer can take two taps in dummy |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Martin, Joe and all the specs who have joined us.|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4@S would be a very impressive contract to reach, but e-w will still win 10 imps for avoiding the doomed 3nt|pg||

mb|p|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  tricky hand for declarer...starts with 5@c and 2@h...playing J@s will give him 8th trick|pg||
