nt|fabsayc: things are getting interesting now|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West could have bid 3@H over 3@D and if he had 8-10 points he could afford to do that|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  board 36 may be the first board to be more than an imp difference as 3N will be reached in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  2@D was FG Stayman|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  a heart lead might beat 4@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  even a @d and a @h shift|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive 4@h bid doesn't deter good hands and W has a pretty good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: @D and @h shift has a better chance...  with @h lead declarer can save 3 heat winners for @C pitches since he knows the entire suit...  tougher to do with @h lead through declarer|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thru dummy that is|pg||
nt|andyv:  and he shows it by bidding that suit!|pg||
nt|ritong: tough situation|pg||
nt|ritong: east's @ss are weak, relatively|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW will have som problems here - East may give up and pass|pg||
nt|ritong: chances are defense can set them up in one round|pg||
nt|kareno: If west's hand is an opening bid, then east's is NOT a game force.  As a light opening bidder from day one, I learned that lesson early.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes this is how the bidding went|pg||
pc|d5|nt|migry: 2@s shows the blacks - not great hand|pg||
nt|ritong: so, bart bravely passes|pg||
nt|kareno: And why did west feel compelled to bid over 1@s?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: Great pass by Bramley|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bigtrain: guess its not going to work since i ignored that west is on lead  :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: has to fineese the jack at T1|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi Walter|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chorush: Very nice lead choice|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|henryb:  North has been very quiet so far with the most high cards of anyone at the table|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s, especially not doubled, as an excellent sac as 4@h should make|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|nilsland:  Declarer has to hurry with trumps|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or he will not make this|pg||
nt|ritong: i see six losers|pg||
nt|ritong: minimum|pg||
nt|nilsland:  sry I found the sixth now :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Each trump lead (for a while at least gets two of theirs for one of his).|pg||
nt|ritong: but 3 imps at stake anyway|pg||
nt|nilsland:  seven if South gets a ruff|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Can he make it in some way?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  A and small diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure he can engineer a trump coup|pg||
nt|kareno: I doubt he can make it.  Just hold it to minimum losses.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  On a @h lead this is down easily|pg||
nt|bigtrain: takes specifically a @h lead|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: now should make|pg||
nt|bigtrain: at least cn make|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no @h shift not good enough|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|ritong: he certainly has to avoid the @c ruff|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bigtrain: fineese the 10 then fineese the spade then fineese the @HJ then claim with the S entry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Interesting that S has to take the first round @h finesse on a @h shift|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think Compton might have bid 4@d immediately|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|andyv:  10 imps on board 36 to the Milner team as 3N was bid and made in open room|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|andyv:  a @h was led and then declarer played a low @c to board...N ducked and the whole club suit came home|pg||

nt|andyv:  Justin sees the Q@d in dummy...must realize the @d is stiff|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  K@d that is|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm surprised he ducked the first club|pg||

nt|andyv:  looks like declarer needed to knock out the A@d first|pg||
nt|henryb:  Guessed the wrong Ace to go after first|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: gavin trying ot claim|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should go up with A@s and return @h|pg||

mb|1D|nt|chorush: last board of set.We will resume at 10:00 Central time tomorrow|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzfd: will he open 1N or 3C or 1C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ritong: will lall o/c 1NT?|pg||
nt|ritong: ofc yes:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Sure, why not?|pg||
nt|ritong: compton opened 1NT  kranyak is more pedestrian|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ritong: but prolly more efficient|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: JK says "nice bid John"|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: This was a super result for Milner in the other room. Based on the auction they had, Justin literaly stole 4 hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: interesting race coming up for the game fulfilling trick vs game defeating trick|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|bigtrain: how did he make it?|pg||
nt|ritong: now, 4@s went down  so, questionable efficiency on this punctual board|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: Rise and play a club I think|pg||
nt|ritong: discipline helps bramley  he avoids the @d lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  tricky hand for declarer...starts with 5@c and 2@h...playing J@s will give him 8th trick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chorush: won diamond lead, play to heart in dummy, led small club. North went up K and returned club. bingo|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: win spade, diamond and more spades, but heart hook right so should make|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|chorush: EW missed a great save in 5 clubs|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: the 4@H we thought would make was doubled and down 1, 9 more to Milner "Young Guns"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our excellent operator Joann Stansby|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|bigtrain: pretty unusual decision...  partners can usually be depended on to lead singletons against suit contracts|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chorush: Norht will now eventually ruff a diamond and make|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes.  This will make easily.|pg||
nt|ritong: careful with that small @h, chris|pg||
nt|kareno: lol|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: my pleasure, see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Vugraphzfd: If @D qJ drops...|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd play the jack to define a heart entry.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: Next set when?|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, JoAnna - great job as always :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pleasure, see you later|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: this was a lame defense, made it too easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that on the 3 boards I thought would be big gains for Wolfson have turned just the opposite|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|chorush: 30 boards, 1 imp|pg||
nt|chorush: I suspect we will see a continuation of this match in the next segment, which is schedule to begin in just over n hour from now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Thanks all!|pg||
nt|andyv:  and that takes care of this hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfd: sorry lost the play of the hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: uptrick to end the rally|pg||
