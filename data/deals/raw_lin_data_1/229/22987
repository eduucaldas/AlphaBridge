mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Compton shows spades and clubs usually 6 -4|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: negative 3NT idea is, when you have a straight three level major fit, usually opener's hand is less defined than they do here|pg||

nt|fabsayc: stole Justin's cue bid|pg||
mb|2N|nt|migry: 1@h or 2@h with the west hand?|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: @D and @h shift has a better chance...  with @h lead declarer can save 3 heat winners for @C pitches since he knows the entire suit...  tougher to do with @h lead through declarer|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thru dummy that is|pg||
nt|andyv:  and he shows it by bidding that suit!|pg||

nt|andyv:  we will appoint you head of that committee, Martin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 44 is being played now under the original auction, but it's really 43|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: so this is going to be complicated|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no no no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I am not going to play the cards, will just do auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ie in Vugraph it's 43's cards, but it's now board 44|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: S opened 2@h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfd: this is no vul, S deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfd: This is being duplicated to board 43 in OR|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: i was refering to clubs and hearts, if either length switched slam was on|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chorush: I hate to admit it but I would be liely to have bid 2D N GOTEN IN TROUBLE|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfd: clock down to 8 minutes still 1 more bd after this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: I don't know the answer, actually :)  In a normal match there would probably be no immediate penalty for being <1 board behind|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: but I don't know for these types of matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: Let me take this oppotunity to thank Joe Matise for an excellent job keeping us informed on all the table action and mixed up boards|pg||
nt|kareno: I was just typing that I wonder if double would be support :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: actually|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfd: possible imp penalties for one side I guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  best here for N to tap dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to Andy Vinock for co=commentary, spectators and USBF for making this possible and so much fun|pg||
nt|andyv:  but with stiff K@d in S  hand, declarer can take two taps in dummy |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Martin, Joe and all the specs who have joined us.|pg||
nt|ritong: sounds logical  however, the debate about support doubles with decent hands remains open|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: not today, apparently:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chorush: 5 imps to Milner here since declarer now has 7 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4@S would be a very impressive contract to reach, but e-w will still win 10 imps for avoiding the doomed 3nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: maybe can run clubs thru the 4card trumps?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|chorush: srry, I missaw |pg||
pc|c2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|chorush: I missaw what happened at rick 3|pg||
nt|andyv:  Justin sees the Q@d in dummy...must realize the @d is stiff|pg||

mb|p|nt|chorush: last board of set.We will resume at 10:00 Central time tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: will he open 1N or 3C or 1C?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ritong: will lall o/c 1NT?|pg||
nt|ritong: ofc yes:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Sure, why not?|pg||
nt|ritong: compton opened 1NT  kranyak is more pedestrian|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: but prolly more efficient|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: JK says "nice bid John"|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chorush: This was a super result for Milner in the other room. Based on the auction they had, Justin literaly stole 4 hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: interesting race coming up for the game fulfilling trick vs game defeating trick|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: how did he make it?|pg||
nt|ritong: now, 4@s went down  so, questionable efficiency on this punctual board|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: Rise and play a club I think|pg||
nt|ritong: discipline helps bramley  he avoids the @d lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  tricky hand for declarer...starts with 5@c and 2@h...playing J@s will give him 8th trick|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chorush: won diamond lead, play to heart in dummy, led small club. North went up K and returned club. bingo|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: win spade, diamond and more spades, but heart hook right so should make|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|chorush: EW missed a great save in 5 clubs|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: the 4@H we thought would make was doubled and down 1, 9 more to Milner "Young Guns"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our excellent operator Joann Stansby|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bigtrain: pretty unusual decision...  partners can usually be depended on to lead singletons against suit contracts|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chorush: Norht will now eventually ruff a diamond and make|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes.  This will make easily.|pg||
nt|ritong: careful with that small @h, chris|pg||
nt|kareno: lol|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzfd: my pleasure, see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfd: If @D qJ drops...|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kareno: Next set when?|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, JoAnna - great job as always :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pleasure, see you later|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: this was a lame defense, made it too easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that on the 3 boards I thought would be big gains for Wolfson have turned just the opposite|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chorush: 30 boards, 1 imp|pg||
nt|chorush: I suspect we will see a continuation of this match in the next segment, which is schedule to begin in just over n hour from now|pg||
