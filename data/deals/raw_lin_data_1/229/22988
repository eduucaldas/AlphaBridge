nt|joest: Weinstein can bid 3@d over 1@s showing 5-5 reds should he so choose here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@S limited by failure to open 1@C  so max of 15 hcp|pg||

nt|ahollan1: either way  Woolsey blasts 4@S|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|joest: an unfortunate, but normal choice of opening lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of limited opening bid  4@S wide range, can be pure preempt as in standard/2-over-1 partnership  or  opening bid with no slam interest|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Levin: "My best chance was if he underled the AK of hearts, but it's SO EARLY."|pg||
nt|bobh1: trump lead backfired on David|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Lew conceded a heart, and we're onto the next.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: (And there is light in here!  Thank you to the hotel engineer, who showed up with a powerful generator...)|pg||
nt|joest: obviously he thought the value of 'learning' who had the heart king exceeded the % of stiff queen with garner|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 1@c = 2+|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfj: I intended making 5, not sure if that is what shows up for everyone.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: unlucky 4s down 1 on 40 trump split here if defense untangles a diamond trick|pg||
mb|2S|an|5--5 any strength|nt|joest: the nonvulnerable 4333 takeout double.  Something increasing in popularity over the last few years|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d = hearts|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Not a very friendly for either side declaring here|pg||
nt|joest: everybody upgrades 19 HCP to 20 these days.  They started out with 2NT on the east cards in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: there are various interesting structures running around about how to respond here to a takeout double after RHO has acted.|pg||
mb|3N|an|holds gf values|nt|joest: Garner will double|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: to show three hearts|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: the trouble with a splinter is you are not likely to get cooperation (ie. too strong)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so now has to continue in some way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: He's rubbing his hands over his eyes and sighing.  So early for so much angst.|pg||
nt|bobh1: N might have opened|pg||
nt|joest: and Weinstein beats a fast retreat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i suppose he could bid 5@H now, saying lots of controls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S effectively the same, except should usually be spade void|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: which might have saved a partscore swing|pg||
nt|joest: now Garner must show extras and its not clear how|pg||
nt|joest: he might try 2NT (assuming that is natural)|pg||
nt|joest: or double (which is just a general good hand but not spades this good)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: really the hand depends on club holding, which is now revealed|pg||
nt|leo lasota: interesting that 3nt would have been tough to set as it would require diamond lead or king hearts, diamond shift to set; |pg||
nt|leo lasota: unluckily for N/S Peter's reasonable diamond lead allows contract to make here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|joest: 3@h is way too commital.  He doesn't know if Weinstein has five hearts.  2@h might have been a bid from desperation|pg||
nt|joest: 3@h is definitely a bid from desperation!  :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|bobh1: no i guess u want to defend on this deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Jonathan brings the @D5 closest to thumb, then puts it back and goes with @HK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Very different auction than at the other table...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie confirms that 3@S was a splinter and 4@S was a cue.|pg||
nt|joest: this might (will) make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota: E/W did fair in the other room in declaring hearts to come home with 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfj: Carding asked, Stevie explains that the play suit preference usually at trick 1, otherwise standard count|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|leo lasota: ace spades good safety play to make contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|leo lasota: small diamond helpful for E/W|pg||
nt|joest: so now they can cash their spade before it goes away but that means declarer gets two pitches on the spade and the diamond|pg||

nt|leo lasota: unlucky opening lead, but very well played by weinstein|pg||
nt|joest: yes.  he had to lead a low club or somehow work out to lead the queen or ten of diamonds : somewhat double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: so weinstein gets a few back|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 14 HCP; good 5 card spade suit and 3 hearts|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: a standard problem for north|pg||
nt|joest: do you stayman or not?|pg||
nt|joest: Demiriev did at the other table|pg||
nt|leo lasota: good save in open room against 4h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: N's hand doesn't fit into the usual parameters|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: It has been pointed out by several observers that the two Weinsteins make this a little hard to follow... we are watching Jonathan Weinstein, the captain of the Weinstein team.  At ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: the other table you can see Stevie Weinstein playing for Fleisher.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i wonder if 4m is a splinter or fit-showing?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobh1: so he chooses to show a limit raise, usualy 4 trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2NT is explained as invitational with hearts.  In response to Chip's questions, David writes, "usually four."|pg||
nt|bobh1: he probably intends to bid 4@C even if jonathan declines, which i dont think he will|pg||
nt|bobh1: most pairs play some kind of bromad after the double|pg||
nt|leo lasota: would be a 1nt consideration if the jack of diamonds was in another suit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby commented afterwards that he should've flashed Andy his @HQ, perhaps he would've passed 4@H.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a little gamesmanship|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: But he didn't know that he should flash it to Andy instead of Franco.  Franco then launched into an explanation of the "fishhead coup," which it seems we can expect to see on ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Bridgewinners soon...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: S asking about 2@s bid now... can't read the answer but obviously liked it |pg||
nt|joest: Over a puppet call you have no inference partner has even four hearts so you're constrained to pass as south|pg||
nt|joest: now in your partnerships is double: (a) I have four spades or (b) takeout?  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: interesting decision to pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie: "Good thing it's only a 15-board segment."|pg||
nt|joest: I think 2NT is kind of practical here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Steve/Peter have reasonable methods for handling competition with their puppet auctions|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d seems like he has put the hand into game force mode to me but obviously I don't know |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: two rounds of hearts and three of spades for down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby confirms that they play upside-down count and attitude at trick 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gu gesticulating somewhat wildly with his hands to explain to Chip the meaning of 2@S.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Looks like the message was conveyed.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: N trying to figure out what the right answer is...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: turns out N/S had a good club fit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphzfj: Andy pauses, Bobby apologizes for playing too fast.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: 3@s is a bold bid|pg||
nt|joest: motivated by the colors no doubt|pg||
pc|s2|nt|leo lasota: motivated by the colors and the extra shape of 64 in the black suits|pg||
nt|joest: well so far their methods have not gotten them to mentions hearts.  |pg||

pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfj: Gu asks about leads: 4th|pg||
nt|leo lasota: appears peter maybe should have taken a call over 3s |pg||
nt|joest: perhaps he thought pass was forcing.  Or perhaps he should just hit it with AQx of spades and take at least some plus|pg||
nt|joest: in 'standard' it might just go stayman, 2@s, 3@h on the assumption partner has four hearts, and then 4@h|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I believe that dbl by robinson after 1nt-p-2c-2s-p-p- would have shown dblton spade|pg||
nt|joest: a good agreement.   Wonder what 2Nt would have been.  In any event, this is not an auction you see every day and even the best of pairs might not see it eye-to-eye|pg||

mb|1D|nt|joest: Flannery to the rescue|pg||
nt|leo lasota: flannery|pg||
nt|leo lasota: only slight downgrade by steve with 16; very reasonable 4522, especially non vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: with system on redouble forces 3@C to get out in either minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: To clarify, the defense did not play three rounds of spades.  After the first spade, Franco shifted to a club.|pg||
nt|joest: double by Weinstein would be pretty aggressive in my view at these colors|pg||
nt|leo lasota: steve/peter aggressive 1 minor openers; |pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfj: 1@S is not a misclick.  David slightly atilt.|pg||
nt|joest: I'm not sure the risk-reward ratio stands up|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Providing the otherwise unattainable second hook.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Shi conferring again with Lew about 2@H, his eyebrows furrowed...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter already feeling very good about contract after lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: correction bd 94..2H +1|pg||
nt|leo lasota: from his perspective, he needs either ace diamond or ace spade onside now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobh1: dont blame him for trying 1@S in that situation|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: at the other table Demirev also 'downgraded' to 2@d flannery|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: The first sigh of the session from Shi...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|leo lasota: yes, but he then felt nervous about downgrade and bid again over partner's 2h call|pg||
nt|leo lasota: if trumps had been 22, he would have had extra shot|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: In other words, playing behind screens, you cannot call the director over a hesitation that occurred on YOUR side, because presumably the other side is in the dark about who took ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: the time.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie then clarified that it was his turn to lead "before I do anything else illegal."|pg||
nt|bobh1: but it got his partner off to an unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota: by cashing 3 rds clubs and if thiose split 33, pitch spade from hand then lead spade up|pg||
nt|leo lasota: if that loses, opp can cash one more spade, then they must break the diamond suit with Jx opposite Kxx for peter|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i was just typing  --  i bet Woolsey expects 5@C|pg||
nt|joest: i don't whether he should or not|pg||
nt|joest: how often would/should Stewart begin with 1Nt with a hand with five clubsin it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N can include 5@C/@D(332)|pg||
nt|3for3:  In these forcing auctions, it is often best to establish nt as playable, then worry about suits on the 3 level, instead of the other way around|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: and immediate 2@C = game force 5+ suit|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|joest: since 1NT was a GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: could he have five clubs?|pg||
nt|joest: you can get back to 3NT from 2@c|pg||
nt|joest: it's hard to see how to get to a 5-3 club fit after 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Kit mumbling, not happily|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4N discouraging --- to everyone|pg||
nt|joest: so if you are ultimately going to gamble out a diamond stopper with 4NT then maybe 2Nt a round back wasn't so bad|pg||
nt|3for3:  if you belong in clubs, surely partner can bid them over 2N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: HW asks "is everything like it sounds here?" Kit: "I think it is; Fred?" Stewart: "what does it sound like?" "natural" "I thought 4N was a slam try"|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|joest: this looks one level too high|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|leo lasota: with Jxx spades and 10xxx clubs, from peter's perspective this is a hand he needs to make an attacking lead against 3nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|leo lasota: hence the ultra conservative view|pg||
nt|joest: to me 2@s is ultra-conservative, yes|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter's 1nt = 11-14 with less than 4 spades, 1, 2, or 3 hearts|pg||
nt|leo lasota: if 3 hearts, he has less than 5 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: robinson therefore passes 1nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota: another rule in play when deciding whether to rebid hearts or pass 1nt\|pg||
nt|leo lasota: with 5 card maj|pg||
nt|leo lasota: with decent 9 or 10, just pass and partner usually will be able to scramble 1nt on power|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|joest: over 2@d, if partner preferences to 2@s, you can now bid 3@s and south will accept with the hand he has.  One possible auction|pg||
nt|leo lasota: friendly start for peter|pg||
nt|leo lasota: low club shift at trick 2 seems apparent from east hand when j diamond holds|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter reasonable will split club KQ; if he does get low club shift and he finds duck from hand, that would be amazing|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|bobh1: he might have tried 2N, which is probably a serious game try|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|jdonn:  the 3@C bid showed just hearts (whereas 3@H would have shown hearts and clubs). That switch is to make room for a "waiting" 3@D bid when opener has just hearts|pg||

nt|leo lasota: NF constructive|pg||
nt|joest: I play it 100% forcing|pg||
nt|joest: rightly or wrongly it solves a lot of problems|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest: 2NT = "good/bad"  "I am just competing in clubs"|pg||
nt|joest: now it will be difficult to find the spade suit at all|pg||
nt|joest: and to me this goes back to the failure (or inability) to bid 1@son the first round|pg||
nt|joest: but they might recover.  Let's see|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobh1: if declarer can avoid 3 trump losers he can make 4@S|pg||
nt|jdonn:  east's 1nt bid instead of double is surely influenced by the fact that north didn't really promise diamonds apparantly|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it looks like NS have 9 tricks on the fly here if they find them, which i think they will|pg||
nt|jdonn:  north may have to think about it, the 6 of hearts could be low from a better holding. but i still think he finds the diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: Peetr had the option of bidding 1S last time, but chose to show the 3 card LR in diamonds instead|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|leo lasota: back to Steve's first bid|pg||
nt|joest: but bidding 1@s doesn't preclude finding diamonds.  Bidding 2@c makes it harder to find spades|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter had an alternative option on his last bid|pg||
nt|leo lasota: dbl would have been snapdragon, normally showing a dblton spade and 5+ hearts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|leo lasota: with solid opening bid, honor 3rd of both majors, dbl with 3361 was reasonable alternative to 1D|pg||
nt|joest: just my opinion though.  Many others disagree|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: peter reasonably decided to just raise spades since opponents have announce the hand is theirs on power by opening and making a free bid of 2d|pg||
nt|leo lasota: this makes it easy for steve should they end up on defense, plus gives steve the option of bidding spades again with extra shape|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Jan Martel, who makes the Vugraph happen, has given me an alternative wireless network to try if we get disconnected again.  So the next shutdown (which hopefully will not happen) ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Shi asks Lew how weak their style can be.  Lew says usually six, can be five if something else to go with it.|pg||
nt|joest: Doubling three clubs here should be an option to save. I don't think you double to hear your own voice|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: "Good luck."  "Thank you."|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Another swing here one way or another... looks down on the lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota: great decision by peter of 3S here|pg||

nt|leo lasota: fooled west into believing that his partner did not hold more than 2 spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|jdonn:  south opens 2C so they seem to be playing precision, that shows a minimum opener with long clubs|pg||
nt|leo lasota: relatively dull hand here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 11 HCP is usually a 1H opener for robinson here, but red all with 3 of the points as stiff king he has to ponder whether to open|pg||
nt|leo lasota: as is their style, he takes the aggressive view and opens|pg||
nt|leo lasota: almost certain this will result in excellent 6C contract|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jdonn:  and west's double instead of 2S is really interesting|pg||
nt|jdonn:  2S may not be totally safe but i think the double is weird anyway|pg||
nt|jdonn:  4S is worthwhile but goes down on a heart finesse here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Bobby asks about the 9, and Andy explains that it's Rusinow.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jdonn:  or a diamond ruff, so even 3S goes down|pg||

mb|4C|nt|Vugraphzfj: Franco confirms that the NT range is 14+-17, which it is.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  probably a push, it's a 25 point game with a 9 card major suit fit, and vulnerable at imps, you wouldn't usually want to avoid those|pg||
nt|leo lasota: steve's min opener has gotten much better on auction|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Interesting 1N here|pg||
nt|jdonn:  north bids 2S, it looks kind of normal but I much prefer 1S since the defense is very good and it would be a great dummy for hearts|pg||
nt|leo lasota: At these colors, Peter may just pass when east shows the majors, despite being 55|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jdonn:  you much prefer to preempt with a suit like KQJxxx than AT9xxx|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now south will bid 4S or maybe 4D, west will bid 5C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  and everything pretty much rests on south taking the push to 5|pg||
nt|joest: 1@H = spades|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT = 17-19|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: transfer to @S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jdonn:  it sure looks right, but a lot of people are reluctant to bid 5 over 5|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if one of north's heart was in clubs NS might even make 5S, so it's hard to see not doing it|pg||
nt|jdonn:  also, suppose south wasnt planning to bid 5S on his own here, then he should have bid 4D instead of 4S so that north might bid 5S if it was right|pg||
nt|leo lasota: king diamonds unfortunate lead by steev|pg||
nt|leo lasota: can now make 3 for E/W|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jdonn:  that way north would know to defend with short diamonds and bid with long diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jdonn:  here it didnt matter a lot since south is always bidding on to 5|pg||
nt|jdonn:  we will see if east bids on to 6, i doubt it thought|pg||
nt|jdonn:  though|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jdonn:  he will probably just defend with his strength opposite an opening hand and opponents having been pushed up, but you can never be sure|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the other table took a flyer at 6C, they didnt even get pushed there|pg||
nt|jdonn:  some days it's right, not today though|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|leo lasota: 10 clubd rusinow|pg||
nt|leo lasota: shows jack or 3 card or fewere suit; may have higher if have jack|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobh1: S's response on air makes it tough for EW to find their game|pg||
nt|bobh1: same at the other table|pg||
nt|leo lasota: trump lead from QJ98 seemed like reasonable alternative|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stark is not entirely sure about the bid here|pg||
nt|jdonn:  and east does the right thing this time|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jdonn:  so it's certainly down 1 with down 2 possible|pg||
nt|jdonn:  uh oh|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now if north guesses what is happening in diamonds he might make it|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|jdonn:  east wanted a heart ruff|pg||
nt|leo lasota: of course peter hopiong for KJ10xx :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|leo lasota: duck spade and hand makes 3nt if either major is 33|pg||
nt|leo lasota: cash ace first in case see honor|pg||
nt|leo lasota: higher % then leading low diamond toweards jack|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Bathroom break..|pg||
nt|joest: you can cross to the heart and play a diamond to the ten|pg||
nt|leo lasota: which works if guesses robinson for honor x or peter for KQ(xx)|pg||
nt|joest: wins if RHO has Hx|pg||
nt|joest: or KQxx|pg||
nt|leo lasota: diamond to ten only gains on KQ both in peter hand or honor x|pg||
nt|leo lasota: way against the odds with steve having marked clubs|pg||
nt|joest: I'm trying to weigh that % vs spades 33|pg||
nt|leo lasota: honor dblton from peter's hand that is|pg||
nt|leo lasota: definitely xcorrect tio cash one high spade first|pg||
nt|joest: and if lho drops an honor?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: then he has tro decide to bang or play heart to ace and spade to 9|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
pc|s6|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|jdonn:  so this does come down to how declarer plays the diamond suit|pg||
nt|jdonn:  and he has a real chance to go right, he will see east is 2-2 in the majors and probably has 5 clubs given west's bidding|pg||
nt|leo lasota: wow nice smooth duck diamond; now makes 4!|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|leo lasota: his play best|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jdonn:  but also declarer might not want to go for 500 but taking a deep finesse in diamonds, so it's a tough call|pg||
nt|jdonn:  there is a lot riding on this in such a close match|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if declarer is going to finesse for the jack he has to start doing it on the first round, leading to the king first isn't good enough|pg||
nt|jdonn:  then east's remaining AJ8 would prevent a third trick from developing|pg||
pc|d3|nt|leo lasota: cash second spade see jack, then ace diamond diamond|pg||
pc|s7|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|leo lasota: 1nt will make here at least for E/W|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jdonn:  declarer will put in the 10 from dummy and be off to a good start|pg||
nt|jdonn:  3NT went down at the other table on a heart lead, north had risked a 1H overcall|pg||
nt|jdonn:  so there is a good chance of a swing here|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i was just asked why south would lead low instead of the queen from this holding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: NS play sort of upsidedown smith|pg||
nt|jdonn:  against notrump you want to develop the length in your suit so the honor is very valuable, if partner has a singleton or doubleton A K or T then if you start with low the suit won't be blocked|pg||
nt|jdonn:  if south had QJT or QJ9 he would risk the honor but anything worse than that low is more normal in notrump|pg||
nt|jdonn:  against a suit contract south would normally lead the queen, now as long as anyone has a doubleton you don't want to blow a fast trick|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i dont really see 3nt going down here as long as he puts in the 10 of spades|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter has 3 keys plus q |pg||
pc|d7|nt|jdonn:  even if he starts clubs with an honor, holding himself to 2 tricks there, he can get the last trick in hearts and the defense can't do anything|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but he already showed his extras with 2nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 10 spades my choice against 3nt|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: There is a lot of deep sighing and head-scratching going on.  It's been that kind of set.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: steve would have to find small heart shift here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: to hold to one|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jdonn:  he didn't put in the spade ten, very interesting|pg||
nt|joest: well for starters, it's not clear Boyd will read this as being from shortness and recognize Garner as the danger hand|pg||
nt|joest: seems to me Boyd needs to guess quite well to roll this in|pg||
nt|leo lasota: reason 10 spades may be better; give south Kx spades and north J9x|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzfj: Not so much from Andy and Franco.  When things got rough, Franco ate a banana.|pg||

nt|leo lasota: right; 3 card or less|pg||

mb|p|nt|jdonn:  and here we have it, this shows why passing 1S is a good idea once you know you don't belong in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: lucky 3nt here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|leo lasota: makes b/c west has king spades, q clubs, and he has only singleton or dblton spade king|pg||
nt|leo lasota: robinson will of course cash one high club after ducking 2 hearts|pg||
nt|leo lasota: in case he sees the stiff q|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|jdonn:  and even worse|pg||
nt|leo lasota: when protectign against 52 break|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jdonn:  lee holds hearts over the 1H response, and enough trumps and overall strength that he risks a double and it will pay off for him|pg||
nt|leo lasota: however, suit was marked 61 on auction|pg||
nt|leo lasota: then plays to dummy's ace diamonds and leads j spades playing for K or Kx in West, then reenters dummyin spades, takes club finesse|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jdonn:  this is a great trump lead i think, partner probably has hearts to double here so if EW take out the trumps then NS will be very short on tricks|pg||
nt|jdonn:  since east has the minors locked up|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|leo lasota: fairly lucky to escape with 8 tricks her with the Qxx diamonds|pg||
nt|leo lasota: even though it is true he would have had 9 with same diamond holding plus the ace club onside|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|jdonn:  that's another plus to the double, not only do you increase your score but you help partner make a good lead|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the other table shows exactly how i think the auction should have gone|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jdonn:  lee will win this diamond and play another trump, then win either a heart or a diamond overruff, declarer is just in big trouble here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfj: Just disconnected briefly, have not missed anything.  Andy in the tank.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie consults the convention card again: "All right."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: There appears to be some sort of sighing contest between Bobby and Stevie.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "You're jack leads are standard, right?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "Yep."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "He DID lead the jack, right?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: "I don't remember."|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|leo lasota: nice to gain 3 imps when saving in 3nt against 2 maj other table|pg||
nt|leo lasota: :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|jdonn:  this heart play was harmless since declarer can't get to dummy to ruff any more hearts in hand|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i think this will be down 3|pg||
nt|leo lasota: his choice of plays not best|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|leo lasota: should have pitched diamond from dummy cashed ace clubs then duiamond over spade|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|leo lasota: on this hand, no matter as he will end with 3 spades, 1 heart, 1 diamond, 4 clubs|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|jdonn:  now he wants to overruff and play a trump for sure|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|jdonn:  weird|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now it's just down 2|pg||
nt|jdonn:  or maybe not|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i see|pg||
nt|jdonn:  declarer can't really get to dummy for the club finesse|pg||
nt|jdonn:  and if he ever plays a diamond west can just throw a club|pg||
nt|jdonn:  so there is more than one way to skin a cat|pg||
nt|jdonn:  this will be 11 imps for lee, putting them on a big 44-4 run after the 0-18 start to this set|pg||
nt|jdonn:  lee deserves all the credit for doubling|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|leo lasota: he knows this will make now|pg||

nt|jdonn:  so here we have a slam for NS|pg||
nt|leo lasota: unlucky for N/S AQJ spades all offside|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|leo lasota: 4h here by south; north will continually rejct any forward going moves by south for slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2 more bds to go before we break for lunch..Seg 7/8 scheduled to start 3:45 CDT|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jdonn:  it would be most straightforward in notrump, though if they stumble into a red suit they will be fine|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Vugraphzfj: There seems to be a misunderstanding about Lew's double.  Gu just asked Chip if it showed clubs, and Chip said yes.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: in about 1  hr|pg||
nt|joest: now B-R may well play some form of 'serious 3NT" here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: a little surprised robinson did not make 4h "fast arrival"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: likely N/S end in 3S here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfj: Chip had pulled 2@H out of the box, then changed his mind and tried 2@D.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|leo lasota: requires diamond lead to set 3S|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2nt by peter is 4+ spades; LR+|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfj: Shi wrote something about 3@C, but sadly my eyesight does not extend so far.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: ... and we're caught up again, minus some of the pesky details.  Last board this set, hopefully the next will bring us better luck.|pg||
nt|joest: some play that denies side suit controls|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2H was GF, promising 5+|pg||
nt|leo lasota: the fats arrival 100% denies 4 controls|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  the other table made 7 by sneaking the club over early|pg||
mb|2S|nt|leo lasota: fast|pg||
nt|joest: depending on if they play 'serious 3NT", then 4@c is a very constructive slam try|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 3nt would have been non serious slam try; 4C was serious|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 4h rejects|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn:  it pretty much will come down to north inviting slam and south accepting|pg||
nt|jdonn:  this 3D bid is weird with two ltitle diamonds and all the strength in the majors, i thought after 3C it would go 3NT 4NT 6NT or so|pg||
nt|jdonn:  now it comes down to agreements and style, but obviously north will move forward somehow|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: some pairs play that it's so constructive north would be compelled to Q the diamond king here|pg||
nt|joest: anyway they arrive in the right spot; now make it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: At this point, I'm not sure I can reliably enter all the results for the preceding hands, so we may have to wait on the official score.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sol, the director, comes in to remind the players that they are in overtime.  Franco says yes, they know.|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it's not clear whether 4NT is rkc or a quantitative invite|pg||
nt|jdonn:  some partnerships would play 4nt is natural inviting slam, and if north wants to bid rkc for diamonds he has to set them as trumps by bidding 4d first|pg||
pc|h7|nt|leo lasota: certainly the 1nt bid by east slows down game possibilities from Peter's perspective|pg||
nt|leo lasota: good result here for N/S of +140|pg||
nt|leo lasota: cash both hearts duck club|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jdonn:  even now it's not clear, if south is accepting the slam invitation he might just be showing a good heart suit|pg||
nt|joest: well that lead won't make it harder|pg||
pc|h3|nt|leo lasota: quick push here at 450 likely|pg||
nt|leo lasota: playing imps, lead low trump out of hand here is reasonable|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it might also be showing keycards, some play that if you accept the slam invitation you show keycards anyway|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|leo lasota: exactly|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jdonn:  south converts 6D to 6NT since he can't see much reason to play in diamonds, which makes you wonder why he bid 3D in the first place|pg||
nt|jdonn:  i think the reason was in case his partner could bid 3H he would want to play in 4H|pg||
nt|jdonn:  that is actually not unreasonable|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jdonn:  lee goes for the glory on lead but today it just leads to a push|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jdonn:  if dummy had KJ of clubs it was the only card in his hand to give him a chance to set|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Director tells the players that they will not have any time between sessions.  "Fine with me."|pg||
nt|jdonn:  I'm talking to myself, plus all the comments from the spectators hitting me that I can't really reply to, those are like the voices in my head. So pretty much I feel like a crazy person|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 1H - P - 4H would put West in alot of pressure|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jdonn:  this last board seems like a straightforward 4S, but things might get a little interesting with trumps 5-0|pg||
nt|jdonn:  declarer can make it anyway although in practice it's very easy to go down|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jdonn:  2D here is some kind of heart raise, I think EW play transfers on this auction|pg||
nt|jdonn:  it looks like EW have at least 4 tricks, a club 2 diamonds and a trump|pg||
nt|jdonn:  but if declarer never plays trumps at all he can score 2 hearts, a club, and 7 trumps by ruffing back and forth|pg||
nt|leo lasota: But now Robinson is guessing with his 55 as well|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jdonn:  if he plays even one round then east can win a club and play a second round|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: good decision to bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Kamil trying to figure out if he should bid...|pg||
nt|jdonn:  then it would be hard|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2h here for weinstein will be final contract|pg||
nt|leo lasota: dbl by west ends auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Again, the 10 is Rusinow.|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: even though peter has his bidding shoes on today, would be silly to balance here |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: That's it for this session, thanks all for your patience!|pg||
nt|jdonn:  the risk of a ruff somewhere is probably greater than the risk of a 5-0 trump break plus both diamonds being off, i think it would be hard to blame declarer if he goes down here|pg||
nt|jbgood: same lead as in the OR|pg||
nt|leo lasota: likely only d1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Vugraphzfj: Making a bad situation worse...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jdonn:  this will be won by east who will probably switch to a heart|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobh1: the ever popular trump lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota: spade, club shift?|pg||
nt|joest: club shift wiill beat it|pg||

pc|d3|nt|jbgood: a di switch at the other table..|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h9|nt|jdonn:  now declarer might play a diamond|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|jdonn:  heart continuation|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jdonn:  or might west play more diamonds? it's not unthinkable but i think he will continue hearts|pg||
nt|jdonn:  he fooled me before though|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|leo lasota: correct play by steve for d1|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfj: Franco tells Andy, who had gone for a bathroom break and returned after the hand was played, that they made 3, but "that the club lead was important."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The bathroom is conveniently located in the same room.  We are in individual hotel rooms.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Short break here, I will need a CC from one of the players to update the scores before we can go on with our broadcast. Sho|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: *Short intermission :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jdonn:  and he has done it again by making the only play i didnt predict. maybe that was risky if declarer had a singleton club|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|leo lasota: establish 1 spade trick for 8 trumps, 1 spade, 1 diamond = down 1|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|jdonn:  now he might make it|pg||
