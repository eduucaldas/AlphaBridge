nt|mdgraham: guessing on 2@c - could be natural, could be a limited 3-suiter - sry, don't have CC for NS|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: west hand is too ugly for any bid in my opinion|pg||

nt|mdgraham: rehi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: balance by north pushes  e/w overboard|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is a transfer to clubs here i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course madala knows his opponents have at least a game, and quite possibly more, so he makes as much noise as he can|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: El remate hubo stayman y luego 3 st.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missed opportunity for trailing team|pg||
nt|runnerup:  nice kvick tricks in 3nt and south has no problems to bid that|pg||
nt|athene: good low-hcp 3nt; 100% secure on any lead and any lie|pg||
nt|athene: yes it shows the power of a long suit with quick tricks outside|pg||
nt|athene: NS don't have a single point wasted in fact|pg||
nt|athene: maybe Duboin is wondering which major to lead?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time 4 @s is anly 300 but you lose in a long run if you bid those -because in all cases ns aren't aware what they do and 3nt can go down|pg||
nt|athene: yes i don't think EW can reasonably contemplate a sacrifice|pg||
nt|athene: -300 vs -400 is the best you can possibly hope for|pg||
nt|athene: and it might often be -300 or -500 against +50|pg||
pc|s9|mc|9|nt|sharkey: yes - but 3@H looks like a make so down 1 may be good business|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts should make   so -50  best e/w can do|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Director came in to ask if anyone had a cell phone.  Levin: "Call me and find out."|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning folks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks makeable if levin gets clubs right, which he should after the light overcall|pg||

nt|sharkey: we shall never know....|pg||
nt|athene: i think he can be sure that east has short clubs, but even so, bidding 6 is not so easy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that wouild probably be a rotten pairs score |pg||
nt|runnerup:  west can wander where ns's tricks come if they make this -south must have lond @d -like 6 cards -north is more balanced perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: probably EW will get a free run in the other room, so then it is a matter of east's rebid after 1@D 1@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sharkey: Some number of @D here...|pg||
nt|athene: west neither strong nor unbalanced enough for 2@C opener in first or second, but here the requirements are relaxed|pg||
nt|gsper:  NS can make a lot in @S|pg||
nt|athene: will Angelini bid 1@S or show the 2-suiter?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: some prefer to keep the 2-suited overcalls weak or very strong, so a 12 count might not qualify|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|ady: 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW may not stop yet|pg||

nt|mdgraham: good evening all. |pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: Can't see W have another bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c 10-13, 5+@C, could be weaker in third seat|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Markku|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now north has to decide between 3@H and a second double|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: sharp double would reap 300|pg||
nt|queequeg: @s@S ====== Running Scores ====== @S@S|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|athene: close decision in my opinion|pg||
nt|runnerup:  vulnerability is bad so north has about cards to expect by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|gsper:  So 4@S is a good save, but unlikely to be found now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no chance here of course|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you just play spades and accept two down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double is more flexible, as they say|pg||
nt|queequeg: players in both the rooms:|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south has shape -not points but |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - but neither N nor S can x|pg||
nt|queequeg: welcome to our commentators: Mike Graham and Markku Pekkinen :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobholl: with the @H lead surely|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/1.jpg|pg||
nt|queequeg: Open room, waiting to start|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: a double for takeout by north if available would have worked well|pg||
nt|queequeg: welcome Bob :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: N obviously knows what to expect from 2@h |pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|gsper:  N might have doubled 2@D, but with both opponents showing cards, and vul, it was not very attractive|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H finesse and can make. 6@H+1@S+2@D+1@C=10|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would make this, but E may be good enough to find a losing line|pg||
pc|sT|nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/2.jpg|pg||
nt|runnerup:  even 4 ! has chance but so little strentgh |pg||
nt|runnerup:  @h|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4@S bid at the other table was perhaps unwise, left east guessing whose hand it was|pg||
pc|dK|nt|queequeg: Closed room|pg||
nt|runnerup:  aouth likes to defende 3 @d  -tx partner it is-because in many cases -he cant see to pass|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed has no other choice.:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  How much did 2@D show?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That is we can see all cards.|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/17.jpg Closed Room|pg||
nt|runnerup:  +100 with best lead -@h possible but  50 now --140 for ns looks odds on in @s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: even with this nice start, and trumps 3-3, declarer should be one down|pg||
nt|athene: east just holds up in spades and there is nowhere to put the @D109|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure east did not especially like leading that unsupported ace, but it's just that nothing else appealed at all|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: ended quietly for 130|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about this kind of canape approach - if it is systematic|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/16.jpg Open room|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|gsper:  @H raise or natural forcing I am told|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: S might have tried 3@S, but 3@h feels like a definite statement |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: is declarer going to cash the @CAK then try a spade to hand, hoping if that holds, to play a club throwing the @HA?|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's not a bad plan :)|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes that sort of thing is useful but here even if it worked, it would not help especially|pg||
nt|athene: even if clubs break you get 2 hearts, 4 clubs, spade...that's not 3NT by a fair way|pg||
nt|athene: in the play here the defence would have time to attack diamonds anyway|pg||

nt|queequeg: @H CAITI Stefano       @H PATTACINI Maurizio    @H ZAFFINO Maurizio|pg||
nt|athene: in the bidding, a hidden issue is whether north's "double-then-3@H" route showed just any hand too strong for 2@H first time, or whether it does promise a flexible hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: over a normal weak-two opener by opponents, a jump overcall is strong e.g. (2@D) 3@H|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/6.jpg Open Room|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: did the diamonds really go like that? seems odd|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: so you could argue that double then bidding a suit doesn't show a hand that definitely wants to commit to that suit|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Levin: "My best chance was if he underled the AK of hearts, but it's SO EARLY."|pg||
nt|bobh1: trump lead backfired on David|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Lew conceded a heart, and we're onto the next.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: (And there is light in here!  Thank you to the hotel engineer, who showed up with a powerful generator...)|pg||
mb|1N!|an|12-14|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: I intended making 5, not sure if that is what shows up for everyone.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|fabsayc: the trouble with a splinter is you are not likely to get cooperation (ie. too strong)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so now has to continue in some way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: He's rubbing his hands over his eyes and sighing.  So early for so much angst.|pg||
nt|bobh1: N might have opened|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i suppose he could bid 5@H now, saying lots of controls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S effectively the same, except should usually be spade void|pg||
mb|5S|nt|bobh1: which might have saved a partscore swing|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: really the hand depends on club holding, which is now revealed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: no i guess u want to defend on this deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Jonathan brings the @D5 closest to thumb, then puts it back and goes with @HK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Very different auction than at the other table...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie confirms that 3@S was a splinter and 4@S was a cue.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfj: Carding asked, Stevie explains that the play suit preference usually at trick 1, otherwise standard count|pg||

nt|mdgraham: two off with the spade misguess - but it was never making|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we all know the feeling - we are quite happy, until the result of the first board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then it all goes downhill |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: defence went plus, but it might have gone better|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@D=majors|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  should make on the lay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d probably 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|gsper:  1NT 12-14, often offshape|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: maybe can block the diamonds and survive|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Transfer, of course. E was doing the thinking|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: i prefer 2@C for that purpose, as partner can bid 2@D with no preference|pg||
nt|athene: interesting, he doesn't go 4@H|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt ew here and if something /else ) happens -it is a suprice|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with opening 4@H is that if opps bid 4@S or 5@C over it, as they very likely will, you are left not knowing what to do|pg||
nt|athene: you would probably be tempted to bid 5@D as partner will never imagine what you have|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: Assume 2@S constructive - surprised S didnt make an advance towards game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s requests 2NT |pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: there's a saying : 65 come alive how about 75 ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@d transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a lot of 11's are opened these days|pg||
mb|r|nt|athene: however, the way it has gone, he has hardly shown his hand either|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: this auction would show extras for me, and for sure that double was penalty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: twice armed is he, etc|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@H transfer to @S and 2@S for @S check. Am I right?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @s proposed and i would like that too -1. round bid --now ew came in bidding|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gsper:  Surely|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@D is hearts and 3@S is a super-accept, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D retransfer|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello CK and wlc.|pg||
nt|athene: yes i think just bidding 4 right away with north is reasonable|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not see how South can know what is useful and what is not.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: might have a club slam opposite suitable cards, but it's shooting for the moon a bit - 3NT is practical |pg||
nt|athene: might be 4@H or 4@D for them|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: on a club attack declarer might have to overtake in spades to get a fast pitch from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know what the redouble was|pg||
nt|athene: and i can't believe angelini did either|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: maybe if the auction had tempoed out differently he would have bid - for example if west made some raise and then east bid 4@S and that was passed round to him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although if the @s10 forces the king the defence would need an immediate diamond switch|pg||
nt|athene: so losing one heart, one diamond, and one club|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: perhaps being NV was a factor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: let's hope we are guessing well|pg||
nt|athene: on any other lead he can happily unblock the @SK as he has time to build an entry to his @SAQ, so plus one|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Rashed & Goran|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: ace and club shift looks best here|pg||
nt|athene: i mean even without peeking :)|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|henryb:  "I like @s" perhaps?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: another problem on defense for west, succeeds if he clears the spades, but also must unguard the diamonds later|pg||
nt|athene: but as it went, bidding 5@D in front of his partner is a bit of a gamble|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: the other table you can see Stevie Weinstein playing for Fleisher.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i wonder if 4m is a splinter or fit-showing?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobh1: so he chooses to show a limit raise, usualy 4 trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2NT is explained as invitational with hearts.  In response to Chip's questions, David writes, "usually four."|pg||
nt|bobh1: he probably intends to bid 4@C even if jonathan declines, which i dont think he will|pg||

nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: Damas total: 182-118|pg||
nt|queequeg: the palace where we play is a very artistic place|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/9.jpg |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: doubt if there will be any surprises on this one either - 4@h EW|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|mb|1H|nt|sharkey: 30 points between them - cud be probing slam...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10-13, 5+@d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|athene: same sort of bidding problem for south here as faced north a moment ago over the 2@C opener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sort of like a strong weak two|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni-nunes 2-level bids do give their opponents some hard decisions|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: holaa|pg||
nt|mdgraham: getting any higher would not be advisable|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobholl: common expert treatment is 1NT on N hand |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a string weak two is presumably a bit weaker than a weak strong two|pg||
nt|athene: or a bit weaker than a rope weak two i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: interesting decision for north there|pg||
nt|runnerup:  partial figth in majors common situation 3 @h is winner if found |pg||
nt|queequeg: Open room: http://td.bboitalia.it/22.jpg|pg||

nt|queequeg: these are the rooms where we play :) u can see what a wonderful place|pg||
nt|queequeg: Closed room: http://td.bboitalia.it/21.jpg|pg||
nt|athene: pass (bit wet), double (if takeout), 2@D (your best suit) or 1@S (spades!) all worth consideration|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: declarer should make 10 tricks sometime today|pg||
nt|sharkey: All artificial bids sofar - assume 2@C relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: @s@S ====== Running Scores ====== @S@S|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: lanzarotti obviously takes 2@S as showing a very weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: the immediate bid after the redouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I guess N could double 3@d with a good(ish) hand |pg||
nt|athene: you might say "well, obviously north must be broke, after the opponents have both shown decent hands"|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will be a bit worried here; only 8 obvious tricks even with the club finesse working|pg||
nt|psyck: I like dbl of the options|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not sure about this - 2@c may be Gazzilli |pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobholl: @c queen is a nice card but not shown|pg||
nt|athene: well, no 4@C, so madala knows they are off the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: they'll play six, though, i would think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: oh well :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@h not very good needs @C 32 and king rigth most times|pg||
nt|athene: but the point is, if you work out what partner has by trusting your opponents, then you get talked out of games when west has psyched the redouble|pg||
nt|psyck: beautiful venue indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but the spades are blocked so he can play on diamonds successfully|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: need to be cautious    even 5 level could be too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nobody ever won at bridge by trusting the opponents|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't think Sementa would compete to 3 level with a 4333 hand, but it works fine here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: so having agreements with partner is a better way to go, what with him being on your side|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most of the time.....|pg||
nt|athene: south can see declarer is all set to throw hearts on spades, so might as well attack hearts now?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C obviously something showing a good hand, maybe showing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on;y blocked if he wins this :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing king looks the odds play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
nt|athene: lead was @S9 showing bad suit|pg||
nt|athene: and if it was lauria who had the spades, he would have let versace win the first diamond to clear the suit surely|pg||
nt|athene: hello good morning|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: hi Martin|pg||
nt|athene: oh well|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Great,|pg||
nt|gsper:  Ducking this would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Now 10 tricks for NS.|pg||
nt|psyck: 9, has a trump to lose|pg||
nt|gsper:  Surely they must lose a trump too?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: with the idea that you will get your club tricks anyway?|pg||
nt|gsper:  You got ahead of me!|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@H promised five it looks ok|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: most irritating is to go down at the 5 level having mad a slam try   but will be ok here|pg||
nt|sharkey: still has to make it - like you stated David|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: of course it is always easier to work out how the cards lie when you can see how they lie :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is no joy  in Mudville....|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: in fact will have to play carefully       may go down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wonder if the @S4 had any significance|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he decided the only way to beat was partner having the @CA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for non baseball fans, that refers to a famous poem|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|athene: if trumps are clubs are 3-2, you don't need the @CK right, do you? just lose club, ruff clubs good|pg||
nt|athene: *if trumps AND clubs are 3-2|pg||
nt|athene: because you can cash clubs and get the heart through as well|pg||
nt|athene: partner having the @HK is not in itself enough; even if you cash some hearts, declarer can throw enough clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H would be interesting|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north was waiting higher contracts -with his 3 aces -but nothing he could do now|pg||
nt|gsper:  And likely a @C loser too|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: has to look after 4th diamond|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's true but still not much better than 50%|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but there are other chances too|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: yes, easier call if 1@h was 5, i play it as 4+|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C10 doesnt tell too much|pg||
nt|ady: if 3 rounds of trumps are drawn   no where for the 4th diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.federbridge.it/main.html|pg||
nt|runnerup:  even 3 @s has good chance -best played by north (so 1. round pass seem too wet -has to be repeated|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: if 2 rounds only drawn   and a diamond finesse   then north can play a heart to south for a club ruff|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|psyck: @c goes on @s, that was the reason for the duck|pg||
nt|gsper:  Not this way|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: It is noted for the record that Stevie did not screw up.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The bad moment came when Lew started contemplating his discard on the second trump.  Now sighing and shaking his head...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: meaning he tabled the dummy correctly :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is resembling the second quarter of the knicks game yesterday|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: with system on redouble forces 3@C to get out in either minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: To clarify, the defense did not play three rounds of spades.  After the first spade, Franco shifted to a club.|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfj: 1@S is not a misclick.  David slightly atilt.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Vugraphzfj: Providing the otherwise unattainable second hook.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Chip asks about the double: "T/o."|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5C|nt|Vugraphzfj: But Bobby did not read the position.  Still shaking his head.|pg||
mb|p|an| |mb|p|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: sheesh|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very undiscplined auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie calls the director.  There is some confusion over what Franco's second double showed.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Shi conferring again with Lew about 2@H, his eyebrows furrowed...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: dont blame him for trying 1@S in that situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|Vugraphzfj: "Good luck."  "Thank you."|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfj: Okay, so the director call: Sol Weinstein came in, but keboshed the call over a hesitation on Stevie's side of the screen.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The first sigh of the session from Shi...|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: In other words, playing behind screens, you cannot call the director over a hesitation that occurred on YOUR side, because presumably the other side is in the dark about who took ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: the time.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stevie then clarified that it was his turn to lead "before I do anything else illegal."|pg||
nt|bobh1: but it got his partner off to an unfortunate lead|pg||

nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to ruff a club and pick up trumps, losing just one spade, two diamonds and the @CA|pg||
nt|psyck: to prevent losing 2 trump tricks via @c ruff on a bad day...|pg||
nt|athene: well 3@S can be beaten with diamond ruff and then club shift i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't draw trumps and then get back to dummy fast to throw his club losers on the two good diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  making n/s   but an excellent save for e/w in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know the intricacies of the NS methods but i suspect 2nt showed extras|pg||
nt|athene: but if west led a spade, east could win the @CA and return a diamond and then throw two clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer could never get to dummy as east could overruff with the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, all irrelevant anyway|pg||
nt|athene: or just a club lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5 @c ok -here -4 @h makes ..so |pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: think 3@S max|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some 9 in @h ew if opened and will |pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: not sure e/w will be able to enter the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if north bid only 2@S and east doubled, that would find the club fit, but that is surely the only way|pg||
nt|athene: and i think north will bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  4 losers in spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: But NS likely will end up in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: the only way 4@S makes is if the defence don't attack diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to bid it - S will decline any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: but that's not happening|pg||
nt|athene: i think north just bids 3@S here and they play there|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree William|pg||
nt|ady: will east enter if north raises to 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@C also possibility - Splinter|pg||
nt|athene: i would probably double 2@S with the east cards|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@C NOT precision style, though it looks that way|pg||
nt|psyck: Right Bill, which is why I guess Markku said better chances played by N|pg||
nt|athene: double fit might come to light here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|athene: now a support double for spades i guess, so they find their 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sing @s makes it ofcause dangerous to open 4. hand|pg||
nt|athene: well sort of double fit :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  mainly that and west will lead @h Q --normally -@c lead only after peeping|pg||
nt|athene: many would just raise clubs with east, but sementa obviously feels that with opps bidding hearts, it is worth a lot for your side to find spades, rather than clubs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: south will have trouble showing hand now|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: N has a shortage of points but great playing strength when pd bid @S|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt was a spade raise you would think south would bid a discouraging 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will pay to stop low here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like a direct 3@D invite, although the bid has several flaws|pg||
nt|psyck: 2C = 10-13 value, 5C-4other unbalanced, or 6+C|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@D relay asking for 3-card major|pg||
nt|psyck: N's hand becomes powerful with Aces in pd's suit now|pg||
nt|athene: angelini can't bid less than game now, can he? ace in both partner's suits for a single raise|pg||
mb|3H|nt|runnerup:  3. hands pass -was a view =suprice also|pg||
mb|4C|nt|gsper:  2NT relay again|pg||
nt|athene: ok, apparently he can|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think support doubles are not as popular in italy as in america, but still if you double 1@H with 4+ spades here you surely need them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could have responded 2@d, perhaps, but that may be FG, and S isn't quite strong enough for that (non strong-club opener)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry but don't have a CC for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: still will easy enough for defence to collect their 4 winners  |pg||
nt|athene: ok, the fifth spade is nice, and QJ doubleton is much better when partner opens the suit, but even so...|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i'm told 2NT is 6-4|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tactical 3 @h to play in 4 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ah a spec suggests north is "she" - i was assuming a different angelini haha|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 now -but ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: everyone has shown his hand fairly, except N who should have bid stronger|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: so 3@H was just attempting to sign off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT is FG|pg||
nt|athene: even if 2@D response were not GF you might bid a spade anyway so as not to lose the suit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2000 |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h showed 3-4 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d showed 1345|pg||
pc|h5|nt|runnerup:  200 -500 with x|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks too aggressive|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so north was weaker than i would have been |pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: very complicated hand, but at least the lead reveals south has no natural lead|pg||

pc|d2|nt|bobholl: made now no problem|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless your playing flattery|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: but then north feels that facing any sort of heart fit it is worth a shot at game|pg||
nt|athene: run all the diamonds looks reasonable|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so if you pass 3. hand -why bid again ..ofcause souths 2 @s was aggressive also|pg||
nt|psyck: they have some defense, may not be all that clear to bid 5@c, though it is very likely they will bid it as insurance at this vul|pg||
mc|10|nt|runnerup:   at least you get + score there -2 aces -and|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what north was worried about - pushing opps into 5@C making - but that is not a big danger when you have two aces and partner opened|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west might go very quietly here, given the vulnerability here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT=20-21|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  if you are afread of oppenents to make 5 -level with those cards after partner opens and invites -youll never can bid any games |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: south had made a great lead, and should have known every card at the end|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S-1 on hand 4 cost 12 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|athene: perfect mesh here - singleton facing four small - let's see if they can identify it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to locate @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows some sort of good raise and *south* shows extras and a heart singleton, that will certainly do it|pg||
nt|athene: well, with a ten-card fit you don't usually count the queen of trumps as a problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT 12-14; not 5/4 majors or 4441|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D looking for a 5-3 spade fit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, CC not clear about 3@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3M would be a singleton or void|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead runs to the jack, and declarer will duck a club to north to protect the @SKx i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: if east is thinking this long he must have forgotten the system :)|pg||
nt|athene: wake up, fantoni!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, misread the CC. 1NT can include a 4441 shape.|pg||
nt|athene: EW's 1nt has to cover a lot of hands unsuitable for other bids, sort of like a precision 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: their 1-bids are 14+ points and their 2-bids are unbalanced so the weak notrump has to work hard for its living|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, lots of people; no idea about 3@d|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bobholl: always difficult to rerach a normal 4@S after weak NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a partial available both sides.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: only problem 6@S n/s  is the 3-0 trump split    needs to guess which way to play trumps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Any bidding by EW cud assist declarer in locating the Q|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S=at least 5/4 both minors |pg||
nt|gsper:  That is a heavy overcall by their standards|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: ah ok, 3@C puppet stayman then?|pg||

nt|sharkey: x 3@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: they seem to have no problem|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: this is where west showing a 2 suiter might give the distribution away     vulnerability was against west entering|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: maybe just natural and strong, and then everything natural-ish, with 3@S showing stopper and concern about hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny, on the copy of the EW CC I have 1NT-3minor is not described at all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so presumably they are natural bids|pg||
nt|runnerup:  brakes found -in time wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: even when the opponents are silent you can sometimes use that to help find the Qxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: by asking "which defender would be more likely to bid if he DID have a spade void?"|pg||
nt|psyck: no idea what the bids mean, but they reach the normal contract|pg||
nt|psyck: i assume transfer adv & 1@s leass than 3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: i wonder if east had super-accepted, whether south would have bid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: he might well have done, as the super-accept would mark his partner with a singleton heart, so that is pretty good news |pg||
nt|mdgraham: expensive @sk|pg||
nt|queequeg: Closed Room: http://td.bboitalia.it/16.jpg / Open Room: http://td.bboitalia.it/17.jpg|pg||
nt|gsper:  Declarer may easily go worong|pg||
nt|psyck: looks likely to make by ruffing a @d & playing for @d43 & @c 32|pg||
nt|gsper:  The Slawinski leads are not complex in themselves, but the follow-up may be|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: but at this vulnerability, that line of thought does not really help so much, because even with a lot of shape, the opponents are not going to be bidding|pg||
nt|ady: in my opinion that would not be a reasonable question to ask |pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny how often 4441 hands never quite live up to their potential (in terms of hcp) |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am very surprised east did not take another bid|pg||
nt|athene: it does look as though doubling 3@H helped NS though|pg||
nt|athene: gave madala more room to make a try|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult decision for madala|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would play on @D 33|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in positions similar to this, you might want to make the exotic play of ducking the first trick|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is you can draw trumps and keep control of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think that applied here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: he has virtually no defense to 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although looking at 3@d and 3@S you would guess puppet stayman |pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 3@c asks for 5M or 5422 shape|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart return he will test clubs and then maybe run the @DJ into north for a second avoidance play|pg||
nt|athene: still guarding those spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 3@d denies 5m4M|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they should put that on their CC for us poor old commentators :) |pg||
nt|athene: if the defence now play ace and a spade, of course declarer can afford to run the @DJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|sharkey: A @C lead will leave the lead in dummy  and -1; otherwise lead will go to hand and make - I predict|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: probably expected QJ10 in S, with the 9 in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i'm a bit surprised at versace showing the minors actually|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a 3nt raise to me|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: you mean declarer's natural play is to lead a small trump from whichever hand he finds himself in at trick 2?|pg||
nt|ady: swing could go either way|pg||
nt|athene: i think it is just about 50-50 to be honest|pg||
nt|athene: of course madala is not expecting the @CK to be onside|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's surely below 50%|pg||
nt|athene: he's wondering whether to overtake this, ruff the last heart, then play a small club |pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: oh well, at least he will be happy when he finds the bad break now - it means there is a chance 5@S can gain imps|pg||
nt|gsper:  The low @H showed even number without honor or odd with|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lets say well bid -no real idea if they were aware about possible @c slam -not this time ofcause |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: the defence would then have time to set up a diamond trick but that might be ok|pg||
pc|c8|nt|runnerup:  i think you always make this but easyer now ofcause|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sharkey: So much for preditions...|pg||
nt|ady: was that 480    or 450|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d3|nt|athene: the lead gives declarer an easy ninth trick from diamonds but she would have been ok on a club lead anyway i guess - play spades|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: I have been given a link: http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, so NS play strong @c system, sry I came late did not realise|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: NS Leads are Slavinsky (standard count with an honour in the suit & reverse count without an honour).|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: and lo, it says 3C = asks 5-crd major or 5422, not used if just looking for 4-4 fit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: interesting sort of squeeze here|pg||
nt|athene: if north throws a diamond declarer can't go wrong really|pg||
nt|athene: but if he throws a heart, south has to throw a spade, and then it becomes safe to take the diamond finesse anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm sorry that is not quite correct, as east will presumably throw a heart anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so then south can throw a heart and it is not quite safe to finesse diamonds through north|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that's what my copy of the CC says. Might be out-of-date of course|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: hard for east to know it was diamonds, not clubs, he should have been attacking|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: made +1 if switched to @D ??|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: but then as a spec points out you can cash two hearts|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|athene: yes i was wondering if they had changed their methods and 3@S forced 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: seems unlikely tho|pg||

nt|runnerup:  a good day and 4 @h ok ns -not to day|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@D surely majors|pg||
nt|psyck: just table presence :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: i would have thought 1nt was the obvious rebid there|pg||
nt|athene: getting your overall hand across|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 4@D will only encourage camberos|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@C is ok, as long as partner doesn't think you have to have diamonds for it|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@H     but n/s may play 4@S   for -500|pg||
nt|gsper:  Par seems to be 6@DX|pg||
nt|psyck: only 2 red aces to lose in a @h contract|pg||
nt|psyck: since on @c lead, you can discard on @s & W cannot ruff profitably|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@H wins on @C lead aswell.|pg||
nt|gsper:  N probably has more defense than partner expects|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: EW might have 4@D, at this rate|pg||
nt|athene: obviously east thinks 4@D is forcing, though, which suggests he thinks it is a "new suit" i.e. 2@C does not guarantee any diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: but how to show it now (gazilli ?)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards lie remarkably badly |pg||
nt|athene: ok, i guess he did finesse, but of course makes anyway after no spade shift|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @h with 7 isn't everyones choice|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H opener gives east a much harder task|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: i assume the pause there was west thinking, not south|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C natural or various strong hands; 2@S less than 8 points|pg||
nt|athene: you might just bid 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|psyck: non vul, @h sequence, some shape & values on the side, a clear 3@h bid|pg||
nt|athene: no problem in 6@S of course with the miracle diamond lie so the 7 is good|pg||
nt|runnerup:  also in 5 . board 5 @c X -100 like expected -over 4 @h  =6 imps|pg||
nt|athene: but even if south had a higher diamond he would get squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|athene: unless it was diamond lead and diamond continuation after the trump, i suppose|pg||
nt|runnerup:  12 in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: making a slam is the best way to beer|pg||
nt|athene: yes, making a slam with the @D7 having squeezed someone is definitely a good beer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW misunderstanding here is a variation on a common theme:- when do you count a short minor opening as a "bid suit" and when not?|pg||
nt|sharkey: In the other room W opened a weak NT and East bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: if diamonds have been bid already, then 4@D is not forcing|pg||
nt|ady: good swing for Zaleski here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone for 3@D with four-card trump support?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if north opens 3 @h -what is east bid?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sharkey: I wonder what type hand West would bid 1 NT second time - may be conventional?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: running scores at http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@h=maximum without majors or 4@h|pg||
mb|5S|nt|fabsayc: in this auction where a suit agreed and we are past 4nt, i play 5NT is key card (probably i am alone :()|pg||
nt|fabsayc: alternatively 5NT should say he is interested in 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I guess with three jacks it's a bit aggressive :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: well as i said it is difficult - you might just bid 3nt |pg||
nt|psyck: same i suppose dbl planning 3N on 3M|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but if partner bid lets say 4 @c ?|pg||
nt|athene: you might double but that will often just give you a hard problem later on|pg||

pc|s4|nt|sharkey: Can duck this|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: yes, duck this looks simplest, then just draw trumps|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need to guess the hearts or anything|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: 4@Sx by north in open room|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|athene: if you draw trumps you don't have a dummy entry, but when you lead the @H10, east has a tricky decision |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: you might have started with @HA10 doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: now the double squeeze is pretty much marked|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: cash @CK, ruff a heart, and then run the trumps|pg||
nt|athene: and whoever has the diamonds will have to unguard them|pg||
nt|athene: not actually a double squeeze as only one person can guard them but that is how you play it|pg||
nt|psyck: well we don't get dealt such 24 everyday, so i don't like to just bid 3N, I will x & take my medicine on pd's rebid|pg||

nt|ady: e/w should make 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry only 6-5 here of course|pg||
nt|athene: north was stuck; if he ducked at trick 1, hoping for a heart shift, declarer could win the ace immediately|pg||

nt|gsper:  And 2@S is not Muiderberg or something, but a constructive part of the system|pg||
nt|athene: well 6@C looks best here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @c +1  is easy ofcause |pg||
nt|athene: you can even make 7@C i suppose on the layout|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bobholl: but vulnarable it is understandable the other one was nV|pg||
nt|runnerup:  110 available both ways -this -100 with best def|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H pass/correct invitational, by the look of it |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|athene: only @DA as an obvious loser, as you can throw a diamond on the @SK|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: but if you draw trumps you only have 11 tricks with crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: i think north ought to be raising clubs if her partner can bid them twice|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, opposite vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt scramble now, perhaps|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW were thoroughly preempted out|pg||
nt|psyck: made it difficult for EW to enter at this vul|pg||
mb|3N|nt|runnerup:  not a good start for defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: maybe a diamond lead would give problems|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead would certainly cause problems, but the club looks normal to me|pg||
nt|athene: even after a club lead, the defence might have a chance - suppose declarer wins the jack and returns a club; north can win and shift to a diamond now|pg||
nt|ady: even a club lead  may nopt make    diamond switch later may be ok for defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: NS play a strong club system, i am guessing over 1@S a bid of 2@C is their only game force|pg||
nt|athene: after a club lead declarer can go for hearts immediately of course, but that looks risky with just a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: well when you only go for 500 with that dummy, i don't think you can be accused of rash bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: but it still costs an imp |pg||
nt|athene: maybe west comes under pressure, having to guard both majors, and you can ruff the @HK or @S10 good|pg||
nt|gsper:  A D by E risked 4 or 5@C from partner|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D was obviously something weird - maybe showed just a minimum hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: this lead stops 6|pg||
nt|runnerup:  under 6 @c you can stay with good justment|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cant|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: if declarer plays hearts early   should make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know if NS's agreement is that 2nt here is lebensohl or a scramble|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that north does not unblock - you would think he would, as then either defender can win the third heart if need be|pg||
nt|athene: but even if you play it as scramble you can use it, like this, to show a weak 3@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: (direct 3@H bid is stronger)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|athene: one possibility is to run the spades first - that often makes life hard for the defenders|pg||
nt|sharkey: He has to play on @H I think|pg||
nt|athene: i think versace might get trump squeezed|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: the trouble is, it might make things hard for you too - you have to find a couple of discards, and you also lose your dummy entries|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: if this holds the trick, what does declarer do next?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume play @C to the A and @C up.  @D A has to be in front|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is fairly sure now that north has the @HA, which makes it safer to play another heart, as north is probably not going to be the one with long hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no way the defence can set themselves up some long hearts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Pity on the nice defense to miss the second ruff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: north obviously worried about the weak opening|pg||

nt|ady: North seems to have trapped himself not entering the bidding first round|pg||

mb|2C|nt|gsper:  S could not open 2@S with both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  sing @s -looks dangerous but ,,|pg||
nt|gsper:  and the hand was rather weak for 1@S, which is sound|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: But here humans are playing....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c FG|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if the double shows 4+ spades, then north might want to raise just because of the big fit, but he doesn't want to suggest he has anything|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: some play transfer to hearts then bid 3nt shows 5 hearts and 4 spades, not forcing|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3-3 now perhaps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the danger here could be the range of the 1NT rebid - no, 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: @h SPLINTER NOW ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: aggressive from north; if partner has only 3 spades, game will never be there, and even when he has 4, it needs a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: on last board alfonsin bid 3NT over 2@S|pg||

nt|athene: was it possible south could have three diamonds though?|pg||
nt|athene: could he be 4-3-3-3 on that bidding?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand looks very interesting, two slams beaten by bad breaks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: hopefully that's spades and a minor. If it's just spades.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@s would be a weak two in spades |pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: i dont believe this bidding|pg||
nt|athene: we need two initial passes here i guess :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what? Have they reversed the board?|pg||
nt|athene: possible|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://td.bboitalia.it/6.jpg rieccoli|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|athene: maybe a better plan was to cash the @DA at trick 2, then return the heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice to see that even Fantunes can err occasionally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner started with @DKx he can cash the @DK before giving you the heart ruff, and you can give him a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no need to underlead your @DA trying to pick up @DQxx with declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt =dd and down in practive if no helping bids in defence (like here) perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so we see lauria's opinion of the tricky bidding problem for balanced 24 count after 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: might very well get the clubs right - we shall see|pg||
nt|athene: he doubled and basically forced to 6@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lucky 6 @s for bear card bid and made quite lucky|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West might have passed - six spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might deem it unsuitable for a weak two |pg||
nt|gsper:  E has a lot of cards but does not know where to go|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gsper:  And knows even less now|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would bid 3NT now and go down|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i am told, on the NS methods, if south WAS 4333, he would be 18-20, so that was out|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i never see in table any one to finess @c -not expected here |pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Opposite an overcall, Hedy?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 6 either major makes with spades friendly.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobholl: very good slam|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: kickard, love it|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose 6@H is a bit better than 6@S because you might make it even with a bad spade break, but it's hard to get out of a 4-4 fit once you lock into it|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, diamonds might produce an extra trick.|pg||
nt|athene: so the underlead looks like a definite slip|pg||
nt|psyck: well, i did guess E would bid @s, just misguessed the number|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|bobholl: no @S Q so 6 only|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|kareno: 5@h may show two without trump queen.|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should have taken control with blackwood over 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: normally you don't want the limited hand as captain|pg||
nt|athene: east just wants to know if her partner has @SAQ, @HA, @DA - then 7 is good|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kareno: There's no safety play in the spade suit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@c - so old hat these days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that could be a very expensive @d7 discard|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: west can never know if 7 is good because he does not know his partner has six solid hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @S2 to K and club finesse?|pg||

nt|athene: now north may know his opponents have had a misunderstanding but he still has to judge whether to double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h=10-13, 5+@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: weird|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok --nonsence|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, E's hand could play very well opp fitting hands|pg||
nt|gsper:  3@C may be singleton ask|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: i think double is right|pg||
nt|gsper:  What on Earth is going on here?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: if they wake up and bid a cold 4@S you just hope that your teammate are in it anyway|pg||
nt|athene: now south might discover a diamond suit tucked away there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cc says 2@s=realy, but maybe that doesn't apply by a passed hand  |pg||
nt|athene: if partner asks you for non-spade suits and you have seven in one of them, you might want to bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s presumably some sort of fit-jump|pg||
nt|psyck: are we looking at the same boards :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  It is suggested that thay are playing board 29|pg||
nt|hedyg:  UNDO ?|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe the bidding is for board 29|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: south is thinking how bad a dummy for diamonds his partner might put down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h-3@h might have bought it|pg||
nt|athene: i guess something like 2-4-3-4 shape is possible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: something maybe not quite right here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is not gonna make :) .heh heh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think W playing 3@d on a 3-2 fit|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: double 3@C looks normal with west but this will work out fine anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that might provoke 5@d|pg||
nt|athene: might be a problem now if north passes after a looong think, and south finds 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
nt|gsper:  But even then 3@D is not obvious|pg||
nt|psyck: if so 3@d @c single (with 3@h @d single & 3@s @s single)?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Quite possibly|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: even if North is known to have slow-passed, 5@d isn't unreasonable with 7411 shape|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|queequeg: W is playing 4@H in the OR|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but N has gone on anyway, so no problem|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: the down side of fit jumps is it also helps opponents to evaluate their fit|pg||
nt|psyck: if E found @c single , he did not want to try much beyond game...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: west might duck a heart lead|pg||
nt|gsper:  We don't know how srong 2NT could have been|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psyck: yes, but if close to limit raise values, E can envisage a slam with right cards|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: it would be interesting to know why East didn't simply raise hearts - but it might be a bit difficult to find out |pg||

nt|fabsayc: 1. partner never has the right cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2. never bid a grand slam|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi might be contemplating 4nt here? heart lead, seven (!) diamonds, and lead a spade up for the tenth, just hoping the defence can't cash too many clubs|pg||

mb|2D|nt|vugraphzdu: mucha concentraciòn en la mesa de juego.|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  i say nothing about that 14 (anymore)this is partscore only so defence gets +|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: that applies to the defense also, 6@D was going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: lets say could go down|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though the defence should have one trick in each suit here with no problems, but north is in danger of getting endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: so the spade shift was actually necessary|pg||
nt|psyck: going via an artificial 2@c bid to make an invitational raise|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: I agree with Andy, Ghestem sounds sexier|pg||
