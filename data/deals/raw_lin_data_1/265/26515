nt|vugraphzbq: N was told W had @s and a minor. N says he wouldnt have doubled 2@d if he had been given the correct explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: TD is writing it all down|pg||
nt|panosk: so North's 1st double was penalty for 1 of minors?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbq: TD is confiscating the notes players had written to one another explaining their side's bids|pg||

nt|gsper:  Passing the X would have been the winner, but not very realistic|pg||
nt|Clinch: It's a normal 4 card major opening for me|pg||
pc|s2|nt|santyclz2:  Might be tempted to pass the negative x with the w hand since it isn't game even if it makes, but think that's losing strategy in the long run.|pg||
