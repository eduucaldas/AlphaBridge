mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|mug: 2NT Jacoby, spade fit and game force|pg||
nt|mug: can the England boys discover the lack of heart control?|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|Walddk2: Lousy hand Myers has, 8 losers|pg||
nt|ybob: pasaje nada +|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: 3@C I'm guessing but probably minimum, and 3@D asking for shortage|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Guess again, Tom :)|pg||
nt|mug: 4@D guessing again but no shortage and reasonable hand with diamond control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8 losers a reasonable hand?|pg||
nt|mug: 14 Miltons Roland|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|Walddk2: 4NT is useless with  xx  in hearts|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  If 3@C was a minimum hand then North has a maximum minimum|pg||
nt|mug: something gone wrong now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: ok Thrower just checked for keys and punted it|pg||
nt|mug: so it will come down to the opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: 3D shortage ask 4D cue|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So why did Thrower not bid 4@S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that too scientiic?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: insert an f somewhere|pg||
nt|mug: you'll have to ask him Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: 4D Cue no shortage|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  The impetuousity of youth Roland|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mug: North had denied a club control so a club lead was not entirely illogical|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|Paulhac:  1NT or Pass?|pg||
nt|mug: pass for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: @CAK don't look like good values for notrump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pass followed by 1NT if partner doubles|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Paulhac:  South certainly has his bidding boots on|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|mug: pushy double but should end well|pg||
nt|mug: Thrower can shift to his spade (which he should have led)|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mug: you're right it's still not over|pg||
nt|mug: the danger is all the hearts will go away|pg||
nt|mug: but the second spade will cut the dummy off|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  But if South gets the spade ruff there is no quick entry in the West hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mug: right so the heart shouldn't go away|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|danilo1: ah yes ... 3@C (I am talking about -2)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1Â½ matches tonight|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Paulhac:  Difficult for North not to double Tom when South made a second bid vul|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: 2@H is scary but they can actually make 4|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: not convinced 2@D promised three defence tricks Paul although the spade ruff was on the cards|pg||
nt|mug: 2@H presumably implying clubs too|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  Are they not 1 trick short Roland?|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  I am not sure they have time to set up the 5th diamond|pg||

nt|mug: no doubt if North had realized declarer would have clubs and hearts he'd have led something else |pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: And now an opportunity to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  great result for the French|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easier to play than to bid perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: East won't like 2@H|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: very hard to bid, who can blame East for shutting up shop over 2@H?|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  Many would respond 3@H over 1NT on the East hand to show shortage|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: That would show 1354 or 1345 or most I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3154  45  rather|pg||
nt|mug: @CJ is pretty important in a diamond slam, hard to show that|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Can you have four spades if you bid 3@H, Paul?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||

nt|Paulhac:  Yes I play it to show 4-4-4-1 or 3-1-5-4 or 4-0-4-5|pg||

nt|Walddk2: *even|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|Paulhac:  Although the French have taken a lead board 9 looks good for the English so the match appears to be about level at this stage|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C probably checkback|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: East will try diamonds first. When North shows out on the second round, he will need four club tricks and @SK onside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and find it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe West bid 3@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|mug: yes whichever way to start diamonds you have time to revert to clubs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Oh well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Myers doubled for a spade lead and made them run from the making 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funny game|pg||
nt|mug: North's double suggested a spade lead so I don't think East's removal was best judged |pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Agreed|pg||
nt|mug: but at the end of the day isn't 5@D likely to make?|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  This could well make|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|mug: West's rescue was much sounder than his partner's|pg||

pc|dT|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|mug: this isn't the best line but he can still make by ruffing a heart and throwing the long heart on the fourth club|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|dK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  maybe that is not the best line|pg||

nt|mug: it's unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, and he may even be able to eliminate the minors before touching hearts|pg||
