pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as you've all guessed  2@H = @H & a minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'll wager bidding was slow but play was fast|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think it shows 5M and 4+M|pg||
nt|andyv:  minor|pg||

nt|ahollan1: favorable =  not vul vs vul    [i.e. favorable side that wants to disrupt]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sometimes europeans will call that green   [but other times green just means any non-vul]|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and 2@D = min  [again, length purely coincidental]|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes...and confirmed by an excellent player|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: rechecking notes i've made   2@D=min and NOT 4+@H|pg||

nt|andyv:  vugraph operator having fun with us|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final round coming up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final session [22 boards] of Pairs scheduled to begin in about 2 hours 15 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?owneronly=0&commentatoronly=0&order_by=event  shows schedule with viewers local time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for non-commentators    http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow 2 of 3 sessions of the Individual|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the convention card used by ALL players available online  http://ecatsbridge.com/Documents/files/ConventionCardEditors/WorldStandardCards/GeneraliCard+notes.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lots of useful info under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Beijing.12/Information.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: including prize money scheme  -- spoiler alert   don't look if you're hoping to see women getting pay equity|pg||
nt|andyv:  shucks|pg||
nt|andyv:  where's Diane Feinstein when you really need her?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually   i know where she lives|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have friends who used to be neighbors|pg||
nt|andyv:  you have friends?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: inherited by marriage of friends who can't afford to live in that lavish neighborhood|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that uses up all of the friendships|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just waiting for the round to be called|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all 12 tables [6-open  6-women] play the same boards at the same time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i'm sure play doesn't begin until all tables ready|pg||
nt|ahollan1: movie only goes to board 20  --  so problem could be operators don't have 21 & 22 loaded for us|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so it goes :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  all the other sites also have 20 as the final board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if they load same way as ACBL events -- then same file downloaded to all of the laptops|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, Al, I'll say good night to you here and see you soon.  Thank you specs...another round to start in about 2 hours I believe.|pg||
