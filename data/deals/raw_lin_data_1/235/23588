mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|leo lasota: Key question from North's perspective should be, do you have the queen of diamonds partner?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: all this shows is that south holds king clubs; if North had jumped to 6D asking about 3rd round control, South would sign off in 6S, marking them with 3 or 4 small|pg||
nt|leo lasota: normally, 6 of a red suit here would be asking about that king; North has both kings however|pg||
nt|leo lasota: some chance that north will just blast 7 here and hope partner has queen diamonds, or 4 small and diamond suit comes in|pg||
