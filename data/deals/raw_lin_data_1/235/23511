mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: initial pass by N probably normal but i know i couldnt manage it at the table|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  might get to 3NT    |pg||

pc|c3|nt|ady: with club finesse and heart finesse on   should be 9 tricks |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think he will bother with heart finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he might go after Ds though|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: yes true    4 heart tricks  wont need heart finesse  |pg||
nt|ady: club finesse rather|pg||
pc|c8|nt|panosk: tempting to finess @H to throw losing @C|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another slam @s or @d?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|panosk: W pass?|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: better X or 1NT ?|pg||
nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ybob: i like X with 4/4 M´s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|murat e: 3 hearts surely bid by west as a transfer bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S+2@H+3@D+2@C=9 and @S hook can provide the 10th trick.|pg||
nt|murat e: or a single and choose contract bid we dont know|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: i would double too but 3 nt won't make i guess|pg||
nt|ybob: with doubleton @D better|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C the best spot to E-W|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ugly - slam decent but the red suits do them in|pg||
nt|mamos:  wow  game is certainly close|pg||
nt|panosk: a more observant fellow spec suggested that if S plays low spade in 2nd trick E will not make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|murat e: if south did not open 3 nt from west is good on a heart lead but that is gone|pg||
pc|d5|nt|murat e: sory it was as it is here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|panosk: 9@H shud be in dummy :) |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ybob: now @D lead defeat it|pg||
nt|ybob: not hard i think ...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: there is 3 definatge losers in spade and spade ruff   and a trump trick  and will have to cope with the bad diamond split|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oliverc: Burns Law violation in progress :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|panosk: today's schedule has only 1 and a half match in line, so just 48 boards to be played|pg||
nt|panosk: piece of cake compared to 80 boards played yesterday|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: now club switch    but may still make on an end play|pg||
pc|c3|nt|murat e: 2 dia maybe showed both majors|pg||
nt|rnmalik: To think of yes plausible.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panosk: even that wudnt be enough |pg||
nt|mamos:  i think looking at the nS hands youd want to b e in 4@s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @h lead isn´t my lead as W. @cQ or @cJ depending on leads. Why? the shorter suit has more odds for the defence|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|murat e: this hand shows how important to open the bidding when the suit is good without jack of clubs it is 11 hcp must still open at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: now should be down|pg||

nt|panosk: nice hands |pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: similar trump suit|pg||
nt|ady: was a case for playing ace of spades first round    but as it went needed to play K@C   first round  draw trump and exit with a club    either defender is end played|pg||
nt|ady: part score in sspades for e/w|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 1st segment was very exciting, this will be too|pg||
nt|murat e: yes but previous board maybe bidding was different at the table....|pg||
nt|panosk: i think W have doubled 2@H |pg||
nt|ybob: thx all :)|pg||
nt|panosk: open to suggestions for East's bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: hi & wlc.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Apart from that I understand that bidding is fairly standard on both sides|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT on 19 is expert practice, usually described as upgrading to 20|pg||
nt|murat e: here north has too much property on spades which does not suit south if he was thinking about a dia slam|pg||
nt|murat e: ty bye|pg||
nt|ybob: bye|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: if partner bidding volunterely at five level vulnerable how did west pass|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobholl: poor north difficult choice|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes i do agree  you cannot expect to make many @h tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The best use of the green card.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|gsper:  Sensible. Few pairs have good methods for minor slams after 2NT opening.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have a fortunate 4 hearts    but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 spades|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mamos:  this is solid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobholl: guess 2NT is lebensohl and than he guessed well|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades down if clubs attacked early before diamond set up|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: add the 9 of hearts to E/W  then 4 spades around 75 percent|pg||
pc|d3|nt|murat e: normally after 2 nt 3 sp is transfer to 3 nt after which responder bids his minor to show slam interest|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bobholl: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|oliverc: Anyone else for "Pass" with the West hand?|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S make but impossible to find, i'd personally venture a 3@C bid in case pard has 6-4 with cubs second suit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|ady: north has taken the push     hard to judge    should be down 1|pg||
nt|ady: especially on diamond lead|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|panosk: not me Oliver sorry , not of that disposition in life :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|oliverc: Must be the Aegean sun :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: defending 4 spades  may not be clear  how to defend after cashing A@H unless south casn give a suit preference signal|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sverjohn: Looks like 9 tricks could be the limit here. Actually not unreasonable to get to game|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gsper:  Is that standard in Norway, KÃ¥re?|pg||
nt|murat e: but south instead of taking an adventure made a sensible bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can make 6 on any lead, same play. Am I right?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Seems so to me too.|pg||
nt|andersk: hi|pg||
nt|ady: also a good chance of 10 tricks if the K@C was woth north    may be able to play a club towards the queen  and create a discard of a heart later|pg||

nt|panosk: its all over the world nowadays, spreading like a contagion|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h5|pc|d2|nt|STRIK3R: the 2@s opening was 5/6 - 10/11 in this vul, promising 5@s and normaly a 4+ minor suit, but could be only 3 card minor on the side|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobholl: guess a1D small @D|pg||
nt|ady: east thinking spade trick likely to make   not knowing opening a 7 card suit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ralfwil: after the @d switch, no warning bells?|pg||

pc|c7|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||

nt|panosk: i played in a club last night and boards seemed so boring, how do they manage to make these here so much more interesting?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: thx O R|pg||
nt|andersk: 4 @C was alerted as short, but I beleve it was asking partner to transfeer to he's major|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@c for E?|pg||
nt|panosk: defence was excellent in last |pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: this time 8-5 for a change|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if he intend to open in first hand that is|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: slam time    6 spades for n/s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes 4@c looks fair|pg||
nt|mamos:  specsakke agrees :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gsper:  Preempting with a 5-card major on the side is very unclassical, but what do you do?|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the 1972 Olympics, a Canadian opened 4@H with 6-6 in the majors. The opps...|pg||
nt|gsper:  bid 4@S, he doubled and it made|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@c one long suit|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to 3NT    but may have a difficult ride|pg||
nt|mamos:  its poss that 4@c is Texas|pg||
nt|panosk: trumps break well for decl |pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: opted for part score|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Caution may pay off here. Guess Frank did not like his club holding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andersk: looks like 9 tricks for NS in @H and 8 EW in sp|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@C= i have long unspecified suit, 2@D say which|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: need to ruff 2 hearts to make |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bobholl: and on @C lead no entries to do that|pg||
nt|ady: or possibly ruff 1 heart and set up long club|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andersk: Peronally I overcall 1 @S with Nybo's hand|pg||
nt|ady: low spase now best|pg||
nt|andersk: what line?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gsper:  In general, if you have 5 trumps it is a good idea to lead one. I am not sure how it would have worked here.|pg||
nt|murat e: i think heart lead and dia shift needed to beat this contract|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree |pg||
nt|murat e: helgamos hand is rubbish and he has a passed parnner but hands fit very well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: W must be feeling low on missing 4@S by that preempt and the defence cashed their tricks to the max.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|andersk: after 3. hand openings and not vouln, m|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
pc|h3|nt|STRIK3R: West was in perfect spot for using "snapdragon", but they dont have that in their cc, dbl(snapdragon) would have showed 5@s and minimum Tx in @d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: club lead is awkard    east has 3 spades to the 10 and doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: North thinking...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards - easy.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|panosk: in board 2 4@S were made hence 12 imps to Drammen|pg||
nt|andersk: needed to switch @D to couse any problems|pg||
nt|panosk: not an easy contract|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|panosk: its a hopeless contract |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|ady: even on this lead  awkward to make 12 tricks on the lay|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|andersk: Probably down on @D switch|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wygbe1: i wonder why n didnt act sooner|pg||
nt|mamos:  no reason to choose anything other than this straightforward line is there?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|andersk: Press live update in left meny|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks for e/w in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s save in 4@S  down 4 on best defence|pg||
nt|ady: a good swing here for North if resisting any save|pg||
nt|ady: surely wont  save with ace and king of clubs to defend|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H here my guess|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|gsper:  Presumably N can correct 3@C to 3@D without showing extras|pg||
nt|andersk: or this link : v|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andersk: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
nt|panosk: players are also humans so they make a wrong decision from time to, its the duration that counts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: leades gained 10 on hand 19 where club end play was found   though defence made it a little easier by cashing ace of clubs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: 4 hearts should play for 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: dia finesse not working so both 3 nt and 5 dia are destined to fail|pg||
nt|ady: no lead gives this any chance|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT also a make|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 12 tricks from the top with no finesses :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Flott/Nybo is not bidding much :)|pg||

pc|h6|nt|andersk: Bakke thinking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 2@c is rather clear - isn´t it?|pg||
nt|andersk: If he pass, Helgomo knowes he's partner have a hand|pg||
nt|panosk: another hard 1 for decl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: your guess correct :)|pg||
nt|panosk: i think its very reasonable bidding |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|panosk: im ok with pass in 2nd no 4-4 majors|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gsper:  I wonder if 2NT was natural (unusual these days) or minors or something|pg||
nt|panosk: the rest two suits more likely|pg||
nt|murat e: red against white east did not fancy a negative double here|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hi David I will join you for the rest of this set|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Ronny    welcome|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 8 tricks for S - at least....|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: that was a surprise....|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panosk: @C from dummy and if no @D return he will make|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|ady: in a hopless 6 diamonds here|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Dag did his work bidding 3@s on this one, making it hard for East/West to make a controlled auction|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|panosk: E doing his bit with highest @C available|pg||
nt|panosk: not a clear sign though|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what switch @S or @D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: high @c = spade ?|pg||
nt|panosk: most likely |pg||
nt|panosk: depends on their agreements|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: should be the first swing this set for Tromse|pg||
pc|s2|nt|STRIK3R: Sitting in east seat, x of 1@h would normaly promise @d as well as @s, holding T72 in @d you dont want your partner to start bidding @d's, beside you know North has some @s's. ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Think pass of 2@c is ok in Teams|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|panosk: in board 18 as was accurately suggested by operator Astrid earlier EW cud make 3NT which they did |pg||
nt|panosk: in open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo should have played the 2@C.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|STRIK3R: but as the hands are, N/S would have stopped bidding on either bid from west|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andersk: EW might block the @H's and W might be endplayed for 9|pg||

nt|panosk: it wasnt easy from the start|pg||
mb|1N|nt|murat e: declarers usually have a void or single at this type of auction so the lead was not absurd|pg||

nt|ady: another slam    this time 6@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes, even on a @s lead, since the @c breaks 3-2 and you have the @d's|pg||

nt|bobholl: fairly good suit :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: south might be tempted to go for a game in NT|pg||
nt|ady: I thin slightly better choice last hand Ronny    could have played 3 round sof hearts after drawing trumps  just in case east was 3 - 4 -2-4  in which case would be later squeezed|pg||

mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: I was thinking more after the first round of @c, since west showed up with a small one, you couldent really defend against J97x in east hand, but as you say, you would having that ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: squeeze going|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3@s preemtive I guess|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4 hearts    but 4 spades a good save for n/s|pg||
nt|mamos:  may well be 3NT again|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: 3@c asking for strengt and suit quality|pg||
nt|bobholl: playing multi we would bid 2@D 2nt and than 3 nt show akq 6th :) in any coulour|pg||

nt|ralfwil: with open cards, now @dJ and if it holds, a @c to @cQ and a @s finess....|pg||

pc|s8|nt|STRIK3R: ups, bad guess :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 10@D to avoid blocking @D|pg||

nt|vugraphzhc: I like his 3rd hand oopening 1@C - |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: He wants pd to lead @C and not @D if opps get to play the contract.|pg||
nt|panosk: if its not strong @C i cant see the benefit in general, apart from this board|pg||
nt|panosk: with an 18 holding you hope to play, not to defend|pg||
nt|panosk: 41 imps exchanging hands in 1st six boards, translating to an imp gain for Kristiansands|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: because he know that east has 0-2 @s's, so the @s suit is most likely blocked|pg||

mb|2H|nt|andersk: Helgemo I hopeing for a D from partner|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: NT N/S would be a interesting play|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 4@s down one could very well be a flat board|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D can make e/w    but ambitious|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bobholl: yes guess it was check back passed :)|pg||
nt|ady: may well play 4 spades|pg||
nt|sverjohn: This might bring some life into west|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: I dont like the 2@s opening|pg||
nt|baldjean: will land in 3@h|pg||
nt|panosk: he may pass being vul|pg||
nt|panosk: everything still in order :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|murat e: wrong...|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@D not bad EW, however it cant make|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if you play weak 2 as their cc states, that is not a 2@s opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Christer is thinking, %&&/%¤&(=(&/)/&/) :)|pg||
nt|murat e: spade discard|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: pass in south now show 0-2@s's|pg||
nt|ady: firstr quiet hand|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: shall we predict just making? 2@c that is|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ady: though last hand could have been defeated  south might have considered saving in 6@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: an another 13 imp to Tromsø, 1 IMP now|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Would have opened 1 spade. But this could have worked out well|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 4@C by S is new suit or cue bid in spades?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: not checback, xyNT 2@c forces 2@d|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But a weak 2 opener should never bid again, so this could have waked up Holm|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: that was expected Ronny    6@D  - 1  with ace and king of clubs to loose|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|murat e: south accepts game-try and bids 3 nt with 4-3-3-3 flat distribution|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT is usually some kind of relay nowadays|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so we guess east forgot system, or was not sure if the system was on after an intial pass in opening from west(ref board 4 in open room)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 6-5 is obvious|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gsper:  But you are right that natural fits this bidding|pg||
nt|murat e: north thinks 4 hearts is better in fact both contracts make|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would not like to pass, to be honest. the @s of partner can't be too good|pg||
nt|panosk: what does 5@S mean? |pg||
nt|panosk: cant be asking for spade honors to go to slam|pg||

nt|bobholl: and may bee a @H :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: indeed, even that|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kemperg: not a 50% slam, @SQ and @CK had to behave|pg||
nt|panosk: i also think that has something to do with quality of spade suit, only that i use it to ask pard to go to slam if he has 2 out of 3 top honors in spades|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|STRIK3R: no, south showed 12 points already, woulden open 1@c with 15|pg||

pc|d5|nt|murat e: otherwise declarer woujd go between one of the black suit finesses|pg||
nt|panosk: compared to last 1 this 3nt will look a walk in the park for Helgemo|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessed rigth|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok so East now knows West has 4 spades headed by nothing :-)  South cannot have more than 4 spades , so West has 4, per East|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panosk: S ahs to win this and play spades to defeat |pg||
nt|panosk: *has|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @DA missing, it is difficult to do anything in @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  maybe the @sT, East thinks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: may go down on this line|pg||
nt|ady: must resist a heart switch|pg||
nt|ady: continuation of spade   seems only 8 tricks  unless finessing club   unlikely play|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: knowing E/W open on lowest 4 card suit, east is favourite to hold 4@h's?|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR W opened 1C, E had no problem to bid 4@S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andersk: @C 10 convinient|pg||
nt|bobholl: NE now playing tic tac tor|pg||
nt|panosk: dont try it at home as the used to say in TV |pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos:  we dont know what 3@h  meant  but seems likely to show red two suiter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with longer @d?|pg||
nt|mamos:  South's values dont look slammish|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|djneill:  @s5 (no!)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: correct.|pg||
nt|panosk: spade most probably|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kemperg: Bakke afraid of misfit after P opend 1@H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panosk: no @H return K@H must be on side |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|murat e: on a club lead declarer will first be happy and then a sad man.....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: close match and tough hands.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|STRIK3R: hard to get this right|pg||
nt|ady: even on a heart switch  still 1 trick short|pg||
nt|kemperg: to see bidding in OR hoover over the contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: guess 2NT just made (a push)|pg||
nt|bobholl: on board 9 the @H @S game S didn't lead his singleton so 4@S made|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gsper:  I would have banged down the @DA|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: assuming only 3 club tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos:  we are a long way ahead of the other table 22-22 after six boards scored  - lots more imps to come i'd guess|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gsper:  But Nybo apparently could deduce from the bidding that it could not be lost|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panosk: not a single push after 11 boards impressive|pg||
pc|h4|nt|panosk: Hansen cant suspect light openning so he cant play a trump back|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|STRIK3R: doing great now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb:  Turned a probable plus score into a significant minus|pg||

pc|s4|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzhc: sorry,must have missed something,they wrote 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|STRIK3R: North had to discard a @d, and not the low @h|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ady: as expected   Bergen got another 11 imps on hand 25   playing 5 clubs down   against 5@D making  here|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s7|pc|d9|pc|h9|pg||

nt|panosk: 3@S my guess from S|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|panosk: 3@H is beter|pg||

nt|djneill:  same @s as West had almost|pg||
nt|ady: in fact 2@H by n/s can be defeated if defenders take a diamond ruff   |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if you are really positive you lead K of @d|pg||

mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: 3@h would be expensive if it was doubled|pg||

mb|p|nt|panosk: like Jeanine suggested 1st real candidate board for a push|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panosk: cant see this making |pg||

pc|c4|nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||

nt|andersk: this board was played befor they got the vougraph broadcast up after problems with card files, dont look at movie, movie is wrong but result is right|pg||
nt|panosk: diamonds make clubs dont|pg||
nt|murat e: open one dia and bid 6 clubs next is the easiest way to reach slam - if south does not open-|pg||
nt|djneill:  I never had success with the "minimum opening hand" weak twos in 4th seat, I don't know, it just seemed not to help|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: np Astrid :)|pg||
nt|panosk: after 3@H by S he has some extra clues|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Interesting board tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 6 @H makes NS on a @D lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|STRIK3R: possible pickup here, 3NT makes N/S?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@C opening in OR, not good, to strong for that|pg||
nt|panosk: excellent result in OR for Tromsp|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kemperg: all specs agree an upgrade|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: on a non @C |pg||
nt|andersk: I didnt consider other leads than @C or @D :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: contremplating something else as 3nt ?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: sorry no, not making|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S for sure|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: N looks tempted to rise|pg||
nt|kemperg: rdl = @HA|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: if south makes a lightner double west can revert to diamonds....|pg||
nt|panosk: quite reasonably|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe NS should have a deefence to show MM here|pg||
nt|ady: could make on a heart lead if played by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade lead best against 3NT    but  around 11 tricks on the lay|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@D ???|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@H dont make|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: sry not meant this|pg||
nt|ady: club lead may hold to 10 as Jack will be played|pg||
pc|c6|nt|djneill:  will be a little worrisome, South the danger hand, hard to avoid South for sure - danger hand being the one you do not want on lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  wellSouth has pushed on to 5@s  which may be a mistake with the bad break - 4@s  might have made but 5@s looks too much|pg||
nt|panosk: can make 5 now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  North's silence over both 2@c and 3@d seems somewhet less than optimal|pg||
nt|andersk: Actually EW deserve to loose IMPs for not bidding this great slam|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: according to their cc they use suction(yes lek in Norwegian) vs strong 1@c and 2@c, maybe Christer was hoping for some Major fit E/W|pg||
nt|andersk: instead they win 13|pg||
nt|henryb:  10, I think for non-vul|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad defence.....|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andersk: Trust me, Christer pass was not hopeing EW had major fit, too much unlikely|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: any lead but @c played from North|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely fir north to bid no-trumps|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|djneill:  if West had a suit like AT9x    K8xx  there would be some control over who to lose to when setting up a side suit|pg||
nt|baldjean: no, 5@h is the utmost|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andersk: yes 10  sorry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Old saying: 6-5, come alive|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|kemperg: bit fast, 3@S or 4@D better, give p a chance|pg||
nt|baldjean: well judged by both pairs|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|panosk: had to play @D first to get rid of the losing @H|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|ady: can make 9 quickly with queren of clubs coming down    but cashing ace and king of clubs may create an entry to south for spade threw|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bobholl: afraid of @S switch good decision|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must be awake now!!!!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|murat e: he may get trumps right maybe|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk: so plenty more action to come|pg||
nt|bobholl: will become a push unless @H guess goes wrong|pg||
nt|mamos:  one that got away  both ways|pg||
nt|panosk: this is the last board of this match|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|murat e: spade lead was better here|pg||
nt|ady: only a spade lead and miss guess can beat 6@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  Looks like Helgemo will gain 2 imps here|pg||
nt|andersk: @H A now and Helgemo will gain 3 IMP|pg||
nt|panosk: true but i think will be ducked|pg||
nt|panosk: and 5 more from earlier efforts|pg||
nt|andersk: thx to co-commentators NBF and Namsos BK, see you all in about 45 minutes :)|pg||
nt|murat e: if declarer makes the mistake of ducking twice east shifts to a club and if this one also ducked another club cuts declarer off to his hand of course these scenarios not correct ...|pg||
nt|murat e: with helgemo playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
nt|panosk: thx ato our excellent operator Kristian|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|panosk: thx vm Kristoffer|pg||
pc|c5|nt|djneill:  looks like it plays like a double-squeeze even if plays 3 hearts, unless they force out the @d entry early|pg||
nt|ady: once the spade loser is thrown on K@C   east will draw 2 trumps   and play diamonds ruffing the 4th diamond|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board thanks to ouroperator Robert Althe and all kibs|pg||
pc|c7|nt|murat e: after the ace of spades cashed the 9 spot did not appear so he should have worked out the possible layouts in the trump suit|pg||
nt|panosk: 3 imps it is |pg||
nt|ady: best lead    but looks a push with 9 easy tricks|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think so too|pg||
