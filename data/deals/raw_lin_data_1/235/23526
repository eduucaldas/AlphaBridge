nt|ady: club finesse rather|pg||

mb|p|nt|sverjohn: It is quite a surprise that Drammen should have this kind of lead. Kristiansand clear favourites in this match|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another slam @s or @d?|pg||
nt|knutte: Looks like Heimdal, Bergen and Kristiansand will settle for the medals|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|panosk: W pass?|pg||

nt|panosk: past results and standings here  http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||

mb|2H|nt|osvaill83: slam can be made on a nice layout :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@S should make.|pg||
nt|osvaill83: 6nt as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: in 6@d declarer can go wrong, but not in 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: @D layout dicey:)|pg||

nt|sverjohn: A bit surprised that Holm did not put pressure on opponents with a 3@d bid|pg||

nt|mamos:  is this a two suiter?|pg||
nt|knutte: 4 @S makable NS|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing the 2nd @d was a mistake|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: better X or 1NT ?|pg||
nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: i like X with 4/4 M´s|pg||
nt|grebrof: some text went missing :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panosk: lead is very reasonable if you cant see all cards|pg||
pc|s7|nt|murat e: 3 hearts surely bid by west as a transfer bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S+2@H+3@D+2@C=9 and @S hook can provide the 10th trick.|pg||
nt|murat e: or a single and choose contract bid we dont know|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobholl: i would double too but 3 nt won't make i guess|pg||
nt|ybob: with doubleton @D better|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C the best spot to E-W|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ugly - slam decent but the red suits do them in|pg||
nt|mamos:  wow  game is certainly close|pg||
nt|panosk: a more observant fellow spec suggested that if S plays low spade in 2nd trick E will not make|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|murat e: if south did not open 3 nt from west is good on a heart lead but that is gone|pg||
nt|knutte: Just as my tricks sometimes does :)|pg||
nt|knutte: Good bidding by NS here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|murat e: sory it was as it is here|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||

nt|ybob: not hard i think ...|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: there is 3 definatge losers in spade and spade ruff   and a trump trick  and will have to cope with the bad diamond split|pg||
pc|c2|nt|oliverc: Burns Law violation in progress :)|pg||
nt|panosk: must duck|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panosk: today's schedule has only 1 and a half match in line, so just 48 boards to be played|pg||
nt|panosk: piece of cake compared to 80 boards played yesterday|pg||
pc|cK|nt|knutte: Not much points but nice layout|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: now club switch    but may still make on an end play|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|murat e: 2 dia maybe showed both majors|pg||
nt|rnmalik: To think of yes plausible.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panosk: even that wudnt be enough |pg||
nt|mamos:  i think looking at the nS hands youd want to b e in 4@s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @h lead isn´t my lead as W. @cQ or @cJ depending on leads. Why? the shorter suit has more odds for the defence|pg||
pc|d9|nt|murat e: this hand shows how important to open the bidding when the suit is good without jack of clubs it is 11 hcp must still open at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|gsper:  Ekrens, popular in Norway though Ekren does no longer play it|pg||

pc|d6|pc|c5|pg||

nt|ybob: i go out on next hand, i leave you on good hands with Bob and Murat|pg||
nt|bobholl: ty bob :)|pg||
nt|panosk: wasnt possible to make anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: http://www.namsosbk.org/Lag-NM-i-Namsos-25-28-mai|pg||
nt|panosk: nice hands |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: similar trump suit|pg||
nt|ady: was a case for playing ace of spades first round    but as it went needed to play K@C   first round  draw trump and exit with a club    either defender is end played|pg||
nt|ady: part score in sspades for e/w|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|panosk: 1st segment was very exciting, this will be too|pg||
nt|murat e: yes but previous board maybe bidding was different at the table....|pg||
nt|panosk: i think W have doubled 2@H |pg||
nt|ybob: thx all :)|pg||
nt|panosk: open to suggestions for East's bid :)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rnmalik: hi & wlc.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Apart from that I understand that bidding is fairly standard on both sides|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT on 19 is expert practice, usually described as upgrading to 20|pg||
nt|murat e: here north has too much property on spades which does not suit south if he was thinking about a dia slam|pg||
nt|murat e: ty bye|pg||
nt|ybob: bye|pg||
nt|panosk: 21C majors obviously|pg||
mb|3N|nt|murat e: if partner bidding volunterely at five level vulnerable how did west pass|pg||
nt|panosk: *2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: poor north difficult choice|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes i do agree  you cannot expect to make many @h tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The best use of the green card.|pg||
mb|p|nt|knutte: 9 tricks in @S EW at the most, NS might make 4 @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Sensible. Few pairs have good methods for minor slams after 2NT opening.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have a fortunate 4 hearts    but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 spades|pg||
nt|knutte: For res: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mamos:  this is solid|pg||
nt|panosk: thats declares 9th trick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: guess 2NT is lebensohl and than he guessed well|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades down if clubs attacked early before diamond set up|pg||
nt|panosk: *declarer's|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: add the 9 of hearts to E/W  then 4 spades around 75 percent|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|murat e: normally after 2 nt 3 sp is transfer to 3 nt after which responder bids his minor to show slam interest|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobholl: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|oliverc: Anyone else for "Pass" with the West hand?|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S make but impossible to find, i'd personally venture a 3@C bid in case pard has 6-4 with cubs second suit|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|ady: north has taken the push     hard to judge    should be down 1|pg||
nt|ady: especially on diamond lead|pg||
nt|panosk: with spades behaving this will make|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|panosk: not me Oliver sorry , not of that disposition in life :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oliverc: Must be the Aegean sun :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: defending 4 spades  may not be clear  how to defend after cashing A@H unless south casn give a suit preference signal|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sverjohn: Looks like 9 tricks could be the limit here. Actually not unreasonable to get to game|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|gsper:  Is that standard in Norway, KÃ¥re?|pg||
nt|murat e: but south instead of taking an adventure made a sensible bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can make 6 on any lead, same play. Am I right?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Seems so to me too.|pg||
nt|andersk: hi|pg||
nt|ady: also a good chance of 10 tricks if the K@C was woth north    may be able to play a club towards the queen  and create a discard of a heart later|pg||
nt|knutte: Bergen gained 11 imp at board 17 |pg||
pc|d6|nt|panosk: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: movie is updated|pg||
nt|grebrof: I like 4@s - many times it makes|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bobholl: underlead indicated but doesn't help|pg||
nt|knutte: The clue was to find the A of @C|pg||
pc|dT|nt|panosk: avoidance in @S to be safe with @C return|pg||
nt|panosk: its all over the world nowadays, spreading like a contagion|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panosk: i very much like 3NT by S, bold but you have to be in this time cause you cant actually check if pard has stoppers in both majors |pg||
pc|h9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: the 2@s opening was 5/6 - 10/11 in this vul, promising 5@s and normaly a 4+ minor suit, but could be only 3 card minor on the side|pg||
nt|knutte: also put opps under pressure|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c6|nt|bobholl: guess a1D small @D|pg||
nt|ady: east thinking spade trick likely to make   not knowing opening a 7 card suit|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: after the @d switch, no warning bells?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sverjohn: Got his tenth there. South had to switch to a diamond trick 2|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|knutte: understandable 5 @C from Eide|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sverjohn: to set up the club trick|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: not eenough entries to cross to north hand and take club finesse and return for long club|pg||
nt|knutte: K of @D and one down|pg||

mb|1N|nt|panosk: thx O R|pg||
nt|andersk: 4 @C was alerted as short, but I beleve it was asking partner to transfeer to he's major|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@c for E?|pg||
nt|panosk: defence was excellent in last |pg||
nt|knutte: 4 @S a good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: this time 8-5 for a change|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if he intend to open in first hand that is|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|knutte: not easy for Eide now|pg||
nt|grebrof: 5@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: slam time    6 spades for n/s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes 4@c looks fair|pg||
nt|mamos:  specsakke agrees :)|pg||
nt|panosk: N was thinking 1NT or 1@H?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|knutte: Must close his eyes and make a 3NT bid :)|pg||
nt|panosk: both ok in this hand, i slightly favor 1NT too|pg||
mb|p|nt|knutte: or keep them open and pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Preempting with a 5-card major on the side is very unclassical, but what do you do?|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the 1972 Olympics, a Canadian opened 4@H with 6-6 in the majors. The opps...|pg||
nt|gsper:  bid 4@S, he doubled and it made|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@c one long suit|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to 3NT    but may have a difficult ride|pg||
nt|mamos:  its poss that 4@c is Texas|pg||
nt|panosk: trumps break well for decl |pg||
nt|knutte: N must switch to small @S after A of @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: opted for part score|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Caution may pay off here. Guess Frank did not like his club holding|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andersk: looks like 9 tricks for NS in @H and 8 EW in sp|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@C= i have long unspecified suit, 2@D say which|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: need to ruff 2 hearts to make |pg||
pc|hT|nt|bobholl: and on @C lead no entries to do that|pg||
nt|ady: or possibly ruff 1 heart and set up long club|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|andersk: Peronally I overcall 1 @S with Nybo's hand|pg||
nt|ady: low spase now best|pg||
nt|andersk: what line?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gsper:  In general, if you have 5 trumps it is a good idea to lead one. I am not sure how it would have worked here.|pg||
nt|murat e: i think heart lead and dia shift needed to beat this contract|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree |pg||
nt|murat e: helgamos hand is rubbish and he has a passed parnner but hands fit very well|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: W must be feeling low on missing 4@S by that preempt and the defence cashed their tricks to the max.|pg||
nt|grebrof: interesting choice of switch|pg||
nt|knutte: Didnt see that one coming|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andersk: after 3. hand openings and not vouln, m|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: West was in perfect spot for using "snapdragon", but they dont have that in their cc, dbl(snapdragon) would have showed 5@s and minimum Tx in @d|pg||
nt|grebrof: makes now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: club lead is awkard    east has 3 spades to the 10 and doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: North thinking...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards - easy.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panosk: in board 2 4@S were made hence 12 imps to Drammen|pg||
nt|andersk: needed to switch @D to couse any problems|pg||
nt|panosk: not an easy contract|pg||
nt|grebrof: or|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panosk: its a hopeless contract |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|ady: even on this lead  awkward to make 12 tricks on the lay|pg||

nt|wygbe1: i wonder why n didnt act sooner|pg||
nt|mamos:  no reason to choose anything other than this straightforward line is there?|pg||

pc|d8|nt|ady: dont think can get back and forth without east getting a trump promotion|pg||
nt|knutte: Yes, makes now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|knutte: because of @H 3-3 :)|pg||

nt|ady: 17 and 18 were both 6 imps for the leaders making 3NT|pg||
nt|panosk: EW chose to play in NT in board 2 which went -3 hence 11 imps to Kristiansands|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andersk: Press live update in left meny|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks for e/w in hearts|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: n/s save in 4@S  down 4 on best defence|pg||
nt|ady: a good swing here for North if resisting any save|pg||
nt|ady: surely wont  save with ace and king of clubs to defend|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H here my guess|pg||
nt|knutte: Now a cold 3 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|gsper:  Presumably N can correct 3@C to 3@D without showing extras|pg||
nt|andersk: or this link : v|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andersk: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
nt|panosk: players are also humans so they make a wrong decision from time to, its the duration that counts|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: leades gained 10 on hand 19 where club end play was found   though defence made it a little easier by cashing ace of clubs|pg||
nt|knutte: 6 @D will make - as many spec already have told me :)|pg||
nt|panosk: they play std count, low enc. thx |pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: 4 hearts should play for 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: dia finesse not working so both 3 nt and 5 dia are destined to fail|pg||
nt|ady: no lead gives this any chance|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT also a make|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 12 tricks from the top with no finesses :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Flott/Nybo is not bidding much :)|pg||
nt|panosk: i bet W he will take extra time to play  this :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S maybe a tad too much with a passed partner|pg||
nt|panosk: especially since you hold 4@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhc: good guess|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S play what we could call UDA, upside down attitude, compared to STANDARD, Standard is HI-LO to show even number of cards, but hight card encouring, UDA would be HI-LO to show ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: even number of cards, but low card as encouringing|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andersk: Bakke thinking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 2@c is rather clear - isn´t it?|pg||
nt|andersk: If he pass, Helgomo knowes he's partner have a hand|pg||
nt|panosk: another hard 1 for decl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: your guess correct :)|pg||
nt|panosk: i think its very reasonable bidding |pg||
nt|panosk: this will be ducked|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panosk: im ok with pass in 2nd no 4-4 majors|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gsper:  I wonder if 2NT was natural (unusual these days) or minors or something|pg||
nt|panosk: the rest two suits more likely|pg||
nt|murat e: red against white east did not fancy a negative double here|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hi David I will join you for the rest of this set|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Ronny    welcome|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 8 tricks for S - at least....|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: that was a surprise....|pg||
nt|andersk: probably 8 tricks, even 9 on a good day|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|panosk: i think trump now by W, or 10@H|pg||
nt|panosk: trump doesnt look appealing to W as he may reveal trump lay out, @D and @C are out of the question i think|pg||
pc|d5|nt|panosk: @C from dummy and if no @D return he will make|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dQ|nt|ady: in a hopless 6 diamonds here|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Dag did his work bidding 3@s on this one, making it hard for East/West to make a controlled auction|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|panosk: E doing his bit with highest @C available|pg||
nt|panosk: not a clear sign though|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what switch @S or @D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: high @c = spade ?|pg||
nt|panosk: most likely |pg||
nt|panosk: depends on their agreements|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, weired 1nt|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: should be the first swing this set for Tromse|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|STRIK3R: Sitting in east seat, x of 1@h would normaly promise @d as well as @s, holding T72 in @d you dont want your partner to start bidding @d's, beside you know North has some @s's. ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Think pass of 2@c is ok in Teams|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|panosk: in board 18 as was accurately suggested by operator Astrid earlier EW cud make 3NT which they did |pg||
nt|panosk: in open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo should have played the 2@C.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|STRIK3R: but as the hands are, N/S would have stopped bidding on either bid from west|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andersk: EW might block the @H's and W might be endplayed for 9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: true   if you bang out top cards you can make 6 hearts 3 diamonds 2 clubs and 1 spade|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hi all|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panosk: maybe still cant blame W at all very hard to find |pg||
pc|c5|nt|andersk: 8 most likely|pg||
nt|mamos:  West's double turns out  to be poorly timed here - i think it was too aggressive |pg||

nt|ady: a more secure 6@D this time  for n/s|pg||
nt|panosk: as you can see from this board banging Aces on the lead never a gd choice, even stiff ones, let decl find them him/herself|pg||
nt|ady: hi Ronny|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S will reach 3NT and will most likely win it, just loosing 2@s and 2@d's|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree. |pg||
nt|panosk: you mean in the bidding?|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry private |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|STRIK3R: nice @d slam now|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Interestingly, on board 1, 4@S was made against that awful trump break in the other room|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|STRIK3R: 3@s?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: from east|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S   too expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: a coffee break board :)|pg||
nt|panosk: Hansen has got to play all hopeless contracts so far, i bet he wished he sat North by now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Stokkvik was not pleased when his pd lost th2nd down by discarding @H 9 in stead of @D9|pg||
nt|knutte: 6 @D will have more than 50% chance as some specs suggested|pg||
nt|panosk: nice grand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|murat e: to make 3 nt west needs help in heart suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: no "muiderberg" (5@S and 4+ minor 6-10) nice weapont to have|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: E/W was never afraid of bidding|pg||
nt|panosk: impressive they imediately started next board , no comments about previous board, exemplary attitude|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D now.|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ady: dont thin anything will stop north here|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: west on lead must not cash either one of his aces to beat this slam very tricky hand|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: I was about to say 4@s must look tempting, but hopefully it dosent promise void|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: from North|pg||
mb|3S|nt|panosk: or not to be touched at all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: @H is 4-4 so no problems for declearer here|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@H shud be relay 3@H transfer i think, correct me if im wrong|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2NT showing 25-27|pg||
nt|panosk: yes i remember that from yesterday quite rare |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@h just relay, and 3@h is transfer, correct :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@h as realy is pretty common in Norway|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: relay...|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Stokkvik is thinking..|pg||
mb|6S|nt|panosk: NT not a safe place for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: East wouldent like to see that @d holding in dummy after he lead A of @d|pg||
nt|panosk: S will pass|pg||
nt|panosk: whud ask for Aces i think|pg||
nt|panosk: *shud|pg||
mb|7S|nt|bobholl: 4@S nice save|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: dont think south will get exited  even with a void spade opposite|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not this time :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  nine on top|pg||
nt|larsarthur: auauau|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: gd thing for decl W can get to play only on the lead, the rest is pretty tough|pg||
nt|knutte: 3 @H will make, but u wouldnt like to be any higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  That pass by S was disciplined, to say the least|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: A of @s continuation looks normal|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Yes a spade lead would have worried north more|pg||
nt|ady: re all    had connection problems|pg||
nt|panosk: dont know what the meanning of 4@C is in their system but maybe easilly misunderstood as 2nd suit if not clear agreement |pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rnmalik: lose one in each suit.|pg||
nt|panosk: so i vote for Aces but open to other suggestions|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Oliver|pg||
pc|c3|nt|murat e: actually heart slam is good|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: indeed would have been nice|pg||
nt|panosk: N has to play for Ax @D on side to make|pg||
pc|c7|nt|murat e: dummys club can be discarded on long spade|pg||
nt|panosk: that is also true|pg||
nt|panosk: gd guess to ruff high|pg||
nt|knutte: well, why listen to me :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Still have :)|pg||
nt|knutte: opps just keep pushing spades|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|panosk: but which is the right side ? :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Play @D from the dummy to make.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|oliverc: 6@S from an aceless hand maybe a little risky (perhaps 4@C), but it got them there|pg||
pc|sK|nt|STRIK3R: but not sure you would choose to save in this vul|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: everybody who knows Frank, know that he uses strict rules, so his 1NT opening is most likely solid, and he rearly overbid hsi hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|murat e: yes help from partner or help from opps both exist here for his luck|pg||
nt|panosk: heats and heart and heart will be the winning play here|pg||
nt|panosk: thats what i meant after 1@S overcall|pg||
pc|s3|nt|knutte: might switch to K of @C?|pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like it makes|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: was not many choices on the play there|pg||
nt|panosk: it wasnt easy from the start|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: South had all the right points, AK, AK, AK and A, the perfect count for 25 hcp|pg||
mb|1C|nt|murat e: declarers usually have a void or single at this type of auction so the lead was not absurd|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Nybo didnt even care to try get an overtrick, and thats how you play when you play teamscooring:)|pg||
nt|ady: another slam    this time 6@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes, even on a @s lead, since the @c breaks 3-2 and you have the @d's|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D weak 2 in unknown major i guess|pg||
mb|1D|nt|STRIK3R: constructive 2@h openings|pg||
nt|bobholl: fairly good suit :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: south might be tempted to go for a game in NT|pg||
nt|ady: I thin slightly better choice last hand Ronny    could have played 3 round sof hearts after drawing trumps  just in case east was 3 - 4 -2-4  in which case would be later squeezed|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: ref board 21 when he dident bid game after invitaton from south|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board4= In the OR no preempt and landed in 5@C rather than 4@S.|pg||
nt|panosk: back to "normal" crazy distributions |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: could have AK AKQJ KQJ QJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: that is true|pg||

nt|panosk: still 4@S also make |pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: I was thinking more after the first round of @c, since west showed up with a small one, you couldent really defend against J97x in east hand, but as you say, you would having that ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: squeeze going|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3@s preemtive I guess|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4 hearts    but 4 spades a good save for n/s|pg||
nt|mamos:  may well be 3NT again|pg||
nt|panosk: and plent of entries in his hand to establish a suit for an extra trick shud that was needed|pg||
mb|3N|nt|STRIK3R: 3@c asking for strengt and suit quality|pg||
nt|bobholl: playing multi we would bid 2@D 2nt and than 3 nt show akq 6th :) in any coulour|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3NT= max suit and max strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: might stop now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: best manche|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  dont wait too long to get to 6 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: 2NT from south would have been forcing asking for singleton/void|pg||
nt|panosk: i like the one with 2 bare kings :)|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|STRIK3R: unless going for the @c suit|pg||
pc|c9|nt|panosk: shud have taken from hand to play spade|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: hand 21  played in game here provided a swing for Tromse as I tht would slam went down in OR|pg||
pc|h9|nt|murat e: can north deblock his queen of spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad guesser as usual (ask my P)|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer has entry problems from one hand to the other|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: wont distroy his income to dummy before setting up the winning @d's, all he need is to develop 1 trick beside his 6 clear winners|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards, now @dJ and if it holds, a @c to @cQ and a @s finess....|pg||
nt|panosk: decl worried about 4-2 trump break and considers his options |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Tromsø gained 8 imps in brd 21|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andersk: I like Flott's line here, playing @C first|pg||
nt|panosk: can pls someone ship the board dealing software to Greek Federation :)|pg||

pc|c3|nt|STRIK3R: for 9 total tricks|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|andersk: He will duck|pg||
nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: I think I would prefeer a duck|pg||
nt|andersk: Helgemo might hav a stiff @S K or KJ stiffed, as he had|pg||
nt|baldjean: he should take in hand then; it gives him more options|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|STRIK3R: ups, bad guess :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 10@D to avoid blocking @D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andersk: That would force him to play another suit|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|knutte: so down with this contract, possible imps for EW as @H-contract makes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|panosk: i mean these hands are tough but so much more interesting |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|panosk: why spade shift from N and not heart?|pg||
nt|panosk: i think declarer will manage to steal a @D trick too eventually|pg||
nt|oliverc: Yes. South will come to 2 Diamonds and the A@C, but that's all|pg||
pc|sT|nt|panosk: and testing |pg||
nt|panosk: was thinking an end play in @D |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|baldjean: would be  safe to rujn 1 more round ofo trump|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sverjohn: Yes, spade or diamond would have killed it|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|baldjean: as long as communication betweeen hand and dummy is still there|pg||
nt|panosk: i think E whud have ducked 1 round of @D, but thought @C return was single|pg||
nt|panosk: *shud|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: short break|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would have ducked @d too|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Marstarander opened 1@C on brd 21 in OR, while Solli Hansen opened 1@D here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: I like his 3rd hand oopening 1@C - |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: He wants pd to lead @C and not @D if opps get to play the contract.|pg||
nt|panosk: if its not strong @C i cant see the benefit in general, apart from this board|pg||
nt|panosk: with an 18 holding you hope to play, not to defend|pg||
nt|panosk: 41 imps exchanging hands in 1st six boards, translating to an imp gain for Kristiansands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so +1|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|STRIK3R: because he know that east has 0-2 @s's, so the @s suit is most likely blocked|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|vugraphzhc: Stokkvik does not like dummy very much :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: thats the problem pre-empting with 6 card suits   hard to evaluate with a good hand opposite that|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: or if south ducked the @h lead|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: nothing seems easy here, except the @s layout|pg||
nt|sverjohn: As we thought a swing to Kristiansand on board 19. 4h was beaten|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|knutte: Yes, but the set up for today shd be good :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bobholl: 4@S difficult now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so N/S missed out a good sac in @d or @h, the 1@h opening probably scared North |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: and only 9 tricks in @s as well, I will not make analyzes anymore, sorry... :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: could have been down on @H ruff but S expects no @D A in N|pg||
nt|panosk: sspade and wishfull thinking|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: playing one round of @c and two times @H, would later endplay east in @d|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panosk: the argument here is that E opened @D and then showed very strong hand |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|panosk: against the @d lead that is|pg||
nt|panosk: its the 3 and 2 in @C to start with |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Helgemo playing 4@sx on board number 6 in open now, the result is not clear yet, might make, might go down|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: hi Ronny|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: re David :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: I get a lot of comments that GIB suggestin it to make, I dont use GIB :)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: A bit too double-dummy I think. Guess he will go after diamonds|pg||
pc|s6|nt|panosk: in 19 slam in @C bid and made so 13 to Heimdal|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panosk: which meand hope Q@C on side|pg||

pc|hT|nt|oliverc: this will get expensive now|pg||
nt|panosk: and 4@H dont seem to make|pg||
nt|oliverc: no. I think 9 tricks the absolute limit for EW in hearts|pg||
nt|panosk: due to lack of entries mainly|pg||
nt|oliverc: and even that might depend on some help from Opps|pg||
nt|oliverc: West must surely ruff here and force a high ruff from North rather than a cheap one|pg||

mb|3S|nt|andersk: Helgemo I hopeing for a D from partner|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: NT N/S would be a interesting play|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 4@s down one could very well be a flat board|pg||

mb|p|nt|knutte: not my chice to dbl - i like 1 @S |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bobholl: yes guess it was check back passed :)|pg||

nt|knutte: sry - choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: wrong...|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@D not bad EW, however it cant make|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if you play weak 2 as their cc states, that is not a 2@s opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Christer is thinking, %&&/%¤&(=(&/)/&/) :)|pg||
nt|murat e: spade discard|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: pass in south now show 0-2@s's|pg||
nt|ady: firstr quiet hand|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: shall we predict just making? 2@c that is|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: though last hand could have been defeated  south might have considered saving in 6@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: an another 13 imp to Tromsø, 1 IMP now|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Would have opened 1 spade. But this could have worked out well|pg||
nt|knutte: Good contract thou :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S can make DD|pg||
nt|oliverc: this should be ok|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panosk: 4@C by S is new suit or cue bid in spades?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not checback, xyNT 2@c forces 2@d|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But a weak 2 opener should never bid again, so this could have waked up Holm|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: that was expected Ronny    6@D  - 1  with ace and king of clubs to loose|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|murat e: south accepts game-try and bids 3 nt with 4-3-3-3 flat distribution|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT is usually some kind of relay nowadays|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so we guess east forgot system, or was not sure if the system was on after an intial pass in opening from west(ref board 4 in open room)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 6-5 is obvious|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|gsper:  But you are right that natural fits this bidding|pg||
nt|murat e: north thinks 4 hearts is better in fact both contracts make|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would not like to pass, to be honest. the @s of partner can't be too good|pg||
nt|panosk: what does 5@S mean? |pg||
nt|panosk: cant be asking for spade honors to go to slam|pg||
nt|oliverc: maybe not. needs to get the Clubs right here|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: More imps to Tromsø, as Heimdal only bid 6@s on board 7|pg||
nt|oliverc: unbelievable :)|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: have to loose a @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: and may bee a @H :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: indeed, even that|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kemperg: not a 50% slam, @SQ and @CK had to behave|pg||

mb|1C|nt|STRIK3R: no, they stopped in 5@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|gsper:  Heimdal with their two Bermuda Bowl winners are falling behind|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: on board 7 the 2@S opener did it's job :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: passed out I would think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t open on W. am I alone?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: routine 4@S |pg||
nt|panosk: S overcall limits EW chances to 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: again a -4 of a major- contract and friendly distributions |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: and Bergen just bought 5@c undobled on the same deal Jim bid 5@d alone|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H can make here    but takes some reaching|pg||
nt|ady: no  west decides to respond|pg||
nt|panosk: shud be but bear in mind E has a great hand|pg||
nt|panosk: brb|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andersk: here is link for running scoores : http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||

nt|knutte: a chance for 800 here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sverjohn: And got his favourite call back  :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: at 4@S lose 2@D and a @C.|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: this sort of hand very common to open a strong notrump in united states|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3@s smolen|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hehe|pg||
nt|mamos:  no  just wondering if they cey didntould stop   t|pg||
nt|grebrof: 6@s at S makes on a @h lead - ruff out @ds - cash winners and endplay in trumps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos:  sorry |pg||
nt|panosk: in open E led a @D in same bidding and contract|pg||
nt|oliverc:  8 top tricks, but little chance of a 9th.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|panosk: dpdending on a @C ruff from =  to +1|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobholl: north won't like the sigth of the 4333 dummy|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: showing 4@s and 5@H, minimum GF values|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|murat e: if declare guesses wrong both diamond and trumps can go down of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass by W?? no support dbl, but 19 pts|pg||
nt|panosk: with @D breaking well decl has only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|murat e: when in with the ace of spades east will play a diamond|pg||
nt|mamos:  not an opener for me|pg||
nt|panosk: if he knew OR result he wud have claimed -1 right now :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: can make this on the lay   but I have my doubts    needs to play clubs twice   and gain entry on thir round   and finesse 10@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: as spec expected, 3NT or dbl|pg||
nt|panosk: *depending|pg||
pc|cA|nt|STRIK3R: hard to make this|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but defence helped declarer|pg||
nt|oliverc: could make if he runs this|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 down on @H lead, 2 down on any other leads|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|bobholl: good inter mediates :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: most likely only GF values, would transfer and bid new suit with better hand|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dan|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|panosk: i agree with Murat 1nt open from S is a gd possible bid|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes    off to a very good start|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kemperg: In OR 3NT on 27, |pg||
nt|knutte: a bit sci-fi I think :)|pg||
nt|panosk: he chose to play with the odds, quite rightly i think |pg||
nt|panosk: the way he played @C gives him 2 chances, either @CQ on side or clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|panosk: on side means with E|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kemperg: discard @S looser|pg||
nt|panosk: thats what we call right sided contract|pg||
pc|hA|nt|panosk: or @D ruff now|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|gsper:  Establish @S or crossruff?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Difficult choice single dummy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobholl: N almost trump short already|pg||
nt|panosk: but unfortunatelyclubs dont behave|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c3|nt|STRIK3R: playing @c to be 3-3 is risky :) better hope for some luck in @s I think|pg||
nt|ady: needs clubs 3=3 with honours split  and J@S onside|pg||
nt|sverjohn: He could have made it through a late entry in clubs follwed by a trump finesse|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer can crosruff or establish spades bot are ok but he does not see as we do with open cards|pg||
nt|kemperg: or @D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andersk: I think Helgemo is max unlucky here. And I totally disagree with 1 NT|pg||
nt|andersk: Helgemo have 43 in major, so if partner can bid a major over 1 @d he is normally in very good shape|pg||
nt|andersk: Very unlucky to play 3 NT|pg||
nt|panosk: how do u lose playing in majors after 1NT ?|pg||
nt|andersk: with the favouruble @H 3-3 NS probably would have made 3 @H|pg||
nt|panosk: still he will make|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|andersk: 1 NT bad, when partner dont have majors (which he often does not have when you self have 4-3 in MM)|pg||
nt|andersk: This is not over for the 8th trick|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|baldjean: or to -1|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|murat e: plenty of dull hands in a row after that wild start|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a rather nice 6@d on NS|pg||

mb|5C|nt|panosk: *wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: an agressive pair may go on to slam here|pg||
nt|ady: e/w will likely reach 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 4@S interesting, on @S lead @D suit will work and else crossruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: paertnership unserstanding    some lead 2nd highest|pg||
nt|mamos:  :(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hasn´t N showed a red twosuiter?|pg||
nt|henryb:  A strange choice of actions by South|pg||
nt|panosk: 1@S openning is marginal to say the least :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 5@C much safer|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|panosk: i think there are arguments on both sides, depends if you chose to downgrade (1NT) or upgrade (reverse 2@H), anyway Helgemo's opinion shud be respected|pg||
nt|bobholl: east has to guess who has t of @H|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: which Major to lead..|pg||
nt|ady: best lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: bit shy from Bakke|pg||
nt|knutte: running scores: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
nt|knutte: Drammen in the lead, as Heimdal and Bergen shares 1. place with 105 imp|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andersk: How can you be in bad shape if pard can bid 1 M? And if he bids 1 NT tou pass(he often have @C then) 1 NT can be a catastrofe when partner have under 6p and bad majors........I ...|pg||
nt|andersk: rest my case|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very light|pg||
nt|knutte: Drammen leading in the match against Heimdal|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|djneill:  that would help, the @s8 is important not to waste|pg||
pc|s6|nt|murat e: 5-0 break in hearts make it impossible though|pg||
nt|ady: best to play queen  and a low club|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Nice bid by Jensen. Some would dream of 1-3-5-4 by pd and go further|pg||
pc|sA|nt|murat e: otherwise declarer woujd go between one of the black suit finesses|pg||
nt|panosk: compared to last 1 this 3nt will look a walk in the park for Helgemo|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessed rigth|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok so East now knows West has 4 spades headed by nothing :-)  South cannot have more than 4 spades , so West has 4, per East|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panosk: S ahs to win this and play spades to defeat |pg||
nt|panosk: *has|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @DA missing, it is difficult to do anything in @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  maybe the @sT, East thinks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: may go down on this line|pg||
nt|ady: must resist a heart switch|pg||
nt|ady: continuation of spade   seems only 8 tricks  unless finessing club   unlikely play|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: knowing E/W open on lowest 4 card suit, east is favourite to hold 4@h's?|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR W opened 1C, E had no problem to bid 4@S|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andersk: @C 10 convinient|pg||

nt|panosk: dont try it at home as the used to say in TV |pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos:  we dont know what 3@h  meant  but seems likely to show red two suiter|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|djneill:  @s5 (no!)|pg||

nt|ady: even on a heart switch  still 1 trick short|pg||
nt|kemperg: to see bidding in OR hoover over the contract|pg||

nt|andersk: this board was played befor they got the vougraph broadcast up after problems with card files, dont look at movie, movie is wrong but result is right|pg||
nt|panosk: diamonds make clubs dont|pg||
nt|murat e: open one dia and bid 6 clubs next is the easiest way to reach slam - if south does not open-|pg||
nt|djneill:  I never had success with the "minimum opening hand" weak twos in 4th seat, I don't know, it just seemed not to help|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: np Astrid :)|pg||
nt|panosk: after 3@H by S he has some extra clues|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andersk: Interesting board tho|pg||
nt|knutte: 3 more imps to BErgen as Kristiansand has the chance to bring some back on this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 6 @H makes NS on a @D lead|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: possible pickup here, 3NT makes N/S?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@C opening in OR, not good, to strong for that|pg||
nt|panosk: excellent result in OR for Tromsp|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: all specs agree an upgrade|pg||
nt|knutte: Did N open 1 @D?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|panosk: on a non @C |pg||
nt|andersk: I didnt consider other leads than @C or @D :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: contremplating something else as 3nt ?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: sorry no, not making|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: yes|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@H looks beter than 1@H openning in OR|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: N looks tempted to rise|pg||
nt|kemperg: rdl = @HA|pg||
nt|knutte: interresting|pg||
pc|c9|nt|murat e: if south makes a lightner double west can revert to diamonds....|pg||
nt|panosk: quite reasonably|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe NS should have a deefence to show MM here|pg||
nt|ady: could make on a heart lead if played by north|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead best against 3NT    but  around 11 tricks on the lay|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@D ???|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@H dont make|pg||
pc|h9|nt|murat e: sry not meant this|pg||
nt|ady: club lead may hold to 10 as Jack will be played|pg||
pc|h3|nt|djneill:  will be a little worrisome, South the danger hand, hard to avoid South for sure - danger hand being the one you do not want on lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  wellSouth has pushed on to 5@s  which may be a mistake with the bad break - 4@s  might have made but 5@s looks too much|pg||
nt|panosk: can make 5 now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  North's silence over both 2@c and 3@d seems somewhet less than optimal|pg||
nt|andersk: Actually EW deserve to loose IMPs for not bidding this great slam|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: according to their cc they use suction(yes lek in Norwegian) vs strong 1@c and 2@c, maybe Christer was hoping for some Major fit E/W|pg||
nt|andersk: instead they win 13|pg||
nt|henryb:  10, I think for non-vul|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad defence.....|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andersk: Trust me, Christer pass was not hopeing EW had major fit, too much unlikely|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: any lead but @c played from North|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely fir north to bid no-trumps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|djneill:  if West had a suit like AT9x    K8xx  there would be some control over who to lose to when setting up a side suit|pg||
nt|baldjean: no, 5@h is the utmost|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andersk: yes 10  sorry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Old saying: 6-5, come alive|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|knutte: This will give excitement in the end :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kemperg: bit fast, 3@S or 4@D better, give p a chance|pg||
nt|baldjean: well judged by both pairs|pg||
nt|knutte: 5 @C makes and closes the gap|pg||
nt|knutte: not close, but closing in...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|panosk: had to play @D first to get rid of the losing @H|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: can make 9 quickly with queren of clubs coming down    but cashing ace and king of clubs may create an entry to south for spade threw|pg||
nt|panosk: no game is safe trying to score an overtrick|pg||
nt|panosk: *now game , sorry|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobholl: afraid of @S switch good decision|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must be awake now!!!!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|murat e: he may get trumps right maybe|pg||
nt|djneill:  right, and if North has the @dK, that could happen if clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d|pg||
pc|cT|nt|oliverc: All sensible roads leading to 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|STRIK3R: good J of @d discard|pg||
nt|djneill:  the @s spot was encouraging, if 4th best|pg||
nt|panosk: now = and match tied|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: a push |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now S will make|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: the score is in fact 20-34, board 1 is scored wrong way, due to sitting wrongsided when starting this segment in this room|pg||
pc|c5|nt|knutte: 5 or 6 imp gained, depends on number of tricks, than we still have board 28|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: would be awkward on a spade lead  as well|pg||
nt|panosk: K@D return dont seem to jeopardise the contract cause decl will discard a@C and play K@C @C ruff|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|s2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ady: if ducking the first diamond|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: next hand the last of the session     thx all thx operator   and specs|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|panosk: well there is a possible blockage of @D, i still think he might have tried it|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|djneill:  we have the avoidance play after all|pg||
nt|baldjean: club continuation will be awkward for declarer now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|STRIK3R: they are playing last board of the set in open room now|pg||
nt|mamos:  West appears to have missed his chance there   a second @D would have messed up communications|pg||
nt|oliverc: better to discard a @S, ruff the @S, draw trumps and now the Club going away on the|pg||
nt|oliverc: 10@D|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: last session will start in aproximatly 30 minuts, due to start 12:30 local time|pg||

nt|vugraphzhc: last board,2nd half starts 13.15|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: for those wondering what suction is, x of 2@c would have been either @d or bouth Majors, suction is showing either the following suit or the next two|pg||

nt|panosk: next segment will be in 20 minutes approximately|pg||
nt|panosk: to Ronny for his comments and score updates |pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 15.45 according to schedule, 18.15 is last broadcast of today|pg||
nt|djneill:  should East go on?|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Took the save before e-w could find their potential. Might reach 6 h here|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: after 4@d|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 4@s looks ok|pg||
nt|ady: need to bid the slam for a plus on this hand for Drammen|pg||
nt|panosk: to Oliver of course |pg||
pc|h2|nt|andersk: thats 50 minutes from now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: making there as well, @h lead from south|pg||

nt|mamos:  one that got away  both ways|pg||
nt|panosk: this is the last board of this match|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: link to the results http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
pc|cT|nt|murat e: spade lead was better here|pg||
nt|ady: only a spade lead and miss guess can beat 6@H|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  Looks like Helgemo will gain 2 imps here|pg||
nt|andersk: @H A now and Helgemo will gain 3 IMP|pg||
nt|panosk: true but i think will be ducked|pg||
nt|panosk: and 5 more from earlier efforts|pg||
nt|andersk: thx to co-commentators NBF and Namsos BK, see you all in about 45 minutes :)|pg||
nt|murat e: if declarer makes the mistake of ducking twice east shifts to a club and if this one also ducked another club cuts declarer off to his hand of course these scenarios not correct ...|pg||
nt|murat e: with helgemo playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
nt|panosk: thx ato our excellent operator Kristian|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panosk: thx vm Kristoffer|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|djneill:  looks like it plays like a double-squeeze even if plays 3 hearts, unless they force out the @d entry early|pg||
nt|ady: once the spade loser is thrown on K@C   east will draw 2 trumps   and play diamonds ruffing the 4th diamond|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board thanks to ouroperator Robert Althe and all kibs|pg||
nt|oliverc: tough continuation for South|pg||
pc|d9|nt|murat e: after the ace of spades cashed the 9 spot did not appear so he should have worked out the possible layouts in the trump suit|pg||
nt|panosk: 3 imps it is |pg||
nt|ady: best lead    but looks a push with 9 easy tricks|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think so too|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes, will probably just cash his winners|pg||
nt|oliverc: that's as good as anything|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|panosk: more likely -3 so -500 |pg||
nt|panosk: to all of you for your comments and insight |pg||
nt|knutte: will get his 12 at this table also|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: for those looking at the score in the other room, N/S was Kristoffersen/Helgemo, so it was Kristoffersen who went 2 down|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
