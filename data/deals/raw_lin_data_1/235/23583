mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: El remate hubo stayman y luego 3 st.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missed opportunity for trailing team|pg||
nt|runnerup:  nice kvick tricks in 3nt and south has no problems to bid that|pg||
nt|athene: good low-hcp 3nt; 100% secure on any lead and any lie|pg||
nt|athene: yes it shows the power of a long suit with quick tricks outside|pg||
nt|athene: NS don't have a single point wasted in fact|pg||
nt|athene: maybe Duboin is wondering which major to lead?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time 4 @s is anly 300 but you lose in a long run if you bid those -because in all cases ns aren't aware what they do and 3nt can go down|pg||
nt|athene: yes i don't think EW can reasonably contemplate a sacrifice|pg||
nt|athene: -300 vs -400 is the best you can possibly hope for|pg||
nt|athene: and it might often be -300 or -500 against +50|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|sharkey: yes - but 3@H looks like a make so down 1 may be good business|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts should make   so -50  best e/w can do|pg||
nt|tez: ortakta zayýf @s eli olduðunu düþünebilirdi|pg||
nt|leo lasota: very helpful dummy here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: put in 10 clubs|pg||
nt|leo lasota: lead spade towards the dummy trick 2 and see the singleton ace win it|pg||
nt|leo lasota: this will likely still end d1|pg||
nt|leo lasota: if declareer chooses to never lead trumps|pg||
nt|leo lasota: and instead go after hearts|pg||
nt|leo lasota: he can hold this to 5 losers|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 23 imp lead for cappelli with 15 bds to play|pg||
nt|leo lasota: huge pickup for kasle at other table|pg||
nt|leo lasota: assuming peter/steev set this 1 or 2, this would be 12 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: I'm trying to do this table and the Deutsch table until my other operator gets here, so I'll do my best with the bidding and opening lead and result, but won't get much play for ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: you, sorry!|pg||
nt|leo lasota: no worries jan :)_|pg||
nt|leo lasota: just chalk up 12 imps to kasle please :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 121-110 with 14 bds left|pg||
nt|leo lasota: kasle team has certainly had history of strong finishes to win |pg||

nt|sharkey: we shall never know....|pg||
nt|athene: i think he can be sure that east has short clubs, but even so, bidding 6 is not so easy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that wouild probably be a rotten pairs score |pg||
nt|runnerup:  west can wander where ns's tricks come if they make this -south must have lond @d -like 6 cards -north is more balanced perhaps|pg||
nt|tez: ilk eller önemli|pg||
nt|leo lasota: In the Jacoby swiss teams in the Memphis nationals, they stormed at the end and came back to win that |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: probably EW will get a free run in the other room, so then it is a matter of east's rebid after 1@D 1@H|pg||

nt|leo lasota: :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Peter wishes he could just ask Steve if he holds the ace of diamonds :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: some prefer to keep the 2-suited overcalls weak or very strong, so a 12 count might not qualify|pg||
nt|leo lasota: lead may switch hands in just 2 bds last set!|pg||
mb|5C|nt|danilo1: interesting if Nunes overcalls 1NT ... West has ev. Dble on the limit|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2@c 10-13, 5+@C, could be weaker in third seat|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Markku|pg||
mb|5S|nt|athene: now north has to decide between 3@H and a second double|pg||

nt|queequeg: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|athene: close decision in my opinion|pg||
nt|runnerup:  vulnerability is bad so north has about cards to expect by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|gsper:  So 4@S is a good save, but unlikely to be found now|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 123-121 kasle|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no chance here of course|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you just play spades and accept two down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double is more flexible, as they say|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Katz: "this may not be the hand you were hoping for :)"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter/steve with excellent bidding methods on many auctions|pg||
nt|leo lasota: of course peter is extremely relieved to see the queen diamonds :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2 for 2 on the decisions by Peter/Steve this set so far|pg||
nt|leo lasota: preempts certainly result in some guesswork for the opponents|pg||
mc|12|nt|bobholl: with the @H lead surely|pg||

nt|queequeg: Open room, waiting to start|pg||
nt|athene: tricky declarer play problem here|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to decide whether to try to use the spades, or go for two diamond ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is easy when you see all the cards :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter had to choose to take the risk of steve not having the ace diamonds or the queen|pg||

nt|mdgraham: two off with the spade misguess - but it was never making|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we all know the feeling - we are quite happy, until the result of the first board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then it all goes downhill |pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: defence went plus, but it might have gone better|pg||
nt|leo lasota: interesting hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@D=majors|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  should make on the lay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d probably 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|gsper:  1NT 12-14, often offshape|pg||
nt|athene: when south bids 3@H with only six he has to have some shape i think|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe declarer should have played for 4-1 spades, but not easy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where do i collect the 1085 cokes|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2x120 good start for both|pg||
mb|1N!|an|semi forcing|nt|fabsayc: maybe can block the diamonds and survive|pg||
nt|leo lasota: N/S can make 6D!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gsper:  Transfer, of course. E was doing the thinking|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: i prefer 2@C for that purpose, as partner can bid 2@D with no preference|pg||
nt|athene: interesting, he doesn't go 4@H|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt ew here and if something /else ) happens -it is a suprice|pg||
nt|leo lasota: likely to go 3d raise, 5D by north|pg||
nt|leo lasota: whether or not peter raises hearts|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: the problem with opening 4@H is that if opps bid 4@S or 5@C over it, as they very likely will, you are left not knowing what to do|pg||
nt|athene: you would probably be tempted to bid 5@D as partner will never imagine what you have|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: however, the way it has gone, he has hardly shown his hand either|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this auction would show extras for me, and for sure that double was penalty|pg||

mb|1H|nt|tez: 2@s i 2 renkli zayýf el oynuyorlar..|pg||
mb|4S|nt|leo lasota: 1S-1nt, then robinson would likely just rebid 2S with 6412 minimum; whereashe would choose 2h rebid on medium strength+ hand and pattern out|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 30 points between them - cud be probing slam...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10-13, 5+@d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|athene: same sort of bidding problem for south here as faced north a moment ago over the 2@C opener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sort of like a strong weak two|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni-nunes 2-level bids do give their opponents some hard decisions|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: holaa|pg||
nt|mdgraham: getting any higher would not be advisable|pg||

nt|leo lasota: jack clubs and KQ diamonds takle care of 2 losers|pg||
nt|leo lasota: except that north can ruff out the 3rd rd clubs this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: common expert treatment is 1NT on N hand |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a string weak two is presumably a bit weaker than a weak strong two|pg||

nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to ruff a club and pick up trumps, losing just one spade, two diamonds and the @CA|pg||
nt|psyck: to prevent losing 2 trump tricks via @c ruff on a bad day...|pg||
nt|athene: well 3@S can be beaten with diamond ruff and then club shift i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't draw trumps and then get back to dummy fast to throw his club losers on the two good diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: neither do I but else why E bids 5@C:)|pg||
nt|tez: biraz az ama mantýklý 3 nt idi|pg||
nt|kingcur: To break the silence somewhat here, I have volunteered to comment|pg||
nt|kingcur: ah, hello Germ|pg||
nt|leo lasota: robinson will balance with a "robinson/woolsey" dbl to show 4 card major and longer minor if bidding begins P-P-1nt-P-P-|pg||
nt|santyclz: I wonder if the E hand has become an opener.  (Yet?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: 430 in nt, but 6D is a make; will either table find it?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: 4@S  making n/s   but an excellent save for e/w in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know the intricacies of the NS methods but i suspect 2nt showed extras|pg||
nt|athene: but if west led a spade, east could win the @CA and return a diamond and then throw two clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer could never get to dummy as east could overruff with the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, all irrelevant anyway|pg||
nt|athene: or just a club lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5 @c ok -here -4 @h makes ..so |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok, essentially 3@C was modified puppet stayman|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Cor|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: think 3@S max|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some 9 in @h ew if opened and will |pg||
nt|athene: 5@D might come home but 4@C tick would have been a reasonable place to stop i think|pg||
nt|leo lasota: not likely to end in slam after 1d opening :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: this may be huge gain for kasle if it goes all pass...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: although the hand is only 20 HCP, it is a very pure hand with AKQx, AKxxx and a side ace|pg||
nt|leo lasota: opening at the 1 level has serious danger of seeing three pass cards|pg||
nt|leo lasota: unless of course playing precision like kit/fred|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not sure e/w will be able to enter the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if north bid only 2@S and east doubled, that would find the club fit, but that is surely the only way|pg||
nt|athene: and i think north will bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  4 losers in spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: But NS likely will end up in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: the only way 4@S makes is if the defence don't attack diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to bid it - S will decline any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: but that's not happening|pg||
nt|athene: i think north just bids 3@S here and they play there|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree William|pg||
nt|ady: will east enter if north raises to 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@C also possibility - Splinter|pg||
nt|athene: i would probably double 2@S with the east cards|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@C NOT precision style, though it looks that way|pg||
nt|psyck: Right Bill, which is why I guess Markku said better chances played by N|pg||
nt|athene: double fit might come to light here|pg||
nt|tez: 2@h @h ve minör|pg||
nt|tez: dbl ceza deðil ve puan var|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|athene: now a support double for spades i guess, so they find their 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sing @s makes it ofcause dangerous to open 4. hand|pg||
nt|athene: well sort of double fit :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  mainly that and west will lead @h Q --normally -@c lead only after peeping|pg||
nt|athene: many would just raise clubs with east, but sementa obviously feels that with opps bidding hearts, it is worth a lot for your side to find spades, rather than clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: It was in other room|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter will ask for the major|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: south will have trouble showing hand now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: N has a shortage of points but great playing strength when pd bid @S|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt was a spade raise you would think south would bid a discouraging 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will pay to stop low here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like a direct 3@D invite, although the bid has several flaws|pg||
nt|psyck: 2C = 10-13 value, 5C-4other unbalanced, or 6+C|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@D relay asking for 3-card major|pg||
nt|psyck: N's hand becomes powerful with Aces in pd's suit now|pg||
nt|athene: angelini can't bid less than game now, can he? ace in both partner's suits for a single raise|pg||
nt|athene: transfer responses, so 1@S shows diamonds|pg||
nt|kingcur: a weird deal, that previous one. points 20-20 but with extremely favourable lie of the cards for NS|pg||
nt|psyck: a Woolsey style X|pg||
nt|leo lasota: as passed hand, the balancing dbl is almost always on tehj 4 card maj,. longer min|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  3. hands pass -was a view =suprice also|pg||
nt|kemperg: good 5@D rescue, red against green:)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|gsper:  2NT relay again|pg||
nt|athene: ok, apparently he can|pg||
nt|athene: east might balance now with a double|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last makeble bid NS 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think support doubles are not as popular in italy as in america, but still if you double 1@H with 4+ spades here you surely need them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could have responded 2@d, perhaps, but that may be FG, and S isn't quite strong enough for that (non strong-club opener)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry but don't have a CC for NS|pg||
nt|kingcur: so 4@H would have been two off, and 5@C was on ice|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec saw down possibility|pg||
nt|kingcur: except for 3 rounds of hearts, uppercutting West's trump J|pg||
nt|psyck: 3rd @h?|pg||
nt|kemperg: welcome Krishna|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: South beginning to wonder if he should be bidding game here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Peetr's deciswion to balance 1H very reasonable, but unfortunately it was the wrong decision this time|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: still will easy enough for defence to collect their 4 winners  |pg||
nt|athene: ok, the fifth spade is nice, and QJ doubleton is much better when partner opens the suit, but even so...|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i'm told 2NT is 6-4|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tactical 3 @h to play in 4 ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and EW just make 2@S imo|pg||
nt|kingcur: hi Krishna :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ah a spec suggests north is "she" - i was assuming a different angelini haha|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 now -but ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: everyone has shown his hand fairly, except N who should have bid stronger|pg||
nt|athene: i don't understand why west bids spades rather than hearts, but it sure worked out|pg||
nt|psyck: this should come home on the 33 @c's|pg||
nt|leo lasota: no effective defense to set this; cards very favorable for robinson|pg||
nt|santyclz: The Kaplan and Ruben Hand evaluator rates the e hand at 14.00 points.  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=a1095+8+876+aq1082|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so 3@H was just attempting to sign off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT is FG|pg||
nt|athene: even if 2@D response were not GF you might bid a spade anyway so as not to lose the suit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2000 |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h showed 3-4 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d showed 1345|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought the redouble might give EW a better chance to find the right major, if west could pass and let east bid spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  200 -500 with x|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks too aggressive|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so north was weaker than i would have been |pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: very complicated hand, but at least the lead reveals south has no natural lead|pg||
nt|athene: you feel silly here if you try the jack and then south has a singleton queen|pg||
nt|leo lasota: North very relieved that he was able to continue bidding after he saw it begin 1D-P-P-...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: should protect against singleton diamond in peter's hand by playing diamond to the queen, then diamond back to hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota: needs to ensure that he sets up the diamonds while retaining trumps on the board for heart taps|pg||
nt|leo lasota: even though 12 tricks are available if he were to just ruff the 2 hearts on the dummy, that line of play could result on going down in a cold game|pg||
nt|leo lasota: kit elected to just rebid 1S after art forcing 1C-1D on his AKQx and they reached 4S as well|pg||
nt|leo lasota: fred chose 1S |pg||
mc|12|nt|leo lasota: 2 diamonds, 1 of everything else for the defense|pg||
nt|psyck: Aces, all values in long suits which have intermediary cards, extra shape, etc...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right, CK.|pg||

nt|baardolav: 2down with a stiff  clublead... |pg||
nt|psyck: what is your choice of opening here?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: many would choose to open the east hand 2H here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: west might go very quietly here, given the vulnerability here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT=20-21|pg||
nt|jaapfr: easy 4@S|pg||
nt|leo lasota: downgrade QJ dblton|pg||
mb|2D|nt|runnerup:  if you are afread of oppenents to make 5 -level with those cards after partner opens and invites -youll never can bid any games |pg||
nt|santyclz: An old-fashioned 2@h bid.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but peter/steev known to open aggressively, nearky all 11 counts at the 1 level|pg||
nt|leo lasota: steve elects to make the preemptive 2D overcall with 64 in the minors rather than 1D|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: south had made a great lead, and should have known every card at the end|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S-1 on hand 4 cost 12 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|athene: perfect mesh here - singleton facing four small - let's see if they can identify it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to locate @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows some sort of good raise and *south* shows extras and a heart singleton, that will certainly do it|pg||
nt|athene: well, with a ten-card fit you don't usually count the queen of trumps as a problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT 12-14; not 5/4 majors or 4441|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D looking for a 5-3 spade fit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, CC not clear about 3@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3M would be a singleton or void|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead runs to the jack, and declarer will duck a club to north to protect the @SKx i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: if east is thinking this long he must have forgotten the system :)|pg||
nt|athene: wake up, fantoni!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, misread the CC. 1NT can include a 4441 shape.|pg||
nt|athene: EW's 1nt has to cover a lot of hands unsuitable for other bids, sort of like a precision 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: their 1-bids are 14+ points and their 2-bids are unbalanced so the weak notrump has to work hard for its living|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, lots of people; no idea about 3@d|pg||
nt|nilsland:  As often - when you take nine you get ten.|pg||
nt|psyck: deal 4, if declarer had 2@s, & 4@d & @cAQJ... 3rd @h could have sold the contract, so was not easy...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes that makes sense with balanced worthless cards outside @h's|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: always difficult to rerach a normal 4@S after weak NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a partial available both sides.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lovely 1@S bid|pg||
nt|leo lasota: tough sdecision for north now|pg||
nt|leo lasota: does he rebid 2nt on J10x?  does he raise spades on 10x?  |pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: only problem 6@S n/s  is the 3-0 trump split    needs to guess which way to play trumps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Any bidding by EW cud assist declarer in locating the Q|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S=at least 5/4 both minors |pg||
nt|gsper:  That is a heavy overcall by their standards|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S from north will certainly get them there in short order|pg||

nt|leo lasota: steve had the easiest 3H bid there since he could not sign off in 2H :)|pg||
nt|psyck: if your style is to open light, you will certainly open 1@h here at fav vul|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Boyd explains that he had the option of bidding 2NT to show a 4 card game force in this auction. So this tends to suggest 3 trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2N = raise, 5-9 4 crd, 7-9 3-crd, or 8-11 with sing.|pg||
nt|psyck: ouch S dec, sry, i just came  in :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe just natural and strong, and then everything natural-ish, with 3@S showing stopper and concern about hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny, on the copy of the EW CC I have 1NT-3minor is not described at all|pg||

nt|jaapfr: as N i would still think what to bid: pass or 1@H:) your votes pls 1@H or pass?|pg||
nt|kemperg: used to call this a 50% slam, both kings onside or not:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: so he is wondering about a 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|athene: 7@H is better than 7NT here i guess as you can ruff the clubs good if need be|pg||
nt|athene: in MP you want to play 7NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=4@s, |pg||
nt|santyclz: A strong nt opposite an opening bid used to be a strong indication that slam should be  investigated,  but with the lowering of  requirements for opening bids...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: indeed he did giving up on slam|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: either the @SK or 480 was wrong, certainly :)|pg||

pc|dK|nt|athene: well, if you open 11 counts and force to game with 11 counts, you better get used to 22 count games|pg||
nt|leo lasota: while it certainly does require a nice fitting hand from peter to make slam, there are a fair number of 13/14 counts that would be suitable to robinson's hand for slam|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: I very much doubt  Rod-Meckwell would be in 3NT on this collection|pg||
nt|ady: was 2@C game forcing?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after that we're struggling.....|pg||
nt|tez: zor defans|pg||
nt|psyck: so much more than 50%|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: it might look as though declarer only has five losers but if he draws trumps he can't ruff a diamond so he should go one down|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@c cue, 5@C Turbo |pg||

nt|danilo1: 6@H (NT) ... and double @D finess probable|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu konuda belki operatörler veya antalyada olanlardan bilgi alabiliriz|pg||
nt|kemperg: W thinks 4@H has a chance, but 4 @S too|pg||
nt|psyck: 1 hcp less than EW had last hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2D would guarantee 5+, GF|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 2@d instead of 2@c would not be nice at all :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but he wisely elected not to bid 2D as this would not allow for accurate description of his hand with 5 small diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 4@D will only encourage camberos|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@C is ok, as long as partner doesn't think you have to have diamonds for it|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@H     but n/s may play 4@S   for -500|pg||
nt|gsper:  Par seems to be 6@DX|pg||
nt|psyck: only 2 red aces to lose in a @h contract|pg||
nt|psyck: since on @c lead, you can discard on @s & W cannot ruff profitably|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@H wins on @C lead aswell.|pg||
nt|gsper:  N probably has more defense than partner expects|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: EW might have 4@D, at this rate|pg||
nt|athene: obviously east thinks 4@D is forcing, though, which suggests he thinks it is a "new suit" i.e. 2@C does not guarantee any diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: but how to show it now (gazilli ?)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards lie remarkably badly |pg||
nt|athene: ok, i guess he did finesse, but of course makes anyway after no spade shift|pg||

nt|leo lasota: "fast arrival":|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter/steve do not make fast arrivals usually with 3+ controls|pg||
nt|leo lasota: South opens hand perfectly within the rule of 20 with 10HCP and AJxxx in 2 suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i assume the pause there was west thinking, not south|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C natural or various strong hands; 2@S less than 8 points|pg||
nt|athene: you might just bid 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|psyck: non vul, @h sequence, some shape & values on the side, a clear 3@h bid|pg||
nt|athene: no problem in 6@S of course with the miracle diamond lie so the 7 is good|pg||
nt|runnerup:  also in 5 . board 5 @c X -100 like expected -over 4 @h  =6 imps|pg||
nt|athene: but even if south had a higher diamond he would get squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|athene: unless it was diamond lead and diamond continuation after the trump, i suppose|pg||
nt|runnerup:  12 in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: making a slam is the best way to beer|pg||

nt|sharkey: In the other room W opened a weak NT and East bid 4@H|pg||

nt|leo lasota: 4nt = 0/3; 5C = 1/4; 5D = 2/5 without q; 5H = 2/5 with q; 5S  = 0/3 w/ void, 5nt = 1/4  with void, 6C = 2w/void/ withouit q |pg||
nt|psyck: yes it looked like an ideal hand to show void, especially as Steve did not give him a chance to xx by passing 4@d-x|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: yes, duck this looks simplest, then just draw trumps|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need to guess the hearts or anything|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West did not think so|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: 4@Sx by north in open room|pg||

nt|psyck: nice, he may make now|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok here we go |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: It's also not 100% that his shortness is known and those steps for void can only apply if shortness is known|pg||
nt|leo lasota: agreed jan|pg||
nt|psyck: oh ok, so they show void also in rkc fashion, on 4N rkc, 5N as even with void & 6any as odd with void is commonly used...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: auction certainly strongly suggested diamond void as he cue bid, they overcalled 2D and dbled 4D...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: But I think he probably didn't show the void because he'd already shown a slammish hand and in the context of the auction he didn't want to commit to a slam, just in case for ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: instance they didn't have adequate trumps|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Jxxx clubs prevents this from easily making 7|pg||

nt|leo lasota: knocking out dummy's last entry..|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: if you draw trumps you don't have a dummy entry, but when you lead the @H10, east has a tricky decision |pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: you might have started with @HA10 doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: now the double squeeze is pretty much marked|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: cash @CK, ruff a heart, and then run the trumps|pg||
nt|athene: and whoever has the diamonds will have to unguard them|pg||
nt|athene: not actually a double squeeze as only one person can guard them but that is how you play it|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|athene: only @DA as an obvious loser, as you can throw a diamond on the @SK|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but if you draw trumps you only have 11 tricks with crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: i think north ought to be raising clubs if her partner can bid them twice|pg||
nt|baardolav: Too conservative not double... I think. you pay 590 one out of 7 times but that is 4 imps only...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 3H would have made life a little more difficult on N, but likely they would still end up in 4S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: yes, opposite vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt scramble now, perhaps|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW were thoroughly preempted out|pg||
nt|psyck: made it difficult for EW to enter at this vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: is 2 @D GF?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2NT was not self alerted, so Kasle will take back the Pass|pg||
nt|psyck: N passed other room & EW got to 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  not a good start for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 450 modest consolation|pg||
nt|sybarra: or check back of some sort?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: South says, well at least I have 4 spades and a doubleton for you partner!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kingcur: think so|pg||
nt|kemperg: GF chackback I think|pg||
nt|kingcur: 3@S slow arrival now, S having too much for a direct 4@S|pg||
nt|leo lasota: interesting decision for peter here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: on club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: maybe a diamond lead would give problems|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead would certainly cause problems, but the club looks normal to me|pg||
nt|athene: even after a club lead, the defence might have a chance - suppose declarer wins the jack and returns a club; north can win and shift to a diamond now|pg||
nt|ady: even a club lead  may nopt make    diamond switch later may be ok for defence|pg||
nt|danilo1: small @D now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: here come the cues |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: NS play a strong club system, i am guessing over 1@S a bid of 2@C is their only game force|pg||
nt|athene: after a club lead declarer can go for hearts immediately of course, but that looks risky with just a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: well when you only go for 500 with that dummy, i don't think you can be accused of rash bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: but it still costs an imp |pg||
nt|athene: maybe west comes under pressure, having to guard both majors, and you can ruff the @HK or @S10 good|pg||
nt|gsper:  A D by E risked 4 or 5@C from partner|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D was obviously something weird - maybe showed just a minimum hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota: should win with jack and lead trump towards hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota: as this certainly looks like singleton|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, have to get @h right to make now|pg||
nt|leo lasota: plus trumps not likely 4 in the south hand as north cannot hold two singletons|pg||
nt|santyclz: I could find a way to go down on this...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: jack clubs and trump towards king, then run 9 hearts back if south ducks|pg||
nt|leo lasota: this is near certain to hold losers to 2 trumps max and a spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this lead stops 6|pg||
nt|runnerup:  under 6 @c you can stay with good justment|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cant|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: ý have no idea about website|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: if declarer plays hearts early   should make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know if NS's agreement is that 2nt here is lebensohl or a scramble|pg||
nt|sybarra: not 4 @H?   |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Katz: "got any cards?" Alioto: "I'm 4333 with 13"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: south is liking his chances|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Alioto: "you starting to get the idea that I had a good hand?"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: in italy most doubles suggest a desire to compete further, even after the fit has been found|pg||
nt|tez: 2 nt neymiþ ümit?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@S the end?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: interesting that north does not unblock - you would think he would, as then either defender can win the third heart if need be|pg||
nt|athene: but even if you play it as scramble you can use it, like this, to show a weak 3@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: (direct 3@H bid is stronger)|pg||
nt|athene: of course if that is what the double meant then it is easy for south to bid on|pg||
nt|kingcur: 3NT could be non-serious: a hand that has no slam interest unless S is big|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: 2nt 3 lü h tutusu|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|athene: one possibility is to run the spades first - that often makes life hard for the defenders|pg||
nt|sharkey: He has to play on @H I think|pg||
nt|athene: i think versace might get trump squeezed|pg||
nt|danilo1: wd|pg||
nt|leo lasota: uh oh|pg||
nt|psyck: now will need @h fin after @c ruff|pg||
nt|leo lasota: very surprised at the line taken by peter here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: again, the question to consider is how likely will the trumps split 41 or 50 after 9 clubs lead?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|MolvaM: güneydeki oyuncu bu durumda mutlu olmalý sanýrým|pg||
nt|kemperg: and 4@S emphasises that|pg||
nt|kingcur: S would have become more enthusiastic perhaps if N had not shown @D cue|pg||
nt|sybarra: this must be there form of cue bids |pg||
nt|kemperg: for S @SQ instead of @HQ is enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why ace of @H not shown|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe N showed it |pg||
nt|kingcur: so, would we leave it @@4@S with this S hand?|pg||
nt|kemperg: would deny @D controle|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a 4 @C, last train, cue for hts?|pg||
nt|kingcur: I think I would|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: the trouble is, it might make things hard for you too - you have to find a couple of discards, and you also lose your dummy entries|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Will be 2 or 3 down now - good defence|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: if this holds the trick, what does declarer do next?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume play @C to the A and @C up.  @D A has to be in front|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is fairly sure now that north has the @HA, which makes it safer to play another heart, as north is probably not going to be the one with long hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no way the defence can set themselves up some long hearts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Pity on the nice defense to miss the second ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now heart best|pg||
nt|nilsland:  up to now ;)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kingcur: if 3NT would show a non-serious hand ánd S has bid a last-train 4@H that got no positive response, then I think 6@S can never be good|pg||
nt|sybarra: so the cues seemed to all be "last train" type |pg||
nt|leo lasota: possible south holds trump stack if north has elected to lead 9 clubs from 98x, but extremely unlikely|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: north obviously worried about the weak opening|pg||
nt|athene: but as a dummy for clubs it is pretty good really|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|leo lasota: potential for huge gain for cappelli now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: @HJ suit-preference for diamonds over clubs of course|pg||
nt|danilo1: I do not disagree with @S back by Fantoni ... attacking options since declarer still fears @D overruffs|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

mb|1N|nt|hedyg:  UNDO ??|pg||
nt|leo lasota: something to observe kibitzers|pg||
nt|leo lasota: declarer was joking with dummy about what cards would be seen in the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@C acceptable for me|pg||
nt|athene: versace seems to be in notrump mode :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no 2@S from south does seem very cautious|pg||
nt|psridhar:  1s-2d-3c-depends on what N will do -raise to 4c or 3nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: S knew pard would bid hts! |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Great result for Zaleski in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: decent EW slam, until you look at the NS cards|pg||

nt|queequeg: Angelini 74           Zaleski 62 |pg||
nt|sybarra: (or at least my pards always do) |pg||
nt|kingcur: playing the hand exactly like Lauria did, incidentally. And he probably was regretting not being in slam until that 2nd @D was ruffed by N|pg||
nt|leo lasota: at unfav, many would not elect to open 3H in 3rd chair there, but again it follows robinson/boyd's aggressive style|pg||
nt|leo lasota: south may choose 4H as choice of games with 4 spades, longer minor?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: this took away some of the focus, and the result was not pretty|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Peter and Steve may be happy, but they aren't showing it at all - their aspect at the table is completely unchanged.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Steve asks about Smith echo - "reverse"|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobholl: s can see no penalty pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: W not doubling opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: in the pseudo-slam zone again|pg||
nt|sharkey: Well - if N won't bid his suit....|pg||
nt|athene: many would bid 1nt with south here but of course that should be a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT=0-9|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @h looks good contract -but @h 4-1 and no chance|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive north will bid 3nt and south 4c|pg||
nt|kemperg: not 3N|pg||
nt|psyck: I wonder if 2@s just shows @s's or @d fit jump as well|pg||
nt|psyck: some play double of 1@h as @s suit with @d tolerance|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: 1@S is forcing for one round, usually 15+ points|pg||

nt|psridhar:  stiff @s + AK in 4th suit + a decent @d suit =all favour 4@c well judged|pg||
nt|baardolav: 4c should make the way more easaly?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: of course jan; well established pair; steve is in the HOF, peter has been a nominee for the HOF; they keep their focus and energy where it needs to be|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: and they're not going to waste energy worrying about whether the last hand could have been made|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: a natural 4!NT by west would be nice now|pg||
nt|ady: another chance|pg||
nt|athene: it seems that both NS pairs allowed the double of 1@H to talk them out of spades, to an extent|pg||
nt|ady: North seems to have trapped himself not entering the bidding first round|pg||
nt|jaapfr: looks wise to me to bid a modest 2@D as W|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|leo lasota: they do not need to; they both know|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: if 1@S was arfiticial (2@S instead with 4 spades) then 4nt is logically natural, no agreed suit|pg||

nt|kemperg: 4@S, cue, no @D and @H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: stayed low|pg||
nt|gsper:  No, sorry|pg||
nt|psridhar:  tough for Kokten now-pd can hold AKQXXX,X,X,KJ10XX|pg||
nt|leo lasota: while north holds 19, he does not want to risk going minus opposite passed hand partner, so makes wise choice of 4S|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: a push   |pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib suggests 2@S preempt after TO x - to risky in my view as West likely to have @S virw x|pg||
nt|athene: duck in dummy best shot to build a heart, playing west for @HQ9xx or @HJ9xx|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@D 13+ hcp|pg||
nt|queequeg: 1nt= 10+, any|pg||

nt|MolvaM: gerçekten de batýnýn karosu tek olsaydý doðru karar olabilirdi ama bu elde sorun yok|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: not so clear - had to lose 2 trump and 1 club, order might not matter, since he can't pitch on the clubs until trumps are out|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobholl: Q@C|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d 13+ & 3N 33(34) 15-17   but my sys notes could be old|pg||
nt|gsper:  No 10+ balanced|pg||
nt|athene: north decided that on the bidding, south can't have more than two hearts, and therefore must have three spades :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: 3@s 6+S, denies 3+H|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni does not have that many extras now i think|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C-then-3@S shows good spades and about 18+ or so|pg||
nt|athene: but it seems he is giving this a bit of thought|pg||
nt|danilo1: 7@H board may even cost Championship|pg||
nt|psridhar:  now the key card resp will take them to slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: lead @C from Qxx|pg||
nt|leo lasota: now the defense cannot effectively attack hearts as declarer has the key 9 of hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: cards favorable in spite of 4-1 trump break|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkey: *view|pg||
nt|kingcur: a lot of @S losers to get rid of here|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: then how about 1 spade?|pg||
nt|sharkey: i agree with 1@S |pg||
nt|sharkey: But you probably wont bid game|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: i can hear the thunder now|pg||
nt|queequeg: yes you right :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5NT was 2 keycards and a void?|pg||
nt|psridhar:  somewhat enterprisiing auction , i cant see a scientific route to slam , may be a relay system, but wd in the end NS|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec confirms|pg||
pc|h5|nt|runnerup:  yes 2 @s is a clear bid -4 @s is -i cant say aloud --and 4 @h was overboard all ready|pg||
nt|kingcur: but having escaped a trump lead gives best prospects for S|pg||
nt|kemperg: no defense left|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I want to lead trump from qxx |pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, impossible trump lead|pg||
nt|kingcur: I must admit I wouldn't even have considered leading trumps here with that holding...but it would have been the only way to beat this contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: me neither, and also the Italians did not:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does it really beat it? |pg||
nt|kingcur: specs pointing out there is a Bols tip telling me that I should have :)|pg||
nt|adonis18:  no, twi sp losers then and no trump loser|pg||
nt|kemperg: think so, 2nd trump after @SQ|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3 @S losers|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: but south "bent" a 1nt call on board 1, 3, and 4|pg||
nt|athene: north must have noticed that|pg||
nt|kemperg: quick claim|pg||
nt|psyck: can make rest of the tricks here if he gets it rite with 5@s's, 1@h, 3@d, 3@c|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: i suppose you might misguess spades twice, leading to the 8 then the jack?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: if def pkays 2 trumps, dec only has 2@d & 8 @c tricks|pg||
nt|kingcur: trump lead means no trump trick for defense, but W can lead a 2nd trump when in with @SQ...then no way to make, I think|pg||
nt|adonis18:  sorry, 3 sp losers:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice hand for a quiz, what would you lead|pg||

nt|kingcur: and maybe should have previous trick?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kemperg: why wait with @DA?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: the opening 3@C is a matter of style - the two aces and only a 6-card suit are negative factors, but you argue against that |pg||

nt|athene: i suppose south thought he had a few extras for his 2@H bid - well maybe he has an extra jack or two|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y -2 more nlikely|pg||
nt|leo lasota: south has to hope north holds the jack hearts to hold this to 5!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kingcur: this might have been down on @SQ lead, I am told. It would force declarer to be in dummy before @C's are set up|pg||

nt|athene: was it possible south could have three diamonds though?|pg||
nt|athene: could he be 4-3-3-3 on that bidding?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand looks very interesting, two slams beaten by bad breaks|pg||
nt|athene: north might get endplayed in 3@C, for example heart lead ruffed, draw trumps, then play a spade|pg||
nt|athene: north will have to lead a spade or diamond|pg||
nt|jaapfr: needs @C lead to beat 4@H and 4@S doomed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: kýsa bir ara verdi oyuncular simdi yeniden baslýyoruz|pg||
nt|leo lasota: ace spades and spade of course  created fear of letting north win queen and provide a spade ruff to south|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Boyd asked who had the @s Q and then commented "probably make 4 from your side"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: hopefully that's spades and a minor. If it's just spades.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@s would be a weak two in spades |pg||
nt|leo lasota: likely 650 here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: i dont believe this bidding|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|athene: east really bid 2@D? is this a 2-way bid, maybe weak spade raise or some strong options?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yy 5@H does make with @S @S lead kibs:)|pg||
nt|kingcur: any spade lead maybe even...which means this could cost: it's not the most unimaginable lead for E after all|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu  all later |pg||
nt|kingcur: thx Shirley :)|pg||
nt|psyck: thx Shirley|pg||
nt|leo lasota: promising when one picks up balance 15 count, until they open str nt in front of you|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Boyd just checked the clock to make sure they weren't behind :). There are some other players who could learn from that. |pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: bye Shirley|pg||
nt|leo lasota: dbl-p-3h-p-4h|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe a better plan was to cash the @DA at trick 2, then return the heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice to see that even Fantunes can err occasionally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner started with @DKx he can cash the @DK before giving you the heart ruff, and you can give him a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no need to underlead your @DA trying to pick up @DQxx with declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt =dd and down in practive if no helping bids in defence (like here) perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so we see lauria's opinion of the tricky bidding problem for balanced 24 count after 3@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: might very well get the clubs right - we shall see|pg||
nt|athene: he doubled and basically forced to 6@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lucky 6 @s for bear card bid and made quite lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  25 to 7=32 now we surely will see a slam|pg||
nt|psridhar:  Facing a passed pd Aluf doesnt fancy 4@s and fancies defending 1N|pg||
nt|psridhar:  hence that pass of 1N|pg||
nt|kingcur: this looks like a Fantunes style of 2@H opener|pg||
nt|leo lasota: do you ever have 5 card support when your partner shows 4 Jan?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: West might have passed - six spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might deem it unsuitable for a weak two |pg||
nt|gsper:  E has a lot of cards but does not know where to go|pg||
nt|psyck: it would be a good idea for specs to discuss with their pd's what x would mean on 3NT last deal: lead @s, non-@s, or other maj...|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  And knows even less now|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would bid 3NT now and go down|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s maybe...|pg||
nt|athene: defence have to be slightly careful here to cash out the diamonds and not for example try to cash two hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: the systematic 2@D bid did S pass else he could bid and NS in a @H contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: clever action|pg||
nt|psyck: now @d goes away|pg||
nt|psyck: @d lead should beat i suppose|pg||
nt|kingcur: @C lead too?|pg||
nt|psyck: well if he ducks & they play @d....|pg||
nt|psyck: else winning & playing @s will make|pg||
nt|kingcur: @CA and a spade probably, but no entry to enjoy the discard I think|pg||
nt|psyck: 4th seat 2 level bids generally show such hands|pg||
nt|psyck: as kibs point, will need to unblock @s Q & fin due to entry probs|pg||
nt|kingcur: that would be some play|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: south needs to find the killer diamond switch|pg||
nt|leo lasota: not easy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: But in case some of those other players weren't paying attention, the director announced 27 minutes left in the segemnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another failing 7 perhaps|pg||
nt|danilo1: hopefully only 6 this time :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We dont have any system notes. Has East showed @C+@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think so but just a guess|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: i am told, on the NS methods, if south WAS 4333, he would be 18-20, so that was out|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i never see in table any one to finess @c -not expected here |pg||
nt|athene: west tries to conceal the position in clubs|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2@H was natural or 22-24 bal|pg||
nt|psridhar:  if sittng birds are to be shot.....|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR is behind us, so no scores|pg||
nt|psridhar:  and rarely u get to shoot Lauria's contract !|pg||
nt|leo lasota: interesting hand for both the declarer and defense against 3nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: It has been corrected|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gsper:  Opposite an overcall, Hedy?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: 6 either major makes with spades friendly.|pg||
nt|athene: so the defence don't realise the urgency to cash out in diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: tough call but he may see there are no other chances|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good slam|pg||
nt|psridhar:  clever it may hv been but NS can make 2@s and the upshot could well be -2 imps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: kickard, love it|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose 6@H is a bit better than 6@S because you might make it even with a bad spade break, but it's hard to get out of a 4-4 fit once you lock into it|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play 9@H now only down chance |pg||
nt|psyck: wd|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nilsland:  sry 24+ bal|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@C looks like nat (@C support) and slam interest|pg||
nt|kingcur: 9 more to NS on  10, OR letting EW play in 2@S (down 2)|pg||
nt|kingcur: he did it, wd|pg||
nt|psyck: they really are FOXY|pg||
nt|kingcur: lol|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kareno: Yes, diamonds might produce an extra trick.|pg||
nt|athene: so the underlead looks like a definite slip|pg||
nt|psyck: well, i did guess E would bid @s, just misguessed the number|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|nilsland:  but I do not know more|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Your guesses is as good as mine (or better)|pg||
nt|danilo1: and 4NT is probably @D cue ...so Sementa asks for third round control in @H now I thk|pg||
nt|fabsayc: either way looks a shakey auction|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... but he may get third round @S control :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: and 7 more on  11, OR in 2@C|pg||
nt|psyck: certainly been earning their imps against such a strong team|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobholl: no @S Q so 6 only|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if 2@S is 5/5, he knows W has diamonds - straw in the wind perhaps|pg||
nt|bobholl: from N point of vieuw a singleton @H is only chance but lauria wouldn't have covered|pg||
nt|psridhar:  unless Aluf has guts to shift to @H|pg||
nt|leo lasota: ace draw 2 rds trumps|pg||
nt|leo lasota: when sees both follow, claims|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psridhar:  and not cash his pd's Ace|pg||

nt|MolvaM: bu arada geçen senenin þampiyonu Prusa-M takýmý B grubunda mücadele eder durumda|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kareno: 5@h may show two without trump queen.|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should have taken control with blackwood over 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: normally you don't want the limited hand as captain|pg||
nt|athene: east just wants to know if her partner has @SAQ, @HA, @DA - then 7 is good|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kareno: There's no safety play in the spade suit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@c - so old hat these days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that could be a very expensive @d7 discard|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: west can never know if 7 is good because he does not know his partner has six solid hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @S2 to K and club finesse?|pg||
nt|gsper:  The voice commentators are criticizing 3@H, a bit unfairly I think|pg||
nt|gsper:  Considering the alternatives|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Again|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... 5NT is not the luckiest bid for EW|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Later today there will be some systemic discussion - in Italian....|pg||
nt|psridhar:  udca?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|gsper:  3@H is not good, but what else is?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: some specs are suggesting that if west wants to give the impression he has no club honour in hand, the jack was a better card to play|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: that is usually what you would do, sure, but if you had a singleton club in hand you might try the king|pg||
nt|kingcur: this is quite a strong performance by the Fox Tam|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kingcur: team*|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

nt|athene: no support doubles for EW |pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|runnerup:  are we aware about situation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe one too many grappas at dinner|pg||
nt|runnerup:  maybe west bid 2 @s -yes looks better|pg||
nt|psridhar:  no?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: many players use 2S, 2nt, and 3C by the opener after 1nt-2D transfer as showing a maximum (good 16 or 17 HCP) with a useful dblton|pg||
nt|leo lasota: useful defined as xx or Ax|pg||
nt|leo lasota: so North would have bid 3C here if they played that, and South would know KJ10 of clubs is not a great holding opposite the useful dblton|pg||
nt|leo lasota: :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: will south get overly happy when he hears the 4D splinter?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: east must have thought 2@S was a relay and west thought it was natural by a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: now north may know his opponents have had a misunderstanding but he still has to judge whether to double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h=10-13, 5+@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: weird|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok --nonsence|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, E's hand could play very well opp fitting hands|pg||
nt|gsper:  3@C may be singleton ask|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, next round in 55 min.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think double is right|pg||
nt|gsper:  What on Earth is going on here?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: perfect example of a hand where showing the useful dblton helps responder to accurately gauge the slam potential|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if they wake up and bid a cold 4@S you just hope that your teammate are in it anyway|pg||
nt|athene: now south might discover a diamond suit tucked away there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cc says 2@s=realy, but maybe that doesn't apply by a passed hand  |pg||
nt|athene: if partner asks you for non-spade suits and you have seven in one of them, you might want to bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s presumably some sort of fit-jump|pg||
nt|psyck: are we looking at the same boards :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  It is suggested that thay are playing board 29|pg||
nt|hedyg:  UNDO ?|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe the bidding is for board 29|pg||
nt|tez: 5@s kontrlu yaparlarsa Akgül takýmý sayý kazanýr|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south is thinking how bad a dummy for diamonds his partner might put down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h-3@h might have bought it|pg||
nt|athene: i guess something like 2-4-3-4 shape is possible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: something maybe not quite right here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is not gonna make :) .heh heh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think W playing 3@d on a 3-2 fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a bright kib said better W bidding 2@H and then 3@H (for the ones who see 3@H as 5/5m)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't know what 3@C means but i have no doubt they will bid 6@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: my guess is 3@H no major 4@D is choose anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@C asking, 3@H no major, 4@D both majors (55)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|leo lasota: So again, all of opener's bids after 1nt-2d transfer available would be: 2S = max, useful dblton spade, 2nt = max, useful dblton diamond, 3c = max, useful dblton club, 3D = max ...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: with aces, 3H = "suitable min" meaning decent 15 or ave 16 with 4 trumps|pg||
nt|leo lasota: surprised south not dbl here wow|pg||
nt|leo lasota: no way is north to find the diamond lead on this auction!|pg||
nt|psyck: ah ha|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah!|pg||
nt|leo lasota: perhaps he leads diamond now :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: well decided by katz|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: double 3@C looks normal with west but this will work out fine anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that might provoke 5@d|pg||
nt|athene: might be a problem now if north passes after a looong think, and south finds 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
nt|gsper:  But even then 3@D is not obvious|pg||
nt|psyck: if so 3@d @c single (with 3@h @d single & 3@s @s single)?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Quite possibly|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead you might well need five diamond tricks so small to the queen is right, isn't it? gains against @DKx onside or @Dxx as here|pg||
nt|athene: @DKx or @DKxx|pg||
nt|ritong: down two, seems|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: have to give you something to talk about :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: I've been working on getting enough operators and computers to cover the Onstott match as well as these two for the final segment, if it's still close, so wasn't paying attention :)...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: many options here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: dramatic, but effective choice is overtake king diamonds, lead jack|pg||
nt|leo lasota: since entries are quite scarce and peter has likely led from shortness, this would appear to be the correct % play|pg||
nt|leo lasota: another option that would work is to lead low spade off the board and play for 6 trumps, 2 clubs, 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|leo lasota: kasle back ahead by 2|pg||
nt|leo lasota: another outstanding result for kit/fred in open room on bd 88 going +100 against 3 hearts|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Jan, is there any time pressure?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Quite exhausting for whoever wins here to then have to play 2 rds tonight|pg||
mc|9|nt|mdgraham: even if North is known to have slow-passed, 5@d isn't unreasonable with 7411 shape|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually there are no pure penalty doubles, so was not 100% clear for south to pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: versace has a very good hand for slam in @H|pg||

nt|gsper:  Low from 6 to honour would not be Slawinski|pg||
nt|athene: madala cashing the @DA first in here was a good play that made it a lot easier for his partner|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y the crux was madala seeing that and playing @DA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could sementa have avoided this cash club queen and lead low heart|pg||

mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: i smell a 5@C overcall|pg||

mb|2S|nt|leo lasota: 4h would likely to go down 1 here after north leads a spade|pg||

nt|danilo1: 1@S overcall must be very limited|pg||
nt|ritong: with @s Kx, chance that pard has a penalty pass is slim|pg||
nt|leo lasota: west patterning out here showing 64+ shape, |pg||
nt|psyck: I think that is 1:50 EST & not 2:50|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Boyd confirms that Robinson also said 14+ with short spades and Robinson says yes|pg||

nt|leo lasota: unfortunately, peter had options after 2nt|pg||
