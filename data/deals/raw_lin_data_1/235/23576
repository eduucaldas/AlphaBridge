nt|athene: good low-hcp 3nt; 100% secure on any lead and any lie|pg||
nt|athene: yes it shows the power of a long suit with quick tricks outside|pg||
nt|athene: NS don't have a single point wasted in fact|pg||
nt|athene: maybe Duboin is wondering which major to lead?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time 4 @s is anly 300 but you lose in a long run if you bid those -because in all cases ns aren't aware what they do and 3nt can go down|pg||
nt|athene: yes i don't think EW can reasonably contemplate a sacrifice|pg||
nt|athene: -300 vs -400 is the best you can possibly hope for|pg||
nt|athene: and it might often be -300 or -500 against +50|pg||

nt|sharkey: Some may not bid 3@S with only 3 trumps so this could be IMPs to the Patane team|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sharkey: Some number of @D here...|pg||
nt|athene: west neither strong nor unbalanced enough for 2@C opener in first or second, but here the requirements are relaxed|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: some prefer to keep the 2-suited overcalls weak or very strong, so a 12 count might not qualify|pg||

nt|runnerup:  vulnerability is bad so north has about cards to expect by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|gsper:  So 4@S is a good save, but unlikely to be found now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no chance here of course|pg||

nt|nilsland:  It is easy when you see all the cards :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: a double for takeout by north if available would have worked well|pg||

nt|gsper:  N might have doubled 2@D, but with both opponents showing cards, and vul, it was not very attractive|pg||

nt|athene: even with this nice start, and trumps 3-3, declarer should be one down|pg||
nt|athene: east just holds up in spades and there is nowhere to put the @D109|pg||

nt|mdgraham: S might have tried 3@S, but 3@h feels like a definite statement |pg||

nt|bobholl: that's not a bad plan :)|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes that sort of thing is useful but here even if it worked, it would not help especially|pg||
nt|athene: even if clubs break you get 2 hearts, 4 clubs, spade...that's not 3NT by a fair way|pg||

nt|athene: in the bidding, a hidden issue is whether north's "double-then-3@H" route showed just any hand too strong for 2@H first time, or whether it does promise a flexible hand|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: over a normal weak-two opener by opponents, a jump overcall is strong e.g. (2@D) 3@H|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2@d probably 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|gsper:  1NT 12-14, often offshape|pg||
nt|athene: when south bids 3@H with only six he has to have some shape i think|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe declarer should have played for 4-1 spades, but not easy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where do i collect the 1085 cokes|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2x120 good start for both|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: maybe can block the diamonds and survive|pg||
mb|5C|nt|gsper:  Transfer, of course. E was doing the thinking|pg||
mb|6S|nt|fabsayc: i prefer 2@C for that purpose, as partner can bid 2@D with no preference|pg||
nt|athene: interesting, he doesn't go 4@H|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt ew here and if something /else ) happens -it is a suprice|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with opening 4@H is that if opps bid 4@S or 5@C over it, as they very likely will, you are left not knowing what to do|pg||
nt|athene: you would probably be tempted to bid 5@D as partner will never imagine what you have|pg||

nt|henryb:  I do not see how South can know what is useful and what is not.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: might have a club slam opposite suitable cards, but it's shooting for the moon a bit - 3NT is practical |pg||

nt|athene: and i can't believe angelini did either|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: maybe if the auction had tempoed out differently he would have bid - for example if west made some raise and then east bid 4@S and that was passed round to him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although if the @s10 forces the king the defence would need an immediate diamond switch|pg||
nt|athene: so losing one heart, one diamond, and one club|pg||
nt|danilo1: looks like -1|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: perhaps being NV was a factor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: let's hope we are guessing well|pg||

nt|kemperg: @H lead for 2 down, but now it has a chance|pg||

nt|leo lasota: I am sure N/S would gladly accept 3H to be played by Steve|pg||
nt|leo lasota: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: A little discussion of the bidding - Katz says his DBL showed a hand he would have made a takeout dbl of 1@s and Alioto's DBl tends to deny 4 hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: I guess N could double 3@d with a good(ish) hand |pg||
nt|athene: you might say "well, obviously north must be broke, after the opponents have both shown decent hands"|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will be a bit worried here; only 8 obvious tricks even with the club finesse working|pg||
nt|psyck: I like dbl of the options|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C just makes but 3@S could be for -500|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cc does not cover this auction, anybody know what 3@C is?|pg||

pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: not sure about this - 2@c may be Gazzilli |pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS are too balanced, but it's hard for either side to realise this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kibitzers (some of them) say 3@C asks for 4 card major or 5 card minor, 3d denies|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not many pairs include 5-card majors in the weak NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since i got at least 4 versions i am more confused than before :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  maybe the have no choice with less than 14 pts|pg||
nt|baardolav: A endplay in @d / @h probably?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bobholl: @c queen is a nice card but not shown|pg||
nt|athene: well, no 4@C, so madala knows they are off the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: they'll play six, though, i would think|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2NT said he liked clubs|pg||
nt|leo lasota: defense to set this one trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Katz asks about lead - in this situation, the K is standard (would be led from AK or KQ)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2s, 1 diamond, 2 clubs as peter has the key 10 of clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Welcome Leo and Joe |pg||
pc|sA|nt|jaapfr: 5@D might make|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have a great hand for clubs in that context|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: oh well :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@h not very good needs @C 32 and king rigth most times|pg||
nt|athene: but the point is, if you work out what partner has by trusting your opponents, then you get talked out of games when west has psyched the redouble|pg||
nt|psyck: beautiful venue indeed|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: but the spades are blocked so he can play on diamonds successfully|pg||
nt|athene: i think if 5@C was there, west would have bid it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: did E se 4@C as foricng?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: need to be cautious    even 5 level could be too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nobody ever won at bridge by trusting the opponents|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't think Sementa would compete to 3 level with a 4333 hand, but it works fine here|pg||
nt|baardolav: he can raise the diamonds yes... because versace do now have any spades left|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Hello Jan, Joe and hello to all kibitzers|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unless Katz can get the 4th @c established in time for a @D pitch.  @d shift needed now.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: so having agreements with partner is a better way to go, what with him being on your side|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most of the time.....|pg||
nt|athene: south can see declarer is all set to throw hearts on spades, so might as well attack hearts now?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C obviously something showing a good hand, maybe showing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on;y blocked if he wins this :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing king looks the odds play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
nt|athene: lead was @S9 showing bad suit|pg||

nt|athene: *if trumps AND clubs are 3-2|pg||
nt|athene: because you can cash clubs and get the heart through as well|pg||
nt|athene: partner having the @HK is not in itself enough; even if you cash some hearts, declarer can throw enough clubs on spades|pg||

nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to ruff a club and pick up trumps, losing just one spade, two diamonds and the @CA|pg||
nt|psyck: to prevent losing 2 trump tricks via @c ruff on a bad day...|pg||
nt|athene: well 3@S can be beaten with diamond ruff and then club shift i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't draw trumps and then get back to dummy fast to throw his club losers on the two good diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: neither do I but else why E bids 5@C:)|pg||
nt|tez: biraz az ama mantýklý 3 nt idi|pg||
nt|kingcur: To break the silence somewhat here, I have volunteered to comment|pg||
nt|kingcur: ah, hello Germ|pg||
nt|leo lasota: robinson will balance with a "robinson/woolsey" dbl to show 4 card major and longer minor if bidding begins P-P-1nt-P-P-|pg||
nt|santyclz: I wonder if the E hand has become an opener.  (Yet?)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  making n/s   but an excellent save for e/w in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know the intricacies of the NS methods but i suspect 2nt showed extras|pg||
nt|athene: but if west led a spade, east could win the @CA and return a diamond and then throw two clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer could never get to dummy as east could overruff with the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, all irrelevant anyway|pg||
nt|athene: or just a club lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5 @c ok -here -4 @h makes ..so |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok, essentially 3@C was modified puppet stayman|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Cor|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: think 3@S max|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some 9 in @h ew if opened and will |pg||
nt|athene: 5@D might come home but 4@C tick would have been a reasonable place to stop i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not sure e/w will be able to enter the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if north bid only 2@S and east doubled, that would find the club fit, but that is surely the only way|pg||
nt|athene: and i think north will bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  4 losers in spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: But NS likely will end up in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: the only way 4@S makes is if the defence don't attack diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to bid it - S will decline any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: but that's not happening|pg||
nt|athene: i think north just bids 3@S here and they play there|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree William|pg||
nt|ady: will east enter if north raises to 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@C also possibility - Splinter|pg||
nt|athene: i would probably double 2@S with the east cards|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@C NOT precision style, though it looks that way|pg||
nt|psyck: Right Bill, which is why I guess Markku said better chances played by N|pg||
nt|athene: double fit might come to light here|pg||
nt|tez: 2@h @h ve minör|pg||
nt|tez: dbl ceza deðil ve puan var|pg||
mb|p|mb|d!|an|4 card M, longer minor or 1 minor|nt|athene: now a support double for spades i guess, so they find their 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sing @s makes it ofcause dangerous to open 4. hand|pg||
nt|athene: well sort of double fit :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  mainly that and west will lead @h Q --normally -@c lead only after peeping|pg||
nt|athene: many would just raise clubs with east, but sementa obviously feels that with opps bidding hearts, it is worth a lot for your side to find spades, rather than clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: It was in other room|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter will ask for the major|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: south will have trouble showing hand now|pg||
mb|2D!|an|asks Major|nt|sharkey: N has a shortage of points but great playing strength when pd bid @S|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt was a spade raise you would think south would bid a discouraging 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will pay to stop low here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like a direct 3@D invite, although the bid has several flaws|pg||
nt|psyck: 2C = 10-13 value, 5C-4other unbalanced, or 6+C|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@D relay asking for 3-card major|pg||
nt|psyck: N's hand becomes powerful with Aces in pd's suit now|pg||
nt|athene: angelini can't bid less than game now, can he? ace in both partner's suits for a single raise|pg||
nt|athene: transfer responses, so 1@S shows diamonds|pg||
nt|kingcur: a weird deal, that previous one. points 20-20 but with extremely favourable lie of the cards for NS|pg||
nt|psyck: a Woolsey style X|pg||
nt|leo lasota: as passed hand, the balancing dbl is almost always on tehj 4 card maj,. longer min|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  3. hands pass -was a view =suprice also|pg||
nt|kemperg: good 5@D rescue, red against green:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gsper:  2NT relay again|pg||
nt|athene: ok, apparently he can|pg||
nt|athene: east might balance now with a double|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last makeble bid NS 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think support doubles are not as popular in italy as in america, but still if you double 1@H with 4+ spades here you surely need them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could have responded 2@d, perhaps, but that may be FG, and S isn't quite strong enough for that (non strong-club opener)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry but don't have a CC for NS|pg||
nt|kingcur: so 4@H would have been two off, and 5@C was on ice|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec saw down possibility|pg||
nt|kingcur: except for 3 rounds of hearts, uppercutting West's trump J|pg||
nt|psyck: 3rd @h?|pg||
nt|kemperg: welcome Krishna|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: still will easy enough for defence to collect their 4 winners  |pg||
nt|athene: ok, the fifth spade is nice, and QJ doubleton is much better when partner opens the suit, but even so...|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i'm told 2NT is 6-4|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tactical 3 @h to play in 4 ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and EW just make 2@S imo|pg||
nt|kingcur: hi Krishna :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ah a spec suggests north is "she" - i was assuming a different angelini haha|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 now -but ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: everyone has shown his hand fairly, except N who should have bid stronger|pg||
nt|athene: i don't understand why west bids spades rather than hearts, but it sure worked out|pg||
nt|psyck: this should come home on the 33 @c's|pg||
nt|leo lasota: no effective defense to set this; cards very favorable for robinson|pg||
nt|santyclz: The Kaplan and Ruben Hand evaluator rates the e hand at 14.00 points.  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=a1095+8+876+aq1082|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: so 3@H was just attempting to sign off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT is FG|pg||
nt|athene: even if 2@D response were not GF you might bid a spade anyway so as not to lose the suit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2000 |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h showed 3-4 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d showed 1345|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought the redouble might give EW a better chance to find the right major, if west could pass and let east bid spades|pg||
pc|d5|nt|runnerup:  200 -500 with x|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks too aggressive|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so north was weaker than i would have been |pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: very complicated hand, but at least the lead reveals south has no natural lead|pg||
nt|athene: you feel silly here if you try the jack and then south has a singleton queen|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2 diamonds, 1 of everything else for the defense|pg||
nt|psyck: Aces, all values in long suits which have intermediary cards, extra shape, etc...|pg||

nt|athene: getting to a nice safe 3@D partscore is not trivial really|pg||
nt|athene: also i have no idea what the redouble is all about :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: some specs would|pg||
nt|baardolav: maybe 4@d from north... south could bid 5@d for making, and find a good save for one down|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobholl: made now no problem|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless your playing flattery|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: but then north feels that facing any sort of heart fit it is worth a shot at game|pg||
nt|athene: run all the diamonds looks reasonable|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so if you pass 3. hand -why bid again ..ofcause souths 2 @s was aggressive also|pg||
nt|psyck: they have some defense, may not be all that clear to bid 5@c, though it is very likely they will bid it as insurance at this vul|pg||
nt|jaapfr: XX and 3@C and 3@D do mean: pls opps go to an unmakebele level:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now semanta must guess spade finesse or more diamonds|pg||
nt|danilo1: next "easy" 3NT ... but with @H wide opened ... after testing @C 3-3 (ending in dummy) ... Sementa may see better chance in @S finess than the risk to loose 3 @D tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he will get it right|pg||
pc|d9|nt|runnerup:   at least you get + score there -2 aces -and|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what north was worried about - pushing opps into 5@C making - but that is not a big danger when you have two aces and partner opened|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though west bid 2@S because he assumed opps would compete further and then he could show hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: it would come to around 28 Zar for those who use it (26 minimum to open)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|runnerup:  norths|pg||
nt|athene: but why is he so anxious to bid 3 over 3?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as you said earlier about 2@S bid|pg||
nt|athene: partner doubled 2@D so you push them up to 3@D and beat them|pg||

nt|psyck: what is your choice of opening here?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: many would choose to open the east hand 2H here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: west might go very quietly here, given the vulnerability here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT=20-21|pg||
nt|jaapfr: easy 4@S|pg||

mb|2C|nt|runnerup:  if you are afread of oppenents to make 5 -level with those cards after partner opens and invites -youll never can bid any games |pg||

nt|leo lasota: but peter/steev known to open aggressively, nearky all 11 counts at the 1 level|pg||

nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|athene: perfect mesh here - singleton facing four small - let's see if they can identify it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to locate @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows some sort of good raise and *south* shows extras and a heart singleton, that will certainly do it|pg||
nt|athene: well, with a ten-card fit you don't usually count the queen of trumps as a problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT 12-14; not 5/4 majors or 4441|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D looking for a 5-3 spade fit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, CC not clear about 3@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3M would be a singleton or void|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead runs to the jack, and declarer will duck a club to north to protect the @SKx i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: if east is thinking this long he must have forgotten the system :)|pg||
nt|athene: wake up, fantoni!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, misread the CC. 1NT can include a 4441 shape.|pg||
nt|athene: EW's 1nt has to cover a lot of hands unsuitable for other bids, sort of like a precision 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: their 1-bids are 14+ points and their 2-bids are unbalanced so the weak notrump has to work hard for its living|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, lots of people; no idea about 3@d|pg||
nt|nilsland:  As often - when you take nine you get ten.|pg||
nt|psyck: deal 4, if declarer had 2@s, & 4@d & @cAQJ... 3rd @h could have sold the contract, so was not easy...|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, 2@d instead of 2@c would not be nice at all :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but he wisely elected not to bid 2D as this would not allow for accurate description of his hand with 5 small diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 4@D will only encourage camberos|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@C is ok, as long as partner doesn't think you have to have diamonds for it|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@H     but n/s may play 4@S   for -500|pg||
nt|gsper:  Par seems to be 6@DX|pg||
nt|psyck: only 2 red aces to lose in a @h contract|pg||
nt|psyck: since on @c lead, you can discard on @s & W cannot ruff profitably|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@H wins on @C lead aswell.|pg||
nt|gsper:  N probably has more defense than partner expects|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: EW might have 4@D, at this rate|pg||
nt|athene: obviously east thinks 4@D is forcing, though, which suggests he thinks it is a "new suit" i.e. 2@C does not guarantee any diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: but how to show it now (gazilli ?)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards lie remarkably badly |pg||

nt|leo lasota: peter/steve do not make fast arrivals usually with 3+ controls|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: i assume the pause there was west thinking, not south|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C natural or various strong hands; 2@S less than 8 points|pg||
nt|athene: you might just bid 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|psyck: non vul, @h sequence, some shape & values on the side, a clear 3@h bid|pg||
nt|athene: no problem in 6@S of course with the miracle diamond lie so the 7 is good|pg||
nt|runnerup:  also in 5 . board 5 @c X -100 like expected -over 4 @h  =6 imps|pg||

nt|athene: and south got mildly interested|pg||
nt|tez: normal 1 batýþ|pg||
nt|leo lasota: peter can now pinpoint huis hand showing 3 keycards plus void|pg||
nt|leo lasota: since void would be known to steve as diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well as i said it is difficult - you might just bid 3nt |pg||
nt|psyck: same i suppose dbl planning 3N on 3M|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but if partner bid lets say 4 @c ?|pg||
nt|athene: you might double but that will often just give you a hard problem later on|pg||
mb|4N!|an|0/3|nt|jaapfr: 4nt with @D lead can create big problems so better 5@C for NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: one can not develop both majors with @D lead so if @D lead doomed|pg||
nt|psyck: unless he playes 2@s for a pitch immed which is not going to hap[pen|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but peter elects to just show the 3 keycards|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok i'm told 3@D was a 5-card minor, 3@H asked, 3@S showed clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently 3@H was equivalent of jump after 2@D response|pg||
nt|tez: küçük @h|pg||
nt|tez: @s ten batmasý zor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu formatta oynanan turnuvada B grubuna düþmek, damdan düþmekten daha kötüdür|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu maça baþlamadan önceki sýralama http://clubs.vugraph.com/tbricfed/teams_round.php?round=4765|pg||
nt|psyck: as he has late entries to dummy for that|pg||
nt|kemperg: in trouble now|pg||
mb|6H|nt|jaapfr: i really miss why to lead @H as W|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with a less solid suit he would pass or double|pg||
nt|danilo1: opps, Danger now ... guess Toni bid too much with 5NT |pg||
nt|sybarra: he can not pitch the 4 of  @H |pg||
nt|psyck: these was no harm in trying J 1st round, he could always enter dummy with @c ruff or something|pg||
nt|sybarra: yet |pg||
nt|kemperg: and cannot ruff it|pg||
nt|psyck: @hJ...|pg||
nt|psyck: @dJ i meant|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are, he needs his ruff, so cannot afford to lose trump now|pg||
nt|psyck: *ruffs|pg||
nt|kemperg: not enough entries|pg||
nt|sybarra: was there a good reason not to go in with J of @D?|pg||
nt|psyck: he can play @hA now & start ruffing, he can ruff 2nd @s high later|pg||
nt|psyck: that would take care of entry problems for ruffs|pg||
nt|kemperg: might play for @S 33|pg||
nt|psyck: if he lets it run, then down on 2nd trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: endplay coming up....draw trumps in 2, ruff the spade, exit diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Therefore the double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but this looks like one too many cue bids to me|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Have East denied @DK?|pg||
nt|danilo1: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Lauria will lead a trump back |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Should make now|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@s even with void & highr odd with void maybe|pg||
nt|leo lasota: surprised peter did not choose 5S|pg||
nt|leo lasota: steps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: Can duck this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Probably didn't want to commit to slam|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 4nt = 0/3; 5C = 1/4; 5D = 2/5 without q; 5H = 2/5 with q; 5S  = 0/3 w/ void, 5nt = 1/4  with void, 6C = 2w/void/ withouit q |pg||
nt|psyck: yes it looked like an ideal hand to show void, especially as Steve did not give him a chance to xx by passing 4@d-x|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: yes, duck this looks simplest, then just draw trumps|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need to guess the hearts or anything|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West did not think so|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: 4@Sx by north in open room|pg||
nt|psridhar:  Versace possibly judged it wd be -1 at most , no x|pg||
nt|psyck: nice, he may make now|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok here we go |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: It's also not 100% that his shortness is known and those steps for void can only apply if shortness is known|pg||
nt|leo lasota: agreed jan|pg||
nt|psyck: oh ok, so they show void also in rkc fashion, on 4N rkc, 5N as even with void & 6any as odd with void is commonly used...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: auction certainly strongly suggested diamond void as he cue bid, they overcalled 2D and dbled 4D...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: But I think he probably didn't show the void because he'd already shown a slammish hand and in the context of the auction he didn't want to commit to a slam, just in case for ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: instance they didn't have adequate trumps|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Jxxx clubs prevents this from easily making 7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: It's always a bad feeling when you find out you can't make a slam but are above 5 of your suit :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: lol|pg||
nt|leo lasota: unless of course jan opponents "save" for you :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: if you draw trumps you don't have a dummy entry, but when you lead the @H10, east has a tricky decision |pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: you might have started with @HA10 doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: now the double squeeze is pretty much marked|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: cash @CK, ruff a heart, and then run the trumps|pg||
nt|athene: and whoever has the diamonds will have to unguard them|pg||
nt|athene: not actually a double squeeze as only one person can guard them but that is how you play it|pg||
nt|psyck: well we don't get dealt such 24 everyday, so i don't like to just bid 3N, I will x & take my medicine on pd's rebid|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south has 3 @h normally|pg||

nt|danilo1: after Giorgio bid 4@H on 4@C ... maximum Sementa should make was ... one more bid = correct 5@D ... and after 5@S - just 6@H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: agree|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|athene: wondering whether to overtake and lead a club up|pg||
nt|athene: if you play low here and then another heart, east has to win and play a small diamond to give you a problem|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sanki yapar gibi idi ama batara gelmiþ|pg||

mb|3H|nt|athene: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|athene: only @DA as an obvious loser, as you can throw a diamond on the @SK|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but if you draw trumps you only have 11 tricks with crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: i think north ought to be raising clubs if her partner can bid them twice|pg||
nt|baardolav: Too conservative not double... I think. you pay 590 one out of 7 times but that is 4 imps only...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: yes, opposite vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt scramble now, perhaps|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW were thoroughly preempted out|pg||
nt|psyck: made it difficult for EW to enter at this vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: is 2 @D GF?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2NT was not self alerted, so Kasle will take back the Pass|pg||
nt|psyck: N passed other room & EW got to 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  not a good start for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 450 modest consolation|pg||
nt|sybarra: or check back of some sort?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: think so|pg||
nt|kemperg: GF chackback I think|pg||
nt|kingcur: 3@S slow arrival now, S having too much for a direct 4@S|pg||
nt|leo lasota: interesting decision for peter here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: on club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: maybe a diamond lead would give problems|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead would certainly cause problems, but the club looks normal to me|pg||
nt|athene: even after a club lead, the defence might have a chance - suppose declarer wins the jack and returns a club; north can win and shift to a diamond now|pg||
nt|ady: even a club lead  may nopt make    diamond switch later may be ok for defence|pg||
nt|danilo1: small @D now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: here come the cues |pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: NS play a strong club system, i am guessing over 1@S a bid of 2@C is their only game force|pg||
nt|athene: after a club lead declarer can go for hearts immediately of course, but that looks risky with just a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: well when you only go for 500 with that dummy, i don't think you can be accused of rash bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: but it still costs an imp |pg||
nt|athene: maybe west comes under pressure, having to guard both majors, and you can ruff the @HK or @S10 good|pg||
nt|gsper:  A D by E risked 4 or 5@C from partner|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D was obviously something weird - maybe showed just a minimum hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota: should win with jack and lead trump towards hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota: as this certainly looks like singleton|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, have to get @h right to make now|pg||
nt|leo lasota: plus trumps not likely 4 in the south hand as north cannot hold two singletons|pg||
nt|santyclz: I could find a way to go down on this...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: jack clubs and trump towards king, then run 9 hearts back if south ducks|pg||
nt|leo lasota: this is near certain to hold losers to 2 trumps max and a spade|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: this lead stops 6|pg||
nt|runnerup:  under 6 @c you can stay with good justment|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cant|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: ý have no idea about website|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: if declarer plays hearts early   should make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know if NS's agreement is that 2nt here is lebensohl or a scramble|pg||
nt|sybarra: not 4 @H?   |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: in italy most doubles suggest a desire to compete further, even after the fit has been found|pg||
nt|tez: 2 nt neymiþ ümit?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@S the end?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: interesting that north does not unblock - you would think he would, as then either defender can win the third heart if need be|pg||
nt|athene: but even if you play it as scramble you can use it, like this, to show a weak 3@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: (direct 3@H bid is stronger)|pg||
nt|athene: of course if that is what the double meant then it is easy for south to bid on|pg||
nt|kingcur: 3NT could be non-serious: a hand that has no slam interest unless S is big|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzdp: 2nt 3 lü h tutusu|pg||

nt|danilo1: wd|pg||
nt|leo lasota: uh oh|pg||
nt|psyck: now will need @h fin after @c ruff|pg||
nt|leo lasota: very surprised at the line taken by peter here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: again, the question to consider is how likely will the trumps split 41 or 50 after 9 clubs lead?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: güneydeki oyuncu bu durumda mutlu olmalý sanýrým|pg||
nt|kemperg: and 4@S emphasises that|pg||
nt|kingcur: S would have become more enthusiastic perhaps if N had not shown @D cue|pg||
nt|sybarra: this must be there form of cue bids |pg||
nt|kemperg: for S @SQ instead of @HQ is enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why ace of @H not shown|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe N showed it |pg||
nt|kingcur: so, would we leave it @@4@S with this S hand?|pg||
nt|kemperg: would deny @D controle|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a 4 @C, last train, cue for hts?|pg||
nt|kingcur: I think I would|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: the trouble is, it might make things hard for you too - you have to find a couple of discards, and you also lose your dummy entries|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Will be 2 or 3 down now - good defence|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: if this holds the trick, what does declarer do next?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume play @C to the A and @C up.  @D A has to be in front|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is fairly sure now that north has the @HA, which makes it safer to play another heart, as north is probably not going to be the one with long hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no way the defence can set themselves up some long hearts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Pity on the nice defense to miss the second ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now heart best|pg||
nt|nilsland:  up to now ;)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kingcur: if 3NT would show a non-serious hand ánd S has bid a last-train 4@H that got no positive response, then I think 6@S can never be good|pg||
nt|sybarra: so the cues seemed to all be "last train" type |pg||
nt|leo lasota: possible south holds trump stack if north has elected to lead 9 clubs from 98x, but extremely unlikely|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: north obviously worried about the weak opening|pg||
nt|athene: but as a dummy for clubs it is pretty good really|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|leo lasota: potential for huge gain for cappelli now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: @HJ suit-preference for diamonds over clubs of course|pg||
nt|danilo1: I do not disagree with @S back by Fantoni ... attacking options since declarer still fears @D overruffs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: north knows his partner has five hearts of course from the 2@D bid|pg||

nt|kingcur: playing the hand exactly like Lauria did, incidentally. And he probably was regretting not being in slam until that 2nd @D was ruffed by N|pg||
nt|leo lasota: at unfav, many would not elect to open 3H in 3rd chair there, but again it follows robinson/boyd's aggressive style|pg||
nt|leo lasota: south may choose 4H as choice of games with 4 spades, longer minor?|pg||

nt|jaapfr: looks wise to me to bid a modest 2@D as W|pg||

nt|leo lasota: while north holds 19, he does not want to risk going minus opposite passed hand partner, so makes wise choice of 4S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: a push   |pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib suggests 2@S preempt after TO x - to risky in my view as West likely to have @S virw x|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 3@s 6+S, denies 3+H|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni does not have that many extras now i think|pg||

nt|athene: but it seems he is giving this a bit of thought|pg||
nt|danilo1: 7@H board may even cost Championship|pg||
nt|psridhar:  now the key card resp will take them to slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: lead @C from Qxx|pg||
nt|leo lasota: now the defense cannot effectively attack hearts as declarer has the key 9 of hearts|pg||

nt|kingcur: a lot of @S losers to get rid of here|pg||

nt|kemperg: spec confirms|pg||
pc|sA|nt|runnerup:  yes 2 @s is a clear bid -4 @s is -i cant say aloud --and 4 @h was overboard all ready|pg||
nt|kingcur: but having escaped a trump lead gives best prospects for S|pg||
nt|kemperg: no defense left|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I want to lead trump from qxx |pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, impossible trump lead|pg||
nt|kingcur: I must admit I wouldn't even have considered leading trumps here with that holding...but it would have been the only way to beat this contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: me neither, and also the Italians did not:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does it really beat it? |pg||
nt|kingcur: specs pointing out there is a Bols tip telling me that I should have :)|pg||

pc|s2|nt|athene: but south "bent" a 1nt call on board 1, 3, and 4|pg||

nt|kemperg: quick claim|pg||
nt|psyck: can make rest of the tricks here if he gets it rite with 5@s's, 1@h, 3@d, 3@c|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: i suppose you might misguess spades twice, leading to the 8 then the jack?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|psyck: if def pkays 2 trumps, dec only has 2@d & 8 @c tricks|pg||
nt|kingcur: trump lead means no trump trick for defense, but W can lead a 2nd trump when in with @SQ...then no way to make, I think|pg||
nt|adonis18:  sorry, 3 sp losers:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice hand for a quiz, what would you lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|sharkey: Passing with North's hand first time just creates problems later on - as evidenced here|pg||

pc|d7|nt|kemperg: why wait with @DA?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: the opening 3@C is a matter of style - the two aces and only a 6-card suit are negative factors, but you argue against that |pg||

nt|leo lasota: matter of partnership agreement, but I find that demand other major is better than having partner guess which of 3 suits to lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: some play transfer to hearts then bid 3nt shows 5 hearts and 4 spades, not forcing|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3-3 now perhaps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the danger here could be the range of the 1NT rebid - no, 2@c|pg||

pc|s9|nt|athene: aggressive from north; if partner has only 3 spades, game will never be there, and even when he has 4, it needs a lot|pg||

nt|MolvaM: önce pas geçip sonra 3nt diyen oyuncuda muhtemeln körlerin iyi olmasý gerek|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt feels a bit agressive to me |pg||
nt|kingcur: As I said, there's a Bols tip dedicated to this...and I believe it was the late Hans Kreijns (Dutch expert) who taught us: does the bidding sound like a trump lead? Then lead ...|pg||

nt|athene: could he be 4-3-3-3 on that bidding?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand looks very interesting, two slams beaten by bad breaks|pg||
nt|athene: north might get endplayed in 3@C, for example heart lead ruffed, draw trumps, then play a spade|pg||
nt|athene: north will have to lead a spade or diamond|pg||

nt|athene: east really bid 2@D? is this a 2-way bid, maybe weak spade raise or some strong options?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yy 5@H does make with @S @S lead kibs:)|pg||
nt|kingcur: any spade lead maybe even...which means this could cost: it's not the most unimaginable lead for E after all|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu  all later |pg||
nt|kingcur: thx Shirley :)|pg||
nt|psyck: thx Shirley|pg||
nt|leo lasota: promising when one picks up balance 15 count, until they open str nt in front of you|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Boyd just checked the clock to make sure they weren't behind :). There are some other players who could learn from that. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: bye Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe a better plan was to cash the @DA at trick 2, then return the heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice to see that even Fantunes can err occasionally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner started with @DKx he can cash the @DK before giving you the heart ruff, and you can give him a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no need to underlead your @DA trying to pick up @DQxx with declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt =dd and down in practive if no helping bids in defence (like here) perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so we see lauria's opinion of the tricky bidding problem for balanced 24 count after 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: might very well get the clubs right - we shall see|pg||
nt|athene: he doubled and basically forced to 6@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lucky 6 @s for bear card bid and made quite lucky|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nilsland:  25 to 7=32 now we surely will see a slam|pg||
nt|psridhar:  Facing a passed pd Aluf doesnt fancy 4@s and fancies defending 1N|pg||
nt|psridhar:  hence that pass of 1N|pg||
nt|kingcur: this looks like a Fantunes style of 2@H opener|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: West might have passed - six spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might deem it unsuitable for a weak two |pg||
nt|gsper:  E has a lot of cards but does not know where to go|pg||
nt|psyck: it would be a good idea for specs to discuss with their pd's what x would mean on 3NT last deal: lead @s, non-@s, or other maj...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gsper:  And knows even less now|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would bid 3NT now and go down|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s maybe...|pg||
nt|athene: defence have to be slightly careful here to cash out the diamonds and not for example try to cash two hearts|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the systematic 2@D bid did S pass else he could bid and NS in a @H contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: clever action|pg||
nt|psyck: now @d goes away|pg||
nt|psyck: @d lead should beat i suppose|pg||
nt|kingcur: @C lead too?|pg||
nt|psyck: well if he ducks & they play @d....|pg||
nt|psyck: else winning & playing @s will make|pg||
nt|kingcur: @CA and a spade probably, but no entry to enjoy the discard I think|pg||
nt|psyck: 4th seat 2 level bids generally show such hands|pg||
nt|psyck: as kibs point, will need to unblock @s Q & fin due to entry probs|pg||
nt|kingcur: that would be some play|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: south needs to find the killer diamond switch|pg||
nt|leo lasota: not easy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: But in case some of those other players weren't paying attention, the director announced 27 minutes left in the segemnt|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another failing 7 perhaps|pg||
nt|danilo1: hopefully only 6 this time :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We dont have any system notes. Has East showed @C+@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think so but just a guess|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: i am told, on the NS methods, if south WAS 4333, he would be 18-20, so that was out|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i never see in table any one to finess @c -not expected here |pg||
nt|athene: west tries to conceal the position in clubs|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2@H was natural or 22-24 bal|pg||
nt|psridhar:  if sittng birds are to be shot.....|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR is behind us, so no scores|pg||
nt|psridhar:  and rarely u get to shoot Lauria's contract !|pg||
nt|leo lasota: interesting hand for both the declarer and defense against 3nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: It has been corrected|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gsper:  Opposite an overcall, Hedy?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kareno: 6 either major makes with spades friendly.|pg||
nt|athene: so the defence don't realise the urgency to cash out in diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: tough call but he may see there are no other chances|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: very good slam|pg||
nt|psridhar:  clever it may hv been but NS can make 2@s and the upshot could well be -2 imps|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: kickard, love it|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose 6@H is a bit better than 6@S because you might make it even with a bad spade break, but it's hard to get out of a 4-4 fit once you lock into it|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play 9@H now only down chance |pg||
nt|psyck: wd|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nilsland:  sry 24+ bal|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@C looks like nat (@C support) and slam interest|pg||
nt|kingcur: 9 more to NS on  10, OR letting EW play in 2@S (down 2)|pg||
nt|kingcur: he did it, wd|pg||
nt|psyck: they really are FOXY|pg||
nt|kingcur: lol|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, diamonds might produce an extra trick.|pg||
nt|athene: so the underlead looks like a definite slip|pg||
nt|psyck: well, i did guess E would bid @s, just misguessed the number|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nilsland:  but I do not know more|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Your guesses is as good as mine (or better)|pg||
nt|danilo1: and 4NT is probably @D cue ...so Sementa asks for third round control in @H now I thk|pg||
nt|fabsayc: either way looks a shakey auction|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... but he may get third round @S control :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: and 7 more on  11, OR in 2@C|pg||
nt|psyck: certainly been earning their imps against such a strong team|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: no @S Q so 6 only|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if 2@S is 5/5, he knows W has diamonds - straw in the wind perhaps|pg||
nt|bobholl: from N point of vieuw a singleton @H is only chance but lauria wouldn't have covered|pg||
nt|psridhar:  unless Aluf has guts to shift to @H|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psridhar:  and not cash his pd's Ace|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but agustin did realize:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|MolvaM: bu arada geçen senenin þampiyonu Prusa-M takýmý B grubunda mücadele eder durumda|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kareno: 5@h may show two without trump queen.|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should have taken control with blackwood over 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: normally you don't want the limited hand as captain|pg||
nt|athene: east just wants to know if her partner has @SAQ, @HA, @DA - then 7 is good|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kareno: There's no safety play in the spade suit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@c - so old hat these days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that could be a very expensive @d7 discard|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: west can never know if 7 is good because he does not know his partner has six solid hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @S2 to K and club finesse?|pg||
nt|gsper:  The voice commentators are criticizing 3@H, a bit unfairly I think|pg||
nt|gsper:  Considering the alternatives|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Again|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... 5NT is not the luckiest bid for EW|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Later today there will be some systemic discussion - in Italian....|pg||
nt|psridhar:  udca?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gsper:  3@H is not good, but what else is?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: some specs are suggesting that if west wants to give the impression he has no club honour in hand, the jack was a better card to play|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: that is usually what you would do, sure, but if you had a singleton club in hand you might try the king|pg||

nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|runnerup:  are we aware about situation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe one too many grappas at dinner|pg||
nt|runnerup:  maybe west bid 2 @s -yes looks better|pg||
nt|psridhar:  no?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: many players use 2S, 2nt, and 3C by the opener after 1nt-2D transfer as showing a maximum (good 16 or 17 HCP) with a useful dblton|pg||
nt|leo lasota: useful defined as xx or Ax|pg||
nt|leo lasota: so North would have bid 3C here if they played that, and South would know KJ10 of clubs is not a great holding opposite the useful dblton|pg||
nt|leo lasota: :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: east must have thought 2@S was a relay and west thought it was natural by a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: now north may know his opponents have had a misunderstanding but he still has to judge whether to double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h=10-13, 5+@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: weird|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok --nonsence|pg||

nt|gsper:  3@C may be singleton ask|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, next round in 55 min.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think double is right|pg||
nt|gsper:  What on Earth is going on here?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: perfect example of a hand where showing the useful dblton helps responder to accurately gauge the slam potential|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if they wake up and bid a cold 4@S you just hope that your teammate are in it anyway|pg||
nt|athene: now south might discover a diamond suit tucked away there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cc says 2@s=realy, but maybe that doesn't apply by a passed hand  |pg||
nt|athene: if partner asks you for non-spade suits and you have seven in one of them, you might want to bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s presumably some sort of fit-jump|pg||
nt|psyck: are we looking at the same boards :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  It is suggested that thay are playing board 29|pg||
nt|hedyg:  UNDO ?|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe the bidding is for board 29|pg||
nt|tez: 5@s kontrlu yaparlarsa Akgül takýmý sayý kazanýr|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south is thinking how bad a dummy for diamonds his partner might put down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h-3@h might have bought it|pg||
nt|athene: i guess something like 2-4-3-4 shape is possible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: something maybe not quite right here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is not gonna make :) .heh heh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think W playing 3@d on a 3-2 fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a bright kib said better W bidding 2@H and then 3@H (for the ones who see 3@H as 5/5m)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't know what 3@C means but i have no doubt they will bid 6@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: my guess is 3@H no major 4@D is choose anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@C asking, 3@H no major, 4@D both majors (55)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|leo lasota: So again, all of opener's bids after 1nt-2d transfer available would be: 2S = max, useful dblton spade, 2nt = max, useful dblton diamond, 3c = max, useful dblton club, 3D = max ...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: with aces, 3H = "suitable min" meaning decent 15 or ave 16 with 4 trumps|pg||
nt|leo lasota: surprised south not dbl here wow|pg||
nt|leo lasota: no way is north to find the diamond lead on this auction!|pg||
nt|psyck: ah ha|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah!|pg||
nt|leo lasota: perhaps he leads diamond now :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: double 3@C looks normal with west but this will work out fine anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that might provoke 5@d|pg||
nt|athene: might be a problem now if north passes after a looong think, and south finds 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
nt|gsper:  But even then 3@D is not obvious|pg||
nt|psyck: if so 3@d @c single (with 3@h @d single & 3@s @s single)?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Quite possibly|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead you might well need five diamond tricks so small to the queen is right, isn't it? gains against @DKx onside or @Dxx as here|pg||
nt|athene: @DKx or @DKxx|pg||
nt|ritong: down two, seems|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: I've been working on getting enough operators and computers to cover the Onstott match as well as these two for the final segment, if it's still close, so wasn't paying attention :)...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: even if North is known to have slow-passed, 5@d isn't unreasonable with 7411 shape|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually there are no pure penalty doubles, so was not 100% clear for south to pass|pg||

nt|bobholl: what he shows now with 5@C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: ok, so now you lay down the @DA|pg||
nt|warrens:  surprised W slow-walked this one.  i was expecting a jump to 4@S over 2@S.  it should be easy for N/S to get this right.|pg||

nt|kingcur: small @S might work too|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psyck: yes, but if close to limit raise values, E can envisage a slam with right cards|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a third undertrick now|pg||
nt|nilsland:  for sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade pitch|pg||
nt|nilsland:  four trumps 2@D and the black aces|pg||
nt|danilo1: Fantoni has @D count - so he knows parner has @DQ ... he is thinking what to discard (may disc. @C and South may take and play @CJ) ... |pg||

nt|athene: when you can afford to lose one trick it's better to play the ace first because if you finesse the queen and lose to the king, you have a guess next time whether to play south for ...|pg||

nt|athene: madala cashing the @DA first in here was a good play that made it a lot easier for his partner|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y the crux was madala seeing that and playing @DA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could sementa have avoided this cash club queen and lead low heart|pg||
nt|leo lasota: as west likely would have taken a call with AJ seventh of spades and side ace|pg||

nt|athene: bocchi might be contemplating 4nt here? heart lead, seven (!) diamonds, and lead a spade up for the tenth, just hoping the defence can't cash too many clubs|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but he doesn't know that his singleton club is so suitable, facing such a weak suit|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling 1@s is a close decision|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1@S overcall must be very limited|pg||
nt|ritong: with @s Kx, chance that pard has a penalty pass is slim|pg||
nt|leo lasota: west patterning out here showing 64+ shape, |pg||
nt|psyck: I think that is 1:50 EST & not 2:50|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Boyd confirms that Robinson also said 14+ with short spades and Robinson says yes|pg||
nt|leo lasota: they differentiate shortness with minimum range versus shortness with good 14+ for accurate slam gauging|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Yes, 2:50 local time :)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: an Italian from Argentine or vv?|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, we saw previously that they overcall on air easily|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: that applies to the defense also, 6@D was going down|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lets say could go down|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though the defence should have one trick in each suit here with no problems, but north is in danger of getting endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: so the spade shift was actually necessary|pg||
nt|psyck: going via an artificial 2@c bid to make an invitational raise|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: I agree with Andy, Ghestem sounds sexier|pg||

nt|leo lasota: up to 7 tricks sp far and has time to establish an 8th, but that is all against accurate defense|pg||
