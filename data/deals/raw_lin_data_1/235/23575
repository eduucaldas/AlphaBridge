mb|1C|mb|2H|nt|buffytvs: white zagainst red too :)|pg||
nt|lml: white on red I suspect East is gone to bid a lot of diamonds in his turn|pg||

nt|buffytvs: maybe not now...|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: I ignore partner|pg||
nt|lml: I dont defend with nine diamonds|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@D now still seems like the right bid|pg||
mb|5D|nt|warrens:  makes your opponents guess|pg||
nt|warrens:  make|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D is -500|pg||
nt|buffytvs: where is the third downtrick?|pg||
nt|lml: on a club lead I think it is one down actually|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|lml: or a heart|pg||
nt|bigtrain: actually i missaw the vulnerability|pg||
nt|bigtrain: sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thought it was reversed :)|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think East should bid after partners intervention|pg||
nt|warrens:  now a BIG decision for East|pg||
nt|lml: it sounds like his side might have a bit of defense|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I agree -- he has no defense against 7@C as far as he knows|pg||
nt|lml: except West has something|pg||
nt|lml: he did bid|pg||
nt|buffytvs: preemptively|pg||
nt|warrens:  true, but it's hard to play partner for 2 defensive tricks.  I'm betting he bids.|pg||
nt|lml: Eichenbaum might have doubled but maybe that is too much to ask|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it's just never correct to be the last guesser in these type of siruations|pg||
nt|buffytvs: these auctions are very hard even with clear agreements|pg||
nt|lml: just to take his partner off the guess|pg||
nt|warrens:  once on a hand where I didn't bid one more, partner asked me: what do you call a 9-card suit?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: trumps|pg||
nt|warrens:  exactly :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Ken doesn't know both his hearts are cashing though|pg||
nt|lml: I know... its not for sure|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if South's red suits are stiff heart and dblton @DA, 6@C is cold|pg||
nt|lml: well no blame if Simson bids thats for sure|pg||
nt|lml: by the way Simson just took the lead|pg||

mb|1N|nt|bigtrain: i think defending with the south hand was a long run winner|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bigtrain: 1nt is 14-16|pg||
nt|warrens:  is this @D's and @H's? or something else?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't think the hand is worth an upgrade though|pg||
nt|buffytvs: might be Multi... one major|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think they play dont or meckwell|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no cc that Linda can find|pg||
nt|bigtrain: definitely NOT one major|pg||
nt|lml: I am going to look elsewhere ... not on USBF site|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bigtrain: as i said @D+major but not sure if meckwell or dont|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|warrens:  based on that bid, I think it must have promised @H's.  otherwise, why not 3@D|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I agree|pg||
nt|lml: I think it might have shown A major and based on the transfer to hearts Simson worked out that it was hearts|pg||
nt|lml: last time I looked many of the US teams play multiLandy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|lml: worked out it was spades ... sorry|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: declarer is a little short of hand entries here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and high cards :)|pg||
nt|lml: on the previous board the auction was similar but East, Rubin went to 6@D|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|lml: and that little "safety bid" cost 12 imps|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that may be a board you see in several magazine and newspaper articles|pg||
nt|lml: it just shows that you cant just bid one more for the road|pg||
nt|warrens:  big difference in the other room is that partner overcalled 1@H, not 2, which makes sacrificing even less clear to me|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|bigtrain: in the other room 1@C was natural...   here it was strong|pg||
