nt|queequeg: won't be able to help much here but I think D'avossa will not play with Zaleski the same very artificial system he uses with his usual p (Intonti)|pg||

nt|sharkey: *part|pg||
nt|queequeg: buongiorno a tutti :) good morning|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cricket being cancelled is rather annoying to us Brits - still, with Fantoni-Nunes in action, there is an upside |pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|queequeg: hi Mike, hi William :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: good slam , might reach it now|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|queequeg: buonasera :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guessing on 2@c - could be natural, could be a limited 3-suiter - sry, don't have CC for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: west hand is too ugly for any bid in my opinion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so 1nt-2c- 2d-3nt was proper auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hearts have got lost|pg||

mb|4S!|an|not slammish|nt|ady: balance by north pushes  e/w overboard|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is a transfer to clubs here i think|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d ya 2@s denebilirdi kuzeyden|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course madala knows his opponents have at least a game, and quite possibly more, so he makes as much noise as he can|pg||
nt|queequeg: ciao Martin :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: Good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: El remate hubo stayman y luego 3 st.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missed opportunity for trailing team|pg||
nt|runnerup:  nice kvick tricks in 3nt and south has no problems to bid that|pg||
nt|athene: good low-hcp 3nt; 100% secure on any lead and any lie|pg||
nt|athene: yes it shows the power of a long suit with quick tricks outside|pg||
nt|athene: NS don't have a single point wasted in fact|pg||
nt|athene: maybe Duboin is wondering which major to lead?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time 4 @s is anly 300 but you lose in a long run if you bid those -because in all cases ns aren't aware what they do and 3nt can go down|pg||
nt|athene: yes i don't think EW can reasonably contemplate a sacrifice|pg||
nt|athene: -300 vs -400 is the best you can possibly hope for|pg||
nt|athene: and it might often be -300 or -500 against +50|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|sharkey: yes - but 3@H looks like a make so down 1 may be good business|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts should make   so -50  best e/w can do|pg||
nt|tez: ortakta zayýf @s eli olduðunu düþünebilirdi|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: might make 6@h with a few good views|pg||
