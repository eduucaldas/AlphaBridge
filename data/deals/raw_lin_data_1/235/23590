nt|vugraphzft: We start the match with a change of players|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Team Scania thought they could meet the same players in both halfs since they play a complicated system, but it seems it wasn't complicated enough to make the cut|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: W doing some explaining, multi, defense being discussed too|pg||

nt|kattbridge: not as dummy:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: or maybe I am mistaken|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that is not how the players seem to experience it|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  not that Gronkvist-Rimstedt are moving to the retirement home in the near future either|pg||
nt|nilsland:  NS dont make 3N here|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: Welcome back! We're doing these 12 boards before midnight here in Örebro|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: East has shown @S + @C with his 2@S-bid|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2:  How come that so many teams were penalised in the first round?|pg||
nt|bt: 4@H has a play maybe|pg||
nt|bt: yes thats interesting, whats with the penalties?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Also welcome to Germ Kemper|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW play strong club|pg||

nt|mamos:  North has balanced 22 so would expect \\S to o on to game  ah yes  3@c presumably major ask|pg||

nt|kemperg: Hi all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Mikael and all specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Welcome back|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: We've changed match in the vugraph once more|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone and wellcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They play a two way-club. 2@c shows 0-3 spades, GF unbal or 21+ bal|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Good morning|pg||
nt|muppe: hard to judge these high level auctions|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And they choose to play it in the last half of the last match in the Swedish Teams Championships|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos:  loks like puppet|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I'm guessing this is a puppet Stayman sequence|pg||
nt|baldfriede: there was a very simliar board in the last set with the same suit distribution, but W held A@h. that confused me|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: With 3-3 @C this won't be a problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW will score three tricks and that's it|pg||
nt|3for3: An easy 3nt to start the set|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sunsamvar: shd be puppet|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS play an odd system, strong club with trf-openings|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2:  http://tinyurl.com/7qkzz3q  for running scores|pg||
nt|kemperg: not easy , good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Well, North decided to put the dummy down before the lead was made :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  so N shows a  4 card major and South shows Spades  (by bifdding Hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/Yoda.pdf for their convention card (in Swedish)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This is because last year North here played in team Kamras|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East has shown his five spades and four clubs in the bidding, and West then gets to decide the final contract|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos:  and strong hand is declarer :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: looks like he will lose 1@D and 1@H thanks to the lucky lie in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: an intra finesse in trumps does the work if declarer can handle the rest|pg||
pc|d5|nt|3for3: Lusky can afford one spade play into east|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzft: NS plays strong club with 5c M-openings|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@c being a GF relay in this sequence|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos:  and everything  down to @d98 doubleton is about as helpful as it could be|pg||

pc|c3|nt|bt: a diamond back at trick 2 would have made it interesting|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  An old-fashioned 2@s bid here.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the @c finesse works here, but it is not enough for a slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: declarer went for the percentage play in trumps (if South had Kxx, low to the nine would have cost the contract) and went down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Welcome back to Örebro where we're playing the third day out of four in the Swedish Teams Championships|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hans-Ove is in fact in the lead with 0.5 VP|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: hi Friede|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW doesn't rate to make much here, NS should manage about 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: You have to stay out of 5 of either minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW play Pass as 0-7 or 17+, hence the rest of their openings are placed somewhere in between|pg||
nt|bt: brb|pg||
nt|oliverc: How does that come to be in their CC?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 5@h is a make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this contract won't be pretty if Wrang finds a pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: it looks like they can take 6 red suit tricks, the ace of clubs and three trumps|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: EW use rather similar methods|pg||

pc|c9|nt|vugraphzft: Sorry?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5-2-2-4 normally is 1 @s but Wrang thougth otherwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I agree with the NT-opening, it might be wrong but it simplifies the auction so much|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: So we will now follow "The Fight of the Forcing Pass"|pg||

pc|cT|nt|muppe: Hi all|pg||

nt|mamos:  no reson not  to pas  1NT IMHO|pg||

nt|kattbridge: and now they now it´s time to change to@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South tries to lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that makes East pass|pg||
pc|cA|nt|georgi:  ranking updated + teams roster|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: 2@C was Stayman, but didn't promise a major|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: I think 1NT shows @C and 2@S is natural with the strong hand|pg||
nt|po-s: clearly not 0-7...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: oops, that run didn't do EW any good|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|georgi:  http://bridge.bg/ranking1054.html|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT was 1 down, this has a chance|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Smörgasbröd comess with everything in Sweden :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@C has put the brakes on|pg||
nt|bt: unlucky for south diamonds will be overruffed in dummy and hearts in hand|pg||
nt|ady: only ace and king of spades as top losers with club finesse on   but 5-0 break makes life difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table  started 1@D-P-2@D[forcing]-3@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: E focused the lead on the wrong suit :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wojewoda playing 3N South -- opening lead .... @C10|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: screen down and Casen is asking questions|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzeg: ... and NS had no problem getting to the right spot|pg||
nt|oliverc: They play the Smörgasbörd 2@D?|pg||
nt|mamos:  not an easy lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a 3-3 @S fit = garbage i suppose :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (Other than @ss, of course.)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: and NT is totally impossible|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@c is a bit tricky with a spade lead too though|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt is coffee board I am not criticising just telling what i saw|pg||
nt|bt: see if ns can sort this out, though i think east ran premature there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I"m covering this table and the Kasle closed room and have been going from table to table - just to let you know how well bridge players at this level concentrate, Drew just ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: noticed I was here :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petka:  the tempo in this bidding worked well for NS. The only one who might feel a bid "underbid" is south, with some extras in her hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i think that blew a trick (not that it was by any means strange)|pg||
nt|bt: and only one diamond cashes|pg||
nt|bt: 2@C was difficult to double |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: yes, that might have bought the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but I guess South would have tried 2NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|po-s: slam is making?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: perhaps, but it's not one you would like to be in|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: He will at least get 5 tricks now so it won't be extremely expensive|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mamos:  how would he proceed after 2@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if you chose your third suit as trump that is|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@C ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: wow, some partscore overbidding here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sundell knows that his p is short in @H... still a brave 3@C with his 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cant say anything nice about that 3@C bid except it did its job|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kattbridge: I guess tommy plays on spades now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|po-s: before or after?|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  I think that Sout would have dobled 2@C.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, we'll never know now :)|pg||
nt|bt: a slow double of 2@C looks perfect|pg||
nt|bt: :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzft: A trump shift might induce North to take the finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I wonder too. garbage stayman works best with longer @d instead with lonfer @c|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Now 5 down if they take all their tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|runnerup:  if you bid you'll make it |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: neither|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: cant see the way for this to make |pg||
pc|h4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nilsland:  One pair made 3N one went 3down in the last hand|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d8|pc|c8|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@S down by @C ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Well, 3@H is also some bid on a flat hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: with a pre-passed partner|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and a bare 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: maybe he hoped for a singleton club?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but atleast he was not vul|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @D 2 fin to make|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||

nt|runnerup:  was home if he takes 2 high @h before 2. @s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: After a quiet start this can be more interesting :)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6n by north is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1NT showed a maximum (11+) and 3@C was natural, might have been canapé|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if you're still interested|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here comes a board with really bad breaks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: we have Hans- Ove's son Alexander watching his dad in action here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so every VP crucial|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 6@h is down on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: (due to an upper cut)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But 6NT is always making|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Fredin was not happy with his partner|pg||
nt|bt: so the double of 1nt asked for a @S lead, know north will ask why he didnt lead it|pg||
nt|kattbridge: maybe an imp to SS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras won 9 imps on board one when EW played 4H X -1 at the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Krekorian says he was going to lead a heart because "that is my strongest suit"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i could have made a wrong opening lead even without partner's help|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = 10-13 hcp, normally a 6-c suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  Forsberg-GrÃ¶nkvist leading in the current running scores, but very small differences|pg||
nt|underdogg:  1@d = 8-11, bal/4M5+m/5-5m|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in the end situation |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Mikael and Jim|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a quiet 2@S here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Sivve got off to a nice start when NS in the other room reached 3NT on board 13|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzft: Director has been called|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: hi!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that contract didn't make and picked up 12 imps|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2@h=@h and a minor?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south is shut out of @h |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N now 15-17  [3rd vul and always 4th]|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Ida will bid 2@D now|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and that will end the auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: seems wrong explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: According to EW it's the double that's incorrect, not the explanation|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||

nt|kemperg: @D oosition will break 4 @H|pg||
nt|kemperg: position|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass is just plain wrong imho|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Grähs guesses to pass his partner's short club|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW use a strong club|pg||
nt|harmon: 3s a slight overbid for George|pg||
mb|2N|nt|wygbe1: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: According to CC a normal weak 2:  http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/pekksalo1.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this will lead to a 4-2 fit instead of a 4-4 one|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras has had a nice start here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: one down in a vulnerable game that could make and then +800|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: let's see if Scania can turn this around|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: On a lucky day this would be a slam. And this is a lucky day because it is right-sided.|pg||
nt|mamos:  can they bid a slam from North|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d by n also available now|pg||
nt|mamos:  indeed mayne now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North has a very good hand for seing partner open 2@C gameforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang with a successful decision here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Might push NS into 5@H down (it could also make)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|runnerup:  4 @h needs careful play |pg||
nt|po-s: "making 12" gör jag som spelförare|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yet another 1NT-3NT with a 4c major. We've seen several of these auctions this weekend|pg||
nt|harmon: Steve knows George hence the pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  East will have no problem making this|pg||
nt|petka:  perhaps they play something artificial after a 1N intervention? so that her choice was pass or 3D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they don't|pg||
nt|mamos:  4-4 major fits are so important|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS doesn't make game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = @H + @C, minimum|pg||
nt|kattbridge: singelton?|pg||
nt|ady: jsut 10 tricks for n/s in hearts    inital pass shows 0-7   or 17+|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzft: 2@S = good-looking hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  40 and diamonds like that, hmm|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3NT was good, a pen.dbl too|pg||
nt|runnerup:  also 3nt sits|pg||
nt|baldfriede: ah, finally a CC which is in English|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... and this is two down misguessing spades, otherwise only one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: In the other room East opened the bidding on his five-count(in the 6@d-board)|pg||
nt|muppe: this seems makeable, EW had a save available in 5@c|pg||
mb|4D|nt|nilsland:  Some players use 2@C as artifical but 2@D is normally nat|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but 2@D wasn't making|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2 @D, 3 @S and 1 @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so only a minor swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Funny thing you mention that. Been a lot of discussion in the swedish forums about how rude it is to make your cc's in english rather than swedish|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I would guess he will finesse spades since it's an odds-on play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  south has overbid  in myopinion|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: w/o @H lead it can make i thk|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H showed a bad raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Showing 6-16. They ended up in 3NT nevertheless|pg||
nt|kattbridge: opps, let´s see if F finds hartlead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Håkan thought 3@H showed 5-6 or so|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzft: yes, that's true. Diamonds are 3-3 so it might be possible to make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Win with the king, cash the ace of spades and play four rounds of diamonds pitching two hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Fredin is not happy...|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: 4@h appears to be asking|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@H= rkc ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It's of course normal when 3433 |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Communications are rather terrible on this board|pg||
nt|kattbridge: interesting contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South alerts Rdbl as some sort of Mancoff, showing xx+ in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: direct seat 2@C is described in SSF [system summary form] as   either @D or 2 suit with some M+m|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room   P-P-1@D-1N//end|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzft: For specs on bbo however, english is obviously prefered|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3NT is the contract i would like to be in with the EW cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  east migth run to 2 @s but it makes 3nt a good contract -finess =|pg||
nt|mamos:  if North cues Clubs they surely will|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: no, it's just a cuebid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: apparently, and S showed 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They've just have a standard cuebidding auction where North will correct 6@D to 6NT because of his lack of trump support|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, ok, a cuebid then. but that should help @s|pg||
nt|po-s: North and South live so far apart that they wouldn´t understand eah other´s dialects|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well, for me it is certainly easier to have it in English|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Here they have wrongsided the contract|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @c has some extra chances -6 nt you have to finess in rigth red suit |pg||
nt|bt: arvidsson read a lot into the 1nt rebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: win in hand and low diamon?|pg||
nt|bt: this is a make now, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: *diamond|pg||
nt|bt: fredin should have just continued diamonds|pg||
nt|bt: clubs|pg||
mb|6D|nt|runnerup:  8 in nt -no hope higher and doubled perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think West had bid out his shape and that there was little point in removing 3NT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i guess @C doubleton happens very rarely when u open 1@C|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but with an Ace i wd respond too|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i don't really know their style but I think this is the only distribution when it's only two|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: some pairs (including myself) open all balanced hands w/o a 5c M 1@C, then it's much more frequent|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that may be and only occurs 3% of time, but that is not the reason pass is wrong|pg||
nt|muppe: @h lead cost a trick here|pg||
nt|kattbridge: I mean 3 @S RD|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  this lead helps a bit|pg||
nt|kemperg: need a crossruff, but has to make a @D trick first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do they know i keycard is missing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: maybe not now though|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Cruff, 3 rounds of @Ds to pitch a @H and then enter in @SA to ruff 4th @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: According to Peder Linder, North has shown a good slam try with 6+ @C and singleton @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: playing with diamonds as trump would probably have made you happier|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: will be an easy road to 11 tricks for declarer now|pg||
nt|muppe: E need to cash his @c A now unless he wont make a trick with it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Markku|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: partner could have a huge hand where 4@H makes|pg||

nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i agree Martin and the hands cud fit well with his 4-4 in the rounded suits|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hard to see any other than 140 here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wygbe1: good choice by north, protecting his club holding|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: cuebids are fine but i thk S shd take control with rkc at some point|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5NT was RKC|pg||
nt|runnerup:  po-s idea north should tranfer to @c and suth with good hand bids 3 @c now south is declarer|pg||
nt|po-s: sex sang går väl bra|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Which is strengthed by North's explanations|pg||
pc|c7|nt|oliverc: fast claim here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i mean N can have a similar hand with the @Ca instead of the kj.. then 7 is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: before that she didn't know of North's club cue|pg||

pc|c9|nt|nilsland:  In this match Cilla and Ida is NS and Jessica and Kathrine EW - thats means that a good board for one of the pairs will spill some IMPs on the other pair as well|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: Bertheau-Larsson have a huge score on 15 with +400 NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: We apologize for the delays. Hopefullt everything will work from now on!|pg||
nt|bt:  on board 1 ns at the other table gor all the way to 6@C which isnt impossible, luckily for them they will go 2 down|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so proved to be too difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: now that would be interesting!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: only if you can proe that the 12 apostles used to play bridge at 3 tables :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Make jobs for translaters.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras won 11 imps on board 1 when 3NT went down in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so a very likely gain for Kamras on  15|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: it wasn't even a promotion since he had a trump trick by force|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but Sun does not know that... P cud hv @Cqx|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: anyhow, one down is the likely result in 2@H (two spades, two hearts and two diamonds) so that might result in a push|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: he wasn't, Fredin apologized as soon as he claimed|pg||
nt|bt: good choice |pg||
nt|muppe: their only hope is that OR will be in 6@c -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Some very harsh words exchanged|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 10 more imps for Sivve since NS in the other room reasonably ducked game|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Another good breaking board|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not the worst slam /east but 3nt +3 normal result|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Their card does not say enything but 1@C=3+ cards|pg||
nt|ady: was never a fan of the strong pass system |pg||
mb|1N|nt|wygbe1: with that, n might have bid 6c over 5nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in old notes -- EW show controls over 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: interesting opening|pg||
nt|mamos:  loks like a partscore board |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the opening lead was a more successful diamond that removed West's entry to the hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the 10-13 opening once more|pg||
nt|bt: in a strong club framework many would open the west hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzft: EW play Pass as 0-7/ 17+, the rest being artificial as well|pg||
nt|bt: lets see what mr bergdahl decides here, he is creative :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS only have one loser but do not make slam with the bad brakes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: true, but that wasn't the case :)|pg||
nt|muppe: Lucky slam here for EW, but after N overcall it could even be bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: These guys play the most natural version of it |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: sorry, +400 EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: N to take the safe?|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT for EW?|pg||
nt|oliverc: looks like a fairly straightforward 3NT for EW here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: as I said, 5NT was RKC and 6@D showed 0/3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but 3@D by NS is likey down too. let us see|pg||
nt|kattbridge: maybe same system as after 1 NT opening, som play 3 in major as singel|pg||
nt|harmon: forcing club positive response old style precision'|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzft: Bennet and Bergdahl here are two of the more creative players in the tournament|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=Ace or 2-Kings|pg||
nt|reisig: Who is commenting here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: means @H Jxxx and @C Jxxxx|pg||
nt|rodal f: If -1 3NT can be problematic NS. If NS have a safe 3NT they often make 500|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, Stayman instead of transfer?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Think these guys play the NT-system made by former pair Upmark/Cullin|pg||
nt|bt: ns are lucky to find their fit at all|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if west playes for @d to be nicely he has 4 such -by ducking but still only 8 if defenders see the situation|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|chorush: Welcome to the final 12 boards of a nail-biter of a match|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzeg: missed spade-fit here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@d = 8-11 4M4+m/bal/55+ ms|pg||
nt|bt:  unusual, think this is close to a minimum, even in a very positive mindset|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so they knew what they were doing :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that is what happened, West (who is a she in the open room btw) ducked but the defence didn't give her a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we can hope for some fireworks, if not on this board but maybe later :)|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So South determines the hand is worth one bid and elects to make it a @H raise.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@D = relay, 2@H = any M|pg||
nt|kattbridge: I know, it´s against then game of bridge to pass with good cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  here is one reason for transfer responses. Playing transfers east could show 44 majors non-forcing with 1C-1D-1H-1S|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If NS atack @H in time they will beat this|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Unless declarer finds to endplay N|pg||
nt|kemperg: thks kib, 4@H , 5)minor, 3010 pts|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3-10|pg||
nt|runnerup:  dangerous opening bid -of course difficult for opponent also ,but even here when south has so good hand 3 @h maybe too high|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Solves the "jobs problem" and convention-card misunderstanding in 1 fell swoop.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I didn't really see the opening lead, sorry!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I'm waiting for someone to come do one of these matches, so at the moment I'm doing two tables and doing my best to get bidding and results in|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Having no eight card fit, they decide to settle in 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: No, and they didn't have any agreement on 3@H but Fredin thought it was obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  2@S will have attracted the best lead but I dont like bidding there on that|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: all about picking up clubs, which he will do|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that brave 2@D bid has pushed E/W overboard here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@s being invitational with 5 spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is a figth .migth end on losing level|pg||
nt|bt: arent they already?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cards don't sit nicely so 3nt migth fail -@d lead coming -perhaps helps but not enougth --but on 1- level no problems |pg||
nt|jcwla:  This time catches partner with six. A surprising sellout by EW and not a victory for artificiality.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bt: 3nt is a weird bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: it shows @H and a maximum, not that strange right?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos:  wow North has faith in his partner's NV overcall|pg||
pc|hT|nt|runnerup:  yes but you have to make rigth thing to beat 5 @s|pg||
nt|bt: i think ns did very well to find their fit here, lets see what he does. playing on diamonds after being shortened in dummy doesnt look likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3@c asking for 5c M|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   not guaranteed     avoiding club lead  could be difficult|pg||
nt|kattbridge: but Tommy get´s some help by knowing 0-7 in norths hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|nilsland:  So best in to play @H before taking the clubs - difficult thou|pg||
nt|mamos:  nope its pushed  NS overboard as well|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think North bid great, I wouldn't have overcalled 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://tinyurl.com/7qkzz3q  7:2 for running scores|pg||
nt|ady: understandable not leading a heart on the bidding which would have been better|pg||
nt|harmon: both tables gonna think they lost a swing here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos:  NS did need to get into the action somehow |pg||
nt|mamos:  but needed to know when to stop pushing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: a balanced hand with 10 hcp is not a two level overcall, non-vul or not|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice low @S by Sundell|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Catastrophy stroke on board 2 for Adde when his partner had to play 3@S and went 4 down vulnerable|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so this shd go down now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This gave Hans-Ove 10 imps|pg||
nt|bt: well i assumed 2@S was an ask as opposed to natural :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzft: there is no alert ;)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H should clarify Ace [could still have held @HK @CK]|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: persson is going for the throw in, his best chance|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bt: true, how could a bid be conventional then|pg||
pc|h8|nt|baldfriede: unfortunate lay-out here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: real key for Casen is the short @D|pg||
nt|reisig: 9 tricks seem easy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bt: east gives count in hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nilsland:  Or S can keep the @HA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes. nice play|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kattbridge: in mr fredins world everything is Obvius|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But I do agree with him here|pg||
nt|ady: south may have problems discarding when diamonds are played|pg||
pc|h4|nt|baldfriede: very well done.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: as so often is the case, the five-level belonged to the opponents|pg||
nt|runnerup:  very rigth|pg||
nt|bt: the 9th spade was missing unfortunately|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kemperg: anybodys lead, small from QJxxx?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2 down non-vulnerable and undoubled is a very reasonable score here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: anyway, 3@D is also down|pg||
nt|po-s: an unblock would have been better|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So making 3 - next|pg||
nt|harmon: sorry cant see I thot was 2n|pg||
nt|harmon: Hey Im a senior commentator my eyes aint so good|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzft: this will go one down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bt:  now maybe south shouldnt invite knowing they have a 8card fit and maximum 23 hcp?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice def|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East doesn't look very happy right now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: don't know if it's cause partner's thinking or because he thinks he made an error himself|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west must have a clear picture ruff and trumps|pg||
nt|ady: J@H   unusual play but will get 3 hearts  4 clubs  and has 1 top diamond    but still not guaranteed|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|kattbridge: yes, with 5-6 he would just bid 2 h|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/86gquww for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|bt: at the other table north is contemplating after (P)-P-(1@H)-D; (4@D)-??|pg||
nt|reisig: Maybe thinking of a claim|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|runnerup:  against suitcontracts you normally lead Q from QJ762 -this lead cost a trick -but perhaps doesn't matter in this case |pg||
nt|ady: may lose 2 diamonds and 3 spades|pg||
nt|reisig: or ..where he parked the car|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzft: but now he knows North can't have the A of spades|pg||

nt|baldfriede: played !N for @h and thus lost the overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Declarer miscounted diamonds and played another one before cashing the A of @H|pg||
nt|mamos:  hands fit very well for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East apologized for not doubling|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i think that's why he was upset|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Our operator is the one and only Ida GrÃ¼nzwiebel from Mozambique|pg||
nt|jcwla:  No real point to guessing the @DJ there as will not provide two pitches for @S, only goal was to try to sneak a trick through.|pg||
nt|bt: unlucky but normal|pg||
nt|bt: nice slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: yes, no reason to expect anything but a push or 3 imps to San Sac|pg||
nt|runnerup:  was it really nessessary to finess when north had bid ,but it is only 1 imp |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/7rrm7az|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3VP is the difference between 1st and 4th at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: was the J@S played    seems like only 4 losers  2 spades and 2 diamonds?|pg||
nt|harmon: 10 imps to Larsen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HT drops for overtrick -- but not if you're in 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: didn't he make overtrick?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzeg: has given me many spadeleads :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  26 hcp but just 1nt in cards -rare case|pg||
nt|runnerup:  okk 8|pg||
nt|bt: he passed and after another double he bid 5@D which will go one down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not 1 game contract so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Here EW makes 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and 4@S for that matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: He misguessed heart earlier|pg||
nt|kattbridge: @HQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Surely he had enough of a count to know North couldn't possibly have the K@H|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So it will probably come to South in third seat with a close decision, with 11 prime HCP and four @S I think most would dare to open.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|underdogg:  2@c = 8-11 5+@c|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Great 4@s bid.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hmmm.  2@c would seem obvious for s.  Do they play non-forcing free bids?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: At board 3, Göran Adde found a protective 2NT holding 4-4 in the ms after 1@H-2@H which lead to 3@D -1 and 4 imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  EW will play 3N|pg||
nt|bt:  the famous 13-15, very unusual today. some people does not stayman w 4333|pg||
nt|jcwla:  West will show two suits, N does not have a bid.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Now - has West shown specifically the pointed suits, I wonder.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  I suppose either way East might bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah   movie originally showed on-time  but now correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry i doubted you Joe|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Now NS are at a dangerous 3NT it seems.|pg||
nt|mamos:  i imagine this is some kind of three card rtaise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Both these pairs play strong club which is ever so popular in Sweden|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (Negative free bids)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  So, as of the 5 level, their slam potential suit hasn't been mentioned.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H was alerted on South's side of the screen as showing spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North was told it was natural (obviously)|pg||
nt|bt: south has an enormous hand here on this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the +500 in 5@C X earned Team Zang 11 imps when NS played 2@H -1 in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is a good spade game|pg||
nt|runnerup:  pass with 6-5 and 5 @c otherwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  the idea is that after 1C-1red-1M-1N west does not have to guess to bid 2C with 5+, and also that the stronger hand gets the NT. with the transfer approach the weak hand often is declarer, as in 1C-red(transfer)-relay-1N|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Which cna be made playing on clubs|pg||
nt|petka:  ok, nough about that, but many specs were wondering|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: even though I can't see why they would end up there :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  strait forfard game should be -but so i thougth also in last board that they try 3nt -but no|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  What is Wikner's next move? He is a strong chess player also|pg||
nt|jcwla:  OK, an even bigger jump. West will probably raise with such good trumps.|pg||
nt|bt: 6@D a little better at teams|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: Moisant might the best, tough EW are 4-2 in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... it is now being introduced|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now it sounds like a queue bid in support of @ds?|pg||
nt|po-s: better than 5H|pg||
nt|po-s: if you play neg free bids this sounds more like clubs|pg||
nt|po-s: and can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he also plays precision so he's limited to 16 hcp|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Could 2@C be majors?|pg||
nt|harmon: will get  to 4s|pg||
nt|harmon: ( I think)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bt:  i wrote that before he bid :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  looks a noemal 4 @h = ,coffee board-but no 3nt it is|pg||
nt|runnerup:  normal|pg||
nt|kemperg: I hate bidding NT having a 4333|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and if it was it was singleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: (given the 2@S overcall)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This will be interesting|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Or is it specifically @D and @S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  I don't think we know|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Ida?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Think they play it like most people in Sweden, showing @s + other|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but can't you play in 8 cards fit in @h|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Undiscussed calls should be as natural as possible, but what is natural here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@D = always unbalanced, 1NT = 4+ @C|pg||
nt|chorush: tough enough to do one table. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They were doing well at bidding at one table while the other one was playing, but now they're both bidding :)|pg||
nt|chorush: I would assume Stansby has raised to 3NT, or perhaps bid 3D enroute|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bt:  i think the west hand is far too good for 13-15|pg||
nt|baldfriede: then he must havee miscounted @d|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Wd, they got there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Team Yoda gained 15 imps on the last board when their EW-pair got a gift in the shape of 4@cX making|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 11 tricks even|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ok, maybe not good|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but at least decent :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: no, honest, he just bid 3@d|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  910 isn't a score you see every day!|pg||
nt|po-s: as long as declarer doesn´t take two spade ruffs and then tries to establish hearts rather than use his diamonds this should come home|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: how would you play the board, PO?|pg||
nt|po-s: must admit I´m a bit influenced by seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: won't make this time anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west in bidding his strength not his suits =support --|pg||
nt|jcwla:  If West did not have @D's, E was perfectly willing to hear @H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Clubs being out of the question|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kemperg: my partners alwayshave a hand like W|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Well, 4@S sort of carries a connotation of a sixth spade here, but W obviously liked the texture.|pg||
nt|ady: sorry forgot lost a heart trick on the unusual play for J@H last hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nilsland:  3@D is only inviting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: on this board, for example, EW's style will give South a harder opening lead problem|pg||
nt|mamos:  it seems unlikely that declarer can go wrong here|pg||
nt|bt: some would upgrade here :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, look at that :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  new suit found on 4-level hmm|pg||
nt|bt: the fredin double :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or maybe not, 1NT is something resembling a balanced hand|pg||
nt|chorush: 3D is in case bramley has 3 hearts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzft: Everyone's waiting for north to make the lead...|pg||
nt|po-s: ruff, then club finesse?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: strange, 20 count bids once, his partner volunarily with 2 count|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: def shd take the @D ruff and take this down|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: which she didn't have to consider :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3@D is actually worse than 3N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I'm grateful that both of these tables have thoughtful players - I'd never be able to cover two tables with Sontag at them :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|oliverc: good grief :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Missed game here by NS|pg||
nt|wygbe1: oops - 3n laydown|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@H = 4+ @S, 2NT = signoff somewhere|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt icecold.. 5@C depended on keeping @D losers to 1|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if south playes precision he has 1 @c opening |pg||
nt|runnerup:  this bidding beats me |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Looks like a make|pg||
nt|chorush: well 3S put the kibosh on a spade lead so expect a high diamond|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzft: I think South was worth one more try with her eight tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, now i have some back up for saying that Bennet is creative at least :)|pg||
nt|muppe: easy 2@s, with @d  3-3  and @s 3-2 probably making an overtrick|pg||
nt|kattbridge: Now they are in big troubble e-v, If you can´t bid at the 2-level, you can def. not bid on the 3-level|pg||
nt|chorush: Bramley will duck the first one and win the second|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Krekorian hadn't seen Bramley's pass, so hadn't bid, but was thinking about the lead not the bid|pg||
nt|chorush: After winning the second diamond, I expect Bramley to play A and J of hearts, ducked|pg||
pc|s9|nt|po-s: now the danger is spade ruff|pg||
nt|bt: i dont think declare should touch trumps here, might make anyway though|pg||
nt|harmon: Strange auction but I dont know their system 3h was transfer|pg||
nt|chorush: Well, I certainly got that one right:)|pg||
nt|reisig: It seems comments not needed for this one|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bt: now 5@C maybe?|pg||
nt|bt: "I have AK"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: :)|pg||
nt|chorush: This lead makes things considerably easier on declarer. He still has to get 4 tricks from the rounded suits|pg||
nt|chorush: Drew if probably trying to figure the relative probabilities of 1 or 2 clubs in partners hands. It wouldlook to me like 1 becasue declarer should have 4 spades, 2 hearts, 3 ...|pg||
nt|chorush: diamonds and 4 clubs based on the bidding|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bt: this wasnt the worst slam ever|pg||
nt|kattbridge: but saved by the enemy:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras is now 0.3 VP behind Yoda|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But they can't gain anything more themselves, having 25 already|pg||

pc|s4|nt|baldfriede: are we watching ladies?|pg||

pc|c2|nt|vugraphzft: well bid!|pg||

nt|rodal f: We see the cards. They don't.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  there was that michael's to help but still difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think South is all to blame, she could have tried 3@H over 2NT or 3@D|pg||
nt|baldfriede: because you said S was a she|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: major suit battle here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South is a female, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@D did not go only one down on board 4, it went three down doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: for a further pick-up of 12 imps for Team Zang|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Strääf didn't find a double in the same position as Wrang did (2@H-4@H) and that cost Zang 11 imps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: finally we might see a game contract|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some discussion maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: West thought 1@H showed @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Was a normal contract and will potentially be 5 imps or so to Team Yoda|pg||
nt|bt: nicely done, and slam was worse if dummy has @D4 and decl the 2 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: board 3 was a push as 3NT was let through at the other table as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Extremely important|pg||
nt|harmon: probaly respond 1s with 5-5 than auction different|pg||
nt|ritong: if 1@h is xfer, chances are 1@s is as well|pg||
nt|ritong: well, next:)|pg||
nt|chorush: now an overtick imp to Deutsch|pg||
nt|chorush: with a high diamond lead the contract was makable but quite difficult|pg||
nt|reisig: This seems like a @h part score|pg||
mb|1H|nt|runnerup:  south will keep west out of @s so..|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So survives the bid. Admittedly West had a lot of kings and queens for a game that can only lose two tricks.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
mb|d|nt|po-s: 1NT?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: not the best of slams here for  N/S, but it will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: For running scores, visit: http://tinyurl.com/cpx9t65|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so the case is now with the TD|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we'll go on|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: multi 2@D here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok thats why he bid 1nt -no support |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: As you might have noticed EW play the most natural version of the forcing pass, letting all one openings be 4+ although limited|pg||
nt|muppe: yeah, the only thing that really matters...|pg||
nt|kattbridge: well, 130 or 150 doesn´t matter when you had 500 in your bag:)|pg||
nt|harmon: enthusiastic 6d in OR|pg||
mb|2H|nt|underdogg:  both pass and 1@c shows 0-7/17+|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT   a possibility here |pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to imagine how they can bid to 6@D, though|pg||
nt|baldfriede: but will they find it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he tried to bid as if he had opened 1@C|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cards still sitting nicely 7 @d on cards -6 ok to bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: H/C|pg||
nt|chorush: Drew is a prettty sound bidder so Krekorian will have some reasons to consider bidding|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzft: ... probably not|pg||
nt|po-s: how  do you make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Inventive opening by W|pg||
nt|milton_se:  good slam - one finesse out of two|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A lot of penalty VP's have been dealt out during the last three days as teams havn't been finished on time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  1@c as respons to pass opening|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy 3nt here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so moysian 2 @d which playes well|pg||
nt|bt: in theory south has a clear pass, partner couldnt act over 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: not that it explains that much :)|pg||
nt|turnip1:  yes, in a strange way...|pg||
nt|ady: double|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: so much for that :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hey ns has found a game 2ntX-makes ---but south run |pg||
nt|jcwla:  Would have liked more prime round-suit holdings, an ace or a void. And the @SA would have been nice for @D.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  3N is better than 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Typically 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  1@d = 0-7 now|pg||
nt|underdogg:  1@h 20+|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Just the auction s was hoping for.|pg||
nt|po-s: hearts will work but you may try spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  safe level 140|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@S is non-forcing, stronger hands would bid 1@H first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It takes finding the queen of trumps to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: That might indeed cost the victory now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  biercard also here 7 @d -bidding and play -can you have 2 biers if you bid and it is last also|pg||
pc|hK|nt|runnerup:  something to guess here -best if you find @h J |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 140?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Not that obvious after the take out from West|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nilsland:  3NT was made by Larsson|pg||
nt|nilsland:  on the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: she got a diamond-lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not that it helps that much|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But they'll get to the spade game|pg||
nt|bt: yes i prefer @H, please dont take it seriously|pg||
nt|bt: now, he is tempted .... can partner have spades? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I don't think you deserve two beers for bidding this grand missing the @dK :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not here but in principe |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And also, in Sweden at least, it doesn't count if diamonds is trump. Is that a local rule or does it work that way world wide?|pg||
nt|muppe: South has nice controls, he should support @d now|pg||
nt|milton_se:  South has an excellent hand now - North showing 5-card @Ds, I presume|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 4+, but still|pg||
pc|hT|nt|underdogg:  0-4/5-7bal 1@s|pg||
nt|underdogg:  2@c game forceing now from W|pg||
nt|runnerup:  open cards it is easy to beat by @d ruffs |pg||
nt|rodal f: Still the warning came by 3NT, but team and IMPs cost.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: passing the buck|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I would have chosen 2NT over 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Any thoughts?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Might go overboard here.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i thk W was right in pushing his p to bid nt in view of his black suit holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@H = @S, 1NT = 17-19 bal (upgraded)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: once again east was too timid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @d small best now|pg||
nt|kattbridge: Tommy, where are the red card?|pg||
nt|harmon: Lotsa competitive bidding in OR so another big swing to Larsen|pg||
nt|reisig: Unlikely to balance w 4-3-3-3|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|underdogg:  since 1NT would have been 21-23, 2NT should show 24-25 something :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  110|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sorry|pg||
nt|bt: can east be balanced?|pg||
nt|chorush: 3NT looks like it might make with the location of the heart ace and the club blockage|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|runnerup:  imanigation notist -it is obvious bid .don't you think -and -not for children -that's ehy this brake|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Sorry for that, the client crashed|pg||
nt|kattbridge: well if you don´t want to defend you shuold not double|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Like I said, they hate to be predictable|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Curious 3@s bid|pg||
nt|chorush: It might be beaten by a club lead and a heart switch|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzft: On  1, Hans-Ove won 5 imps for making 1NT in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/89xozn4 for running scores|pg||
nt|mamos:  WEst had a strong  hand  too strong to just bid game also  but you were right uncomfortable now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but 5@D is also a make so EW will only lose an overtrick imp or so|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Or ....|pg||
nt|kattbridge: electicity back:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|runnerup:  but I am still wandering if pass to 1 @s gets better score |pg||
nt|ady: can only see 8 tricks  if playing clubs early  dropping JX |pg||
nt|reisig: Who made up these hands?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: np, just wondered if you saw something I didn't :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Maybe North could suggest 3N over 3@S?|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Definitely.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos:  as long as they stop :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In case of doubt lead trumps.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  migth have been 80 -if 13. @d will have been switched in rigth moment but not now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so safe level was the idea|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But he does not know partner has hearts too|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Easier for us|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: perhaps he finds Jx of heart a bit scary|pg||
nt|runnerup:  he don't use that card so much -thats why asked (6@h) important for some and bier you can think for any reasons|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oliverc: this looks to have been well judged by both pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 8 tricks  other table tied  4-4 in tricks after same auction|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzft: If he's 8 -12|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Despite the lead directing 1@d - he gets a club lead :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  A stopper is as strong as you make it look like|pg||
nt|ady: 4 clubs 2 hearts with the finesse  1 spade and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: can't he take the diamonds with the heart Q as an entry?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|underdogg:  If someone wants to know more about the system E/W are playing, here's a link: http://bridge.winge.se/mediawiki/index.php/Symetriskt_RelÃ¤pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR play 2@S at B15. Looks like a 1IMPer for Scania.|pg||
nt|chorush: no, not really, the dummy would wind up endplayed with xxx of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: ah, I see and would only have taken 8 tricks at that point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: so I'm back to the other table|pg||
nt|chorush: heart lead was a killer, attacking the transportation between the hand such as it was|pg||
nt|chorush: had some computer problems of my own|pg||
nt|chorush: once upon a time, a finesse worked. I think declarer will take the hearts and the spade ace and hope diamonds are friendly|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|sunsamvar: yes P is showing 16 to 19 and he should want to be in game if he is 17,18 or 19.. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: curtains|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this looks like one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and Wrang-Bergdahl have a huge set this far|pg||

pc|d2|nt|muppe: good bidding|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos:  Yes  we seem to have reached the limit of the hand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|runnerup:  declarer swets more if north leads @d J|pg||
nt|baldfriede: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Until proven guilty|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Well...Do both @D's go away now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  in a court of law with Jordan as a presecutor|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  prosecutor even|pg||
nt|jcwla:  persecutor|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|bt: then he had a guess here|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  I plead not guilty|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7 tricks|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but you make this also missguessing so only overtricks|pg||
nt|po-s: really?|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Third-seat bids, especially third-seat white-on-red bids, have such a strong lead-directing connotation that I have a simple rule:|pg||
nt|runnerup:  that double to 4 @s scares south a bit -clever double with singleton|pg||
nt|milton_se:  Team SanSac back in business now- from 12-18 to 16-14|pg||
nt|po-s: om man nu ska täcka så tror jag kungen är bättre|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|nilsland:  Still only 3 IMP between the two "hottest" pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1NT -1 picked up 12 against 2@S +1 at the other tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Larsson-Berthaeu and Forsberg-Grönkvist gaining 6|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Maybe he should have opened 1@C to get a diamond lead|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|runnerup:  no -still makes sorry yes|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did anybody analyze play if @C return rather than @D ruff?|pg||

pc|d6|nt|bigtrain: same result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was it a tradeoff?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: both lead to -2|pg||

nt|harmon: excellent slam here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i also have trouble choosing 6 vs half-dozen|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos:  ew may bid game here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: though I don't speak Swedish|pg||
nt|ritong: they woulod certainly find it if left to themselves|pg||
nt|ritong: but here, @ss will obstruct their auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: best bid here would be 3@S showing a 3-suiter, GF|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: :)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: it will be, i am betting my old slippers on it|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  What was unlucky about it?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but as in many cases Fredin made rigth decisions and his contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Nyström-Upmark kom i 5@C på bricka 3 och vann därmed 10 imp|pg||
nt|ady: can make 4@S     defence cant get 2 club tricks  one goes on the 3rd heart  |pg||
nt|ady: assume the 4 diamonds  shows 10 red cards  e/w not too fussy on suit quality at high levels|pg||
nt|ritong: they have a variante on that theme|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they may play 3@H as showing the same thing|pg||
nt|chorush: 1C=17+|pg||
nt|chorush: 1D=0-8|pg||
nt|pef: 1nt can be beaten, but in practice probably won't be|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bt:  they probably play 1nt conventional|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt best here but may end up in 4@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if west can hold him self quited -he may have the previlise to defende not play @s|pg||
nt|jcwla:  South has a clear pass now. The opening was dubious enough.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i would guess it does (jumping in the suit below the singleton|pg||
nt|pef: some would have used garbage stayman in by sutherlin's hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|nilsland:  Interersting pass by N - very disciplined|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West can make 2 H but N may try 2N|pg||
nt|kemperg: no dbl , only 2@Ds|pg||
nt|runnerup:  how wrong I was - 1 @s wasn't in my mind -double perhaps was ,,not perfect double of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT might be Raptor|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@h is a constructive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: You're quite right|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Nice bid by W to show some values.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It doesn't neccessarily have to be unlucky|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petka:  I wonder if double is for penalties here? Or is it takeout?|pg||
nt|chorush: 1S= 12d force; with many it could be a four card suit|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|petka:  should be penalties|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: They haven't played with each other for long so I don't know if they have discussed it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This will be exciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Rimstedt-Grönkvist leading, both other tables made 3NT on 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Their cc doesn't mention any unusal 1NT-overcall that I can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/TA1.pdf|pg||

nt|kattbridge: maybe 4 @H X is a better affair|pg||
nt|chorush: 1 rd force|pg||
nt|pef: notice that gary hayden followed with the 6 of diamonds so that john lusky can't know his partner has only 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|runnerup:  if south passes he bids 1@s and later 2 @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Think after the last two boards, EW will not get away as easy again|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't take much to foresee a slam from west|pg||
nt|bigtrain: grand even opposite @DAQ @HA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wygbe1: cheap save in 4d over 3n for ns|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: what about 6@c on this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is a standard 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Both 6@D and 6@S make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Cards aren't situated brilliantly for EW|pg||
nt|bt: this is in sweden known as "polish scissors" 55any, less than an opening bid|pg||
nt|bigtrain: west pass is forcing|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petka:  If this is it, then W must be careful to start with a low heart to the 9. But w must also set up the spades without aloowing a ruff in north hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Declarer may misplay it thou - you must duck the club|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: W knows E has @C lenght and cd have bid the vul 3 nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: bye all|pg||
nt|runnerup:  east has bad suit but so much that he didn't want to pass -common situation with 5 @c -very dangerous but many bids -life is dangerous|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2NT is a rather nice bid, correctly interpreted it will lead to 3@D making|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|oliverc: On best defence, 3@S the limit here, but easy enough for NS to let 4@S through,|pg||
nt|oliverc: though, especially if South tries to cash @D tricks rather than leading their singleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: @H|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: in common tongue, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: in bridge circles it's appliable to loads of situations :)|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grabel didn't bid with west hand|pg||
nt|pef: good play by john, now they can beat the contract|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|runnerup:  ok conventional 1nt -killed that bid -now needs to stop in time -should make on 3-level |pg||
nt|baldfriede: S wonders if his 8 would be enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: making 4@S on 17 was worth another 10 imps to NS here, now ahead by 11 in the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: thing is, this might now make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it can but line is far from obvious|pg||
nt|ritong: major missund here|pg||
nt|kareno: Could a wheel have fallen off here?|pg||
nt|harmon: win 1 imp|pg||
nt|bigtrain: always nice to have the wheels fall off and still win an IMP :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Feldman says no agreement|pg||
nt|harmon: 2 if no sp lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Did 3@h show a singleton spade with 4441, Walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i concur with that evaluation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wager  walter agrees with stayman|pg||
nt|bigtrain: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wait -- you agree with PASS??|pg||
nt|bigtrain: clear pass for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for me too, but i thought you'd argue that there is possible vul game when partner has 4/5@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: opposite most maximum i would guess you would be lucky to make 1 in 5 games|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: screen down; Stansby and Casen having a discussion |pg||
pc|h2|nt|oliverc: looks good, and it's right-sided now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: You might misplay hearts after the overcall, perchance?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but here Scania can get some back|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hmmm...  what else would they lead harmon?  :)|pg||
nt|ritong: as expected, @ss were pesty, even when was able to tell his shape precisely|pg||
nt|harmon: we assume it did|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: The trap didn't fall|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: trump shift?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well, this tells N where the @h are|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i meant not|pg||
nt|jcwla:  This will hold and S will exit a @S in preference to breaking either round suits. Remember as defender, you should avoid breaking new suits unless it's very likely to be right.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Usually kicks half a trick or more each time you do.|pg||
nt|ritong: +east*|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can't say for sure but i assume it did (jumping in suit below singleton)|pg||
nt|chorush: I expect Bramley to make a minimum of 9 tricks on this hand and even 10 seem possible|pg||
nt|chorush: Because of some viewgraphy problems we may not see the complete play|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South accidently dropped the jack of spades on the table. Director has been called|pg||
nt|bt:  accoridng to cc they dont play conventional 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Sjöberg is taking the bull by the horns|pg||
nt|bigtrain: al, i actually think that 3NT would have better chances than 4@S on an 8fit with that hand as a dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct:  well he has 8 certain tricks so choices are find the @H10 or the @CQ or let the opponents find one of those card for you|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell don't bother to show the 3-suiters that include 4 of there suit...  thus jump Q = 3-suits short in their suit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzft: ... He is therefore forced to play the jack of spades now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  coffee one /without this opening =2@h nothing to talk |pg||
nt|jcwla:  Hmm|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: 2@SX would have costed.|pg||
nt|chorush: Bart is an extremely good technician so he is going to be going through the various ways he can take 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lets say well found 1 @S then|pg||
nt|runnerup:  rigth but average pair rarely has spoken these serious |pg||
nt|runnerup:  should of cource|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This is the Swedish Championship finals, average pairs shouldn't have come this far|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Must have got a suit pref signal there somehow|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzft: and even without prior discussion you can calculate what it shows|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I am very surprised East passed|pg||
nt|ady: will lose 1 heart  1 club and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|reisig: 3NT seems like a "normal" spot|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzft: well bid and a deserved make is what we can expected|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcwla:  If so might as well have cashed @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS is known to be a very inventive pair at least|pg||
nt|chorush: start with diamnds, I think|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North perhaps simply chose to make an overcall on his nice 4c suit|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I think finessing in @h won t help you much anyway|pg||
nt|bt: on board 3 yoda gained 11 imps, though there was possibly a tactical hesitation by north, so director is called|pg||
pc|h6|nt|runnerup:  ok -sorry but lets say you have to 'nose' these places|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @s is optimistic and was it nessessary for south to bid 2 @s -perhpas not|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps|pg||
nt|runnerup:  was sugseeded that delayed raise shoe extra -this not -ok in that case 2 @s was the bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang counted South for 4@S (he thought they played support redoubles)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|runnerup:  every time I try that -partner has xx and 7 points -and we play there insteadt of 1nt +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The jack of hearts was costy|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I guess we're all born with different ammounts of luck :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  YES  South's line in 4@s on Board 17 in OR is a bit of a mystery  |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... but they missed slam on  5|pg||
nt|pef: allan falk has to lead a club now to beat the contract, otherwise john lusky gets endplayed|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzft: The question asked to the director now is wether it's ok by North to draw conclusions from South's switch, knowing it was forced|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: nose?|pg||
nt|kattbridge: so next time they have their bid :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems like the team names are reversed. Deustch usually plays for Deutsch|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|reisig: the @d 4 is the FST|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kemperg: friendly defense|pg||
nt|baldfriede: declarer apparently thinks the same|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d9|nt|vugraphzeg: West should have pitched a diamond on the club|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcwla:  Trump promotion coming|pg||
nt|milton_se:  nice|pg||
nt|runnerup:  makeable from here but needs the view|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: soon coming to the moment of truth|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|pef: tough little hand for both sides, but it's going to end up a push|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzft: In 4@h there's no reason to, indeed|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hm|pg||
nt|kattbridge: no problems:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|runnerup:  understand what is going on|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pef: well I spoke a bit prematurely, gary has to win this and exit with a heart and endplay john again, so the complexity isn't up yet|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jcwla:  With @D pitch|pg||
pc|h7|nt|runnerup:  4nt (down 4) was only -2 imps -other table in 3nt|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nilsland:  Rimstedt is in the lead before this board|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos:  declarer doing well here  maybe too well ofor his own peace of mind|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mrdct:  west needed to cash the @CQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzft: I still can't see how 2NT can possibly be natural :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is more and more looking like a comedy of errors|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Dave.. no harm in that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed, you have to give up on suits when out of viable entries|pg||

nt|baldfriede: hm, should have been an overtrick. N/S have no way of cashing their @h trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South's only chance was play for AK with East|pg||
nt|mrdct:  6@H and 6NT are good here for NS|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 6@H is a great contract here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang says he would have made if the AK of @C would have stood up|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Was down one in the end anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But could have been more gory|pg||
nt|bt: the ns pair plays 2nt as "9-11 (semi)balanced, no 4 major, not mandatory" :)|pg||
nt|bt: unluckily west will open first here|pg||
nt|bt: and he has a major|pg||
nt|bt: meanwhile ns at the other table took a toilet break, during bidding, unusual|pg||
nt|bt: we have a fire alarm in the hotel, so play is closed right now|pg||
nt|bt: maybe fredin was very upset over the hesitation|pg||
nt|bt: there is supposedly a fire there, lets hope everyone is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Uheld|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/83yevtx for running scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: He could have made by ruffing with the nine or jack of spades instead of pitching|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes this beats really true no entry -was so clever defence that rarely seen |pg||
nt|milton_se:  good play from both sides|pg||
nt|runnerup:  very soon|pg||
nt|kareno: So here Feldman had almost enough information anyway.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think he was trying for grand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't need much|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: team names are reversed here, so IMPs going to the wrong team.  Apologies, but not easy to fix until the next segment|pg||
nt|pef: that took a long time and this table is over 5 boards behind the open room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzft: he claimed 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: which means he played the queen of hearts from hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras have picked up 4 more imps on 16 and 17 for an undoubled undertrick vs one doubled and one undertrick vs two|pg||
nt|ritong: a not-so-rare accident with strong@c, when opener does not show a suit at opening and opponents preempt violently|pg||
nt|kareno: Nope... one more ace.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: sorry had 4 in mind|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S not friedly but.......|pg||
nt|turnip1:  Now 4 teams within 3.3 VP|pg||
nt|reisig: slam hand..for sure|pg||
mb|1S|nt|runnerup:  partial only here @s /@d but lets see if more in bidden|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  After all the effort we have to put in to teach novices to finesse, we have to put in even more to teach them when not to.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  a solid 6 @s here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6nt the same|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand   |pg||
nt|kareno: But when you are so squeezed in the auction, perhaps it's better to make a bid that avoids misunderstandings|pg||
nt|bigtrain: competing vs new partnerships is usually productive...  established partnershis, not so much|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nilsland:  She is used to play with Micke :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: even though with a duck of the lead, it's making|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I'd rather not interfe as S here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: interfere*|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here I agree with South's bud|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: *bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: you're 5-5 with decent intermediates|pg||
nt|po-s: om Väst skulle ha ru Qx så vore andra vändor inte så bra|pg||
mb|2S|nt|underdogg:  8-11 5+@d, no 4 card M, if only 5@d he will have 4@c as well.|pg||
nt|kemperg: brave 3@D without @Hs|pg||
nt|runnerup:  to beat 3 @s you have to lead @h Ace|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol and an eight count|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: you take away the two-level from your opponents|pg||
nt|oliverc: very true|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A 12-15 NT, not that common|pg||
nt|runnerup:  standard 3nt ..continues|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with all the controls i guess Sundell shd prefer the @H contract|pg||
nt|mrdct:  6NT is quite a bit better as you can survive 7-1 @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3@H is slaminvitational w/o ShS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/86gquww for running scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: E: "At least I'm entertainment!"|pg||
nt|kareno: Double would not be negative by Feldman, rather penalty (spec asked)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ;)|pg||
nt|ritong: pass and pull certainly was his strongest possible move|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the last auction?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|chorush: Onstott has optimal result in other room|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzft: 2@S = a bad raie|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: *raise|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west is not afread -2 @c majors -so can east holm him self low|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzft: I'd say it was more the competition in its whole's fault. Then of course we had boards of our own that made the whole difference. But yes, it was rather annoying that everything ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: would end with that board...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tough lead for E|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i can count 10 hcp, and it's not like partner is going to punish me when he's pre-passed|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Uheld is Danish|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Interesting, double or 1NT with N? I think 1NT esp since we have seen 1@C could be short.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but don't he finess @h then |pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: pretty routine hand|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: indeed not|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i guess he'll just launch into keycards now|pg||
nt|smispi: sempre uguale|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  4H looks nice here|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR B17 ended as here in 3NT with a @S lead. Looks as a push.|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  some carefull play needed like @c Ace and @h away now after @h A|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: could E make a take out now?|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Now with known 8-card fit E will probably bid 2@H.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  skall inte sitsen vara klar sÃ¥ dags?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i assume they are playing inverted pass-double|pg||
nt|pef: five hearts is a good sacrifice, but pretty impossible for e/w to find at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzft: Hi again! After having evacuated the hotel due to fire, we're back and ready to play|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Welcome to Markku|pg||
nt|jcwla:  This just seems to be guesswork.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: He passes with the words: "I'm too tired"|pg||
nt|turnip1:  And these 4 meet in final round|pg||
nt|smispi: sorry|pg||
nt|harmon: Danooooooo|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem, dano  just jump in amigo|pg||
nt|chorush: well, maybe not|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nilsland:  3Nt is also making|pg||
nt|runnerup:  no double -ok but some of|pg||
nt|mamos:  it might be your opponents who punish you :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Might have pushed EW into 4@H which partner can double|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Only 8 tricks here, unles there is a miracle|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@C = GF relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = 4@S, 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The show must go on!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Perhaps not the best argument but|pg||
nt|po-s: he should have, but who knows|pg||
nt|ady: as long as K@C not played on a club switch now  will make|pg||
nt|harmon: Carbonara first tho dear|pg||
nt|ritong: sounds reasonable|pg||
nt|kareno: East marked with just about all the high cards, of course.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seem to be an overabundance of 41 trump splits today|pg||
nt|chorush: looks like this heading for down 2 and -200|pg||
nt|pef: we are seeing why bridge is unlikely to make it on network television again :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|baldfriede: unless*|pg||
nt|baldfriede: May be less.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if the opponents catching you is what you're worried about you should compare that to all the upsides of acting|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i dont think that it is easy to bid -claiming in declarer play is easy|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: N has shown 45+/54+ in the minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Slam is on the heart guess here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Nilsson paused for some time over 1@H, might give the show away|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @d the best spot|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzft: 2NT = short clubs (4531/4540)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Dave if S can find out his P having the @Dj orany of the black queens|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The fire was not so big but could be put out pretty fast|pg||
nt|ady: now will make whatever|pg||
nt|ritong: check @ds, claim 11|pg||
nt|kareno: Atta way, Henri :)|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: subtle pun:)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petka:  the spade situation allows 3NT as well, but 4H looks like a great spot|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But there is the Chinese art of Wu Wei - acting by not acting. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: lol :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this lead was not a success|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @d asking for longer major|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Killing lead = @H9 :)|pg||
nt|kattbridge: I guess Fredin finds it|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  With his reputation|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: That would be very interesting :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  he has QJ103 in clubs -if he leads @h 9 I aprisiate|pg||
nt|po-s: he has done it from ace but declarer then put up king|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  so if he leads a club, ha can't have the @HA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzft: 1@S-2NT, 4@H (void)-4NT, 5@H-6@S would be a rather standard sequence to the top spot|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so in a good day 6 @d |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This has chances|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nilsland:  Declarer dont know who has the @DA so will maybe play for clubs|pg||
nt|oliverc: the only lead not to give a trick away, but East will be continually endplayed here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This looks just as good|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is not a good day|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: not the most successful lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think south will bid 6@H to protect his @DKx or @CKxx depending on which ace is missing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and with 1 key card missing the side suit kings are vulnerable on the opening lead in a NT Contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: At the other table slam was missed after a brave 2@D multi by West|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so 11 more imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
nt|mrdct:  assuming 4@c was a cue, south knows that the missing keycard is the @DA as partner didn't bid 4@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: brave indeed... fortune favoured ..|pg||
nt|po-s: so question is  has he ever done it from queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: walter - once 44 fit is found, do you have a way to give opener choice of 4M/3N?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: after a NT opener...  no|pg||
nt|bigtrain: after a neb...  yes|pg||
nt|reisig: The last lead ...from me :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nilsland:  and could go down then|pg||
nt|runnerup:  easyer now |pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzft: if South, like North, thought 4@H promised a void|pg||
nt|bt: hey just dont realize its a standard 3nt|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Frederic decided he did'nt want to misguess|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|petka:  after 2S and showing AKxxxx spades I guess she knows where the DA is :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  So South should play another spade|pg||
nt|runnerup:  should duck first as cards lay-now 4-0 in trumps beats|pg||
nt|bt: they|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzft: i haven't had the chance to read what 3@D is|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north is very weak for opening and south optimist|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 4@C set @D, 4@D = minimum, 4@H RKC, 4NT = 1/4 and 5@C asked for the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|bt: north has an opening hand in most systems, except roth-stone|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 6 imps went "Sivves" way when 2@H went down in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Many people tell me it's a make now, and I agree|pg||
nt|kareno: We don't make no safety plays :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting idea posited in one chat    3OM = 4-fit with either slam ambition OR COG with bad trump|pg||
nt|bigtrain: there just isn't enough room after a NT opener to do everything|pg||
nt|reisig: won't matter|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nilsland:  and look like a woman with the @DA|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but clearly, this was enough as North risked a raise|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Perhaps W could find a double here to show real @C's|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but we should remember we're seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|po-s: really|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang unhappy when the table came down|pg||

nt|oliverc: Ooops, huge swing for NS as the other table bid to 7NT-2 on  3|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on  19 EW went down in 4@S at the other table|pg||
nt|runnerup:  West missed the play -he had his contract if he take 2. @s trick but counted otherwise|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Some impressive guessing there by Eliazohn.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Or finding I should say.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hmm, the slam on board 16 was bid at the other table - but misplayed for 13 imps to Scania|pg||
nt|ady: avoided heart fines as it went|pg||
nt|ady: finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: 12*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correction   "not necessarily bad trumps, just a flattish hand with secondary cards"|pg||
nt|chorush: 2 imps to deutsch will make it 15 with 7 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: another 3n available|pg||
nt|ady: north has to open as more than 7 and less than 17|pg||
nt|bigtrain: there really isn't enough room to squeeze in all the shapes...  if you just have slam vs COG than it wuld work...  but then you lose all the splinter raises|pg||
mb|1C|nt|runnerup:  but 140 could be other door -if south doesn't bid so can be + score|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR B18 ended ar here. 4@H. A new push I belive.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: a perfect yarborough even. if anything about a yarborough can be perfect, that is|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @d needa  view 5 is ok|pg||
nt|runnerup:  needs |pg||
nt|kareno: Nice auction OR where Mohan was able to ask for a singleton.|pg||
nt|reisig: wow 2@s |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: is the West hand an overcall for you?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yoda is still in the lead while Kamras have lost a few against San Sac: http://tinyurl.com/86gquww|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: (9:2)|pg||
nt|chorush: 6 spades is a subpar slam but certainly an easy make as the cards lie|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: they took a short break|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzft: 7 imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Would be interesting to let that stand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  lol  I was only teasing  - Im sure you are right - It's true especially that you can bid 2@S  taking up all the \two \level space that makes bidding on this hand so attractive :)  certainly worked well herre|pg||
nt|baldfriede: W has a bomb shell fter partner S OPENING|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the 1@hx, I meant|pg||
nt|runnerup:  too late for @c .maybe if you start with @c you can beat that -ok partial figth here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzeg: This doesn't look too hard|pg||
nt|baldfriede: AFTER+|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: would be very impressed with West if he found a pass :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  strange system -no stoppimg place in 3 @c seems so|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in board 16 the other table in 6 @c but missplayed -ruffed 3 @s to table -for some reason |pg||
nt|ady: there is no game for e/w   even 1@H undoubled is good for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: routine 4@H here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i guess even slam might make with this incredibly lucky lie of the cards|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes.. 5-4 and 5 controls and Sis a 3rd hand opener|pg||
nt|jcwla:  The 4@S making on 17 was 11 to Kamras.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  3NT-1 in OR.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  On the @S-@D big two-suiter.|pg||
nt|muppe: Strange that N didnt balance with both majors here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/86gquww for running scores|pg||
nt|chorush: I don't know whether 2H is accurate or not. If it is it is conventional|pg||
nt|pef: you can tell this is the senior trials, these days everyone under 50 decides to open the north hand 1nt playing 15-17|pg||
nt|pef: 1 heart showed at least 4 spades|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: Are N strong enough for 3@S? He graded down.|pg||
nt|kemperg: N has to downgrade, 4333 and to much quacks|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i see :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i look at the bad suit of only five cards and say it's not even close|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i prefer both pass and double to 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: double would work out great this time as we get to diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Not the luckiest of breaks on this board either|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Will probably result in two down|pg||
nt|milton_se:  comes off cheap, though - just 150 or so|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: If you weren't with us before and have reacted on the strange bidding methods: Both pairs play forcing pass|pg||
nt|harmon: 4s can be beaten on a trump lead I think|pg||
nt|chorush: it has been alerted as a utility; presumably some kind of mark time bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: 2s simply means the north hand has a minimum raise with 4 trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  4 @s looks = now only bid -west surely cant pass to 1 @s -he did|pg||
nt|kemperg: no score on board 5 also in 3NT instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|kemperg: un expected pass|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west had 16 hcp -pass was covards bid -some bid must be there -1nt /2c --no pass|pg||
nt|runnerup:  now has to avoid sing lead|pg||
nt|kattbridge: finns det annat ! än det under 1 :an?|pg||
nt|po-s: över?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: neb = nebulous 1@D opener (part of precision)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: COG = choice of games|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Right u are Germ|pg||
nt|mamos:  @cQ is a very big card|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@S 1st-in-hand on that distributed pile of rubbish? I hate it! LOL|pg||
nt|mamos:  me too how horrid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on this lead lead, it looks hard to make 12 tricks however|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but no|pg||
nt|jcwla:  W has some clues not to go on now with @H double by N, probable balanced hand in E, no raise by S.|pg||
nt|kattbridge: ja, men jag har gamla versonen av bbo, nedladdade programmet|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: can he make this?|pg||
nt|kattbridge: tack alla som hjälper icke datanörd:)|pg||
nt|kareno: West can get in only once but that could be enough.  |pg||
nt|chorush: likely, when followed by spades it will show some kind of good 2 spade raise|pg||
nt|pef: playing transfers over a non-forcing 1c opening is an increasingly popular treatment these days|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kattbridge: @H|pg||
nt|po-s: BRA!|pg||
nt|pef: but the end result should be another fairly dull push|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: Or we was wrong:)|pg||
nt|kattbridge: tuff des. for tommy, he´ll raise, and the ns has to get  their 5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chorush: in 3 bids, Stansby has bi suits in which heholds a total of 4 cards:)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mamos:  EW  not enjoying this  set much |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I expect most to not open the East hand in a natural system|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here it might drive partner to slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H is ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs careful play however|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i guess it depends on what partner counts you for, vul against not all my partners will expect way more than this when it comes to suit quality/trick taking potential|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true M... but exchange the @SA and @Ha and 4@H is a nice vul game..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think heart 9 and run it, then discard on spade return|pg||
nt|kattbridge: and now, ein hattrick|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sunsamvar: that cud be missed ina 1@S p 2@S sequence|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this lead doen't hurt -@s and you have some work for sure|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Time to get a @S on the table.|pg||
nt|reisig: I'll stop commenting ..if you'd like|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzft: 2@D showed some different hands, a weak jump shift in @H was one possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, Sivve might get back the imps they could lose on the last board on this|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS clearly did too much on this board|pg||
nt|chorush: anyone who knows what is gong on is perfectly welcome to tell me|pg||
pc|dA|nt|baldfriede: I don't see how to avoid slam now|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 4NT was bid and interpreted as a signoff|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: which helped the cause|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, oh. I'll eat my words|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: they might sneak this if quickly making a 2nd heart|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|oliverc: A classic case of North just being too busy|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: it's not like I would pass that out if I pass the first time :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but then u have to come in at the 3 level :)|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Don't see the rush for a @C lead considering it's basically a placeholder for them.|pg||
nt|pef: I was asked the advantage of the method.  a few things.  first it lets the normally stronger hand be declarer more often.  second, like most transfers, it adds a bit more bidding ...|pg||
nt|pef: room in some auctions.  the disadvantage is that it gives the opponents some more bids to compete with|pg||
pc|s6|mc|10|nt|chorush: I have beentold that 3D shows spades and heart shortness and that cuebids followed|pg||

nt|rodal f: A spec told me that Ns hand are wourt 13,15 if u go at KNR. Agree him.|pg||
nt|kemperg: W could see 8 black tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS have missed two games but did good on the slam hand|pg||
nt|baldfriede: very close match now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if you open 2nt -minors and has no way to stop in 3 @c when partner is weak that is strange .speculiar -not common what ever you call it|pg||
nt|jcwla:  That defense probably will not make EW's career highlight reel.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  NS are due somewhere between 420 and 500 here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: San Sac stopped in 3NT and won 11 imps on the potential slam board|pg||
nt|muppe: unlikely though but possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well other room still stopped in 2N but it seemed worthy of quick chat|pg||
nt|chorush: give Krekorian some credit for his subtle lie with his club cards|pg||
nt|reisig: Passell made a V good bid there|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Strong @C to come|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here EW in the open room did well to bid the cold 4@S, NS then took the sacrifice in 5@C for 300|pg||
nt|jcwla:  N may have a 5-over-5 decision and as usual it will be wrong to go on.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  surely wd -not the best lead but still was many dangers -here 4 @s and this vulnerability ew can to nothing over it|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Larry Cohen has a great quote about how often it is wrong to bid 5 over 5 when you're thinking about it: "Yes, even this hand!"|pg||
nt|reisig: another .."easy" 7-5-1 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: i'm sorry for dozing off a little|pg||
mb|1N|nt|runnerup:  hmm -yes makes ok|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S = @C or @D and @H ??|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Ida|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: quality of suits havn't been defined :)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: looks like yet another 3n available for ns|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Despite the miss a good board for EW|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I would open @s hand here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the only reasons not to ould be 44 in majors over 1m opener or being a fraidycat at unfavorable valnerabilty  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 1@D = 8 -11, 4M and 4+m/bal/55+ ms|pg||
nt|pef: the method was very common in Europe before it got adopted by many top american pairs.  goes along with opening 1c on almost all weak nt hands|pg||
mb|2D|nt|baldfriede: S, not @s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i prefer 3@D, assuming that is not strong|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3NT E here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = 10-13|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@d ..not my style|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  if nothing else -at least imtersting system -keeps you on your toes all the time |pg||
nt|jcwla:  Oy.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Was South invited to the party?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  they don't believe books or Cohen ..5 over 5|pg||
nt|jcwla:  "Who sent for you?"|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  He has no idea of what 4@Swas based on|pg||
nt|jcwla:  The preemptor's job after preempting is to allow it to do its work.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  In stony silence.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  pre-empter has time to go to toilet =pass ..but not here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the fascinating thing about bidding 5 over 5 is that you tend to remember that 1 in 10 times it was right to do it|pg||
nt|harmon: George and 3 chairs :) heh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how does anyone get to this perfecta 5@D?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but we both know that vulnerabilty is for children :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems as they are by the vul - non vul + stretched a bit:)|pg||
nt|po-s: are you sure?|pg||
nt|pef: west in the open room chose to double the forcing 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But this one is not nearly as good as the others|pg||
nt|oliverc: .|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hm, is it that cold on @h lead?|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi again all|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: finesse diamonds and pitch a heart?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Four rounds of trumps?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: the team names are reversed here, so it is really the Deutsch team that is gaining this quarter|pg||
pc|h4|nt|baldfriede: They may land in 4@h though, with a loser in each suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South showed 12-14 bal. with 2 or 3 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North chose between pass and 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I'm pretty sure inviting game was not an option|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: N cud have made a second bid as S confirmed 3 @Hs i thk|pg||
nt|mamos:  North's actions quite reasonable  Imagine p opened a weak NT  you would not want  to bid much with North|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/89xozn4 for running scores by the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South did not in any way promise 3@H|pg||
nt|baldfriede: with 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@c asks if East has 4c supp|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yes|pg||
nt|po-s: about 3 x clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They opened 2@D multi earlier|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sunsamvar: oh 1@H cud be a doubleton?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, hard to fault norths pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: yes, all the balanced 12-14:s bid 1@H if they don't have 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: That would probably have lead to 4@s on NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East invited game with 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this might at least be a little interesting :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and when it comes to the bidding i prefer 1@S to 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the 4-4 fit usually produces an extra trick and all that|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Is 7-1-4-1 a possible holding for the 3@S bid? Okay, then partner contemplated you might have it. If it's not, your bid was wrong to begin with.|pg||
nt|kattbridge: but does it show 6-5?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kemperg: bidding I ment, but wiil make too|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR B18 I was total wrong. 10IMP for Carbonnier and new leader again.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS agrees: "Don't try this at home"|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: oh, sorry PO :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: silence never won fair maiden|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: not very exiting    8 or 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Normal to pass here because the most you can have is two balanced hands adding to 25 hcp.  |pg||
nt|kareno: But perhaps vulnerable George Jacobs will stretch to game with his nice assortment of honors but without a source of tricks.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: momentary oops from net, George claimed on last hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well seeing @DQ come down -- 6@D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|runnerup:  game is not good but makeable|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd try a dbl of 1nt first and then bid my @Ds to show points and long @Ds|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  If you don't think 3@S is enough, then open 4@S, but don't open 3 and bid again|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Having said all that, I've seen many worse 5-over-5 bids than this. But this will be costly: -100 against +500.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: +300 in 4@S X won Scania 11 imps when matched up with +200 in 3@D X by EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Pre-empting is all about quick in, quick out|pg||
nt|bt: three then a club i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or maybe three then a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hans-Ove has moved past San Sac: http://tinyurl.com/7rrm7az|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Still only 5.3 VP's between fourth and first|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nilsland:  3@D will not make|pg||
nt|oliverc: fair enough, then|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and 3 IMP's to your team? :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Automatic 1@h opener in Western Rabbit...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I only believe in the Easter bunny :)|pg||
nt|milton_se:  Three teams within 1.3 VP's right now|pg||
nt|po-s: no, my fault, should have addressed Tjolpe|pg||
nt|harmon: 10 imps back to jacobs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nilsland:  do you have his adress? :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzft: a direct 3@D as Martin said might work|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: lead down to one imp when Forsberg-Grönkvist went down in 5@C on 21|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry, 20|pg||
nt|runnerup:  needs good guesses |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|baldfriede: it makes then, but it is not the same as "cold"|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5 losers only but can you keep control and take 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|reisig: Should make|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: maybe a 2nd retraction -- are 12 tricks available??|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h5|nt|vugraphzft: East will then picture almost this hand exactly and can take a shot at game|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but it's easier seeing all the cards :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh  right no trump loser |pg||
nt|reisig: The only slam that is down is 6@s|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|wygbe1: great lead by west|pg||
nt|bt: why did he go down in 6nt? i was away|pg||
nt|bt: wasnt it like 12 on top?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he didn't want to go two down was his excuse|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|vugraphzft: double-dummy it is cold|pg||
pc|d6|nt|runnerup:  yes sometimes (even 1400 -seen here ) some days ago|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.bjeagle.se/bridge/resultat/damer/trial3.htm for running scores|pg||
nt|friggi: has to play for 3-3 pk 36/7%|pg||
nt|baldfriede: as you see they only take 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but they aren't in 4, a bit different|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on a heart switch or lead in 4@S, that's your only shot|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: more imps to the leaders|pg||
nt|bt: ok, makes perfect sense|pg||
nt|bt: or not|pg||
nt|turnip1:  no, needed Jx or Jxx in diamonds North|pg||
pc|c3|nt|santyclz2:  In Western Rabbit, all 10hcp are openers.  If you have a 4+card major you open in that regardless of minor suit length.  If 4-4 in the majors you open 1@h regardless of relative suit quality.|pg||
nt|kareno: spade finesse marked now|pg||
nt|kareno: With no diamond overcall from east, likely he'll play a club|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodal f: What would have happen if S didn't stretch his hand? |pg||
pc|d4|nt|bt: jxxx?|pg||
nt|pef: sutherlin has to play low now to beat 2d|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|baldfriede: well, if it is cold playing for the OT does not hurt :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|pef: now he has to play his heart or club|pg||
nt|pef: which he is likely to eventually do, because n/s already have 6 tricks and if lusky has the queen of diamonds he will always take two more tricks|pg||
nt|pef: so he has to play hayden for the queen of diamonds|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: NS bid and made 5@C on  4 for a pick-up of 10 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: sorry,   5|pg||
nt|oliverc: very true|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: losing two spades, two hearts, one diamond and one club|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @h with underpoint here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  Â¨points|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the slam on 19 was a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Nyström did prefer a NT-opening which lead to a Stayman sequence|pg||
nt|bt: 1 out of 2 finesses, sort of :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS in the other room missed the good 6@D after East once more had opened the bidding on a five count|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Hed Andersson spelar 6@D pÃ¥ 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Might determine the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you get to 5@D after nebulous 1@D opener?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mamos:  EWhave 25  but hard to see anything much on here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  still on previous board|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rodal f: Can't fail at a 3NT here|pg||
nt|jcwla:  It is okay to be on a maximum from time to time.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Vikings can't keep everything to themselves|pg||
nt|runnerup:  I am interested how 3 @h went off lets see|pg||
nt|runnerup:  chance for 7 imps if ns in @d |pg||
nt|ahollan1:  55  opening bid in other room ..... 3@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzeg: Disciplined pass på South|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3NT down when @H is played on time|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt is in danger if you find @h lead -a lot depence who is declarer|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: both souths passed |pg||
nt|runnerup:  you cant see it ok looks strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A misguess in spades perhaps?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes seems possible but you need to play @d 3 times ..but maybe|pg||
nt|runnerup:  up to 4-level|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like its routine since you will get high level @H bids|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzeg: *by|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good result for Sivves from open room|pg||
nt|friggi: % wise not so good|pg||
nt|baldfriede: one does not finesse first round if finnesing 2nd roujnd is enough. that way you get a slightly increased chance if a singleton Q is behind you|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: +620 is a nice result for Sivves from the open room|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and again partial -nearly pass out hands |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this will gain Hans-Ove some imps|pg||
nt|turnip1:  he could have made it this way though if N was void in diamonds...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@H was let through at the other table so Sivves won 13 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Tricky to find after an unnatural diamond opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and the championship|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but in other room final contract is 3@H East|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if South openes 1@D i doubt N will stop short of game|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos:  but surely it will be lattened at this table|pg||
nt|mamos:  flattened|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras won back 10 imps on  8 when they made 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: there is no complete record of the play but I think it was on a double squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It's unfortunately not possible to view the bidding from the other table since we had to close down the vugraph|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But ending up in 3NT rather than 4@h was well done|pg||
nt|jcwla:  misguessed @S's in OR after losing two @C's and 1 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/83yevtx for running scores|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes you open 1 @d and you have @d 's bad luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Now however, it's there|pg||
nt|muppe: does 2@s show both @s and @d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yes, it's natural with 5@d4@s|pg||
nt|milton_se:  must be so|pg||
nt|muppe: then N may compete to 4@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  @s lead beats also|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3 @s and 2 Aces|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3NT now  might get @C start|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, that 3nt appears to very wobbly to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i am not so sure about that, could go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i predict a push on this board as well|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: last hand west should not overruff wth ace near the end   will take 1 monre trick|pg||
nt|bigtrain: anyone opening 3@D with the soouth hand should lose their license to bid with precision :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stansby does not have prototypical 3@C bid|pg||
nt|reisig: ahh - a big @c  1@d opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla:  Not sure why Upmark volunteered to raise a level against silent opps.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Seems like a hand you can choose what to do later, you are not in fear of anything they might do.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They now have a healthy lead of 1.5 vp|pg||
nt|bt: yes of course, i forgot that|pg||
nt|chorush: got us a tie with 5 boards to go|pg||
nt|chorush: every trick is meaningful|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzft: They might end up in 4@H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: just to continue my streak of not bidding as the players, I consider that a 3@D opening :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: over an opening 3@D bid West wd bid @Cs and cross the 3nt level|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: which would have made matters a lot worse for EW|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt is a normal semi-psyche from south intending to run like a thief if he is doubled.|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: no way with 3 Aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: especially now on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  sorry i was looking at EW  cards   -- i hadnt got as far as looking at 5-0  break|pg||
nt|milton_se:  S should be short in @Hs to bid and Q@S is a good card|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Just like they did here|pg||
nt|muppe: wd NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  It still can be decided at the third table :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry everyone but I'm a bit nervous|pg||
nt|oliverc: struggling to see 8 tricks here, let alone 9|pg||
nt|pef: this is a chance for allan to shine.  every expert wants to have a hand where leading the queen from that heart holding beats the contract.  that turns out true here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nilsland:  3 @C is the contract you want to be in|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2@C = Gazili so 2@H = @H + @C|pg||
nt|oliverc: too much to do here, I suspect|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a loser in each suit perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but then again, it's important what partner will play you for|pg||
nt|harmon: club will beat it now|pg||
nt|kareno: Push unless Steve Beatty finds a club shift now.|pg||
nt|kareno: True but Jacobs did not play his lowest diamond asking for a club.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|runnerup:  still a little chance to go off -@h guess -after @s Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: you don't have to lose a spade|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Both sides are in for a surprise with a singleton K dropping|pg||
pc|h5|nt|oliverc: well a big swing in prospect, either way|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: wow :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  It was a hand similar to the s hand that allowed us to beat the mighty "Dallas Aces" in a short match in the 70s. We opened 1@h and got to 4@h vul, they opened 2@d  and played it there.  Everything broke and/or was onside and 4@h wrapped.|pg||
nt|bt: ns at the other table did really well getting to 4@H here|pg||
nt|pef: but even if he goes up with the j, he has to find the really hard play of ducking a club from dummy (or leading the J of clubs)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: isn't it likely that you lose two red tricks and two trump tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: correction, really well when it was making|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzeg: NS now tied for first|pg||
nt|wygbe1: could lose 2 diam ruffs, k of h, and club plus spade|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true.. but will get forced now|pg||
nt|mamos:  shortwning trumps wont be nice either|pg||
nt|friggi: duck|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 500|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: indeed|pg||
nt|ady: would need a favourable lay for this to make   and after the double  wont get it|pg||
nt|kareno: For the specs, when a singleton comes down in dummy, your responsibility is to tell partner what to shift to - low for low suit, high for high suit.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos:  this lead means defence are on track to defeat|pg||
nt|po-s: at the moment 1-2-3 are between 2,3 VPs|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kattbridge: maybe get off with one down if he find an endplay|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nilsland:  Can it be made? With help?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3 @S 3@C is possible|pg||
nt|nilsland:  with a spade retrurn|pg||
nt|nilsland:  another @D will put Cilla in - to play what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1NT EW went down at Bertheau and Larsson's table|pg||
nt|runnerup:  good start now @s Ace and @h 10|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kemperg: !A and small @H|pg||
nt|runnerup:  10|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|oliverc: NS can't attack Hearts without giving up their @H trick, though. Now AK@C and exit|pg||
nt|ady: somehow north managed to buy the contract in 1NT open room|pg||
nt|ady: need to play diamonds now|pg||
nt|ady: defence must try not to shorten declarer|pg||
nt|pef: i don't understand that play, the diamond finesse is almost irrelevant, if clubs break he was always making|pg||
nt|pef: Gary Hayden is a superb declarer, but look to me like he missed the best line|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: sorry, I lost a card, |pg||
mc|8|nt|vugraphzeg: changed to just making now|pg||
nt|oliverc: ughhh|pg||
nt|oliverc: with a @D?|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: my partners don't go out of their way to bid the other minor....  1NT and 1M on a 3-card suit take prioroty|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: I went minus too many in claim box :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: that agreement helps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: ok, we will not have a tie|pg||
nt|pef: conservative 3 diamonds by west and conservative pass by lusky|pg||
nt|pef: so looks like another 5 imp gain for lynch assuming sutherlin makes 4|pg||
nt|pef: which would appear to be a safe bet|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chorush: exactly what extras Drew felt he had are not known, but we shall see.|pg||
nt|chorush: One thing we do know. Krekorian will be going all out to make 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Anyone else remember the final board from US vs Brazil long long ago? |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|chorush: I believe if there is a heart shift and west drops the J it is over|pg||
nt|chorush: however, Bramley can see the dummy so a heart shift is not that attractive|pg||
nt|chorush: to be honest, Bramley has no attractive shift, just least poor|pg||
nt|chorush: Heart can beat it, anything else and I believe it will make|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bigtrain: bidding over a nebulous @D its critical to make an early TOX|pg||
nt|bigtrain: remeber that it's fairly random what minor opener has|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pef: the only way to make less is for allan after winning a second spade to lead back a heart and have sutherlin go up with the ace|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: set score 16-3 for Onstott|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other vugraph match, playing different boards   15-1 for Schwartz who leads Lay by 36|pg||
nt|pef: glad I got that out before he did it :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|Vugraphzfg: see you soon|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Vugraphzfg: back soon -- thanks all|pg||
nt|bigtrain: night everyon - hope everyone enjoyed our random musings :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hope to see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 59 was a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 60 bidding now -- East has captured NT so might get a deadly @S lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but might find better 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they have   Grabel in 4@H west|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks all -- see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pef: so only a 4 imp loss|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
mc|9|nt|pef: the brod team came back from 50 odd down with two sets to go in the round of 16, so being down 34 here with 60 boards to go not so terrible|pg||
nt|pef: of course they would prefer to be up 34 :)|pg||
nt|pef: thanks all for watching.  the final 60 boards of the round of eight start tomorrow about 10 AM CDT|pg||
nt|pef: the semifinals of the women's also starts tomorrow|pg||
