nt|vugraphzhc: hi all,welcome back :)|pg||
nt|panosk: gd morning Astrid|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: initial pass by N probably normal but i know i couldnt manage it at the table|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  might get to 3NT    |pg||
nt|ady: if west plays 3NT    should make on a spade lead|pg||

mb|d!|mb|3N|nt|oliverc: got there in the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: with club finesse and heart finesse on   should be 9 tricks |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think he will bother with heart finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he might go after Ds though|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes true    4 heart tricks  wont need heart finesse  |pg||
nt|ady: club finesse rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: tempting to finess @H to throw losing @C|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ady: though it  may be snags|pg||
nt|mamos:  is this a two suiter?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: better X or 1NT ?|pg||
nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ybob: i like X with 4/4 M´s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|murat e: 3 hearts surely bid by west as a transfer bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S+2@H+3@D+2@C=9 and @S hook can provide the 10th trick.|pg||
nt|murat e: or a single and choose contract bid we dont know|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: i would double too but 3 nt won't make i guess|pg||
nt|ybob: with doubleton @D better|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C the best spot to E-W|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ugly - slam decent but the red suits do them in|pg||
nt|mamos:  wow  game is certainly close|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|murat e: if south did not open 3 nt from west is good on a heart lead but that is gone|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: sory it was as it is here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|panosk: 9@H shud be in dummy :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: now @D lead defeat it|pg||
nt|ybob: not hard i think ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: there is 3 definatge losers in spade and spade ruff   and a trump trick  and will have to cope with the bad diamond split|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Burns Law violation in progress :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panosk: today's schedule has only 1 and a half match in line, so just 48 boards to be played|pg||
nt|panosk: piece of cake compared to 80 boards played yesterday|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|ady: now club switch    but may still make on an end play|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|murat e: 2 dia maybe showed both majors|pg||
pc|d3|nt|panosk: even that wudnt be enough |pg||
nt|mamos:  i think looking at the nS hands youd want to b e in 4@s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @h lead isn´t my lead as W. @cQ or @cJ depending on leads. Why? the shorter suit has more odds for the defence|pg||
pc|d6|nt|murat e: this hand shows how important to open the bidding when the suit is good without jack of clubs it is 11 hcp must still open at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: now should be down|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gsper:  Ekrens, popular in Norway though Ekren does no longer play it|pg||

nt|aramesh_:  Welcome to Goran Sperber|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|panosk: maybe double dummy can make, 2 rounds of trumps, pull 3@H to throw loser in @C and thrn A@D and @D to 10|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|s3|nt|mamos:  and as the cards lie @cQ would have beaten 4@s|pg||

nt|ady: I cannot see any winning line|pg||

mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: similar trump suit|pg||
nt|ady: was a case for playing ace of spades first round    but as it went needed to play K@C   first round  draw trump and exit with a club    either defender is end played|pg||
nt|ady: part score in sspades for e/w|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 1st segment was very exciting, this will be too|pg||
nt|murat e: yes but previous board maybe bidding was different at the table....|pg||
nt|panosk: i think W have doubled 2@H |pg||
nt|ybob: thx all :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: hi & wlc.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Apart from that I understand that bidding is fairly standard on both sides|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT on 19 is expert practice, usually described as upgrading to 20|pg||
nt|murat e: here north has too much property on spades which does not suit south if he was thinking about a dia slam|pg||
nt|murat e: ty bye|pg||
nt|ybob: bye|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: if partner bidding volunterely at five level vulnerable how did west pass|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bobholl: poor north difficult choice|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes i do agree  you cannot expect to make many @h tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|gsper:  Sensible. Few pairs have good methods for minor slams after 2NT opening.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have a fortunate 4 hearts    but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  this is solid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobholl: guess 2NT is lebensohl and than he guessed well|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades down if clubs attacked early before diamond set up|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: add the 9 of hearts to E/W  then 4 spades around 75 percent|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: normally after 2 nt 3 sp is transfer to 3 nt after which responder bids his minor to show slam interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|oliverc: Anyone else for "Pass" with the West hand?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|ady: north has taken the push     hard to judge    should be down 1|pg||
nt|ady: especially on diamond lead|pg||
nt|panosk: with spades behaving this will make|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panosk: not me Oliver sorry , not of that disposition in life :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|oliverc: Must be the Aegean sun :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: defending 4 spades  may not be clear  how to defend after cashing A@H unless south casn give a suit preference signal|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sverjohn: Looks like 9 tricks could be the limit here. Actually not unreasonable to get to game|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gsper:  Is that standard in Norway, KÃ¥re?|pg||
nt|murat e: but south instead of taking an adventure made a sensible bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can make 6 on any lead, same play. Am I right?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Seems so to me too.|pg||
nt|andersk: hi|pg||
nt|ady: also a good chance of 10 tricks if the K@C was woth north    may be able to play a club towards the queen  and create a discard of a heart later|pg||

pc|d3|nt|gsper:  In general, if you have 5 trumps it is a good idea to lead one. I am not sure how it would have worked here.|pg||

nt|panosk: players are also humans so they make a wrong decision from time to, its the duration that counts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: leades gained 10 on hand 19 where club end play was found   though defence made it a little easier by cashing ace of clubs|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: 4 hearts should play for 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: dia finesse not working so both 3 nt and 5 dia are destined to fail|pg||

pc|s6|nt|STRIK3R: Sitting in east seat, x of 1@h would normaly promise @d as well as @s, holding T72 in @d you dont want your partner to start bidding @d's, beside you know North has some @s's. ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Think pass of 2@c is ok in Teams|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: was not many choices on the play there|pg||
nt|panosk: it wasnt easy from the start|pg||
mb|2D!|an|3-7 w/ one M or 25-27|nt|murat e: declarers usually have a void or single at this type of auction so the lead was not absurd|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Nybo didnt even care to try get an overtrick, and thats how you play when you play teamscooring:)|pg||
nt|ady: another slam    this time 6@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes, even on a @s lead, since the @c breaks 3-2 and you have the @d's|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D weak 2 in unknown major i guess|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|STRIK3R: constructive 2@h openings|pg||
nt|bobholl: fairly good suit :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: south might be tempted to go for a game in NT|pg||
nt|ady: I thin slightly better choice last hand Ronny    could have played 3 round sof hearts after drawing trumps  just in case east was 3 - 4 -2-4  in which case would be later squeezed|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: ref board 21 when he dident bid game after invitaton from south|pg||
mb|d|nt|STRIK3R: that is true|pg||
nt|oliverc: NS might get too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Helgemo is not scared to overcall|pg||
nt|panosk: or to wrong game|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: They play 2@H/@S as 8-11 6+, so 2@D is about 3-7|pg||
nt|panosk: thx Kristian|pg||
nt|panosk: still 4@S also make |pg||
mb|3H!|nt|STRIK3R: I was thinking more after the first round of @c, since west showed up with a small one, you couldent really defend against J97x in east hand, but as you say, you would having that ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: squeeze going|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3@s preemtive I guess|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4 hearts    but 4 spades a good save for n/s|pg||
nt|mamos:  may well be 3NT again|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: 3@c asking for strengt and suit quality|pg||
nt|bobholl: playing multi we would bid 2@D 2nt and than 3 nt show akq 6th :) in any coulour|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3NT= max suit and max strength|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oliverc: might stop now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: best manche|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  dont wait too long to get to 6 level|pg||
mb|4S|nt|STRIK3R: 2NT from south would have been forcing asking for singleton/void|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  too much to do here T FIRST GLANCE|pg||
nt|oliverc: maybe not :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: this will make |pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: south did well to let 3NT stand|pg||
nt|bobholl: j@S now i guess|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: this will be over in a minute|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|oliverc: good stop :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|panosk: @S Q i guess now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no success I think, but with open cards.....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|STRIK3R: unless going for the @c suit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panosk: shud have taken from hand to play spade|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: hand 21  played in game here provided a swing for Tromse as I tht would slam went down in OR|pg||
pc|s6|nt|murat e: can north deblock his queen of spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad guesser as usual (ask my P)|pg||
nt|panosk: 5@D also make i think|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|STRIK3R: :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|murat e: declarer has entry problems from one hand to the other|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: wont distroy his income to dummy before setting up the winning @d's, all he need is to develop 1 trick beside his 6 clear winners|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards, now @dJ and if it holds, a @c to @cQ and a @s finess....|pg||
nt|panosk: decl worried about 4-2 trump break and considers his options |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Tromsø gained 8 imps in brd 21|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andersk: I like Flott's line here, playing @C first|pg||
pc|c6|nt|STRIK3R: will cash out now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: for 9 total tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andersk: He will duck|pg||
nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: I think I would prefeer a duck|pg||
nt|andersk: Helgemo might hav a stiff @S K or KJ stiffed, as he had|pg||
nt|baldjean: he should take in hand then; it gives him more options|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|STRIK3R: ups, bad guess :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 10@D to avoid blocking @D|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andersk: That would force him to play another suit|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panosk: why spade shift from N and not heart?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|baldjean: would be  safe to rujn 1 more round ofo trump|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|sverjohn: Yes, spade or diamond would have killed it|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
mc|11|nt|baldjean: as long as communication betweeen hand and dummy is still there|pg||
nt|panosk: i think E whud have ducked 1 round of @D, but thought @C return was single|pg||
nt|panosk: *shud|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: short break|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would have ducked @d too|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Marstarander opened 1@C on brd 21 in OR, while Solli Hansen opened 1@D here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: I like his 3rd hand oopening 1@C - |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: He wants pd to lead @C and not @D if opps get to play the contract.|pg||
nt|panosk: if its not strong @C i cant see the benefit in general, apart from this board|pg||
nt|panosk: with an 18 holding you hope to play, not to defend|pg||
nt|panosk: 41 imps exchanging hands in 1st six boards, translating to an imp gain for Kristiansands|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: 4@s e/w and 5@h n/s on this hand|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: agree, safe to play @c|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 14 IMP lead we have 7 more boards here, but 10 more comparisons|pg||
nt|panosk: thats what a finess is about, 50-50 so cant always win|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: true, I dident see that|pg||
nt|andersk: quite some hands this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: still its a bit pessimistic|pg||

mb|1N|nt|STRIK3R: only 10 tricks in @H, sorry|pg||
nt|mamos:  don't  try this at home|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: 2@H = 5-9 hcp, 5@h and 4 in a minor|pg||

nt|bobholl: good to hold NS out of @H :)|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: what do you prefer? 5@d or 4@H?... ehm 4@h out of the question now|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: E/W open lowest 4 card suit, can open 1@c with 4333 if the @s suit is poor|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Does anyone know if the opening showed 5 cards?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 4@s easy to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: will Jim get the @s's right?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|murat e: Helgemo is happy opps buying the contract|pg||
nt|murat e: he knows partners second suit is diamonds|pg||

nt|panosk: natural lead since no stayman by W|pg||
pc|sK|nt|murat e: easy 8 tricks with diamonds breaking|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Easy to bid, but maybe not easy to win|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: thats the problem pre-empting with 6 card suits   hard to evaluate with a good hand opposite that|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: or if south ducked the @h lead|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: nothing seems easy here, except the @s layout|pg||
nt|sverjohn: As we thought a swing to Kristiansand on board 19. 4h was beaten|pg||
nt|ady: re all    sorry   bad connection|pg||
nt|baldjean: IMP exchange is usually an indicator for aggressiveness; the higher it is the more aggressive the teams are|pg||

nt|bobholl: 4@S difficult now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so N/S missed out a good sac in @d or @h, the 1@h opening probably scared North |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: and only 9 tricks in @s as well, I will not make analyzes anymore, sorry... :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: could have been down on @H ruff but S expects no @D A in N|pg||
nt|panosk: sspade and wishfull thinking|pg||

mb|2H|nt|andersk: Helgemo I hopeing for a D from partner|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: NT N/S would be a interesting play|pg||

nt|ady: 6@D can make e/w    but ambitious|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bobholl: yes guess it was check back passed :)|pg||

nt|baldjean: will land in 3@h|pg||
nt|panosk: he may pass being vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: wrong...|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@D not bad EW, however it cant make|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if you play weak 2 as their cc states, that is not a 2@s opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Christer is thinking, %&&/%¤&(=(&/)/&/) :)|pg||
nt|murat e: spade discard|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: pass in south now show 0-2@s's|pg||
nt|ady: firstr quiet hand|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: shall we predict just making? 2@c that is|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: though last hand could have been defeated  south might have considered saving in 6@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: an another 13 imp to Tromsø, 1 IMP now|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Would have opened 1 spade. But this could have worked out well|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not checback, xyNT 2@c forces 2@d|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But a weak 2 opener should never bid again, so this could have waked up Holm|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: that was expected Ronny    6@D  - 1  with ace and king of clubs to loose|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s6|nt|murat e: south accepts game-try and bids 3 nt with 4-3-3-3 flat distribution|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT is usually some kind of relay nowadays|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so we guess east forgot system, or was not sure if the system was on after an intial pass in opening from west(ref board 4 in open room)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 6-5 is obvious|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|gsper:  But you are right that natural fits this bidding|pg||
nt|murat e: north thinks 4 hearts is better in fact both contracts make|pg||

mb|1C|mb|2N!|an|!h!d|nt|panosk: 11 imps to Kristiansands after 6@D -1 in 24|pg||
nt|baldjean: oh, I was not speaking in general terms. he was correct for this board; at other boards going to 3-level might have been better|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gsper:  On board 7 the other room missed the slam in much the same way|pg||
nt|panosk: its not fair this early in the morning |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: nice 4 spades for n/s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|STRIK3R: yes, but should be possible to reach for E/W in open to|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: notrumps from west is an interesting contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: good bidding from e/w again|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not making it easy for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may get to 3NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bobholl: you have to discuss what redouble now is (retransfer ?)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: looks like it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and old rule - give opps as much rope as they need and they will hang themselves:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: Tromsø in the lead|pg||
nt|ady: will need to get 4 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: see 7 safe tricks|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: getting 4 diamonds give you 8|pg||
nt|ady: even that not enough with Q@H wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: i know what you meant Jeanine was just joking|pg||
nt|baldjean: the difficulty is to decide what is right, and that's part of what makes bridge so interesting|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: @c with @H ttolerance|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: E/W surely bid a lot, 3@c here is not my style, if x of 2@h show @h|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 tricks in 3NT , but looking for the 9th|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: but east didn't understand|pg||
nt|ady: north not moving after taking early action|pg||
nt|ady: is minimum   but very suitable|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: need to play @h to 9|pg||
nt|mamos:  this looks a normal contract and should make|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gsper:  Many Scandinavians would have bid 3@C (minimum) as W. This is something different.|pg||
nt|panosk: was double an option for N?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|murat e: even on a club lead declarer can duck twice and if he knows the rest can make it|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|kemperg: @H5??|pg||

pc|h2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|panosk: the lead gives decl a @C trick and makes his life easier, still even without @C lead he wud have to ruff 2@H in hand and ends up the same with @H 4-2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kemperg: big problems for leader|pg||

nt|baldjean: trump*|pg||

nt|panosk: *depending|pg||
pc|h8|nt|STRIK3R: hard to make this|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|STRIK3R: playing @c to be 3-3 is risky :) better hope for some luck in @s I think|pg||
nt|ady: needs clubs 3=3 with honours split  and J@S onside|pg||
nt|sverjohn: He could have made it through a late entry in clubs follwed by a trump finesse|pg||
pc|s5|nt|murat e: declarer can crosruff or establish spades bot are ok but he does not see as we do with open cards|pg||
nt|kemperg: or @D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andersk: I think Helgemo is max unlucky here. And I totally disagree with 1 NT|pg||
nt|andersk: Helgemo have 43 in major, so if partner can bid a major over 1 @d he is normally in very good shape|pg||
nt|andersk: Very unlucky to play 3 NT|pg||
nt|panosk: how do u lose playing in majors after 1NT ?|pg||
nt|andersk: with the favouruble @H 3-3 NS probably would have made 3 @H|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andersk: 1 NT bad, when partner dont have majors (which he often does not have when you self have 4-3 in MM)|pg||

nt|henryb:  A strange choice of actions by South|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|panosk: i think there are arguments on both sides, depends if you chose to downgrade (1NT) or upgrade (reverse 2@H), anyway Helgemo's opinion shud be respected|pg||
nt|bobholl: east has to guess who has t of @H|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: which Major to lead..|pg||
nt|ady: best lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: bit shy from Bakke|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: How can you be in bad shape if pard can bid 1 M? And if he bids 1 NT tou pass(he often have @C then) 1 NT can be a catastrofe when partner have under 6p and bad majors........I ...|pg||
nt|andersk: rest my case|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|djneill:  that would help, the @s8 is important not to waste|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: 5-0 break in hearts make it impossible though|pg||
nt|ady: best to play queen  and a low club|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Nice bid by Jensen. Some would dream of 1-3-5-4 by pd and go further|pg||
mb|5S|nt|murat e: otherwise declarer woujd go between one of the black suit finesses|pg||
nt|panosk: compared to last 1 this 3nt will look a walk in the park for Helgemo|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessed rigth|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok so East now knows West has 4 spades headed by nothing :-)  South cannot have more than 4 spades , so West has 4, per East|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: S ahs to win this and play spades to defeat |pg||
nt|panosk: *has|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  With the @DA missing, it is difficult to do anything in @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  maybe the @sT, East thinks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may go down on this line|pg||
nt|ady: must resist a heart switch|pg||
nt|ady: continuation of spade   seems only 8 tricks  unless finessing club   unlikely play|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: knowing E/W open on lowest 4 card suit, east is favourite to hold 4@h's?|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR W opened 1C, E had no problem to bid 4@S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andersk: @C 10 convinient|pg||
nt|bobholl: NE now playing tic tac tor|pg||

pc|s5|nt|bobholl: guess 2NT just made (a push)|pg||
nt|bobholl: on board 9 the @H @S game S didn't lead his singleton so 4@S made|pg||

nt|djneill:  hmm, East what to lead|pg||
nt|djneill:  same @s as West had almost|pg||
nt|ady: in fact 2@H by n/s can be defeated if defenders take a diamond ruff   |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if you are really positive you lead K of @d|pg||
nt|djneill:  I would tend to play pd for no good suits here, else they would have opened 3rd seat NV|pg||
nt|djneill:  @dK looks good STRIK3R|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: sorry,dont ger the play here..cards wrong|pg||

nt|vugraphzhc: two and a half matches, total 80 boards|pg||
nt|panosk: yes sorry thx, still lots of boards |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|murat e: after this lead declarer has no worries|pg||
nt|ady: very swingy set|pg||
nt|kemperg: undo|pg||
mb|4S|nt|STRIK3R: 3@h would be expensive if it was doubled|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so we see another swing for Bergen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andersk: this will be quick 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhc: looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|mamos:  this is a good lead for te defence declarer has problems now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|panosk: like Jeanine suggested 1st real candidate board for a push|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panosk: cant see this making |pg||
pc|c5|nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||

nt|murat e: is good for us because heart lead would cost us a dull watching for the same result declarer spending more time on the play|pg||
nt|bobholl: s has to be carefull :)|pg||
nt|ady: even after the lead in OR still not 9 tricks   but dfeence did not switch to clubs after taking A@S|pg||

nt|andersk: this board was played befor they got the vougraph broadcast up after problems with card files, dont look at movie, movie is wrong but result is right|pg||
nt|panosk: diamonds make clubs dont|pg||
nt|murat e: open one dia and bid 6 clubs next is the easiest way to reach slam - if south does not open-|pg||
nt|djneill:  I never had success with the "minimum opening hand" weak twos in 4th seat, I don't know, it just seemed not to help|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: np Astrid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Interesting board tho|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andersk: 6 @H makes NS on a @D lead|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|STRIK3R: possible pickup here, 3NT makes N/S?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@C opening in OR, not good, to strong for that|pg||
nt|panosk: excellent result in OR for Tromsp|pg||
mb|5H|mb|5S|nt|kemperg: all specs agree an upgrade|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: on a non @C |pg||
nt|andersk: I didnt consider other leads than @C or @D :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: contremplating something else as 3nt ?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: sorry no, not making|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: N looks tempted to rise|pg||
nt|kemperg: rdl = @HA|pg||
mb|d|nt|murat e: if south makes a lightner double west can revert to diamonds....|pg||
nt|panosk: quite reasonably|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe NS should have a deefence to show MM here|pg||
nt|ady: could make on a heart lead if played by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade lead best against 3NT    but  around 11 tricks on the lay|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@D ???|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@H dont make|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: sry not meant this|pg||
nt|ady: club lead may hold to 10 as Jack will be played|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  will be a little worrisome, South the danger hand, hard to avoid South for sure - danger hand being the one you do not want on lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  wellSouth has pushed on to 5@s  which may be a mistake with the bad break - 4@s  might have made but 5@s looks too much|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  North's silence over both 2@c and 3@d seems somewhet less than optimal|pg||
nt|andersk: Actually EW deserve to loose IMPs for not bidding this great slam|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: according to their cc they use suction(yes lek in Norwegian) vs strong 1@c and 2@c, maybe Christer was hoping for some Major fit E/W|pg||
nt|andersk: instead they win 13|pg||
nt|henryb:  10, I think for non-vul|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad defence.....|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andersk: Trust me, Christer pass was not hopeing EW had major fit, too much unlikely|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: any lead but @c played from North|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely fir north to bid no-trumps|pg||
pc|d3|nt|djneill:  if West had a suit like AT9x    K8xx  there would be some control over who to lose to when setting up a side suit|pg||
nt|baldjean: no, 5@h is the utmost|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andersk: yes 10  sorry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Old saying: 6-5, come alive|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h3|nt|kemperg: bit fast, 3@S or 4@D better, give p a chance|pg||
nt|baldjean: well judged by both pairs|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|nt|ady: can make 9 quickly with queren of clubs coming down    but cashing ace and king of clubs may create an entry to south for spade threw|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobholl: afraid of @S switch good decision|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must be awake now!!!!|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|murat e: he may get trumps right maybe|pg||
nt|djneill:  right, and if North has the @dK, that could happen if clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|STRIK3R: good J of @d discard|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|murat e: spade lead was better here|pg||

nt|panosk: and 5 more from earlier efforts|pg||
nt|andersk: thx to co-commentators NBF and Namsos BK, see you all in about 45 minutes :)|pg||
nt|murat e: if declarer makes the mistake of ducking twice east shifts to a club and if this one also ducked another club cuts declarer off to his hand of course these scenarios not correct ...|pg||

nt|panosk: thx vm Kristoffer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|djneill:  looks like it plays like a double-squeeze even if plays 3 hearts, unless they force out the @d entry early|pg||
nt|ady: once the spade loser is thrown on K@C   east will draw 2 trumps   and play diamonds ruffing the 4th diamond|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board thanks to ouroperator Robert Althe and all kibs|pg||
pc|hT|nt|murat e: after the ace of spades cashed the 9 spot did not appear so he should have worked out the possible layouts in the trump suit|pg||
