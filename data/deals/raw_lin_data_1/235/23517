nt|marlowepi: i dont think he will bother with heart finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he might go after Ds though|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: yes true    4 heart tricks  wont need heart finesse  |pg||
nt|ady: club finesse rather|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|panosk: tempting to finess @H to throw losing @C|pg||
nt|sverjohn: I am sure Holm hoped for a black suit from pd|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But this should also make thx to the Kx in clubs|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another slam @s or @d?|pg||
nt|knutte: Looks like Heimdal, Bergen and Kristiansand will settle for the medals|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|panosk: W pass?|pg||

mb|3S|nt|bobholl: better X or 1NT ?|pg||
nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: i like X with 4/4 M´s|pg||
nt|grebrof: some text went missing :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|murat e: 3 hearts surely bid by west as a transfer bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S+2@H+3@D+2@C=9 and @S hook can provide the 10th trick.|pg||
nt|murat e: or a single and choose contract bid we dont know|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: i would double too but 3 nt won't make i guess|pg||
nt|ybob: with doubleton @D better|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C the best spot to E-W|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ugly - slam decent but the red suits do them in|pg||
nt|mamos:  wow  game is certainly close|pg||
nt|panosk: a more observant fellow spec suggested that if S plays low spade in 2nd trick E will not make|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: if south did not open 3 nt from west is good on a heart lead but that is gone|pg||
nt|knutte: Just as my tricks sometimes does :)|pg||

pc|s6|nt|oliverc: Burns Law violation in progress :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|panosk: today's schedule has only 1 and a half match in line, so just 48 boards to be played|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: now club switch    but may still make on an end play|pg||
pc|s3|nt|murat e: 2 dia maybe showed both majors|pg||
nt|rnmalik: To think of yes plausible.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|panosk: even that wudnt be enough |pg||
nt|mamos:  i think looking at the nS hands youd want to b e in 4@s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @h lead isn´t my lead as W. @cQ or @cJ depending on leads. Why? the shorter suit has more odds for the defence|pg||
pc|sK|nt|murat e: this hand shows how important to open the bidding when the suit is good without jack of clubs it is 11 hcp must still open at this vulnerability|pg||

mb|d|nt|murat e: if partner bidding volunterely at five level vulnerable how did west pass|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobholl: poor north difficult choice|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes i do agree  you cannot expect to make many @h tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The best use of the green card.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|knutte: 9 tricks in @S EW at the most, NS might make 4 @D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gsper:  Sensible. Few pairs have good methods for minor slams after 2NT opening.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have a fortunate 4 hearts    but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 spades|pg||
nt|knutte: For res: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mamos:  this is solid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: guess 2NT is lebensohl and than he guessed well|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades down if clubs attacked early before diamond set up|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: add the 9 of hearts to E/W  then 4 spades around 75 percent|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: normally after 2 nt 3 sp is transfer to 3 nt after which responder bids his minor to show slam interest|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobholl: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|oliverc: Anyone else for "Pass" with the West hand?|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S make but impossible to find, i'd personally venture a 3@C bid in case pard has 6-4 with cubs second suit|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|ady: north has taken the push     hard to judge    should be down 1|pg||
nt|ady: especially on diamond lead|pg||
nt|panosk: with spades behaving this will make|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|panosk: not me Oliver sorry , not of that disposition in life :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|oliverc: Must be the Aegean sun :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: defending 4 spades  may not be clear  how to defend after cashing A@H unless south casn give a suit preference signal|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sverjohn: Looks like 9 tricks could be the limit here. Actually not unreasonable to get to game|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|gsper:  Is that standard in Norway, KÃ¥re?|pg||
nt|murat e: but south instead of taking an adventure made a sensible bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can make 6 on any lead, same play. Am I right?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Seems so to me too.|pg||
nt|andersk: hi|pg||
nt|ady: also a good chance of 10 tricks if the K@C was woth north    may be able to play a club towards the queen  and create a discard of a heart later|pg||
nt|knutte: Bergen gained 11 imp at board 17 |pg||

nt|panosk: its all over the world nowadays, spreading like a contagion|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: the 2@s opening was 5/6 - 10/11 in this vul, promising 5@s and normaly a 4+ minor suit, but could be only 3 card minor on the side|pg||
nt|knutte: also put opps under pressure|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s2|nt|bobholl: guess a1D small @D|pg||

nt|panosk: i played in a club last night and boards seemed so boring, how do they manage to make these here so much more interesting?|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3nt|pg||
mb|1N|nt|panosk: thx O R|pg||
nt|andersk: 4 @C was alerted as short, but I beleve it was asking partner to transfeer to he's major|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@c for E?|pg||
nt|panosk: defence was excellent in last |pg||
nt|knutte: 4 @S a good save|pg||
mb|3S|nt|murat e: this time 8-5 for a change|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if he intend to open in first hand that is|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|knutte: not easy for Eide now|pg||
nt|grebrof: 5@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: slam time    6 spades for n/s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes 4@c looks fair|pg||
nt|mamos:  specsakke agrees :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|knutte: Must close his eyes and make a 3NT bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|knutte: or keep them open and pass|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gsper:  Preempting with a 5-card major on the side is very unclassical, but what do you do?|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the 1972 Olympics, a Canadian opened 4@H with 6-6 in the majors. The opps...|pg||
nt|gsper:  bid 4@S, he doubled and it made|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@c one long suit|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to 3NT    but may have a difficult ride|pg||
nt|mamos:  its poss that 4@c is Texas|pg||
nt|panosk: trumps break well for decl |pg||
nt|knutte: N must switch to small @S after A of @C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: opted for part score|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Caution may pay off here. Guess Frank did not like his club holding|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andersk: looks like 9 tricks for NS in @H and 8 EW in sp|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@C= i have long unspecified suit, 2@D say which|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: need to ruff 2 hearts to make |pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: and on @C lead no entries to do that|pg||
nt|ady: or possibly ruff 1 heart and set up long club|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andersk: Peronally I overcall 1 @S with Nybo's hand|pg||
nt|ady: low spase now best|pg||
nt|andersk: what line?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gsper:  In general, if you have 5 trumps it is a good idea to lead one. I am not sure how it would have worked here.|pg||
nt|murat e: i think heart lead and dia shift needed to beat this contract|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree |pg||
nt|murat e: helgamos hand is rubbish and he has a passed parnner but hands fit very well|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W must be feeling low on missing 4@S by that preempt and the defence cashed their tricks to the max.|pg||
nt|grebrof: interesting choice of switch|pg||
nt|knutte: Didnt see that one coming|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andersk: after 3. hand openings and not vouln, m|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
pc|c7|nt|STRIK3R: West was in perfect spot for using "snapdragon", but they dont have that in their cc, dbl(snapdragon) would have showed 5@s and minimum Tx in @d|pg||
nt|grebrof: makes now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: club lead is awkard    east has 3 spades to the 10 and doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: North thinking...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards - easy.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|panosk: in board 2 4@S were made hence 12 imps to Drammen|pg||
nt|andersk: needed to switch @D to couse any problems|pg||
nt|panosk: not an easy contract|pg||
nt|grebrof: or|pg||
pc|h7|nt|panosk: its a hopeless contract |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ady: even on this lead  awkward to make 12 tricks on the lay|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andersk: Probably down on @D switch|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wygbe1: i wonder why n didnt act sooner|pg||
nt|mamos:  no reason to choose anything other than this straightforward line is there?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but lucky to find E with the stiff @s....|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: dont think can get back and forth without east getting a trump promotion|pg||
nt|knutte: Yes, makes now|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|knutte: because of @H 3-3 :)|pg||
nt|knutte: combined with the K of @H switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: Kings behind aces tend to give tricks|pg||

mc|9|nt|wygbe1: the delay made it easy for ew to find their spade fit, and it looks like ns can make 4 of a minor|pg||

nt|ady: 17 and 18 were both 6 imps for the leaders making 3NT|pg||
nt|panosk: EW chose to play in NT in board 2 which went -3 hence 11 imps to Kristiansands|pg||
nt|knutte: But this board, 21, could give Kristiansand some imp back|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|andersk: Press live update in left meny|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks for e/w in hearts|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: n/s save in 4@S  down 4 on best defence|pg||
nt|ady: a good swing here for North if resisting any save|pg||
nt|ady: surely wont  save with ace and king of clubs to defend|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H here my guess|pg||
nt|knutte: Now a cold 3 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gsper:  Presumably N can correct 3@C to 3@D without showing extras|pg||
nt|andersk: or this link : v|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
nt|panosk: players are also humans so they make a wrong decision from time to, its the duration that counts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: leades gained 10 on hand 19 where club end play was found   though defence made it a little easier by cashing ace of clubs|pg||
nt|knutte: 6 @D will make - as many spec already have told me :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: 4 hearts should play for 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|murat e: dia finesse not working so both 3 nt and 5 dia are destined to fail|pg||
nt|ady: no lead gives this any chance|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT also a make|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 12 tricks from the top with no finesses :)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|andersk: Flott/Nybo is not bidding much :)|pg||
nt|panosk: i bet W he will take extra time to play  this :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzhc: good guess|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andersk: Bakke thinking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 2@c is rather clear - isn´t it?|pg||
nt|andersk: If he pass, Helgomo knowes he's partner have a hand|pg||
nt|panosk: another hard 1 for decl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: your guess correct :)|pg||
nt|panosk: i think its very reasonable bidding |pg||
pc|dA|nt|panosk: im ok with pass in 2nd no 4-4 majors|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder if 2NT was natural (unusual these days) or minors or something|pg||
nt|panosk: the rest two suits more likely|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: hi David I will join you for the rest of this set|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Ronny    welcome|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 8 tricks for S - at least....|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: that was a surprise....|pg||
nt|andersk: probably 8 tricks, even 9 on a good day|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|panosk: @C from dummy and if no @D return he will make|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c2|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: Dag did his work bidding 3@s on this one, making it hard for East/West to make a controlled auction|pg||
pc|dK|nt|panosk: E doing his bit with highest @C available|pg||
nt|panosk: not a clear sign though|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what switch @S or @D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: high @c = spade ?|pg||
nt|panosk: most likely |pg||
nt|panosk: depends on their agreements|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, weired 1nt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: should be the first swing this set for Tromse|pg||
pc|d2|nt|STRIK3R: Sitting in east seat, x of 1@h would normaly promise @d as well as @s, holding T72 in @d you dont want your partner to start bidding @d's, beside you know North has some @s's. ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Think pass of 2@c is ok in Teams|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panosk: in board 18 as was accurately suggested by operator Astrid earlier EW cud make 3NT which they did |pg||
nt|panosk: in open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo should have played the 2@C.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|STRIK3R: but as the hands are, N/S would have stopped bidding on either bid from west|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andersk: EW might block the @H's and W might be endplayed for 9|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: true   if you bang out top cards you can make 6 hearts 3 diamonds 2 clubs and 1 spade|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hi all|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|panosk: maybe still cant blame W at all very hard to find |pg||

nt|STRIK3R: was not many choices on the play there|pg||
nt|panosk: it wasnt easy from the start|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: declarers usually have a void or single at this type of auction so the lead was not absurd|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andersk: Nybo didnt even care to try get an overtrick, and thats how you play when you play teamscooring:)|pg||
nt|ady: another slam    this time 6@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes, even on a @s lead, since the @c breaks 3-2 and you have the @d's|pg||

mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: constructive 2@h openings|pg||
nt|bobholl: fairly good suit :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: south might be tempted to go for a game in NT|pg||
nt|ady: I thin slightly better choice last hand Ronny    could have played 3 round sof hearts after drawing trumps  just in case east was 3 - 4 -2-4  in which case would be later squeezed|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: ref board 21 when he dident bid game after invitaton from south|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board4= In the OR no preempt and landed in 5@C rather than 4@S.|pg||
nt|panosk: back to "normal" crazy distributions |pg||
mb|1S|nt|STRIK3R: that is true|pg||
nt|oliverc: NS might get too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Helgemo is not scared to overcall|pg||

nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: They play 2@H/@S as 8-11 6+, so 2@D is about 3-7|pg||
nt|panosk: thx Kristian|pg||
nt|panosk: still 4@S also make |pg||
mb|1N|nt|STRIK3R: I was thinking more after the first round of @c, since west showed up with a small one, you couldent really defend against J97x in east hand, but as you say, you would having that ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: squeeze going|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3@s preemtive I guess|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4 hearts    but 4 spades a good save for n/s|pg||
nt|mamos:  may well be 3NT again|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: 3@c asking for strengt and suit quality|pg||
nt|bobholl: playing multi we would bid 2@D 2nt and than 3 nt show akq 6th :) in any coulour|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3NT= max suit and max strength|pg||
mb|2N|nt|oliverc: might stop now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: best manche|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  dont wait too long to get to 6 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: 2NT from south would have been forcing asking for singleton/void|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|panosk: this will make |pg||

pc|dA|nt|panosk: @S Q i guess now|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: unless going for the @c suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panosk: shud have taken from hand to play spade|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|ady: hand 21  played in game here provided a swing for Tromse as I tht would slam went down in OR|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|murat e: can north deblock his queen of spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad guesser as usual (ask my P)|pg||
nt|panosk: 5@D also make i think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|STRIK3R: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW have 7@D as compared to the declares 6.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|murat e: declarer has entry problems from one hand to the other|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: wont distroy his income to dummy before setting up the winning @d's, all he need is to develop 1 trick beside his 6 clear winners|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards, now @dJ and if it holds, a @c to @cQ and a @s finess....|pg||
nt|panosk: decl worried about 4-2 trump break and considers his options |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Tromsø gained 8 imps in brd 21|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|andersk: I like Flott's line here, playing @C first|pg||
nt|panosk: can pls someone ship the board dealing software to Greek Federation :)|pg||

pc|h5|nt|STRIK3R: for 9 total tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andersk: He will duck|pg||
nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: I think I would prefeer a duck|pg||
nt|andersk: Helgemo might hav a stiff @S K or KJ stiffed, as he had|pg||
nt|baldjean: he should take in hand then; it gives him more options|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|STRIK3R: ups, bad guess :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 10@D to avoid blocking @D|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andersk: That would force him to play another suit|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d9|nt|knutte: so down with this contract, possible imps for EW as @H-contract makes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panosk: i mean these hands are tough but so much more interesting |pg||
pc|s5|nt|panosk: why spade shift from N and not heart?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|panosk: and testing |pg||
pc|d8|pc|s6|nt|baldjean: would be  safe to rujn 1 more round ofo trump|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Yes, spade or diamond would have killed it|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|baldjean: as long as communication betweeen hand and dummy is still there|pg||
nt|panosk: i think E whud have ducked 1 round of @D, but thought @C return was single|pg||
nt|panosk: *shud|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: short break|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would have ducked @d too|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Marstarander opened 1@C on brd 21 in OR, while Solli Hansen opened 1@D here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: I like his 3rd hand oopening 1@C - |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: He wants pd to lead @C and not @D if opps get to play the contract.|pg||
nt|panosk: if its not strong @C i cant see the benefit in general, apart from this board|pg||
nt|panosk: with an 18 holding you hope to play, not to defend|pg||
nt|panosk: 41 imps exchanging hands in 1st six boards, translating to an imp gain for Kristiansands|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: because he know that east has 0-2 @s's, so the @s suit is most likely blocked|pg||

nt|rnmalik: If you dont lead you dont have one:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: thats the problem pre-empting with 6 card suits   hard to evaluate with a good hand opposite that|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: or if south ducked the @h lead|pg||

pc|sA|nt|bobholl: 4@S difficult now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so N/S missed out a good sac in @d or @h, the 1@h opening probably scared North |pg||

nt|panosk: sspade and wishfull thinking|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: playing one round of @c and two times @H, would later endplay east in @d|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bobholl: yes guess it was check back passed :)|pg||
nt|ady: may well play 4 spades|pg||
nt|sverjohn: This might bring some life into west|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: I dont like the 2@s opening|pg||
nt|baldjean: will land in 3@h|pg||
nt|panosk: he may pass being vul|pg||
nt|panosk: everything still in order :)|pg||
nt|knutte: sry - choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: wrong...|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@D not bad EW, however it cant make|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if you play weak 2 as their cc states, that is not a 2@s opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Christer is thinking, %&&/%¤&(=(&/)/&/) :)|pg||
nt|murat e: spade discard|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: pass in south now show 0-2@s's|pg||
nt|ady: firstr quiet hand|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: shall we predict just making? 2@c that is|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: though last hand could have been defeated  south might have considered saving in 6@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: an another 13 imp to Tromsø, 1 IMP now|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Would have opened 1 spade. But this could have worked out well|pg||
nt|knutte: Good contract thou :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|panosk: 4@C by S is new suit or cue bid in spades?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not checback, xyNT 2@c forces 2@d|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But a weak 2 opener should never bid again, so this could have waked up Holm|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: that was expected Ronny    6@D  - 1  with ace and king of clubs to loose|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|murat e: south accepts game-try and bids 3 nt with 4-3-3-3 flat distribution|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT is usually some kind of relay nowadays|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so we guess east forgot system, or was not sure if the system was on after an intial pass in opening from west(ref board 4 in open room)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 6-5 is obvious|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|gsper:  But you are right that natural fits this bidding|pg||
nt|murat e: north thinks 4 hearts is better in fact both contracts make|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would not like to pass, to be honest. the @s of partner can't be too good|pg||
nt|panosk: what does 5@S mean? |pg||
nt|panosk: cant be asking for spade honors to go to slam|pg||
pc|c5|nt|STRIK3R: yes, you said so :) I trust you David :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|andersk: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
nt|kemperg: think 3NT was nonserious slam try|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess 1 down now but on @S lead at least -2|pg||
nt|knutte: And as we can see, 1 @S would have made it more difficult to get there...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzhc: 3nt= krAV OM cue|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2NT  @S fit, 3@C game at least|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: not guaranteed to make this|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: now ddiamond ruff   and ace king of spades and spade ruff|pg||
nt|ady: should be down 1|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: no, defence have 3 more @c tricks and AK of @s coming, if South get his ruff in @s|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|kemperg: thks operator, I have to gues their system|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|knutte: Another 12 imp to Bergen as they reach 6@D at board 22|pg||
pc|sT|nt|murat e: EW took their max number of tricks bot enough to beat this though|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: still down 2|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: have to loose a @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: and may bee a @H :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: indeed, even that|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kemperg: not a 50% slam, @SQ and @CK had to behave|pg||
nt|panosk: i also think that has something to do with quality of spade suit, only that i use it to ask pard to go to slam if he has 2 out of 3 top honors in spades|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|knutte: res: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, that was no surprise|pg||
pc|dT|nt|STRIK3R: no, south showed 12 points already, woulden open 1@c with 15|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: or this way   and 2 more trump tricks for north|pg||
nt|panosk: no heart ?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||

nt|baldjean: oh, I was not speaking in general terms. he was correct for this board; at other boards going to 3-level might have been better|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: nice 4 spades for n/s|pg||

mb|1N|nt|STRIK3R: yes, but should be possible to reach for E/W in open to|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: notrumps from west is an interesting contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|STRIK3R: good bidding from e/w again|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not making it easy for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may get to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: you have to discuss what redouble now is (retransfer ?)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: looks like it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and old rule - give opps as much rope as they need and they will hang themselves:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: Tromsø in the lead|pg||
nt|ady: will need to get 4 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: see 7 safe tricks|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: getting 4 diamonds give you 8|pg||
nt|ady: even that not enough with Q@H wrong|pg||
nt|knutte: shd make easily|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panosk: i know what you meant Jeanine was just joking|pg||
nt|baldjean: the difficulty is to decide what is right, and that's part of what makes bridge so interesting|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: @c with @H ttolerance|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: E/W surely bid a lot, 3@c here is not my style, if x of 2@h show @h|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 tricks in 3NT , but looking for the 9th|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: but east didn't understand|pg||
nt|ady: north not moving after taking early action|pg||
nt|ady: is minimum   but very suitable|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: need to play @h to 9|pg||
nt|mamos:  this looks a normal contract and should make|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|gsper:  Many Scandinavians would have bid 3@C (minimum) as W. This is something different.|pg||
nt|panosk: was double an option for N?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|murat e: even on a club lead declarer can duck twice and if he knows the rest can make it|pg||
nt|ady: minimum 1 down|pg||
nt|panosk: had some comments suggesting 3@S is beter , i agree|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panosk: and @D back, pard has his reasons |pg||
nt|panosk: another way to look at it W has nothing beter to play|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|baldjean: I think getting rid of an @h loser first would be better here|pg||
nt|panosk: thats very right |pg||

nt|kemperg: @H5??|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: mm|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Robert Althe|pg||
nt|kemperg: not a clear count signal, perhaps trying a @D signal?|pg||
nt|panosk: didnt agree with me :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gsper:  3@S maybe minimum wothout singleton|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: good save against 4@s :)|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|STRIK3R: playing @c to be 3-3 is risky :) better hope for some luck in @s I think|pg||

nt|sverjohn: He could have made it through a late entry in clubs follwed by a trump finesse|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer can crosruff or establish spades bot are ok but he does not see as we do with open cards|pg||
nt|kemperg: or @D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andersk: I think Helgemo is max unlucky here. And I totally disagree with 1 NT|pg||
nt|andersk: Helgemo have 43 in major, so if partner can bid a major over 1 @d he is normally in very good shape|pg||
nt|andersk: Very unlucky to play 3 NT|pg||
nt|panosk: how do u lose playing in majors after 1NT ?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: hasn´t N showed a red twosuiter?|pg||
nt|henryb:  A strange choice of actions by South|pg||
nt|panosk: 1@S openning is marginal to say the least :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk: i think there are arguments on both sides, depends if you chose to downgrade (1NT) or upgrade (reverse 2@H), anyway Helgemo's opinion shud be respected|pg||
nt|bobholl: east has to guess who has t of @H|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: which Major to lead..|pg||
nt|ady: best lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: bit shy from Bakke|pg||
nt|knutte: running scores: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
nt|knutte: Drammen in the lead, as Heimdal and Bergen shares 1. place with 105 imp|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andersk: How can you be in bad shape if pard can bid 1 M? And if he bids 1 NT tou pass(he often have @C then) 1 NT can be a catastrofe when partner have under 6p and bad majors........I ...|pg||
nt|andersk: rest my case|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very light|pg||
nt|knutte: Drammen leading in the match against Heimdal|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|djneill:  that would help, the @s8 is important not to waste|pg||
pc|h4|nt|murat e: 5-0 break in hearts make it impossible though|pg||
nt|ady: best to play queen  and a low club|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Nice bid by Jensen. Some would dream of 1-3-5-4 by pd and go further|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|murat e: otherwise declarer woujd go between one of the black suit finesses|pg||
nt|panosk: compared to last 1 this 3nt will look a walk in the park for Helgemo|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessed rigth|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok so East now knows West has 4 spades headed by nothing :-)  South cannot have more than 4 spades , so West has 4, per East|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panosk: S ahs to win this and play spades to defeat |pg||
nt|panosk: *has|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gsper:  With the @DA missing, it is difficult to do anything in @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  maybe the @sT, East thinks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: may go down on this line|pg||
nt|ady: must resist a heart switch|pg||
nt|ady: continuation of spade   seems only 8 tricks  unless finessing club   unlikely play|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: knowing E/W open on lowest 4 card suit, east is favourite to hold 4@h's?|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR W opened 1C, E had no problem to bid 4@S|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|andersk: @C 10 convinient|pg||
nt|bobholl: NE now playing tic tac tor|pg||
nt|panosk: dont try it at home as the used to say in TV |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos:  we dont know what 3@h  meant  but seems likely to show red two suiter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with longer @d?|pg||
nt|mamos:  South's values dont look slammish|pg||
pc|cK|nt|djneill:  @s5 (no!)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: correct.|pg||
nt|panosk: spade most probably|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kemperg: Bakke afraid of misfit after P opend 1@H|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|panosk: no @H return K@H must be on side |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|murat e: on a club lead declarer will first be happy and then a sad man.....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: close match and tough hands.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|STRIK3R: hard to get this right|pg||
nt|ady: even on a heart switch  still 1 trick short|pg||
nt|kemperg: to see bidding in OR hoover over the contract|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess 2NT just made (a push)|pg||
nt|bobholl: on board 9 the @H @S game S didn't lead his singleton so 4@S made|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gsper:  I would have banged down the @DA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sJ|nt|ady: assuming only 3 club tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mamos:  we are a long way ahead of the other table 22-22 after six boards scored  - lots more imps to come i'd guess|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|gsper:  But Nybo apparently could deduce from the bidding that it could not be lost|pg||
mc|12|nt|panosk: not a single push after 11 boards impressive|pg||

nt|panosk: 3@S my guess from S|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|panosk: 3@H is beter|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT made in OR  with 5 club tricks off|pg||
nt|djneill:  hmm, East what to lead|pg||
nt|djneill:  same @s as West had almost|pg||
nt|ady: in fact 2@H by n/s can be defeated if defenders take a diamond ruff   |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if you are really positive you lead K of @d|pg||
nt|djneill:  I would tend to play pd for no good suits here, else they would have opened 3rd seat NV|pg||
nt|djneill:  @dK looks good STRIK3R|pg||

nt|knutte: 4 @H will go down with the right def|pg||

pc|h4|nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Jim|pg||

nt|andersk: this board was played befor they got the vougraph broadcast up after problems with card files, dont look at movie, movie is wrong but result is right|pg||
nt|panosk: diamonds make clubs dont|pg||
nt|murat e: open one dia and bid 6 clubs next is the easiest way to reach slam - if south does not open-|pg||
nt|djneill:  I never had success with the "minimum opening hand" weak twos in 4th seat, I don't know, it just seemed not to help|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: np Astrid :)|pg||
nt|panosk: after 3@H by S he has some extra clues|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Interesting board tho|pg||
nt|knutte: 3 more imps to BErgen as Kristiansand has the chance to bring some back on this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 6 @H makes NS on a @D lead|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|STRIK3R: possible pickup here, 3NT makes N/S?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@C opening in OR, not good, to strong for that|pg||
nt|panosk: excellent result in OR for Tromsp|pg||
mb|d!|mb|3C|nt|kemperg: all specs agree an upgrade|pg||
nt|knutte: Did N open 1 @D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: on a non @C |pg||
nt|andersk: I didnt consider other leads than @C or @D :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: contremplating something else as 3nt ?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: sorry no, not making|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: yes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: N looks tempted to rise|pg||
nt|kemperg: rdl = @HA|pg||
nt|knutte: interresting|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: if south makes a lightner double west can revert to diamonds....|pg||
nt|panosk: quite reasonably|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe NS should have a deefence to show MM here|pg||
nt|ady: could make on a heart lead if played by north|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: spade lead best against 3NT    but  around 11 tricks on the lay|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@D ???|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@H dont make|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: sry not meant this|pg||
nt|ady: club lead may hold to 10 as Jack will be played|pg||
mb|4D|nt|djneill:  will be a little worrisome, South the danger hand, hard to avoid South for sure - danger hand being the one you do not want on lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  wellSouth has pushed on to 5@s  which may be a mistake with the bad break - 4@s  might have made but 5@s looks too much|pg||
nt|panosk: can make 5 now|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  North's silence over both 2@c and 3@d seems somewhet less than optimal|pg||
nt|andersk: Actually EW deserve to loose IMPs for not bidding this great slam|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: according to their cc they use suction(yes lek in Norwegian) vs strong 1@c and 2@c, maybe Christer was hoping for some Major fit E/W|pg||
nt|andersk: instead they win 13|pg||
nt|henryb:  10, I think for non-vul|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad defence.....|pg||
mb|5C|nt|andersk: Trust me, Christer pass was not hopeing EW had major fit, too much unlikely|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: any lead but @c played from North|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely fir north to bid no-trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  if West had a suit like AT9x    K8xx  there would be some control over who to lose to when setting up a side suit|pg||
nt|baldjean: no, 5@h is the utmost|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: yes 10  sorry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Old saying: 6-5, come alive|pg||
mb|p|nt|knutte: This will give excitement in the end :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kemperg: bit fast, 3@S or 4@D better, give p a chance|pg||
nt|baldjean: well judged by both pairs|pg||
nt|knutte: 5 @C makes and closes the gap|pg||
nt|knutte: not close, but closing in...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|panosk: had to play @D first to get rid of the losing @H|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: can make 9 quickly with queren of clubs coming down    but cashing ace and king of clubs may create an entry to south for spade threw|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: afraid of @S switch good decision|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must be awake now!!!!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|murat e: he may get trumps right maybe|pg||
nt|djneill:  right, and if North has the @dK, that could happen if clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|STRIK3R: good J of @d discard|pg||
nt|djneill:  the @s spot was encouraging, if 4th best|pg||

pc|cA|nt|bobholl: a push |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now S will make|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

nt|baldjean: club continuation will be awkward for declarer now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|STRIK3R: they are playing last board of the set in open room now|pg||
nt|mamos:  West appears to have missed his chance there   a second @D would have messed up communications|pg||

nt|ralfwil: also declarer, if he had played on @d 3-3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|djneill:  North was under pressure, guarding so many suits|pg||
