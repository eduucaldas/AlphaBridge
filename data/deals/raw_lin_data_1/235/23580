nt|vugraphzft: hi all and welcome to this pre-chamions league final entertainment|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: We start the match with a change of players|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Team Scania thought they could meet the same players in both halfs since they play a complicated system, but it seems it wasn't complicated enough to make the cut|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: W doing some explaining, multi, defense being discussed too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: sorry, but I have the wrong boards -- not the ones they are playing|pg||

nt|muppe: re-hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or sorry, since he has three hearts the ruff is available any way|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but this discussion is academic as Wrang would lead a club|pg||

nt|kattbridge: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but then again, Bergdahl would lead...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: wow, I'm getting dizzy :)|pg||
nt|kattbridge: not as dummy:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|baldfriede: or maybe I am mistaken|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that is not how the players seem to experience it|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  not that Gronkvist-Rimstedt are moving to the retirement home in the near future either|pg||
nt|nilsland:  NS dont make 3N here|pg||
nt|bt: this is a pretty good 5@C but 2 finesses off, and no @CK singleton in west|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hi everyone and welcome back to Örebro where the Swedish Teams Championships take place|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Welcome back! We're doing these 12 boards before midnight here in Örebro|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: This is the very first board EW ever play together|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzft: It denied 3-c supp in @S (which double promised at least four of)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East has shown @S + @C with his 2@S-bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  How come that so many teams were penalised in the first round?|pg||
nt|bt: 4@H has a play maybe|pg||
nt|bt: yes thats interesting, whats with the penalties?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Also welcome to Germ Kemper|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW play strong club|pg||
nt|oliverc: At least West had the sense to stop low|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi  Mikael and all|pg||
nt|mamos:  North has balanced 22 so would expect \\S to o on to game  ah yes  3@c presumably major ask|pg||
mb|4H|nt|nilsland:  So this was a good decision by Cilla|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Mikael and all specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Welcome back|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: We've changed match in the vugraph once more|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone and wellcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They play a two way-club. 2@c shows 0-3 spades, GF unbal or 21+ bal|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Good morning|pg||
nt|muppe: hard to judge these high level auctions|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And they choose to play it in the last half of the last match in the Swedish Teams Championships|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  loks like puppet|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I'm guessing this is a puppet Stayman sequence|pg||
nt|baldfriede: there was a very simliar board in the last set with the same suit distribution, but W held A@h. that confused me|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: game isn't exactly good but has chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: With 3-3 @C this won't be a problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW will score three tricks and that's it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: shd be puppet|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS play an odd system, strong club with trf-openings|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  http://tinyurl.com/7qkzz3q  for running scores|pg||
nt|kemperg: not easy , good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Well, North decided to put the dummy down before the lead was made :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  so N shows a  4 card major and South shows Spades  (by bifdding Hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/Yoda.pdf for their convention card (in Swedish)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This is because last year North here played in team Kamras|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East has shown his five spades and four clubs in the bidding, and West then gets to decide the final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  and strong hand is declarer :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzft: looks like he will lose 1@D and 1@H thanks to the lucky lie in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: an intra finesse in trumps does the work if declarer can handle the rest|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|vugraphzft: NS plays strong club with 5c M-openings|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@c being a GF relay in this sequence|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mamos:  and everything  down to @d98 doubleton is about as helpful as it could be|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: Probably didn't matter though|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/LeMiJo.pdf for EW's which is a more straightforward Precision-based system|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hi!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bt: a diamond back at trick 2 would have made it interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS play very natural with 4c openings. 2@h showed 6+@h and 10-14|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: For running scores, visit: http://tinyurl.com/7qkzz3q|pg||
nt|mamos:  East will bepleased with the outcome of that board|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It would have taken a misguess in spades as well as one in clubs for declarer to go down|pg||
nt|oliverc: definitely|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  An old-fashioned 2@s bid here.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the @c finesse works here, but it is not enough for a slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: declarer went for the percentage play in trumps (if South had Kxx, low to the nine would have cost the contract) and went down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Welcome back to Örebro where we're playing the third day out of four in the Swedish Teams Championships|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hans-Ove is in fact in the lead with 0.5 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It's actually a tactic decision. They didn't want to meet the other pair of team Yoda so they decided to split both pairs in order to come around the rule|pg||
nt|harmon: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  We have a sign in the Copenhagen harbour, it reads: "Keep Denmark tidy, see a Swede to the ferry"|pg||

nt|bt: yea and half the danes can even read it |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but +110 is not bad|pg||

nt|ahollan1: I believe Lew wants it to be Puppet -- but Bart not|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: :) They play a short club with transfer responses and three weak twos|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Friede|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW doesn't rate to make much here, NS should manage about 4@D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzeg: You have to stay out of 5 of either minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW play Pass as 0-7 or 17+, hence the rest of their openings are placed somewhere in between|pg||
nt|bt: brb|pg||
nt|oliverc: How does that come to be in their CC?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 5@h is a make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this contract won't be pretty if Wrang finds a pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: it looks like they can take 6 red suit tricks, the ace of clubs and three trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that would be 800|pg||
nt|harmon: thats quit a result in the other room|pg||
nt|harmon: I mean even with Reisig defending making 6??:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgi:  round 5 updated - http://bridge.bg/ranking1054.html|pg||

nt|kemperg: as Roland explains|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  This is about to go 4 down|pg||
nt|ady: e.w  should settle in 4 of either major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not knowing 3@C showed @D, i thought Stansby might try 2@S Size Ask|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: i wd not bid 2@C here|pg||
nt|mamos:  strange|pg||
nt|baldfriede: neither would I|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or 10-12 with support|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Good a'noon Martin :)|pg||
nt|bt: presumably 2nt is 55+ majors or minors, south guessed which|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW use rather similar methods|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Running scores: http://tinyurl.com/83yevtx|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 8-11, 4@S and any singleton|pg||
nt|kattbridge: they will, don´t worry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Sorry?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5-2-2-4 normally is 1 @s but Wrang thougth otherwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I agree with the NT-opening, it might be wrong but it simplifies the auction so much|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: So we will now follow "The Fight of the Forcing Pass"|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS have the values for game, and enough tricks as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Playing a 5-2 in a major seemed successful on the last board, so why not now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  no reson not  to pas  1NT IMHO|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  N-s would appear to lose a @s and a @c in any suit contrat.|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: Everything breaks perfectly for declarer, he just doesn't know that yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hello Vesa |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: As someone mentions, 6@d was a lucky make on the last board which one of the top teams had to experience|pg||
nt|kattbridge: and now they now it´s time to change to@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South tries to lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that makes East pass|pg||
pc|sT|nt|georgi:  ranking updated + teams roster|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS  abit unlucky here in that South's values are mostly no help|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@C was Stayman, but didn't promise a major|pg||
nt|baldfriede: so a kind of garbage stayman?|pg||
nt|mamos:  garbage is the word|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think 1NT shows @C and 2@S is natural with the strong hand|pg||
nt|po-s: clearly not 0-7...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: oops, that run didn't do EW any good|pg||
pc|s7|nt|georgi:  http://bridge.bg/ranking1054.html|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT was 1 down, this has a chance|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Smörgasbröd comess with everything in Sweden :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@C has put the brakes on|pg||
nt|bt: unlucky for south diamonds will be overruffed in dummy and hearts in hand|pg||
nt|ady: only ace and king of spades as top losers with club finesse on   but 5-0 break makes life difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table  started 1@D-P-2@D[forcing]-3@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: E focused the lead on the wrong suit :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wojewoda playing 3N South -- opening lead .... @C10|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: screen down and Casen is asking questions|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzeg: ... and NS had no problem getting to the right spot|pg||
nt|oliverc: They play the Smörgasbörd 2@D?|pg||
nt|mamos:  not an easy lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a 3-3 @S fit = garbage i suppose :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (Other than @ss, of course.)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: and NT is totally impossible|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@c is a bit tricky with a spade lead too though|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt is coffee board I am not criticising just telling what i saw|pg||
nt|bt: see if ns can sort this out, though i think east ran premature there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I"m covering this table and the Kasle closed room and have been going from table to table - just to let you know how well bridge players at this level concentrate, Drew just ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: noticed I was here :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petka:  the tempo in this bidding worked well for NS. The only one who might feel a bid "underbid" is south, with some extras in her hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i think that blew a trick (not that it was by any means strange)|pg||
nt|bt: and only one diamond cashes|pg||
nt|bt: 2@C was difficult to double |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: yes, that might have bought the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but I guess South would have tried 2NT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|po-s: slam is making?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: perhaps, but it's not one you would like to be in|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: He will at least get 5 tricks now so it won't be extremely expensive|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mamos:  how would he proceed after 2@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if you chose your third suit as trump that is|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@C ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: wow, some partscore overbidding here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sundell knows that his p is short in @H... still a brave 3@C with his 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cant say anything nice about that 3@C bid except it did its job|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kattbridge: I guess tommy plays on spades now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|po-s: before or after?|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  I think that Sout would have dobled 2@C.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, we'll never know now :)|pg||
nt|bt: a slow double of 2@C looks perfect|pg||
nt|bt: :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzft: A trump shift might induce North to take the finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I wonder too. garbage stayman works best with longer @d instead with lonfer @c|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: After a quiet start this can be more interesting :)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6n by north is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1NT showed a maximum (11+) and 3@C was natural, might have been canapé|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if you're still interested|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here comes a board with really bad breaks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: we have Hans- Ove's son Alexander watching his dad in action here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so every VP crucial|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 6@h is down on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: (due to an upper cut)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But 6NT is always making|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Fredin was not happy with his partner|pg||
nt|bt: so the double of 1nt asked for a @S lead, know north will ask why he didnt lead it|pg||
nt|kattbridge: maybe an imp to SS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras won 9 imps on board one when EW played 4H X -1 at the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Krekorian says he was going to lead a heart because "that is my strongest suit"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i could have made a wrong opening lead even without partner's help|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = 10-13 hcp, normally a 6-c suit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petka:  Forsberg-GrÃ¶nkvist leading in the current running scores, but very small differences|pg||
nt|underdogg:  1@d = 8-11, bal/4M5+m/5-5m|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in the end situation |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Mikael and Jim|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a quiet 2@S here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Sivve got off to a nice start when NS in the other room reached 3NT on board 13|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Director has been called|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: hi!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that contract didn't make and picked up 12 imps|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2@h=@h and a minor?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south is shut out of @h |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N now 15-17  [3rd vul and always 4th]|pg||
mb|2C|nt|nilsland:  Ida will bid 2@D now|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and that will end the auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: seems wrong explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: According to EW it's the double that's incorrect, not the explanation|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||

nt|kemperg: position|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass is just plain wrong imho|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Grähs guesses to pass his partner's short club|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW use a strong club|pg||
nt|harmon: 3s a slight overbid for George|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: According to CC a normal weak 2:  http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/pekksalo1.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this will lead to a 4-2 fit instead of a 4-4 one|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras has had a nice start here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: one down in a vulnerable game that could make and then +800|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: let's see if Scania can turn this around|pg||
mb|2S!|an|promises 6 !s|nt|baldfriede: On a lucky day this would be a slam. And this is a lucky day because it is right-sided.|pg||
nt|mamos:  can they bid a slam from North|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d by n also available now|pg||
nt|mamos:  indeed mayne now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North has a very good hand for seing partner open 2@C gameforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang with a successful decision here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Might push NS into 5@H down (it could also make)|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  4 @h needs careful play |pg||
nt|po-s: "making 12" gör jag som spelförare|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yet another 1NT-3NT with a 4c major. We've seen several of these auctions this weekend|pg||
nt|harmon: Steve knows George hence the pass|pg||
mb|2N|nt|nilsland:  East will have no problem making this|pg||
nt|petka:  perhaps they play something artificial after a 1N intervention? so that her choice was pass or 3D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they don't|pg||
nt|mamos:  4-4 major fits are so important|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS doesn't make game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = @H + @C, minimum|pg||
nt|kattbridge: singelton?|pg||
nt|ady: jsut 10 tricks for n/s in hearts    inital pass shows 0-7   or 17+|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 2@S = good-looking hand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bt:  40 and diamonds like that, hmm|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3NT was good, a pen.dbl too|pg||
nt|runnerup:  also 3nt sits|pg||
nt|baldfriede: ah, finally a CC which is in English|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... and this is two down misguessing spades, otherwise only one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: In the other room East opened the bidding on his five-count(in the 6@d-board)|pg||
nt|muppe: this seems makeable, EW had a save available in 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Some players use 2@C as artifical but 2@D is normally nat|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but 2@D wasn't making|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2 @D, 3 @S and 1 @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so only a minor swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Funny thing you mention that. Been a lot of discussion in the swedish forums about how rude it is to make your cc's in english rather than swedish|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I would guess he will finesse spades since it's an odds-on play|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mamos:  south has overbid  in myopinion|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: w/o @H lead it can make i thk|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H showed a bad raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Showing 6-16. They ended up in 3NT nevertheless|pg||
nt|kattbridge: opps, let´s see if F finds hartlead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Håkan thought 3@H showed 5-6 or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: yes, that's true. Diamonds are 3-3 so it might be possible to make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Win with the king, cash the ace of spades and play four rounds of diamonds pitching two hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Fredin is not happy...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|baldfriede: 4@h appears to be asking|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@H= rkc ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It's of course normal when 3433 |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Communications are rather terrible on this board|pg||
nt|kattbridge: interesting contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South alerts Rdbl as some sort of Mancoff, showing xx+ in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: direct seat 2@C is described in SSF [system summary form] as   either @D or 2 suit with some M+m|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room   P-P-1@D-1N//end|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: For specs on bbo however, english is obviously prefered|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3NT is the contract i would like to be in with the EW cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  east migth run to 2 @s but it makes 3nt a good contract -finess =|pg||
nt|mamos:  if North cues Clubs they surely will|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: no, it's just a cuebid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: apparently, and S showed 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They've just have a standard cuebidding auction where North will correct 6@D to 6NT because of his lack of trump support|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, ok, a cuebid then. but that should help @s|pg||
nt|po-s: North and South live so far apart that they wouldn´t understand eah other´s dialects|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well, for me it is certainly easier to have it in English|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Here they have wrongsided the contract|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @c has some extra chances -6 nt you have to finess in rigth red suit |pg||
nt|bt: arvidsson read a lot into the 1nt rebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: win in hand and low diamon?|pg||
nt|bt: this is a make now, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: *diamond|pg||
nt|bt: fredin should have just continued diamonds|pg||
nt|bt: clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  8 in nt -no hope higher and doubled perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think West had bid out his shape and that there was little point in removing 3NT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i guess @C doubleton happens very rarely when u open 1@C|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but with an Ace i wd respond too|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i don't really know their style but I think this is the only distribution when it's only two|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: some pairs (including myself) open all balanced hands w/o a 5c M 1@C, then it's much more frequent|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that may be and only occurs 3% of time, but that is not the reason pass is wrong|pg||
nt|muppe: @h lead cost a trick here|pg||
nt|kattbridge: I mean 3 @S RD|pg||
pc|dA|nt|runnerup:  this lead helps a bit|pg||
nt|kemperg: need a crossruff, but has to make a @D trick first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do they know i keycard is missing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: maybe not now though|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Cruff, 3 rounds of @Ds to pitch a @H and then enter in @SA to ruff 4th @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: According to Peder Linder, North has shown a good slam try with 6+ @C and singleton @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: playing with diamonds as trump would probably have made you happier|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: will be an easy road to 11 tricks for declarer now|pg||
nt|muppe: E need to cash his @c A now unless he wont make a trick with it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Markku|pg||

nt|runnerup:  so proved to be too difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: now that would be interesting!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: only if you can proe that the 12 apostles used to play bridge at 3 tables :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Make jobs for translaters.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras won 11 imps on board 1 when 3NT went down in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so a very likely gain for Kamras on  15|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: it wasn't even a promotion since he had a trump trick by force|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but Sun does not know that... P cud hv @Cqx|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: anyhow, one down is the likely result in 2@H (two spades, two hearts and two diamonds) so that might result in a push|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: he wasn't, Fredin apologized as soon as he claimed|pg||
nt|bt: good choice |pg||
nt|muppe: their only hope is that OR will be in 6@c -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Some very harsh words exchanged|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 10 more imps for Sivve since NS in the other room reasonably ducked game|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Another good breaking board|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not the worst slam /east but 3nt +3 normal result|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Their card does not say enything but 1@C=3+ cards|pg||
nt|ady: was never a fan of the strong pass system |pg||
mb|2N|nt|wygbe1: with that, n might have bid 6c over 5nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in old notes -- EW show controls over 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: interesting opening|pg||
nt|mamos:  loks like a partscore board |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the opening lead was a more successful diamond that removed West's entry to the hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the 10-13 opening once more|pg||
nt|bt: in a strong club framework many would open the west hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzft: EW play Pass as 0-7/ 17+, the rest being artificial as well|pg||
nt|bt: lets see what mr bergdahl decides here, he is creative :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS only have one loser but do not make slam with the bad brakes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: true, but that wasn't the case :)|pg||
nt|muppe: Lucky slam here for EW, but after N overcall it could even be bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: These guys play the most natural version of it |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: sorry, +400 EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: N to take the safe?|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT for EW?|pg||
nt|oliverc: looks like a fairly straightforward 3NT for EW here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: as I said, 5NT was RKC and 6@D showed 0/3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but 3@D by NS is likey down too. let us see|pg||
nt|kattbridge: maybe same system as after 1 NT opening, som play 3 in major as singel|pg||
nt|harmon: forcing club positive response old style precision'|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Bennet and Bergdahl here are two of the more creative players in the tournament|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=Ace or 2-Kings|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: means @H Jxxx and @C Jxxxx|pg||
nt|rodal f: If -1 3NT can be problematic NS. If NS have a safe 3NT they often make 500|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, Stayman instead of transfer?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Think these guys play the NT-system made by former pair Upmark/Cullin|pg||
nt|bt: ns are lucky to find their fit at all|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if west playes for @d to be nicely he has 4 such -by ducking but still only 8 if defenders see the situation|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|chorush: Welcome to the final 12 boards of a nail-biter of a match|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzeg: missed spade-fit here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@d = 8-11 4M4+m/bal/55+ ms|pg||
nt|bt:  unusual, think this is close to a minimum, even in a very positive mindset|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so they knew what they were doing :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that is what happened, West (who is a she in the open room btw) ducked but the defence didn't give her a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we can hope for some fireworks, if not on this board but maybe later :)|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So South determines the hand is worth one bid and elects to make it a @H raise.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@D = relay, 2@H = any M|pg||
nt|kattbridge: I know, it´s against then game of bridge to pass with good cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=4@S|pg||
mc|7|nt|petka:  here is one reason for transfer responses. Playing transfers east could show 44 majors non-forcing with 1C-1D-1H-1S|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If NS atack @H in time they will beat this|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Unless declarer finds to endplay N|pg||
nt|kemperg: thks kib, 4@H , 5)minor, 3010 pts|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3-10|pg||
nt|runnerup:  dangerous opening bid -of course difficult for opponent also ,but even here when south has so good hand 3 @h maybe too high|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Solves the "jobs problem" and convention-card misunderstanding in 1 fell swoop.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I didn't really see the opening lead, sorry!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I'm waiting for someone to come do one of these matches, so at the moment I'm doing two tables and doing my best to get bidding and results in|pg||

nt|minimeck: Our lovely opperator has confirmed that, the powerhouse Milner team is also staring down an 11 imp deficit as we speak, alot on the line here :)|pg||
nt|stewball: S must decide what to do with his 1 entry|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|minimeck: Meanwhile on this hand, South does have some choices to make, exactly, he has 6 "top" tricks and can either try hearts or clubs, |pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be fine here it appears|pg||
nt|stewball: he might have done better to cash a cpl of @s before playing @h|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|d6|nt|minimeck: Agreed, he is now pondering that dillema, he is likely thinking the Q@c is offside for a vul weak 2, but will have no other option in the end :)|pg||

nt|baldfriede: played !N for @h and thus lost the overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Declarer miscounted diamonds and played another one before cashing the A of @H|pg||
nt|mamos:  hands fit very well for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East apologized for not doubling|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i think that's why he was upset|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Our operator is the one and only Ida GrÃ¼nzwiebel from Mozambique|pg||
nt|jcwla:  No real point to guessing the @DJ there as will not provide two pitches for @S, only goal was to try to sneak a trick through.|pg||
nt|bt: unlucky but normal|pg||
nt|bt: nice slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: yes, no reason to expect anything but a push or 3 imps to San Sac|pg||
nt|runnerup:  was it really nessessary to finess when north had bid ,but it is only 1 imp |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/7rrm7az|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3VP is the difference between 1st and 4th at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: was the J@S played    seems like only 4 losers  2 spades and 2 diamonds?|pg||
nt|harmon: 10 imps to Larsen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HT drops for overtrick -- but not if you're in 7|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: didn't he make overtrick?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: has given me many spadeleads :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  26 hcp but just 1nt in cards -rare case|pg||
nt|runnerup:  okk 8|pg||
nt|bt: he passed and after another double he bid 5@D which will go one down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not 1 game contract so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Here EW makes 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and 4@S for that matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: He misguessed heart earlier|pg||
nt|kattbridge: @HQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Surely he had enough of a count to know North couldn't possibly have the K@H|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So it will probably come to South in third seat with a close decision, with 11 prime HCP and four @S I think most would dare to open.|pg||
mb|d|nt|underdogg:  2@c = 8-11 5+@c|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Great 4@s bid.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hmmm.  2@c would seem obvious for s.  Do they play non-forcing free bids?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: At board 3, Göran Adde found a protective 2NT holding 4-4 in the ms after 1@H-2@H which lead to 3@D -1 and 4 imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  EW will play 3N|pg||
nt|bt:  the famous 13-15, very unusual today. some people does not stayman w 4333|pg||
nt|jcwla:  West will show two suits, N does not have a bid.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Now - has West shown specifically the pointed suits, I wonder.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  I suppose either way East might bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah   movie originally showed on-time  but now correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry i doubted you Joe|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Now NS are at a dangerous 3NT it seems.|pg||
nt|mamos:  i imagine this is some kind of three card rtaise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Both these pairs play strong club which is ever so popular in Sweden|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (Negative free bids)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  So, as of the 5 level, their slam potential suit hasn't been mentioned.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H was alerted on South's side of the screen as showing spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North was told it was natural (obviously)|pg||
nt|bt: south has an enormous hand here on this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the +500 in 5@C X earned Team Zang 11 imps when NS played 2@H -1 in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is a good spade game|pg||
nt|runnerup:  pass with 6-5 and 5 @c otherwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  the idea is that after 1C-1red-1M-1N west does not have to guess to bid 2C with 5+, and also that the stronger hand gets the NT. with the transfer approach the weak hand often is declarer, as in 1C-red(transfer)-relay-1N|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Which cna be made playing on clubs|pg||
nt|petka:  ok, nough about that, but many specs were wondering|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: even though I can't see why they would end up there :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  strait forfard game should be -but so i thougth also in last board that they try 3nt -but no|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  What is Wikner's next move? He is a strong chess player also|pg||
nt|jcwla:  OK, an even bigger jump. West will probably raise with such good trumps.|pg||
nt|bt: 6@D a little better at teams|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: Moisant might the best, tough EW are 4-2 in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... it is now being introduced|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now it sounds like a queue bid in support of @ds?|pg||
nt|po-s: better than 5H|pg||
nt|po-s: if you play neg free bids this sounds more like clubs|pg||
nt|po-s: and can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he also plays precision so he's limited to 16 hcp|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Could 2@C be majors?|pg||
nt|harmon: will get  to 4s|pg||
nt|harmon: ( I think)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  i wrote that before he bid :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  looks a noemal 4 @h = ,coffee board-but no 3nt it is|pg||
nt|runnerup:  normal|pg||
nt|kemperg: I hate bidding NT having a 4333|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and if it was it was singleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: (given the 2@S overcall)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This will be interesting|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Or is it specifically @D and @S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  I don't think we know|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Ida?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Think they play it like most people in Sweden, showing @s + other|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but can't you play in 8 cards fit in @h|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Undiscussed calls should be as natural as possible, but what is natural here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@D = always unbalanced, 1NT = 4+ @C|pg||
nt|chorush: tough enough to do one table. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They were doing well at bidding at one table while the other one was playing, but now they're both bidding :)|pg||
nt|chorush: I would assume Stansby has raised to 3NT, or perhaps bid 3D enroute|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bt:  i think the west hand is far too good for 13-15|pg||
nt|baldfriede: then he must havee miscounted @d|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Wd, they got there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Team Yoda gained 15 imps on the last board when their EW-pair got a gift in the shape of 4@cX making|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 11 tricks even|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ok, maybe not good|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but at least decent :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: no, honest, he just bid 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  910 isn't a score you see every day!|pg||
nt|po-s: as long as declarer doesn´t take two spade ruffs and then tries to establish hearts rather than use his diamonds this should come home|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: how would you play the board, PO?|pg||
nt|po-s: must admit I´m a bit influenced by seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: won't make this time anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west in bidding his strength not his suits =support --|pg||
nt|jcwla:  If West did not have @D's, E was perfectly willing to hear @H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Clubs being out of the question|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kemperg: my partners alwayshave a hand like W|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Well, 4@S sort of carries a connotation of a sixth spade here, but W obviously liked the texture.|pg||
nt|ady: sorry forgot lost a heart trick on the unusual play for J@H last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  3@D is only inviting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: on this board, for example, EW's style will give South a harder opening lead problem|pg||
nt|mamos:  it seems unlikely that declarer can go wrong here|pg||
nt|bt: some would upgrade here :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, look at that :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  new suit found on 4-level hmm|pg||
nt|bt: the fredin double :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or maybe not, 1NT is something resembling a balanced hand|pg||
nt|chorush: 3D is in case bramley has 3 hearts|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzft: Everyone's waiting for north to make the lead...|pg||
nt|po-s: ruff, then club finesse?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: strange, 20 count bids once, his partner volunarily with 2 count|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: def shd take the @D ruff and take this down|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: which she didn't have to consider :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3@D is actually worse than 3N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I'm grateful that both of these tables have thoughtful players - I'd never be able to cover two tables with Sontag at them :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: good grief :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Missed game here by NS|pg||
nt|wygbe1: oops - 3n laydown|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@H = 4+ @S, 2NT = signoff somewhere|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt icecold.. 5@C depended on keeping @D losers to 1|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if south playes precision he has 1 @c opening |pg||
nt|runnerup:  this bidding beats me |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Looks like a make|pg||
nt|chorush: well 3S put the kibosh on a spade lead so expect a high diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: I think South was worth one more try with her eight tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, now i have some back up for saying that Bennet is creative at least :)|pg||
nt|muppe: easy 2@s, with @d  3-3  and @s 3-2 probably making an overtrick|pg||
nt|kattbridge: Now they are in big troubble e-v, If you can´t bid at the 2-level, you can def. not bid on the 3-level|pg||
nt|chorush: Bramley will duck the first one and win the second|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Krekorian hadn't seen Bramley's pass, so hadn't bid, but was thinking about the lead not the bid|pg||
nt|chorush: After winning the second diamond, I expect Bramley to play A and J of hearts, ducked|pg||
pc|c7|nt|po-s: now the danger is spade ruff|pg||
nt|bt: i dont think declare should touch trumps here, might make anyway though|pg||
nt|harmon: Strange auction but I dont know their system 3h was transfer|pg||
nt|chorush: Well, I certainly got that one right:)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bt: now 5@C maybe?|pg||
nt|bt: "I have AK"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: :)|pg||
nt|chorush: This lead makes things considerably easier on declarer. He still has to get 4 tricks from the rounded suits|pg||
nt|chorush: Drew if probably trying to figure the relative probabilities of 1 or 2 clubs in partners hands. It wouldlook to me like 1 becasue declarer should have 4 spades, 2 hearts, 3 ...|pg||
nt|chorush: diamonds and 4 clubs based on the bidding|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bt: this wasnt the worst slam ever|pg||
nt|kattbridge: but saved by the enemy:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras is now 0.3 VP behind Yoda|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But they can't gain anything more themselves, having 25 already|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They're depending on Hans-Ove to win|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/86gquww 9:2|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|oliverc: no kidding|pg||
nt|baldfriede: hardly after this bidding|pg||
nt|bt: now 6@S looks very easy, what is he thinking about?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|baldfriede: are we watching ladies?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes but @d must be set up before the 2nd trump|pg||
nt|mamos:  he will havwe worries because if this finesse had failed and there been another force life might have got very sticky|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well bid!|pg||
nt|kattbridge: I guess that 1 nt is a semibalanced min. hand|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 tricks on the lie  with no diamond lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|oliverc: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @h marked with South for the opening... so best to run to dummy and take @H fin i thk|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Hk|pg||
nt|reisig: Just a push result|pg||
nt|ritong: bonjour:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yes, 3H was transfer|pg||
pc|h8|nt|po-s: ok, now he will probably go for D|pg||
nt|bt: a club finesse, club, then a diamond was the easy way|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzeg: Larsson-Berthaeu now in the lead since Grönkvist-Forsberg let 2@D through on 15|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes 4 @h migth make -@s Ace and @s -KJ in @h and @d -@s ruff and more @d -now west out of @s -and makes -but not easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: ouch|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he could have ditched a club on the heart return though|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: then pitch another on the queen later|pg||
nt|bt: he couldnt believe south had this huge hand|pg||
nt|harmon: Bonjour Henri comment ca va (minus those little thingies on the c)|pg||
nt|ritong: i m fine  thanks|pg||
nt|harmon: maybe 1h showed 4s and 3h showed hts|pg||
nt|harmon: Im told by a super expert thats wrong so must be a goerge thing lol|pg||
nt|harmon: 1h nat 3h = 4-4 majors|pg||
nt|ritong: playing transfers over 1@c does not preclude "up the line" process, does it?|pg||
nt|harmon: ok next Im bored with this hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|runnerup:  obviously 450 in this case|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The TD has been summoned|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: because of the alert/lack of alert of 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that it showed spades has been proven|pg||
nt|bt: lead directing doubles gives opps extra room|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bt: but this looks fine too|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang is not fully content with the 4@s-bid it seems|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Well, understandably so. West's @Ds sparkled.|pg||
nt|ritong: and if they play 1@h then 3@h 4/4MM, they have a real handicap for 5/5 strong hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now what?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems Casen's shape is known to be exactly 2434   so that rules out @C ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: friend suggests -- concede making 2|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|rodal f: We see the cards. They don't.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  there was that michael's to help but still difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think South is all to blame, she could have tried 3@H over 2NT or 3@D|pg||
nt|baldfriede: because you said S was a she|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: major suit battle here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South is a female, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@D did not go only one down on board 4, it went three down doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: for a further pick-up of 12 imps for Team Zang|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Strääf didn't find a double in the same position as Wrang did (2@H-4@H) and that cost Zang 11 imps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: finally we might see a game contract|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some discussion maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: West thought 1@H showed @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Was a normal contract and will potentially be 5 imps or so to Team Yoda|pg||
nt|bt: nicely done, and slam was worse if dummy has @D4 and decl the 2 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: board 3 was a push as 3NT was let through at the other table as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Extremely important|pg||
nt|harmon: probaly respond 1s with 5-5 than auction different|pg||
nt|ritong: if 1@h is xfer, chances are 1@s is as well|pg||
nt|ritong: well, next:)|pg||
nt|chorush: now an overtick imp to Deutsch|pg||
nt|chorush: with a high diamond lead the contract was makable but quite difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  south will keep west out of @s so..|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So survives the bid. Admittedly West had a lot of kings and queens for a game that can only lose two tricks.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
mb|2D|nt|po-s: 1NT?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: not the best of slams here for  N/S, but it will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: For running scores, visit: http://tinyurl.com/cpx9t65|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so the case is now with the TD|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we'll go on|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: multi 2@D here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok thats why he bid 1nt -no support |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: As you might have noticed EW play the most natural version of the forcing pass, letting all one openings be 4+ although limited|pg||
nt|muppe: yeah, the only thing that really matters...|pg||
nt|kattbridge: well, 130 or 150 doesn´t matter when you had 500 in your bag:)|pg||
nt|harmon: enthusiastic 6d in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  both pass and 1@c shows 0-7/17+|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT   a possibility here |pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to imagine how they can bid to 6@D, though|pg||
nt|baldfriede: but will they find it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he tried to bid as if he had opened 1@C|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cards still sitting nicely 7 @d on cards -6 ok to bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: H/C|pg||
nt|chorush: Drew is a prettty sound bidder so Krekorian will have some reasons to consider bidding|pg||
mb|2N!|an|asking|nt|vugraphzft: ... probably not|pg||
nt|po-s: how  do you make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Inventive opening by W|pg||
nt|milton_se:  good slam - one finesse out of two|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A lot of penalty VP's have been dealt out during the last three days as teams havn't been finished on time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  1@c as respons to pass opening|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy 3nt here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so moysian 2 @d which playes well|pg||
nt|bt: in theory south has a clear pass, partner couldnt act over 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: not that it explains that much :)|pg||
nt|turnip1:  yes, in a strange way...|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  3N is better than 4@S|pg||

nt|po-s: hearts will work but you may try spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: It takes finding the queen of trumps to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: That might indeed cost the victory now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  biercard also here 7 @d -bidding and play -can you have 2 biers if you bid and it is last also|pg||
mb|3N|nt|runnerup:  something to guess here -best if you find @h J |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 140?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Not that obvious after the take out from West|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  3NT was made by Larsson|pg||
nt|nilsland:  on the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: she got a diamond-lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not that it helps that much|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But they'll get to the spade game|pg||
nt|bt: yes i prefer @H, please dont take it seriously|pg||
nt|bt: now, he is tempted .... can partner have spades? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I don't think you deserve two beers for bidding this grand missing the @dK :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not here but in principe |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And also, in Sweden at least, it doesn't count if diamonds is trump. Is that a local rule or does it work that way world wide?|pg||
nt|muppe: South has nice controls, he should support @d now|pg||
nt|milton_se:  South has an excellent hand now - North showing 5-card @Ds, I presume|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 4+, but still|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  0-4/5-7bal 1@s|pg||
nt|underdogg:  2@c game forceing now from W|pg||
nt|runnerup:  open cards it is easy to beat by @d ruffs |pg||
nt|rodal f: Still the warning came by 3NT, but team and IMPs cost.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: passing the buck|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I would have chosen 2NT over 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Any thoughts?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Might go overboard here.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i thk W was right in pushing his p to bid nt in view of his black suit holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@H = @S, 1NT = 17-19 bal (upgraded)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: once again east was too timid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @d small best now|pg||
nt|kattbridge: Tommy, where are the red card?|pg||
nt|harmon: Lotsa competitive bidding in OR so another big swing to Larsen|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  since 1NT would have been 21-23, 2NT should show 24-25 something :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  110|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sorry|pg||
nt|bt: can east be balanced?|pg||
nt|chorush: 3NT looks like it might make with the location of the heart ace and the club blockage|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|runnerup:  imanigation notist -it is obvious bid .don't you think -and -not for children -that's ehy this brake|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Sorry for that, the client crashed|pg||
nt|kattbridge: well if you don´t want to defend you shuold not double|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Like I said, they hate to be predictable|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Curious 3@s bid|pg||
nt|chorush: It might be beaten by a club lead and a heart switch|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzft: On  1, Hans-Ove won 5 imps for making 1NT in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/89xozn4 for running scores|pg||
nt|mamos:  WEst had a strong  hand  too strong to just bid game also  but you were right uncomfortable now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but 5@D is also a make so EW will only lose an overtrick imp or so|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Or ....|pg||
nt|kattbridge: electicity back:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|runnerup:  but I am still wandering if pass to 1 @s gets better score |pg||
nt|ady: can only see 8 tricks  if playing clubs early  dropping JX |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: np, just wondered if you saw something I didn't :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Maybe North could suggest 3N over 3@S?|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Definitely.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mamos:  as long as they stop :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In case of doubt lead trumps.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  migth have been 80 -if 13. @d will have been switched in rigth moment but not now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so safe level was the idea|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But he does not know partner has hearts too|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Easier for us|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: perhaps he finds Jx of heart a bit scary|pg||
nt|runnerup:  he don't use that card so much -thats why asked (6@h) important for some and bier you can think for any reasons|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oliverc: this looks to have been well judged by both pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 8 tricks  other table tied  4-4 in tricks after same auction|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzft: If he's 8 -12|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Despite the lead directing 1@d - he gets a club lead :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  A stopper is as strong as you make it look like|pg||
nt|ady: 4 clubs 2 hearts with the finesse  1 spade and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: can't he take the diamonds with the heart Q as an entry?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|underdogg:  If someone wants to know more about the system E/W are playing, here's a link: http://bridge.winge.se/mediawiki/index.php/Symetriskt_RelÃ¤pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR play 2@S at B15. Looks like a 1IMPer for Scania.|pg||
nt|chorush: no, not really, the dummy would wind up endplayed with xxx of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: ah, I see and would only have taken 8 tricks at that point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: so I'm back to the other table|pg||
nt|chorush: heart lead was a killer, attacking the transportation between the hand such as it was|pg||
nt|chorush: had some computer problems of my own|pg||
nt|chorush: once upon a time, a finesse worked. I think declarer will take the hearts and the spade ace and hope diamonds are friendly|pg||

nt|stewball: S hand is a good advertisement for forcing @c|pg||
nt|minimeck: 4@s would be interesting here, only 3 losers (@s, @h, @d) but have to work to get rid of the long diamond from south hand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sorry short break|pg||
nt|stewball: he can manage if he gets there|pg||
nt|minimeck: Agreed, the endless debate will likely never end, but hands in the 16-20 range are much more easily handled when the opponents don't interfere :) |pg||
nt|minimeck: with a strong club that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: i'm a 1@s bidder|pg||
mb|1S|nt|minimeck: with an ace north will scrape up a 1nt response, |pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stewball: 2nt forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: guess not|pg||
pc|c6|nt|minimeck: I find this 2nt quite unusual, if Onstott decided to value his hand a "2nt rebid" why not open 2nt to start, I would have expected 3@d but not sure|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|stewball: i think std methods forces it you|pg||
nt|minimeck: Indeed, the need to stop on a dime in 2nt in this situation is not that valuable|pg||
nt|stewball: or gazilli or something similar|pg||

pc|s4|pc|cJ|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|minimeck: In the end result however, it is likely that they have simply stopped in 2nt on 24 hcp, in an invitational sequence, although we are shocked it might work out ;)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d3|pc|d5|mc|8|nt|vugraphzfk: Onstott asks how do we do in 4 spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: sorry, private (which doesn't make it more true :) )|pg||
nt|po-s: nord an sina färgbehandlingar|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: better odds for Hx than 9x|pg||
nt|baldfriede: which probably means "North and his handling of suits"|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if you want to bid 2 @s -weak but partner opens --so cant you defende 1 @s ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And he went down in a normal way|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  oy vey|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  London slang for 'not so good'|pg||
nt|jcwla:  I knew I'd heard it somewhere...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: wow, that's close :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on  4 San Sac won 3 imps for one less undertrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Running scores: http://tinyurl.com/7rrm7az|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  this time 4-4 @s fit maybe not found -1 @h - !nt ..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this better be a game bid :)|pg||
nt|harmon: excellent slam here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i also have trouble choosing 6 vs half-dozen|pg||
mb|1C|an|SAF 17+|nt|vugraphzeg: *less true|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: In sweden we simply put it: "Otur"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  ew may bid game here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: though I don't speak Swedish|pg||
nt|ritong: they woulod certainly find it if left to themselves|pg||
nt|ritong: but here, @ss will obstruct their auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: best bid here would be 3@S showing a 3-suiter, GF|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that will excite W|pg||
mb|1D|an|negative|nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i gotta go now.. enjoy the rest of the session|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And we're back in the slam zone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it will be, i am betting my old slippers on it|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  What was unlucky about it?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but as in many cases Fredin made rigth decisions and his contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Nyström-Upmark kom i 5@C på bricka 3 och vann därmed 10 imp|pg||
nt|ady: can make 4@S     defence cant get 2 club tricks  one goes on the 3rd heart  |pg||
nt|ady: assume the 4 diamonds  shows 10 red cards  e/w not too fussy on suit quality at high levels|pg||
nt|ritong: they have a variante on that theme|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they may play 3@H as showing the same thing|pg||
nt|chorush: 1C=17+|pg||
nt|chorush: 1D=0-8|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  they probably play 1nt conventional|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt best here but may end up in 4@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if west can hold him self quited -he may have the previlise to defende not play @s|pg||
nt|jcwla:  South has a clear pass now. The opening was dubious enough.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i would guess it does (jumping in the suit below the singleton|pg||
mb|1S|an|4+|nt|nilsland:  Interersting pass by N - very disciplined|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West can make 2 H but N may try 2N|pg||
nt|kemperg: no dbl , only 2@Ds|pg||
nt|runnerup:  how wrong I was - 1 @s wasn't in my mind -double perhaps was ,,not perfect double of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT might be Raptor|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@h is a constructive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: You're quite right|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Nice bid by W to show some values.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It doesn't neccessarily have to be unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  I wonder if double is for penalties here? Or is it takeout?|pg||
nt|chorush: 1S= 12d force; with many it could be a four card suit|pg||
mb|1N|an|Deneis 4 spades|nt|petka:  should be penalties|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: They haven't played with each other for long so I don't know if they have discussed it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This will be exciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Rimstedt-Grönkvist leading, both other tables made 3NT on 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Their cc doesn't mention any unusal 1NT-overcall that I can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/TA1.pdf|pg||
nt|bt:  you are right|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/cpx9t65 for running scores of all matches|pg||
nt|bt: i agree on passing 1@S, but bergdahl rarely chooses the "normal" bid|pg||
nt|kattbridge: maybe 4 @H X is a better affair|pg||
nt|chorush: 1 rd force|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  if south passes he bids 1@s and later 2 @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Think after the last two boards, EW will not get away as easy again|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't take much to foresee a slam from west|pg||
nt|bigtrain: grand even opposite @DAQ @HA|pg||
mb|2D|nt|wygbe1: cheap save in 4d over 3n for ns|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: what about 6@c on this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is a standard 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Both 6@D and 6@S make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Cards aren't situated brilliantly for EW|pg||
nt|bt: this is in sweden known as "polish scissors" 55any, less than an opening bid|pg||
nt|bigtrain: west pass is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  If this is it, then W must be careful to start with a low heart to the 9. But w must also set up the spades without aloowing a ruff in north hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Declarer may misplay it thou - you must duck the club|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: W knows E has @C lenght and cd have bid the vul 3 nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: bye all|pg||
nt|runnerup:  east has bad suit but so much that he didn't want to pass -common situation with 5 @c -very dangerous but many bids -life is dangerous|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2NT is a rather nice bid, correctly interpreted it will lead to 3@D making|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i dont believe that ew will find @d -lets see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Nice lead|pg||
nt|kattbridge: 4 harts is making here, if droppig the jack|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to karen allison|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they will play direct 4NT is one thing and slow 4NT another|pg||
nt|kareno: Good morning all from Las Vegas :)|pg||
nt|harmon: Karen just woke up!!!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: one is blackwood, the other is takeout...  don't know which is which for them|pg||
nt|kareno: Been up for three hours aleady|pg||
mb|2S|nt|oliverc: On best defence, 3@S the limit here, but easy enough for NS to let 4@S through,|pg||
nt|oliverc: though, especially if South tries to cash @D tricks rather than leading their singleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Why shouldn't they? There is no point in playing 2NT now as natural?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: woho|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  doesn't 'otur' mean 'bad luck?'|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Thats what my dad taught me|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: in common tongue, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: in bridge circles it's appliable to loads of situations :)|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grabel didn't bid with west hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  ok conventional 1nt -killed that bid -now needs to stop in time -should make on 3-level |pg||
nt|baldfriede: S wonders if his 8 would be enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: making 4@S on 17 was worth another 10 imps to NS here, now ahead by 11 in the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: thing is, this might now make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it can but line is far from obvious|pg||
nt|ritong: major missund here|pg||
nt|kareno: Could a wheel have fallen off here?|pg||
nt|harmon: win 1 imp|pg||
nt|bigtrain: always nice to have the wheels fall off and still win an IMP :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Feldman says no agreement|pg||
nt|harmon: 2 if no sp lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Did 3@h show a singleton spade with 4441, Walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i concur with that evaluation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wager  walter agrees with stayman|pg||
nt|bigtrain: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wait -- you agree with PASS??|pg||
nt|bigtrain: clear pass for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for me too, but i thought you'd argue that there is possible vul game when partner has 4/5@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: opposite most maximum i would guess you would be lucky to make 1 in 5 games|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: screen down; Stansby and Casen having a discussion |pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: looks good, and it's right-sided now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: You might misplay hearts after the overcall, perchance?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but here Scania can get some back|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hmmm...  what else would they lead harmon?  :)|pg||
nt|ritong: as expected, @ss were pesty, even when was able to tell his shape precisely|pg||
nt|harmon: we assume it did|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: The trap didn't fall|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: trump shift?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well, this tells N where the @h are|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i meant not|pg||
nt|jcwla:  This will hold and S will exit a @S in preference to breaking either round suits. Remember as defender, you should avoid breaking new suits unless it's very likely to be right.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Usually kicks half a trick or more each time you do.|pg||
nt|ritong: +east*|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can't say for sure but i assume it did (jumping in suit below singleton)|pg||
nt|chorush: I expect Bramley to make a minimum of 9 tricks on this hand and even 10 seem possible|pg||
nt|chorush: Because of some viewgraphy problems we may not see the complete play|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzft: South accidently dropped the jack of spades on the table. Director has been called|pg||
nt|bt:  accoridng to cc they dont play conventional 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Sjöberg is taking the bull by the horns|pg||
nt|bigtrain: al, i actually think that 3NT would have better chances than 4@S on an 8fit with that hand as a dummy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct:  well he has 8 certain tricks so choices are find the @H10 or the @CQ or let the opponents find one of those card for you|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell don't bother to show the 3-suiters that include 4 of there suit...  thus jump Q = 3-suits short in their suit|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzft: ... He is therefore forced to play the jack of spades now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  coffee one /without this opening =2@h nothing to talk |pg||
nt|jcwla:  Hmm|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@SX would have costed.|pg||
nt|chorush: Bart is an extremely good technician so he is going to be going through the various ways he can take 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|runnerup:  lets say well found 1 @S then|pg||
nt|runnerup:  rigth but average pair rarely has spoken these serious |pg||
nt|runnerup:  should of cource|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This is the Swedish Championship finals, average pairs shouldn't have come this far|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Must have got a suit pref signal there somehow|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzft: and even without prior discussion you can calculate what it shows|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I am very surprised East passed|pg||
nt|ady: will lose 1 heart  1 club and 1 diamond|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzft: well bid and a deserved make is what we can expected|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jcwla:  If so might as well have cashed @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS is known to be a very inventive pair at least|pg||
nt|chorush: start with diamnds, I think|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzft: North perhaps simply chose to make an overcall on his nice 4c suit|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I think finessing in @h won t help you much anyway|pg||
nt|bt: on board 3 yoda gained 11 imps, though there was possibly a tactical hesitation by north, so director is called|pg||
pc|s6|nt|runnerup:  ok -sorry but lets say you have to 'nose' these places|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @s is optimistic and was it nessessary for south to bid 2 @s -perhpas not|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps|pg||
nt|runnerup:  was sugseeded that delayed raise shoe extra -this not -ok in that case 2 @s was the bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang counted South for 4@S (he thought they played support redoubles)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|runnerup:  every time I try that -partner has xx and 7 points -and we play there insteadt of 1nt +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The jack of hearts was costy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzft: I guess we're all born with different ammounts of luck :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  YES  South's line in 4@s on Board 17 in OR is a bit of a mystery  |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... but they missed slam on  5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzft: The question asked to the director now is wether it's ok by North to draw conclusions from South's switch, knowing it was forced|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: nose?|pg||
nt|kattbridge: so next time they have their bid :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems like the team names are reversed. Deustch usually plays for Deutsch|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|mamos:  declarer doing well here  maybe too well ofor his own peace of mind|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct:  west needed to cash the @CQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzft: I still can't see how 2NT can possibly be natural :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is more and more looking like a comedy of errors|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Dave.. no harm in that|pg||

nt|baldfriede: hm, should have been an overtrick. N/S have no way of cashing their @h trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South's only chance was play for AK with East|pg||
nt|mrdct:  6@H and 6NT are good here for NS|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 6@H is a great contract here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang says he would have made if the AK of @C would have stood up|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Was down one in the end anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But could have been more gory|pg||
nt|bt: the ns pair plays 2nt as "9-11 (semi)balanced, no 4 major, not mandatory" :)|pg||
nt|bt: unluckily west will open first here|pg||
nt|bt: and he has a major|pg||
nt|bt: meanwhile ns at the other table took a toilet break, during bidding, unusual|pg||
nt|bt: we have a fire alarm in the hotel, so play is closed right now|pg||
nt|bt: maybe fredin was very upset over the hesitation|pg||
nt|bt: there is supposedly a fire there, lets hope everyone is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Uheld|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/83yevtx for running scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: He could have made by ruffing with the nine or jack of spades instead of pitching|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes this beats really true no entry -was so clever defence that rarely seen |pg||
nt|milton_se:  good play from both sides|pg||
nt|runnerup:  very soon|pg||
nt|kareno: So here Feldman had almost enough information anyway.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think he was trying for grand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't need much|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: team names are reversed here, so IMPs going to the wrong team.  Apologies, but not easy to fix until the next segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: he claimed 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: which means he played the queen of hearts from hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras have picked up 4 more imps on 16 and 17 for an undoubled undertrick vs one doubled and one undertrick vs two|pg||
nt|ritong: a not-so-rare accident with strong@c, when opener does not show a suit at opening and opponents preempt violently|pg||
nt|kareno: Nope... one more ace.  |pg||
mb|1C|nt|kemperg: sorry had 4 in mind|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S not friedly but.......|pg||
nt|turnip1:  Now 4 teams within 3.3 VP|pg||
mb|1D|nt|runnerup:  partial only here @s /@d but lets see if more in bidden|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  After all the effort we have to put in to teach novices to finesse, we have to put in even more to teach them when not to.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  a solid 6 @s here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6nt the same|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand   |pg||
nt|kareno: But when you are so squeezed in the auction, perhaps it's better to make a bid that avoids misunderstandings|pg||
nt|bigtrain: competing vs new partnerships is usually productive...  established partnershis, not so much|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nilsland:  She is used to play with Micke :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: even though with a duck of the lead, it's making|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I'd rather not interfe as S here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: interfere*|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here I agree with South's bud|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: you're 5-5 with decent intermediates|pg||
nt|po-s: om Väst skulle ha ru Qx så vore andra vändor inte så bra|pg||
mb|1S|nt|underdogg:  8-11 5+@d, no 4 card M, if only 5@d he will have 4@c as well.|pg||
nt|kemperg: brave 3@D without @Hs|pg||
nt|runnerup:  to beat 3 @s you have to lead @h Ace|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol and an eight count|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: you take away the two-level from your opponents|pg||
nt|oliverc: very true|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A 12-15 NT, not that common|pg||
nt|runnerup:  standard 3nt ..continues|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with all the controls i guess Sundell shd prefer the @H contract|pg||
nt|mrdct:  6NT is quite a bit better as you can survive 7-1 @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3@H is slaminvitational w/o ShS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/86gquww for running scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: E: "At least I'm entertainment!"|pg||
nt|kareno: Double would not be negative by Feldman, rather penalty (spec asked)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ;)|pg||
nt|ritong: pass and pull certainly was his strongest possible move|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the last auction?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|chorush: Onstott has optimal result in other room|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzft: 2@S = a bad raie|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: *raise|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west is not afread -2 @c majors -so can east holm him self low|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: I'd say it was more the competition in its whole's fault. Then of course we had boards of our own that made the whole difference. But yes, it was rather annoying that everything ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: would end with that board...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tough lead for E|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i can count 10 hcp, and it's not like partner is going to punish me when he's pre-passed|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Uheld is Danish|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Interesting, double or 1NT with N? I think 1NT esp since we have seen 1@C could be short.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but don't he finess @h then |pg||
mb|3N|nt|wygbe1: pretty routine hand|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: indeed not|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i guess he'll just launch into keycards now|pg||
nt|smispi: sempre uguale|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  4H looks nice here|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR B17 ended as here in 3NT with a @S lead. Looks as a push.|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  some carefull play needed like @c Ace and @h away now after @h A|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: could E make a take out now?|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Now with known 8-card fit E will probably bid 2@H.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  skall inte sitsen vara klar sÃ¥ dags?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i assume they are playing inverted pass-double|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Hi again! After having evacuated the hotel due to fire, we're back and ready to play|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Welcome to Markku|pg||
nt|jcwla:  This just seems to be guesswork.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: He passes with the words: "I'm too tired"|pg||
nt|turnip1:  And these 4 meet in final round|pg||
nt|smispi: sorry|pg||
nt|harmon: Danooooooo|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem, dano  just jump in amigo|pg||
nt|chorush: well, maybe not|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nilsland:  3Nt is also making|pg||
nt|runnerup:  no double -ok but some of|pg||
nt|mamos:  it might be your opponents who punish you :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Might have pushed EW into 4@H which partner can double|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Only 8 tricks here, unles there is a miracle|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@C = GF relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = 4@S, 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The show must go on!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Perhaps not the best argument but|pg||
nt|po-s: he should have, but who knows|pg||
nt|ady: as long as K@C not played on a club switch now  will make|pg||
nt|harmon: Carbonara first tho dear|pg||
nt|ritong: sounds reasonable|pg||
nt|kareno: East marked with just about all the high cards, of course.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seem to be an overabundance of 41 trump splits today|pg||
nt|chorush: looks like this heading for down 2 and -200|pg||
pc|s4|nt|baldfriede: unless*|pg||
nt|baldfriede: May be less.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if the opponents catching you is what you're worried about you should compare that to all the upsides of acting|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i dont think that it is easy to bid -claiming in declarer play is easy|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzft: N has shown 45+/54+ in the minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Slam is on the heart guess here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Nilsson paused for some time over 1@H, might give the show away|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @d the best spot|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2NT = short clubs (4531/4540)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Dave if S can find out his P having the @Dj orany of the black queens|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The fire was not so big but could be put out pretty fast|pg||
nt|ady: now will make whatever|pg||
nt|ritong: check @ds, claim 11|pg||
nt|kareno: Atta way, Henri :)|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: subtle pun:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petka:  the spade situation allows 3NT as well, but 4H looks like a great spot|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But there is the Chinese art of Wu Wei - acting by not acting. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: lol :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this lead was not a success|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @d asking for longer major|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Killing lead = @H9 :)|pg||
nt|kattbridge: I guess Fredin finds it|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  With his reputation|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: That would be very interesting :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  he has QJ103 in clubs -if he leads @h 9 I aprisiate|pg||
nt|po-s: he has done it from ace but declarer then put up king|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  so if he leads a club, ha can't have the @HA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzft: 1@S-2NT, 4@H (void)-4NT, 5@H-6@S would be a rather standard sequence to the top spot|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so in a good day 6 @d |pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzft: This has chances|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Declarer dont know who has the @DA so will maybe play for clubs|pg||
nt|oliverc: the only lead not to give a trick away, but East will be continually endplayed here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This looks just as good|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is not a good day|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: not the most successful lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think south will bid 6@H to protect his @DKx or @CKxx depending on which ace is missing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and with 1 key card missing the side suit kings are vulnerable on the opening lead in a NT Contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: At the other table slam was missed after a brave 2@D multi by West|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so 11 more imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
nt|mrdct:  assuming 4@c was a cue, south knows that the missing keycard is the @DA as partner didn't bid 4@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: brave indeed... fortune favoured ..|pg||
nt|po-s: so question is  has he ever done it from queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: walter - once 44 fit is found, do you have a way to give opener choice of 4M/3N?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: after a NT opener...  no|pg||
nt|bigtrain: after a neb...  yes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nilsland:  and could go down then|pg||
nt|runnerup:  easyer now |pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzft: if South, like North, thought 4@H promised a void|pg||
nt|bt: hey just dont realize its a standard 3nt|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Frederic decided he did'nt want to misguess|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petka:  after 2S and showing AKxxxx spades I guess she knows where the DA is :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  So South should play another spade|pg||
nt|runnerup:  should duck first as cards lay-now 4-0 in trumps beats|pg||
nt|bt: they|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i haven't had the chance to read what 3@D is|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north is very weak for opening and south optimist|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 4@C set @D, 4@D = minimum, 4@H RKC, 4NT = 1/4 and 5@C asked for the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|bt: north has an opening hand in most systems, except roth-stone|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 6 imps went "Sivves" way when 2@H went down in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Many people tell me it's a make now, and I agree|pg||
nt|kareno: We don't make no safety plays :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting idea posited in one chat    3OM = 4-fit with either slam ambition OR COG with bad trump|pg||
nt|bigtrain: there just isn't enough room after a NT opener to do everything|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nilsland:  and look like a woman with the @DA|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but clearly, this was enough as North risked a raise|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Perhaps W could find a double here to show real @C's|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but we should remember we're seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|po-s: really|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang unhappy when the table came down|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kemperg: OK till now|pg||

nt|kemperg: or @H finesse|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but now he is home -tempo ok |pg||

nt|sunsamvar: E knows that p has near yarborough|pg||
pc|hT|nt|runnerup:  making contract found |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzft: i think 3@D denied a void (therefore 4135)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nilsland:  the play is slow from one table so we prob wont know the the result when play is finished here|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: in that case we'll keep table open|pg||

pc|hA|pg||

nt|kemperg: N has to downgrade, 4333 and to much quacks|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i see :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i look at the bad suit of only five cards and say it's not even close|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i prefer both pass and double to 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: double would work out great this time as we get to diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Not the luckiest of breaks on this board either|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Will probably result in two down|pg||
nt|milton_se:  comes off cheap, though - just 150 or so|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: If you weren't with us before and have reacted on the strange bidding methods: Both pairs play forcing pass|pg||
nt|harmon: 4s can be beaten on a trump lead I think|pg||
nt|chorush: it has been alerted as a utility; presumably some kind of mark time bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|runnerup:  4 @s looks = now only bid -west surely cant pass to 1 @s -he did|pg||
nt|kemperg: no score on board 5 also in 3NT instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|kemperg: un expected pass|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west had 16 hcp -pass was covards bid -some bid must be there -1nt /2c --no pass|pg||
nt|runnerup:  now has to avoid sing lead|pg||
nt|kattbridge: finns det annat ! än det under 1 :an?|pg||
nt|po-s: över?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: neb = nebulous 1@D opener (part of precision)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: COG = choice of games|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Right u are Germ|pg||
nt|mamos:  @cQ is a very big card|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@S 1st-in-hand on that distributed pile of rubbish? I hate it! LOL|pg||
nt|mamos:  me too how horrid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on this lead lead, it looks hard to make 12 tricks however|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but no|pg||
nt|jcwla:  W has some clues not to go on now with @H double by N, probable balanced hand in E, no raise by S.|pg||
nt|kattbridge: ja, men jag har gamla versonen av bbo, nedladdade programmet|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: can he make this?|pg||
nt|kattbridge: tack alla som hjälper icke datanörd:)|pg||
nt|kareno: West can get in only once but that could be enough.  |pg||
nt|chorush: likely, when followed by spades it will show some kind of good 2 spade raise|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kattbridge: @H|pg||
nt|po-s: BRA!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or we was wrong:)|pg||
nt|kattbridge: tuff des. for tommy, he´ll raise, and the ns has to get  their 5|pg||
mb|4C|nt|chorush: in 3 bids, Stansby has bi suits in which heholds a total of 4 cards:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  EW  not enjoying this  set much |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I expect most to not open the East hand in a natural system|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here it might drive partner to slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H is ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs careful play however|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i guess it depends on what partner counts you for, vul against not all my partners will expect way more than this when it comes to suit quality/trick taking potential|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true M... but exchange the @SA and @Ha and 4@H is a nice vul game..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think heart 9 and run it, then discard on spade return|pg||
nt|kattbridge: and now, ein hattrick|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sunsamvar: that cud be missed ina 1@S p 2@S sequence|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this lead doen't hurt -@s and you have some work for sure|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Time to get a @S on the table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 2@D showed some different hands, a weak jump shift in @H was one possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, Sivve might get back the imps they could lose on the last board on this|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS clearly did too much on this board|pg||
nt|chorush: anyone who knows what is gong on is perfectly welcome to tell me|pg||
mb|4N|nt|baldfriede: I don't see how to avoid slam now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 4NT was bid and interpreted as a signoff|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: which helped the cause|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, oh. I'll eat my words|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ady: they might sneak this if quickly making a 2nd heart|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|oliverc: A classic case of North just being too busy|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: it's not like I would pass that out if I pass the first time :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but then u have to come in at the 3 level :)|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Don't see the rush for a @C lead considering it's basically a placeholder for them.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: I have beentold that 3D shows spades and heart shortness and that cuebids followed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: north awake|pg||
nt|chorush: Ideally, declarer would play for 6 spades tricks, 5 clubs and a heart, but the club lead attacks his communications for this|pg||
pc|c2|nt|runnerup:  in 3 @c -fredin made he has halfly rigth he got 110 -but other table in 2@h ew and -300 so lost 5 imps anyway|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|milton_se:  he knows theyÂ´re leading - OK to loose 5 but not 12 :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzft: sure, but that's life|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos:  no chance for South to evalauate her hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kemperg: defense can take 5 tricks, but I have to see it:)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  If I opened the n hand (which I would with some pds, not with others), I'd rebid 2@s.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|kemperg: not brave:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Assemi overcalled 1N instead of DBL|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzft: but none of the Wests in this match agreed with me as they both overcalled :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jcwla:  WD, do what you believe to be right and do not live in fear.|pg||
nt|muppe: well, you could make 4M and then loose 12 also|pg||
nt|chorush: he has two winning positions diamond ace on and heart ruffing finesse and on losing position (heart finesse)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kemperg: no:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: He excuses himself to his partner when he puts down the dummy, he didn't see the vulnerabilities and should have passed on 1@HX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opposite passed hand in partnership that opens [almost] all 11 -- do you DBL or try 1N Walter?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|runnerup:  looks like multi weak 2 in @h/@s maybe|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|jcwla:  Now can ruff @S and hook trump for 4|pg||

pc|h2|pc|d5|pc|c5|pg||

pc|h4|pc|d8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|chorush: which he did|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d6|nt|bigtrain: if the hand qualifies for 1NT i almost always choose the option|pg||
nt|chorush: here he makes his first crtical gues. If it is a heart, he will make it perforce|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chorush: if it is a diamond, he has a choice of heart finesses|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|stewball: it was a complete glove but i would bid again with S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|minimeck: Indeed, decisions like that also frequently come down to state of mind, if he thinks he "needs" a swing or is content to just sit back. |pg||
nt|stewball: the real issue for me would be if there was danger in getting to 5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|minimeck: Agreed, there would be some concern of that, for sure, they can always get a diamond ruff and things like that :) |pg||
nt|minimeck: This looks to be a relatively calm 1nt, EW can take 3 clubs 2 diamonds and the king of spades from here for down 1|pg||
nt|stewball: would be nice if 4@h promised good trumps but i dont see why it would w/o agreement|pg||
nt|minimeck: or they could just take 6 without even establishing the club or spade, either way, same tricks :-) agreed john|pg||
nt|stewball: i think that one is going to cost|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: bates in the tank keeps looking at his cards and then the dummy|pg||
nt|stewball: but we shall see|pg||
nt|minimeck: One of the most interesting aspects of bridge, it is the only game i can think of in the world where the players do not know the score. :)|pg||

nt|rodal f: A spec told me that Ns hand are wourt 13,15 if u go at KNR. Agree him.|pg||
nt|kemperg: W could see 8 black tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS have missed two games but did good on the slam hand|pg||
nt|baldfriede: very close match now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if you open 2nt -minors and has no way to stop in 3 @c when partner is weak that is strange .speculiar -not common what ever you call it|pg||
nt|jcwla:  That defense probably will not make EW's career highlight reel.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  NS are due somewhere between 420 and 500 here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: San Sac stopped in 3NT and won 11 imps on the potential slam board|pg||
nt|muppe: unlikely though but possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well other room still stopped in 2N but it seemed worthy of quick chat|pg||
nt|chorush: give Krekorian some credit for his subtle lie with his club cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Strong @C to come|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here EW in the open room did well to bid the cold 4@S, NS then took the sacrifice in 5@C for 300|pg||
nt|jcwla:  N may have a 5-over-5 decision and as usual it will be wrong to go on.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  surely wd -not the best lead but still was many dangers -here 4 @s and this vulnerability ew can to nothing over it|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Larry Cohen has a great quote about how often it is wrong to bid 5 over 5 when you're thinking about it: "Yes, even this hand!"|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzft: i'm sorry for dozing off a little|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  hmm -yes makes ok|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: Despite the miss a good board for EW|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I would open @s hand here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the only reasons not to ould be 44 in majors over 1m opener or being a fraidycat at unfavorable valnerabilty  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 1@D = 8 -11, 4M and 4+m/bal/55+ ms|pg||

nt|runnerup:  they don't believe books or Cohen ..5 over 5|pg||
nt|jcwla:  "Who sent for you?"|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  He has no idea of what 4@Swas based on|pg||
nt|jcwla:  The preemptor's job after preempting is to allow it to do its work.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  In stony silence.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  pre-empter has time to go to toilet =pass ..but not here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the fascinating thing about bidding 5 over 5 is that you tend to remember that 1 in 10 times it was right to do it|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: losing two spades, two hearts, one diamond and one club|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: the slam on 19 was a push|pg||

nt|runnerup:  I am interested how 3 @h went off lets see|pg||
nt|runnerup:  chance for 7 imps if ns in @d |pg||
nt|ahollan1:  55  opening bid in other room ..... 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: Disciplined pass på South|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3NT down when @H is played on time|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt is in danger if you find @h lead -a lot depence who is declarer|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: both souths passed |pg||
nt|runnerup:  you cant see it ok looks strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A misguess in spades perhaps?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes seems possible but you need to play @d 3 times ..but maybe|pg||
nt|runnerup:  up to 4-level|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like its routine since you will get high level @H bids|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzeg: *by|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good result for Sivves from open room|pg||
nt|friggi: % wise not so good|pg||
nt|baldfriede: one does not finesse first round if finnesing 2nd roujnd is enough. that way you get a slightly increased chance if a singleton Q is behind you|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: +620 is a nice result for Sivves from the open room|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and again partial -nearly pass out hands |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this will gain Hans-Ove some imps|pg||
nt|turnip1:  he could have made it this way though if N was void in diamonds...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@H was let through at the other table so Sivves won 13 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Tricky to find after an unnatural diamond opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and the championship|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but in other room final contract is 3@H East|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if South openes 1@D i doubt N will stop short of game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  but surely it will be lattened at this table|pg||
nt|mamos:  flattened|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras won back 10 imps on  8 when they made 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: there is no complete record of the play but I think it was on a double squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It's unfortunately not possible to view the bidding from the other table since we had to close down the vugraph|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But ending up in 3NT rather than 4@h was well done|pg||
nt|jcwla:  misguessed @S's in OR after losing two @C's and 1 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/83yevtx for running scores|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes you open 1 @d and you have @d 's bad luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Now however, it's there|pg||
nt|muppe: does 2@s show both @s and @d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yes, it's natural with 5@d4@s|pg||
nt|milton_se:  must be so|pg||
nt|muppe: then N may compete to 4@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  @s lead beats also|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3 @s and 2 Aces|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3NT now  might get @C start|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, that 3nt appears to very wobbly to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i am not so sure about that, could go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i predict a push on this board as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: last hand west should not overruff wth ace near the end   will take 1 monre trick|pg||
nt|bigtrain: anyone opening 3@D with the soouth hand should lose their license to bid with precision :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stansby does not have prototypical 3@C bid|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcwla:  Not sure why Upmark volunteered to raise a level against silent opps.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Seems like a hand you can choose what to do later, you are not in fear of anything they might do.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They now have a healthy lead of 1.5 vp|pg||
nt|bt: yes of course, i forgot that|pg||
nt|chorush: got us a tie with 5 boards to go|pg||
nt|chorush: every trick is meaningful|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzft: They might end up in 4@H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: just to continue my streak of not bidding as the players, I consider that a 3@D opening :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: over an opening 3@D bid West wd bid @Cs and cross the 3nt level|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: which would have made matters a lot worse for EW|pg||

nt|wygbe1: the moral of this set seems to be -- play 3nt whenever possible|pg||
nt|friggi: I disagree - as a matter of desperation you should:)|pg||
nt|bt: ew got to 4@S here, nicely done, is this finally the hand fredin has been waiting for with all those ace leads against 3NT?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzft: It's far from over!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well that is definitely true   their (1N)-2@C = 2 suits same color|pg||
nt|bigtrain: t count when commentating ;pppppppp|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Thanks everyone for watching, thanks to the commentators|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: +400 is a big result for Hans-Ove|pg||
nt|friggi: 4NT?|pg||
nt|mamos:  a friend of mine once told me that it was often a good idea to redouble because it was much harder to defend then  the defenders were less confident and more likely to err|pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to imagine a 6 IMP swing to NS from here|pg||
nt|mamos:  its possible |pg||
nt|oliverc: possible but unlikely :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes -this looks like 3nt ew so ew migth evenlise this match |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if Nopenened 2@C strong Sshd bid 7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think maybe was some other meaning|pg||
nt|turnip1:  Was deliberate|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i checked with my sister (operator in the other room) and that was it meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he meant to open 2@D?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes tx all -partial again -bye |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Important decision to make|pg||
mb|1H|nt|oliverc: help BUT feel... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i just checked and it wasn't, declarer simply got 11 tricks when West ruffed air in clubs and cashed the ace of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS in the open room bid and made 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that's impressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: *to be|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Team Yoda currently has a small lead: http://tinyurl.com/7rrm7az|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but three other teams have good chances at the gold medal as well|pg||
nt|milton_se:  y, but they only have 16-14 in reality|pg||
nt|ady: last hand ofthe session|pg||
nt|kareno: Careful timing should result in a push board.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: spelling that is|pg||
nt|chorush: for any of you who have never been knocked out of an event by 1 imp, it is much worse than losing by 40|pg||
nt|chorush: remember the BBO score is NOT official, so for those of you who are trying to figure out how 1NT went set (I can't wither) it might not have|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  ctually 5 @D was off -but west helped -under leading @S ace was nothing but when he took 2 tricks by ruffing and @S Ace .his partner had Q and he 10 in @D if he sees to switch to @S his partner ruffs with Q and his 10 will beat 5 @D but no he|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: a rather dull last board as well|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oliverc: great 4@S bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this contract looks like one down for 8 more imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Last hand of the tournament|pg||
nt|ady: thx all    thx specs   Ida|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Thanks everyone for watching, commentating and caring. We've had loads of fun! |pg||
nt|bigtrain: spelling doesn't count that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  56  Bates playing 4@S East|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  at board 8 -4 @s was made @d lead and small @d to get ruff(s) -not best idea -8 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or, now it's a make|pg||
nt|oliverc: or making|pg||
nt|turnip1:  just made...|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  switched to @d and 10 and Q fall together|pg||
nt|runnerup:  that is well done (lucky ) --this time @c well placed but still needs a lot to take 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla:  so at most 24 hcp no monster fit - pushy|pg||
nt|jcwla:  and the play was not commensurate w the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: .. and then you add about 3 point because you play on the Swedish national team :)|pg||
nt|bt: bad idea :) but if he doubles they might avoid 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  Grabel 4@S west after transfer|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll bet on -1 for that contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.bjeagle.se/bridge/resultat/damer/trial3.htm for the results, table will be kept open until we know who qualified|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks Rodal and Ida|pg||
nt|runnerup:  she sorry |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 4@H is a rather good game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: and of coarse the specs ty all|pg||
nt|oliverc: K@S was obviously singleton and Declarer cannot pick up Kxxx in the South hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: anyway|pg||
nt|chorush: this looks like 1NT making 1 amd 2 imps back to deutsch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: No, it really did - or at least, Drew wrote -50 on his scorecard :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzft: but 3NT on East has some play|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on a heart lead it's actually cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and West has shown 14-16 hcp with this sequence so he will at least make a move towards game|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Gazilli coming up|pg||
nt|runnerup:  normal game here |pg||
nt|runnerup:  tx all-bye -some chances even for 170 here but surely 140|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Next we're broadcasting two of them, San Sac - Kamras|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: slam makes on an aggressive lead|pg||
nt|kareno: I think the auction is wrong - north bid 2@c drury and south bid 4@s|pg||
mc|7|nt|vugraphzft: We'll be back tomorrow at 10:00 local time, in roughly 10h30m|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 12 tricks with this lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: What what you guys have opened with the North hand?|pg||
