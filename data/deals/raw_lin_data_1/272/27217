mb|1N|nt|BroLucius:  All the sessions that I have watched in this week-end's Camrose have contained excellent deals. We have been lucky.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  3@C is normally played as forcing to game. It should not be used unless you have the playing strength to consider an 11-trick game in the minor. You can rebid 3NT otherwise to get a choice of games.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|BroLucius:  Looks like declarer is OK, if he gets four spade tricks.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Declarer knows if that is a true lead he has 3@D 3@H 2@S and a club|pg||
pc|d9|nt|paulhac:  The 10 @S coming down is a bonus|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|BroLucius:  Yes, the defenders cannot force two club tricks so declarer has time to play diamonds himself.|pg||

nt|CopeyJ: Most pairs at international level do not play strong jump shifts any more|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  I was watching a junior international event the other day, where there was a cold slam available. England's opponents passed out 2@C, not realising that it was the strong opening. |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: John Phelan has heard enough - wheel out old trusty and bid 7|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  They had recently changed from a system where 2@C was natural and weak. A cold grand was bid by England.|pg||
mb|5H!|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  To spare the opponents' blushes, I am only going to write up the deal in English Bridge, rather than Worldwide Bridge. |pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: Well done|pg||
