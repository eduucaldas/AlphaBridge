nt|vugraphzxz: welcome all in 9th round of Maharashtra State Pairs Finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: here is the slam that i was talking abt earlier -if only the EW in other had heard me....|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14    (11)=this vul|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 3N or try for penalty??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you can double and decide latter|pg||
nt|p dalvi: precision C |pg||
nt|psridhar: declared by E it doesnt even need the @h hook|pg||
nt|p dalvi: anal prob thinking about mild slam try |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|desinka: pass-pass? and Kovachev's decition|pg||
nt|desinka: ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass shows willingness to play 2@c doubled|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, 6+@C|pg||
nt|xenya: S had better bid now|pg||
nt|desinka: or good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|rick3son:  we had a 2@d double in the last board of previous set that meaning wasnt clear to both partners that was quite significant|pg||
nt|p dalvi: 3nt likely contract |pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: kastaubh's final leap to 5@d is inexplicable|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: so.. S.O.S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the question that partnerships must answer    over DBL what is difference between RDBL and 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: so it's 2@H?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5N =choice of slam|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|p dalvi: and will make |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this RDBL = SOS|pg||
nt|desinka: as one of the kibs suggested|pg||
nt|rick3son:  spot on David|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normal agreement after  2@C-DBL    PASS=@C  2@D=@D   RDBL =  pick a major|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can he escape down one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and a number of specs getting that one right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to me this is 100% penalty but we have visited this ambiguity before|pg||
nt|rick3son:  seems like players are making match point bids frequently|pg||
nt|offthebend: as we can see , even 5S will go down unless H finesse and D finesse are taken |pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|psridhar: now the gap widens|pg||
nt|psridhar: making the recovery task tougher|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psridhar: this is a top trick slam -not chancy as i misread at first glance, costly miss by EW in other room|pg||
nt|offthebend: safe contract |pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: 4 @h = SPL|pg||
nt|p dalvi: subhash 2nt ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: Puppet to 3 @c on table|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|p dalvi: 1nt is 8 to 13 but gen one should play in 3NT from strong hand so can negate with 1D and then bid game |pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: good point Leon|pg||
nt|rick3son:  often player are unable to double for penalty many partnerships have X always take out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is a total waste of diamonds to double for penalty, partner always runs|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: i made a lot [more] enemies back when i played in clubs -- saying the club members played their best matchpoints at imps  and their best imps at matchpoints|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: somehow they realized it wasn't a compliment|pg||
nt|p dalvi: C ?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|offthebend: from Anal's point of view -- he should explore D fit if there is any possible slam |pg||
nt|p dalvi: ok starting showing shortness may be |pg||
nt|offthebend: 2NT as a puppett can be used for various things |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|offthebend: for any possibility of Spade Slam , opener had to at least SUPER accept |pg||

nt|vugraphzxz: S claimed 1 down giving 1 @d trick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|rick3son:  "spec asked what is meant as a " matchpoint " bid      this is meant to say that in a matchpoint game you may not mind going off 500 or 800 because you have just lost one bd whereas at imps you may lose a big swing as 12 imps or greater|pg||
pc|h4|nt|p dalvi: hanif wants some swingy boards now :)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 1 or 2, how is that for non-answer|pg||
nt|p dalvi: declarer could have made 10 using his entries well |pg||
nt|psridhar: 38 in 4 bds is improabable|pg||
nt|p dalvi: 3s down 2 vul costed 8 imps |pg||
nt|offthebend: Cabal is going great guns so far - 20 unanswered Imps |pg||
nt|p dalvi: 3 sets of 10 boards finals |pg||
nt|offthebend: yes 30 boards |pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzxz: EW are playing SAYC|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S opener?  no they don't play 2-suiters|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|an|can hv 4 card major|nt|offthebend: NS can make 5@C by catching the @DQ but can they bid it ?|pg||
nt|offthebend: If Anal thinks his team is trailing by 20 imps , he should definitely try |pg||
nt|p dalvi: Anal thinking about prospects reaching any m game |pg||
nt|offthebend: would 3@H be a game try |pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: he is thinking hard|pg||
nt|p dalvi: yes 3H is better |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@Da) 0-5 HCP  b) 6-8 HCP, BAL  c) 6+ HCP, 0 controls|pg||
nt|p dalvi: they play strng club 17+|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1n-3nt is normal alright ; but ew in other room are playing recovery match- they shd hv bid the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|rick3son:  maybe 1@d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: isp checking the card backs|pg||
nt|super nova: on the previous hand 2h x goes for 500 on 'best' defence. So they could only pick up 3 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or on non-optimal defense   lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: Nope , No tries |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: Isporski wondering how agressive to be opposite passed partner|pg||
nt|offthebend: E did well not to push his luck with a 4-card support |pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzxz: Sunil MAchar vs Watves - 63- 12|pg||
nt|p dalvi: prob thought H Q not working card |pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: i thought maybe he would try  2N or 3@H  whichever system uses for good 3 card raise|pg||

nt|vugraphzxz: Poddar VS Guruprasad 74- 50|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rick3son:  this is why many players are disturbed by exotics|pg||
nt|super nova: I put it into deep finesse and it goes for 800 on low heart lead or AC lead or JC lead the 2h x on the earlier board|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rick3son:  not surprising Jamie, most often best to lead trumps against doubled part scores|pg||

nt|p dalvi: still 9th trick ?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|rick3son:  friendly defence is always a welcome sight|pg||
nt|jaapfr: it was N to play 2@H so @HT lead or x@C could result in -3 Jamie (HT leads was very acceptable)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: srry priv|pg||
