nt|vugrapha3: here we go...another one loool|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6NT is ponly a fair contract, but 6@D is excellent|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|allysophia: and noone would ever accuse Mike Ware of being anything resembling |pg||
nt|allysophia: "mature"|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bjacobs: you do know Ally that these comments are recorded ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lool..stop it Bill|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|allysophia: that goes without saying (Ware's youthful good looks)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I think North has 1430'd in clubs and now asked for @CQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think maybe they have set the wrong suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and perhaps Smirnov wouold have been better off bidding 3@D over 3@C ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this will be a VERY important board|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but of course I am just guessing|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: Alex alerted the 5h bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so it must mean something for him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The good thing is that diamonds is the "boss" suit, at least of the minors.  Smirnov knows about the 8-card fit there|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: But no, I was right with my analysis, and here they are in a truly dreadful contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's up to Geo to find the deadly spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's certainly plausible to lead the spade ... it's the "unbid" suit, and he has a little something in it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My post-mortem of this auction is that the 4@C bid was wrong.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 3@C was fine ... he had no spade stopper, so the mark-time bid of 3@C was indicated|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it is clear now...missunderstanding in bidding|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: Great work Geo!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and a spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was clearly the indicated lead ... but that's easy to type.  It's not easy to do in the heat of battle|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|ahollan1: their opening bids look like Precision but   1@C=2-way  BAL 11-13 OR any 17+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 1@D always unbal|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: it said he was gald fi was playing it |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: he|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: @H will be played by West in other room too -- now just a question of how high   [smart money is on 6]|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: facing a weak 2@H not quite|pg||
nt|frankaus: pd is red|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sure should have a reasonable one|pg||
nt|frankaus: does that mean anytnything these days?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=  a) 0-7  b) 22+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honest  they list that it might be 22+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = a) 11-13 BAL  b) 17+ [but not 2N opener]|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: got the spade lead |pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: yes Al, much cheering at the Wellington club where I play with Newell and Reid, I wrote it up for the newsletter and we gave them a rousing cheer last week|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opening 2@C covers the intermediate [Precision] opener, so this rebid promises 17+|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Morrison went down in 4@H for 13 to Ware|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martin Reid was on the defending Noble Team that was defeated in the "Quarter" Final by Hinge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hanlon could have bid 1@S as a 2-way bid that included 4+@S and 17+ HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Susan having her way with us  but we knew not to react to 2@H bid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: splinter by Hinge may put Morrison off|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@c not the place to be|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Geo finds the @S lead as required|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: in my booh shows max with a feature but not sure of their methods|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: yes Martin has been busy lately, he also was runner-up at our SI Teams in between|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Hinge in 4@S West|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: now @D and forced misguess to beat this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not forced misguess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if east winning @DA and giving @C ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then Milne will need to have last trump to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems auction and defense would be the same even if @DA @DQ were switched|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe with  xxxx Qx Qx Kxxxxx  Whibley would bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's the only argument i can come up with to guess correctly|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this for the match?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: later  we can discuss whether or not Hanlon should have left @C alone and just tried @HA @H finesse|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ianmcc: no @d ruff - she knows, I think|pg||

pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: different bidding of course, with S opening, 1st in hand VUL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but in context of transfers -- seems to accomplish nothing|pg||

mc|12|nt|kiwibridge: missing Aces well placed and they avoided the @S fit with the bad break|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 50.5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BBO doesn't know about fractions|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course musn't forget the carryover|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some europeans play that DBL = 4/5@S    north americans play that DBL = exactly 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but this hand has too much slam potential|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: yep i think so |pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead back up to 15.5  4 boards to score|pg||
nt|ianmcc: care needed to come to 5TX|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hi Bill|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Geo may be tearing out what little hair he has left|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ianmcc: a tough ask|pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx all a most exciting set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like that mechanism to avoid convoluted tie break algorithms|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: McGahan has found the winning defence to defeat 3N on 19|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes and I'm sure Uday could program it in if asked|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @CK now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  must attack entry to slow @S trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but how easy is that to find at the table?|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: he has completed 3 clues !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ware finishes the set on a high note|pg||
pc|c2|nt|frankaus: @C8 now a gr8 card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fun position in @C  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Hanlon reads EXACTLY can force entry to hand by winning @C royal then leading the SEVEN|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Milne will be playing with Adam Edgtton in the Junior World Cup|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Whibley is too old for the event|pg||

nt|frankaus: nice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hardly seems fair|pg||

nt|ahollan1: he got that much faster at the table  than i did looking at all 4 hands :(|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and age for Senior is going in the other direction   [now that is NOT a bad thing]|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  21  [3@HN-1]    Sveindal playing 5@DX West|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugrapha4: lost the play Grant is trying for an over |pg||

mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The way I play, 1@S is used to deny spades|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Various approaches are valid ... you just have to choose one of them|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|grebrof: I can agree with that - I guess 1@s over 1@h is 1nt with no stopper|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: North transferred twice here|pg||

nt|ianmcc: double|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: too good for 2N?   if so  then 1@C = a) 11-13, bal  b) 17+, any|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: sure am, tho dont mind if Mike wins, but i think it is about time the "kids" team won an event they have been playing so well|pg||

nt|ahollan1: looks right to me|pg||
mb|d!|mb|3D|nt|kiwibridge: 12 back to Ware on 22 as it goes -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if partner is going to pass,  please change my opener to 1@C|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: 2nt 19-20 bad 21 |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry that was meant to be private |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are very very good and deserve success|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: right sided this one |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: right sided the NT for Sveindal to gain a pick up 11|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: may take all the tricks now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is interesting that South would transfer over immediate or delayed 1N, but not over a stronger opener|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Ian and I both missed out on playing in Junior Bridge events   they did have one college tournament in my day though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Michael's in one of his favourite contracts 1NTX|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: good lead |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sounds right to me too Ian  :(|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: not to lead a D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we weren't welcomed here either except in elightened circles|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: as young players we did terrible things like:  read books, learned conventions, laughed at the table      disgusting|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Susan    i'm working off Convention Card from 2011 Camrose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no hope for that one so back to Milne go the imps again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could someone run a quick simulation to determine whether it is better in long run for South to PASS vs Transfer?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we'll wait|pg||

nt|ahollan1: I think other room uses 2@C opener for 18-19 balanced  so that is potential to reach @S partial|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they hated us passing a major opening instead of straining to bid 1NT (as we were playing Schenken)|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  22  [3@HN-1]   Tislevoll playing 4@S East|pg||
nt|ianmcc: should go off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i remember 1st psyche at my table  partner opened 1N [13-15 precision] -- i raised to 3N on 3 aces 4333|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: have any slow fines been imposed Susan?  I guess we restart immediately after this?|pg||
