nt|rv: not everyone's choice of weak 2/multi with so much outside|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|rv: right time to open though with opponents' making slam|pg||
nt|petergill: If East has 7 spades and one heart, a 4@H psyche by East over 2@D Multi, anticipating defending 4@SX, has upsides and downsides. |pg||
nt|rv: is Helgemo's 4n RKC or is it just slam try?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|petergill: 4@S save makes Geir Helgemo think the chances of a singleton or void spade in East hand are higher|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|rv: yes, South will surely bid on, possibly 5@d or just blast to 6@s since GS is very unlikely and tough to bid scientifically|pg||
nt|petergill: Direct approach gives EW less info on defence|pg||
nt|andyv:  S can afford to throw 1@d away on @c and ruff only 1@c|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rv: South didn't bid 4n since he has void and it is normally not right to employ RKC with void|pg||
nt|petergill: Some work to do in the play|pg||
nt|petergill: Win @DA, @H to ace, @H ruff, then what? @D could be 6-1 after @D2 lead. |pg||
nt|rv: play does have interesting possibilities, tough to work out percentages for all options, any civilized line should work here though|pg||
nt|petergill: or play for @D 4-3 by cashing @d's (then cross ruff becomes easy and safe) - goes down only if @D 5-2 or 1-6|pg||
nt|rv: so far declarer doesn't take ruffing finesse in @hs, he should be fine as cards are|pg||
nt|petergill: Even if there's a @d ruff, might still survive|pg||
nt|petergill: To specs' suggestion: @H to jack is ridiculously double dummy - S cannot see 52 cards - what if @HK and @SK both offside?|pg||
nt|andyv:  since E (unknown to declarer) has the only outside entry and 3 clubs, she won't be able to continue the tap|pg||
nt|cloud1147:  true|pg||
nt|andyv:  S needs to be careful here...already knows the spades will be divided 4-0 from the bidding.|pg||

nt|rv: even playing that treatment, I would prefer a bit more to double 2@s|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rv: at these colors 3@h could be played as mixed and not strictly pre-emptive|pg||
nt|petergill: The problem on Bd 26 in this table was in part that East's Dbl of 5@c could be a hand with extras (hence 6CD), whereas at the other table Pass of 4@C clearly showed a poor opening|pg||
nt|rv: Peter, I believe Helness erred in doubling 5@c though I am not aware of their methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzc: It is a very light reopen I think|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|vugraphzzc: 0/2 4th lead for N-S|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: If my partner's doubles 5@c on that auction, I will bid slam with Helgemo's hand as well|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Zack should win @CQA not @CK, but either card is OK (certainly not @CQ)|pg||
nt|petergill: win @CA I mean|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rv: he needs to win this and cash @cs to escape for 1 down|pg||
nt|petergill: still on Bd 26: but if Helgemo is planning to pass out 5@c with an ordinary hand, isn't it reasonable for Helness to increase the (100 or 200) to (200 or 500)?|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 26: another way of looking at it is that East dbls 5@C only if East thinks his side is being robbed by 5@C of a possible game - that's argues for Venky not for me |pg||
