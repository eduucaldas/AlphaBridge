nt|ahollan1: voice commentary for both tables in the final quarter|pg||

nt|ahollan1: my guess is a [reluctant] 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but move @CQ to @DQ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table  4@D East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last time i checked there were 13 tricks :)|pg||
nt|rick3son:  5 or 6 rounds of bidding later the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm uncertain about 4N   i think it is part of denial cue bidding, but always get confused there without being able to peek at my toes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last chance for plus|pg||
nt|xenya: most will bid slam with these cards|pg||
nt|rick3son:  spade lead yields 10th trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news   4@D went down|pg||
nt|xenya: i retract :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok here's a guess   4N = top card in @D [longest suit]  NO top card in @S [2nd longest]|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: much better to go down in 6@D than down in 4@D  :)|pg||
nt|rick3son:  the 4@d bid that Peter was referring to I believe was the final contract in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzwr: 4NT - one of three top honor in diamonds.|pg||

nt|psridhar: FIRST requirement for ANY recovery match is "do Not lose more imps"-making your task harder|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: record will show    board 29   push|pg||
nt|p dalvi: here we are watching another QF |pg||
nt|psridhar: i  have seen many players believe that to recover you have to take chances and hence risking losing more is unavaoidable|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|p dalvi: enterprise got 1 st swing on board 13.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: not logical|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(14)15-17|pg||
nt|p dalvi: Hanif ever smiling guy from Mumbai playing with poona guy.|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|psridhar: you have to take marginal decisions alright not wild ones|pg||
nt|psridhar: you do neeed luck but cannot let go accuracy in a wild manner|pg||
nt|psridhar: making close penalty doubles is a good idea but one must wait for his chances|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: we won't see same auction from other room   Hans-Nunn play weak NT in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: bidding thin slams is another avenue for recovery-if your luck is in slam may roll if it is marginal |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wow  Nunn did not upgrade  his 1N 12-14|pg||
nt|psridhar: not wild slams that need too much|pg||
nt|buddyshah: always  a learning  experience  ,  reading  your comments  PS. :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|p dalvi: this tournamnet is taking place at Mulung Gymkhana in Mumbai.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: but still reached 3N|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|p dalvi: sry Mulund |pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: playing king and a spade is not so clear since it indicates a sure entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that has to be diamond king|pg||
nt|xenya: W under pressure on the run of @Cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  odd/even carding    @C6 discourages @C and shows Reverse Suit preference -- if you can read it as high or low even|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|p dalvi: could have uses that entry to play D |pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: i always found this type of hand brutal|pg||
nt|xenya: he needs to read the position now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even on run of @C  [foregoing @H toward Q]   must read the end position|pg||
nt|rick3son:  the early @h discard was excellent play|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H to Ace and if @HK doesn't fall, try to pin @DJ in west???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but perhaps diamond jack discard would have been better than low|pg||
nt|rick3son:  playing toward Q@d is a give up position|pg||
nt|rick3son:  only right in thinks KJ on his right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid did well to follow basic tenet   bare king early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe Kovachev will read THAT|pg||
nt|xenya: if W discards @DJ, S may be tempted to cross to dummy with @HA to finesse @DK -- obviously making|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jack instead of 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double-reverse psychology|pg||
nt|rick3son:  much to think about|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd like to call a friend       can someone dial  Michael Rosenberg or Bart Bramley?|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|fabsayc: 1/2 imp carryover|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ostensibly  positive response needs 10+ hcp and 3+ controls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for finishing higher in qualifying stage|pg||
nt|rick3son:  BBO presents some quality vugraphs and this one surely does not disappoint|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with this distribution, Newell may upgrade|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, 10+ HCP, 3+ CNTRL [A=2, K=1], a) 6+@C  b) 3-suit  short @H/@S [4441/5440]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if south bids, i'm lost |pg||
nt|psridhar: another point in recovery matches is ' try to put opponents in unfamiliar situations" -these may be otherwsie not attempted by you for  the risk it entails|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Reid make forcing noises|pg||

nt|xenya: they have wrongsided a club contract -- what about no-trumps?|pg||

pc|dK|nt|xenya: that also...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@S=7@C 1@S (32), can't resolve|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now we know the problem with relays|pg||
nt|psridhar: for eg players are prepared to handle intervention over their 1N-but when you chip in over their 2N opg they may be unprepared ( these are less discussed situations usually as no ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: one bids over the 2N )|pg||
nt|psridhar: another unfamiliar territory is when u bid in the second round of their 1N opg -eg (1N)-P-(2@h)-P-(2@s)- 3@h |pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: all contracts now wrong sided|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you mean that @C contracts wrong-sided??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and/or  NT wrong-sided|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: i was taught   lead the 3-card suit   of course we don't know if that is @H or @D|pg||

nt|p dalvi: the losing QF will join the pairs elimination second set |pg||

nt|fabsayc: pass shows willingness to play 2@c doubled|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, 6+@C|pg||
nt|xenya: S had better bid now|pg||
nt|desinka: or good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|rick3son:  we had a 2@d double in the last board of previous set that meaning wasnt clear to both partners that was quite significant|pg||
nt|p dalvi: 3nt likely contract |pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: kastaubh's final leap to 5@d is inexplicable|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|desinka: so.. S.O.S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the question that partnerships must answer    over DBL what is difference between RDBL and 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: so it's 2@H?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this RDBL = SOS|pg||

nt|ahollan1: normal agreement after  2@C-DBL    PASS=@C  2@D=@D   RDBL =  pick a major|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can he escape down one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and a number of specs getting that one right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to me this is 100% penalty but we have visited this ambiguity before|pg||
nt|rick3son:  seems like players are making match point bids frequently|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: now the gap widens|pg||
nt|psridhar: making the recovery task tougher|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psridhar: this is a top trick slam -not chancy as i misread at first glance, costly miss by EW in other room|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|p dalvi: 1nt is 8 to 13 but gen one should play in 3NT from strong hand so can negate with 1D and then bid game |pg||

pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: good point Leon|pg||
nt|rick3son:  often player are unable to double for penalty many partnerships have X always take out|pg||
