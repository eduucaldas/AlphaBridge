nt|Walddk4: He is a junior|pg||
nt|henryb:  If he has a junior he doesn't want to use up his lifetime supply of green cards prematurely :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The defence against 4@S was a bit erratic after East got off to a good start with @HA|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 2C did not promise a major with an invitational hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: I even think 4@S could be made after the switch to @CA and another|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Now you see why Ophir is a strong candidate for my Top 10|pg||
nt|henryb:  Not quite, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: of slow players|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Segment 3 was scheduled to start 10 minutes ago|pg||
nt|henryb:  I mean making 4@s from N after @hA, @cA, @c: three diamonds, heart ruff, club ruff, heart ruff|pg||
nt|henryb:  now South has Q985 of spades and is on lead; North has @sA and three red cards|pg||
nt|henryb:  East has four spades left|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|poohbear: if Birman had 4S and an invite I suspect he would bid 2@s rather than 2nt|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|mc|8|nt|poohbear: the animal defense was to duck the Q of @ds . that would kill the suit when declarer repeated the finesse|pg||

mb|4S|nt|henryb:  1@d transfer; supposedly, I would think, 3@c xhould deny 3 card heart support |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: they should . Fisher took a hugely conservative view in the other room|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  I mean 2@c should deny 3+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think they will have time to light the shabat candles|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think normal is to play 1@h = 3, 2@h = 4 card support|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|henryb:  other bids show 2 or fewer @h|pg||

nt|poohbear: Thanks to Lee Rosenthal , our very capable VG operator. I am sure we will be seeing him for the next 3 segments|pg||
nt|poohbear: This type of hand I call suit establishment vs crossruff. I try to establish my long suit and if the opps try to kill my entries I switch to Crossruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: would take very very specific holding s to beat me on that line|pg||
