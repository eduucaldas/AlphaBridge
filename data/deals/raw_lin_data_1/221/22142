nt|mrdct: easy game isn't it - just bang down the @CA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, it is, but I think it's a bit more normal to start taking minor suit finesses, hoping that one of them works|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Fiona thinking ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: the @d finese is a bit of a trap as it's not going to present enough tricks to make your contract|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is the way to "cross to dummy" for the club finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And if the club finesse loses, then you need the diamond finesse, so I don't think it's really a trap at all|pg||
nt|mrdct: so you might be best to go after @c immediately to guarantee 8 tricks and then hope the 9th can be from establishing a @d or @hA onside or opps opening up the @h suit|pg||
