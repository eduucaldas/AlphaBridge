pc|c3|pc|h8|nt|trotto: East, Sylwester Mlynarczuk, a very experienced matchpoints player, in  the past we won everything what was to win with Artur Rutkowski. Maybe that's why they splitted up.|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ady: e/w may get to 3NT    which should fail on a spade lead|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|trotto: a very dynamic hand here, but I expect it will end up in a typical 4@s here. |pg||
nt|roswolf: south is tempted to make a game try but discretion is the better part of valour here|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm even i can get this off!|pg||

nt|dburn: Patrick Jourdain won't be missing this one|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lechcold: po celnym wicie Mirka|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|trotto: i have to admit this 1@s is very strange. Many players would bid 2@s here which is more encouraging as this enigmatic 1@s. |pg||
nt|ady: wonder if this could make if declarer crosses to A@H playes diamond finesse  which north might not cover  and then run the rest of the hearts     north might be in trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|dburn: good thinking :)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|roswolf: more imps dribble away to the Irish|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: if north covers the diamond   again in trouble with the hearts   has all the vital cards   if north lets go a spade  declarer can then give up a diamond  and the defence only has 3 ...|pg||
nt|ady: spades and a diamond|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|trotto: need a @c now to open|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: essentially, with eight tricks on top (including the diamond finesse) declarer just runs his suit, and North cannot hold the position|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm seems declarer on the right track|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Geoffrey|pg||
nt|dburn: South might have dropped the ten of diamonds, to give declarer the option of playing him for @d109 doubleton|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|c6|nt|roswolf: england need to pull their socks up early|pg||
nt|dburn: now, declarer can play North for @dKx, but in that case he might just as well cash the hearts anyway|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|c7|nt|ady: 11 tgricks in OR|pg||
nt|dburn: North didn't bid in the strong club auction at the other table, so South didn't lead a spade and East didn't have a problem|pg||
nt|dburn: North can throw his spade now, effectively giving up on beating the contract, but he will probably throw another club in the hope that South can stop the suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: if declarer had any doubts about the layout north's trance now will have given it away|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|trotto: Pawlowska shoud have concerns with this misfit hands after 1@s, anyway 4@s is easy to let out. |pg||
nt|ady: east could still make though without J@C   cash the ace  and exit with a spade|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|trotto: if Mlynarczuk wouldn't switch towards @cs, his partner would be endplayed and forced to play from under then K@c|pg||
nt|trotto: so well done for Mlynarczuk aka "Old Miller"|pg||
nt|trotto: :)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|s6|nt|dburn: indeed, but this way he gets to make a tenth trick|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: settled for just 2 spades|pg||

mb|3D|mb|d|nt|trotto: Because while playing 3NT is always better to finesse the J@c, because it seems like East has no entry to his @s|pg||

nt|ady: last hand of thesession     thx all  thx specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|trotto: it worked well, but only because N felt himself like in squeeze. Some call it a "memory squeeze" some banana-strawberry squeeze.|pg||
