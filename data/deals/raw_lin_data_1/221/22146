pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: in theory it should make|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ruffing his club losers will work,|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But going after spades might not|pg||
nt|mrdct: trump lead would've caused more problems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he may take club finesse though after that lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: i suspect J is systemic from that holding for NS|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: West in deep thought|pg||
nt|marlowepi: likely, but if you play such a wide ranging club that 1C is the system bid on the S hand, it can pay off sometimes when leading clubs to make deceptive honor leads|pg||

nt|bjacobs: I worry about North's @H7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 8 in W hand should be enough to fend off dangers of 7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|h8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since N did not raise clubs, i would think the straightforward approach of going for club ruffs and playing for 32 trumps would look more attractive than this spade-focused ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strategem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: first club ruff will surely stand up, and you can afford to lose 2 trumps and a D|pg||

nt|marlowepi: W was hoping for 33 spades in which case he could throw a D on a fourth spade and then afford to lose 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The winning way from here is to ruff a club, and discard your diamond loser on the next spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N had 4 spades then S would have 4 clubs so no danger of a fatal club discard on third spade|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S has 4 spades then maybe he will have JT of hearts as happened here|pg||

mb|2N|nt|vugrapha3: i am talking about 12 yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South has visions of slam|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But how to bid it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: passing in a flash might have less to do with expecting garbage than with hoping for action by opponents|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mrdct: transfer to @h and then self-splionter|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: South starts with a transfer.  A good idea is to play your "2NT opening" system even when you have overcalled 2NT|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mrdct: absolutely bill|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe 3@s now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually 6@C is a contract that might not need you to find @DQ, but the 4-1 break is disastrous|pg||
nt|mrdct: on the assumption that east is now known to be a weak 2 in @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can handle the bad club break if played from S side i think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, but you will have to find the @DQ still|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But you are right:  the @SA lead prevents a second tap|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s would promise a void here and i guess you would respond with keycards excl the @SA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the concept:  Exclusion Key-Card 4@S bid|pg||
nt|mrdct: the problem here for south is that his @h suit isn't really self-sustaining|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: He's gone for it|pg||
nt|mrdct: and there is likely wastage in @s given that north has promised a @s stop|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's true that there's wastage in spades, but 2NT presumably also showed something reasonable in HEARTS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, there are tools available... you rightly recommended playing your 2N opener system after a 2N overcall as well, so you can use the rebids of 3H and 3N by opener to show 2 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: different types of heart holding. here of course that would not help as you would learn N has a doubleton|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: North in the tank now|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|bjacobs: OK, 2-without|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of course, the viability of my suggestion depends on what N can have for 2N in this position|pg||
nt|mrdct: when there's been a preempt - i wonder if you should super accept on 3-card support rather than the normal 3|pg||
nt|mrdct: normal 4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So South bids the slam, and West's lead?   Perhaps a trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Sorry, East on lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 5@d looks like 2 without the Q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wd|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East will lead his club, I suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, maybe not ... partner cannot have @CA|pg||
nt|mrdct: some queries on exclusion|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, that's a rather awkward problem on lead for Neil|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: He "solved" it in that he didn't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's blackwood in the agreed suit but ignoring the ace of the suit you have bid it in becuase you have a void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N will soon know E has 4 diamonds|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mrdct: an occassional effective psych is to bid exclusion in a suit you hold a small douobleton in and then the opps don't lead it because they think you are void|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Preserving his options to go wrong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has the count so he could always play either opp for D queen aftr a D discard|pg||
