nt|vugrapha3: Whibley chose Wales lool|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Interesting board to start with ... it fits well for N/S and looks like 4@S is on, but there is a defence to beat it|pg||

nt|bjacobs: They say that 3NT is often better than a 5-3 major fit ... but that doesn't apply with the unbalanced South hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead against 3N much easier in other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Don't need a heart lead -  a switch is good enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although a diamond lead is disastrous|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugrapha3: same spot in the closed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's 1st hurdle   now defense must make sure they don't block the suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: or maybe specifically 2@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, Hanlon has admitted to @SA, and that should do the trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy Hung's decision to raise 3@C to 4@C worked very well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6NT is easily the best contract|pg||

pc|c5|nt|frankaus: Yule won semi this morning by a couple of imps - originally seeded 16 so seeding committee  was of couse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW use Rusinow leads against both suit and NT   i.e.  2nd of touching honors|pg||

nt|ahollan1: transfer responses|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You have your answer. but it seems pointless to me to describe these openings as "18-19" or "11-13" (as on the previous hand), where they so often have less|pg||
mb|2H!|an|spades|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: in all fairness   NS  convention card from 2011 U-26 APBF  says  (17)18-19|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||

mb|r|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|grebrof: I rather pass with 3 @cs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: probably Hanlon's PASS just denies @C stop|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bjacobs: and redouble?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: One good approach here is:  Pass denies stopper, everything else is normal, but WITH a club stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then extrapolating   RDBL -- re-ask Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, then Redouble says: "let's just keep going"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Redouble by East would be to play, sitting OVER the doubler|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good point Bill|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i always forget to mention that part :(|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This general approach also works fine when 2@C is doubled after a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: further sequences   with a club stop West can fall into SHOWING  4-card majors to become declarer |pg||

nt|grebrof: if N dont cash?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm with Bill   @H now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer can hook it, but will then take the fatal second spade finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If North plays a spade, declarer will survive, as South on winning @SK will be endplayed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: digression:  it seems as though a very large % of swings in this match have been double-digit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: So an exciting board, but it's gonna be flat, whatever East does on this trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other endplay possibilities|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hanlon looking opps system card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fly @SA play red suit winners and Milne endplayed with @S  [assuming he really had the king]|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps Hanlon's play was ok (even if losing) ... if clubs had been 5-1 (surely possible) that first round spade finesse would be followed by a claim|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I will retract my "strange line" comment|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: thanks Susan    i'm working off Convention Card from 2011 Camrose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no hope for that one so back to Milne go the imps again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could someone run a quick simulation to determine whether it is better in long run for South to PASS vs Transfer?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we'll wait|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but maybe not for long|pg||

pc|hT|pc|s6|pc|d2|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: I think other room uses 2@C opener for 18-19 balanced  so that is potential to reach @S partial|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ok class    let's everyone say in unison       thank you bill|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: last board..we will restart in 10|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: strong version of 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=8-11|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bjacobs: Not a great slam, but hearts 2-2 and spades coming in lets it make|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looks like natural bidding now  with 2@H guaranteeing the 17+ hand type [so game force]|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: in other room  3@D was a 3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I can understand reaching the slam ... essentially, you have 1st and 2nd round control in every side suit, and solid trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: pretty hard to diagnose those missing 3rd round controls in the blacks|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|grebrof: yes, its understandable - I have seen a lot worse slams than this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on flip side -- seems many hands where grand slam has play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and auction would be same|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe there was a limiting bid in there somewhere ... |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was imagining  east with   nothing in @D and  @CKQxx|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: last board before a break for lunch |pg||
nt|ahollan1: another great set from Susan -- thanks|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|kiwibridge: so many thanks to Al and Susan for an impeccable job on the Vugraph, back after the break for the 2nd half|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so, last board this set, 12 more to go, it's still possible... many thanks to Susan for her immaculate work on Vugraph and great comments|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Back in less than 20 min for last set of 12|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx audience as ever you make my day, even for great events like this there seems to be a real dearth of Australian commentators :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: PASS forces RDBL?  to show 2 non-touching suits  [my guess]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Andy's im more thana @S partial Al, he's in game on 23|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so another  good news, bad news story|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Though might be running a little behind as the other table still has a couple to play |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slow play fines were threatened earlier|pg||
nt|ianmcc: This is a dreadful, making slam|pg||
mb|3S|an|ask for shortage |nt|kiwibridge: have any slow fines been imposed Susan?  I guess we restart immediately after this?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: no fines as yet but director is sitting at the table |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx all spectators for your valued feedback|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: liam said Pass is to play |pg||
nt|ahollan1: totally new concept|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Liam said PASS = to play |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats one to sort out over lunch :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Restart at 130|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Ian, are they likely to bid it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|an|none |mb|p|mb|6H|nt|kiwibridge: thats 1hour 8 mins from now folks :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4.30 NZ time|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if you use the free tool   qlock   you don't have to calculate the timezone differences - it does it for you|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no shortage to show with the classic 4333|pg||
nt|ianmcc: other table?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: after the players have scored up I guess|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2 boards behind other table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow Nabil goes for ity|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kiwibridge: with spades 3-3 he gets a @C pitch, |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: and hearts 22 so he can ruff |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes all in all a great percentage slam|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 14%|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amazing that both pairs opened 1N  but I'll bet Ware is at the very bottom of his "promised" range|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
