nt|Walddk2:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Norway/Helgemo_Helness.pdf|pg||
nt|rv: not everyone's choice of weak 2/multi with so much outside|pg||
nt|cloud1147:  Huang played for @S JT in West on last hand|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rv: right time to open though with opponents' making slam|pg||
nt|petergill: If East has 7 spades and one heart, a 4@H psyche by East over 2@D Multi, anticipating defending 4@SX, has upsides and downsides. |pg||
nt|rv: is Helgemo's 4n RKC or is it just slam try?|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|petergill: 4@S save makes Geir Helgemo think the chances of a singleton or void spade in East hand are higher|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|petergill: I think 4NT followed by 5@H was a slam try in @H, whereas a direct 5@H over 4@S is merely competitive|pg||

nt|petergill: low club by N is probably best now|pg||

nt|petergill: Win @DA, @H to ace, @H ruff, then what? @D could be 6-1 after @D2 lead. |pg||
nt|rv: play does have interesting possibilities, tough to work out percentages for all options, any civilized line should work here though|pg||
nt|petergill: or play for @D 4-3 by cashing @d's (then cross ruff becomes easy and safe) - goes down only if @D 5-2 or 1-6|pg||
nt|rv: so far declarer doesn't take ruffing finesse in @hs, he should be fine as cards are|pg||

nt|petergill: -1, 50|pg||

nt|vugraphzzc: E and W explained differently|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzzc: Jonky wrote down "S+C" while Herstein wrote "S+D"|pg||
nt|cloud1147:  I believe 2D is limited up to 16 hcp|pg||

nt|cloud1147:  and good pass by Lu|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cloud1147:  both table make an excellent lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: it is not the job of the BBO operator or us to question the outcome = regarding that last hand|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|petergill: with its curious ending - the play sometimes is not exactly as we think it is|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cloud1147:  2@H bid has "borrowed" some  points from partner already|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|petergill: The smooth duck of @DK was nice defence|pg||
nt|rv: Zack seems a trick short here|pg||
nt|rv: small @h now is best line as cards are|pg||
nt|petergill: @H5 exit to king maybe - what does East then do?|pg||
nt|rv: East's best defense is to win @HK and back a @d smoothly|pg||
nt|petergill: then @S7 to king but N does not seem to have the entries to apply pressure to East's discards|pg||
nt|rv: after Helgemo's earlier duck of @DK, Zack would not finesse |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|petergill: I see - perhaps N can take black winners then throw East in|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cloud1147:  nice switch by Jeff|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|petergill: playing for friendlier club layout - @CQ play was unlucky misguess|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|rv: there seems to change of play in @cs, he is making now |pg||
nt|rv: Helgemo apparently shifted to @CT and not low @c after winning @DK|pg||
nt|petergill: I see, West played earlier for North to hold less than 4 clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: declarer might still have to guess spades or the ending|pg||
nt|petergill: @CT play explains @CQ play|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect Zack should get this ending right, he should figure out Helgemo has most of entries for not continuing pd's suit|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|rv: Zack is thinking can be afford low @h now or just play @S to @SA, cash @DA check if @ds break, else play @s from dummy and guess|pg||

mb|1D|nt|cloud1147:  rehi|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|cloud1147:  E/W will land in 4@h ?|pg||
nt|cloud1147:  not unreasonable contract|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rv: at these colors 3@h could be played as mixed and not strictly pre-emptive|pg||
nt|petergill: The problem on Bd 26 in this table was in part that East's Dbl of 5@c could be a hand with extras (hence 6CD), whereas at the other table Pass of 4@C clearly showed a poor opening|pg||
nt|rv: Peter, I believe Helness erred in doubling 5@c though I am not aware of their methods|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzzc: It is a very light reopen I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|cloud1147:  3@d strong than 3@h |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzc: 0/2 4th lead for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|cloud1147:  BTW , N/S plays precision here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rv: If my partner's doubles 5@c on that auction, I will bid slam with Helgemo's hand as well|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Zack should win @CQA not @CK, but either card is OK (certainly not @CQ)|pg||
nt|petergill: win @CA I mean|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: he needs to win this and cash @cs to escape for 1 down|pg||
nt|petergill: still on Bd 26: but if Helgemo is planning to pass out 5@c with an ordinary hand, isn't it reasonable for Helness to increase the (100 or 200) to (200 or 500)?|pg||
nt|petergill: but Venky I do see your point, you are probably right|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||

nt|cloud1147:  with @CA offside|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 26: another way of looking at it is that East dbls 5@C only if East thinks his side is being robbed by 5@C of a possible game - that's argues for Venky not for me |pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: now ruff @c, pitch @s on @D|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|petergill: Trick 1 - the aim was to disguise the club position. Trick 2 - N played for bare ace with West who has most of the points - a bit unlucky perhaps|pg||
