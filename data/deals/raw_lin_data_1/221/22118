nt|fabsayc: and NT|pg||
nt|xenya: it's astounding how they can manage this system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will slow down Reid|pg||
nt|rick3son:  Roland are a Man U fan?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary for both tables in the final quarter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has absolute max of 13 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is a [reluctant] 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but move @CQ to @DQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe 3N isn't right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans opened the North hand with 2@S|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi buddy|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table  4@D East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last time i checked there were 13 tricks :)|pg||
nt|rick3son:  5 or 6 rounds of bidding later the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm uncertain about 4N   i think it is part of denial cue bidding, but always get confused there without being able to peek at my toes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last chance for plus|pg||
nt|xenya: most will bid slam with these cards|pg||
nt|rick3son:  spade lead yields 10th trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news   4@D went down|pg||
nt|xenya: i retract :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok here's a guess   4N = top card in @D [longest suit]  NO top card in @S [2nd longest]|pg||

nt|psridhar: FIRST requirement for ANY recovery match is "do Not lose more imps"-making your task harder|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: giving only 1 @h trick to opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: record will show    board 29   push|pg||
nt|p dalvi: here we are watching another QF |pg||
nt|psridhar: i  have seen many players believe that to recover you have to take chances and hence risking losing more is unavaoidable|pg||
mb|p|nt|p dalvi: enterprise got 1 st swing on board 13.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: EW are playing precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: not logical|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|an|!C & !H|mb|r|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(14)15-17|pg||
nt|p dalvi: Hanif ever smiling guy from Mumbai playing with poona guy.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|psridhar: you have to take marginal decisions alright not wild ones|pg||
nt|psridhar: you do neeed luck but cannot let go accuracy in a wild manner|pg||
nt|psridhar: making close penalty doubles is a good idea but one must wait for his chances|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: we won't see same auction from other room   Hans-Nunn play weak NT in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: bidding thin slams is another avenue for recovery-if your luck is in slam may roll if it is marginal |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wow  Nunn did not upgrade  his 1N 12-14|pg||
nt|psridhar: not wild slams that need too much|pg||
nt|buddyshah: always  a learning  experience  ,  reading  your comments  PS. :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|p dalvi: this tournamnet is taking place at Mulung Gymkhana in Mumbai.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but still reached 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|p dalvi: sry Mulund |pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: playing king and a spade is not so clear since it indicates a sure entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that has to be diamond king|pg||
nt|xenya: W under pressure on the run of @Cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  odd/even carding    @C6 discourages @C and shows Reverse Suit preference -- if you can read it as high or low even|pg||

mb|p|nt|p dalvi: 4s by N or 3nt by E|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: 1/2 imp carryover|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ostensibly  positive response needs 10+ hcp and 3+ controls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for finishing higher in qualifying stage|pg||
nt|rick3son:  BBO presents some quality vugraphs and this one surely does not disappoint|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with this distribution, Newell may upgrade|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if south bids, i'm lost |pg||
nt|psridhar: another point in recovery matches is ' try to put opponents in unfamiliar situations" -these may be otherwsie not attempted by you for  the risk it entails|pg||

nt|p dalvi: little scared of Vul. so just 2S |pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=6+@C, short hi  0-2@S|pg||
nt|xenya: they have wrongsided a club contract -- what about no-trumps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1 step up is a meaningless relay that says  tell me more|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: that also...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@S=7@C 1@S (32), can't resolve|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now we know the problem with relays|pg||
nt|psridhar: for eg players are prepared to handle intervention over their 1N-but when you chip in over their 2N opg they may be unprepared ( these are less discussed situations usually as no ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: one bids over the 2N )|pg||
nt|psridhar: another unfamiliar territory is when u bid in the second round of their 1N opg -eg (1N)-P-(2@h)-P-(2@s)- 3@h |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: all contracts now wrong sided|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you mean that @C contracts wrong-sided??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and/or  NT wrong-sided|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxz: 3@c here shows @c & 5 carded Major|pg||

nt|fabsayc: yes 3nt had a chance |pg||
nt|p dalvi: 9 tricks and run |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was taught   lead the 3-card suit   of course we don't know if that is @H or @D|pg||
nt|rick3son:  the point Peter made about the necessity of rising with King of @c against a potential 3nt contract was excellent|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|super nova: 6 6 6 the number of the beast.|pg||
