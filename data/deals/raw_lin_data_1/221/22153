mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain:  the other major from West is used as a force with game interest|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pdjourdain:  25 points between them will see most tables in game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if they had known what lead they were getting, I am sure they would :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  plenty of scope for losing 2 trump tricks on other layouts|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  But 9 tricks is likely in spades with a trump and 2 hearts and a club to lose unless South can be squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would probably need to transfer the guard to the South hand for that to work|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  somewhat double dummy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps North's failure to X 3@h asked South to lead another suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the NS system card is http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/BurnsMurchan.pdf|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  That lead seems to give declarer a problem|pg||
