nt|Walddk2:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Norway/Helgemo_Helness.pdf|pg||
nt|rv: not everyone's choice of weak 2/multi with so much outside|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rv: right time to open though with opponents' making slam|pg||
nt|petergill: If East has 7 spades and one heart, a 4@H psyche by East over 2@D Multi, anticipating defending 4@SX, has upsides and downsides. |pg||
nt|rv: is Helgemo's 4n RKC or is it just slam try?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@S save makes Geir Helgemo think the chances of a singleton or void spade in East hand are higher|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|petergill: I think 4NT followed by 5@H was a slam try in @H, whereas a direct 5@H over 4@S is merely competitive|pg||

nt|vugraphzzc: Remind you that we have lost connection earlier , so no score link , sorry about that|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rv: on 1@c-1@s, some play 3@d as variety of strong @s raise, 3@h likely to be splinter possibly lower range |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@H cue|pg||
nt|petergill: I expect South to bid onwards - not sure how|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rv: yes, South will surely bid on, possibly 5@d or just blast to 6@s since GS is very unlikely and tough to bid scientifically|pg||
nt|petergill: Direct approach gives EW less info on defence|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rv: South didn't bid 4n since he has void and it is normally not right to employ RKC with void|pg||
nt|petergill: Some work to do in the play|pg||
nt|petergill: Win @DA, @H to ace, @H ruff, then what? @D could be 6-1 after @D2 lead. |pg||
nt|rv: play does have interesting possibilities, tough to work out percentages for all options, any civilized line should work here though|pg||
nt|petergill: or play for @D 4-3 by cashing @d's (then cross ruff becomes easy and safe) - goes down only if @D 5-2 or 1-6|pg||
nt|rv: so far declarer doesn't take ruffing finesse in @hs, he should be fine as cards are|pg||
nt|petergill: Even if there's a @d ruff, might still survive|pg||
nt|petergill: To specs' suggestion: @H to jack is ridiculously double dummy - S cannot see 52 cards - what if @HK and @SK both offside?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|rv: an interesting line, cash 3@ds, @HA and cross-ruff the hand|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|rv: now @s back best, declarer may need to commit in @hs|pg||
nt|petergill: EW lead 3rd and 5th|pg||
nt|petergill: I think @s play was to find out if @SK was onside = smooth duck of @SK by Tor Helness would not gain - I think|pg||
nt|rv: I don't think Zack took best line, I much prefer winning @DA and playing @HA and ruff a @h, keeps communications fluid|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Zack and Herbst are not a regular partnership (to the best of my knowledge) - Zack played with Michael Barel and Herbst with his brother when Israel came 2nd in the latest European ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Championships and 5th in the 2011 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
mb|2H|an|can be 3 cards|mb|p|nt|rv: Herbst's @h pips are poor though 5 card suit|pg||

pc|c3|nt|rv: not best start to defense though, after @CA and pd's discourage, @dA and back was best|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: 15 minutes remaining on the clock|pg||

nt|ahollan1: time for another big club auction!|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Gary & the kibs for joining us here & for their inputs.|pg||
nt|andyv:  final board|pg||

nt|viren169: last board here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S never has shorter 2nd suit  could be 4@S with 5+other|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty Martin and Gary|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: Next match will start at 5.30 Moscow time.|pg||
nt|psyck: 2nd half of this match in about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|riccho:  the 5@h bid from other table looks crazy in my mind|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava12/slava12r.htm  for results|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might well be some fight between the majors of e/w|pg||
nt|penseur9:  9 IMPs on 10 for O1 for a 2IMP now... it's anybodies game now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: finally an example of canape hand  i.e.  2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 3@H/@S  they use 1@S-2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this a 1@H opening or upgrade to 2@D = bal 18-19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i really did type that before the bid was made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thanks Göran :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which may effectively end this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but mostly rubber bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = @H & @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  vulnerable, but 1-level, 5-5, strong club - lots going for the X|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   will cetainly be ing game     3NT?|pg||
nt|djneill:  yep|pg||
nt|mcphee: pretty sure they will rule out @S game david|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to everybody involved, including our spectators for some "interesting" observations|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a great fan of weak 2s headed by the 9!|pg||
nt|psyck: S will have big ambitions now|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  O1 = Onstein1 :0|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks G|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to our operator, the organizers, bbo and lots of suggestions from spectators|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Ekaterina for a wonderful job as our operator|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@C alert maybe 2 card suit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|twcho: many kibitzers pointed out that 4@h should be cold even NS find their ruffs|pg||
nt|twcho: sorry for my wrong analysis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw that at the beginning of the set -- or maybe that was last set|pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't see huub do anything wrong (no 2@D bid in the start may be)|pg||
nt|ady: nice 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 1@H ignores DBL  so   FG  a) BAL [no singleton/void], 8+ HCP  b) 3 places-to-play, 12-14 HCP|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: sorry, I was delivering some drinks for the guys, N and E did not think|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@s will find a bad surprise here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@H|pg||
nt|psyck: we can be sure that the contract will not be the same here this room now|pg||
nt|riccho:  W blocked N from any @h-ambitions easily ... .)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: good fitting black suits     should make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D  10-15 HCP, 5+@H 4+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and again  DBL=5-7 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a good save for e/w|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not counting @SJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: we forgive you this one time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real life kibitzers in the room??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: nope, not allowed|pg||
nt|mcphee: anyone a 3@H bidder as E?|pg||
nt|ady: reasonable|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose dble need not be 5/5  major tho|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was that a transfer to NY :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NT:)|pg||
nt|psyck: other room sacrificed in 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S ostensibly very strong for this sequence but presumably wishing to prevent EW finding viable save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be more worried about missinbg a slam than about that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm uncertain of auctions after the interference :(|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Andy and martin, great operator and amazing specs @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty specs for joining us and making this so much fun.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|twcho: need to drop the offside K, highly unlikely|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 22 2 down in 3NT, big win for Onstein|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not this opening is very preemptive on partner, this is excellent 4@H game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees could raise with something exceptional|pg||
nt|ady: will have to play on spades|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose could run 10@S   first round|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes NY here we come :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last hand, thanks everybody|pg||
nt|viren169: Ouch...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@D= ANY INVIE!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   2@D=ART INV  a) 3/4@S  b) NT  c) 3@H/@S & 6@C/@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H jump probably does NOT set up forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was that crazy hand "wrong sided" at both table |pg||
nt|ahollan1: voices from above make great point   why ONLY 2@H from east|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: ty al|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to find the 9th trick here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but hts are 3/3  so should not be difficult |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to try a @H early,  that gets the club ace out of N hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I mean a @C early |pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  will declarer guess the trump the right way?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: total performance of all 4 here very high imo|pg||
nt|dkkello:  agree |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this 3@D raise covers a lot of hand types, it seems|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bergen style|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: last set almost half of the boards were double digit swings   here, the biggest exchange is 3 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S good bid -- took away Verhees Michaels call -- so vP limited info|pg||
nt|ady: dbl showes majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at 04:36  i should copy/paste rather than try to remember :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my     Ton bid over 6@C  so he really did think 4N was keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final is 7@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west's dbl  yes  @H & @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a decent slam if no club lead|pg||
nt|psyck: that sums it up i guess|pg||
mb|4S|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 5@H isn't exceptional|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  not guaranteed    need correct diamond guess|pg||
nt|ady: certainly must defend 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: strange lead |pg||
nt|psyck: yes @c looked normal|pg||
nt|baldjean: out of the frying pan into the fire|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a normal @C lead|pg||
nt|psyck: 1 or 2 down now i guess|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks all|pg||
nt|viren169: East needs to switch to K of clubs to stop Declarer making 9/10 tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: West|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  looks like +2 here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think will go down 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  perfectly avoidable if W is going to bid 3@s on that hand - I agree that 2@s was really enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on  25  vLankveld overcalled 4@H immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  9  [vP's 3@S opener]    Bos opened 1@S and Lankveld declaring 3N West|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we seam frozen here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: no North thinking|pg||
nt|ady: unusual to be doubled in a solid 10 card fit   but should get 300|pg||
nt|mcphee: not always 5/5 though correct Al?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sometimes even the world's best look just like us humans :) see you sson for the next set @H|pg||
nt|xenya: this might not be easy|pg||
nt|xenya: for the defence as well of course :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: run 10@S   soade to ace and diamond|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no lengths given on CC  but vul|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy for West but will probably find the K of clubs based on nothing else looks sensible!|pg||
nt|viren169: North did very well to pull 4@S to 4N|pg||
nt|baldjean: indeed, @h lead does not look promising|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@s would have been -2 ...|pg||
nt|viren169: He may go passive and exit a diamond|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: switch to stiff A@C    and low diamond best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of PASS implies they play PASS/DBL Inversion here   where PASS says willing to defend  and DBL says "i'd like to bid more"|pg||
nt|ady: can get 500|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1:  9 [2@SN=]  Bertens opened 2@S [2-suiter] and was raised  that should mean yet another pickup for White House|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|twcho: Is 6@s an odd on bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: about this hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: yes, she is.. |pg||
nt|penseur9:  ok tks :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess would be 55 highly probable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: time for spade lead|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|penseur9:  again a reminder that EW had a 10 IMP carry over so very thight play here |pg||
nt|riccho:  15 Imps or so if 4@s goes down; even 10 Imps if they let 4@s thru|pg||
nt|psyck: this on escaped -1 with @c not played|pg||
nt|baldjean: N will probably lead K@H now|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer will be happy to escape for -200 here |pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: as you see   responder does NOT promise 3+fit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: soon|pg||
nt|xenya: so why didn't E lead a @H? Perhaps because he has the ace?|pg||
nt|xenya: if so, @CK must be with W|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1:  25  Jansma playing 6@C|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcphee: so E should have perhaps considered 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: thats why I am not a great believer in these defences to strong club   if you dont play the hand the auction reveals too mcuh|pg||
nt|mcphee: i am a major believer you get in their face|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the flip side   you really don't like giving Relay pair a free run in the auction|pg||
nt|mcphee: conventions like Suction or crash dak are good against strong @C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@D  limited splinter, 3@H asksm 4@D =@Hx not @C cue thx unox for that|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: Next segment will start in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  11.00 Moscow, 8.00 Paris, 7 am UK|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room on 9 west axed 4@S to gain 5 imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry zal (een beetje) verrast zijn als @H 4 1 zitten|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kemperg: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: now will explore the red suits |pg||
nt|jbennet: west still have sort of guess.|pg||
nt|jbennet: play for klub king south??|pg||
nt|jbennet: or play for at least 1 red suit 3-3?|pg||
nt|kemperg: lots of options now|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: a) he thought 4N keycard   b) he thought 6@C asking 3rd round control|pg||
nt|ady: will not be good if 4 spades reached in OR    but better than 2 spades passed out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suction is called something different in other parts of the world    i think much of europe calls it Kelsey [or maybe Yeslek]   can't recall name in New Zealand/Australia :(|pg||
nt|viren169: with a small chance of making if he can end play East!|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sybarra: :( |pg||
nt|aap00: no chance |pg||
pc|d9|nt|kemperg: even discarding a @H wont matter|pg||
nt|psyck: the saftly play for 3 tricks was @c to a & easier to make here too|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: sry berry will be surprised (a bit) with @H 41|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he will come to 8 tricks now one way or another  |pg||
nt|sybarra: now all ok |pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D was doubled  but Frank didn't give his brother a chance to bid 6N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that explains a lot including the lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzvc: brink smashing his @hJ on the table|pg||
nt|dkkello:  pitch spade  |pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't come to mind at first but it is a good idea|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i miss why he does not play @S7 in a split second?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks again all, I am staggered by the score :(|pg||

nt|ahollan1: another strong 1@C|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: unimpressive defense|pg||

nt|dkkello:  but you were right with the calculator somehow! |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it was claimed for 2 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-15, 0+@D  maybe @D and LONGER @S/@C, but as we saw with  26  NOT longer @H|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  1@S = 0-11, no major|pg||

nt|fabsayc: it seems 4@H should make|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@H=7+ HCP, maybe longer @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS = 0-4 or Penalty|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 0-5 or penalty|pg||
mb|4H|nt|penseur9:  a 7 IMP swing for O2 on board  11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many big clubbers have a bid over 1@D-(X)- to show weak hand with BOTH minors   but our EW need 5+5+|pg||
nt|mcphee: if 2@D is natural 2@H looks odd|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: I didn't notice an alert from Ton Bakkeren, but he still bid 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key point for partnership discussion    when you play against Big Clubbers where 1@D could be less than 3   are later @D bids natural or cue??|pg||
nt|xenya: lively auction all of a sudden|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looks like a 2-way checkback sequence|pg||

nt|ahollan1: XYZ same after 1N rebid  but also applies after  first 3 bids are suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT likely to make on the lay out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S 3@H 2@D 1@C   oh  4th @H promotes 2nd trump trick|pg||
nt|aap00: yes...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, @c shift other room helped|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am sure declarer wil lead a low @d at trick 2|pg||
nt|aap00: playing on @d looks natural, but probably will fail|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: when partner played @H6 he should have withdrawn the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: EW both wondering if they could pass 3@H :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  3 sets of 14 boards -- but sessions begin 30 minutes earlier than today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@C made|pg||
nt|mcphee: the trian went off the rails here|pg||
nt|ady: lucky to escape the red card here|pg||
nt|mcphee: I'll say|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW teammates in the Bermuda Bowl   wiijs-muller  playing Tarzan Precision also open 1@H with 5@H and 5+@S  but not as part of canape - it helps their relay structure|pg||
nt|chmitty: new leader :)!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Berten again gets another "yukky" trump break |pg||
nt|fabsayc: note verhess can not have four spades and 5 diamonds (no 1@S opening)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 to compare  12 imp difference|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9:  this more about how many extra tricks here|pg||
nt|penseur9:  should not have any problem here since cards lye well for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: was missed in OR  so an opportunity for leaders to extend their advantage|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  heart to king?  diamond out?|pg||
nt|aap00: to make it decl had to play for 3@c and 2 in each other|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: or best line for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not fourth best?|pg||
nt|sybarra: "yukky"  is the technical term |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4-2 is the most likely break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bertens likes his hand in context   @HQ, 5 card suit  ..|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jaapfr: tx specs Kjeld and Bob|pg||
nt|bobholl: tytoo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and a new lunch leadr|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but in EW system   opener could be 4@D 5+@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no reason to get spades wrong|pg||
nt|ady: maybe one more in end position|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks unbeatable|pg||
nt|henryb:  Gino knows declarer has 4 hearts, from the play at trick 1|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: develop a line of play WITHOUT looking at south's  doubleton @HKJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: knowing 2@D losers -- how to you cover the @S and trump losers|pg||
nt|penseur9:  how about @H finesse now?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i must hockey so bye|pg||
nt|ahollan1: odd/even discard|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky vP didn't play 7|pg||
nt|aap00: thk y, passive defense left declarer a trick short... back in control now|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I guess it was natural for West to play on clubs ... declarer doesn't have to have 4 of them|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: example   how do you play if trump 41|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: the other semi final is afer 24 of 80 97-19 to 't Onstein 1 (Drijver-Brink, Muller de wijs)|pg||
nt|ady: double of this could have put Het Witte almost level|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: and maybe that is the difference between 2@S and 2N      |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@CXX  stalled after trick 3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: good play of K rather than J|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I meant a @S finesse sorry :(|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|henryb:  I see no reason for West to panic at trick 3|pg||
nt|aap00: now @c, duck @h and wait for 9th trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Henry, against this pair, "panic" is the default mode|pg||
nt|aap00: me too: he knows that @d's are not good for declarer - looks like no reason to hurry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed, several kibitzers have suggested that|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: that's the rest of the winning Bermuda Bowl team|pg||
nt|penseur9:  tks Gerbrand... quite a lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: so for the 3rd set of the day we will broadcast this match.. |pg||
pc|d4|nt|penseur9:  @C ???|pg||
nt|dkkello:  @H ?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @H ruff best|pg||
nt|penseur9:  sorry missed that|pg||
nt|dkkello:  will give 8 tricks |pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: i meant that many would lead a spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time -- how many of you said this was a blowout after 4th set?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: will be around 44 up adfter this the leaders|pg||
nt|mcphee: i might have passed 1NT dble was W actually|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s9|nt|ady: anythin but a trump now   down 3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: creates doubt about distribution|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like Bertens moving over 2@H a lot more than Paulissen PASS|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1:  26  3N North but EW never bid|pg||
nt|ady: Jansma lost a heart in 6@C   and ran the whole club suit   and got the diamond right in the end game|pg||
nt|ady: yes I would have tht so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: played as voice commentators suggested|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  And now East is endplayed into starting the spades|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rv: yes it takes approx 7 hrs or so from Chennai to Mysore, alternately you can Cauvery express leaves Chennai at 9.30 PM and reaches early morning in Mysore|pg||
nt|xenya: time for coffee|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: in my view -- perhaps skewed -- the consensus approach would be to hope that declarer has wasted cards in spades and  may have to guess the suit, and try to build tricks elsewhere. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leading a spade puts all the eggs in one basket, whereas if it is right for the defense to play spades  they rate to get another crack at that suit (though adnmittedly it might be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too late)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|twcho: as the card lies, there is no making game contract for NS|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@h, 5@d and 3NT all go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: East tells to north it isn't going down..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  problems now |pg||
nt|penseur9:  in trouble now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table on their final board|pg||
nt|ady: seems like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: @H lead   @C to Jack|pg||
nt|mcphee: the end of the road is near for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry those 2 plays  the 3N hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: @D9  2nd/4th |pg||
nt|ady: paor that made 3NT in OR will be disappointed with this result|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: pair|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mcphee: this hand must have been a misunderstanding for e/w|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: of course declarer does not know clubs are 3-3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  declarer played @S to King then finessed losing to Jack|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bobholl: since i stopped saying huubke iso huub they win :) so i'll continue not saying huubke :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so why this line that potenitally strands dummy?|pg||
nt|ady: has 9 in the bag now  and 2 long clubs will be 11|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|penseur9:  we have a tye|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dkkello:  see you have a nice lunch  |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: ok, thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in 25 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: we will start the final session of the semi final at 13:15, that is in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: both matches very close, so we don't know what match will be on BBO|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: but it will be very exciting! :)|pg||
nt|ady: down 2 for a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: played well for -2|pg||

nt|petergill: -1, 50|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rv: Patchman led @CA on 6@s slam on brd 24, made it lot easier for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: E and W explained differently|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzzc: Jonky wrote down "S+C" while Herstein wrote "S+D"|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzc: Didn't know what 4N is , but Yi-An alerts 6@C|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|petergill: it is not the job of the BBO operator or us to question the outcome = regarding that last hand|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|petergill: with its curious ending - the play sometimes is not exactly as we think it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|petergill: The smooth duck of @DK was nice defence|pg||
nt|rv: Zack seems a trick short here|pg||
nt|rv: small @h now is best line as cards are|pg||
nt|petergill: @H5 exit to king maybe - what does East then do?|pg||
nt|rv: East's best defense is to win @HK and back a @d smoothly|pg||
nt|petergill: then @S7 to king but N does not seem to have the entries to apply pressure to East's discards|pg||
nt|rv: after Helgemo's earlier duck of @DK, Zack would not finesse |pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: I see - perhaps N can take black winners then throw East in|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|petergill: playing for friendlier club layout - @CQ play was unlucky misguess|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|rv: there seems to change of play in @cs, he is making now |pg||
nt|rv: Helgemo apparently shifted to @CT and not low @c after winning @DK|pg||
nt|petergill: I see, West played earlier for North to hold less than 4 clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: declarer might still have to guess spades or the ending|pg||
nt|petergill: @CT play explains @CQ play|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect Zack should get this ending right, he should figure out Helgemo has most of entries for not continuing pd's suit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|rv: Zack is thinking can be afford low @h now or just play @S to @SA, cash @DA check if @ds break, else play @s from dummy and guess|pg||

nt|ahollan1: honestly -- i didn't see that line |pg||
nt|ahollan1: as an option|pg||
nt|penseur9:  after board  25|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  9  3N was down 3   still no swing greater than 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West said sorry for missing the overtrick|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hs should not have played the club K|pg||
nt|penseur9:  unfortunate play|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: if he doesn't play @cK Brink will overtake|pg||
nt|penseur9:  it's almost over when slam was bid slam on 12|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what?|pg||
nt|ady: bye Michael|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last of the very bumpy set|pg||
nt|ady: last hand      thx all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead up to 60 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 41-0 for the set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the set    14 boards remain in the championship|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board :(|pg||
nt|mcphee: all games fail for e/w here|pg||
nt|aap00: ...or play @d and make @s guess automatic|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: now this might/should be fun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm sooooo tired|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes next round in 50 minutes |pg||
nt|henryb:  I think a spade at trick 3 - or a heart and a diamond back at tricks 3 & 4 would have beaten this|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  6:50am here in still pitch dark here :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: north can you find a green card|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: North asked about 3@D, and north was about to pass, but now east changed it, and North reconsidering|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had tunnel vision that @H and @D had to break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: law followers bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finishing with a fizzle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the set  [2 14-board segments remain]|pg||
nt|ady: another 5 imps    now just 22 lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: actually could also have 0@D    4405  or   4414|pg||
nt|roswolf: the vultures are interested now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: restart in 55 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5@S & (4)5+@C/@D, 3-10 HCP, 1st/3rd fav=4+|pg||
nt|ady: might try 4 spades|pg||
nt|ady: or 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N relay|pg||
nt|mcphee: or 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: law followers bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thems the laws :)|pg||
nt|ady: no game makes|pg||
nt|ady: 5 diamonds abouth the best   becomes good if no heart lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nv  1N = 14.5-17    that's really what the CC says|pg||
nt|sybarra: last bd here   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: round 5 begins in approximately 1 hour 35 minutes |pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: 3D = ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D is a new one on me, is that a type?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=2-way Multi  a) weak 2@D  b) Strong   CC says front=FG  b) FG @C/@D  c) SF @H/@S  d) 22-23 BAL|pg||
nt|fabsayc: typo|pg||
nt|ady: if west can find a pass can get a few back|pg||
nt|ady: nice swing for the leaders|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: 3@D  assumes weak @D hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi al, so what is 3@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Pre-emptive if East has the weak 2 in diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Germ writing with me |pg||
nt|kemperg: see you again and thanks, Shirley, Johann and Bas|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good stop|pg||
nt|ahollan1: questionable 4@S bid in other room|pg||
nt|ady: 5 back for the leaders|pg||
nt|ady: last of the set     thx all|pg||
nt|ady: thx Al    Bas Van   and sspecs|pg||
nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: congratulations to White House team for getting back into the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there will be voice commentary in both rooms for the final set|pg||
nt|mcphee: passing this out wins a few|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psyck: looking for 5 card maj i guess, maybe direct 3n better with such hands|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@h seems makeable here|pg||
nt|roswolf: not the most inspired lead in the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe 3@D is supposed to be invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have allowed EW to find @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Last board of the set now, we will resume at 1:15 PM local (Paris time) which is 12:15 PM London|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Last hand of the segment - thanks to our excellent operator Bas van Beijsterveldt, organisers Marc van Beijsterveldt en Ad Cosijn, and the Dutch Bridge Federation NBB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may survive this but playing 2@C multi way you pay a heavy price on the strong hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, then 3D makes a bit of sense, though if E has that handtype the "preempt" is unlikely to hurt NS much. this is a congenital disadvantage of 2-way "weak or strong" bids --  ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: until partner gets clarification he can't bid in a way that does justice to his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thanks Gerben :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and to Cornelia and Gerben on voice |pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: 1@S is 4 or 5@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S is four or five spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ditto|pg||
pc|d3|nt|twcho: despite the bad break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was 3@C showing @D or  a Relay?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  what's a semi-alert?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kemperg: and all kibs for their questions and comments|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok, i should have waited for Gerbrand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's when a partially pregnant ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  while we wait, a quick reminder that the final will take place on February 4th and 5th... don't miss it|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Ton thinking of bidding, but he knows partner probably has 4-4 in the Majors, so fit not very likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: bd 15 and 16 do not provide good hopes for Onstein 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: so they need to score some imps quickly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  2@S should make but a 2NT by NS probably down... so....|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Bas....have a beer on me :)  always helps |pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Hahaha, good idea|pg||
pc|h3|nt|penseur9:  still much to do for 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: invitational to suicide?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at other table  Bakkeren brothers play 2@C/@D AND 2@H as multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: played from other side  this still won't be a treat for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you have two nearly identical suits (like north here) does anybody have a rule on which to lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do play Smith Echoes vs NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roland just announced that restart will be 15 minutes earlier than what is posted on BBO Schedule|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so top of the hour|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thanks all - regretfully I will not be around for the last set|pg||
nt|ady: 26 hcp   stop in part score    last hand in game on nothing and 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember   more of Louk & Ricco next week from Yokohama|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: well not so much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: White House LEADS|pg||
nt|mcphee: thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|ahollan1: WHITE HOUSE WINS|pg||
nt|ady: 14 imps on 26    3NT down   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: what an incredible comeback|pg||
nt|mcphee: you were right on that one David, bidding over the @C helped|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  i''m sorry  missed final score |pg||
nt|ady: 6 on last hand  swung it back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Onstein pickup to win by 4|pg||
nt|ady: incredable finish|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about the confusion :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: 4 hearts was doubled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: on the second last board|pg||
nt|ady: on hand 26   3NT down 3    declarer had no information from defence bidding and misguessed 2nd heart to go down 3|pg||
nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we'll try to stay open to confirm final score|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: My apologizes, I didn't notice Verhees doubled 4@h when EW had the misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no worries Joris   i didn't want to go to sleep anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where was this event played?     bridge club, hotel ???|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: okay, Onstein confirmed the double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: nope, in Utrecht (the central location of the Dutch bridge federation)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks for the confirmation   and the excitement|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: bye all!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|twcho: but really need double dummy play to bring it in|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to the Dutch Bridge Federation for bringing us this great tourney ! |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: not much joy here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: flatish 15 opposite flatish 9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|penseur9:  so +1 it will be|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: IFF auction doesn't offer any hints  then highest pip count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but here  West did show @H|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzvc: South: well played :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs,  great comments and questions   |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|penseur9:  ruffing @Cs may not provide an extra trick here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st time i played after reading Larry Cohen's 1st book sure enough 2 boards against cohen-berkowitz    i followed the rules, went for 800 and got sympathy   but still a zero|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Bye all|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes not perfect example, but in fact i use the lowest pip count, and my stats are better than 50%|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: i read somewhere   87.3% of all statistics are fabricated|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3cxx made somehow, so the match still has a heartbeat|pg||
nt|fabsayc: never trust any stats with decimal points|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: now i'm having flashback to opening of M*A*S*H|pg||
nt|penseur9:  not here Cornelia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great point from Gerben [voice]   with zero controls, Westra could/should assume East has Strong variety|pg||
pc|d2|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry and on voice was Ralf Wilquist,  thx to you also |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@CXX did make   but only worth 5 imps to trailing team|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: that plus Jansma PASS|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  @H10 for clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since 2C is presumably forcing, S is under no great pressure to bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can make on diamond return with squeeze and endplay|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  It can make on a diamond return|pg||
pc|d8|nt|twcho: the @c return helps a lot|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: *Willquist |pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all later |pg||
pc|sT|pg||

pc|dT|nt|twcho: now the play is simple|pg||

nt|ahollan1: good cash by Verhees|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes very|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South guessed the @S for -2 :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1/2 from onstein 1 and 2 were world champion :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9:  anybody for slam EW here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  12  quiet auction in the other room   4@H North vs our 5@DX-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Systemic 1NT here ... 12-14, "semi-balanced"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1:  26  Bos in 4@S  where vP made 3@S exactly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S showing @S was a fluke in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: to a boring 3nt|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=FG  a) BAL [no singleton/void], 8+ HCP  b) 3 places-to-play, 12-14 HCP    nothing boring about THAT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: tx dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: other table is slow as well, so director might cancel 29 and 30|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: not really to grey a hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=bal|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think you should start @dA, @hA, @h ruff, @dK @h ruff - if the @h K comes down you can claim|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  And a very robust intervention by East, opposite his passed partner|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jaapfr: pls check why NS in OR so high in 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  @S2|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jaapfr: S has ""nothing""|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If the @d is a stiff you have very few chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: the last round leader has now been demoted to 2nd place while the last round 4th placed team has now become the current leader|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  doesn't look that we'll get a swing here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: and either non-opener or 1@C opener  [so not 12-14]|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|penseur9:  so 3nt it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C asked   3@H = 4@H maybe another 4card suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|twcho: Jingfan is leading with 187, SanChen 2nd with 182, Huamen 3rd 180|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees did have option to continue asking|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|bobholl: but n will have show at least 16|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|chick:  Does anyone in the audience know (not guess) what happens in the case of a tie?|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|bobholl: 1@S 1@D and 1@H for sure so too risky|pg||
pc|h8|nt|aap00: overruff, underlead @c and 2 rounds of @d :) human - foundable?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  don't think so|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  easier if you have access to the hand records|pg||

nt|petergill: The problem on Bd 26 in this table was in part that East's Dbl of 5@c could be a hand with extras (hence 6CD), whereas at the other table Pass of 4@C clearly showed a poor opening|pg||
nt|rv: Peter, I believe Helness erred in doubling 5@c though I am not aware of their methods|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzzc: 0/2 4th lead for N-S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|rv: If my partner's doubles 5@c on that auction, I will bid slam with Helgemo's hand as well|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Zack should win @CQA not @CK, but either card is OK (certainly not @CQ)|pg||
nt|petergill: win @CA I mean|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to win this and cash @cs to escape for 1 down|pg||
nt|petergill: still on Bd 26: but if Helgemo is planning to pass out 5@c with an ordinary hand, isn't it reasonable for Helness to increase the (100 or 200) to (200 or 500)?|pg||
nt|petergill: but Venky I do see your point, you are probably right|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|petergill: Bd 26: another way of looking at it is that East dbls 5@C only if East thinks his side is being robbed by 5@C of a possible game - that's argues for Venky not for me |pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: vP really hated his @SQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's the only explanation for 5@H rather than some hedge|pg||

pc|h6|pg||

nt|penseur9:  any idea from what side?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: I don't know, all players not know for being fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious to have time pressure in a set that includes a PASS OUT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they didn't pass it out at the other table :)|pg||
