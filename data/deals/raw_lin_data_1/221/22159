nt|ady: England have some ground to make up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: e/w   can make 5@C       but not likely to get there|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Hi all, welcome back|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening all|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: Both pairs 15-17 NT, but NS play 4card majors and EW 5card majors|pg||
nt|ady: nice suit to raise 1 more level?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe the suit was too strong to open 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this is rather funny - presumably double of 3@h would not be penalty|pg||
nt|ady: if e/w got to 5@C    could they think it possible A@H right for the ruffing finesse?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h is presumably not an invitation to bid four|pg||
nt|ady: well if north does raise   they will hear from west|pg||
nt|golfsquash: N/S will be pleased to play 3@h-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if North does go 4@H, West will doubel, because you are allowed to make penalty doubles of game contracts  |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ady: and now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: K@H lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: going for ruffs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: as in a lot of sports, the English captain must have had a lot to say at half-time  |pg||

pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: south open 1NT in CR   and west overcalled 2@H   passed out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South is in that unenviable position of knowing that he is going down in a doubled contract |pg||
pc|hT|pc|d8|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite a common position for some of us|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|trotto: 2@d in 1@c-1M-2@d is an artificial relay, forcing to game. The opener usually promises 3+M with such bid.  |pg||
nt|trotto: 2@s response promises a better hand (10+points) and exactly 4@h here. |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|trotto: 3@h sounds encouraging, rest of bids are cuebids. I only don't know why E bypassed the @d cuebid. Slam is a very good contract here. |pg||
