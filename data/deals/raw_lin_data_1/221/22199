mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|roswolf: a simple 3nt!?|pg||

nt|trotto: artificial, kind of cuebid...|pg||
mb|d|nt|trotto: oops, sry, priv|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!s|nt|trotto: so declarer played twice wrong: first he didn't play a low @d towards dummy's Ax and then he didn't duck the Q@d... very poor performance as for such experienced player!|pg||

nt|roswolf: showing|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|trotto: 2@d in 1@c-1M-2@d is an artificial relay, forcing to game. The opener usually promises 3+M with such bid.  |pg||
nt|trotto: 2@s response promises a better hand (10+points) and exactly 4@h here. |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|trotto: 3@h sounds encouraging, rest of bids are cuebids. I only don't know why E bypassed the @d cuebid. Slam is a very good contract here. |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|dburn: but Scotland and Wales are both powering away in their respective matches, so this looks as though it could be a pretty close Camrose series|pg||
