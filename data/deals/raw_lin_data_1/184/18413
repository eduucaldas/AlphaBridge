nt|ady: hi Bernard|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like we have a precision pair|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: i wonder if anyone would open the minimum number of diamonds allowed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a routine 4@s|pg||
nt|muppe: NS seem to play two-way @c|pg||

nt|mmmakela: for running scores etc|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: retract 4@S|pg||

nt|haans: NS  Big Clubs|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|grebrof: Norway is the defending champions from Lillehammer 2007 and they are also the current leaders|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|haans: dont understand 2@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: lead invating opening here|pg||
nt|jwit: Not that wild about multi bid on 5 card suit and weak hand vulnerable|pg||
nt|jwit: East let them off the hook|pg||
nt|friggi: but that would have been more fun for us:)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Edwin|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H looks likely|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: nagic diamonds thus 1@S 8-12 can have longer minor|pg||
nt|haans: magic|pg||
nt|haans: good game with spades 3-3|pg||
nt|haans: NS play Carrot clubs|pg||
nt|bjurn:  W is probably worried about a misfit|pg||
nt|haans: helping EW avoid slamming|pg||
nt|jwit: Not likely to bid a slam anyway, however, without the 2D bid, 4H would have problems.  Now at least declarer will know spade suit is breaking badly.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi to all kibs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  running scores|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1@c will be openign in a stronger and i guess also in some natural system (unless u decide for 2nt) |pg||
nt|muppe: 1@c being 10-12 bal or any 16+|pg||
nt|jjsb: ok Vesa thanks ! |pg||
nt|ady: needs some care   should play hearts first|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Bernard|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: 8 tricks 9th in clubs?|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|jjsb: not clear at all what to play here ... 4@h seems to be the contract but not sure its easy to reach it |pg||
nt|psridhar: i know of one version of Precision where the auction wd go 2@d-2@h all pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: south joins in the fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: interestingly they they have typed some of finnish players first names too, so from finland there are playing Pia Erkkilä and Hulda Ahonen, pair that plays strong club (15+)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: also welcome to Magnus|pg||
nt|haans: got that better |pg||
nt|haans: skipping bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Hans, Jon and Dan|pg||

nt|muppe: and EW play Natural 5542|pg||
nt|ady: hi Haans|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: the norwegians are playing a natural system with 5 card majors - the finnish girls prefer a strong (+15hp) 1@c|pg||

nt|haans: vScore: http://landslagsbridge.se/ + Twitter|pg||

nt|rnmalik: can make 12 tricks on the placement of cards.|pg||
nt|haans: hi Espen|pg||
nt|derric: hello again|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Not the best of suits to overcall 1@s but some would, especially if pd has not passed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  so he did not|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but will lead one|pg||
nt|jjsb: with nothing bad happening |pg||
nt|jjsb: @s mead will come and well we know what will happen |pg||
nt|haans: Hi Narki|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might protect but it could be so wrong|pg||
pc|dT|nt|iceking: S took a rather passive view here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W can perhaps see, that 1@d is bid on a 4-card suit, so a small from dummy|pg||
nt|iceking: not sure i could play def vs 2@H here, though bidding is little strange also as you are not sure you have fitt anywere|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Gautis|pg||
nt|haans: Hej Roland Jon & Dan|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3NT is better|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Markku|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hello Markku|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so now 9 from top|pg||
nt|muppe: 3NT a bit gambling, who needs stoppers?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gautis2: hello, and good morning:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: He may be a bit biassed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wife playing as South|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is the winning contract - espescially now with the natural @d-lead from E|pg||
nt|fabsayc: explain|pg||
nt|muppe: This time indeed N had easy @S lead.|pg||
nt|haans: Marko :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  Kunne Ãst ikke have overmeldt med 4 Ru?|pg||
nt|grebrof: the norwegians are naturalists (besides the bery weak NT in nonvul 1st-3rd) opposite the more artificial approach from the finnish|pg||
nt|haans: finns Magic Diamond?|pg||
nt|grebrof: I have thai keyboard, so there is a chance for mistyping - bery = very|pg||
nt|haans: yes close for me 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: these two plays magid diamond . the other pair strong @c|pg||
nt|sharkey: I have the same problem Espen - not Thai but Thumbs....|pg||
nt|grebrof: lol|pg||
nt|grebrof: I will try to look before I post|pg||
nt|grebrof: back to the game...|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt  a make|pg||
nt|grebrof: this ended in a draw 15-15VP last meeting|pg||
nt|sharkey: Marianne Harding and Ann Karin Fuglestad are the anchor pair of the Norwegian team - many years international experience|pg||
nt|grebrof: duck a @D is a loser if @ds are QJ block, but will make 9 tricks anyhow|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|haans: no they have played Magic Diamond before here|pg||
nt|haans: say yesterday |pg||
nt|runnerup: no it is the other pair|pg||
nt|haans: :) ok|pg||
nt|jwit: Still a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|robinswr: I play 4@h as an artificial spade slam try |pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi Marko|pg||
nt|ady: 2nd heart best|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: any way safer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure that hand justifies it|pg||
nt|gmarco24: narko?  :)|pg||
nt|haans: Both play Big Club|pg||
nt|haans: My odds for 3nt|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gautis2: figure i still not know her well enoghe since i dont have a clue what 3@h means:)|pg||
nt|haans: still done understand 3@C cards for only 2@S|pg||
nt|bjurn:  this should be makeable if W handles @H with only two losers|pg||
nt|haans: Johansson may get a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Hi Hans, Skafti|pg||
nt|haans: transfer (to NT) response|pg||
nt|robinswr: obvious they don't do that|pg||
nt|jjsb: its gambling but maybe not much of alternative... basically play that when ur partenr shows a balanced hand , considering there is no overcall ?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: 4@H better that 3Nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: if north had opened 2@S muilderburg then the auction would have had a different cadence|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|iceking: was no rush for Ace of @D|pg||
nt|grebrof: hello Hans :)|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, and at least they got the play in the right hand. Diamond lead through East would make a difficult hand more difficult|pg||
nt|bridge_one: losing 1@h 1@S and 1@D need a good job to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @D can be discarded aver K@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need a correct timing|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hi - mys danish were just the daily exercises...|pg||
nt|iceking: low would keep better control af everything|pg||
nt|sharkey: undo?|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing special happened because ew has 8-9 trick in clubs |pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think declarer will use a cross ruff |pg||
pc|c2|nt|grebrof: Stine has had some very good results, so its about time she got her chance for the national team (gautis being biased or not)|pg||
nt|grebrof: she is NOT playing with you now my friend :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2NT may be with 5 hearts so bidding an error|pg||
nt|diaoff: Hi all|pg||
nt|haans: missed a trick |pg||
nt|haans: defense|pg||
nt|haans: @H9 and 8 = dubble stopper|pg||
pc|c5|nt|zebutin: different openings from 1st/2nd hand and 3rd/4th for finnish pair, but from 1st and 2nd they play weak nt, and 1@D-1@S openings are 10-14 and 4card suit|pg||
nt|gautis2: :) ..well, cant argue with sucess, since 4@s was born to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=475&csm=Rank&nt=3&nb=1&csh=0000000000111|pg||
nt|Walddk5: running scores|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes - Harding - Fuglestad also was part of the team that won last time at Lillehammer in 2007|pg||
nt|cenglund:  SpA was hardly discarded|pg||
nt|sharkey: She really pitched @SA on @C lead operator?|pg||
nt|haans: spade ace|pg||
nt|haans: on lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: Finland 2009 was the last championships I am told (thanks Geo) - looking at the unions homepage, you might get tricked|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - E sh come in first to play a heart through|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I play as here, 4 @H 55 no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|ady: now in some danger  if east clears ddiamonds will need to take spade finesse for contract|pg||
nt|haans: allmost all Swedish players (at IMPs) play some kind of Big Clubs|pg||
nt|ady: had declarer played a 2nd heart east would have no entry unless ducking again  in which case declarer plays clubs finessing into west hand  and spade finesse then not needed|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and S has been cought already after trick1|pg||
nt|iceking: not so odd open room reached 4@H-3, |pg||
nt|gmarco24: 4@h was a slam try? do they play std 1nt or weak?  :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: well its not MP|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: Operator wake up :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: that might well have ended the auction|pg||
pc|c3|nt|grebrof: and Rashed :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Finland needs a 22-8 win to go past Denmark|pg||
nt|friggi: This is straight forward play|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: it would have probably stolen the partscore|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi and welcome.|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes, 3NT could work, and you dont have any good bid either|pg||
nt|jjsb: not knowing much of the system (at least for me) hard to comment where the "mistake" is , if any |pg||
nt|gmarco24: had to work on this one to make|pg||
nt|psridhar: even here N might hv introduced 2@s -having passed originally|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: this deal just boring|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nubmaster: The Icelandic pair plays a 5533 system with better minor and 1NT 14-17 and the Swedes 5542 with transfers after 1@c|pg||
nt|diaoff: yes, time to claim|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|haans: best low hearts|pg||
nt|mmmakela: claim time|pg||
nt|haans: may need luck|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d6|nt|jwit: Surprised at that play.  Diamond to the A, A of clubs pitch a diamond, ruff a club, heart to the ace, ruff another club, would put declarer in great shape|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|iceking: hi Krishna|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he3llo|pg||
nt|haans: good carding in defense best|pg||
nt|gmarco24: @hs are protected, but @d is dangerous now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|runnerup: ok that is a lot but very many big swings in many matches has been seen before so who knows|pg||
nt|haans: odds against E having 4 hearts|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h7|nt|bridge_one: yes, i thought declarer would play in thet way|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|robinswr: I see no reason to explore another fit once you have found one|pg||
nt|psridhar: a dealyed entry such as this 2@d shd have values -from a safety pt of view|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: what to discard on 5th clubs|pg||
nt|gmarco24: sooner or later he'll play @s to K. A@s, J@d would set this|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is this sort of hand which makes me always bid weak 2 suiters at the 2 level at equal vul|pg||
pc|s2|nt|zebutin: For swedish women sadly i dont know their system, so we just have to wait and see|pg||

nt|robinswr: I agree also|pg||

nt|haans: second 3nt try|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be fun|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: a well deserved lead too|pg||
nt|haans: weak opening 7-11|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Anyway, ti was easier to play than to bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: good start for Norway avoiding the impossible 4@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: some kind of Multi...|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
nt|haans: very high in hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 if E doesnt get a spade ruff|pg||
nt|diaoff: Need to find the @S ruff to beat 6@H|pg||
nt|haans: now slamming|pg||
nt|grebrof: good slam|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 8-11|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S make 9 tricks at Nt without lead @h in this strange hand (make 5@S guessing to play J@S from dummy)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|haans: ??|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT ok without a heart lead|pg||
nt|haans: hard for EW to find hearts lead|pg||
mb|1N|nt|zebutin: 1nt 15-17 from 3rd hand|pg||
nt|haans: easy make in 3nt at last board|pg||
nt|haans: very few will bid to slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: may be pushed if EW saves too much|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: no game|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dbl or 3 @H?|pg||
nt|derric: likely passed out|pg||
nt|peachy: Which is why 2NT is called the slamkiller, though was not last hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  running scores|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C a good alternative|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@s on NS|pg||
nt|iceking: good slam here |pg||
nt|iceking: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|grebrof: the +15 @c comes into action|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pass or Correct|pg||
nt|diaoff: 4NT now, maybe?|pg||
nt|haans: yep find it now|pg||
nt|jbgood: but of course difficult to know what to do on S's cards - doesnt know about the di void|pg||
nt|diaoff: If she passes, She will soon find out the possibility I guess|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 h has poschances -by w at least|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1@D 8-11 bal, 4M 4+m or 5-5ms|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1@H relay|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@H bal 4@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: some might overcall 2@h|pg||
nt|muppe: Good slam for EW but they are just missing two aces|pg||
nt|jjsb: we all know basically we want to play 5@d of course 1@s 2@d 3@d seems the road |pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt without hearts lead best :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D seems makeable n/s wonder if they will find the fit let alone the game|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: lot of options for S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They finished in 5@c last deal in open after some relay bids with 3 rounds of @h for -1|pg||
nt|jbgood: one push - yes, she will be wiser if W prefers @d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a grand.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D alerted bec not forcing ( i suppose)|pg||
nt|haans: grossly overbidding|pg||
nt|muppe: So that means that slam doesnt make|pg||
nt|jjsb: not the slam is far of out of question by west of coruse ! i dotn have to precise |pg||
nt|ady: east very agressive |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: chose drury|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@C probably one way drury|pg||
nt|sharkey: If N can find a take out x now....|pg||
nt|haans: 1. Interview Fulvio Fantoni http://www.confsudbridge.org/hitsII/fantoni001i.aspx: If you had to choose a convention, which one would you pick?|pg||
nt|haans: 2. Fantoni: Gazzilli... is a convention that I think should be used by all who play natural bridge|pg||
nt|haans: 3. Gazzilli:  http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/public/1239625981_14209_FT0_gazzillind.pdf |pg||
nt|grebrof: 2@d showing +8hp (if Gazilli)|pg||
nt|friggi: no problems here|pg||
nt|haans: But Aldeborg very right|pg||
nt|ady: no preference from west|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3N too|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the fit is known to north|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjurn:  2@S more relay|pg||
nt|muppe: Maybe W can now just ask keys.|pg||
nt|muppe: And he does|pg||
nt|jjsb: ok so west wand to know aces to know what level to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@d showing a good opening with at least game interest|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D real opening,as i play myself here i would bid 3@D with north hand natural and slammish|pg||
nt|nubmaster: So a good start for Sweden here|pg||
nt|gautis2: partscore battle|pg||
nt|grebrof: as a guess I would think the dbl of 1@h from E is 5-7hp - their card says nothing about what "neg dbls" are|pg||
nt|gautis2: i guess x shows hp s not @s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: too complicated to remember Haans:)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D GF if strong|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is a game|pg||
nt|haans: puppet|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in contrary 1X is often a game killer passed out|pg||
nt|haans: nat still not find hearts lead|pg||
nt|haans: may|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: 6@D had been my choice|pg||
nt|jbgood: dbl seems a bit much? Prd is likely to have 10 minor cards...|pg||
nt|haans: scary|pg||
nt|haans: best for EW|pg||
nt|derric: ok, wouldn't re-open opposite 12-14NT|pg||
nt|jjsb: practical bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@d a nice treatment there Magnus|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 3D/3H transfer nodays 3@C just showing max|pg||
nt|jbgood: so a doubled overtrick...|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree its a good convention - you rarely stop in 2@c anyway|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would for sure|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not much to lose, lots to gain|pg||
nt|runnerup: 800 -a game yes|pg||
nt|runnerup: and for nothing real game |pg||
nt|mmmakela: and Hulda did nice to pas(of course imo)|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok 500 |pg||
nt|mmmakela: although 4 @H might slip home this is a sure winner|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes nicely nosed to pass -good decision|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bidding duplicated in OR|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok that s for that winning then|pg||
nt|haans: in my opinion not cards for 1@S|pg||
nt|skaftij:  easy 4@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: puppet seq|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@h cheap|pg||
nt|haans: can make 4@S ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: NORTH'S SPADES ARE HARDLY A SUIT OF POWER AND QUALITY|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2@s as invitational raise and 3@d as normal raise is a gud system|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ianmcc: 4@h seems to need to find @dQ, tho 4th @s could be useful|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no, 420|pg||
nt|ianmcc: in fact makes if no @c switch|pg||
nt|ady: lack of penalty double of 4@H may point to a heart lead|pg||
nt|haans: and alive :)|pg||
nt|haans: good point David|pg||
nt|ady: should cross to north to play first round of clubs   in case of stiff ace with east|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: in 4@H you would seem to lose 2 @S + @C, because spades are 3-3 you can throw one diamond to 4th spade|pg||
nt|zebutin: so might not need to quess diamond suit|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room finnish women played 2@S some down, there is magic diamond system in effect, that has 8-11 openings in 1st and 2nd hand, so makes often for different scores|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is a very good contract for NS|pg||
nt|haans: You can later read: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/public/1239625981_14209_FT0_gazzillind.pdf |pg||
nt|bjurn:  2NT 3433 or 34(42) (I think)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2NT =4@C (ty kibs)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@S 3424, 3 controls (A=2, K=1)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  so EW will probably end up in 4@S now|pg||
nt|haans: may go slamming?|pg||
nt|bjurn:  E needs @HA, @DK and @DA to be onside|pg||
nt|haans: clubs king in diamond|pg||
nt|bjurn:  or @DAK and @HA to be onside|pg||
nt|bjurn:  @SJxx @HQxxx @DAK @Cxxxx might be a picture|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or 2@D = 3@H support |pg||
nt|gmarco24: A@s>10@d or A@s>@c ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: like 2@s in the auction 1@H-1N-2@d-2@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes PS they are and looks as if south may accept an invitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: not the important to play 41/30 if @c are the trump of course as i forgot a lot of bid i just decide to make it like this everytime :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: N will likely blast to slam in spite of missing a keycard|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Anyone who can tell us about the bidding here? 2NT like good/bad NT or something?|pg||
nt|haans: thats a "modern" weak 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl from N is good seing the layout|pg||
nt|jwit: Don't mind it non vulnerable at one level.  If nothing else, it is surely the suit you want led|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so to open 2 NT/ 1x is delicate business|pg||
nt|robinswr: this auction doesn't make sense to me. at some point someone has to limit their hand. also if there is no slam posibility then why describe your hands|pg||
nt|psridhar: i do not know if N bid 2@s as invitn raise or natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope - couldnt envisage the perfect cards opposite|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5@d is a good IMP game , tough to reach|pg||
nt|roswolf: very tough|pg||
pc|s4|nt|derric: good morning|pg||
nt|roswolf: play should be quick|pg||
nt|psridhar: he will take his @c pitches first i guess|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iceking: W made a very light 3rd seat opening in open room|pg||
nt|grebrof: can they count to 13?|pg||
nt|peachy: Current trend is to respond lighter than we did in the past so the 1x passed is less prominent danger|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mbruun:  THis aggressive lead will cost the defense a trick, and HQ another one, so all of a sudden nine tricks turned to eleven. No big deal in teams though |pg||
nt|haans: scoring blood|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@S is a mild slam try, if I remember correctly|pg||
nt|haans: do like that bidding :)|pg||
nt|haans: often you start with relays all ending in slam Then you get older|pg||
nt|haans: no good lead|pg||
nt|jjsb: we can have a coffee :) (not sure we will have time to drink it thougth) :) |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder what 5@s here was|pg||
nt|iceking: 4nt might be even number of aces |pg||
nt|psyck: oh Turbo|pg||
nt|iceking: at least it looks like it |pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably negative|pg||
nt|iceking: been told 4nt shows 3+aces|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, not Turbo then, just their own methods|pg||
nt|iceking: nicely done anyway |pg||
nt|nubmaster: well done here, both K and J in @s works so no trouble with Q of @h offside|pg||
nt|gautis2: not fan of 4@h  ..better to do an invitasional bid after 2@s ...not this "shot"|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is sometimes the problem with strong 1@c - in a contested auction like this, you dont always know if 2@s is a bid with 4 or 5 @ss - now they escaped|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe...|pg||
nt|sharkey: may escape with down 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice to see such a young table in a very strong competition like this|pg||
nt|haans: dont understand @DA now does Fuglestad know who has @DK and Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E can therefore 5NT.|pg||
nt|haans: yes that is true |pg||
nt|jwit: Great start for declarer|pg||
nt|haans: but with spades you can come in later|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S with 3A 4333 and opener up isn't so ortodoxe - better a inviting bid with raise (2N, 2@H depending on agreements)|pg||
nt|ady: not good play   but will be ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: is the relevant website|pg||
pc|d5|nt|zebutin: good day Juho, its allready 14.00 in finland...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Juho, 2100 in Melbourne|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks and next|pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like one loser in each suit|pg||
nt|jwit: Not that easy if you are at the 3 level the next time it's your turn to bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy he can take all 13 now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mmmakela: boring no chance for 6 except dias lead and K|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H seems too much with no spade honour, and i would for sure bid slam with south hand as auction went|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dirty waters but ok this time|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gautis2: y, should  be 200|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - 4 nt told about 4 @ds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: EW play udca, 1st discard o/e|pg||
nt|bjurn:  wont be any problem to get 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@H i meant|pg||
nt|robinswr: lucky can't misguess diamonds|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes nothing special in the play. NS just take their two aces.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|psyck: after Souths free bid & jump to 4@s, N could have also bid slam other table, but was tougher after opps intervention i guess|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that's telling them|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: :( :( :( Gazzilli :( :( :(|pg||

nt|gautis2: board 1 was a coopy of 3NT, so well done to both teams|pg||

nt|grebrof: vulnerability is "right", so can understand 4@h too|pg||
nt|diaoff: Unless color blind, the opps also know the vulnerabilities, so I also vote for 6@D.|pg||
nt|haans: and play must be safe|pg||
nt|gmarco24: poor S is thinking about singleton K@d or Kx@d at W... only what works for him|pg||
nt|haans: ruff with @HA play more hearts?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|haans: Why did Aldeborg bid 4@H To show better hearts or ...|pg||
nt|ady: can finesse in diamonds now   should assume east at least 5-5 in majors   and has shown 2 clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: best defense|pg||
nt|diaoff: Thats also easier from here than at the table though...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nubmaster: In Open Marie and Pia get to 4@h which seems to be doomed, especially when E lead a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was a bad play. return @cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and defence will have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not finessing @h first round... doesn't matter if E got the Q alone... E indicates both A and Q of @s because of the play|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ofc, Kxx is less likely|pg||

nt|grebrof: as they said about Marty Bergens preempts like that: "It doesnt matter what you have, its still not good enough"|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@C-4@H |pg||
nt|haans: dirty 2@D|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@H is high enough here, loosing 2@S, 1@H, 1@D, 1@C|pg||
nt|haans: may not make 3@H|pg||
nt|jjsb: this apparently belong EW i suspect we are suppose to play 3nt ? |pg||
nt|haans: Peter Olofsson S|pg||
nt|haans: agree to that|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Sounds reasonable|pg||
nt|haans: or 4NT -5@S-7@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|haans: the correct scoring never done here |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 @S anyone?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: spades lost now?|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would double with the north hand since i have four spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: N Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: S peter och N Björn |pg||
nt|haans: odd vul bidding|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|iceking: S bid 4@S and east dbl |pg||
nt|gautis2: victory |pg||
nt|gautis2: good to stop...system victory|pg||
nt|runnerup: it doent help east had 1 club trick still already|pg||
nt|derric: i hope this is agreed as worse weak 2 major opening|pg||
nt|bjurn:  EW makes 5@S though, guessing @Ss|pg||
nt|jwit: Can't be right auction|pg||
nt|haans: 5-5 spades + other|pg||
nt|jwit: This can't be right.  West would never pass initially.|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR see West|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes or part-score just in clubs, we'll see.|pg||
nt|haans: 12-15 dia or any M|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|zebutin: Ahonen has quite bad values for balancing at red zone, even though has decent 6 card suit...but risks are quite high|pg||
nt|iceking: will be disaster if w gamble on 5@C here|pg||
nt|psyck: bot at this vul maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: *not|pg||
nt|haans: nowday most play AK hoping|pg||
nt|jjsb: do we rebid 3@c (assuming its forcing to game) the @s void is not a good things |pg||
nt|psridhar: long time since bridge players believed 3N is thin on 27 hcp :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: or 5@D of course|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|hawe45:  No comments...|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Favourable lie for NS, a number of tricks in a @h contract|pg||
nt|ady: part score likely|pg||
nt|roswolf: the spade position is delicate|pg||
mb|2S|nt|iceking: option ofcourse but will catch very bad dummy and on best def will go for 1100|pg||
nt|haans: and spade lead?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Guess she asked for it - now just make it....|pg||
nt|grebrof: this CAN make|pg||
nt|haans: home if hearts better|pg||
nt|derric: yes, 0-7hcp 5-6M|pg||
nt|haans: ahh she have extra :)|pg||
nt|derric: this can be defeated|pg||
nt|haans: pass 17+ or weak|pg||
nt|jjsb: but see that hand !!|pg||
nt|jjsb: hard to resist with a powerfull 5 5 |pg||
nt|roswolf: but i take your point ps|pg||
nt|roswolf: north is persistent|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ianmcc: when she doesn't balance it argues bad spades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh dear... system error|pg||
nt|grebrof: N showing 20-21hp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this will probably run to the J, and N will switch to a Major. the question is - which one?|pg||
nt|haans: agressive defense are not called for|pg||
nt|runnerup: Anni dint open in other table ,althought they have also that weak,very weak 2h opening  |pg||
nt|haans: dont understand 1nt (5 minor + and 4-c M??)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: E/W could be in trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: presumable south showed the majors|pg||
mb|d|nt|diaoff: Looks like 140 in sight for EW|pg||
nt|haans: all in right|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Ah - East wanted to know, which major South had, before bidding 3 NT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Here you'd like to play canapé, first showing 4c @s and then longer @d but there's no room for that|pg||
nt|grebrof: the good @c-suit being the missing hp|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I bet she is not going to make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even be 170|pg||
nt|haans: Solid bidding by NS|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dias ruff beats 4 @H|pg||
nt|friggi: I think they already are|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: y, fair upgrade|pg||
nt|grebrof: never lead from the J as they say - no leads look appealing for E|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very favourable layout.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|bjurn:  I wonder what 2@H by East would've meant|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and 3 clubs to add to that(that's why I dbl)|pg||
nt|jjsb: 3@d some kind of 4th suit and 3 nt will stop that i think |pg||
nt|roswolf: might rest here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: @s looks reasonable enough|pg||
nt|haans: in my book 5-5 er|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I am not a fan of that|pg||
nt|friggi: no anymore:)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: rescued|pg||
nt|gmarco24: almost everything off side here|pg||
nt|muppe: Indeed, so 3NT that is|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now we just need Olausson as West, then the confusion is complete|pg||
nt|psridhar: this will test Gronkvist severely|pg||
nt|roswolf: why did east not show @D?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|nubmaster: They play transfer bids over 1@c, ie 1@d=@h etc...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: next and some coffee brb|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just 9 tricks, not very friendly|pg||
nt|psridhar: quick analysts claim this can make lets see|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMM BOW AND ARROW BRIDGE BUT THE ARROW HAS HIT EAST'S EYE|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mbruun:  Careful defense will hold this to nine tricks, if South ducks heart in trick 2|pg||
nt|psyck: not a good start for Iceland|pg||
nt|iceking: might be the worsed possible dummy W could get|pg||
nt|iceking: now @D return and 4 down for 1100|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but major suit wastages were known on bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but couldn´t W suspect bad @s honours on E?|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Christer|pg||
nt|haans: yep my money on that 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is always a wrong line, but ok|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and will be, once N gets in with @C Q will play spades|pg||
nt|haans: somethimes cost that strong hand have the options|pg||
nt|robinswr: actually i would double a 1@c opener also|pg||
nt|jjsb: this will probably defeat the contract as i see it .. |pg||
nt|muppe: Cards dont lie well for declarer|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yuval10: you only need from partner something like HXX for it to be very successful. not this time though|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or pd's suit?|pg||
nt|friggi: this will make due the friendly layout|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not me ever if nat|pg||
nt|ianmcc: probably one down|pg||
nt|friggi: but decl has tempo to collect 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Alsowithout ducking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if 1@h shows @s - why not bid the 6-card @d?|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes, this is unlikely to make.|pg||
nt|jjsb: u basically win if @c are working (assuming @d are not 52 so its probably the loine choosing |pg||
nt|muppe: @cQ dropping and @HK right there would be easy tricks|pg||
nt|haans: dia 3-3 against|pg||
pc|h6|nt|iceking: if w was on heat one dummy would be J9xx AKx Ax AJxx and 5@C is easy make |pg||
nt|gautis2: but this will probably fail by 1..  so i presume 4 more imps to Finland,..  I need my coffee..brb:)|pg||
nt|haans: We have had long diskussion From Norway are Norwegian but also Norse = old version|pg||
pc|hA|nt|grebrof: unlucky |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to CK|pg||
nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|yuval10: hello|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Pekka Viitasalo|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Hi Pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Pekka|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|derric: might go down now|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But shouldn't W bid 1@s as 2-3 @s and minimum?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: anyone for a double from W of 3 @c ? |pg||
nt|jjsb: if @c are ok u will just do 5@c 1@h 1@d and 2@s i guess |pg||
nt|ady: low trump lead would have been hood   there is some play now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: why @HK - ruff @S and low up better...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: you could be right, but D!Q?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sorry @dQ?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|grebrof: the finnish is using reversed carding . the 2 showing an equal number of cards in @cs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: right|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now dias|pg||
nt|ady: good|pg||
nt|psridhar: game must be to concede one @s and 2 trump tricks and make |pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2nd trump play was an error|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ianmcc: no hope|pg||
nt|haans: clubs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|robinswr: I play equal level conversions so if partner bids diamonds, then a heart bid shows no extra values|pg||
nt|peachy: It becomes a matter of priorities, flaw in shape in a minor for TO Double in  my opinion is negligible|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that works out in some deals|pg||
nt|robinswr: last time i looked, you rather play in majors than minors|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i think N's hand had enough entries, so Q@h was interesting idea|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: after the K|pg||
nt|haans: she was not fooled :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: can she read this?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: enda chansen|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but costly if wrong|pg||
nt|haans: duck once them KING my motto|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|muppe: ok, yes if you can read that @ds are 4-3|pg||
nt|jjsb: rigth |pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks -1 and probably -2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  East will not play @C - so 4 tricks to N/S anyway|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Agree Ralf, an error in the system here or a bidding misunderstanding, think it's the first one though|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I'm sure 2@d is conventional here so there was no room for it as natural|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
pc|c8|nt|grebrof: I think it is a good slam and noone would have made it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  If your prempts can be such as in this case, partner should me more cautious|pg||
nt|haans: but lucky no clubs lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good play of @H for an additional entry to hand.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkey: live by the sword - die by the sword....|pg||
nt|cenglund:  be|pg||
nt|haans: Final Norse: lennartj: Norseman=Viking eller nordbo|pg||
nt|haans: there is a reason why spades are played|pg||
nt|derric: now give away a @D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 hearts 1st but then must play dias|pg||
nt|haans: weak opening did cost|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer has 7 tricks even without the @d finesse - 2@c, 1@h, 1@s, 1@d, so had South played @d, it was possible that E would just play the Ace|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: no i predict -1|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: oldest of them all|pg||
nt|jwit: Can't really make this hand unless he can swindle a club trick, which he just did!|pg||
nt|jwit: Might have needed to make that play before pulling second trump|pg||
nt|haans: i tend to always tell that|pg||
pc|s6|nt|derric: conceding down 1 now i suppose|pg||
nt|derric: oh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can´t understand why a 4-card is more important to show than to bid 1@d|pg||
pc|s7|nt|iceking: 800 for 14imps |pg||
nt|nubmaster: But perhaps E will skip the @s and just go for the @ds from the start, it's teams and gamebonus looks really far away|pg||
nt|ralfwil: !½s10|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c10...|pg||
nt|yuval10: unless NS are playing 2nd/4th carding , then the K@d is marked|pg||
nt|haans: endplaying North|pg||
nt|robinswr: the 1@h overcall kept EW from finding their 8-card major suit fit|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for me t/o dbl is sacred: either all unbid suits or strong|pg||
nt|robinswr: for me all i need is support for the unbid majors|pg||
nt|jjsb: not the 5 of @d lead by the way im personally a 4th lead on a 4th suit forcing bid |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@d direct is weak with @ds but she prefered showing the @ss first and then after a possible 1@s/1NT she could've used XY-NT to 2@d|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Cost 7 imp for just a partscore|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Is there a break or something op?|pg||
nt|ady: guess hearts  needed|pg||
nt|psridhar: Skalman ranked 3rd at 102 VP and Sivves tied for 4th at 94 VP|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psyck: true ...(3@s there)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|runnerup: no |pg||
pc|d5|nt|gmarco24: I'm back again. sry for that|pg||
nt|psridhar: this Bd will reduce that gap significantly|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|yuval10: now a perfect show-up squeeze for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: didn't have the guts|pg||
nt|haans: and endplay died|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: these ladies are not old - so I better use Norwegian next time:)|pg||

mc|9|nt|haans: better to play after :)|pg||
nt|muppe: 3/5 leads are popular in Sweden, as both pair here leads 3/5|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer shd hv inferred that trumps break 5-1 for the X -in view of the 27 HCP with EW; so that 2nd trump play was an error|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: but who will double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by West take out - so now east can dbl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing negative dbl east can dbl (2-3 cards)|pg||
nt|jjsb: i guess its not a clear answer either to double or to bid 2@s just that by double u basically decide to miss the @s fit 5-3 in most cases |pg||
nt|jjsb: i personnaly bid 2@s (but not telling its correct) |pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@c is solid spot|pg||

nt|ianmcc: likely|pg||

nt|gmarco24: J to K, or @c to J, later K@c are winning plays|pg||
nt|ady: might be a problem without a heart lead|pg||
nt|haans: ir clubs still a 9er|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 3-3  not guarantees contract if west gets lead and switches to spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H gf i suppose|pg||
nt|psridhar: can game make ?  i doubt it|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: NS are one of the best women pair in europe, been pdship for man years. Icelandic pair has less experience in international events|pg||
nt|runnerup: this can be a double sving  now 2sp|pg||
nt|bjurn:  another 650|pg||
nt|bagman: Straighforward; W shows his strong playing hand and there's nothing more to add by anyone|pg||
nt|skaftij:  No D, no @s llead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: never liked it bec S can dbl for lead with little points|pg||
nt|haans: before 1@S nt was invite u usually had no bid|pg||
nt|jjsb: 2nt is some kind of ogust relay |pg||
nt|ady: ok   heart lead   no problem|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|psyck: cards well placed here for a few o/t's|pg||
nt|iceking: N with some dubious holdings took the passive view here and didnt compete|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D shows @H|pg||
nt|yuval10: the only way of reaching 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 2@s shouls show a good 3 carder now|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess your guess is as good as any|pg||
nt|haans: do not fight 1nt|pg||
nt|runnerup: aha no double just kidding|pg||
nt|bjurn:  exactly, bid to make|pg||
nt|jwit: Wouldn't double show more values though?|pg||
nt|haans: @HK lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  running scores|pg||
nt|mmmakela: as could here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: and N/S?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: contracts below game aren't interesting enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Dbl = 3 @H|pg||
nt|haans: dbl = 3 spades (sipport doubles more and more popular)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South must have pons - West dbl means points and raise in other suit - East could try a dbl, not a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is very close. With the less than stellar spades I would double|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hawe45:  2 down on a @S-lead, it seems|pg||
nt|mbruun:  I dont mind 5cM for a NT, but a strong suit without the ace is not clear to open 1 NT|pg||
nt|cenglund:  4S is makeable in board 19|pg||
nt|sharkey: this shud make I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: as South denied 4 @s's earlier, the message from 2@s should be clear|pg||
nt|psyck: S has enuf on the auction to make a game try now|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't really understand 3@c from N then, would expect 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: without delay just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: urk|pg||
nt|ianmcc: has a chance|pg||
nt|friggi: N/S as well, this 3@H was ugly|pg||
nt|psridhar: may be the fall of J109 in @h may help set up the 10th trick in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: can be 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H suicide|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Open 2@C and 3NT.|pg||
nt|grebrof: 0-0 after two boards are scored|pg||
nt|jjsb: 3@d should probably give strength information in any way|pg||
nt|jjsb: in any case West seems to like this answer ... |pg||
nt|roswolf: dont see why not the heart suit is favorable|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: wonder if 2@s is game-force or invite|pg||
nt|derric: apparantely latter|pg||
nt|zebutin: hearts are well for declarer, everything else little less so...|pg||
nt|zebutin: lead might give 1 @C trick more|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @h and @c friendly|pg||
nt|gautis2: wd Finland, and they have a great start of this game!|pg||
nt|grebrof: reversing with  a single was not the best idea from Marianne Harding it seems|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd Opinion: shogunng: think so Helle plays woidwood|pg||
nt|diaoff: Excl RKC according to CC|pg||
nt|derric: good morning here then|pg||
nt|gmarco24: woo-hoo!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: easiest a clubs finesse?|pg||
nt|diaoff: Best to play on @H I'd say|pg||
nt|haans: need a lot of thinking|pg||
nt|gmarco24: no slam?  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: we shall see|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump lead?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  In fact, the North hand is no so strong - the @DÂ´s doubtful values|pg||
nt|mbruun:  With no aces you should subtract 1 HCP from the hand. Good intermediates are a plus on the other side|pg||
nt|gautis2: seems like a not agreed auction in OR|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe she wanted to bid 3@h :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure splinters with only 3card support is the best, but I am not playing this event :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Denmark Sweden now are +7.|pg||
nt|grebrof: hi Juho|pg||
nt|haans: Morning or just now Good night for Denmark|pg||
nt|jwit: Depends on NT range. Don't think it is enough for dbl with only spade suit and limited values|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no double??|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: if 4@c instead, they could have possibly landed in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is still making though, so NS did well enough|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1nt-opener didnt know she actually had shown 15-17 already (at the other table)|pg||
nt|haans: may save them|pg||
nt|haans: strong spades in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Phil Clayton|pg||
nt|phil: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Phil|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hi Phil|pg||
nt|haans: Phil u came at a boring deal|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This set is getting interesting, now a question of 2 overtricks|pg||
nt|phil: then I can refill my coffee!|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: actually the most exciting out of the 1st 4|pg||
nt|haans: rite u r|pg||
nt|gmarco24: just don't touch @s and this is -3|pg||
nt|henryb:  This concedes the 9th trick, but not the tenth|pg||
nt|jjsb: u can avoid the 3@s looser i guess but not 2 as i see it and thats enough to defeat this |pg||
nt|jjsb: +1 with henry :) |pg||
nt|muppe: Both pairs play udca, low card being even and encouraging|pg||
nt|psridhar: @d lead better -aiming to hand dummy a ruff before the long @h is set up|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45:  Sure - but the @D-doubleton is not so great|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, clubs depend quite much how you play them that how friendly they are...with this lead they are friendly enough|pg||
nt|mmmakela: oops|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might ruff the diamond or play safe for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K@D and @h now|pg||
nt|jwit: This could be brutal. Heart back. Three rounds of diamonds, then a fourth heart.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K@D to facilitate the counterplay (also if @D is obliged return, better use clear messages|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, discard @H on @D|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gautis2: i m sure it was a "slip of the mind" ..happens to all of us :)|pg||
nt|derric: should've changed to @h:s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  running scores|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mbruun:  Right|pg||
nt|zebutin: and seems 3@H + 2@S + 2@C + @D make enough tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: good lead|pg||
nt|haans: play strait and fast|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|zebutin: though might go after @D|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With highlights in bidding, lead and play :-)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y agree, didn't matter here|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think W was super-optimistic to believe there was a game opposite 9-11|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: Harding have no diamond|pg||
nt|mmmakela: shd play a heart|pg||
nt|derric: to make sure of contract|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|grebrof: where is the @c K?|pg||
nt|psyck: doubling & then cueing is very strong action, so I think 3@c was ok, so has more than enuf with an A & a K to go to game after that i guess|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @c9 short is a help|pg||
nt|friggi: big help|pg||
nt|friggi: @SA and more is the only hope for E-W|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|iceking: 10 tricks for one imp gain for Denmark|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes blind spot|pg||
nt|bagman: the risk being that club ruffed, @HA and another club ruff|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Lirarna missed the game on board 3 in the open room|pg||
nt|bagman: A very low risk and typically one should not throw away an easy overtrick|pg||
nt|jjsb: AK A... but huh yes 4333 is not a must i guess maybe not "proud" of his initial pass?|pg||
nt|ady: though of course north does not know diamonds 3-3  |pg||
pc|cT|nt|derric: 3@D 1@h 2@s 2@c would do too|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|grebrof: @d K - @s ruff|pg||
nt|haans: North may have AQJ in hertas and @DJ but @SQ?|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess if you sum it up, taking the finness in @s was just as goood|pg||
nt|psridhar: but both maj suit lengths in same hand with defenders|pg||
nt|psridhar: so one way or other i guess this will make|pg||
nt|psridhar: few declarers will think of the J109 of @h falling for the 10th trick|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|haans: playing safe|pg||
nt|muppe: W wanted game bonuses being vulnerable.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ianmcc: good switch|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, even with playing on @D makes|pg||
nt|grebrof: for some of us more often than for others|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, you are endplayed if the @s-finesse dont work . N playing a @d to the K in dummy|pg||
nt|grebrof: ace - ace - ace - ace|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and N shd've played spades now|pg||
nt|psridhar: right track that @h play|pg||
nt|psridhar: take a long hard look at that @h jack West :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: must discard a @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or a @d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S+@H!+@C=3 for the defense unless the declarer helps the defense.|pg||
nt|haans: yeah Bide|pg||
nt|henryb:  I want plus scores!|pg||
nt|psridhar: Ace from dummy ; need the small trump for @d ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is certainly a fun hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nubmaster: Yes, no good to just ruff and play ace of @s and then minor cards, S will have a @h left together with a tr|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think South did very well with her hand, to be honest i'd expect N's hand to be AQJX X KTX AKQXX or something like that, then slam is laydown|pg||
nt|haans: plat better than bidding|pg||
nt|derric: luckily for her, north didn't play @SQ|pg||
nt|runnerup: quen even|pg||
nt|jjsb: :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mbruun:  Good Cl 10 to emphasize doubleton spade|pg||
nt|haans: play|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|grebrof: leading trumps was good this time|pg||
nt|psridhar: followed by @d finesse, @h ruff, @d, @d ruff cash top @s claim|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gautis2: tru...that s why we sit here, and dont play there:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|robinswr: this is not a good save. down 500 will gain 4 or 5 imps against a possible 620 . But what there are ruffs and you go for 1100 or worst you can beat 4spades |pg||
pc|dA|nt|derric: interesting switch|pg||
nt|haans: queen are better played after :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ianmcc: undos?|pg||
nt|haans: holy ....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the OR scoe:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer playinng well|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am told he is only 18 years old -very impressive if he brings this one off|pg||
nt|psridhar: i might be tempted to call him a Genius|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yuval10: so maybe even 3@d over 3@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: score @D pass.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: all playing too quickly not pausing to think|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have seen hin play before - he is very good |pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk5: There are other reasons|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h showed more balanced of a hand from North|pg||
nt|yuval10: would've show|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or did it?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|zebutin: seems declarer has gone offroad with this declarer play...|pg||

pc|h9|nt|nubmaster: it will work anyway|pg||

nt|gautis2: cant argue there Roland:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ianmcc: looked a clear 8 tricks |pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess its impossible for us to qualify for this in any circumstances|pg||
nt|diaoff: Yes, that was on dangerous grounds|pg||

nt|grebrof: I guess she led a @d|pg||
nt|grebrof: well played anyway - as kibz suggest - @d A was not a success|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree, S should have opened 2@C. |pg||
nt|haans: bidding it as a NT hand correct for me|pg||
nt|runnerup: luckily only 1 imp out |pg||
nt|haans: playing 1nt not much to think about|pg||
nt|haans: rare for S to have 10 diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: Lirarna got a fool 12 imp (OR)|pg||
nt|robinswr: not even a good matchpoint save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wellone|pg||
nt|jjsb: the 3 nt initial hand is a push |pg||
nt|jjsb: not really a surprise i still believe its not clear to avois that contract sincerely |pg||

mb|1N|nt|hawe45:  When East bids @S - E/W will buy the contract for sure - I hope...|pg||

nt|sharkey: East attempting to interfer|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H would have been natural but 8-11|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps W will just bid 3 NT|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With the favourable lie, 10 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now finally NS can make game in  S's|pg||
nt|haans: nothing here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Not likely to be bid|pg||
nt|ianmcc: North's fast raise to 2@s helped get there|pg||
nt|friggi: in the other room they bidded the gran slamp and made it 7@H....|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the Dealing Gods are on song - another slam|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h needs the @sA onside and little else|pg||

nt|ady: looks onlu a part score for n/s|pg||

nt|roswolf: he likes the challenge|pg||
nt|roswolf: south must not get carried away here|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|hawe45:  6 @S is the right bid from West now|pg||
nt|mbruun:  6 Sp right away to apply pressure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We could play together, Mathisa|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Im a little concerned that I agree with you, about the bidding I mean |pg||
nt|ianmcc: close to a slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S and 5@D are ON with KJ@S in finesse|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt = 4@H and 5+ in a minor|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  7 @S would have been a better bid than 5!|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Very difficult for NS to get to the grand. I predict EW will buy it in 6 S X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But this might work - and West will not "sell out"|pg||
nt|zebutin: more or less clear 4@H... but if they feel bold they might even shoot for 6@H...|pg||
nt|zebutin: which isnt the best contract, but i have been in worse...|pg||
nt|bagman: not so rare for S to have xxx xxxx AKxxxx -|pg||
nt|haans: Stenberg|pg||
nt|bjurn:  @S game here, 6@S is so-so|pg||
nt|haans: a very rare bid nowdays|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H by west probably fix @S|pg||
nt|robinswr: switch the black kings and 4@s goes down|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: tuf to get to game even after drury|pg||
nt|haans: 11-16 in quicker|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 NT focing app|pg||
nt|jbgood: forcing even|pg||
nt|haans: Yes she think so but ...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good jamming bid|pg||
nt|muppe: NS play 13-15 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  - not if South bids 7 @C now, Mathias...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: must be odds-on|pg||
nt|iceking: another drury hand|pg||
nt|psyck: S likes hand better after opps bid @s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in the contrary, most intriguing contract to play and defend very often|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@C minimum|pg||
nt|haans: often min|pg||
nt|haans: most be natural 2nt :(|pg||
nt|peachy: S decided to show his spades, in a 5-card major system I prefer 2H, hand is not strong enough to try for anything|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i guess it will be another partial|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C rebid  transfer to diamonds?|pg||
nt|haans: if 2@C gazzilli A have a problem|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3N may make|pg||
nt|roswolf: the dbl sounds a warning bell|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mbruun:  Impressive|pg||
nt|mbruun:  West knows 7 Sp is good insurance, but always difficult to save in a hot aucton like this. She should do it right I think  |pg||
nt|zebutin: 3@S most likely splinter of some sort, Pia might like her hand now because only Axxx in @S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: trump 2 @s and lose a diaamond|pg||
nt|haans: dont like that 2NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: EW getting very exited here :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: hmm, some play something like that or 13-17 in carrot club still...havent seen that working too well... :)|pg||
nt|haans: Multi was biggest at the 80th but still on in Scandinavia|pg||
nt|jjsb: wow ... what is the nt range?|pg||
nt|jjsb: oh ok |pg||
nt|haans: S have a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Well done all around|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From Wests point of view, 7 @S might cost about 500 only - with more @C by East|pg||
nt|gautis2: good result for Norway OR. .. seems hard with heart lead?|pg||
nt|zebutin: sorry, private|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anybody overcall 1 NT with East hand?|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H big accident|pg||
nt|mmmakela: u all bid 2 dias as W? |pg||

nt|haans: interesting deal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: it worked|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C to make them bid once more|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: in the open room, thhe norwegian 1nt opening showing (8)9-12hp|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: in MP yes IMP no|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C min better than normal Jacoby|pg||
nt|haans: transfer taken serious|pg||
nt|gmarco24: surprise|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: Gib says it makes..I have to get MORE coffee:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: their cc says multilandy, so i guess 2 NT asked for the minor..|pg||
nt|haans: blood|pg||
nt|rnmalik: pass and trouble:)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@D game try, or slam try here|pg||
nt|haans: singel or asking for singel|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Norths 9's and 10's in major really pull their weight|pg||
nt|haans: more interesting|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 1@c-16+|pg||
nt|muppe: That explains S's pass.|pg||
nt|jjsb: so we know they will not play game :) |pg||
nt|henryb:  North does not X 2@s?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I presume X of 2@h showed @h and high card values|pg||
nt|jjsb: 2@d some kind of multi?|pg||
nt|haans: they have 110 or 140 so good MP|pg||
nt|gmarco24: many would bid 3@h over 3@c with singleton @c|pg||
pc|h6|nt|derric: pessimistic|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@H very agressive and will catch perfect dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: that made S's choice easier, esp with vul game at stake|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Mikael G told me that the operator is new and are in training so we will have some allowance here... and she has no time to comment|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Heart lead is the killer|pg||
nt|grebrof: the small cards in dummy makes it easier to overtake the Q too, cause there are many layout where N will have a @h-suit good enough for it to run later|pg||
nt|gautis2: as I can see, I am agree..|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, but S should have though little more about it|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be difficult to beat with the club position as it is|pg||
nt|psridhar: can 4@s make if E doesnt overtake @c king and hand a @c ruff?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  No RD, please, that would loose 2 IMPÂ´s to 2140|pg||
nt|zebutin: well trumps cant be too badly, and with diamond lead neither can any other suits either so has enough entries&etc|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Sry, not Mikael, it was his dad, Johan who told me :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 3@H I think|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@S needs heart K onside and hearts 3-3, 4-2 or J singleton; it is clearly under 50% and thus should not be bid|pg||
nt|bagman: In case NS need desperately a swing the slam would be good :)|pg||
nt|haans: cue mandatory to show cue below game|pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @D lead more aggressive and effective|pg||
nt|skaftij:   800|pg||
nt|robinswr: i agree. support partner asap is my motto|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d presumably showed 1 major|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  One @H-trick might "disappear" here|pg||
nt|haans: in a good day acceptable|pg||
nt|skaftij:  500|pg||
nt|haans: blood from nowhere|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it can|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|haans: not @DA or @HK|pg||
nt|bjurn:  42%-ish, vul, might be an options but it's too early in the match IMO|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just overtricks|pg||
nt|haans: Operatoer was 2@C transfer?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3 red winners in N hand for 3 @c pitches|pg||
nt|psridhar: the way to tell pd that it is stiff @C is to CASH @d ace|pg||
nt|psridhar: first |pg||
nt|psridhar: before the @c play|pg||
nt|roswolf: to beat need to play @D ace then @C a spec states|pg||
pc|h5|nt|derric: trumps 4-1 and @c:s 4-2?|pg||
nt|grebrof: my style is 1@d last hand too - if P cant answer 1@d, you rarely have any game|pg||
nt|haans: jack lead?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: can't go wrong here on any line|pg||
nt|muppe: North is thinkin that 2NT was lebensohl?|pg||
nt|henryb:  what a mixup!|pg||
nt|jjsb: oooppsss a discusion after the game so... |pg||
nt|jjsb: or we do have a fun operator? |pg||
nt|psridhar: yes  it is a defensive technique popular|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: the (persumably ) weak NT in the OR made many problems to the Swede pair|pg||
nt|haans: yes yout style is my style 2 but not with @CK singel|pg||
nt|robinswr: partner will not know that you have three hearts if the auction goes 1@h 1@s 2@d 2@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club by declarer now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: maybe he thought he was a fraction too good for 2 @H|pg||
nt|robinswr:   I wrote an article on that subject http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202008-02.aspx|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: AKQxxx Jx xxx xx would make the slam better|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|phil: 500 looks likely as long as the defense doesnt stub their toe|pg||
nt|friggi: did not finnes!?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: as long as he takes this|pg||
nt|henryb:  Grahs must be thinking Christmas comes in June|pg||
nt|jjsb: that is not a good result for NS............ scary one ...|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|gmarco24: even ducking twice would squeeze W pretty much in three suits, so one discard of @h will follow|pg||
nt|psridhar: as it is E can see his pd has stiff @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: since 1N was opened|pg||
pc|sA|nt|zebutin: something like that most likely is enough|pg||
nt|derric: the @HJT help a lot|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but no guarantess that east has the ace|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hawe45:  @H-shift is important - otherwise only 800|pg||
nt|haans: a make now|pg||
nt|haans: @C3 = count even|pg||
nt|phil: declarer's shape is known then|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jbgood: Norway went down in 6 @d in OR|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mbruun:  North will have to cash AK now otherwise she will be endplayed|pg||
nt|bagman: When E wins the @HK the auction tells that he must switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|bagman: w|pg||
nt|bjurn:  unless E decides to lead @H|pg||
nt|bagman: Easts spade trick cannot run away but a diamond trick can|pg||
nt|haans: E do have a natural lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|grebrof: well played so far|pg||
nt|bjurn:  N's failure to cuebid @Ds might encourage him to lead @DA|pg||
nt|bagman: E has an easy @CQ lead; N might win a spade and immediately take the heart finesse with @HQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mbruun:  Good stop at the other table on board 4 to bring Denmark in the match|pg||
nt|derric: now just needs help with the diamonds to escape -200|pg||
pc|s6|nt|grebrof: 8 tricks|pg||
nt|grebrof: or?|pg||
nt|grebrof: lol|pg||
nt|grebrof: the @c-suit will provide the 9th|pg||
nt|gautis2: in that case, a 10imps pickup to Norway...|pg||
nt|grebrof: its a 1imp-pickup|pg||
nt|grebrof: claimtime|pg||
nt|gautis2: 1?|pg||
nt|gautis2: what coffee do u drink in thailand? :)|pg||
nt|haans: time for endplay|pg||
nt|mmmakela: all shd be clear|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: yes I think so |pg||
nt|haans: ty |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ianmcc: should take @sK then hook @c|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he is afraid of Q@c lose to K, @d switch|pg||
nt|ianmcc: what other option?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: A@c, @c  maybe, dunno|pg||
nt|friggi: I agree|pg||
nt|friggi: he has ti play W for the outstanding honors|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: was hard to believe|pg||
pc|c5|nt|skaftij:  actually, they get 800 now |pg||
nt|phil: yes I guess they do|pg||
nt|haans: @C4 lavinthal = hearts|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|iceking: at this vul i think W had to be tempted go for 300 or so in 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: off 1 I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: it looks like trump lead beats 2@h by 3 , but defense allowed declarer to score 2 more tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: attack in clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: don't see any help coming.:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: this has no hope :)|pg||
nt|derric: yes, majors can be lead for many rounds still|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much in play: N takes the heart finesse with the Q and tries to set up the 5th heart|pg||
nt|gmarco24: we know he can't really go wrong|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: Noth may be void in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: a1c|pg||
nt|skaftij:  blood blood blood we loves it!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: not the right moment to play @hQ. Duck one round|pg||
nt|sharkey: now off 2|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and after winning with @cQ, @hQ and another|pg||
nt|bagman: The worse line is to take double finesse in hearts requireing KJ onside|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm declarer has lost her way|pg||
nt|psridhar: now 1s return and down|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  Nice to see Nadia ruff "high" here...!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mbruun:  North is punished from that little slip|pg||
nt|jjsb: i am asked about where the mistake is .. its hard to be precise here |pg||
nt|muppe: Yes, these are partnership understandins.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the first mistake was that N did not double 2@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  But the real question is "What did South's double of 2@h show?"|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  Nadia proved, that she is comning from the famous Blaksets Bridgecenter - by ruffing high...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  coming|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|iceking: very strong result 620 here |pg||
pc|c4|nt|gmarco24: @h discard indicates both K at W maybe|pg||
pc|d3|nt|phil: well judged I think|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|grebrof: theres a lot of crap, I can tell you|pg||
nt|henryb:  If it showed hearts and values, which I think it should, then N should either double 2@s or bid 3@h over 2@s|pg||
pc|d2|nt|grebrof: its the worst feeling to have as a player : you know your result is bad - well, they have 17imps so far|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mmmakela: wow|pg||
nt|jjsb: dont we all agree about card with @h in this case? can it be something else ? Sandberg disagree apparently on this meaning yes.. |pg||
nt|muppe: Best to have some sort of agreement to avoid this kin of disasters|pg||
nt|jjsb: dotn se any clear reason why double of 2@h then 2nt shows minors yes... |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|grebrof: "impossible" discards in Es mind|pg||
nt|psridhar: needles risk -shd hv cashed @c ace |pg||
nt|roswolf: -2 on a heart|pg||
mc|8|nt|iceking: now will cash aq of @C and last trick on @D 7|pg||
nt|skaftij:  not by poor East :-)|pg||

nt|vugraphzdq: now the director is here again to discuss the last case|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s lead with @h K in return would have been better I guess (if declarer lets the @s win)|pg||
nt|gautis2: yepp ..that s true christer|pg||
nt|gautis2: I bet XX u would not return @h K after spade lead from partner Espen:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: it isnt that long ago that a match between Norway and Italy had directors flying around all the time (understandably in some cases) - but I guess gautis know more about these when ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: it comes to "grumpiness" :)|pg||
nt|haans: pen double of 1nt?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Nothing exciting it seems, more coffee|pg||
nt|fabsayc: somehow we missed some relevant issues :)|pg||

nt|henryb:  down 1?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Steve Robinson|pg||
nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|ady: not much on here|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt and Stayman|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be feisty|pg||
mb|1S|nt|derric: good 4@s|pg||
nt|zebutin: Erkkilä&Ahonen have 4@S, but they must bid it first|pg||
nt|ianmcc: should be flat|pg||
nt|runnerup: no way to get imps in these |pg||
nt|haans: no action|pg||
nt|bjurn:  so, out of the five first deals 4@S has been a make 5 times :)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  making this is a ground breaking deal |pg||
nt|ady: hi all     sorry    late arriving|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ralfwil: lucky 4@s here on EW|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  A sporty 3 NT N/S here|pg||
nt|zebutin: double or overcall?|pg||
nt|derric: overcall for me|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe a simple 4@h p/c by W now|pg||
nt|nubmaster: We'll propably se some action here|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In Open EW made a wrong decision to sacrifice vs 5@h but didn't get it doubled which is really difficult|pg||
nt|haans: 1NTx ido not give game score|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Pass: 0-7/17+|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi david|pg||
nt|robinswr: makes it difficult for north|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and welcome back to Fredrik Alfredsson|pg||

nt|haans: rare overcall|pg||
mb|3H|nt|zebutin: i must confess i would have just bid 1@S...|pg||
nt|zebutin: even though hand is good|pg||
nt|bagman: E's 2nd pass confirming 0-7 :)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1@D neb 11-13 NT or @Ds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now we all agree 4c oc?|pg||
nt|ady: hi Raijja|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: east went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is ok is suppose, but not consistent with what we saw before|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so dbl w min values?|pg||
nt|affe82:  thx! hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: science i approve|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cenglund:  Not so far-fetched play given the bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: I frequently played 1nt XX when playing weak nts|pg||
nt|phil: can't imagining passing the East hand|pg||
nt|phil: (imagine)|pg||
nt|haans: Törnqvist had no opening :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Really?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: not so good methods here for ew. |pg||
nt|haans: right, double in my book not hearts|pg||
nt|ianmcc: West loved that opening|pg||
nt|friggi: no problem now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: claim 10|pg||
nt|gmarco24: once you are in 3nt this board is getting uninteresting :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@s makes north guess and with a club lead he guessed wrong|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iceking: for sure W should decl with his holding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 4@c from W = bid your suit under, and contract on the strong hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, some play 4@c |pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead needed I think|pg||
nt|haans: big think No opening|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I'd open without the @c jack|pg||
nt|gmarco24: uninteresting  |pg||
nt|robinswr: i like to lead aces against slams|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  If West finds the killing lead, they will call the police|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Will make in practice|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 1@s could be passed out (but I agree)|pg||
nt|derric: partner is likely to raise on any 3+ support|pg||
nt|iceking: ofcourse that would be more normal |pg||
nt|iceking: with everything breaking nicely this should make |pg||
nt|gautis2: this seems like a flat boars..  this time I almost bet I m right:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2 last hands are rather routine|pg||
nt|haans: 1NTx pquite playable|pg||
nt|jjsb: note that when this happen u are not suppose to discuss with partner .. its nto the moment .. u can go to toilet to put some fresh water on face sure but definitely not the moment ...|pg||
nt|jjsb: to discus |pg||
nt|gmarco24: 3nt depends on @s finesse|pg||
nt|gmarco24: an it's in|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: Another of those easy 4@S|pg||
nt|grebrof: it often is|pg||
nt|jjsb: and therefore to criticize on any way|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d again looks like a good contract|pg||
nt|jjsb: a lot of board to be played |pg||
nt|jjsb: + u dont know what happen other table ...|pg||
nt|muppe: i think u agree how you play the situation the rest of match and then you move on.|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: its the same contract again - so, I would go for a norwegian 1IMP reward :D|pg||
nt|haans: EW 3@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no is a matter of combining 4 card overcalls with major oriented doubles|pg||
nt|friggi: -1|pg||
nt|ianmcc: must fail - South won't fail to make @cA|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|haans: and hearts 4-3|pg||
nt|affe82:  a good bid. hard to get the msg across otherwise. a bit unlucky.|pg||
nt|affe82:  might he consider another cashing black ace?|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe 5@H would have bid a better bid|pg||
nt|robinswr: shows a stronger hand than 4@h|pg||
nt|robinswr: asks partner to make the last mistake|pg||
nt|affe82:  sure. or 4@s and then 5@h|pg||
nt|affe82:  but not sure that they will have time to negotiate the best level and it will help the one on lead|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@s makes the opponents guess. I know on bad days you go for 800|pg||
nt|robinswr: if the vul was reversed, you'd bid 4@s|pg||
nt|affe82:  another view is that 6@h might miss a cold grand. just turn the black queens into the ace of @c|pg||
nt|haans: By 2@S overcall BOOK win the board|pg||
nt|psridhar: Warne will lead @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt may not survive if east leads the shorter major|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: still time to switch|pg||
nt|bagman: E makes his normal lead and down goes the contract|pg||
nt|bagman: S now wishing that he had autosplinter 3 @S in the system|pg||
nt|bjurn:  E led his longest and strongest, good enough :)|pg||
nt|bagman: And North too|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@d horrible at these colours|pg||
nt|haans: often used in sweden Asptro|pg||
nt|skaftij:  with passed PD|pg||
nt|mmmakela: lead dir is very important in teams also so once the chance.....|pg||
nt|ady: south double some risk   north could not double for penalties in that position  so south balancing with shortish spades|pg||
nt|haans: and many use N double as take-out|pg||
nt|psridhar: @h bcos one lead sets the suit up -not so in @s|pg||
pc|h5|nt|skaftij:  easily 500 |pg||
nt|haans: looks more like Astro|pg||
pc|h6|nt|derric: though some pass all 7-counts opposite overcall|pg||
nt|haans: Trust and hope: shogunng: 6di|pg||

nt|friggi: anything else is poker:)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: agree - discards no use to East hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|zebutin: mostly matter of partnership agreements and individual bidding style|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mbruun:  With 9 HCP partner is weak, so heart is more natural in teams. Partner cant have a strong spade holding|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: all would have passed 2@Sx at MP|pg||
nt|ady: yes    I am not in favour   some times partner is alould to have a poor hand  amd this  sort of re-opening can  be expensive|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck:  will play @h 1st & can fin @s into safe hand later if reqd|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h is automatic in trick 2 in order to take out a possible entry to E's hand|pg||
nt|diaoff: Norway will need some other kind of boards now|pg||
nt|haans: Denmark have taken 16*2 IMP|pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl has to lead something everytime endplayed - not always good to dbl with bal hand and no suit to really attack with|pg||
nt|mmmakela: how can that be right?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean club shift?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont know|pg||
nt|robinswr: looking at the doubleton diamonds, seems a trump shift is called for|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nubmaster: continue with ace of @c now for a push?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|iceking: bidding in open room was like we were talking about|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  4+@S 4+other (normally longer other); 2M = NAT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cenglund:  Still down|pg||
nt|jjsb: nothing fancy happen here so @d 22 and @c 43 is just enough to make that contract safe |pg||
nt|henryb:  otherwise lose two club tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yuval10: hi Joe|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|psyck:  Hi Joe|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: wasn´t this finess a big risk?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, don't understand @d fin|pg||
nt|sharkey: y - @S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: He may have led the @HA  as well ... sometimes they have @HK singleton|pg||
pc|d3|nt|zebutin: nothing much in play...@S J on the road and hope for best|pg||
nt|gautis2: In the other match, Sweden is in front of Denmark..This is a exiting group!  ..  as we speak it is 2Vp from 1st to 3rd place:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: hard to see them get that 1 IMP, but ...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  12 tricks on a squeeze in the hard suits|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is no good defense however|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well anytihng but a  club|pg||
nt|ady: cash A@H    and a 3rd diamond|pg||
nt|robinswr: not east can get a heart ruff|pg||
nt|robinswr: now|pg||
nt|ady: problem is heart will be discarded from dummy|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, ofc|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 4@h E can get short trumped badly; and 4@s has 2 trump losers , so any + score here good for EW|pg||
pc|h7|nt|grebrof: been a lot of contracs with shortness in declarers suit today - not always the best|pg||
nt|friggi: that was not good move|pg||
pc|s7|nt|friggi: cost nothing to play @S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: and get a ruff|pg||
pc|c2|nt|derric: faster claim this time?|pg||
nt|zebutin: counting tricks before claim?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|iceking: well if its wrong N would need to cash @H ace that is possible not clear for north|pg||
nt|haans: been boring this far|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: big board for Norway - shud be an easy set I think|pg||

nt|cenglund:  I can't understand S's reasoning. The board is like an open book|pg||
nt|haans: @HK Big|pg||
nt|runnerup: really action boards ..he he..|pg||
nt|bjurn:  this wont be a push|pg||
nt|jwit: 3NT NS.  Not that easy to bid|pg||
nt|ady: best game for e/w 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: it was a short break, but now everyone is back from bathroom etc|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so what to do over 1@H opener|pg||
nt|gmarco24: we are all waiting that slams to see!|pg||
nt|gmarco24: who's been shuffling these boards??  :)|pg||
nt|haans: or a good double for 800|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so we need a good overbid first?|pg||
nt|affe82:  and the non-exploring way proved its worth|pg||
nt|psridhar: very interesting set of deals|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult bd to predict|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: sometimes running your winners will squeese your opponents - can be a good strategy even if you dont have enough tricks to begin with too|pg||
nt|sharkey: N shud hardly have Ax in @C as wud overtake and return 1. trick|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: 1@S 17+|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D|pg||
nt|haans: hard fight here|pg||
nt|haans: Opening weaker and weaker (aceless hand 11 hcp)|pg||
nt|haans: openers have gone down for 50 years|pg||
nt|haans: easy 3nt|pg||
nt|jwit: 20 opposite 4|pg||
nt|haans: people neber pass|pg||
nt|henryb:  not quite enough to make slam on a heart lead, but cold on anything else|pg||
nt|muppe: NS makes 6@s without @h lead|pg||
nt|muppe: 1NT= 13-15|pg||
nt|gmarco24: or, it's better to say bad overbid|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT as the lay    but unlikely to play there|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: Potential for some action, yes|pg||
nt|haans: not all just overcall|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and bad game|pg||
nt|affe82:  it's a guess for Aldeborg but it sure hurts, even worse when the lead was the correct one|pg||
nt|haans: easy 3nt :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: what to bid on Johanssons 2@H ?|pg||
nt|gautis2: 500 is a good score.. 4@h seems like few loosers, but not enough winners?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can they bid the slam?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 0-7|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 3@S with good guess in trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless EW score a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|bjurn:  I must confess that I would've opened souths hand as well, at least in a strong club system|pg||
nt|haans: most can take a beating withouy being punch-drunk or they would not play Swedish Teams|pg||
nt|henryb:  be tough to find a heart from W hand|pg||
nt|ady: may get to 5@D  which shoudl fail|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rnmalik: EW have good play for 4@S.|pg||
nt|ady: club lead   though may mean defeat    2 ruffs A@D   ace of trumps|pg||
nt|robinswr: i don't like doubling with a singleton spade|pg||
nt|robinswr: he played north to bid a slam off three aces|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should compete|pg||
nt|psridhar: bold balancing finds the @h fit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ianmcc: 3@d|pg||
nt|iceking: should have no problems stop in 4@H here|pg||
nt|psyck: 5 level is safe too i guess|pg||
nt|iceking: would be good to have 3@H forcing here |pg||
nt|nubmaster: If 2NT shows the red suits why not start with 4@h and then 5@d? But N took it for the minors because of the fact that the 1@c opening is 2+?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3-3 to paly here|pg||
nt|haans: Big Clubs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a quiet 3NT here|pg||
nt|roswolf: despite the soft minor values|pg||
mb|2H|nt|grebrof: I guess without the @s lead, you can possibly make some @d-tricks, but|pg||
nt|haans: system works well here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - think they'll bid slam|pg||
nt|haans: but Blackwwod a problem = 2 keys missing|pg||
nt|haans: urp|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes|pg||
nt|jwit: agree|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now maybe 1nt-3nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok S taking slow road|pg||
nt|affe82:  might be NS can gather some momentum if E thinks to much about chances gone by|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4@S not doubled Optimal contract|pg||
nt|diaoff: Expected a Dbl there, yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: must start on @d at once to win this - and use @d to pull S's 4th trump - very difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: lucky that N has all the aces|pg||
nt|jbgood: club ace with S and the contract would stand no chance on best def|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well this one at least looks like an opening(almost?)|pg||
nt|haans: all you can say is URKKK|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@C game try in spades with 4@Ss|pg||
nt|haans: yes most of us would|pg||
nt|bagman: W likely to lead @CQ or a low heart|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not so easy call 3N|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
nt|phil: believe your pard or believe your opps? |pg||
nt|haans: what rare choices|pg||
nt|skaftij:  not the ideal hand by North to bid 4 card M|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont like overcalling with 21 count|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@s shows this hand over a takeout double|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 17+|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, no fun a all|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 1@d=12-13 bal or... or...|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: and that is logical if bypass @D with marginal canape hands|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h will now be frcd after 4th suit bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but 4@d will also do and after 4@h = no @s control|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Forcing?|pg||
nt|gautis2: this play will take sometime..belive me:)|pg||
nt|derric: 2@d = Gf 5+@d4M|pg||
nt|bjurn:  might try @DT|pg||
nt|bjurn:  :)|pg||
nt|haans: good lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 NT who wd pass as E not holding 6|pg||
nt|phil: I love my hand for 1@h x'd - doubleton trump and some working cards|pg||
nt|robinswr: x/AKQxxxxx/KJx/xx is not a slam bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Denmark gained 7 IMP on board 5, because South unblocked her AK of hearts in due time, so 7 Sp X was five off|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a happy spot|pg||
nt|zebutin: well no double... seems like 2 down or something|pg||
nt|grebrof: I assume the 5 from E|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they play count when Q is at the table|pg||
nt|gautis2: not best lead.. may make now|pg||
nt|haans: yep 0-7 is 0-7|pg||
nt|haans: nope harder to pass 2nt|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club did cost here|pg||
nt|phil: why should 1N be any better? |pg||
nt|phil: or 2@c? |pg||
nt|mmmakela: more club tricks|pg||
nt|haans: Markku have a point :)|pg||
nt|phil: I dont remember my partner showing clubs with a 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|phil: but maybe its part of a system :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Because your @d Queen will not be ruffed and you have delivered your hand|pg||
nt|haans: they do not present best bridge ever :)|pg||
nt|jjsb: practical bid ... not quite sure i like it though(not saying u should not go to slam) |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jwit: Not at all an unexpected result|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt-3nt (natural)|pg||
nt|affe82:  got a point there|pg||
nt|affe82:  a solid one|pg||
nt|haans: anything but 3nt down|pg||
nt|ady: got to 4-3 spade fit    but bad split should put paid to that|pg||
nt|haans: We have a second opinion: runnerup: 5d makes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|iceking: so 3@H and now S will deny @S control so should end in 4@H|pg||
nt|iceking: Danish que-bidding style is though little odd at least i have never understood it|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S shows interest in slam perhaps N shud be able to bid it based on @H length and max|pg||
nt|grebrof: Magic Diamond comes from Sweden originally, but many play it in  Finland too - they are more artificial in Sweden-Finland than we are in Norway-Denmark - I have myself sat down ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: that 1@c meant either a) 5-11hp any suit or b) 17hp+ any distribution - conventions like that are not allowed in Norway, but it is fun, isnt it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: East are at the bathroom|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The play of the Finnish ladies has been mildly put rather sloppy|pg||
nt|haans: i do assume they would not bid 1@H with A+K|pg||
nt|grebrof: when do you get to go, Johanna?|pg||
nt|haans: 52% slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be S or N shud have made more efforts here....|pg||
pc|dK|nt|iceking: undo|pg||
nt|gautis2: ..but a fair normal lead|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Spade must be attacked otherwise diamonds will be established|pg||
nt|grebrof: curiousity is always there with AK in a suit|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt played by East please|pg||
nt|bagman: Hopes to score a ruff and two spades :9|pg||
nt|jwit: Even without big club, not clear to bid with South hand opposite a 2NT opener.  4-4 in majors might sway South to bid, but still far from clear cut.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|psyck: we see what you mean Magnus :)|pg||
nt|iceking: so 3@S could maybe ask for @S control |pg||
nt|iceking: Danish asking bid i think they call it|pg||
nt|gautis2: God have given u an ace for one reason...take it!|pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: that card was meant for entry to dummy...|pg||
nt|diaoff: Needed that entry I'm afraid|pg||
nt|haans: ok Stayman first|pg||
nt|robinswr: he could have overcalled 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: 11 tricks |pg||
nt|jjsb: just saying we migth not want theoraclly to play it with 2 immediate loosers in @h maybe ?|pg||
nt|affe82:  what happened here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Vs landy trump lead is prescribed but here declarer may still come to 8 via 3 trumps tricks and 4 @s tricks in addition the @c ace|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: can not make Blackwood|pg||
nt|diaoff: You're faster :), but now it makes again|pg||
nt|jbgood: ok - no duck and no dinner:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: but it aint over yet|pg||
nt|haans: ok goes this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Johan Wahlberg|pg||
nt|wahlis:  Hi|pg||
nt|friggi: hi|pg||
nt|ady: we can make 5@D from here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mbruun:  Difficult lead for West, and DK is natural but unfortunate|pg||
nt|iceking: dont try this at home folks :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: never , I can't leave my chair :)|pg||
nt|derric: maybe if S was gonna open, try 1NT|pg||
nt|haans: low @D = lavinthal for clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: S was unlikely to guess the trumps anyhow but the ruff makes sure of beating this|pg||
nt|gmarco24: communication play in @s. risking stiff Q@s offside, winning fourth Q@s inside|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cenglund:  This is capitulation|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I would be proud of my cards as dummy sitting South|pg||
nt|phil: yes|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this looking a bit better|pg||
nt|gmarco24: welcome Johan|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi Johan|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no swings this set|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 7@c is entry creating maneuver|pg||
nt|henryb:  A couple of kibitzers asked whether E should double 2@h; X of 2@h should suggest values as well as @h: invitation for partner to contest the partial|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks and next....|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like ew 1nt without this mini opening so some imps |pg||
pc|h6|nt|mbruun:  Nice layout for declarer|pg||
nt|muppe: I think the double of 2@h was out of question without values.|pg||
nt|ady: might make 4@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: and 13 tricks - next|pg||
nt|iceking: ok 3@S was here some slam potential without shortness|pg||
nt|grebrof: hard to see any reason for the trumpshift|pg||
nt|ady: bidding a little odd    first content with 2@C 2nd time around  non forcing  and when parttners shows a weak hand with long spades gets bettwer and goes to 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense interesting, south has to win second club, cash spade ace and exit in clubs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|iceking: so in a way they didnt know @S quebid was on or missing |pg||
nt|haans: 2Queens + 10 10 10|pg||
nt|mmmakela: IF E PASSES 1 @H D(and seems sane) I would never pass but bid 1 NT|pg||
nt|friggi: take @SK to hold them down to 10|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cenglund:  Even spade shift may not be enough to set the contact|pg||
nt|haans: i dont understand his pass|pg||
nt|robinswr: if my partner made a t/o double i would insist on playing in spades with the east hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gautis2: as long @h K stiff, I think this was home after lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s-shift - and then?|pg||
nt|gautis2: dia|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok, bang down @h A and small @c later from W|pg||
nt|grebrof: or another @s|pg||
nt|gautis2: cant get another @s from W...just borned with one :)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Trump lead might help|pg||
nt|gautis2: that s true|pg||
nt|runnerup: finnish ladys found a better fit 4-3 |pg||
nt|jwit: 2 queens not nearly as good as an ace.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|grebrof: yes, but small @c AND a new @s is a monster - maybe|pg||
nt|ady: what did you want west to do after south opening?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: agree |pg||
nt|robinswr: i would probably have overcalled 2@c|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ianmcc: It will make soon|pg||
nt|haans: agree to that|pg||
nt|jwit: 4-4 in majors might make it worthwhile to try Stayman|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: now it is|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still not enough to win the board...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can't go wrong such is the placement of cards.|pg||
nt|phil: North's? |pg||
nt|robinswr: this is one bidding system that i have never seen|pg||
nt|affe82:  me neither|pg||
nt|haans: few entries to dummy|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|haans: bit Q + 10?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i'm not sure EW can bring this one to only +1 after @h lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: didnt win the 9 spot?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm methinks the 9 won|pg||
nt|roswolf: but the contract will make|pg||
nt|psridhar: and declarer didnt release the @s queen...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|skaftij:  I don't understand NORTHS pass|pg||
nt|affe82:  is 1@d supposed to be alerted in some fashion?|pg||
nt|ady: yes    problem|pg||
pc|dT|pc|cT|nt|ianmcc: should have taken one pitch|pg||
nt|derric: back to down 2 if win this and a trump|pg||
nt|ralfwil:  no 12|pg||
nt|grebrof: trump lead might be the killer, yes|pg||
nt|haans: utp again|pg||
nt|jbgood: big numbers all over the place|pg||
nt|jbgood: 990 OR|pg||
nt|skaftij:  second chance to bid 1NT|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|derric: or trump after @HJ|pg||
nt|zebutin: or is it even 3 down now|pg||
nt|derric: correct|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 300|pg||
nt|jwit: Better play it better in 3 lol|pg||
nt|haans: one reason to bid after 2nt is that 2nt may be down as well |pg||
nt|jwit: 20 opposite 4 generally doesn't play anywhere near as well as 12 opposite 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree|pg||
nt|haans: again u are rite|pg||
nt|ady: down 1|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: :(|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jbgood: making here and 9 imps away...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S Ace please.|pg||
nt|derric: lucky since in both rooms south could equally well hold 2-5-2-4|pg||
nt|haans: and endplay|pg||
pc|s7|nt|phil: I think 1@h created the issues; not the pass later|pg||
nt|haans: I do not understand South first pass|pg||
nt|skaftij:  big risk being caught|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west made a good play, countering my defense|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|zebutin: other room got to stop in 2@D just made, so nice pick up for finns|pg||
nt|zebutin: if doesnt play 3 round spades, might be even more down|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @H back and @H through|pg||
nt|derric: possibility of -4 after this pause for thought|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: open layout leads to 3nt making here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|runnerup: east missed to take her d ace|pg||
nt|affe82:  ok so i am told that 1@d shows 12-16 with a 5- suit in @d/@h/@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What is this system called?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I have never seen it|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|phil: there just doesnt seem to be much upside overcalling on @hAJ87|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I agree with both of Souths passes, but there you go|pg||
nt|phil: me too|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3@d had good chances tho only 8 tricks other table|pg||
nt|iceking: ok they did know when north bypassed 3nt he denied @S control. Like i said very complicated que-bidding style in Denmark|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, this match isnt over yet - as it normally isnt after 7 boards|pg||
nt|gautis2: think u re right Espen:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: now the director is here again, to get the result of the case on board 2|pg||
nt|robinswr: i have to go now enjoyed commenting|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|h8|nt|psyck: a bit overboard other table|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes bad def for push|pg||
mc|8|nt|psridhar: the @d 10 made the 8th trick here; Asplund may hv been tested on trump lead|pg||

nt|yuval10: finally an interesting one|pg||
nt|diaoff: Its a tough game...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this one looks dangerous|pg||
nt|bjurn:  a chance for Lirarna to earn some overtrick IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: Here NS can make 460 in notrumps to score 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|skaftij:  blood blood ahhh|pg||
nt|mmmakela: agree but if pd decided to do so , bidding tells u shd bid 1 NT|pg||
nt|friggi: when he ha full control|pg||
nt|muppe: It shouls show values as the hand coul easily be yours (their 1NT openig was 13-15)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: who said we will see a game here?|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|hawe45:  Yes  - but after a slow start|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This looks like a coffee-board for 420 N/S|pg||
nt|mbruun:  4 Sp seems to be the spot, and its a very natural contract|pg||
nt|psyck: they have to be careful not to get too high here with cards unfav|pg||
nt|haans: but is no ace|pg||
nt|gmarco24: agree Fridrik|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: prefer 3nt to 5@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  It should show values whatever the 1N range|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C?|pg||
nt|psridhar: over a strong club opening std tech is to PASS that N hand first and then bid later if given a chance....conventionally it shows a big hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 2@D most likely multi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks with open cards|pg||
nt|iceking: slam makes |pg||
nt|haans: not more than 3@S|pg||
nt|haans: 1NT-3NT?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sorry misspeek|pg||
nt|bjurn:  South wont be able to find @HK with North|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT is clearly better than 5m as there are 9+ top tricks and nobody can ruff any of the winners|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/AdeborgKarlsson.pdf|pg||
nt|affe82:  it's some sort of precision|pg||
nt|affe82:  which allows systematic 9-12 openings|pg||
nt|haans: that was a weeeeeeeeeeek opening|pg||
nt|ady: part score again|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nubmaster: In open the Icelandic ended up in 5@d|pg||
nt|ianmcc: another partial|pg||
nt|psridhar: with Warne bereft of high cards the kid will have to show restraint :)   ( too much to expect ? )|pg||
nt|roswolf: east sighs since he knows his likely fate|pg||
mb|1S|nt|zebutin: Johansson has many quick tricks in hand, so didnt want to bid lame 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: or east could maybe dbl 3@D here |pg||
nt|jbgood: Norway had a bye last round - seems like they have problems adjusting to playing again...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what a hand, a nightmare:)|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S a make|pg||
nt|bagman: As the auction tempoed, 3NT is nearly impossible to reach|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also if 2@H isn't forcing north will raise with KQx and a sgl out|pg||
nt|haans: NS bid minors reverse|pg||
nt|ady: e/w already way overboard|pg||
mb|2D|nt|iceking: 3@D looks alot down 5-6 down|pg||
nt|derric: would you bid the south hand?|pg||
nt|haans: good question what does Pass show now|pg||
nt|haans: 6@C+1@S+1@S+1@H?|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes h lead lets this home|pg||
nt|mmmakela: spade J lead anyone?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D|pg||
nt|ady: west got a good result    looking at the 2 hands 3NT does not look so good|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ?+??|pg||
nt|henryb:  Maybe not against a Roman 1N (17-19)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  North will raise to three, and a well placed DK will make South go to game|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Ah, started to write that before it showed up on the screen, sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have 12 top tricks and it looks possible that you can squeeze your way to the 13th|pg||
nt|psyck:  could there be 13 tricks here with W squeezed in majors?|pg||
nt|haans: How many knows that?|pg||
nt|haans: OR bid 5@C alone|pg||
nt|bjurn:  South might try 4@S now|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@S makes 450?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I expect 1@h to be best spot and even make, if you overcall with 4M, you should have a second bid, ususally 5 card minor|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H alerted|pg||
nt|mmmakela: looking  better|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 5@c is ok here|pg||
nt|haans: not fun to double|pg||
nt|ady: apart for the 3 spade losers  cards lay badly for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: n/s though not in a position to take a penalty|pg||
nt|haans: better not to open 1@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: south grits his teeth as well|pg||
nt|psridhar: u to 2 level EW are safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 1@c +15hp|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1@s balanced +9 or 4441|pg||
nt|haans: of you lead @SJ = call TD|pg||
nt|derric: now @S towards K and pray|pg||
nt|ianmcc: with overtricks|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: the quesstion remains, will W bid 5|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S not alerted?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|grebrof: 3@s is presumably preempting|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 8-11 ? really?|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S the winner|pg||
nt|runnerup: same in other room -bidding and lead|pg||
nt|haans: assume three spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/BGTom.pdf  for N-S|pg||
nt|affe82:  anyhow it seems to me 3@d was intended as forcing|pg||
nt|ady: now n/s will get too high|pg||
nt|ady: probably end in 4-3 spade fit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gautis2: did we get the result  of board 2 Johanna?  |pg||
nt|cenglund:  This a better slam than the previous one|pg||
nt|ady: winning lead impossible to find|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this scores better|pg||
nt|gmarco24: what was 2@s Hans?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, so he needs two ruff @s to set up for @d discard. that's the plan for making this|pg||
nt|haans: assume Gazzilli cariation (or Häxan as many say in sweden)|pg||
nt|robinswr: draw trumps and lose three tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: some prospects|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room they got to open 1@H telling 4+ @H and 8-11...and after that sailed to 3nt|pg||
nt|derric: 3NT went down after declarer broke entries in open|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Cards are not lying in favour of making 6NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: I would XX ;)|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead and down|pg||
nt|friggi: 3 down is ok|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S 5 spade + clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: all very restrained|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: this lead destroys one entry to @C suit, but give ruffing finese in @S suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: became a winner - 500 was available|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes, you have the values, showing a hand worth 18-19.|pg||
nt|haans: Asplund had cards for double of 2@D|pg||
nt|bagman: There's little in the play as declarer drives out the @SA and then cashes his top trumps and scores 420 or 450 depending on the spade break|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @H lead in this auction is ortodoxe|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: and they figure it out, so a  stop...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finnish ladies avoided the tempation|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I think the director chosed to let it be (4heartsx-2), but I'm not shore!|pg||
nt|grebrof: not that I can see EW doing something viable over 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may have bid 4@S with West hand - but 5332 distribution is a negative|pg||
nt|santyclz: 29 hcp so it may not be automatic to get there.|pg||
nt|ady: what is 4NT?|pg||
nt|haans: 4n by N fair|pg||
nt|psridhar: well done West , you will go far :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mmmakela: no stayman....need some points from pd.....heart lead might give it away...... so not impossible.....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is no winning lead|pg||
nt|ady: in fact no winning lead as they lay|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I don't like that 1@s too wide a range if you can go down to 5 HCP and soft at that|pg||
pc|s5|nt|zebutin: so if takes that, she is losing 2@D + @H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Maybe 4@s here|pg||
nt|gautis2: ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: I wouldnt change that board 2 either|pg||
nt|grebrof: but ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: not the best lead here|pg||
nt|grebrof: if there is any|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ady: not fancied|pg||
nt|haans: do you really want to know? :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|nubmaster: good bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep, surely not 7... 6 will probably be good enough|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|psridhar: this will make however i thk|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ianmcc: it removes a useful entry|pg||
nt|psyck: stopping low with a key card missing & the 3@d x|pg||
nt|haans: rersponder tend to make transfers all the time|pg||
nt|haans: must play spade now|pg||
nt|haans: no futher delay|pg||
nt|phil: he can make a lot of tricks on this layout|pg||
nt|gmarco24: or, he might try to set up @h |pg||
nt|haans: might or must :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|iceking: i dont really understand why east didnt dbl 3@D|pg||
nt|iceking: east should know dummy in 3@D dbl will hold most often 0-1@D and very few hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this might be a chance for the Swedes in the OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly left the door open.|pg||
nt|haans: so she may not have understood the Pass|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true, xx @S was acceptable to P.|pg||
nt|haans: not fun but must|pg||
nt|mmmakela: is it clear it's the best play?|pg||
nt|runnerup: no but only change |pg||
nt|haans: of you know all cards you may endplay|pg||
nt|haans: but you dont|pg||
nt|haans: all cards right|pg||
nt|affe82:  more information from kibz on the system: BOKK is the name. Baptized after its creators in the end of the 60s. 2 of whom are playing here.|pg||
nt|ady: south must be thrilled with the dummy|pg||
nt|haans: Operatore did he really get 1st trick|pg||
nt|haans: couble of tricks down RIGHT?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|nubmaster: They must continue @d after the 2 @c to take away the entrance to E|pg||
nt|psyck:  as usual, minor slams with borderline values tuf to get to|pg||
nt|yuval10: using a natural system it looks like 1NT - 2@c - 2@h  - 3@d and then N should lead the way with 3 keycards and a Q of trump|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I can think of some layouts where 4xclubs now is the winning line|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gmarco24: OR is faster for 2 boards|pg||
nt|wahlis:  need to play for A @s onside now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: double dummy, you can reel off 8 tricks in the majors & squeeze South in the minors for the rest|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|gautis2: I told it was a close group a while ago, with 2 VP fom 1st to 3rd...  as we speak, it is actually thighter! (1 VP 1st-3rd :))|pg||
nt|haans: but could E have passed with Qxxxxxx and no more|pg||
nt|runnerup: youll loose 3h +1 sp+1 d |pg||
nt|muppe: Ok, was just pointing that the hand could easily be yours when the NT opening was just 13-15. It's not that likely when opp's play stronger nt.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianmcc: wrong pitch, I think she needed @cK onside|pg||
nt|zebutin: discarded @C so doesnt have to take @C finese, but @D suit is so lousy they will not raise as any extra tricks, so needs Ax(x) in front of @D K|pg||
nt|rnmalik: doubt, @C honours were the catch and stiff @H.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with this counterplay declarer can ruff a @C playing reverse dummy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: yep :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|haans: like it when east thinks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nubmaster: @d now or she makes|pg||
nt|friggi: but today players are bidding on air:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: even 1NT would have been transfer|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam bidding not the strength of the Finnish women in this match|pg||
nt|grebrof: last board was the first nonconquested auction NS had - EW are not known for being shut off|pg||
nt|haans: its not fashion today to pen double|pg||
nt|haans: hard bidding so good play very needed|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, he can set up @ss also, but this is more logical plan now|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now zillions|pg||
nt|affe82:  the 2 Ks that is : Kent and kalle|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzdq: Vist Gunn says that she would have play different if she had get the correct information and then only loose one trick, so the result only would be down one|pg||
nt|grebrof: if any ladies form Faroe Islands are watching, I hope you soon come up with a team that can compete in this championships - there is a bye in the womens group - shich in my mind it ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: shouldnt|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but there is less of that around....|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mbruun:  Game over |pg||
nt|zebutin: ofcourse can still take @C finese if wants to, but little riskier|pg||
nt|grebrof: cant say I think W should dbl again|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hawe45:  South will not hav to fear a singleton @C - in case, this would have been played earlier - and faster...|pg||
nt|derric: so E should lead @c after @hQ to remove choices|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|haans: and now clubs ruff|pg||
nt|mmmakela: as 10|pg||
pc|h6|nt|santyclz: Not knowing their system it's hard to assign responability but with akxxxx and 3 2nd round controls s seems to have gone quietly.|pg||
nt|affe82:  or is it Krister not Kalle. conflicting knowledge here in the many helpful comments|pg||
nt|affe82:  leaving the subject for the moment..|pg||

nt|ianmcc: 4@h might just live|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Vore kampe kl. 15.00 efter lunchpausen bliver Island-Danmark Open og Sverige-Finland Damer|pg||
nt|grebrof: I see swedish juniors open frequently at 8-9hp bal -  its their style - no system is perfect|pg||
nt|haans: NS bidding right this far|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H uppercut in clubs|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 3 is too high since S will get a heart promotion|pg||
nt|bagman: On a good day both hearts and clubs behave and EW can make a NT game. No both suits are unfriendly and resulted in 3 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass with 17 can be a risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  trouble with playing short @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: the swedes spread all over Gunnar Hallberg lives in brighton uk likw me:)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hawe45:  Another grand slam|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Two grands in nie hands. Good cardshufflers|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: yes the last one was misscored, it was equal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and good bidders|pg||
nt|haans: would have preferred 3@H to 2|pg||
nt|haans: usually not hearts|pg||
nt|haans: easy way to win IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: W might even let this go undoubled|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@S should go a few down but there isnt that many losers so EW cant afford to slip too much|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, seen dbl now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2N constructive of course|pg||
nt|bridge_one: having 2@D @H @S to bid|pg||
nt|haans: cards look from for 3nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C or 3Nt now by south|pg||
nt|jwit: 8 tricks off the top. 9th trick may not be easy|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks to go close but 4@s quite cheap|pg||
nt|haans: we will soon see if 21C was Drury of natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: offshape overcall with 4cards, offshape x without 3rd @D...so many options for bidding...|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 1nt is 12-14. Last hand w opened 1nt with bal 13hcp|pg||
nt|ralfwil: dbl is 500|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@H is some bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: no hcp no shape no controls |pg||
nt|skaftij:  East certainly has his bid|pg||
nt|haans: Dtury|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: hard to stay below game now|pg||
nt|haans: good bidding by Åhlén|pg||
nt|mmmakela: as does W|pg||
nt|phil: the double fit for NS makes 5@c pretty inexpensive|pg||
nt|skaftij:  300|pg||
nt|friggi: 2@H now|pg||
nt|gmarco24: time for showing @h?|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: never buy a thai keyboard - mainly I am guessing :D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The blockage in hearts is awkward for declarer in 5D|pg||
nt|bjurn:  good lead!|pg||
nt|bagman: EW are likely to score 2 spades by E , diamond overruf by W and the @CA|pg||
nt|bjurn:  @DK, @C towards the @CK?|pg||
nt|bagman: If west gets in with the @CA he can shoot a trump thru kill the club ruff|pg||
nt|phil: not much to the play here|pg||
nt|haans: di not pay to find that 5@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wlc back to Phil Clayton|pg||
nt|phil: hi all|pg||
nt|gmarco24: not yet   :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  and transfer responses I suppose|pg||
nt|roswolf: another classy stop|pg||
nt|psridhar: will chalk up 2 Overtricks on @c guess|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: low score|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody steals from e.  5332 with a marginal (?) suit.|pg||
nt|haans: 31S now focing in my book|pg||
nt|runnerup: this looks like 2 down |pg||
nt|haans: not often you see 2nt as constructive|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 tricks easy because east controls both minors|pg||
nt|ady: hi Phil|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mbruun:  You have to play some kind of Exclusion-blackwood to bid it. Very difficult|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @C (W) - 4 @H (E) - 5 NT - how difficult can you make it, Culbertsonour good old freind|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I exclude exclusion|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Board 6 is also misscored. Hopefully they will be corrected shortly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph lead is normal on the bidding|pg||
nt|derric: shouldn't be a problem on this lie of cards|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: Sorry, I'm lost..|pg||
nt|haans: np :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: syntax error?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: best lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, 4@H makes but 4@S is only 300|pg||
nt|ianmcc: West now interested|pg||
nt|friggi: must be, he knows of a good fit|pg||
nt|affe82:  looks normal. should be one off.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|derric: 1@c is 15+ i believe|pg||
nt|zebutin: but i think they have some bid over strong @C that tells majors, so even that could have been option...|pg||
nt|derric: i don't know if x is take-out|pg||
nt|bridge_one: declarer can make a mistake now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: J@H and @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: double fit, and all honors working almost|pg||
nt|muppe: Would u DBL south hand or pass?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure I would have bid in these circumstnces anyway|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Would u sell?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think East should have bid @h|pg||
pc|d3|nt|zebutin: seems like will lose atleast 3 @S, @D and @C...and cant raise @D suit either before has removed all trumps, and might lose control because of @C suit...|pg||
nt|zebutin: so needs some delicate play|pg||
nt|iceking: east should signal with @S K here|pg||
nt|haans: in scandinavia we all use reverse carding|pg||
nt|friggi: this might create some swing |pg||
pc|dK|nt|grebrof: not all|pg||
nt|yuval10: South needs to switch to @c before she cash the 2nd @d of course|pg||
nt|gmarco24: hard to see how this is going to finish|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mbruun:  In the Open series, the Danish West, HC Graversen lead the HA to beat 3 NT by one on board 6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I doÂ´nt know heir system (either) - but 4 @C from West instead of 3 @H would have been better|pg||
nt|cenglund:  This may be a huge swing|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would, to my shame, double|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe worried @sK would suggest @d pref|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1@c opening in the other room contains a whole lot of diffferent stuff, so not that strange that lead wasnt found|pg||
nt|gautis2: yes, will be 11 imps to Norway|pg||
nt|grebrof: allthou I do prefer it|pg||
nt|haans: but: shogunng: but you have to take sps first|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nothing left to buy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might lead diamond king|pg||
nt|ady: good spot   with a couple of club ruffs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gulyas: that was the cheapest:)|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|wahlis:  4@h in the other room|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  Next board...|pg||
nt|mbruun:  It seems strange to give up the investigations|pg||
nt|iceking: yes probably thinking about that|pg||
nt|santyclz: She was listening...|pg||
nt|jbgood: halfway through - and N has not scored a single imp..|pg||
nt|diaoff: Needed to score the club trick first|pg||
nt|jbgood: the pure downer has gone now - S needed to cash 2 clubs - but a club to the king and another is testing, E will have to double finesse @h 10-9 to make it|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a measly 50 for a vul game|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nubmaster: I think 4@s will make so 5@h will probablu be correct... anyone to analyse if 4@s can be set?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: South cannot have 5 hearts|pg||
nt|phil: with 3-2 trump there's no work to this|pg||
nt|ady: draw 3 rounds of trumps if leading KQ diamonds    but still I tghink 9 tricks|pg||
nt|friggi: very strange|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bridge_one: now impossible lose the contract|pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|cenglund:  Defence can't afford a slightest slip |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|zebutin: this seems to be on road for atleast 1 down at this rate|pg||
nt|zebutin: but with @C return is able to raise @C suit, so defence needs to be sharp too|pg||
nt|derric: 4 black suit ruffs and @DAK@hAK would make 8|pg||
nt|sharkey: Marianne had a difficult decision over 4@S - 5@D not a winner this time as 4@S wud have failed|pg||
nt|bjurn:  should be 2 down now|pg||
nt|psridhar: Geoffrey, do u know if this tourney is restricted to swedes only?|pg||
nt|psridhar: it says sweden open|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|muppe: no they play just 5542, no transfer responses.|pg||
nt|haans: and diamonds|pg||
nt|gmarco24: trump i good from N, the best defence|pg||
nt|gmarco24: is good*|pg||
nt|psridhar: now overtricks galore 3 of them|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gmarco24: 4@h is not cold, who knows|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@c is getting cool|pg||
nt|friggi: but W should show this @H regardless|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mbruun:  How about 5D after 4c. When partner shows two aces bid 5 N and partner will cuebid 6 H which will get them to the grand. Maybe they have other agreements of course|pg||
nt|haans: so the big question is Will 3@H make |pg||
nt|bagman: Not much for N to do; loses two clubs as cannot ruff the 2nd club loser|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ady: on hand 18 3NT failed by 1 trick  where n/s played 2@S on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  then I would respond 1@d with W|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jwit: Good play of diamond Jack|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i know i would over 1@s for sure|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: the 4@c helped, of course|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jbgood: will not do|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S was the good winner|pg||
nt|haans: :) :(|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: one can understand that their inspiration is not at its peak|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense sets up the @HK in the process so they cannot  force N to lead 3 times clubs from hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: and down|pg||
pc|h9|nt|iceking: so 8 imp pick-up for iceland|pg||
nt|haans: play diamonds and hang|pg||
nt|psridhar: ok he has settled for 10|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bridge_one: the endplay against east is very clear|pg||
nt|jwit: It is|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cenglund:  S must stick to all 3 hearts in a game contract|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: yep|pg||
mc|10|nt|derric: no success|pg||
nt|zebutin: now she is losing 2 more, so swedish women continue to gain imps|pg||
nt|derric: 2 more for south|pg||
nt|ady: BOKK got 12 imps on hand 20 6@C -  e/w also went down 3 in 3@H in open room so 600 to BOKK|pg||

nt|zebutin: and will opponents x or bid their own @C suit|pg||
nt|derric: prob 4|pg||
nt|iceking: been great action |pg||
nt|sharkey: the Norweigan girls bid the slam on Bd 24 - wd|pg||
nt|derric: found @cJ it seems|pg||
nt|haans: in the long run|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but 5 @H makes|pg||
nt|friggi: this was expensive|pg||
nt|gmarco24: @s lead at OR, but no @s return after A@h for -1|pg||
nt|haans: at last a Big Club|pg||
nt|ady: if e/w end in 4@S   will go down on bad split|pg||
nt|psridhar: 60 teams play at district level for 10 semi final spots first |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: only worth 3@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: grand here|pg||
nt|haans: good 6@C|pg||
nt|runnerup: 7 on finess so 6 |pg||
nt|bjurn:  12-14|pg||
nt|bagman: looks like a good EW score in the open room; hearts badly and diamonds badly|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt to certain|pg||
nt|bjurn:  S might double 1NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: game restricted to members of swedish clubs |pg||
nt|roswolf: SLAMTIME?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6@s here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hawe45:  The mistake(s) started with the 2 NT-bid - why not allready there bid 4 @C?|pg||
nt|henryb:  can we play 1@c twice in a row?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  You get 4 @H from partner and bid 5 NT|pg||
nt|jwit: Ugh!|pg||
nt|phil: yes, possible East would have pulled the double with AKQTxxx|pg||
nt|haans: some have said give THEM 5 level :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: big swing|pg||
nt|affe82:  this is an akward position for N|pg||
nt|affe82:  might he pass?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hate bidding 1nt with a 6 carder|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mbruun:  I think 4C directly after 2 Sp will show shortage|pg||
nt|haans: lucky them|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C not so frequent with this cards|pg||
nt|haans: @D or 5c M|pg||
nt|psridhar: gud evaluation by Sivelind|pg||
mb|d|nt|zebutin: so might be small gain to finns|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S have 3NT|pg||
nt|iceking: S will dbl 2@S i assume|pg||
nt|psyck: S may balance|pg||
nt|cenglund:  In the open room they played 3NT|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Without club lead 10 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: do assume they had no pen double|pg||
nt|jbgood: wow - off the schneid...|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt not best possible|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@H looks like 500|pg||
nt|haans: and 3nt more likely to make @HT lead|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@H X is likely to go for 500 (and possibly 200)|pg||
nt|jwit: c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably because not vuln|pg||
nt|fabsayc: transfer responses, 1@H=spaded|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S on 4-3 fit looks the only game for e/w|pg||
nt|haans: all nowday bid as gameforce pass with 0.-7|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: 6@H has a chance|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Dealer did not sleep well and not smiling this Sunday morning:)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not always hans|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT and likely failing|pg||
nt|friggi: @S return look kind of auto play|pg||
nt|affe82:  one of the weaknesess of precision. these hands are hard. in my experience it pays to bid once too often|pg||
nt|robinswr: east rescues |pg||
nt|ady: amight make if defence does not cash their clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: now N might gamble on 3nt |pg||
nt|iceking: 3@D could be very wrong give pd like 14-16 hcp and 2-4-3-4 shape and he most likely will pass 3@D even playing leb|pg||
nt|iceking: i bet she will gamble on 3nt, been very agressive so far|pg||
nt|psyck: leb may not apply here anyway|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C-2@C-6@C in my book|pg||
nt|jwit: Couldn't agree more.  I don't even like overcalling 2 of a minor with 5-3-3-2 and full values, let alone subminimal|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1@h = spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: 3, I wrote wrong|pg||
nt|gulyas: they have the points, but the suits don't behave|pg||
nt|gulyas: need some help from the opps:)|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H do assume 4-5 in M|pg||
nt|psridhar: possibly that @d queen swayed him|pg||
nt|psridhar: surely no 1N opg with AX,AJX,XX,AQ1098X|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: can make a lot with majors favorable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: me too never bid 2@C with south cards :)|pg||
nt|haans: not winning contract = scoreing points|pg||
nt|friggi: a lot of help|pg||
nt|affe82:  i would not have balanced as east|pg||
nt|affe82:  aren't we thrilled they chose to play in our 5c suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  DoesÂ´nt matter - it forces East to show the suits with control, and 4 @H is a true dream to hear|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Thats true. Might work out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In my world, a doubleton is shortage|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead are not so good|pg||
nt|runnerup: other table used 7 bids to reach 3nt -bad for F|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2NT will be at least 800|pg||
nt|phil: 1@s is like a weak NT? |pg||
mb|4C|nt|haans: many bid 1@C with 2+ clubs|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|ady: as kib mentioned 3NT makes as they lay   clubs 4-4   and diamonds worth 4 tricks    but should get to 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: ok 3@H it is have to admit i was not thinking about 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: that is one bid no one could have guessed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not 4@s - at least -1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not off to a good start...|pg||
nt|haans: National Teams?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only when it's right lol|pg||
nt|haans: transfer |pg||
nt|gulyas: nothing helps here|pg||
nt|gulyas: systemic misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ianmcc: is this correct?|pg||
nt|friggi: cant be right|pg||
nt|gulyas: somebody forgot they play (or don't play) 2 way checkback|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but South had opened 1@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: now we go OTT|pg||
nt|psridhar: 360 Teams not just 60 play first -i stand corrected|pg||
mb|4D|nt|derric: looks like lost 2@s 4@d 1@c in open|pg||
nt|zebutin: @D Q helped atleast 1 trick|pg||
nt|grebrof: just as my gf - its her birthday, but she is still cleaning :)|pg||
nt|derric: didn't expect a raise on with cards|pg||
nt|haans: raise with three can cost|pg||
nt|haans: no diamods stopper|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east is showing a big hand, so 2@S is lame|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I reckon this will make for a pickup!|pg||
nt|gmarco24: we can suggest to BBO:"autoplay for ruff, when partner is singleton option" :)|pg||
nt|friggi: agree to that:)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: hard work needed to make this one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: has to pop and play @hAx|pg||
nt|gmarco24: or peek in opponents cards|pg||
nt|haans: West bids strong|pg||
nt|robinswr: partner couldn't bid over 1@d means he has diamonds also|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  3 rounds of @S - East discarding the @C Queen... voila!|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Thick single some players call it |pg||
nt|mbruun:  Any play for 3 NT here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mathias, please take a look at the defence, I just figured out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6-7 tricks N/S - or so|pg||
nt|jbgood: operator - didnt 3 @h go down?|pg||
nt|haans: understand nothing|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wow, both souths bid 3 NT w void|pg||
nt|skaftij:  ugh|pg||
nt|muppe: What to lead?|pg||
nt|henryb:  when in doubt ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: what can north bid constructively!?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Warne has managed to bid 2 Suits in a risk free manner|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south see it through|pg||
mb|4N|nt|runnerup: really strains |pg||
nt|haans: i open best minor 1@C with 3-3 = simple slam|pg||
nt|bagman: Sometimes bad things happen; it's part of the game|pg||
nt|bagman: It happens even to the best of the best|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 2@c and 2 aces|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Well I asked about 4@s last deal if it makes or not, the kibbs say yes and no :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: this contact is no party .. |pg||
nt|gautis2: but no double, no trouble..  probably 3 imps to Finland|pg||
nt|haans: @H5 cannot have the 8 or Q|pg||
nt|psyck: now dummy can be killed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course, there was no indication that @cs were so unevenly divided.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c should be a @d signal|pg||
nt|psridhar: yep S is slam bound|pg||
nt|roswolf: he does slam likely to be bid !?|pg||
nt|psridhar: once he has launched into KCB what can stop?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|zebutin: and if now returns @D helps 1 more because ruffs winner anyway|pg||
nt|derric: and @d return now would help another|pg||
nt|iceking: another pick-up for iceland here|pg||
nt|grebrof: it is more than a party :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: @cs is just as good as any - or?|pg||
nt|sharkey: looking at all hands - yes...|pg||
nt|grebrof: well. you have 7cards in the suit and "maybe" an entrance|pg||
nt|haans: Harding do not want to play :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol - has to be a black suit I think|pg||
nt|mmmakela: seems ok in this seq|pg||
nt|haans: chicken bid by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Not the best start for defense|pg||
nt|haans: er have all seen it before many minors never found|pg||
nt|mmmakela: YES, pd has some cds|pg||
nt|roswolf: now q ask|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rnmalik: @S lead.:)|pg||
nt|derric: cards lie well yet again|pg||
nt|haans: they find game by not passing before|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Hulda recounting....|pg||
nt|bjurn:  it's seems like an odd choice tho, p would've passed with some high cards|pg||
nt|ady: played by west   likley to go down|pg||
nt|ady: had some chance had east been declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: well judged from east here go low with good @S support|pg||
nt|gautis2: think T was a fail there...|pg||
nt|gautis2: may escape with 2 off|pg||
nt|grebrof: there are reasons for 1nt with Es hand - who knows how many @cs P have - in this case W would not had passed 1nt|pg||
nt|haans: in my book K+Q = dubbleton|pg||
nt|ady: not surprising e/w stayed low    25 HCP  including stiff Q@H    5 of a minor too high  and 4@S  precarious|pg||
mb|6S|nt|derric: though can try ruff the 4th anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ???|pg||
nt|haans: @SJ hoping|pg||
nt|haans: not as good|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Vores sidste kampe i dag, kl. 17.40, er Finland-Sverige Open og Norge-Danmark Damer. Yuval will translate for you|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D was tranfer to @H?|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|bjurn:  W might try @HJ now, since S took out 2@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South would have gone down in 2@d unless he made inspired play in trumps|pg||
nt|gmarco24: wow|pg||
nt|wahlis:  well done|pg||
nt|jbennet: wd|pg||
nt|friggi: yes it is, also very nice when the King in off side anyway|pg||
nt|jbennet: declare did in fact choose the only sensible way and was rewarded for it.|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i wonder would he play it this way if there was one fast entry to hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mbruun:  But declarer can only come to eight tricks any way|pg||
nt|jbgood: N has shown 20-21, and 2@d was waiting - showing cards|pg||
nt|diaoff: Not straightforward on a @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: if could be a bigger pickup if this goes down, say if dec reads cards wrong|pg||
nt|psyck: well, not more confy ones @d's home|pg||
nt|ralfwil: shorten dummy with @s|pg||
nt|psyck: *now more|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, @s would have been better than @d there|pg||
nt|iceking: iam waiting for undo for this @D return|pg||
nt|psyck: lot of work still to do everywhere|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1 down|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, !K was marked off side|pg||
nt|ianmcc: all this for 1 IMP|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6@s = i hv trump queen but nothing much else|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they bid it - now to make it|pg||
nt|psridhar: one simple route is to ruff a @d in hand if they dont lead trumps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: a lot easier with all hands in view|pg||
nt|haans: 9 have the 8|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure it looks odd and from kibitzer point of view it looks stupid but S might have different thoughts of the auction and even different agreements|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart lead makes it a challenge|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: Fuglestad can count|pg||
nt|jbennet: so why it was the only sensible way???|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: now it's making again, if South play @h to Ace then J@h discarding @c|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|santyclz: The @s return rather than a @d cost a fatal tempo.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now East will be shortened and go -200|pg||
nt|psridhar: on a @h lead he can ruff a @d rt? how about trump lead?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|grebrof: brb - my woman went away on a "businesstrip", so I am doing the laundry . imagine! :)|pg||
nt|bagman: If Gitelman Moss can go -1600 in 4@HXX with xx facing xxx we all can end up in someting silly :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cenglund:  Not a good line of play|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|derric: 7imps to finns|pg||
nt|iceking: would have been better if decl had used her entry to play @C|pg||
nt|yuval10: something like final match today at 17:40 Final-Sweden? :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: because club ace have to be right tp have a chance|pg||
nt|psridhar: needs play @c rt then|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mbruun:  Forget the 10 IMPs for Denmark on board 8, and the 3 IMP for Norway on board 6. Difficulties in correcting these scores, but they are not right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so far-fetched for West to double 3 NT and take the 800 on a normal @S-lead. If you doÂ´nt now and then write 750 for the opponents, you havÂ´ent doubled enough|pg||
nt|mbruun:  The actual standing should be 20-16 for Norway|pg||
nt|gautis2: dont belive u:)|pg||
nt|haans: good play in spades|pg||
nt|mmmakela: can he make?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  No|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South will scaire all his trumps|pg||
nt|skaftij:  score|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes seems at least -1|pg||
nt|haans: but spades a worth 3 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yuval10: and Norway-Denmark ladies of course|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sure but D ruff, @S fin.... S gets 4 trumps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjurn:  true dat! :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now can be 2 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q@S and @h to make 7 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|iceking: how about @S King now|pg||
nt|yuval10: by the way Roland, my license is for Svensk only :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: this time the @C was a winner - 1 trick difference|pg||
nt|haans: @HJ would have been tricker|pg||
nt|haans: Siuth will be endplayed|pg||
nt|haans: South|pg||
nt|phil: no he cant strip clubs|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|haans: @SJ|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Wake-up call - it would be difficult for East to discard the @C Queen on the third @S-round - as East must follow suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: with all the nice @Ds in S, this will make|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|grebrof: yes,this was not good play (or after the @HK) not good defense either|pg||
nt|sharkey: off 2 cud very well be copied OR|pg||
nt|phil: so South will take all four trump + 2 diamonds it seems|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will to to ruff @C now, @S and @S but S gets out w C|pg||
nt|haans: I agree: ldadmirer: kind of interesting but in a different way. They are wasting time which could be of better use on other bds :-)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: looks like he'll bring this home|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|nt|haans: playing hearts told West not to play diamonds|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|iceking: now east should fallow with @H 9|pg||
nt|psyck: dec hoping for trump 33 now|pg||
nt|iceking: both on Q play or low from decl|pg||
nt|roswolf: claim + next|pg||
mc|12|nt|skaftij:  Declarer knows the distribution |pg||
nt|gmarco24: what is K@h is in?|pg||
nt|muppe: Would it be better to lead @hT, you want it to be covered to keep the communications better?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or low to J|pg||
nt|muppe: that might be even better!|pg||

nt|jbgood: i am afraid the standing is 50-0 - unless 3@h really made on   25 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT for NS and tea break.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure how they play, but 1@H is possible with 0 points in some versions of this system|pg||
nt|friggi: but N-S shoudl have played trump earlier|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|psridhar: good result from a good effort wd|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|roswolf: must remember to bid 1nt with a 6 carder more often!?:)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|henryb:  finesser's paradise for N-S|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you open 1@d what do you rebid over 1@s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: big chance for E/W|pg||
nt|haans: Big diamond 17+|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not very nice to go down in NT when 7 min available|pg||
nt|bagman: S not happy, though, as he cannot be sure that he lost only 5; could be worse if team mates missed the game or went minus in the game|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@H might give Lirarna a chance here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C max for N/S - 4@H can be dangerous for E/W|pg||
mb|d|nt|skaftij:  9 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but he could have used @s as entry - didn't have to hook @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: east call himself an idiot, and says Hi to you all!|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: pass over 4@s by E wasn't good with 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|zebutin: cecilia didnt double with QJ1098 of spades when opponents were in 4@S...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Easy 12 tricks here in NT or @cs, let's see what Katrine and jessica will do|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S nat forcing|pg||
nt|sharkey: another slam possibility for the Finns...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another slam, this time a cold one|pg||
nt|wahlis:  2@c FG relay|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 6@h in other room. interesting fit!  :)|pg||
nt|haans: good to double 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: strange  e/w managed to get penalty double of 3 spades in open room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|zebutin: 3@D ? invite to fullgame?|pg||
nt|iceking: most likely final result here 4@S |pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: easy 3nt if no Hearts lead :)|pg||
nt|haans: may be stayman|pg||
nt|haans: stopping in 3@C good at OR|pg||
nt|robinswr: some 1nt some 2@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may take some time to bod|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psyck: with a few o/t's :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 26 HCP not every day....|pg||
nt|haans: and so we learn :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - we will see|pg||
nt|haans: Big Diamonds has its problems|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H not GF I think|pg||
nt|cenglund:  You shouldn't miss this one under any circumstances|pg||
nt|grebrof: allthou these are artificial bidders - it might not be so easy|pg||
nt|haans: Magic Diamonds comes from Carroy Clubs as natural as possible (possible)|pg||
nt|psyck: this should be easier to get also for E|pg||
nt|santyclz: A slam too good for Roland  but sub-par for the rest of us.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Off an ace and qjxx of trump.|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks as if it made on a different defense than we saw.. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: but 3@H makeble|pg||
nt|mmmakela: par reached in OR|pg||
nt|mmmakela: lacking dbl to be excact|pg||
nt|phil: 2@s = 9-12|pg||
nt|henryb:  Aha. The Precision trap: open 2@c with W hand and avoid any major suit fits|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H very odd bid in OR|pg||
nt|gmarco24: we might see 6@s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  THis board wont take long. 450 for EW |pg||
nt|hawe45:  450 both tables, next|pg||
nt|gmarco24: or just 4@s|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s - at least on this board|pg||
nt|sharkey: as long as N can show @S support shud be in slam|pg||
nt|psyck: slam may still go down if bid, if dec played N for single @h honor|pg||
nt|jbgood: and this one presents no problems - duck and ten on a @d endplaying E|pg||
nt|runnerup: now 4h ew looks diificult to bid  -can it to made dont know but lookes possible|pg||
nt|ady: plent of strength e/w   but no fit  so will end in 3NT|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wait till he sees +5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this very thin 3NT probably has to make|pg||
nt|friggi: @S lead kills|pg||
nt|muppe: Aggressive overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: what?|pg||
nt|zebutin: might be missing some pass somewhere...|pg||
nt|zebutin: maybe johanssen passed|pg||
nt|zebutin: Erkkilä bid 3@D|pg||
nt|zebutin: Andersson x:ed|pg||
nt|derric: possible|pg||
nt|zebutin: and Ahonen bid 3@H...|pg||
nt|zebutin: thats my quess|pg||
nt|zebutin: i see no way that this is the real bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: sorry, my misstake!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 5/5 bid 2@D is a risk|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D bid once and out|pg||
nt|wahlis:  2@d no SPL|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hawe45:  Can make 480 with @C-continuation|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We really hope, that the mis-scored boards will be changed before sundau at midnoght...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  sunday|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I'm going to change them after this rond!|pg||
nt|haans: nothing say W have five spades|pg||
nt|haans: psychic bidding?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could lose only 3 @s and @dA. Anyway hypothetical|pg||
nt|henryb:  very.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Note: the right play in @d is low to Q|pg||
nt|affe82:  as I play 2@c would show both minors. either could be longer|pg||
nt|affe82:  playing that way has some drawbacks but in this case makes the rebid easy|pg||
nt|robinswr: good lead for the offense|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: well - N doesnt have a lot to offer besides @s-support|pg||
nt|grebrof: did S show @S now?|pg||
nt|haans: step respone = four cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: well - thats all S needs...|pg||
nt|bagman: In principle NS lose only heart, club and a diamond in heart contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  which wins against Kx or Kxx onside|pg||
nt|muppe: This will probably make.|pg||
nt|henryb:  the sneak attack|pg||
nt|henryb:  of course, if the Q loses to the K you will have to guess net time|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C a make all cards right|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iceking: on normal @C lead its possible win all the tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: it depends over the lead...if the lead is the natural @s lead then it looks like they should go for restricted choice|pg||
nt|haans: do assume that|pg||
nt|skaftij:  strange with @h suit|pg||
nt|phil: Ive been told that its good to achieve plus scores at IMPs :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: seems stupid with those hearts|pg||
nt|haans: we have all heard about that Rare :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not so sure about that, 4 of either major looks better|pg||
nt|ady: 6 of a minor can be made by e/w    but terrible contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but after a @d lead...|pg||
nt|iceking: creative lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: ty Hans|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Even the grand one is making|pg||
nt|sharkey: S probing - shud keep in mind they have messed up all slams so far|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud this be affecting South now?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I am not saying you should be in 7|pg||
nt|haans: missing @HK they wont|pg||
nt|haans: have they forgotten steps?|pg||
nt|haans: urkkkkkkkkkk|pg||
nt|bagman: In practice they might lose more|pg||
nt|psridhar: my requirements for 1N opg with a 6 card minor = 1. controllish hand 2. moderate and not strong suit 3. no suit open|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: After this start they will get to slam and make some imps here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice bidding so far:))|pg||
nt|runnerup: this if good stagegy -double and take your money wd|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|haans: Only EW bidding|pg||

mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Probably a push board|pg||
nt|gautis2: 3N is reached..seems like a flat board |pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: if the lead isn't @s then you can still make it if the hand with 3 @h's also have 3 @d's|pg||
nt|haans: no @HT good card|pg||
nt|haans: bidding wrong|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 4@h from W operator. undo|pg||
nt|psridhar: kind of hand where if u open 1m , u r shy of rebidding 3m with a jump due to poor suit quality|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: 3/5th against suit :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: follow with @dQ|pg||
nt|iceking: unbid suit |pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sQ is a keycard|pg||
nt|jbgood: now E gets squeezed in the reds instead|pg||
nt|haans: good strategy but rare nowdays|pg||
nt|mmmakela: lead was risky imo from that holding|pg||
nt|haans: But Aldeborg did bid right|pg||
nt|psridhar: exactly what S held|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|grebrof: well, its only one board they lost in a slam position - N could hardly do anymore than 4@s now|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: if 4@s was cue, i'd have expected E to bid slam even missing 1 key card|pg||
nt|mmmakela: shd be no accidents for def here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump back|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: good MP would have been to finesse clubs 10|pg||
nt|gmarco24: if he make this one too i'll suspect that E is not holding cards well  :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: claim 12....|pg||
nt|gulyas: why wouldn't he ruff a @S? makes no sense|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|santyclz: Now tactically should w play against restricted choice, hoping the slam fails?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  not possible|pg||
nt|henryb:  useful 7 or 8 imps for N-S team|pg||
nt|roswolf: west may be endplayed soon|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzdq: now the director is here, because W got the wrong explanision, but know they decided to wait until afterwards|pg||
nt|gmarco24: how many pass bids were in the bidding box?|pg||
nt|jbennet: there arersome who claimes that agressive leads vs slams is winng|pg||
nt|gmarco24: does bidding table here has a scroll option?  :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but must lose 1@h & 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: Upmark picked up 6@H, but put it back again!|pg||
nt|wahlis:  He might finesse @h when the ten drops|pg||
nt|friggi: that is his only chance|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a joker with J10x|pg||
nt|psridhar: hard to see where 9 tricks will come form here|pg||
nt|psridhar: @c end play ?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|grebrof: the last board - looked more of a success playing the @c K at trick 1 - the trumpswitch wasnt a winner|pg||
nt|mmmakela: surely poss w 3x dias|pg||
nt|ianmcc: curious|pg||
nt|ianmcc: is he still playing 2@d?|pg||
nt|friggi: maybe he told ut the answer earlier:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe he is playing notrump:)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: of course that's it|pg||
nt|friggi: must be|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|bridge_one: 10 @C means J, so np for defence|pg||
nt|haans: an undo here so ...|pg||
nt|gmarco24: J@c lead would be interesting  :D|pg||
nt|ianmcc: criminal|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, small then|pg||
nt|gmarco24: now the harder part:"ok, what was your bidding?"|pg||
nt|jbennet: a typical realy sequence. getting them overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: S has shown his shape and 2 aces, 1 king and 2 queens|pg||
nt|jbennet: relay system|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: endplay|pg||
nt|jbennet: the books says lead agressive agaisnt small slams|pg||
nt|muppe: had 9 tricks if @cK on, didn't want to risk contract. Although spades seem to be 4-4 because of the bidding.|pg||
nt|haans: good try but ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: Warne cd hv shifted to @c early|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|roswolf: or east may think he was:)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  not now|pg||
nt|haans: Did say no to diamonds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NEXT|pg||
nt|jbennet: the books are wrong (whenever an agressive lead had an influence on the outcome|pg||
nt|muppe: So maybe @c to T would be safe|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the session|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|haans: endplaying himself|pg||

pc|h7|nt|psridhar: now easy|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: not in your life here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: will make. They had to remove @dK earlier|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good def|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzdq: east went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|haans: when North opened 1NT diamonds died|pg||
nt|mmmakela: agree N shd open 3 @D if available|pg||
nt|gmarco24: also, about books - it's important who wrote them|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jbennet: he odds are roughly 7-3 in favourite that it was the only lead to let the contract make|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbennet: rather than being the only lead to defeat it|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c3|nt|bagman: There's not going to be a diamond guess: If the @DA is in the hand with the @ST (E) the contract goes down|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|gautis2: cashed 9..fair enough :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i agree with that|pg||

nt|muppe: Last board now.|pg||
nt|gmarco24: with one more entry 6nt is making, so learn from good players not to dbl slams with good trump holding|pg||
nt|haans: :) Time to thank us and  you and Johanna Vindeful VUGRAPH :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: thank you!|pg||
nt|ady: grand slam to complete|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Angelica. Great Job! Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentator PS for his perceptive comments ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes. Finally, our gratitude to the Swedish Bridge Federation for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Normal for me|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 @H not a bad contr here|pg||
nt|affe82:  so this should start with 1@h- no?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: a hughe score for Finland in OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: the Swede pair in the OR failed to reach 6@d as well ( speaking of board 8 ). This doesn't look like the best of set for them|pg||
nt|psyck: EW have a good sac against the @s game|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 3@D maybe|pg||
nt|gautis2: pretty good lay in 5@c :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: (or 3N(|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2@c should give some gaz to N here too|pg||
nt|haans: why 1@H instead of 4|pg||
nt|runnerup: but unlucky|pg||
nt|jwit: Should be a push here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 @C at second trick declarer would try to duck his K|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, let's say doubleton K@c at W would leat to 6@h making!|pg||
nt|ady: thx Johananna|pg||
nt|psridhar: and Thx to Geoffrey for his valuable comments :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: scheduled restart in approx 23mins|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mmmakela: i @D call helps but ensures defeat in 4|pg||
nt|jbennet: this hand illsutrates the reason why evolution doesnt prmote relay systems.t |pg||
nt|haans: Correction : gronkvist: vinefur|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 3@h?|pg||
nt|grebrof: S has normally shown a good and - and shes got one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting board.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Nothing exciting unless someone decides to shed more BLOOD|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last segment in Sweden postponed 15 minutes. New start time: top of the hour|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good pass from North - very tempting to X|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: an option  3rd seat fav for sure|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Pass: 0-7/17+|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@C: 8-11, 5+@C|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@D relay (17+)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: as  suppdbl promising 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: for sure|pg||
nt|psyck: will poor breaks they will all do well to lie low however|pg||
nt|gautis2: 3N?|pg||
nt|haans: you may need to finesse clubs here|pg||
nt|haans: Carrot Clubs|pg||
mb|2N|nt|derric: seems like overbid|pg||
nt|haans: may be hard bidding only game|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@D 3-3-1-6|pg||
nt|gulyas: double, with Ax in @H?|pg||
nt|gulyas: you mean 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: yeah, that's correct :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: maybe invite 55 only|pg||
nt|grebrof: I like 4@c too|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's a big stop by N.... A@s K@d A@c is all she needs to slam|pg||
nt|haans: only 3 in OR|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H must be forcing|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Rdl = 3@s?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: never|pg||
nt|psridhar: kind of slam u wd bid if looking to swing|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|3C|nt|zebutin: 12-14 notrump...but they seem to stop at reasonable level still...most likely wont make, but atleast its not in red...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@c is like Gazzilli, strong (any) or nat with @cs|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@h is minimum vs the strong hand with 2c support|pg||
nt|gautis2: oh..4 @c solved all problems|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|haans: why not 1@S with tre spades|pg||
nt|haans: three|pg||
nt|fabsayc: transfer style overcall is a game killer here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: routine 3NT I'll leave now with scores almost locked. Bye and thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: 2N = asking for 3c M, 3@C denied it|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: 5c of couse|pg||
nt|friggi: yes they can be a double edge swords|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: well done|pg||
nt|jbennet: North was hoping for a dream scenario , but south:s hand was pretty much what could be expected.|pg||
nt|haans: Opinion 2: gronkvist: hon är söt oxå:) :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mbruun:  4H/S should be quite easy to reach, and nothing in the play. Dull board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  12-14 tror jeg|pg||
nt|cenglund:  5C depends on 1 successful finesse and DA onside, I wouldnt't stretch my luck that much|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 down - nothing much in it|pg||
nt|haans: lead hearts taking awat entry to fummy and spade finesses|pg||
nt|haans: d|pg||
nt|jbgood: unless S return a spade|pg||
nt|jbgood: (or even a @d ?)|pg||
nt|haans: but not enough|pg||
nt|haans: decl counting 9?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C finesse and @S play can reduce @D loosers to 2. Only Chance that I see.|pg||
nt|haans: recount shortly|pg||
nt|derric: scoring 4 black trick, 4 trumps and 2 ruffs would make 10|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not easy and may not make.|pg||
nt|gulyas: never double? agree|pg||
nt|ianmcc: never 3@d|pg||
nt|gulyas: disagree:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  An illustration of why to play Drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: but it's rather hard to inquier.... 5@d from N would probably be natural|pg||
nt|haans: yep start with hearts|pg||
nt|bjurn:  that would promise 4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  for running scores|pg||
nt|ianmcc: probably cheaper than X here|pg||
nt|friggi: what about 3NT?|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think its a close call between 3@D and pass, but I would never ever double|pg||
nt|psridhar: need @s to play for no loser AND @d to fetch 4|pg||
nt|psridhar: they do here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|iceking: ufh|pg||
nt|iceking: east had no reason bid 3@D here |pg||
nt|nubmaster: Jessica thinks... well it's teams :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt actually makes agains normal d lead|pg||

nt|mmmakela: N shd do more?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: haha jaha ja :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: so an opportunity for Sivves|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: ducking a @s?|pg||
nt|psyck: it was going well upto the 3@c bid :)|pg||
nt|iceking: bidding suggest pd has 0-1@D|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@S long @C and most likely 3@H|pg||
nt|gautis2: after 600  u just hate to hear: push board:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: you are vul - we have seen their style earlier too|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The merit of the contact is that it's unbeatable|pg||
nt|grebrof: now dont need d! A onside anymore - providing a switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: true Christer|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed carpe diem|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: Only 6 trick available here, but might be hard for S to discard correctly on @D|pg||
nt|bjurn:  was wrong about E strength, shows 8-16|pg||
nt|bagman: They might find that they are off 2 keycards in clubs|pg||
nt|haans: on a pure finesse (clubs)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3NT: 3 controls (A=2, K=1)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@D: no @C control (or @CAKQ)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  W knows that @Cs are, at best, on a finesse|pg||
nt|jwit: Declarer says Oh No, not a spade lead|pg||
nt|friggi: in E ofcause|pg||
nt|gulyas: if nv W can have such a powerful hand, then maybe...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT for E/W that 3@c was loaded|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs 7 solid @Cs and something else, and maybe a lucky lie of cards or defensive error|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, but both players open 3@C|pg||
nt|ianmcc: bye now back in 45|pg||
nt|haans: better slam than nlast board|pg||
nt|gmarco24: last board here. ty Hans. tx for watching kibitzers|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S way to fall off|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: promises 4 and min I guess|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Would seem best to bid 2 @s with 4|pg||
nt|roswolf: a likely push|pg||
nt|psridhar: no slam and the match ends in dead heat|pg||
nt|psridhar: well played to both teams |pg||
pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: a @d shift and -2|pg||
nt|grebrof: you finnish or swedish?|pg||
nt|runnerup: can be beateng ofcause can make olso|pg||

nt|haans: If you dont find Grand your off|pg||
nt|psridhar: we saw some fine plays and enjoyed thx all|pg||
pc|d2|nt|zebutin: opponents seem to be on right road by removing the trumps in both hands, diamonds arent even so they wont bring anything extra to the table|pg||
nt|ianmcc: playing @s looks best|pg||
nt|grebrof: or just simply South African?|pg||
nt|grebrof: "the @c K is always single?"|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Finnish, but I lived 7 years in South Africa|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||

pc|d7|nt|ralfwil: will make now! win with @hK and a @s to @sA discard a @d on @cK|pg||
nt|bjurn:  but if E has @DA instead of @HA 6@C is still a good contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only if 2@H promised spades, might not|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|haans: not all would have bid game here|pg||
