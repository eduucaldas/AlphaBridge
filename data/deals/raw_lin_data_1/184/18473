mb|d|mb|p|nt|jcwla: E will commence with 1@H, W will bid 1@S, E will likely rebid 2@C (maybe 1NT), and they'll end in either 3NT or 4@S.  |pg||
mb|2N|an| Leb?|mb|p|nt|jcwla: It's not the most beautiful layout ever encountered.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi CK.|pg||
nt|psyck: 3rd vs 7th placed teams here|pg||
nt|psyck: RR results: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USSBC2011/RRsheet.php|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Jordan|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: a quiet start|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Hmm...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lml: declarer is going to need some help to find a seventh trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: slow approach shows stopper|pg||
nt|sybarra: (in hearts)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and now only 7 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: S will like dummy  |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|lml: they play smith so the @S may suggest a switch |pg||
nt|lml: @S8|pg||
nt|sybarra: will likely cash a and k of spades to avoid lots of ruffs|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@D sets up the game force, now with @D stopped E rebids 2NT and now W shows the good @S suit, and E elects 3NT.|pg||
nt|kemperg: but @H is the right defense|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|lml: yes but that is not completely clear to Fisher|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck: this should now come home with 5@s, 2@d, 2@c in due course of time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Much friendlier to receive a @C lead into E in 3NT than from N through E in 4@S.  They had a really nice auction.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lml: this is still okay but they do have to get back to hearts|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|lml: need to go back to hearts now|pg||
nt|lml: Hamilton might work it out.  Partner is very likely to have four hearts|pg||

nt|sybarra: its connected to the Marriott right?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Likely a 1@D opening intending to rebid 2NT over pd's response; here none is forthcoming.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|psyck: apparently they only need 13 cards to respond at this vul|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the modern game it is just detested to pass pd's opening.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Yes! The host suite has two 36" tvs with BBO!|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bunch of hts here for e/w |pg||
nt|casenjo:  I am on WIFI in the hotel lobby|pg||
mb|4D|nt|psyck: support double likely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks for me easier than 4@s|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: redouble that is|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now how do you feel about making the support redouble vs. bidding the 2NT (with the possibility of finding out about @H's later)?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  excuse me 56" |pg||
nt|sybarra: I operated a tourney there a couple of years ago |pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: xx better|pg||
nt|lml: 3@D seems reasonable but they will end up in notrump about now|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: What's the rationale?|pg||
nt|psyck: you can always bid NT to show your values later|pg||
nt|psyck: this gives more room for more options|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: he has managed both at 2 level, whereas if 2NT 1st, yet to show support...|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is Wolff.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@C forcing 3@D then W will go back to 3@H (or conceivably pass).|pg||
nt|kemperg: E worried about @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: like the Nationals |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: ok, W doubled N's 3@c|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, ok, Wolff sighoff sequence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: any objections?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: I think we're missing a pass here.|pg||
nt|psyck: W's x says i like to bid|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|psyck: tuf, pass likely|pg||
nt|psyck: some days i may try 1N or 2@c :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Pass would not be my choice.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have the master suit so not afraid of something like their finding a @H fit.|pg||
nt|psyck: at this vul, most days i'd pass though|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have good values and pd's pass over 1@D could be hiding as much as an opener.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: the only problem on this board is to avoid a @s slam|pg||
nt|casenjo:  there have been some very big hands in both the Seniors and the Women's events|pg||
nt|sybarra: debating where I want to be with e/w hands|pg||
mb|3C|nt|casenjo:  6NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: that works |pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: Clerkin likes to open very light even when in another chair|pg||
nt|lml: here 1@H is mostly for the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: i'm not a bid fan of jumping with 4 cards and bal hands|pg||
nt|jcwla: E will open 1NT with a max, W will invite and they will settle comfortably in 3NT that depends on the lead.|pg||
nt|lml: In the Open Room Wolff opened Clerkin's hand 2@H.  What do you think of that?|pg||
mb|6C|nt|sybarra: played by W,  a spade lead could messup  6 nt |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: better than 1@H|pg||
nt|lml: I agree.  I like it better and I think it is a good thought in third chair|pg||
nt|lml: it did get them too high|pg||
nt|lml: the opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: would you open 1N or 1@d here?|pg||
nt|jcwla: W might just blast - but E wants to be in vul games as much as W.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: some players makes a false cue in @h on a hand like W|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: you dont often see strong jump shift anymore  |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is 9 with some downgrades.  As long as your style is to accept invites with anything but a dead min (as it should be), an invite is plenty in my book.|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case S does not find the magic @S lead and score it up.|pg||
nt|psyck: i would have probably opened 1@d all A's & K's & 5 card suit...|pg||
nt|psyck: agree, maybe vul game so just blasted|pg||
nt|sybarra: a sigh of relief when the club Q comes down |pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: sometimes i belong to them:)|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|psyck: on a different day, stopping in 3@d would have been a success with opps taking 1st 5 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not on a club back|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h5|nt|jcwla: I like to err on the side of 1NT on close decisions.  Something newer players would do well to do.  Think how comfortable you feel when partner opens 1NT.  You've asserted claim to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: the hand, you know your structure very well, you're primed for a nice, intelligent auction.   You just don't feel the same sense of feet on the ground with a 1@D opening.|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|007 joosth: yes  declarer dont know about  the blocking spades.   so the sonner the better he should play this diamond|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|lml: I think the @d7 was showing spade values.  Lets see if Clerkin agrees|pg||
nt|007 joosth: thats the danger of a weak 2  with good values outside the suit.   the down-lead will be difficult to find|pg||
nt|007 joosth: its 10 or 11 tr now|pg||
nt|kemperg: S knows Ncan only have pts in @S left|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sorry  always 10  I should learn counting better|pg||

nt|007 joosth: maybe the weak 2 in last board was better:  at least the best suit|pg||
nt|kemperg: best chance is N having @C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Clerkin gazing at ceiling|pg||

mb|2D|nt|psyck: the innovative @s bid may deter W from leading his poor suit here :)|pg||

nt|007 joosth: declarer has a choice which suit he will play first when in 3NT,  probably spades?|pg||

nt|007 joosth: no west has 2 entrys for the trumpromotion|pg||

nt|kemperg: sure|pg||

mb|1H|nt|007 joosth: which singleton spade is more probable after the double|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chick: I would open the W hand only if I had a 2-suit preemptive bid to use|pg||
nt|bigtrain: random|pg||
nt|bigtrain: besides a high spade handles all nicely|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can't be wrong|pg||
nt|lml: I suspect but dont know that 2@h shows spades or minors|pg||
nt|lml: here spades|pg||
nt|lml: Gertsman could try 4@S and let Clerkin correct with minors|pg||
nt|lml: I make it about 3 down in spades|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chick: this auction makes no sense|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: I think in the last quarter we might see a bit of action.  Levine needs to stir things up.  They do have about10 more imps which haven't been recorded though|pg||

mb|5C|nt|sybarra: all this week in fact |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: as expected, they reach the same doomed contract |pg||
nt|psyck: W would give a lot to exchange @hJ for @dJ (not that he may finesse @c even then)|pg||
nt|psyck: but after the 2@s bid, he would want to, if he could|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: lossing diamond finesse now?|pg||

nt|lml: thanks to everyone and to our operator who has done a great job|pg||

nt|lml: on the lie of the cards the club works better because the @CJ comes down |pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|007 joosth: maybe declarer can enter once dummy with a club|pg||
pc|hA|nt|007 joosth: not now|pg||
nt|lml: not sure what Gerstman was playing for .. maybe a spade miracle|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is going to be less fun now|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

pc|hK|nt|007 joosth: E will now the club jack now   otherwise there would have been finesse|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psyck: after 4@d bid, he will just continue @s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: I would hope so|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|psyck: of, @h as S signalled for it i guess|pg||
