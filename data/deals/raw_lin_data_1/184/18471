nt|athene: but Hamman would more likely be aggressive with both major kings|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and if south does have the @SK then @DA and @DQ is sure to beat the contract even if it gives hamman his @DK - they will get the @CAQ when south gets in|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: whatever he leads helps declarer to an extent|pg||
nt|barnets: north will place the final contract\|pg||
nt|ritong: one of weichsel's problems currently is: if i raise @ds, what will be the agreed suit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: on a spade lead declarer might throw a club on a spade and play for a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: or alternatively try and get the diamonds going|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good lead|pg||
nt|barnets: souths 3@D shows 3  card spade support|pg||
nt|othered1: Turns out 2N wasn't free here.  Wonder what 4@D would have meant over 2@S?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|barnets: some play it has 3 and a non minimum|pg||
nt|barnets: now a cue bid|pg||
nt|barnets: meanwhile north has not supported diamonds|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|ritong: now it is @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: north still is not sure|pg||
nt|ritong: i mean, south answers with @s fit|pg||
nt|barnets: where to play|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@D could be right|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|barnets: now south is worried  he has shown more diamonds than he has|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|ritong: saving 2 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: souths decision could have been a match winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Dummy showed max, stiff heart|pg||
nt|barnets: this looks sure to be flat|pg||
nt|ritong: lair took a huge view|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: looks innocuous, but is enormous|pg||
nt|barnets: of course north had not guaranteed 5 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: so the whole situation is wooly to say the least|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|athene: declarer is going to go for a club ruff|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  one of the key facets in defense is to try not to break new suits for declarer hence Bob's return of a @s|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|andyv:  the tough part is now|pg||
nt|andyv:  best seems AK @h and ruff @c|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's only worry now is holding the trump losers to one|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you ruff a diamond now|pg||
nt|athene: you know west has the king still so that isn't getting overruffed|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @d ruff, E pitches @c|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but you might still be able to combine chances in trumps|pg||
nt|athene: with some trump coup possibilities|pg||
nt|andyv:  so basically the same thing but ruff 1@d first then AK@h?  that works too|pg||

nt|andyv:  I think John's line was very efficient|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ritong: soooo....|pg||
nt|ritong: is that one mundane?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: the idea of ruffing some diamonds was that you might then be able to cash the @HAK and even if west showed out you would not necessarily be dead|pg||
nt|athene: as you might have a trump coup against east|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good point|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|othered1: no board passes out any more, even if two players pass 11 counts in 1 and 2 pos, a rarity in some circles |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sutherlin knows everyone has about a ten count|pg||
nt|athene: bramley has to be dead min to pass 1@S|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: i would bid 2@C on the south hand i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  usually, responder shouldn't have more points than opener:)|pg||
nt|athene: you just don't get rich letting opps play in 1 of things|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|barnets: now on that lead e/w can hold dec to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|othered1: One possible imp pick up here to Deutsch . . . |pg||
nt|ritong: 9 for sure, let s see about the tenth|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|barnets: which could be a very vital imp|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: You have a twice-passed partner and little defense . . . |pg||
nt|athene: i guess he decided there was not much point; most of the time it would just push opps from 1@S making 8 into 2@S making 8 :)|pg||

nt|barnets: if n/s play 4@H the match is a tie|pg||
nt|barnets: 13 imps to lynch|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: and there will be extra boards|pg||
nt|barnets: if the scoring is corect|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|othered1: Quite a 2@S bid in OR.  Do they play it 2-suited by definition?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, good point barnet|pg||
mb|2D|nt|barnets: in other room west opened 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: on the rule of 11, north has one club higher than the six|pg||
nt|athene: if it's the king or jack you want to play low in dummy; if it's the 9 or 8 you want to stick in the ten|pg||
nt|othered1: Deutsch has gotten into the lead on the basis of that potential slam on board 42, where they found 6@D in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: assuming you can get south on lead next|pg||
nt|andyv:  so odds about 2-1 in favor of 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  as most don't lead away from Jacks|pg||
nt|athene: isn't it exactly 50-50?|pg||
nt|barnets: and this made it more difficult for /s|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: n/s|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|barnets: a good tactical bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: well, he sort of wants to be in dummy to finesse spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: and then found a good opening lead V 3n|pg||
nt|barnets: the @D J|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: so maybe this is reasonable|pg||
nt|barnets: so good play by passel to put pressure on n/s|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: Remember, the score shown here is not official.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: south could have taken out 3N but left it in|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: if you played low and north did turn up with a big card, then your natural play would be a diamond, which might allow north to put a club through anyway|pg||
nt|barnets: the def must cash another diamond now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|ritong: i think 11 or 12 do not change imp|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|barnets: thats a tie|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  Deutsch has gone ahead by bidding the slam on board 42|pg||
nt|athene: bramley can make 11 but only if he finesses the spade, i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  so with 17 boards to go, this promises to be a very match|pg||
nt|athene: he might have enough of a count to do that|pg||
nt|andyv:  exciting that is:)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: he will see south has five diamonds and one heart|pg||
