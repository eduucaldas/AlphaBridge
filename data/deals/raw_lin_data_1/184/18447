nt|gracelin: maybe East will learn not to make a 2-level double with his 4333 pattern.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|gracelin: a solid result for Semarang in the closed room.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: max 8 tricks for ns, 3@d ok -- 9 tricks for ew|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c wld be -1 for ns if allowed|pg||
nt|gracelin: south may consider to open 3C as deal.  He might feel he has too many major suit cards for that.  I agree.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: you got it sir :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: many would play double of 2C here as T/O, but the old fashioned still play it as for penalty.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: that's true. it's indeed old school method|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: It is hand like this you would like to play the double as T/O. |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes|pg||

nt|h_karluk: to me 5/2 @h good because when declarer has 5/4 M, produces extra tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|gracelin: for me, I would just raise to 2S with the south hand.  A single raise needs not be divided into good or bad.|pg||
