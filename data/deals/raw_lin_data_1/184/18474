mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: E will commence with 1@H, W will bid 1@S, E will likely rebid 2@C (maybe 1NT), and they'll end in either 3NT or 4@S.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: It's not the most beautiful layout ever encountered.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi CK.|pg||
nt|psyck: 3rd vs 7th placed teams here|pg||
nt|psyck: RR results: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USSBC2011/RRsheet.php|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Jordan|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: a quiet start|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcwla: Hmm...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: declarer is going to need some help to find a seventh trick|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: slow approach shows stopper|pg||
nt|sybarra: (in hearts)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: and now only 7 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: S will like dummy  |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: they play smith so the @S may suggest a switch |pg||
nt|lml: @S8|pg||
nt|sybarra: will likely cash a and k of spades to avoid lots of ruffs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: 2@D sets up the game force, now with @D stopped E rebids 2NT and now W shows the good @S suit, and E elects 3NT.|pg||
nt|kemperg: but @H is the right defense|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lml: yes but that is not completely clear to Fisher|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|psyck: this should now come home with 5@s, 2@d, 2@c in due course of time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Much friendlier to receive a @C lead into E in 3NT than from N through E in 4@S.  They had a really nice auction.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|lml: this is still okay but they do have to get back to hearts|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: need to go back to hearts now|pg||
nt|lml: Hamilton might work it out.  Partner is very likely to have four hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Freddie's playing with the cards|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: ok will cash 3 spade|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: claim 7 and next|pg||

pc|dA|pc|h3|nt|psyck: other table just went to 3N w/o looking for a @s contract, likely hoping to run the @s's in NT |pg||
nt|jcwla: Also reasonable but I would give this auction slightly higher marks.|pg||
nt|psyck: ya was nice of W to involve pd in the decision here|pg||

nt|kemperg: no score|pg||

nt|sybarra: its connected to the Marriott right?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Likely a 1@D opening intending to rebid 2NT over pd's response; here none is forthcoming.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|psyck: apparently they only need 13 cards to respond at this vul|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the modern game it is just detested to pass pd's opening.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Yes! The host suite has two 36" tvs with BBO!|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bunch of hts here for e/w |pg||
nt|casenjo:  I am on WIFI in the hotel lobby|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: support double likely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks for me easier than 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: redouble that is|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now how do you feel about making the support redouble vs. bidding the 2NT (with the possibility of finding out about @H's later)?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  excuse me 56" |pg||
nt|sybarra: I operated a tourney there a couple of years ago |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: xx better|pg||
nt|lml: 3@D seems reasonable but they will end up in notrump about now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcwla: What's the rationale?|pg||
nt|psyck: you can always bid NT to show your values later|pg||
nt|psyck: this gives more room for more options|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: he has managed both at 2 level, whereas if 2NT 1st, yet to show support...|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is Wolff.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@C forcing 3@D then W will go back to 3@H (or conceivably pass).|pg||
nt|kemperg: E worried about @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: like the Nationals |pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: ok, W doubled N's 3@c|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, ok, Wolff sighoff sequence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: any objections?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think we're missing a pass here.|pg||
nt|psyck: W's x says i like to bid|pg||
nt|lml: but Fisher know that |pg||
nt|lml: his partner is worried about the majors one or both|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|jcwla: Might pass to keep the big hand decl.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s8|nt|jcwla: OK so 3@D it is with that beautiful dummy coming down.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d2|pc|h7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: E will not be expecting the world in dummy on this auction anyway|pg||
nt|jcwla: If W had passed 1@D, what do you like by N in 4th chair?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|psyck: tuf, pass likely|pg||
nt|psyck: some days i may try 1N or 2@c :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Pass would not be my choice.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have the master suit so not afraid of something like their finding a @H fit.|pg||
nt|psyck: at this vul, most days i'd pass though|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have good values and pd's pass over 1@D could be hiding as much as an opener.|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: the only problem on this board is to avoid a @s slam|pg||
nt|casenjo:  there have been some very big hands in both the Seniors and the Women's events|pg||

mb|2S!|an|clubs I think|nt|casenjo:  6NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: that works |pg||
mb|3C!|an|positive for clubs|nt|lml: Clerkin likes to open very light even when in another chair|pg||
nt|lml: here 1@H is mostly for the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: i'm not a bid fan of jumping with 4 cards and bal hands|pg||
nt|jcwla: E will open 1NT with a max, W will invite and they will settle comfortably in 3NT that depends on the lead.|pg||
nt|lml: In the Open Room Wolff opened Clerkin's hand 2@H.  What do you think of that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: played by W,  a spade lead could messup  6 nt |pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: better than 1@H|pg||
nt|lml: I agree.  I like it better and I think it is a good thought in third chair|pg||
nt|lml: it did get them too high|pg||
nt|lml: the opponents|pg||
mb|4C|nt|psyck: would you open 1N or 1@d here?|pg||
nt|jcwla: W might just blast - but E wants to be in vul games as much as W.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: some players makes a false cue in @h on a hand like W|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: you dont often see strong jump shift anymore  |pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|jcwla: This is 9 with some downgrades.  As long as your style is to accept invites with anything but a dead min (as it should be), an invite is plenty in my book.|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case S does not find the magic @S lead and score it up.|pg||
nt|psyck: i would have probably opened 1@d all A's & K's & 5 card suit...|pg||
nt|psyck: agree, maybe vul game so just blasted|pg||
nt|sybarra: a sigh of relief when the club Q comes down |pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: sometimes i belong to them:)|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: on a different day, stopping in 3@d would have been a success with opps taking 1st 5 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not on a club back|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like to err on the side of 1NT on close decisions.  Something newer players would do well to do.  Think how comfortable you feel when partner opens 1NT.  You've asserted claim to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: the hand, you know your structure very well, you're primed for a nice, intelligent auction.   You just don't feel the same sense of feet on the ground with a 1@D opening.|pg||

nt|psyck: in a regular pdship however, i would value that hand to be more than 18 & open accordingly :)|pg||

nt|lml: 2NT gets your high cards across|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jcwla: A quiet pass there...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@D is the par|pg||
nt|lml: I think Fisher will not sell out|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|sybarra: these can often be interesting contracts,   |pg||
nt|sybarra: N will be a bit disappointed that the ht honors are in dummy |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|psyck: very friendly lie of cards|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well maybe 4H  D is  par   :0|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: On a hand where you have to play the @D's yourself for one loser, you would double finesse, starting with the @DQ from the E hand, running it if not covered, then if it loses to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: @DK hook for the @DJ.  Lose only to @D K, J in N.  Much better than @D to A then low back and try to guess which to put in.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: yes north south stole the pot in 2@H in the Open Room|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: but didn´t|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 4H can be held at 9 tricks if opps find the club ruff    not easy|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@D was not easy to bid|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sorry 8 tr|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: bd 48, they tried 7 nt in the other room |pg||
nt|sybarra: that did not make  (where "we" played 6 @C)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sorry...I hit a wrong button, got behind and can't catch up|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is ok,   |pg||
nt|sybarra: can happen |pg||
nt|sybarra: we will see the results when he claims |pg||

pc|c2|nt|jcwla: In my opinion, W forgot to bid here and this will double the Levine lead.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: and now -1|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|psyck: right, suprising that W who kept bidding open with a yarborough would not bid on 2@s here|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|hT|pc|s6|nt|noodle:  i suspect mike an PO play a simpler game than mike and haydn|pg||

pc|c5|nt|kirp:  3NT in other room failed miserably|pg||

nt|psyck: thx Jordan|pg||
nt|lml: don't they have a spade a heart and 2 clubs anyway|pg||
nt|lml: right :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice wild board again|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcwla: So long for now.|pg||
nt|kemperg: hands getting more interesting|pg||
nt|lml: 2@S was opened at both tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: its an exception to the idea about not open two of one major with length in the other|pg||
nt|007 joosth: today even a 5card H is aloowed at the w2|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y  sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Opening bids getting lighter and lighter|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|kemperg: for me 2@C, both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 4S is cold I think.   with a diamond lead even 11 tr|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 @H less 2@S|pg||
nt|007 joosth: in Netherlands many players will open 2C yes|pg||
nt|lml: I think any leads|pg||
nt|lml: well if you have the bid you should use it :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|007 joosth: y indeed always 11|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D  looks inverted,   (good hand) |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: trying to head to 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|psyck: a more inspired lead reqd here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psyck: not possible to get to 5m instead of 3N with normal methods i guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: the pattern is attractive for opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: when Dennis bid 3NT....Danny said, "You said the magic words, partner"|pg||

nt|sybarra: now just have to find 9 tricks|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|d2|pc|cQ|pg||
mc|11|nt|psyck: some open 1@c instead of 1@d with 44 in minors, that may help get them to a superior game this deal, not that it mattered here|pg||
nt|sybarra: did he miscount?|pg||
