mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  in @S at least|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: Yes, well the obvious doubleton club lead beats 4@S ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|bjacobs: But the 5@S contract they are about to reach is more interesting|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hawe45:  South could have bid 4 @C - no risk to stay there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And South decides to point the way|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: I must say I sympathize with East's slamming|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Berten's pass of 4@S was remarkable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although, I just noticed North had opened with ONE heart, so I guess he had a clue that West might be aceless|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|hawe45:  BertenÂ´s pass - are we 5 players now?|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Well, you could write a book on that auction, but don't have the time|pg||
nt|imp_jan: agree hans, i like 5@H more, probably he wanted to bid clubs at the five level in between|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's pretty safe to say that no one knew who would make what, or why|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: we have to wait, south called the TD...|pg||
nt|imp_jan: pls keep us updated on that Lukas|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: yes, sure|pg||
nt|imp_jan: excellent 6@C by east btw|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But anyway, N/S will rarely have a @H-trick after 3 @H from North - so South might accept, that the opponents have at least 920|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Its because of the X on 5@c|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He couldn't have the ace?  And East did Blackwood, indicating that he didn't have a void heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Zorlu wrote: I believe even 0-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: DOPE|pg||
nt|imp_jan: no ruffs that way (he thought) little did the table know that NS cld make a heart trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "Double Odd, Pass Even"|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Jansma is telling that he got a wrong information|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Who's his screenmate?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: whatever info Jansma got, he was convinced NOT scoring a heart trick in defence|pg||

nt|imp_jan: why not raising to 4 as South?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In both hands (1 & 2) opening 1 @H was an option, in 1 it should bestandard|pg||

nt|vugraphzgf: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@H= 0-3 HCP|pg||
nt|avivs:  superaccepting gets them too high|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If 15-17 - this is a very hard 3 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: it is 15-17|pg||
nt|avivs:  I don't like super accepting with very soft minimum values|pg||

nt|avivs:  so far not very good judgment by N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Especially after, what happened at board 9, I would have settled for some normal bids here|pg||
nt|peachy: Depends on their superaccept structure.  Some folks just superaccept with 4 always, some with just max, etc.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C 10 = @S, partner|pg||
nt|avivs:  @cT just show 9|pg||

nt|peachy: Normally, third hand shows attitude, unless dummy/bidding/other clues make it unnecessary, in which case the second card is rither count or suit preference, depending on agreement|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: Well he hasn't made 3NT yet, but it's going to be difficult for West to hold it together|pg||

nt|hawe45:  They are about to finisch in CR - do the play the same boards as here...?|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And that's a good duck.  If he plays a second diamond, West can clear the suit and avoid the endplay|pg||
nt|imp_jan: still 8 tricks.. good point Bill|pg||
nt|imp_jan: if decl took first heart, east likely to be squeezed in hearts and clubs (all crds open-analysis)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So now, he needs to guess the spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Low to the 10, I suppose|pg||
nt|imp_jan: very difficult|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right ... the 8 and 7 give him options|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But you can tell (from the pause) that Paulissen senses the risk in playing a second diamond|pg||
nt|imp_jan: may be @SQ if west covers, decl may assume that @CK is in west (otherwise 1NT overcall)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You mean East?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it's true, declarer doesn't really know where @CK is.  But I think he must assume it's onside, otherwise 3NT is just too hard to make|pg||
nt|stc: with K@c in W and K@S in E you also have chances|pg||
nt|stc: hi |pg||
nt|bjacobs: When you're in a bad contract (we've all been there), best to assume some sort of friendly layout|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hi|pg||
nt|stc: another line was to win @d in N, finesse ¨c again and endplay W|pg||
nt|imp_jan: that is a very good point Constantin|pg||
nt|stc: ducking the 1st @h was also not ideal, but he can't know about @h 6-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No question that was what looked right seeing all 4 hands.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: And I suspect declarer is regretting not having called for a LOW diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|stc: as cards lie covering the 9@d was also OK|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: difficult problem for west now - he doesn't want to hear 5@H from his partner, so double might not appeal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good practical bidding by South - with game E/W (also)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: but as a passed hand partner is perhaps less likely to bid 5@H - if he pulls the double it will generally be with a 3- or 2-suiter, with 4NT, which would be fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Easy...|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|avivs:  lucky 3NT|pg||
nt|avivs:  I would not want to be there looking just at the N/S hands|pg||
nt|avivs:  another push coming on board 11 with E/W in 4@s at other room|pg||
nt|avivs:  this is actually not cold|pg||
nt|avivs:  he will need to go after clubs (likely)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You must guess the @S and decide, which minor has H x by West|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hawe45:  This will cost 550 - if...|pg||
nt|athene: double is "action" - just takeout-ish, saying he has a good 4@S opener|pg||
nt|athene: north thinks he has a choice now: -500 or -550? :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seen from the North-seat, South shall bring three tricks in the side-suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|avivs:  better chances for Hx in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: if you decide that east has Hx in a minor you can start leading a small one from hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|athene: townsend expected a lot of shape for the 5-level overcall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Poor East - he liked his @S-singleton|pg||
nt|athene: he isn't sure if 6@D will make and he isn't sure if 5@S will|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats 3c?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|vugraphzgf: till now, every bid was alerted|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: probably they are both down but he doesn't want to take the chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: long way to 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 3@D no 5 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 3@H = 5@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont see the point|pg||
nt|ianmcc: me neither transfer doesn't reveal West's hearts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bernix: i just wondered what 2@h meant|pg||
nt|avivs:  the only clue he has is that East has 1 extra heart...|pg||
nt|athene: if he starts with the @DJ and east ducks smoothly he might play west for @DKQ and take another finesse|pg||
nt|avivs:  now will test spades|pg||
nt|avivs:  and when they break 3-3 will finesse West|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with 1NT-2H    2S-3D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzgf: W just asked|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He has only the winning line to play - |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With a rather poor @D-suit, East might have expected mor high cards by partner|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too simple for experts i suppose|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think he'll trumps hearts to dummy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he can play it any aul way my granny will make this one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: granny would know about the black pictures|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think it says - lets impress the viewers with our esoteric system|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no point in learning all this stuff if you don't use it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|bernix: a likely push|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||

pc|h4|pc|c5|nt|athene: it's very hard not to pitch from your 5-card suit first|pg||
nt|peachy: Live eunning scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/GBT_2011/11_06_03_team.html|pg||
nt|athene: so when west lets a diamond go, declarer will surely play him for long diamonds|pg||

nt|athene: west has a plan|pg||
nt|athene: give his partner a club ruff|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|avivs:  the way this session is going for them he should have bid this 25% slam...|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: in textbookland when opps bid and raise clubs, and you have four, you know you can give partner a second-round ruff|pg||
nt|avivs:  50% that the @sK is one of the missing KCs and not off 2 aces and 50% that its on side|pg||
nt|athene: sadly in the real world, things don't work out so well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just the 2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ianmcc: @h9 now damaging|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: Bakhshi thinks that the lead was a singleton so taking the trump finesse is more likely to run into a club ruff, i guess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Are the players still at the table?|pg||

nt|athene: now declarer knows east had 1-6 in the red suits|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a dream come true in the spade suit, needs to guess (no guess really) ace and then hope for J10 tight or A doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: he knows that of course if east has a small singleton spade a spade switch at trick 3 would have beaten the contract|pg||
nt|avivs:  Thanks to Bill, Raija  and hans and also to Anna our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: but that doesn't mean you should definitely not play for that because it's not so clearcut for east to shift to the spade|pg||

nt|hawe45:  In open room plays was like here. But then West took the @S Ace over the king - and played another @S. The finesse = 1 down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: handed a win and threw it back|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the 5-level, white vs white is a nogo zone|pg||
