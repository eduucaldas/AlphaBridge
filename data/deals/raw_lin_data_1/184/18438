mb|p|nt|kfung: i thought so|pg||
mb|3C|nt|junka: good set by teens...Barros&Furlan...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|stewball: 3@c,3@d,2@h 1@s?|pg||

mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzcw: Turner shaking head about last hand|pg||
nt|kfung: mcavoy takes a forced preference|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kfung: i think turner may have miscounted|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jbennet: incredible not to bid 4 sp|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfung: because of the fatigue|pg||
nt|stewball: well Hughes is an excellent partner,he will not judge i'm sure|pg||
nt|kfung: 10 of hearts turns out to be a golden card in the S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfung: club lead makes this hand easier|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh my!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone.  this could be 20 imps, unless east had found @S underlead|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like a "Smolen" sequence (4 cards in bid major, 5+ in other)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: 3nt was a lot easier, and might have been bid over 2@D|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbennet: knowing about maximum NT and 4 c support. |pg||

pc|sK|nt|jbennet: well deserved -12 |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The East hand is not as good as it may look. Only 20.95 on the KnR, mainly because of the KQ doubleton|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|kfung: this may be another huge pick up for rayner|pg||
nt|stewball: wonder why he didnt cash a @c first|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like a coffee hand, but at the speed these guys play, better have it brewed in advance|pg||

mb|3C!|an|Jac. + Singl|mb|3N!|nt|Walddk2: 7@D is a good save|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't know what 3@C is|pg||
mb|4C|nt|othered1: unusual NT actually increases the value of south's hand significantly, since it's likely there are no minor suit losers.  |pg||
mb|5D|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|starkist: strong @c so maks not forced to resp with 6 points like the rest of us mortals|pg||
nt|stewball: N ocalled in the other room|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the other room n overcalled that stalwart @s suit and the auction got a little out of hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart raise and an unspecified singleton it appears|pg||
nt|othered1: classical theory says not to begin cue-bidding with a void, as partner may misevaluate secondary honors in that suit.  But when east has shown the suit, it's a different situation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Campos will take the save|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: not|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|kfung: jack of spades lead would have made this a very tough hand|pg||
nt|kfung: with 3 losers off the top even if you find the queen of hearts.... the tap suit is important|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|psyck: I'm told it doesn't, so just min values maybe|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|psyck: other table were sort of pushed into slam, here they have to explore on their own|pg||
