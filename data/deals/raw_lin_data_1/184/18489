nt|phil: well...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lost my connection there. Rehi all, hi Phil.|pg||
nt|peachy: Not raising hearts here could be additional evidence that NS more frequently than others would overcall 4-card suit on the one level|pg||
nt|stc: if they guess @h :(|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|phil: theres some problems with 3-1 trump and 4-2/5-1 clubs I think|pg||
nt|phil: hey Jordan|pg||
nt|santyclz: @c lead would have been a problem and it's certainly a reasonable lead.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Certainly sounded like a trump lead on the auction.|pg||

pc|c7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|phil: yes, especially with a quick re-rentry, but J-x is not an appealing holding|pg||
