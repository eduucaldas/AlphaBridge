nt|lml: yes|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lml: cashing the @CA is better but it didnt matter since trump split|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: isn´t 2@s too weak? 3@s for me|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kirp:  2@S may be better than 3|pg||
nt|lml: it is a constructive 4 card raise and if you have methods for that you should use it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kirp:  Good stop|pg||
nt|lml: most of these chaps play 3@S is preemptive|pg||

nt|jbennet: this hand belongs to NS.|pg||
nt|ralphk: 1d-p1h-x,2d-p-3d all pass?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jbennet: they sold out to 2 d which with 4504 is favourite to be a losing decison.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jbennet: and duly costed a partscore swing. |pg||
nt|jbennet: many books says "go for the forcing game" with trumf length.|pg||
nt|jbennet: those who follow those recommendations will the hard way find out that own ruffs works better.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ralphk: lots of points but no aces in east's hand.|pg||
nt|jbennet: a surprise bid from east.|pg||
nt|ralphk: 3nt by west might just make.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralphk: by east, south will certainly lead a club.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|ralphk: Very good lead. I like leading the stronger suit.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ralphk: Might look riskier, but you need less from partner for it to be right.|pg||
nt|ralphk: -2 if they do not block the club suit.|pg||
nt|jbennet: ace less and a singleton king. even with 5-c h with west a heart contract would be tough too handle|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: This is the last board of the set - third quarter will start at 6:00 Detroit time, about 2 hours and 20 minutes from now - hope to see you all then|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Miner actually led the diamond from his hand, but Passell accepted the lead by following with the spade 6|pg||

nt|larrymori: seems that way|pg||
nt|lml: who managed to keep pace with the "fast" pace of the Seniors|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  Passell had a pre-empt of sorts|pg||
