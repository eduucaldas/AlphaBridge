nt|sybarra: not sure how you would ever stay out of game on that hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Vladimir Machat|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and more action here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: can they stop in 5d|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: 3S?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: m,e nayther - nor this one but just look at that 5- break|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: 4S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But the @S-singleton might be led, and that disturbs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ntmon: hi to everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@H= 0-3 HCP|pg||
nt|avivs:  superaccepting gets them too high|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If 15-17 - this is a very hard 3 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: it is 15-17|pg||
nt|avivs:  I don't like super accepting with very soft minimum values|pg||
nt|peachy: Lucky they do not play Texas then, it would relaly be too high\|pg||
nt|peachy: really|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You see the problem, poor North may bid 4 now|pg||
nt|peachy: I think not, not a single control anywhere|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4S?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and can defence play on H - good hand this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: West will look for 3NT first|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: an exellent 4 hts here, looking only at the e/w hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: well my c key seems to be reluctant today|pg||
pc|sT|nt|avivs:  he is thinking if he can go back to 2@h somehow... :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: at last|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT looks Ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: can he make this?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|avivs:  guess not|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Anna|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS a married couple, playing Acol with weak NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have a spec that says yes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzgf: :)|pg||
nt|avivs:  so far not very good judgment by N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Especially after, what happened at board 9, I would have settled for some normal bids here|pg||
nt|peachy: Depends on their superaccept structure.  Some folks just superaccept with 4 always, some with just max, etc.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C 10 = @S, partner|pg||
nt|avivs:  @cT just show 9|pg||
nt|avivs:  denies Jack|pg||
nt|peachy: Normally, third hand shows attitude, unless dummy/bidding/other clues make it unnecessary, in which case the second card is rither count or suit preference, depending on agreement|pg||
nt|peachy: the card (not second card)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: certainly is now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ianmcc: likely to make|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: can but wont i bet|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mind you i never like 3nt with a void when they have a 5-4 d fit|pg||

nt|sybarra: much easier for us at the vantage point |pg||
nt|jcomyn: you really would be playing balcony finesses if you made this one|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the natural instinct is to cash 1 ht,  dont you John?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and perhaps the best play |pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: avoiding over ruff with singleton (whatever) |pg||
pc|c9|nt|avivs:  the english pair got to 3NT E/W on board 9|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|h8|pc|d8|pg||

nt|ianmcc: cards friendly for N/S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can make 3 but not likely to bid it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WHACK|pg||
nt|ianmcc: must X as he thought they could make 3NT|pg||
nt|rmb1: Defending avoids having to make 3NT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|avivs:  unlucky mirror distribution doomes 4@s here|pg||

pc|d2|nt|ntmon: no balancing here|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Now they get 50|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good bidding by South|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double - stop the world, please (with that suit and that hand)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

nt|jcomyn: dont understand this - they know peanly is inevitable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: penalty|pg||
nt|rmb1: Does anyone know if 4@C was systemically the majors or just an improvisation?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be majors and|pg||
nt|ianmcc: why would anyone carry a convention for this situation?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: running scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/GBT_2011/11_06_03_team.html|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Yes - but South still has the same hand...|pg||

nt|avivs:  2@c natural?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no good lead to 4@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: E will worry aboput H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think south would bid 2@S facing just any random 16+ hand - he must feel it is roughly shape-suitable|pg||

nt|santyclz: Panama.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|hawe45:  No loosing option in 4 @S - but E/W might bid a lot also|pg||

nt|rmb1: Sorry folks, got to go, bye|pg||
nt|ianmcc: slam dodgy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so is life|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: difficult problem for west now - he doesn't want to hear 5@H from his partner, so double might not appeal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good practical bidding by South - with game E/W (also)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: but as a passed hand partner is perhaps less likely to bid 5@H - if he pulls the double it will generally be with a 3- or 2-suiter, with 4NT, which would be fine|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@H= 5@S+4@H, 7-10 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Easy...|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|avivs:  lucky 3NT|pg||

nt|avivs:  this is actually not cold|pg||
nt|avivs:  he will need to go after clubs (likely)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You must guess the @S and decide, which minor has H x by West|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This will cost 550 - if...|pg||
nt|athene: double is "action" - just takeout-ish, saying he has a good 4@S opener|pg||
nt|athene: north thinks he has a choice now: -500 or -550? :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seen from the North-seat, South shall bring three tricks in the side-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Well, almost 7-10 hcp,anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: but likes the shape |pg||

nt|ianmcc: me neither transfer doesn't reveal West's hearts|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bernix: i just wondered what 2@h meant|pg||
nt|avivs:  the only clue he has is that East has 1 extra heart...|pg||
nt|athene: if he starts with the @DJ and east ducks smoothly he might play west for @DKQ and take another finesse|pg||
nt|avivs:  now will test spades|pg||

nt|jcomyn: he can play it any aul way my granny will make this one|pg||

pc|h5|nt|athene: in textbookland when opps bid and raise clubs, and you have four, you know you can give partner a second-round ruff|pg||
nt|avivs:  50% that the @sK is one of the missing KCs and not off 2 aces and 50% that its on side|pg||

nt|athene: anyway double having splintered shows his hand pretty well|pg||
nt|athene: overbidding a bit to be sure of reaching the right strain|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bd 4  (the ugly 4 @H)  gave Neth. +10 |pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: h has already shown his hand this HAS to be penalties|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: a slam should not be missed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: got there!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps 4@D is too much - partner might play you for a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that some soprt of bergen from E if it is its dsaft|pg||
nt|ianmcc: these raises are overdone|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: must say,  not sure I would considered a trump shift here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bernix: this may help south|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gwan try anopther|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: couldnt agree more but it worked why i have no idea - THAT X HAS to be penalties|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|ntmon: 5@S asking for good trumps|pg||
nt|ntmon: the answer is yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If North plays later on @S to the King, West shall duck smoothly...!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: yes, that would be nice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: e had enough of the nonsense|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: so bye for now|pg||
nt|bernix: bye all|pg||
nt|ntmon: bye all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: why lose patience?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: vul v not i suppose|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: nad pard didnt get it |pg||
nt|sybarra: *and |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|athene: but would east really make a weak jump oevrcall with six solid AND @SA?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: and now netherlands win|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this hand shows that this 4-4 fit things is grossly exaggerated|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the late great Monty Rosenberg alwsays said 4-4 fits are for babies|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The rule for West: Never take a trick, without having a good reason to do it|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer knows east had 1-6 in the red suits|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a dream come true in the spade suit, needs to guess (no guess really) ace and then hope for J10 tight or A doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: he knows that of course if east has a small singleton spade a spade switch at trick 3 would have beaten the contract|pg||
nt|avivs:  Thanks to Bill, Raija  and hans and also to Anna our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: but that doesn't mean you should definitely not play for that because it's not so clearcut for east to shift to the spade|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c3|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to John and Joe  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and also specs with all the great comments |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|hawe45:  In open room plays was like here. But then West took the @S Ace over the king - and played another @S. The finesse = 1 down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: handed a win and threw it back|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the 5-level, white vs white is a nogo zone|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hear hear|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|avivs:  must go now (kids are up from their nap...)|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks everybody, thanks kibitzers and hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: bye for now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bye aLL|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good night and thanks|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: why in heavens name would  force S to bid when he knows cant have anything on the biodding|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: ok well now he ain't going wrong|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|d5|pc|cT|pg||
