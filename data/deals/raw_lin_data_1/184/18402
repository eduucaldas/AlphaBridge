mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No loosing option in 4 @S - but E/W might bid a lot also|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: difficult problem for west now - he doesn't want to hear 5@H from his partner, so double might not appeal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good practical bidding by South - with game E/W (also)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: but as a passed hand partner is perhaps less likely to bid 5@H - if he pulls the double it will generally be with a 3- or 2-suiter, with 4NT, which would be fine|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This will cost 550 - if...|pg||
