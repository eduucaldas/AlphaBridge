nt|jtr: Wild hand|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Very good nresult for the Dutch|pg||
nt|jtr: @cK led next door!|pg||
nt|Walddk6: That helped|pg||
nt|henryb:  I see the dealing machine is on a distributional kick|pg||
nt|jtr: That didnt paralyse declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: I doubt you can make it on any other lead|pg||

nt|athene: now 4@S from east, and @CK lead :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Might well get a trump lead if so|pg||
nt|Walddk6: That will normally trigger a trump lead|pg||
nt|athene: maybe a trump lead is better though|pg||
nt|jtr: Both red suits locked-up|pg||
nt|athene: north should know (or at least strongly suspect) that west has a black two-suiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: I would not guess 6-6|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so you either lead a red suit and try to force him or you lead a trump|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|s3|pg||

mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: Yes, well the obvious doubleton club lead beats 4@S ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: But the 5@S contract they are about to reach is more interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  South could have bid 4 @C - no risk to stay there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And South decides to point the way|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: I must say I sympathize with East's slamming|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Berten's pass of 4@S was remarkable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although, I just noticed North had opened with ONE heart, so I guess he had a clue that West might be aceless|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tejjyid:  a lot to be said for a trump lead, even b4 seeing summy|pg||

nt|vugraphzge: no TD-decission now, maybe later|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: so lets play the next board :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If he got "even key cards", and they do play DOPE, there has been no misinformation|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: There has only been a "bad" bid by East|pg||

nt|bjacobs: I don't like DOPE, by the way.  For starters, how was East to know for sure whether it was 0 or 2?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: why not raising to 4 as South?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In both hands (1 & 2) opening 1 @H was an option, in 1 it should bestandard|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||

nt|santyclz: Agreed.|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually I am with you,   i know where I live (clubs) |pg||
nt|tejjyid:  these hands are actually easy to defend; on lead you cash an Ace & then the switch is easy|pg||
mb|5C|nt|imp_jan: 1@S = 3 by South (with 4 he bids 2@S)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i think (i play that)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: yes, i think so too|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  gambling NT is good for stories, but not so good for score|pg||

pc|sA|nt|imp_jan: who wants to miss non vul game on min values, not paulissen :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Maybe Paulissen thinks: Better make a game than go down in a part-score|pg||
nt|imp_jan: potential gain for NL|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  I would aslo have bid 3@S on the NOrth cars over 3@H - but ti depends on agreements|pg||
nt|sybarra: now lets see if Westra can make this |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Without much risk!|pg||
nt|imp_jan: bidding in CR too intelligent for me|pg||
nt|imp_jan: cant explain, sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: had to guess qx of @D with S |pg||
nt|santyclz: Have to work at it to go down.|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  Does he have an option to go down?|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: double dummy no problem :)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sybarra: with no entries to dummy may have no choice|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: Well he hasn't made 3NT yet, but it's going to be difficult for West to hold it together|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They are about to finisch in CR - do the play the same boards as here...?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|imp_jan: club finesse now i gather|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And that's a good duck.  If he plays a second diamond, West can clear the suit and avoid the endplay|pg||
nt|imp_jan: still 8 tricks.. good point Bill|pg||
nt|imp_jan: if decl took first heart, east likely to be squeezed in hearts and clubs (all crds open-analysis)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So now, he needs to guess the spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Low to the 10, I suppose|pg||
nt|imp_jan: very difficult|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right ... the 8 and 7 give him options|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But you can tell (from the pause) that Paulissen senses the risk in playing a second diamond|pg||
nt|imp_jan: may be @SQ if west covers, decl may assume that @CK is in west (otherwise 1NT overcall)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You mean East?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it's true, declarer doesn't really know where @CK is.  But I think he must assume it's onside, otherwise 3NT is just too hard to make|pg||
nt|stc: with K@c in W and K@S in E you also have chances|pg||
nt|stc: hi |pg||
nt|bjacobs: When you're in a bad contract (we've all been there), best to assume some sort of friendly layout|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hi|pg||
nt|stc: another line was to win @d in N, finesse ¨c again and endplay W|pg||
nt|imp_jan: that is a very good point Constantin|pg||
nt|stc: ducking the 1st @h was also not ideal, but he can't know about @h 6-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No question that was what looked right seeing all 4 hands.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: And I suspect declarer is regretting not having called for a LOW diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|stc: as cards lie covering the 9@d was also OK|pg||

nt|jtr: Wow another enormous Dutch result|pg||
nt|henryb:  Both distribution and high cards|pg||
nt|athene: east in the other room decided if his partner could bid 6, and he had ALL the keycards, he could give it a seventh|pg||
nt|athene: i think there was a certain amount of luck there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk6: The more I look at the E-W hands, the worse the grand slam gets|pg||
nt|athene: (if anyone is wondering about the closed room auction, i assume 3@C was puppet stayman, 3@D promised a 4-card major, and 4@D showed both and asked partner to pick)|pg||
nt|henryb:  stop looking then|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jtr: No excuse for bidding the 7th except that it worked|pg||

nt|athene: this is a very difficult hand to play|pg||
nt|jtr: Ruff @c and run @s10 looks best to me|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||

nt|henryb:  Oh, I feel sure that my mother could manage|pg||
