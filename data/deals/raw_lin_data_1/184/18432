mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: 1@S= no major|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @S might be a better bid by West - sometimes keeping N/S out of 3 NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and s of course law of total tricvks and all that|pg||

nt|Walddk5: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/GBT_2011/11_06_03_team.html|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 4S?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hawe45:  But the @S-singleton might be led, and that disturbs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: hi to everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@H= 0-3 HCP|pg||
nt|avivs:  superaccepting gets them too high|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If 15-17 - this is a very hard 3 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: it is 15-17|pg||
nt|avivs:  I don't like super accepting with very soft minimum values|pg||
nt|peachy: Lucky they do not play Texas then, it would relaly be too high\|pg||
nt|peachy: really|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You see the problem, poor North may bid 4 now|pg||
nt|peachy: I think not, not a single control anywhere|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4S?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and can defence play on H - good hand this|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rmb1: West will look for 3NT first|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: an exellent 4 hts here, looking only at the e/w hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: well my c key seems to be reluctant today|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And what is lucky by that tactic, most spectatorÂ´s might learn a lot from the dutch standard!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not strange but a change is as good as a rest|pg||
mb|p|nt|avivs:  he is thinking if he can go back to 2@h somehow... :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: at last|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT looks Ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: can he make this?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|avivs:  guess not|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, there we go|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Was the diner with red wine?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @S-lead ducked twice|pg||
nt|mrxxx: if westra had passed 3nt would have been more difficult i presume, north has a 1nt opening and south may have had too little for an invite|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk5: Hi Anna|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS a married couple, playing Acol with weak NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have a spec that says yes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzgf: :)|pg||
nt|avivs:  so far not very good judgment by N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Especially after, what happened at board 9, I would have settled for some normal bids here|pg||
nt|peachy: Depends on their superaccept structure.  Some folks just superaccept with 4 always, some with just max, etc.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C 10 = @S, partner|pg||
nt|avivs:  @cT just show 9|pg||
nt|avivs:  denies Jack|pg||
nt|peachy: Normally, third hand shows attitude, unless dummy/bidding/other clues make it unnecessary, in which case the second card is rither count or suit preference, depending on agreement|pg||
nt|peachy: the card (not second card)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: certainly is now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ianmcc: likely to make|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can but wont i bet|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: mind you i never like 3nt with a void when they have a 5-4 d fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know Huub plays the spots off the cards, but this may be a tall order even for him |pg||
nt|athene: now you would like to run the @C8 to guard against 4-1 break|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: (Huub=Bertens) |pg||
nt|athene: but you are a bit short of entries to dummy for that sort of luxury|pg||
nt|hawe45:  8 tricks now - but where there are 8, often we see 9|pg||
nt|athene: south will come under too much pressure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He allready is|pg||
nt|athene: if a defender has to guard three suits, it almost always spells doom|pg||

nt|sybarra: much easier for us at the vantage point |pg||
nt|jcomyn: you really would be playing balcony finesses if you made this one|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the natural instinct is to cash 1 ht,  dont you John?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and perhaps the best play |pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: avoiding over ruff with singleton (whatever) |pg||

nt|jcomyn: some number of nt|pg||

nt|ianmcc: 3NT hard work|pg||

nt|jcomyn: no way e passes but now what|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sacrificial offering|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is W passing?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: could do least of a bad lot|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 2nt?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: cards friendly for N/S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can make 3 but not likely to bid it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WHACK|pg||
nt|ianmcc: must X as he thought they could make 3NT|pg||
nt|rmb1: Defending avoids having to make 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: the @HK10 was a threat over south|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if they bid - and easily make - 3 NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: love to know how many 3NT bids there were today|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With this leade 460|pg||

nt|jcomyn: imagine that|pg||
nt|mrxxx: well what to lead :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ntmon: no balancing here|pg||
nt|ntmon: may be well a push, 2@H+1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would have liked to play 5 in a minor E/W here...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now they get 50|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good bidding by South|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double - stop the world, please (with that suit and that hand)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hawe45:  Oh - doubled = no 50, but 100 and still a very bad score|pg||
nt|athene: three hearts, four clubs, two diamonds, two spades thanks to the @H8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double-dummy it works fine to take 4 x @C|pg||
nt|athene: the only way the defence can give declarer a problem in this sort of hand is hold up their winner in the red suit he attacks|pg||
nt|athene: and threaten to set up a long card there with the other red winner as entry|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: an yone go along with the theory when you hold a singleton of p's suit and 6 pts youn pass|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: fryin pasn into the fire|pg||
nt|jcomyn: digging a large hole|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hot pan|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW have tried their 6 card fits, will they try a 7 card fit?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont understand this - they know peanly is inevitable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: penalty|pg||
nt|rmb1: Does anyone know if 4@C was systemically the majors or just an improvisation?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be majors and|pg||
nt|ianmcc: why would anyone carry a convention for this situation?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: running scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/GBT_2011/11_06_03_team.html|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hope w knows that or throats cut|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: well it's not THAT bad is it? EW can't make 5 of anything?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: might as well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes pushed themselves there|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: but as the cards lie there is nothing to be done as both entries are with the short diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|rmb1: XX would be foolish in less experienced partnership|pg||

nt|ianmcc: must hook|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no point in running this|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kinda slow this pair|pg||
nt|mrxxx: with favourable vulnarability 1nt could be bid on "anything" just trying to keep the opponents out of the bidding|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ianmcc: could just make it if hooks|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  Declarer allready knows, that East can not have the long @C-suit|pg||

nt|jcomyn: back to the auld favourite|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no bad breaks this time so 4h or 4s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and a slam - way hey|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  OK - we are closed room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mrxxx: woehoe !|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|avivs:  Bakhshi earned 10 Imps for responding to 1@c and keeping opponents out of bidding on board 9|pg||
nt|avivs:  lead directing 1@c opening|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|athene: i would not argue with double from south|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or something butchedred|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: near-enough an opening bid and 44 in the unbid suits|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: and no sinecure|pg||
nt|Walddk7: wlc back to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|mrxxx: naah this will just end in 6@s|pg||
nt|mrxxx: or 6nt :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5 or 6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: like to see 2cX for fun|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: north's double here tends to be t/o of hearts, but he feels it's ok with such a strong hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might end the bidding|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - brave man in South|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: x means 16+|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT looks OK|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he wants a bit more, vul against not|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: we could not the bidding at other table but similar proceedings expected as here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - but South still has the same hand...|pg||
nt|avivs:  I assume 1D would show unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|avivs:  2@c natural?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no good lead to 4@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: E will worry aboput H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think south would bid 2@S facing just any random 16+ hand - he must feel it is roughly shape-suitable|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps he just thinks well, neither opp bid spades, partner must have 'em :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi santa|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: hi|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well now he knows where HK is|pg||
nt|mrxxx: true|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sybarra: sorry all,  had to leave for a moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 1@C= at least 2|pg||
nt|avivs:  E/W stole the pot here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S obviously artificial|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@S= relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 3@D shortness|pg||
nt|robdonk: diff. to bid 7@S now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i think it is easier|pg||
mb|4D|nt|santyclz: Basically have to pick up the @ss for no losers.|pg||
nt|athene: it will also ask if he has 3 trumps or 4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good to have East as declarer - a trump-lead could give problems - if from North|pg||
nt|athene: i would imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: south explained it at 16+|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no problem now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 7 @S is a fair contract - but only with @S 2-2!|pg||
nt|mrxxx: you will have to get rid of 3 hearts on the diamonds, so diamond queen has ruffed out or found over east|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If N/S should bid 7 @S - which I DOÂ´NOT think - West will regret his 1 NT, IÂ´m sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lets see if they get there - they might|pg||
nt|mrxxx: 5@d now i think|pg||
nt|mrxxx: to force a heart cue if possible|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes that looks right|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: well with NT bid that should be easy?   (BTW hi Joe) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: same thing i suppose|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: 4@H is quite pushy but westra-bertens have a fairly consistent policy to just bid everything in sight|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|hawe45:  This - normal - lead might help East to guess the @C-situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: awwwwww|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bernix: hi everybody. sorry for being late, play in norway was very slow|pg||
nt|ntmon: now another two rounds of clubs, North shedding a @H|pg||
nt|avivs:  I would prefer 1S opening by South if 1D was non available systemically|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not sure the nt bid requires the @s10.|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||

pc|c2|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Must finesse...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NO|pg||
nt|athene: he has the  option of rising @SA and trying to make all six of his trumps separately|pg||
nt|athene: but you would think if the spades lay badly, but the crossruff worked, south would just return a trump|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i thinkhans is right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - but he ends in the wrong hand, if he tahes the Ace|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He has (maybe) the choice between J x x / Jack in South|pg||
pc|c8|nt|avivs:  other table also got to 4H although South did not super accept|pg||
pc|c6|nt|avivs:  on board 10...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  After 1 @H from East, North should have re-evaluated his two Queens|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looking at it wont ch\nge anything|pg||

nt|dburn: either by leading it now or by throwing it under the ace|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|murat e: now east has to throw sp king under the ace|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|ianmcc: can unblock when no finesse|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|dburn: so that East knows North has the queen of diamonds (and not the queen of spades)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: North had it there when West @s10|pg||
nt|dburn: still, declarer might just take the diamond finesse anyway|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could havepitched @d crashed @s|pg||
nt|murat e: defence did well by not leading a dia but gave declare a chance later on|pg||
nt|dburn: North might think from the discards that West started with five spades|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case I suppose he might duck a spade now|pg||

nt|jcomyn: and another quiet s game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a minor slam at last|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: back in a mo derby is on|pg||
nt|santyclz: Panama.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But I would not like tp play that contract with a trump return from North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and asnother major game yawn yawn|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No loosing option in 4 @S - but E/W might bid a lot also|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks like an easy 3 NT here - to play, but to bid ?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Sorry folks, got to go, bye|pg||
nt|ianmcc: slam dodgy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so is life|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: difficult problem for west now - he doesn't want to hear 5@H from his partner, so double might not appeal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good practical bidding by South - with game E/W (also)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but as a passed hand partner is perhaps less likely to bid 5@H - if he pulls the double it will generally be with a 3- or 2-suiter, with 4NT, which would be fine|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@H= 5@S+4@H, 7-10 HCP|pg||
nt|hawe45:  620 - both tables|pg||
nt|athene: north was trying to set up overruffs for his partner but you have to be very sure of what you are doing, to return the suit declarer is playing|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  Easy...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he presumably has some reason for playing clubs rather than trumps himself :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  650 maybe, if one takes the right option in the @D-suit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|avivs:  lucky 3NT|pg||
nt|avivs:  I would not want to be there looking just at the N/S hands|pg||
nt|avivs:  another push coming on board 11 with E/W in 4@s at other room|pg||
nt|avivs:  this is actually not cold|pg||
nt|avivs:  he will need to go after clubs (likely)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You must guess the @S and decide, which minor has H x by West|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This will cost 550 - if...|pg||
nt|athene: double is "action" - just takeout-ish, saying he has a good 4@S opener|pg||
nt|athene: north thinks he has a choice now: -500 or -550? :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seen from the North-seat, South shall bring three tricks in the side-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Well, almost 7-10 hcp,anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: but likes the shape |pg||
mb|p|nt|avivs:  better chances for Hx in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: if you decide that east has Hx in a minor you can start leading a small one from hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|santyclz: Only 6 tables running, Roland must be slacking off...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: townsend expected a lot of shape for the 5-level overcall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Poor East - he liked his @S-singleton|pg||
nt|athene: he isn't sure if 6@D will make and he isn't sure if 5@S will|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats 3c?|pg||
nt|athene: well 3nt by south has the virtue of being cold on any lie|pg||
nt|athene: you cash the @SA and can guarantee to bring in the spades on either 4-0 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@D=5332 12-14|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzgf: running scores http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/GBT_2011/11_06_03_team.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we are used to 14 or so |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: till now, every bid was alerted|pg||
nt|santyclz: To watch multiple tables:  www.bridgebase.com/mobile  Open 1 browser window/table.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: very prcise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This lead should "lead" to the overtrick, the @C-looser being eliminated|pg||
nt|athene: yes stick the @D9 in, draw trumps, then diamond towards the A82 gets you a club pitch|pg||
nt|athene: the 2@C response on a balanced hand is similar to the idea of opening 1@C on any balanced hand even with better diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: it makes it harder for opps if you don't announce your suits, and usually it does not harm your side if you have good methods|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jeroen van de Pol|pg||
nt|jpmbs: hi all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hi|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: probably they are both down but he doesn't want to take the chance|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ntmon: long way to 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 3@D no 5 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 3@H = 5@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont see the point|pg||
nt|ianmcc: me neither transfer doesn't reveal West's hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bernix: i just wondered what 2@h meant|pg||
nt|avivs:  the only clue he has is that East has 1 extra heart...|pg||
nt|athene: if he starts with the @DJ and east ducks smoothly he might play west for @DKQ and take another finesse|pg||
nt|avivs:  now will test spades|pg||
nt|avivs:  and when they break 3-3 will finesse West|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with 1NT-2H    2S-3D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If E/W lead 3th/5th - the 8 is the right play|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzgf: W just asked|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He has only the winning line to play - |pg||
nt|mrxxx: not the best of leads|pg||
pc|d4|pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  With a rather poor @D-suit, East might have expected mor high cards by partner|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too simple for experts i suppose|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think he'll trumps hearts to dummy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he can play it any aul way my granny will make this one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: granny would know about the black pictures|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think it says - lets impress the viewers with our esoteric system|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no point in learning all this stuff if you don't use it|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 9 OK....|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bernix: a likely push|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|athene: playing it this way means you see some discards before you have to make up your mind|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hawe45:  @D-decision now|pg||
nt|jpmbs: we can see Dutch Red are doing fine which is good news for them considering election for Dutch team.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: it's very hard not to pitch from your 5-card suit first|pg||
nt|peachy: Live eunning scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/GBT_2011/11_06_03_team.html|pg||
nt|athene: so when west lets a diamond go, declarer will surely play him for long diamonds|pg||
nt|avivs:  I will be very surprised if he discards another club|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a point but I have learned a lot of this stuff but only use it when necessary|pg||
nt|ianmcc: East in trouble|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: look at it this way,  "oly 50's" |pg||
pc|h8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and also would be in 6c|pg||
nt|ianmcc: cash 2 aces, exit @s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no i suppose not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Pou Moin wins|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he might make it |pg||
nt|mrxxx: now give up a heart get back to hand with @dA and play last trump, wins with cliubs 3-3 of spade with the fourcard club|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|s6|nt|avivs:  very good discard by West|pg||
nt|avivs:  but not enough|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needs a little help from his friends.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now North will not be able to lead against the @H King, I think|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bernix: will try to set up a squeeze that doesnt materialize|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: many people would not open 4@S, saying the hand is too strong - but opening 4 of a major makes it so much harder for your opps, you often beat par|pg||
nt|athene: either they don't find a good sac or they find a phantom sac|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And now three boards allready played in OR|pg||

nt|hawe45:  If they do not chance the style, they will make 980 here|pg||

nt|mrxxx: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: its start again at 7.30|pg||
nt|athene: just too likely to kill partner's promising holding|pg||

nt|hawe45:  But on a trump-lead, North plays the same way|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But Blackwood might keep them at the 5-level|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: 7.30 p.m. of course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Discilined NO-1 @S by West|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed|pg||
nt|mrxxx: as a said earlier the 2@d opening of westra made it easy for opps to reach 3nt, was missed on the other table|pg||
mb|2C|nt|avivs:  2@c must be artificial|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this dealing machine got stuck early today|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bernix: 3@c would be reasonable|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @S - duck - more @S = 9th trick...|pg||
nt|athene: east will be warned off a spade lead when his partner can't raise, though?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcomyn: all kibitzers must be asleep by now|pg||
nt|athene: just too likely it is giving a trick, even with KQJ|pg||

nt|athene: declarer very likely to have A1098 or so|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that a @H-shift will give problems|pg||
nt|jcomyn: probably right hans as they have all gone to play croquet or something equally exciting|pg||
nt|athene: this might get interesting|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can plod away at spades|pg||
nt|athene: trying to set up his fifth spade|pg||
nt|jpmbs: this might be a push also, I just do not see a 9th trick|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But the @H-SHIFT!!!|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that east might be able to get a heart AND a club|pg||
nt|athene: if you do let him in three times|pg||
nt|mrxxx: will have to guess the hearts here|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bernix: must shift to clubs now to defeat 3@s|pg||
nt|ntmon: @C switch hardly possible after 3@C|pg||
nt|bernix: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html|pg||
nt|bernix: sorry this is the link for last year's results. link not updated yet|pg||
nt|ntmon: will E work it out anyway?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: needs to get diamonds right|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bernix: he will have no 2nd chance |pg||
pc|d6|nt|ntmon: good!|pg||
nt|bernix: very well done, not easy to see|pg||
nt|mrxxx: Kx with east or Tx with west|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the bettin is?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: i have to say i would have overcalled 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: west has a plan|pg||
nt|athene: give his partner a club ruff|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: north will be wondering about the spade position - he might think west has a singleton honour|pg||
pc|sT|nt|avivs:  the way this session is going for them he should have bid this 25% slam...|pg||
nt|athene: surely east would lead a spade from KQJ10x|pg||
nt|athene: even KQJ10|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: in textbookland when opps bid and raise clubs, and you have four, you know you can give partner a second-round ruff|pg||
nt|avivs:  50% that the @sK is one of the missing KCs and not off 2 aces and 50% that its on side|pg||
nt|athene: sadly in the real world, things don't work out so well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just the 2|pg||
nt|jpmbs: Westra attacking the entry for the C's|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ianmcc: @h9 now damaging|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess they like to have a real suit at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|jcomyn: run DQ|pg||
nt|athene: he shld have jumped in with the @CK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  K x with East doesÂ´nt work, we ruff a @S|pg||
nt|mrxxx: always made as 1cl goes on the diamond|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ntmon: looks like well deserved 5 IMPs for Netherlands |pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|mrxxx: yep|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: now easy to use @DQ, @HK to set up the clubs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yup|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  I hate to admit it, but I agree with them|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: Bakhshi thinks that the lead was a singleton so taking the trump finesse is more likely to run into a club ruff, i guess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Are the players still at the table?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|avivs:  a very knwledgeable person informed me that North knew it's on the finesse since 3NT showed bad trumps...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: it OT decision |pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems to me - I was in the kirchen - that North got some help in the @C-suit...?|pg||

nt|vugraphzgf: they dont know the result yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: who called the director?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: w played the a @H and s played a @S instead of a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: w called him|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: and then they packed in and now they are playing the next and last one|pg||
nt|jpmbs: meanwhile my push at previos brd was wrong also :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This person should have told N/S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another boring game|pg||
nt|sybarra: can the e/w here duplicate this board?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|jpmbs: the 1S overcall helped him not to try for spades and later he did not go up with KofC|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yes of course|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ntmon: 4@S "routine"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Heart lead in OR - and allthough East ducked the first @C - 12 tricks|pg||
nt|avivs:  he chose not to risk a slam on finesse plus trumps might break poorly even when K is onside|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E must already be thinking slam |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  6 @D depending on the @C.suit|pg||
nt|athene: i don't like south's bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: you have two aces and FOUR (yes, that was four) card support for partner's first bid suit|pg||
nt|athene: and he has made a jump shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2NT= minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 2@D art GF|pg||
nt|jcomyn: obviously so why did s take so long to bid 3c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must have no homes to go to|pg||
nt|jpmbs: bad luck here|pg||
nt|athene: well, bad luck in a sense - it's a pretty thin game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @S looks comfortable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but the cards are perfectly placed for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: sure, the spade ruffs are unfortunate, but on the other hand the red suits could lie much worse, so you can't really complain when you go down|pg||
nt|jpmbs: agree, if 2H is semi-positive, bit unlucky all HCP in D's|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but he wont go down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even 3 NT is a winner|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He will be down in 38 seconds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Counted from the moment, when South starts playing|pg||
nt|jpmbs: Thk he will go down, other table might start with 1H 1S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats if he ever decides to play|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A good point is: The later South starts playing, the later he goes down...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what was 1d|pg||
nt|mrxxx: i guess 0-7 any of real @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: now need to watch all the forcing bids, etc,  (personally I would be worried about bidding just 2 @S)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many people would consider this an invitation sequence, obviously they don't|pg||
nt|mrxxx: 1@h ia 12-14nt of clubs and hearts, 1@s = relay|pg||
nt|mrxxx: no :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: it's not as though David Gold was well-known for throwing tricks away as declarer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is no better, why not 3 @D - wait and see|pg||
nt|jcomyn: theres nothing to think about here surely|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @sK then @d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: give up h c d and claim but he wont|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he paid his entry fee|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a real threat|pg||
nt|mrxxx: they definitely dont play that :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: wha tha|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told,  2 spades is asking  min  or max|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzgf: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@H= doubleton|pg||
nt|peachy: Particularly, as I think he is aware  yhay the 3NT was a pickup|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hard for west to have more.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an then 5nt is?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no idea |pg||
nt|santyclz: Spec asks if 2@s asked min/max, what did 5nt ask?|pg||
nt|sybarra: how does pard know whether to bid 6 or 7?|pg||
nt|santyclz: A maximum maximum?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or choice of slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: like "its ok if you pick a minor"|pg||
nt|santyclz: Specs are suggesting it was "pick a slam except @hs".|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont like that system|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the one that made me laugh was "transfer to 6 nt" |pg||
nt|santyclz: So if w were, for example, 2452...|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably not easy to show shortness in pard's major|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what to do you do?|pg||
nt|santyclz: They have a pretty decent record for a poor system.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i am a simple soul 4NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: you have a 16 count opposite a 1 nt opener |pg||
nt|jcomyn: I only said i didnt like it|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you bid 4?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: townsend knows the cards lie badly - his minor-suit honours are likely over strength in west's hand|pg||
nt|avivs:  very unlucky for him to catch east with @d void|pg||
nt|athene: and his partner hopefully has hearts over east|pg||
nt|athene: plus there is the trump break :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: right try something else|pg||
nt|mrxxx: lol|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hawe45:  Right play - not awarded|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzgf: sorry, the internet broke down|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi all |pg||
nt|jcomyn: certainly down now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ianmcc: if he doesn't play @hA he'll lose it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: my great granny would have clasimed ages ago|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely this is ridiculously slow|pg||
nt|ianmcc: there's always solitaire|pg||
nt|jpmbs: 100 a piece|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: but he might lose just a club and two hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Duck 1 @H and play @C rto the 10, then...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we cdould hold a little competition with each round playewd during the pauses|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|hawe45:  He heard me|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  Safe now, giving away 2 @C-tricks at most|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Come on - Denmark is playing Iceland (Foot) to night...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and ireland pl;ay macedonia|pg||
nt|athene: south decided the only way he was going to make is if west had the @DA and not the @HA and only two or three trumps|pg||
nt|jpmbs: Brasil Netherlands also|pg||
nt|athene: then even if west gets a spade ruff there might just be the ruff and the red aces for the defence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now @D to the @H Ace - and @S back|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. diamond to the king holds, then a trump towards the king|pg||
nt|jcomyn: these are not football fans or they would play faster|pg||
nt|athene: now if east rises with @HA and gives his partner a ruff, the @HQ will be dropping|pg||
nt|jpmbs: :-)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  No it comes...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D K|pg||

pc|c2|pc|s4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  2 instead of 3 IMP|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @s pointless|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this must surely be a record for the longest time to play in a stone cold part score|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|avivs:  North could have set them with a trump return when in with @cK|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but it's vul|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but i think you probably need west to have only two trumps on this line, or the @DQ as well, as he could underlead his @DA for another ruff perhaps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: praying for clubs to come down |pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: director is here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|peachy: spade length was already advertised so that is declarer's line|pg||
nt|athene: no, trump back didn't beat|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can even cash a trump himself just to confirm the layout|pg||
nt|peachy: one rd trumps does not hurt|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so are we|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ianmcc: ageing slowly|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s5|nt|athene: not sure why he had to bid 5@D|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|athene: and the fact that declarer can make after cashing one trump suggests he should have made it even without the double|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: so the double didn't cost that much|pg||
mc|8|nt|jcomyn: much ado about nothing|pg||

nt|sybarra: thx all esp. thx to Anna our wonderful operator |pg||

nt|vugraphzgf: 2NT= @C and @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 2 nt was not the bid W necessarily wanted to hear |pg||
nt|jcomyn: which of the suits i dont hve do you want me to bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: note opps have AKQ of opps suits|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ntmon: ouch|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: they claimed for just made and then corrected it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems, you can make 4 @H - og the @S-guess|pg||
nt|athene: east still needs a lot of fitting cards for slam, but if he asks his partner for a diamond stop and hears "no"...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  IÂ´m sure, they will bid it - helped by SouthÂ´s 1 @D-overcall|pg||
nt|jpmbs: yes this might help|pg||
nt|jpmbs: both have extras now|pg||
nt|jpmbs: Berry might have opened these and have MAX|pg||
nt|athene: well it is still asking a lot - you need pd to have A A Q in the majors AND there is still one major queen missing|pg||
nt|jpmbs: Huub has extra also|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems fair|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, maybe @CA is not a trick|pg||
nt|athene: but still....|pg||
nt|athene: anyway double having splintered shows his hand pretty well|pg||
nt|athene: overbidding a bit to be sure of reaching the right strain|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: bd 4  (the ugly 4 @H)  gave Neth. +10 |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: h has already shown his hand this HAS to be penalties|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But as partner has no values in @D, itÂ´s not that surprising|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: a slam should not be missed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: got there!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not quite sure where North found that|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: perhaps 4@D is too much - partner might play you for a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that some soprt of bergen from E if it is its dsaft|pg||
nt|ianmcc: these raises are overdone|pg||
nt|mrxxx: after a @c lead this should be a wash|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: must say,  not sure I would considered a trump shift here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bernix: this may help south|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: couldnt agree more but it worked why i have no idea - THAT X HAS to be penalties|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that the two last boards will bring back a victory to NL|pg||
nt|athene: bertens isn't worried by the thought of being off the @DA with a hold in one of the majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@S=@C raise|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: with a hole in one of the majors|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrxxx: sry did not see that X|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ntmon: 5@S asking for good trumps|pg||

pc|s9|nt|sybarra: nad pard didnt get it |pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and now netherlands win|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this hand shows that this 4-4 fit things is grossly exaggerated|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the late great Monty Rosenberg alwsays said 4-4 fits are for babies|pg||
nt|athene: a lot of the time west has a doubleton in a major of course, which improves the chances|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  The rule for West: Never take a trick, without having a good reason to do it|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer knows east had 1-6 in the red suits|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a dream come true in the spade suit, needs to guess (no guess really) ace and then hope for J10 tight or A doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: he knows that of course if east has a small singleton spade a spade switch at trick 3 would have beaten the contract|pg||
nt|avivs:  Thanks to Bill, Raija  and hans and also to Anna our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: but that doesn't mean you should definitely not play for that because it's not so clearcut for east to shift to the spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: bye for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: thanks all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: next match in about 15 min|pg||
