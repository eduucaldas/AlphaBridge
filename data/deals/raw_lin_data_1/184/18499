nt|odysseus69: 3rd time lucky|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: hi victor|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: Wolff might have been tempted to act had he not been vulnerable|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|joest: I'm not sure why Morse chose negative double instead of a heart raise|pg||
nt|odysseus69: adequate trump support but not quite enough |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: judged it was to good for 2 hearts- maybe they play 4 card majors?|pg||
nt|joest: those are both possibilities|pg||
nt|joest: although why this is good for 2@h escapes me|pg||
mb|5H|nt|joest: will Wolff correct 5@c to 5@d?|pg||
nt|joest: 4NT here is clearly "pick a minor"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: Morse now owns up to his heart support|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i thought I saw a pass of 4Hx- I need new spectacles|pg||

nt|odysseus69: the good or bad thing about seniors bridge (depending on ones preferences) is that the bidding tends to be natural|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|odysseus69: 2S is more like the young mans bid even at the colours|pg||

nt|peachy: North*|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcwla: Error.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: An extra pass in here.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Presumably this is 4@H by S and I don't see it working.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hlortz: @D taps willl make this unpleasant|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|stc: what about 3@s from S instead of 4@h ?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|stc: knowing that a weak partner can't bid @s ?|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: 2/1 is sweeping the bridge world- it may be better but as far as I can judge it is a bad idea for non experts|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|joest: I guess I disagree.  I think it's harder to figure out what's forcing in a non 2/1 system|pg||
nt|joest: I think there are some 'tweak's you need in 2/1 though|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: do we know if these pairs are playing 2/1|pg||

nt|joest: so Morse will lose the two black aces|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cQ|pc|s6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|joest: in response to several questions about 3@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3S usually shows 3- they tend to bid 2NT with 2 spades - and await developments|pg||
mc|11|nt|joest: I have played that it shows three card support and extra values|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|noodle:  agressive opening from N will land them in game|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 2@H here truly says "If you put 6 hearts and 8 points in my hand I will open 2@H no matter what."|pg||
nt|bobh1: the rule of 20|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Hi Bob and Shirley,   sorry for being late.  |pg||

mb|2S|nt|stc: 6@d by E is cold, but how to find it ?|pg||

nt|bobh1: np|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe ace and a spade lead more difficult?|pg||
nt|noodle:  every thing breaks so it should be ok|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I dont see many problems here.  decl has to decide if he starts with hearts  or first plays 1 trump|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|007 joosth: I think starting with 1 spade might be a little safer|pg||
nt|bobh1: ruffing high might be right|pg||
nt|bobh1: on this layout it costs a trick|pg||
nt|bobh1: but he still makes it|pg||
nt|noodle:  you don t want to ruff low and be overruffed then A@s+@s|pg||
nt|007 joosth: at this point a high ruff is best|pg||
nt|sybarra: so much easier from this vantage point isnt it?|pg||

mb|1C|nt|joest: 2@s is just noncomittal as to values and leaves open a more thorough 3NT investigation|pg||
nt|joest: anayway that board rates to be a push|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: I am told that N/S are not playing 2/1 but East West are|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|joest: I'm sitting here wondering whether 6@c is good enough to bid|pg||
nt|joest: perhaps not|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|joest: you're right|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
nt|joest: Wolff might switch to the @HK in case his partner has both QJ of hearts + the club ace|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s4|nt|joest: the hand almost required that switch|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 clubs looks good but very very tough to reach -|pg||
mc|10|nt|joest: you have to ruff two diamonds (dangerous off this bidding) + handle your fourth spade|pg||

nt|sybarra: looks like it already|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3D|nt|007 joosth: otherwise a bad opening in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|007 joosth: 6S will be down on a club lead.  thats why the 9card fit is safer :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|bobh1: well at least somebody mentioned @Cs|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but also 6C is not a very good slam  when spades are not 3-3 you nead very many ruffs|pg||
nt|sybarra: can N lead ace and a @C if they land in 6 @C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  it might be a Q in this context though|pg||
mb|4D|nt|peachy: Something wrong with auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: OK - now this one I believe (finally).|pg||
mb|4H|nt|007 joosth: yes  i think a control showing 4C here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jcwla: Folks, no, the scores are not correct.  Please bear with us.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|sybarra: this hand may be discussed at length later|pg||
nt|sybarra: some will say,  "god gave you singletons to lead"|pg||
nt|sybarra: but only defending 4 |pg||
nt|noodle:  since Fisher didn t bid 2@h  I suspect he expected a 5 card @s suit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: if canapee, would 3H mean 4 clubs  and 3S  5 clubs?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but then you cant bid hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: i just looked at the Fisher Hamilton card|pg||
nt|bobh1: 5-cd majors|pg||
nt|bobh1: no mention of canape|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a club between that nice spades maybe|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe had a club in with the spades |pg||
nt|007 joosth: lol|pg||
nt|noodle:  then it was a 'decision' 1@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think Fred just made a battlefield decision|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well 1 reason might be the quality of the suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: the "good news" is the short spade hand will be ruffing @D's|pg||
nt|noodle:  there is a lot to be said to open the suit over your singleton, but then we played 4 card majors when I learned that :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: he will not go for ruffs. but just play the clubs first|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|007 joosth: can afford a ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am old fashioned 2/1 player,  I still prefer 1 @C  (if not a club system)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: me 2|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe not in 3d hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: in the other room they got to a much worse contract|pg||
nt|007 joosth: this is a nice duck to, though not necesary|pg||
nt|bobh1: was lucky to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes how did they make it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ducked a @D or 2 |pg||
nt|bobh1: South has no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: south asking w about 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: and prayed for no ace of clubs with S |pg||
nt|noodle:  in 4@s ducking a @D to retain control is very good  trumps will often be 4-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: game forcing is response|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|bobh1: except on this layout|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|s4|nt|peachy: the play also, surely ace was not used to capture a trick when 10 was enough|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hlortz: seems likely n opened 1@S s bid a drury 2@C and n bid 4@S|pg||
nt|007 joosth: miskl  or  thinking about 5C ?|pg||

nt|007 joosth: diamond-lead best i think, but impossible unless E bids them|pg||
nt|sybarra: tell him commentators asked that also (I know you can not do that)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: play diamonds whenever you can her.  maybe decl looses control|pg||
nt|noodle:  does BBO vuGraph add pressure  or the stakes are already big enough ?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Not sure what the redouble is.  You and your partner should have agreements on what you do over the opps' conventional doubles of 1NT, as well as penalty doubles of 1NT.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jcwla: Here is Jacobus bidding his suit and of course that's the last thing O'Rourke wanted to hear.|pg||

nt|peachy: Is this hand worth upgrading to a Precision 1C, or will it complicate matters to have both majors. Spades looks like designed for a trump suit:)|pg||

nt|peachy: while they are on a break, we can all analyze dbl dummy the whole hand to pieces!|pg||

nt|vugraphzfg: 8-11 no 5 @S|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ty|pg||
mb|4S|nt|phil: well, I see 8....|pg||
nt|jcwla: The real money was in passing and awaiting pd's card-showing X.|pg||
nt|phil: west will need to be careful to not provide a spade entry to the board|pg||
nt|santyclz: That would have worked very well here, about 8 tricks on defense.|pg||
nt|phil: looking at all 4, testing hearts and then a diamond from the board works fine, but is that best?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|phil: seems you can also establish the heart and play the @dQ from hand too|pg||
nt|bobh1: the difference in the other room is W bid 4@S not 3@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: this ultimately deprived them of RKC in @Cs|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not easy for S to discover the singl D, a king of spades and the Q of hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: and why no bid 4?  jam the bidding  you are passed hand,  pard can not take you too seriously|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Both rely on @da(x)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe 4S can be a singleton|pg||
nt|bobh1: hard to bid grands without RKC|pg||
nt|sybarra: I meant by W|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Hamilton might have bids 1 or 2 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S=1 Key Card   5@D [i think] asks specific kings  so 5@S = @SK and known @CK|pg||
nt|bobh1: S doesn't know about the stiff @D|pg||
nt|007 joosth: then high preëmpting is easier for W|pg||
mb|6C|nt|stc: 1NT by N seems to confirm "special agreements"|pg||
nt|hlortz: seems a bit much to raise @S with south's 5 count|pg||
nt|stc: unlimited confidence in partner's skills|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: yes  but then that needed Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: how can N go on?  aceless |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 5@D guaranteed all the keycards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: maybe S should have tried 5N|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobh1: anything but huddle and then 6@C|pg||
nt|007 joosth: only a specific suit ask like Kantar does can solve the problem, but 4NT is to high to start RKB  when its about a minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i agree with Bob   5N keeps 7 alive -- but doubtful Bates will know key is stiff @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: the key is the stiff @D |pg||
