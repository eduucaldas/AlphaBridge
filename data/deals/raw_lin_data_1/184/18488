mb|p|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: E will commence with 1@H, W will bid 1@S, E will likely rebid 2@C (maybe 1NT), and they'll end in either 3NT or 4@S.  |pg||
pc|sQ|mc|8|nt|jcwla: It's not the most beautiful layout ever encountered.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi CK.|pg||
nt|psyck: 3rd vs 7th placed teams here|pg||

nt|sybarra: its connected to the Marriott right?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Likely a 1@D opening intending to rebid 2NT over pd's response; here none is forthcoming.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|psyck: apparently they only need 13 cards to respond at this vul|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the modern game it is just detested to pass pd's opening.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Yes! The host suite has two 36" tvs with BBO!|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bunch of hts here for e/w |pg||
nt|casenjo:  I am on WIFI in the hotel lobby|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: support double likely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks for me easier than 4@s|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck: redouble that is|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now how do you feel about making the support redouble vs. bidding the 2NT (with the possibility of finding out about @H's later)?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  excuse me 56" |pg||
nt|sybarra: I operated a tourney there a couple of years ago |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: xx better|pg||
nt|lml: 3@D seems reasonable but they will end up in notrump about now|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: What's the rationale?|pg||
nt|psyck: you can always bid NT to show your values later|pg||
nt|psyck: this gives more room for more options|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: he has managed both at 2 level, whereas if 2NT 1st, yet to show support...|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is Wolff.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@C forcing 3@D then W will go back to 3@H (or conceivably pass).|pg||
nt|kemperg: E worried about @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: like the Nationals |pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: ok, W doubled N's 3@c|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, ok, Wolff sighoff sequence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: any objections?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcwla: I think we're missing a pass here.|pg||
nt|psyck: W's x says i like to bid|pg||
nt|lml: but Fisher know that |pg||
nt|lml: his partner is worried about the majors one or both|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcwla: Might pass to keep the big hand decl.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcwla: OK so 3@D it is with that beautiful dummy coming down.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|hJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|mc|11|nt|psyck: E will not be expecting the world in dummy on this auction anyway|pg||
nt|jcwla: If W had passed 1@D, what do you like by N in 4th chair?|pg||
pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SKJT9H82DQ82CQT82,SAQHAK97DT97CJ975,S8643HQT5DAK65C63,S752HJ643DJ43CAK4|sv|e|nt|jcwla: Same start to auction but S showed values with 2@S and N blasted 4, the pure-HCP X by E extracting an additional 2 IMPs.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ralfwil: the only problem on this board is to avoid a @s slam|pg||
nt|casenjo:  there have been some very big hands in both the Seniors and the Women's events|pg||
nt|sybarra: debating where I want to be with e/w hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  6NT?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: that works |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Clerkin likes to open very light even when in another chair|pg||
nt|lml: here 1@H is mostly for the lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psyck: i'm not a bid fan of jumping with 4 cards and bal hands|pg||
nt|jcwla: E will open 1NT with a max, W will invite and they will settle comfortably in 3NT that depends on the lead.|pg||
nt|lml: In the Open Room Wolff opened Clerkin's hand 2@H.  What do you think of that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: played by W,  a spade lead could messup  6 nt |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: better than 1@H|pg||
nt|lml: I agree.  I like it better and I think it is a good thought in third chair|pg||
nt|lml: it did get them too high|pg||
nt|lml: the opponents|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: would you open 1N or 1@d here?|pg||
nt|jcwla: W might just blast - but E wants to be in vul games as much as W.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: some players makes a false cue in @h on a hand like W|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|sybarra: you dont often see strong jump shift anymore  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: This is 9 with some downgrades.  As long as your style is to accept invites with anything but a dead min (as it should be), an invite is plenty in my book.|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case S does not find the magic @S lead and score it up.|pg||
nt|psyck: i would have probably opened 1@d all A's & K's & 5 card suit...|pg||
nt|psyck: agree, maybe vul game so just blasted|pg||
nt|sybarra: a sigh of relief when the club Q comes down |pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: sometimes i belong to them:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|jcwla: It's close - but looking at the spots does it look more like a leaky dike or a brick wall?  To me, the former.  I would 1NT.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kemperg: coffeehand now|pg||
nt|lml: yes he could throw South in on a heart and see if something good happens for an up trick|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@d did not work so well other table|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: now I think North can get squeezed|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|psyck: on a different day, stopping in 3@d would have been a success with opps taking 1st 5 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not on a club back|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|jcwla: I like to err on the side of 1NT on close decisions.  Something newer players would do well to do.  Think how comfortable you feel when partner opens 1NT.  You've asserted claim to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: the hand, you know your structure very well, you're primed for a nice, intelligent auction.   You just don't feel the same sense of feet on the ground with a 1@D opening.|pg||

nt|psyck: in a regular pdship however, i would value that hand to be more than 18 & open accordingly :)|pg||
nt|lml: what do you open with East|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT gets your high cards across|pg||
nt|lml: but you are a bit weak in the black suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: not everyone overcalls 109xxx |pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: but likely to work out |pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcwla: K & R has it at 18.6 so my 1NT certainly leaves room for my play of the hand. :)|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2NT, but 1@H not a wrong choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: i often need that buffer too :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S=preemptive|pg||
nt|sybarra: cuebids with better hands is my guess|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla: Clerkin opened this 1@H and got to the game that makes with no problem in @C's.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: 2@C is a bit of a surprise but its not bad either|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: for me thats gf|pg||
nt|lml: its the worst of the 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: North in deep thought.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|kemperg: not good enough for that|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: W might be a slightly disappointed in the E spade holding....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: So this will be 10 to Levine, 9 if there's an accident in @C's.|pg||
nt|lml: they are headed for trouble|pg||

nt|lml: Hamilton thought they were in hearts I think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kemperg: no W had called 3@H then|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: I guess 4@D was I dont have another bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: ace and @D thru however  (or after winning ht)  |pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: but most of us would return pards suit |pg||

pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jcwla: On a hand where you have to play the @D's yourself for one loser, you would double finesse, starting with the @DQ from the E hand, running it if not covered, then if it loses to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: @DK hook for the @DJ.  Lose only to @D K, J in N.  Much better than @D to A then low back and try to guess which to put in.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: yes north south stole the pot in 2@H in the Open Room|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I like dbl as S. act as early as possible|pg||
nt|chorush: You are in good company. Bobby Wolfe insists on double with the south hand|pg||

mb|2N|nt|lml: but I prefer to open a strong long suit|pg||

nt|007 joosth: thats ok 2|pg||

nt|007 joosth: then its better to do it at once|pg||

pc|h2|nt|psyck: the cards are not duplicated across the matches, for security reasons possibly|pg||

nt|kemperg: trump promotion poss.|pg||
nt|lml: he needs to work out spades for 1 down but he should on the auction|pg||
nt|lml: if he plays the @SK then he smothers the eight and can finesse against the 10 later|pg||
nt|lml: he will have to ruff high on the diamond but that is obvious|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no west has 2 entrys for the trumpromotion|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe the 9 was better   well  with open cards....|pg||
nt|fifee: if Clerkin held the @CK, @D switch would have been deadly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The Schwartz team has played quite well, but has been very lucky too|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|lml: yes 2 down now|pg||

nt|007 joosth: i think the only play to avoid 2 down|pg||

nt|psyck: & 1@s was a limited hand...|pg||
nt|lml: I thought he was going to try that but on the cards this worked as well|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
nt|lml: and East did figure to have the 10 on the auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: running the 9 is pretty deep (and unnecessary)|pg||
nt|lml: lets get him A-|pg||
mb|2S|nt|007 joosth: which singleton spade is more probable after the double|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I would open the W hand only if I had a 2-suit preemptive bid to use|pg||
nt|bigtrain: random|pg||
nt|bigtrain: besides a high spade handles all nicely|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can't be wrong|pg||
nt|lml: I suspect but dont know that 2@h shows spades or minors|pg||
nt|lml: here spades|pg||
nt|lml: Gertsman could try 4@S and let Clerkin correct with minors|pg||
nt|lml: I make it about 3 down in spades|pg||
nt|kemperg: very brave that will be|pg||
nt|othered1: in OR, EW never got their 9-card @H fit into the auction,  unlikely here, too.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: wont he expect better spades?|pg||
nt|lml: probably but anything goes at this vul I would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: actually, i@s was probably an overcall like here :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, a muiderberg style 2@h maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: though the @h suit is nothing to write home about|pg||
nt|lml: South has a reasonable hand for the auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: this auction makes no sense|pg||
nt|chick: are we sure it isn't 2@D West?|pg||
nt|psyck: i cannot figure out N's or W's passes other room, operator may have just entered final bid...|pg||
nt|othered1: In any case, NS can outbid EW . . . |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|psyck: not that this room bidding makes more sense :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 5H is also wild I think but will make|pg||

nt|lml: I cant think of a logical way to play hearts that doesnt work|pg||
nt|kemperg: cant do @Hs wrong|pg||
nt|007 joosth: N might have them all, so he can play from dummey.  otherwise the double finesse will work 2  here|pg||
