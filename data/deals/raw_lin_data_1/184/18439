nt|santyclz: In the other room n overcalled that stalwart @s suit and the auction got a little out of hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart raise and an unspecified singleton it appears|pg||
nt|othered1: classical theory says not to begin cue-bidding with a void, as partner may misevaluate secondary honors in that suit.  But when east has shown the suit, it's a different situation|pg||
