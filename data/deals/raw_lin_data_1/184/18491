nt|santyclz: With the @dj coming down, 6 is a decent contract.|pg||

nt|athene: did declarer lead a heart to the king and manage to lose three heart tricks perhaps?|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i guess you might lead a heart to the jack and ace then lay down the king|pg||

nt|athene: this is a bit awkward for declarer actually|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: he would like to run the lead to his hand to be sure of making all the diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but his entries are a bit tangled|pg||
nt|athene: for example he can't really cash the @DK then cash the spades and diamonds and then lead a heart up, because cashing the spades will establish a long card for west|pg||
nt|athene: but if he leads a heart right away, a spade return takes out his entry to hand whilst the diamonds are blocked|pg||
nt|athene: of course as the cards lie, he can always make as he can afford to overtake the @DK, but he doesn't know that|pg||
