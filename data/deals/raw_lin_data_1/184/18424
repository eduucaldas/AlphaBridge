mb|1S|an|f1, 0-4 !Ss|mb|2S|nt|Walddk3: 1@C is often (11)12-14 balanced|pg||

nt|Walddk3: and so do E-W|pg||
nt|jtr: West fearless as usual|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ronpa: Yes, a bit agressive especially vul vs not but he is young :)|pg||

nt|mich-b: Hi all|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|c7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ronpa: I'm sure smirnov can imagine passing and playing on a 3-3 fit right now :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ronpa: thinking partner took his 2@D as pick a major|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brgpro: dont see any danger for 2@h|pg||
nt|mich-b: 2@D was intended as natural , and imo should be natural|pg||
nt|mich-b: however with @H 3-3 2@H looks ok too|pg||
nt|brgpro: can always make 3@h 3@d and 2 each in the blacks|pg||
nt|brgpro: i mean 1 each|pg||
nt|ronpa: Yes Michael but playing in 3-3 fits is YOUR professional, not mine :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcwla: I don't understand this auction after about the 1@D mark but oh well.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|brgpro: NS is a new pdship i think, they might play a version of dutch doubleton though i am not sure|pg||
nt|brgpro: if that is the case, then 1@c=2+ and 1@d=0-7 or @d, |pg||
nt|jtr: Could declarer misguess the @hs?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|brgpro: i dont know for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe North bids 1@h with 4 over the X?|pg||
nt|ronpa: declarer can just not touch trumps for now and let the defence do it for him|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think jan Jansma is not a Dutch doubleton guy...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s4|pg||

pc|h8|pc|c4|pc|s7|pg||

pc|d9|nt|brgpro: or some version of Polish @c, in that case, 1@d can also be a neg. bid|pg||

mb|4C|nt|jtr: Reverse|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|jtr: Maybe they can stop|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, they stopped short of 7....|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: club lead takes out the entry so even if the @DK is onside you can't ruff them good for a spade pitch|pg||
nt|athene: so you basically need both finesses|pg||
nt|athene: hard to appreciate that slam will be so bad; there are lots of points and two good suits|pg||
nt|jtr: East had said his piece after the opening IMO|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he could have just bid 4@H over 4@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: true|pg||
nt|hedyg: let pd carry on if he has more|pg||
nt|hedyg: or.............would 4@h deny a @s control?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: maybe this comes back to the common cue-bidding problem|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: does 4@C say "we have slam if you have spade control" or just "i will make this mild noise, but don't take me too seriously"|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c2|pc|d4|nt|stc: switch N and S and you make on the sqz @d/@s|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: well Rehder obviously thought it did|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@c followed by 5@h says the former|pg||
nt|athene: east could always bid 4@S|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: saying "ok, i have a spade control but still i am not going to take over"|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|athene: i guess he felt with solid trumps AND the control...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: that was an option, yes|pg||
mc|11|nt|jtr: He has shown 8 tricks and that is what he has|pg||
pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4S9543HJ3D72C98752,SQJ2H95DAQ8654CKJ,SKT76H64DKT9CAT43,SA8HAKQT872DJ3CQ6|sv|n|nt|brgpro: seems to me that|pg||
nt|jtr: Was it really 9?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgd: yes N discarded a @S on the @D7, not a club|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah ok|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|brgpro: why ask for 5 card M? he is not happy with 4@h?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ronpa: now maybe south will pick the Q@D lead|pg||
nt|mich-b: maybe he thinks that bidding on the 3 level will prevent North from overcalling 2@S or 2@D on some hands|pg||
nt|brgpro: but isnt 2@c the same? |pg||
nt|brgpro: maybe it can be some other relays|pg||
mb|p|nt|bernix: not a good slam, needs 2 out of 2 finesses|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jtr: Puppet|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|brgpro: i know it is puppet...but i wonder why he doesnt use regular stayman|pg||
nt|bernix: on a spade lead|pg||
nt|peachy: Rohowsky here is a veteran player, also was on the team that won 1990 World Championship,|pg||
nt|peachy: Huub Bertens and Berry Westra are household names in the international bridge scene|pg||
nt|bernix: j√∂rg fritsche has represented germany in the past, too|pg||
mb|6H|mb|d|nt|ronpa: Now this is interesting hand|pg||
nt|jtr: To ask for 5M?  Guess they have other uses for 2@c|pg||
nt|brgpro: he still needs to overcome the @c break|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: By "veteran" - I dod mean age, just experience. Rohowsky was a junior in 1990|pg||
nt|peachy: don't mean****|pg||
nt|peachy: This unfortunately has zero chance of making, declarer's only hope is opponent revoke LOL. Not coming, for sure.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome back to Jeroen van de Pol|pg||
nt|jpmbs: hi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Jeroen|pg||
nt|jpmbs: with the lightner double a revoke gets less chance also :-)|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe thinks of running into notrumps. from his point of view a @d ruff might be threatening|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe my joke was a bad joke, must be painful for those cheering netherland, sorry|pg||
nt|jpmbs: he will sure thk about that|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|mich-b: he did not have a comfortable entry to dummy to play @C from there|pg||
nt|brgpro: if he tries a small @d S will surely jump in and knock out the @sA|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|jtr: South will be in trouble|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe it was better not to Dbl afterall, if converted tp 6NT as here, one should be ready to Dbl that as well|pg||
nt|bernix: tough lead problem for north|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|jtr: @h may have worked better|pg||
nt|brgpro: if E ducks this he will go down|pg||
nt|mich-b: what should declarer do now?|pg||
nt|brgpro: S can win @dJ and play a @s|pg||
nt|mich-b: if he ducks , defence can play a @S|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes  Duck and he gets a @s switch|pg||
nt|brgpro: then defense have 5 tricks. |pg||
nt|brgpro: E needs to win @dK and play on @c...S will be triple squeezed|pg||
nt|ronpa: He knows he will get a @S switch if he ducks this|pg||
nt|jtr: Would a @h have broken it up?|pg||
nt|ronpa: @H would break the squeeze but would create an endplay on south to lead @D from J9 at the end|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jpmbs: so 6N saved a few |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|brgpro: now i dont think he can make any more.|pg||
nt|brgpro: if he forgets about the @c then S wont have any trouble discarding but if he plays on @c then defense have 5 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bernix: on this particular deal the lead doesnt matter but any lead can turn out bad|pg||
mc|11|nt|peachy: North was in a pickle indeed for a lead|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: ok so what is the EW system?|pg||

nt|hedyg: did you count the 2@c David?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: sry Bill|pg||
nt|athene: he added one for his long diamond and never got around to deducting for KQJ tight and poor spots i guess :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: is 2@ca transfer to @d?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d showed 0-6 hcps|pg||
nt|hedyg: or is it 7?|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: in CC: 2@c = minors|pg||
nt|athene: you would think, if 2@C promises diamonds, west might bid more than 2@D, given he has limited his hand already|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ah, ok, so 2@C is minors but might be only 4 diamonds|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|jtr: @d position is clear|pg||
nt|athene: some play (or used to play) that if you lead K from AK and then switch, it's a singleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@D can be from J42|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know if that idea is very common any more|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah yes right Hedy  I meant he can underlead safely|pg||
nt|athene: because often people like to be able to lead either ace or king from AK - ace asking for attitude, king for count|pg||

nt|athene: lucky for the defence that north's spot card (the 4) was so big|pg||
nt|jtr: Can use the @hJ to get the @s  discard on a @c|pg||
nt|athene: no way for declarer to conceal the position - north *can't* have a low doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: huge!|pg||
nt|jtr: There are so many situations where UDC is better|pg||
nt|athene: udca is clearly better when you have Hx|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: It often seems to make it difficult for declarer to disguise the postion too|pg||

nt|jpmbs: I would expect him to cash his winners and wait for the spade play/guess|pg||

nt|jtr: Hello again people|pg||
nt|athene: it's usually right to be wary about competing over these 3-suited openers|pg||
