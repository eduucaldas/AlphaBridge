pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|henryb:  I'm sure many of the kibitzers believe N has a full opening, but classically a full opening requires some what more in "honor tricks"|pg||

nt|bernix: welcome all|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 1@C is often (11)12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk3: N-S play a variation of Polish Club|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and so do E-W|pg||
nt|jtr: West fearless as usual|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcomyn: 4s i daresay unless they get too high|pg||

nt|mich-b: Hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but slam is not bad|pg||
nt|sybarra2: oh oh |pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: we probably have all been in worse slams|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ronpa: I'm sure smirnov can imagine passing and playing on a 3-3 fit right now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ronpa: thinking partner took his 2@D as pick a major|pg||
nt|jcomyn: regularly|pg||
nt|sybarra2: :( |pg||
mb|5S|nt|brgpro: dont see any danger for 2@h|pg||
nt|mich-b: 2@D was intended as natural , and imo should be natural|pg||
nt|mich-b: however with @H 3-3 2@H looks ok too|pg||
nt|brgpro: can always make 3@h 3@d and 2 each in the blacks|pg||
nt|brgpro: i mean 1 each|pg||
nt|ronpa: Yes Michael but playing in 3-3 fits is YOUR professional, not mine :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I don't understand this auction after about the 1@D mark but oh well.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: bet he bids 6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bet he does|pg||
nt|sybarra2: pard opened and you have those aces |pg||
nt|jcomyn: he may even be more ambitiopus|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bet he's thinking about it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: one more try with 6C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: p could have DK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: ok we both lose|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brgpro: NS is a new pdship i think, they might play a version of dutch doubleton though i am not sure|pg||
nt|brgpro: if that is the case, then 1@c=2+ and 1@d=0-7 or @d, |pg||
nt|jtr: Could declarer misguess the @hs?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: great minds think alike shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra2: looking at bidding, I guess S did everything he could |pg||
pc|sK|nt|brgpro: i dont know for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe North bids 1@h with 4 over the X?|pg||
nt|ronpa: declarer can just not touch trumps for now and let the defence do it for him|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think jan Jansma is not a Dutch doubleton guy...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Hello Bernard and Raija|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|bernix: hi roland|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brgpro: or some version of Polish @c, in that case, 1@d can also be a neg. bid|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|peachy: Hello Roland, Bernard, and all kibitzers|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why did he assume N had such a weak hand. I didnt think N ever said he had only a 10 count|pg||

nt|bernix: chance now to make up for the bad slam by bidding a good one here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|henryb:  Indeed, and gain on the vulnerability|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|mb|d|nt|dburn: but not so easy to reach in the face of spade bidding by the opponents|pg||
nt|dburn: especially if North does not show good diamond support immediately|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|dburn: still, if he bids 5@d now South might bid six, but...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I wonder, is double by S really the preferred action. I suppose it depends on what to expect from N|pg||
pc|sA|mc|12|pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4S6HAK5DAKJ63CK642,SAKJ975H98D4CQ873,ST8HQJT3DQT972CAJ,SQ432H7642D85CT95|sv|n|nt|brgpro: seems to me that|pg||
nt|jtr: Was it really 9?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgd: yes N discarded a @S on the @D7, not a club|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah ok|pg||
nt|sybarra2: (I thnk they play a club system)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: oh i'm sure it is polish club, butthat didnt mean N coiuld not have a better hand|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra2: so I think they can open "anything" that moves|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: so they should get to 6d here then|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|mb|d|nt|brgpro: why ask for 5 card M? he is not happy with 4@h?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe he had "bigger bids" he could make|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra2: escept for opps interferring|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ronpa: now maybe south will pick the Q@D lead|pg||
nt|mich-b: maybe he thinks that bidding on the 3 level will prevent North from overcalling 2@S or 2@D on some hands|pg||
nt|brgpro: but isnt 2@c the same? |pg||
nt|brgpro: maybe it can be some other relays|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I am told:  1S is 12+. 5S was q s and 0 kings. S knew there were no red kings in N hand|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bernix: not a good slam, needs 2 out of 2 finesses|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: S has this monster, and opps flew into (nv) game   ...messing wit us |pg||
mb|5D|nt|jtr: Puppet|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: i know it is puppet...but i wonder why he doesnt use regular stayman|pg||
nt|bernix: on a spade lead|pg||
nt|peachy: Rohowsky here is a veteran player, also was on the team that won 1990 World Championship,|pg||
nt|peachy: Huub Bertens and Berry Westra are household names in the international bridge scene|pg||
nt|bernix: j√∂rg fritsche has represented germany in the past, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: a bit surprised. I thought Polish club would solve this on|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ronpa: Now this is interesting hand|pg||
nt|jtr: To ask for 5M?  Guess they have other uses for 2@c|pg||
nt|brgpro: he still needs to overcome the @c break|pg||
nt|sybarra: how can you solve the wild preempts?   esp. the dutch |pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|peachy: By "veteran" - I dod mean age, just experience. Rohowsky was a junior in 1990|pg||
nt|peachy: don't mean****|pg||
nt|peachy: This unfortunately has zero chance of making, declarer's only hope is opponent revoke LOL. Not coming, for sure.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome back to Jeroen van de Pol|pg||
nt|jpmbs: hi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Jeroen|pg||
nt|jpmbs: with the lightner double a revoke gets less chance also :-)|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe thinks of running into notrumps. from his point of view a @d ruff might be threatening|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe my joke was a bad joke, must be painful for those cheering netherland, sorry|pg||
nt|jpmbs: he will sure thk about that|pg||
nt|sybarra: or any nv opps|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
mc|12|nt|mich-b: he did not have a comfortable entry to dummy to play @C from there|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: this looks optimistic|pg||
nt|henryb:  So the Netherlands needs 13VP to win|pg||
nt|dburn: Jansma no doubt hoping for short hearts opposite - he won't think much of the chances in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|dburn: and he'll be right|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|dburn: still, what with 3@c going down at the other table, it won't be a huge loss|pg||
nt|bernix: depends on how many tricks he will lose|pg||
nt|dburn: although Paulissen may have to guess diamonds wel to get out for down only two|pg||
nt|dburn: and with the entry position as it is (i.e. non-existent) that probably means leading the ten from the dummy now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|dburn: and then guessing to drop the queen next rather than pin the nine|pg||
