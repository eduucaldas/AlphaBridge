nt|hawe45:  Especially after, what happened at board 9, I would have settled for some normal bids here|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No loosing option in 4 @S - but E/W might bid a lot also|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks like an easy 3 NT here - to play, but to bid ?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: difficult problem for west now - he doesn't want to hear 5@H from his partner, so double might not appeal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good practical bidding by South - with game E/W (also)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but as a passed hand partner is perhaps less likely to bid 5@H - if he pulls the double it will generally be with a 3- or 2-suiter, with 4NT, which would be fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Easy...|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|avivs:  lucky 3NT|pg||
nt|avivs:  I would not want to be there looking just at the N/S hands|pg||
nt|avivs:  another push coming on board 11 with E/W in 4@s at other room|pg||
nt|avivs:  this is actually not cold|pg||
nt|avivs:  he will need to go after clubs (likely)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You must guess the @S and decide, which minor has H x by West|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  This will cost 550 - if...|pg||
nt|athene: double is "action" - just takeout-ish, saying he has a good 4@S opener|pg||
nt|athene: north thinks he has a choice now: -500 or -550? :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seen from the North-seat, South shall bring three tricks in the side-suit|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|avivs:  better chances for Hx in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: if you decide that east has Hx in a minor you can start leading a small one from hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|athene: townsend expected a lot of shape for the 5-level overcall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Poor East - he liked his @S-singleton|pg||
nt|athene: he isn't sure if 6@D will make and he isn't sure if 5@S will|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: till now, every bid was alerted|pg||

pc|hK|nt|ntmon: long way to 3N|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|bernix: i just wondered what 2@h meant|pg||
nt|avivs:  the only clue he has is that East has 1 extra heart...|pg||
nt|athene: if he starts with the @DJ and east ducks smoothly he might play west for @DKQ and take another finesse|pg||
nt|avivs:  now will test spades|pg||
nt|avivs:  and when they break 3-3 will finesse West|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzgf: W just asked|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He has only the winning line to play - |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  With a rather poor @D-suit, East might have expected mor high cards by partner|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bernix: a likely push|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||

nt|peachy: Live eunning scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/GBT_2011/11_06_03_team.html|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Oh - only 7 and 8 with results|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If they do not chance the style, they will make 980 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: its start again at 7.30|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  But Blackwood might keep them at the 5-level|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: 7.30 p.m. of course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Discilined NO-1 @S by West|pg||
mb|3S|nt|avivs:  2@c must be artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|bernix: 3@c would be reasonable|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  2 @C is just economy|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|bernix: must shift to clubs now to defeat 3@s|pg||
nt|ntmon: @C switch hardly possible after 3@C|pg||
nt|bernix: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html|pg||
nt|bernix: sorry this is the link for last year's results. link not updated yet|pg||
nt|ntmon: will E work it out anyway?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bernix: he will have no 2nd chance |pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: good!|pg||
nt|bernix: very well done, not easy to see|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: i have to say i would have overcalled 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: west has a plan|pg||
nt|athene: give his partner a club ruff|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|avivs:  the way this session is going for them he should have bid this 25% slam...|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: in textbookland when opps bid and raise clubs, and you have four, you know you can give partner a second-round ruff|pg||
nt|avivs:  50% that the @sK is one of the missing KCs and not off 2 aces and 50% that its on side|pg||
nt|athene: sadly in the real world, things don't work out so well|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|athene: but i guess they like to have a real suit at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ntmon: looks like well deserved 5 IMPs for Netherlands |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  I hate to admit it, but I agree with them|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: Bakhshi thinks that the lead was a singleton so taking the trump finesse is more likely to run into a club ruff, i guess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Are the players still at the table?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|avivs:  a very knwledgeable person informed me that North knew it's on the finesse since 3NT showed bad trumps...|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ntmon: 4@S "routine"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Heart lead in OR - and allthough East ducked the first @C - 12 tricks|pg||
nt|avivs:  he chose not to risk a slam on finesse plus trumps might break poorly even when K is onside|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  6 @D depending on the @C.suit|pg||
nt|athene: i don't like south's bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: you have two aces and FOUR (yes, that was four) card support for partner's first bid suit|pg||
nt|athene: and he has made a jump shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 2@D art GF|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: it's not as though David Gold was well-known for throwing tricks away as declarer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is no better, why not 3 @D - wait and see|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@H= doubleton|pg||
nt|peachy: Particularly, as I think he is aware  yhay the 3NT was a pickup|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: townsend knows the cards lie badly - his minor-suit honours are likely over strength in west's hand|pg||
nt|avivs:  very unlucky for him to catch east with @d void|pg||
nt|athene: and his partner hopefully has hearts over east|pg||
nt|athene: plus there is the trump break :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|athene: but he might lose just a club and two hearts|pg||

nt|hawe45:  No it comes...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D K|pg||
nt|avivs:  @dK|pg||
nt|peachy: even small diamond happens to work, straight crossruff |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|s4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|hawe45:  2 instead of 3 IMP|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|avivs:  North could have set them with a trump return when in with @cK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|h2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|peachy: spade length was already advertised so that is declarer's line|pg||
nt|athene: no, trump back didn't beat|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can even cash a trump himself just to confirm the layout|pg||
nt|peachy: one rd trumps does not hurt|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|s5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: not sure why he had to bid 5@D|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|athene: and the fact that declarer can make after cashing one trump suggests he should have made it even without the double|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: so the double didn't cost that much|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: vey hard for south not to double this|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C D = 300|pg||
nt|athene: i mean he thinks he has three tricks in his hand :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ntmon: ouch|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: they claimed for just made and then corrected it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems, you can make 4 @H - og the @S-guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, maybe @CA is not a trick|pg||
nt|athene: but still....|pg||
nt|athene: anyway double having splintered shows his hand pretty well|pg||
nt|athene: overbidding a bit to be sure of reaching the right strain|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|ntmon: a slam should not be missed|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|bernix: this may help south|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|hK|nt|ntmon: 5@S asking for good trumps|pg||
nt|ntmon: the answer is yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If North plays later on @S to the King, West shall duck smoothly...!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: yes, that would be nice|pg||

nt|ntmon: bye all|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d2|nt|athene: but would east really make a weak jump oevrcall with six solid AND @SA?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The rule for West: Never take a trick, without having a good reason to do it|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer knows east had 1-6 in the red suits|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a dream come true in the spade suit, needs to guess (no guess really) ace and then hope for J10 tight or A doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: he knows that of course if east has a small singleton spade a spade switch at trick 3 would have beaten the contract|pg||
nt|avivs:  Thanks to Bill, Raija  and hans and also to Anna our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: but that doesn't mean you should definitely not play for that because it's not so clearcut for east to shift to the spade|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  In open room plays was like here. But then West took the @S Ace over the king - and played another @S. The finesse = 1 down|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
