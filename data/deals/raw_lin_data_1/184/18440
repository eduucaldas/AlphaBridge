mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jcwla: Error|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: So true -- so often with such hands the only effect will be to guarantee pd's lead of the suit, here you have no reason to put your eggs in that basket.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Undoubtedly the N hand will open, 1@C if playing a natural system.|pg||
nt|jcwla: E has nothing to say and S will respond first in 1@S holding 5-5 in the majors.|pg||
nt|jcwla: W has no bid and N will rebid @C.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now S is in a bit of a predicament but will probably rebid 2@H.|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's a question of whether they get to the @H game.  Will want to ruff some cards in the short hand so it plays nicely with the even split.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Not to worry, folks, there have been VG problems all week from Canada - they will get sorted out eventually, it is hoped.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|jcwla: Now here is the hand we started with - plays really well in @H and rightly or wrongly they have found a way there.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not crystal clear how best to get there, any thoughts on a perfect auction?|pg||
nt|psyck: rebidding that wretched @c suit thrice sure helped :)|pg||

nt|jcwla: Now it is possible to have a couple of agreements here, one is Lebensohl.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another is "scrambling 2NT" - where N bids 2NT to say they have no five-card suit - and any suit bid would show five.|pg||
