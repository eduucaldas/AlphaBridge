nt|peachy: Curiously enough, NS system summary shows 2D = 1Major|pg||

nt|barnets: to find out about the trump Q|pg||
nt|ritong: would you, barnet?|pg||
nt|barnets: that is if he knows how to bid it|pg||

nt|barnets: i think 2@D is natural and weak|pg||
nt|daman: we are starting with Board 5     we missed the first 4 boards    will catch up with them later|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D now by South should show this sort of hand    but 3NT is a stone on the layout|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: good x by east in open|pg||
nt|barnets: he knew his partner had 1 spade on auction|pg||

nt|daman: North should pass|pg||

nt|andyv:  both rooms should get to 4@h..only question is whether EW will take the 5@d push|pg||
nt|othered1: more like will west solo to 5@D, since east doesn't have much positive  to say with those tricks in defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  and spec points out that 4@s is another possible EW contract|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|othered1: So do I|pg||
nt|barnets: and will be a nice swing for lynch|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: unless they get the ruffs right now, then a lesser swing|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|othered1: I think 4@S has more disaster potential than 5@D|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: NS did well in the closed room to land in 3@D and make|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mikam1: This allowed South to double showing diamonds and North to push on to 3@D|pg||

mb|2D|nt|daman: this must be multi landy?|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D = one major|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  E's @h bid will make it harder to get to the slam|pg||
nt|othered1: Every time I make a contrarian play like that, turns out it was contrary to *our* success |pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S is the winning bid here|pg||
nt|othered1: And was made in the OR|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  E should raise here|pg||

nt|athene: having given up control in trumps, north has to be a bit worried about declarer running the spades|pg||
nt|athene: you might expect him to try to cash out in the minors - he would have to find his partner with one king and get him in to lead to the other AQ|pg||

nt|othered1: 1N says they never bypass 4-card majors in responding to 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: but Hamman would more likely be aggressive with both major kings|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: and if south does have the @SK then @DA and @DQ is sure to beat the contract even if it gives hamman his @DK - they will get the @CAQ when south gets in|pg||

nt|mikam1: Right Roland...agreed|pg||
nt|mikam1: Sometimes all the fancy stuff just gets you in trouble|pg||
nt|scotty: I think that would be a mistake - she should at least attemp to get to hearts if partner has 3-card @h|pg||

mb|3C!|an|transfer|nt|mikam1: You know your customers Michael|pg||
nt|scotty: Yes, 2n is @c|pg||
nt|mikam1: Migry would do well to stay out of this one|pg||

nt|mikam1: I see|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk6: Very nice|pg||
nt|scotty: North passed fast, I guess - the vugraph operator often waits for the second bid behind the screen |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|Walddk6: Migry will lead a spade but which|pg||
nt|mikam1: this will do just fine...with the hearts splitting|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I think there is a case for the jack or 8|pg||
nt|mikam1: perhaps Roland...but shortness likely on your left, no?  Or do you mean to unblock?|pg||
nt|Walddk6: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I am hoping to get in with @DK|pg||
nt|scotty: The J looks dangerous, and either J or 8 might confuse partner - it's not like you've bid spades|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||

nt|mikam1: lo and behold....they split!|pg||
nt|Walddk6: If hearts don't come in she is far away from 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mikam1: right|pg||
nt|mikam1: good hand for positive thinking :)|pg||
nt|scotty: Well, if S has @d and N has clubs, you can make against 4-2 hearts also|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Hoping for @CQ as an entry, yes|pg||
nt|mikam1: you mean concede a heart to North and get to dummy with club queen|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes|pg||

nt|ritong: one of weichsel's problems currently is: if i raise @ds, what will be the agreed suit|pg||

pc|h6|nt|andyv:  the tough part is now|pg||

nt|athene: declarer's only worry now is holding the trump losers to one|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you ruff a diamond now|pg||
nt|athene: you know west has the king still so that isn't getting overruffed|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @d ruff, E pitches @c|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but you might still be able to combine chances in trumps|pg||
nt|athene: with some trump coup possibilities|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||

mb|3S|nt|scotty: Over 3@s, do we like double or 4@h?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: soooo....|pg||
nt|ritong: is that one mundane?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: the idea of ruffing some diamonds was that you might then be able to cash the @HAK and even if west showed out you would not necessarily be dead|pg||
nt|athene: as you might have a trump coup against east|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hand|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|daman: 3NT from the Nprth hand is the best spot|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: on the rule of 11, north has one club higher than the six|pg||
nt|athene: if it's the king or jack you want to play low in dummy; if it's the 9 or 8 you want to stick in the ten|pg||
nt|othered1: Deutsch has gotten into the lead on the basis of that potential slam on board 42, where they found 6@D in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: assuming you can get south on lead next|pg||
nt|andyv:  so odds about 2-1 in favor of 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  as most don't lead away from Jacks|pg||
nt|athene: isn't it exactly 50-50?|pg||
nt|barnets: and this made it more difficult for /s|pg||
nt|daman: North*|pg||
mb|2N|nt|barnets: n/s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|barnets: a good tactical bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, he sort of wants to be in dummy to finesse spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|barnets: and then found a good opening lead V 3n|pg||
nt|barnets: the @D J|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: so maybe this is reasonable|pg||
nt|barnets: so good play by passel to put pressure on n/s|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|othered1: Remember, the score shown here is not official.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|barnets: south could have taken out 3N but left it in|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: if you played low and north did turn up with a big card, then your natural play would be a diamond, which might allow north to put a club through anyway|pg||
nt|barnets: the def must cash another diamond now|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c4|nt|ritong: i think 11 or 12 do not change imp|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|barnets: thats a tie|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  Deutsch has gone ahead by bidding the slam on board 42|pg||
nt|athene: bramley can make 11 but only if he finesses the spade, i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  so with 17 boards to go, this promises to be a very match|pg||
nt|athene: he might have enough of a count to do that|pg||
nt|andyv:  exciting that is:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: he will see south has five diamonds and one heart|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|scotty: Not only is it a (slightly) higher range than 1N opening, but also your partner's strong hand is sirtting over the opening bid, so cards are more likely to be well-placed|pg||
