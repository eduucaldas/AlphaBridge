mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: EW have few points but can make the higher contract, 4@H even|pg||
nt|athene: 200 might not be enought|pg||
nt|athene: enough|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,very obedient, or bring @SA to grand child...|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|athene: the way the auction went in the other room, maybe east did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing his opponents into a making 4@S|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: he surely has enough for it otherwise with 6-5|pg||
nt|athene: in general you should assume that if opps have 4@S on they are going to bid it anyway, i think|pg||
nt|athene: i see a lot more imps lost because people under-compete|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Passivity is the big IMP loser|pg||
nt|westjava: in the not necessary compete...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also have bid 3@H with West's cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now 3@H from west isn't guaranteeing four hearts|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: might be 4-3-4-2, for example|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: really 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|westjava: 3@H, operator (Surya)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: yes. right.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: it's normal enough to bid 3@H with west over 2@S i think|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|athene: a good general rule is that you should be prepared to go one level higher than you would have done, to show a fit for partner|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: so if west was intending to bid only 2@H over the double he can bid 3@H when forced to|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|s7|nt|vugraphzgs: it was 3d (W)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can because he would have bid 3@H on an auction like  1@D  pass 1@H|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|westjava: yes ty:)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: well i'm not convinced you are quite worth 3@H on that sort of sequence but certainly you have a very sound 2@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: these jump raises do seem to be lighter these days|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe it's borderline|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I count 16, 13 hcp + a singleton|pg||
nt|westjava: I am told : say to athene... no dicipline & and No rule in indonesia....as long as u enjoy ...just do it!!:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that I don't know anything about spades|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: yes, true, if the auction is uncontested you don't know partner has a singleton spade so your @SK might be worth a bit more in attack|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c2|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As I don't have 2Â½@H in my box I will bid 3|pg||

pc|c3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|pc|d7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: when east bids 3@C on this auction that might be something like 4@H-6@C so i don't think west can bid 4@H|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: he knows it's a big misfit in the side suits so there is no trick source, just a crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: and a 4-4 fit is not nearly as good as a 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|ahalim: well you might try Roland, pull out the 2@H and 3@H cards together|pg||

nt|athene: standard way to show a 2 1/2 @H bid is to finger the 2@H bid, finger the 3@H bid, mutter, grumble, then say "he never has a good hand" and bid 2@H|pg||

nt|ahalim: 5@D makes also|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: if north had something like @DKQxxxx he would probably just bid 3nt over 2nt, so you can't hope for that much|pg||
