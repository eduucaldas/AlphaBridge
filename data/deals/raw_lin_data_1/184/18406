nt|ianmcc: Hi Fridrik we start with a slam|pg||
nt|friggi: looks like it|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT will be reached by n/s|pg||
nt|haans: EW playing BOOK an old Swedish System more than 40 years old Big Clubs|pg||
nt|ady: hi Bernard|pg||
mb|3N|nt|robinswr: i wonder if anyone would open the minimum number of diamonds allowed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a routine 4@s|pg||
nt|muppe: NS seem to play two-way @c|pg||
nt|jjsb: what i do know is that in any system u open west's hand :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: good day for everyone watching|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Routine 3NT for NS.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for running scores etc|pg||
nt|robinswr: by south|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 @S shd be universal here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi, this is a problem hand to bid with east|pg||
nt|ianmcc: best in NT!|pg||
nt|gmarco24: hi all  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Friggi, Ian and Marko|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: retract 4@S|pg||
nt|friggi: but they could go up to 7 |pg||
nt|haans: NS  Big Clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: Norway is the defending champions from Lillehammer 2007 and they are also the current leaders|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|haans: dont understand 2@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: lead invating opening here|pg||
nt|jwit: Not that wild about multi bid on 5 card suit and weak hand vulnerable|pg||
nt|jwit: East let them off the hook|pg||
nt|friggi: but that would have been more fun for us:)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Edwin|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: nagic diamonds thus 1@S 8-12 can have longer minor|pg||
nt|haans: magic|pg||
nt|haans: good game with spades 3-3|pg||
nt|haans: NS play Carrot clubs|pg||
nt|bjurn:  W is probably worried about a misfit|pg||
nt|haans: helping EW avoid slamming|pg||
nt|jwit: Not likely to bid a slam anyway, however, without the 2D bid, 4H would have problems.  Now at least declarer will know spade suit is breaking badly.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi to all kibs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  running scores|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1@c will be openign in a stronger and i guess also in some natural system (unless u decide for 2nt) |pg||
nt|muppe: 1@c being 10-12 bal or any 16+|pg||
nt|jjsb: ok Vesa thanks ! |pg||
nt|ady: needs some care   should play hearts first|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Bernard|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: 8 tricks 9th in clubs?|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|jjsb: not clear at all what to play here ... 4@h seems to be the contract but not sure its easy to reach it |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|zebutin: interestingly they they have typed some of finnish players first names too, so from finland there are playing Pia Erkkilä and Hulda Ahonen, pair that plays strong club (15+)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: also welcome to Magnus|pg||
nt|haans: got that better |pg||
nt|haans: skipping bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Hans, Jon and Dan|pg||
nt|haans: odds against 4@S|pg||
nt|muppe: and EW play Natural 5542|pg||
nt|ady: hi Haans|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|grebrof: the norwegians are playing a natural system with 5 card majors - the finnish girls prefer a strong (+15hp) 1@c|pg||

nt|haans: a make|pg||
nt|mmmakela: there ara exact tools....|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a good idea|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|jjsb: and i think this will be the contract |pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  Frisk start med en oplagt slem...|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Hans and Dan|pg||
nt|haans: vScore: http://landslagsbridge.se/ + Twitter|pg||
nt|grebrof: 12?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can make 12 tricks on the placement of cards.|pg||
nt|haans: hi Espen|pg||
nt|derric: hello again|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Not the best of suits to overcall 1@s but some would, especially if pd has not passed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  so he did not|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but will lead one|pg||
nt|jjsb: with nothing bad happening |pg||
nt|jjsb: @s mead will come and well we know what will happen |pg||
nt|haans: Hi Narki|pg||
pc|hT|nt|iceking: S took a rather passive view here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W can perhaps see, that 1@d is bid on a 4-card suit, so a small from dummy|pg||
nt|iceking: not sure i could play def vs 2@H here, though bidding is little strange also as you are not sure you have fitt anywere|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Gautis|pg||
nt|haans: Hej Roland Jon & Dan|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3NT is better|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Markku|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hello Markku|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so now 9 from top|pg||
nt|muppe: 3NT a bit gambling, who needs stoppers?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gautis2: hello, and good morning:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: He may be a bit biassed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wife playing as South|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is the winning contract - espescially now with the natural @d-lead from E|pg||
nt|fabsayc: explain|pg||
nt|muppe: This time indeed N had easy @S lead.|pg||
nt|haans: Marko :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Kunne Ãst ikke have overmeldt med 4 Ru?|pg||
nt|grebrof: the norwegians are naturalists (besides the bery weak NT in nonvul 1st-3rd) opposite the more artificial approach from the finnish|pg||
nt|haans: finns Magic Diamond?|pg||
nt|grebrof: I have thai keyboard, so there is a chance for mistyping - bery = very|pg||
nt|haans: yes close for me 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: these two plays magid diamond . the other pair strong @c|pg||
nt|sharkey: I have the same problem Espen - not Thai but Thumbs....|pg||
nt|grebrof: lol|pg||
nt|grebrof: I will try to look before I post|pg||
nt|grebrof: back to the game...|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt  a make|pg||
nt|grebrof: this ended in a draw 15-15VP last meeting|pg||
nt|sharkey: Marianne Harding and Ann Karin Fuglestad are the anchor pair of the Norwegian team - many years international experience|pg||
nt|grebrof: duck a @D is a loser if @ds are QJ block, but will make 9 tricks anyhow|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|haans: no they have played Magic Diamond before here|pg||
nt|haans: say yesterday |pg||
nt|runnerup: no it is the other pair|pg||
nt|haans: :) ok|pg||
nt|jwit: Still a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|robinswr: I play 4@h as an artificial spade slam try |pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi Marko|pg||
nt|ady: 2nd heart best|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: any way safer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure that hand justifies it|pg||
nt|gmarco24: narko?  :)|pg||
nt|haans: Both play Big Club|pg||
nt|haans: My odds for 3nt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gautis2: figure i still not know her well enoghe since i dont have a clue what 3@h means:)|pg||
nt|haans: still done understand 3@C cards for only 2@S|pg||
nt|bjurn:  this should be makeable if W handles @H with only two losers|pg||
nt|haans: Johansson may get a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Hi Hans, Skafti|pg||
nt|haans: transfer (to NT) response|pg||
nt|robinswr: obvious they don't do that|pg||
nt|jjsb: its gambling but maybe not much of alternative... basically play that when ur partenr shows a balanced hand , considering there is no overcall ?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bridge_one: 4@H better that 3Nt|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|iceking: was no rush for Ace of @D|pg||
nt|grebrof: hello Hans :)|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, and at least they got the play in the right hand. Diamond lead through East would make a difficult hand more difficult|pg||
nt|bridge_one: losing 1@h 1@S and 1@D need a good job to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @D can be discarded aver K@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need a correct timing|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Hi - mys danish were just the daily exercises...|pg||
nt|iceking: low would keep better control af everything|pg||
nt|sharkey: undo?|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing special happened because ew has 8-9 trick in clubs |pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think declarer will use a cross ruff |pg||
pc|d9|nt|grebrof: Stine has had some very good results, so its about time she got her chance for the national team (gautis being biased or not)|pg||
nt|grebrof: she is NOT playing with you now my friend :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2NT may be with 5 hearts so bidding an error|pg||
nt|diaoff: Hi all|pg||
nt|haans: missed a trick |pg||
nt|haans: defense|pg||
nt|haans: @H9 and 8 = dubble stopper|pg||
pc|d5|nt|zebutin: different openings from 1st/2nd hand and 3rd/4th for finnish pair, but from 1st and 2nd they play weak nt, and 1@D-1@S openings are 10-14 and 4card suit|pg||
nt|gautis2: :) ..well, cant argue with sucess, since 4@s was born to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=475&csm=Rank&nt=3&nb=1&csh=0000000000111|pg||
nt|Walddk5: running scores|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes - Harding - Fuglestad also was part of the team that won last time at Lillehammer in 2007|pg||
nt|cenglund:  SpA was hardly discarded|pg||
nt|sharkey: She really pitched @SA on @C lead operator?|pg||
nt|haans: spade ace|pg||
nt|haans: on lead|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: Finland 2009 was the last championships I am told (thanks Geo) - looking at the unions homepage, you might get tricked|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - E sh come in first to play a heart through|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I play as here, 4 @H 55 no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|ady: now in some danger  if east clears ddiamonds will need to take spade finesse for contract|pg||
nt|haans: allmost all Swedish players (at IMPs) play some kind of Big Clubs|pg||
nt|ady: had declarer played a 2nd heart east would have no entry unless ducking again  in which case declarer plays clubs finessing into west hand  and spade finesse then not needed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: and S has been cought already after trick1|pg||
nt|iceking: not so odd open room reached 4@H-3, |pg||
nt|gmarco24: 4@h was a slam try? do they play std 1nt or weak?  :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: well its not MP|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: Operator wake up :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|grebrof: and Rashed :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Finland needs a 22-8 win to go past Denmark|pg||
nt|friggi: This is straight forward play|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi and welcome.|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes, 3NT could work, and you dont have any good bid either|pg||
nt|jjsb: not knowing much of the system (at least for me) hard to comment where the "mistake" is , if any |pg||
nt|gmarco24: had to work on this one to make|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: this deal just boring|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|nubmaster: The Icelandic pair plays a 5533 system with better minor and 1NT 14-17 and the Swedes 5542 with transfers after 1@c|pg||
nt|diaoff: yes, time to claim|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: best low hearts|pg||
nt|mmmakela: claim time|pg||
nt|haans: may need luck|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|jwit: Surprised at that play.  Diamond to the A, A of clubs pitch a diamond, ruff a club, heart to the ace, ruff another club, would put declarer in great shape|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|iceking: hi Krishna|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he3llo|pg||
nt|haans: good carding in defense best|pg||
nt|gmarco24: @hs are protected, but @d is dangerous now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|runnerup: ok that is a lot but very many big swings in many matches has been seen before so who knows|pg||
nt|haans: odds against E having 4 hearts|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, i thought declarer would play in thet way|pg||
pc|cT|nt|robinswr: I see no reason to explore another fit once you have found one|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: what to discard on 5th clubs|pg||
nt|gmarco24: sooner or later he'll play @s to K. A@s, J@d would set this|pg||
pc|s7|nt|zebutin: For swedish women sadly i dont know their system, so we just have to wait and see|pg||

nt|grebrof: good slam|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 8-11|pg||

nt|derric: likely passed out|pg||
nt|peachy: Which is why 2NT is called the slamkiller, though was not last hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  running scores|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C a good alternative|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@s on NS|pg||
nt|iceking: good slam here |pg||
nt|iceking: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|grebrof: the +15 @c comes into action|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pass or Correct|pg||
nt|diaoff: 4NT now, maybe?|pg||
nt|haans: yep find it now|pg||
nt|jbgood: but of course difficult to know what to do on S's cards - doesnt know about the di void|pg||
nt|diaoff: If she passes, She will soon find out the possibility I guess|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 h has poschances -by w at least|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1@D 8-11 bal, 4M 4+m or 5-5ms|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1@H relay|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@H bal 4@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: some might overcall 2@h|pg||
nt|muppe: Good slam for EW but they are just missing two aces|pg||
nt|jjsb: we all know basically we want to play 5@d of course 1@s 2@d 3@d seems the road |pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt without hearts lead best :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: lot of options for S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They finished in 5@c last deal in open after some relay bids with 3 rounds of @h for -1|pg||
nt|jbgood: one push - yes, she will be wiser if W prefers @d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a grand.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D alerted bec not forcing ( i suppose)|pg||
nt|haans: grossly overbidding|pg||
nt|muppe: So that means that slam doesnt make|pg||
nt|jjsb: not the slam is far of out of question by west of coruse ! i dotn have to precise |pg||
nt|ady: east very agressive |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: chose drury|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@C probably one way drury|pg||
nt|sharkey: If N can find a take out x now....|pg||
nt|haans: 1. Interview Fulvio Fantoni http://www.confsudbridge.org/hitsII/fantoni001i.aspx: If you had to choose a convention, which one would you pick?|pg||
nt|haans: 2. Fantoni: Gazzilli... is a convention that I think should be used by all who play natural bridge|pg||
nt|haans: 3. Gazzilli:  http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/public/1239625981_14209_FT0_gazzillind.pdf |pg||
nt|grebrof: 2@d showing +8hp (if Gazilli)|pg||
nt|friggi: no problems here|pg||
nt|haans: But Aldeborg very right|pg||
nt|ady: no preference from west|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bjurn:  2@S more relay|pg||
nt|muppe: Maybe W can now just ask keys.|pg||
nt|muppe: And he does|pg||
nt|jjsb: ok so west wand to know aces to know what level to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@d showing a good opening with at least game interest|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D real opening,as i play myself here i would bid 3@D with north hand natural and slammish|pg||
nt|nubmaster: So a good start for Sweden here|pg||
nt|gautis2: partscore battle|pg||
nt|grebrof: as a guess I would think the dbl of 1@h from E is 5-7hp - their card says nothing about what "neg dbls" are|pg||
nt|gautis2: i guess x shows hp s not @s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: too complicated to remember Haans:)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D GF if strong|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is a game|pg||
nt|haans: puppet|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in contrary 1X is often a game killer passed out|pg||
nt|haans: nat still not find hearts lead|pg||
nt|haans: may|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6@D had been my choice|pg||
nt|jbgood: dbl seems a bit much? Prd is likely to have 10 minor cards...|pg||
nt|haans: scary|pg||
nt|haans: best for EW|pg||
nt|derric: ok, wouldn't re-open opposite 12-14NT|pg||
nt|jjsb: practical bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@d a nice treatment there Magnus|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 3D/3H transfer nodays 3@C just showing max|pg||
nt|jbgood: so a doubled overtrick...|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree its a good convention - you rarely stop in 2@c anyway|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would for sure|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not much to lose, lots to gain|pg||
nt|runnerup: 800 -a game yes|pg||
nt|runnerup: and for nothing real game |pg||
nt|mmmakela: and Hulda did nice to pas(of course imo)|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok 500 |pg||
nt|mmmakela: although 4 @H might slip home this is a sure winner|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes nicely nosed to pass -good decision|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bidding duplicated in OR|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok that s for that winning then|pg||
nt|haans: in my opinion not cards for 1@S|pg||
nt|skaftij:  easy 4@s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: puppet seq|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@h cheap|pg||
nt|haans: can make 4@S ?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ianmcc: 4@h seems to need to find @dQ, tho 4th @s could be useful|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no, 420|pg||
nt|ianmcc: in fact makes if no @c switch|pg||
nt|ady: lack of penalty double of 4@H may point to a heart lead|pg||
nt|haans: and alive :)|pg||
nt|haans: good point David|pg||
nt|ady: should cross to north to play first round of clubs   in case of stiff ace with east|pg||
pc|s8|nt|zebutin: in 4@H you would seem to lose 2 @S + @C, because spades are 3-3 you can throw one diamond to 4th spade|pg||
nt|zebutin: so might not need to quess diamond suit|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room finnish women played 2@S some down, there is magic diamond system in effect, that has 8-11 openings in 1st and 2nd hand, so makes often for different scores|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is a very good contract for NS|pg||
nt|haans: You can later read: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/public/1239625981_14209_FT0_gazzillind.pdf |pg||
nt|bjurn:  2NT 3433 or 34(42) (I think)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2NT =4@C (ty kibs)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@S 3424, 3 controls (A=2, K=1)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  so EW will probably end up in 4@S now|pg||
nt|haans: may go slamming?|pg||
nt|bjurn:  E needs @HA, @DK and @DA to be onside|pg||
nt|haans: clubs king in diamond|pg||
nt|bjurn:  or @DAK and @HA to be onside|pg||
nt|bjurn:  @SJxx @HQxxx @DAK @Cxxxx might be a picture|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or 2@D = 3@H support |pg||
nt|gmarco24: A@s>10@d or A@s>@c ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jjsb: not the important to play 41/30 if @c are the trump of course as i forgot a lot of bid i just decide to make it like this everytime :) |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|psyck: N will likely blast to slam in spite of missing a keycard|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Anyone who can tell us about the bidding here? 2NT like good/bad NT or something?|pg||
nt|haans: thats a "modern" weak 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl from N is good seing the layout|pg||
nt|jwit: Don't mind it non vulnerable at one level.  If nothing else, it is surely the suit you want led|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so to open 2 NT/ 1x is delicate business|pg||
nt|robinswr: this auction doesn't make sense to me. at some point someone has to limit their hand. also if there is no slam posibility then why describe your hands|pg||
pc|c5|nt|derric: good morning|pg||
pc|c7|nt|iceking: W made a very light 3rd seat opening in open room|pg||
nt|grebrof: can they count to 13?|pg||
nt|peachy: Current trend is to respond lighter than we did in the past so the 1x passed is less prominent danger|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mbruun:  THis aggressive lead will cost the defense a trick, and HQ another one, so all of a sudden nine tricks turned to eleven. No big deal in teams though |pg||
nt|haans: scoring blood|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@S is a mild slam try, if I remember correctly|pg||
nt|haans: do like that bidding :)|pg||
nt|haans: often you start with relays all ending in slam Then you get older|pg||
nt|haans: no good lead|pg||
nt|jjsb: we can have a coffee :) (not sure we will have time to drink it thougth) :) |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder what 5@s here was|pg||
nt|iceking: 4nt might be even number of aces |pg||
nt|psyck: oh Turbo|pg||
nt|iceking: at least it looks like it |pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably negative|pg||
nt|iceking: been told 4nt shows 3+aces|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, not Turbo then, just their own methods|pg||
nt|iceking: nicely done anyway |pg||
nt|nubmaster: well done here, both K and J in @s works so no trouble with Q of @h offside|pg||
nt|gautis2: not fan of 4@h  ..better to do an invitasional bid after 2@s ...not this "shot"|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is sometimes the problem with strong 1@c - in a contested auction like this, you dont always know if 2@s is a bid with 4 or 5 @ss - now they escaped|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe...|pg||
nt|sharkey: may escape with down 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice to see such a young table in a very strong competition like this|pg||
nt|haans: dont understand @DA now does Fuglestad know who has @DK and Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E can therefore 5NT.|pg||
nt|haans: yes that is true |pg||
nt|jwit: Great start for declarer|pg||
nt|haans: but with spades you can come in later|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S with 3A 4333 and opener up isn't so ortodoxe - better a inviting bid with raise (2N, 2@H depending on agreements)|pg||
nt|ady: not good play   but will be ok|pg||
pc|dA|nt|zebutin: good day Juho, its allready 14.00 in finland...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Juho, 2100 in Melbourne|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks and next|pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like one loser in each suit|pg||
nt|jwit: Not that easy if you are at the 3 level the next time it's your turn to bid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mmmakela: boring no chance for 6 except dias lead and K|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H seems too much with no spade honour, and i would for sure bid slam with south hand as auction went|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dirty waters but ok this time|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gautis2: y, should  be 200|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - 4 nt told about 4 @ds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: EW play udca, 1st discard o/e|pg||
nt|bjurn:  wont be any problem to get 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@H i meant|pg||
nt|robinswr: lucky can't misguess diamonds|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes nothing special in the play. NS just take their two aces.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|psyck: after Souths free bid & jump to 4@s, N could have also bid slam other table, but was tougher after opps intervention i guess|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that's telling them|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: :( :( :( Gazzilli :( :( :(|pg||
nt|grebrof: lol|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|mbruun:  Back to nine again. Interesting|pg||
nt|gautis2: board 1 was a coopy of 3NT, so well done to both teams|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like the overtrick has gone - much easier for us seeing all cards to make 12 of course|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bridge_one: well done small @D by West ! playing K would lose a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  running scores|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: Rimsted should have started with Blackwood|pg||
nt|haans: agree with boring|pg||
nt|mmmakela: C 10 odd nmbr|pg||
pc|s4|nt|grebrof: otherwise I agree with not bidding 4@h (allthou it looks like P has a single @s) but P only made a single raise - guess they have ways to show a better raise - well, the ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: vulnerability is "right", so can understand 4@h too|pg||
nt|diaoff: Unless color blind, the opps also know the vulnerabilities, so I also vote for 6@D.|pg||
nt|haans: and play must be safe|pg||
nt|gmarco24: poor S is thinking about singleton K@d or Kx@d at W... only what works for him|pg||
nt|haans: ruff with @HA play more hearts?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|haans: Why did Aldeborg bid 4@H To show better hearts or ...|pg||
nt|ady: can finesse in diamonds now   should assume east at least 5-5 in majors   and has shown 2 clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: best defense|pg||
nt|diaoff: Thats also easier from here than at the table though...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|nubmaster: In Open Marie and Pia get to 4@h which seems to be doomed, especially when E lead a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was a bad play. return @cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and defence will have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not finessing @h first round... doesn't matter if E got the Q alone... E indicates both A and Q of @s because of the play|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ofc, Kxx is less likely|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|runnerup: j spades and 800|pg||
nt|derric: declarer discarding @DJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no|pg||
pc|c9|nt|iceking: 1@S in closed room was the problem, for sure S should have bidded more powerful bid then 1@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what bid did the damage? other than 6@S:)|pg||

nt|gautis2: is there a break?  (catfight? :) )|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: the director is coming here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Visst|pg||
nt|grebrof: viewing all 4 hands is sometimes a snag, cause you never know what they be thinking - pauses that might make a difference at the table are not always felt the same way by us|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: the Norweigen girls are asking about their bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont know the finnish strengt in a catfight, but I guess the norwegians are mediocre there :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: pherhaps 2@s bid is explained as something else?  Cant see the line of play if it is "as it is"|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont think N has a case here|pg||
nt|gautis2: i do.. :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down|pg||
nt|diaoff: All for the excitement :)|pg||
nt|haans: is that correct English = Norse?|pg||

nt|sharkey: Guess she asked for it - now just make it....|pg||
nt|grebrof: this CAN make|pg||
nt|haans: home if hearts better|pg||
nt|derric: yes, 0-7hcp 5-6M|pg||
nt|haans: ahh she have extra :)|pg||
nt|derric: this can be defeated|pg||
nt|haans: pass 17+ or weak|pg||
nt|jjsb: but see that hand !!|pg||
nt|jjsb: hard to resist with a powerfull 5 5 |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: when she doesn't balance it argues bad spades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh dear... system error|pg||
nt|grebrof: N showing 20-21hp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this will probably run to the J, and N will switch to a Major. the question is - which one?|pg||
nt|haans: agressive defense are not called for|pg||
nt|runnerup: Anni dint open in other table ,althought they have also that weak,very weak 2h opening  |pg||
nt|haans: dont understand 1nt (5 minor + and 4-c M??)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: E/W could be in trouble|pg||
mb|2H|nt|diaoff: Looks like 140 in sight for EW|pg||
nt|haans: all in right|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Ah - East wanted to know, which major South had, before bidding 3 NT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Here you'd like to play canapé, first showing 4c @s and then longer @d but there's no room for that|pg||
nt|grebrof: the good @c-suit being the missing hp|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I bet she is not going to make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even be 170|pg||
nt|haans: Solid bidding by NS|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dias ruff beats 4 @H|pg||
nt|friggi: I think they already are|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: y, fair upgrade|pg||
nt|grebrof: never lead from the J as they say - no leads look appealing for E|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very favourable layout.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|bjurn:  I wonder what 2@H by East would've meant|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and 3 clubs to add to that(that's why I dbl)|pg||
nt|jjsb: 3@d some kind of 4th suit and 3 nt will stop that i think |pg||
mb|2S|nt|yuval10: @s looks reasonable enough|pg||
nt|haans: in my book 5-5 er|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I am not a fan of that|pg||
nt|friggi: no anymore:)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: rescued|pg||
nt|gmarco24: almost everything off side here|pg||
nt|muppe: Indeed, so 3NT that is|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now we just need Olausson as West, then the confusion is complete|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nubmaster: They play transfer bids over 1@c, ie 1@d=@h etc...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: next and some coffee brb|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just 9 tricks, not very friendly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Careful defense will hold this to nine tricks, if South ducks heart in trick 2|pg||
nt|psyck: not a good start for Iceland|pg||
nt|iceking: might be the worsed possible dummy W could get|pg||
nt|iceking: now @D return and 4 down for 1100|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but major suit wastages were known on bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but couldn´t W suspect bad @s honours on E?|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Christer|pg||
nt|haans: yep my money on that 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is always a wrong line, but ok|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and will be, once N gets in with @C Q will play spades|pg||
nt|haans: somethimes cost that strong hand have the options|pg||
nt|robinswr: actually i would double a 1@c opener also|pg||
nt|jjsb: this will probably defeat the contract as i see it .. |pg||
nt|muppe: Cards dont lie well for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: you only need from partner something like HXX for it to be very successful. not this time though|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or pd's suit?|pg||
nt|friggi: this will make due the friendly layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: not me ever if nat|pg||
nt|ianmcc: probably one down|pg||
nt|friggi: but decl has tempo to collect 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Alsowithout ducking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if 1@h shows @s - why not bid the 6-card @d?|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes, this is unlikely to make.|pg||
nt|jjsb: u basically win if @c are working (assuming @d are not 52 so its probably the loine choosing |pg||
nt|muppe: @cQ dropping and @HK right there would be easy tricks|pg||
nt|haans: dia 3-3 against|pg||
pc|sA|nt|iceking: if w was on heat one dummy would be J9xx AKx Ax AJxx and 5@C is easy make |pg||
nt|gautis2: but this will probably fail by 1..  so i presume 4 more imps to Finland,..  I need my coffee..brb:)|pg||
nt|haans: We have had long diskussion From Norway are Norwegian but also Norse = old version|pg||
pc|s4|nt|grebrof: unlucky |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to CK|pg||
nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|yuval10: hello|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Pekka Viitasalo|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Hi Pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Pekka|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|derric: might go down now|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But shouldn't W bid 1@s as 2-3 @s and minimum?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbgood: anyone for a double from W of 3 @c ? |pg||
nt|jjsb: if @c are ok u will just do 5@c 1@h 1@d and 2@s i guess |pg||
nt|ady: low trump lead would have been hood   there is some play now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: why @HK - ruff @S and low up better...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: you could be right, but D!Q?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sorry @dQ?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|grebrof: the finnish is using reversed carding . the 2 showing an equal number of cards in @cs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: right|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now dias|pg||
nt|ady: good|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ianmcc: no hope|pg||
nt|haans: clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|robinswr: I play equal level conversions so if partner bids diamonds, then a heart bid shows no extra values|pg||
nt|peachy: It becomes a matter of priorities, flaw in shape in a minor for TO Double in  my opinion is negligible|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that works out in some deals|pg||
nt|robinswr: last time i looked, you rather play in majors than minors|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i think N's hand had enough entries, so Q@h was interesting idea|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mmmakela: after the K|pg||
nt|haans: she was not fooled :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: can she read this?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: enda chansen|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but costly if wrong|pg||
nt|haans: duck once them KING my motto|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|muppe: ok, yes if you can read that @ds are 4-3|pg||
nt|jjsb: rigth |pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  East will not play @C - so 4 tricks to N/S anyway|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Agree Ralf, an error in the system here or a bidding misunderstanding, think it's the first one though|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I'm sure 2@d is conventional here so there was no room for it as natural|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
pc|d8|nt|grebrof: I think it is a good slam and noone would have made it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  If your prempts can be such as in this case, partner should me more cautious|pg||
nt|haans: but lucky no clubs lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good play of @H for an additional entry to hand.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: live by the sword - die by the sword....|pg||
nt|cenglund:  be|pg||
nt|haans: Final Norse: lennartj: Norseman=Viking eller nordbo|pg||
nt|haans: there is a reason why spades are played|pg||
nt|derric: now give away a @D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 hearts 1st but then must play dias|pg||
nt|haans: weak opening did cost|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer has 7 tricks even without the @d finesse - 2@c, 1@h, 1@s, 1@d, so had South played @d, it was possible that E would just play the Ace|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: oldest of them all|pg||
nt|jwit: Can't really make this hand unless he can swindle a club trick, which he just did!|pg||
nt|jwit: Might have needed to make that play before pulling second trump|pg||
nt|haans: i tend to always tell that|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|derric: conceding down 1 now i suppose|pg||
nt|derric: oh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can´t understand why a 4-card is more important to show than to bid 1@d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|iceking: 800 for 14imps |pg||
nt|nubmaster: But perhaps E will skip the @s and just go for the @ds from the start, it's teams and gamebonus looks really far away|pg||
nt|ralfwil: !½s10|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c10...|pg||
nt|yuval10: unless NS are playing 2nd/4th carding , then the K@d is marked|pg||
nt|haans: endplaying North|pg||
nt|robinswr: the 1@h overcall kept EW from finding their 8-card major suit fit|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for me t/o dbl is sacred: either all unbid suits or strong|pg||
nt|robinswr: for me all i need is support for the unbid majors|pg||
nt|jjsb: not the 5 of @d lead by the way im personally a 4th lead on a 4th suit forcing bid |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@d direct is weak with @ds but she prefered showing the @ss first and then after a possible 1@s/1NT she could've used XY-NT to 2@d|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Cost 7 imp for just a partscore|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Is there a break or something op?|pg||
nt|ady: guess hearts  needed|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: true ...(3@s there)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|runnerup: no |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gmarco24: I'm back again. sry for that|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|yuval10: now a perfect show-up squeeze for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: didn't have the guts|pg||
nt|haans: and endplay died|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jbgood: these ladies are not old - so I better use Norwegian next time:)|pg||

nt|muppe: 3/5 leads are popular in Sweden, as both pair here leads 3/5|pg||

nt|haans: nope|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: but who will double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by West take out - so now east can dbl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing negative dbl east can dbl (2-3 cards)|pg||
nt|jjsb: i guess its not a clear answer either to double or to bid 2@s just that by double u basically decide to miss the @s fit 5-3 in most cases |pg||
nt|jjsb: i personnaly bid 2@s (but not telling its correct) |pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@c is solid spot|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C will you lose three clubs tricks|pg||
nt|gmarco24: and makes if not more than 2@c tricks given|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  1 NT is not everybodyÂ´s taste|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@D was 11-16 or (11)12-13bal...so might end up too high|pg||
nt|derric: is north's hand unbal or did she upgrade to 12-13 bal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely|pg||
nt|grebrof: normally the opening would show 10-143-9hp, so I guess they will not get overboard at this table|pg||
nt|grebrof: ooops - 3-9p|pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s now|pg||
nt|haans: even thinking Grand|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S a jump voidwood?|pg||
nt|haans: safed by a prempt :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very brave 3@D:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: I had a partner who bid preemps like that . sometimes even with 5@cs and only 3@ds - I guess it is an agreement they have|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D costly -3|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2@h is insufficient|pg||
nt|friggi: we need that due to the fact that they bid like it's no tomorrow:)|pg||
nt|haans: did never count the clubs King|pg||
nt|gmarco24: J to K, or @c to J, later K@c are winning plays|pg||
nt|ady: might be a problem without a heart lead|pg||
nt|haans: ir clubs still a 9er|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 3-3  not guarantees contract if west gets lead and switches to spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|iceking: NS are one of the best women pair in europe, been pdship for man years. Icelandic pair has less experience in international events|pg||
nt|runnerup: this can be a double sving  now 2sp|pg||

nt|skaftij:  No D, no @s llead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: never liked it bec S can dbl for lead with little points|pg||
nt|haans: before 1@S nt was invite u usually had no bid|pg||

nt|ady: ok   heart lead   no problem|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psyck: cards well placed here for a few o/t's|pg||

pc|h9|nt|sharkey: Dbl = 3 @H|pg||
nt|haans: dbl = 3 spades (sipport doubles more and more popular)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South must have pons - West dbl means points and raise in other suit - East could try a dbl, not a big risk|pg||

nt|jjsb: in any case West seems to like this answer ... |pg||
pc|dT|nt|derric: wonder if 2@s is game-force or invite|pg||
nt|derric: apparantely latter|pg||
nt|zebutin: hearts are well for declarer, everything else little less so...|pg||
nt|zebutin: lead might give 1 @C trick more|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @h and @c friendly|pg||
nt|gautis2: wd Finland, and they have a great start of this game!|pg||
nt|grebrof: reversing with  a single was not the best idea from Marianne Harding it seems|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd Opinion: shogunng: think so Helle plays woidwood|pg||
nt|diaoff: Excl RKC according to CC|pg||
nt|derric: good morning here then|pg||
nt|gmarco24: woo-hoo!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: easiest a clubs finesse?|pg||
nt|diaoff: Best to play on @H I'd say|pg||
nt|haans: need a lot of thinking|pg||
nt|gmarco24: no slam?  :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact, the North hand is no so strong - the @DÂ´s doubtful values|pg||
nt|mbruun:  With no aces you should subtract 1 HCP from the hand. Good intermediates are a plus on the other side|pg||
nt|gautis2: seems like a not agreed auction in OR|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe she wanted to bid 3@h :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure splinters with only 3card support is the best, but I am not playing this event :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Denmark Sweden now are +7.|pg||
nt|grebrof: hi Juho|pg||
nt|haans: Morning or just now Good night for Denmark|pg||
nt|jwit: Depends on NT range. Don't think it is enough for dbl with only spade suit and limited values|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no double??|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: if 4@c instead, they could have possibly landed in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is still making though, so NS did well enough|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1nt-opener didnt know she actually had shown 15-17 already (at the other table)|pg||
nt|haans: may save them|pg||
nt|haans: strong spades in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Phil Clayton|pg||
nt|phil: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Phil|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hi Phil|pg||
nt|haans: Phil u came at a boring deal|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This set is getting interesting, now a question of 2 overtricks|pg||
nt|phil: then I can refill my coffee!|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: actually the most exciting out of the 1st 4|pg||
nt|haans: rite u r|pg||
nt|gmarco24: just don't touch @s and this is -3|pg||
nt|henryb:  This concedes the 9th trick, but not the tenth|pg||
nt|jjsb: u can avoid the 3@s looser i guess but not 2 as i see it and thats enough to defeat this |pg||
nt|jjsb: +1 with henry :) |pg||
nt|muppe: Both pairs play udca, low card being even and encouraging|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hawe45:  Sure - but the @D-doubleton is not so great|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, clubs depend quite much how you play them that how friendly they are...with this lead they are friendly enough|pg||
nt|mmmakela: oops|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might ruff the diamond or play safe for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K@D and @h now|pg||
nt|jwit: This could be brutal. Heart back. Three rounds of diamonds, then a fourth heart.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K@D to facilitate the counterplay (also if @D is obliged return, better use clear messages|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, discard @H on @D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gautis2: i m sure it was a "slip of the mind" ..happens to all of us :)|pg||
nt|derric: should've changed to @h:s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  running scores|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Right|pg||
nt|zebutin: and seems 3@H + 2@S + 2@C + @D make enough tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: good lead|pg||
nt|haans: play strait and fast|pg||
pc|d5|nt|zebutin: though might go after @D|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With highlights in bidding, lead and play :-)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y agree, didn't matter here|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think W was super-optimistic to believe there was a game opposite 9-11|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: Harding have no diamond|pg||
nt|mmmakela: shd play a heart|pg||
nt|derric: to make sure of contract|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|grebrof: where is the @c K?|pg||
nt|psyck: doubling & then cueing is very strong action, so I think 3@c was ok, so has more than enuf with an A & a K to go to game after that i guess|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @c9 short is a help|pg||
nt|friggi: big help|pg||
nt|friggi: @SA and more is the only hope for E-W|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes|pg||
mc|9|nt|iceking: 10 tricks for one imp gain for Denmark|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes blind spot|pg||
nt|bagman: the risk being that club ruffed, @HA and another club ruff|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Lirarna missed the game on board 3 in the open room|pg||
nt|bagman: A very low risk and typically one should not throw away an easy overtrick|pg||
nt|jjsb: AK A... but huh yes 4333 is not a must i guess maybe not "proud" of his initial pass?|pg||
nt|ady: though of course north does not know diamonds 3-3  |pg||

nt|hawe45:  Oups - good to be non-vulnerable here...|pg||
nt|mbruun:  7m for NS and a save for 1100 for EW|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess she led a @d|pg||
nt|grebrof: well played anyway - as kibz suggest - @d A was not a success|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree, S should have opened 2@C. |pg||
nt|haans: bidding it as a NT hand correct for me|pg||
nt|runnerup: luckily only 1 imp out |pg||
nt|haans: playing 1nt not much to think about|pg||
nt|haans: rare for S to have 10 diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: Lirarna got a fool 12 imp (OR)|pg||
nt|robinswr: not even a good matchpoint save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wellone|pg||

nt|jjsb: not really a surprise i still believe its not clear to avois that contract sincerely |pg||
nt|henryb:  more optimistic games?|pg||
nt|haans: tricky for West|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  When East bids @S - E/W will buy the contract for sure - I hope...|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C = 11-16 anything|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  West will not believe her eyes when partner bids 3 Sp|pg||
nt|grebrof: good afternoon Christer|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Good morning everybody|pg||
nt|grebrof: I am reporting from Thailand and we are 5 hours ahead of Norway - 4 hours ahead of Finaland|pg||
nt|grebrof: can be 15-177bal|pg||
nt|sharkey: East attempting to interfer|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H would have been natural but 8-11|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps W will just bid 3 NT|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With the favourable lie, 10 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now finally NS can make game in  S's|pg||
nt|haans: nothing here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Not likely to be bid|pg||
nt|ianmcc: North's fast raise to 2@s helped get there|pg||
nt|friggi: in the other room they bidded the gran slamp and made it 7@H....|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the Dealing Gods are on song - another slam|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h needs the @sA onside and little else|pg||
nt|haans: 12-15 dia or any M|pg||
nt|haans: ok natural|pg||
nt|ady: looks onlu a part score for n/s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  6 @S is the right bid from West now|pg||
nt|mbruun:  6 Sp right away to apply pressure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We could play together, Mathisa|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Im a little concerned that I agree with you, about the bidding I mean |pg||
nt|ianmcc: close to a slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S and 5@D are ON with KJ@S in finesse|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt = 4@H and 5+ in a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @S would have been a better bid than 5!|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Very difficult for NS to get to the grand. I predict EW will buy it in 6 S X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But this might work - and West will not "sell out"|pg||
nt|zebutin: more or less clear 4@H... but if they feel bold they might even shoot for 6@H...|pg||
nt|zebutin: which isnt the best contract, but i have been in worse...|pg||
nt|bagman: not so rare for S to have xxx xxxx AKxxxx -|pg||
nt|haans: Stenberg|pg||
nt|bjurn:  @S game here, 6@S is so-so|pg||
nt|haans: a very rare bid nowdays|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H by west probably fix @S|pg||
nt|robinswr: switch the black kings and 4@s goes down|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|psyck: tuf to get to game even after drury|pg||
nt|haans: 11-16 in quicker|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 NT focing app|pg||
nt|jbgood: forcing even|pg||
nt|haans: Yes she think so but ...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good jamming bid|pg||
nt|muppe: NS play 13-15 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  - not if South bids 7 @C now, Mathias...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: must be odds-on|pg||
nt|iceking: another drury hand|pg||
nt|psyck: S likes hand better after opps bid @s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in the contrary, most intriguing contract to play and defend very often|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@C minimum|pg||
nt|haans: often min|pg||
nt|haans: most be natural 2nt :(|pg||
nt|peachy: S decided to show his spades, in a 5-card major system I prefer 2H, hand is not strong enough to try for anything|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i guess it will be another partial|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C rebid  transfer to diamonds?|pg||
nt|haans: if 2@C gazzilli A have a problem|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mbruun:  Impressive|pg||
nt|mbruun:  West knows 7 Sp is good insurance, but always difficult to save in a hot aucton like this. She should do it right I think  |pg||
nt|zebutin: 3@S most likely splinter of some sort, Pia might like her hand now because only Axxx in @S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: trump 2 @s and lose a diaamond|pg||
nt|haans: dont like that 2NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: EW getting very exited here :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: hmm, some play something like that or 13-17 in carrot club still...havent seen that working too well... :)|pg||
nt|haans: Multi was biggest at the 80th but still on in Scandinavia|pg||
nt|jjsb: wow ... what is the nt range?|pg||
nt|jjsb: oh ok |pg||
nt|haans: S have a problem|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mbruun:  Well done all around|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From Wests point of view, 7 @S might cost about 500 only - with more @C by East|pg||
nt|gautis2: good result for Norway OR. .. seems hard with heart lead?|pg||
nt|zebutin: sorry, private|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anybody overcall 1 NT with East hand?|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H big accident|pg||
nt|mmmakela: u all bid 2 dias as W? |pg||
nt|phil: or they have the choice of getting a nice number from 3@d|pg||
nt|haans: interesting deal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: it worked|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C to make them bid once more|pg||
mb|3D|nt|grebrof: in the open room, thhe norwegian 1nt opening showing (8)9-12hp|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: in MP yes IMP no|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C min better than normal Jacoby|pg||
nt|haans: transfer taken serious|pg||
nt|gmarco24: surprise|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: Gib says it makes..I have to get MORE coffee:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: their cc says multilandy, so i guess 2 NT asked for the minor..|pg||
nt|haans: blood|pg||
nt|rnmalik: pass and trouble:)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@D game try, or slam try here|pg||
nt|haans: singel or asking for singel|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Norths 9's and 10's in major really pull their weight|pg||
nt|haans: more interesting|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 1@c-16+|pg||
nt|muppe: That explains S's pass.|pg||
nt|jjsb: so we know they will not play game :) |pg||
nt|henryb:  North does not X 2@s?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I presume X of 2@h showed @h and high card values|pg||
nt|jjsb: 2@d some kind of multi?|pg||
nt|haans: they have 110 or 140 so good MP|pg||
nt|gmarco24: many would bid 3@h over 3@c with singleton @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: pessimistic|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@H very agressive and will catch perfect dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: that made S's choice easier, esp with vul game at stake|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Mikael G told me that the operator is new and are in training so we will have some allowance here... and she has no time to comment|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Heart lead is the killer|pg||
nt|grebrof: the small cards in dummy makes it easier to overtake the Q too, cause there are many layout where N will have a @h-suit good enough for it to run later|pg||
nt|gautis2: as I can see, I am agree..|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, but S should have though little more about it|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No RD, please, that would loose 2 IMPÂ´s to 2140|pg||
nt|zebutin: well trumps cant be too badly, and with diamond lead neither can any other suits either so has enough entries&etc|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Sry, not Mikael, it was his dad, Johan who told me :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 3@H I think|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@S needs heart K onside and hearts 3-3, 4-2 or J singleton; it is clearly under 50% and thus should not be bid|pg||
nt|bagman: In case NS need desperately a swing the slam would be good :)|pg||
nt|haans: cue mandatory to show cue below game|pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @D lead more aggressive and effective|pg||
nt|skaftij:   800|pg||
nt|robinswr: i agree. support partner asap is my motto|pg||
nt|muppe: Yes|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d presumably showed 1 major|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  One @H-trick might "disappear" here|pg||
nt|haans: in a good day acceptable|pg||
nt|skaftij:  500|pg||
nt|haans: blood from nowhere|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: not @DA or @HK|pg||
nt|bjurn:  42%-ish, vul, might be an options but it's too early in the match IMO|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just overtricks|pg||
nt|haans: Operatoer was 2@C transfer?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|derric: trumps 4-1 and @c:s 4-2?|pg||
nt|grebrof: my style is 1@d last hand too - if P cant answer 1@d, you rarely have any game|pg||
nt|haans: jack lead?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: can't go wrong here on any line|pg||
nt|muppe: North is thinkin that 2NT was lebensohl?|pg||
nt|henryb:  what a mixup!|pg||
nt|jjsb: oooppsss a discusion after the game so... |pg||
nt|jjsb: or we do have a fun operator? |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yuval10: the (persumably ) weak NT in the OR made many problems to the Swede pair|pg||
nt|haans: yes yout style is my style 2 but not with @CK singel|pg||
nt|robinswr: partner will not know that you have three hearts if the auction goes 1@h 1@s 2@d 2@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club by declarer now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: maybe he thought he was a fraction too good for 2 @H|pg||
nt|robinswr:   I wrote an article on that subject http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202008-02.aspx|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bagman: AKQxxx Jx xxx xx would make the slam better|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|phil: 500 looks likely as long as the defense doesnt stub their toe|pg||
nt|friggi: did not finnes!?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: as long as he takes this|pg||
nt|henryb:  Grahs must be thinking Christmas comes in June|pg||
nt|jjsb: that is not a good result for NS............ scary one ...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gmarco24: even ducking twice would squeeze W pretty much in three suits, so one discard of @h will follow|pg||
pc|d4|nt|zebutin: something like that most likely is enough|pg||
nt|derric: the @HJT help a lot|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-shift is important - otherwise only 800|pg||

pc|hA|nt|jbgood: Norway went down in 6 @d in OR|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mbruun:  North will have to cash AK now otherwise she will be endplayed|pg||
nt|bagman: When E wins the @HK the auction tells that he must switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|bagman: w|pg||
nt|bjurn:  unless E decides to lead @H|pg||
nt|bagman: Easts spade trick cannot run away but a diamond trick can|pg||
nt|haans: E do have a natural lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|grebrof: well played so far|pg||
nt|bjurn:  N's failure to cuebid @Ds might encourage him to lead @DA|pg||
nt|bagman: E has an easy @CQ lead; N might win a spade and immediately take the heart finesse with @HQ|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|vugraphzdq: now the director is here again to discuss the last case|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s lead with @h K in return would have been better I guess (if declarer lets the @s win)|pg||
nt|gautis2: yepp ..that s true christer|pg||
nt|gautis2: I bet XX u would not return @h K after spade lead from partner Espen:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: it isnt that long ago that a match between Norway and Italy had directors flying around all the time (understandably in some cases) - but I guess gautis know more about these when ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: it comes to "grumpiness" :)|pg||
nt|haans: pen double of 1nt?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Nothing exciting it seems, more coffee|pg||
nt|fabsayc: somehow we missed some relevant issues :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Steve Robinson|pg||
nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|ady: not much on here|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt and Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: good 4@s|pg||
nt|zebutin: Erkkilä&Ahonen have 4@S, but they must bid it first|pg||
nt|ianmcc: should be flat|pg||
nt|runnerup: no way to get imps in these |pg||
nt|haans: no action|pg||
nt|bjurn:  so, out of the five first deals 4@S has been a make 5 times :)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  making this is a ground breaking deal |pg||
nt|ady: hi all     sorry    late arriving|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: lucky 4@s here on EW|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@s?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  A sporty 3 NT N/S here|pg||
nt|zebutin: double or overcall?|pg||
nt|derric: overcall for me|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe a simple 4@h p/c by W now|pg||
nt|nubmaster: We'll propably se some action here|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In Open EW made a wrong decision to sacrifice vs 5@h but didn't get it doubled which is really difficult|pg||
nt|haans: 1NTx ido not give game score|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Pass: 0-7/17+|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi david|pg||
nt|robinswr: makes it difficult for north|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and welcome back to Fredrik Alfredsson|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Undo|pg||
nt|yuval10: hmmm i think we miss a pass here|pg||
nt|haans: rare overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: i must confess i would have just bid 1@S...|pg||
nt|zebutin: even though hand is good|pg||
nt|bagman: E's 2nd pass confirming 0-7 :)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  1@D neb 11-13 NT or @Ds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now we all agree 4c oc?|pg||
nt|ady: hi Raijja|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: east went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is ok is suppose, but not consistent with what we saw before|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so dbl w min values?|pg||
nt|affe82:  thx! hi all|pg||
mb|d|nt|cenglund:  Not so far-fetched play given the bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: I frequently played 1nt XX when playing weak nts|pg||
nt|phil: can't imagining passing the East hand|pg||
nt|phil: (imagine)|pg||
nt|haans: Törnqvist had no opening :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Really?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: not so good methods here for ew. |pg||
nt|haans: right, double in my book not hearts|pg||
nt|ianmcc: West loved that opening|pg||
nt|friggi: no problem now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: claim 10|pg||
nt|gmarco24: once you are in 3nt this board is getting uninteresting :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@s makes north guess and with a club lead he guessed wrong|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|iceking: for sure W should decl with his holding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 4@c from W = bid your suit under, and contract on the strong hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, some play 4@c |pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead needed I think|pg||
nt|haans: big think No opening|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I'd open without the @c jack|pg||
nt|gmarco24: uninteresting  |pg||
nt|robinswr: i like to lead aces against slams|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  If West finds the killing lead, they will call the police|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Will make in practice|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 1@s could be passed out (but I agree)|pg||
nt|derric: partner is likely to raise on any 3+ support|pg||
nt|iceking: ofcourse that would be more normal |pg||
nt|iceking: with everything breaking nicely this should make |pg||
nt|gautis2: this seems like a flat boars..  this time I almost bet I m right:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2 last hands are rather routine|pg||
nt|haans: 1NTx pquite playable|pg||
nt|jjsb: note that when this happen u are not suppose to discuss with partner .. its nto the moment .. u can go to toilet to put some fresh water on face sure but definitely not the moment ...|pg||
nt|jjsb: to discus |pg||
nt|gmarco24: 3nt depends on @s finesse|pg||
nt|gmarco24: an it's in|pg||
mb|3D|nt|diaoff: Another of those easy 4@S|pg||
nt|grebrof: it often is|pg||
nt|jjsb: and therefore to criticize on any way|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d again looks like a good contract|pg||
nt|jjsb: a lot of board to be played |pg||
nt|jjsb: + u dont know what happen other table ...|pg||
nt|muppe: i think u agree how you play the situation the rest of match and then you move on.|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: its the same contract again - so, I would go for a norwegian 1IMP reward :D|pg||
nt|haans: EW 3@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no is a matter of combining 4 card overcalls with major oriented doubles|pg||
nt|friggi: -1|pg||
nt|ianmcc: must fail - South won't fail to make @cA|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|haans: and hearts 4-3|pg||
nt|affe82:  a good bid. hard to get the msg across otherwise. a bit unlucky.|pg||
nt|affe82:  might he consider another cashing black ace?|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe 5@H would have bid a better bid|pg||
nt|robinswr: shows a stronger hand than 4@h|pg||
nt|robinswr: asks partner to make the last mistake|pg||
nt|affe82:  sure. or 4@s and then 5@h|pg||
nt|affe82:  but not sure that they will have time to negotiate the best level and it will help the one on lead|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@s makes the opponents guess. I know on bad days you go for 800|pg||
nt|robinswr: if the vul was reversed, you'd bid 4@s|pg||
nt|affe82:  another view is that 6@h might miss a cold grand. just turn the black queens into the ace of @c|pg||
nt|haans: By 2@S overcall BOOK win the board|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: still time to switch|pg||
nt|bagman: E makes his normal lead and down goes the contract|pg||
nt|bagman: S now wishing that he had autosplinter 3 @S in the system|pg||
nt|bjurn:  E led his longest and strongest, good enough :)|pg||
nt|bagman: And North too|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@d horrible at these colours|pg||
nt|haans: often used in sweden Asptro|pg||
nt|skaftij:  with passed PD|pg||
nt|mmmakela: lead dir is very important in teams also so once the chance.....|pg||
nt|ady: south double some risk   north could not double for penalties in that position  so south balancing with shortish spades|pg||
nt|haans: and many use N double as take-out|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  easily 500 |pg||
nt|haans: looks more like Astro|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: though some pass all 7-counts opposite overcall|pg||

nt|friggi: anything else is poker:)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: agree - discards no use to East hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: mostly matter of partnership agreements and individual bidding style|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mbruun:  With 9 HCP partner is weak, so heart is more natural in teams. Partner cant have a strong spade holding|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: all would have passed 2@Sx at MP|pg||
nt|ady: yes    I am not in favour   some times partner is alould to have a poor hand  amd this  sort of re-opening can  be expensive|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck:  will play @h 1st & can fin @s into safe hand later if reqd|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h is automatic in trick 2 in order to take out a possible entry to E's hand|pg||
nt|diaoff: Norway will need some other kind of boards now|pg||
nt|haans: Denmark have taken 16*2 IMP|pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl has to lead something everytime endplayed - not always good to dbl with bal hand and no suit to really attack with|pg||
nt|mmmakela: how can that be right?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean club shift?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont know|pg||
nt|robinswr: looking at the doubleton diamonds, seems a trump shift is called for|pg||
pc|s6|nt|nubmaster: continue with ace of @c now for a push?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Looks like declarer is cold. with a @s lead, could get two pitches. |pg||

pc|d9|nt|cenglund:  Still down|pg||

nt|grebrof: well, normally (lately after Sweden was superior), the tendency has been that it is close encounters these nordic chamionships|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d4|nt|zebutin: maybe they play 2@S as constructive and 3@S as weaker variant...|pg||

nt|bjurn:  this wont be a push|pg||
nt|jwit: 3NT NS.  Not that easy to bid|pg||
nt|ady: best game for e/w 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: it was a short break, but now everyone is back from bathroom etc|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so what to do over 1@H opener|pg||
nt|gmarco24: we are all waiting that slams to see!|pg||
nt|gmarco24: who's been shuffling these boards??  :)|pg||
nt|haans: or a good double for 800|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so we need a good overbid first?|pg||
nt|affe82:  and the non-exploring way proved its worth|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: sometimes running your winners will squeese your opponents - can be a good strategy even if you dont have enough tricks to begin with too|pg||
nt|sharkey: N shud hardly have Ax in @C as wud overtake and return 1. trick|pg||
mb|1C|nt|haans: 1@S 17+|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D|pg||
nt|haans: hard fight here|pg||
nt|haans: Opening weaker and weaker (aceless hand 11 hcp)|pg||
nt|haans: openers have gone down for 50 years|pg||
nt|haans: easy 3nt|pg||
nt|jwit: 20 opposite 4|pg||
nt|haans: people neber pass|pg||
nt|henryb:  not quite enough to make slam on a heart lead, but cold on anything else|pg||
nt|muppe: NS makes 6@s without @h lead|pg||
nt|muppe: 1NT= 13-15|pg||
nt|gmarco24: or, it's better to say bad overbid|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT as the lay    but unlikely to play there|pg||
mb|3H|nt|diaoff: Potential for some action, yes|pg||
nt|haans: not all just overcall|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and bad game|pg||
nt|affe82:  it's a guess for Aldeborg but it sure hurts, even worse when the lead was the correct one|pg||
nt|haans: easy 3nt :)|pg||
mb|d!|nt|zebutin: what to bid on Johanssons 2@H ?|pg||
nt|gautis2: 500 is a good score.. 4@h seems like few loosers, but not enough winners?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can they bid the slam?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 0-7|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 3@S with good guess in trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless EW score a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|bjurn:  I must confess that I would've opened souths hand as well, at least in a strong club system|pg||
nt|haans: most can take a beating withouy being punch-drunk or they would not play Swedish Teams|pg||
nt|henryb:  be tough to find a heart from W hand|pg||
nt|ady: may get to 5@D  which shoudl fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: EW have good play for 4@S.|pg||
nt|ady: club lead   though may mean defeat    2 ruffs A@D   ace of trumps|pg||
nt|robinswr: i don't like doubling with a singleton spade|pg||
nt|robinswr: he played north to bid a slam off three aces|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ianmcc: 3@d|pg||
nt|iceking: should have no problems stop in 4@H here|pg||
nt|psyck: 5 level is safe too i guess|pg||
nt|iceking: would be good to have 3@H forcing here |pg||
nt|nubmaster: If 2NT shows the red suits why not start with 4@h and then 5@d? But N took it for the minors because of the fact that the 1@c opening is 2+?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3-3 to paly here|pg||
nt|haans: Big Clubs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a quiet 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I guess without the @s lead, you can possibly make some @d-tricks, but|pg||
nt|haans: system works well here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - think they'll bid slam|pg||
nt|haans: but Blackwwod a problem = 2 keys missing|pg||
nt|haans: urp|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes|pg||
nt|jwit: agree|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now maybe 1nt-3nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok S taking slow road|pg||
nt|affe82:  might be NS can gather some momentum if E thinks to much about chances gone by|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: 4@S not doubled Optimal contract|pg||
nt|diaoff: Expected a Dbl there, yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: must start on @d at once to win this - and use @d to pull S's 4th trump - very difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: lucky that N has all the aces|pg||
nt|jbgood: club ace with S and the contract would stand no chance on best def|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well this one at least looks like an opening(almost?)|pg||
nt|haans: all you can say is URKKK|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@C game try in spades with 4@Ss|pg||
nt|haans: yes most of us would|pg||
nt|bagman: W likely to lead @CQ or a low heart|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not so easy call 3N|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
nt|phil: believe your pard or believe your opps? |pg||
nt|haans: what rare choices|pg||
nt|skaftij:  not the ideal hand by North to bid 4 card M|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont like overcalling with 21 count|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@s shows this hand over a takeout double|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 17+|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, no fun a all|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 1@d=12-13 bal or... or...|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: and that is logical if bypass @D with marginal canape hands|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h will now be frcd after 4th suit bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but 4@d will also do and after 4@h = no @s control|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Forcing?|pg||
nt|gautis2: this play will take sometime..belive me:)|pg||
nt|derric: 2@d = Gf 5+@d4M|pg||

nt|bjurn:  :)|pg||
nt|haans: good lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 NT who wd pass as E not holding 6|pg||
nt|phil: I love my hand for 1@h x'd - doubleton trump and some working cards|pg||
nt|robinswr: x/AKQxxxxx/KJx/xx is not a slam bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Denmark gained 7 IMP on board 5, because South unblocked her AK of hearts in due time, so 7 Sp X was five off|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a happy spot|pg||
nt|zebutin: well no double... seems like 2 down or something|pg||
nt|grebrof: I assume the 5 from E|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they play count when Q is at the table|pg||
nt|gautis2: not best lead.. may make now|pg||

nt|haans: nope harder to pass 2nt|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club did cost here|pg||
nt|phil: why should 1N be any better? |pg||
nt|phil: or 2@c? |pg||
nt|mmmakela: more club tricks|pg||
nt|haans: Markku have a point :)|pg||
nt|phil: I dont remember my partner showing clubs with a 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|phil: but maybe its part of a system :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Because your @d Queen will not be ruffed and you have delivered your hand|pg||
nt|haans: they do not present best bridge ever :)|pg||
nt|jjsb: practical bid ... not quite sure i like it though(not saying u should not go to slam) |pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Not at all an unexpected result|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt-3nt (natural)|pg||
nt|affe82:  got a point there|pg||
nt|affe82:  a solid one|pg||
nt|haans: anything but 3nt down|pg||
nt|ady: got to 4-3 spade fit    but bad split should put paid to that|pg||
nt|haans: We have a second opinion: runnerup: 5d makes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|iceking: so 3@H and now S will deny @S control so should end in 4@H|pg||
nt|iceking: Danish que-bidding style is though little odd at least i have never understood it|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S shows interest in slam perhaps N shud be able to bid it based on @H length and max|pg||
nt|grebrof: Magic Diamond comes from Sweden originally, but many play it in  Finland too - they are more artificial in Sweden-Finland than we are in Norway-Denmark - I have myself sat down ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: that 1@c meant either a) 5-11hp any suit or b) 17hp+ any distribution - conventions like that are not allowed in Norway, but it is fun, isnt it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: East are at the bathroom|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The play of the Finnish ladies has been mildly put rather sloppy|pg||
nt|haans: i do assume they would not bid 1@H with A+K|pg||
nt|grebrof: when do you get to go, Johanna?|pg||
nt|haans: 52% slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be S or N shud have made more efforts here....|pg||
pc|h9|nt|iceking: undo|pg||
nt|gautis2: ..but a fair normal lead|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Spade must be attacked otherwise diamonds will be established|pg||
nt|grebrof: curiousity is always there with AK in a suit|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt played by East please|pg||
nt|bagman: Hopes to score a ruff and two spades :9|pg||
nt|jwit: Even without big club, not clear to bid with South hand opposite a 2NT opener.  4-4 in majors might sway South to bid, but still far from clear cut.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psyck: we see what you mean Magnus :)|pg||
nt|iceking: so 3@S could maybe ask for @S control |pg||
nt|iceking: Danish asking bid i think they call it|pg||
nt|gautis2: God have given u an ace for one reason...take it!|pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: that card was meant for entry to dummy...|pg||
nt|diaoff: Needed that entry I'm afraid|pg||
nt|haans: ok Stayman first|pg||
nt|robinswr: he could have overcalled 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: 11 tricks |pg||
nt|jjsb: just saying we migth not want theoraclly to play it with 2 immediate loosers in @h maybe ?|pg||
nt|affe82:  what happened here?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|haans: can not make Blackwood|pg||
nt|diaoff: You're faster :), but now it makes again|pg||
nt|jbgood: ok - no duck and no dinner:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: but it aint over yet|pg||
nt|haans: ok goes this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Johan Wahlberg|pg||
nt|wahlis:  Hi|pg||
nt|friggi: hi|pg||
nt|ady: we can make 5@D from here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mbruun:  Difficult lead for West, and DK is natural but unfortunate|pg||
nt|iceking: dont try this at home folks :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: never , I can't leave my chair :)|pg||
nt|derric: maybe if S was gonna open, try 1NT|pg||
nt|haans: low @D = lavinthal for clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: S was unlikely to guess the trumps anyhow but the ruff makes sure of beating this|pg||
nt|gmarco24: communication play in @s. risking stiff Q@s offside, winning fourth Q@s inside|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cenglund:  This is capitulation|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I would be proud of my cards as dummy sitting South|pg||
nt|phil: yes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ianmcc: this looking a bit better|pg||
nt|gmarco24: welcome Johan|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi Johan|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no swings this set|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 7@c is entry creating maneuver|pg||
nt|henryb:  A couple of kibitzers asked whether E should double 2@h; X of 2@h should suggest values as well as @h: invitation for partner to contest the partial|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks and next....|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like ew 1nt without this mini opening so some imps |pg||
pc|c4|nt|mbruun:  Nice layout for declarer|pg||
nt|muppe: I think the double of 2@h was out of question without values.|pg||
nt|ady: might make 4@S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: and 13 tricks - next|pg||
nt|iceking: ok 3@S was here some slam potential without shortness|pg||
nt|grebrof: hard to see any reason for the trumpshift|pg||
nt|ady: bidding a little odd    first content with 2@C 2nd time around  non forcing  and when parttners shows a weak hand with long spades gets bettwer and goes to 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense interesting, south has to win second club, cash spade ace and exit in clubs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|iceking: so in a way they didnt know @S quebid was on or missing |pg||
nt|haans: 2Queens + 10 10 10|pg||
nt|mmmakela: IF E PASSES 1 @H D(and seems sane) I would never pass but bid 1 NT|pg||
nt|friggi: take @SK to hold them down to 10|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Even spade shift may not be enough to set the contact|pg||
nt|haans: i dont understand his pass|pg||
nt|robinswr: if my partner made a t/o double i would insist on playing in spades with the east hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gautis2: as long @h K stiff, I think this was home after lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s-shift - and then?|pg||
nt|gautis2: dia|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok, bang down @h A and small @c later from W|pg||
nt|grebrof: or another @s|pg||
nt|gautis2: cant get another @s from W...just borned with one :)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Trump lead might help|pg||
nt|gautis2: that s true|pg||
nt|runnerup: finnish ladys found a better fit 4-3 |pg||
nt|jwit: 2 queens not nearly as good as an ace.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|grebrof: yes, but small @c AND a new @s is a monster - maybe|pg||
nt|ady: what did you want west to do after south opening?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: agree |pg||
nt|robinswr: i would probably have overcalled 2@c|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ianmcc: It will make soon|pg||
nt|haans: agree to that|pg||
nt|jwit: 4-4 in majors might make it worthwhile to try Stayman|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: now it is|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still not enough to win the board...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can't go wrong such is the placement of cards.|pg||
nt|phil: North's? |pg||
nt|robinswr: this is one bidding system that i have never seen|pg||
nt|affe82:  me neither|pg||
nt|haans: few entries to dummy|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h8|nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: bit Q + 10?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i'm not sure EW can bring this one to only +1 after @h lead|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't understand NORTHS pass|pg||
nt|affe82:  is 1@d supposed to be alerted in some fashion?|pg||
nt|ady: yes    problem|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|ianmcc: should have taken one pitch|pg||
nt|derric: back to down 2 if win this and a trump|pg||
nt|ralfwil:  no 12|pg||
nt|grebrof: trump lead might be the killer, yes|pg||
nt|haans: utp again|pg||
nt|jbgood: big numbers all over the place|pg||
nt|jbgood: 990 OR|pg||
nt|skaftij:  second chance to bid 1NT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|derric: or trump after @HJ|pg||
nt|zebutin: or is it even 3 down now|pg||
nt|derric: correct|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 300|pg||
nt|jwit: Better play it better in 3 lol|pg||
nt|haans: one reason to bid after 2nt is that 2nt may be down as well |pg||
nt|jwit: 20 opposite 4 generally doesn't play anywhere near as well as 12 opposite 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree|pg||
nt|haans: again u are rite|pg||
nt|ady: down 1|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jbgood: making here and 9 imps away...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S Ace please.|pg||
nt|derric: lucky since in both rooms south could equally well hold 2-5-2-4|pg||
nt|haans: and endplay|pg||
pc|c2|nt|phil: I think 1@h created the issues; not the pass later|pg||
nt|haans: I do not understand South first pass|pg||
nt|skaftij:  big risk being caught|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west made a good play, countering my defense|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|zebutin: other room got to stop in 2@D just made, so nice pick up for finns|pg||
nt|zebutin: if doesnt play 3 round spades, might be even more down|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @H back and @H through|pg||
nt|derric: possibility of -4 after this pause for thought|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: open layout leads to 3nt making here|pg||
mc|9|nt|runnerup: east missed to take her d ace|pg||
nt|affe82:  ok so i am told that 1@d shows 12-16 with a 5- suit in @d/@h/@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What is this system called?|pg||

nt|grebrof: I bet against you :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: North had a 6 card fit which she hadnt shown|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The 6th heart is valuable|pg||
nt|yuval10: finally an interesting one|pg||
nt|diaoff: Its a tough game...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this one looks dangerous|pg||
nt|bjurn:  a chance for Lirarna to earn some overtrick IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: Here NS can make 460 in notrumps to score 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|skaftij:  blood blood ahhh|pg||
nt|mmmakela: agree but if pd decided to do so , bidding tells u shd bid 1 NT|pg||
nt|friggi: when he ha full control|pg||
nt|muppe: It shouls show values as the hand coul easily be yours (their 1NT openig was 13-15)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: who said we will see a game here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Yes  - but after a slow start|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This looks like a coffee-board for 420 N/S|pg||
nt|mbruun:  4 Sp seems to be the spot, and its a very natural contract|pg||
nt|psyck: they have to be careful not to get too high here with cards unfav|pg||
nt|haans: but is no ace|pg||
nt|gmarco24: agree Fridrik|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|haans: prefer 3nt to 5@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  It should show values whatever the 1N range|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|zebutin: 2@D most likely multi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks with open cards|pg||
nt|iceking: slam makes |pg||
nt|haans: not more than 3@S|pg||
nt|haans: 1NT-3NT?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sorry misspeek|pg||
nt|bjurn:  South wont be able to find @HK with North|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT is clearly better than 5m as there are 9+ top tricks and nobody can ruff any of the winners|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/AdeborgKarlsson.pdf|pg||
nt|affe82:  it's some sort of precision|pg||
nt|affe82:  which allows systematic 9-12 openings|pg||
nt|haans: that was a weeeeeeeeeeek opening|pg||
nt|ady: part score again|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|nubmaster: In open the Icelandic ended up in 5@d|pg||
nt|ianmcc: another partial|pg||
mb|3H|nt|zebutin: Johansson has many quick tricks in hand, so didnt want to bid lame 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: or east could maybe dbl 3@D here |pg||
nt|jbgood: Norway had a bye last round - seems like they have problems adjusting to playing again...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what a hand, a nightmare:)|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S a make|pg||
nt|bagman: As the auction tempoed, 3NT is nearly impossible to reach|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also if 2@H isn't forcing north will raise with KQx and a sgl out|pg||
nt|haans: NS bid minors reverse|pg||
nt|ady: e/w already way overboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 3@D looks alot down 5-6 down|pg||
nt|derric: would you bid the south hand?|pg||
nt|haans: good question what does Pass show now|pg||
nt|haans: 6@C+1@S+1@S+1@H?|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes h lead lets this home|pg||
nt|mmmakela: spade J lead anyone?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D|pg||
nt|ady: west got a good result    looking at the 2 hands 3NT does not look so good|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ?+??|pg||
nt|henryb:  Maybe not against a Roman 1N (17-19)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  North will raise to three, and a well placed DK will make South go to game|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Ah, started to write that before it showed up on the screen, sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have 12 top tricks and it looks possible that you can squeeze your way to the 13th|pg||
nt|psyck:  could there be 13 tricks here with W squeezed in majors?|pg||
nt|haans: How many knows that?|pg||
nt|haans: OR bid 5@C alone|pg||
nt|bjurn:  South might try 4@S now|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@S makes 450?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I expect 1@h to be best spot and even make, if you overcall with 4M, you should have a second bid, ususally 5 card minor|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H alerted|pg||
nt|mmmakela: looking  better|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 5@c is ok here|pg||
nt|haans: not fun to double|pg||
nt|ady: apart for the 3 spade losers  cards lay badly for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: n/s though not in a position to take a penalty|pg||
nt|haans: better not to open 1@D|pg||
mb|4H|nt|grebrof: 1@c +15hp|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1@s balanced +9 or 4441|pg||
nt|haans: of you lead @SJ = call TD|pg||
nt|derric: now @S towards K and pray|pg||
nt|ianmcc: with overtricks|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: the quesstion remains, will W bid 5|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S not alerted?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 3@s is presumably preempting|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 8-11 ? really?|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S the winner|pg||
nt|runnerup: same in other room -bidding and lead|pg||
nt|haans: assume three spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/BGTom.pdf  for N-S|pg||
nt|affe82:  anyhow it seems to me 3@d was intended as forcing|pg||
nt|ady: now n/s will get too high|pg||
nt|ady: probably end in 4-3 spade fit|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gautis2: did we get the result  of board 2 Johanna?  |pg||
nt|cenglund:  This a better slam than the previous one|pg||
nt|ady: winning lead impossible to find|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this scores better|pg||
nt|gmarco24: what was 2@s Hans?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, so he needs two ruff @s to set up for @d discard. that's the plan for making this|pg||
nt|haans: assume Gazzilli cariation (or Häxan as many say in sweden)|pg||
nt|robinswr: draw trumps and lose three tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: some prospects|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room they got to open 1@H telling 4+ @H and 8-11...and after that sailed to 3nt|pg||
nt|derric: 3NT went down after declarer broke entries in open|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Cards are not lying in favour of making 6NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: I would XX ;)|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead and down|pg||
nt|friggi: 3 down is ok|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S 5 spade + clubs|pg||
mb|6C|nt|zebutin: this lead destroys one entry to @C suit, but give ruffing finese in @S suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: became a winner - 500 was available|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes, you have the values, showing a hand worth 18-19.|pg||
nt|haans: Asplund had cards for double of 2@D|pg||
nt|bagman: There's little in the play as declarer drives out the @SA and then cashes his top trumps and scores 420 or 450 depending on the spade break|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @H lead in this auction is ortodoxe|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: and they figure it out, so a  stop...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finnish ladies avoided the tempation|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I think the director chosed to let it be (4heartsx-2), but I'm not shore!|pg||
nt|grebrof: not that I can see EW doing something viable over 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may have bid 4@S with West hand - but 5332 distribution is a negative|pg||
nt|santyclz: 29 hcp so it may not be automatic to get there.|pg||
nt|ady: what is 4NT?|pg||
nt|haans: 4n by N fair|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: no stayman....need some points from pd.....heart lead might give it away...... so not impossible.....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is no winning lead|pg||
nt|ady: in fact no winning lead as they lay|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I don't like that 1@s too wide a range if you can go down to 5 HCP and soft at that|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: so if takes that, she is losing 2@D + @H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Maybe 4@s here|pg||
nt|gautis2: ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: I wouldnt change that board 2 either|pg||
nt|grebrof: but ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: not the best lead here|pg||
nt|grebrof: if there is any|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ady: not fancied|pg||
nt|haans: do you really want to know? :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nubmaster: good bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep, surely not 7... 6 will probably be good enough|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|ianmcc: it removes a useful entry|pg||
nt|psyck: stopping low with a key card missing & the 3@d x|pg||
nt|haans: rersponder tend to make transfers all the time|pg||
nt|haans: must play spade now|pg||
nt|haans: no futher delay|pg||
nt|phil: he can make a lot of tricks on this layout|pg||
nt|gmarco24: or, he might try to set up @h |pg||
nt|haans: might or must :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont really understand why east didnt dbl 3@D|pg||
nt|iceking: east should know dummy in 3@D dbl will hold most often 0-1@D and very few hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this might be a chance for the Swedes in the OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly left the door open.|pg||
nt|haans: so she may not have understood the Pass|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true, xx @S was acceptable to P.|pg||
nt|haans: not fun but must|pg||
nt|mmmakela: is it clear it's the best play?|pg||
nt|runnerup: no but only change |pg||

nt|psyck:  as usual, minor slams with borderline values tuf to get to|pg||

nt|mbruun:  I think this was misscored|pg||
nt|hawe45:  miss-score for the ladies|pg||
nt|iceking: slam made in open room so 11 imps to Denmark|pg||
nt|grebrof: a club lead here is a disaster, but 5@d is safe|pg||
nt|grebrof: or, is it...|pg||
nt|haans: i would not have opened 1@H = no opening only 8-11 hcp|pg||
nt|sharkey: on Bd 22 4@S also made in OR - quite surprising...|pg||
nt|haans: mayor error in diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h was 8-11 and prob 3 card support - so 5@h was not to be recommended - trumps might easily have been 4-1 |pg||
nt|jbgood: and even 4@h might have been in trouble|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in open room 4@H made with a squeeze against east|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: east went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|haans: direct 4@H i think|pg||
nt|phil: yes 4@h looks likely, but North may have an opinion about that|pg||
nt|mmmakela: to reconsider his heart opening level?|pg||
nt|phil: with a slower auction anyway|pg||
nt|henryb:  South tried to put declarer in dummy to take a second @s finesse, but declarer was having no part of that|pg||
nt|haans: np :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: sorry for that boars!|pg||
nt|ady: another nearly split deck|pg||
mb|1C|nt|cenglund:  It's not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: interesting play by declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: @s overcall?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: undo|pg||
nt|gautis2: this seems like a hughe result in OR|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - if you have a fit, its a lot more than just 11hp|pg||
nt|haans: now 1@S is right|pg||
nt|sharkey: lots of voids in these hands - who's been dealing?|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt going down down down|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H no make|pg||
nt|haans: double better tyhan 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|bjurn:  in the OR North opened 2@S (6+@S, 10-13) giving EW less space to find 3@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C like precision - 5+@C until 15 hcp|pg||
nt|jwit: 3NT pretty normal for NS, but might not be that easy to make|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: 3nt?|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: @d lead (a trump lead) kills 5@s too|pg||
nt|grebrof: 5@d|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no play in 6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now we see why no heart raise on prior hand|pg||
nt|friggi: hi |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h might just live|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk5: Vore kampe kl. 15.00 efter lunchpausen bliver Island-Danmark Open og Sverige-Finland Damer|pg||
nt|grebrof: I see swedish juniors open frequently at 8-9hp bal -  its their style - no system is perfect|pg||
nt|haans: NS bidding right this far|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H uppercut in clubs|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 3 is too high since S will get a heart promotion|pg||
nt|bagman: On a good day both hearts and clubs behave and EW can make a NT game. No both suits are unfriendly and resulted in 3 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass with 17 can be a risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  trouble with playing short @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Another grand slam|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Two grands in nie hands. Good cardshufflers|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: yes the last one was misscored, it was equal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and good bidders|pg||
nt|haans: would have preferred 3@H to 2|pg||
nt|haans: usually not hearts|pg||
nt|haans: easy way to win IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: W might even let this go undoubled|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@S should go a few down but there isnt that many losers so EW cant afford to slip too much|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, seen dbl now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2N constructive of course|pg||
nt|bridge_one: having 2@D @H @S to bid|pg||
nt|haans: cards look from for 3nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C or 3Nt now by south|pg||
nt|jwit: 8 tricks off the top. 9th trick may not be easy|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks to go close but 4@s quite cheap|pg||
nt|haans: we will soon see if 21C was Drury of natural|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|zebutin: offshape overcall with 4cards, offshape x without 3rd @D...so many options for bidding...|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 1nt is 12-14. Last hand w opened 1nt with bal 13hcp|pg||
nt|ralfwil: dbl is 500|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@H is some bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: no hcp no shape no controls |pg||
nt|skaftij:  East certainly has his bid|pg||
nt|haans: Dtury|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: hard to stay below game now|pg||
nt|haans: good bidding by Åhlén|pg||
nt|mmmakela: as does W|pg||
nt|phil: the double fit for NS makes 5@c pretty inexpensive|pg||
nt|skaftij:  300|pg||
nt|friggi: 2@H now|pg||
nt|gmarco24: time for showing @h?|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|grebrof: never buy a thai keyboard - mainly I am guessing :D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The blockage in hearts is awkward for declarer in 5D|pg||
nt|bjurn:  good lead!|pg||
nt|bagman: EW are likely to score 2 spades by E , diamond overruf by W and the @CA|pg||
nt|bjurn:  @DK, @C towards the @CK?|pg||
nt|bagman: If west gets in with the @CA he can shoot a trump thru kill the club ruff|pg||
nt|phil: not much to the play here|pg||
nt|haans: di not pay to find that 5@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wlc back to Phil Clayton|pg||
nt|phil: hi all|pg||
nt|gmarco24: not yet   :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  and transfer responses I suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: low score|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody steals from e.  5332 with a marginal (?) suit.|pg||
nt|haans: 31S now focing in my book|pg||
nt|runnerup: this looks like 2 down |pg||
nt|haans: not often you see 2nt as constructive|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 tricks easy because east controls both minors|pg||
nt|ady: hi Phil|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  You have to play some kind of Exclusion-blackwood to bid it. Very difficult|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @C (W) - 4 @H (E) - 5 NT - how difficult can you make it, Culbertsonour good old freind|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I exclude exclusion|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Board 6 is also misscored. Hopefully they will be corrected shortly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph lead is normal on the bidding|pg||
nt|derric: shouldn't be a problem on this lie of cards|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: Sorry, I'm lost..|pg||
nt|haans: np :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: syntax error?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: best lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, 4@H makes but 4@S is only 300|pg||
nt|ianmcc: West now interested|pg||
nt|friggi: must be, he knows of a good fit|pg||
nt|affe82:  looks normal. should be one off.|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: 1@c is 15+ i believe|pg||
nt|zebutin: but i think they have some bid over strong @C that tells majors, so even that could have been option...|pg||
nt|derric: i don't know if x is take-out|pg||
nt|bridge_one: declarer can make a mistake now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: J@H and @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: double fit, and all honors working almost|pg||
nt|muppe: Would u DBL south hand or pass?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|grebrof: not sure I would have bid in these circumstnces anyway|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Would u sell?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think East should have bid @h|pg||
pc|c5|nt|zebutin: seems like will lose atleast 3 @S, @D and @C...and cant raise @D suit either before has removed all trumps, and might lose control because of @C suit...|pg||
nt|zebutin: so needs some delicate play|pg||
nt|iceking: east should signal with @S K here|pg||
nt|haans: in scandinavia we all use reverse carding|pg||
nt|friggi: this might create some swing |pg||
pc|c2|nt|grebrof: not all|pg||
nt|yuval10: South needs to switch to @c before she cash the 2nd @d of course|pg||
nt|gmarco24: hard to see how this is going to finish|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mbruun:  In the Open series, the Danish West, HC Graversen lead the HA to beat 3 NT by one on board 6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I doÂ´nt know heir system (either) - but 4 @C from West instead of 3 @H would have been better|pg||
nt|cenglund:  This may be a huge swing|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would, to my shame, double|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck: maybe worried @sK would suggest @d pref|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1@c opening in the other room contains a whole lot of diffferent stuff, so not that strange that lead wasnt found|pg||
nt|gautis2: yes, will be 11 imps to Norway|pg||
nt|grebrof: allthou I do prefer it|pg||
nt|haans: but: shogunng: but you have to take sps first|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nothing left to buy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might lead diamond king|pg||
nt|ady: good spot   with a couple of club ruffs|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gulyas: that was the cheapest:)|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|wahlis:  4@h in the other room|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  Next board...|pg||
nt|mbruun:  It seems strange to give up the investigations|pg||
nt|iceking: yes probably thinking about that|pg||
nt|santyclz: She was listening...|pg||
nt|jbgood: halfway through - and N has not scored a single imp..|pg||
nt|diaoff: Needed to score the club trick first|pg||
nt|jbgood: the pure downer has gone now - S needed to cash 2 clubs - but a club to the king and another is testing, E will have to double finesse @h 10-9 to make it|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a measly 50 for a vul game|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I think 4@s will make so 5@h will probablu be correct... anyone to analyse if 4@s can be set?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: South cannot have 5 hearts|pg||
nt|phil: with 3-2 trump there's no work to this|pg||
nt|ady: draw 3 rounds of trumps if leading KQ diamonds    but still I tghink 9 tricks|pg||
nt|friggi: very strange|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: now impossible lose the contract|pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Defence can't afford a slightest slip |pg||
pc|c7|nt|zebutin: this seems to be on road for atleast 1 down at this rate|pg||
nt|zebutin: but with @C return is able to raise @C suit, so defence needs to be sharp too|pg||
nt|derric: 4 black suit ruffs and @DAK@hAK would make 8|pg||
nt|sharkey: Marianne had a difficult decision over 4@S - 5@D not a winner this time as 4@S wud have failed|pg||
nt|bjurn:  should be 2 down now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|muppe: no they play just 5542, no transfer responses.|pg||
nt|haans: and diamonds|pg||
nt|gmarco24: trump i good from N, the best defence|pg||
nt|gmarco24: is good*|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gmarco24: 4@h is not cold, who knows|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@c is getting cool|pg||
nt|friggi: but W should show this @H regardless|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mbruun:  How about 5D after 4c. When partner shows two aces bid 5 N and partner will cuebid 6 H which will get them to the grand. Maybe they have other agreements of course|pg||
nt|haans: so the big question is Will 3@H make |pg||
nt|bagman: Not much for N to do; loses two clubs as cannot ruff the 2nd club loser|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: on hand 18 3NT failed by 1 trick  where n/s played 2@S on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  then I would respond 1@d with W|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jwit: Good play of diamond Jack|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i know i would over 1@s for sure|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yuval10: the 4@c helped, of course|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jbgood: will not do|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: 4@S was the good winner|pg||
nt|haans: :) :(|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jbgood: one can understand that their inspiration is not at its peak|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bagman: The defense sets up the @HK in the process so they cannot  force N to lead 3 times clubs from hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: and down|pg||

nt|haans: play diamonds and hang|pg||

pc|s7|pc|hT|nt|bridge_one: the endplay against east is very clear|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|cT|nt|derric: no success|pg||
nt|zebutin: now she is losing 2 more, so swedish women continue to gain imps|pg||
nt|derric: 2 more for south|pg||
nt|ady: BOKK got 12 imps on hand 20 6@C -  e/w also went down 3 in 3@H in open room so 600 to BOKK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gmarco24: good defence here|pg||

nt|psyck: leb may not apply here anyway|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C-2@C-6@C in my book|pg||
nt|jwit: Couldn't agree more.  I don't even like overcalling 2 of a minor with 5-3-3-2 and full values, let alone subminimal|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1@h = spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: 3, I wrote wrong|pg||
nt|gulyas: they have the points, but the suits don't behave|pg||
nt|gulyas: need some help from the opps:)|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H do assume 4-5 in M|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: can make a lot with majors favorable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: me too never bid 2@C with south cards :)|pg||
nt|haans: not winning contract = scoreing points|pg||
nt|friggi: a lot of help|pg||
nt|affe82:  i would not have balanced as east|pg||
nt|affe82:  aren't we thrilled they chose to play in our 5c suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  DoesÂ´nt matter - it forces East to show the suits with control, and 4 @H is a true dream to hear|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Thats true. Might work out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In my world, a doubleton is shortage|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead are not so good|pg||
nt|runnerup: other table used 7 bids to reach 3nt -bad for F|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2NT will be at least 800|pg||
nt|phil: 1@s is like a weak NT? |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: many bid 1@C with 2+ clubs|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|ady: as kib mentioned 3NT makes as they lay   clubs 4-4   and diamonds worth 4 tricks    but should get to 4 spades|pg||
pc|cA|nt|iceking: ok 3@H it is have to admit i was not thinking about 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: that is one bid no one could have guessed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not 4@s - at least -1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not off to a good start...|pg||
nt|haans: National Teams?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only when it's right lol|pg||
nt|haans: transfer |pg||
nt|gulyas: nothing helps here|pg||
nt|gulyas: systemic misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ianmcc: is this correct?|pg||
nt|friggi: cant be right|pg||
nt|gulyas: somebody forgot they play (or don't play) 2 way checkback|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but South had opened 1@s|pg||
pc|c2|nt|derric: looks like lost 2@s 4@d 1@c in open|pg||
nt|zebutin: @D Q helped atleast 1 trick|pg||
nt|grebrof: just as my gf - its her birthday, but she is still cleaning :)|pg||
nt|derric: didn't expect a raise on with cards|pg||
nt|haans: raise with three can cost|pg||
nt|haans: no diamods stopper|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east is showing a big hand, so 2@S is lame|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I reckon this will make for a pickup!|pg||
nt|gmarco24: we can suggest to BBO:"autoplay for ruff, when partner is singleton option" :)|pg||
nt|friggi: agree to that:)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: hard work needed to make this one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: has to pop and play @hAx|pg||
nt|gmarco24: or peek in opponents cards|pg||
nt|haans: West bids strong|pg||
nt|robinswr: partner couldn't bid over 1@d means he has diamonds also|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  3 rounds of @S - East discarding the @C Queen... voila!|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Thick single some players call it |pg||
nt|mbruun:  Any play for 3 NT here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mathias, please take a look at the defence, I just figured out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6-7 tricks N/S - or so|pg||
nt|jbgood: operator - didnt 3 @h go down?|pg||
nt|haans: understand nothing|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wow, both souths bid 3 NT w void|pg||
nt|skaftij:  ugh|pg||
nt|muppe: What to lead?|pg||
nt|henryb:  when in doubt ...|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|runnerup: really strains |pg||
nt|haans: i open best minor 1@C with 3-3 = simple slam|pg||
nt|bagman: Sometimes bad things happen; it's part of the game|pg||
nt|bagman: It happens even to the best of the best|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: 2@c and 2 aces|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Well I asked about 4@s last deal if it makes or not, the kibbs say yes and no :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: this contact is no party .. |pg||
nt|gautis2: but no double, no trouble..  probably 3 imps to Finland|pg||
nt|haans: @H5 cannot have the 8 or Q|pg||
nt|psyck: now dummy can be killed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course, there was no indication that @cs were so unevenly divided.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c should be a @d signal|pg||
pc|c8|nt|zebutin: and if now returns @D helps 1 more because ruffs winner anyway|pg||
nt|derric: and @d return now would help another|pg||
nt|iceking: another pick-up for iceland here|pg||
nt|grebrof: it is more than a party :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: @cs is just as good as any - or?|pg||
nt|sharkey: looking at all hands - yes...|pg||
nt|grebrof: well. you have 7cards in the suit and "maybe" an entrance|pg||
nt|haans: Harding do not want to play :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol - has to be a black suit I think|pg||
nt|mmmakela: seems ok in this seq|pg||
nt|haans: chicken bid by South|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mbruun:  Not the best start for defense|pg||
nt|haans: er have all seen it before many minors never found|pg||
nt|mmmakela: YES, pd has some cds|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead.:)|pg||
nt|derric: cards lie well yet again|pg||
nt|haans: they find game by not passing before|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Hulda recounting....|pg||
nt|bjurn:  it's seems like an odd choice tho, p would've passed with some high cards|pg||
nt|ady: played by west   likley to go down|pg||
nt|ady: had some chance had east been declarer|pg||
pc|c5|nt|iceking: well judged from east here go low with good @S support|pg||
nt|gautis2: think T was a fail there...|pg||
nt|gautis2: may escape with 2 off|pg||
nt|grebrof: there are reasons for 1nt with Es hand - who knows how many @cs P have - in this case W would not had passed 1nt|pg||
nt|haans: in my book K+Q = dubbleton|pg||
nt|ady: not surprising e/w stayed low    25 HCP  including stiff Q@H    5 of a minor too high  and 4@S  precarious|pg||
pc|s9|nt|derric: though can try ruff the 4th anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ???|pg||
nt|haans: @SJ hoping|pg||
nt|haans: not as good|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Vores sidste kampe i dag, kl. 17.40, er Finland-Sverige Open og Norge-Danmark Damer. Yuval will translate for you|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D was tranfer to @H?|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|bjurn:  W might try @HJ now, since S took out 2@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South would have gone down in 2@d unless he made inspired play in trumps|pg||
nt|gmarco24: wow|pg||
nt|wahlis:  well done|pg||
nt|jbennet: wd|pg||
nt|friggi: yes it is, also very nice when the King in off side anyway|pg||
nt|jbennet: declare did in fact choose the only sensible way and was rewarded for it.|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i wonder would he play it this way if there was one fast entry to hand|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|mbruun:  But declarer can only come to eight tricks any way|pg||
nt|jbgood: N has shown 20-21, and 2@d was waiting - showing cards|pg||
nt|diaoff: Not straightforward on a @D lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: if could be a bigger pickup if this goes down, say if dec reads cards wrong|pg||
nt|psyck: well, not more confy ones @d's home|pg||
nt|ralfwil: shorten dummy with @s|pg||
nt|psyck: *now more|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, @s would have been better than @d there|pg||
nt|iceking: iam waiting for undo for this @D return|pg||
nt|psyck: lot of work still to do everywhere|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1 down|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, !K was marked off side|pg||
nt|ianmcc: all this for 1 IMP|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: a lot easier with all hands in view|pg||
nt|haans: 9 have the 8|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure it looks odd and from kibitzer point of view it looks stupid but S might have different thoughts of the auction and even different agreements|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: Fuglestad can count|pg||
nt|jbennet: so why it was the only sensible way???|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's making again, if South play @h to Ace then J@h discarding @c|pg||
pc|sK|nt|santyclz: The @s return rather than a @d cost a fatal tempo.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now East will be shortened and go -200|pg||
pc|sT|nt|grebrof: brb - my woman went away on a "businesstrip", so I am doing the laundry . imagine! :)|pg||
nt|bagman: If Gitelman Moss can go -1600 in 4@HXX with xx facing xxx we all can end up in someting silly :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cenglund:  Not a good line of play|pg||

nt|haans: @D9 and off you go|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Declarer got the tricks that were within reach at the onset|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You did well, Yuval|pg||
nt|yuval10: :) tack|pg||
nt|jbgood: i am afraid the standing is 50-0 - unless 3@h really made on   25 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT for NS and tea break.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure how they play, but 1@H is possible with 0 points in some versions of this system|pg||
nt|friggi: but N-S shoudl have played trump earlier|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  finesser's paradise for N-S|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you open 1@d what do you rebid over 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: big chance for E/W|pg||
nt|haans: Big diamond 17+|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not very nice to go down in NT when 7 min available|pg||
nt|bagman: S not happy, though, as he cannot be sure that he lost only 5; could be worse if team mates missed the game or went minus in the game|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@H might give Lirarna a chance here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C max for N/S - 4@H can be dangerous for E/W|pg||
mb|1S|nt|skaftij:  9 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but he could have used @s as entry - didn't have to hook @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: east call himself an idiot, and says Hi to you all!|pg||
mb|d|nt|derric: pass over 4@s by E wasn't good with 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|zebutin: cecilia didnt double with QJ1098 of spades when opponents were in 4@S...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Easy 12 tricks here in NT or @cs, let's see what Katrine and jessica will do|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S nat forcing|pg||
nt|sharkey: another slam possibility for the Finns...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another slam, this time a cold one|pg||
nt|wahlis:  2@c FG relay|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 6@h in other room. interesting fit!  :)|pg||
nt|haans: good to double 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: strange  e/w managed to get penalty double of 3 spades in open room|pg||
mb|3S|nt|zebutin: 3@D ? invite to fullgame?|pg||
nt|iceking: most likely final result here 4@S |pg||
nt|yuval10: this hand should be interesting as well|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: easy 3nt if no Hearts lead :)|pg||
nt|haans: may be stayman|pg||
nt|haans: stopping in 3@C good at OR|pg||
nt|robinswr: some 1nt some 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: with a few o/t's :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 26 HCP not every day....|pg||
nt|haans: and so we learn :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - we will see|pg||
nt|haans: Big Diamonds has its problems|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H not GF I think|pg||
nt|cenglund:  You shouldn't miss this one under any circumstances|pg||
nt|grebrof: allthou these are artificial bidders - it might not be so easy|pg||
nt|haans: Magic Diamonds comes from Carroy Clubs as natural as possible (possible)|pg||
nt|psyck: this should be easier to get also for E|pg||
nt|santyclz: A slam too good for Roland  but sub-par for the rest of us.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Off an ace and qjxx of trump.|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks as if it made on a different defense than we saw.. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: but 3@H makeble|pg||
nt|mmmakela: par reached in OR|pg||
nt|mmmakela: lacking dbl to be excact|pg||
nt|phil: 2@s = 9-12|pg||
nt|henryb:  Aha. The Precision trap: open 2@c with W hand and avoid any major suit fits|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H very odd bid in OR|pg||
nt|gmarco24: we might see 6@s here|pg||
mb|d|nt|mbruun:  THis board wont take long. 450 for EW |pg||
nt|hawe45:  450 both tables, next|pg||
nt|gmarco24: or just 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s - at least on this board|pg||
nt|sharkey: as long as N can show @S support shud be in slam|pg||
nt|psyck: slam may still go down if bid, if dec played N for single @h honor|pg||
nt|jbgood: and this one presents no problems - duck and ten on a @d endplaying E|pg||
nt|runnerup: now 4h ew looks diificult to bid  -can it to made dont know but lookes possible|pg||
nt|ady: plent of strength e/w   but no fit  so will end in 3NT|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wait till he sees +5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this very thin 3NT probably has to make|pg||
nt|friggi: @S lead kills|pg||
nt|muppe: Aggressive overcall|pg||
mb|4C|nt|derric: what?|pg||
nt|zebutin: might be missing some pass somewhere...|pg||
nt|zebutin: maybe johanssen passed|pg||
nt|zebutin: Erkkilä bid 3@D|pg||
nt|zebutin: Andersson x:ed|pg||
nt|derric: possible|pg||
nt|zebutin: and Ahonen bid 3@H...|pg||
nt|zebutin: thats my quess|pg||
nt|zebutin: i see no way that this is the real bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: sorry, my misstake!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 5/5 bid 2@D is a risk|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D bid once and out|pg||
nt|wahlis:  2@d no SPL|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Can make 480 with @C-continuation|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We really hope, that the mis-scored boards will be changed before sundau at midnoght...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  sunday|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I'm going to change them after this rond!|pg||
nt|haans: nothing say W have five spades|pg||
nt|haans: psychic bidding?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could lose only 3 @s and @dA. Anyway hypothetical|pg||
nt|henryb:  very.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Note: the right play in @d is low to Q|pg||
nt|affe82:  as I play 2@c would show both minors. either could be longer|pg||
nt|affe82:  playing that way has some drawbacks but in this case makes the rebid easy|pg||
nt|robinswr: good lead for the offense|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: well - N doesnt have a lot to offer besides @s-support|pg||
nt|grebrof: did S show @S now?|pg||
nt|haans: step respone = four cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: well - thats all S needs...|pg||
nt|bagman: In principle NS lose only heart, club and a diamond in heart contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  which wins against Kx or Kxx onside|pg||
nt|muppe: This will probably make.|pg||
nt|henryb:  the sneak attack|pg||
nt|henryb:  of course, if the Q loses to the K you will have to guess net time|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C a make all cards right|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: on normal @C lead its possible win all the tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: it depends over the lead...if the lead is the natural @s lead then it looks like they should go for restricted choice|pg||
nt|haans: do assume that|pg||
nt|skaftij:  strange with @h suit|pg||
nt|phil: Ive been told that its good to achieve plus scores at IMPs :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: seems stupid with those hearts|pg||
nt|haans: we have all heard about that Rare :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not so sure about that, 4 of either major looks better|pg||
nt|ady: 6 of a minor can be made by e/w    but terrible contract|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: but after a @d lead...|pg||
nt|iceking: creative lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: ty Hans|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Even the grand one is making|pg||
nt|sharkey: S probing - shud keep in mind they have messed up all slams so far|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud this be affecting South now?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I am not saying you should be in 7|pg||
nt|haans: missing @HK they wont|pg||
nt|haans: have they forgotten steps?|pg||
nt|haans: urkkkkkkkkkk|pg||
nt|bagman: In practice they might lose more|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nubmaster: After this start they will get to slam and make some imps here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice bidding so far:))|pg||
nt|runnerup: this if good stagegy -double and take your money wd|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|haans: Only EW bidding|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cenglund:  Probably a push board|pg||
nt|gautis2: 3N is reached..seems like a flat board |pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: if the lead isn't @s then you can still make it if the hand with 3 @h's also have 3 @d's|pg||
nt|haans: no @HT good card|pg||
nt|haans: bidding wrong|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 4@h from W operator. undo|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|psyck: 3/5th against suit :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: follow with @dQ|pg||
nt|iceking: unbid suit |pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sQ is a keycard|pg||
nt|jbgood: now E gets squeezed in the reds instead|pg||
nt|haans: good strategy but rare nowdays|pg||
nt|mmmakela: lead was risky imo from that holding|pg||
nt|haans: But Aldeborg did bid right|pg||
pc|s9|nt|grebrof: well, its only one board they lost in a slam position - N could hardly do anymore than 4@s now|pg||
nt|grebrof: well done by S|pg||
nt|sharkey: N thinking 7?????|pg||
nt|sharkey: extras :)?|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe its Marianne in E|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hardly - I think|pg||
nt|haans: maybe asking about bids|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead os the killer|pg||
nt|haans: is|pg||
nt|bjurn:  will be hard to find|pg||
nt|haans: true :)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  E know that partner wont hold much|pg||
nt|bagman: I would not consider a spade lead for a long time with E hand :)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477&csm=Rank&nt=3&nr=1&ns=1&nb=1&csh=0000000000111|pg||
nt|bjurn:  running scores|pg||
nt|ady: opted for 5-2  spade fit     should have little problem with favourable lay -out|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 4@h in two rounds of bidding in OR|pg||
nt|friggi: yes here people are not wasting any cards in the box|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this would be a thin slam even if hearts broke|pg||
nt|jbennet: see if NS are on their way to get overboard. it lies with players nature to hope that the relay system may let them find a slam not bid ot the other table.|pg||
nt|muppe: Maybe they heard you Henry when you said finnessers paradise for NS? And then bid 3nt :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  now a @c to 10?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  Now 12 tricks possible - in fact easy, South beeing caught in a show-up-squeeze|pg||
nt|nubmaster: The Icelandic kibbs are hoping for the grand, lol|pg||
nt|bagman: Even if the spade lead is right, N might hold up twice; well done, though|pg||
nt|bjurn:  another great lead|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck: @d ruff will set up a trump trick for only 1 o/t|pg||
nt|grebrof: she likes to think - which is the reason she is in this team :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but bidding marginal slams doesn't pay|pg||
nt|haans: mo bids from NS |pg||
nt|haans: no|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I need to leave now, by all|pg||
nt|grebrof: by Christer|pg||
nt|grebrof: or bye - again my thai keyboard tricks me|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@d was asking for singelton, 4@c denied|pg||
nt|henryb:  read it on screen|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: if S reads it, that is (not evident)|pg||
nt|haans: think declarer take her cards|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - I do too|pg||
nt|haans: its not MP|pg||
nt|haans: but cost nothing|pg||
nt|jbgood: so Denmark is currently leading the pack - Norway 7 VPs behind per now|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade or a diamond now?|pg||
nt|jbennet: no excatly|pg||
nt|ianmcc: there are better ways of earning a cheque|pg||
nt|jbennet: marginal slams have costed lots of inp:s in the past|pg||
nt|jbennet: and will continue to do so over time|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gautis2: may get 10?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now if 6@S from dummy must play the J in North|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|psyck: if 4@s was cue, i'd have expected E to bid slam even missing 1 key card|pg||
nt|mmmakela: shd be no accidents for def here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump back|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: good MP would have been to finesse clubs 10|pg||
nt|gmarco24: if he make this one too i'll suspect that E is not holding cards well  :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ralfwil: claim 12....|pg||
nt|gulyas: why wouldn't he ruff a @S? makes no sense|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Now tactically should w play against restricted choice, hoping the slam fails?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  not possible|pg||
nt|henryb:  useful 7 or 8 imps for N-S team|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzdq: now the director is here, because W got the wrong explanision, but know they decided to wait until afterwards|pg||
nt|gmarco24: how many pass bids were in the bidding box?|pg||
nt|jbennet: there arersome who claimes that agressive leads vs slams is winng|pg||
nt|gmarco24: does bidding table here has a scroll option?  :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but must lose 1@h & 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: Upmark picked up 6@H, but put it back again!|pg||
nt|wahlis:  He might finesse @h when the ten drops|pg||
nt|friggi: that is his only chance|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a joker with J10x|pg||
pc|d3|nt|grebrof: the last board - looked more of a success playing the @c K at trick 1 - the trumpswitch wasnt a winner|pg||
nt|mmmakela: surely poss w 3x dias|pg||
nt|ianmcc: curious|pg||
nt|ianmcc: is he still playing 2@d?|pg||
nt|friggi: maybe he told ut the answer earlier:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe he is playing notrump:)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: of course that's it|pg||
nt|friggi: must be|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: 10 @C means J, so np for defence|pg||
nt|haans: an undo here so ...|pg||
nt|gmarco24: J@c lead would be interesting  :D|pg||
nt|ianmcc: criminal|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, small then|pg||
nt|gmarco24: now the harder part:"ok, what was your bidding?"|pg||
nt|jbennet: a typical realy sequence. getting them overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: S has shown his shape and 2 aces, 1 king and 2 queens|pg||
nt|jbennet: relay system|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: endplay|pg||
nt|jbennet: the books says lead agressive agaisnt small slams|pg||
nt|muppe: had 9 tricks if @cK on, didn't want to risk contract. Although spades seem to be 4-4 because of the bidding.|pg||
nt|haans: good try but ...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
mc|12|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  not now|pg||
nt|haans: Did say no to diamonds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NEXT|pg||
nt|jbennet: the books are wrong (whenever an agressive lead had an influence on the outcome|pg||
nt|muppe: So maybe @c to T would be safe|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the session|pg||

nt|grebrof: I never get overtricks either - my chances in pairs are opps making mistakes :D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or 2 if av|pg||
nt|ady: kib suggests 6@C can make without a trump lead   ambitious  but maybe possible|pg||
nt|muppe: Last board now.|pg||
nt|gmarco24: with one more entry 6nt is making, so learn from good players not to dbl slams with good trump holding|pg||
nt|haans: :) Time to thank us and  you and Johanna Vindeful VUGRAPH :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: thank you!|pg||
nt|ady: grand slam to complete|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Normal for me|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 @H not a bad contr here|pg||
nt|affe82:  so this should start with 1@h- no?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gautis2: a hughe score for Finland in OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: the Swede pair in the OR failed to reach 6@d as well ( speaking of board 8 ). This doesn't look like the best of set for them|pg||
nt|psyck: EW have a good sac against the @s game|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 3@D maybe|pg||
nt|gautis2: pretty good lay in 5@c :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: (or 3N(|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2@c should give some gaz to N here too|pg||
nt|haans: why 1@H instead of 4|pg||
nt|runnerup: but unlucky|pg||
nt|jwit: Should be a push here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 @C at second trick declarer would try to duck his K|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, let's say doubleton K@c at W would leat to 6@h making!|pg||
nt|ady: thx Johananna|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|mmmakela: i @D call helps but ensures defeat in 4|pg||
nt|jbennet: this hand illsutrates the reason why evolution doesnt prmote relay systems.t |pg||
nt|haans: Correction : gronkvist: vinefur|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 3@h?|pg||
nt|grebrof: S has normally shown a good and - and shes got one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting board.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Nothing exciting unless someone decides to shed more BLOOD|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last segment in Sweden postponed 15 minutes. New start time: top of the hour|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good pass from North - very tempting to X|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psyck: an option  3rd seat fav for sure|pg||
nt|bjurn:  Pass: 0-7/17+|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@C: 8-11, 5+@C|pg||
nt|bjurn:  2@D relay (17+)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: as  suppdbl promising 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: for sure|pg||
nt|psyck: will poor breaks they will all do well to lie low however|pg||
nt|gautis2: 3N?|pg||
nt|haans: you may need to finesse clubs here|pg||
nt|haans: Carrot Clubs|pg||
mb|2D|nt|derric: seems like overbid|pg||
nt|haans: may be hard bidding only game|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3@D 3-3-1-6|pg||
nt|gulyas: double, with Ax in @H?|pg||
nt|gulyas: you mean 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: yeah, that's correct :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: maybe invite 55 only|pg||
nt|grebrof: I like 4@c too|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's a big stop by N.... A@s K@d A@c is all she needs to slam|pg||
nt|haans: only 3 in OR|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H must be forcing|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Rdl = 3@s?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: never|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|zebutin: 12-14 notrump...but they seem to stop at reasonable level still...most likely wont make, but atleast its not in red...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@c is like Gazzilli, strong (any) or nat with @cs|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@h is minimum vs the strong hand with 2c support|pg||
nt|gautis2: oh..4 @c solved all problems|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|haans: why not 1@S with tre spades|pg||
nt|haans: three|pg||
nt|fabsayc: transfer style overcall is a game killer here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: routine 3NT I'll leave now with scores almost locked. Bye and thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: 2N = asking for 3c M, 3@C denied it|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: 5c of couse|pg||
nt|friggi: yes they can be a double edge swords|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: well done|pg||
nt|jbennet: North was hoping for a dream scenario , but south:s hand was pretty much what could be expected.|pg||
nt|haans: Opinion 2: gronkvist: hon är söt oxå:) :)|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mbruun:  4H/S should be quite easy to reach, and nothing in the play. Dull board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  12-14 tror jeg|pg||
nt|cenglund:  5C depends on 1 successful finesse and DA onside, I wouldnt't stretch my luck that much|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 down - nothing much in it|pg||
nt|haans: lead hearts taking awat entry to fummy and spade finesses|pg||
nt|haans: d|pg||
nt|jbgood: unless S return a spade|pg||
nt|jbgood: (or even a @d ?)|pg||
nt|haans: but not enough|pg||
nt|haans: decl counting 9?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C finesse and @S play can reduce @D loosers to 2. Only Chance that I see.|pg||
nt|haans: recount shortly|pg||
nt|derric: scoring 4 black trick, 4 trumps and 2 ruffs would make 10|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not easy and may not make.|pg||
nt|gulyas: never double? agree|pg||
nt|ianmcc: never 3@d|pg||
nt|gulyas: disagree:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  An illustration of why to play Drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: but it's rather hard to inquier.... 5@d from N would probably be natural|pg||
nt|haans: yep start with hearts|pg||
nt|bjurn:  that would promise 4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=477  for running scores|pg||
nt|ianmcc: probably cheaper than X here|pg||
nt|friggi: what about 3NT?|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think its a close call between 3@D and pass, but I would never ever double|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|iceking: ufh|pg||
nt|iceking: east had no reason bid 3@D here |pg||
nt|nubmaster: Jessica thinks... well it's teams :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt actually makes agains normal d lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=475&csm=Rank&nt=3&nb=1&csh=0000000000111|pg||
nt|haans: but can ever 3nt be bid|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N shd do more?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: haha jaha ja :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: ducking a @s?|pg||
nt|psyck: it was going well upto the 3@c bid :)|pg||
nt|iceking: bidding suggest pd has 0-1@D|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@S long @C and most likely 3@H|pg||
nt|gautis2: after 600  u just hate to hear: push board:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: you are vul - we have seen their style earlier too|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The merit of the contact is that it's unbeatable|pg||
nt|grebrof: now dont need d! A onside anymore - providing a switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: true Christer|pg||
mb|4S|nt|diaoff: Only 6 trick available here, but might be hard for S to discard correctly on @D|pg||
nt|bjurn:  was wrong about E strength, shows 8-16|pg||
nt|bagman: They might find that they are off 2 keycards in clubs|pg||
nt|haans: on a pure finesse (clubs)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  3NT: 3 controls (A=2, K=1)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  4@D: no @C control (or @CAKQ)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  W knows that @Cs are, at best, on a finesse|pg||
nt|jwit: Declarer says Oh No, not a spade lead|pg||
nt|friggi: in E ofcause|pg||
nt|gulyas: if nv W can have such a powerful hand, then maybe...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT for E/W that 3@c was loaded|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs 7 solid @Cs and something else, and maybe a lucky lie of cards or defensive error|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, but both players open 3@C|pg||
nt|ianmcc: bye now back in 45|pg||
nt|haans: better slam than nlast board|pg||
nt|gmarco24: last board here. ty Hans. tx for watching kibitzers|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S way to fall off|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: promises 4 and min I guess|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Would seem best to bid 2 @s with 4|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|ralfwil: a @d shift and -2|pg||
nt|grebrof: you finnish or swedish?|pg||
nt|runnerup: can be beateng ofcause can make olso|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Immediate Law|pg||
nt|haans: If you dont find Grand your off|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: opponents seem to be on right road by removing the trumps in both hands, diamonds arent even so they wont bring anything extra to the table|pg||
nt|ianmcc: playing @s looks best|pg||
nt|grebrof: or just simply South African?|pg||
nt|grebrof: "the @c K is always single?"|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Finnish, but I lived 7 years in South Africa|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|derric: now i don't see an alternative to the @c finesse|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here a crazy 6@S is ON with this layout|pg||
nt|gmarco24: and good job Johanna|pg||
nt|haans: :) bye 2 u all :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ralfwil: will make now! win with @hK and a @s to @sA discard a @d on @cK|pg||
nt|bjurn:  but if E has @DA instead of @HA 6@C is still a good contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only if 2@H promised spades, might not|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not all would have bid game here|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - pick up for the Finns here as game not bid OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: 10 IMPs back|pg||
nt|haans: im of skaftj side|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Many thanks to Johanna, our excellent operator in Örebro. Well done as usual!|pg||
mb|5S|nt|pelu: HL = odd No|pg||
nt|ralfwil: very bad defence|pg||
nt|nubmaster: and it will make now|pg||
nt|haans: discarding not always funnt|pg||
nt|haans: funny|pg||
nt|mmmakela: check out the situation in open series live|pg||
nt|mmmakela: very tight|pg||
nt|haans: they are that bad? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: perhaps 4h has best changes-but no here so 5  ti D|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|bjurn:  and further relaying wont help, they'll end up too high|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I like suppdbl equeiviant there|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: and to all our commentators|pg||
mb|6H|nt|henryb:  Drury lets you stop in 2@s instead of 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: and that settles it|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: bye , next game start 12.00|pg||
nt|friggi: bye all|pg||
mb|7N|nt|ianmcc: 2 down|pg||
nt|robinswr: best percentage is to play heart to the 10 and then 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: DONT do it:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: lol|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe asking about 1nt-bid|pg||
nt|psyck: on deal 10, after the same start, def switched to @d to beat the contract|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Thank you Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: sry Ralf, didn't read your row there|pg||
nt|runnerup: open everybody bid 6 clubs in 26 .with diamond void and very good cards|pg||
nt|haans: dummy still have a bid @DK|pg||
nt|haans: big|pg||
nt|gmarco24: last board now, ty Johanna, Johan, Fridrik...|pg||
nt|friggi: ty all|pg||
nt|gmarco24: thanks for watching, see you soon|pg||
nt|haans: taken a lot of time (bids)|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: might make additional @s in the end|pg||
nt|affe82:  quick brake now right?|pg||
nt|affe82:  see you all soon|pg||
nt|robinswr: if the opponents have no losers outside of trumps, best defense is often a sluff and a ruff |pg||
nt|ady: flat result|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gmarco24: i guess that catching the 9@d in trick one was a bad idea|pg||
