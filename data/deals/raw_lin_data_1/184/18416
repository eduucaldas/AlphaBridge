nt|bjacobs: Not at all.  This hand is a case in point.  Sorry to comment on the CR auction, but East's 4@S was a very hasty bid|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If West can have his actual hand, then East should make an auction that strongly invites game|pg||

nt|vugraphzgf: 2@H= 0-3 HCP|pg||
nt|avivs:  superaccepting gets them too high|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If 15-17 - this is a very hard 3 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: it is 15-17|pg||
nt|avivs:  I don't like super accepting with very soft minimum values|pg||
nt|peachy: Lucky they do not play Texas then, it would relaly be too high\|pg||
nt|peachy: really|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You see the problem, poor North may bid 4 now|pg||
nt|peachy: I think not, not a single control anywhere|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4S?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and can defence play on H - good hand this|pg||

pc|s5|nt|vugraphzgf: :)|pg||
nt|avivs:  so far not very good judgment by N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Especially after, what happened at board 9, I would have settled for some normal bids here|pg||
nt|peachy: Depends on their superaccept structure.  Some folks just superaccept with 4 always, some with just max, etc.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C 10 = @S, partner|pg||
nt|avivs:  @cT just show 9|pg||
nt|avivs:  denies Jack|pg||
nt|peachy: Normally, third hand shows attitude, unless dummy/bidding/other clues make it unnecessary, in which case the second card is rither count or suit preference, depending on agreement|pg||
nt|peachy: the card (not second card)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: certainly is now|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Double - stop the world, please (with that suit and that hand)|pg||

nt|jcomyn: dont understand this - they know peanly is inevitable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: penalty|pg||
nt|rmb1: Does anyone know if 4@C was systemically the majors or just an improvisation?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be majors and|pg||

nt|jcomyn: so is life|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: difficult problem for west now - he doesn't want to hear 5@H from his partner, so double might not appeal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good practical bidding by South - with game E/W (also)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but as a passed hand partner is perhaps less likely to bid 5@H - if he pulls the double it will generally be with a 3- or 2-suiter, with 4NT, which would be fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Easy...|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|avivs:  lucky 3NT|pg||
nt|avivs:  I would not want to be there looking just at the N/S hands|pg||
nt|avivs:  another push coming on board 11 with E/W in 4@s at other room|pg||
nt|avivs:  this is actually not cold|pg||
nt|avivs:  he will need to go after clubs (likely)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You must guess the @S and decide, which minor has H x by West|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  This will cost 550 - if...|pg||
nt|athene: double is "action" - just takeout-ish, saying he has a good 4@S opener|pg||
nt|athene: north thinks he has a choice now: -500 or -550? :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seen from the North-seat, South shall bring three tricks in the side-suit|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|avivs:  better chances for Hx in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: if you decide that east has Hx in a minor you can start leading a small one from hand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|athene: townsend expected a lot of shape for the 5-level overcall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Poor East - he liked his @S-singleton|pg||
nt|athene: he isn't sure if 6@D will make and he isn't sure if 5@S will|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats 3c?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: till now, every bid was alerted|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|athene: probably they are both down but he doesn't want to take the chance|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ntmon: long way to 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 3@D no 5 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 3@H = 5@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont see the point|pg||
nt|ianmcc: me neither transfer doesn't reveal West's hearts|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|bernix: i just wondered what 2@h meant|pg||
nt|avivs:  the only clue he has is that East has 1 extra heart...|pg||
nt|athene: if he starts with the @DJ and east ducks smoothly he might play west for @DKQ and take another finesse|pg||
nt|avivs:  now will test spades|pg||
nt|avivs:  and when they break 3-3 will finesse West|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with 1NT-2H    2S-3D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzgf: W just asked|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He has only the winning line to play - |pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  With a rather poor @D-suit, East might have expected mor high cards by partner|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too simple for experts i suppose|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think he'll trumps hearts to dummy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he can play it any aul way my granny will make this one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: granny would know about the black pictures|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think it says - lets impress the viewers with our esoteric system|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no point in learning all this stuff if you don't use it|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bernix: a likely push|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||

nt|peachy: Live eunning scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/GBT_2011/11_06_03_team.html|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: in textbookland when opps bid and raise clubs, and you have four, you know you can give partner a second-round ruff|pg||
nt|avivs:  50% that the @sK is one of the missing KCs and not off 2 aces and 50% that its on side|pg||
