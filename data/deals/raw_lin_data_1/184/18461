mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: E will commence with 1@H, W will bid 1@S, E will likely rebid 2@C (maybe 1NT), and they'll end in either 3NT or 4@S.  |pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|psyck: this should now come home with 5@s, 2@d, 2@c in due course of time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Much friendlier to receive a @C lead into E in 3NT than from N through E in 4@S.  They had a really nice auction.|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Likely a 1@D opening intending to rebid 2NT over pd's response; here none is forthcoming.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|an|!|nt|psyck: apparently they only need 13 cards to respond at this vul|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the modern game it is just detested to pass pd's opening.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psyck: support double likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: redouble that is|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now how do you feel about making the support redouble vs. bidding the 2NT (with the possibility of finding out about @H's later)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: xx better|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcwla: What's the rationale?|pg||
nt|psyck: you can always bid NT to show your values later|pg||
nt|psyck: this gives more room for more options|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: he has managed both at 2 level, whereas if 2NT 1st, yet to show support...|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is Wolff.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@C forcing 3@D then W will go back to 3@H (or conceivably pass).|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck: ok, W doubled N's 3@c|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, ok, Wolff sighoff sequence|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: I think we're missing a pass here.|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|d3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|psyck: tuf, pass likely|pg||
nt|psyck: some days i may try 1N or 2@c :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Pass would not be my choice.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have the master suit so not afraid of something like their finding a @H fit.|pg||
nt|psyck: at this vul, most days i'd pass though|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have good values and pd's pass over 1@D could be hiding as much as an opener.|pg||

nt|psyck: i agree, pd could occasionally have quite a bit...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|psyck: i'm not a bid fan of jumping with 4 cards and bal hands|pg||
nt|jcwla: E will open 1NT with a max, W will invite and they will settle comfortably in 3NT that depends on the lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|psyck: would you open 1N or 1@d here?|pg||
nt|jcwla: W might just blast - but E wants to be in vul games as much as W.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|jcwla: This is 9 with some downgrades.  As long as your style is to accept invites with anything but a dead min (as it should be), an invite is plenty in my book.|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case S does not find the magic @S lead and score it up.|pg||
nt|psyck: i would have probably opened 1@d all A's & K's & 5 card suit...|pg||
nt|psyck: agree, maybe vul game so just blasted|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||

mc|10|nt|granguru: thats why Charles Goren always said he prefered largely to play against experts than novices|pg||

nt|granguru: not so with beginners|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  huge West hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but very little opposite|pg||
nt|granguru: not many entries to partner's thou|pg||
mb|3S|nt|granguru: E has the worng cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  does 3*@s beat 5@d?|pg||
nt|granguru: wrong*  honors in minors would have been a treasure|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|granguru: doesnt seem so|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would it stop declarer from winning with 4th @d in dummy?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and then taking the @c finesse?|pg||
nt|granguru: W looks like a 4-6 or 5-6 minors 2-suited hand|pg||
nt|granguru: @C finesse is a must after 3@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at this vulnerability, West could be rather weaker|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  if the @dJ were doubleton, declarer could reach dummy on the 3rd @d|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|an|!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|psyck: they may play Double as Double negative (Q high or worse) & Pass as semiPositive|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|psyck: as expected, they reach the same doomed contract |pg||
nt|psyck: W would give a lot to exchange @hJ for @dJ (not that he may finesse @c even then)|pg||
nt|psyck: but after the 2@s bid, he would want to, if he could|pg||
