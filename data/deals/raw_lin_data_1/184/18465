mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: E will commence with 1@H, W will bid 1@S, E will likely rebid 2@C (maybe 1NT), and they'll end in either 3NT or 4@S.  |pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|psyck: this should now come home with 5@s, 2@d, 2@c in due course of time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Much friendlier to receive a @C lead into E in 3NT than from N through E in 4@S.  They had a really nice auction.|pg||

mb|1C|nt|bagman: sure, but some might lead to 4@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: that'll be ok too|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|joest: Berger has one of those hands that might well play better in hearts than spades|pg||
nt|joest: if hishand gets tapped as dummy, the heart suit could disappear|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: This might be a bit more problematic to handle than 4@H|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: it won't be that hard with spades breaking and south with no third club|pg||

nt|bagman: Now the defense has set up diamonds to tap dummy|pg||
nt|joest: yes good d|pg||
nt|bagman: But the diamonds come down with two ruffs; Perlman cannot see the layout and this might take some time|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: yes he doesn't have the luxury we do|pg||

nt|bagman: S cannot know that N holds two high diamonds|pg||
nt|bagman: If N had only one, declarer could pitch and then control the diamonds and draw trumps ending W to cash the hearts|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bagman: If S wins and taps dummy, declarer needs to guess the spade layout|pg||
nt|joest: on this layout, south has long hearts with long spades so even if Hamilton wins and taps the dummy he must follow after one more round of trumps and then two more rounds of hearts|pg||

nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3C|nt|psyck: apparently they only need 13 cards to respond at this vul|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the modern game it is just detested to pass pd's opening.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psyck: support double likely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks for me easier than 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: redouble that is|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now how do you feel about making the support redouble vs. bidding the 2NT (with the possibility of finding out about @H's later)?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: xx better|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: What's the rationale?|pg||
nt|psyck: you can always bid NT to show your values later|pg||
nt|psyck: this gives more room for more options|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: he has managed both at 2 level, whereas if 2NT 1st, yet to show support...|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is Wolff.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@C forcing 3@D then W will go back to 3@H (or conceivably pass).|pg||

mb|1C|nt|joest: In the Charles Goren era, the answer was: open 1@c and then bid spades twice|pg||
nt|bagman: In seniors the answer is 1@C|pg||
nt|joest: that is less commonplace today|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|joest: All the seniors graduated from Charles Goren University.  By definition!|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: With wasted hearts and no heart control W bids 4@S|pg||

mb|p|pc|hK|nt|joest: this hand will not take as long as the prior one.|pg||

nt|jcwla: E will open 1NT with a max, W will invite and they will settle comfortably in 3NT that depends on the lead.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|psyck: would you open 1N or 1@d here?|pg||
nt|jcwla: W might just blast - but E wants to be in vul games as much as W.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: some players makes a false cue in @h on a hand like W|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: This is 9 with some downgrades.  As long as your style is to accept invites with anything but a dead min (as it should be), an invite is plenty in my book.|pg||

nt|jcwla: the hand, you know your structure very well, you're primed for a nice, intelligent auction.   You just don't feel the same sense of feet on the ground with a 1@D opening.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|bagman: S is very minimum and N has good looking hand; NS might end up bidding game|pg||
nt|joest: that's the problem with opening 11 counts (which I do).  Partner rarely lets you out with a 12 count|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|joest: this is an 'action' double|pg||
nt|bagman: If NS can stay here, they might score a game|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: pass is a good bet|pg||
nt|joest: but it runs the risk of partner passing before you have had a chance to show your club fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Burger wishing he had tried 1@s a round earlier I suspect|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bagman: The auction looked innocent and he wanted to bid the longest suit|pg||
nt|joest: while neither east nor west did anything clearly wrong, their cumulative decisions have landed them in a dreadful spot|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: well these days the auction is not so innocent|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: when RHO passes, (no support double) a misfit is often in the wing|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|joest: but, hey, there is nothing 'wrong' with bidding 2@d that's for sure|pg||
nt|bagman: If W bids 1@S he risks a raise|pg||
nt|joest: but at least he hasn't volunteered himself to the two level|pg||
nt|joest: you can blame partner for getting us to the two level! :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|bagman: and there's some lead value in spades|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bagman: but still, I would bid 2@D and end up in this mess, too|pg||
nt|joest: the one level is just way harder to punish and I would be of the view that we are potentially in trouble.  And red vs. white trouble at that|pg||

nt|bagman: 3@D promising one major and 3@H spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|bagman: then 3NT tells I don't have spades, guess what's my major suit :)|pg||
nt|joest: now with all his stuff in the blacks I suspect Howard Perlman corrects back to 6NT but we'll see|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Stuff in blacks and no ruffing value; maybe he passes as he might guess that AQx provides a discard|pg||
nt|joest: that's very reasonable too|pg||
nt|bagman: to control spades in case of spade lead and misguess as the case is now|pg||
nt|joest: although on this layout spades is your trick source :)|pg||
mb|6N|nt|bagman: mixed feelings e-wards|pg||

nt|joest: good lead|pg||
nt|joest: Burger with a million things to do and this solved none of his problems|pg||
nt|bagman: The spade lead was near certainty to finesse something in partner's hand|pg||

nt|joest: he knew LHO had four|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||

mc|9|nt|bagman: Partner might not pattern out with 5-3-1-4 and singleton H in diamonds even in this auction as there's no guarantee of 8 card fit|pg||
