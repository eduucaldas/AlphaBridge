mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ronpa: Hi all|pg||
nt|jtr: Hello again people|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|Walddk3: 1@C is often (11)12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk3: N-S play a variation of Polish Club|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and so do E-W|pg||
nt|jtr: West fearless as usual|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ronpa: Yes, a bit agressive especially vul vs not but he is young :)|pg||

nt|mich-b: Hi all|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ronpa: I'm sure smirnov can imagine passing and playing on a 3-3 fit right now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ronpa: thinking partner took his 2@D as pick a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: dont see any danger for 2@h|pg||
nt|mich-b: 2@D was intended as natural , and imo should be natural|pg||
nt|mich-b: however with @H 3-3 2@H looks ok too|pg||
nt|brgpro: can always make 3@h 3@d and 2 each in the blacks|pg||
nt|brgpro: i mean 1 each|pg||
nt|ronpa: Yes Michael but playing in 3-3 fits is YOUR professional, not mine :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcwla: I don't understand this auction after about the 1@D mark but oh well.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|brgpro: NS is a new pdship i think, they might play a version of dutch doubleton though i am not sure|pg||
nt|brgpro: if that is the case, then 1@c=2+ and 1@d=0-7 or @d, |pg||
nt|jtr: Could declarer misguess the @hs?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont know for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe North bids 1@h with 4 over the X?|pg||
nt|ronpa: declarer can just not touch trumps for now and let the defence do it for him|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think jan Jansma is not a Dutch doubleton guy...|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c4|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|brgpro: or some version of Polish @c, in that case, 1@d can also be a neg. bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|avivs:  hello everyone|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: the dutch guys have been playing very well |pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: 1@S= no major|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @S might be a better bid by West - sometimes keeping N/S out of 3 NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and s of course law of total tricvks and all that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: E/W play a natural system|pg||

pc|h6|nt|peachy: Hi Aviv, kibitzers|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: cant pass surely|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Poor contract, but seems to bring 110|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|peachy: Some sort of misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Robin Barker|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi|pg||
nt|jcomyn: howdy|pg||
nt|rmb1: I expect NS have enough partnership experience/understanding to cash out|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  South has the problem, that he is short of entries for the "minor"-work|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ianmcc: winning action|pg||
nt|ianmcc: presumably @hQ a sp|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|avivs:  looks like Townsend should have corrected to 2@d... this is not their best spot|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcomyn: could i ask a reasonable question as to why netherlands seem to be on every vu-graph every time|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  Thanks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: Bakshi may have bid 2C, as relay to 2D (part of two way checkback)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure you can - BUT NOT HERE!!!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Home now endplaying West|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  Contact BBO / or the organizers, they might know|pg||
pc|c7|nt|peachy: of course I do not know , but that seems a plausible explanation|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  One reason could bem that they are in front of the pack|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||

nt|jtr: Was it really 9?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgd: yes N discarded a @S on the @D7, not a club|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah ok|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3C|an|asks for 5card M|mb|p|mb|3D!|an|no 5card|mb|p|nt|brgpro: why ask for 5 card M? he is not happy with 4@h?|pg||
mb|3S!|an|asking for !Hs|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ronpa: now maybe south will pick the Q@D lead|pg||
nt|mich-b: maybe he thinks that bidding on the 3 level will prevent North from overcalling 2@S or 2@D on some hands|pg||
nt|brgpro: but isnt 2@c the same? |pg||
nt|brgpro: maybe it can be some other relays|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Puppet|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|brgpro: i know it is puppet...but i wonder why he doesnt use regular stayman|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ronpa: Now this is interesting hand|pg||
nt|jtr: To ask for 5M?  Guess they have other uses for 2@c|pg||
nt|brgpro: he still needs to overcome the @c break|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mich-b: he did not have a comfortable entry to dummy to play @C from there|pg||
nt|brgpro: if he tries a small @d S will surely jump in and knock out the @sA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h6|pc|c3|nt|jtr: South will be in trouble|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jtr: @h may have worked better|pg||
nt|brgpro: if E ducks this he will go down|pg||
nt|mich-b: what should declarer do now?|pg||
nt|brgpro: S can win @dJ and play a @s|pg||
nt|mich-b: if he ducks , defence can play a @S|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes  Duck and he gets a @s switch|pg||
nt|brgpro: then defense have 5 tricks. |pg||
nt|brgpro: E needs to win @dK and play on @c...S will be triple squeezed|pg||
nt|ronpa: He knows he will get a @S switch if he ducks this|pg||
nt|jtr: Would a @h have broken it up?|pg||
nt|ronpa: @H would break the squeeze but would create an endplay on south to lead @D from J9 at the end|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|brgpro: now i dont think he can make any more.|pg||
nt|brgpro: if he forgets about the @c then S wont have any trouble discarding but if he plays on @c then defense have 5 tricks|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s2|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jtr: running scores updated now http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/GBT_2011/11_06_03_team.html|pg||
nt|ronpa: south making sure his pard will return @S by playing @D9|pg||
nt|brgpro: @d9 strongly suggested strong holding in @s|pg||
nt|jtr: Best chance is to play @dK from hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: now it is midnight in china but the whole country is celebrating our first win in the French open|pg||

nt|sybarra: not sure how you would ever stay out of game on that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Is that strange?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Vladimir Machat|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and more action here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: can they stop in 5d|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: 3S?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: m,e nayther - nor this one but just look at that 5- break|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/GBT_2011/11_06_03_team.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: 4S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But the @S-singleton might be led, and that disturbs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ntmon: hi to everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@H= 0-3 HCP|pg||
nt|avivs:  superaccepting gets them too high|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If 15-17 - this is a very hard 3 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: it is 15-17|pg||
nt|avivs:  I don't like super accepting with very soft minimum values|pg||
nt|peachy: Lucky they do not play Texas then, it would relaly be too high\|pg||
nt|peachy: really|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You see the problem, poor North may bid 4 now|pg||
nt|peachy: I think not, not a single control anywhere|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4S?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and can defence play on H - good hand this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: West will look for 3NT first|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: an exellent 4 hts here, looking only at the e/w hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: well my c key seems to be reluctant today|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And what is lucky by that tactic, most spectatorÂ´s might learn a lot from the dutch standard!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not strange but a change is as good as a rest|pg||
pc|h2|nt|avivs:  he is thinking if he can go back to 2@h somehow... :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: at last|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT looks Ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: can he make this?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: hi|pg||
pc|h9|nt|avivs:  guess not|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, there we go|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Was the diner with red wine?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Anna|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS a married couple, playing Acol with weak NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have a spec that says yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzgf: :)|pg||
nt|avivs:  so far not very good judgment by N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Especially after, what happened at board 9, I would have settled for some normal bids here|pg||
nt|peachy: Depends on their superaccept structure.  Some folks just superaccept with 4 always, some with just max, etc.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C 10 = @S, partner|pg||
nt|avivs:  @cT just show 9|pg||
nt|avivs:  denies Jack|pg||
nt|peachy: Normally, third hand shows attitude, unless dummy/bidding/other clues make it unnecessary, in which case the second card is rither count or suit preference, depending on agreement|pg||
nt|peachy: the card (not second card)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: certainly is now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ianmcc: likely to make|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: can but wont i bet|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mind you i never like 3nt with a void when they have a 5-4 d fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know Huub plays the spots off the cards, but this may be a tall order even for him |pg||
nt|athene: now you would like to run the @C8 to guard against 4-1 break|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: (Huub=Bertens) |pg||
nt|athene: but you are a bit short of entries to dummy for that sort of luxury|pg||
nt|hawe45:  8 tricks now - but where there are 8, often we see 9|pg||
nt|athene: south will come under too much pressure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He allready is|pg||
nt|athene: if a defender has to guard three suits, it almost always spells doom|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|ianmcc: looks like 11 whatever|pg||

nt|sybarra: he changed horses and courses |pg||
nt|sybarra: much easier for us at the vantage point |pg||
nt|jcomyn: you really would be playing balcony finesses if you made this one|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the natural instinct is to cash 1 ht,  dont you John?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and perhaps the best play |pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: avoiding over ruff with singleton (whatever) |pg||
pc|d7|nt|avivs:  the english pair got to 3NT E/W on board 9|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: ok, this looks like the exception - declarer could have prevailed in several ways but no good now|pg||
pc|d8|mc|8|nt|athene: one possible play was just to play clubs without cashing any other winners|pg||
nt|athene: and really force south to find some discards|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 2nt?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: cards friendly for N/S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can make 3 but not likely to bid it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WHACK|pg||
nt|ianmcc: must X as he thought they could make 3NT|pg||
nt|rmb1: Defending avoids having to make 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: the @HK10 was a threat over south|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if they bid - and easily make - 3 NT here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcomyn: love to know how many 3NT bids there were today|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ntmon: no balancing here|pg||

nt|hawe45:  I would have liked to play 5 in a minor E/W here...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now they get 50|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good bidding by South|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double - stop the world, please (with that suit and that hand)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - doubled = no 50, but 100 and still a very bad score|pg||
nt|athene: three hearts, four clubs, two diamonds, two spades thanks to the @H8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double-dummy it works fine to take 4 x @C|pg||
nt|athene: the only way the defence can give declarer a problem in this sort of hand is hold up their winner in the red suit he attacks|pg||
nt|athene: and threaten to set up a long card there with the other red winner as entry|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|jcomyn: fryin pasn into the fire|pg||

nt|jcomyn: dont understand this - they know peanly is inevitable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: penalty|pg||
nt|rmb1: Does anyone know if 4@C was systemically the majors or just an improvisation?|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: north's double here tends to be t/o of hearts, but he feels it's ok with such a strong hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might end the bidding|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - brave man in South|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: x means 16+|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT looks OK|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he wants a bit more, vul against not|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ntmon: we could not the bidding at other table but similar proceedings expected as here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - but South still has the same hand...|pg||
nt|avivs:  I assume 1D would show unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|avivs:  2@c natural?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no good lead to 4@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: E will worry aboput H|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: i don't think south would bid 2@S facing just any random 16+ hand - he must feel it is roughly shape-suitable|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps he just thinks well, neither opp bid spades, partner must have 'em :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi santa|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: sorry all,  had to leave for a moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 1@C= at least 2|pg||
nt|avivs:  E/W stole the pot here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S obviously artificial|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@S= relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 3@D shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Basically have to pick up the @ss for no losers.|pg||
nt|athene: it will also ask if he has 3 trumps or 4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good to have East as declarer - a trump-lead could give problems - if from North|pg||
nt|athene: i would imagine|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzgf: south explained it at 16+|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no problem now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|sybarra: well with NT bid that should be easy?   (BTW hi Joe) |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H is quite pushy but westra-bertens have a fairly consistent policy to just bid everything in sight|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  This - normal - lead might help East to guess the @C-situation|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|santyclz: Not sure the nt bid requires the @s10.|pg||

pc|hK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  Must finesse...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NO|pg||
nt|athene: he has the  option of rising @SA and trying to make all six of his trumps separately|pg||
nt|athene: but you would think if the spades lay badly, but the crossruff worked, south would just return a trump|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i thinkhans is right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - but he ends in the wrong hand, if he tahes the Ace|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He has (maybe) the choice between J x x / Jack in South|pg||
pc|s7|nt|avivs:  other table also got to 4H although South did not super accept|pg||
pc|s6|nt|avivs:  on board 10...|pg||

nt|jcomyn: and another quiet s game|pg||

nt|ianmcc: 3NT again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: back in a mo derby is on|pg||
nt|santyclz: Panama.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But I would not like tp play that contract with a trump return from North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and asnother major game yawn yawn|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No loosing option in 4 @S - but E/W might bid a lot also|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks like an easy 3 NT here - to play, but to bid ?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Sorry folks, got to go, bye|pg||
nt|ianmcc: slam dodgy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so is life|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: difficult problem for west now - he doesn't want to hear 5@H from his partner, so double might not appeal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good practical bidding by South - with game E/W (also)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but as a passed hand partner is perhaps less likely to bid 5@H - if he pulls the double it will generally be with a 3- or 2-suiter, with 4NT, which would be fine|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@H= 5@S+4@H, 7-10 HCP|pg||
nt|hawe45:  620 - both tables|pg||
nt|athene: north was trying to set up overruffs for his partner but you have to be very sure of what you are doing, to return the suit declarer is playing|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hawe45:  Easy...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he presumably has some reason for playing clubs rather than trumps himself :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  650 maybe, if one takes the right option in the @D-suit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|avivs:  lucky 3NT|pg||
nt|avivs:  I would not want to be there looking just at the N/S hands|pg||
nt|avivs:  another push coming on board 11 with E/W in 4@s at other room|pg||
nt|avivs:  this is actually not cold|pg||
nt|avivs:  he will need to go after clubs (likely)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You must guess the @S and decide, which minor has H x by West|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This will cost 550 - if...|pg||
nt|athene: double is "action" - just takeout-ish, saying he has a good 4@S opener|pg||
nt|athene: north thinks he has a choice now: -500 or -550? :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seen from the North-seat, South shall bring three tricks in the side-suit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|santyclz: Well, almost 7-10 hcp,anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: but likes the shape |pg||
mb|p|nt|avivs:  better chances for Hx in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: if you decide that east has Hx in a minor you can start leading a small one from hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: Only 6 tables running, Roland must be slacking off...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: townsend expected a lot of shape for the 5-level overcall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Poor East - he liked his @S-singleton|pg||
nt|athene: he isn't sure if 6@D will make and he isn't sure if 5@S will|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats 3c?|pg||
nt|athene: well 3nt by south has the virtue of being cold on any lie|pg||
nt|athene: you cash the @SA and can guarantee to bring in the spades on either 4-0 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@D=5332 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: running scores http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/GBT_2011/11_06_03_team.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we are used to 14 or so |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: till now, every bid was alerted|pg||
nt|santyclz: To watch multiple tables:  www.bridgebase.com/mobile  Open 1 browser window/table.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcomyn: very prcise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This lead should "lead" to the overtrick, the @C-looser being eliminated|pg||
nt|athene: yes stick the @D9 in, draw trumps, then diamond towards the A82 gets you a club pitch|pg||
nt|athene: the 2@C response on a balanced hand is similar to the idea of opening 1@C on any balanced hand even with better diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: it makes it harder for opps if you don't announce your suits, and usually it does not harm your side if you have good methods|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jeroen van de Pol|pg||

nt|vugraphzgf: 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 3@D no 5 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 3@H = 5@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont see the point|pg||
nt|ianmcc: me neither transfer doesn't reveal West's hearts|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bernix: i just wondered what 2@h meant|pg||
nt|avivs:  the only clue he has is that East has 1 extra heart...|pg||
nt|athene: if he starts with the @DJ and east ducks smoothly he might play west for @DKQ and take another finesse|pg||
nt|avivs:  now will test spades|pg||
nt|avivs:  and when they break 3-3 will finesse West|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with 1NT-2H    2S-3D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If E/W lead 3th/5th - the 8 is the right play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzgf: W just asked|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He has only the winning line to play - |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  With a rather poor @D-suit, East might have expected mor high cards by partner|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too simple for experts i suppose|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think he'll trumps hearts to dummy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he can play it any aul way my granny will make this one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: granny would know about the black pictures|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think it says - lets impress the viewers with our esoteric system|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no point in learning all this stuff if you don't use it|pg||

pc|s4|nt|bernix: a likely push|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|athene: playing it this way means you see some discards before you have to make up your mind|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hawe45:  @D-decision now|pg||
nt|jpmbs: we can see Dutch Red are doing fine which is good news for them considering election for Dutch team.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: it's very hard not to pitch from your 5-card suit first|pg||
nt|peachy: Live eunning scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/GBT_2011/11_06_03_team.html|pg||
nt|athene: so when west lets a diamond go, declarer will surely play him for long diamonds|pg||
nt|avivs:  I will be very surprised if he discards another club|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a point but I have learned a lot of this stuff but only use it when necessary|pg||
nt|ianmcc: East in trouble|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: look at it this way,  "oly 50's" |pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|h5|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Oh - only 7 and 8 with results|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If they do not chance the style, they will make 980 here|pg||
nt|athene: i think on the bidding east would have led a trump, were it not for the fact that he has a singleton|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In Germany they say: SorgfÃ¤ltig gespielt...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: its start again at 7.30|pg||
nt|athene: just too likely to kill partner's promising holding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: more 3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But on a trump-lead, North plays the same way|pg||
nt|jcomyn: AND another one|pg||
nt|jpmbs: it looks like most brds might be a push. We need some exciting stuff. |pg||
mb|1C|nt|hawe45:  But Blackwood might keep them at the 5-level|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgf: 7.30 p.m. of course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Discilined NO-1 @S by West|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed|pg||
mb|1N|nt|avivs:  2@c must be artificial|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this dealing machine got stuck early today|pg||
mb|p|nt|bernix: 3@c would be reasonable|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  2 @C is just economy|pg||
nt|sybarra: grannies might make that hand experts may not |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: (the last hand)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hard to bgeat 3 but never in it|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @S - duck - more @S = 9th trick...|pg||
nt|athene: east will be warned off a spade lead when his partner can't raise, though?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: all kibitzers must be asleep by now|pg||
nt|athene: just too likely it is giving a trick, even with KQJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both are asleep|pg||
nt|athene: declarer very likely to have A1098 or so|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that a @H-shift will give problems|pg||
nt|jcomyn: probably right hans as they have all gone to play croquet or something equally exciting|pg||
nt|athene: this might get interesting|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can plod away at spades|pg||
nt|athene: trying to set up his fifth spade|pg||
nt|jpmbs: this might be a push also, I just do not see a 9th trick|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But the @H-SHIFT!!!|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that east might be able to get a heart AND a club|pg||
nt|athene: if you do let him in three times|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|bernix: must shift to clubs now to defeat 3@s|pg||
nt|ntmon: @C switch hardly possible after 3@C|pg||
nt|bernix: running scores at http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html|pg||
nt|bernix: sorry this is the link for last year's results. link not updated yet|pg||
nt|ntmon: will E work it out anyway?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: needs to get diamonds right|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bernix: he will have no 2nd chance |pg||
pc|c7|nt|ntmon: good!|pg||
nt|bernix: very well done, not easy to see|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: i have to say i would have overcalled 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: west has a plan|pg||
nt|athene: give his partner a club ruff|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: north will be wondering about the spade position - he might think west has a singleton honour|pg||
pc|hT|nt|avivs:  the way this session is going for them he should have bid this 25% slam...|pg||
nt|athene: surely east would lead a spade from KQJ10x|pg||
nt|athene: even KQJ10|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: in textbookland when opps bid and raise clubs, and you have four, you know you can give partner a second-round ruff|pg||
nt|avivs:  50% that the @sK is one of the missing KCs and not off 2 aces and 50% that its on side|pg||
nt|athene: sadly in the real world, things don't work out so well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just the 2|pg||
nt|jpmbs: Westra attacking the entry for the C's|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ianmcc: @h9 now damaging|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess they like to have a real suit at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|jcomyn: run DQ|pg||
nt|athene: he shld have jumped in with the @CK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ntmon: looks like well deserved 5 IMPs for Netherlands |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: now easy to use @DQ, @HK to set up the clubs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  I hate to admit it, but I agree with them|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: Bakhshi thinks that the lead was a singleton so taking the trump finesse is more likely to run into a club ruff, i guess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Are the players still at the table?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|avivs:  a very knwledgeable person informed me that North knew it's on the finesse since 3NT showed bad trumps...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: it OT decision |pg||

mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  This person should have told N/S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another boring game|pg||
nt|sybarra: can the e/w here duplicate this board?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jpmbs: the 1S overcall helped him not to try for spades and later he did not go up with KofC|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: yes of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 4@S "routine"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Heart lead in OR - and allthough East ducked the first @C - 12 tricks|pg||
nt|avivs:  he chose not to risk a slam on finesse plus trumps might break poorly even when K is onside|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E must already be thinking slam |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  6 @D depending on the @C.suit|pg||
nt|athene: i don't like south's bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: you have two aces and FOUR (yes, that was four) card support for partner's first bid suit|pg||
nt|athene: and he has made a jump shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2NT= minors|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ntmon: 2@D art GF|pg||
nt|jcomyn: obviously so why did s take so long to bid 3c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must have no homes to go to|pg||
nt|jpmbs: bad luck here|pg||
nt|athene: well, bad luck in a sense - it's a pretty thin game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @S looks comfortable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but the cards are perfectly placed for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: sure, the spade ruffs are unfortunate, but on the other hand the red suits could lie much worse, so you can't really complain when you go down|pg||
nt|jpmbs: agree, if 2H is semi-positive, bit unlucky all HCP in D's|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but he wont go down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even 3 NT is a winner|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He will be down in 38 seconds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Counted from the moment, when South starts playing|pg||
nt|jpmbs: Thk he will go down, other table might start with 1H 1S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats if he ever decides to play|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A good point is: The later South starts playing, the later he goes down...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: now need to watch all the forcing bids, etc,  (personally I would be worried about bidding just 2 @S)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many people would consider this an invitation sequence, obviously they don't|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: it's not as though David Gold was well-known for throwing tricks away as declarer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is no better, why not 3 @D - wait and see|pg||
nt|jcomyn: theres nothing to think about here surely|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @sK then @d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: give up h c d and claim but he wont|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he paid his entry fee|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a real threat|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: wha tha|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told,  2 spades is asking  min  or max|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzgf: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@H= doubleton|pg||
nt|peachy: Particularly, as I think he is aware  yhay the 3NT was a pickup|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hard for west to have more.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an then 5nt is?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no idea |pg||
nt|santyclz: Spec asks if 2@s asked min/max, what did 5nt ask?|pg||
nt|sybarra: how does pard know whether to bid 6 or 7?|pg||
nt|santyclz: A maximum maximum?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or choice of slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: like "its ok if you pick a minor"|pg||
nt|santyclz: Specs are suggesting it was "pick a slam except @hs".|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont like that system|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the one that made me laugh was "transfer to 6 nt" |pg||
nt|santyclz: So if w were, for example, 2452...|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably not easy to show shortness in pard's major|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what to do you do?|pg||
nt|santyclz: They have a pretty decent record for a poor system.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i am a simple soul 4NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: you have a 16 count opposite a 1 nt opener |pg||
nt|jcomyn: I only said i didnt like it|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you bid 4?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: townsend knows the cards lie badly - his minor-suit honours are likely over strength in west's hand|pg||
nt|avivs:  very unlucky for him to catch east with @d void|pg||
nt|athene: and his partner hopefully has hearts over east|pg||
nt|athene: plus there is the trump break :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right play - not awarded|pg||

pc|sK|pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||

nt|jcomyn: surely this is ridiculously slow|pg||
nt|ianmcc: there's always solitaire|pg||
nt|jpmbs: 100 a piece|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: but he might lose just a club and two hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Duck 1 @H and play @C rto the 10, then...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we cdould hold a little competition with each round playewd during the pauses|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|hawe45:  He heard me|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Safe now, giving away 2 @C-tricks at most|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Come on - Denmark is playing Iceland (Foot) to night...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and ireland pl;ay macedonia|pg||
nt|athene: south decided the only way he was going to make is if west had the @DA and not the @HA and only two or three trumps|pg||
nt|jpmbs: Brasil Netherlands also|pg||
nt|athene: then even if west gets a spade ruff there might just be the ruff and the red aces for the defence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now @D to the @H Ace - and @S back|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. diamond to the king holds, then a trump towards the king|pg||
nt|jcomyn: these are not football fans or they would play faster|pg||
nt|athene: now if east rises with @HA and gives his partner a ruff, the @HQ will be dropping|pg||
nt|jpmbs: :-)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  No it comes...!|pg||

nt|ianmcc: @s pointless|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this must surely be a record for the longest time to play in a stone cold part score|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|hA|nt|avivs:  North could have set them with a trump return when in with @cK|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but it's vul|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: but i think you probably need west to have only two trumps on this line, or the @DQ as well, as he could underlead his @DA for another ruff perhaps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: praying for clubs to come down |pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: director is here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: spade length was already advertised so that is declarer's line|pg||
nt|athene: no, trump back didn't beat|pg||

pc|dK|nt|athene: with a hole in one of the majors|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|ntmon: 5@S asking for good trumps|pg||
nt|ntmon: the answer is yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If North plays later on @S to the King, West shall duck smoothly...!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that would be nice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: e had enough of the nonsense|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzgf: so bye for now|pg||
nt|bernix: bye all|pg||
nt|ntmon: bye all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: why lose patience?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: vul v not i suppose|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: nad pard didnt get it |pg||
nt|sybarra: *and |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|athene: but would east really make a weak jump oevrcall with six solid AND @SA?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and now netherlands win|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this hand shows that this 4-4 fit things is grossly exaggerated|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the late great Monty Rosenberg alwsays said 4-4 fits are for babies|pg||
nt|athene: a lot of the time west has a doubleton in a major of course, which improves the chances|pg||
mc|12|nt|hawe45:  The rule for West: Never take a trick, without having a good reason to do it|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer knows east had 1-6 in the red suits|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a dream come true in the spade suit, needs to guess (no guess really) ace and then hope for J10 tight or A doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: he knows that of course if east has a small singleton spade a spade switch at trick 3 would have beaten the contract|pg||
nt|avivs:  Thanks to Bill, Raija  and hans and also to Anna our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: but that doesn't mean you should definitely not play for that because it's not so clearcut for east to shift to the spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: bye for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: thanks all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: next match in about 15 min|pg||
