nt|athene: south didn't know his partner had five clubs of course so the club return looked safer than opening up a red suit|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|athene: maybe north would have been better off if he HAD "misguessed" and put in the @C9 at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: then declarer would have two club tricks but not the entry as well :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: i guess n/s don't play support doubles :)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess that hand was a tale of two nines for north, both giving him problems|pg||
nt|athene: if double is penalty, north has an easy pass, but more likely it's just showing a good hand, so he is stuck|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: lall thinking|pg||
