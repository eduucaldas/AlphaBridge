mb|p|mb|1C|nt|iceking: 1-2-6-4 more likely then 1-1-6-5 i think |pg||
nt|jcomyn: how did closed room get into that mess i wonder|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Absolutely not everybodyÂ´s style, this 1 @H|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hi all welcome back round 3 england vs Holland|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!Ds|nt|kdr_fm: that last hand was badly played. east had shown up with 1 heart and if had 1 spade that would have been 5C and 6D and said nothing ?|pg||
nt|athene: we saw him pass a better hand than that earlier rather than make a 1-level overcall - but he was vulnerable that time|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Hi Hans - William - Karel and specs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|kdr_fm: I sense 3nt inc|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|irwinbo: the balancing 1 nt usually is 11 to 14  east has really pushed imho|pg||
nt|iceking: agree its not likely Gold would just pass forever with that holding, i though dont really understand why east didnt bid 3@D on second round of bidding|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hi|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi all|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: wow - with a rock solid H stop didnt even try|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: this hasnt much chance|pg||
nt|iceking: win in dummy and lead @S might work|pg||
nt|athene: they might have got there uncontested - in which case south's "bad" overcall worked out nicely|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Absolutely|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kdr_fm: this is beatable - 8 top tricks but club wrong and opps have a diamond tempo ... is the issue of unblocking spade though|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: he talked opps out of a vul 3NT earlier by responding to 1@C on a very weak hand|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - 1 @H was for the lead...|pg||
nt|athene: bidding simply makes life harder for opps in all sorts of ways|pg||
pc|dA|nt|iceking: no def now always makes|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kdr_fm: very hard to see at trick 2 - well done declarer|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|iceking: yes was well done|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: be very tempted to hook the C now though|pg||
nt|iceking: no he knows @C are offside |pg||
nt|jcomyn: its not well done yet|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ahh yes missed the opening bid|pg||
nt|iceking: N opened the bidding he knows alot |pg||
nt|iceking: also if NS methods are rather normal N cant have 4@D|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: kibitz saying a thrown in possible ... clear the red suits exit spade ... looks like that will work|pg||
nt|iceking: still even it looks easy for us, its alot harder at the table find play and read the table this well, so very well done|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well it was well done but again seems odd for declarer to lead a spade and duck the T.  If you sit back and think about it (gven west is unlikely to have 5S - no 1S overcall) ... ...|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: its very odd|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doesnt seem as easy to declarer as you fellas think it is|pg||

mb|2C|nt|athene: i guess you show black suits if you can|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise i prefer to bid clubs|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|hawe45:  If he could, he would have done it long time ago|pg||
nt|viren169: or 2-suiter|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - 1 @S was a joke...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: I'm sure they have some sort of Ghestem in their kit-bag|pg||
nt|athene: extreme two-suiters rarely play well in notrumps but i suppose he has decided he just has a club one-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: well, 4@S was not making either :)|pg||
nt|viren169: now does a dble ask for a heart or a diamond?|pg||
nt|athene: it's sensible to play 2nt as forcing facing a 2-level overcall|pg||
nt|athene: a style i think kokish was the first to really espouse|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Depends on, what 2 @H was|pg||
nt|athene: if you assume a 2-level overcall has a six card suit then 2nt might as well be forcing opposite it as you never want to play in exactly 2nt|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@H looks like a fit-non jump|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe 2nt would have been something other than natural for NS|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: 2@H maybe just non-forcing|pg||
nt|viren169: not good!|pg||
nt|athene: if it was fit-showing he wouldn't feel obliged to jump to 5@D now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: i thought it was double or 4D = never considerd 5 .. :>|pg||
nt|athene: north obviously thinks his pass is forcing|pg||
nt|viren169: probably need 6 card suit for a nf 2@H|pg||
mb|5S|nt|iceking: 4@H in closed room was agressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: N has no control no shape its hard to picture 15-17nt were game is good|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
nt|viren169: oh dear...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange bridge - you have 2 Aces and partner has over-called red against blach... - and no double|pg||
mb|6C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: thats crazy|pg||
nt|viren169: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|irwinbo: is ther a new rule in bridge that you have to bid game on every hand?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This even more strange|pg||
nt|athene: one possibility is that townsend thinks they play pass/double inversion there|pg||
nt|viren169: -800 when you were going plus is not good!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S King -- come on|pg||
nt|athene: so pass was asking partner to double|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: geeze i dont know but generally i like to bid my hand once.  Just amazing how sometimes bridge is more akin to russian roulette|pg||
nt|athene: but i think more likely townsend just felt he did not have a lot of defence *given he already bid 3nt*|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find best defense... but still -500|pg||
nt|athene: but on the other hand, it's hard to see how you could ever want to bid higher than 5@D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|viren169: I suspect this bidding seq wont be matched at the other table.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont like this xx AKx AKJxx Qxx even super max hand like this dosnt make game on|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: beginnin to look like it - the we didnt come here to defend brigade|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: surely N's pass of 5D is not forcing ?  Neither side has established ownership ?|pg||
nt|athene: well he has bid a vul game sort of off strength|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe that is the root cause of the problem|pg||
nt|athene: north felt his pass was NOT forcing - and south was welcome to pass or double, as he saw fit|pg||
pc|hK|nt|viren169: Red vs White it should be played as forcing pass|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kdr_fm: I can somewhat understand N's logic.  If you assume each opps has 4S, pd has 2 and odds are points in the minors ... vul game and all that ...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: but south felt the pass WAS forcing and was inviting him to bid on|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d7|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|viren169: I would expect Tom to dble with 2 aces|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|viren169: unless dble showed something else|pg||
nt|athene: i see this problem arise quite often - if you pass is that saying "i am not doubling because we might be able to make something higher here" or just "i am not doubling because i am ...|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i can beat it!"|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite a subtle distinction and just saying "ok we set up a forcing pass" doesn't really solve it |pg||

nt|kdr_fm: i dont think so in this auction.  3NT could easily and clearly is once W bids 5D based on the basis of running clubs and some outside stops. |pg||
nt|athene: well personally i would probably double 5@D with the north hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close to slam here - but close only|pg||
nt|athene: and if it makes, it makes|pg||
nt|athene: but you can see Townsend was worried west had a club void - no-one forced him to bid FIVE diamonds - he could have just bid 4 if he wanted to sac over 3nt|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|iceking: pd only bid 2@H so usually doesnt have 4@H |pg||
mb|3C|nt|hawe45:  HELP - if thatÂ´s a weak-2|pg||
nt|viren169: That's a filthy weak 2@H|pg||

mb|4N|nt|jcomyn: how many times we see this mioor hand - too many spades|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mirror hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: 19hcp with very good 5card suit dont see the point opening 1@S|pg||

nt|viren169: ouch!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  12 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|iceking: just a wrong hand valuation i think|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|iceking: decl might as well just claim this one down, there is no hope|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT - 1 on a club or a heart lead.  Makes though on a D lead.  But once west bleeps they will end in 4S|pg||
nt|athene: townsend thinks his partner probably has a singleton diamond on the bidding|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a good start for England here|pg||
nt|athene: so that's twice we have seen someone infer shortage in his partner's hand this evening....doing that rarely pays these days|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: poor double imo - especially if your style is to overcall and open on total dross - you cant rely on pd for a single trick|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't it lovly when people open with garb multi?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 2ndly E/W have been around a long long time ... i cant imagine they are kidding about :>|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can claim, what are we sitting here for?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange lead, West having showed minorS|pg||
nt|athene: he can't claim - he doesn't know if there is a diamond ruff coming|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Listen, if there were a @D-ruff, they had taken it long time ago|pg||
nt|athene: townsend thought that west had 4 diamonds for 4NT and east ought to have 3 for his double|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: which is maybe why he doubled .... he trusted the opps bidding and assumed they had 7 diamonds between them|pg||
nt|athene: so @DA, diamond ruff, spade to ace, diamond ruff, tasty :)|pg||

nt|athene: making this will cheer NS up a bit|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: ok the main issue will be, when he leads a diamond towards his hand, west will rise ace and play some sort of spade|pg||
nt|viren169: needs to play a diamond now and hope for the hearts later!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|athene: yes he is thinking whether he needs to do that to avoid squeezing his hand|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: but he can afford @C @C @D|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: anyway his issue on the spade will be whether to duck twice and try to block them or whether to rise king|pg||
nt|athene: west is a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: so if he knows west has @DA @CJ @SQ he can't really have @SA the way people open these days|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not know about the @SQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  @D Ace with West = @S Ace with East|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: but then, if east has @SQJ the suit might block anyway - it's all very tangled|pg||
pc|h8|nt|viren169: Whenever I try it I usually go 5 off!|pg||
nt|athene: westra is wondering whether to bare his @DA which will of course resolve any guess for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: or whether to keep the @D9 and duck a diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: but when the @DK holds declarer is not likely to play for east to have ducked it|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: east should have pitched the DJ telling partner spades back and dont play me for CA ..|pg||
nt|viren169: K of clubs make it clear!|pg||
nt|athene: yes, pitch the @DJ is a good way to say, don't try to give him a diamond guess|pg||
nt|athene: that's a well-known textbook sort of theme, usually when you have Qxx over KJ10 and you don't want pd to duck his ace to give a guess|pg||

nt|athene: eeeek|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|viren169: oh dear...|pg||

nt|athene: part of south's problem here is that he is in the "pre-balancing" seat|pg||
