nt|Vugraphzfk: welcome all|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Your commentator is Mike Kamil|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Operator is Stan|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk6: also welc back to Michael Rosenberg|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mikam1: Note the 2@D rebid...leaving room and making for a smooth auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Joe Stokes is operating now, sry|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Now playing for the Joel team, one of the premier pairs in the world...Jill Levin, Jill Meyers|pg||
nt|mikam1: Levin, with all values in the pointed suits, chose 3N...unclear|pg||
nt|scotty: Not sure I understand 3N versus 4@H - but probably will be fine|pg||
pc|s3|nt|scotty: South knows spades are well held by E - but a spade lead doesn't give much away|pg||
nt|mikam1: Note the word "probably"|pg||
nt|mikam1: in Michael's analysis|pg||
nt|scotty: I use that a lot - when I make a definitive statement, I prefer it be accurate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Levin thinking|pg||
nt|mikam1: This hand is VERY difficult to play (and analyze)|pg||
nt|scotty: Most natural looks to win the spade in hand and lead a @c to the J|pg||
nt|mikam1: and when that wins....continue clubs?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|scotty: IF it wins|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mikam1: this won't hurt declarer|pg||
nt|mikam1: but a natural play by South|pg||
nt|scotty: East thinks declarer has a doubleton heart - so that is a natural shift|pg||
nt|mikam1: she didn't expect 3 hearts with declaree|pg||
nt|mikam1: declarer|pg||

mb|2D!|an|hearrts|mb|p|nt|scotty: S rebids 2@c - hoping to help partner with a later decision.  If 2@c gets passed, that is not necessarily bad|pg||
nt|scotty: 2@d shows hearts, probably|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mikam1: However, playing Bart, North has a headache|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Funny part is that this hand is best played in diamonds|pg||
nt|scotty: Difficult to diagnose the perfect fit....|pg||
nt|mikam1: the only suit never really mentioned|pg||
pc|hK|nt|scotty: Without the convention, N would bid 2D, and S would feel far more bullish|pg||

nt|hackenbush: perhaps an upgrade|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: some number of @H likely but 4 could be tricky.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: but West is 2N opener regardless of  how Walter the Walrus counts points|pg||

nt|daman: we are starting with Board 5     we missed the first 4 boards    will catch up with them later|pg||

nt|andyv:  both rooms should get to 4@h..only question is whether EW will take the 5@d push|pg||
nt|othered1: more like will west solo to 5@D, since east doesn't have much positive  to say with those tricks in defense|pg||

pc|c4|nt|othered1: So do I|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: What a great decision by Meyers|pg||
mb|d|nt|swanson: This should not be a forcing pass situation.  West has a very limited hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: That is, the pass by West was not inviting East to bid on.|pg||

nt|mikam1: ok - be right back|pg||
nt|swanson: On the previous deal, East opened 2@S, not 1@S and South elected to pass, which ended the auction.|pg||
nt|swanson: In case I appear to be biased in my analysis on some hand, note that Jill Meyers is my sister-in-law.|pg||
nt|mikam1: West did well to balance with double, however she might have been better bidding 4@S...must be spades and another|pg||
nt|swanson: I had little to do with her bridge education however - it came mostly from Ed Davis.|pg||
nt|swanson: I don't endorse the "two-suited" balance with much enthusiasm.  Sometimes the defensive strength doesn't justify immediate action.|pg||
nt|mikam1: So you might hold say, Kxxxxx --- Qxxx Jxx or somesuch ?|pg||
nt|swanson: It is a tricky situation to judge.  (But I would have bid 4@S if I was backing in with those cards.)|pg||
nt|swanson: Myabe Jxxxxxx, -, Kxxx, xx?|pg||
nt|swanson: Maybe|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes - tough hand.  I see....that example makes sense|pg||
nt|mikam1: Well, in any case...as far as the match goes, it was great timing for the Joel team|pg||
nt|mikam1: They hadn't scored much...felt a bit flat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: ok, back now|pg||
nt|swanson: The problem with a double on the West hand (delayed) is that parter will seldom, if ever, pull to a 3-card spade suit.|pg||

mb|p|nt|hackenbush: Will Moss open in 3rd?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: i'm a bit surprised he opened 1nt - not because of the 5422 but just because it's a bit good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but reliable source tells me  "dbl was 13-15 or 19-plus bal but not essential with that hand opposite a ph"|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: hamman sticks to his convictions|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@H far from obligatory|pg||

nt|athene: having given up control in trumps, north has to be a bit worried about declarer running the spades|pg||

nt|barnets: that loses here|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Lots of alert explanations|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force   jump to 3N should show 1N strength [but some flaw for 1N open]|pg||
nt|hackenbush: and we have our answer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would be less or more than 1N opening strength|pg||
pc|h4|nt|barnets: same bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: next board is promising as well|pg||
nt|barnets: now it went all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was probably a close call for Joel|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: maybe Passell was playing his partner for the @SK rather than a minor-suit king|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N says they never bypass 4-card majors in responding to 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: but Hamman would more likely be aggressive with both major kings|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: and if south does have the @SK then @DA and @DQ is sure to beat the contract even if it gives hamman his @DK - they will get the @CAQ when south gets in|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|barnets: and so it goes|pg||
pc|hT|nt|barnets: personally i think if north shows a club suit|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|barnets: in the other room 1N was clearly alerted to show clubs?|pg||
nt|barnets: can you say if it was clearly alerted here ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pause = negotiating claim|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hackenbush: if East had played back a low heart, inserting @h9 is indicated from restricted choice, besides the fact that East might've tried @hK or spade from @hKQ|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 5 & 6 imp swings also add up quickly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: definitely|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: looks innocuous, but is enormous|pg||
nt|barnets: of course north had not guaranteed 5 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: so the whole situation is wooly to say the least|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems she should have gotten that right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just don't ask me why|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|athene: declarer is going to go for a club ruff|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now needs exact @S layout  and that will mean Radin holds @CQ  else she would have opened 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is just for down 1|pg||
nt|hackenbush: unfortunately can't get to hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right  needed @HK as entry|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|andyv:  one of the key facets in defense is to try not to break new suits for declarer hence Bob's return of a @s|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finally getting some real help from opp|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|andyv:  the tough part is now|pg||
nt|andyv:  best seems AK @h and ruff @c|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's only worry now is holding the trump losers to one|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you ruff a diamond now|pg||
nt|athene: you know west has the king still so that isn't getting overruffed|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @d ruff, E pitches @c|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but you might still be able to combine chances in trumps|pg||
nt|athene: with some trump coup possibilities|pg||
nt|andyv:  so basically the same thing but ruff 1@d first then AK@h?  that works too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: she will take the money and run    no finesses|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: does doubleton trump Q help here?     @C finesse, @SA @SK   nope doesn't help|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's main problem here is he wants to take the trump finesse if east has four trumps|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mikam1: 1N overcall and double?|pg||
nt|mikam1: nope|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|mikam1: in any case, Meyers will compete to 3@C|pg||
nt|mikam1: Or South may bid 3@S now|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mikam1: which she did|pg||
nt|swanson: It would be useful to bid clubs naturally (by West) after the 1NT overcall, but most everyone (all?) use it as an artificial bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Meyers must be wondering where all this bidding is coming from|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what just happened?    i blinked|pg||
nt|hackenbush: could've been down more, don't think that @cA was going away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh she really did fly @CA|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: Rose quickly with club A|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yuk|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: there might be a more technical term|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what will Moss do over 1N overcall?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: soooo....|pg||
nt|ritong: is that one mundane?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: the idea of ruffing some diamonds was that you might then be able to cash the @HAK and even if west showed out you would not necessarily be dead|pg||
nt|athene: as you might have a trump coup against east|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hand|pg||
nt|daman: NS will end up in another lazy 4@H contract|pg||
nt|hackenbush: well Valerie Westheimer in the BBO Junior club calls that the flying ace syndrome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C by many would be artificial  [example: same bid as if RHO opened 1N]  so PASS/DBL/3@C were her options|pg||
nt|hackenbush: most play double as negative here over 3@c|pg||
nt|hackenbush: but might be scary if partner passes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and with the lack of values  negative would definitely apply|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: well|pg||
nt|daman: now they satnd to gain an IMP or 2|pg||
nt|daman: stand*|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good 3@C bid|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: no board passes out any more, even if two players pass 11 counts in 1 and 2 pos, a rarity in some circles |pg||
nt|ahollan1: stopped NS from finding @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: sutherlin knows everyone has about a ten count|pg||
nt|athene: bramley has to be dead min to pass 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and it makes!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|daman: oh my|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: i would bid 2@C on the south hand i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  usually, responder shouldn't have more points than opener:)|pg||
nt|athene: you just don't get rich letting opps play in 1 of things|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: Radin using her entries to lead up to dummy's kings|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|barnets: now on that lead e/w can hold dec to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|othered1: One possible imp pick up here to Deutsch . . . |pg||

pc|c4|nt|barnets: which could be a very vital imp|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|othered1: You have a twice-passed partner and little defense . . . |pg||

nt|ahollan1: may just be push or win 4 but still  beating par is always nice|pg||

mb|2D|nt|barnets: and there will be extra boards|pg||
nt|barnets: if the scoring is corect|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: for future matches     http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php     bookmark it|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Quite a 2@S bid in OR.  Do they play it 2-suited by definition?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, good point barnet|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: in other room west opened 2@S|pg||
nt|daman: sorry folks    we have 16 board quarters    I thought 15   like yesterday    one more after this|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|daman: 3NT from the Nprth hand is the best spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: on the rule of 11, north has one club higher than the six|pg||
nt|athene: if it's the king or jack you want to play low in dummy; if it's the 9 or 8 you want to stick in the ten|pg||
nt|othered1: Deutsch has gotten into the lead on the basis of that potential slam on board 42, where they found 6@D in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: assuming you can get south on lead next|pg||
nt|andyv:  so odds about 2-1 in favor of 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  as most don't lead away from Jacks|pg||
nt|athene: isn't it exactly 50-50?|pg||
nt|barnets: and this made it more difficult for /s|pg||
nt|daman: North*|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: n/s|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|barnets: a good tactical bid|pg||
nt|hackenbush: tempting to pass with West but priority still goes to bidding your own contract first|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: well, he sort of wants to be in dummy to finesse spades|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hackenbush: with 3 defensive tricks, and a fairly offensive hand, both @d and @s might be making|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: in other match  with 4 to score in the set  Sprung leads Westheimer by 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after long dinner break   30 more boards to complete the USA1 semi-final matches|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winners advance to USA1 Final   losers got to USA2 bracket|pg||
nt|hackenbush: good lead, holding values in both unbid suits|pg||
pc|s6|nt|barnets: and then found a good opening lead V 3n|pg||
nt|barnets: the @D J|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: so maybe this is reasonable|pg||
nt|barnets: so good play by passel to put pressure on n/s|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember, the score shown here is not official.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: south could have taken out 3N but left it in|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: if you played low and north did turn up with a big card, then your natural play would be a diamond, which might allow north to put a club through anyway|pg||
nt|barnets: the def must cash another diamond now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 11 or 12 do not change imp|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|barnets: thats a tie|pg||
nt|hackenbush: still making, as NS can't get in to lead trumps again|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  Deutsch has gone ahead by bidding the slam on board 42|pg||
nt|athene: bramley can make 11 but only if he finesses the spade, i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  so with 17 boards to go, this promises to be a very match|pg||
nt|athene: he might have enough of a count to do that|pg||
nt|andyv:  exciting that is:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Seniors   Milner leads Lynch by 23     Schwartz over O'Rourke by 32|pg||

pc|c6|pc|sA|pc|d5|pg||

pc|s5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|andyv:  bye everyone for now|pg||

mb|d|mb|2C|nt|daman: and here we are|pg||
nt|hackenbush: so favorable 3@c = bad hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable = random hand  but 2nd seat ??|pg||
