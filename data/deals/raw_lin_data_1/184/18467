mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jcwla: E will commence with 1@H, W will bid 1@S, E will likely rebid 2@C (maybe 1NT), and they'll end in either 3NT or 4@S.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: It's not the most beautiful layout ever encountered.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: a quiet start|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: Hmm...|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lml: they play smith so the @S may suggest a switch |pg||
nt|lml: @S8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcwla: 2@D sets up the game force, now with @D stopped E rebids 2NT and now W shows the good @S suit, and E elects 3NT.|pg||
nt|kemperg: but @H is the right defense|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|lml: yes but that is not completely clear to Fisher|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psyck: this should now come home with 5@s, 2@d, 2@c in due course of time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Much friendlier to receive a @C lead into E in 3NT than from N through E in 4@S.  They had a really nice auction.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d3|pc|s5|pg||

nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|psyck: apparently they only need 13 cards to respond at this vul|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the modern game it is just detested to pass pd's opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: support double likely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks for me easier than 4@s|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psyck: redouble that is|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now how do you feel about making the support redouble vs. bidding the 2NT (with the possibility of finding out about @H's later)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: xx better|pg||
nt|lml: 3@D seems reasonable but they will end up in notrump about now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcwla: What's the rationale?|pg||
nt|psyck: you can always bid NT to show your values later|pg||
nt|psyck: this gives more room for more options|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: the only problem on this board is to avoid a @s slam|pg||

nt|lml: here 1@H is mostly for the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: i'm not a bid fan of jumping with 4 cards and bal hands|pg||
nt|jcwla: E will open 1NT with a max, W will invite and they will settle comfortably in 3NT that depends on the lead.|pg||
nt|lml: In the Open Room Wolff opened Clerkin's hand 2@H.  What do you think of that?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|kemperg: better than 1@H|pg||

nt|lml: the opponents|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: would you open 1N or 1@d here?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: some players makes a false cue in @h on a hand like W|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|jcwla: This is 9 with some downgrades.  As long as your style is to accept invites with anything but a dead min (as it should be), an invite is plenty in my book.|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case S does not find the magic @S lead and score it up.|pg||

nt|lml: I think the @d7 was showing spade values.  Lets see if Clerkin agrees|pg||
nt|007 joosth: thats the danger of a weak 2  with good values outside the suit.   the down-lead will be difficult to find|pg||
nt|007 joosth: its 10 or 11 tr now|pg||

nt|007 joosth: sorry  always 10  I should learn counting better|pg||
