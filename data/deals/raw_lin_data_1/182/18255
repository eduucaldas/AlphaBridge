mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|pef: takes a heart lead or diamond and heart return to beat 4s here|pg||
nt|stevo:  this will get a club lead but Wooldridge has no chance to guess it right(unless the lead is the club king)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Sorry . This computer does strange things when I try to chat without hitting chat|pg||
nt|pef: will fred bid 4h now to make sure he gets a heart lead?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|pef: boy that was conservative|pg||
nt|santyclz: So last round's e-w became n-s.  I guess that means they improved their standing 1 position.|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  wow Wooldridge  went way low shocking on his hand|pg||
nt|pef: steve or henry, would you bid only 3s there?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: ok, I see you call it shocking|pg||
nt|stevo:  i would bid 4 for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Oh cool now i can chat . thanks andy|pg||
nt|henryb:  I probably would have bid 4@s a round before|pg||
pc|h6|nt|santyclz: Very close to 6@h, if you're in it you'll make it, because @ds are 2-2.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://www.bridge.ee/festival/teams11.htm for current standing|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: maybe it's better to duck the opening lead - otherwise North may gain an entry with his hypothetical @D10 later|pg||

nt|pef: in the closed room, slam tries are being made :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brad agrees . Shaking his head in mock disgust Stevo. As he works out the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Perfect "midnight-swiss" weak 2...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  sooner or later, defence has to help declarer with collecting 6 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|pef: through a transfer after overcall auction, 4 spades is being played from the short side, so south didn't have|pg||
nt|pef: much of a problem leading the ak of hearts and the ace of diamonds |pg||
nt|stevo:  here declare doesnt know its a stiff and might go down |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: asks about leads told 3/low|pg||
nt|pef: so a 6 imp gain, that seems undeserved|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this start is less helpful than any other|pg||
pc|h5|nt|stevo:  the 2@h opener wrong sided this|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pef: now a diamond ruff and a club back beats this|pg||
nt|pef: while we are waiting, time to thank my fellow commentators Steve and Henry (and the others who have|pg||
nt|pef: presumably gone to sleep :)  as well as Barry our vugraph operator and sideline reporter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: One more board after this folks . Thanks for watching . We will have 60 more boards tomorrow starting at 10 local time . That is 13.5 hours from now|pg||
nt|pef: also bbo and usbf for making this possible|pg||
nt|stevo:  Fred doesnt know its a stiff but with that dummy looks bleak if its not|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are (probably) still going to finish on Monday EDT|pg||
nt|pef: turned into an optimist, Henry?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: usbc is the United States Bridge Championships|pg||
nt|henryb:  I said probably, Peter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: reaching for the 3@cs|pg||
nt|pef: and of course thanks for the nearly 1600 spectators all riveted to their seats|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh my...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  pre-empt done its work|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pef: oops|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and that opens the way to 7 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|blum1956: interesting double by North... Was it in response? Or did it suggest penalty?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pef: now wooldridges turn, we can all see just play a trump, but why he is he thinking|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  6nt looks reasonable|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  one more time for helping hand?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzdu: they didnt say|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|blum1956: I suppose South took it for penalty otherwise he probably should have studied the possible 6@d contract|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c2|nt|blum1956: which is on the table|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting position - I wonder, what will be the next move of declarer|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|pef: as specs point out, fred's play is only right if wooldridge had exactly axxxxx of hearts and two diamonds|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess the double just meant 6-7 points|pg||
pc|s8|nt|santyclz: It's close, only 11 easy tricks but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: 7@d was uncalled for|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with @h void, S should expect @h points in partner's hand|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psridhar: trouble now|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: if NS start doubling|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: probably his partner took 3@S from passout seat a bit more seriously than it was meant to be|pg||
nt|psridhar: still a handy 6 or 7 imps to Vilnius on the @d lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|zyxzewski: well, CR made 10 tricks|pg||

nt|pef: yes, that's right|pg||
nt|santyclz: The good news for the 7@d bid was that 7@c was already overboard.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: indeed|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|Vugraphzff: for sure|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|pef: and indeed it was a push because played from the east side after a transfer auction so no dangerous diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: if pass by wooldridge wasn't forcing, brad would have a real problem what to bid, here he can wait |pg||
mb|2C|nt|stevo:  i think will go xx p p now 2h by brad|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: but will east redouble of bid 2d?|pg||
nt|stevo:  ha|pg||
nt|pef: got you |pg||
nt|stevo:  Hurd has seen Joel's pass of XX too many times not going there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred asking about 2@d and also about the original pass . Shown the rdbl card |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: gets a note about the rest|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pef: yes, I once won a match against a very good team (Chip was on it) because one of his teammates decided to add an extra digit to the score in such a situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: how do we get to 3@cs from here?|pg||
nt|pef: that seems a bit pushy by fred with such bad diamond spots|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Isn't 2N Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|pef: barnet shenkin just told me he thought 5c was cold here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: this si not your typical auction|pg||
nt|stevo:  this is getting dangerous for N/S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pef: although it would take some magic to get there|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pef: time to lead partner's suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred shaking his head |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: not sure at what|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge nervous 1Nt was a 3rd seat favorable psyche|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Woolridge whispered something|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this lead looks normal -  but this time it solves the biggest problem of declarer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  8 tricks all in all|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|pef: this is going to be hard for hurd to lead|pg||
nt|pef: although if the j holds he knows fred doesn't have ak10|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pef: so it sort of pinpoints wooldridges holding|pg||
nt|stevo:  declarer will get squeezed on the 5th diamond for down 3 possibly|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pef: hurd is going to think a while |pg||
nt|stevo:  or not :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: thats what he came up with|pg||
nt|pef: I guess he didn't make the same inference I did :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|pef: north south in the closed room did really well to play 2 hearts making 4 here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  peacefull NT game for a pause|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|pef: now can east possibly know where the queen of spades is?|pg||
nt|pef: he might easily lead a low one|pg||
nt|stevo:  hard not to lead a low one|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Some might get overboard on 15 and a 5@c suit opposite an opening.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: who needs a club control - and anyway, partner has it :P|pg||
nt|psridhar: @h queen also|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|zyxzewski: probably 3@H showed six, so he reasoned that @HQ is not so important now|pg||
nt|psridhar: why? @h need not break 2-2 :)|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: most likely he just looked at his cards and decided that he wants to play slam |pg||
nt|psridhar: he will succeed |pg||
nt|zyxzewski: yes indeed|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: but i'm also not a big fan of this bidding sequence|pg||
nt|psridhar: those who wish to argue can keep doing so ...Minelga will chalk up 980 |pg||
nt|psridhar: trap for Minelga was in avoiding @s as trumps -6@s has no play|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: most likely his first idea was - "if partner has 2 keycards + @HQ, i want to try 7@H" - so he asked for KC and discovering that one keycard is missing, he cannot ask about @HQ ...|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: anymore and he doesn't know anything about club control, it was already too late to do anything else :)|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: this time 1430 KCB would have been better - he can at least check for @HQ|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: the most common reason to switch the meanings of 5@C and 5@D answers to ace- or keycard-asking is, that 1 is much more common than 0|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: what now - spade to ace and spade ruff with 10?|pg||
nt|psridhar: my theory is 1430 for @s and @d as trumps; 0314 for @h and @c as trumps|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sfoxa:  if...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but is seems obvious, yes|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sfoxa:  looks like EW use precision style|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|santyclz: 6@cs on a non-@h lead.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they may well land in 3NT as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  S's hand deserves a slam just after partner's opening|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  a lot of controls|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Vugraphzdu: 2h alerter as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: alerted*|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, S is on his way|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|santyclz: (Or 6@s, 6nt)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  relay bidding makes defenders life harder - first lead to find|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sfoxa:  S has to be curious and collect all the info available from bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: indeed, he is asking about everything|pg||
nt|santyclz: Also makes on a non-@h lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  so far - so good|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@cs is the par contract and at imps it shouldn't be impossible to get there.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|sfoxa:  9 tricks only - 4@s + 4@d + @h Ace |pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  chance for an imp for EW|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: Marupe got 7 imps from board 13|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: the other team tried 5@c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W has to cash @c A now, otherwise declarer collects 6 @h tricks, 6 @s and @d A|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  o, sorry, but E is on lead - his task is more complicated|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sfoxa:  but still!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  without @h lead - 12 available|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: Oh yes, I fixated on  @cs and didn't see it makes without them.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: N has to hope for 2-2 trump|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|h7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: oh  |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as an option, 2 @d ruffs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or so - to pitch 1 @d loser on spareds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: no need :)|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: quite a tough double... i thought that the one with distribution should compete|pg||
nt|psridhar: for a Vul t.o X at 2 level by N , S hand is tempting to bid higher|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: and South's 2@S is of course an underbid - but not in case his partner may double with such hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||

nt|psridhar: for all that weakness / flaw in N hand , South is still making 4@s isnt he?|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|santyclz: It's comparing to only 1 table while the event is scored imps across all tables.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  very favourable lay of the cards for NS - @s game is makeable, but not biddable, it seems|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|santyclz: 4nt?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm. that won't halp declarer make it, but looks unusual (for me at least)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: for me too|pg||

nt|Vugraphzdu: then the final round will begin|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: Not really to suggest @ds but to show where outside values are in case of a 5@h bid.|pg||
