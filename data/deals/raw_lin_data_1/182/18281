mb|p|nt|jcomyn: so obviously not all that difficult|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|idc: A borderline invitational hand for East|pg||
mb|4S|nt|capercliff: the 9@h was a curious card from that holding, looking at dummy it looks as though the A@d couldn't hurt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but wouldnt the biddin tell you somebody has got to lead a D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Brian Short is very experienced, he will put that one behind him quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: a risky balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: (we celebrated his 60th birthday back in december)|pg||

nt|jtr: Eventually losing 2@hs and 3@cs|pg||
nt|ady: 3 clubs seems odd    would have tht 2 clubs and 3 hearts |pg||
nt|idc: As one of you notes, West didn't break the transfer, so some maximum hands for spades can be excluded|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: even this 13 doesn't feel very max, feels more min|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: well why did N double without trumps|pg||

pc|h7|nt|capercliff: he dooubled them out of @h, felt obliged to double @s as well:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|idc: Yes - would play fine opposite xx or Ax in hearts, but not opposite most holdings there|pg||

nt|capercliff: that doesnt seem possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I like West's 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: On a day when I felt frisky, a 2@h raise from North possible over a pass from West|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pjs_ch: yes but very awkward bid for Hallberg - what woudl you bid with his hand?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe they are playing 6-ace blackwood|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: problem getting to east   no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: the card says 1430 and he explained it as 1|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: I suppose sheridan was hoping for @HA  then it's on a finesse|pg||
nt|idc: I used to like raising on Hx there, gets opponents' estimates of total trumps messed up!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: south has problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzhw: a kind of endplay now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or even a drop|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pjs_ch: with 3@H passable, X must be takeout, but you lack four spades|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Penton asks about discards: odd encouraging, even suit-preference|pg||

nt|ianmcc: and North will pitch?|pg||
nt|capercliff: North could have given @s count?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Goodman puts hand down, leans forward|pg||

nt|capercliff: declarers hand is a mystery|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ianmcc: like 4NT|pg||

nt|chick: unlikely to bid it though|pg||

nt|vugraphzfu: Right, so at the other table someone took the cards for board 8 when they were playing board 7.|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|pjs_ch: yes there was a trial in Wales - players there are keen on having trials !|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: normal contract-making service resumed :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: on board 7 3N was played from the North hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Dew returns and play resumes|pg||
nt|capercliff: and on the K@s lead from E(ducked) he had a swith to find|pg||
nt|idc: I guess both @d honours onside but clubs wrong would have made his line work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Board 8 will be played in the OR, and Mike Amos will rule (if he needs to) after that|pg||
mb|1S|nt|capercliff: 13 away|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ady: 4 of either major doomed if defence cash their 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but what now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|capercliff: 12 rather|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we're on our own in CR now, both the other matches have finished|pg||
nt|capercliff: i wonder if the South hand is worth a 2@h bid here in the passout seat?|pg||
nt|idc: Ok, for these last 3 Bds of the match, we have scores from the other room|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jtr: South more likely to lead one than North|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: yes best|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 2@d is alerted - presumably some form of raise|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3NT amazing|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: they did well in the otehr room reaching 3N, which makes if either major runs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: horrible duplicated distribution in the minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I wonder if 3N makes with some strange squeeze-endplay on E?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: see if Unia can keep up the good work|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no   cant|pg||
nt|jtr: Not a success|pg||
nt|ady: not an unreasonable shot   but will cost 2 tricks|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ianmcc: this gives him an alternative line|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: a real Guessem hand|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: identiical bidding !|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzfv: perhaps I'm double-dummy|pg||
nt|idc: The Welsh SOuth in 4@h other room rather mangled the play - took wrong route back to hand at end, forgetting that West had bid spades I think|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: in the other room an initial spade lead means S had to cash his AKQ and that set up 5 tricks for East|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how do we see how other matches are going|pg||
nt|idc: 4@h should really make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: so more IMPs for the leaders?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: that might put him on right track?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: if there is one|pg||
nt|mcarroll: There isnt |pg||
nt|yo_yo: John has to avoid being end played|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: his only concern is if spades don't run; if he cashes his hearts he sets up a 5th trick for|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: the defence so that never makes the contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what does e discard on hearts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pjs_ch: what declarer doesn't know is that they can never get to the fifth heart|pg||

nt|yo_yo: now for the bad news|pg||
nt|jcomyn: any expletives from s|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: he's going to make this - he has to exit @DT and get a club trick and entry to his @HJ|pg||
nt|idc: That @c is unnecessary surely?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c5|pc|h8|nt|idc: Can either play trumps from top, or finesse and later ruff @s back to hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: no expletives at all! Family viewing :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||

mb|2C|an|11-15, 6+!c or 5!c + 4M|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: big chance for scotland|pg||
nt|idc: The N-S hands fit well enough that 5@c is a decent spot, but not easy to reach|pg||
nt|idc: 3NT not as good, but makeable too with the @h blockage|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3nt with the @hs blocked.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 67+ IMP is 25-0, 39+ IMP 25-5|pg||
mb|2D|an|relay|nt|mcarroll: 3 imps for all that effort |pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: interesting splinter|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wires crossed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: splinter it says|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: CC says 1@h-3@s = "SPL" and I assume North can ask which suit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Might be in any suit - but still dubious with a void rather than a singleton|pg||
nt|capercliff: ah right, any splinter|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 1@h-4 any = void|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: so I wonder why he didn't bid 4@d|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yes and that would keep them to 4h i guess|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Nowhere near slam too much action|pg||
nt|idc: I see the well played 4@h on Bd 10 actually made an overtrick in other room|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: where we going now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Short's asking himself that question|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: the explanation is "15-17, clubs & spades"|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzfv: seems a strong Precision 2@c|pg||
pc|h2|nt|capercliff: I dont see any eason for South not to start with 1@s on this hand|pg||
nt|capercliff: reason even|pg||
nt|jcomyn: trying to make the game difficult|pg||
nt|capercliff: or 2N perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Short looks baffled|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfv: grr, sorry all, connection dropped for a mo|pg||
nt|jcomyn: probabvly saying - what the heck has he got|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not a bad game  but club ruff takes it off|pg||
nt|capercliff: now it is very muddy|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, w made the same low @d lead from hand, north ducked and s ruffed the 2nd @d...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: ooof|pg||
nt|idc: It's understandable SOuth stops in 3@c - it is North's singleton @h and AJx @d that makes his hand good|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: still ok if guesses the h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ianmcc: defence has to be careful|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: so much for convention cards, I have one in front of me and it says "splinter, 4 new void"|pg||
nt|capercliff: i have a feeling this is going to make.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but Short has explained 3@s = "void somewhere"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me too|pg||
