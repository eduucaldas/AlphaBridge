mb|3N|nt|athene: hello good morning everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hi all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: as soon as they know singel diamonds off they go|pg||
nt|haans: 16 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: As it happens, E/W had no fit anywhere. Still, the opening bid was surely right.|pg||
nt|athene: normally if you open sub-minimum in third seat for the lead on a balanced hand you want to pass partner's response|pg||
nt|athene: but south has enough he isn't totally happy about abandoning partner to a possible (probable) 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, rebidding a 5-timer is not often the best idea in such circumstances. |pg||

nt|athene: east should definitely exit a trump after ruffing|pg||
nt|athene: pinning declarer in hand|pg||
nt|athene: then west makes his @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: playing a spade through can't possibly be right - declarer can't have started with only four diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: so west isn't ruffing|pg||
nt|hawe45:  LetÂ´s be fair - Norway will hardly gain on board 1|pg||
mb|1S!|an|8-11|mb|p|nt|athene: (and if west had more trumps he wouldn't have dropped his honours the way he did!)|pg||
nt|haans: ringt sloppy |pg||
nt|jakow:  8-11 unbalansed may be longer minor. Or 5+S|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|haans: 4@H has a chance|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A typical minimum-opening by West|pg||
mb|4H|nt|milton_se: taking the trump in hand would be a serious mistake if 4-0 break ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: In their next match Iceland are planning to field the stronger partnership of Einarsson and Frisby. Should be good viewing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|athene: haha|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many pairs now use transfer in response to a natural 1@C opening.|pg||
nt|athene: this should be fine|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H must find @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't really lose more than two spades and a club, can he?|pg||
nt|talion: Pass by salomaa promises 0-8 points. viitasalo & salomaa opens on every 9+hcp hands in first or second position. even with xxxx,QJx,QJx,QJx they open 1@s i think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This 4 @H-bid can be a help for N/S|pg||

nt|haans: 2. Fantoni: Gazzilli... is a convention that I think should be used by all who play natural bridge|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: long way to go for 4th spades|pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: Yes, trump lead seems to be the least dangerous, from North's point of view.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: It is not as if it will serve any direct purpose, but the other leads might well cost a trick.|pg||

mb|d|mb|2D!|nt|brolucius: Standard to respond nowadays, when NV and holding an ace. Here North has a jack to spare.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Nothing nice about it. It means we will have to watch a 1NT contract.|pg||
nt|haans: hard to do good in defense|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's true.|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt contracts are the chamber music of bridge!  "will he unblock that 6 - will he read his partner's subtle suit-preference signal?"|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  What does East expect by partner - having a stron NT himself|pg||

nt|milton_se: depends on the definition of normal :)|pg||
nt|athene: with the hearts 3-3|pg||
nt|athene: you might scramble enough tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|haans: quite true :)|pg||
nt|haans: double does not promise clubs|pg||
nt|milton_se: this is a problem when 1@C just shows 2+ cards|pg||
nt|haans: diamonds :)|pg||
nt|haans: 5@S now??|pg||
nt|milton_se: would prefer 6|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was certainly not the right move, as we said at the time. No reason to fear 2@D when you are adding those high cards to the pot.|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|haans: 6@H?|pg||
nt|athene: wow board 19, west in the other room did exactly what south did here - bid 2nt with a weak hand 4441 singleton in his partner's suit|pg||
nt|athene: and lost 9 imps for it|pg||
nt|brolucius: A lesson for us all (and for them).|pg||
mb|2H|nt|milton_se: 6@D might be more descriptive - what can South have less than KQ at least?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: now he does not like 5@S|pg||
mb|3N!|an|4!h|nt|athene: 1@H really alerted?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe they swapped the 1@H and 1@S responses to 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: to 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: in that case, east forgot :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H must show support|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: Yes it was alerted. Dont know why|pg||
nt|brolucius: The deal will play well because of the club fit, which no-one will know about.|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so if 1@H and 3@H were natural, then 3nt must be some sort of "serious 3nt" i.e. showing a good hand for slam|pg||
nt|haans: and good hearts to ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: In which case 4@C totally obvious, but East is thinking.|pg||
nt|athene: there are many hidden possibilities - for example, 3@S might have been non-serious and 3NT is a spade cue with a serious hand|pg||
nt|haans: bidding slam either very good or beginners luck|pg||
nt|brolucius: The slowness of the auction must be a bit worrying for Iceland supporters.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|milton_se: ooops|pg||
nt|haans: pass = VOID in spades |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: pass stronger that double|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: he he|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@S probably key-card ask. Yes, Exclusion RKCB with a spade void.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1 step is 1 or 4 controls.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it was just showing the void, allowing west to ask for keycards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not including the @SA because it is opposite the disclosed void.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: 0-3|pg||
nt|haans: 5!Q for @HQ|pg||
nt|cenglund: Seems unbeatable as the cards lie|pg||
nt|m_niemi: with lots of lower honors E passes 3NT|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now 4@h is clear choice|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|milton_se: 1100 is still cheap|pg||
nt|haans: jump to 5M = leave them alone|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|haans: steady bidding I say|pg||
nt|athene: west must know 7@H can't be good - @S- @HKQxx @DAKxxx @CAxxx would have bid more than 3@H, surely|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: 3@H to weak for Grand|pg||
nt|athene: and even if east has all that, the grand is still not laydown|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was not a good hand for keycard-asking because East also needed to know about fillers in the minors, as well as the trump ace.|pg||
nt|athene: north gets sneaky on lead|pg||
nt|athene: if the contract depended on a diamond finesse, north wants to talk declarer out of it right away|pg||
nt|brolucius: His heart will be pounding now.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|milton_se: but direct 6@S would probably have bought it|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes, of course, declarer has to bring in the suit for no losers with @DQx in hand|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|athene: and you look a bit silly|pg||
nt|m_niemi: should have played @c first|pg||
nt|cenglund: careless play|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now cannot ruff @c to dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: count his tricks: 3@h + 4@S + 3 top = 10|pg||
nt|m_niemi: yes, always making|pg||
nt|cenglund: I wonder how he is going to make 4H|pg||
nt|m_niemi: ruff a @d to hand?|pg||

nt|jakow:  Well if he ducks C and ryuff a clud, he'll lose two trumps|pg||
nt|m_niemi: unless S plays 2x@c|pg||
nt|cenglund: ducking the first club would retain control for 11 eleven tricks|pg||
nt|m_niemi: this is teams so make sure to make your contract|pg||
nt|m_niemi: thats what E did|pg||
nt|psyck: it would be the same if dec played @c immed, S can later play 4th @c to set up a trump|pg||

mb|4S|nt|brolucius: The better the player, the earlier he makes his plan. Really good players sometimes make a plan before they play the first card from dummy.|pg||

nt|rodal f: The most common one also, but this one is hard.|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: Michael Rosenberg said in most slam auctions you should be trying to play the hand through before you actually finish bidding it|pg||
nt|haans: player playing relays can claim before 1st card|pg||
nt|brolucius: Difficult at our level, Bill, because we rarely have the faintest idea what will appear in the dummy.|pg||
nt|athene: true - of course neither did rosenberg, when he was playing with zia|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hah!|pg||

nt|haans: vulnerable game|pg||

nt|athene: north not too happy with this|pg||
nt|haans: nest is pass now|pg||
nt|haans: best|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has to guess whether to show the hearts, where there might be a fit, or to pass 1NT, Unlucky.|pg||
nt|haans: pass before they double|pg||
nt|athene: if you play 1nt as forcing or semi-forcing, so it has quite a high upper range, you are more stuck in this sort of situation that normally|pg||
nt|athene: because you can't run to 3 of your long suit without implying better values|pg||
nt|brolucius: I remember Forrester berating his partner for not passing 1NT with some 5-4-2-2 shape. The first time I passed 1NT on such a shape (5-4 in the majors, as here) we missed a heart ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: game. Partner had five hearts. |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: did Forrester's partner have both majors?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Blame that one on Forrester, I told my partner.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|haans: who has the @DQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is your screen dirty, Hans?|pg||
nt|haans: Jörgensen playing hearts??|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer can be held to two trumps, @SAK and one club, i think, on best defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: easy make (2 spades + 1 clubs) :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: unless he plays West for AQ in spades|pg||
nt|haans: I did see E problem|pg||
nt|athene: the main issue for east is whether to stick the @HQ through rather than playing the third diamond|pg||
nt|athene: assuming west continues diamonds here of course which is not obvious|pg||
nt|athene: this is another situation where count signals are just more use than attitude - west wants to know if a diamond will just ruffing finesse his partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: No need for E to signal attitude, because it was obvious he held the ace when the king won. But some would signal count, others SP. perhaps.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: second round show @SJ|pg||
nt|psyck: as W may have bid on 2@h with unbal hand, wonder if pass shows 15-17 NT|pg||

nt|athene: so a lot of contracts come through when the originally-led suit is continued incorrectly|pg||
nt|haans: agrre to that but low spades?|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the same number let through when East switches.|pg||
nt|athene: well that doesn't really matter|pg||
nt|athene: once east has led the spade that is committal|pg||
nt|brolucius: Normal arrangement is for East to show his count in spades with his return. The 2 is 4th best.|pg||
nt|brolucius: But that does not help West to read the remaining high cards in the suit.|pg||
nt|haans: but here he can say Yes or No about spades|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he might sort of want to lead a big one to say he has no strength in the suit but he can't expect his partner to read that - just lead original 4th best back the way you ...|pg||
nt|athene: agreed|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer has a big advantage in that his clubs are concealed|pg||
nt|brolucius: East knew that West held four spades, because of the fourth-best 3 lead when he held the 2.  So, maybe he could afford the 6 to tell partner that he could not help in the suit.|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't realise the urgency - for all he knows, diamonds are a suit declarer will have to develop for himself|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, East can hardly judge that South has only K-x in diamonds when he undertook 3NT opposite a weak two.|pg||
nt|cenglund: Magic diamond did not work well this time|pg||
nt|pelu: so from -1500 (3@D +2 ) to only -50 or -100  - a hard wqay to gain IMPs|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|athene: your spot cards in the minors leave something to be desired|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT shows a stopper in the opener's suit - not in responders, since you expect the doubler to cover any unbid suit.|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Seemingly obvious double for East.|pg||

nt|athene: (three hearts)|pg||
nt|athene: so he just has to pass and hope that if 1nt is going a lot down his partner will find a double|pg||
nt|m_niemi: excactly 8 tricks is not likely so bid game or pass|pg||
nt|pelu: and??|pg||
nt|cenglund: Koistinen's 5S bid after parner's Michael's cue was not bold, it was bad judgement|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, non intermediate hands|pg||
nt|m_niemi: that hand is medium so to good to low, and too weak to high|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|haans: many see double as responsive double|pg||
nt|brolucius: A responsive double is when your partner has doubled.|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: 10 easy tricks now|pg||

pc|dA|nt|m_niemi: will probably loose 3 tricks in @d-contract|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: as it turns out he is gaining so much the double would not be that much extra|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, the 3. Now West KNOWS that his partner has a singleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Unless they are playing reverse count.|pg||
nt|athene: i assumed reverse|pg||
nt|athene: on board 17 west played the @S7 from @S97 in a "give count" situation|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might not hold a trump anyway.|pg||
nt|haans: most in scandinavia play reverse (we call in Schneider)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer needs to know the opponents' methods in order to prepare his own false card.|pg||

nt|athene: you know opps have at least an 8-card heart fit|pg||
nt|athene: just raise clubs|pg||
nt|haans: we seen that before direct 2@C forcing|pg||
nt|athene: well he must have some way to show a moderate club raise|pg||
nt|talion: 2@c is 9-14 5+@c|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: 2!VC is no raise|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 2@C not forcing, you can bid 2@S to show a sound club raise.|pg||
nt|athene: even if i had to go to the 3-level, i would still do that|pg||
nt|athene: people get overly worried about their partner having a short minor|pg||
nt|m_niemi: this should go down|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  But as often happens - when you can make 2, you bid 4|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @c + 2@s+2@d to EW|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4@H +1 or 4@S =|pg||
nt|haans: so true :)|pg||
nt|athene: here, the odds are very low that west only has two clubs, because then he would have spade length - not likely, from east's hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, and he has let N/S find their heart fit, pushing them even higher in clubs.|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h = 11-16 against passed partner|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: 4@S make it harder for short spade suit to ruff|pg||
nt|athene: i mean west actually has the worst club length he could ever have and it would still have been better to raise directly|pg||
nt|cenglund: A good board for the Finns as the cards are lie|pg||
nt|cenglund: Only 8 trick against best defence|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it is losing bridge to hold back and say 'You might have had only 2 clubs'. What about all the other hands where West has more than 2 clubs?|pg||

pc|c9|nt|m_niemi: no 1@s bid by W|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Not a very good 3NT if the @CQ is doubleton and it still goes down.|pg||
nt|athene: well you might lead the @CJ to pin east's @C10x|pg||
nt|athene: but just playing for either defender to have doubleton queen looks more sensible|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: East's double makes the @CQ a more likely doubleton when so few points are out.|pg||
nt|athene: he knows he is down anyway so he will just knock out the @DA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bill's idea of bidding 2NT was at least 120% better than 3NT. Why not?|pg||
nt|athene: fourth best @H4 means the hearts can't be 6-3 so even if east has the @HA you can never isolate west|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|haans: 4@C-4@S-p|pg||
nt|milton_se: this is the crucial decision|pg||

nt|athene: 13 on top but can you find that out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: @sK by W would have made situation clear to E|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Without the @D-finesse, the contract looks fine...|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|haans: Relays the way|pg||
nt|athene: all west has to do is ask for keycards and then find the @HK really|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: cards for 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, because he knows now that East has four hearts.|pg||
nt|athene: he could do that by simply bidding blackwood over 2@H, if that is possible|pg||

nt|haans: was not easy to find|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 14-16|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: looks as though he is relaying for the shape in which case he will find out what he needs to know|pg||

nt|haans: 5 controls (A=2 K=1)|pg||
nt|brolucius: They will be happy to pick up some hands so well suited to relay bidding.|pg||
nt|cenglund: Three of the four misses go to the account of Nyberg-Koistinen|pg||

nt|haans: assume claim now|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a spade lead, the hearts are blocked and you may need clubs 2-1.|pg||

pc|c3|nt|haans: 1S+2H+5D+1C = 9|pg||
nt|milton_se: has to make the right decision in Cs though|pg||

nt|milton_se: obvious that NS systematically open 11+|pg||

nt|athene: NS in the other room were more in control and might have found a good grand if south had the @SA not @DA|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@D was a better rebid, even if 2@H was forcing to game and 3@H was therefore forcing. |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
