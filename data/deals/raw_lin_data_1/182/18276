mc|7|nt|ntmon: it pays to have firm agreement regarding double on transfer - ie. T/O for transferred suit. works nicely here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: a few minutes until next board|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: yes|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: passing partner's 1 minor opening often gives away tempo, but i can symphatize with that - if partner rebids 1@S over your 1@H then it's not pleasant, but you can still bid 1NT|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: after all, playing bridge is not about making your contracts, but it's about scoring points|pg||
nt|ntmon: NV is surely worth a risk|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: and if you are left to play 1NT undoubled non-vulnerable, it usually is good for you|pg||
