nt|zyxzewski: If E finds bid 2@D they'll find a good save against 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|zyxzewski: or they can push NS to five|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 3@D CERTAINLY will get the save:)|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: well|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: actually 4@S should be set|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: they have three aces and couple of chances for obtaining heart ruff|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: yes 4@S can be defeated|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but wasnt in the other room|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: hmmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: north should be disciplined and accept her pards decision|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: strange 5@S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: this is a clear lack of experience - TRUST PARTNER|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: if she passed first to let partner decide, then she should stick with double, if she was going to 5@S anyway, she should have bid it|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  partscore battle|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: Hi, welcome back|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|henryb:  because if Brad had @dA -- Peter, North was about to be on lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S isn't strong enough, but the shape looks promising|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is afraid a x willl be left in and he has insufficient values for defense.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|pef: oh, sorry, had to run to feed the dog, missed that north was going to be on lead|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pef: not as good an excuse as drinking with bobby, I know :)|pg||
nt|stevo:  def a weak excuse IMO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred explains that brad would bid a 4 card major with a balnced hand over 2@c or at least could|pg||
nt|pef: well at least I can spelll|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: no such explanation on the other side|pg||

nt|henryb:  got the hand over anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: there is a short break every 6 boards and ofcourse new teams too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 4 of either major or 5@ds depending on picking up the @dq.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think bd 6 will be the winner in the field |pg||
mb|1C!|an|16+ points|nt|pef: making 6 in 4 spades on this board would certainly win almost all the mps for n/s|pg||
nt|pef: which is what happened in the closed room|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|stevo:  Fred thinking 3NT here with his q-bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  the other room is so boring that all the kibitzers have come here|pg||
nt|pef: specs are asking me why hurd didn't bid 2h.  I think it's becfause his hand is a bit too good nv vs. vul and has good cards for play in the other two suits|pg||
nt|pef: what do you guys think?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh, here comes a club lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: just a hunch |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|pef: now that's cruel, Barry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: EW are playing the so called brown concention|pg||
mb|d|nt|jade: just waiting for the sonambulists to cath up|pg||
mb|2D|nt|stevo:  I agree with Hurd hand too good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: well bid to the rightside|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, in 6 EW did very well|pg||
nt|santyclz: Most people (around here) play a 1nt in that position shows 11-14 or so.  S should x and rebid nt (unless w bids @cs).|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now they are lucky to defend 3nt, not 4@h|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@s was probably some kind of crash|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: always play nt when you hold qx, right?|pg||
nt|stevo:  its very important to know if 3@H shows stopper here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|blum1956: red or black suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  which i think is very good way to play it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzdu: yes|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|stevo:  or advance q-bid slam try|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pef: well he has a bit of both, doesn't he|pg||
nt|stevo:  well not really a slam try that would be way to hungry|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: tremendous round |pg||
nt|santyclz: In the other room shown (just 1 of several, bear in mind) w passed originally and overcalled in @cs to keep n-s out of nt.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (To see the bidding at the other table, hover your mouse pointer over the other room score.)|pg||
nt|sybarra:  http://www.bridge.ee/festival/invitational11.htm for on-line results - we should remember - it's pairs, so no imps score  |pg||
nt|sybarra: the imp score at our table is an indication, NOT the score in the event|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: a little break again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: its every 4 boards |pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|santyclz: A fine 3rd seat opening.|pg||
nt|blum1956: one more chance fr NS to bid game|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  color blind Barry?|pg||
nt|pef: double probably shows a heart suit with diamond support|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  yes good start for E/W|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I have to put in random clicks cause the computer is so loud. |pg||
nt|pef: specs point out that 4h actually doesn't make on the stiff diamond lead (or a less likely diamond from kxx if south on leas|pg||
nt|pef: on lead, I mean|pg||
nt|pef: but I still think n/s are going to bid 4s over 4h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Dont want to tip off the table as to whos bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  understand that|pg||

mb|p|pc|h5|nt|henryb:  Van Vogt wrote a Null-A|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: thats what it looks like|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: whew short break |pg||
nt|santyclz: N has a borderline Drury, aggresive.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pef: is a quasi alert like a pseudo alert, Barry|pg||
nt|sybarra: so you didnt have to hear me sing |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|stevo:  decent hand with 5 hearts or 6 bad|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphzff: i call em like i see em Peter|pg||
nt|stevo:  sorry that was private as to what 2 hearts would have shown over 1@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pef: this might go down 2 to push the result|pg||
nt|pef: he's unlikely to play the hand the bid both red suits also for spade length|pg||
nt|henryb:  My guess is that the right way to play 4@s is to play @cA and a club. If clubs 2-2, play spades 2-2. Otherwise play the person with 3 clubs for a stiff spade|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pef: true|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  N is very famous aggressor - Lithuanian player|pg||
nt|sybarra: N will be in this bidding |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  easy hand for E-W to bid too much on the lie of the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  oops wrong again!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 1@s preemptive!|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|pef: n/s are in the rather interesting contract of four clubs doubled in the closed room|pg||

nt|blum1956: the 3NT bid looks most strange|pg||

nt|sybarra: so far so good |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge asks Fred about the King lead and about carding|pg||
nt|pef: he's going to have to play this carefully, but it looks like the spade spots enable him to succeed|pg||
nt|stevo:  so if declarer draws trumps here hes in good shape by setting up diamonds|pg||

nt|Vugraphzdu: NS sure did ask every step of the way with that calim|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: claim*|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|henryb:  maybe second best through declarer?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Fred writes a note about his 2@d bid|pg||
nt|stevo:  Brad has an interesting opening if I opened I would bid 1@D then 2@C but I dont like rebidding 1NT with small singletons|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|sfoxa:  1nt is 1-round forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: there goes the spade fit|pg||
nt|stevo:  A good treatmen over the q-bid is 2nt majors not that he has it but if he were 5 5 you would like to have it available|pg||
nt|pef: but likely a surprise spade lead against 3nt|pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: N had a choice between 3@S (an underbid IMHO) and 2nt.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd opt for 2NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  first of all - game forcing, second reason - S has all the 3rd level to sale his hand |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  S has hard decision now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Specs point out that 3nt was also an option with 19 and a good suit.|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|pef: we're all leading a spade here, I bet hurd does also|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred says " impressive huh"  Brad says TY|pg||
nt|henryb:  which is not wuite as good as pllaying 4@sX|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|stevo:  i also would play 3@D showing a stopper not asking with 3M available without one|pg||
nt|pef: can you make 4sx after spade and spade?|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|blum1956: Again the 2@h bid was marginal. Just as the 3NT bid 2 boards ago|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|d4|nt|santyclz: Or -2, I forgot the "see all 4 hands effect."|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door result is the same, and i suppose few more will be|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N took normal line of play at the table|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  several pairs may land into 3nt and the luckiest will be allowed to make the contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we have no exact result, but remember - it's butler score, so the leaders play vs vice-leaders at the 1st table, 3rd and  4th pairs are here.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  1round delay to encounter|pg||
