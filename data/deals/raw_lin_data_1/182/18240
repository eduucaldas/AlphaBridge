nt|caitlin: last board here|pg||
nt|othered1: Among possibilities for 2@C opening, notes say, "May have only 5@C if also 5@D and 12+ to 16 HCP"  Perhaps that's what south considered 2N to mean|pg||

nt|thurston:  union rules!|pg||

nt|fabsayc: but at some point you have to learn to play at a reasonable pace|pg||
nt|lml: yes but you did through the whole event|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there are real penalties for slow play in the worlds|pg||
nt|lml: I know and there were all through the event but we want to pick the best team|pg||
nt|thurston:  new CBF time rules - individuals get penalty times that accumulate and can result in suspension from future events|pg||
nt|lml: I just meant a bit lenient ...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and that to me is the one that can finish on time :)|pg||
