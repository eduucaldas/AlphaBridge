nt|pjs_ch: but the heart pips are really good so only one loser in that suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: Play suspended, TD goes to check the Open Room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That explains a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Players think they're in the right chairs, Open Room wrong?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: was it the last european where england was sitting wrongly and it wasnt discovered till the end of the set?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: that will give commentators time to calculate if 4@h makes, if he's allowed to play it!|pg||

nt|dburn: still, might not be so easy for the defenders to cash out|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: It's a most weak suit in which to overcall btu with a 5431 shape you do want to bid|pg||
nt|dburn: although North knows enough to cash the club next, at least|pg||
nt|dburn: unless West would ask for a club stopper with a void in clubs and nothing in spades, which seems unlikely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Lindsay's pondering this|pg||
nt|dburn: Burns ought to give count, not attitude, if North plays @cA next|pg||

pc|dT|nt|dburn: good lead|pg||

nt|dburn: indeed it does - in theory this now has no chance, but in practice....|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|mcarroll: why not 3@D over 3 @C?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: I'm not so sure - I like to play 2N as clearly obstructive/weak or clearly constructive/strong|pg||
