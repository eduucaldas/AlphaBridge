nt|haans: Hi Carl|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4D|nt|haans: 8 tricks 9th in clubs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: interestingly they they have typed some of finnish players first names too, so from finland there are playing Pia Erkkilä and Hulda Ahonen, pair that plays strong club (15+)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: also welcome to Magnus|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: the norwegians are playing a natural system with 5 card majors - the finnish girls prefer a strong (+15hp) 1@c|pg||
nt|sharkey: live update of scores & standings: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=475&csm=Rank&nt=3&nb=17&csh=0000000000111|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Frisk start med en oplagt slem...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|iceking: S took a rather passive view here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W can perhaps see, that 1@d is bid on a 4-card suit, so a small from dummy|pg||
nt|iceking: not sure i could play def vs 2@H here, though bidding is little strange also as you are not sure you have fitt anywere|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Gautis|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gautis2: hello, and good morning:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: He may be a bit biassed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wife playing as South|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is the winning contract - espescially now with the natural @d-lead from E|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hawe45:  Kunne Ãst ikke have overmeldt med 4 Ru?|pg||
nt|grebrof: the norwegians are naturalists (besides the bery weak NT in nonvul 1st-3rd) opposite the more artificial approach from the finnish|pg||
nt|haans: finns Magic Diamond?|pg||
nt|grebrof: I have thai keyboard, so there is a chance for mistyping - bery = very|pg||
nt|haans: yes close for me 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: these two plays magid diamond . the other pair strong @c|pg||
nt|sharkey: I have the same problem Espen - not Thai but Thumbs....|pg||
nt|grebrof: lol|pg||
nt|grebrof: I will try to look before I post|pg||
nt|grebrof: back to the game...|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt  a make|pg||
nt|grebrof: this ended in a draw 15-15VP last meeting|pg||
nt|sharkey: Marianne Harding and Ann Karin Fuglestad are the anchor pair of the Norwegian team - many years international experience|pg||
nt|grebrof: duck a @D is a loser if @ds are QJ block, but will make 9 tricks anyhow|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gautis2: figure i still not know her well enoghe since i dont have a clue what 3@h means:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|iceking: was no rush for Ace of @D|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hi - mys danish were just the daily exercises...|pg||
nt|iceking: low would keep better control af everything|pg||
nt|sharkey: undo?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|grebrof: Stine has had some very good results, so its about time she got her chance for the national team (gautis being biased or not)|pg||
nt|grebrof: she is NOT playing with you now my friend :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2NT may be with 5 hearts so bidding an error|pg||
pc|cA|nt|zebutin: different openings from 1st/2nd hand and 3rd/4th for finnish pair, but from 1st and 2nd they play weak nt, and 1@D-1@S openings are 10-14 and 4card suit|pg||
nt|gautis2: :) ..well, cant argue with sucess, since 4@s was born to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=475&csm=Rank&nt=3&nb=1&csh=0000000000111|pg||
nt|Walddk5: running scores|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes - Harding - Fuglestad also was part of the team that won last time at Lillehammer in 2007|pg||
nt|cenglund:  SpA was hardly discarded|pg||
nt|sharkey: She really pitched @SA on @C lead operator?|pg||
nt|haans: spade ace|pg||
nt|haans: on lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: Finland 2009 was the last championships I am told (thanks Geo) - looking at the unions homepage, you might get tricked|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and S has been cought already after trick1|pg||

nt|psyck: Hi Magnus & Ralf|pg||
nt|haans: small spade from E|pg||
mb|1D|nt|zebutin: and if some pairs card interests you http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.2354|pg||
nt|zebutin: has convention card for all players it seems|pg||
nt|grebrof: Gunn Tove was in the winning team in 2007 - then partnering Siv Thoresen who is by many considered being the best female player in Norway. for the first time in many years (dont ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: know hom many), she is not in the bracket this time|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H!|nt|hawe45:  Anyway, ti was easier to play than to bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: good start for Norway avoiding the impossible 4@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: some kind of Multi...|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|zebutin: 1nt 15-17 from 3rd hand|pg||
nt|haans: easy make in 3nt at last board|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@s on NS|pg||
nt|iceking: good slam here |pg||
nt|iceking: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|grebrof: the +15 @c comes into action|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pass or Correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: lot of options for S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They finished in 5@c last deal in open after some relay bids with 3 rounds of @h for -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: chose drury|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@C probably one way drury|pg||
nt|sharkey: If N can find a take out x now....|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@d showing a good opening with at least game interest|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D real opening,as i play myself here i would bid 3@D with north hand natural and slammish|pg||
nt|nubmaster: So a good start for Sweden here|pg||
nt|gautis2: partscore battle|pg||
nt|grebrof: as a guess I would think the dbl of 1@h from E is 5-7hp - their card says nothing about what "neg dbls" are|pg||
nt|gautis2: i guess x shows hp s not @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@d a nice treatment there Magnus|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 3D/3H transfer nodays 3@C just showing max|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ianmcc: 4@h seems to need to find @dQ, tho 4th @s could be useful|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|zebutin: in 4@H you would seem to lose 2 @S + @C, because spades are 3-3 you can throw one diamond to 4th spade|pg||
nt|zebutin: so might not need to quess diamond suit|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room finnish women played 2@S some down, there is magic diamond system in effect, that has 8-11 openings in 1st and 2nd hand, so makes often for different scores|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is a very good contract for NS|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|psyck: N will likely blast to slam in spite of missing a keycard|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Anyone who can tell us about the bidding here? 2NT like good/bad NT or something?|pg||
nt|haans: thats a "modern" weak 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl from N is good seing the layout|pg||
pc|d2|nt|derric: good morning|pg||
pc|d3|nt|iceking: W made a very light 3rd seat opening in open room|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mbruun:  THis aggressive lead will cost the defense a trick, and HQ another one, so all of a sudden nine tricks turned to eleven. No big deal in teams though |pg||
nt|haans: scoring blood|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder what 5@s here was|pg||
nt|iceking: 4nt might be even number of aces |pg||
nt|psyck: oh Turbo|pg||
nt|iceking: at least it looks like it |pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably negative|pg||
nt|iceking: been told 4nt shows 3+aces|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, not Turbo then, just their own methods|pg||
nt|iceking: nicely done anyway |pg||
nt|nubmaster: well done here, both K and J in @s works so no trouble with Q of @h offside|pg||
nt|gautis2: not fan of 4@h  ..better to do an invitasional bid after 2@s ...not this "shot"|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is sometimes the problem with strong 1@c - in a contested auction like this, you dont always know if 2@s is a bid with 4 or 5 @ss - now they escaped|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe...|pg||
nt|sharkey: may escape with down 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice to see such a young table in a very strong competition like this|pg||
pc|dA|nt|zebutin: good day Juho, its allready 14.00 in finland...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Juho, 2100 in Melbourne|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks and next|pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like one loser in each suit|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|gautis2: y, should  be 200|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|psyck: after Souths free bid & jump to 4@s, N could have also bid slam other table, but was tougher after opps intervention i guess|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|h6|nt|mbruun:  Back to nine again. Interesting|pg||
nt|gautis2: board 1 was a coopy of 3NT, so well done to both teams|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|grebrof: otherwise I agree with not bidding 4@h (allthou it looks like P has a single @s) but P only made a single raise - guess they have ways to show a better raise - well, the ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: vulnerability is "right", so can understand 4@h too|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: best defense|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nubmaster: In Open Marie and Pia get to 4@h which seems to be doomed, especially when E lead a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was a bad play. return @cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and defence will have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not finessing @h first round... doesn't matter if E got the Q alone... E indicates both A and Q of @s because of the play|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iceking: 1@S in closed room was the problem, for sure S should have bidded more powerful bid then 1@S|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|hT|pc|c3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: Jessica missed their chance|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|gautis2: FInland bought 2@h in OR, so this willbe 7 imps to Finland..edit: 11 imps, 2 down|pg||
nt|gautis2: ..12 :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: thank god the BBO is helping us :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: is there a break?  (catfight? :) )|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: the director is coming here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Visst|pg||
nt|grebrof: viewing all 4 hands is sometimes a snag, cause you never know what they be thinking - pauses that might make a difference at the table are not always felt the same way by us|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: the Norweigen girls are asking about their bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont know the finnish strengt in a catfight, but I guess the norwegians are mediocre there :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: pherhaps 2@s bid is explained as something else?  Cant see the line of play if it is "as it is"|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont think N has a case here|pg||
nt|gautis2: i do.. :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|grebrof: this was not the best|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ianmcc: well done|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkey: instead of @S to K I think better @D and ruff with @S7|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, good shape, decent 5 carder, & useful touching honors in @c|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah - but as I said more than once in the first match between these: it is easier seeing all hands|pg||
nt|yuval10: not a bad contract at all, but very misfortune breaks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mbruun:  I suppose 2D is a very light Multi, but Im not sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt be surprised, if East bids 3 NT here|pg||
nt|derric: pass by north?|pg||
nt|derric: i think they play precision|pg||
nt|zebutin: some would bid too, A + J109x seem quite nice values...no support for partner though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wondering. But not much for East - West|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@s was certainly possible|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - we will see|pg||
nt|sharkey: i think the hand was open then Espen - shud have read the ending|pg||
nt|haans: little weak for 3@H|pg||
nt|grebrof: the contract is wrong and there are more failures that awaits when you are there|pg||
nt|grebrof: normal frisky nonul opening from S|pg||
nt|sharkey: that is a WEAK 3@H....|pg||
nt|grebrof: I like it|pg||
nt|sharkey: been there - done that...:)|pg||
nt|haans: she had no perfect bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: N thinking slam?|pg||
nt|grebrof: as they said about Marty Bergens preempts like that: "It doesnt matter what you have, its still not good enough"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Sounds reasonable|pg||
mb|1N|nt|iceking: S bid 4@S and east dbl |pg||
nt|gautis2: victory |pg||
nt|gautis2: good to stop...system victory|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Ahonen has quite bad values for balancing at red zone, even though has decent 6 card suit...but risks are quite high|pg||
nt|iceking: will be disaster if w gamble on 5@C here|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No comments...|pg||

mb|p|nt|iceking: option ofcourse but will catch very bad dummy and on best def will go for 1100|pg||
nt|haans: and spade lead?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Guess she asked for it - now just make it....|pg||
nt|grebrof: this CAN make|pg||
nt|haans: home if hearts better|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianmcc: when she doesn't balance it argues bad spades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh dear... system error|pg||
nt|grebrof: N showing 20-21hp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this will probably run to the J, and N will switch to a Major. the question is - which one?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  Ah - East wanted to know, which major South had, before bidding 3 NT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Here you'd like to play canapé, first showing 4c @s and then longer @d but there's no room for that|pg||
nt|grebrof: the good @c-suit being the missing hp|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I bet she is not going to make it|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|gautis2: y, fair upgrade|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yuval10: @s looks reasonable enough|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nubmaster: They play transfer bids over 1@c, ie 1@d=@h etc...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mbruun:  Careful defense will hold this to nine tricks, if South ducks heart in trick 2|pg||
nt|psyck: not a good start for Iceland|pg||
nt|iceking: might be the worsed possible dummy W could get|pg||
nt|iceking: now @D return and 4 down for 1100|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but major suit wastages were known on bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but couldn´t W suspect bad @s honours on E?|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Christer|pg||
nt|haans: yep my money on that 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is always a wrong line, but ok|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yuval10: you only need from partner something like HXX for it to be very successful. not this time though|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|hawe45:  Alsowithout ducking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if 1@h shows @s - why not bid the 6-card @d?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|iceking: if w was on heat one dummy would be J9xx AKx Ax AJxx and 5@C is easy make |pg||
nt|gautis2: but this will probably fail by 1..  so i presume 4 more imps to Finland,..  I need my coffee..brb:)|pg||

nt|nubmaster: But shouldn't W bid 1@s as 2-3 @s and minimum?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s5|nt|sharkey: why @HK - ruff @S and low up better...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|grebrof: the finnish is using reversed carding . the 2 showing an equal number of cards in @cs|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|ianmcc: no hope|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  East will not play @C - so 4 tricks to N/S anyway|pg||

nt|nubmaster: I'm sure 2@d is conventional here so there was no room for it as natural|pg||

pc|c8|pc|d5|nt|derric: conceding down 1 now i suppose|pg||
nt|derric: oh|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|iceking: 800 for 14imps |pg||
nt|nubmaster: But perhaps E will skip the @s and just go for the @ds from the start, it's teams and gamebonus looks really far away|pg||
nt|ralfwil: !½s10|pg||

nt|yuval10: unless NS are playing 2nd/4th carding , then the K@d is marked|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nubmaster: 2@d direct is weak with @ds but she prefered showing the @ss first and then after a possible 1@s/1NT she could've used XY-NT to 2@d|pg||

mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  N/S have no need for Blackwood on this board - one down...|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ralfwil: I think there is some undo now....|pg||

mb|p|nt|nubmaster: redo the bidding!|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  1 NT is not everybodyÂ´s taste|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@D was 11-16 or (11)12-13bal...so might end up too high|pg||
nt|derric: is north's hand unbal or did she upgrade to 12-13 bal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely|pg||

nt|grebrof: ooops - 3-9p|pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|iceking: NS are one of the best women pair in europe, been pdship for man years. Icelandic pair has less experience in international events|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: cards well placed here for a few o/t's|pg||
nt|iceking: N with some dubious holdings took the passive view here and didnt compete|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D shows @H|pg||
nt|yuval10: the only way of reaching 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 2@s shouls show a good 3 carder now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkey: Dbl = 3 @H|pg||
nt|haans: dbl = 3 spades (sipport doubles more and more popular)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  2 down on a @S-lead, it seems|pg||
nt|mbruun:  I dont mind 5cM for a NT, but a strong suit without the ace is not clear to open 1 NT|pg||
nt|cenglund:  4S is makeable in board 19|pg||
nt|sharkey: this shud make I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: as South denied 4 @s's earlier, the message from 2@s should be clear|pg||
nt|psyck: S has enuf on the auction to make a game try now|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't really understand 3@c from N then, would expect 3@h|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ralfwil: can be 10 tricks now|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: wonder if 2@s is game-force or invite|pg||
nt|derric: apparantely latter|pg||
nt|zebutin: hearts are well for declarer, everything else little less so...|pg||
nt|zebutin: lead might give 1 @C trick more|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @h and @c friendly|pg||
nt|gautis2: wd Finland, and they have a great start of this game!|pg||
nt|grebrof: reversing with  a single was not the best idea from Marianne Harding it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  In fact, the North hand is no so strong - the @DÂ´s doubtful values|pg||
nt|mbruun:  With no aces you should subtract 1 HCP from the hand. Good intermediates are a plus on the other side|pg||
nt|gautis2: seems like a not agreed auction in OR|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe she wanted to bid 3@h :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure splinters with only 3card support is the best, but I am not playing this event :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: if 4@c instead, they could have possibly landed in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is still making though, so NS did well enough|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Sure - but the @D-doubleton is not so great|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, clubs depend quite much how you play them that how friendly they are...with this lead they are friendly enough|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gautis2: i m sure it was a "slip of the mind" ..happens to all of us :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Right|pg||
nt|zebutin: and seems 3@H + 2@S + 2@C + @D make enough tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|zebutin: though might go after @D|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|grebrof: where is the @c K?|pg||
nt|psyck: doubling & then cueing is very strong action, so I think 3@c was ok, so has more than enuf with an A & a K to go to game after that i guess|pg||
pc|sT|nt|iceking: 10 tricks for one imp gain for Denmark|pg||
pc|sA|nt|derric: 3@D 1@h 2@s 2@c would do too|pg||
pc|s2|nt|grebrof: @d K - @s ruff|pg||
nt|haans: North may have AQJ in hertas and @DJ but @SQ?|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess if you sum it up, taking the finness in @s was just as goood|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|ianmcc: good switch|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, even with playing on @D makes|pg||
nt|grebrof: for some of us more often than for others|pg||
pc|c2|nt|grebrof: well, you are endplayed if the @s-finesse dont work . N playing a @d to the K in dummy|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must discard a @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or a @d|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nubmaster: Yes, no good to just ruff and play ace of @s and then minor cards, S will have a @h left together with a tr|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think South did very well with her hand, to be honest i'd expect N's hand to be AQJX X KTX AKQXX or something like that, then slam is laydown|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mbruun:  Good Cl 10 to emphasize doubleton spade|pg||

nt|nubmaster: Mikael G told me that the operator is new and are in training so we will have some allowance here... and she has no time to comment|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Heart lead is the killer|pg||

pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  No RD, please, that would loose 2 IMPÂ´s to 2140|pg||

nt|zebutin: even though hand is good|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cenglund:  Not so far-fetched play given the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: not so good methods here for ew. |pg||
nt|haans: right, double in my book not hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: for sure W should decl with his holding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 4@c from W = bid your suit under, and contract on the strong hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, some play 4@c |pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead needed I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  If West finds the killing lead, they will call the police|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Will make in practice|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 1@s could be passed out (but I agree)|pg||
nt|derric: partner is likely to raise on any 3+ support|pg||
nt|iceking: ofcourse that would be more normal |pg||
nt|iceking: with everything breaking nicely this should make |pg||
nt|gautis2: this seems like a flat boars..  this time I almost bet I m right:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2 last hands are rather routine|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|grebrof: its the same contract again - so, I would go for a norwegian 1IMP reward :D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: still time to switch|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|derric: though some pass all 7-counts opposite overcall|pg||
pc|h2|nt|zebutin: mostly matter of partnership agreements and individual bidding style|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mbruun:  With 9 HCP partner is weak, so heart is more natural in teams. Partner cant have a strong spade holding|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck:  will play @h 1st & can fin @s into safe hand later if reqd|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h is automatic in trick 2 in order to take out a possible entry to E's hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nubmaster: continue with ace of @c now for a push?|pg||

nt|gautis2: my guess is 200 and 7 imps...  coke-bet (ruling board 2)|pg||
nt|grebrof: I bet against you :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: North had a 6 card fit which she hadnt shown|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The 6th heart is valuable|pg||
nt|yuval10: finally an interesting one|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Yes  - but after a slow start|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This looks like a coffee-board for 420 N/S|pg||
nt|mbruun:  4 Sp seems to be the spot, and its a very natural contract|pg||
nt|psyck: they have to be careful not to get too high here with cards unfav|pg||
nt|haans: but is no ace|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|zebutin: 2@D most likely multi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks with open cards|pg||
nt|iceking: slam makes |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|nubmaster: In open the Icelandic ended up in 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Johansson has many quick tricks in hand, so didnt want to bid lame 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: or east could maybe dbl 3@D here |pg||
mb|1N|nt|iceking: 3@D looks alot down 5-6 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  North will raise to three, and a well placed DK will make South go to game|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Ah, started to write that before it showed up on the screen, sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have 12 top tricks and it looks possible that you can squeeze your way to the 13th|pg||
nt|psyck:  could there be 13 tricks here with W squeezed in majors?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|grebrof: 1@c +15hp|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1@s balanced +9 or 4441|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 3@s is presumably preempting|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 8-11 ? really?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gautis2: did we get the result  of board 2 Johanna?  |pg||
nt|cenglund:  This a better slam than the previous one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: some prospects|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room they got to open 1@H telling 4+ @H and 8-11...and after that sailed to 3nt|pg||
nt|derric: 3NT went down after declarer broke entries in open|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Cards are not lying in favour of making 6NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|zebutin: this lead destroys one entry to @C suit, but give ruffing finese in @S suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: and they figure it out, so a  stop...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finnish ladies avoided the tempation|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I think the director chosed to let it be (4heartsx-2), but I'm not shore!|pg||
nt|grebrof: not that I can see EW doing something viable over 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may have bid 4@S with West hand - but 5332 distribution is a negative|pg||
nt|santyclz: 29 hcp so it may not be automatic to get there.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|zebutin: so if takes that, she is losing 2@D + @H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Maybe 4@s here|pg||
nt|gautis2: ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: I wouldnt change that board 2 either|pg||
nt|grebrof: but ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: not the best lead here|pg||
nt|grebrof: if there is any|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nubmaster: good bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep, surely not 7... 6 will probably be good enough|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: it removes a useful entry|pg||
nt|psyck: stopping low with a key card missing & the 3@d x|pg||
nt|haans: rersponder tend to make transfers all the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i dont really understand why east didnt dbl 3@D|pg||
nt|iceking: east should know dummy in 3@D dbl will hold most often 0-1@D and very few hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this might be a chance for the Swedes in the OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly left the door open.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nubmaster: They must continue @d after the 2 @c to take away the entrance to E|pg||
nt|psyck:  as usual, minor slams with borderline values tuf to get to|pg||
nt|yuval10: using a natural system it looks like 1NT - 2@c - 2@h  - 3@d and then N should lead the way with 3 keycards and a Q of trump|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|psyck: double dummy, you can reel off 8 tricks in the majors & squeeze South in the minors for the rest|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|gautis2: I told it was a close group a while ago, with 2 VP fom 1st to 3rd...  as we speak, it is actually thighter! (1 VP 1st-3rd :))|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wrong pitch, I think she needed @cK onside|pg||
nt|zebutin: discarded @C so doesnt have to take @C finese, but @D suit is so lousy they will not raise as any extra tricks, so needs Ax(x) in front of @D K|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|nubmaster: @d now or she makes|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|haans: even 1NT would have been transfer|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam bidding not the strength of the Finnish women in this match|pg||
nt|grebrof: last board was the first nonconquested auction NS had - EW are not known for being shut off|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|vugraphzdq: Vist Gunn says that she would have play different if she had get the correct information and then only loose one trick, so the result only would be down one|pg||
nt|grebrof: if any ladies form Faroe Islands are watching, I hope you soon come up with a team that can compete in this championships - there is a bye in the womens group - shich in my mind it ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: shouldnt|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Game over |pg||
nt|zebutin: ofcourse can still take @C finese if wants to, but little riskier|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  South will not hav to fear a singleton @C - in case, this would have been played earlier - and faster...|pg||
nt|derric: so E should lead @c after @hQ to remove choices|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|santyclz: Not knowing their system it's hard to assign responability but with akxxxx and 3 2nd round controls s seems to have gone quietly.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck:  or transfer to @d & bidding @s|pg||

mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: 3nt?|pg||

nt|haans: NS bidding right this far|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Another grand slam|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Two grands in nie hands. Good cardshufflers|pg||

nt|hawe45:  - and good bidders|pg||
nt|haans: would have preferred 3@H to 2|pg||
mb|4D|nt|zebutin: offshape overcall with 4cards, offshape x without 3rd @D...so many options for bidding...|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 1nt is 12-14. Last hand w opened 1nt with bal 13hcp|pg||
nt|ralfwil: dbl is 500|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|grebrof: never buy a thai keyboard - mainly I am guessing :D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The blockage in hearts is awkward for declarer in 5D|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: low score|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody steals from e.  5332 with a marginal (?) suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  You have to play some kind of Exclusion-blackwood to bid it. Very difficult|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @C (W) - 4 @H (E) - 5 NT - how difficult can you make it, Culbertsonour good old freind|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I exclude exclusion|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Board 6 is also misscored. Hopefully they will be corrected shortly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph lead is normal on the bidding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|derric: 1@c is 15+ i believe|pg||

nt|derric: i don't know if x is take-out|pg||
pc|d2|nt|grebrof: not sure I would have bid in these circumstnces anyway|pg||
pc|d9|nt|zebutin: seems like will lose atleast 3 @S, @D and @C...and cant raise @D suit either before has removed all trumps, and might lose control because of @C suit...|pg||
nt|zebutin: so needs some delicate play|pg||
nt|iceking: east should signal with @S K here|pg||
nt|haans: in scandinavia we all use reverse carding|pg||

nt|grebrof: not all|pg||

nt|cenglund:  This may be a huge swing|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: maybe worried @sK would suggest @d pref|pg||

pc|cA|nt|zebutin: this seems to be on road for atleast 1 down at this rate|pg||

nt|zebutin: and will opponents x or bid their own @C suit|pg||
nt|derric: prob 4|pg||
nt|iceking: been great action |pg||
nt|sharkey: the Norweigan girls bid the slam on Bd 24 - wd|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ianmcc: only worth 3@s|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hawe45:  The mistake(s) started with the 2 NT-bid - why not allready there bid 4 @C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  You get 4 @H from partner and bid 5 NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mbruun:  I think 4C directly after 2 Sp will show shortage|pg||
nt|haans: lucky them|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: so might be small gain to finns|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S have 3NT|pg||
nt|iceking: S will dbl 2@S i assume|pg||
nt|psyck: S may balance|pg||
nt|cenglund:  In the open room they played 3NT|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Without club lead 10 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: do assume they had no pen double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: now N might gamble on 3nt |pg||
nt|iceking: 3@D could be very wrong give pd like 14-16 hcp and 2-4-3-4 shape and he most likely will pass 3@D even playing leb|pg||
nt|iceking: i bet she will gamble on 3nt, been very agressive so far|pg||
nt|psyck: leb may not apply here anyway|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: can make a lot with majors favorable|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hawe45:  DoesÂ´nt matter - it forces East to show the suits with control, and 4 @H is a true dream to hear|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Thats true. Might work out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In my world, a doubleton is shortage|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|iceking: ok 3@H it is have to admit i was not thinking about 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: that is one bid no one could have guessed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not 4@s - at least -1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not off to a good start...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|derric: looks like lost 2@s 4@d 1@c in open|pg||
nt|zebutin: @D Q helped atleast 1 trick|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  3 rounds of @S - East discarding the @C Queen... voila!|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Thick single some players call it |pg||
nt|mbruun:  Any play for 3 NT here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mathias, please take a look at the defence, I just figured out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6-7 tricks N/S - or so|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@c and 2 aces|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Well I asked about 4@s last deal if it makes or not, the kibbs say yes and no :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: this contact is no party .. |pg||
nt|gautis2: but no double, no trouble..  probably 3 imps to Finland|pg||
nt|haans: @H5 cannot have the 8 or Q|pg||
nt|psyck: now dummy can be killed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course, there was no indication that @cs were so unevenly divided.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c should be a @d signal|pg||
pc|s4|nt|zebutin: and if now returns @D helps 1 more because ruffs winner anyway|pg||
nt|derric: and @d return now would help another|pg||
nt|iceking: another pick-up for iceland here|pg||
nt|grebrof: it is more than a party :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: @cs is just as good as any - or?|pg||
nt|sharkey: looking at all hands - yes...|pg||
nt|grebrof: well. you have 7cards in the suit and "maybe" an entrance|pg||
nt|haans: Harding do not want to play :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol - has to be a black suit I think|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mbruun:  Not the best start for defense|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|iceking: well judged from east here go low with good @S support|pg||
nt|gautis2: think T was a fail there...|pg||
nt|gautis2: may escape with 2 off|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|derric: though can try ruff the 4th anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ???|pg||
nt|haans: @SJ hoping|pg||
nt|haans: not as good|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Vores sidste kampe i dag, kl. 17.40, er Finland-Sverige Open og Norge-Danmark Damer. Yuval will translate for you|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|nt|mbruun:  But declarer can only come to eight tricks any way|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck: if could be a bigger pickup if this goes down, say if dec reads cards wrong|pg||
nt|psyck: well, not more confy ones @d's home|pg||
nt|ralfwil: shorten dummy with @s|pg||
nt|psyck: *now more|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, @s would have been better than @d there|pg||
nt|iceking: iam waiting for undo for this @D return|pg||
nt|psyck: lot of work still to do everywhere|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: a lot easier with all hands in view|pg||
nt|haans: 9 have the 8|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|yuval10: now it's making again, if South play @h to Ace then J@h discarding @c|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|santyclz: The @s return rather than a @d cost a fatal tempo.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|grebrof: brb - my woman went away on a "businesstrip", so I am doing the laundry . imagine! :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cenglund:  Not a good line of play|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|derric: 7imps to finns|pg||
nt|iceking: would have been better if decl had used her entry to play @C|pg||
nt|yuval10: something like final match today at 17:40 Final-Sweden? :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mbruun:  Forget the 10 IMPs for Denmark on board 8, and the 3 IMP for Norway on board 6. Difficulties in correcting these scores, but they are not right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so far-fetched for West to double 3 NT and take the 800 on a normal @S-lead. If you doÂ´nt now and then write 750 for the opponents, you havÂ´ent doubled enough|pg||
nt|mbruun:  The actual standing should be 20-16 for Norway|pg||
nt|gautis2: dont belive u:)|pg||
nt|haans: good play in spades|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yuval10: and Norway-Denmark ladies of course|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|iceking: how about @S King now|pg||
nt|yuval10: by the way Roland, my license is for Svensk only :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|sharkey: this time the @C was a winner - 1 trick difference|pg||
nt|haans: @HJ would have been tricker|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: de spelar ju bettre om ja är tyst|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  Ideen med risikable 4 NT direkte er, at man ofte vil vinde 6 @H, hvor modstanderne sÃ¥ efter spillet kan konstatere, at de havde 2 @S-stik...|pg||
nt|ballebodk: jeg synes det er helt rigtig meldt af øv - de mangler trumf dame og et es - altså 5 !|pg||

nt|haans: @D9 and off you go|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Declarer got the tricks that were within reach at the onset|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You did well, Yuval|pg||
nt|yuval10: :) tack|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: big chance for E/W|pg||
nt|haans: Big diamond 17+|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|derric: pass over 4@s by E wasn't good with 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|zebutin: cecilia didnt double with QJ1098 of spades when opponents were in 4@S...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Easy 12 tricks here in NT or @cs, let's see what Katrine and jessica will do|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S nat forcing|pg||
nt|sharkey: another slam possibility for the Finns...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another slam, this time a cold one|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 3@D ? invite to fullgame?|pg||
nt|iceking: most likely final result here 4@S |pg||
nt|yuval10: this hand should be interesting as well|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|psyck: with a few o/t's :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 26 HCP not every day....|pg||
nt|haans: and so we learn :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - we will see|pg||
nt|haans: Big Diamonds has its problems|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H not GF I think|pg||
nt|cenglund:  You shouldn't miss this one under any circumstances|pg||
nt|grebrof: allthou these are artificial bidders - it might not be so easy|pg||
nt|haans: Magic Diamonds comes from Carroy Clubs as natural as possible (possible)|pg||
nt|psyck: this should be easier to get also for E|pg||
nt|santyclz: A slam too good for Roland  but sub-par for the rest of us.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Off an ace and qjxx of trump.|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mbruun:  THis board wont take long. 450 for EW |pg||
nt|hawe45:  450 both tables, next|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s - at least on this board|pg||
nt|sharkey: as long as N can show @S support shud be in slam|pg||
nt|psyck: slam may still go down if bid, if dec played N for single @h honor|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|derric: what?|pg||
nt|zebutin: might be missing some pass somewhere...|pg||
nt|zebutin: maybe johanssen passed|pg||
nt|zebutin: Erkkilä bid 3@D|pg||
nt|zebutin: Andersson x:ed|pg||
nt|derric: possible|pg||
nt|zebutin: and Ahonen bid 3@H...|pg||
nt|zebutin: thats my quess|pg||
nt|zebutin: i see no way that this is the real bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: sorry, my misstake!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Can make 480 with @C-continuation|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We really hope, that the mis-scored boards will be changed before sundau at midnoght...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  sunday|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I'm going to change them after this rond!|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|grebrof: well - N doesnt have a lot to offer besides @s-support|pg||
nt|grebrof: did S show @S now?|pg||
nt|haans: step respone = four cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: well - thats all S needs...|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: on normal @C lead its possible win all the tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: it depends over the lead...if the lead is the natural @s lead then it looks like they should go for restricted choice|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|ralfwil: but after a @d lead...|pg||
nt|iceking: creative lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: ty Hans|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Even the grand one is making|pg||
nt|sharkey: S probing - shud keep in mind they have messed up all slams so far|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud this be affecting South now?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I am not saying you should be in 7|pg||
nt|haans: missing @HK they wont|pg||
nt|haans: have they forgotten steps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: After this start they will get to slam and make some imps here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice bidding so far:))|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|cenglund:  Probably a push board|pg||
nt|gautis2: 3N is reached..seems like a flat board |pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: if the lead isn't @s then you can still make it if the hand with 3 @h's also have 3 @d's|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3/5th against suit :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: follow with @dQ|pg||
nt|iceking: unbid suit |pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sQ is a keycard|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|grebrof: well, its only one board they lost in a slam position - N could hardly do anymore than 4@s now|pg||
nt|grebrof: well done by S|pg||
nt|sharkey: N thinking 7?????|pg||
nt|sharkey: extras :)?|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe its Marianne in E|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hardly - I think|pg||
nt|haans: maybe asking about bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Now 12 tricks possible - in fact easy, South beeing caught in a show-up-squeeze|pg||
nt|nubmaster: The Icelandic kibbs are hoping for the grand, lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: @d ruff will set up a trump trick for only 1 o/t|pg||
nt|grebrof: she likes to think - which is the reason she is in this team :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  I need to leave now, by all|pg||
nt|grebrof: by Christer|pg||
nt|grebrof: or bye - again my thai keyboard tricks me|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@d was asking for singelton, 4@c denied|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|gautis2: may get 10?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|psyck: if 4@s was cue, i'd have expected E to bid slam even missing 1 key card|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|ralfwil: claim 12....|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Now tactically should w play against restricted choice, hoping the slam fails?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzdq: now the director is here, because W got the wrong explanision, but know they decided to wait until afterwards|pg||
pc|h8|nt|grebrof: the last board - looked more of a success playing the @c K at trick 1 - the trumpswitch wasnt a winner|pg||

mb|5S|nt|zebutin: 12-14 notrump...but they seem to stop at reasonable level still...most likely wont make, but atleast its not in red...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@c is like Gazzilli, strong (any) or nat with @cs|pg||

nt|gautis2: oh..4 @c solved all problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  4H/S should be quite easy to reach, and nothing in the play. Dull board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  12-14 tror jeg|pg||
nt|cenglund:  5C depends on 1 successful finesse and DA onside, I wouldnt't stretch my luck that much|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: but it's rather hard to inquier.... 5@d from N would probably be natural|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|zebutin: 2@S is 4@S + 5@C 11-16|pg||
nt|grebrof: did you have that 31hp-count in Bergen in 2005?|pg||
nt|gautis2: after 2@c I wonder where this will end|pg||
nt|grebrof: 6@cs? hmmm|pg||
nt|yuval10: Finland impressive indeed, against one of the best Ladies' team in Europe who will also represent Europe in the upcomming Venice Cup|pg||

mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|iceking: agressive 1@H|pg||
nt|psyck: hmm, NS don't need much to keep the bidding opn apparently|pg||
mb|1N|nt|derric: is north thinking the hand isn't 11-16 anymore?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N can see the discard on @cK, so I can´t see any reason to return anything else but @d|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3nt?|pg||
nt|gautis2: 3@c = bid 3@d if 20-21 NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: its a bad hand in some ways N too - how to show 3 suits after 2@c?|pg||
nt|gautis2: i vote for 1@s opening, but .. :)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  5C seems the best game spot|pg||
nt|grebrof: easier when you see dummy :)|pg||
nt|haans: pass = 0-7|pg||
nt|haans: by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Since 2 D is forcing after 2-o-1, 3D is a Splinter. Similar to the first board, where 2D would have been reverse and strong, so 3D is therefore Splinter  |pg||
nt|mbruun:  3 NT seems to be the evident bid|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Unless she thinks 3D is 55 and strong|pg||
nt|derric: or east protecting?|pg||
nt|grebrof: if bal|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iceking: possible 3 down here|pg||

mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Thats what happened. Misunderstanding NS|pg||
nt|pelu: why not X from W to show both black suits?|pg||
nt|iceking: or 2@D|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: they might not play 2 suited overcalls here|pg||
nt|santyclz: To watch multiple tables:  www.bridgebase.com/mobile  Open 1 browser window/table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Or maybe she thinks her hand is good enough for a cuebid. |pg||
nt|mbruun:  Well see|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Board 13 - always difficult|pg||
nt|zebutin: @C Q is sitting nicely, so most likely this wont be any gain for either team...if doesnt try double finese in @S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: My friend came here ti visit me about deal 24 and then the Swedes has make very good. Think he's better than a "hartass" :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3nt it is|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s lead is the best|pg||
nt|gautis2: bet a coke for a heart lead:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: this time, no long suit|pg||
nt|psyck: this could be another swing if they get to a @c contract other table|pg||

pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Last stop for a +-score|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I have been told, that 6 @C is possible - would you make it Mathias??|pg||
nt|mbruun:  North cant raise without heartcontrol, unless partner hesitates before 5 C. In that case director will be called and the score will be corrected if slam is on. So North did the right thing|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it seems right, probably South will make the 12 tricks here also|pg||
nt|mbruun:  I think 6C is lay down with S K onside. Five spadetricks, six clubtricks and the DA|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Five clubs in hand and a diamond ruff. Shoudnt represent any troubles|pg||
nt|mbruun:  A sneaky spadelead will keep this to 11|pg||
nt|mbruun:  The king might not work|pg||
nt|iceking: have a feeling this will make now|pg||
nt|grebrof: 4@h tricks?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gautis2: this might give 4 tricks in @h!|pg||
nt|haans: clubs a problem|pg||
mc|10|nt|pelu: in the "good old days" I would bid 1NT = both unbid suist, but to dau where u open on 9-10 and bid og 3-4 u need 1NT to be strong :)|pg||

nt|zebutin: you can use 3rd @C as connection and come back with @D A to hand to cash rest of @C|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Jessicas opening here will get NS off from the bad 3NT contract|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mbruun:  Might consider a spadeovercall with the West hand. Obvious in pairs in my opinion|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But they found the 44 fit in @ds, but a good lead here by S, it will make anyway|pg||
nt|grebrof: 11-16, but ok|pg||

nt|sharkey: what if pd has 11?|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  2 @S should be the normal contract now|pg||

nt|derric: just checked|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 3N by S now will help|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 2nt S 3@H north and 4@D from S |pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@h minimum|pg||
nt|gautis2: 2@his a weak support, so I guess they will stop in time|pg||
nt|grebrof: ?|pg||
nt|grebrof: nice distribution S has :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: 2@d shows a good raise (after pass)|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure when they actually show a 5carder|pg||
nt|sharkey: If 1@S is 8-11 why doesn't N just bid where she wants to be instead of giving EW information?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: this might even be a slam :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: i didnt read page 84, but I guess 3@c is minimum:)|pg||

nt|santyclz: Thanks Bertil.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mbruun:  2 Sp is the best partscore here. 1NT is one off with careful defense|pg||

pc|h5|nt|iceking: but just dreaming this hand is just one of those you cant reach slam playing natural methods|pg||
nt|sharkey: they may have to work to make this...|pg||

nt|grebrof: normally contested auctions are harder than where you "live in free", but board 30 seemed otherwise - 10 imps to Norway|pg||
