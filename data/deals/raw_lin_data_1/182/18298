mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: So true -- so often with such hands the only effect will be to guarantee pd's lead of the suit, here you have no reason to put your eggs in that basket.|pg||

nt|jcwla: E has nothing to say and S will respond first in 1@S holding 5-5 in the majors.|pg||

nt|jcwla: Now S is in a bit of a predicament but will probably rebid 2@H.|pg||

nt|kirp:  May not have to, if you lead the 10|pg||

nt|jcwla: Now it is possible to have a couple of agreements here, one is Lebensohl.|pg||

nt|jimkrek: it wd be piggy to bid this now-after the upgrade-but signs point to it|pg||
nt|jimkrek: all controls|pg||
nt|kfung: think 6D is the right bid now|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|kfung: oink oink|pg||
nt|jimkrek: is that what canadians pigs say? |pg||
nt|kirp:  think S gave him a lot of room to get out|pg||
nt|kirp:  not sure I would have with good 12|pg||
nt|jfeld:  in situations like this I often play, a suit at the 5 level is a 5 card suit, 6 level is a 6 card suit, and 5NT asks for 4 card suits up the line|pg||
nt|jfeld:  (over a quantitative 4nt)|pg||
nt|kirp:  6D has good chances|pg||
nt|jimkrek: has to avoid club lead or its over|pg||
nt|kirp:  ruff out the club Q 3rd|pg||
nt|kfung: so north south on Board 28 got a little carried away to 3NT|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|kirp:  or spade A onside, not bad slam|pg||

nt|kfung: i believe dan thought it may be a 5 card suit... |pg||
nt|kirp:  reasonable assumtion|pg||
nt|jimkrek: while s has no ruffing value surely he will need diamonds...and diamonds has the ruffing flexibility|pg||
nt|kfung: i play 5 level is 4 card suits and 6 level is 5 card suits|pg||
nt|kirp:  so with 7 bagger?|pg||
nt|kfung: 3NT is being played at other table so this will be huge either way|pg||
