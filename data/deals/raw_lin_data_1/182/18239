nt|Walddk2: Here is one more|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C looks a good spot for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is a good game, 5@C even better, but ...|pg||
mb|2N|an|!s raise|nt|roswolf: indeed impossible to reach perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: 6 will make on a good day|pg||
nt|roswolf: south bids 3@C?|pg||
mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  surely 4@h does not make if the there is a trump lead or switch|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: xxx@s looks good|pg||
nt|roswolf: DBL looks murky to me|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He hs not made this yet|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he plays a club now he goes down|pg||
nt|jtr: He wont do that|pg||
nt|roswolf: shouldnt he simply play on x-ruff lines?|pg||
nt|jtr: Question of whether to ruff out the @hs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: must go for hearts to start|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He wont do that|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jtr: He played for @cs to break or the ruffing @h finesse|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems reasonable to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not particularly likely is that|pg||
nt|roswolf: trumps breaking i mean|pg||
nt|jtr: East didnt splinter as he might|pg||
nt|ady: surely must play hearts first to bring down the king  using top clubs as entries   almost impossible to go down unless clubs 4-0|pg||
nt|jtr: Would that have worked?|pg||
nt|jtr: I think not|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with the devalued @hK, perhpas East did not think he was worth a 4@c splinter|pg||
nt|jtr: He bid game anyway|pg||
nt|ady: heart ruff a heart  cash A@D  discard spade  club to king and ruff a heart  if overruffed   then clubs coming down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  indeed :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Has to ruff 3 @hs|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe i am sleepy|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@c entries one @s ruff and 3@h ruffs =6|pg||
nt|jtr: maybe a @d ruff suffices|pg||
nt|ady: heart straight away    ruff a heart  cash A@D   go to top club   ruff a heart   go to other top club   ruff a heart   ruff a diamond   then run hearts?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: open room gets the comparisons :(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the poor club suit again|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|nt|pjs_ch: presumably 1@D here shows spades, although that's not what their CC says|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: yes, explained as such by Mike Ash|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: best fit unmentioned here - the downside of a strong club system|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and what shows hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: uh oh|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: but the heart pips are really good so only one loser in that suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: TD intervenes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: People sat in wrong chairs, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Play suspended, TD goes to check the Open Room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That explains a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Players think they're in the right chairs, Open Room wrong?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: was it the last european where england was sitting wrongly and it wasnt discovered till the end of the set?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: that will give commentators time to calculate if 4@h makes, if he's allowed to play it!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: The director on the ball this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Director is Mike Amos (Open Room), wife Sarah attending this room|pg||
