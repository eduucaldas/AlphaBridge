nt|ralfwil: hello again!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me a new swedish pair Jessica Larsson and Katherine Bertheau|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Hi all|pg||
nt|nubmaster: And hi Ralf|pg||
nt|grebrof: Norway are playing Finland,,,|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|grebrof: hello Carl|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|iceking: welcome|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thanks Magnus!|pg||
nt|grebrof: hello, and welcome to this 5th match in the Nordic championships for women|pg||
nt|haans: 1 or 2 level?|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Hans & Espen|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|zebutin: good day for everyone watching|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|grebrof: Norway is the defending champions from Lillehammer 2007 and they are also the current leaders|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Carl|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|haans: 8 tricks 9th in clubs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: interestingly they they have typed some of finnish players first names too, so from finland there are playing Pia Erkkilä and Hulda Ahonen, pair that plays strong club (15+)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: also welcome to Magnus|pg||
mb|3N|nt|grebrof: the norwegians are playing a natural system with 5 card majors - the finnish girls prefer a strong (+15hp) 1@c|pg||
nt|sharkey: live update of scores & standings: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=475&csm=Rank&nt=3&nb=17&csh=0000000000111|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Frisk start med en oplagt slem...|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: S took a rather passive view here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W can perhaps see, that 1@d is bid on a 4-card suit, so a small from dummy|pg||
nt|iceking: not sure i could play def vs 2@H here, though bidding is little strange also as you are not sure you have fitt anywere|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Gautis|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: hello, and good morning:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: He may be a bit biassed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wife playing as South|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is the winning contract - espescially now with the natural @d-lead from E|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  Kunne Ãst ikke have overmeldt med 4 Ru?|pg||
nt|grebrof: the norwegians are naturalists (besides the bery weak NT in nonvul 1st-3rd) opposite the more artificial approach from the finnish|pg||
nt|haans: finns Magic Diamond?|pg||
nt|grebrof: I have thai keyboard, so there is a chance for mistyping - bery = very|pg||
nt|haans: yes close for me 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: these two plays magid diamond . the other pair strong @c|pg||
nt|sharkey: I have the same problem Espen - not Thai but Thumbs....|pg||
nt|grebrof: lol|pg||
nt|grebrof: I will try to look before I post|pg||
nt|grebrof: back to the game...|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt  a make|pg||
nt|grebrof: this ended in a draw 15-15VP last meeting|pg||
nt|sharkey: Marianne Harding and Ann Karin Fuglestad are the anchor pair of the Norwegian team - many years international experience|pg||
nt|grebrof: duck a @D is a loser if @ds are QJ block, but will make 9 tricks anyhow|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c9|nt|gautis2: figure i still not know her well enoghe since i dont have a clue what 3@h means:)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|iceking: was no rush for Ace of @D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  Hi - mys danish were just the daily exercises...|pg||
nt|iceking: low would keep better control af everything|pg||
nt|sharkey: undo?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|grebrof: Stine has had some very good results, so its about time she got her chance for the national team (gautis being biased or not)|pg||
nt|grebrof: she is NOT playing with you now my friend :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2NT may be with 5 hearts so bidding an error|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|zebutin: different openings from 1st/2nd hand and 3rd/4th for finnish pair, but from 1st and 2nd they play weak nt, and 1@D-1@S openings are 10-14 and 4card suit|pg||
nt|gautis2: :) ..well, cant argue with sucess, since 4@s was born to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=475&csm=Rank&nt=3&nb=1&csh=0000000000111|pg||
nt|Walddk5: running scores|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes - Harding - Fuglestad also was part of the team that won last time at Lillehammer in 2007|pg||
nt|cenglund:  SpA was hardly discarded|pg||
nt|sharkey: She really pitched @SA on @C lead operator?|pg||
nt|haans: spade ace|pg||
nt|haans: on lead|pg||
mc|11|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: Finland 2009 was the last championships I am told (thanks Geo) - looking at the unions homepage, you might get tricked|pg||

nt|psyck: Hi Magnus & Ralf|pg||
nt|haans: small spade from E|pg||
mb|2D|nt|zebutin: and if some pairs card interests you http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.2354|pg||
nt|zebutin: has convention card for all players it seems|pg||
nt|grebrof: Gunn Tove was in the winning team in 2007 - then partnering Siv Thoresen who is by many considered being the best female player in Norway. for the first time in many years (dont ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: know hom many), she is not in the bracket this time|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|hawe45:  Anyway, ti was easier to play than to bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: good start for Norway avoiding the impossible 4@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: some kind of Multi...|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 1nt 15-17 from 3rd hand|pg||
nt|haans: easy make in 3nt at last board|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@s on NS|pg||
nt|iceking: good slam here |pg||
nt|iceking: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|grebrof: the +15 @c comes into action|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pass or Correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: lot of options for S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They finished in 5@c last deal in open after some relay bids with 3 rounds of @h for -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: chose drury|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@C probably one way drury|pg||
nt|sharkey: If N can find a take out x now....|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@d showing a good opening with at least game interest|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D real opening,as i play myself here i would bid 3@D with north hand natural and slammish|pg||
nt|nubmaster: So a good start for Sweden here|pg||
nt|gautis2: partscore battle|pg||
nt|grebrof: as a guess I would think the dbl of 1@h from E is 5-7hp - their card says nothing about what "neg dbls" are|pg||
nt|gautis2: i guess x shows hp s not @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@d a nice treatment there Magnus|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 3D/3H transfer nodays 3@C just showing max|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ianmcc: 4@h seems to need to find @dQ, tho 4th @s could be useful|pg||
pc|h2|nt|zebutin: in 4@H you would seem to lose 2 @S + @C, because spades are 3-3 you can throw one diamond to 4th spade|pg||
nt|zebutin: so might not need to quess diamond suit|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room finnish women played 2@S some down, there is magic diamond system in effect, that has 8-11 openings in 1st and 2nd hand, so makes often for different scores|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is a very good contract for NS|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck: N will likely blast to slam in spite of missing a keycard|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Anyone who can tell us about the bidding here? 2NT like good/bad NT or something?|pg||
nt|haans: thats a "modern" weak 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl from N is good seing the layout|pg||
pc|dT|nt|derric: good morning|pg||
pc|d3|nt|iceking: W made a very light 3rd seat opening in open room|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mbruun:  THis aggressive lead will cost the defense a trick, and HQ another one, so all of a sudden nine tricks turned to eleven. No big deal in teams though |pg||
nt|haans: scoring blood|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder what 5@s here was|pg||
nt|iceking: 4nt might be even number of aces |pg||
nt|psyck: oh Turbo|pg||
nt|iceking: at least it looks like it |pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably negative|pg||
nt|iceking: been told 4nt shows 3+aces|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, not Turbo then, just their own methods|pg||
nt|iceking: nicely done anyway |pg||
nt|nubmaster: well done here, both K and J in @s works so no trouble with Q of @h offside|pg||
nt|gautis2: not fan of 4@h  ..better to do an invitasional bid after 2@s ...not this "shot"|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is sometimes the problem with strong 1@c - in a contested auction like this, you dont always know if 2@s is a bid with 4 or 5 @ss - now they escaped|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe...|pg||
nt|sharkey: may escape with down 2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|zebutin: good day Juho, its allready 14.00 in finland...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Juho, 2100 in Melbourne|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks and next|pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like one loser in each suit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|gautis2: y, should  be 200|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|psyck: after Souths free bid & jump to 4@s, N could have also bid slam other table, but was tougher after opps intervention i guess|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|mbruun:  Back to nine again. Interesting|pg||
nt|gautis2: board 1 was a coopy of 3NT, so well done to both teams|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|grebrof: otherwise I agree with not bidding 4@h (allthou it looks like P has a single @s) but P only made a single raise - guess they have ways to show a better raise - well, the ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: vulnerability is "right", so can understand 4@h too|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: best defense|pg||
pc|d8|nt|nubmaster: In Open Marie and Pia get to 4@h which seems to be doomed, especially when E lead a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was a bad play. return @cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and defence will have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not finessing @h first round... doesn't matter if E got the Q alone... E indicates both A and Q of @s because of the play|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|iceking: 1@S in closed room was the problem, for sure S should have bidded more powerful bid then 1@S|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d2|pc|s3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: Jessica missed their chance|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes|pg||
pc|d5|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|gautis2: FInland bought 2@h in OR, so this willbe 7 imps to Finland..edit: 11 imps, 2 down|pg||
nt|gautis2: ..12 :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: thank god the BBO is helping us :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: is there a break?  (catfight? :) )|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: the director is coming here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Visst|pg||
nt|grebrof: viewing all 4 hands is sometimes a snag, cause you never know what they be thinking - pauses that might make a difference at the table are not always felt the same way by us|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: the Norweigen girls are asking about their bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont know the finnish strengt in a catfight, but I guess the norwegians are mediocre there :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: pherhaps 2@s bid is explained as something else?  Cant see the line of play if it is "as it is"|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont think N has a case here|pg||
nt|gautis2: i do.. :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down|pg||
pc|cT|nt|grebrof: this was not the best|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ianmcc: well done|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, good shape, decent 5 carder, & useful touching honors in @c|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah - but as I said more than once in the first match between these: it is easier seeing all hands|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mbruun:  I suppose 2D is a very light Multi, but Im not sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt be surprised, if East bids 3 NT here|pg||
nt|derric: pass by north?|pg||
nt|derric: i think they play precision|pg||
nt|zebutin: some would bid too, A + J109x seem quite nice values...no support for partner though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wondering. But not much for East - West|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@s was certainly possible|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - we will see|pg||
nt|sharkey: i think the hand was open then Espen - shud have read the ending|pg||
nt|haans: little weak for 3@H|pg||
nt|grebrof: the contract is wrong and there are more failures that awaits when you are there|pg||
nt|grebrof: normal frisky nonul opening from S|pg||
nt|sharkey: that is a WEAK 3@H....|pg||
nt|grebrof: I like it|pg||
nt|sharkey: been there - done that...:)|pg||
nt|haans: she had no perfect bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: N thinking slam?|pg||
nt|grebrof: as they said about Marty Bergens preempts like that: "It doesnt matter what you have, its still not good enough"|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mbruun:  Sounds reasonable|pg||

nt|gautis2: victory |pg||
nt|gautis2: good to stop...system victory|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Ahonen has quite bad values for balancing at red zone, even though has decent 6 card suit...but risks are quite high|pg||

nt|psyck: bot at this vul maybe|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No comments...|pg||

pc|sK|nt|iceking: option ofcourse but will catch very bad dummy and on best def will go for 1100|pg||
nt|haans: and spade lead?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Guess she asked for it - now just make it....|pg||
nt|grebrof: this CAN make|pg||
nt|haans: home if hearts better|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ianmcc: when she doesn't balance it argues bad spades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh dear... system error|pg||
nt|grebrof: N showing 20-21hp|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - East wanted to know, which major South had, before bidding 3 NT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Here you'd like to play canapé, first showing 4c @s and then longer @d but there's no room for that|pg||
nt|grebrof: the good @c-suit being the missing hp|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I bet she is not going to make it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gautis2: y, fair upgrade|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|nubmaster: They play transfer bids over 1@c, ie 1@d=@h etc...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Careful defense will hold this to nine tricks, if South ducks heart in trick 2|pg||
nt|psyck: not a good start for Iceland|pg||
nt|iceking: might be the worsed possible dummy W could get|pg||
nt|iceking: now @D return and 4 down for 1100|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but major suit wastages were known on bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but couldn´t W suspect bad @s honours on E?|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Christer|pg||
nt|haans: yep my money on that 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is always a wrong line, but ok|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  Alsowithout ducking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if 1@h shows @s - why not bid the 6-card @d?|pg||

nt|derric: is north's hand unbal or did she upgrade to 12-13 bal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely|pg||

nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: NS are one of the best women pair in europe, been pdship for man years. Icelandic pair has less experience in international events|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: cards well placed here for a few o/t's|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: Dbl = 3 @H|pg||
nt|haans: dbl = 3 spades (sipport doubles more and more popular)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  2 down on a @S-lead, it seems|pg||

nt|ianmcc: @h and @c friendly|pg||
nt|gautis2: wd Finland, and they have a great start of this game!|pg||
nt|grebrof: reversing with  a single was not the best idea from Marianne Harding it seems|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  In fact, the North hand is no so strong - the @DÂ´s doubtful values|pg||
nt|mbruun:  With no aces you should subtract 1 HCP from the hand. Good intermediates are a plus on the other side|pg||
nt|gautis2: seems like a not agreed auction in OR|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe she wanted to bid 3@h :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure splinters with only 3card support is the best, but I am not playing this event :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Sure - but the @D-doubleton is not so great|pg||

nt|mbruun:  Im a little concerned that I agree with you, about the bidding I mean |pg||
nt|ianmcc: close to a slam|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hawe45:  7 @S would have been a better bid than 5!|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Very difficult for NS to get to the grand. I predict EW will buy it in 6 S X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But this might work - and West will not "sell out"|pg||
nt|zebutin: more or less clear 4@H... but if they feel bold they might even shoot for 6@H...|pg||

mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Impressive|pg||
nt|mbruun:  West knows 7 Sp is good insurance, but always difficult to save in a hot aucton like this. She should do it right I think  |pg||

pc|h5|nt|derric: pessimistic|pg||

nt|psyck: that made S's choice easier, esp with vul game at stake|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Mikael G told me that the operator is new and are in training so we will have some allowance here... and she has no time to comment|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Heart lead is the killer|pg||
nt|grebrof: the small cards in dummy makes it easier to overtake the Q too, cause there are many layout where N will have a @h-suit good enough for it to run later|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  No RD, please, that would loose 2 IMPÂ´s to 2140|pg||

nt|cenglund:  I can't understand S's reasoning. The board is like an open book|pg||
nt|haans: @HK Big|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|grebrof: sometimes running your winners will squeese your opponents - can be a good strategy even if you dont have enough tricks to begin with too|pg||
nt|sharkey: N shud hardly have Ax in @C as wud overtake and return 1. trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@S 17+|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|zebutin: what to bid on Johanssons 2@H ?|pg||
nt|gautis2: 500 is a good score.. 4@h seems like few loosers, but not enough winners?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can they bid the slam?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 0-7|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 3@d|pg||
nt|iceking: should have no problems stop in 4@H here|pg||
nt|psyck: 5 level is safe too i guess|pg||
nt|iceking: would be good to have 3@H forcing here |pg||
nt|nubmaster: If 2NT shows the red suits why not start with 4@h and then 5@d? But N took it for the minors because of the fact that the 1@c opening is 2+?|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|grebrof: I guess without the @s lead, you can possibly make some @d-tricks, but|pg||
nt|haans: system works well here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - think they'll bid slam|pg||
nt|haans: but Blackwwod a problem = 2 keys missing|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|iceking: and that is logical if bypass @D with marginal canape hands|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h will now be frcd after 4th suit bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but 4@d will also do and after 4@h = no @s control|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Forcing?|pg||
nt|gautis2: this play will take sometime..belive me:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Denmark gained 7 IMP on board 5, because South unblocked her AK of hearts in due time, so 7 Sp X was five off|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a happy spot|pg||
nt|zebutin: well no double... seems like 2 down or something|pg||
nt|grebrof: I assume the 5 from E|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they play count when Q is at the table|pg||
nt|gautis2: not best lead.. may make now|pg||
nt|haans: yep 0-7 is 0-7|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: so 3@H and now S will deny @S control so should end in 4@H|pg||
nt|iceking: Danish que-bidding style is though little odd at least i have never understood it|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S shows interest in slam perhaps N shud be able to bid it based on @H length and max|pg||
nt|grebrof: Magic Diamond comes from Sweden originally, but many play it in  Finland too - they are more artificial in Sweden-Finland than we are in Norway-Denmark - I have myself sat down ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: that 1@c meant either a) 5-11hp any suit or b) 17hp+ any distribution - conventions like that are not allowed in Norway, but it is fun, isnt it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: East are at the bathroom|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The play of the Finnish ladies has been mildly put rather sloppy|pg||
nt|haans: i do assume they would not bid 1@H with A+K|pg||
nt|grebrof: when do you get to go, Johanna?|pg||
nt|haans: 52% slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be S or N shud have made more efforts here....|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|iceking: undo|pg||
nt|gautis2: ..but a fair normal lead|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Spade must be attacked otherwise diamonds will be established|pg||
nt|grebrof: curiousity is always there with AK in a suit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psyck: we see what you mean Magnus :)|pg||
nt|iceking: so 3@S could maybe ask for @S control |pg||
nt|iceking: Danish asking bid i think they call it|pg||
nt|gautis2: God have given u an ace for one reason...take it!|pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: can not make Blackwood|pg||
mc|12|nt|mbruun:  Difficult lead for West, and DK is natural but unfortunate|pg||

nt|sharkey: North had a 6 card fit which she hadnt shown|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The 6th heart is valuable|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Yes  - but after a slow start|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This looks like a coffee-board for 420 N/S|pg||
nt|mbruun:  4 Sp seems to be the spot, and its a very natural contract|pg||
nt|psyck: they have to be careful not to get too high here with cards unfav|pg||

mb|1H!|mb|1S|nt|zebutin: 2@D most likely multi|pg||

nt|iceking: slam makes |pg||
mb|2D|nt|nubmaster: In open the Icelandic ended up in 5@d|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|zebutin: Johansson has many quick tricks in hand, so didnt want to bid lame 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: or east could maybe dbl 3@D here |pg||
mb|4H|nt|iceking: 3@D looks alot down 5-6 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  North will raise to three, and a well placed DK will make South go to game|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Ah, started to write that before it showed up on the screen, sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 1@c +15hp|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1@s balanced +9 or 4441|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 3@s is presumably preempting|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 8-11 ? really?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gautis2: did we get the result  of board 2 Johanna?  |pg||
nt|cenglund:  This a better slam than the previous one|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ianmcc: some prospects|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room they got to open 1@H telling 4+ @H and 8-11...and after that sailed to 3nt|pg||
nt|derric: 3NT went down after declarer broke entries in open|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Cards are not lying in favour of making 6NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|zebutin: this lead destroys one entry to @C suit, but give ruffing finese in @S suit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gautis2: and they figure it out, so a  stop...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finnish ladies avoided the tempation|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I think the director chosed to let it be (4heartsx-2), but I'm not shore!|pg||
nt|grebrof: not that I can see EW doing something viable over 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may have bid 4@S with West hand - but 5332 distribution is a negative|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|zebutin: so if takes that, she is losing 2@D + @H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Maybe 4@s here|pg||
nt|gautis2: ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: I wouldnt change that board 2 either|pg||
nt|grebrof: but ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: not the best lead here|pg||
nt|grebrof: if there is any|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nubmaster: good bid|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ianmcc: it removes a useful entry|pg||
nt|psyck: stopping low with a key card missing & the 3@d x|pg||
nt|haans: rersponder tend to make transfers all the time|pg||
pc|h7|nt|iceking: i dont really understand why east didnt dbl 3@D|pg||
nt|iceking: east should know dummy in 3@D dbl will hold most often 0-1@D and very few hcp|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nubmaster: They must continue @d after the 2 @c to take away the entrance to E|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psyck: double dummy, you can reel off 8 tricks in the majors & squeeze South in the minors for the rest|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|gautis2: I told it was a close group a while ago, with 2 VP fom 1st to 3rd...  as we speak, it is actually thighter! (1 VP 1st-3rd :))|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ianmcc: wrong pitch, I think she needed @cK onside|pg||
nt|zebutin: discarded @C so doesnt have to take @C finese, but @D suit is so lousy they will not raise as any extra tricks, so needs Ax(x) in front of @D K|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nubmaster: @d now or she makes|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: even 1NT would have been transfer|pg||

nt|haans: i would not have opened 1@H = no opening only 8-11 hcp|pg||

mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: 3nt?|pg||

nt|haans: NS bidding right this far|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hawe45:  Another grand slam|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Two grands in nie hands. Good cardshufflers|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: yes the last one was misscored, it was equal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and good bidders|pg||
nt|haans: would have preferred 3@H to 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: offshape overcall with 4cards, offshape x without 3rd @D...so many options for bidding...|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 1nt is 12-14. Last hand w opened 1nt with bal 13hcp|pg||
nt|ralfwil: dbl is 500|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@H is some bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: no hcp no shape no controls |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|grebrof: never buy a thai keyboard - mainly I am guessing :D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The blockage in hearts is awkward for declarer in 5D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: low score|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mbruun:  You have to play some kind of Exclusion-blackwood to bid it. Very difficult|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @C (W) - 4 @H (E) - 5 NT - how difficult can you make it, Culbertsonour good old freind|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I exclude exclusion|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Board 6 is also misscored. Hopefully they will be corrected shortly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph lead is normal on the bidding|pg||
pc|sT|nt|derric: 1@c is 15+ i believe|pg||
nt|zebutin: but i think they have some bid over strong @C that tells majors, so even that could have been option...|pg||
nt|derric: i don't know if x is take-out|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure I would have bid in these circumstnces anyway|pg||
pc|h9|nt|zebutin: seems like will lose atleast 3 @S, @D and @C...and cant raise @D suit either before has removed all trumps, and might lose control because of @C suit...|pg||
nt|zebutin: so needs some delicate play|pg||
nt|iceking: east should signal with @S K here|pg||
nt|haans: in scandinavia we all use reverse carding|pg||
pc|hA|nt|grebrof: not all|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mbruun:  In the Open series, the Danish West, HC Graversen lead the HA to beat 3 NT by one on board 6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I doÂ´nt know heir system (either) - but 4 @C from West instead of 3 @H would have been better|pg||
nt|cenglund:  This may be a huge swing|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe worried @sK would suggest @d pref|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1@c opening in the other room contains a whole lot of diffferent stuff, so not that strange that lead wasnt found|pg||
nt|gautis2: yes, will be 11 imps to Norway|pg||
nt|grebrof: allthou I do prefer it|pg||

nt|mbruun:  It seems strange to give up the investigations|pg||
nt|iceking: yes probably thinking about that|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nubmaster: I think 4@s will make so 5@h will probablu be correct... anyone to analyse if 4@s can be set?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|cenglund:  Defence can't afford a slightest slip |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|zebutin: this seems to be on road for atleast 1 down at this rate|pg||
nt|zebutin: but with @C return is able to raise @C suit, so defence needs to be sharp too|pg||
nt|derric: 4 black suit ruffs and @DAK@hAK would make 8|pg||
nt|sharkey: Marianne had a difficult decision over 4@S - 5@D not a winner this time as 4@S wud have failed|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s4|pc|d9|nt|mbruun:  How about 5D after 4c. When partner shows two aces bid 5 N and partner will cuebid 6 H which will get them to the grand. Maybe they have other agreements of course|pg||

nt|mbruun:  Thick single some players call it |pg||
nt|mbruun:  Any play for 3 NT here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mathias, please take a look at the defence, I just figured out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6-7 tricks N/S - or so|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: 2@c and 2 aces|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Well I asked about 4@s last deal if it makes or not, the kibbs say yes and no :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: this contact is no party .. |pg||
nt|gautis2: but no double, no trouble..  probably 3 imps to Finland|pg||
nt|haans: @H5 cannot have the 8 or Q|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|zebutin: and if now returns @D helps 1 more because ruffs winner anyway|pg||
nt|derric: and @d return now would help another|pg||
nt|iceking: another pick-up for iceland here|pg||
nt|grebrof: it is more than a party :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: @cs is just as good as any - or?|pg||
nt|sharkey: looking at all hands - yes...|pg||
nt|grebrof: well. you have 7cards in the suit and "maybe" an entrance|pg||
nt|haans: Harding do not want to play :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol - has to be a black suit I think|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mbruun:  Not the best start for defense|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|iceking: well judged from east here go low with good @S support|pg||
nt|gautis2: think T was a fail there...|pg||
nt|gautis2: may escape with 2 off|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|derric: though can try ruff the 4th anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ???|pg||

nt|haans: not as good|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|mbruun:  But declarer can only come to eight tricks any way|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: if could be a bigger pickup if this goes down, say if dec reads cards wrong|pg||
nt|psyck: well, not more confy ones @d's home|pg||
nt|ralfwil: shorten dummy with @s|pg||
nt|psyck: *now more|pg||

nt|iceking: iam waiting for undo for this @D return|pg||
nt|psyck: lot of work still to do everywhere|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sharkey: a lot easier with all hands in view|pg||
nt|haans: 9 have the 8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|grebrof: brb - my woman went away on a "businesstrip", so I am doing the laundry . imagine! :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cenglund:  Not a good line of play|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|derric: 7imps to finns|pg||
nt|iceking: would have been better if decl had used her entry to play @C|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Forget the 10 IMPs for Denmark on board 8, and the 3 IMP for Norway on board 6. Difficulties in correcting these scores, but they are not right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so far-fetched for West to double 3 NT and take the 800 on a normal @S-lead. If you doÂ´nt now and then write 750 for the opponents, you havÂ´ent doubled enough|pg||
nt|mbruun:  The actual standing should be 20-16 for Norway|pg||
nt|gautis2: dont belive u:)|pg||
nt|haans: good play in spades|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|d6|nt|iceking: how about @S King now|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sharkey: this time the @C was a winner - 1 trick difference|pg||
nt|haans: @HJ would have been tricker|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c6|nt|haans: @SJ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  Wake-up call - it would be difficult for East to discard the @C Queen on the third @S-round - as East must follow suit|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes,this was not good play (or after the @HK) not good defense either|pg||
nt|sharkey: off 2 cud very well be copied OR|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|iceking: now east should fallow with @H 9|pg||

mb|3H|nt|mbruun:  Since 2 D is forcing after 2-o-1, 3D is a Splinter. Similar to the first board, where 2D would have been reverse and strong, so 3D is therefore Splinter  |pg||

nt|mbruun:  North cant raise without heartcontrol, unless partner hesitates before 5 C. In that case director will be called and the score will be corrected if slam is on. So North did the right thing|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it seems right, probably South will make the 12 tricks here also|pg||

mb|p|nt|gautis2: but, otherwise I agree with u:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: another good result for Norway - hopefully they can get these a lot more in the european championships too - there are more good female players in Norway than many people think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT looks right|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|zebutin: interesting hand, 7@C makes easily because of QJ doubleton in @H... 7nt has the tricks too|pg||

nt|ianmcc: on a @s lead I think you need a sqz for 7|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no of course @c8|pg||
nt|zebutin: you can use 3rd @C as connection and come back with @D A to hand to cash rest of @C|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Jessicas opening here will get NS off from the bad 3NT contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Might consider a spadeovercall with the West hand. Obvious in pairs in my opinion|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But they found the 44 fit in @ds, but a good lead here by S, it will make anyway|pg||
nt|grebrof: 11-16, but ok|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt-3NT?|pg||

pc|s2|nt|derric: maybe W should have enquired over 4@h for @hK, still doesn't know the 4th @h though|pg||
nt|haans: does not know were 5 carder is so 2NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: draw back of the system shown on this hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mbruun:  Well done, but declarer should have tempted West with C7 og 8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|derric: to play?|pg||
nt|zebutin: 6@H now, and maybe Erkkilä can see the tricks?|pg||
nt|zebutin: or...maybe not... :)|pg||

pc|s6|pg||

mb|p|nt|zebutin: or not...? must be some difference opening 2M and 1@D with 5@C+4M...|pg||
nt|iceking: almost impossible i would think|pg||
nt|gautis2: this time 1@h..  have to say I think this is a better hand than the 5404 hand|pg||
nt|grebrof: agree- now only 2 suits|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  2 @S should be the normal contract now|pg||
nt|zebutin: because same point range|pg||
nt|derric: 1@d may be 5@c4M(31) if too bad suits for 2M opening|pg||
nt|derric: just checked|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 3N by S now will help|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 2nt S 3@H north and 4@D from S |pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@h minimum|pg||
nt|gautis2: 2@his a weak support, so I guess they will stop in time|pg||
nt|grebrof: ?|pg||
nt|grebrof: nice distribution S has :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: 2@d shows a good raise (after pass)|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure when they actually show a 5carder|pg||
nt|sharkey: If 1@S is 8-11 why doesn't N just bid where she wants to be instead of giving EW information?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: this might even be a slam :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: i didnt read page 84, but I guess 3@c is minimum:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok, 3@s inviting|pg||
nt|haans: they have not show a 5 carder 11S 4 2@S ansfer to tranfer = 4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mbruun:  2 Sp is the best partscore here. 1NT is one off with careful defense|pg||

pc|s7|nt|iceking: but just dreaming this hand is just one of those you cant reach slam playing natural methods|pg||
nt|sharkey: they may have to work to make this...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ianmcc: KISS is the answer - @hAK then @c|pg||

nt|haans: count hand as 16 p|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: assuming they play some king of lebensohl over reverse, 3@h showed a better hand than 2N there i guess, still difficult|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|grebrof: minimum is a lot it seems|pg||
nt|gautis2: I am NOT sure they have 100% agreement in this auction!|pg||
nt|gautis2: if Q ask from N, i bet S says..I DONT have the Q:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: in normal circumstances, N (by going the long way) has already said she has the bunch, so if S doesnt have any more to tell - N can bid 4@h|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|iceking: in iceland we play the swedish version of Gazzilli called Haxan|pg||

mb|3D|nt|zebutin: 6@H doesnt seem totally hopeless, but black suits arent breaking even|pg||
nt|psyck: that sounds equally menacing|pg||
nt|iceking: its very simular|pg||
nt|grebrof: normally contested auctions are harder than where you "live in free", but board 30 seemed otherwise - 10 imps to Norway|pg||
