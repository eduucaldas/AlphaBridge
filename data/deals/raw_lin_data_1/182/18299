mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|janm:  Hi all - 1@h is an interesting choice on the N hand, or is it normal for them and not because he's in 3rd seat?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|darth: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|loganrun: Do NS play splinters because 3C might be better than 3S but South bid it anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Roy Huges is an Acol fan so maybe they play that system|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Hughes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C is not a splinter :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they do, 1@H is normal enough|pg||
nt|janm:  But 3@c wouldn't be a splinter, would it - have to id 4@c to splinter, and surely N wantedto give his partner a chance to stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Roy has even written a book on Acol|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pamela: hi  this is so exciting     such a close match aside from personal wishes as to who the champion will be  it is still anyones|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|janm:  It looks as if this should make comfortable - lose 1 @c and 1 @s and maybe a trick for handling - take 4 @ss, 2 @hs, 4 @ds plus maybe an extra one|pg||
nt|janm:  Yes, 2 IMPs after 96 boards is amazingly close!|pg||
nt|loganrun: A lot of people are suggesting that 3C is a trong bid - the style we play here in Acol is that this would be a splinter as 2D is nearly 100% forcing|pg||
nt|loganrun: strong|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|darth: Roy and David are not playing ACOL|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: 3@C could well be a splinter. Some do play it as such and name them mini-splinter. Norway is one place|pg||
nt|janm:  The fact that Turner chose to bid 3@s suggests that this pair doesn't play 3@c as a splinter though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed not but it's playable|pg||
pc|d5|nt|darth: 3@C would be a strong jump shift|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you do you have to make 2@C a one-round force|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|c4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1M - p - 3m some play as a mini-splinter, these other uses simply don't make sense|pg||
mc|10|nt|janm:  I think he's ending with just 10 tricks here - neither clubs nor hearts are going to deliver an 11th - some might even suggest "NEXT"|pg||

mb|1S|nt|noodle:  well if the trend holds Rayner victory by 33 :)|pg||
nt|stewball: pretty grueling event for 4baggers|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|starkist: guppy is 10 blocks the other way so you know who I'm voting for|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|stewball: many would have dbld with S,,but it is hard to defend when all the defense is in one hand|pg||
nt|kfung: a good understanding to have... what is double in balancing seat|pg||
nt|kfung: many would pass mcavoy's hand so double should perhaps be less|pg||
nt|stewball: true,dbl may have had another meaning|pg||
nt|stewball: lots of players give up a penalty dbl of 1nt as being inefficient|pg||
nt|kfung: there's an inference to be drawn that declarer has 5 diamonds|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|stewball: relative to other treatments|pg||
nt|kfung: partner did not lead a diamond and has only 4 spades|pg||

nt|janm:  How many spades with East after 1@s-2@d?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|loganrun: Just game|pg||
nt|janm:  Of course, N might DBL and then it's a little differen - still probably bid 4@s?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|darth: I think 4@S is the practical bid|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: problem with 4@S is partner will never know when to bid again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Both contracts are 1 down|pg||
nt|janm:  Wow - enterprising by Hughes - I was trying to figure out how the play would go in 4@s and whether declarer could avoid a second heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't|pg||
nt|janm:  Here it looks like 2 @cs and one @h for down 1|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|janm:  I suppose you're right, unless the defense decides to play hearts|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|darth: he could double dummy with @HJ9 with S|pg||
nt|loganrun: He can Roland but only with good eyesight|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s6|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|loganrun: Lead the ten of hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or finesse the eight first round|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|d3|nt|janm:  Here, I guess that declarer can hold his heart losers to 1 (which means taking 2 heart tricks) by clearing spades and then playing a club to West, who will have to either break hearts or give declarer a ruff/sluff to get rid of one of them.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|janm:  Although now that declarer has "squandered" the club 10, he probably has to lose a third club as well as the heart, for down 2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|janm:  And of course he didn't have the dummy entries to lead the first club towards his hand, even if he had any reason to suspect that West would be short in clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: He was in dummy and could have at that point -- he had time to ruff @S|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sT|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s9|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|h5|nt|janm:  No, if he didn't ruff the spade, West would have a spade to get out with when he won the @c A and East could get out with a club when he won the K, so declarer would have to start hearts and lose 2 of them|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: start @H by leading low to 9 seems to get the job done|pg||
nt|janm:  Probably he should have ruffed the spade at trick 2, then he could have led a club off dummy after the third trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so we have now double dummied this hand to death|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: this is largely double dummy to occupy time, of course|pg||

mb|p|nt|loganrun: Danger lurks on this hand in the reds|pg||
mb|2H|nt|darth: This shows @H's and another in Rayner-Roche methods|pg||
nt|loganrun: South checking EW system card!|pg||
nt|janm:  How do you feel with that South hand when RHO opens 2@h? Even if it's only 5 hearts|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: wow, if you're playing against stuff like this, I'd think  you would have analyzed it ahead of time and confirmed your defense to it.|pg||
nt|darth: in 1st and 2nd position|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  Well, he definitely has hearts stopped|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm:  And a practical raise by N|pg||
nt|janm:  Can he make 9 tricks? Almost anything West leads will help|pg||
nt|janm:  On the previous board, the CR EW played in 4@s doubled and made it, for our first big swing of the set|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|darth: That may be the wrong result as the play shows that he was 1 down|pg||
nt|loganrun: Bigger question perhaps is can the defence take 5 tricks I think not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: board 4 was scored as 4@Sx making but play indicates it was down 1|pg||
nt|janm:  YOu're right - it certainly looks as if he lost 2 hearts to go with the obvious spade and diamond losers, so the swing may be the other way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: raynor decided correctly spades were partners second suit, since neither opponent bid them|pg||
nt|darth: this lead is actually the best for the defence as it takes away one of declarer's entries to his @H's|pg||
nt|othered1: right|pg||
nt|othered1: does 2@H show 5+@H?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janm:  I'm betting on declarer here - he can win this in hand and play a heart to the 9. East has to duck or declarer has an easy 9 tricks. Then he can go after the minors and end with 3 clubs, 2 diamonds, 2 hearts and 2 spades I think|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|janm:  :)|pg||
nt|janm:  Of course declarer, like West, had a lot of information from the opening bid|pg||
nt|janm:  But on a bad day, East would have a spade honor and West's excellent lead from honor -x-x would beat this|pg||
nt|darth: appears to be a good save for Rayner in the OR|pg||
nt|janm:  Other room opened 2@s with the East hand (did that show 5+spades and a second suit or was it just a favorable vul shot?) and saved in 4@s, picking up a few IMPs if I'm right that declarer is going to make this|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|h5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|janm:  West has to duck this to have any chance, but that probably won't help - declarer will cash the heart to pitch a diamond and exit A and a club. Note that declarer can be pretty sure that West has both black Ks from the fact that West didn't |pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|gavin:  important note for kibs, 4@D is clearly forcing because you are pulling 3nt|pg||
