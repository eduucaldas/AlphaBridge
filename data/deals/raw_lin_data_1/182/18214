nt|santyclz: Many don't open 1nt with 17 and a good 5-card suit.  Here the suit is not spectacular but there are 2 10s in addition.  |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that contract has more chances than 4@h - good decision by E who believed his partner|pg||

nt|santyclz: (in the other room)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, pessimistic look,  but we don't know their methods. looks like 3@h is invitational|pg||
nt|santyclz: And I'm going to have to desert you here.  Thanks all and bye for now.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for me, 8 points and 6-cards suit opposite strong NT deserves a game, not invite|pg||

nt|rodal f: But how to handle the @H as well as the @C?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: if the oppo bid a make a slam against you on this, you know it's not your day |pg||
nt|rodal f: If @CA is at E NS are inside a problem if they don't find the @H |pg||
nt|zyxzewski: if hearts come in for 5 tricks (as they do), you need just one trick in club|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Play @HJ for hook Q at W by 3-3 or play as grandma?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|zyxzewski: grandma's odds are way much better |pg||
nt|mdgraham: on a club lead you might run @HJ, to protect the club holding if possible - but if @CA goes up, it's a toss-up |pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Agree Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: if you are in six, there's not much to protect|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: though if you make a mistake in hearts and they still don't play clubs, you may still win the contract by getting 4 tricks in every other suits|pg||
