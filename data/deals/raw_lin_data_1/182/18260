nt|psridhar: sets up gf and no need to worry abt it later|pg||
nt|psridhar: now over 3@h he wd like to cue raise it, but how?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|zyxzewski: now North probably has no options but to raise to 4@H - he doesn't have any cuebid available and if he continues with 3@S, it may provoke partner to raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|psridhar: lost valuable space in bidding too as S wd hv surely rebid 2@h over 2@c and he can raise it to 3@h and start cue bidding|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: quite an inelegant solution in the end - he has 14 hcp with 3 card support (including 2 top honours) and he was forced to bid it like he had about 9 points and doubleton|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: and in the last round also the final standings|pg||
nt|psridhar: freely bid -no competitive bidding|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|psridhar: didnt get pushed|pg||
nt|psridhar: that X of 1N may be conventional|pg||
nt|psridhar: alerted?|pg||
mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: i don't know about the methods of CR EW, but there West declined to open 1NT but chose 1@D instead and later bid 2NT over partner's 1@S bid|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: did Minelga intend his 2@h as trf ?|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: i believe double was artificial and 2@H was pass-or-correct|pg||
nt|psridhar: possibly X= minor major woolsie; and 2@h = pass or correct in Major|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: but anyway, he maybe can afford to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: he has a huge hand for a Mjaor contract however...|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|pc|c4|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||

pc|h6|nt|zyxzewski: Bethers liked more his chances to beat 2@H than to make 2@S|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|zyxzewski: or maybe he was reasoning that South may well have 4-4 majors to skip the minors|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: anyway this room's result only mattered about a couple of IMPs only|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|psridhar: amusing symmetry 140 and 1400:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: if they can't engineer some kind of fightback, it's over for them|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: but it still may be not enough for Marupe - but we have no results from 2nd table to evaluate the situation|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: that should make easily|pg||
nt|psridhar: is Bethers thinking of correcting this to 4@s ?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: indeed...|pg||
nt|psridhar: he has the shape but not enuf values to cross 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: and their trumps are thin...|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: i think, if his partner has 5@S, he may continue with 2@S bid over 2@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: however this may well make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|zyxzewski: it should confirm strong variation with 5@S i presume|pg||
nt|psridhar: if declarer can limit his losses to 2 trumps and one @c|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: also the CR "avoided" 3NT and played in hearts|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: why @SQ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: he will survive bcos of the doubleton QJ of @h falling|pg||
nt|psridhar: else that trump play was risky|pg||
pc|d7|nt|zyxzewski: if N has the @SA (as he probably does), it still may be doubleton|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: and if he has 4 trumps, they must be AJTx|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psridhar: now after that 2nd @d from N he doesnt need anything in @h to happen|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|zyxzewski: so Q is good basically only when S ducked Axx|pg||
