mb|1N|nt|psridhar: playing for Q10 doubleton was the best chance i think|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: yes, he can later play also for @HA doubleton in N hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: and he had probably no reason to think that the S is the one with doubleton ace|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2N=lebensohl asking opener to bid 3@c for a sign off 3@d by N later|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|vugraphzdt: 3@c alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: so that a direct 3@d bid by N becomes natural and forwrd going|pg||

mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzdu: ou can see the current standings here http://www.bridge.ee/festival/teams11.htm|pg||
mb|3D|nt|stevo:  if north had it he had to pitch a diamond|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  partscore battle|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: Hi, welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  http://www.bridge.ee/festival/teams11.htm here is the sitting for round 10|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, here we are|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  because if Brad had @dA -- Peter, North was about to be on lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S isn't strong enough, but the shape looks promising|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is afraid a x willl be left in and he has insufficient values for defense.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|pef: oh, sorry, had to run to feed the dog, missed that north was going to be on lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: But I certainly couldn't resist x|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|pef: not as good an excuse as drinking with bobby, I know :)|pg||
nt|stevo:  def a weak excuse IMO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred explains that brad would bid a 4 card major with a balnced hand over 2@c or at least could|pg||
nt|pef: well at least I can spelll|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: no such explanation on the other side|pg||
nt|stevo:  good point|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'm with S, too|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|stevo:  i think i set the record low score on my SAT and still went to college|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW did well to conced the bidding |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  sum o de tim enywhey|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: more deafening silence here|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  juicy +500 for NS in 3@s may well be|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if S decides not to cross to the table for trump finess - he'll be pleased with @d K dropping |pg||

mb|1C|nt|psridhar: trappy hand for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|psridhar: NS in other room climbed to 5 level missing two keys and the bad trump break did them in|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: 1@C = Polish (weak NT, natural or any strong hand), 1@S was probably NAT 4+ and 2@D just confirmed opener has a strong hand|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: at least that's my guess here|pg||
nt|psridhar: couldnt he have splintered 4@c over 1@s?|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: but no idea, what 2@H might mean|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: i don't know, i'm not so familiar with system's logic|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|psridhar: if he had splintered he would have heard a firm sign off in 4@s|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: i have been tipped that 2@D was strong relay and 2@H = 7-10, exactly 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: from North's point of view it is not a bad idea to go slamming-just imagine South hand hodling @s king instead of @c king|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|zyxzewski: nice stop (considering they were never going to bid 6, missing 2 keycards)|pg||
nt|psridhar: in the same shape hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: they wd hv played 4@s even if South held @s KXXX,@hXX,@dX,@c AQXXXX?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|s2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: and Estonian NS in other room wd hv reached the slam|pg||
pc|d6|nt|zyxzewski: or maybe even with @SKxxx, @Hxx, @DKx @CAxxxx (it also qualifies as 7-10)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|d7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|c3|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|mc|10|nt|zyxzewski: so maybe the sign-off was a bit premature, but nevertheless served them well (and going down in 5@S in CR is of course a very unlucky)|pg||
pg||
qx|c8|st||md|2S7532H95D4CAKQ953,SHT8732DJT8763C86,SAQJ64HKQJDAQ92C2,SKT98HA64DK5CJT74|sv|o|nt|pef: hey that was mercifully fast|pg||
nt|henryb:  got the hand over anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: there is a short break every 6 boards and ofcourse new teams too|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  doesn't matter now - operator's work is the hardest one :)|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 4 of either major or 5@ds depending on picking up the @dq.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think bd 6 will be the winner in the field |pg||
mb|2C|nt|pef: making 6 in 4 spades on this board would certainly win almost all the mps for n/s|pg||
nt|pef: which is what happened in the closed room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|sfoxa:  you have to be in time with all the 4 players - it's rocket run|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  Fred thinking 3NT here with his q-bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  the other room is so boring that all the kibitzers have come here|pg||
nt|pef: specs are asking me why hurd didn't bid 2h.  I think it's becfause his hand is a bit too good nv vs. vul and has good cards for play in the other two suits|pg||
nt|pef: what do you guys think?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh, here comes a club lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: just a hunch |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pef: now that's cruel, Barry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: EW are playing the so called brown concention|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jade: just waiting for the sonambulists to cath up|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  I agree with Hurd hand too good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: well bid to the rightside|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, in 6 EW did very well|pg||
nt|santyclz: Most people (around here) play a 1nt in that position shows 11-14 or so.  S should x and rebid nt (unless w bids @cs).|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now they are lucky to defend 3nt, not 4@h|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@s was probably some kind of crash|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: should get used to it|pg||
mb|5S|nt|pef: always play nt when you hold qx, right?|pg||
nt|stevo:  its very important to know if 3@H shows stopper here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  now NS is about to discover 2 aces missing...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: red or black suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  which i think is very good way to play it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  1 and @sK, yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: oh|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: right|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  but even this contract is endangered - declarer has to be very precise|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzdu: yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|stevo:  or advance q-bid slam try|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|pef: well he has a bit of both, doesn't he|pg||
nt|stevo:  well not really a slam try that would be way to hungry|pg||
nt|henryb:  in which case you will continue over 3N|pg||
nt|pef: it is dinner time|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  better to say - no chance for declarer - he has to spare 2 @s tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: another lead would have been good for N|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, a hope to pitch all 3 @h on clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: tremendous round |pg||
nt|santyclz: In the other room shown (just 1 of several, bear in mind) w passed originally and overcalled in @cs to keep n-s out of nt.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (To see the bidding at the other table, hover your mouse pointer over the other room score.)|pg||
nt|sybarra:  http://www.bridge.ee/festival/invitational11.htm for on-line results - we should remember - it's pairs, so no imps score  |pg||
nt|sybarra: the imp score at our table is an indication, NOT the score in the event|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: a little break again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: its every 4 boards |pg||
nt|santyclz: Shirley's turn to sing and dance for us.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: A fine 3rd seat opening.|pg||
nt|blum1956: one more chance fr NS to bid game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  color blind Barry?|pg||
nt|pef: double probably shows a heart suit with diamond support|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  yes good start for E/W|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I have to put in random clicks cause the computer is so loud. |pg||
nt|pef: specs point out that 4h actually doesn't make on the stiff diamond lead (or a less likely diamond from kxx if south on leas|pg||
nt|pef: on lead, I mean|pg||
nt|pef: but I still think n/s are going to bid 4s over 4h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Dont want to tip off the table as to whos bidding|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|henryb:  understand that|pg||
nt|pef: JoAnna Stansby told me always to bid 4s over 4h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge writing a not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: e|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|henryb:  Van Vogt wrote a Null-A|pg||
nt|stevo:  i assume 3@S by Brad is competive and double would be game try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: thats what it looks like|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: whew short break |pg||
nt|santyclz: N has a borderline Drury, aggresive.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pef: is a quasi alert like a pseudo alert, Barry|pg||
nt|sybarra: so you didnt have to hear me sing |pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  decent hand with 5 hearts or 6 bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: i call em like i see em Peter|pg||
nt|stevo:  sorry that was private as to what 2 hearts would have shown over 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: this might go down 2 to push the result|pg||
nt|pef: he's unlikely to play the hand the bid both red suits also for spade length|pg||
nt|henryb:  My guess is that the right way to play 4@s is to play @cA and a club. If clubs 2-2, play spades 2-2. Otherwise play the person with 3 clubs for a stiff spade|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa:  a lot of work to do for declarer, but this contract looks as a standard one|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|pef: true|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @h return is unpleasant for declarer|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sfoxa:  not killing, even with misguess, but ...|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|h2|nt|stevo:  in this situation on lead if you guarantee 3+ diamonds leading high is best to clarify the suit but here I think he only showed 2+ so couldnt risk looking like he had doubleton|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  N is very famous aggressor - Lithuanian player|pg||
nt|sybarra: N will be in this bidding |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  partscore battle - 2@h for NS vs 2@s for EW|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  easy hand for E-W to bid too much on the lie of the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  oops wrong again!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 1@s preemptive!|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  EW use Polish-style bidding (1@c opening - can contains 2 clubs only)|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: 2 clubs opening bid by south in third seat double 4c double all pass|pg||
nt|blum1956: the 3NT bid looks most strange|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  I suppose, 3@c bid was invitational, looking for values in that suit. |pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge asks Fred about the King lead and about carding|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: EW are playing Natural system (French style), NS - if my memory serves me well - play Polish Club|pg||
nt|psridhar: pleasant surprise for N-trying to get a ruff he ends up giving one to his pd |pg||

nt|sfoxa:  this board may bring few imps for Estonia|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but next one is on the table|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|blum1956: this looks interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: i hope the juniors can make it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  finding @c contract will be quite impossible now|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|sfoxa:  so, how high will be NS?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: 2nt was alerted|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  especially N with 4-cards fit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm, I suspect 2nt was alerted, probably lebensohl or something similar.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lot of people play in this position 2nt as lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stevo:  I think Hurd would have bid 4@S if partner wasnt a passed hand but less attractive when partner passes as unlikely u have a game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: 3 @c also|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2@s looks good, although|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Yes because West rebids 2@s|pg||
nt|blum1956: East needs the heart control and the Exclusion Blackwood|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: hard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: E is thinking hard|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and NS are out of bidding (having 3 or even 4@h to play)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzdu: seems he needs no controls...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Vugraphzff: noticed Wooldridge doesnt want to tip declarer about the HCP as he is a passed hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  so, E has weak hand with @h sign-off|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|santyclz: A lesson hand  on how to pick up qxx in s with 10x in north.  Just 1 small problem...|pg||
nt|blum1956: There exists a very good convention after the 2@c Precision opening, the2@d asking and the 2 in a major rebid. The partner's (3 that major -1) rebid (here 3@h) means GF with ...|pg||
nt|blum1956: support|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: the other room did just that it seems|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: only without asking :D|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|stevo:  i wonder if E/W shift to 2nd highest in middle of hand looks like it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  @c position is good for declarer, only correct @h guess is in question|pg||

pc|dT|nt|psridhar: whether Karpov shd hv bid 1N is debatable too|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: if declarer guesses clubs, he'll make nine tricks, but to take 10, it requires some defensive help in hearts|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s2|nt|psridhar: @h shift needed now|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: though declarer may establish his clubs indeed|pg||
nt|psridhar: trick 2 @h shift was needed to thwart that plan|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|psridhar: 4@s can make now |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: but to be honest - it was not easy for S to switch. We can see all the cards, but he cannot|pg||

nt|psridhar: instead of Q10 doubleton @c he played for @h ace to be doubleton with S and a winning @c guess- too much to hope for|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  last board of this round|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  maybe second best through declarer?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Fred writes a note about his 2@d bid|pg||
nt|stevo:  Brad has an interesting opening if I opened I would bid 1@D then 2@C but I dont like rebidding 1NT with small singletons|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|3S|nt|sfoxa:  1nt is 1-round forcing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW went overboard next door, and here E is cautious|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not so W - brave girl!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|pef: there goes the spade fit|pg||
nt|stevo:  A good treatmen over the q-bid is 2nt majors not that he has it but if he were 5 5 you would like to have it available|pg||
nt|pef: but likely a surprise spade lead against 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: N had a choice between 3@S (an underbid IMHO) and 2nt.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd opt for 2NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  first of all - game forcing, second reason - S has all the 3rd level to sale his hand |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  next door, W jumped to 4@s in same position|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|sfoxa:  S has hard decision now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Specs point out that 3nt was also an option with 19 and a good suit.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|pef: we're all leading a spade here, I bet hurd does also|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred says " impressive huh"  Brad says TY|pg||
nt|henryb:  which is not wuite as good as pllaying 4@sX|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|c6|nt|stevo:  i also would play 3@D showing a stopper not asking with 3M available without one|pg||
nt|pef: can you make 4sx after spade and spade?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|dT|nt|henryb:  I'm not sure|pg||
