mb|p|nt|othered1: Which more and more players are adopting, even without fancy systems around it.  It cleans up other auctions, like opening 1M and rebidding it.|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|kirp:  1H was game-force, 2C stayman, 3D looks misbid|pg||

nt|vugraphzcw: meaning of bids described now|pg||
nt|othered1: Oh, I see.  South doesn't seem to have defined his strength below 4@D, which one or the other misunderstood|pg||

nt|gowdy: yes constructive @S raise|pg||
nt|caitlin: Turner gives up?|pg||
nt|gavin:  i imagine they use 3@H to signify a 4th trump|pg||
nt|caitlin: exactly|pg||
nt|caitlin: every 2N is 3-card suit|pg||
nt|kirp:  maybe better than constructive, like 3h wit 3 trumps|pg||
nt|gavin:  as pointed out by a kibitzer, 3@S was likely roche's way of saying he has the WORST possible hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  and a pass would imply game interest|pg||
nt|caitlin: or X?|pg||
nt|gavin:  double likely penalty |pg||

pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|othered1: Nice methods to get the likely better hand to be dummy . . . |pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks lika strightforward 10 tricks in Hs, if you bid it. Given the OB, should be no problem.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|gowdy: 4 @H  :) looking for the ruff in hand  I guess|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kirp:  Need Turner to do something|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@H could go down|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|gavin:  declaring these hands where the opponents sell out to your 1H-2H auction is a lot of fun|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe even should no sure dummy entry|pg||
nt|gowdy: @S lead helps|pg||
nt|gavin:  as soon as you learn where the high card points are, you know that person has length in hearts|pg||
nt|kirp:  Should beat it now|pg||
nt|gavin:  or conversely, if you learn who is short in hearts, you know their partner has the majority of the points|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|gavin:  because anyone with short hearts and the majority of the high cards would act|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|gowdy: the 8  is @D suit pref|pg||
nt|gavin:  so after the spade lead, I would immediately be thinking south has length in hearts|pg||
nt|gavin:  since the ace of spades showed|pg||
nt|gavin:  thats my first instinct anyhow|pg||
