mb|p|mb|2C|nt|zebutin: good day for everyone watching|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|zebutin: interestingly they they have typed some of finnish players first names too, so from finland there are playing Pia Erkkilä and Hulda Ahonen, pair that plays strong club (15+)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: also welcome to Magnus|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Frisk start med en oplagt slem...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iceking: S took a rather passive view here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W can perhaps see, that 1@d is bid on a 4-card suit, so a small from dummy|pg||
nt|iceking: not sure i could play def vs 2@H here, though bidding is little strange also as you are not sure you have fitt anywere|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Hi - mys danish were just the daily exercises...|pg||
nt|iceking: low would keep better control af everything|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|zebutin: different openings from 1st/2nd hand and 3rd/4th for finnish pair, but from 1st and 2nd they play weak nt, and 1@D-1@S openings are 10-14 and 4card suit|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||

nt|psyck: Hi Magnus & Ralf|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: and if some pairs card interests you http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.2354|pg||
nt|zebutin: has convention card for all players it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Anyway, ti was easier to play than to bid|pg||
mb|1H|nt|zebutin: 1nt 15-17 from 3rd hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@s on NS|pg||
nt|iceking: good slam here |pg||
nt|iceking: should be easy to reach|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psyck: lot of options for S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They finished in 5@c last deal in open after some relay bids with 3 rounds of @h for -1|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: chose drury|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@C probably one way drury|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@d showing a good opening with at least game interest|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D real opening,as i play myself here i would bid 3@D with north hand natural and slammish|pg||
nt|nubmaster: So a good start for Sweden here|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@d a nice treatment there Magnus|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ianmcc: 4@h seems to need to find @dQ, tho 4th @s could be useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: in 4@H you would seem to lose 2 @S + @C, because spades are 3-3 you can throw one diamond to 4th spade|pg||
nt|zebutin: so might not need to quess diamond suit|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room finnish women played 2@S some down, there is magic diamond system in effect, that has 8-11 openings in 1st and 2nd hand, so makes often for different scores|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is a very good contract for NS|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psyck: N will likely blast to slam in spite of missing a keycard|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Anyone who can tell us about the bidding here? 2NT like good/bad NT or something?|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: W made a very light 3rd seat opening in open room|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mbruun:  THis aggressive lead will cost the defense a trick, and HQ another one, so all of a sudden nine tricks turned to eleven. No big deal in teams though |pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: wonder what 5@s here was|pg||
nt|iceking: 4nt might be even number of aces |pg||
nt|psyck: oh Turbo|pg||
nt|iceking: at least it looks like it |pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably negative|pg||
nt|iceking: been told 4nt shows 3+aces|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, not Turbo then, just their own methods|pg||
nt|iceking: nicely done anyway |pg||
nt|nubmaster: well done here, both K and J in @s works so no trouble with Q of @h offside|pg||
pc|sT|nt|zebutin: good day Juho, its allready 14.00 in finland...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Juho, 2100 in Melbourne|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks and next|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|psyck: after Souths free bid & jump to 4@s, N could have also bid slam other table, but was tougher after opps intervention i guess|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mbruun:  Back to nine again. Interesting|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In Open Marie and Pia get to 4@h which seems to be doomed, especially when E lead a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was a bad play. return @cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and defence will have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not finessing @h first round... doesn't matter if E got the Q alone... E indicates both A and Q of @s because of the play|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|iceking: 1@S in closed room was the problem, for sure S should have bidded more powerful bid then 1@S|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, good shape, decent 5 carder, & useful touching honors in @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|mbruun:  I suppose 2D is a very light Multi, but Im not sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt be surprised, if East bids 3 NT here|pg||
nt|derric: pass by north?|pg||
nt|derric: i think they play precision|pg||
nt|zebutin: some would bid too, A + J109x seem quite nice values...no support for partner though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wondering. But not much for East - West|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@s was certainly possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Sounds reasonable|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|iceking: S bid 4@S and east dbl |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Ahonen has quite bad values for balancing at red zone, even though has decent 6 card suit...but risks are quite high|pg||
nt|iceking: will be disaster if w gamble on 5@C here|pg||
nt|psyck: bot at this vul maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: *not|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|hawe45:  No comments...|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: option ofcourse but will catch very bad dummy and on best def will go for 1100|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: when she doesn't balance it argues bad spades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh dear... system error|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  Ah - East wanted to know, which major South had, before bidding 3 NT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Here you'd like to play canapé, first showing 4c @s and then longer @d but there's no room for that|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They play transfer bids over 1@c, ie 1@d=@h etc...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mbruun:  Careful defense will hold this to nine tricks, if South ducks heart in trick 2|pg||
nt|psyck: not a good start for Iceland|pg||
nt|iceking: might be the worsed possible dummy W could get|pg||
nt|iceking: now @D return and 4 down for 1100|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but major suit wastages were known on bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but couldn´t W suspect bad @s honours on E?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Alsowithout ducking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if 1@h shows @s - why not bid the 6-card @d?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|iceking: if w was on heat one dummy would be J9xx AKx Ax AJxx and 5@C is easy make |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|derric: might go down now|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But shouldn't W bid 1@s as 2-3 @s and minimum?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no hope|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will not play @C - so 4 tricks to N/S anyway|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Agree Ralf, an error in the system here or a bidding misunderstanding, think it's the first one though|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I'm sure 2@d is conventional here so there was no room for it as natural|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|derric: conceding down 1 now i suppose|pg||
nt|derric: oh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can´t understand why a 4-card is more important to show than to bid 1@d|pg||
pc|d6|nt|iceking: 800 for 14imps |pg||
nt|nubmaster: But perhaps E will skip the @s and just go for the @ds from the start, it's teams and gamebonus looks really far away|pg||
nt|ralfwil: !½s10|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c10...|pg||
mc|6|nt|nubmaster: 2@d direct is weak with @ds but she prefered showing the @ss first and then after a possible 1@s/1NT she could've used XY-NT to 2@d|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Cost 7 imp for just a partscore|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Is there a break or something op?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I think there is some undo now....|pg||
mb|2S|nt|nubmaster: redo the bidding!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  1 NT is not everybodyÂ´s taste|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@D was 11-16 or (11)12-13bal...so might end up too high|pg||
nt|derric: is north's hand unbal or did she upgrade to 12-13 bal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: NS are one of the best women pair in europe, been pdship for man years. Icelandic pair has less experience in international events|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: cards well placed here for a few o/t's|pg||
nt|iceking: N with some dubious holdings took the passive view here and didnt compete|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  2 down on a @S-lead, it seems|pg||
nt|mbruun:  I dont mind 5cM for a NT, but a strong suit without the ace is not clear to open 1 NT|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can be 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|derric: wonder if 2@s is game-force or invite|pg||
nt|derric: apparantely latter|pg||
nt|zebutin: hearts are well for declarer, everything else little less so...|pg||
nt|zebutin: lead might give 1 @C trick more|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @h and @c friendly|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  In fact, the North hand is no so strong - the @DÂ´s doubtful values|pg||
nt|mbruun:  With no aces you should subtract 1 HCP from the hand. Good intermediates are a plus on the other side|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  Sure - but the @D-doubleton is not so great|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, clubs depend quite much how you play them that how friendly they are...with this lead they are friendly enough|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|mbruun:  Right|pg||
nt|zebutin: and seems 3@H + 2@S + 2@C + @D make enough tricks for declarer|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ianmcc: good switch|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, even with playing on @D makes|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: must discard a @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or a @d|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Yes, no good to just ruff and play ace of @s and then minor cards, S will have a @h left together with a tr|pg||

mb|1N|nt|mbruun:  West will not believe her eyes when partner bids 3 Sp|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  6 @S is the right bid from West now|pg||
nt|mbruun:  6 Sp right away to apply pressure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We could play together, Mathisa|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Im a little concerned that I agree with you, about the bidding I mean |pg||
nt|ianmcc: close to a slam|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  7 @S would have been a better bid than 5!|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Very difficult for NS to get to the grand. I predict EW will buy it in 6 S X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But this might work - and West will not "sell out"|pg||
nt|zebutin: more or less clear 4@H... but if they feel bold they might even shoot for 6@H...|pg||
nt|zebutin: which isnt the best contract, but i have been in worse...|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: tuf to get to game even after drury|pg||

mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Impressive|pg||
nt|mbruun:  West knows 7 Sp is good insurance, but always difficult to save in a hot aucton like this. She should do it right I think  |pg||
nt|zebutin: 3@S most likely splinter of some sort, Pia might like her hand now because only Axxx in @S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: trump 2 @s and lose a diaamond|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mbruun:  Well done all around|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From Wests point of view, 7 @S might cost about 500 only - with more @C by East|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|derric: pessimistic|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@H very agressive and will catch perfect dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: that made S's choice easier, esp with vul game at stake|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Mikael G told me that the operator is new and are in training so we will have some allowance here... and she has no time to comment|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  No RD, please, that would loose 2 IMPÂ´s to 2140|pg||
nt|zebutin: well trumps cant be too badly, and with diamond lead neither can any other suits either so has enough entries&etc|pg||

nt|nubmaster: If 2NT shows the red suits why not start with 4@h and then 5@d? But N took it for the minors because of the fact that the 1@c opening is 2+?|pg||

nt|zebutin: and will opponents x or bid their own @C suit|pg||
nt|derric: prob 4|pg||
nt|iceking: been great action |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: only worth 3@s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  The mistake(s) started with the 2 NT-bid - why not allready there bid 4 @C?|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  You get 4 @H from partner and bid 5 NT|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mbruun:  I think 4C directly after 2 Sp will show shortage|pg||
mb|2S|nt|zebutin: so might be small gain to finns|pg||

nt|psyck: S may balance|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|iceking: now N might gamble on 3nt |pg||
nt|iceking: 3@D could be very wrong give pd like 14-16 hcp and 2-4-3-4 shape and he most likely will pass 3@D even playing leb|pg||
nt|iceking: i bet she will gamble on 3nt, been very agressive so far|pg||
nt|psyck: leb may not apply here anyway|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|d|nt|hawe45:  DoesÂ´nt matter - it forces East to show the suits with control, and 4 @H is a true dream to hear|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Not so far-fetched for West to double 3 NT and take the 800 on a normal @S-lead. If you doÂ´nt now and then write 750 for the opponents, you havÂ´ent doubled enough|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|zebutin: interesting hand, 7@C makes easily because of QJ doubleton in @H... 7nt has the tricks too|pg||
nt|psyck: everyone playing weak NT here i guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|derric: does west bid a slam on her own here too|pg||
nt|derric: 14-16NT there so was safe, 12-14 here might need encouragement from partner|pg||
nt|ianmcc: on a @s lead I think you need a sqz for 7|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no of course @c8|pg||
nt|zebutin: you can use 3rd @C as connection and come back with @D A to hand to cash rest of @C|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Jessicas opening here will get NS off from the bad 3NT contract|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mbruun:  Might consider a spadeovercall with the West hand. Obvious in pairs in my opinion|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But they found the 44 fit in @ds, but a good lead here by S, it will make anyway|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mbruun:  Low club frob West will give them three tricks in the suit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|derric: maybe W should have enquired over 4@h for @hK, still doesn't know the 4th @h though|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mbruun:  Well done, but declarer should have tempted West with C7 og 8|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|derric: to play?|pg||
nt|zebutin: 6@H now, and maybe Erkkilä can see the tricks?|pg||
nt|zebutin: or...maybe not... :)|pg||
nt|derric: i thought 5@s was asking here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|derric: maybe 5@s is relay to play 5NT|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|zebutin: well bid|pg||
nt|derric: + little bit lucky that partner has 4th@h|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, if didnt know about that, its lucky too|pg||

nt|zebutin: yes i think so|pg||
nt|psyck: thought W would continue @s after T & 8 came down 1st trick instead of @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|iceking: good slam here that will be very hard to reach|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H!|nt|zebutin: or not...? must be some difference opening 2M and 1@D with 5@C+4M...|pg||
nt|iceking: almost impossible i would think|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  2 @S should be the normal contract now|pg||
nt|zebutin: because same point range|pg||
nt|derric: 1@d may be 5@c4M(31) if too bad suits for 2M opening|pg||
nt|derric: just checked|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 3N by S now will help|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 2nt S 3@H north and 4@D from S |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mbruun:  2 Sp is the best partscore here. 1NT is one off with careful defense|pg||
pc|dT|nt|zebutin: @S lead could make this hard to handle|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianmcc: nasty lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: now need to take right views|pg||
nt|derric: E can't get in safely if takes this with ace|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|iceking: but just dreaming this hand is just one of those you cant reach slam playing natural methods|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ianmcc: KISS is the answer - @hAK then @c|pg||
nt|iceking: strong @C system might have better shot|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|mbruun:  If defense ducks a spade at some point, declarer is home though|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: assuming they play some king of lebensohl over reverse, 3@h showed a better hand than 2N there i guess, still difficult|pg||
nt|ralfwil: difficult to make|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|s3|pg||

nt|ralfwil: can make now|pg||

nt|iceking: wow|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like they had a Gazzillish sequence|pg||
nt|iceking: so even now at 44|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: in iceland we play the swedish version of Gazzilli called Haxan|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 4c @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but easiest was to cover @hJ|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|zebutin: 6@H doesnt seem totally hopeless, but black suits arent breaking even|pg||
nt|psyck: that sounds equally menacing|pg||
nt|iceking: its very simular|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nubmaster: and 4c support with minimum|pg||

nt|nubmaster: Gosh... another one for the Swedes here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk5: Why would it be takeout when you are sitting over the suit?|pg||
nt|iceking: S might have forgotten|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mbruun:  EW were caught for 500 in the other room on board 14, so Denmark now in the lead 24-20. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: if can trump 2X@d in dummy it looks OK-ish|pg||
nt|iceking: i play it takout not sure why though, i just fallow orders from my pds dont really think logical about it if its good or bad methods:)|pg||
nt|pelu: for me Ns X = penalty|pg||

nt|ralfwil: ant this is a typical example when it´s necessary to act immediately and not intend balance|pg||

pc|hK|nt|mbruun:  Good stop by the Norwegians|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's easy to remember. Under the suit = takeout, over the suit = penalty|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mbruun:  Last hand, the play resumes at 12.40|pg||
nt|pelu: agree|pg||
pc|h2|nt|zebutin: yes, ruffing diamonds shouldnt be too hard|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
