mb|4N|an|RKCB|nt|vugraphzhw: finaly 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is perhaps better known as Pepsi; his reall name means "bee" in Polish|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|an|1 or 4|nt|Walddk2: Don't ask us to pronounce it|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but thank goodness for blackwood|pg||
mb|6H|nt|vugraphzhw: pshchowa:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: white flag went up there rather easily|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Great help, thx :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: there are only 2 losers in a 1h contract, but can he find 11 winners?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oopses are getting plentiful|pg||
nt|capercliff: really 6@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh yes|pg||
nt|capercliff: that doesnt seem possible|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pjs_ch: yes but very awkward bid for Hallberg - what woudl you bid with his hand?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe they are playing 6-ace blackwood|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: problem getting to east   no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: the card says 1430 and he explained it as 1|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yo_yo: I suppose sheridan was hoping for @HA  then it's on a finesse|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: south has problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzhw: a kind of endplay now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or even a drop|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pjs_ch: with 3@H passable, X must be takeout, but you lack four spades|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pjs_ch: Silverstone wiwll now ponder how to play the clubs, not realisign he can't go wrong :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|capercliff: that small @h lead was something! I can conjure a few hands where the A@s winner would go away!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I think nerves play a big part when you are on vugraph, is it their first time on bbo?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: NS were in the OR last night|pg||
nt|ianmcc: some @c are going away|pg||
nt|capercliff: Goodman thinks E has a void|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Goodman giving his next move some thought|pg||
nt|yo_yo: club lead now would be nice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and could happen since suit never bid|pg||
nt|capercliff: that wont happen, he will play another trump I think|pg||
nt|ianmcc: and North will pitch?|pg||
nt|capercliff: North could have given @s count?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Goodman puts hand down, leans forward|pg||
nt|capercliff: perhaps he was worried about parting with a @s from 1098x|pg||
nt|capercliff: declarers hand is a mystery|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ianmcc: like 4NT|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: not really    east can finesse the 10 if allowed to get to hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pjs_ch: what typing !! must do better  !!1|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: playing clubs after one trump means he can always ruff the third club|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But great for the audience|pg||
mb|3C|an|invitational, 10-12|nt|ady:  possible to go down in 4 hearts or 4@S   if defence takes the 2 club tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: Holland borrows Silverstone's alert card - none in his box|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@H = min - in this case extremely min, may stop pd from slam investigation|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Walddk1-14 have given up regarding Thursday through Sunday next week. 10 nations, 26 tables, 107 sessions inside 4 days|pg||
nt|yo_yo: usually 3@H stronger than 4, maybe playing 4 card majors they prefer to bid this way|pg||
nt|ianmcc: oh dear|pg||
nt|capercliff: too much to ask to enter now for East, South could have a very good hand and North has a limit hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: feels like South rather endplayed into that|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzfv: Goodman reminds himself about leads - "2nd & 4th"|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3N is a pretty good contract really|pg||
nt|capercliff: and can be made I think|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not this time|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: Short gets some water as Goodman makes his plan|pg||

nt|Walddk1: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if Im opened 1H vul on that w hand I would be crucified - by my partner|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree but many think 1 aces and a King make for a compulsory opening|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 aces i mean|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: Hallberg folds hand up, ponders|pg||

nt|jtr: Hope you analyse better than 2-14:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Why the pause?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: 2N was not GF for this pair, which means they must allow 3@H as minimum|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what clues does he have?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can imagine John's comment if this goes down|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: fact of no trump lead might point him the right way|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: John looks in very good mood, can't imagine a bad comment if it goes down :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: If he manages to count the hand, he will play S for @HQ|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|capercliff: on the surface it may be the right play anyway, unless playing for a stiff Q|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pjs_ch: but he can survive misguessing because the clubs are 33 and spade loser goes|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|ady: declarer thinking about 4-1 spade split|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he must play 2 anyway surely?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: along the lines of "hard luck pd?" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: perhaps he'll try and get defence to open trumps somehow?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he'll wonder why North led from a dangerous Kxxx now|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: dangerous though|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cJ|nt|ady: yes    but likely thinking ahead what can be done if 4-1|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: he might be more worried about hearts-41 and he can only cope with that if South has length|pg||
nt|mcarroll: stating the obvious , how do I avoid a @H ;loser as 2 @S losers pretty inevitable|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: only one spade loser - one goes on club|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: well you might lead CJ and see if there is any flutter on your left|pg||

nt|ianmcc: splinter it says|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: CC says 1@h-3@s = "SPL" and I assume North can ask which suit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Might be in any suit - but still dubious with a void rather than a singleton|pg||
nt|capercliff: ah right, any splinter|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 1@h-4 any = void|pg||
