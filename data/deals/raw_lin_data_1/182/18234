mb|1C|nt|yorkbeach:  they are playing Reverse Smith signals, so he might have known who had the @dQ|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: but might have been KQ stiff|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ady: a chance for Great Britain here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes - I think North played his lowest @s to deny the @dQ|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  at other vullnerabilities, South would have pre-empted|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room south found a 2@D bid which seemed to keep e/w to the club game only|pg||
nt|ady: only 24 hcp for e/w  but good fitting cards    Panto voice opposite west length|pg||
nt|roswolf: having created a forcing situation west can risk 4@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West may need to make teh moves|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  East will place West with wasted @h values|pg||
nt|roswolf: THAT MAY WELL BE FINIS|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if West had a splinter bid available, that might have made the sequence easier|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is thinking about it|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C would have left room for 4@D  cue which would leave room for 4@S cu|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@d hardly conveyed the void|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point david|pg||
nt|ady: very high now for Panto to make right decision|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  jump to 5m is normally fast arrival/sign off|pg||
nt|vugraphzfu: Anyone think Waterlow's long think before 5@c restricts East in any way?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east wont like missing the black suit tops but there again west must have something for this bidding|pg||

nt|yo_yo: what clues does he have?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can imagine John's comment if this goes down|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: fact of no trump lead might point him the right way|pg||
