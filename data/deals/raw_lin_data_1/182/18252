nt|ralfwil: hello again!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me a new swedish pair Jessica Larsson and Katherine Bertheau|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Hi all|pg||
nt|nubmaster: And hi Ralf|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|iceking: welcome|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thanks Magnus!|pg||
nt|grebrof: hello, and welcome to this 5th match in the Nordic championships for women|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|zebutin: good day for everyone watching|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|grebrof: Norway is the defending champions from Lillehammer 2007 and they are also the current leaders|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|zebutin: interestingly they they have typed some of finnish players first names too, so from finland there are playing Pia Erkkilä and Hulda Ahonen, pair that plays strong club (15+)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: also welcome to Magnus|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: the norwegians are playing a natural system with 5 card majors - the finnish girls prefer a strong (+15hp) 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Frisk start med en oplagt slem...|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: S took a rather passive view here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W can perhaps see, that 1@d is bid on a 4-card suit, so a small from dummy|pg||
nt|iceking: not sure i could play def vs 2@H here, though bidding is little strange also as you are not sure you have fitt anywere|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Gautis|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gautis2: hello, and good morning:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: He may be a bit biassed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wife playing as South|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is the winning contract - espescially now with the natural @d-lead from E|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hawe45:  Kunne Ãst ikke have overmeldt med 4 Ru?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|gautis2: figure i still not know her well enoghe since i dont have a clue what 3@h means:)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|iceking: was no rush for Ace of @D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  Hi - mys danish were just the daily exercises...|pg||
nt|iceking: low would keep better control af everything|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|grebrof: Stine has had some very good results, so its about time she got her chance for the national team (gautis being biased or not)|pg||
nt|grebrof: she is NOT playing with you now my friend :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|zebutin: different openings from 1st/2nd hand and 3rd/4th for finnish pair, but from 1st and 2nd they play weak nt, and 1@D-1@S openings are 10-14 and 4card suit|pg||
nt|gautis2: :) ..well, cant argue with sucess, since 4@s was born to go down|pg||

nt|psyck: Hi Magnus & Ralf|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: and if some pairs card interests you http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.2354|pg||
nt|zebutin: has convention card for all players it seems|pg||
nt|grebrof: Gunn Tove was in the winning team in 2007 - then partnering Siv Thoresen who is by many considered being the best female player in Norway. for the first time in many years (dont ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: know hom many), she is not in the bracket this time|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|hawe45:  Anyway, ti was easier to play than to bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: good start for Norway avoiding the impossible 4@s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|zebutin: 1nt 15-17 from 3rd hand|pg||
mb|d!|an|7-11|nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@s on NS|pg||
nt|iceking: good slam here |pg||
nt|iceking: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|grebrof: the +15 @c comes into action|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psyck: lot of options for S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They finished in 5@c last deal in open after some relay bids with 3 rounds of @h for -1|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: chose drury|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@C probably one way drury|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|psyck: 2@d showing a good opening with at least game interest|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D real opening,as i play myself here i would bid 3@D with north hand natural and slammish|pg||
nt|nubmaster: So a good start for Sweden here|pg||
nt|gautis2: partscore battle|pg||
nt|grebrof: as a guess I would think the dbl of 1@h from E is 5-7hp - their card says nothing about what "neg dbls" are|pg||
nt|gautis2: i guess x shows hp s not @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@d a nice treatment there Magnus|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ianmcc: 4@h seems to need to find @dQ, tho 4th @s could be useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: in 4@H you would seem to lose 2 @S + @C, because spades are 3-3 you can throw one diamond to 4th spade|pg||
nt|zebutin: so might not need to quess diamond suit|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room finnish women played 2@S some down, there is magic diamond system in effect, that has 8-11 openings in 1st and 2nd hand, so makes often for different scores|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is a very good contract for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|psyck: N will likely blast to slam in spite of missing a keycard|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Anyone who can tell us about the bidding here? 2NT like good/bad NT or something?|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: W made a very light 3rd seat opening in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  THis aggressive lead will cost the defense a trick, and HQ another one, so all of a sudden nine tricks turned to eleven. No big deal in teams though |pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: wonder what 5@s here was|pg||
nt|iceking: 4nt might be even number of aces |pg||
nt|psyck: oh Turbo|pg||
nt|iceking: at least it looks like it |pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably negative|pg||
nt|iceking: been told 4nt shows 3+aces|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, not Turbo then, just their own methods|pg||
nt|iceking: nicely done anyway |pg||
nt|nubmaster: well done here, both K and J in @s works so no trouble with Q of @h offside|pg||
nt|gautis2: not fan of 4@h  ..better to do an invitasional bid after 2@s ...not this "shot"|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is sometimes the problem with strong 1@c - in a contested auction like this, you dont always know if 2@s is a bid with 4 or 5 @ss - now they escaped|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|zebutin: good day Juho, its allready 14.00 in finland...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Juho, 2100 in Melbourne|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks and next|pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like one loser in each suit|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|gautis2: y, should  be 200|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: after Souths free bid & jump to 4@s, N could have also bid slam other table, but was tougher after opps intervention i guess|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Back to nine again. Interesting|pg||
nt|gautis2: board 1 was a coopy of 3NT, so well done to both teams|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|grebrof: otherwise I agree with not bidding 4@h (allthou it looks like P has a single @s) but P only made a single raise - guess they have ways to show a better raise - well, the ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: vulnerability is "right", so can understand 4@h too|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|nubmaster: In Open Marie and Pia get to 4@h which seems to be doomed, especially when E lead a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was a bad play. return @cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and defence will have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not finessing @h first round... doesn't matter if E got the Q alone... E indicates both A and Q of @s because of the play|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|iceking: 1@S in closed room was the problem, for sure S should have bidded more powerful bid then 1@S|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: Jessica missed their chance|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c7|pg||
mc|8|nt|gautis2: FInland bought 2@h in OR, so this willbe 7 imps to Finland..edit: 11 imps, 2 down|pg||
nt|gautis2: ..12 :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: thank god the BBO is helping us :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: is there a break?  (catfight? :) )|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: the director is coming here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Visst|pg||
nt|grebrof: viewing all 4 hands is sometimes a snag, cause you never know what they be thinking - pauses that might make a difference at the table are not always felt the same way by us|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: the Norweigen girls are asking about their bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont know the finnish strengt in a catfight, but I guess the norwegians are mediocre there :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: pherhaps 2@s bid is explained as something else?  Cant see the line of play if it is "as it is"|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont think N has a case here|pg||
nt|gautis2: i do.. :)|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, good shape, decent 5 carder, & useful touching honors in @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mbruun:  I suppose 2D is a very light Multi, but Im not sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt be surprised, if East bids 3 NT here|pg||
nt|derric: pass by north?|pg||
nt|derric: i think they play precision|pg||
nt|zebutin: some would bid too, A + J109x seem quite nice values...no support for partner though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: wondering. But not much for East - West|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@s was certainly possible|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - we will see|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mbruun:  Sounds reasonable|pg||

nt|gautis2: victory |pg||
nt|gautis2: good to stop...system victory|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|zebutin: Ahonen has quite bad values for balancing at red zone, even though has decent 6 card suit...but risks are quite high|pg||
nt|iceking: will be disaster if w gamble on 5@C here|pg||
nt|psyck: bot at this vul maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: *not|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No comments...|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|iceking: option ofcourse but will catch very bad dummy and on best def will go for 1100|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: when she doesn't balance it argues bad spades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh dear... system error|pg||
nt|grebrof: N showing 20-21hp|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Ah - East wanted to know, which major South had, before bidding 3 NT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Here you'd like to play canapé, first showing 4c @s and then longer @d but there's no room for that|pg||
nt|grebrof: the good @c-suit being the missing hp|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gautis2: y, fair upgrade|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|nubmaster: They play transfer bids over 1@c, ie 1@d=@h etc...|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Careful defense will hold this to nine tricks, if South ducks heart in trick 2|pg||
nt|psyck: not a good start for Iceland|pg||
nt|iceking: might be the worsed possible dummy W could get|pg||
nt|iceking: now @D return and 4 down for 1100|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but major suit wastages were known on bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but couldn´t W suspect bad @s honours on E?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  Alsowithout ducking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if 1@h shows @s - why not bid the 6-card @d?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|iceking: if w was on heat one dummy would be J9xx AKx Ax AJxx and 5@C is easy make |pg||
nt|gautis2: but this will probably fail by 1..  so i presume 4 more imps to Finland,..  I need my coffee..brb:)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|derric: might go down now|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But shouldn't W bid 1@s as 2-3 @s and minimum?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|grebrof: the finnish is using reversed carding . the 2 showing an equal number of cards in @cs|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c8|nt|ianmcc: no hope|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  East will not play @C - so 4 tricks to N/S anyway|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Agree Ralf, an error in the system here or a bidding misunderstanding, think it's the first one though|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I'm sure 2@d is conventional here so there was no room for it as natural|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|derric: conceding down 1 now i suppose|pg||
nt|derric: oh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can´t understand why a 4-card is more important to show than to bid 1@d|pg||
pc|c9|nt|iceking: 800 for 14imps |pg||
nt|nubmaster: But perhaps E will skip the @s and just go for the @ds from the start, it's teams and gamebonus looks really far away|pg||
nt|ralfwil: !½s10|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c10...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|nubmaster: 2@d direct is weak with @ds but she prefered showing the @ss first and then after a possible 1@s/1NT she could've used XY-NT to 2@d|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Cost 7 imp for just a partscore|pg||

nt|derric: is north's hand unbal or did she upgrade to 12-13 bal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely|pg||

nt|grebrof: ooops - 3-9p|pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: NS are one of the best women pair in europe, been pdship for man years. Icelandic pair has less experience in international events|pg||
mb|4D|nt|psyck: cards well placed here for a few o/t's|pg||
nt|iceking: N with some dubious holdings took the passive view here and didnt compete|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hawe45:  2 down on a @S-lead, it seems|pg||
nt|mbruun:  I dont mind 5cM for a NT, but a strong suit without the ace is not clear to open 1 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: can be 10 tricks now|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: wonder if 2@s is game-force or invite|pg||
nt|derric: apparantely latter|pg||
nt|zebutin: hearts are well for declarer, everything else little less so...|pg||
nt|zebutin: lead might give 1 @C trick more|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @h and @c friendly|pg||
nt|gautis2: wd Finland, and they have a great start of this game!|pg||
nt|grebrof: reversing with  a single was not the best idea from Marianne Harding it seems|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  In fact, the North hand is no so strong - the @DÂ´s doubtful values|pg||
nt|mbruun:  With no aces you should subtract 1 HCP from the hand. Good intermediates are a plus on the other side|pg||
nt|gautis2: seems like a not agreed auction in OR|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe she wanted to bid 3@h :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure splinters with only 3card support is the best, but I am not playing this event :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  Sure - but the @D-doubleton is not so great|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, clubs depend quite much how you play them that how friendly they are...with this lead they are friendly enough|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|gautis2: i m sure it was a "slip of the mind" ..happens to all of us :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mbruun:  Right|pg||
nt|zebutin: and seems 3@H + 2@S + 2@C + @D make enough tricks for declarer|pg||

pc|s7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|iceking: 10 tricks for one imp gain for Denmark|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|ianmcc: good switch|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, even with playing on @D makes|pg||

pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: must discard a @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or a @d|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nubmaster: Yes, no good to just ruff and play ace of @s and then minor cards, S will have a @h left together with a tr|pg||

nt|grebrof: I am reporting from Thailand and we are 5 hours ahead of Norway - 4 hours ahead of Finaland|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  6 @S is the right bid from West now|pg||
nt|mbruun:  6 Sp right away to apply pressure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We could play together, Mathisa|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Im a little concerned that I agree with you, about the bidding I mean |pg||
nt|ianmcc: close to a slam|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hawe45:  7 @S would have been a better bid than 5!|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Very difficult for NS to get to the grand. I predict EW will buy it in 6 S X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But this might work - and West will not "sell out"|pg||
nt|zebutin: more or less clear 4@H... but if they feel bold they might even shoot for 6@H...|pg||
nt|zebutin: which isnt the best contract, but i have been in worse...|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: tuf to get to game even after drury|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  - not if South bids 7 @C now, Mathias...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: must be odds-on|pg||
nt|iceking: another drury hand|pg||
nt|psyck: S likes hand better after opps bid @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Impressive|pg||
nt|mbruun:  West knows 7 Sp is good insurance, but always difficult to save in a hot aucton like this. She should do it right I think  |pg||
nt|zebutin: 3@S most likely splinter of some sort, Pia might like her hand now because only Axxx in @S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: trump 2 @s and lose a diaamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Well done all around|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From Wests point of view, 7 @S might cost about 500 only - with more @C by East|pg||
nt|gautis2: good result for Norway OR. .. seems hard with heart lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: in the open room, thhe norwegian 1nt opening showing (8)9-12hp|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gautis2: Gib says it makes..I have to get MORE coffee:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|derric: pessimistic|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@H very agressive and will catch perfect dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: that made S's choice easier, esp with vul game at stake|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Mikael G told me that the operator is new and are in training so we will have some allowance here... and she has no time to comment|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Heart lead is the killer|pg||
nt|grebrof: the small cards in dummy makes it easier to overtake the Q too, cause there are many layout where N will have a @h-suit good enough for it to run later|pg||
nt|gautis2: as I can see, I am agree..|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  No RD, please, that would loose 2 IMPÂ´s to 2140|pg||

mb|4H|mb|d|nt|ianmcc: 3@d|pg||
nt|iceking: should have no problems stop in 4@H here|pg||
nt|psyck: 5 level is safe too i guess|pg||
nt|iceking: would be good to have 3@H forcing here |pg||
nt|nubmaster: If 2NT shows the red suits why not start with 4@h and then 5@d? But N took it for the minors because of the fact that the 1@c opening is 2+?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I guess without the @s lead, you can possibly make some @d-tricks, but|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: and that is logical if bypass @D with marginal canape hands|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h will now be frcd after 4th suit bid|pg||

nt|nubmaster: Forcing?|pg||
nt|gautis2: this play will take sometime..belive me:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mbruun:  Denmark gained 7 IMP on board 5, because South unblocked her AK of hearts in due time, so 7 Sp X was five off|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a happy spot|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|hawe45:  Yes  - but after a slow start|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This looks like a coffee-board for 420 N/S|pg||
nt|mbruun:  4 Sp seems to be the spot, and its a very natural contract|pg||
nt|psyck: they have to be careful not to get too high here with cards unfav|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|zebutin: 2@D most likely multi|pg||

mb|p|nt|nubmaster: In open the Icelandic ended up in 5@d|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|zebutin: Johansson has many quick tricks in hand, so didnt want to bid lame 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: or east could maybe dbl 3@D here |pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 3@D looks alot down 5-6 down|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mbruun:  North will raise to three, and a well placed DK will make South go to game|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Ah, started to write that before it showed up on the screen, sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 1@c +15hp|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1@s balanced +9 or 4441|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|gautis2: did we get the result  of board 2 Johanna?  |pg||
mb|3N|nt|ianmcc: some prospects|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room they got to open 1@H telling 4+ @H and 8-11...and after that sailed to 3nt|pg||
nt|derric: 3NT went down after declarer broke entries in open|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Cards are not lying in favour of making 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: this lead destroys one entry to @C suit, but give ruffing finese in @S suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: and they figure it out, so a  stop...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finnish ladies avoided the tempation|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I think the director chosed to let it be (4heartsx-2), but I'm not shore!|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|zebutin: so if takes that, she is losing 2@D + @H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Maybe 4@s here|pg||
nt|gautis2: ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: I wouldnt change that board 2 either|pg||
nt|grebrof: but ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: not the best lead here|pg||
nt|grebrof: if there is any|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nubmaster: good bid|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ianmcc: it removes a useful entry|pg||
nt|psyck: stopping low with a key card missing & the 3@d x|pg||
pc|h3|nt|iceking: i dont really understand why east didnt dbl 3@D|pg||
nt|iceking: east should know dummy in 3@D dbl will hold most often 0-1@D and very few hcp|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nubmaster: They must continue @d after the 2 @c to take away the entrance to E|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|psyck: double dummy, you can reel off 8 tricks in the majors & squeeze South in the minors for the rest|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|gautis2: I told it was a close group a while ago, with 2 VP fom 1st to 3rd...  as we speak, it is actually thighter! (1 VP 1st-3rd :))|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ianmcc: wrong pitch, I think she needed @cK onside|pg||
nt|zebutin: discarded @C so doesnt have to take @C finese, but @D suit is so lousy they will not raise as any extra tricks, so needs Ax(x) in front of @D K|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @d now or she makes|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: Vist Gunn says that she would have play different if she had get the correct information and then only loose one trick, so the result only would be down one|pg||
nt|grebrof: if any ladies form Faroe Islands are watching, I hope you soon come up with a team that can compete in this championships - there is a bye in the womens group - shich in my mind it ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: shouldnt|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mbruun:  Game over |pg||
nt|zebutin: ofcourse can still take @C finese if wants to, but little riskier|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hawe45:  South will not hav to fear a singleton @C - in case, this would have been played earlier - and faster...|pg||

nt|mbruun:  Two grands in nie hands. Good cardshufflers|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: yes the last one was misscored, it was equal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and good bidders|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: offshape overcall with 4cards, offshape x without 3rd @D...so many options for bidding...|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 1nt is 12-14. Last hand w opened 1nt with bal 13hcp|pg||
nt|ralfwil: dbl is 500|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@H is some bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: no hcp no shape no controls |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|grebrof: never buy a thai keyboard - mainly I am guessing :D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The blockage in hearts is awkward for declarer in 5D|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|mbruun:  You have to play some kind of Exclusion-blackwood to bid it. Very difficult|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @C (W) - 4 @H (E) - 5 NT - how difficult can you make it, Culbertsonour good old freind|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I exclude exclusion|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Board 6 is also misscored. Hopefully they will be corrected shortly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph lead is normal on the bidding|pg||
pc|c4|nt|derric: 1@c is 15+ i believe|pg||
nt|zebutin: but i think they have some bid over strong @C that tells majors, so even that could have been option...|pg||
nt|derric: i don't know if x is take-out|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|zebutin: seems like will lose atleast 3 @S, @D and @C...and cant raise @D suit either before has removed all trumps, and might lose control because of @C suit...|pg||
nt|zebutin: so needs some delicate play|pg||
nt|iceking: east should signal with @S K here|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|mbruun:  In the Open series, the Danish West, HC Graversen lead the HA to beat 3 NT by one on board 6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I doÂ´nt know heir system (either) - but 4 @C from West instead of 3 @H would have been better|pg||
nt|cenglund:  This may be a huge swing|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe worried @sK would suggest @d pref|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1@c opening in the other room contains a whole lot of diffferent stuff, so not that strange that lead wasnt found|pg||
nt|gautis2: yes, will be 11 imps to Norway|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  Next board...|pg||
nt|mbruun:  It seems strange to give up the investigations|pg||
nt|iceking: yes probably thinking about that|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|s5|nt|cenglund:  Defence can't afford a slightest slip |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|zebutin: this seems to be on road for atleast 1 down at this rate|pg||
nt|zebutin: but with @C return is able to raise @C suit, so defence needs to be sharp too|pg||
nt|derric: 4 black suit ruffs and @DAK@hAK would make 8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|h5|nt|mbruun:  How about 5D after 4c. When partner shows two aces bid 5 N and partner will cuebid 6 H which will get them to the grand. Maybe they have other agreements of course|pg||

nt|ralfwil: N can see the discard on @cK, so I can´t see any reason to return anything else but @d|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3nt?|pg||
nt|gautis2: 3@c = bid 3@d if 20-21 NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: its a bad hand in some ways N too - how to show 3 suits after 2@c?|pg||
nt|gautis2: i vote for 1@s opening, but .. :)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  5C seems the best game spot|pg||
nt|grebrof: easier when you see dummy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Since 2 D is forcing after 2-o-1, 3D is a Splinter. Similar to the first board, where 2D would have been reverse and strong, so 3D is therefore Splinter  |pg||
nt|mbruun:  3 NT seems to be the evident bid|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Unless she thinks 3D is 55 and strong|pg||
nt|derric: or east protecting?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iceking: possible 3 down here|pg||
nt|grebrof: N 4@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Thats what happened. Misunderstanding NS|pg||
nt|pelu: why not X from W to show both black suits?|pg||
nt|iceking: or 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: they might not play 2 suited overcalls here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Or maybe she thinks her hand is good enough for a cuebid. |pg||
nt|mbruun:  Well see|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Board 13 - always difficult|pg||
nt|zebutin: @C Q is sitting nicely, so most likely this wont be any gain for either team...if doesnt try double finese in @S|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I have been told, that 6 @C is possible - would you make it Mathias??|pg||
nt|mbruun:  North cant raise without heartcontrol, unless partner hesitates before 5 C. In that case director will be called and the score will be corrected if slam is on. So North did the right thing|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it seems right, probably South will make the 12 tricks here also|pg||
nt|mbruun:  I think 6C is lay down with S K onside. Five spadetricks, six clubtricks and the DA|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Five clubs in hand and a diamond ruff. Shoudnt represent any troubles|pg||
nt|mbruun:  A sneaky spadelead will keep this to 11|pg||

nt|derric: 1@d may be 5@c4M(31) if too bad suits for 2M opening|pg||
nt|derric: just checked|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 3N by S now will help|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 2nt S 3@H north and 4@D from S |pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@h minimum|pg||
nt|gautis2: 2@his a weak support, so I guess they will stop in time|pg||
nt|grebrof: ?|pg||
nt|grebrof: nice distribution S has :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: 2@d shows a good raise (after pass)|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|gautis2: i didnt read page 84, but I guess 3@c is minimum:)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mbruun:  2 Sp is the best partscore here. 1NT is one off with careful defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: @S lead could make this hard to handle|pg||
nt|grebrof: hehe|pg||
nt|grebrof: we used to have 69 pages - had been playing 2 years or so... :)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ianmcc: nasty lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: now need to take right views|pg||
nt|derric: E can't get in safely if takes this with ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|gautis2: with letter size 20?:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: hmmm - evert|pg||
mb|3S|nt|iceking: but just dreaming this hand is just one of those you cant reach slam playing natural methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: KISS is the answer - @hAK then @c|pg||
nt|iceking: strong @C system might have better shot|pg||
mb|3N|nt|grebrof: everything was written in detail so my P could remember|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3nt is not a winner|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  If defense ducks a spade at some point, declarer is home though|pg||
mb|4N|nt|psyck: assuming they play some king of lebensohl over reverse, 3@h showed a better hand than 2N there i guess, still difficult|pg||
nt|ralfwil: difficult to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C!|nt|grebrof: minimum is a lot it seems|pg||
nt|gautis2: I am NOT sure they have 100% agreement in this auction!|pg||
nt|gautis2: if Q ask from N, i bet S says..I DONT have the Q:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: in normal circumstances, N (by going the long way) has already said she has the bunch, so if S doesnt have any more to tell - N can bid 4@h|pg||
mb|d|mb|5D!|nt|pelu: even Finland after a strong 1@D only bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cover for 2@h tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can make now|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  A major disaster for the Finnish ladies in the open room|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zebutin: seems that Andersson took the right view and is on her way to making 4@H|pg||
nt|gautis2: she didnt have the @h Q:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: the opponents put some nasty stuff in there too|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree with S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: discard a @c|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is not more than anything - @h Q or not|pg||
pc|c4|nt|grebrof: P didnt opemn 2@c this time|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Iceland in 6@H in the open room; well done|pg||
nt|iceking: wow|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like they had a Gazzillish sequence|pg||
nt|iceking: so even now at 44|pg||
nt|grebrof: shit happens here too - good to see for leathal players in this game|pg||
mb|1C|nt|iceking: in iceland we play the swedish version of Gazzilli called Haxan|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 4c @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but easiest was to cover @hJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@H doesnt seem totally hopeless, but black suits arent breaking even|pg||
nt|psyck: that sounds equally menacing|pg||
nt|iceking: its very simular|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|nubmaster: and 4c support with minimum|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board|pg||
nt|gautis2: oh..was going for a coffee...thougt it wasa "claim"|pg||
mb|2N|nt|zebutin: or @H for that matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: second dbl many play takout here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Double?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Gosh... another one for the Swedes here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk5: Why would it be takeout when you are sitting over the suit?|pg||
nt|iceking: S might have forgotten|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  EW were caught for 500 in the other room on board 14, so Denmark now in the lead 24-20. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: if can trump 2X@d in dummy it looks OK-ish|pg||
nt|iceking: i play it takout not sure why though, i just fallow orders from my pds dont really think logical about it if its good or bad methods:)|pg||
nt|pelu: for me Ns X = penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: ant this is a typical example when it´s necessary to act immediately and not intend balance|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Well some kibbs say thieves but you won't get any points placing the green ones at the table eihter|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Good stop by the Norwegians|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's easy to remember. Under the suit = takeout, over the suit = penalty|pg||
nt|grebrof: again: seeing all 4 hands makes you sleep|pg||
nt|gautis2: last board, and seems like this match will end in a friendly score of VP 15-15|pg||
