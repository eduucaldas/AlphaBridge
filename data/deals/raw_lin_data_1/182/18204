nt|roswolf: really then good on finland|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: but usually the young ones like to experiment, so i wouldn't be surprised if they play something else|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: BTW do the estonians still play the Beach Diamond system?|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: yes|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: still about 90% of pairs|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm it was interesting to play against it and view it on BBo|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: this sequence looks a bit of a bow and arrow approach but it is a decent enough contract|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|s9|pg||

nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|pef: hi all|pg||
nt|stevo:  hi|pg||
nt|pef: welcome back to the finals|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Everyone discussing styles carding etc |pg||
nt|cherilou: hello all|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Shirley, hi to kibs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|pef: the bathurst time had a good last eighth with no swings more than 6 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge Hurd play light inititial actions and 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|stevo:  John Hurd's nickname is Jimmy I believe that its because Gavin Wolpert one time said why is your name Johnny you look like a Jimmy and it stuck|pg||
nt|pef: anyone for passing on the north hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: last 15 boards of the day. 60 more tomorrow|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|stevo:  i think pass is very reasonable but close|pg||
nt|sybarra: Sveta :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am not as brave as that W |pg||
nt|sybarra: if he indeed bid 1 nt |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|cherilou: I don't like pass|pg||
nt|pef: of course a case could be made for passing on "jimmy" hurd's hand, also :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is close also|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brad says ty|pg||
nt|stevo:  not their way they play precision opening but standard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: checks their convention card|pg||
nt|pef: me too, certainly would pass if they were vul and us not|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|sybarra: sorry I did not see the X bye E,  so I guess 1 nt is best bid by W |pg||
nt|sybarra: got my second cup of coffee that might help |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|henryb:  now a low @d to the Q?|pg||
nt|stevo:  ealier in the tournament against Zia "jimmy" opened 1@H went double p p XX and Woolridge left  it in getting Zia to run with KQ9xxx|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pef: I gather that wasn't best?|pg||
nt|stevo:  the kids have a lot of poker in their game which I respect|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|stevo:  Zia would like it back im pretty sure|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|Vugraphzff: Woolridge spins the @h 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: and flips it|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge has absolutely no fear and backs his judgement |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|stevo:  which can be said for many of the players in this final|pg||
nt|cherilou: must be the youngest final ever|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cherilou: by decades perhaps|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, this may be the only time nobody is eligible for the senior events|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: we all used to be young once|pg||

mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: with one sided bidding - 1@D - 2@H - 4@H - 4NT - 5@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|zyxzewski: West got a bit carried away, here i would expect to stop in four|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: or maybe in two?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: if this 2@H was weak two, then its much too heavy for it...|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: and North's double is dangerous also - it looks like a part-score hand and she's red vs green with only 3 card spade|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: (not to mention, that your good 4-card side-suit happens to be the other major)|pg||

nt|stevo:  1@S is very preemptive|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sybarra: the push by the club  bidders put the spade bidders in jeopardy |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|pef: three nt makes on this hand e/w with spades 44 and the luck in clubs, but will they get there or come close?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|pef: what now on the east hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this can be down one,  if W gets to put the @H thru |pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|stevo:  2@C is not pretty but really his only bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks to me like 5@c also makes|pg||
nt|stevo:  now 3@H I think|pg||
nt|pef: he punted with 2c, not good enough for 2h reverse of 2nt, anything else is just silly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: hurd thinking|pg||
nt|blum1956: even 5@h is (more or less) safe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: yeah|pg||
nt|gulyas: good morning Mike|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: West should consider an absolute minimum from E|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|blum1956: hi daniel|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|gulyas: I don't know what 2@H was, but he had no reason to go on|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: the 7 signalled the @H shift |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: it was GF|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: 5+@h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cherilou: good auction|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge was worried about his spades hard to blame him|pg||
nt|pef: turns out this makes with the luck in clubs and luck in hearts|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pef: not a lot of losers, but need a lot of work to get to 11 winners|pg||
nt|stevo:  I think if west had the 9 of spades he wuold have bid 3NT as its a blocker|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: stop talking poker Stevo!|pg||
nt|henryb:  he needs at least one spade ruff|pg||
nt|pef: complicated hand.  is there a clear best line?|pg||
nt|stevo:  :) Barry is referring to blocking cards which is very common in pot limit omaha|pg||
nt|henryb:  or lots of diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: hurd staring back and forth between his ahnd and the dummy|pg||
nt|stevo:  looks natural to ruff @D's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: now in thinker pose|pg||
nt|henryb:  which would be more complicated and probably a losing option on this layout|pg||
nt|pef: 3nt might not be as good a contract, but has the advantage of being really easy to play :)|pg||
nt|stevo:  he might win and play a spade first for communication|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|blum1956: the 1@d opening was superunderlimit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pef: indeed, they got to 3nt in the closed room|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: std. old fashioned signaling  |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|sybarra: and a claim coming  |pg||
nt|gulyas: well, he had a 10count, and pd is minimum, so whats the point|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|gulyas: even 4 could be in danger as we see  here|pg||
nt|blum1956: u right|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|gulyas: I know, juniors are always optimistic:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: yes|pg||
mc|10|nt|stevo:  interesting line|pg||
nt|stevo:  now trump shift looks like|pg||
nt|stevo:  but i think he survives on trump|pg||
nt|pef: once the 10 of hearts fell it seems like once it did you should switch direction|pg||
nt|stevo:  maybe need spade spade?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: @s @s works for defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: cant ruff the last @d|pg||
nt|stevo:  phew its cocktail hour at levin's house was nervous|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: the 4th @d|pg||
nt|pef: this might be the first game swing of the afternoon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: LOL pour me a stiff one . ill be over soon!|pg||
nt|stevo:  i will drink it for you |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I think everyone onto the @s @s defense now except Fred|pg||
nt|stevo:  on spade spade he cant cross and ruff out diamonds because q clubs is in short diamond hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5@H-1 not the happiest result|pg||
pg||

mb|1N!|an|majors or minors|nt|zyxzewski: NS can make 3NT - as the spade pips are divided (if you transfer @S8 to West it can be defeated)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|zyxzewski: but don't think they'll reach there|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes south has a spade stop - remarkable|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: 1nt = the majors presumably|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: north must support @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ALWAYS support with support especially at green|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: yes she should - if nothing else, then maybe their side needs to save over 4@S (West is rated to have some kind of monstrous hand)|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: and maybe they can make 5@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed -though not here|pg||
nt|roswolf: at this vul east should probably bid 41S|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: and now she found the time to raise partner...|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|zyxzewski: which may be the right thing to do (although not now), but supporting partner on 4th would have been much more comfortable|pg||
nt|roswolf: north appreciates her hand is good but it is a phantom and she should have bid the round before to help her patrner judge the hand|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: transferring decision to partner "hey, i told you my story!"|pg||

nt|pef: seems like he should have worked that out.  hurd seemed marked for 1453, didn't he?|pg||
nt|stevo:  throughout the trials Fred has played outstanding from what I have seen so a rare lapse|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pef: presumably count in diamonds was known from their carding|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: an easy 4 @S for n/s |pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: yes fred is such a careful player on defense it is surprising|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|sybarra: not the "contructive" nature of N bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: *constructive|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|stevo:  surprised by the much thought|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cherilou: itf stayman with E hand what do you bid over 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: NS can make 3NT here, but its hard to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  will brad lead a Heart?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzff: quickly|pg||
nt|pef: yes )|pg||
nt|cherilou: was it really 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|stevo:  I like his lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: i thought they played 14-16|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge had to bid 3@H to stop the @H lead |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: obv not at this vul?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: dead silence here|pg||
nt|stevo:  looks like no way to make this|pg||
nt|pef: hard to see any way to make this|pg||
nt|cherilou: I know EW are aggressive but really..........|pg||
nt|pef: or even come very close|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: oh yea it is 16. half asleep here|pg||
nt|stevo:  he might win and play k@D hoping for duck by ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  according to the card 14-16 nv, 15-17 v|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: gitelman meditating|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  that will be expensive, especially after several @s leads|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S really optimistic|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has a nice hand, but too many losers, and knows the fit is only 6-2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: too optimistic id say|pg||
nt|blum1956: pd could have, say, @dA and @hk. Moreover, 4@sx down one may appear better than par|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  not exacly happening|pg||
nt|pef: I think hurd decided since if they had a spade fit game might be really good to take the risk of bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: if he can keep his losers to 4, thats fine|pg||
nt|blum1956: if 3NT making opposite|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|cherilou: and if not go -200?|pg||
nt|pef: probably playing for a doubleton ace of diamonds is his best bet to come close to making|pg||
nt|pef: or doubleton qj|pg||
nt|stevo:  I have to admit i like the K @D they duck it so often|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Greco hampson same auction and I know they play 14-16|pg||
nt|pef: probably not on this hand :)|pg||
nt|stevo:  im getting to use up all my bad luck running good|pg||
nt|pef: it's only the rueful rabbit who could duck with that diamond holding and be right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: that would make an interesting construction problem|pg||
nt|stevo:  to answer questions im getting its not that the k@D is such a great play I just find it to be winning they duck it with aq and aj so often|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: The tempo slows down the later rounds of the event|pg||
nt|pef: so what would you guys do after a strong nt with the east hand?|pg||
nt|stevo:  i would stayman |pg||
nt|pef: 2c wins if partner bids anything but 2h|pg||
nt|cherilou: NS probably play Smith--that should make this easy for Fred to return @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: and if he bids 2H might keep the opps out of 2@h :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am old and pessimistic; I pass|pg||
nt|blum1956: he needs the @dK doubleton for -1|pg||
nt|blum1956: If that King is with South|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|pef: phlegmatic in your dotage, Henry?|pg||
nt|henryb:  but everyone knows I am a nearly extinct Dinosaur|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: you were pessimistic when you were young Henry|pg||
nt|stevo:  im always thinking game or slam but I do go minus alot|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|henryb:  You didn't know me until I was already old|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: you were old 30 years ago?:)|pg||
nt|stevo:  now he has to guess whether to play k or low @D |pg||
nt|henryb:  about then: one year of marriage to Kitty and I was old|pg||
nt|stevo:  yikes Henry |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge asking about carding but cant hear|pg||
nt|pef: boy, you seemed young at heart when I played with you, Henry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge leans back in his chair and hugs himself|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: now fans open his cards|pg||
nt|henryb:  Young at heart but old in spirit|pg||
nt|stevo:  so is there a right @D play here Henry?|pg||
nt|pef: since they haven't played a spade yet, isn't low 2 to 1 right?  K would require an initial doubleton qj|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Expressing his thought process with his hands|pg||
nt|blum1956: If the declarer plays diamond before the 3rd trump he will not escape|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s2|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|stevo:  well qx might have ducked Peter|pg||
nt|blum1956: South needed to play a diamond back|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: yeah|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c8|pc|h5|nt|stevo:  seems like a guess to me|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|pef: true, but seems less likely|pg||
nt|henryb:  If you assume that a person would win with Qx or Jx, and would win either with QJ, Ax is more likely than a remaining stiff honor|pg||
nt|pef: needs to cash the ace of hearts now to beat it 2|pg||
nt|stevo:  most people would duck qx there imo|pg||
nt|henryb:  in the other handNorth would duck Quack x to get partner on lead, so ...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pef: but what would the j be played from?  |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: this will be a bit expensive |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|stevo:  ajx|pg||
nt|blum1956: he corrects the mistake now|pg||
nt|blum1956: he - the declarer|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5@H-1, meet 3@H+1... bd 2 that is|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c9|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|gulyas: well done for down 1, almost let it make|pg||
nt|blum1956: so only few juniors are optimistic|pg||

mb|d|nt|zyxzewski: West will not like partner's take-out double :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the weak 2 wont make the task any easier|pg||
mb|2S|nt|zyxzewski: i think it goes 2@S - 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm now that should catch 41S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: AND HAS|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|zyxzewski: probably the only way to succeed for defense is to start with two rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: IF that helps|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: no, in double dummy declarer can ruff the second high and then take trumps |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: with @S + @D breaking evenly this can make|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: really there is only 1 feasible line|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|zyxzewski: and if the spades happen to be 4-2, it's more likely that South has four of them, so declarer can concentrate on diamonds|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done no @D blockage|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: good unblock here|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|sA|pc|dJ|pc|h5|pg||

nt|vugraphzdt: yes, 6 boards per match|pg||
nt|roswolf: immediate restart or a short break?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: a short break|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: I'll close the broadcast when the other table finishes|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|pef: a heart.  that was hard to know|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: I see 4 spades went down in the other room |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|stevo:  so many pairs play 2@s constuctive but apparantly not this pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stevo:  they bid 1NT forcing then 2@s with the weak hand|pg||
nt|stevo:  Im surprised Brad didnt bid 2NT 2 places to play|pg||
nt|henryb:  I like bidding 2@s right away: far more preemptive|pg||
nt|stevo:  mabye they dont play that|pg||
nt|pef: well that's interesting, fred has the best hand at the table and everyone else has bid up to the 3 level|pg||
nt|stevo:  now is X penalties or takeout by Fred?|pg||
nt|pef: best in hcp at least|pg||
nt|stevo:  im guessing take out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Does it matter Stevo:)?|pg||
nt|pef: most would play it t/o I think|pg||
nt|stevo:  seems like he has it whatever he plays it as|pg||
nt|pef: 3n might make from the south seat|pg||
nt|stevo:  in my partnership it is takeout|pg||
nt|stevo:  he might bid 3nt to play|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stevo:  4NT is reasonable also|pg||
nt|blum1956: We have an excellent result for EW in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks like a club system of some sort|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzdu: sadly enough not here though|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|pef: play here should be pretty easy with clubs 22|pg||
nt|stevo:  not so easy|pg||
nt|pef: and this will be 19 boards in a row (I bet) with no swing bigger than 6 imps.  that must be getting close to a record|pg||
nt|stevo:  with 5 2 hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: and 6-1 @ds|pg||
nt|henryb:  Interesting comment. I only see 10 tricks|pg||
nt|cherilou: they opened the N hand in the other room|pg||
nt|pef: yes, my aged eyes miscounted, sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Moss deliberating|pg||
nt|stevo:  opening north is a lot with bad hearts even in precision|pg||
nt|stevo:  looks like he can make it by endplaying Hurd|pg||
nt|stevo:  not easy hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: i like light 1@h openings to protect from being preempted but would need to reverse the suits|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|d8|nt|sybarra: might have gone, 1 @D,-1 S-1 nt |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: IF  W bid at all |pg||
nt|gulyas: this promotes the @DJ|pg||
nt|gulyas: and one more @C to come|pg||
nt|gulyas: so just making here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gulyas: 4@S a bit lucky, but a decent contract|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphzff: a revoltin' development|pg||
nt|stevo:  yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pef: wasn't he cold if he just played k of diamonds and diamond toward the ace?  certainly if east ruffs he is|pg||
nt|stevo:  very hard hand Joe boo did great to make it in other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: well the good news for Brad is he has a count on the hand|pg||
nt|pef: which is what happened in the closed room|pg||
nt|pef: so he has to not ruff,|pg||
nt|henryb:  not clear: Barnet is trying to convince me that is was cold by winning two trumps, ruffing a heart in dummy and later wndplaying East in the majors|pg||
nt|pef: and then I guess he only can take one low ruff in dummy so does go down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Director hovering |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: seems early gor that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: for|pg||
nt|pef: so I think Eric Greco erred by ruffing.  that's difficult|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred  hunched over meditating. he knows this line cant be good for his side|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge sitting with a silly grin on his face like I got you dudes|pg||
nt|henryb:  I see that he is right, but when Wooldridge got to ruff a @d winner, that went out the window|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: He was trying to signal me with his hands but I have no idea WTF he is trying to say|pg||
nt|cherilou: loving your colorful commentary :) Barry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brad cant see him|pg||
nt|stevo:  so during this pause want to tell you about eating Sushi with Wooldridge and Hurd and if you ever do I reccoment you eat fast or go hungry|pg||
nt|pef: this is the mature adults table, apparently|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Got messaged from Gavin that he had a whole to do after board one and when he came back they are only on board 4!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: anyone timing this trick?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Director warns the table about time|pg||
nt|blum1956: I have an experience - that happened on the junior Europeans - when 2 consecutive boards ended with 7 (-1) one table and the game another table|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: I was the NPC of one of the teams|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: hehe|pg||
mb|2D!|an|Wilkosz|nt|pef: it's taken almost an hour for 4 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzdu: they started too soon its gonna be a few more minutes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  new heroes to follow|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok we will continue with Joe's song and dance routine |pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge writing a note to fred|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzff: Fred writing a note to Wooldridge|pg||
nt|stevo:  4@h looks interesting|pg||
nt|santyclz: On a winter's day, in a deep and dark December...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh we're back.|pg||
nt|sybarra:  http://www.bridge.ee/festival/invitational11.htm for on-line results - we should remember - it's pairs, so no imps score|pg||
nt|gulyas: I don't think there were happy sides, but at least one team gained...|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  trump lead looks best|pg||
nt|stevo:  hard to not lead your stiff though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I think when you take 10 min to play a card you should at least make the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: or was it one either way?|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: twoway|pg||
pc|c3|nt|stevo:  many pairs would play Souths double as showing 3 hearts doesnt look like they play that or mabye he called it 3?|pg||
nt|pef: I'll be very impressed if he leads a trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: being told that when you take THAT long its prob too late :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: i think Brad thinks its 3 cause he pointed at it when the tray came over|pg||
nt|blum1956: one either I mean|pg||
nt|gulyas: I see|pg||
pc|c9|nt|stevo:  i use to not lead my singletons but after being wrong 100 times in a row and under threat of death by bobby i now must|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Bobby knows best.... Just ask him :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cherilou: but @D still beats it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Bobby is Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|stevo:  does it?|pg||
nt|pef: no it doesn't|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I dont think so|pg||
nt|pef: they get a ruff but you still have 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stevo:  he will win and play club|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes only 1 ruff-sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: 3@h was alerted|pg||
nt|gulyas: so no gain, just pain...|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: what we are saying is that the imp score on our table is just a way to keep score, NOT the real score |pg||
nt|sybarra: the 4/1 spade break makes this a bit treacherous|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|pef: that's ok I was tired about being the only person making a mistake|pg||
nt|ferlema: more photos from the last set in Las Vegas: confsudbridge.org|pg||

nt|sybarra: but we didnt |pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh yes, this isn't matchpoints.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this plan works as well (if only 1 @d will be cashed)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Can cash 2 @Ds, w's ruff is with a natural.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes about to say same Joe|pg||
nt|sybarra: we just have to make the hand! |pg||
nt|santyclz: The problem comes if e started with 4 @ds so w can ruff the next.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzff: maybe endplay?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: In which case declarer has to take the @c finesse, which also works.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|stevo:  i dont see it but might be missing it|pg||

nt|stevo:  which director?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: cutting into his free time :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, but there are time limits specified, Barry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: brad has been ridiculous this set|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: in terms of time taken|pg||
nt|stevo:  looks like very nice defence by Wooldridge|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: other table on break so the director went to monitor them|pg||
nt|cherilou: in closed room didn't play @C K|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brad apologizes to the table yet again|pg||
nt|cherilou: he really doesn't want to go down again|pg||
nt|stevo:  ok time to re up my cocktails hard to keep up with Levin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: not like you dont have time to pour one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Is it still monday seems to be the question of the moment|pg||
nt|pef: still Monday in California|pg||
nt|henryb:  Its not like the other table is far ahead: they have not yet completed board 52|pg||
nt|pef: but this probably won't end until Tuesday on the East Coast|pg||
nt|henryb:  at this rate it may not end until Tuesday on the West coast|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: sorry was sleeping set over|pg||
nt|cherilou: sorry have to go thought I would get about 10 hands----nope. Bye and enjoy the show.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Brad still in a trance?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: yup|pg||
nt|pef: see on board 51, Lall and Grue had a bit of a bidding accident about what I double showed.  turned out wrong to play in the micro-Moysian (that's a 3-3 fit)|pg||
nt|henryb:  thanks Cherilou|pg||
nt|pef: can we get barry to tell him not to bother, the horse has already left the barn|pg||
nt|henryb:  non e permesso|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: room has been dead quiet|pg||
nt|henryb:  it was a very brief cheer followed by a groan|pg||
nt|stevo:  wow a card has been played during my cocktail break!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Director standing over me |pg||
nt|henryb:  as Brad retreats into sensory deprivation|pg||
nt|pef: sorry, Steve, we'll have barry tell them to stop doing that|pg||
