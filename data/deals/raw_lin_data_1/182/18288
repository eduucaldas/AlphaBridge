nt|dburn: still, might not be so easy for the defenders to cash out|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|pjs_ch: It's a most weak suit in which to overcall btu with a 5431 shape you do want to bid|pg||
nt|dburn: although North knows enough to cash the club next, at least|pg||
nt|dburn: unless West would ask for a club stopper with a void in clubs and nothing in spades, which seems unlikely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Lindsay's pondering this|pg||
nt|dburn: Burns ought to give count, not attitude, if North plays @cA next|pg||
nt|dburn: but I guess his signal will be the same in either case|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: the CC says standard count so yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that sounds like a cue bid, but it isnt |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: wonder where this is going|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think john H will bid on|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he is maximum with great controls|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: and 4@D must be a slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: spot on, Kath :)|pg||
nt|peachy: apparently they don'|pg||
nt|peachy: 't play transfer on the 2N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: it appears Gunnar forgot the system, 3@s explained as @h slam try - he's explaining now to opp what he thinks he has.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I suppose North is worried that JH has 16-18 balanced and therefore not enough for a slam|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: ahha that explains it , bidding the other major is a slam try agreeing the first major|pg||

nt|pjs_ch: potential 5 losers here, not so interesting for declarer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 down i expect|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: not that they will bid one at this rate - hard to see them getting beyond game|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: North didn't show his primary club support at all - I don't know why he doubled 3@s rather than bidding 5@c (or even 4@s)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: the double showed something-or-other but I didn't catch the explanation|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcomyn: wrong way up - thats why i hate weak nt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but you cant stay out of game with all those points|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: yes, strong NT would right-side it|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|mcarroll: and certainly will not make - but then neither will 3NT|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: no hurry for East to return a diamond here - he doesn't want to give the impression he has a doubleton|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nottin makes from s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would a strong NT right side it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: with 5cM, yes: 1@C-1@S-2@S-4@S?|pg||

nt|peachy: 4H is a nice catch|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: could have saved an IMP by opening 2@d and pretending to be strong balanced - that way, his side would have lost 400 in 3NT down four, rather than losing 420 against 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: doubled? :)|pg||

pc|hK|nt|dburn: 5@c would have enabled Burns to bid six, knowing of short spades opposite - it wasn't realistic to get to seven, but...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
mc|10|nt|dburn: still, I admit that this was difficult to foresee|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|an|14-16|mb|p|nt|dburn: better still, he could have opened 2@d and pretended to have a weak two bid in spades|pg||

nt|dburn: 2@h shows a bad hand with hearts|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: good case here for 2N being scrambling - saying to partner to pick a suit - that woudl have got to 3@C|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: 2N just isn't going to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: strong ten lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: here we go again with a 6-3 c fit - wears me out|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|dburn: even so, North might have bid 4@d rather than 4@h - slam is not out of the question|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|dburn: well, no one would seriously lead a club|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but it worked well|pg||
nt|yo_yo: really?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Hallberg demanding a spade?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems like it  |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Holland considering @sK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|dburn: and even with the bad hand South has, it doesn't need a lot more than the club finesse|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pjs_ch: but actually 3@C was going off anyway|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: pity hallberg has no entry |pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: still, that wasn't working, so no harm done|pg||
nt|dburn: still, a diamond was not out of the question - but the modern style is very much to lead as passively as you can after 1NT-all pass|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mcarroll: with that hand the only excuse for S to double rather than bid @Cs is that pd did not overcall a 5 card suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: Both partners held AKQT9x facing xxx in their suits|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|jcomyn: this is a true story - a dublin golf club advertised an open event fo ladies over 60 - they got 6 entries|pg||
