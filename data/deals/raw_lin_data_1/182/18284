nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|zebutin: interestingly they they have typed some of finnish players first names too, so from finland there are playing Pia Erkkilä and Hulda Ahonen, pair that plays strong club (15+)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: also welcome to Magnus|pg||
nt|haans: got that better |pg||
nt|haans: skipping bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Hans, Jon and Dan|pg||
pc|s3|nt|grebrof: the norwegians are playing a natural system with 5 card majors - the finnish girls prefer a strong (+15hp) 1@c|pg||
nt|sharkey: live update of scores & standings: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=475&csm=Rank&nt=3&nb=17&csh=0000000000111|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hawe45:  Frisk start med en oplagt slem...|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Hans and Dan|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|iceking: S took a rather passive view here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W can perhaps see, that 1@d is bid on a 4-card suit, so a small from dummy|pg||
nt|iceking: not sure i could play def vs 2@H here, though bidding is little strange also as you are not sure you have fitt anywere|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Gautis|pg||
nt|haans: Hej Roland Jon & Dan|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gautis2: hello, and good morning:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: He may be a bit biassed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wife playing as South|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is the winning contract - espescially now with the natural @d-lead from E|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  Kunne Ãst ikke have overmeldt med 4 Ru?|pg||
nt|grebrof: the norwegians are naturalists (besides the bery weak NT in nonvul 1st-3rd) opposite the more artificial approach from the finnish|pg||
nt|haans: finns Magic Diamond?|pg||
nt|grebrof: I have thai keyboard, so there is a chance for mistyping - bery = very|pg||
nt|haans: yes close for me 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: these two plays magid diamond . the other pair strong @c|pg||
nt|sharkey: I have the same problem Espen - not Thai but Thumbs....|pg||
nt|grebrof: lol|pg||
nt|grebrof: I will try to look before I post|pg||
nt|grebrof: back to the game...|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt  a make|pg||
nt|grebrof: this ended in a draw 15-15VP last meeting|pg||
nt|sharkey: Marianne Harding and Ann Karin Fuglestad are the anchor pair of the Norwegian team - many years international experience|pg||
nt|grebrof: duck a @D is a loser if @ds are QJ block, but will make 9 tricks anyhow|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|gautis2: figure i still not know her well enoghe since i dont have a clue what 3@h means:)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|iceking: was no rush for Ace of @D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  Hi - mys danish were just the daily exercises...|pg||
nt|iceking: low would keep better control af everything|pg||
nt|sharkey: undo?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|grebrof: Stine has had some very good results, so its about time she got her chance for the national team (gautis being biased or not)|pg||
nt|grebrof: she is NOT playing with you now my friend :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2NT may be with 5 hearts so bidding an error|pg||
nt|diaoff: Hi all|pg||
nt|haans: missed a trick |pg||
nt|haans: defense|pg||
pc|h3|nt|zebutin: different openings from 1st/2nd hand and 3rd/4th for finnish pair, but from 1st and 2nd they play weak nt, and 1@D-1@S openings are 10-14 and 4card suit|pg||
nt|gautis2: :) ..well, cant argue with sucess, since 4@s was born to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://score.winge.se/magic/www.php?nsid=475&csm=Rank&nt=3&nb=1&csh=0000000000111|pg||
nt|Walddk5: running scores|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes - Harding - Fuglestad also was part of the team that won last time at Lillehammer in 2007|pg||
nt|cenglund:  SpA was hardly discarded|pg||
nt|sharkey: She really pitched @SA on @C lead operator?|pg||
nt|haans: spade ace|pg||
nt|haans: on lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: Finland 2009 was the last championships I am told (thanks Geo) - looking at the unions homepage, you might get tricked|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - E sh come in first to play a heart through|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: and S has been cought already after trick1|pg||
nt|iceking: not so odd open room reached 4@H-3, |pg||

pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||

nt|psyck: Hi Magnus & Ralf|pg||
nt|haans: small spade from E|pg||
nt|haans: Denmark in lead :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|zebutin: and if some pairs card interests you http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.2354|pg||
nt|zebutin: has convention card for all players it seems|pg||
nt|grebrof: Gunn Tove was in the winning team in 2007 - then partnering Siv Thoresen who is by many considered being the best female player in Norway. for the first time in many years (dont ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: know hom many), she is not in the bracket this time|pg||
nt|diaoff: Starting the chase|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: a well deserved lead too|pg||
mb|d!|nt|hawe45:  Anyway, ti was easier to play than to bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: good start for Norway avoiding the impossible 4@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: some kind of Multi...|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
nt|haans: very high in hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 if E doesnt get a spade ruff|pg||
nt|diaoff: Need to find the @S ruff to beat 6@H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|zebutin: 1nt 15-17 from 3rd hand|pg||
nt|haans: easy make in 3nt at last board|pg||
nt|haans: very few will bid to slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: may be pushed if EW saves too much|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find diamonds|pg||
mb|4N!|an|minors|nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@s on NS|pg||
nt|iceking: good slam here |pg||
nt|iceking: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|grebrof: the +15 @c comes into action|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pass or Correct|pg||
nt|diaoff: 4NT now, maybe?|pg||
nt|haans: yep find it now|pg||
nt|jbgood: but of course difficult to know what to do on S's cards - doesnt know about the di void|pg||
nt|diaoff: If she passes, She will soon find out the possibility I guess|pg||
mb|5H|nt|psyck: lot of options for S|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They finished in 5@c last deal in open after some relay bids with 3 rounds of @h for -1|pg||
nt|jbgood: one push - yes, she will be wiser if W prefers @d|pg||
mb|d!|nt|psyck: chose drury|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@C probably one way drury|pg||
nt|sharkey: If N can find a take out x now....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@d showing a good opening with at least game interest|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D real opening,as i play myself here i would bid 3@D with north hand natural and slammish|pg||
nt|nubmaster: So a good start for Sweden here|pg||
nt|gautis2: partscore battle|pg||
nt|grebrof: as a guess I would think the dbl of 1@h from E is 5-7hp - their card says nothing about what "neg dbls" are|pg||
nt|gautis2: i guess x shows hp s not @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6@D had been my choice|pg||
nt|jbgood: dbl seems a bit much? Prd is likely to have 10 minor cards...|pg||
nt|haans: scary|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: 3@d a nice treatment there Magnus|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 3D/3H transfer nodays 3@C just showing max|pg||
nt|jbgood: so a doubled overtrick...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ianmcc: 4@h seems to need to find @dQ, tho 4th @s could be useful|pg||
pc|dA|nt|zebutin: in 4@H you would seem to lose 2 @S + @C, because spades are 3-3 you can throw one diamond to 4th spade|pg||
nt|zebutin: so might not need to quess diamond suit|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room finnish women played 2@S some down, there is magic diamond system in effect, that has 8-11 openings in 1st and 2nd hand, so makes often for different scores|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is a very good contract for NS|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck: N will likely blast to slam in spite of missing a keycard|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Anyone who can tell us about the bidding here? 2NT like good/bad NT or something?|pg||
nt|haans: thats a "modern" weak 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl from N is good seing the layout|pg||
pc|c2|nt|derric: good morning|pg||
pc|h3|nt|iceking: W made a very light 3rd seat opening in open room|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mbruun:  THis aggressive lead will cost the defense a trick, and HQ another one, so all of a sudden nine tricks turned to eleven. No big deal in teams though |pg||
nt|haans: scoring blood|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: wonder what 5@s here was|pg||
nt|iceking: 4nt might be even number of aces |pg||
nt|psyck: oh Turbo|pg||
nt|iceking: at least it looks like it |pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably negative|pg||
nt|iceking: been told 4nt shows 3+aces|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, not Turbo then, just their own methods|pg||
nt|iceking: nicely done anyway |pg||
nt|nubmaster: well done here, both K and J in @s works so no trouble with Q of @h offside|pg||
nt|gautis2: not fan of 4@h  ..better to do an invitasional bid after 2@s ...not this "shot"|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is sometimes the problem with strong 1@c - in a contested auction like this, you dont always know if 2@s is a bid with 4 or 5 @ss - now they escaped|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe...|pg||
nt|sharkey: may escape with down 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice to see such a young table in a very strong competition like this|pg||
nt|haans: dont understand @DA now does Fuglestad know who has @DK and Q|pg||
pc|d5|nt|zebutin: good day Juho, its allready 14.00 in finland...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Juho, 2100 in Melbourne|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks and next|pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like one loser in each suit|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|gautis2: y, should  be 200|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - 4 nt told about 4 @ds|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: after Souths free bid & jump to 4@s, N could have also bid slam other table, but was tougher after opps intervention i guess|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Back to nine again. Interesting|pg||
nt|gautis2: board 1 was a coopy of 3NT, so well done to both teams|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like the overtrick has gone - much easier for us seeing all cards to make 12 of course|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|hT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|grebrof: otherwise I agree with not bidding 4@h (allthou it looks like P has a single @s) but P only made a single raise - guess they have ways to show a better raise - well, the ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: vulnerability is "right", so can understand 4@h too|pg||
nt|diaoff: Unless color blind, the opps also know the vulnerabilities, so I also vote for 6@D.|pg||
nt|haans: and play must be safe|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|haans: best defense|pg||
nt|diaoff: Thats also easier from here than at the table though...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nubmaster: In Open Marie and Pia get to 4@h which seems to be doomed, especially when E lead a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was a bad play. return @cJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and defence will have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|nubmaster: why not finessing @h first round... doesn't matter if E got the Q alone... E indicates both A and Q of @s because of the play|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|iceking: 1@S in closed room was the problem, for sure S should have bidded more powerful bid then 1@S|pg||
pc|h9|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: OR 550 RW|pg||

nt|haans: are they having a talk?|pg||
nt|jbgood: not a perfect start for the Norse ladies|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: Jessica missed their chance|pg||
nt|nubmaster: yes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
mc|11|nt|gautis2: FInland bought 2@h in OR, so this willbe 7 imps to Finland..edit: 11 imps, 2 down|pg||
nt|gautis2: ..12 :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: thank god the BBO is helping us :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: is there a break?  (catfight? :) )|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: the director is coming here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Visst|pg||
nt|grebrof: viewing all 4 hands is sometimes a snag, cause you never know what they be thinking - pauses that might make a difference at the table are not always felt the same way by us|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: the Norweigen girls are asking about their bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont know the finnish strengt in a catfight, but I guess the norwegians are mediocre there :)|pg||
nt|gautis2: pherhaps 2@s bid is explained as something else?  Cant see the line of play if it is "as it is"|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont think N has a case here|pg||
nt|gautis2: i do.. :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down|pg||
nt|diaoff: All for the excitement :)|pg||
nt|haans: is that correct English = Norse?|pg||

nt|grebrof: the contract is wrong and there are more failures that awaits when you are there|pg||
nt|grebrof: normal frisky nonul opening from S|pg||
nt|sharkey: that is a WEAK 3@H....|pg||
nt|grebrof: I like it|pg||
nt|sharkey: been there - done that...:)|pg||
nt|haans: she had no perfect bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: N thinking slam?|pg||
nt|grebrof: as they said about Marty Bergens preempts like that: "It doesnt matter what you have, its still not good enough"|pg||
mb|d!|nt|mbruun:  Sounds reasonable|pg||
mb|2S|nt|iceking: S bid 4@S and east dbl |pg||
nt|gautis2: victory |pg||
nt|gautis2: good to stop...system victory|pg||
mb|3C|nt|zebutin: Ahonen has quite bad values for balancing at red zone, even though has decent 6 card suit...but risks are quite high|pg||
nt|iceking: will be disaster if w gamble on 5@C here|pg||
nt|psyck: bot at this vul maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: *not|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hawe45:  No comments...|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: option ofcourse but will catch very bad dummy and on best def will go for 1100|pg||
nt|haans: and spade lead?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Guess she asked for it - now just make it....|pg||
nt|grebrof: this CAN make|pg||
nt|haans: home if hearts better|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: when she doesn't balance it argues bad spades|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oh dear... system error|pg||
nt|grebrof: N showing 20-21hp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this will probably run to the J, and N will switch to a Major. the question is - which one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: Looks like 140 in sight for EW|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  Ah - East wanted to know, which major South had, before bidding 3 NT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Here you'd like to play canapé, first showing 4c @s and then longer @d but there's no room for that|pg||
nt|grebrof: the good @c-suit being the missing hp|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I bet she is not going to make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even be 170|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gautis2: y, fair upgrade|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yuval10: @s looks reasonable enough|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They play transfer bids over 1@c, ie 1@d=@h etc...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mbruun:  Careful defense will hold this to nine tricks, if South ducks heart in trick 2|pg||
nt|psyck: not a good start for Iceland|pg||
nt|iceking: might be the worsed possible dummy W could get|pg||
nt|iceking: now @D return and 4 down for 1100|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but major suit wastages were known on bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but couldn´t W suspect bad @s honours on E?|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Christer|pg||
nt|haans: yep my money on that 2|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is always a wrong line, but ok|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yuval10: you only need from partner something like HXX for it to be very successful. not this time though|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Alsowithout ducking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if 1@h shows @s - why not bid the 6-card @d?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|iceking: if w was on heat one dummy would be J9xx AKx Ax AJxx and 5@C is easy make |pg||
nt|gautis2: but this will probably fail by 1..  so i presume 4 more imps to Finland,..  I need my coffee..brb:)|pg||
nt|haans: We have had long diskussion From Norway are Norwegian but also Norse = old version|pg||
pc|s2|nt|grebrof: unlucky |pg||

nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|yuval10: hello|pg||
pc|s5|nt|derric: might go down now|pg||
nt|nubmaster: But shouldn't W bid 1@s as 2-3 @s and minimum?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jbgood: anyone for a double from W of 3 @c ? |pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: why @HK - ruff @S and low up better...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|grebrof: the finnish is using reversed carding . the 2 showing an equal number of cards in @cs|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no hope|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will not play @C - so 4 tricks to N/S anyway|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Agree Ralf, an error in the system here or a bidding misunderstanding, think it's the first one though|pg||
nt|nubmaster: I'm sure 2@d is conventional here so there was no room for it as natural|pg||
pc|h3|nt|grebrof: I think it is a good slam and noone would have made it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  If your prempts can be such as in this case, partner should me more cautious|pg||
nt|haans: but lucky no clubs lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: live by the sword - die by the sword....|pg||
nt|cenglund:  be|pg||
nt|haans: Final Norse: lennartj: Norseman=Viking eller nordbo|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yuval10: declarer has 7 tricks even without the @d finesse - 2@c, 1@h, 1@s, 1@d, so had South played @d, it was possible that E would just play the Ace|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|haans: oldest of them all|pg||
pc|sA|nt|derric: conceding down 1 now i suppose|pg||
nt|derric: oh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can´t understand why a 4-card is more important to show than to bid 1@d|pg||
pc|s4|nt|iceking: 800 for 14imps |pg||
nt|nubmaster: But perhaps E will skip the @s and just go for the @ds from the start, it's teams and gamebonus looks really far away|pg||
nt|ralfwil: !½s10|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c10...|pg||
nt|yuval10: unless NS are playing 2nd/4th carding , then the K@d is marked|pg||
pc|s6|nt|nubmaster: 2@d direct is weak with @ds but she prefered showing the @ss first and then after a possible 1@s/1NT she could've used XY-NT to 2@d|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Cost 7 imp for just a partscore|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Is there a break or something op?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|psyck: true ...(3@s there)|pg||

nt|grebrof: defensive errors like this is something that might effect your play later|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead wudnt matter Hans - stiff...|pg||
nt|grebrof: @c lead does defeat it, but - well not in this case|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I am from old school and I don't accept pre-empts like this in 1st and 2nd hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  N/S have no need for Blackwood on this board - one down...|pg||
nt|grebrof: Ahonen surely would have played the A of @d - IF she had it|pg||
nt|sharkey: So preempt so far not a success in this match...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|zebutin: part score battle, where fit isnt to be found|pg||
nt|gautis2: i was about to say this is a "quiet" 4@s, but in OR they ve reached 6@s -2  .. |pg||

nt|haans: slam |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ralfwil: I think there is some undo now....|pg||
nt|grebrof: the opening is +4-5 in the majors - norwegians got a bit too high in the open room|pg||
nt|gautis2: undo:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: redo the bidding!|pg||

nt|jbgood: y - 3@d was a nice bid|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  1 NT is not everybodyÂ´s taste|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@D was 11-16 or (11)12-13bal...so might end up too high|pg||
nt|derric: is north's hand unbal or did she upgrade to 12-13 bal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely|pg||
nt|grebrof: normally the opening would show 10-143-9hp, so I guess they will not get overboard at this table|pg||
nt|grebrof: ooops - 3-9p|pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s now|pg||
nt|haans: even thinking Grand|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S a jump voidwood?|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|iceking: NS are one of the best women pair in europe, been pdship for man years. Icelandic pair has less experience in international events|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: cards well placed here for a few o/t's|pg||
nt|iceking: N with some dubious holdings took the passive view here and didnt compete|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D shows @H|pg||
nt|yuval10: the only way of reaching 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 2@s shouls show a good 3 carder now|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess your guess is as good as any|pg||
mb|6D|nt|sharkey: Dbl = 3 @H|pg||
nt|haans: dbl = 3 spades (sipport doubles more and more popular)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  2 down on a @S-lead, it seems|pg||
nt|mbruun:  I dont mind 5cM for a NT, but a strong suit without the ace is not clear to open 1 NT|pg||
nt|cenglund:  4S is makeable in board 19|pg||
nt|sharkey: this shud make I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: as South denied 4 @s's earlier, the message from 2@s should be clear|pg||
nt|psyck: S has enuf on the auction to make a game try now|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't really understand 3@c from N then, would expect 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: can be 10 tricks now|pg||
mb|p|nt|derric: wonder if 2@s is game-force or invite|pg||
nt|derric: apparantely latter|pg||
nt|zebutin: hearts are well for declarer, everything else little less so...|pg||
nt|zebutin: lead might give 1 @C trick more|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @h and @c friendly|pg||
nt|gautis2: wd Finland, and they have a great start of this game!|pg||
nt|grebrof: reversing with  a single was not the best idea from Marianne Harding it seems|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd Opinion: shogunng: think so Helle plays woidwood|pg||
nt|diaoff: Excl RKC according to CC|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: easiest a clubs finesse?|pg||
nt|diaoff: Best to play on @H I'd say|pg||
nt|haans: need a lot of thinking|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hawe45:  In fact, the North hand is no so strong - the @DÂ´s doubtful values|pg||
nt|mbruun:  With no aces you should subtract 1 HCP from the hand. Good intermediates are a plus on the other side|pg||
nt|gautis2: seems like a not agreed auction in OR|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe she wanted to bid 3@h :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure splinters with only 3card support is the best, but I am not playing this event :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psyck: if 4@c instead, they could have possibly landed in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is still making though, so NS did well enough|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure - but the @D-doubleton is not so great|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, clubs depend quite much how you play them that how friendly they are...with this lead they are friendly enough|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gautis2: i m sure it was a "slip of the mind" ..happens to all of us :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mbruun:  Right|pg||
nt|zebutin: and seems 3@H + 2@S + 2@C + @D make enough tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|zebutin: though might go after @D|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: Harding have no diamond|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|grebrof: where is the @c K?|pg||
nt|psyck: doubling & then cueing is very strong action, so I think 3@c was ok, so has more than enuf with an A & a K to go to game after that i guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|iceking: 10 tricks for one imp gain for Denmark|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|derric: 3@D 1@h 2@s 2@c would do too|pg||
pc|h9|nt|grebrof: @d K - @s ruff|pg||
nt|haans: North may have AQJ in hertas and @DJ but @SQ?|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess if you sum it up, taking the finness in @s was just as goood|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good switch|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, even with playing on @D makes|pg||
nt|grebrof: for some of us more often than for others|pg||
pc|c2|nt|grebrof: well, you are endplayed if the @s-finesse dont work . N playing a @d to the K in dummy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: must discard a @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or a @d|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nubmaster: Yes, no good to just ruff and play ace of @s and then minor cards, S will have a @h left together with a tr|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think South did very well with her hand, to be honest i'd expect N's hand to be AQJX X KTX AKQXX or something like that, then slam is laydown|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Good Cl 10 to emphasize doubleton spade|pg||

nt|hawe45:  But this might work - and West will not "sell out"|pg||

nt|grebrof: the small cards in dummy makes it easier to overtake the Q too, cause there are many layout where N will have a @h-suit good enough for it to run later|pg||
nt|gautis2: as I can see, I am agree..|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  No RD, please, that would loose 2 IMPÂ´s to 2140|pg||
nt|zebutin: well trumps cant be too badly, and with diamond lead neither can any other suits either so has enough entries&etc|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Sry, not Mikael, it was his dad, Johan who told me :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 3@H I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  A sporty 3 NT N/S here|pg||

nt|derric: overcall for me|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe a simple 4@h p/c by W now|pg||
nt|nubmaster: We'll propably se some action here|pg||
nt|nubmaster: In Open EW made a wrong decision to sacrifice vs 5@h but didn't get it doubled which is really difficult|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hawe45:  Undo|pg||

mb|d|nt|zebutin: i must confess i would have just bid 1@S...|pg||
nt|zebutin: even though hand is good|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cenglund:  Not so far-fetched play given the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: not so good methods here for ew. |pg||
nt|haans: right, double in my book not hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: for sure W should decl with his holding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 4@c from W = bid your suit under, and contract on the strong hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, some play 4@c |pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead needed I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  If West finds the killing lead, they will call the police|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Will make in practice|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 1@s could be passed out (but I agree)|pg||
nt|derric: partner is likely to raise on any 3+ support|pg||

nt|iceking: with everything breaking nicely this should make |pg||
nt|gautis2: this seems like a flat boars..  this time I almost bet I m right:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2 last hands are rather routine|pg||
pc|d2|nt|diaoff: Another of those easy 4@S|pg||

pc|d5|nt|sharkey: still time to switch|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|derric: though some pass all 7-counts opposite overcall|pg||
pc|s6|nt|zebutin: mostly matter of partnership agreements and individual bidding style|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mbruun:  With 9 HCP partner is weak, so heart is more natural in teams. Partner cant have a strong spade holding|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|psyck:  will play @h 1st & can fin @s into safe hand later if reqd|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h is automatic in trick 2 in order to take out a possible entry to E's hand|pg||
nt|diaoff: Norway will need some other kind of boards now|pg||

nt|cenglund:  I can't understand S's reasoning. The board is like an open book|pg||
nt|haans: @HK Big|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: sometimes running your winners will squeese your opponents - can be a good strategy even if you dont have enough tricks to begin with too|pg||
nt|sharkey: N shud hardly have Ax in @C as wud overtake and return 1. trick|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: 1@S 17+|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D|pg||
nt|haans: hard fight here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|diaoff: Potential for some action, yes|pg||
nt|haans: not all just overcall|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|zebutin: what to bid on Johanssons 2@H ?|pg||
nt|gautis2: 500 is a good score.. 4@h seems like few loosers, but not enough winners?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can they bid the slam?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 0-7|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 3@d|pg||
nt|iceking: should have no problems stop in 4@H here|pg||
nt|psyck: 5 level is safe too i guess|pg||
nt|iceking: would be good to have 3@H forcing here |pg||
nt|nubmaster: If 2NT shows the red suits why not start with 4@h and then 5@d? But N took it for the minors because of the fact that the 1@c opening is 2+?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I guess without the @s lead, you can possibly make some @d-tricks, but|pg||
nt|haans: system works well here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - think they'll bid slam|pg||
nt|haans: but Blackwwod a problem = 2 keys missing|pg||
nt|haans: urp|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: 4@S not doubled Optimal contract|pg||
nt|diaoff: Expected a Dbl there, yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: must start on @d at once to win this - and use @d to pull S's 4th trump - very difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: lucky that N has all the aces|pg||
nt|jbgood: club ace with S and the contract would stand no chance on best def|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|iceking: and that is logical if bypass @D with marginal canape hands|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h will now be frcd after 4th suit bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but 4@d will also do and after 4@h = no @s control|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Forcing?|pg||
nt|gautis2: this play will take sometime..belive me:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mbruun:  Denmark gained 7 IMP on board 5, because South unblocked her AK of hearts in due time, so 7 Sp X was five off|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a happy spot|pg||
nt|zebutin: well no double... seems like 2 down or something|pg||
nt|grebrof: I assume the 5 from E|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they play count when Q is at the table|pg||
nt|gautis2: not best lead.. may make now|pg||
nt|haans: yep 0-7 is 0-7|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|iceking: so 3@H and now S will deny @S control so should end in 4@H|pg||
nt|iceking: Danish que-bidding style is though little odd at least i have never understood it|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S shows interest in slam perhaps N shud be able to bid it based on @H length and max|pg||
nt|grebrof: Magic Diamond comes from Sweden originally, but many play it in  Finland too - they are more artificial in Sweden-Finland than we are in Norway-Denmark - I have myself sat down ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: that 1@c meant either a) 5-11hp any suit or b) 17hp+ any distribution - conventions like that are not allowed in Norway, but it is fun, isnt it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: East are at the bathroom|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The play of the Finnish ladies has been mildly put rather sloppy|pg||
nt|haans: i do assume they would not bid 1@H with A+K|pg||
nt|grebrof: when do you get to go, Johanna?|pg||
nt|haans: 52% slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be S or N shud have made more efforts here....|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iceking: undo|pg||
nt|gautis2: ..but a fair normal lead|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Spade must be attacked otherwise diamonds will be established|pg||
nt|grebrof: curiousity is always there with AK in a suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: we see what you mean Magnus :)|pg||
nt|iceking: so 3@S could maybe ask for @S control |pg||
nt|iceking: Danish asking bid i think they call it|pg||
nt|gautis2: God have given u an ace for one reason...take it!|pg||
nt|gautis2: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: that card was meant for entry to dummy...|pg||

nt|jbgood: ok - no duck and no dinner:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: but it aint over yet|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: and 13 tricks - next|pg||
nt|iceking: ok 3@S was here some slam potential without shortness|pg||
nt|grebrof: hard to see any reason for the trumpshift|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|iceking: so in a way they didnt know @S quebid was on or missing |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Even spade shift may not be enough to set the contact|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gautis2: as long @h K stiff, I think this was home after lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s-shift - and then?|pg||
nt|gautis2: dia|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok, bang down @h A and small @c later from W|pg||

pc|sA|nt|gautis2: did we get the result  of board 2 Johanna?  |pg||
nt|cenglund:  This a better slam than the previous one|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ianmcc: some prospects|pg||
nt|zebutin: in other room they got to open 1@H telling 4+ @H and 8-11...and after that sailed to 3nt|pg||
nt|derric: 3NT went down after declarer broke entries in open|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Cards are not lying in favour of making 6NT|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|zebutin: this lead destroys one entry to @C suit, but give ruffing finese in @S suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: became a winner - 500 was available|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gautis2: and they figure it out, so a  stop...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finnish ladies avoided the tempation|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I think the director chosed to let it be (4heartsx-2), but I'm not shore!|pg||
nt|grebrof: not that I can see EW doing something viable over 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may have bid 4@S with West hand - but 5332 distribution is a negative|pg||
nt|santyclz: 29 hcp so it may not be automatic to get there.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|zebutin: so if takes that, she is losing 2@D + @H|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Maybe 4@s here|pg||
nt|gautis2: ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: I wouldnt change that board 2 either|pg||
nt|grebrof: but ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: not the best lead here|pg||
nt|grebrof: if there is any|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|nubmaster: good bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep, surely not 7... 6 will probably be good enough|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|ianmcc: it removes a useful entry|pg||
nt|psyck: stopping low with a key card missing & the 3@d x|pg||
nt|haans: rersponder tend to make transfers all the time|pg||
pc|h5|nt|iceking: i dont really understand why east didnt dbl 3@D|pg||
nt|iceking: east should know dummy in 3@D dbl will hold most often 0-1@D and very few hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: this might be a chance for the Swedes in the OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly left the door open.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|nubmaster: They must continue @d after the 2 @c to take away the entrance to E|pg||
nt|psyck:  as usual, minor slams with borderline values tuf to get to|pg||
nt|yuval10: using a natural system it looks like 1NT - 2@c - 2@h  - 3@d and then N should lead the way with 3 keycards and a Q of trump|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|psyck: double dummy, you can reel off 8 tricks in the majors & squeeze South in the minors for the rest|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|gautis2: I told it was a close group a while ago, with 2 VP fom 1st to 3rd...  as we speak, it is actually thighter! (1 VP 1st-3rd :))|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianmcc: wrong pitch, I think she needed @cK onside|pg||
nt|zebutin: discarded @C so doesnt have to take @C finese, but @D suit is so lousy they will not raise as any extra tricks, so needs Ax(x) in front of @D K|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|nubmaster: @d now or she makes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: even 1NT would have been transfer|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam bidding not the strength of the Finnish women in this match|pg||
nt|grebrof: last board was the first nonconquested auction NS had - EW are not known for being shut off|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|vugraphzdq: Vist Gunn says that she would have play different if she had get the correct information and then only loose one trick, so the result only would be down one|pg||
nt|grebrof: if any ladies form Faroe Islands are watching, I hope you soon come up with a team that can compete in this championships - there is a bye in the womens group - shich in my mind it ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: shouldnt|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mbruun:  Game over |pg||
nt|zebutin: ofcourse can still take @C finese if wants to, but little riskier|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South will not hav to fear a singleton @C - in case, this would have been played earlier - and faster...|pg||
nt|derric: so E should lead @c after @hQ to remove choices|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: and now clubs ruff|pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Not knowing their system it's hard to assign responability but with akxxxx and 3 2nd round controls s seems to have gone quietly.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck:  or transfer to @d & bidding @s|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yuval10: possible continuation is 3@s - 4@c - 4@h .... |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|yuval10: in 7@d all you need to do is to ruff out the K@h in East in order to make 13 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|derric: not that @c|pg||
pc|c4|nt|zebutin: @C K wasnt the shift that was needed...|pg||

nt|mbruun:  I think this was misscored|pg||
nt|hawe45:  miss-score for the ladies|pg||
nt|iceking: slam made in open room so 11 imps to Denmark|pg||
nt|grebrof: a club lead here is a disaster, but 5@d is safe|pg||
nt|grebrof: or, is it...|pg||
nt|haans: i would not have opened 1@H = no opening only 8-11 hcp|pg||
nt|sharkey: on Bd 22 4@S also made in OR - quite surprising...|pg||
nt|haans: mayor error in diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h was 8-11 and prob 3 card support - so 5@h was not to be recommended - trumps might easily have been 4-1 |pg||
nt|jbgood: and even 4@h might have been in trouble|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cenglund:  It's not on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|derric: @s overcall?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: undo|pg||

nt|grebrof: well - if you have a fit, its a lot more than just 11hp|pg||
nt|haans: now 1@S is right|pg||
nt|sharkey: lots of voids in these hands - who's been dealing?|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt going down down down|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H no make|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ralfwil: 3nt?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|grebrof: @d lead (a trump lead) kills 5@s too|pg||
nt|grebrof: 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Vore kampe kl. 15.00 efter lunchpausen bliver Island-Danmark Open og Sverige-Finland Damer|pg||
nt|grebrof: I see swedish juniors open frequently at 8-9hp bal -  its their style - no system is perfect|pg||
nt|haans: NS bidding right this far|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H uppercut in clubs|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 3 is too high since S will get a heart promotion|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Another grand slam|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Two grands in nie hands. Good cardshufflers|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: yes the last one was misscored, it was equal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and good bidders|pg||
nt|haans: would have preferred 3@H to 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: offshape overcall with 4cards, offshape x without 3rd @D...so many options for bidding...|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 1nt is 12-14. Last hand w opened 1nt with bal 13hcp|pg||
nt|ralfwil: dbl is 500|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@H is some bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: no hcp no shape no controls |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|grebrof: never buy a thai keyboard - mainly I am guessing :D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The blockage in hearts is awkward for declarer in 5D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: low score|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody steals from e.  5332 with a marginal (?) suit.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mbruun:  You have to play some kind of Exclusion-blackwood to bid it. Very difficult|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @C (W) - 4 @H (E) - 5 NT - how difficult can you make it, Culbertsonour good old freind|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I exclude exclusion|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Board 6 is also misscored. Hopefully they will be corrected shortly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph lead is normal on the bidding|pg||
pc|sA|nt|derric: 1@c is 15+ i believe|pg||
nt|zebutin: but i think they have some bid over strong @C that tells majors, so even that could have been option...|pg||
nt|derric: i don't know if x is take-out|pg||
pc|s4|nt|grebrof: not sure I would have bid in these circumstnces anyway|pg||
pc|s2|nt|zebutin: seems like will lose atleast 3 @S, @D and @C...and cant raise @D suit either before has removed all trumps, and might lose control because of @C suit...|pg||
nt|zebutin: so needs some delicate play|pg||
nt|iceking: east should signal with @S K here|pg||
nt|haans: in scandinavia we all use reverse carding|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|grebrof: not all|pg||
nt|yuval10: South needs to switch to @c before she cash the 2nd @d of course|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mbruun:  In the Open series, the Danish West, HC Graversen lead the HA to beat 3 NT by one on board 6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I doÂ´nt know heir system (either) - but 4 @C from West instead of 3 @H would have been better|pg||
nt|cenglund:  This may be a huge swing|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck: maybe worried @sK would suggest @d pref|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1@c opening in the other room contains a whole lot of diffferent stuff, so not that strange that lead wasnt found|pg||
nt|gautis2: yes, will be 11 imps to Norway|pg||
nt|grebrof: allthou I do prefer it|pg||
nt|haans: but: shogunng: but you have to take sps first|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Next board...|pg||
nt|mbruun:  It seems strange to give up the investigations|pg||
nt|iceking: yes probably thinking about that|pg||
nt|santyclz: She was listening...|pg||
nt|jbgood: halfway through - and N has not scored a single imp..|pg||
nt|diaoff: Needed to score the club trick first|pg||
nt|jbgood: the pure downer has gone now - S needed to cash 2 clubs - but a club to the king and another is testing, E will have to double finesse @h 10-9 to make it|pg||
pc|cT|nt|nubmaster: I think 4@s will make so 5@h will probablu be correct... anyone to analyse if 4@s can be set?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cenglund:  Defence can't afford a slightest slip |pg||
pc|c6|nt|zebutin: this seems to be on road for atleast 1 down at this rate|pg||
nt|zebutin: but with @C return is able to raise @C suit, so defence needs to be sharp too|pg||
nt|derric: 4 black suit ruffs and @DAK@hAK would make 8|pg||
nt|sharkey: Marianne had a difficult decision over 4@S - 5@D not a winner this time as 4@S wud have failed|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mbruun:  How about 5D after 4c. When partner shows two aces bid 5 N and partner will cuebid 6 H which will get them to the grand. Maybe they have other agreements of course|pg||
nt|haans: so the big question is Will 3@H make |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 4@c helped, of course|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: will not do|pg||

mb|p|nt|zebutin: so might be small gain to finns|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|haans: 6@H has a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: now N might gamble on 3nt |pg||

nt|iceking: i bet she will gamble on 3nt, been very agressive so far|pg||
nt|psyck: leb may not apply here anyway|pg||
mb|2N|nt|psyck: can make a lot with majors favorable|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  DoesÂ´nt matter - it forces East to show the suits with control, and 4 @H is a true dream to hear|pg||

nt|mbruun:  Thick single some players call it |pg||
nt|mbruun:  Any play for 3 NT here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mathias, please take a look at the defence, I just figured out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6-7 tricks N/S - or so|pg||
nt|jbgood: operator - didnt 3 @h go down?|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 2@c and 2 aces|pg||

nt|psyck: now dummy can be killed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course, there was no indication that @cs were so unevenly divided.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c should be a @d signal|pg||

mb|p|pc|sA|nt|mbruun:  But declarer can only come to eight tricks any way|pg||
nt|jbgood: N has shown 20-21, and 2@d was waiting - showing cards|pg||
nt|diaoff: Not straightforward on a @D lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: if could be a bigger pickup if this goes down, say if dec reads cards wrong|pg||

nt|psyck: *now more|pg||

nt|yuval10: something like final match today at 17:40 Final-Sweden? :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mbruun:  Forget the 10 IMPs for Denmark on board 8, and the 3 IMP for Norway on board 6. Difficulties in correcting these scores, but they are not right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so far-fetched for West to double 3 NT and take the 800 on a normal @S-lead. If you doÂ´nt now and then write 750 for the opponents, you havÂ´ent doubled enough|pg||
nt|mbruun:  The actual standing should be 20-16 for Norway|pg||

nt|gautis2: 3N is reached..seems like a flat board |pg||

pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I have been told, that 6 @C is possible - would you make it Mathias??|pg||
nt|mbruun:  North cant raise without heartcontrol, unless partner hesitates before 5 C. In that case director will be called and the score will be corrected if slam is on. So North did the right thing|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it seems right, probably South will make the 12 tricks here also|pg||
nt|mbruun:  I think 6C is lay down with S K onside. Five spadetricks, six clubtricks and the DA|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Five clubs in hand and a diamond ruff. Shoudnt represent any troubles|pg||
nt|mbruun:  A sneaky spadelead will keep this to 11|pg||

mb|4H|nt|derric: does west bid a slam on her own here too|pg||

nt|ianmcc: no of course @c8|pg||
nt|zebutin: you can use 3rd @C as connection and come back with @D A to hand to cash rest of @C|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Jessicas opening here will get NS off from the bad 3NT contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Might consider a spadeovercall with the West hand. Obvious in pairs in my opinion|pg||

nt|sharkey: what if pd has 11?|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps VUL wud have bid 2 NT?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|derric: maybe W should have enquired over 4@h for @hK, still doesn't know the 4th @h though|pg||

nt|sharkey: draw back of the system shown on this hand|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|derric: to play?|pg||

nt|zebutin: or...maybe not... :)|pg||
nt|derric: i thought 5@s was asking here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|derric: maybe 5@s is relay to play 5NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  2 @S should be the normal contract now|pg||

nt|sharkey: Have to avoid two @H losers here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  EW were caught for 500 in the other room on board 14, so Denmark now in the lead 24-20. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: if can trump 2X@d in dummy it looks OK-ish|pg||
nt|iceking: i play it takout not sure why though, i just fallow orders from my pds dont really think logical about it if its good or bad methods:)|pg||
nt|pelu: for me Ns X = penalty|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: ant this is a typical example when it´s necessary to act immediately and not intend balance|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and...|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Well some kibbs say thieves but you won't get any points placing the green ones at the table eihter|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Good stop by the Norwegians|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's easy to remember. Under the suit = takeout, over the suit = penalty|pg||
nt|grebrof: again: seeing all 4 hands makes you sleep|pg||
nt|gautis2: last board, and seems like this match will end in a friendly score of VP 15-15|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah|pg||
nt|haans: no if they say 17+ hcp they must have 17+ hcp|pg||
nt|psyck: ya minors are dying a natural death, with no one bibbing them naturally anymore|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun:  Last hand, the play resumes at 12.40|pg||
nt|pelu: agree|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Declarer should have played trumps only twice and ruffed the 4th diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: yes, ruffing diamonds shouldnt be too hard|pg||
nt|sharkey: Best contract here is 5@C I think|pg||
pc|c4|nt|derric: entry problem i think|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|haans: then @HK must be right|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ianmcc: best lead - damages communications|pg||
nt|derric: unless you play @S:s immediately|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|grebrof: thank you all for watching . we tried to be funnier, but us: Christer, Kjell Gaute and me are a boring bunch - we hope to improve with all our jokes at a latter point in time :)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The match is a draw|pg||
nt|grebrof: Jx or single in @ds would made little difference, but ok|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Not the contract s dreamed about when she picked up her hand.|pg||
nt|yuval10: down 2 ?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jbgood: trump might have worked better - not much went Norway's way in this match - but full credit to the Danes!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mbruun:  130 NS since declarer can dispose of his clubloser on dummies two majortricks|pg||
nt|iceking: most importand you and your pd play it the same way|pg||
nt|gautis2: tx all|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mbruun:  See you soon for more good and entertaining bridge|pg||
nt|iceking: and obvious here there is a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, promotion coming|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|haans: not wrong|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|grebrof: no - unlucky|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|diaoff: Still a bit difficult though|pg||
pc|d7|nt|grebrof: the other wat|pg||
nt|yuval10: was hard for E to envision it after J@h ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: a well deserved victory and pool position before tomorrow's last 2 rounds|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: didnt matter, N has no easy way to hand & has to promore anyway|pg||
nt|santyclz: Still there though, just self-inflicted.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: the slam in 15 : 680 at all tables in Open|pg||
nt|yuval10: that was the last board, see you in 1H i persume|pg||
