mb|1C!|nt|mdgraham: deal for partnership parameters, that - if double is ok on the Norh hand, then 3@S is a bit pushy on the South one |pg||

nt|roswolf: dbl looks odd|pg||

nt|stevo:  this will get a club lead but Wooldridge has no chance to guess it right(unless the lead is the club king)|pg||

nt|pef: steve or henry, would you bid only 3s there?|pg||

nt|pef: in the closed room, slam tries are being made :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brad agrees . Shaking his head in mock disgust Stevo. As he works out the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Perfect "midnight-swiss" weak 2...|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|pef: through a transfer after overcall auction, 4 spades is being played from the short side, so south didn't have|pg||
nt|pef: much of a problem leading the ak of hearts and the ace of diamonds |pg||
nt|stevo:  here declare doesnt know its a stiff and might go down |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: asks about leads told 3/low|pg||
nt|pef: so a 6 imp gain, that seems undeserved|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|stevo:  the 2@h opener wrong sided this|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: now a diamond ruff and a club back beats this|pg||
nt|pef: while we are waiting, time to thank my fellow commentators Steve and Henry (and the others who have|pg||
nt|pef: presumably gone to sleep :)  as well as Barry our vugraph operator and sideline reporter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: One more board after this folks . Thanks for watching . We will have 60 more boards tomorrow starting at 10 local time . That is 13.5 hours from now|pg||
nt|pef: also bbo and usbf for making this possible|pg||
nt|stevo:  Fred doesnt know its a stiff but with that dummy looks bleak if its not|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are (probably) still going to finish on Monday EDT|pg||
nt|pef: turned into an optimist, Henry?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: usbc is the United States Bridge Championships|pg||
nt|henryb:  I said probably, Peter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: reaching for the 3@cs|pg||
nt|pef: and of course thanks for the nearly 1600 spectators all riveted to their seats|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh my...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  pre-empt done its work|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: oops|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|blum1956: interesting double by North... Was it in response? Or did it suggest penalty?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hA|nt|pef: now wooldridges turn, we can all see just play a trump, but why he is he thinking|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|sfoxa:  6nt looks reasonable|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzdu: they didnt say|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|blum1956: I suppose South took it for penalty otherwise he probably should have studied the possible 6@d contract|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|blum1956: which is on the table|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|pef: as specs point out, fred's play is only right if wooldridge had exactly axxxxx of hearts and two diamonds|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess the double just meant 6-7 points|pg||
pc|sK|nt|santyclz: It's close, only 11 easy tricks but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: 7@d was uncalled for|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with @h void, S should expect @h points in partner's hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d6|mc|10|nt|Vugraphzdu: was a claim|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: likely to get a club lead|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: let's see, if they can set this one -theoretically defence can take four diamonds, two spades and a club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as it happens, four rounds of diamonds gives West an awkward discard, but a club is the normal lead|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: and even if declarer can set up the second club, he cannot cash it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now a heart to the queen and a club up|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|zyxzewski: almost :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|zyxzewski: no N must do some guesswork|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: that was well done|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: think the queen is better than the ace - North might put South with @HK  |pg||

pc|cJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|mc|7|nt|zyxzewski: i wonder, does he had a reason to keep it instead of his 4th spade|pg||

nt|pef: yes, that's right|pg||
nt|santyclz: The good news for the 7@d bid was that 7@c was already overboard.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: for sure|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: and indeed it was a push because played from the east side after a transfer auction so no dangerous diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: if pass by wooldridge wasn't forcing, brad would have a real problem what to bid, here he can wait |pg||
pc|c3|nt|stevo:  i think will go xx p p now 2h by brad|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pef: but will east redouble of bid 2d?|pg||
nt|stevo:  ha|pg||
nt|pef: got you |pg||
nt|stevo:  Hurd has seen Joel's pass of XX too many times not going there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred asking about 2@d and also about the original pass . Shown the rdbl card |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: gets a note about the rest|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|pef: yes, I once won a match against a very good team (Chip was on it) because one of his teammates decided to add an extra digit to the score in such a situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: how do we get to 3@cs from here?|pg||
nt|pef: that seems a bit pushy by fred with such bad diamond spots|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|henryb:  Isn't 2N Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|pef: barnet shenkin just told me he thought 5c was cold here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: this si not your typical auction|pg||
nt|stevo:  this is getting dangerous for N/S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pef: although it would take some magic to get there|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|pef: time to lead partner's suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred shaking his head |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: not sure at what|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge nervous 1Nt was a 3rd seat favorable psyche|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Woolridge whispered something|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pef: this is going to be hard for hurd to lead|pg||
nt|pef: although if the j holds he knows fred doesn't have ak10|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pef: so it sort of pinpoints wooldridges holding|pg||
nt|stevo:  declarer will get squeezed on the 5th diamond for down 3 possibly|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pef: hurd is going to think a while |pg||
nt|stevo:  or not :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: thats what he came up with|pg||
nt|pef: I guess he didn't make the same inference I did :)|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c8|nt|pef: now can east possibly know where the queen of spades is?|pg||
nt|pef: he might easily lead a low one|pg||
nt|stevo:  hard not to lead a low one|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: Some might get overboard on 15 and a 5@c suit opposite an opening.|pg||

pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: somehow you expect East to open P-K4 rather than pass |pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S looked too much to me|pg||
