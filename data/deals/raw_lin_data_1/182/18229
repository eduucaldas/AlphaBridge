nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge Hurd play light inititial actions and 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|stevo:  John Hurd's nickname is Jimmy I believe that its because Gavin Wolpert one time said why is your name Johnny you look like a Jimmy and it stuck|pg||
nt|pef: anyone for passing on the north hand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: last 15 boards of the day. 60 more tomorrow|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
mb|2C!|an|5+ and 4+ Majors|mb|2D|nt|stevo:  i think pass is very reasonable but close|pg||

nt|pef: of course a case could be made for passing on "jimmy" hurd's hand, also :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Brad says ty|pg||
nt|stevo:  not their way they play precision opening but standard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: checks their convention card|pg||
nt|pef: me too, certainly would pass if they were vul and us not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: sorry I did not see the X bye E,  so I guess 1 nt is best bid by W |pg||

nt|stevo:  1@S is very preemptive|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the push by the club  bidders put the spade bidders in jeopardy |pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|pef: three nt makes on this hand e/w with spades 44 and the luck in clubs, but will they get there or come close?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|pef: what now on the east hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this can be down one,  if W gets to put the @H thru |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stevo:  2@C is not pretty but really his only bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks to me like 5@c also makes|pg||
nt|stevo:  now 3@H I think|pg||
nt|pef: he punted with 2c, not good enough for 2h reverse of 2nt, anything else is just silly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: hurd thinking|pg||
nt|blum1956: even 5@h is (more or less) safe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: yeah|pg||
nt|gulyas: good morning Mike|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: West should consider an absolute minimum from E|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|blum1956: hi daniel|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|gulyas: I don't know what 2@H was, but he had no reason to go on|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 7 signalled the @H shift |pg||
pc|d6|nt|Vugraphzdu: it was GF|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: 5+@h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cherilou: good auction|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge was worried about his spades hard to blame him|pg||
nt|pef: turns out this makes with the luck in clubs and luck in hearts|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pef: not a lot of losers, but need a lot of work to get to 11 winners|pg||
nt|stevo:  I think if west had the 9 of spades he wuold have bid 3NT as its a blocker|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: stop talking poker Stevo!|pg||
nt|henryb:  he needs at least one spade ruff|pg||
nt|pef: complicated hand.  is there a clear best line?|pg||
nt|stevo:  :) Barry is referring to blocking cards which is very common in pot limit omaha|pg||
nt|henryb:  or lots of diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: hurd staring back and forth between his ahnd and the dummy|pg||
nt|stevo:  looks natural to ruff @D's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: now in thinker pose|pg||
nt|henryb:  which would be more complicated and probably a losing option on this layout|pg||
nt|pef: 3nt might not be as good a contract, but has the advantage of being really easy to play :)|pg||
nt|stevo:  he might win and play a spade first for communication|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blum1956: the 1@d opening was superunderlimit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pef: indeed, they got to 3nt in the closed room|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h5|nt|sybarra: std. old fashioned signaling  |pg||
pc|s3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a claim coming  |pg||
nt|gulyas: well, he had a 10count, and pd is minimum, so whats the point|pg||

pc|sK|nt|zyxzewski: maybe Karpov could have reasoned that NS is lacking club control and lead a club instead of heart|pg||
mc|13|nt|zyxzewski: as it happens fourth round of clubs would promote a trump trick for defense and sets the contract|pg||
pg||

nt|pef: seems like he should have worked that out.  hurd seemed marked for 1453, didn't he?|pg||
nt|stevo:  throughout the trials Fred has played outstanding from what I have seen so a rare lapse|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pef: presumably count in diamonds was known from their carding|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: an easy 4 @S for n/s |pg||
mb|2H|nt|pef: yes fred is such a careful player on defense it is surprising|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|sybarra: not the "contructive" nature of N bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: *constructive|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|stevo:  surprised by the much thought|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: itf stayman with E hand what do you bid over 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: NS can make 3NT here, but its hard to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  will brad lead a Heart?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzff: quickly|pg||
nt|pef: yes )|pg||
nt|cherilou: was it really 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|stevo:  I like his lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: i thought they played 14-16|pg||
nt|stevo:  Wooldridge had to bid 3@H to stop the @H lead |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: obv not at this vul?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: dead silence here|pg||
nt|stevo:  looks like no way to make this|pg||
nt|pef: hard to see any way to make this|pg||
nt|cherilou: I know EW are aggressive but really..........|pg||
nt|pef: or even come very close|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: oh yea it is 16. half asleep here|pg||
nt|stevo:  he might win and play k@D hoping for duck by ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  according to the card 14-16 nv, 15-17 v|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: gitelman meditating|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  that will be expensive, especially after several @s leads|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S really optimistic|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has a nice hand, but too many losers, and knows the fit is only 6-2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: too optimistic id say|pg||
nt|blum1956: pd could have, say, @dA and @hk. Moreover, 4@sx down one may appear better than par|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|stevo:  not exacly happening|pg||
nt|pef: I think hurd decided since if they had a spade fit game might be really good to take the risk of bidding|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he can keep his losers to 4, thats fine|pg||
nt|blum1956: if 3NT making opposite|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|cherilou: and if not go -200?|pg||
nt|pef: probably playing for a doubleton ace of diamonds is his best bet to come close to making|pg||
nt|pef: or doubleton qj|pg||
nt|stevo:  I have to admit i like the K @D they duck it so often|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Greco hampson same auction and I know they play 14-16|pg||
nt|pef: probably not on this hand :)|pg||
nt|stevo:  im getting to use up all my bad luck running good|pg||
nt|pef: it's only the rueful rabbit who could duck with that diamond holding and be right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: that would make an interesting construction problem|pg||
nt|stevo:  to answer questions im getting its not that the k@D is such a great play I just find it to be winning they duck it with aq and aj so often|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: The tempo slows down the later rounds of the event|pg||
nt|pef: so what would you guys do after a strong nt with the east hand?|pg||
nt|stevo:  i would stayman |pg||
nt|pef: 2c wins if partner bids anything but 2h|pg||
nt|cherilou: NS probably play Smith--that should make this easy for Fred to return @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: and if he bids 2H might keep the opps out of 2@h :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am old and pessimistic; I pass|pg||
nt|blum1956: he needs the @dK doubleton for -1|pg||
nt|blum1956: If that King is with South|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|c2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|pef: phlegmatic in your dotage, Henry?|pg||
nt|henryb:  but everyone knows I am a nearly extinct Dinosaur|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: you were pessimistic when you were young Henry|pg||
nt|stevo:  im always thinking game or slam but I do go minus alot|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|henryb:  You didn't know me until I was already old|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: you were old 30 years ago?:)|pg||
nt|stevo:  now he has to guess whether to play k or low @D |pg||
nt|henryb:  about then: one year of marriage to Kitty and I was old|pg||
nt|stevo:  yikes Henry |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge asking about carding but cant hear|pg||
nt|pef: boy, you seemed young at heart when I played with you, Henry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge leans back in his chair and hugs himself|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: now fans open his cards|pg||
nt|henryb:  Young at heart but old in spirit|pg||
nt|stevo:  so is there a right @D play here Henry?|pg||
nt|pef: since they haven't played a spade yet, isn't low 2 to 1 right?  K would require an initial doubleton qj|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Expressing his thought process with his hands|pg||
nt|blum1956: If the declarer plays diamond before the 3rd trump he will not escape|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h8|pc|c5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|stevo:  well qx might have ducked Peter|pg||

nt|kastan88: claimed 9 tricks, and 12 IMPs to Estonia, Smart decision on 2nd trick... running clubs 1st clears situation at once|pg||

mb|1S|nt|sybarra: I see 4 spades went down in the other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  so many pairs play 2@s constuctive but apparantly not this pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|stevo:  they bid 1NT forcing then 2@s with the weak hand|pg||
nt|stevo:  Im surprised Brad didnt bid 2NT 2 places to play|pg||
nt|henryb:  I like bidding 2@s right away: far more preemptive|pg||
nt|stevo:  mabye they dont play that|pg||
nt|pef: well that's interesting, fred has the best hand at the table and everyone else has bid up to the 3 level|pg||
nt|stevo:  now is X penalties or takeout by Fred?|pg||
nt|pef: best in hcp at least|pg||
nt|stevo:  im guessing take out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Does it matter Stevo:)?|pg||
nt|pef: most would play it t/o I think|pg||
nt|stevo:  seems like he has it whatever he plays it as|pg||
nt|pef: 3n might make from the south seat|pg||
nt|stevo:  in my partnership it is takeout|pg||
nt|stevo:  he might bid 3nt to play|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|stevo:  4NT is reasonable also|pg||
nt|blum1956: We have an excellent result for EW in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks like a club system of some sort|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzdu: sadly enough not here though|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|nt|pef: play here should be pretty easy with clubs 22|pg||
nt|stevo:  not so easy|pg||
nt|pef: and this will be 19 boards in a row (I bet) with no swing bigger than 6 imps.  that must be getting close to a record|pg||
nt|stevo:  with 5 2 hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: and 6-1 @ds|pg||
nt|henryb:  Interesting comment. I only see 10 tricks|pg||
nt|cherilou: they opened the N hand in the other room|pg||
nt|pef: yes, my aged eyes miscounted, sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Moss deliberating|pg||
nt|stevo:  opening north is a lot with bad hearts even in precision|pg||
nt|stevo:  looks like he can make it by endplaying Hurd|pg||
nt|stevo:  not easy hand|pg||

mb|1S|nt|pef: it's taken almost an hour for 4 boards|pg||
mb|2H|an|NF|nt|Vugraphzdu: they started too soon its gonna be a few more minutes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  new heroes to follow|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok we will continue with Joe's song and dance routine |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge writing a note to fred|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Fred writing a note to Wooldridge|pg||
nt|stevo:  4@h looks interesting|pg||
nt|santyclz: On a winter's day, in a deep and dark December...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh we're back.|pg||
nt|sybarra:  http://www.bridge.ee/festival/invitational11.htm for on-line results - we should remember - it's pairs, so no imps score|pg||
nt|gulyas: I don't think there were happy sides, but at least one team gained...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|stevo:  trump lead looks best|pg||
nt|stevo:  hard to not lead your stiff though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I think when you take 10 min to play a card you should at least make the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: or was it one either way?|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: twoway|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  many pairs would play Souths double as showing 3 hearts doesnt look like they play that or mabye he called it 3?|pg||
nt|pef: I'll be very impressed if he leads a trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: being told that when you take THAT long its prob too late :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: i think Brad thinks its 3 cause he pointed at it when the tray came over|pg||
nt|blum1956: one either I mean|pg||
nt|gulyas: I see|pg||
pc|s8|nt|stevo:  i use to not lead my singletons but after being wrong 100 times in a row and under threat of death by bobby i now must|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Bobby knows best.... Just ask him :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cherilou: but @D still beats it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Bobby is Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|stevo:  does it?|pg||
nt|pef: no it doesn't|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I dont think so|pg||
nt|pef: they get a ruff but you still have 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stevo:  he will win and play club|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes only 1 ruff-sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: 3@h was alerted|pg||
nt|gulyas: so no gain, just pain...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: what we are saying is that the imp score on our table is just a way to keep score, NOT the real score |pg||
nt|sybarra: the 4/1 spade break makes this a bit treacherous|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|pef: that's ok I was tired about being the only person making a mistake|pg||
nt|ferlema: more photos from the last set in Las Vegas: confsudbridge.org|pg||
nt|santyclz: No pretty lead for east.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
mc|9|nt|cherilou: yep I joined you|pg||
nt|stevo:  if he wins king and plays trump intersting|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: 'm not a big fan of this 2@D overcall either|pg||
mb|r|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|zyxzewski: only 5 card suit and without much quality|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: but on the other hand - it is somewhat safer to come in on  second level than to balance on 3rd|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: but i still would prefer to pass|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|zyxzewski: but as it is - although the contract goes down, they may easily gain a couple of IMPs here|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cJ|mc|8|pg||
qx|c6|st||md|4SQJ95HJ6DQJ7CQ732,SA432HAQ842DA64C9,SK7H97DK9853CAK84,ST86HKT53DT2CJT65|sv|e|nt|pef: phew|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Director says this will start costing @d imps|pg||
nt|pef: well at any rate, bathurst now up to a healthy 48 imp lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: sorry, yes was just making|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|pef: are diamond imps like platinum points?|pg||
mb|p|nt|stevo:  first shaky result from the closed room for Bathurst team this set|pg||
nt|pef: probably diamond will gain back a few on this board, as I said earlier playing the 3-3 fit not right tonight|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: 1@c was alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: not the best defense by NS in the open room |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|sybarra: looks like a club system of some sort |pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like relay precision.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: 2@d also|pg||
nt|sybarra: "could have 0 clubs" |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|gulyas: good reopen by S|pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like an easy make|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pef: 1nt is probably down a couple at least|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fred takes less time than he normally would in this spot|pg||
nt|stevo:  nice lead by Brad here|pg||
nt|pef: although I guess he can hold it to down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I am serious folks stop laffing!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: exploring what E shape is  |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 2@H would have made probably too|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|sfoxa:  another day such a contract will have chance|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|sybarra: really just needed one of the red K's on side |pg||
pc|cA|nt|pef: which would be 10 imps back to diamond|pg||
nt|santyclz: A slightly sub-par slam.|pg||
nt|sybarra: sub-par,  it doesnt make|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 9 anyway|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pef: well barry tried to make the best play for wooldridge|pg||
nt|pef: true, Henry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I cant see the computer with my glasses and I cant see the cards without them|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|pef: I'm the opposite way :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|stevo:  very effective defence by N/S here|pg||
nt|pef: when did you turn British, Steve?|pg||
nt|stevo:  i just cant spell|pg||
pc|d4|nt|stevo:  or do math for that matter!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|gulyas: claim time|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|santyclz: It can if e pitches dummy's @d on the @s and takes a ruffing finesse.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe it was just the k of @D needed on side?|pg||
nt|sybarra: well S seemed anxious to get declarer back in dummy, so maybe suspicious?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|santyclz: @ds 3-3 allows it to make.  |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|pef: better pitch the queen of spades here|pg||
nt|pef: pitching any diamond leads to down 2|pg||
nt|stevo:  nice hand to win 9 IMPS on with what looks like bidding misunderstanding in other room|pg||
nt|pef: but he should get it right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge ask for a second.. Seemed like a good spot for a line but i cant do it :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Larry Cohen, Richard Katz and I used to play?|pg||
nt|pef: he knows south has nothing but diamonds left|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brad is getting ansy. Makes a comment . uncalled for i think. State of the match disgust|pg||
nt|pef: unless both moss overcalled on 4 and fred is playing a very deep game not playing a second spade earlier|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Wooldridge asks what 1nt WOULD BE BY FRED  told Nat|pg||
nt|pef: of course when the play is so slow, it's really easy to get into a brain freeze|pg||
nt|henryb:  either 9 or 11|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: wasnt anything nasty just frustration|pg||
nt|stevo:  Joel doesnt know where the ace of @D is here which is his problem|pg||
nt|pef: why is that a problem?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pef: he knows south has nothing but diamonds to lead so doesn't matter who has the ace|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|s3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @c start could have been better for defence, but all in all - declarer predictes contract destiny|pg||
mc|9|nt|Vugraphzdu: Ty all for watching, this is all for today|pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: tomorrow morning we will start again |pg||
nt|Vugraphzdu: with 3 more rounds of Towns Cup|pg||
