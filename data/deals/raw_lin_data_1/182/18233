nt|henryb:  the flat hand argues for pass|pg||
nt|thurston:  not sure i would have passed 1 @S with N|pg||
nt|janm: The DBL of 3@s just shows extra values and short spades, so N can certainly use judgment about passing or bidding - as Henry says, the spades lean him towards passing, but 3 hearts ...|pg||
