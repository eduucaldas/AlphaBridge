mb|d|nt|santyclz: 4@h is unexpected.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well its a good contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzhe: 2nd/4th switches from NS|pg||
nt|santyclz: I agree.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: fight on the 4-5 level - but only fight for 50'es - 4@S -1 or 5@d -1|pg||

nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would be tempted to preempt in @D HERE|pg||

mb|1C|nt|oosb: ah, 3@H|pg||
nt|kastan88: If players mnames right, then teams must be: Bailey vs Hauge (group E)|pg||

nt|roswolf: with a weak 2 if i had it in my armoury|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzhe: they can't open weak on 2lvl in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: but now is hard to change|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: effective biidding by north|pg||
mb|5H|nt|paulg:  that's an interesting constraint, I only know of Fantoni-Nunes who also do that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dutch experts believe that two of the pairs are virtually selected, Drijver-Brink and Muller-de Wijs, and that the third pair will be selected among v Prooijen-Verhees, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jansma-Paulissen and Bertens-Westra. But nothing will be official until early July|pg||

nt|kastan88: I have not got to play against Erik "Silla" this year, but year ago had some chances to direct at table, if he called TD, that's why i am saying "good friend"|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ummm, are you sure of that score, operator?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: 41S looks easy to reach but not so easy in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|jpmbs: I think Drijver-Brink are favorites, other 2 pairs will be exciting|pg||
nt|eamongall: what happens after round robin .. is it two swisses with 27 and 5 qualifying |pg||
nt|pelu: NS missed the game in OR - very passiv bidding by S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kastan88: and at once slam time|pg||

nt|roswolf: why didnt south bid spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: 13 tricks from top in NT, @H and @C for NS, but can they find that?|pg||

nt|roswolf: well an easy game swing fpr hansen|pg||

pc|hA|nt|kastan88: Hi Eamon, godness, you help me wuth that Irish bidding may be|pg||
nt|eamongall: yes|pg||
nt|kastan88: just 13 tricks from top, somehow they didn't find grand|pg||

nt|jcomyn: we aree the lucky ones and we aint finished yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: EW were already at an uncomfortable level - and the old saying that the 5 level belongs to the opps is still valid from time to time|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|pelu: in this board N in OR was "the chiken"|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  no, even if you guessed the spades the defence has time to remove dummy's entry|pg||
nt|jpmbs: he will just try the finesses|pg||
nt|oosb: well the 1@D bid does suggest where the Kings are|pg||
nt|paulg:  not many entries to the East hand|pg||
nt|oosb: Strip A@D in any case|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|mcsd: N lead woul not be my choice.|pg||

nt|pelu: and all pass :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: ok you win this time:)|pg||

nt|eamongall: 5@Ds is in play in open room ..they won't be long |pg||

nt|eamongall: part score battle here I think |pg||
nt|petergill: Very dangerous when the doubler North was likely to have @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrrunda4.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: so 5@Sx -1 was good sac against 5@D or 5@H in previous|pg||
nt|jbgood: but she had 12 tricks - or do I need new glasses?|pg||
nt|petergill: Claim was probably 490 not 460 then, as there were 12 tricks |pg||
nt|eamongall: suspect it was a misunderstanding ... redouble often shows 1st round @S control |pg||
nt|jbgood: we all prefer 5@d Peter, even Up Above|pg||
nt|kastan88: if you lokk on AJxxx and partner doubling 3@S!, what you think about half stopper in W (redouble?) and then half in E (3nt), I would lead A still|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and another partial|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another trappy hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|eamongall: think so jaak|pg||
nt|kastan88: *look|pg||
nt|eamongall: probably happy to gather in 11 ..|pg||
nt|petergill: Qxx on right and K109x(x) in partner's hand, I expect|pg||
nt|kastan88: and redouble with void, not going to 5d?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: could go higher than 4h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5d a great contract agst 4h|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: playing 3@S in open room|pg||
nt|roswolf: or will they pass out in 2nt?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|jcomyn: hate that 2s with rubbish vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  short diamonds with 4 or 5 clubs|pg||
nt|eamongall: they play quicker then I can type |pg||
nt|petergill: but a good point by Jaak - perhaps the winning lead was possible, though I would have led a low spade|pg||
nt|jbgood: this sequence is from outer space|pg||
nt|eamongall: 3@Cs ghesthem |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with those blessed minors and modern players|pg||
nt|roswolf: strong club may help them keep low|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcsd: will a @h lead be found ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: it did|pg||
nt|pelu: this bidding is the same as 2@C - 2@D - 2NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: course not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no problems now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eamongall: but its not meant to be those suits |pg||
nt|eamongall: so maybe both minors |pg||
nt|eamongall: Baileys cuebids |pg||
pc|d7|nt|paulg:  North loves the @d9 return, makes it very easy for him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Jansma probably thinking he needs the spade finesse to work|pg||
nt|jbgood: another time relevant to play the singleton in opps second suit... but not too late|pg||
nt|petergill: "Aussie" not "Bailey" - Aussies bid like maniacs at fav vul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a 7-3 fit. If they have that in a major they go mad|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 8-3 even|pg||
nt|pelu: only 7 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  also wondering where the small diamonds are|pg||
nt|oosb: OR @D 4-4 an @H 3-3 |pg||
nt|kastan88: and something happened there too, after 3 times trumps looked as -2 (previous), must be good result for NS, if teammates not going for 6 in red suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eamongall: clubs here deem 4@S a make |pg||
nt|eamongall: club spots |pg||
nt|petergill: Some Aussies, or should that be Norwegians, have even maniacally tried 3NT on bare king stoppers|pg||
nt|eamongall: some maniacs play well |pg||
nt|jbgood: still - with your stack having so much honors in the short suit - 3@c nothing for me:)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|oosb: must decide|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: I think 4@s would have made, as @HQ lead is very unlikely. If so, the save cut the loss to 4 imps on this board|pg||
nt|kastan88: you still forgetting about favor vulnerability, Jon, and for ever young Gavin and Kirsten|pg||
nt|jbgood: will Erik find the @d King, @c king and a heart?|pg||
nt|jbgood: not sure that is so easy...|pg||
nt|eamongall: I reckon he will play @DK ok |pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcsd: i would pplay 6 instead of TQs |pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: Gavin and Kirsten were in the Australian Seniors Team which won the Asia Pacific Teams Championship last year - it's hard to believe they're old enough to play Seniors bridge, in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: my opinion |pg||
pc|s5|pg||

pc|hK|nt|oosb: @h or @S|pg||

nt|petergill: Gavin and Kirsten were the first Tasmanians to play for Australia, I think. The 2nd was Hugh Grosvenor, right now in Kuala Lumpur. |pg||
nt|kastan88: Erik's nick "silla" in estonian means bridge, so he will find bridge over the trouble water|pg||
nt|petergill: Was @C2 suit pref?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|pelu: Geoffrey: u told me 3 NT in Board 18 - u were at wrong table - 3Nt X in OR :):)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oosb: and must decide right now :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  but hearts 3-3 only gives him 1@d, 1@s, 4@h and 2@c ... still needs a trick|pg||
nt|oosb: @s seems higher %age|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oosb: no he has the rest if  @H 3-3|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@c no 2|pg||
nt|jbgood: Helgemo at the other table didnt even bother to bid anything - is he too old Peter?|pg||
nt|petergill: Or was it low encourage?|pg||
nt|petergill: Great defence ---> 500 and 8 imps|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||

pc|d6|nt|paulg:  he will make three clubs on a squeeze, but he did not know that it was working|pg||
nt|petergill: Erik S.. did win the Bermuda Bowl in 2007 and his play here shows why. |pg||
pc|d8|nt|oosb: South squeezed if he has 4@H and K@S|pg||

pc|sA|pc|h8|nt|kastan88: what case?|pg||
nt|eamongall: somebody was reading heavily last night |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|paulg:  his line has maintained chances of 3-3 breaks in both hearts and clubs, but squeeze chances when clubs do not break ..all against a spade finesse when hearts do not break|pg||
nt|oosb: could still play 9@H|pg||
nt|oosb: Very tough hand|pg||
nt|oosb: will make the bulletin if he makes though|pg||
nt|oosb: very nice ending|pg||
nt|paulg:  very little to guide him |pg||

nt|petergill: Kirsten decided to get the lead-directing bid in first|pg||
