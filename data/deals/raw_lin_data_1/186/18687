nt|roswolf: a trap hand for n/s|pg||

nt|mamos: are we off now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully "on" |pg||
nt|mamos: lol  this is Group K  third and second|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like a multi auction |pg||
nt|mamos: South prefers 2@s to 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: mandatory 2 @H,  and here we go on interesting scramble |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting it was a 7 card multi |pg||
nt|mamos: NS have the same number of trumps in 2@S as in 2@h :)|pg||

mb|3C|nt|vugraphzgy: the current leader is Dror Padon - the winner of last year's competition|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW are playing precision |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: must  be heading for 6c|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ntmon: NS trying to steal the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: This is the last of 3 parts of this competition - following the pairs and teams that were played earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: In each event everyplayer gets up to 100 points - according to the posision|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good stop|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|granguru:  They use Polish leads that means low from a doubleton|pg||
nt|dburn: that's a relief - for a while I thought they were just arguing with each other|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  and udca|pg||

mb|4S|nt|psyck: 5@h can be defeated|pg||
nt|ballebodk: i know its a tough bid but 4 cl could maybe have helped the defense so they could defeat 5 h in E|pg||

nt|vugraphpl1: problem with hand's|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3nt this time|pg||
nt|dburn: tough hand for East-West if North-Sout bid a lot of spades|pg||

nt|yuval10: first prize is 3000 Euro's|pg||

nt|ntmon: not bad|pg||
nt|psridhar: any Tax?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|dburn: but I guess they will not bid a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well not for long|pg||
nt|granguru:  no 5 contract with best defense|pg||
nt|dburn: and they judged pretty well to play in clubs, not hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: wb|pg||
nt|granguru:  that is @H lead !(hard)|pg||
nt|granguru:  no ..declarer discards on @D|pg||
nt|dburn: not good enough - West can throw his spade loser on a diamond if North leads a heart|pg||
nt|granguru:  yup|pg||
nt|granguru:  so iron contract|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: wrong again|pg||
nt|granguru:  N had the idea...|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|mamos: a game on pretty thin values here|pg||

nt|ballebodk: now s "know" that the opps have at least 9 h, so its maybe not right to play NT|pg||
nt|psyck: this may well go down with 1@s, 1@h, 2@d, 1@c losers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|psyck: so likely going down here instead of making overtricks in 1NT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: even if S was concerned about @h, it is only a 1 level contract & he can afford to lose a few, 2@c distorts shape & values|pg||

nt|stc: I like Indy, less science and more judgement :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3nt - or dare i say it|pg||
nt|mamos: How many of the 90 tables do you think will bid that Shirley?:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so far less brutal than last set,    |pg||
nt|mamos: game might not make this time|pg||
nt|granguru:  N thought probably on a minor 2-suited hand in dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - he would not expect his partner to have a singleton heart|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: might be difficult to stay our of game here |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: *stay out|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ntmon: but you need to know the system anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: this looks like a stright-forward 4@h which probably makes 5|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. has to cash 3 first tricks out, if they succceed i predict they'll get a big reward and a close to top result|pg||
nt|psridhar: versatile game this Bridge-engages varied interests , since the game has many facets-science, judgment, analysis , psychology, etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: are we under way with a grand slam|pg||
nt|garnetts: This looks like a bidding challenge hand 7NT a spread and nearly impossible to bid |pg||
nt|mamos: and for sure they'll bid it if they did the last one|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: maybe but 7c should be bid|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: that auction won't be duplicated at many tables|pg||
nt|dburn: straight out of Acol Road, West Hampstead, London, England|pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: some people will bid it vai 2NT-3NT |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5c better of course|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Victor Silverstone|pg||
nt|odysseus69: morning all|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yuval10: of course, small @c lead from N means 12 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: yes, not easy for N to play @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: this is IMPs right? OTs have less importance ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: no|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@d on 2N was transfer accordimng to cc|pg||
nt|yuval10: MP's i'm affraid|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe E forgot, so this sequence should be slam interest|pg||
nt|ntmon: MP for sure|pg||
nt|psridhar: but our scoreboard above says IMPs....|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, but it is MP|pg||
nt|stc: I don't think it may be Individual at IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/indi.php  look|pg||
nt|psyck: bbo cannot show scores with 1 mp table shown|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|psridhar: so Matchpoints it is ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: noiw maybe 7h|pg||
nt|sybarra: may have staved off the @S lead |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|garnetts: 4@D by the passed hand would have got them there |pg||
nt|sybarra: but is that enough?|pg||
nt|mamos: well the defence will probaly have this and one more chance to get the defence right|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: now after W denied @s control|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good night|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: to 3nt i mean|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now to me that is an awful bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good hand for strong club- should have avoided 3NT but North rushed in|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes they in forcing situastion so why not 2nt|pg||
nt|mamos: needs Club return and Spade immediately  I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is obviuos|pg||
nt|sybarra: *obvious |pg||
nt|mamos: East can see the danger in the dummy|pg||
nt|mamos: I think Club is clear|pg||
nt|mamos: she knows she needs Spade from partner|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yuval10: perhaps it's easier for N to find the winning lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: a lot of MP's are in stake now|pg||
nt|psyck: the def will get it right, very costly for E to forget the cc|pg||
nt|jcomyn: playing precision whats the rush|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@H is virtually a nonsense bid unless he is gambling that they will lead the wrong thing |pg||
pc|d6|nt|yuval10: very well done by N|pg||
nt|psyck: 2 pages should not be hard to remember :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: why not 3s and then 4d by s|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psridhar: i agree that this sequence by E is slammish in many conventions -but very few define it, in other words what is opener required to do ?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|granguru:  :)|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, Reese or Marx or Simon might have ducked that diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: then, East could eventually have been endplayed in the majors|pg||
nt|granguru:  @D9 asks for @H|pg||
nt|dburn: as it is, East can win a heart and exit with a diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: and declarer will eventually lose a spade|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck: with fit and max hand, i suppose opener is to make a forward going bid or rkc|pg||
nt|granguru:  it was worthwhile for duckworth to duck|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: needs to decide to play for singleton club king with West or jack with East- he decided quicker than i could type|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont beat italians horsing around|pg||
nt|mamos: I only have a slight advantage over East of course |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c6|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: but not any more|pg||
mc|9|nt|psridhar: if responder is looking for fit, he has a balanced hand realtively? else he can trf and bid a 2nd suit-say 2-7-2-2 type ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: will KX,K109XXXX,XX,QX do?|pg||
nt|stc: Many players accept the transfer only with fit - it is a big advantage for such hands|pg||
nt|psridhar: i suggest you play it as = i dont need any fit ; i need a control rich hand -either pure all aces and kings in 20hcp OR some source of tricks like KQJXX in side suit with opener ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: with controls outside|pg||
nt|stc: the price is that you risk be too high |pg||
nt|psyck: that is an interesting & sensible treatment PS.  |pg||
nt|stc: do we have standings after first session ?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/indi.php|pg||
nt|psridhar: the logic is -thats the only value the responder cannot find out easily since 2N opg is space consuming|pg||

mb|2H|mb|4D|an| |mb|p|nt|psyck: that was another good reason not to lead doubletons, pd may misplace your holding|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@d=@s & @d, generally 8.5 trick hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psyck: (Leaping Michaels)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ballebodk: 4D = 5s and 5d and a decent hand - a good convention when it can bee used|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: lil timid by S|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|ballebodk: but on this hand i think that s would have liked to see a X insted ;0)|pg||

nt|yuval10: Covalu still leading, with Padon 2nd, in the overall standings|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: :) - just haven't seated yet...|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/total.php|pg||
nt|Walddk3: We would approve of 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk3: even from Alon|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what happened there|pg||
nt|odysseus69: presumably 3C from North would be forcing- then 3H from South and 3NT avoided|pg||
nt|granguru:  in the meanwhile ...defense gives a trick away|pg||
nt|dburn: and there really wasn't any rush to play that heart - where were any heart losers going?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: surely 3nt is one down|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: Diamond 7 at the other table 2 here  if that makes a difference  defender found Club switch for deserved swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: anyone likme to let us know who's playing and who sitting ew|pg||
mb|2H|nt|odysseus69: East will hope to come in later with minors- may be a bit high when it gets back to him|pg||
nt|mamos: i presume thats a 15-17 NT  but still has a lot of tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not everyone's choice of 1 nt,  but this will work |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|garnetts: bad 6@C contract possible --will boil down to getting the trumps right --and guessing the spades |pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know what happened on bd 13|pg||
nt|granguru:  looks like 3NT by South is the best spot here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: I dont like 1nt on the s handf with very poor spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: Little choice I imagine systemically |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this is a bit daft when you dpont know who isd playing against whom|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: you can always bid 1D and catch up later|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: hard to reach 3NT after 4@d - not a good advertisement for the method|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|jcomyn: all yopu really want to do is play 3nt from N|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no but on 12 where declarer misplayed 2H and went down they made 9 tricks next door|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|stc: the interesting point here will be the handling of zje trump suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: accurate bidding by Schwartz -his seq shows about what he has here|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He will lose a trick in hearts I predict|pg||
nt|yuval10: then maybe a ruff too|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe but an easier thing to do is reverse 1@S and 1NT |pg||
pc|d3|nt|stc: the %play is to finesse the 2nd round of @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he leads @d, and he does|pg||
nt|psyck: on @d lead, dec may ignore restricted choice|pg||
nt|stc: he better does :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: we can see an easy 7 tricks |pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT could so easily be on |pg||
nt|sybarra: and where 7 often 8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: This was first used by the Cambridge Uni playes about 35 years ago when the modified C C Wei's precision |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h6|pc|d9|nt|garnetts: well they got to it --now it will come down to guesswork |pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will take some guessing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: its the hand with 4D and CK off 3nt|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|stc: safety plays at MP are not a must|pg||
pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: never cover an honour with an honour - i think thats the rule|pg||
nt|dburn: if instead North had doubled West's weak 2@h for takeout, the penalty might set some kind of record for this event|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: at IMPs he doesnt mind losing a trump trick to W , so when E drops honor he can play 2nd top card...but this is MPs..|pg||

nt|garnetts:  --rotten contract |pg||
nt|jcomyn: three mighty big hands in a row|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought declarer had seven tricks and then claimed nine|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|garnetts: another making slam--this is also poor though|pg||
nt|mamos: still Shirley was right 1NT worked well|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: but just the 3nt this time|pg||
nt|dburn: the objective for the teams here is to finish in the top three of their group of six|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: needs 3-3 hearts in practice |pg||
mb|2D|nt|psridhar: if his target was only 10 he might hv drawn trumps |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this could lead to trouible|pg||
nt|dburn: Penfold is currently leading, Duck N Dales are fourth|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|jcomyn: but if they are playing precision why 1h|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure where I want to play this hand looking at all 4 |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: at least low enough|pg||
nt|mamos: In England a double on the South hand would be regarded as a poor bid   -- different countries have different styles and understandings|pg||
nt|dburn: this is Callaghan's patent method for responding to 1NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|odysseus69: Souths double after a strong club opening looks ill judged|pg||
nt|jcomyn: NT is ok but that X by s is not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|sybarra: countries, systems, partnerships, style etc |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: looks like 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|psridhar: a good lesson on moysian fits -good trumps|pg||
nt|stc: better than 3NT+2|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a very good score in an MP field|pg||
nt|psridhar: short trump hand haviing ruffing potential|pg||
nt|stc: and who plays 6@c  ?|pg||
nt|psyck: true, S did well to bid 4@s instead of 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: they're learnikng|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hooray - italians|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: dont like 4-2 fits when i have a 5-4 fit, but then that suits doesnt exist any more|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks a strange lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: likely playing two systems according to position or vulnerability |pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: odd though|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: a wish trick |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|sybarra: 2345 |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c forces 2@d, to be followed by various things|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: poor S,  nothing sits right|pg||
nt|dburn: usually by our side rather than the opponents, of course|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk3: Goodbye to the 12th trick|pg||
nt|psyck: oh well, thought ruffing @h would have been normal|pg||
nt|stc: don't understand his play|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He can no longer ruff a heart and get back to hand to draw|pg||
nt|stc: after droping the Q@c he sees 11 NT tricks, so he needs 12 in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: may be plannig to play for @s33 then|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe he will play for spades 3-3 now|pg||
nt|Walddk3: diamond to ace, ruff a heart and overtake @SQ|pg||
nt|yuval10: he should, as he knows he's in a bad score already|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He really should with this format|pg||
nt|stc: making things much worse|pg||
nt|stc: 1 trick worse :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: The current standing after 10 (out of 19) rounds:  1st: Dror Padon,  2nd: Sergiu Covaliu|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He erred at trick 3 by not ruffing a heart|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk3: Playing for clubs 3-1 instead with singleton in West|pg||
nt|stc: hoping W plays H|pg||
nt|Walddk3: If they don't one, they don't have one|pg||
nt|Walddk3: says Garozzo|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this time covering was a better idea|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|Walddk3: don't lead one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bedt italians in grand in open room on bd 1|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps lucky South  |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psridhar: if @c are 3-1 he can see 3N fares poorly so taking even 10 triks is ok -so shd hv catered to 2-2|pg||
nt|stc: 10 or 11 ?|pg||
nt|stc: 620 not far from zero|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: will likely go for 10 on suggested line|pg||

mb|1D|nt|mamos: EW got in a mess on that last board in th OR 3@S -3|pg||
nt|dburn: East-West have the generally accepted values for game, but the play is uphill work|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: board 13 scored as 3NT making here - did look like 1 down|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW will probably play a number of @H here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|garnetts: looks like a transfer overcall |pg||
nt|jcomyn: assume that transfer|pg||
nt|mamos: now that is a little surprising   that North has not protected|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: tought hand to protect with,  you bid 3 @C?|pg||
nt|mamos: NS certainly have a Club partial|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wont X there without 4 @S |pg||
nt|mamos: don't you mix @C2  with the Spades?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmm |pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@H should be -2|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: mind you, this bidding might get North-South a little high|pg||
nt|granguru:  declarer must guess @H for losing just one trick in the suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|psridhar: Birman worth 3@C now|pg||
nt|yuval10: kind of surprised there was no X from South over 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: will certainly go on at this vul|pg||
nt|odysseus69: bad decisions all round|pg||
nt|dburn: still, South knows not to trust North's overcalls very far|pg||
nt|dburn: but it may be hard for her not to bid 4@s as a save if the opponents bid 4@h confidently|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: unless i curse him|pg||
nt|stc: needs Axx to X 1@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: AXX @h ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: passing 2@s with that 2 suitor -he will know it will go all pass as pd is marked with 4card @s|pg||
nt|stc: support X for @H|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@D lokks like a FIT NO-JUMP support|pg||
nt|granguru:  looks*|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yuval10: there is no support X here|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he wants to support he does that with 2 @h or a cuebid|pg||
nt|psyck: x just shows honor i suppose|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not 3d by s|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@d is just a cue bid - East bid diamonds|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: since partner showed 5 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: Nunes probably judged that oppo would "save"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: in this üposition and vuln you may have only 4|pg||
nt|psridhar: NS can make 10 tricks in @c|pg||
nt|psyck: S had enuf with 2 Aces to x|pg||
nt|granguru:  in  fact|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h would also be a cue bid, but South has better diamonds than hearts|pg||
pc|sA|nt|granguru:  -2 |pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: I agree it is slightly awkward but I don't think you vcan affored to pass game might be cold|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||

nt|Walddk1: For specs. David Burn and Brian Callaghan were regular partners for a number of years|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|stc: anyway NS very passive and expecting a bad score here|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure cold if pard didnt step in |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: well, I don't have to watch him make overcalls like that any more|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|psyck: not usual to see both N & S lie low at this vul|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|garnetts: likely a WJO and south gave it up I suppose |pg||
nt|granguru:  :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|mamos: what will partner do over 2@h with a balanced 13 count with a couple of Heart stops ?|pg||
nt|mamos: as it is North will collect 3 imps because 2@h only went one off played by West after a Multi sequenc|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think you should bid what you have in your cards|pg||

nt|yuval10: and not assume that partner "tricks" you|pg||
nt|yuval10: if you think your partner "tricks" you all the time...well, you're lucky , because it's an individual event and he'll be gone by next round :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 2@s Birman knew his pd held 4-2 in Majors, how costly can 3@c be?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3 great scored for EW here anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: W will surely overtake N|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|stc: ok, ty|pg||
nt|stc: S can't pass here|pg||
nt|psyck: about a loser in each suit in 2@s|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s non forcing maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: but S has good hand for @s|pg||
nt|stc: even if not forcing, he has too much|pg||
nt|odysseus69: silence from West and double later|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, he did that once on a similar hand and it made five overtricks|pg||
nt|dburn: because partner had 23-24 balanced|pg||
nt|granguru:  and passed?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mamos: hard to get excited with four balanced hands and a part-score board :)|pg||

mb|4H|nt|psridhar: simple rule for me-if i wd hv originally super-accepted a trf , then I raise to 3@S here|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: :)|pg||

nt|granguru:  playing with probabilities|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: West naively failed to double - looks like Balint may not be a star|pg||

pc|s8|nt|garnetts: Far be it for me to criticise but that double is dreadful --obviously an action double--but they could play 3@S doubled with 6@D a spread |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mamos: well I think passing 3@h shows you should have passed 2@c   - it's a real double-cross to bid on and then stop|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h4|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dburn: East can be squeezed in hearts and clubs for an overtrick|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h6|nt|psridhar: defense did well cashing their 3 @d tricks-there was some danger of one @d gettiing pitched from dummy|pg||
nt|stc: a @c lead could have been more efective|pg||
pc|h5|nt|garnetts: As it is a slam needs a 3-2 heart break only |pg||

mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: more action|pg||
nt|dburn: another boring flat ten count, thinks South|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: only @d ruff beats 6@h|pg||
nt|dburn: little knowing that...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|granguru:  4@H but not 4@s|pg||
nt|dburn: true - how will 5@d get on?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|garnetts: I  ssume 1@H is a transfer too |pg||
nt|granguru:  Paradoxically 6@S can be made with @DA lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  an interesting hand indeed|pg||
mb|5D|mb|6D|nt|psyck:  6@c only -3 :)|pg||
nt|mamos: as usual  a stretched NT|pg||
nt|granguru:  that will define the match winner|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks to be par, in fact|pg||
nt|granguru:  6@D makes with a non @S lead|pg||
nt|dburn: since 6@d is down one doubled, and 5@h would have made|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: I wonder what their range is |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: bit of a skite this|pg||
nt|odysseus69: just been informed that I am commentating on mixed teams- was drafted in with no info|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Running scores at  http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrrunda2.html|pg||
nt|mamos: 15-17 I'd imagine   Standard French|pg||
nt|mamos: nine tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: the KCB response of 6@C by E shows odd no of keys and a useful void-needed for slam here|pg||
nt|psridhar: else Lazar thinks 2 keys are missing|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, many play 5N as even with void & 6x as odd with void|pg||
nt|granguru:  the importance of showing valuable voids in RKCB is ofoveerwhelming importance|pg||
nt|psridhar: now E has to 'punt' 6@H|pg||
nt|stc: I don't see any reason not to lead @d against 6@h|pg||
nt|psridhar: kind of bid that will invite more criticism when it fails than accolade when it wins( oh u got lucky! )|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  if W would have shown a 2 suited with 2N then W probably would have played 6@D instead of 6@H by E|pg||
nt|psyck: I E was going to bid on 5@h, he may have tried 6@d |pg||
nt|psyck: *If E|pg||
nt|psridhar: the two suits lack parity acutely ..so perhaps E decided to hide it|pg||
nt|granguru:  MP bidding strategy makes these little bidding distortions|pg||
pc|hK|nt|garnetts: Good guess by South --might have had no play and might well go off still if east ducks the heart |pg||
nt|granguru:  guessing @D of course|pg||
nt|dburn: so a lot of IMPs rest on Brian's lead to this trick|pg||
nt|dburn: and that one won't work|pg||
nt|granguru:  ADRENALINE FLOWING NOW|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: killing lead - triumph for 2H opener|pg||
nt|dburn: Ivanov will know that North has a void in diamonds, surely|pg||
nt|granguru:  BEST LINE?|pg||
nt|granguru:  bidding is clear in that sense|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|stc: wow !|pg||
nt|granguru:  defense must manage not to clash @s tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: he won't have a losing diamond and two losing clubs for 5@d, and with 1-1 in the minors he would bid Blackwood, not 5@d|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: Lazar might hv tried a forcing pass here ...in the context of his 5@H it only says he doesnt have @c values ( but hand still belongs to EW)|pg||
nt|garnetts: technicall as a kib has said only a club kills it --but this lead makes it hard |pg||

nt|mamos: isnt the q107 a trick Shirley?|pg||
