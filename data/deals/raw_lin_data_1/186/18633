nt|petergill: I tried to download it from the website (under Participants) earlier but it seemed to make my computer crash|pg||
nt|rodal f: B9 OR 3NT as here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: Rodal?|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 will become a new swing. OR 4@SE and CR 3NTW+2|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: NS Talk about last board|pg||
nt|tejjyid: "well done"|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|andyv:  so far no slam hands and this one headed for the 4 level in @hs and 5 level in @cs|pg||
nt|andyv:  strong xfer preempts?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: i wish i could hear them:)|pg||
nt|twcho: should S introduce his 2nd suit after 3S or the double?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: 1@d Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT might be a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: A part score to come again|pg||
nt|jjsb: 2@c opening is precision style of course |pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 also 4@S as here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I usually don't have a 4 loser hand when I preempt but maybe I should try it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will not go gently|pg||
nt|jcwla: Might end in 4@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  since E didn't bid game, S must assume that N has some values|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: 3@H som S? Pre emt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Came|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rodal f: 2@D ask|pg||
nt|twcho: if so, they may be able to push the opponent to one level higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: and collect more money|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: S are missing @DJ for have fynny cards here as well, but @DA10 can be droped|pg||
nt|offthebend: 10 card H fit but you can ONLY make 1H |pg||
nt|rodal f: Payout for some|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5@C+ and 4@S|pg||
mb|4D|nt|petergill: To save or not to save?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Max was 3@C|pg||
nt|offthebend: it was hard to get to 3NT by EW on this bidding |pg||
nt|kerasidis: could ...but N could not imagine it is 6 card|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B24 also 3NT but S to lead a @S and 12 tricks for a push|pg||
nt|jjsb: and we will probably play 3nt no @h fit and around 25hp thougth here its not the best contract |pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: 2@H transfer|pg||
nt|twcho: so I add a "may". :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|petergill: 4@S makes as long as declarer does not lose trump control|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rodal f: No relay so color. 2NT=relay|pg||
nt|jjsb: let see if they can find a better minors game |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: the undertricks are only 50's, so no big loss compared to 2@S making|pg||
nt|petergill: Good dbl by N, avoids the trap of bidding 5 over 5 with too few trumps (even though 5@S might make on perfect play)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 China made 1IMP|pg||
nt|jjsb: nice lead |pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  so, NS play non-leaping michaels as one noted commentator speculated|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  sorry, they don't play it (didn't see the dbl)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: 2@C=5@C+4M this time and a vul game lost|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Or a auto after the bidding?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: I think N can be endplayed for 300 instead of 500|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C or @D to play?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3-3 in @C than that is correct. Drop the A@D than that is correct. We see it but declerer|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Look like play for Ax@D|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|rodal f: B25 3NT as here. Normaly +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Best now a @D and small|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@d would have been effective also in shutting out the @c suit|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c9|nt|petergill: Even underleading the spade at Trick 2 to @SQ would not have stopped the endplay for 300|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: -1 and not -2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|c2|nt|twcho: the lead has given declarer the 9th trick|pg||

nt|petergill: Hi Andy, Jordon|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: again i admit i have some problem to open that hand 1@c but well systemic so.. no choice .. here thougth nto causing problem |pg||
nt|twcho: while a @s lead will leave declarer finding for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: This is the South who just opened a 10-count and swindled a game...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B23 at OR is 2@S W. Can be hard. Here it was 2@D+1|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW|pg||

nt|rodal f: Nope. Direct|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: perhaps he felt the gods were watching him|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that was the first significant card play error by NZ in the whole match - 40 of Indonesia's 41 imps have come from basic bidding errors by NZ players, such as when to bid ...|pg||
nt|petergill: game, how to compete etc|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW should wind up in a thin 3N contract|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|offthebend: Pele may be getting excited and try the slam |pg||
nt|rodal f: B10 I didn't watch. OR 1@S NS and CR 1NT+1 EW. A doubble score to come.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: Sorry, maybe I have my South's mixed up...|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: For a photo of Wang Hongli, she's wearing the red scarf at http://www.nwpu.edu.cn/english/NewsEvents/NPUNews/84817.htm|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12 was 300 to NS|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: That near slam for NS, where EW had there best at 5@C-2|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D still 0-6HP as u got from a spec Sylvian:)|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1@s is relay 2@c should shoulg a certain force ? 2@d is relay again |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12: 5@CX was a good save - 4@H would have made - declarer should play @HA then !J in 4@h, after West has shown 7-4 (and thus short @H) in the bidding|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure what 2@s was all about...maybe an invite (replacing 2N)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: What if N had 15HP with @Da and not J. Still 1@S and not 1@C=16+ I belive|pg||
nt|rodal f: Kiwi at the lead after B10|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jjsb: i dont know what will be bidding but pretty sure North will find ways to shows 6-4 and that kind of strength :) and pretty sure also this will ended up 4@h |pg||
nt|jjsb: ty operator :) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Have S forced for game now. Normaly Y, but....|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tejjyid: That's a good auction|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: Seems very likely|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|offthebend: Lucky for North but Prime AK and Ace -- did not cooperate , very timid bidding |pg||
nt|jjsb: i cant see any clear way not to loose the 2@s 1@d and 1@c (at least) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u are|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tejjyid: time-saving lead|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|petergill: 4 rounds of clubs, ruffing with @HQ, would be great defence, but alas S was dealt an attractive @S lead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jjsb: plus i have the impression the defense has a clear idea of North distribution |pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: Iexpoect Ace and anoterh @D soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|petergill: If a top sapde was led at Trick 1, then a club switch to lock declarer out of dummy would be great defence|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tejjyid: Well, of course he cant see the hand as we can|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: South can do little else but continue @h and hope declarer errs later|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tejjyid: he's worried by the Kxx of @D possibility; then he'd need some black suit magic to get home|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  on this hand it works well as W hand is too top heavy in @hs...but usually with 9 hcp and pd overcalling 1NT, 3N seems to be automatic (esp. when vul)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jjsb: i take back the 4 loosers i see 5 now |pg||
nt|rodal f: B23 ended = ups. And 6IMP for China|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: one way to find that defence would be that if declarer has a 2nd @H, the defence has little chance|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, I agree 100% with Andy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|twcho: good guess by north|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: always push to a vul game opposite a 1NT overcall|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c5|nt|twcho: there must be some reason for east not leading his partner's suit|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jjsb: East insure the down 1 and i believe rigth he is |pg||
nt|rodal f: U as me would have done the same at team.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 2@S = 4 cards|pg||
nt|jjsb: well not to be said u have to be a little "carefull" if east from that point ...|pg||
nt|jjsb: but i dont see any reason to play that Q @d |pg||
pc|s9|nt|offthebend: 1S down 5 -- doesn't look very appetising to team mates :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|tejjyid: perhaps this is the better line, in fact|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: but it requires a (quite possible, not double dummy at all) top spade at Trick 1 to have a look at dummy|pg||
nt|twcho: so 2@d+1|pg||
nt|twcho: only +1|pg||
nt|twcho: still a trump to lose|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|petergill: but with 9 points for the 3 @H stoppers and only 6 points elsewhere in 3433 shape, West's hand is more like a 14 count than a 15 count|pg||

nt|rodal f: B11 OR at 3NT and here 1NT+3. Need to find there @C tricks after @DH income at E. @CQ best resturn and not K as here|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems so|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1s 4 @s and next one ! :) (1@s is limited so i dont see slam there ) better not to give some help for defense (thouth it wil be the dummy) |pg||

nt|jjsb: a splinter |pg||
nt|jjsb: well maybe im too pessimitic not to see slam there , my bad ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: more could be said about the defence of the last hand, but perhaps silence is appropriate  |pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: with @SK onside, 6@s plays well, but I think 6@s is a touch less than 50% chance, thus should not be bid. But I'm not sure|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C was splinter|pg||
nt|petergill: some (not me) say not to splinter with bare king|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C artificial game try, playing Two Way Checkback|pg||
nt|offthebend: good and lucky part score bidding by NZ |pg||
nt|rodal f: 140 contra 300 ain't good|pg||
nt|offthebend: can collect 500 now on good defence otherwise 300 for sure |pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: B12 OR NS at 2@H. Here 4@H+1|pg||

nt|jjsb: when i start 2nt and other start with 1nt we can all see why 1 @c is better" |pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodal f: If 20-22 and 5@C with 22HP. Should S upgrade to 23HP. I mean it's correct but....|pg||
nt|jjsb: 2nt not fitted i guess ? |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|twcho: and the cards are lying friendly for declarer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: There's a good case to bid something on the East cards, especially if 2@S shows spades and a minor. The argument is that if you don't bid something, partner will surely lead the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: suit of your small singleton, which will eb a very bad start for the dfence, and you are not vul, so take the risk and avoid your fate defending 1NT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: For any NZ fans out there, datums for NZ Open Team's pairs in Rounds 1-7 are: B-C +19, +14, +8 and -30, T-W -19, -13, -5, +24 (vs P Huang) and -18; B-L -51, -31 and -23. |pg||
nt|petergill: Good point, Andy|pg||

nt|rodal f: B26 to make swing it magistern. OR ended 5@C. Will end 11 or 12tr. Here 3NT with @S 2-1 at NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next Round start in 2 hrs.|pg||
nt|offthebend: so lose 2 imps instead of possible gain for australia |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last Board Thank You ALL|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: next Round start in 50 min|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Indonesia - China (Open)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B25 3NT as here|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board Thank You ALL|pg||
nt|jjsb: around 25 no major fit ... u start to know my sentence now :) |pg||
nt|twcho: this is quite a low scoring match so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board Thank you ALL|pg||
nt|kerasidis: ty all guys!|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 13, the other table is in 3NT as Andy predicted, so it is likely to be 6 imps to NZ|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 12 proved to be a disaster for the Kiwis|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round Indonesia - China  ( Ladies )|pg||
nt|andyv:  fun hand here, Perer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzek: Australia - New Zealand (Lady)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|petergill: Thanks to Chayes Luang-On, our operator who has done a great job, and to the people in Malaysia who make this broadcast from Kuala Lumpur possible|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last board. Ths to Chayes. Exelent vug job. Tks to the specs for all ure inputs. Make u be at the alert. Ths also to Gupta and Ebery by ure nice comments.|pg||
nt|jjsb: ty operator !!! let me take little tile to thank all our vugraph who does an awesome job !! |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round start in 50 min|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thailand - China Hong Kong (Open Team )|pg||
nt|jjsb: i can assure u (i did it sometimes) its more complicated as what u think.. players can just not play from like 5 minutes and then cards will literally throw on the table !! if ur ...|pg||
nt|jjsb: not ready !! |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|jjsb: moind u , Sout watched the vulnerability before doing that one :) |pg||
mb|2D|nt|offthebend: thx all |pg||
nt|rodal f: As the spec shall have the same by there comment putting us at the sharpness|pg||
nt|jjsb: but this can create a little problem actually ....|pg||
nt|petergill: which should make the score about 51-10 to Indo for Bds 1-9 and Bds 11-13, with 4 bds still to be scored |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Patrick Huang did well to find the heart ruff needed to beat 6@C at the other table|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ths for inviting me Chayes. Been nice together with u nice specs:)|pg||
nt|jjsb: to reach 3nt that is |pg||
mb|2S|nt|jjsb: can we considere that any of the EW player got a clear stopper? |pg||
nt|jjsb: not easy...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as @H8765 is good enough for 3NT |pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 4@s without interference from the opps|pg||
nt|petergill: 53-10 I think, Bds 1-9 being 41-1 to Indo|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: South might have bid 3@S (not 2@S) at fav vul versus ctrong club (perfect conditions for maximal preempting) as 6-4 (or 6-5) shape is as good as a 7 card suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr:(|pg||
nt|twcho: this bd is more challenging for declarer|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B25 gave 1IMP for Indonesia.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@D 5+ @D, 8+ HCP|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: and in my opinion N should remove bidding space early by raising spades directly, but his silence might prove golden, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: and so it does!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit diferent style at OR and here. OR 2@S - 4@S. IMPs to Thailand|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 10 imp for Thailand :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S fast arrival, weak in GF auction|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: Sucked them in. |pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jjsb: sensible lead .. that give that contract |pg||
nt|jjsb: funny that both line reach a contract that both suppose to be down and that after all they ended up making it ! :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  N pretty limited by initial pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  so range was about 8-10 or maybe a bad 11 that didn't open|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: An interesting point for a partnership to agree on (in advance) - does 3@s allow South to bid 4@s over 4@H, or is the responder to the 2@S preempt in complete charge, with the 2@S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: preempter being a disciplined person who must pass 4@H? China clearly thinks the latter. |pg||
nt|petergill: I think East has bid his hand with 3@S and should Pass 4@S, not double it. Then West will bid 5@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B13 ended 4@H at OR as here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|twcho: so defense has gone wild|pg||
nt|twcho: if north goes up with the ace, south's @s will be established before west @c|pg||
nt|twcho: and there is no way for him to gather 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: A coup by North gains 9 imps for the underdogs|pg||
nt|petergill: Trick 2 happened to be: cash @HK or get squeezed in red suits for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S wanted cue bids, he could have bid 3@s over 2@d to force them|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s5|nt|twcho: but declarer was also wrong in covering @cJ with @cK|pg||
nt|twcho: but if south refuse to go up with his @c honor and north win the 1st @c with ace, defense willl prevail|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c5|nt|petergill: Thanks to our excellent operator Chayes Luang-On for good work. |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank You|pg||
nt|kerasidis: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|twcho: so all the errors add up to a tie bd|pg||
nt|twcho: tks all for watching|pg||
nt|twcho: actually declarer can win the battle by ducking the 1st @s|pg||
nt|twcho: then he will be able to establish his @c before defenders establishing the @s|pg||
nt|twcho: quite an intriguing hand|pg||
nt|twcho: bye now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c4|nt|petergill: Good smooth duck of @S10|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: Any telltale hesitation on @S10 would have been fatal for the defence|pg||
nt|petergill: Although 6@H makes, there's no advantage, looking at NS's 26 cards, from being in 6@H rather than 6@S, so that was unlucky for NZ |pg||
nt|petergill: A great start for Malaysia to beat one of the stronger teams in the event|pg||
nt|petergill: APBF event's website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round Start in 3o min|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Japan - China (Lady)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the defending champions Chinese Taipei are probably marginal favourites in the Open field, with China not at full strength.|pg||
nt|petergill: in the Women's, China are of course the favourites, though their team roster has changed a bit since their World Championship win|pg||
nt|petergill: See you in about 30 minutes for the next match|pg||
nt|petergill: Website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: but the website does not have any results, so far|pg||
nt|petergill: You have to take into account that Malaysia has only about 100 bridge players, so results might take a little while to appear, with a small number of people doing a lot of work. |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|rodal f: B26 by same press as here, 4@H and N bidded 4@S as here.|pg||
nt|jjsb: ok see u all guys in 45 minutes !! thanks again ! |pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: and that's all today from Kuala Lumpur - there will be 3 more matches tomorrow |pg||
pc|c7|pc|h5|nt|petergill: 4@S is a good save, so perhaps the first approach is the better one? Or perhaps, South, with 6-4 shape being as good as a 7 card suit, should at fav vul overcall 3@S over 1@H, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: allowing North to take the 4@S save? |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rodal f: See u all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank You.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Director here|pg||
nt|jjsb: mmhhh |pg||
nt|jjsb: well 3 @h bid migth be the problem |pg||
nt|jjsb: i was about to point that aspect that normally if the defense bid a 2 suiters u cue the bid to say u cotnrol that suit |pg||
nt|jjsb: so im not sure if the explanation was same at both table |pg||
nt|jjsb: South migth point out if he know that there is no @h cotnrol he would have lead a @h ?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c8|pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  if dummy every comes down with an AKQxx of side suit after opener has bid a strong @c, it's cash out time|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec told that 2@S is 6@S+ and a opening hand at OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: See u later a time. Non know when:)|pg||
nt|granguru: es la otra patty|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: 6-4 shape is as good as a 7 card suit, just as 7-4 shape is as good as an 8 card suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone. |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round start in 20 min |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: French Polynesia - Chinese Taipei (Open)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|vugraphzek: Thank you All :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: See you tomorrow|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: a Minus 1100 result from a weak NT on Bd 13 has added more relief for French Polynesia|pg||
nt|petergill: so only 18 imps the margin|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye all|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  save the brain work for the tougher hands|pg||
nt|petergill: West sensibly tried to beat 4@S (e.g. if partner has @SA instead of @CKQ), but might have cashed @HK first |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: The last board at OR ca be a push but belive a gain for the Kiwi|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass around|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next segment start in 40 min|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lots of mistakes (big) but a few less by NZ|pg||
nt|super nova: With the Grand slam in D hand it would have been possible to bid 5nt saying we have all the key cards and the Queen, what do you think of 7.|pg||
nt|super nova: With solid clubs would have been an easy decision.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|dT|mc|11|nt|petergill: in case a heart from dummy can be pitched on clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: next round start in 30 min|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty everyone and ty peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Indonesia - China (Ladies)|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Chayes, bye everyone, until the next match in about 30 minutes I guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty specs for joining us and making this a lot of fun.|pg||
nt|petergill: that last board might have been 480 (not 450) on the red suit squeeze - it doesn't matter, the official scoresheet at http://www.2011apbf.com/ will tell you eventually|pg||
nt|petergill: Not like Eddy Manoppo to miss an easy squeeze play|pg||
