nt|leao:  claim?|pg||
nt|granguru: over 4@H N should have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|granguru: not 5@C|pg||
nt|leao:  agree. 5@c was way too risky, unless N misinterpreted the @c bid|pg||
nt|granguru: i agree that S hand is rather difficult to bid starting with 1@H...would any open with a 2 @C or a 4@C-4@D SA texas|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, they had several chances, either in biddin or in play to get it right|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c opening for me|pg||
nt|ybob: I prefer 1@H but later with problems over 1@S|pg||
nt|psyck: 4AK to 7+ @h, about 8.5 trick hand, & no 2 quick losers |pg||
