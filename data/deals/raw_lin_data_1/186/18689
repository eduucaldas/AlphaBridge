mb|p|nt|santyclz: 4@h is unexpected.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well its a good contract|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sounds to me like a demand to bid a @c slam if w has a @d control, though.|pg||

nt|kastan88: But seems names of teams and players not touching here :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosb: some sort of weak opening from East, 2@D multi?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wowie what happens here should be some fun|pg||
mb|1S|nt|oosb: ah, 3@H|pg||
nt|kastan88: If players mnames right, then teams must be: Bailey vs Hauge (group E)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: nice game if they get there|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  i like 3@h with 6-4|pg||

nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhe: they can't open weak on 2lvl in @H|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  that's an interesting constraint, I only know of Fantoni-Nunes who also do that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dutch experts believe that two of the pairs are virtually selected, Drijver-Brink and Muller-de Wijs, and that the third pair will be selected among v Prooijen-Verhees, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jansma-Paulissen and Bertens-Westra. But nothing will be official until early July|pg||

nt|kastan88: I have not got to play against Erik "Silla" this year, but year ago had some chances to direct at table, if he called TD, that's why i am saying "good friend"|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ummm, are you sure of that score, operator?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|jpmbs: I think Drijver-Brink are favorites, other 2 pairs will be exciting|pg||

mb|2N|nt|kastan88: and at once slam time|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: yes, I read somehow, that 3 best teams from each group going to Swiss A|pg||

mb|5H|nt|kastan88: doubling and curtains, I would not bid 5@S more after 2@H overcall|pg||

nt|jcomyn: we aree the lucky ones and we aint finished yet|pg||
mb|5S|nt|jbgood: EW were already at an uncomfortable level - and the old saying that the 5 level belongs to the opps is still valid from time to time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  no, even if you guessed the spades the defence has time to remove dummy's entry|pg||
nt|jpmbs: he will just try the finesses|pg||

mb|1H|nt|petergill: 2@H = 6+ spades, an increasingly common treatment, of dubious merit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and i am not making that up|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  quite difficult for North to defend, unless South's @h3 was a clue|pg||
nt|oosb: 3NT EW?|pg||

nt|santyclz: Survived for -1, could have gotten another.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And the pendulum swings back to Herbst.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: roland do you have running scoreboard number|pg||
nt|Walddk5: y, one sec|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|paulg:  this looks like a Precision 2@d opener, except they use 2@h for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: Standings after 10 of 22 rounds: 1st: Drijver Brink +72 2nd Schollaardt-wortel +42 3rd Jansma-Paulissen +27 4th Cornellisse Krijgsman +23|pg||
nt|eamongall: part score battle here I think |pg||
nt|petergill: Very dangerous when the doubler North was likely to have @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrrunda4.html|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|kastan88: so 5@Sx -1 was good sac against 5@D or 5@H in previous|pg||
nt|jbgood: but she had 12 tricks - or do I need new glasses?|pg||
nt|petergill: Claim was probably 490 not 460 then, as there were 12 tricks |pg||
nt|eamongall: suspect it was a misunderstanding ... redouble often shows 1st round @S control |pg||
nt|jbgood: we all prefer 5@d Peter, even Up Above|pg||
nt|kastan88: if you lokk on AJxxx and partner doubling 3@S!, what you think about half stopper in W (redouble?) and then half in E (3nt), I would lead A still|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and another partial|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another trappy hand|pg||
mb|4D|nt|eamongall: think so jaak|pg||
nt|kastan88: *look|pg||
nt|eamongall: probably happy to gather in 11 ..|pg||
nt|petergill: Qxx on right and K109x(x) in partner's hand, I expect|pg||
nt|kastan88: and redouble with void, not going to 5d?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: could go higher than 4h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5d a great contract agst 4h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eamongall: playing 3@S in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hate that 2s with rubbish vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  short diamonds with 4 or 5 clubs|pg||
nt|eamongall: they play quicker then I can type |pg||
nt|petergill: but a good point by Jaak - perhaps the winning lead was possible, though I would have led a low spade|pg||
nt|jbgood: this sequence is from outer space|pg||
nt|eamongall: 3@Cs ghesthem |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with those blessed minors and modern players|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcsd: will a @h lead be found ?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: course not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no problems now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eamongall: but its not meant to be those suits |pg||
nt|eamongall: so maybe both minors |pg||
nt|eamongall: Baileys cuebids |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|paulg:  North loves the @d9 return, makes it very easy for him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Jansma probably thinking he needs the spade finesse to work|pg||
nt|jbgood: another time relevant to play the singleton in opps second suit... but not too late|pg||
nt|petergill: "Aussie" not "Bailey" - Aussies bid like maniacs at fav vul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a 7-3 fit. If they have that in a major they go mad|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: 8-3 even|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  also wondering where the small diamonds are|pg||
nt|oosb: OR @D 4-4 an @H 3-3 |pg||
nt|kastan88: and something happened there too, after 3 times trumps looked as -2 (previous), must be good result for NS, if teammates not going for 6 in red suit|pg||
pc|d9|nt|eamongall: clubs here deem 4@S a make |pg||
nt|eamongall: club spots |pg||
nt|petergill: Some Aussies, or should that be Norwegians, have even maniacally tried 3NT on bare king stoppers|pg||
nt|eamongall: some maniacs play well |pg||
nt|jbgood: still - with your stack having so much honors in the short suit - 3@c nothing for me:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|oosb: must decide|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: I think 4@s would have made, as @HQ lead is very unlikely. If so, the save cut the loss to 4 imps on this board|pg||
nt|kastan88: you still forgetting about favor vulnerability, Jon, and for ever young Gavin and Kirsten|pg||
nt|jbgood: will Erik find the @d King, @c king and a heart?|pg||
nt|jbgood: not sure that is so easy...|pg||
nt|eamongall: I reckon he will play @DK ok |pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcsd: i would pplay 6 instead of TQs |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: Gavin and Kirsten were in the Australian Seniors Team which won the Asia Pacific Teams Championship last year - it's hard to believe they're old enough to play Seniors bridge, in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: my opinion |pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: well done|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oosb: @h or @S|pg||
nt|eamongall: Wow ... strike 1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jbgood: @c 2 suit pref|pg||
nt|petergill: Gavin and Kirsten were the first Tasmanians to play for Australia, I think. The 2nd was Hugh Grosvenor, right now in Kuala Lumpur. |pg||
nt|kastan88: Erik's nick "silla" in estonian means bridge, so he will find bridge over the trouble water|pg||
nt|petergill: Was @C2 suit pref?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|oosb: and must decide right now :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  but hearts 3-3 only gives him 1@d, 1@s, 4@h and 2@c ... still needs a trick|pg||
nt|oosb: @s seems higher %age|pg||
pc|sK|nt|oosb: no he has the rest if  @H 3-3|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@c no 2|pg||
nt|jbgood: Helgemo at the other table didnt even bother to bid anything - is he too old Peter?|pg||
nt|petergill: Or was it low encourage?|pg||
nt|petergill: Great defence ---> 500 and 8 imps|pg||
nt|jbgood: normal to play suit pref in that pos|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|oosb: not*|pg||
nt|mcsd: good defence|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c8|nt|jcomyn: surely the point here is w bid 4d not 3d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  he will make three clubs on a squeeze, but he did not know that it was working|pg||
nt|petergill: Erik S.. did win the Bermuda Bowl in 2007 and his play here shows why. |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|oosb: South squeezed if he has 4@H and K@S|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c4|nt|eamongall: its hard to commentate when I am getting a rundown on Maddie McCann case in the background |pg||
pc|hT|nt|oosb: on run of @C now|pg||
nt|oosb: Sorry on run of @H I meant|pg||
nt|oosb: must throw @C or K@S |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|kastan88: what case?|pg||
nt|eamongall: somebody was reading heavily last night |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
mc|11|nt|paulg:  his line has maintained chances of 3-3 breaks in both hearts and clubs, but squeeze chances when clubs do not break ..all against a spade finesse when hearts do not break|pg||
nt|oosb: could still play 9@H|pg||
nt|oosb: Very tough hand|pg||
nt|oosb: will make the bulletin if he makes though|pg||
nt|oosb: very nice ending|pg||
nt|paulg:  very little to guide him |pg||
nt|oosb: Bets on A vs 9?|pg||
nt|oosb: I'm with A|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think he's play ace, eventually|pg||
nt|oosb: does %age favor 9 though/|pg||

nt|kastan88: live scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2H|nt|eamongall: 41 earlier this year .. Wilkpedia |pg||
nt|jbgood: 6@c down on a di ruff - no such thing in 6 @d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and oif course you know the bridge term for an 8-card suit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|petergill: Kirsten might even push to the 5 or 6 level in @H|pg||
nt|petergill: though she doesn't bid as free-spiritedly as her husband|pg||
nt|jbgood: kibs tell me that even 5@c sh have been beaten in the CR - and right they are, since Popova made a void showing @d bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: TRUMP!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|eamongall: Team Comhar is Irelands best performing mixed pairs in the recent past |pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah you are all too clever|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: will be very exiting show here, if all the boards are such kind of as in this match|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Dbl of @H would have showed 4 or 5 spades, so 1@S probably shows @D or something like that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: p p x|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: these guys could be heading to slam in @Cs ... |pg||
nt|jbgood: 1@s either is @d or bal 6-9 - I think, so ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: yeah guess 1@S is @Ds|pg||
nt|petergill: Kirsten decided to get the lead-directing bid in first|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have not agreed any suit, so 4NT was "pick a minor", wasn't it?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: x is automatic|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|eamongall: yes I now see that ... unlikely to be blackwood|pg||
nt|petergill: Jeanette might dbl for t/io|pg||
nt|petergill: converted to penalty|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|oosb: losing just 2 aces, wonder why only 10 tricks in the other room|pg||
nt|petergill: Will EW get all their tricks again for 500? They surely should. |pg||
nt|mcsd: welcome Petrer :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: prefer X with s hand giving p option|pg||
nt|petergill: hi Miroslav and John|pg||

nt|jcomyn: hi mate|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|petergill: South being a passed hand has really shown 4-6 in majors, otherwise her initial Pass makes no sense|pg||
nt|mcsd: now @D leads from w seems best|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice @s stop, unexpected.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mcsd: forsing defence|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: so North, if he truly trusts partner, could run to 3@S, knowing spades must break 3-2 on EW's auction|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree should do somthing since s originally passed|pg||
nt|mcsd: but w may have 4@S?|pg||

nt|mcsd: e bidded 3@D W may have 4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|petergill: It's very much Jeanette's Reitzer's style to Dbl for t/o a lot with a singleton under (i.e. on the right of) the bidder - her old partner the late Ted Chadwick encouraged this ...|pg||
nt|petergill: winning style of bidding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh yes of course|pg||
nt|mcsd: Now S has same trump length as W|pg||
nt|mcsd: anyruff made by s is critical|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a very unnecessary big peanlty for s i think|pg||
nt|mcsd: That is forsing defence all about.|pg||
nt|petergill: only 300|pg||
nt|petergill: @s, @C, @D ruff and @s exit will be the play, for 300|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eamongall: 3 imps to Team Bailey|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: Next mach will start at 3 pm|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all - enjoyable bridge!|pg||
nt|petergill: If West bid 6@C, South would have Lightner Doubled, knowing her trusting husbandn would dare not lead anything but a @D (@S cannot be right = no dbl of 6@C, and @H cannot be right, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: so Lightner Dbl must ask for @d lead) and get 500. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bulletin 1 at http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Poznan/Bulletins/bul01.pdf|pg||

nt|petergill: 500 now|pg||
nt|mcsd: a @S may be good|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: @H play by South was error, had to simply take her tricks and get trump in ending|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how often u take your eye off the ball when u realise u are in  a very bad contract|pg||
nt|petergill: 800 if she finesses, 500 if she does not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: like in golf - take your medicine and get out of there|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oosb: 10 tricks|pg||

nt|paulg:  playing safely, unsurprisingly|pg||
nt|petergill: 300 if she doesn't finesse|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcsd: she must take A@S and discard @S on @c T|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: as West has one too many trumps and will be endplayed|pg||
