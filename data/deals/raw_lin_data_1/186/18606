mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but to be honest, when i played that system  I would have opened South 1@C to get the strong NT rebid|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with forcing NT systems|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: then i would have played 1N instead of 3N    for whatever that is worth|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but 3N rebid seems excessive with 4333, no fillers and dubious @HQ|pg||
