nt|vugraphzek: @D in hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  since 4@h wasn't making, this may not be a great save|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Over for cross ruffs?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By @H as the start|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: The bidding and play (@CK unblock = doubleton) indicate that clubs are 7-2. Thus declarer expects some bad breaks in other suits. |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: oh|pg||
nt|jcwla: N with a sure trick is there to wield the ax and bidding 5 over 5 is not in the picture at this level so W has elected to "take insurance" and although not a winning decision the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: cost will not be too dear.|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|s6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jcwla: Let us say, it would take exceedingly friendly defense to bring home 4@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  since 4@h dbld can go for 300-500, the cost isn't that cheap|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: I can see 9 tricks, but declarer needs friendlier spades, I think|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|petergill: A good general principle is: never overruff with ace from Axx or Axx in trumps, usually ok to overruff with bare ace or Ax in trumps. |pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|petergill: @CK play at Trick 1 was too revealing to declarer. Better to play small on the club lead, then the king on the 2nd round of clubs might be from Kxx - less revealing to declarer|pg||

nt|andyv:  one of the problems with the weak hand making a decision at the 5 level|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|2C|nt|rodal f: Ns better be caredul.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Regardless of the level S chose (and made a choice here that worked out great), showing the majors and then bidding @H's did show the nature of the hand well.|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: Jed and C Wu are Defending Champions in this event - they won last year, after much training by Patrick. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: All with a good color exsept N who will become the boss|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: I might have rebid only 2@D, not liking my Jx in RHO's suit nor my bare ace, but I think most people would rebid 3@D|pg||
mb|4H|nt|offthebend: 3D must be a Limit raise or better Bergan raise |pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe anyway by +1|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Gupta:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 1@H 10-14 may have long minor|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hmm...usually 1@D does not include a 5-card M, no?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 1@D showed spades, 9-13 hcp|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps they are playing negative free bids.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh OK.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Steve.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Steve:)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|petergill: 7@D, needing 4-3 @H's or short @HK, is a good spot if NS are silent, but not quite so good once NS have bid  |pg||
nt|petergill: This contract looks likely to fail, but you never know|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  would 2@h over 2@c have been forcing or not?|pg||

nt|petergill: witrh Australia leading|pg||
nt|offthebend: australia almost lost big on the previous board by playing in 3NT instead of 5-4 H fit |pg||

mb|1N|an|12-15|nt|petergill: another interesting hand - 6@D being very aggressive, 3NT being normal|pg||
nt|petergill: China's losses to Japan and Thailand might be explained by China not being at full strength this year|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: yes, or 11-14. Their club is 15+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1Nt will be East's bid|pg||

nt|andyv:  2@c looks like single suiter |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|petergill: as 2@D would be like a 2/1, 10 or 11+ with @D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to bid here, as East, because I hate balancing|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: and most likely a C lead and 11 tricks |pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT forcing for a round Chayes?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: defenetly it wins|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6-4 is always a good shape, even if the texture of the 6 card suit is a bit shaky|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth could try 3@C here, if that's invivtaioal and South has confirmed a @C suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  that treatment over NT seems to be losing favor|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzek: he not arert|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East gets a 2nd chance - I prefer to save my 2nd chances for more importtant things :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: S lead is also possible|pg||
nt|rodal f: Domes for -1 anyway.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: They talked convention before match start 10 min|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: As u presumed.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf  updated after round 6. Hong Kong leading now, Thailand 10th|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thailand killed from a slam? Let's ee what OR will do|pg||
nt|jcwla: Gives the opponents an extra round of room to maneuver.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|petergill: I agree with Sun Ming - @H10 (the great heart suit) makes 3@H a better rebid than 3NT (only one stop in @C) or 3@S|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they can unscramble their tricks, 2@h should have gone down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  now it looks like it's making|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Careful with the @S10 now|pg||

nt|andyv:  E lead looks pretty natural though|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: If East had ovecalled 2@D the first time; West would find the raise to 3@D more easily|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|offthebend: shouldn't take too long to claim  |pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  W, looking at that @s suit in dummy, might have thought about taking the A@d and switching to @c|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwi_joker: I note that with 9-6-3 Trevor gave (upside-down) count with the 6. I must say I like loud signals, when loud cannot cost. (ie, the 9 here)|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I don't like XX in case the auction gets pre-empted, but in practice i vaery rarely does, so you get to bid the hand this way|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@SX costs 500, but EW probably would bid on to 5@H. |pg||
nt|offthebend: any EXCUSE to open or overcall these days |pg||
nt|kerasidis: so the only forcing bid over overcall is double?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: whihc is very convenient|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yet again S treats the hand as both M's despite the large discrepancy.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: 2@S, bidding around the singleton, is preferred|pg||
nt|petergill: Now 4@D?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Guess was old fashioned treatment of "double for the majors" over the big club, so an easy 4@S call for N|pg||

nt|petergill: 3@SX is worth only 500, not 800, for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: and 3NT is easy, so the difference is negligible|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 15-17NT for NS and a easy push|pg||

nt|rodal f: 2@H=longer @S than @C? No idea. But remember the 1@H opening by 10XXXX|pg||
nt|offthebend: 1C was artificial strong ( 15+ )|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 2@H maybe trf after 1NT|pg||

pc|s3|nt|offthebend: yes 2H showed 5 cards in S |pg||
nt|tejjyid: and East couldn't find a raise? Maybe East's @C's were so good he thought the X meant something else|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: OK. So not 16+ as I wait for at 1@C prec variant|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Yes|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcwla: Here there's a useful card and a ruffing value to go with the four small.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|petergill: Just a question of how many 50's this contract fails by, given the misfit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Declarer's @D's will serve as trump substitutes, and the @S pips prevent the defence getting 3@S tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: In Round 1, Board 16 contributed to some upset results, with a good slam bid by the good teams failing due to a bad break|pg||
nt|petergill: At some point, perhaps on the 2nd round of @d's, I expect her to hook @DK and make 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking . .  .|pg||
nt|petergill: though there is a big worry that at the unfav vulnerability, West may have @DKx or bare @D king|pg||
nt|petergill: but Japanese women tend not to worry all that much about vulnerability and bid 3@S anyway, no on 2nd thought, Japanese players are very disciplined in the bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: surely Sun Ming knows this EW better than I do|pg||
nt|petergill: East is a well-known fairly famous player, but I don't know much about West|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: It's a vul game, after all. Big payout chance vs small chance of -1|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: the heart break will lead her to count West as 7123 shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyway, I'm not in love with this sequence.  This sounds like a very big @H hand that's one-suited in @H's.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|s4|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|petergill: you have to be a very good player to do things like that - the mundane average players just take the @D finesse, in their innocence |pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit strange that they want the contract over to the weak hand?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i do see an other swing here for ew|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: If East plays a spade, West has to duck|pg||

nt|petergill: @CAQ lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@D would complete the shape nicely, but wuld it be forcing? (It should be)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tif So, West has to decide whether to try 3NT or 5@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Q empty oposite a singleton isn't great|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: At non vul u don.t risk anything if u stop under 3NT. Max 1IMP. But at vul it cost. The reason 3NT bidded by the 24HP|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't the luckyest lead I,ve seen at a color partscore.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|petergill: but declarer seems might be one trick short, unless two spades can be ruffed in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: The duck is an attempt to avoid the fatal @d switch|pg||
nt|petergill: A very clever attempt|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so far, nice bidding|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the problem is, from West's point of view, that if he has to ruff @H, it will be with good trumps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: South needs to play a red suit now|pg||
nt|offthebend: easy 8 tricks here |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|tejjyid: so I think he has to bid 3NT - unless he decides this isn;t forcing. We have to say "nice stop" - although, I think East might be surprised|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Good deduction by South about the reason for East's clever play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: S hand lacks entries for 2 spade ruffs in dummy, so might have to rely on @H break (no good) or @s hook ( no good)|pg||
nt|petergill: so this looks like -1|pg||
nt|petergill: even if @DJ is led and not covered, 6@D still seems to fail - perhaps I'm mistaken?|pg||
nt|petergill: expect a very long tank by Wang Hongli|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: perhaps a better auction is 4@D by N over 3NT, then if 4NT by S is signoff, then even 4NT might be hard work to make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: NS play high to encourage|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might a bit cloudy that 1IMP. U loose and win if u are correct, but at long term u loose only 1IMP pr. board if 50% fail etc 50% in.|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: alas @D4 was not high enough - what bad luck in the @D pips|pg||
nt|petergill: though S probably should have worked out that continuing @d had to be better than playing clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: as it was impossible for E to duck Trick 1 with anything other than a singleton club|pg||
nt|andyv:  or is that 5 or 6@h that they were showing?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 or 6|pg||

nt|petergill: with Qx under dummy's !AK, there is no reason not to cover @DJ|pg||
nt|petergill: South reasoned that @CA lead was the act of a person with a possible trump trick|pg||
nt|petergill: If @H are 3-3, playing @H now is OK, and if @H 4-2, then must ruff @h now|pg||

mb|1D|nt|petergill: 4@S might get doubled|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new interesting board up|pg||
nt|jjsb: this one interesting also , its not that frequent u should play a slam on a 7 card fit rather than on a 8 card fit |pg||
nt|kerasidis: not tough to guess this auction will end in 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: a really weird situation|pg||
nt|rodal f: B3 OR got @DA as the lead and found @CQ. for 6@S= Well done 13IMP to China.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|offthebend: Spades OVER hearts |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
mb|2C|nt|petergill: so declarer preferede to play for @S fiensse (50% chance) than for person with short @H to have short @D (less than 50%)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still an ok sac in 5@H|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes wd|pg||
nt|twcho: one may have to discuss whether transfer is still on here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 2nt attacking bid ..wild|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are probably on our way to 3@D here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|petergill: West knows East has less than 3 hearts, so unless North has 5 or 6 hearts (unlikely?), West has 4 top tricks to 41S|pg||
nt|petergill: to 4@S I mean|pg||
nt|offthebend: They can make 5S on S finesse and by playing D towards the J |pg||
nt|rodal f: By that long thinking if no screens W have problem to bid. |pg||
nt|rodal f: But can tey take the safe income?|pg||
nt|jjsb: some in the audience  point out 1nt can only be made if junior :) not sure about that :) |pg||
nt|jjsb: basically on a strong club|pg||
nt|jjsb: u try to overcall as far as poossible |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: On for a new push it seems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Tommy:)|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|twcho: NS is probably the top pair of HK|pg||
nt|kerasidis: about a weak ago ...i saw a very expeirienced pair misunderstanding their bid upon overcall on 1nt opening|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 16 imps lost|pg||
nt|twcho: and they are very aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi tommy|pg||
nt|twcho: hi dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|rodal f: B4 OR ended 3@HN. Here it was 5@DE= IMPs for Thailand.|pg||
nt|twcho: so one have to agree explicitly with partner when the transfer is still on  or not|pg||
nt|twcho: sell out to 3H with 7411?|pg||
nt|twcho: too cheap indeed|pg||
nt|kerasidis: of course...but there are some many difficulties yet to deal with|pg||
nt|rodal f: Cheep or cheap. I love the speciality made by cheep's:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can dbl here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so I think the odds massively favour a penalty dbl of 4@s on the West cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like the BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php    = til B20|pg||
nt|jjsb: a pass folloxed by a bid is normally stronger than initial overcal |pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes cheep endeed especially when partner showed values|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Do they play with screens?|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4Sx in a limited system and a known 10 card H fit is a bit surprising |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: sceen|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: screen|pg||
nt|jjsb: i still admit , i can see with that hand why i dont want to play a strong club ..|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's hand a bit difficult to evaluate but a 10 count does deserve more than a suit preference|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: +3 and next|pg||
nt|jjsb: the idea if opening 1@c with N is kinda scaring me ...|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|petergill: so I was unfair to South - her line of play is perhaps best|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have played @HK at Trick 2, in case partner's heart was singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: then switched to clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: The low heart play shows that they have 100% faith in partner's count card at Trick 1|pg||
nt|jjsb: but of course not saying its bad !!! of course it can be more than helpfull in a lot of situation |pg||
nt|rodal f: Good news. Not at the @H trap. Sad news, could get some more income.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: If no screen and pass from NS the TD should be called after the board is finnich.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|offthebend: 5H can be made by playing Clubs early and guessing the C J otherwise one down |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Then might harder for call the TD.|pg||
nt|andyv:  despite the sterile nature of his hand, 3@d was a reasonable alternative|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|petergill: with 2/1 GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_S.pdf|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: so all the bids after 1@S were forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough problem for West; I would have made a pre-emptive @C raise on the 1st round & Perhaps X is better than 2@H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: @CK onside  so no problems|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jjsb: will play AK of @h now i guess|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: I'm sure East is expecting the @H suit to be 6 cards long|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: It is a light-looking 10 but I'm with you, Andy, this seems Milquetoast.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|jjsb: and then +1 or = depends of where he will try to throw the @c |pg||

pc|h6|pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||

nt|petergill: might have to cash a heart before playing trumps in the scenario I was describing|pg||
nt|petergill: then +100|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 at OR: 3NT as here Here was 9 tr|pg||
nt|jjsb: i guess if u ask what to open with East u will have a lot of options|pg||
nt|jjsb: depending ur style |pg||
nt|jjsb: im personally a 2@h opening |pg||
nt|jcwla: NZ on the board with 1 on 7 (130 vs. 100)|pg||
mb|1S!|an|11-15 5+!D|nt|offthebend: likely 4S contract here UNLESS West overcalls 1S :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so this must show something besides @s:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcwla: Completing the @D-@S inversion.|pg||
mb|d!|an|relay with some value|nt|rodal f: Interesting cards NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next Round Indonesia - China (Open)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jjsb: but i am pretty sure a lot will find pass or also 1@h |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|petergill: and her (relative newcomer, compared to Wang Hongli and Sun Ming) partner Feng Xuefeng is ranked  48 woman in the world due mainly to the win in Philly|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D inverted, forcing|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H shows stopper, hardly even alertable in the modern era, as it is so normal|pg||
nt|rodal f: B20 will become a =|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr 1 IMP for China|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS have any agreements in place, 2@s, 3@s and 4@s should all be natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  and use the @d suit for cue bidding purposes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Often u will drop for 2-2 if u miss QXXX as @C here|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 ended =|pg||
nt|offthebend: Pele didn't Really need to keep the bidding open with that poor 12 points and non working QJ in spades |pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: 3@C shows stopper|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 13-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Good lead!|pg||
nt|petergill: I like it - go for the good 4 card suit ahead of the weak longer suit with no entries  - a very sensible thing to try, especially in a match in which your team is the underdog |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT should fail now - on a heart lead, the bold 3NT had some chance. |pg||
nt|jjsb: i am afraid im not sure of there system on 1@c i just that 1@d is expressing a number of point |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 5@D and 3@S both are safe|pg||
nt|petergill: and 3NT I meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: S think 3@S is suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as I was wrong when I belived NS to paly 15-17NT. This is precission and relay or only @D from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: N will bid and show the adwanced que in @S I hope|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: ohh|pg||
nt|rodal f: S can't pass since 2/1 is made|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: Declarer might still come to 9 tricks if he plays a heart to the ten|pg||
nt|petergill: which is not impossible|pg||
nt|petergill: only "might" = more likely is -100 or -200|pg||
nt|tejjyid: excellent; East's subsequent 2@H bid will say 6 cards & too weak to open|pg||
nt|jcwla: Query whether N is really ever going to find out information to play somewhere other than 4@S opposite pd's vul 2-level overcall?|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, little gained by the convention here as NS easily bid their hands.  Would a 3@d opener have been more effective?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think all roads lead to Rome on this hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  but took a long time to build those roads|pg||
pc|d6|nt|offthebend: good stop - this should come to easy 8 tricks unless Heart suit is attacked |pg||
nt|tejjyid: whihc, these days, is pretty weak|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: E thinks that 4@D is strong, slam try. West just bid 4@D as not so strong|pg||
nt|petergill: If @d is trumps, before bidding 4NT, always check if 5@H response takes you past your last safe haven|pg||
nt|rodal f: UPS. THIS CAN COST|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D can also be controls if they use it for 0-2|pg||
nt|petergill: West would have raised a 3@D opener to 5@D.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: U meam u have underbidded by ure 16HP? |pg||
nt|twcho: strange not to introduce his 2nd good suit  by south|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South sould have bid that @S suit at some stage though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, over the 1@H; later for the tightrope walkers|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: I think E failed to do so - or perhaps 4NT does not mean what I think it means|pg||
nt|jjsb: with the @c situation this one seems to be an ok contract |pg||
nt|jcwla: On 8, where NS here played 2@D making 4, their NZ counterparts failed by 3 in 3NT, so 7 more to Indonesia, up 35 through half the comparisons.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|petergill: anyway, West worked out that this is not a slam auction - else East would bid 4NT earlier - and thus had the commonsense to signoff with her poor hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|offthebend: and paula better overtake the second spade in case west ducks twice :)|pg||
nt|jjsb: i am been told its a 0 to 7 |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jjsb: i think @d looks like the only possible considering the dummy ? |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|offthebend: oops - why did she throw the S |pg||
nt|andyv:  3N was good contract except for lack of tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|petergill: South has a difficult time getting off lead now|pg||
nt|offthebend: still OK |pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: 600 to EW, after an exciting auction|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|petergill: Nice play - @CJ was best, only because all other options looked bad|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: Good @H play - devastating defence |pg||
pc|c3|nt|jjsb: and that contract is all about @c so |pg||
nt|twcho: with such good hand and good suit quality|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|rodal f: With the 16HPs Y. Agree u|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: So a presission where Weiwei should have had some lessons for some?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kerasidis: or by north even if its not stronh|pg||
mc|8|nt|andyv:  somehow something seems amiss in the play of that hand|pg||
pg||

nt|rodal f: B23 3NT at OR. Will cost as here I belive. Was -2 at vul|pg||
nt|offthebend: so , NZ may pay for this overcall and keep opps out of a possible 4S contract |pg||
nt|rodal f: B8 OR at 5@S and here 5@H-1|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4S may have made on a non club lead though |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 10: West's duck of the @H at trick 2 was very good defence|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|offthebend: 5H-1 had to be a loss bec 5S was cold |pg||
nt|rodal f: The Viking Club made by: Aa - Grøthein - Tundal are only by relays if for a natural bid comes up some few times.|pg||
nt|twcho: slam|pg||
nt|twcho: can they bid it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: In the Women's, China having won world cahmpionships in 2009 and 2010 are the favourites, with Indonesia some mild danger I guess, and Japan are one of medal contenders. |pg||
nt|petergill: and North could have ducked @CJ|pg||
nt|twcho: but EW have a cheap sacrifice over NS red slam|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 1@S? 2@S? 3@S? much too strong for 3, IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Many specs who send me SMS now. Can't answer u all. Sorry.|pg||
nt|twcho: 2NT is a game forcing raise|pg||
nt|rodal f: B5 5@C will end -1|pg||
nt|twcho: nothing to stop east from introducing his suit|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jjsb: 1@h P 2@h and probably 3@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: 280 make 7IMP|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: ther rest of the defence was fine, but the outcome for NS was very poor|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 180 minus 100 ake 2IMP|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3NT has 9 top tricks, 4@H might be harder with trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|rodal f: But non vul so a 9IMPer for KIWI it seems.|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3NT may be bid on this hand . 17 hcp and a 5-card suit is too good for 1NT opening |pg||
pc|c9|nt|petergill: well. almost top tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: 'make|pg||
nt|jcwla: A few choices for S on the rebid - anyone pick anything different?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: 2@S Smolen |pg||
nt|petergill: GF with 5 @H and 4@S |pg||
nt|rodal f: Will W see the big value at @S8 or does it matter?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jjsb: North decided enough of discussion i want to play 4 @h and i guess this has no play |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was the X from W K Lai noted to E?|pg||
nt|andyv:  rebidding AQxxx suits has never been a favorite...I'd rather raise @ss|pg||
pc|d3|nt|offthebend: they have to find a way to cash 4 club tricks after winning a D - to beat 3NT |pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|petergill: @CK lead leaves declarer with some work to do, to make 41H|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: Good stop by NS, but will the 5-1 break cause problems?|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: west said sorry sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: after pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: I understand him:) Clear quebids|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: no|pg||
nt|twcho: I think they play with screen, right?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think I'd try and keep the @H support a secret|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if I didn't pass 2NT, then I would bid 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now the defence has a blueprint of what to do|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not only did NZ not gain on 9, they lost 5, bidding 4@H but going down 1. So this one is all Indonesia.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
pc|d7|nt|twcho: so NE are screenmates|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: Perhaps declarer should set up the side suit first, which is usually a good policy?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|twcho: just one down and an excellent result for EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: So well pressed by EW by a possible lost slam for China.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i dont know what would be the ended contract if Mak opened 1@d|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although, apparently the defence aren't architects|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|rodal f: B21 ended as here 3NT|pg||
nt|jjsb: for down 2 . are we really suppose to bid 4@h rigth away Rodal?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: wel, that's a good start for NOrth and he can x-ruff his way home|pg||
pc|h8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't @CQ free there? Not the K|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had to dbl hook the @ds starting with the J from S hand|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|jjsb: oh well i guess yes ... EW are not playing badly in minors thougth so .. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Me. Never. 3@H always |pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: she seems to have 7 tricks even if she loses trump control|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|petergill: the 590 will be just 5 imps to Fr Poly, with @DA the (unapproved, in my opinion) opening lead to 4@s undoubled at the other table|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes CQ is better card and get the encourgement by west|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: The 2@D I'm unshure at. 2/1 and foring with color or rev drurey?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The third choice of course is 1NT but hard to think that could be best.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|petergill: Chinese Taipei women's team includes two women who almost made their Open team, so they should do well too|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: B23 also at the table|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jjsb: i like to have some kind of shortness to play a 21-22 game contract even on 9 card fit ... |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Let them find it and take 1 IMP. 4 @H make risk as I feel it.|pg||
nt|jjsb: i would have double maybe showing some cards a good 3@h bid |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was the deal with ure mate. Cards or hart:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|twcho: as long as east dare to introduce his @s suit, it is very difficult for NS to buy the contract|pg||
nt|kerasidis: would any one open this 1@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  reverse the @ss and @hs, and 1NT is fine|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|twcho: i would open 1@h|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h5|nt|jcwla: Of course.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|petergill: Declarer is in dire danger. I think @S to queen and ruffing spades in dummy looks like a much better plan|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h7|nt|petergill: East knows by adding N's points that N has @DAQ, so will exit in spades|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, he doesn't know that - North could have @SJ or 1DQ|pg||
nt|petergill: or @DAQ|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West has discouraged @d and encouraged @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: K@D in Hand|pg||
