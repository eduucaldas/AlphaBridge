nt|petergill: There's a good case to bid something on the East cards, especially if 2@S shows spades and a minor. The argument is that if you don't bid something, partner will surely lead the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: suit of your small singleton, which will eb a very bad start for the dfence, and you are not vul, so take the risk and avoid your fate defending 1NT|pg||

nt|petergill: An interesting point for a partnership to agree on (in advance) - does 3@s allow South to bid 4@s over 4@H, or is the responder to the 2@S preempt in complete charge, with the 2@S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: preempter being a disciplined person who must pass 4@H? China clearly thinks the latter. |pg||

pc|c6|nt|petergill: Good smooth duck of @S10|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Any telltale hesitation on @S10 would have been fatal for the defence|pg||
nt|petergill: Although 6@H makes, there's no advantage, looking at NS's 26 cards, from being in 6@H rather than 6@S, so that was unlucky for NZ |pg||
nt|petergill: A great start for Malaysia to beat one of the stronger teams in the event|pg||
nt|petergill: APBF event's website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round Start in 3o min|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Japan - China (Lady)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the defending champions Chinese Taipei are probably marginal favourites in the Open field, with China not at full strength.|pg||
nt|petergill: in the Women's, China are of course the favourites, though their team roster has changed a bit since their World Championship win|pg||
nt|petergill: See you in about 30 minutes for the next match|pg||
nt|petergill: Website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: but the website does not have any results, so far|pg||
nt|petergill: You have to take into account that Malaysia has only about 100 bridge players, so results might take a little while to appear, with a small number of people doing a lot of work. |pg||

pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|petergill: 4@S is a good save, so perhaps the first approach is the better one? Or perhaps, South, with 6-4 shape being as good as a 7 card suit, should at fav vul overcall 3@S over 1@H, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: allowing North to take the 4@S save? |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h8|pc|hJ|mc|11|nt|petergill: 6-4 shape is as good as a 7 card suit, just as 7-4 shape is as good as an 8 card suit|pg||
