nt|twcho: actually 5@d makes if by north|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|kiwibridge: with 6@D hardly focussing on @S better to just bid them|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||

mb|d|nt|petergill: I might have rebid only 2@D, not liking my Jx in RHO's suit nor my bare ace, but I think most people would rebid 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: 3D must be a Limit raise or better Bergan raise |pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe anyway by +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@C a nice spot and on for 500 at wourst now|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@D has guaranteed that they will reach 6@D or 7@D|pg||

nt|vugraphzek: 1@H 10-14 may have long minor|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|petergill: 7@D, needing 4-3 @H's or short @HK, is a good spot if NS are silent, but not quite so good once NS have bid  |pg||

nt|offthebend: good thing that declarer has not shown a 7 card suit -- south still thinking |pg||
nt|offthebend: he can continue C and still beat it |pg||

nt|rodal f: Still an ok sac in 5@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|petergill: West knows East has less than 3 hearts, so unless North has 5 or 6 hearts (unlikely?), West has 4 top tricks to 41S|pg||
nt|petergill: to 4@S I mean|pg||
nt|offthebend: They can make 5S on S finesse and by playing D towards the J |pg||
nt|rodal f: By that long thinking if no screens W have problem to bid. |pg||
nt|rodal f: But can tey take the safe income?|pg||

nt|rodal f: If any like the BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php    = til B20|pg||

nt|petergill: I would have played @HK at Trick 2, in case partner's heart was singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: then switched to clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Good lead!|pg||
nt|petergill: I like it - go for the good 4 card suit ahead of the weak longer suit with no entries  - a very sensible thing to try, especially in a match in which your team is the underdog |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT should fail now - on a heart lead, the bold 3NT had some chance. |pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: N will bid and show the adwanced que in @S I hope|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Declarer might still come to 9 tricks if he plays a heart to the ten|pg||

mb|p|nt|offthebend: good stop - this should come to easy 8 tricks unless Heart suit is attacked |pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: E thinks that 4@D is strong, slam try. West just bid 4@D as not so strong|pg||
nt|petergill: If @d is trumps, before bidding 4NT, always check if 5@H response takes you past your last safe haven|pg||
nt|rodal f: UPS. THIS CAN COST|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: 1@D can also be controls if they use it for 0-2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||

nt|jjsb: with the @c situation this one seems to be an ok contract |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|petergill: anyway, West worked out that this is not a slam auction - else East would bid 4NT earlier - and thus had the commonsense to signoff with her poor hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: B24 also 3NT but S to lead a @S and 12 tricks for a push|pg||
nt|jjsb: and we will probably play 3nt no @h fit and around 25hp thougth here its not the best contract |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|offthebend: Lucky for North but Prime AK and Ace -- did not cooperate , very timid bidding |pg||

nt|rodal f: Right u are|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|petergill: 4 rounds of clubs, ruffing with @HQ, would be great defence, but alas S was dealt an attractive @S lead|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jjsb: plus i have the impression the defense has a clear idea of North distribution |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|petergill: If a top sapde was led at Trick 1, then a club switch to lock declarer out of dummy would be great defence|pg||

pc|sA|nt|petergill: one way to find that defence would be that if declarer has a 2nd @H, the defence has little chance|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Full press for nothing?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|petergill: more could be said about the defence of the last hand, but perhaps silence is appropriate  |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: with @SK onside, 6@s plays well, but I think 6@s is a touch less than 50% chance, thus should not be bid. But I'm not sure|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C was splinter|pg||
nt|petergill: some (not me) say not to splinter with bare king|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C artificial game try, playing Two Way Checkback|pg||
nt|offthebend: good and lucky part score bidding by NZ |pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|petergill: East, who did not open a 13-15 NT, decided he had a maximum, but 4@s should fail, with black kings offside and @DQ a useless asset|pg||

nt|jjsb: not easy...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as @H8765 is good enough for 3NT |pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: South might have bid 3@S (not 2@S) at fav vul versus ctrong club (perfect conditions for maximal preempting) as 6-4 (or 6-5) shape is as good as a 7 card suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr:(|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: B25 gave 1IMP for Indonesia.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|petergill: and in my opinion N should remove bidding space early by raising spades directly, but his silence might prove golden, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: and so it does!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit diferent style at OR and here. OR 2@S - 4@S. IMPs to Thailand|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 10 imp for Thailand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Sucked them in. |pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|jjsb: sensible lead .. that give that contract |pg||
nt|jjsb: funny that both line reach a contract that both suppose to be down and that after all they ended up making it ! :) |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: An interesting point for a partnership to agree on (in advance) - does 3@s allow South to bid 4@s over 4@H, or is the responder to the 2@S preempt in complete charge, with the 2@S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: preempter being a disciplined person who must pass 4@H? China clearly thinks the latter. |pg||
nt|petergill: I think East has bid his hand with 3@S and should Pass 4@S, not double it. Then West will bid 5@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B13 ended 4@H at OR as here|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|petergill: A coup by North gains 9 imps for the underdogs|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|petergill: Thanks to our excellent operator Chayes Luang-On for good work. |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s6|pc|hT|nt|petergill: Good smooth duck of @S10|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: Any telltale hesitation on @S10 would have been fatal for the defence|pg||
nt|petergill: Although 6@H makes, there's no advantage, looking at NS's 26 cards, from being in 6@H rather than 6@S, so that was unlucky for NZ |pg||
nt|petergill: A great start for Malaysia to beat one of the stronger teams in the event|pg||
nt|petergill: APBF event's website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round Start in 3o min|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Japan - China (Lady)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the defending champions Chinese Taipei are probably marginal favourites in the Open field, with China not at full strength.|pg||
nt|petergill: in the Women's, China are of course the favourites, though their team roster has changed a bit since their World Championship win|pg||
nt|petergill: See you in about 30 minutes for the next match|pg||
nt|petergill: Website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: but the website does not have any results, so far|pg||
nt|petergill: You have to take into account that Malaysia has only about 100 bridge players, so results might take a little while to appear, with a small number of people doing a lot of work. |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: B26 by same press as here, 4@H and N bidded 4@S as here.|pg||
nt|jjsb: ok see u all guys in 45 minutes !! thanks again ! |pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: and that's all today from Kuala Lumpur - there will be 3 more matches tomorrow |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S is a good save, so perhaps the first approach is the better one? Or perhaps, South, with 6-4 shape being as good as a 7 card suit, should at fav vul overcall 3@S over 1@H, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: allowing North to take the 4@S save? |pg||
mc|11|nt|rodal f: See u all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank You.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Director here|pg||
nt|jjsb: mmhhh |pg||
nt|jjsb: well 3 @h bid migth be the problem |pg||
nt|jjsb: i was about to point that aspect that normally if the defense bid a 2 suiters u cue the bid to say u cotnrol that suit |pg||
nt|jjsb: so im not sure if the explanation was same at both table |pg||
nt|jjsb: South migth point out if he know that there is no @h cotnrol he would have lead a @h ?|pg||
pg||
