mb|p|nt|andyv:  S's 6@d bid may have been asking for any other kings..unusual for the weak hand to take over a keycard auction|pg||
nt|jbgood: he had to bid 6@s to show it - perhaps S should just bid 7 knowing that prd has AK of clubs and all the key cards|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, if he/she knew that N had the K@c, then over 6@h, should have bid 6NT as the safer contract|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  North loves the @d9 return, makes it very easy for him|pg||
nt|paulg:  Jansma probably thinking he needs the spade finesse to work|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  also wondering where the small diamonds are|pg||
nt|oosb: OR @D 4-4 an @H 3-3 |pg||
nt|kastan88: and something happened there too, after 3 times trumps looked as -2 (previous), must be good result for NS, if teammates not going for 6 in red suit|pg||
