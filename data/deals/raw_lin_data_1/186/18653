nt|nickf: we will fix the names on this table soon (they are reversed)|pg||
nt|nickf: fixed now!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: everything splitting too easily for declarer  no mysterious lines required|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other partnerships Caplan plays Acol   not sure about here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gaspar-Chrapot stopped in 5@S!!|pg||
nt|nickf: EW prob a Polish club variant|pg||
nt|granguru: a nice hand, West's|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2011&dir=vcc&E=4&R=7&T=R|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  conservative view|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|3S|nt|kiwibridge: even with the @D lead he didn'y have 13 tricks|pg||
nt|nickf: NS EW may be playing MiniMeckwell|pg||
nt|granguru: dummy has just enough to ensure 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: I mean EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: EW play Fantunes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a good system :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@S min splinter|pg||
nt|nickf: likely to stop in 4@H making 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East has a trump entry and the vital @hJ - but hard to find out|pg||
nt|nickf: wrong again, seems a std system|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|kiwibridge: maybe not going for 12|pg||
pc|d9|nt|don jordan:  this is a good game but it goes down on the heart ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Klinger rebid 2@S   but that was over artifical game force 2@D|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yorkbeach:  play will be quick again|pg||
nt|granguru: the entry permits to win 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forced to guess immediately|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|granguru: 13?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: perhaps a wheel is off|pg||
nt|nickf: did West really bid 6@S or 6@H ?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|don jordan:  now she makes on careful play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is ok slam|pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru: @SA enter dummy keeping @D3|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|nickf: it would be unusual for this pair to have a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so Noble will be looking to score 4 VPs more than Klinger?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nickf: I wonder if West saw 2S and not 3S by East|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwibridge: unusal auction OR also with W responding 1N to the 1@D opening|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|don jordan:  the heart ruff is back|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can't see this making 6@H had good chances|pg||
nt|nickf: this hand all comes down to North ducking the 1st diamond smoothly|pg||
nt|nickf: this is a 10 round swiss|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: what |pg||
