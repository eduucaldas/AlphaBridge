mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  Tuff defence against 3 NT here, suppose West leads a @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: on their way to 3NT now|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|stc: N doesn't need to duck smoothly at trick one if dec plays small from dummy - he may take his time and play small, |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: he will play the 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: but i doubt he leads a @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you Hans?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S bid @hs..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh yes, after Stayman he woulÂ´nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: well N was always going to stayman!|pg||
nt|hedyg: and if he didnt W's @ss are nicer than his @hs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  So West has NO lead - but any minor works|pg||
nt|stc: common, EW have 5 open tricks and dec only 8|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|hedyg: for the moment he has only 7 tricks|pg||

nt|patricck: EW need to lead spades to stop 10 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|patricck: but NS probably won't bid that far|pg||
nt|patricck: weclome Constantin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: Hello Everybody. Players are ready. Let's go!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: Hello everybody. The players are seated. We are starting.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Tony |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: Players are ready.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Welcome back|pg||
nt|legend114: Hi|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: Players on their starting blocks. Ready to sprint.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: ..and a nice missfit to start us off|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|legend114: Hi everybody|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|daman: 3@C is a form of Bergen?|pg||
nt|patricck: bergen raise I presume|pg||
nt|stc: yes, inverted, the strong one|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Tom, welcome|pg||
nt|sybarra: from previous session,  we have seen E be very creative |pg||
mb|2C|nt|patricck: I think that should help East find the winning spade lead|pg||
nt|legend114: There is the danger here that NS reach an umakabe 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|stc: I expect 4@h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: after a slam (on a hook) on the last board before the break has set up a close finish|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|stc: I trump lead will give the contract|pg||
nt|patricck: Partner didn't want to double 3@C for the lead, so I would exclude that suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @s takes the bid away from E and also is a ht raise |pg||
mb|2N|nt|stc: now he can also make|pg||
nt|patricck: that will give the contract as well|pg||
nt|daman: the @H 5 could be an entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: I don't understand this play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, I am temporarly rooting for the NS pair, as I like close matches|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgu: Defence is on a good way for the 5 first tricks.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: welcome back to tom fenwich,  (aka legend)  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: hi tom|pg||
nt|legend114: Hi everybody again|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this lead gives south every chance|pg||
pc|c7|nt|patricck: While bergen can be useful it allows the person who won;t be on lead to send a message to partner by doubling or failing to double the bergen bid. In this case East paid ...|pg||
nt|patricck: insufficient attention to the negative inference|pg||
nt|stc: he gives defense a second chance|pg||
nt|legend114: the limit for both sides is 9 tricks, unless South can get a D ruff. Unlikely. |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: wher do you start?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: with diamonds?  or hearts|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|patricck: as well as letting them take a club ruff if the clubs had been 4-2|pg||
nt|stc: and they take it|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: not sure they have the timing for the ruff |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: So far so good for the declarer|pg||
nt|legend114: I believe he played correctly|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I was playing 3 nt perhaps I should get another cup of coffee|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I am not intending to be critical of wests choice|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|legend114: the double of 2C may have warned him off from 3NT but he did not take advantage of the warning|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..I was rooting for NS|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: they might now |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes no problem for these experienced players|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d7|nt|sybarra: or not|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just a wee think before cahing the ace..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: Claudio is expecting a bit more than just 1 off|pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: he just went down in a cold contract|pg||
nt|legend114: South might have bid 3D over 2NT, implying he had no Club stopper|pg||
pc|dA|nt|stc: A possible swing for Ribitas, 4@h is normal and not easy to beat|pg||
nt|patricck: it wouldn't have helped but declarer could have improved his chances when spades were 4-2 by ducking one round|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|stc: Accident in CR for the leaders|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: I like that pass!|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|stc: CR W made a free bid of 2@H|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  How many "values" are left by East after the 2 @D-overcall? Partner NOT supporting...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: he did raise in the CR!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Clever PASS by West here|pg||
nt|hedyg: disciplined|pg||

nt|sybarra: OT= over trick |pg||
mb|1H|nt|wilkinsona: or just 5 spades...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|patricck: I don't know about 4@H being normal on a combined 20 HCP, but they may well bid it in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 clubs? |pg||
mb|2H|nt|stc: Nor mal because the others play also Bergen - N knowing 9 - 11 points and fit will also bid 4|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|sybarra: looking at it more,  not sure it can ever be made |pg||
nt|legend114: Unlucky here not to make 6C with the 3-0 trump break. I have seen worse grand slams!!! |pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello|pg||
nt|henryb:  Tom!|pg||
nt|sybarra: you see Tom,   you mention Henry, and here he is!|pg||
nt|legend114: Hi Henry|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|patricck: 3@C on that bunch of queens and jacks?  surely not?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and its Q10x |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: point counter|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: anyway he pushed EW too high |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and fast arrival  should go all pass |pg||
nt|legend114: JJ Dousse must have been watching Caponi/Piedra to overcall 1S|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Is that standard Swiss? to evercall with the N hand and not to raise immediately with the S hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but e/w may not be finished |pg||
nt|sybarra: but they are |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: It should be 3 off. Let's see|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: should be|pg||
pc|s6|nt|stc: but not best lead....|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|legend114: I wonder if E-W's aggressive bidding did not keep N-S- out of a losing slam|pg||
pc|h4|nt|patricck: still too high as long as the defence steer clear of playing @D|pg||
nt|stc: hard to undestand this lead, my choice was between @c and trump|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if East thinking of taking 5 hearts, perhaps bid 3 spades instead of 4 hearts, to bring partner in|pg||
pc|hT|nt|legend114: There is no standard Swiss as far as I know. |pg||
nt|sybarra: q of hts trying for the illusion |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|hA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d4|nt|henryb:  So this will drift off one|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|patricck: yes, only Kxxx, which you imply with the double. Partner doesn't bid @S and then you lead them anyway|pg||
nt|stc: caponi will try to build a sqz|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: good queston |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: *question |pg||
pc|s3|nt|stc: S must discard @s|pg||
nt|daman: no squeeze here|pg||
nt|daman: psuedo squeeze only|pg||
nt|stc: sure not, but they must be careful in defense|pg||
nt|patricck: South could have the Q@D J@S and J@C, that would leave room for the A@D in North|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|stc: Note that S may have KJ of S, so well played by E|pg||
pc|c5|nt|stc: in this case they will be a true sqz|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|legend114: the only merit of 5H is that it might push NS to 5S, but if it doesn't, the cost of the effort is too high|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h2|nt|legend114: you'll agree, it's commendable (or inspired?) to bid only 2S when your partner overcalls vul.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|nt|stc: 4@s are possible in EW|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think E/W might make 4 @S here - allow me a question: Is 2 @S a weak-2?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: extraordinary bidding in CR!|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|stc: let's hope it's a two suiter|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: caro, tell us what was 2@s ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgv: two suiter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: EW can make 4@s - at least with open cards|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  If itÂ´s a weak 2, I have no comments...|pg||
nt|stc: guessing Ax@c is not a must :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if it is a 2-suiter - no comments, but 6-5 and a void?|pg||
nt|stc: so, you HAVE comments :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! if not agreed!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only such, which you can guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree with Ralf, i play multi with weak 2 suiters but IMO never good with a 6card major|pg||
nt|stc: If you open such a hand 2@s and serious ops stop in 3@h you must bid once more|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: and of course 6-5 is huge|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But this board was lost at the other table (also)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  If 2 NT is about 15-18, I would bid game with the South-hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|stc: not far from making +1 now |pg||
nt|hawe45:  The problem is, that NorthÂ´s @S-values are very bad = just as good as K J x - which is 3 HP less|pg||

nt|hedyg: i am not sure you would have a 4@H bid over a 20/21 2NT bid let alone 15-17. @s values is what you want least of all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Claim - 9 tricks, which both involved players should know|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cT|nt|stc: N makes 4 after the first 3 trciks if he begind with a @s ruff in dummy, the tempo he's missing now|pg||

nt|legend114: Jean Besse used to say, "chatter, chatter, it helps the opponents." That was 30 years ago! Times have changed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and since everyone bids on "air" these days.....|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|daman: all roads lead to 3NT on this one|pg||
nt|henryb:  Actually, I think it would be even better to bid 2@h the first time and get the opponents to the 3 level|pg||
mb|1N|nt|wilkinsona: yes, indeed (i couldn't have found that pass)|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  As far as I have seen, very few Scots can find the pass card in their bidding box :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I'm assuming 3N is a balanced raise, perhaps|pg||
mb|2H|nt|stc: 12 tricks if you stretch|pg||
mb|2S|nt|patricck: 6NT romps home if it is bid. Basically it is a 50% slam, just solely on the postioion of the K@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was going to ask the experts, do you want to play 3 nt or 4 @S, |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgu: Claudio knows his man|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: sorry I would be looking for 4 sp with the stiff ace of @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: and 4 tricks in @c|pg||
nt|stc: so not quite 50%|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, 3N has the advantage of 9 top tricks|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: and who said, if you can play and make 3 nt....  (hammond?)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: 11 no more nor less|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this has plenty tricks now|pg||
mb|d|nt|legend114: but 4S has 10 and a got shot for 11.|pg||
mb|p|nt|legend114: South missed a great opportunity to stay out of trouble but one can't really blame him|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: they will not bid any slam|pg||
nt|patricck: less than 50% I guess, but 4 tricks in clubs not that crucial, it needs the K@S and then either short K@S (so 4 spades) or J@C dropping (so 4 @C) or if they don't work then try the ...|pg||
nt|patricck: @D finesse|pg||
nt|daman: he lied about his opener to begin|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: he was never going to accept any invites|pg||
nt|daman: this was never a slam hand|pg||
nt|stc: he already upgraded his hand when opening 2NT|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but once South has stretched to a 2NT opener North might not have only invited|pg||
nt|stc: you never played slams at 45% ?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: just sort of pesky that spades are not 2/2 |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not easy to judge this hand, with 4 spades not far away|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure this is going to very challenging for declarer |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|stc: he will not be happy when this wins|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|patricck: that is of course a slight stretch as well, but we have all seen two way stretches before :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|d4|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|stc: the two way stretch was worth 6 IMPs, the card play ruined it|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|daman: they don't have the benefit of seeing all 4 hands like we do     we have to predict the evenual outcome as opposed to double dummy contracts|pg||

nt|daman: North should give a nudge with 4@D|pg||
nt|stc: is 3@d here enough ?|pg||
nt|daman: sure|pg||
nt|patricck: NS didn't stretch to the thin 4@H on board 1, so a quiet 6 imps there and then they bid 1NT without a @H stop on board 2 and failed by 4 tricks for -400 and 10 imps away|pg||
