nt|sybarra: looks like a multi auction |pg||
nt|mamos: South prefers 2@s to 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: mandatory 2 @H,  and here we go on interesting scramble |pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting it was a 7 card multi |pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: Welcome to 5th European Open Championships. "Open" meaning that entry is open to anybody with good standing in their  National Bridge Organization. |pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: straight from La Boheme morning|pg||
nt|peachy: All events transnational.  This is Round 5 of qualifying round robins in 15 groups of 6 teams each in the Mixed Teams.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgy: the current leader is Dror Padon - the winner of last year's competition|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ntmon: NS trying to steal the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: This is the last of 3 parts of this competition - following the pairs and teams that were played earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: In each event everyplayer gets up to 100 points - according to the posision|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good stop|pg||
nt|dburn: no one seems to want to do very much bidding at this table|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|granguru:  They use Polish leads that means low from a doubleton|pg||
nt|dburn: that's a relief - for a while I thought they were just arguing with each other|pg||
nt|dburn: whereas at the other, everyone was willing to do quite a lot|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|granguru:  and udca|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|xenya: however stopping in 3@H is enough for a 7-imp gain|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Yuval and PS|pg||
nt|yuval10: rehi all|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all Thx Roland )|pg||
nt|vugraphpl1: sorry.|pg||
nt|vugraphpl1: problem with hand's|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a decent slam|pg||
nt|dburn: not bid at the other table, so a chance for Neve|pg||
nt|jbgood: solid trump suit - only to ruff 2 @ds for 12|pg||
nt|dburn: not an easy chance, though - this is a perfect fit|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - def not easy to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3nt this time|pg||
nt|dburn: tough hand for East-West if North-Sout bid a lot of spades|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ntmon: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: first prize is 3000 Euro's|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos: Im going to keep quiet|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/indi.php|pg||
nt|ntmon: not bad|pg||
nt|psridhar: any Tax?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, more of a chance after this start than after 1NT, which was opened at the other table|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|dburn: even so, South will do very well to move in search of a slam|pg||
nt|peachy: 11 of South's 12 HCP in aces and kings, that alone should excite, despite bad shape|pg||
nt|xenya: i can't see S just bidding game at this point|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: but I guess they will not bid a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well not for long|pg||
nt|granguru:  no 5 contract with best defense|pg||
nt|dburn: and they judged pretty well to play in clubs, not hearts|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mamos: wb|pg||
nt|granguru:  that is @H lead !(hard)|pg||
nt|granguru:  no ..declarer discards on @D|pg||
nt|dburn: not good enough - West can throw his spade loser on a diamond if North leads a heart|pg||
nt|granguru:  yup|pg||
nt|granguru:  so iron contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: neither could she|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: wrong again|pg||
nt|granguru:  N had the idea...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: still, North will need to evaluate his hand well also|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: a game on pretty thin values here|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@d from N might have been more encouraging for S|pg||
mb|4N|nt|granguru:  didnt lead his entry suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: good news is it makes|pg||
nt|jbgood: well - he doesnt care|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ntmon: NS can take 8 tricks now |pg||
nt|xenya: now they are there|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: revert to @s now|pg||
nt|yuval10: list of the prizes you can see here:|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/eprizes.php|pg||
nt|peachy: It definitely helped to avoid 1NT opening with this|pg||
nt|jbgood: after 3@s he had made his mind up|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|mamos: yep apparently so :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: well played|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: as a kib points out - the noncue of @d from S was encouraging for N:)|pg||
nt|xenya: the play should be easy -- just 2 diamond ruffs in hand|pg||
nt|xenya: in dummy|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|ntmon: change |pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps on a spade lead, this actually needed 3-2 trumps|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|dburn: still, that's plenty good enough odds for a small slam|pg||

nt|stc: I like Indy, less science and more judgement :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3nt - or dare i say it|pg||
nt|mamos: How many of the 90 tables do you think will bid that Shirley?:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so far less brutal than last set,    |pg||
nt|mamos: game might not make this time|pg||
nt|granguru:  N thought probably on a minor 2-suited hand in dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - he would not expect his partner to have a singleton heart|pg||
nt|jbgood: this doesnt look good for Fantoni either|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: might be difficult to stay our of game here |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: *stay out|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ntmon: but you need to know the system anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: this looks like a stright-forward 4@h which probably makes 5|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. has to cash 3 first tricks out, if they succceed i predict they'll get a big reward and a close to top result|pg||
nt|psridhar: versatile game this Bridge-engages varied interests , since the game has many facets-science, judgment, analysis , psychology, etc|pg||
nt|xenya: great start for Neve -- and more to come here? |pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: are we under way with a grand slam|pg||
nt|garnetts: This looks like a bidding challenge hand 7NT a spread and nearly impossible to bid |pg||
nt|mamos: and for sure they'll bid it if they did the last one|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: maybe but 7c should be bid|pg||
nt|dburn: South might rely on a tried and trusted weapon at some point|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: that auction won't be duplicated at many tables|pg||
nt|dburn: straight out of Acol Road, West Hampstead, London, England|pg||
nt|peachy: the one they used last hand too :)|pg||
nt|dburn: that at least shows they trust it|pg||
mb|5D|nt|garnetts: some people will bid it vai 2NT-3NT |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5c better of course|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Victor Silverstone|pg||
nt|odysseus69: morning all|pg||
nt|jbgood: simple raise on a 5 card support - a bit conservative...|pg||
nt|dburn: still, now they can't try it|pg||
mb|5S|nt|yuval10: of course, small @c lead from N means 12 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: yes, not easy for N to play @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: this is IMPs right? OTs have less importance ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: no|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@d on 2N was transfer accordimng to cc|pg||
nt|yuval10: MP's i'm affraid|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe E forgot, so this sequence should be slam interest|pg||
nt|ntmon: MP for sure|pg||
nt|psridhar: but our scoreboard above says IMPs....|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, but it is MP|pg||
nt|stc: I don't think it may be Individual at IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/indi.php  look|pg||
nt|psyck: bbo cannot show scores with 1 mp table shown|pg||
mb|6D|nt|psridhar: so Matchpoints it is ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: noiw maybe 7h|pg||
nt|sybarra: may have staved off the @S lead |pg||
nt|dburn: and now they need to guess well|pg||
nt|jbgood: is 1@h canape?|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know - 6@d is a bit surprising anyway|pg||
nt|peachy: Dbl prob should deny diamond 1st round control|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess it's not impossible from South's point of view that East-West can actually make a slam of their own|pg||
nt|peachy: The 4H bid by S said it is "our hand"|pg||
mb|6S|nt|garnetts: 4@D by the passed hand would have got them there |pg||
nt|sybarra: but is that enough?|pg||
nt|mamos: well the defence will probaly have this and one more chance to get the defence right|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: now after W denied @s control|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good night|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: to 3nt i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: now to me that is an awful bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good hand for strong club- should have avoided 3NT but North rushed in|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes they in forcing situastion so why not 2nt|pg||
nt|mamos: needs Club return and Spade immediately  I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is obviuos|pg||
nt|sybarra: *obvious |pg||
nt|mamos: East can see the danger in the dummy|pg||
nt|mamos: I think Club is clear|pg||
nt|mamos: she knows she needs Spade from partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: perhaps it's easier for N to find the winning lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: a lot of MP's are in stake now|pg||
nt|psyck: the def will get it right, very costly for E to forget the cc|pg||
nt|jcomyn: playing precision whats the rush|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@H is virtually a nonsense bid unless he is gambling that they will lead the wrong thing |pg||
nt|dburn: still, that had better not be Lightner...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yuval10: very well done by N|pg||
nt|psyck: 2 pages should not be hard to remember :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcomyn: why not 3s and then 4d by s|pg||
nt|dburn: it wasn't|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|psridhar: i agree that this sequence by E is slammish in many conventions -but very few define it, in other words what is opener required to do ?|pg||
nt|peachy: I did not like the guess of 6S|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|granguru:  :)|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, Reese or Marx or Simon might have ducked that diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: then, East could eventually have been endplayed in the majors|pg||
nt|granguru:  @D9 asks for @H|pg||
nt|dburn: as it is, East can win a heart and exit with a diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: and declarer will eventually lose a spade|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|psyck: with fit and max hand, i suppose opener is to make a forward going bid or rkc|pg||
nt|granguru:  it was worthwhile for duckworth to duck|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|odysseus69: needs to decide to play for singleton club king with West or jack with East- he decided quicker than i could type|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont beat italians horsing around|pg||
nt|mamos: I only have a slight advantage over East of course |pg||
nt|jbgood: Fantoni in 5th pos after the first 2|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: but not any more|pg||
nt|peachy: only one ace, he cannot expect a passed partner to provide the missing controls|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psridhar: if responder is looking for fit, he has a balanced hand realtively? else he can trf and bid a 2nd suit-say 2-7-2-2 type ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: will KX,K109XXXX,XX,QX do?|pg||
nt|stc: Many players accept the transfer only with fit - it is a big advantage for such hands|pg||
nt|psridhar: i suggest you play it as = i dont need any fit ; i need a control rich hand -either pure all aces and kings in 20hcp OR some source of tricks like KQJXX in side suit with opener ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: with controls outside|pg||
nt|stc: the price is that you risk be too high |pg||
nt|psyck: that is an interesting & sensible treatment PS.  |pg||
nt|stc: do we have standings after first session ?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/indi.php|pg||
nt|psridhar: the logic is -thats the only value the responder cannot find out easily since 2N opg is space consuming|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|dburn: it didn't work out well, true - but if you exchange the black-suit threes, it would have been a winner|pg||

nt|yuval10: Covalu still leading, with Padon 2nd, in the overall standings|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: :) - just haven't seated yet...|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/total.php|pg||
nt|Walddk3: We would approve of 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk3: even from Alon|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what happened there|pg||
nt|odysseus69: presumably 3C from North would be forcing- then 3H from South and 3NT avoided|pg||
nt|granguru:  in the meanwhile ...defense gives a trick away|pg||
nt|dburn: and there really wasn't any rush to play that heart - where were any heart losers going?|pg||
nt|dburn: not dull, these boards - plenty of distribution all afternoon|pg||
nt|peachy: Running scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Poznan/Bulletins/bul01.pdf|pg||
nt|peachy: This is Group G|pg||
nt|peachy: Wrong link, results here http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: surely 3nt is one down|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: Diamond 7 at the other table 2 here  if that makes a difference  defender found Club switch for deserved swing|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: anyone likme to let us know who's playing and who sitting ew|pg||
nt|jbgood: or here: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrrunda5.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: East will hope to come in later with minors- may be a bit high when it gets back to him|pg||
nt|mamos: i presume thats a 15-17 NT  but still has a lot of tricks |pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: not everyone's choice of 1 nt,  but this will work |pg||
nt|jbgood: dbl? 3 @c? |pg||
nt|dburn: unless North raised to 2@s|pg||
nt|jbgood: hehe - agree|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe she passed and W bid 4H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: not 4@h, surely|pg||
mb|4H|nt|garnetts: bad 6@C contract possible --will boil down to getting the trumps right --and guessing the spades |pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know what happened on bd 13|pg||
nt|granguru:  looks like 3NT by South is the best spot here|pg||
nt|peachy: I would not Pass though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: I dont like 1nt on the s handf with very poor spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: Little choice I imagine systemically |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this is a bit daft when you dpont know who isd playing against whom|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: you can always bid 1D and catch up later|pg||
nt|jbgood: pass was out of the question - 2@s didnt give any valuable info for prd |pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: hard to reach 3NT after 4@d - not a good advertisement for the method|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: all yopu really want to do is play 3nt from N|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no but on 12 where declarer misplayed 2H and went down they made 9 tricks next door|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stc: the interesting point here will be the handling of zje trump suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: accurate bidding by Schwartz -his seq shows about what he has here|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He will lose a trick in hearts I predict|pg||
nt|yuval10: then maybe a ruff too|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe but an easier thing to do is reverse 1@S and 1NT |pg||
pc|sK|nt|stc: the %play is to finesse the 2nd round of @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he leads @d, and he does|pg||
nt|psyck: on @d lead, dec may ignore restricted choice|pg||
nt|stc: he better does :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: we can see an easy 7 tricks |pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT could so easily be on |pg||
nt|sybarra: and where 7 often 8|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|garnetts: well they got to it --now it will come down to guesswork |pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will take some guessing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: its the hand with 4D and CK off 3nt|pg||
pc|hT|nt|stc: safety plays at MP are not a must|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|odysseus69: never cover an honour with an honour - i think thats the rule|pg||
nt|dburn: if instead North had doubled West's weak 2@h for takeout, the penalty might set some kind of record for this event|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psridhar: at IMPs he doesnt mind losing a trump trick to W , so when E drops honor he can play 2nd top card...but this is MPs..|pg||

nt|garnetts:  --rotten contract |pg||
nt|jcomyn: three mighty big hands in a row|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought declarer had seven tricks and then claimed nine|pg||
nt|dburn: miserable position for Neve - if partner doesn't have @cK she can't beat 4@h, and if he does they can't beat 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, N supported spades immediately -- a key move |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|garnetts: another making slam--this is also poor though|pg||
nt|mamos: still Shirley was right 1NT worked well|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but just the 3nt this time|pg||
nt|dburn: the objective for the teams here is to finish in the top three of their group of six|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: needs 3-3 hearts in practice |pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if his target was only 10 he might hv drawn trumps |pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: this could lead to trouible|pg||
nt|dburn: Penfold is currently leading, Duck N Dales are fourth|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|jcomyn: but if they are playing precision why 1h|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure where I want to play this hand looking at all 4 |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: at least low enough|pg||
nt|mamos: In England a double on the South hand would be regarded as a poor bid   -- different countries have different styles and understandings|pg||
nt|dburn: this is Callaghan's patent method for responding to 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: Souths double after a strong club opening looks ill judged|pg||
nt|jcomyn: NT is ok but that X by s is not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|sybarra: countries, systems, partnerships, style etc |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: looks like 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|psridhar: a good lesson on moysian fits -good trumps|pg||
nt|stc: better than 3NT+2|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a very good score in an MP field|pg||
nt|psridhar: short trump hand haviing ruffing potential|pg||
nt|stc: and who plays 6@c  ?|pg||
nt|psyck: true, S did well to bid 4@s instead of 3N|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: they're learnikng|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: hooray - italians|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcomyn: dont like 4-2 fits when i have a 5-4 fit, but then that suits doesnt exist any more|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks a strange lead|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|garnetts: likely playing two systems according to position or vulnerability |pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: odd though|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: a wish trick |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: 2345 |pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: 2@c forces 2@d, to be followed by various things|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: poor S,  nothing sits right|pg||
nt|dburn: usually by our side rather than the opponents, of course|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk3: Goodbye to the 12th trick|pg||
nt|psyck: oh well, thought ruffing @h would have been normal|pg||
nt|stc: don't understand his play|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He can no longer ruff a heart and get back to hand to draw|pg||
nt|stc: after droping the Q@c he sees 11 NT tricks, so he needs 12 in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: may be plannig to play for @s33 then|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe he will play for spades 3-3 now|pg||
nt|Walddk3: diamond to ace, ruff a heart and overtake @SQ|pg||
nt|yuval10: he should, as he knows he's in a bad score already|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He really should with this format|pg||
nt|stc: making things much worse|pg||
nt|stc: 1 trick worse :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: The current standing after 10 (out of 19) rounds:  1st: Dror Padon,  2nd: Sergiu Covaliu|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He erred at trick 3 by not ruffing a heart|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|d3|nt|Walddk3: Playing for clubs 3-1 instead with singleton in West|pg||
nt|stc: hoping W plays H|pg||
nt|Walddk3: If they don't one, they don't have one|pg||
nt|Walddk3: says Garozzo|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this time covering was a better idea|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk3: don't lead one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bedt italians in grand in open room on bd 1|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps lucky South  |pg||
pc|cT|pc|d8|nt|psridhar: if @c are 3-1 he can see 3N fares poorly so taking even 10 triks is ok -so shd hv catered to 2-2|pg||

mb|1H|nt|mamos: EW got in a mess on that last board in th OR 3@S -3|pg||
nt|dburn: East-West have the generally accepted values for game, but the play is uphill work|pg||
mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: board 13 scored as 3NT making here - did look like 1 down|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW will probably play a number of @H here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|garnetts: looks like a transfer overcall |pg||
nt|jcomyn: assume that transfer|pg||

nt|mamos: don't you mix @C2  with the Spades?|pg||

nt|vugraphpl1: )|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, this bidding might get North-South a little high|pg||
nt|granguru:  declarer must guess @H for losing just one trick in the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Birman worth 3@C now|pg||
nt|yuval10: kind of surprised there was no X from South over 1@s|pg||
nt|dburn: not impossible that South will bid 5@d at this point|pg||
mb|5D|nt|psyck: will certainly go on at this vul|pg||
nt|odysseus69: bad decisions all round|pg||
nt|dburn: still, South knows not to trust North's overcalls very far|pg||
nt|dburn: but it may be hard for her not to bid 4@s as a save if the opponents bid 4@h confidently|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: unless i curse him|pg||
nt|stc: needs Axx to X 1@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: AXX @h ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: passing 2@s with that 2 suitor -he will know it will go all pass as pd is marked with 4card @s|pg||
nt|stc: support X for @H|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@D lokks like a FIT NO-JUMP support|pg||

nt|peachy: If you'd like to watch both tables (or multiple ones) click http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: there is no support X here|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he wants to support he does that with 2 @h or a cuebid|pg||
nt|psyck: x just shows honor i suppose|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not 3d by s|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@d is just a cue bid - East bid diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: since partner showed 5 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: Nunes probably judged that oppo would "save"|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|stc: in this üposition and vuln you may have only 4|pg||

nt|jcomyn: thats the 2nd time he waited fo a x and didnt get it|pg||
nt|dburn: the auction developed along similar lines at the other table|pg||
nt|dburn: but East decided that perhaps 4@h would not make after all|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: who wins here |pg||

nt|sybarra: not easy hands |pg||

mb|1N|nt|garnetts: But the method needs testing |pg||

nt|odysseus69: 5D looks comfortable spot-just need to get there|pg||
nt|mamos: NS have values but no real fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: not as brutal as last set but still not easy |pg||
nt|mamos: I think you have to pass   you have a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and what do you have to say?|pg||
nt|sybarra: that @D suit is puny|pg||
nt|sybarra: and lefty opened it|pg||
nt|dburn: and potential trouble ahead for East-West|pg||
nt|dburn: if after 2@s-pass-4@s East decides to do some more bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: and not bid 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: your 4 card spade suit has nothing to write home abourt |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: no way|pg||
nt|odysseus69: tempo forces 5D and end|pg||

nt|mamos: ugh|pg||
nt|dburn: good decision, though 5@d might have escaped relatively unscathed|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: was there something wrong with passing 2 @C?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yuval10: South took a decision to go for a game even though he didn't have the @d support|pg||
nt|psridhar: but he has compensating values alright outside|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, nice should to good extras outside|pg||
nt|jcomyn: better lead a c though against h|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: strange|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: interesting question if e bids 3nt what will s lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yuval10: looks like only 3 @d losers and an easy made. |pg||
nt|sybarra: frankly halfway surprised they are not in 3 nt|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: Far be it for me to criticise but that double is dreadful --obviously an action double--but they could play 3@S doubled with 6@D a spread |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: well I think passing 3@h shows you should have passed 2@c   - it's a real double-cross to bid on and then stop|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|h2|nt|dburn: East can be squeezed in hearts and clubs for an overtrick|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psridhar: defense did well cashing their 3 @d tricks-there was some danger of one @d gettiing pitched from dummy|pg||
nt|stc: a @c lead could have been more efective|pg||
pc|dT|nt|garnetts: As it is a slam needs a 3-2 heart break only |pg||

pc|c6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s6|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|odysseus69: since no Fantoni-Nunes it does look as if Balint is the sponsor |pg||
nt|dburn: no wonder the Lavazza team is doing well - not only does it have a coach, it also has seven players|pg||
nt|jbgood: as far as I am told 27 teams from the A-Swiss go on to the KO rounds, and 5 from B|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru:  4@H but not 4@s|pg||
nt|dburn: true - how will 5@d get on?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|garnetts: I  ssume 1@H is a transfer too |pg||
nt|granguru:  Paradoxically 6@S can be made with @DA lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  an interesting hand indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|psyck:  6@c only -3 :)|pg||
nt|mamos: as usual  a stretched NT|pg||
nt|granguru:  that will define the match winner|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks to be par, in fact|pg||
nt|granguru:  6@D makes with a non @S lead|pg||
nt|dburn: since 6@d is down one doubled, and 5@h would have made|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I wonder what their range is |pg||
mb|3C|nt|jcomyn: bit of a skite this|pg||
nt|odysseus69: just been informed that I am commentating on mixed teams- was drafted in with no info|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Running scores at  http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrrunda2.html|pg||
nt|mamos: 15-17 I'd imagine   Standard French|pg||
nt|mamos: nine tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: the KCB response of 6@C by E shows odd no of keys and a useful void-needed for slam here|pg||
nt|psridhar: else Lazar thinks 2 keys are missing|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, many play 5N as even with void & 6x as odd with void|pg||
nt|granguru:  the importance of showing valuable voids in RKCB is ofoveerwhelming importance|pg||
nt|psridhar: now E has to 'punt' 6@H|pg||
nt|stc: I don't see any reason not to lead @d against 6@h|pg||
nt|psridhar: kind of bid that will invite more criticism when it fails than accolade when it wins( oh u got lucky! )|pg||
mb|3D|nt|granguru:  if W would have shown a 2 suited with 2N then W probably would have played 6@D instead of 6@H by E|pg||
nt|psyck: I E was going to bid on 5@h, he may have tried 6@d |pg||
nt|psyck: *If E|pg||
nt|psridhar: the two suits lack parity acutely ..so perhaps E decided to hide it|pg||
nt|granguru:  MP bidding strategy makes these little bidding distortions|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Good guess by South --might have had no play and might well go off still if east ducks the heart |pg||
nt|granguru:  guessing @D of course|pg||
nt|dburn: so a lot of IMPs rest on Brian's lead to this trick|pg||
nt|dburn: and that one won't work|pg||
nt|granguru:  ADRENALINE FLOWING NOW|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|odysseus69: killing lead - triumph for 2H opener|pg||
nt|dburn: Ivanov will know that North has a void in diamonds, surely|pg||
nt|granguru:  BEST LINE?|pg||
nt|granguru:  bidding is clear in that sense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: wow !|pg||
nt|granguru:  defense must manage not to clash @s tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: he won't have a losing diamond and two losing clubs for 5@d, and with 1-1 in the minors he would bid Blackwood, not 5@d|pg||
nt|xenya: undo pls|pg||
nt|peachy: The auction seems to indicate 3C was Puppet Stayman, guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Lazar might hv tried a forcing pass here ...in the context of his 5@H it only says he doesnt have @c values ( but hand still belongs to EW)|pg||
nt|garnetts: technicall as a kib has said only a club kills it --but this lead makes it hard |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||

pc|h7|nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h8|nt|psridhar: lot better than -1370|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psridhar: difficult hand for both NS and EW , and difficult for commentators too to predict scores here:)|pg||
nt|psyck: Birman may have recovered some in this round of what he lost in prior round|pg||
nt|stc: I think that -500 is about average|pg||
nt|psyck: the scores are at: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/total.php|pg||

nt|dburn: strong club, weak 2@h, game-forcing 3@d, competitive double|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psridhar: may end in 3@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 5D is all Nunes can do|pg||
nt|mamos: yep thanks op|pg||
nt|dburn: or something else, and some luck|pg||
