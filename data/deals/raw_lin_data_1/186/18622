nt|rodal f: Over for cross ruffs?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By @H as the start|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: The bidding and play (@CK unblock = doubleton) indicate that clubs are 7-2. Thus declarer expects some bad breaks in other suits. |pg||

pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|petergill: A good general principle is: never overruff with ace from Axx or Axx in trumps, usually ok to overruff with bare ace or Ax in trumps. |pg||

nt|petergill: 3@SX is worth only 500, not 800, for NS|pg||

nt|rodal f: So 15-17NT for NS and a easy push|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: In Round 1, Board 16 contributed to some upset results, with a good slam bid by the good teams failing due to a bad break|pg||
nt|petergill: At some point, perhaps on the 2nd round of @d's, I expect her to hook @DK and make 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking . .  .|pg||
nt|petergill: though there is a big worry that at the unfav vulnerability, West may have @DKx or bare @D king|pg||
nt|petergill: but Japanese women tend not to worry all that much about vulnerability and bid 3@S anyway, no on 2nd thought, Japanese players are very disciplined in the bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: surely Sun Ming knows this EW better than I do|pg||
nt|petergill: East is a well-known fairly famous player, but I don't know much about West|pg||

nt|petergill: Good deduction by South about the reason for East's clever play|pg||

nt|kerasidis: of course...but there are some many difficulties yet to deal with|pg||
nt|rodal f: Cheep or cheap. I love the speciality made by cheep's:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: so I think the odds massively favour a penalty dbl of 4@s on the West cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like the BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php    = til B20|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: Do they play with screens?|pg||

pc|d7|nt|petergill: so I was unfair to South - her line of play is perhaps best|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have played @HK at Trick 2, in case partner's heart was singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: then switched to clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: The low heart play shows that they have 100% faith in partner's count card at Trick 1|pg||
nt|jjsb: but of course not saying its bad !!! of course it can be more than helpfull in a lot of situation |pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Good lead!|pg||
nt|petergill: I like it - go for the good 4 card suit ahead of the weak longer suit with no entries  - a very sensible thing to try, especially in a match in which your team is the underdog |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT should fail now - on a heart lead, the bold 3NT had some chance. |pg||

mb|p|nt|offthebend: good stop - this should come to easy 8 tricks unless Heart suit is attacked |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: E thinks that 4@D is strong, slam try. West just bid 4@D as not so strong|pg||
nt|petergill: If @d is trumps, before bidding 4NT, always check if 5@H response takes you past your last safe haven|pg||

nt|jjsb: with the @c situation this one seems to be an ok contract |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: anyway, West worked out that this is not a slam auction - else East would bid 4NT earlier - and thus had the commonsense to signoff with her poor hand|pg||

pc|hA|nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
pc|h3|nt|twcho: so NE are screenmates|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: Perhaps declarer should set up the side suit first, which is usually a good policy?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|twcho: just one down and an excellent result for EW|pg||

pc|d3|nt|petergill: she seems to have 7 tricks even if she loses trump control|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|petergill: the 590 will be just 5 imps to Fr Poly, with @DA the (unapproved, in my opinion) opening lead to 4@s undoubled at the other table|pg||

nt|rodal f: OK. Let them find it and take 1 IMP. 4 @H make risk as I feel it.|pg||
nt|jjsb: i would have double maybe showing some cards a good 3@h bid |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was the deal with ure mate. Cards or hart:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|twcho: as long as east dare to introduce his @s suit, it is very difficult for NS to buy the contract|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: the undertricks are only 50's, so no big loss compared to 2@S making|pg||

nt|twcho: 390 is 9 imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He should perhaps have thought before he bid 4@S. Partner heard 3@H and yet he passed over 4@D. How can 4@S be right?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Right u are|pg||

pc|d7|nt|petergill: 4 rounds of clubs, ruffing with @HQ, would be great defence, but alas S was dealt an attractive @S lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jjsb: plus i have the impression the defense has a clear idea of North distribution |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: If a top sapde was led at Trick 1, then a club switch to lock declarer out of dummy would be great defence|pg||

nt|rodal f: B23 ended = ups. And 6IMP for China|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: one way to find that defence would be that if declarer has a 2nd @H, the defence has little chance|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|twcho: good guess by north|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h8|pc|c2|pc|d9|pg||

nt|rodal f: U as me would have done the same at team.|pg||

pc|d6|nt|offthebend: 1S down 5 -- doesn't look very appetising to team mates :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|mc|10|nt|petergill: but it requires a (quite possible, not double dummy at all) top spade at Trick 1 to have a look at dummy|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|petergill: with @SK onside, 6@s plays well, but I think 6@s is a touch less than 50% chance, thus should not be bid. But I'm not sure|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Patrick Huang did well to find the heart ruff needed to beat 6@C at the other table|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ths for inviting me Chayes. Been nice together with u nice specs:)|pg||
nt|jjsb: to reach 3nt that is |pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: can we considere that any of the EW player got a clear stopper? |pg||
nt|jjsb: not easy...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as @H8765 is good enough for 3NT |pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: South might have bid 3@S (not 2@S) at fav vul versus ctrong club (perfect conditions for maximal preempting) as 6-4 (or 6-5) shape is as good as a 7 card suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr:(|pg||
nt|twcho: this bd is more challenging for declarer|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|rodal f: B25 gave 1IMP for Indonesia.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|petergill: and in my opinion N should remove bidding space early by raising spades directly, but his silence might prove golden, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: and so it does!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit diferent style at OR and here. OR 2@S - 4@S. IMPs to Thailand|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 10 imp for Thailand :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: Sucked them in. |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jjsb: sensible lead .. that give that contract |pg||
nt|jjsb: funny that both line reach a contract that both suppose to be down and that after all they ended up making it ! :) |pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: An interesting point for a partnership to agree on (in advance) - does 3@s allow South to bid 4@s over 4@H, or is the responder to the 2@S preempt in complete charge, with the 2@S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: preempter being a disciplined person who must pass 4@H? China clearly thinks the latter. |pg||
nt|petergill: I think East has bid his hand with 3@S and should Pass 4@S, not double it. Then West will bid 5@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B13 ended 4@H at OR as here|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|twcho: so defense has gone wild|pg||
nt|twcho: if north goes up with the ace, south's @s will be established before west @c|pg||
nt|twcho: and there is no way for him to gather 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|petergill: A coup by North gains 9 imps for the underdogs|pg||
pc|d4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|twcho: but declarer was also wrong in covering @cJ with @cK|pg||
nt|twcho: but if south refuse to go up with his @c honor and north win the 1st @c with ace, defense willl prevail|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|petergill: Thanks to our excellent operator Chayes Luang-On for good work. |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzek: Thank You|pg||
nt|kerasidis: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|twcho: so all the errors add up to a tie bd|pg||
nt|twcho: tks all for watching|pg||
nt|twcho: actually declarer can win the battle by ducking the 1st @s|pg||
nt|twcho: then he will be able to establish his @c before defenders establishing the @s|pg||
nt|twcho: quite an intriguing hand|pg||
nt|twcho: bye now|pg||
