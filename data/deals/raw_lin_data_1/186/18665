nt|ballebodk: nice pas from N - he has 5-5 in unbid and 15 hp - but know so the the opps will by thw contract so way tell them how the sits are !|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Do you have a method for that, Tom?|pg||
nt|dburn: Sout might find out about @cAK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pray tell if you have|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ballebodk: nope - i think you have to play some precision relysystem |pg||
nt|dburn: well, she will find out about them later rather than sooner|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Yes, Grøtheim-Tundal and Bertheau-Nyström would perhaps be able to diagnose @CJ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not impressed with this auction|pg||
nt|dburn: better for South to be asking the questions on this deal, oddly enough|pg||
nt|ballebodk: i think this show why "ad hoc" partnerships have their limitation in bidding - you dont have time to come all around in the system|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Clubs must come in, a spade guess and no ruff|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||

pc|s7|nt|dburn: nobody did, but 3NT looks preferable to 4@h, though the latter would be rather unlucky to go down|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to another Peter, Goodman from Wales|pg||
nt|pelu: Its Tyrkey against a real international team with players from USA, Germany, Sweden and Netherland|pg||
nt|petepunt: morning all|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|brotherp: seems like 4@h made needs some defensive cooperation|pg||
nt|brotherp: which they got in the open room|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the 4 hearts played elsewhere does not look that attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: no|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a decent slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: For results: http://tinyurl.com/44xdakb   this one shorter?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 5 diamonds seems ok|pg||
nt|brotherp: 5@d really in the picture now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a big swing in B3: in OR Fredin-Michielsen stopped in 4@H with 13 tricks from top in 7NT - the problem: a 2@C opening - also calles the "slam-killer" :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|brotherp: well a @c lead would sink 5@d ...and North might have started with @c Ace |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yes, as spec says ...|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @D was the contract to be in but paulissens pass is understandable|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and another spec points out the attractions of 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D goes down also on 3@C |pg||
nt|brotherp: in the end the 4@H contract in the open room was made because North continued spades when in with the @hA|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C disappearing on @D|pg||
nt|brotherp: with South holding 3@d's that was just enough|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough 3rd bid for North,  but 2@H looks better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, East's name is spelt  Kuzselka|pg||
nt|pelu: there are 12 tricks - but only with @hs 3-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6nt likely|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4NT feels the right spot though|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: can be made on a minor suit squeeze i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5nt pick a slam probably|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D easier|pg||
nt|roswolf: might bid a grand i suppose|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: 7@D CAN be made by the backward finesse in trumps which pins the 10 +9|pg||
nt|roswolf: hardly likely though unless south shows his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be a long think|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is and understandable :)|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||

nt|petepunt: this has been a good come back by fredins team here|pg||
nt|pelu: a biddinbg misunderstand - and unlucky lead chanced 650 to 1090|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is a bits and pieces hand|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|brotherp: precision 1@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brotherp: asking 2@c|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bobholl: spades a bit unpretty|pg||
nt|pelu: the key-pælay in 4@s in OR was in trick 3 - after 2x@S N played @h7 - and @HK from East - all over|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: the rebidable singleton..|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brotherp: not so easy to lead @d's now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: now west was -2 elsewhere, how can East do?|pg||
nt|bobholl: e has shown 4414 or 4405 so easy :)|pg||
nt|brotherp: and another lead seems to let the contract through|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: ..and this seems to...|pg||
nt|brotherp: still West passes 3NT knowing the shortness; so club lead looks attractive|pg||
nt|pelu: for me 4@D is not bridge red against green and opp stop in 3@s|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|bobholl: 4@H 2@C 3@S may be |pg||
nt|brotherp: small spade or small club both seem attractive|pg||

nt|dburn: why is it "not bridge" to try for plus 130 instead of minus 140?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|bobholl: small @D ?|pg||
nt|brotherp: think so; in the bidding and play East's 4441 is known so...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well south knows his partner has 4 diamonds...|pg||
nt|brotherp: still a lot off guessing to be done by van Prooijen|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: perhaps the diamond 9...|pg||

pc|d5|pc|s2|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ballebodk: right in D - then: 1 sp, 3 h, 3 d, and 1 c = 8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: maybe, but North is allowed to shift to spades - if he continues hearts, though...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think women are East and South always. It's an EBL rule, not sure why it must be like that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no logic to it in my view|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let them sit where they want for goodness sake|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - North isn't allowed to shift to anything|pg||
nt|dburn: so South needs to play a spade, and that may need to be specifically the ten|pg||
nt|ballebodk: if s should shift to spade, N's better be very good ;0)|pg||
nt|dburn: though in practice West is not likely to guess diamonds even so|pg||
nt|dburn: there came 12 more IMPs to Istanbul when 4@h failed at the other table on board 7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn: good switch - wasn't the ten, but West didn't see a need to play the jack to block the suit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: so this is down now whatever happens|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dburn: and may very well be down two|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c4|pc|d7|nt|ballebodk: still - a very nice shift from S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 90 teams taking part in the mixed teams, so it takes a while to get them seated|pg||
mc|6|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all and bye for now|pg||
nt|dburn: would take even longer if they had to decide for themselves whether to be North or East|pg||
