mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 NT easy to play, difficult to bid|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Maybe 7 @H then|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@C natural, positive by Misha Solar from Sydney - a promising start to the auction|pg||

nt|mamos: this will need a fairly inspired guess|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: 7@H is not a great contract, needing hearts 3-2 on a @D lead. 7NT is excellent, needing clubs not 5-1 or spade hook or squeeze.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Two round of @H, A-K of @C abd a @S-ruff seems right|pg||
