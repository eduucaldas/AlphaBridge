mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|petergill: Patrick Huang did well to find the heart ruff needed to beat 6@C at the other table|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|petergill: South might have bid 3@S (not 2@S) at fav vul versus ctrong club (perfect conditions for maximal preempting) as 6-4 (or 6-5) shape is as good as a 7 card suit|pg||

nt|petergill: preempter being a disciplined person who must pass 4@H? China clearly thinks the latter. |pg||
