nt|patricck: EW need to lead spades to stop 10 tricks in @H|pg||

nt|legend114: Hi everybody|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|daman: 3@C is a form of Bergen?|pg||
nt|patricck: bergen raise I presume|pg||
nt|stc: yes, inverted, the strong one|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Tom, welcome|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|patricck: I think that should help East find the winning spade lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|stc: I expect 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|stc: I trump lead will give the contract|pg||
nt|patricck: Partner didn't want to double 3@C for the lead, so I would exclude that suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @s takes the bid away from E and also is a ht raise |pg||
mb|3H|nt|stc: now he can also make|pg||
nt|patricck: that will give the contract as well|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|patricck: While bergen can be useful it allows the person who won;t be on lead to send a message to partner by doubling or failing to double the bergen bid. In this case East paid ...|pg||
nt|patricck: insufficient attention to the negative inference|pg||
nt|stc: he gives defense a second chance|pg||
nt|legend114: the limit for both sides is 9 tricks, unless South can get a D ruff. Unlikely. |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|patricck: as well as letting them take a club ruff if the clubs had been 4-2|pg||

nt|sybarra: not sure they have the timing for the ruff |pg||

nt|daman: he just went down in a cold contract|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stc: A possible swing for Ribitas, 4@h is normal and not easy to beat|pg||
nt|patricck: it wouldn't have helped but declarer could have improved his chances when spades were 4-2 by ducking one round|pg||

mb|r|mb|3D|nt|roswolf: n/s in the other room were helped by the opps bidding to reach 5@C -here it may be more difficult|pg||
nt|patricck: hard to imagine what West hoped to achive by doubling|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|hedyg: XX= either 3 card fit in @H or a strong hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus the 4@H bid here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: I don't know about 4@H being normal on a combined 20 HCP, but they may well bid it in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 clubs? |pg||
mb|1D|nt|stc: Nor mal because the others play also Bergen - N knowing 9 - 11 points and fit will also bid 4|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|nt|sybarra: looking at it more,  not sure it can ever be made |pg||
nt|legend114: Unlucky here not to make 6C with the 3-0 trump break. I have seen worse grand slams!!! |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|patricck: 3@C on that bunch of queens and jacks?  surely not?|pg||

nt|legend114: Jean Besse used to say, "chatter, chatter, it helps the opponents." That was 30 years ago! Times have changed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and since everyone bids on "air" these days.....|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|daman: all roads lead to 3NT on this one|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|stc: 12 tricks if you stretch|pg||
mb|2S|nt|patricck: 6NT romps home if it is bid. Basically it is a 50% slam, just solely on the postioion of the K@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: and 4 tricks in @c|pg||
nt|stc: so not quite 50%|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|daman: they will not bid any slam|pg||
nt|patricck: less than 50% I guess, but 4 tricks in clubs not that crucial, it needs the K@S and then either short K@S (so 4 spades) or J@C dropping (so 4 @C) or if they don't work then try the ...|pg||
nt|patricck: @D finesse|pg||
nt|daman: he lied about his opener to begin|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|daman: he was never going to accept any invites|pg||
nt|daman: this was never a slam hand|pg||
nt|stc: he already upgraded his hand when opening 2NT|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but once South has stretched to a 2NT opener North might not have only invited|pg||
nt|stc: you never played slams at 45% ?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|patricck: that is of course a slight stretch as well, but we have all seen two way stretches before :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|stc: the two way stretch was worth 6 IMPs, the card play ruined it|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|daman: North should give a nudge with 4@D|pg||
nt|stc: is 3@d here enough ?|pg||
nt|daman: sure|pg||
nt|patricck: NS didn't stretch to the thin 4@H on board 1, so a quiet 6 imps there and then they bid 1NT without a @H stop on board 2 and failed by 4 tricks for -400 and 10 imps away|pg||
