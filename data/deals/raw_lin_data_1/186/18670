mb|2H|nt|twcho: now south has a great fitting hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|twcho: not sure whether 3@d is forcing or not but anyway south won't pass|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@d is quite an underbid is not forcing|pg||
nt|twcho: if not forcing|pg||
nt|by: 1@d-2@c-3@d should show extras|pg||
nt|twcho: is 2@h set up a gGF already?|pg||
nt|by: i think that it is hard to bid a slam if you can't show good hand good support|pg||
nt|twcho: if so, 3@d is still OK because it pinpoints the longer minor|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|by: ok, so i think they would make it to slam now|pg||
mb|5D|nt|twcho: still a guess work|pg||

nt|petergill: North thought they could be off @CAK. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: see you by and by|pg||
nt|twcho: probably it is better for north to bid 2S intead of 3D after 2H|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@d serves no purpose really|pg||
nt|petergill: South might have thought that a bid of 5@C over 4@H was dangerous, as perhaps his 2@H bid earlier might be taken as @C instead of @d support. |pg||

pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|twcho: what is the best way to tackle @h in order to get 3 tricks?|pg||
nt|petergill: If there's a trump switch, I don't think the timing is right for a double squeeze |pg||
nt|twcho: sorry, contract is 5C|pg||
nt|twcho: so he need 4 tricks in @h|pg||
nt|petergill: The best way (looking at 26 cards) most definitely is NOT to run the seven of @H!|pg||
nt|petergill: unless you want to be in trouble for looking at the hand records or looking at opponent's hands|pg||
nt|by: rehello all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcomeback|pg||
nt|twcho: rehi|pg||
nt|petergill: If @D back, then no squeeze possible|pg||
nt|by: without a diamond back now there will be a double squeeze?|pg||
nt|petergill: but @D back is wrong if South has Axx, K54, x, AKxxxx, due to loser-on-loser discard at Trick 2|pg||
nt|by: I am wondering if two spade plays will open W to a trump squeeze ...|pg||
nt|brgpro: even @s back...i think no squeeze...|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, the dbl squeeze looks possible, with South'|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: South's long spade being the threat to both E and W|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brgpro: now there is chance|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|twcho: so chance for declarer now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brgpro: @d or @s back both beat this|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|brgpro: sorry, cant say beat...someone wants to run the @h7|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, 2 rounds of @s will remove the double threat|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|brgpro: right peter?:)|pg||
nt|petergill: @SJ switch costs only if South has Q8x, Kx, x, AKxxxx, x - I think|pg||
nt|by: you reversed the minors peter :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I gave South five suits, as I usually do :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I meant with 7 clubs|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|twcho: the squeeze will play out automatically|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brgpro: now play @hK and @hA even works...as long as the @s are in both hands|pg||

nt|twcho: no way to get back to hand now|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: Trick 10: West has to keep @DK so must pitch a spade, then dummy pitches the now useless @DQ and East is squeezed in @H and @S|pg||
nt|twcho: dow|pg||
nt|twcho: down|pg||
nt|brgpro: what?|pg||

nt|twcho: not a really difficult hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: which was impossible as East was marked with @HQ when the @H finesse won|pg||
nt|brgpro: the ending he played was the same as if opps returned a @s after @dA then another @s after @cA|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: if only he'd run the 7@H|pg||
nt|petergill: A missed opportunity|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|by: i think this asks aprtner to gamble 3N :)|pg||

mb|4S|nt|petergill: Bd 11: 5th trump, prime cards in long suits (ace of spades is good opposite possible singleton), good shape, might make 4@h opposite Jx, Axxx, xxxx, xxx) - there's a case for 4@H. ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: South played North for @SQ - South didn't know who had @HQ|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|by: east played well, but this hand was given away by NS, not earned by EW|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||

nt|petergill: pref for spade queen queen, when he could have played a lower @D - I have great sympathy for South.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|mc|11|nt|petergill: Ruffing the 3rd club = one club trick and one trump and only one spade = 790. North made 3 errors, but ruffing the 3rd club would have been a 4th error. Defence is not easy. |pg||
nt|twcho: seems that China will have considerable advantage in this room|pg||
nt|twcho: we'll learn later from the website|pg||
nt|twcho: bye now|pg||
nt|by: someone says that south knows that a diamond guarantees a set, but there is nothing saying that E is not 6331 without the @sQ|pg||
nt|by: but I agree with peter that NS knows the E minor distribution, so N should give some kind of suit pref to say NO SPADES|pg||
nt|petergill: 100% correct - and that very odd @D7 by North on the 3rd club seemed to be suit pref to show @SQ|pg||
