pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Wonder if neg X ain't better to use at the long term over 2@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: @D in hand|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Over for cross ruffs?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By @H as the start|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: The bidding and play (@CK unblock = doubleton) indicate that clubs are 7-2. Thus declarer expects some bad breaks in other suits. |pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzek: oh|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: If club ruff, then @HQ should be ducked by South|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|mc|9|nt|petergill: I can see 9 tricks, but declarer needs friendlier spades, I think|pg||

nt|petergill: His coach Patrick Huang would be proud of his play. |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: claim*|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normaly 4@H also would be home. Only a @D lead from E to beat it.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ns better be caredul.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petergill: Jed and C Wu are Defending Champions in this event - they won last year, after much training by Patrick. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: All with a good color exsept N who will become the boss|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kerasidis: 2@h kind wild i thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Chayes, can u exsplain 1@H - 3@D?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: think|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I might have rebid only 2@D, not liking my Jx in RHO's suit nor my bare ace, but I think most people would rebid 3@D|pg||
pc|s8|nt|offthebend: 3D must be a Limit raise or better Bergan raise |pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe anyway by +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@C a nice spot and on for 500 at wourst now|pg||
nt|kerasidis: ns vul prevented north no show some values|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: 3@D has guaranteed that they will reach 6@D or 7@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Got there income it seems.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Gupta:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 1@H 10-14 may have long minor|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|petergill: 7@D, needing 4-3 @H's or short @HK, is a good spot if NS are silent, but not quite so good once NS have bid  |pg||
nt|petergill: This contract looks likely to fail, but you never know|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h7|nt|petergill: as suits are less likely to break when opponents bid vulnerable on low HCP|pg||

nt|petergill: witrh Australia leading|pg||
nt|offthebend: australia almost lost big on the previous board by playing in 3NT instead of 5-4 H fit |pg||
nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.2011apbf.com/tournament.htm|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|offthebend: this looks like another game in Spades via stayman |pg||
nt|rodal f: The BBO-TV if any like it: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: another interesting hand - 6@D being very aggressive, 3NT being normal|pg||
nt|petergill: China's losses to Japan and Thailand might be explained by China not being at full strength this year|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would u like to open 2@H at S hand Dennis?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or multi|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 3@h|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: 11-15, can be very short|pg||
nt|tejjyid: EW to 3@D in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1Nt will be East's bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: The web for the turney: http://www.2011apbf.com/tournament.htm|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petergill: as 2@D would be like a 2/1, 10 or 11+ with @D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to bid here, as East, because I hate balancing|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: and most likely a C lead and 11 tricks |pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT forcing for a round Chayes?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: defenetly it wins|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6-4 is always a good shape, even if the texture of the 6 card suit is a bit shaky|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth could try 3@C here, if that's invivtaioal and South has confirmed a @C suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzek: he not arert|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East gets a 2nd chance - I prefer to save my 2nd chances for more importtant things :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: S lead is also possible|pg||
nt|rodal f: Domes for -1 anyway.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: They talked convention before match start 10 min|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: As u presumed.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf  updated after round 6. Hong Kong leading now, Thailand 10th|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thailand killed from a slam? Let's ee what OR will do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: I agree with Sun Ming - @H10 (the great heart suit) makes 3@H a better rebid than 3NT (only one stop in @C) or 3@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Careful with the @S10 now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was NF as exspected and drurey by 2@C no fit - 2@D with fit|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tejjyid: If East had ovecalled 2@D the first time; West would find the raise to 3@D more easily|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: *see|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|petergill: NS play Precision ref http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/venicecup/china/ming-hongli.pdf|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: A small triumph for the team from Tahiti (and other islands) to push the Defending Champions into a 5-1 fit|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice defence, so far|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: Good duck of the first club, removing any danger of going down|pg||

pc|d3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|offthebend: she can draw trumps and play like NT contract :) but nope - lets play trick by trick |pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: but not much there at present - Participants are there|pg||
nt|tejjyid: There's a lot of work for South, but he should make 8 tricks without much trouble...the 9th, well, we'll see|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: B15 can become a IMPer for "The Aussies"|pg||

nt|rodal f: Only 31 match points between NS and EW.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|offthebend: D partial for EW if they can find it |pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: Only about 100 to 200 bridge players in Malaysia, so not many volunteers to do the hard work, so do not expect instant updates of websites|pg||
nt|rodal f: At B1 OR are playing 4@H and not 3NT= as here.|pg||
mb|r|nt|petergill: Splinter|pg||
mb|2D|nt|petergill: 6@H is not a great contract, and of course would fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B1 sold at the mol. 4@HN= here and 3@DW at OR.|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: rather sensible contract on a 9 card fit on board 1 :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3-card raises are awkward after a X for most pairs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|petergill: It would be a major triumph to reach 6@D here|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C splinter? |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I don't like XX in case the auction gets pre-empted, but in practice i vaery rarely does, so you get to bid the hand this way|pg||
mb|3C|nt|petergill: 4@SX costs 500, but EW probably would bid on to 5@H. |pg||
nt|offthebend: any EXCUSE to open or overcall these days |pg||
nt|kerasidis: so the only forcing bid over overcall is double?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: whihc is very convenient|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@S, bidding around the singleton, is preferred|pg||
nt|petergill: Now 4@D?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kerasidis: or maybe jumbing|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: E bid his colors and don't care the 2@S from S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: even if the dont lead dia i can not see 5 making|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|petergill: I'm not a big fan of too many lead-directing doubles - they tend to advise the opponents that their values are in the right places, as here |pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid by French Polynesia|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: May we say that a 3NT might is lost. Bit hard for EW here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: they will have chance later also|pg||
nt|kerasidis: sure|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: Last year, Chinese Taipei won this event on 401 VPs, Australia 2nd on 399 VPs. French Polynesia finished 12th out of 13. |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|offthebend: if the leads are 3/5 , clubs must be 5-5 and N should be marked with doubleton SK for her opening|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: Any deep hook to come in @S? N have opened.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|kerasidis: hmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: seems have a chance :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tejjyid: I wonder if anyone watching can help me find out why the scores from the other romm aren't coming through? Maybe the operator knows?|pg||
