nt|oliverc: A@D after the A@H and then lead Ace and a small @S. If South wins, more likely to|pg||
nt|oliverc: find the A@C with North and South might have been endplayed anyway|pg||
nt|brotherp: funny result in open room|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|brotherp: weak nt or maybe upgraded because of the nice features|pg||
nt|brotherp: tactical decision needed by East|pg||
nt|brotherp: 3@d anyone?|pg||
nt|bobholl: marion thinks long :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure...and an unusual aution in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a good weak 2?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good player, though|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|d|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|d|nt|brotherp: dbl showing a 4 card major and a longer minor; quite a common treatment in NL|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the slam zone just about|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brotherp: 3@d now ?!|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess marion will bid 3@D now|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but 6@C is no thing of beauty |pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is certainly a normal contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: again all very normal|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pas seems to turn out ok|pg||
nt|brotherp: remarkable decision imo; anyway 2@h will handle nicely also - barring the unfindable trump lead|pg||
mc|9|nt|roswolf: not really many hands of interest - the dealing computer on strike perhaps!?|pg||
nt|bobholl: paulissen contemplating and still thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: with no poor breaks any reasonable line works|pg||
nt|roswolf: still he has to plan for a rainy day|pg||
nt|bobholl: he has only 9 tricks if everything breaks without a @D ruff so i guess he'll try that|pg||
nt|bobholl: gib says 11 tricks but he sees 52 cards (just like we :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably cdonsidering the diamond guess|pg||

nt|xenya: sorry :)|pg||
nt|dburn: he will make a try with 2@s - 2@c was a transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dburn: so this is invitational with five spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ballebodk: are they playing some kind off checkback ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|dburn: and although South has a minimum in some ways, it's a pretty suitable minimum|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|dburn: they play that 2@c forces 2@d, over which bids are invitational|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: 4-5 defensive tricks and pd did open|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: the heart J may worry declarer ..|pg||

nt|bobholl: 5@D goes down also on 3@C |pg||
nt|brotherp: in the end the 4@H contract in the open room was made because North continued spades when in with the @hA|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C disappearing on @D|pg||

pc|c9|nt|dburn: so although it looked odd, and although it was some way adrift in terms of the actual deal, it was a lead with a reason|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h5|pc|d5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, also note the unblocking @C10|pg||

nt|roswolf: this could be bloody if someone gets too frisky|pg||
nt|petepunt: however would have bid 2@D first time|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: nice slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: agree, Peter, 4@D now is a gamble - almost like all-in|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@S - 2NT = invit with 4+@s for sure 3@H cant be naturel|pg||
nt|ampelman: 9 tricks for NS in a @h contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: inverted raise to start with?|pg||
nt|ampelman: splinter bid ?|pg||
nt|pauleger: Last board of the match coming up. Play will resume in 35 minutes according to the bulletin. Thx all for watching and BBO for making this possible :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: strong cub|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bid it?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bobholl: jan (jansma) asks why east thougth so long :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should raise the ante|pg||

nt|roswolf: 4@C cue?|pg||
nt|pauleger: interesting 3@c bid|pg||
nt|pauleger: propably a good @d raise|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: north gets that sinking feeling|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: West found partner with what West could expect - a bog-standard weak no trump with two low spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's not a great 11 count with KQ doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: its a shocking 11 count :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ok spade cue|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@d is minimum, I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C or 4@D?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|pauleger: if W has AJ here, you should not put in the @s K here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pauleger: a hand, where it is good to lead 2nd from 4 small|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|brotherp: finally an easy hand|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|roswolf: blood will flow|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOW 4NT|pg||
nt|pauleger: with stiff @dQ it looked obvious to swith to @h|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobholl: they play polish @C so N knows S is strong |pg||
nt|bobholl: jan is thinking long not normal for him|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: 6@D by default|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobholl: not that easy he still has got a lot of losing @D|pg||
nt|brotherp: not knowing the friendly distribution though Schollaard will spend some time figuring out the savest way|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|ampelman: 4@h was the bid east wanted to here|pg||
nt|ampelman: hear|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s8|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|roswolf: east seems to have created a lot of losers now|pg||
