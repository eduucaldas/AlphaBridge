mb|p|nt|ntmon: EW looking for slam|pg||
nt|mamos: this appears to be Sonata v Lavazza in Group F   so team names are wrong |pg||
nt|ntmon: definitely|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@s would appear normal now|pg||
nt|ntmon: can't imagine they will stop now|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe 5@c reflects  the values best of all|pg||
nt|ntmon: cue by E is mandatory i think|pg||
nt|mamos: it is surprising then that itis taking so long :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mamos: or as spec suggests 4@d   depends if you cue first or second   |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mamos: we didnt think of that|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: MMMM going minus at both tables i fear|pg||

nt|ntmon: a match from group N|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

pc|d4|nt|spooky: ah North opened a natural weak 2 there..|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos: on the surface declarer has quite a bit to do  --  Vienna coup is being suggested but other lines might fail|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|mamos: North certainly could be embarassed in the majors |pg||

nt|ntmon: @S suit will win here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: a pushy 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hawe45:  A good 4 @S - but no winner|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Brave bid by North - 500/800 available|pg||
nt|mamos: EW  will make 5   perhaps will NS outbid that|pg||
nt|xenya: if N jumps to 4@S now, E will surely bid 5@H|pg||
nt|ntmon: true|pg||
mb|5H|nt|spooky: but I guess they will bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: THEY SHOULD|pg||
mb|5S|mb|6H|nt|roswolf: 3@C?|pg||
nt|ntmon: N/s vulnerable but not afraid|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: NS are polish, 1@C=12-14 BAL, 15(16)+ 5+@C or 19+ "any"|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: OK THX|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|spooky: 3@C now i guess, to show invitational values..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup but 2@S=?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: this wont be pretty for supporters of NS|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@S would have been a good save |pg||
pc|s6|nt|ntmon: doubled 1-level contract is always lot of fun|pg||

mb|d|nt|lml: I know clubs are a minor but you are allowed to play there|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure he will bid 3@c but West is thinking|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: aggressive bid by West I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Bulgarians are known for it|pg||

nt|xenya: for a huge swing to Batov|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 2: At the other table in this match, Anisia Shami from New Zealand (East) opened 1@S|pg||
nt|spooky: I expect NS to come higher than 2@H, they might try 4@H even|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might bid the heart game here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ntmon: 1@C strong or Polish|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: George Bilski from Australia opens 2@C, GF|pg||
nt|mamos: Im afraid I know nothing about the NS team - Sonata or the players   would be pleased to relay any information from a spec who knows the team|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 NT easy to play, difficult to bid|pg||
nt|mamos: 5@s was brave and gained a rewrd|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Maybe 7 @H then|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would make a try as north|pg||
nt|roswolf: as well|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C natural, positive by Misha Solar from Sydney - a promising start to the auction|pg||
nt|ntmon: looks like polish club sequence|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|roswolf: e/w need to defend carefully|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|spooky: @DA-@CA @S needed|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ntmon: 1@C 18+ here|pg||
nt|mamos: North has presumably shown his hand as Strong and balanced |pg||
nt|ntmon: 18-20 most probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: now almost odds on this will make|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  Service-double - helps declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: this will need a fairly inspired guess|pg||
nt|spooky: East is almost sure that they have to be fast..|pg||
nt|roswolf: Fiona Brown may well find a club switch but will Hugh McGann find the killer spade|pg||
nt|spooky: If Fiona finds the @C switch, I can't see why Hugh won't find the @S|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: 7@H is not a great contract, needing hearts 3-2 on a @D lead. 7NT is excellent, needing clubs not 5-1 or spade hook or squeeze.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Two round of @H, A-K of @C abd a @S-ruff seems right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  and|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ntmon: @C suit is blocked|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w are a strong pair for this event both established internationals for their countries|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ntmon: quick end|pg||
nt|roswolf: club switch found +spade well done|pg||
pc|d8|pc|hT|nt|ntmon: not easy arrive in 4@S or 5@C|pg||
nt|mamos: as the cards lie  three Club tricks would have been enough  |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|c5|pg||

nt|spooky: I understand it with 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: east knows how optimistic hugh is:)|pg||

nt|spooky: Would you bid 3N Geoffrey?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would actually|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: but nS have been propelled too high|pg||

nt|roswolf: last board coming up|pg||
nt|spooky: Last board of this Round now|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  But up to now, the whole match has been won by the lucky slam at board 4|pg||
mb|1S|an|.|mb|p|nt|sybarra: one again,  4 @H will not make here for n/s on the sp ruff |pg||
nt|ntmon: we have a couple od double-digit IMP exchanges - all from high level competitive bidding|pg||
mb|2H|an|.|nt|spooky: South will act now I believe|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mamos: another wildly competitive hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 6 @D makes |pg||
nt|mamos: 5@d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not 6?|pg||
nt|mamos: oh gosh even 6@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: and the lead on Bd 7, where one South led your recommended lead and the other did not|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: into the valley of real death - t/o dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Here the technical right play for 3 @D-tricks is working fine|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, we've been treated to some exciting hands|pg||
nt|ntmon: surely not dull|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|roswolf: blood will flow|pg||
pc|h4|nt|spooky: hard to find the @S fit for NS|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: defence even have a well placed @S10|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|xenya: N showed discipline by leading partner's suit|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes, but that was NOT LUVK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  LUCK|pg||
nt|petergill: although the trump lead on Bd 7 may have been assisted by the auction at the table where the trump lead was found|pg||
nt|xenya: alas, that doesn't work here|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|mamos: always lead partner's suit unless its wrong|pg||
nt|ntmon: too late|pg||
nt|xenya: this is the last board -- thanks everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: ty everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: especialy our vugraph op   --  |pg||
nt|ntmon: another round today play expect to start within 40 min|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|petergill: Bd 7: to help the defence find the @H lead?|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3 off was available|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: looks like 25 for the Lavazza team  -  time perhaps for coffee :)|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to our op and fellow commentators|pg||
nt|ntmon: thanks to all for watching, great set full of dynamic boards|pg||

pc|dT|nt|petergill: Bd 10: Setting up clubs in 1NT meant that declarer did not have to pick @D at all|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that'|pg||
nt|petergill: I think they have played all 10 boards|pg||
nt|petergill: photo of East (Ewa Sobolewska) is at http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4683|pg||
nt|petergill: Match score so far is actually 43-1 (25-3 in VPs), as Bd 3 swing was only 11 imps|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores are at http://r.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||

nt|spooky: good defence for -3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ntmon: 8 IMPs = 18:12 |pg||
mc|9|nt|ntmon: then only 17:13|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: TD was called|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: it's about the bidings , 1S wasn't alerted by E|pg||
nt|ntmon: using X for @s and 1@S for NT becomes a standard in Poland, but not widespread and surely have to be alerted|pg||
nt|ntmon: so, the issue has to be resolved. pls find official result on http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|ntmon: bye for now|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: decision will be later|pg||
