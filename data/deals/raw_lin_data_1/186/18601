nt|patricck: insufficient attention to the negative inference|pg||
nt|stc: he gives defense a second chance|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|stc: 12 tricks if you stretch|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 6NT romps home if it is bid. Basically it is a 50% slam, just solely on the postioion of the K@S|pg||

nt|patricck: less than 50% I guess, but 4 tricks in clubs not that crucial, it needs the K@S and then either short K@S (so 4 spades) or J@C dropping (so 4 @C) or if they don't work then try the ...|pg||
