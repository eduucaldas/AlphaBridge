nt|ntmon: definitely|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@s would appear normal now|pg||
nt|ntmon: can't imagine they will stop now|pg||

pc|s3|nt|mamos: on the surface declarer has quite a bit to do  --  Vienna coup is being suggested but other lines might fail|pg||

nt|roswolf: THEY SHOULD|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@C?|pg||

nt|athene: i assume just alerted because it's a better hand than it might be for some people :)|pg||
nt|athene: in which case south might reasonably just bash the game in|pg||
nt|jbgood: single spade and double @d K would have made the hand much better|pg||
nt|athene: of course the defence have two spades and the two minor aces but there are several ways this might come home|pg||
nt|jbgood: she must be thinking of a preemptive raise (I guess)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: that's a big underbid facing a constructive raise|pg||
nt|jbgood: I think there are other opinions on that, Bill|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|athene: east has to grab his ace and shift to a club to get the spade through|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: the @D7 is a sort of interesting card to lead from that suit|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 2: At the other table in this match, Anisia Shami from New Zealand (East) opened 1@S|pg||
nt|spooky: I expect NS to come higher than 2@H, they might try 4@H even|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might bid the heart game here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ntmon: 1@C strong or Polish|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: George Bilski from Australia opens 2@C, GF|pg||
nt|mamos: Im afraid I know nothing about the NS team - Sonata or the players   would be pleased to relay any information from a spec who knows the team|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 NT easy to play, difficult to bid|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Maybe 7 @H then|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would make a try as north|pg||
nt|roswolf: as well|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@C natural, positive by Misha Solar from Sydney - a promising start to the auction|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w need to defend carefully|pg||
pc|d3|nt|spooky: @DA-@CA @S needed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ntmon: 1@C 18+ here|pg||
nt|mamos: North has presumably shown his hand as Strong and balanced |pg||
nt|ntmon: 18-20 most probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: now almost odds on this will make|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Service-double - helps declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: this will need a fairly inspired guess|pg||
nt|spooky: East is almost sure that they have to be fast..|pg||
nt|roswolf: Fiona Brown may well find a club switch but will Hugh McGann find the killer spade|pg||
nt|spooky: If Fiona finds the @C switch, I can't see why Hugh won't find the @S|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|petergill: 7@H is not a great contract, needing hearts 3-2 on a @D lead. 7NT is excellent, needing clubs not 5-1 or spade hook or squeeze.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Two round of @H, A-K of @C abd a @S-ruff seems right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  and|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ntmon: @C suit is blocked|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w are a strong pair for this event both established internationals for their countries|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|ntmon: quick end|pg||
nt|roswolf: club switch found +spade well done|pg||
