nt|stc: I like Indy, less science and more judgement :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ntmon: but you need to know the system anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: this looks like a stright-forward 4@h which probably makes 5|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. has to cash 3 first tricks out, if they succceed i predict they'll get a big reward and a close to top result|pg||
nt|psridhar: versatile game this Bridge-engages varied interests , since the game has many facets-science, judgment, analysis , psychology, etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: are we under way with a grand slam|pg||
nt|garnetts: This looks like a bidding challenge hand 7NT a spread and nearly impossible to bid |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: maybe but 7c should be bid|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: some people will bid it vai 2NT-3NT |pg||
mb|3H|nt|yuval10: of course, small @c lead from N means 12 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: yes, not easy for N to play @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: this is IMPs right? OTs have less importance ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: no|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@d on 2N was transfer accordimng to cc|pg||
nt|yuval10: MP's i'm affraid|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe E forgot, so this sequence should be slam interest|pg||
nt|ntmon: MP for sure|pg||
nt|psridhar: but our scoreboard above says IMPs....|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, but it is MP|pg||
nt|stc: I don't think it may be Individual at IMPs|pg||

nt|psyck: bbo cannot show scores with 1 mp table shown|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: so Matchpoints it is ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: noiw maybe 7h|pg||
mb|6H|nt|garnetts: 4@D by the passed hand would have got them there |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: now after W denied @s control|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: now to me that is an awful bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: perhaps it's easier for N to find the winning lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: a lot of MP's are in stake now|pg||
nt|psyck: the def will get it right, very costly for E to forget the cc|pg||
nt|jcomyn: playing precision whats the rush|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@H is virtually a nonsense bid unless he is gambling that they will lead the wrong thing |pg||
pc|h2|nt|yuval10: very well done by N|pg||
nt|psyck: 2 pages should not be hard to remember :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: why not 3s and then 4d by s|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psridhar: i agree that this sequence by E is slammish in many conventions -but very few define it, in other words what is opener required to do ?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: with fit and max hand, i suppose opener is to make a forward going bid or rkc|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s4|pc|d6|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|psridhar: if responder is looking for fit, he has a balanced hand realtively? else he can trf and bid a 2nd suit-say 2-7-2-2 type ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: will KX,K109XXXX,XX,QX do?|pg||
nt|stc: Many players accept the transfer only with fit - it is a big advantage for such hands|pg||
nt|psridhar: i suggest you play it as = i dont need any fit ; i need a control rich hand -either pure all aces and kings in 20hcp OR some source of tricks like KQJXX in side suit with opener ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: with controls outside|pg||
nt|stc: the price is that you risk be too high |pg||
nt|psyck: that is an interesting & sensible treatment PS.  |pg||
nt|stc: do we have standings after first session ?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/indi.php|pg||
nt|psridhar: the logic is -thats the only value the responder cannot find out easily since 2N opg is space consuming|pg||

mb|p|nt|stc: the interesting point here will be the handling of zje trump suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: accurate bidding by Schwartz -his seq shows about what he has here|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He will lose a trick in hearts I predict|pg||
nt|yuval10: then maybe a ruff too|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe but an easier thing to do is reverse 1@S and 1NT |pg||
mb|5C|nt|stc: the %play is to finesse the 2nd round of @h|pg||

nt|psridhar: else Lazar thinks 2 keys are missing|pg||

nt|granguru:  the importance of showing valuable voids in RKCB is ofoveerwhelming importance|pg||
nt|psridhar: now E has to 'punt' 6@H|pg||
nt|stc: I don't see any reason not to lead @d against 6@h|pg||
nt|psridhar: kind of bid that will invite more criticism when it fails than accolade when it wins( oh u got lucky! )|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  if W would have shown a 2 suited with 2N then W probably would have played 6@D instead of 6@H by E|pg||
nt|psyck: I E was going to bid on 5@h, he may have tried 6@d |pg||

nt|psridhar: the two suits lack parity acutely ..so perhaps E decided to hide it|pg||
