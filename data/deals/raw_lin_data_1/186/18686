nt|stc: I like Indy, less science and more judgement :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3nt - or dare i say it|pg||
nt|mamos: How many of the 90 tables do you think will bid that Shirley?:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so far less brutal than last set,    |pg||
nt|mamos: game might not make this time|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: might be difficult to stay our of game here |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: *stay out|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ntmon: but you need to know the system anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: this looks like a stright-forward 4@h which probably makes 5|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. has to cash 3 first tricks out, if they succceed i predict they'll get a big reward and a close to top result|pg||
nt|psridhar: versatile game this Bridge-engages varied interests , since the game has many facets-science, judgment, analysis , psychology, etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: are we under way with a grand slam|pg||
nt|garnetts: This looks like a bidding challenge hand 7NT a spread and nearly impossible to bid |pg||
nt|mamos: and for sure they'll bid it if they did the last one|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: maybe but 7c should be bid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: some people will bid it vai 2NT-3NT |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5c better of course|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Victor Silverstone|pg||
nt|odysseus69: morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: of course, small @c lead from N means 12 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: yes, not easy for N to play @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: this is IMPs right? OTs have less importance ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: no|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@d on 2N was transfer accordimng to cc|pg||
nt|yuval10: MP's i'm affraid|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe E forgot, so this sequence should be slam interest|pg||
nt|ntmon: MP for sure|pg||
nt|psridhar: but our scoreboard above says IMPs....|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, but it is MP|pg||
nt|stc: I don't think it may be Individual at IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/indi.php  look|pg||
nt|psyck: bbo cannot show scores with 1 mp table shown|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: so Matchpoints it is ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: noiw maybe 7h|pg||
nt|sybarra: may have staved off the @S lead |pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: 4@D by the passed hand would have got them there |pg||
nt|sybarra: but is that enough?|pg||
nt|mamos: well the defence will probaly have this and one more chance to get the defence right|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yuval10: now after W denied @s control|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good night|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: to 3nt i mean|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now to me that is an awful bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good hand for strong club- should have avoided 3NT but North rushed in|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes they in forcing situastion so why not 2nt|pg||
nt|mamos: needs Club return and Spade immediately  I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is obviuos|pg||
nt|sybarra: *obvious |pg||
nt|mamos: East can see the danger in the dummy|pg||
nt|mamos: I think Club is clear|pg||
nt|mamos: she knows she needs Spade from partner|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yuval10: perhaps it's easier for N to find the winning lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: a lot of MP's are in stake now|pg||
nt|psyck: the def will get it right, very costly for E to forget the cc|pg||
nt|jcomyn: playing precision whats the rush|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@H is virtually a nonsense bid unless he is gambling that they will lead the wrong thing |pg||
pc|h8|nt|yuval10: very well done by N|pg||
nt|psyck: 2 pages should not be hard to remember :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: why not 3s and then 4d by s|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psridhar: i agree that this sequence by E is slammish in many conventions -but very few define it, in other words what is opener required to do ?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psyck: with fit and max hand, i suppose opener is to make a forward going bid or rkc|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: needs to decide to play for singleton club king with West or jack with East- he decided quicker than i could type|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont beat italians horsing around|pg||
nt|mamos: I only have a slight advantage over East of course |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|sT|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|psridhar: if responder is looking for fit, he has a balanced hand realtively? else he can trf and bid a 2nd suit-say 2-7-2-2 type ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: will KX,K109XXXX,XX,QX do?|pg||
nt|stc: Many players accept the transfer only with fit - it is a big advantage for such hands|pg||
nt|psridhar: i suggest you play it as = i dont need any fit ; i need a control rich hand -either pure all aces and kings in 20hcp OR some source of tricks like KQJXX in side suit with opener ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: with controls outside|pg||
nt|stc: the price is that you risk be too high |pg||
nt|psyck: that is an interesting & sensible treatment PS.  |pg||
nt|stc: do we have standings after first session ?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/indi.php|pg||
nt|psridhar: the logic is -thats the only value the responder cannot find out easily since 2N opg is space consuming|pg||

nt|Walddk3: We would approve of 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk3: even from Alon|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what happened there|pg||
nt|odysseus69: presumably 3C from North would be forcing- then 3H from South and 3NT avoided|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: surely 3nt is one down|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Diamond 7 at the other table 2 here  if that makes a difference  defender found Club switch for deserved swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: anyone likme to let us know who's playing and who sitting ew|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: East will hope to come in later with minors- may be a bit high when it gets back to him|pg||
nt|mamos: i presume thats a 15-17 NT  but still has a lot of tricks |pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: not everyone's choice of 1 nt,  but this will work |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: bad 6@C contract possible --will boil down to getting the trumps right --and guessing the spades |pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know what happened on bd 13|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: I dont like 1nt on the s handf with very poor spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: Little choice I imagine systemically |pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: this is a bit daft when you dpont know who isd playing against whom|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: you can always bid 1D and catch up later|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: all yopu really want to do is play 3nt from N|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no but on 12 where declarer misplayed 2H and went down they made 9 tricks next door|pg||
pc|c7|nt|stc: the interesting point here will be the handling of zje trump suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: accurate bidding by Schwartz -his seq shows about what he has here|pg||
nt|Walddk3: He will lose a trick in hearts I predict|pg||
nt|yuval10: then maybe a ruff too|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe but an easier thing to do is reverse 1@S and 1NT |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|stc: the %play is to finesse the 2nd round of @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he leads @d, and he does|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|sT|nt|garnetts: well they got to it --now it will come down to guesswork |pg||

pc|s3|nt|stc: safety plays at MP are not a must|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: never cover an honour with an honour - i think thats the rule|pg||

nt|Walddk3: He can no longer ruff a heart and get back to hand to draw|pg||

nt|psridhar: kind of bid that will invite more criticism when it fails than accolade when it wins( oh u got lucky! )|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru:  if W would have shown a 2 suited with 2N then W probably would have played 6@D instead of 6@H by E|pg||
nt|psyck: I E was going to bid on 5@h, he may have tried 6@d |pg||
nt|psyck: *If E|pg||
nt|psridhar: the two suits lack parity acutely ..so perhaps E decided to hide it|pg||
nt|granguru:  MP bidding strategy makes these little bidding distortions|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good guess by South --might have had no play and might well go off still if east ducks the heart |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: killing lead - triumph for 2H opener|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|stc: wow !|pg||
nt|granguru:  defense must manage not to clash @s tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psridhar: Lazar might hv tried a forcing pass here ...in the context of his 5@H it only says he doesnt have @c values ( but hand still belongs to EW)|pg||
nt|garnetts: technicall as a kib has said only a club kills it --but this lead makes it hard |pg||

nt|psridhar: lot better than -1370|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psridhar: difficult hand for both NS and EW , and difficult for commentators too to predict scores here:)|pg||
nt|psyck: Birman may have recovered some in this round of what he lost in prior round|pg||
nt|stc: I think that -500 is about average|pg||
nt|psyck: the scores are at: http://www.israel-grand-prize.com/result/total.php|pg||
nt|psyck: but they are a few rounds behind...|pg||
nt|psridhar: From 4@s X -1 to 6@H -1 =a whole range of scores possible |pg||
