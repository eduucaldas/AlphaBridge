nt|ntmon: welcome to Euro 2011, Mixed Teams, RR  4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ntmon: EW looking for slam|pg||
nt|mamos: this appears to be Sonata v Lavazza in Group F   so team names are wrong |pg||
nt|ntmon: definitely|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@s would appear normal now|pg||
nt|ntmon: can't imagine they will stop now|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe 5@c reflects  the values best of all|pg||
nt|ntmon: cue by E is mandatory i think|pg||
nt|mamos: it is surprising then that itis taking so long :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: or as spec suggests 4@d   depends if you cue first or second   |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mamos: we didnt think of that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats the problem with pre-empts 5-3 h fit disappears|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: MMMM going minus at both tables i fear|pg||
nt|spooky: In Polish 3@D shows a min with @H|pg||
nt|ntmon: a match from group N|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ntmon: or perhaps we are wrong and 4@C was key card ask or something|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|mamos: surely Or result is wrong ???|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk7: Hello to 2 x Vladimir, a rare sight|pg||
nt|ntmon: teams 2nd and 3rd currently in table of group N|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed Roland|pg||
pc|dK|nt|spooky: I'm surprised south didn't dbl 2@S in the other room, or would that be pass or correct?|pg||
nt|ntmon: i exeperienced 4 vladimir at one table :) |pg||
nt|mamos: helo|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Mike|pg||
pc|d2|nt|spooky: ah North opened a natural weak 2 there..|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: True but if they had found @hs, we'd be complaining that the 7-3 @d fit got no respect.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway whats wrong with 3h bid since she holds 3-card d and doesnt care|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: on the surface declarer has quite a bit to do  --  Vienna coup is being suggested but other lines might fail|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|mamos: North certainly could be embarassed in the majors |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
mc|10|nt|jcomyn: well i aint passing 3h since she knows they have a big d fit|pg||

mb|1C|nt|mamos: For specs joining us this is a group F match  Sonata NS Lavazza ew |pg||
nt|ntmon: @S suit will win here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a pushy 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  A good 4 @S - but no winner|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Brave bid by North - 500/800 available|pg||
nt|mamos: EW  will make 5   perhaps will NS outbid that|pg||
nt|xenya: if N jumps to 4@S now, E will surely bid 5@H|pg||
nt|ntmon: true|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just the 4h|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: but I guess they will bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: THEY SHOULD|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@C?|pg||
nt|ntmon: N/s vulnerable but not afraid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: then asgain may not get a s lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|spooky: NS are polish, 1@C=12-14 BAL, 15(16)+ 5+@C or 19+ "any"|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: OK THX|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is very likely to be the scores link:  http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrrunda4.html |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|spooky: 3@C now i guess, to show invitational values..|pg||
nt|santyclz: sorry:  http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrrunda5.html|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|roswolf: yup but 2@S=?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: this wont be pretty for supporters of NS|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@S would have been a good save |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ntmon: doubled 1-level contract is always lot of fun|pg||
nt|mamos: except for South|pg||
nt|ntmon: it depends|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|spooky: INV 5@S?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|spooky: looks like a 2-way check back sequence|pg||
nt|roswolf: OK it worked|pg||
nt|ntmon: W expected from passed hand too much i think|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|spooky: North will start play @C |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|mamos: @dQ seems likely to be best card|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|spooky: He will just play on A or K onside?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|mamos: especially since EW had no easy contractof their own|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|xenya: with an additional chance that W would bid on |pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: which is what really happened|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d2|pc|cJ|nt|spooky: and a push|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2N!|mb|d|nt|ballebodk: optimal contract must bee 5 sp - then everybody have done their best|pg||
nt|lml: some pairs will open the north hand.  What do you think?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|ballebodk: well - i play with weak NT and i never open 1 NT vul. with 11hp so i have to pass, but non.vul. i would open everytime|pg||
nt|lml: big bid by FIscher with a c|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lml: I suppose double should show defense by West|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: OOps|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lml: so whose to blame?|pg||
nt|lml: I think more east than west but west helped out|pg||
nt|lml: I have one vote for east and one for west|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H is not weak - its ambiguous and East is a passed hand|pg||
nt|ballebodk: thats the same problem everytime when you double on highcards and not trumfs - some time the highcards dont give tricks. if i have jumped to 4 h on E cards i wouldt have stood the ...|pg||
nt|ballebodk: 4 sX - i have minustricks. i will remove to 5 h and take my medicine there !|pg||
nt|lml: I think West was trying to say I have some defenseive cards but really ak-a in the reds isnt much|pg||
nt|lml: whenever I pull as East we beat it|pg||
nt|lml: it isn't so bad to make 4@S doubled but the overtrick makes it quite painful|pg||

nt|xenya: for a huge swing to Batov|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 2: At the other table in this match, Anisia Shami from New Zealand (East) opened 1@S|pg||
nt|spooky: I expect NS to come higher than 2@H, they might try 4@H even|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might bid the heart game here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jcomyn: will they be allowed to play in 4s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ntmon: 1@C strong or Polish|pg||
mb|d|an|.|nt|petergill: George Bilski from Australia opens 2@C, GF|pg||
nt|mamos: Im afraid I know nothing about the NS team - Sonata or the players   would be pleased to relay any information from a spec who knows the team|pg||
nt|santyclz: There are currently 10 vg tables open, to watch multiple tables:  www.bridgebase.com/mobile  Open 1 browser window/table.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hawe45:  7 NT easy to play, difficult to bid|pg||
nt|mamos: 5@s was brave and gained a rewrd|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass with s?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: That's a little better.|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  Maybe 7 @H then|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would make a try as north|pg||
nt|roswolf: as well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i aint passing 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Nor I, but I don't think x would be my choice.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with 5d anyone tell me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why make things difficult|pg||
nt|santyclz: Too obvious?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont hel partner whatever u do|pg||
nt|jcomyn: help|pg||
nt|santyclz: My maiden aunt would bid 5@d.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not to mention my granny|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@C natural, positive by Misha Solar from Sydney - a promising start to the auction|pg||
nt|ntmon: looks like polish club sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: (And she's old enough she used to play in the White House with Eisenhauer.)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now look what he did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but she is a w........|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: e/w need to defend carefully|pg||
pc|d3|nt|spooky: @DA-@CA @S needed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: 1@C 18+ here|pg||
nt|mamos: North has presumably shown his hand as Strong and balanced |pg||
nt|ntmon: 18-20 most probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: now almost odds on this will make|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those too young to remember |pg||
nt|garnetts: hi folks sorry to be late but had a power cut |pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  Service-double - helps declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: this will need a fairly inspired guess|pg||
nt|spooky: East is almost sure that they have to be fast..|pg||
nt|roswolf: Fiona Brown may well find a club switch but will Hugh McGann find the killer spade|pg||
nt|spooky: If Fiona finds the @C switch, I can't see why Hugh won't find the @S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can u believe a flat board. This confirms what i tell my beginners - It is the players who make this game difficult|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|petergill: 7@H is not a great contract, needing hearts 3-2 on a @D lead. 7NT is excellent, needing clubs not 5-1 or spade hook or squeeze.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Two round of @H, A-K of @C abd a @S-ruff seems right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  and|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ntmon: @C suit is blocked|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w are a strong pair for this event both established internationals for their countries|pg||
nt|santyclz: Eisenhower was president in the 50s and famous for playing bridge in the oval office.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ntmon: quick end|pg||
nt|roswolf: club switch found +spade well done|pg||
mc|11|nt|jcomyn: was he good|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or like bill clintons golf|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: Gottlieb is shouting |pg||
nt|jcomyn: he cant be it was his fault|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good for a non-money, non-tourny player. Strictly played for fun as many did in WWII.|pg||

nt|lml: that price is probably about 10 imps|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ballebodk: i think 4 h is ok but then remove the X to 5 h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: yes if you make that bid you have to pull .. I agree|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ballebodk: a heavy overcall - buts also my style|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: Yes when you know partner will raise you with a hand like north's there is little risk in overcalling|pg||
nt|lml: so how to play spades|pg||
nt|lml: that is going to be south's decision on the hand|pg||
nt|lml: we know it all works of course|pg||
nt|lml: if you finesse you plan to finesse twice... otherwise you lose to stiff honor.|pg||
nt|ballebodk: yep - the big problem is that we have only entrance to the N hand|pg||
nt|lml: but entries are short|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
nt|lml: so those who answered ace and one are right|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ballebodk: so is E: Qxx, xxxxxxxxxxx  or KQx, xxxxxxxxx ?|pg||
nt|lml: imho|pg||
nt|lml: fewer ways to make KQx than Qxx|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: I am not that crazy about fooling around long because there is a club ruff possible|pg||
nt|lml: although not on this hand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s5|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lml: crossing on a club to take the spade finesse can lose two ways|pg||
nt|lml: a club ruff or to Hxx onside|pg||
nt|lml: I think that south probably is influenced by the opening bid by East and thinks east might have both spades|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lml: the idea with that play is to finesse east next|pg||
nt|ballebodk: nice duck from w|pg||
nt|lml: yes and it could work very well|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: the spade return might talk south into the ace ... lets see|pg||
nt|lml: I think that a minor back and south was a goner|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|ballebodk: i'm very glad that i'm not the declarer now - this spade back is pure evil !!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

mb|1D|nt|hawe45:  Big hands here|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he claimed 13 tricks there|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2NT for minors|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Roland, and gm all from Wash. DC |pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: some excitement here|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: 2@D Multi, weak long major or big balanced|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably not the bid (minors) that W wanted to hear |pg||
nt|spooky: 1@H=4+@S |pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer to spades|pg||
nt|ntmon: non-leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|garnetts: Deng Xiaoping was another bridge playing world leader |pg||
nt|santyclz: (In other words, no.)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|petergill: North will end up in 3NT making 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: double looks good now |pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: North bid 2NT over 2@H|pg||
nt|spooky: at the other table West rebid was 1N.. thats a bit weird with 7tricks...|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is an irish overbid|pg||
nt|spooky: I understand it with 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone tell me why players x when they have an obvious bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east knows how optimistic hugh is:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H pass or correct, playing Multi|pg||
nt|spooky: Would you bid 3N Geoffrey?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would actually|pg||
nt|garnetts: dbl again ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: but nS have been propelled too high|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@S have one top loser in each suit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: true  too high |pg||
nt|jcomyn: now thats poor|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|spooky: NS lead 2nd/4th 2nd from suits without Honour, 4th from suits with H...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: more than poor - dreadfully poor|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do you think he should double initially?  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no i think he shd bid clubs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sorry she|pg||
nt|jcomyn: try and show the 10 or 11 black cards|pg||
nt|garnetts: hmm  Not sure I agree--I think double is more likely to show four |pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh i see what u mean no i dont agree with w x|pg||
pc|s5|nt|garnetts: But lack of another bid after 4@H does worry me --after all it can only cost 170 and might as here get partner to try 4@S |pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: Marek Szymanowski from Pairs won the World Pairs Championship about 17 years ago, partnered by Marcin Lesniewski I think|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: I dont think 4 hts makes either   |pg||
