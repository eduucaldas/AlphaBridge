nt|ritong: he answers if you call him "donkey kong"|pg||
nt|iceking: most often with 3-3 in majors you would pass 2@H though|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|peachy: NS play Modified Precision, very modified.   EW 2/1 with lots of gadgets and artificiality|pg||
nt|ritong: double is very active|pg||

nt|iceking: sure |pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: but west went a bit too far, seems|pg||
nt|iceking: w 3nt just 2 big possition to take|pg||
nt|iceking: vs weak 1nt openings your overcalls should be soundish, even so i think east might risk 2@D here|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I might have just passed 2S as East, waiting for a clearer case to take action|pg||
nt|peachy: or ad Magnus says, act earlier if so inclined|pg||
mb|r|nt|iceking: passing out 2@S is rather passive, though east knows after NS bidding they seldom have fit so its little dangerous to bal here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: they probably have agreed that redouble shows doubt here|pg||
nt|iceking: for expert pdships rdbl here usually means doubt|pg||

mb|4C|mb|d|nt|iceking: i am not sure though after this bidding they have speciall agremeants what rdbl shows|pg||

nt|peachy: ... to find even if it were there |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: possible 710, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 3@C might be leb here for them, shows some values|pg||
nt|iceking: i personally dont like to play leb after so many passes from my side, scrambling would be my choice of methods here|pg||
nt|iceking: now just guess @S and role hom 710?|pg||
nt|ritong: possibly|pg||
nt|peachy: EW card says that against weak NT, Dbl in passout seat is DONT, so Dbl might have meant 1-suiter|pg||
nt|iceking: will S lead low Trump after this bidding|pg||
nt|iceking: it sure is possible|pg||

nt|petergill: so perhaps a double finesse was better play - I'm not sure|pg||
nt|offthebend: she could win HA and then exit DK and a D |pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: Dynamite hand this one - anything could happen |pg||
nt|rodal f: B3 made one more IMP to the Aussies|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: In Seniors after 2 rounds http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_S.pdf - NZ's official team leads from Australia|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Australia  would be very happy with 25-5 win over Japan Yamada who won World Seniors in 2008. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D Michaels, both majors|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|d|nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/tournament.htm|pg||
nt|offthebend: danger if they find 4-4 C fit and start exploring slam |pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: I think I would have passed as North and hope S reopens with Dbl, which I would expect S to do|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@SX is worth only 500, not 800, for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: and 3NT is easy, so the difference is negligible|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 15-17NT for NS and a easy push|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: and if S does not reopen with X of 3@S, then 4@H, not 5@D, needs to be reached|pg||
nt|petergill: women's Round 1 results at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: Korea beat NZ 16-14 - a huge upset, and a mild upset was hosts Malaysia over Thailand 19-11|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: short and sweet -- who bothers about showing second suit |pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H=longer @S than @C? No idea. But remember the 1@H opening by 10XXXX|pg||
nt|offthebend: 1C was artificial strong ( 15+ )|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 2@H maybe trf after 1NT|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice contract cinsidering that 4@s can be down|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: considering|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Now that is some lead directing X|pg||
pc|cK|nt|offthebend: yes 2H showed 5 cards in S |pg||
nt|tejjyid: and East couldn't find a raise? Maybe East's @C's were so good he thought the X meant something else|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: OK. So not 16+ as I wait for at 1@C prec variant|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h3|nt|petergill: Just a question of how many 50's this contract fails by, given the misfit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Declarer's @D's will serve as trump substitutes, and the @S pips prevent the defence getting 3@S tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|petergill: In Round 1, Board 16 contributed to some upset results, with a good slam bid by the good teams failing due to a bad break|pg||
nt|petergill: At some point, perhaps on the 2nd round of @d's, I expect her to hook @DK and make 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking . .  .|pg||
nt|petergill: though there is a big worry that at the unfav vulnerability, West may have @DKx or bare @D king|pg||
nt|petergill: but Japanese women tend not to worry all that much about vulnerability and bid 3@S anyway, no on 2nd thought, Japanese players are very disciplined in the bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: surely Sun Ming knows this EW better than I do|pg||
nt|petergill: East is a well-known fairly famous player, but I don't know much about West|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|petergill: there is a very real danger that she will play West for @DKx|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|petergill: you have to be a very good player to do things like that - the mundane average players just take the @D finesse, in their innocence |pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|petergill: In the Seniors, Indonesia, Japan Yamada and Australia all have classy teams |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT must have shown 4414 minimum or perhaps 4!+ @D|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = various, then 2@H = both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: @DQx is lucky, but is it lucky enough for this to make?|pg||
nt|petergill: @CAQ lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@D would complete the shape nicely, but wuld it be forcing? (It should be)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tif So, West has to decide whether to try 3NT or 5@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Q empty oposite a singleton isn't great|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: At non vul u don.t risk anything if u stop under 3NT. Max 1IMP. But at vul it cost. The reason 3NT bidded by the 24HP|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't the luckyest lead I,ve seen at a color partscore.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: but declarer seems might be one trick short, unless two spades can be ruffed in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: The duck is an attempt to avoid the fatal @d switch|pg||
nt|petergill: A very clever attempt|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so far, nice bidding|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the problem is, from West's point of view, that if he has to ruff @H, it will be with good trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: South needs to play a red suit now|pg||
nt|offthebend: easy 8 tricks here |pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|tejjyid: so I think he has to bid 3NT - unless he decides this isn;t forcing. We have to say "nice stop" - although, I think East might be surprised|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: Good deduction by South about the reason for East's clever play|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: S hand lacks entries for 2 spade ruffs in dummy, so might have to rely on @H break (no good) or @s hook ( no good)|pg||
nt|petergill: so this looks like -1|pg||
nt|petergill: even if @DJ is led and not covered, 6@D still seems to fail - perhaps I'm mistaken?|pg||
nt|petergill: expect a very long tank by Wang Hongli|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: perhaps a better auction is 4@D by N over 3NT, then if 4NT by S is signoff, then even 4NT might be hard work to make|pg||

nt|petergill: with Qx under dummy's !AK, there is no reason not to cover @DJ|pg||
nt|petergill: South reasoned that @CA lead was the act of a person with a possible trump trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: or if @H 4-2, then @S finesse |pg||
nt|petergill: Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@S might get doubled|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new interesting board up|pg||
nt|jjsb: this one interesting also , its not that frequent u should play a slam on a 7 card fit rather than on a 8 card fit |pg||
nt|kerasidis: not tough to guess this auction will end in 4@h|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jjsb: a really weird situation|pg||
nt|rodal f: B3 OR got @DA as the lead and found @CQ. for 6@S= Well done 13IMP to China.|pg||
mb|d|nt|offthebend: Spades OVER hearts |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
mb|2D|nt|petergill: so declarer preferede to play for @S fiensse (50% chance) than for person with short @H to have short @D (less than 50%)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still an ok sac in 5@H|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes wd|pg||
nt|twcho: one may have to discuss whether transfer is still on here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 2nt attacking bid ..wild|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: West knows East has less than 3 hearts, so unless North has 5 or 6 hearts (unlikely?), West has 4 top tricks to 41S|pg||
nt|petergill: to 4@S I mean|pg||
nt|offthebend: They can make 5S on S finesse and by playing D towards the J |pg||
nt|rodal f: By that long thinking if no screens W have problem to bid. |pg||
nt|rodal f: But can tey take the safe income?|pg||
nt|jjsb: some in the audience  point out 1nt can only be made if junior :) not sure about that :) |pg||
nt|jjsb: basically on a strong club|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: On for a new push it seems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Tommy:)|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|twcho: NS is probably the top pair of HK|pg||
nt|kerasidis: about a weak ago ...i saw a very expeirienced pair misunderstanding their bid upon overcall on 1nt opening|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 16 imps lost|pg||
nt|twcho: and they are very aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi tommy|pg||
nt|twcho: hi dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|rodal f: B4 OR ended 3@HN. Here it was 5@DE= IMPs for Thailand.|pg||
nt|twcho: so one have to agree explicitly with partner when the transfer is still on  or not|pg||
nt|twcho: sell out to 3H with 7411?|pg||
nt|twcho: too cheap indeed|pg||
nt|kerasidis: of course...but there are some many difficulties yet to deal with|pg||
nt|rodal f: Cheep or cheap. I love the speciality made by cheep's:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so I think the odds massively favour a penalty dbl of 4@s on the West cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like the BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php    = til B20|pg||
nt|jjsb: a pass folloxed by a bid is normally stronger than initial overcal |pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes cheep endeed especially when partner showed values|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Do they play with screens?|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4Sx in a limited system and a known 10 card H fit is a bit surprising |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: sceen|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: screen|pg||

pc|s2|nt|rodal f: +3 and next|pg||
nt|jjsb: the idea if opening 1@c with N is kinda scaring me ...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: so I was unfair to South - her line of play is perhaps best|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have played @HK at Trick 2, in case partner's heart was singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: then switched to clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: The low heart play shows that they have 100% faith in partner's count card at Trick 1|pg||
nt|jjsb: but of course not saying its bad !!! of course it can be more than helpfull in a lot of situation |pg||
nt|rodal f: Good news. Not at the @H trap. Sad news, could get some more income.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rodal f: If no screen and pass from NS the TD should be called after the board is finnich.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|offthebend: 5H can be made by playing Clubs early and guessing the C J otherwise one down |pg||

nt|petergill: so all the bids after 1@S were forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough problem for West; I would have made a pre-emptive @C raise on the 1st round & Perhaps X is better than 2@H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: @CK onside  so no problems|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jjsb: will play AK of @h now i guess|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm sure East is expecting the @H suit to be 6 cards long|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|jjsb: and then +1 or = depends of where he will try to throw the @c |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 5-3 major fits are a real problem for the Precision 2@C opening|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|offthebend: running the C10 to throw a D can not cost or finessing now |pg||

nt|rodal f: B22 at OR: 3NT as here Here was 9 tr|pg||
nt|jjsb: i guess if u ask what to open with East u will have a lot of options|pg||
nt|jjsb: depending ur style |pg||
nt|jjsb: im personally a 2@h opening |pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: likely 4S contract here UNLESS West overcalls 1S :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|rodal f: Interesting cards NS|pg||

mb|p|nt|jjsb: but i am pretty sure a lot will find pass or also 1@h |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petergill: and her (relative newcomer, compared to Wang Hongli and Sun Ming) partner Feng Xuefeng is ranked  48 woman in the world due mainly to the win in Philly|pg||

nt|petergill: 2@H shows stopper, hardly even alertable in the modern era, as it is so normal|pg||

mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Often u will drop for 2-2 if u miss QXXX as @C here|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 ended =|pg||
nt|offthebend: Pele didn't Really need to keep the bidding open with that poor 12 points and non working QJ in spades |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@C shows stopper|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 13-15|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: Good lead!|pg||
nt|petergill: I like it - go for the good 4 card suit ahead of the weak longer suit with no entries  - a very sensible thing to try, especially in a match in which your team is the underdog |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT should fail now - on a heart lead, the bold 3NT had some chance. |pg||
nt|jjsb: i am afraid im not sure of there system on 1@c i just that 1@d is expressing a number of point |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 5@D and 3@S both are safe|pg||
nt|petergill: and 3NT I meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: S think 3@S is suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as I was wrong when I belived NS to paly 15-17NT. This is precission and relay or only @D from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: N will bid and show the adwanced que in @S I hope|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: ohh|pg||
nt|rodal f: S can't pass since 2/1 is made|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Declarer might still come to 9 tricks if he plays a heart to the ten|pg||
nt|petergill: which is not impossible|pg||
nt|petergill: only "might" = more likely is -100 or -200|pg||
nt|tejjyid: excellent; East's subsequent 2@H bid will say 6 cards & too weak to open|pg||
pc|c7|nt|offthebend: good stop - this should come to easy 8 tricks unless Heart suit is attacked |pg||
nt|tejjyid: whihc, these days, is pretty weak|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: E thinks that 4@D is strong, slam try. West just bid 4@D as not so strong|pg||
nt|petergill: If @d is trumps, before bidding 4NT, always check if 5@H response takes you past your last safe haven|pg||
nt|rodal f: UPS. THIS CAN COST|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: 1@D can also be controls if they use it for 0-2|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: U meam u have underbidded by ure 16HP? |pg||
nt|twcho: strange not to introduce his 2nd good suit  by south|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South sould have bid that @S suit at some stage though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, over the 1@H; later for the tightrope walkers|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: I think E failed to do so - or perhaps 4NT does not mean what I think it means|pg||
nt|jjsb: with the @c situation this one seems to be an ok contract |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|petergill: anyway, West worked out that this is not a slam auction - else East would bid 4NT earlier - and thus had the commonsense to signoff with her poor hand|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|offthebend: and paula better overtake the second spade in case west ducks twice :)|pg||
nt|jjsb: i am been told its a 0 to 7 |pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: South has a difficult time getting off lead now|pg||
nt|offthebend: still OK |pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: 600 to EW, after an exciting auction|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

nt|offthebend: 4S may have made on a non club lead though |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|offthebend: 5H-1 had to be a loss bec 5S was cold |pg||

mb|2H|nt|petergill: In the Women's, China having won world cahmpionships in 2009 and 2010 are the favourites, with Indonesia some mild danger I guess, and Japan are one of medal contenders. |pg||
nt|petergill: and North could have ducked @CJ|pg||

nt|rodal f: Was the X from W K Lai noted to E?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|offthebend: they have to find a way to cash 4 club tricks after winning a D - to beat 3NT |pg||

pc|h4|nt|petergill: she seems to have 7 tricks even if she loses trump control|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|petergill: the 590 will be just 5 imps to Fr Poly, with @DA the (unapproved, in my opinion) opening lead to 4@s undoubled at the other table|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes CQ is better card and get the encourgement by west|pg||

pc|d9|nt|rodal f: B23 also at the table|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jjsb: i like to have some kind of shortness to play a 21-22 game contract even on 9 card fit ... |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Let them find it and take 1 IMP. 4 @H make risk as I feel it.|pg||
