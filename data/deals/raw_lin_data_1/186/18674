nt|oosb: Very tough hand|pg||
nt|oosb: will make the bulletin if he makes though|pg||
nt|oosb: very nice ending|pg||
nt|paulg:  very little to guide him |pg||
nt|oosb: Bets on A vs 9?|pg||
nt|oosb: I'm with A|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think he's play ace, eventually|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|andyv:  and now to final hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Tom, it's been a pleasure|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice job by Piotr our operator|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|andyv:  and ty to all the specs who have joined us|pg||
nt|ballebodk: same for me ;0)|pg||
nt|ballebodk: let's see if EW can bid 6cl/d ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly good contracts|pg||
nt|vugraphplg: thx, next round in 80 minutes|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder if 2@c is either a xfer or inverted|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@c does go down on @d lead|pg||
nt|ballebodk: should s bid 4 D now - to direct a possible lead ?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ballebodk: well - as written so done ;0)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so down to only one slam:)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|andyv:  when you play with Geir, these bids are 2nd nature|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  is pass forcing here showing a stiff @h?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  EW got tangled up|pg||
nt|andyv:  now a @d lead will set this|pg||
nt|ballebodk: a good agreement but i doubt that they have a clear agreement on it |pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|andyv:  if W dbl showed @ds, then E should have bid 4N or 5@d but E may not be too sure what dbl of 4@d meant|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ballebodk: no FAITH at all - i hope that n will give P a large beer in the bar to night !|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|c8|pc|d4|pg||

pc|c4|nt|andyv:  this defense much too pedestrian for him|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|eamongall: 41 earlier this year .. Wilkpedia |pg||
nt|jbgood: 6@c down on a di ruff - no such thing in 6 @d|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|petergill: Kirsten might even push to the 5 or 6 level in @H|pg||
nt|petergill: though she doesn't bid as free-spiritedly as her husband|pg||
nt|jbgood: kibs tell me that even 5@c sh have been beaten in the CR - and right they are, since Popova made a void showing @d bid|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|eamongall: Team Comhar is Irelands best performing mixed pairs in the recent past |pg||
mb|3H|nt|kastan88: will be very exiting show here, if all the boards are such kind of as in this match|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|petergill: Dbl of @H would have showed 4 or 5 spades, so 1@S probably shows @D or something like that|pg||
mb|5H|nt|eamongall: these guys could be heading to slam in @Cs ... |pg||
nt|jbgood: 1@s either is @d or bal 6-9 - I think, so ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: yeah guess 1@S is @Ds|pg||
nt|petergill: Kirsten decided to get the lead-directing bid in first|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have not agreed any suit, so 4NT was "pick a minor", wasn't it?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|eamongall: yes I now see that ... unlikely to be blackwood|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosb: losing just 2 aces, wonder why only 10 tricks in the other room|pg||
nt|petergill: Will EW get all their tricks again for 500? They surely should. |pg||

nt|petergill: If West bid 6@C, South would have Lightner Doubled, knowing her trusting husbandn would dare not lead anything but a @D (@S cannot be right = no dbl of 6@C, and @H cannot be right, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: so Lightner Dbl must ask for @d lead) and get 500. |pg||
