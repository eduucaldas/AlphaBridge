nt|rodal f: Still an ok sac in 5@H|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|petergill: West knows East has less than 3 hearts, so unless North has 5 or 6 hearts (unlikely?), West has 4 top tricks to 41S|pg||

nt|offthebend: They can make 5S on S finesse and by playing D towards the J |pg||

nt|rodal f: If no screen and pass from NS the TD should be called after the board is finnich.|pg||

nt|rodal f: B26 to make swing it magistern. OR ended 5@C. Will end 11 or 12tr. Here 3NT with @S 2-1 at NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next Round start in 2 hrs.|pg||
nt|offthebend: so lose 2 imps instead of possible gain for australia |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last Board Thank You ALL|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: next Round start in 50 min|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Indonesia - China (Open)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzek: Australia - New Zealand (Lady)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|petergill: Thanks to Chayes Luang-On, our operator who has done a great job, and to the people in Malaysia who make this broadcast from Kuala Lumpur possible|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last board. Ths to Chayes. Exelent vug job. Tks to the specs for all ure inputs. Make u be at the alert. Ths also to Gupta and Ebery by ure nice comments.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
mb|2H|nt|offthebend: thx all |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Patrick Huang did well to find the heart ruff needed to beat 6@C at the other table|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ths for inviting me Chayes. Been nice together with u nice specs:)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|petergill: South might have bid 3@S (not 2@S) at fav vul versus ctrong club (perfect conditions for maximal preempting) as 6-4 (or 6-5) shape is as good as a 7 card suit|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|petergill: and in my opinion N should remove bidding space early by raising spades directly, but his silence might prove golden, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: and so it does!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit diferent style at OR and here. OR 2@S - 4@S. IMPs to Thailand|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 10 imp for Thailand :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: Sucked them in. |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: An interesting point for a partnership to agree on (in advance) - does 3@s allow South to bid 4@s over 4@H, or is the responder to the 2@S preempt in complete charge, with the 2@S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: preempter being a disciplined person who must pass 4@H? China clearly thinks the latter. |pg||
nt|petergill: I think East has bid his hand with 3@S and should Pass 4@S, not double it. Then West will bid 5@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B13 ended 4@H at OR as here|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|petergill: Thanks to our excellent operator Chayes Luang-On for good work. |pg||
pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|petergill: Good smooth duck of @S10|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: Any telltale hesitation on @S10 would have been fatal for the defence|pg||
nt|petergill: Although 6@H makes, there's no advantage, looking at NS's 26 cards, from being in 6@H rather than 6@S, so that was unlucky for NZ |pg||
nt|petergill: A great start for Malaysia to beat one of the stronger teams in the event|pg||
nt|petergill: APBF event's website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round Start in 3o min|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Japan - China (Lady)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the defending champions Chinese Taipei are probably marginal favourites in the Open field, with China not at full strength.|pg||
nt|petergill: in the Women's, China are of course the favourites, though their team roster has changed a bit since their World Championship win|pg||
nt|petergill: See you in about 30 minutes for the next match|pg||
nt|petergill: Website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: but the website does not have any results, so far|pg||
nt|petergill: You have to take into account that Malaysia has only about 100 bridge players, so results might take a little while to appear, with a small number of people doing a lot of work. |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: and that's all today from Kuala Lumpur - there will be 3 more matches tomorrow |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|petergill: 4@S is a good save, so perhaps the first approach is the better one? Or perhaps, South, with 6-4 shape being as good as a 7 card suit, should at fav vul overcall 3@S over 1@H, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: allowing North to take the 4@S save? |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h5|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec told that 2@S is 6@S+ and a opening hand at OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: See u later a time. Non know when:)|pg||
nt|granguru: es la otra patty|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: 6-4 shape is as good as a 7 card suit, just as 7-4 shape is as good as an 8 card suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone. |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round start in 20 min |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: French Polynesia - Chinese Taipei (Open)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|vugraphzek: Thank you All :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: See you tomorrow|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: a Minus 1100 result from a weak NT on Bd 13 has added more relief for French Polynesia|pg||
nt|petergill: so only 18 imps the margin|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye all|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|mc|10|nt|rodal f: The last board at OR ca be a push but belive a gain for the Kiwi|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass around|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next segment start in 40 min|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lots of mistakes (big) but a few less by NZ|pg||
nt|super nova: With the Grand slam in D hand it would have been possible to bid 5nt saying we have all the key cards and the Queen, what do you think of 7.|pg||
nt|super nova: With solid clubs would have been an easy decision.|pg||
