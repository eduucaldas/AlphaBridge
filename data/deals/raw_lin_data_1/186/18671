nt|jtr: was 25-0 for Lavazza|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: on the first 2 boards|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|3H|mb|4H|nt|Walddk6: Team names also wrong. This is actually Versace vs Sonata. They have switched our match C and D|pg||
nt|Walddk6: or Lavazza vs Sonata rather|pg||
nt|jtr: Sonata rather out of tune so far|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont think 4 of either major can make here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|dburn: neither do I, but West thought either that 4@s would make or that 5@h would|pg||
nt|jtr: 5@h seems rather lunatic to me i am afraid|pg||
nt|jtr: Or 'bonkers' as David would say|pg||
nt|dburn: I'm not sure I would have bid 4@h with the East cards either, but certainly West might have considered taking what he could from 4@s|pg||
nt|jtr: I rather liked 4@h|pg||
nt|dburn: would have preferred double, but maybe that would have had some other significance|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|jtr: Rather horrible for declarer|pg||
nt|jtr: Ax@d works best but that is far from obvious|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|h5|pc|s4|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he can do various things and get out for down only one|pg||
nt|jtr: A @c will be disasterous now|pg||
nt|Walddk6: We won't get any comparisons I'm afraid. The tables are not linked after the crash|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he plays flat out, he may go down a lot more than that|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s9|pc|c6|nt|dburn: good decision|pg||
nt|jtr: South has no @c to exit with luckily for declarer|pg||

pc|s2|nt|Walddk6: And the wrong teams in the wrong rooms you can blame on the players who managed to go to the D table instead of C, and vice versa. Tough with the complicated alphabet we have|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|dburn: does D come after C in the Polish alphabet?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: West had the right idea when he didn't lead a heart - unfortunately, a spade also gave a trick|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h2|pc|dK|nt|dburn: mind you, declarer does not know that the club finesse will work - she may try for some squeeze or endplay|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|cT|pc|d7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s7|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn: if she believes, for example, that West has blanked the king of clubs|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|dburn: but now she knows he hasn't - it might have been better to cover that spade|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jtr: Gives declarer another winning option|pg||
