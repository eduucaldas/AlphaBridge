mb|3C|nt|roswolf: but 6@C is no thing of beauty |pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is certainly a normal contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: again all very normal|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pas seems to turn out ok|pg||
nt|brotherp: remarkable decision imo; anyway 2@h will handle nicely also - barring the unfindable trump lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: not really many hands of interest - the dealing computer on strike perhaps!?|pg||
nt|bobholl: paulissen contemplating and still thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: with no poor breaks any reasonable line works|pg||

nt|petepunt: this has been a good come back by fredins team here|pg||
nt|pelu: a biddinbg misunderstand - and unlucky lead chanced 650 to 1090|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not sure east would take out if west stood it - a golden rule seems to be to leave such decisions to the better player(ahem ie the man):)|pg||
nt|pauleger: Team Langer closing the gap|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: this is a bits and pieces hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: more distribution|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|roswolf: this is a Mixed Competition and it has its own dynamics|pg||
nt|pelu: remember Board 17, where u would like W to bid 3@D NF - W in OR could that and are npw playing a hopeless 3@D|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pauleger: E has a normal pass, but E/W are cold for 3NT|pg||
nt|pauleger: good hand for 2 suiters even with 5-4|pg||
mb|4D|nt|brotherp: precision 1@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a direct raise to game isnt stupid|pg||
nt|pelu: I have been told that 1-3 from the group go to A-swiss and 4-6 to B-swiss, then 27 from A and 5 from B to Knock-out - is that correct??|pg||
mb|5C|nt|roswolf: that sounds usual|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Yes|pg||
nt|pelu: wild cards in this sektion|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: the limit for both sides is the 5 level|pg||
mb|5H|nt|brotherp: asking 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: spades a bit unpretty|pg||
nt|pelu: the key-pælay in 4@s in OR was in trick 3 - after 2x@S N played @h7 - and @HK from East - all over|pg||
nt|roswolf: north really cant bid more|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: the rebidable singleton..|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: the vul sac in 6@DX was very tough to find|pg||
nt|pelu: so 6@d x is the par-contract|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: wrong Q by N :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be ok|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brotherp: not so easy to lead @d's now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: now west was -2 elsewhere, how can East do?|pg||
nt|bobholl: e has shown 4414 or 4405 so easy :)|pg||
nt|brotherp: and another lead seems to let the contract through|pg||
nt|pelu: @hQ will defeat 4@s|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and this seems to...|pg||
nt|brotherp: still West passes 3NT knowing the shortness; so club lead looks attractive|pg||
nt|pelu: for me 4@D is not bridge red against green and opp stop in 3@s|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: sorry he made 3@D :(|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ampelman: after the 3@h bid the @hQ lead is too tough to find|pg||
nt|pauleger: 3NT in the open room. Don´t really know, if E showed 14-16 there or upgraded her hand to a 15-17 NT, however, W directly jumped to game|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: 4@H 2@C 3@S may be |pg||
nt|brotherp: small spade or small club both seem attractive|pg||

nt|spooky: like it was 6@S for NS without a @C lead..|pg||

nt|roswolf: this could be bloody if someone gets too frisky|pg||
nt|petepunt: however would have bid 2@D first time|pg||
nt|roswolf: last bd|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: nice slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: agree, Peter, 4@D now is a gamble - almost like all-in|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@S - 2NT = invit with 4+@s for sure 3@H cant be naturel|pg||
nt|ampelman: 9 tricks for NS in a @h contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: inverted raise to start with?|pg||
nt|ampelman: splinter bid ?|pg||
nt|pauleger: Last board of the match coming up. Play will resume in 35 minutes according to the bulletin. Thx all for watching and BBO for making this possible :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petepunt: prefer to be able to bid 1n with wests cards|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: strong cub|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bid it?|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|bobholl: jan (jansma) asks why east thougth so long :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should raise the ante|pg||

nt|roswolf: 4@C cue?|pg||
nt|pauleger: interesting 3@c bid|pg||
nt|pauleger: propably a good @d raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt seems fairly cold for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 1086 a stop!?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|roswolf: north gets that sinking feeling|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: West found partner with what West could expect - a bog-standard weak no trump with two low spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's not a great 11 count with KQ doubleton|pg||
mb|5C|nt|petepunt: its a shocking 11 count :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ok spade cue|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@d is minimum, I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C or 4@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pauleger: if W has AJ here, you should not put in the @s K here|pg||
nt|pelu: still hard fight for the first 3 places in this group: 62-61-60-60-57-54 VP's|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pauleger: a hand, where it is good to lead 2nd from 4 small|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brotherp: finally an easy hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: blood will flow|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: NOW 4NT|pg||
nt|pauleger: with stiff @dQ it looked obvious to swith to @h|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bobholl: they play polish @C so N knows S is strong |pg||
nt|bobholl: jan is thinking long not normal for him|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D by default|pg||
nt|roswolf: everyone is pointing out that by ducking a spade 3nt is defeated - in practicethat means a small spade lead from north which might well not be found|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: not that easy he still has got a lot of losing @D|pg||
nt|brotherp: not knowing the friendly distribution though Schollaard will spend some time figuring out the savest way|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|ampelman: 4@h was the bid east wanted to here|pg||
