nt|oliverc: A@D after the A@H and then lead Ace and a small @S. If South wins, more likely to|pg||
nt|oliverc: find the A@C with North and South might have been endplayed anyway|pg||
nt|brotherp: funny result in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: weak nt or maybe upgraded because of the nice features|pg||
nt|brotherp: tactical decision needed by East|pg||
nt|brotherp: 3@d anyone?|pg||
nt|bobholl: marion thinks long :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure...and an unusual aution in other room|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|roswolf: a good weak 2?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good player, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|brotherp: dbl showing a 4 card major and a longer minor; quite a common treatment in NL|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the slam zone just about|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brotherp: 3@d now ?!|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess marion will bid 3@D now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: but 6@C is no thing of beauty |pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is certainly a normal contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: again all very normal|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pas seems to turn out ok|pg||
nt|brotherp: remarkable decision imo; anyway 2@h will handle nicely also - barring the unfindable trump lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: not really many hands of interest - the dealing computer on strike perhaps!?|pg||
nt|bobholl: paulissen contemplating and still thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: with no poor breaks any reasonable line works|pg||
nt|roswolf: still he has to plan for a rainy day|pg||
nt|bobholl: he has only 9 tricks if everything breaks without a @D ruff so i guess he'll try that|pg||
nt|bobholl: gib says 11 tricks but he sees 52 cards (just like we :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably cdonsidering the diamond guess|pg||

nt|brotherp: 5@d really in the picture now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a big swing in B3: in OR Fredin-Michielsen stopped in 4@H with 13 tricks from top in 7NT - the problem: a 2@C opening - also calles the "slam-killer" :)|pg||
nt|ampelman: X=points|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brotherp: well a @c lead would sink 5@d ...and North might have started with @c Ace |pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w seem to have bid recklessly here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: yes, as spec says ...|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @D was the contract to be in but paulissens pass is understandable|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and another spec points out the attractions of 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D goes down also on 3@C |pg||
nt|brotherp: in the end the 4@H contract in the open room was made because North continued spades when in with the @hA|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C disappearing on @D|pg||
nt|brotherp: with South holding 3@d's that was just enough|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: can be made on a minor suit squeeze i think|pg||

nt|bobholl: 6@D easier|pg||
nt|roswolf: might bid a grand i suppose|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: 7@D CAN be made by the backward finesse in trumps which pins the 10 +9|pg||
