nt|stc: This may be an oportunity to recover some IMP|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hej Hans!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also in the 1st segment, one pair played 4 NT. Up here north, 4 nt is rarely for playing|pg||
nt|jbennet: h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hej Ralf|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ...also|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|stc: This is a point to discuss : after transfer is 4NT still inviting or not ?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jbennet: nja hard to see who good pairs can bypass 4h. misfit early diagnosed|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: in my opinion - yes. quantitative|pg||
nt|stc: everything on side for NS, switch A@d and K@s and ....|pg||

nt|patricck: EW need to lead spades to stop 10 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|patricck: but NS probably won't bid that far|pg||
nt|patricck: weclome Constantin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: Hello Everybody. Players are ready. Let's go!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: Hello everybody. The players are seated. We are starting.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Tony |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: Players are ready.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|wilkinsona: ..and a nice missfit to start us off|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|legend114: Hi everybody|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|daman: 3@C is a form of Bergen?|pg||
nt|patricck: bergen raise I presume|pg||
nt|stc: yes, inverted, the strong one|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Tom, welcome|pg||
nt|sybarra: from previous session,  we have seen E be very creative |pg||
mb|3D|nt|patricck: I think that should help East find the winning spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: I expect 4@h|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|stc: I trump lead will give the contract|pg||
nt|patricck: Partner didn't want to double 3@C for the lead, so I would exclude that suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @s takes the bid away from E and also is a ht raise |pg||
mb|3N|nt|stc: now he can also make|pg||
nt|patricck: that will give the contract as well|pg||
nt|daman: the @H 5 could be an entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: I don't understand this play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, I am temporarly rooting for the NS pair, as I like close matches|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|sybarra: welcome back to tom fenwich,  (aka legend)  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: hi tom|pg||
nt|legend114: Hi everybody again|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this lead gives south every chance|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|patricck: While bergen can be useful it allows the person who won;t be on lead to send a message to partner by doubling or failing to double the bergen bid. In this case East paid ...|pg||
nt|patricck: insufficient attention to the negative inference|pg||
nt|stc: he gives defense a second chance|pg||
nt|legend114: the limit for both sides is 9 tricks, unless South can get a D ruff. Unlikely. |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: wher do you start?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: with diamonds?  or hearts|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|patricck: as well as letting them take a club ruff if the clubs had been 4-2|pg||
nt|stc: and they take it|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: not sure they have the timing for the ruff |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: So far so good for the declarer|pg||
nt|legend114: I believe he played correctly|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I was playing 3 nt perhaps I should get another cup of coffee|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I am not intending to be critical of wests choice|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..I was rooting for NS|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: they might now |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: or not|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: he just went down in a cold contract|pg||
pc|h7|nt|stc: A possible swing for Ribitas, 4@h is normal and not easy to beat|pg||
nt|patricck: it wouldn't have helped but declarer could have improved his chances when spades were 4-2 by ducking one round|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
nt|stc: ofn course, defense may cash @s's and @cs|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i guess overcalling 1@s was not such a great idea|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It wins actually, but @D K might be on-side|pg||

nt|sybarra: OT= over trick |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: I don't know about 4@H being normal on a combined 20 HCP, but they may well bid it in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 clubs? |pg||
mb|1H|nt|stc: Nor mal because the others play also Bergen - N knowing 9 - 11 points and fit will also bid 4|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|sybarra: looking at it more,  not sure it can ever be made |pg||
nt|legend114: Unlucky here not to make 6C with the 3-0 trump break. I have seen worse grand slams!!! |pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello|pg||
nt|henryb:  Tom!|pg||
nt|sybarra: you see Tom,   you mention Henry, and here he is!|pg||
nt|legend114: Hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|patricck: 3@C on that bunch of queens and jacks?  surely not?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and its Q10x |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: point counter|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|stc: anyway he pushed EW too high |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and fast arrival  should go all pass |pg||
nt|legend114: JJ Dousse must have been watching Caponi/Piedra to overcall 1S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb:  Is that standard Swiss? to evercall with the N hand and not to raise immediately with the S hand?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: but e/w may not be finished |pg||
nt|sybarra: but they are |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|stc: but not best lead....|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|legend114: I wonder if E-W's aggressive bidding did not keep N-S- out of a losing slam|pg||
pc|s4|nt|patricck: still too high as long as the defence steer clear of playing @D|pg||
nt|stc: hard to undestand this lead, my choice was between @c and trump|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|legend114: There is no standard Swiss as far as I know. |pg||
nt|sybarra: q of hts trying for the illusion |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  So this will drift off one|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|patricck: yes, only Kxxx, which you imply with the double. Partner doesn't bid @S and then you lead them anyway|pg||
nt|stc: caponi will try to build a sqz|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: good queston |pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: *question |pg||
pc|s7|nt|stc: S must discard @s|pg||
nt|daman: no squeeze here|pg||
nt|daman: psuedo squeeze only|pg||
nt|stc: sure not, but they must be careful in defense|pg||
nt|patricck: South could have the Q@D J@S and J@C, that would leave room for the A@D in North|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|c3|nt|stc: Note that S may have KJ of S, so well played by E|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|stc: in this case they will be a true sqz|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
mc|7|nt|legend114: you'll agree, it's commendable (or inspired?) to bid only 2S when your partner overcalls vul.|pg||

nt|stc: K of @d may be onside but 4 times |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Right you are|pg||
nt|stc: anyway 7 more IMP for the leading team|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  How can one bid 2 @D with this North hand???|pg||
nt|hedyg: 42 imps..|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: and 20 boards only left|pg||
nt|jbennet: 20 boards to do and 42 IMP:s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: still possible:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: if you believe in miracles|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  But not this board wil make the swift|pg||
nt|stc: Ribitas lost only 26 IMPs in 27 boards, a very good result|pg||
nt|jbennet: its soon time to take out the goolkeeper (and the rest of the defence line too)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and half of that was on the 1st board at this table|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|jbennet: well dont know if that was normal.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But better play should be to take the Ace and play a small - no change here|pg||
mc|10|pg||
qx|c27|st||md|1SQJT972HAQ53DAC63,S543HK762DKJ96CJ7,SAK6HJ98DT543CAT5,S8HT4DQ872CKQ9842|sv|o|nt|stc: and first slam hand|pg||
nt|legend114: Jean Besse used to say, "chatter, chatter, it helps the opponents." That was 30 years ago! Times have changed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and since everyone bids on "air" these days.....|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|daman: all roads lead to 3NT on this one|pg||
nt|henryb:  Actually, I think it would be even better to bid 2@h the first time and get the opponents to the 3 level|pg||
mb|3N!|an|3!s 12-14 no single|nt|wilkinsona: yes, indeed (i couldn't have found that pass)|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  As far as I have seen, very few Scots can find the pass card in their bidding box :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I'm assuming 3N is a balanced raise, perhaps|pg||
mb|4D|nt|stc: 12 tricks if you stretch|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 6NT romps home if it is bid. Basically it is a 50% slam, just solely on the postioion of the K@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was going to ask the experts, do you want to play 3 nt or 4 @S, |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: sorry I would be looking for 4 sp with the stiff ace of @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: and 4 tricks in @c|pg||
nt|stc: so not quite 50%|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, 3N has the advantage of 9 top tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: and who said, if you can play and make 3 nt....  (hammond?)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: 11 no more nor less|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this has plenty tricks now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|legend114: but 4S has 10 and a got shot for 11.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|daman: they will not bid any slam|pg||
nt|patricck: less than 50% I guess, but 4 tricks in clubs not that crucial, it needs the K@S and then either short K@S (so 4 spades) or J@C dropping (so 4 @C) or if they don't work then try the ...|pg||
nt|patricck: @D finesse|pg||
nt|daman: he lied about his opener to begin|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: he was never going to accept any invites|pg||
nt|daman: this was never a slam hand|pg||
nt|stc: he already upgraded his hand when opening 2NT|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but once South has stretched to a 2NT opener North might not have only invited|pg||
nt|stc: you never played slams at 45% ?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: just sort of pesky that spades are not 2/2 |pg||
pc|s6|pc|c2|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: not sure this is going to very challenging for declarer |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|stc: he will not be happy when this wins|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h8|nt|patricck: that is of course a slight stretch as well, but we have all seen two way stretches before :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|stc: the two way stretch was worth 6 IMPs, the card play ruined it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: they don't have the benefit of seeing all 4 hands like we do     we have to predict the evenual outcome as opposed to double dummy contracts|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems like we will see a claim shortly  |pg||
pc|s9|pc|d6|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: well I was wrong|pg||

nt|hedyg: certainly not better|pg||
nt|stc: why normal ? what about small to the J ? anyway you can't loose more than 2 tricks...|pg||
nt|jbennet: to play the defender with 3 spades to have length in hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You are right, there are 3 possible @H-loosers|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes Johan of course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  but - how|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Taking the Ace wins with any K or 10 single, or one of them second by West|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbennet: so the favourite was playing east for 10 of hearts ; and the favourite won. |pg||
pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  "He" often wing, johan|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  wins|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|stc: once again : small to the J and if you win we can r home; if you loose you give also the 10|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jbennet: so the proper way was to draw trumps ending in dummy and run heart 8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  Yes - but that was not part of this game|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: not happy, sitting for 1 level doubles  with that suit  |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: EW are not making it easy|pg||
nt|daman: North should give a nudge with 4@D|pg||
nt|stc: is 3@d here enough ?|pg||
nt|daman: sure|pg||
nt|patricck: NS didn't stretch to the thin 4@H on board 1, so a quiet 6 imps there and then they bid 1NT without a @H stop on board 2 and failed by 4 tricks for -400 and 10 imps away|pg||
nt|stc: but you also have @c to play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgu: Sorry no alert!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: gag|pg||
nt|sybarra: how many diamonds  cna |pg||
nt|legend114: double dummy, 3NT played by North, but I don't see how they can get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: * can we make?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: E is endplayed everytim in |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well a heart lead would have ditched this, but north is playing catch up here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how many times do you lead from 10xxxx with no entry?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if he wins this he won't get in again|pg||
nt|legend114: of course, declarer will finesse the DJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: and even if E wins this,  what does he lead? |pg||
nt|sybarra: spade back to no avail |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if East wins south will make 12 on any return|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|daman: if South had @Hs he would have doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: should bring this one home |pg||
nt|sybarra: might even find an OT |pg||
nt|legend114: green v. red, pass by North had was not a bad choice|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|stc: Note that EW play a system where they may open 1@c with doubleton|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||

nt|legend114: henry, when you say "basically minimum", does that mean it's more than a minimum?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|granguru: he is very creative..we almost won a BOLS with one of his hands|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|henryb:  It means that in the context of 12-15, 15-18, and 18-20, his hand is in the 12-15 range. At the top of it, especially with three aces and two 10s, but still in that range|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: we will now find out whether best to play this from E or W |pg||
nt|granguru: 2@h or 2@s plays a little better than 1NT|pg||
nt|granguru: but just a little|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|patricck: 3@C also fails, so no really good option. Passing 2NT with a 6 card suit is almost always wrong because you seldom make exactly 8 tricks....yes I know it probably works out on this ...|pg||
nt|patricck: hand|pg||
nt|stc: considering @d ?|pg||
