nt|kastan88: I have not got to play against Erik "Silla" this year, but year ago had some chances to direct at table, if he called TD, that's why i am saying "good friend"|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jpmbs: I think Drijver-Brink are favorites, other 2 pairs will be exciting|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|paulg:  doesn't it need a club lead to break 4@h?|pg||

pc|s3|nt|kastan88: doubling and curtains, I would not bid 5@S more after 2@H overcall|pg||

nt|eamongall: but he is suffering from a lack of @Ds |pg||

nt|jbgood: EW were already at an uncomfortable level - and the old saying that the 5 level belongs to the opps is still valid from time to time|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|paulg:  no, even if you guessed the spades the defence has time to remove dummy's entry|pg||
nt|jpmbs: he will just try the finesses|pg||
nt|oosb: well the 1@D bid does suggest where the Kings are|pg||

nt|petergill: Claim was probably 490 not 460 then, as there were 12 tricks |pg||

nt|paulg:  Jansma probably thinking he needs the spade finesse to work|pg||
nt|jbgood: another time relevant to play the singleton in opps second suit... but not too late|pg||

nt|oosb: OR @D 4-4 an @H 3-3 |pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|an|majors 4+/4+|nt|psridhar: my concept is to be very accurate -no deviation at all- in 2nd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: this 2@c on 6-4 a lop sided divide ?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: opp 3-2 i want pd to pick @h not @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|psridhar: however it ends well for NS in 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  North takes the low road|pg||
nt|psridhar: ventos needs to suggest both minor by 2N|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|psridhar: we r not sure -if 2N asked W to pick minor OR leb type ask for 3@c|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|psridhar: watever it may mean, Khandelwal is heading to a big loss|pg||
nt|psridhar: tightening the gap|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3nt can make for 9 imps away|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|psridhar: so Khandelwal wins 18 imps to 11 Imps may be 18-12 on VP scale|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well done to reach 3N as the cards lie|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||

nt|jcomyn: wouldnt fool the cat|pg||
nt|mcsd: NS are in momentum|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: 41 earlier this year .. Wilkpedia |pg||
nt|jbgood: 6@c down on a di ruff - no such thing in 6 @d|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: Kirsten might even push to the 5 or 6 level in @H|pg||
nt|petergill: though she doesn't bid as free-spiritedly as her husband|pg||
nt|jbgood: kibs tell me that even 5@c sh have been beaten in the CR - and right they are, since Popova made a void showing @d bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|eamongall: Team Comhar is Irelands best performing mixed pairs in the recent past |pg||
mb|3H|nt|kastan88: will be very exiting show here, if all the boards are such kind of as in this match|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Dbl of @H would have showed 4 or 5 spades, so 1@S probably shows @D or something like that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: p p x|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: these guys could be heading to slam in @Cs ... |pg||
nt|jbgood: 1@s either is @d or bal 6-9 - I think, so ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: yeah guess 1@S is @Ds|pg||
nt|petergill: Kirsten decided to get the lead-directing bid in first|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have not agreed any suit, so 4NT was "pick a minor", wasn't it?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: x is automatic|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|eamongall: yes I now see that ... unlikely to be blackwood|pg||
nt|petergill: Jeanette might dbl for t/io|pg||
nt|petergill: converted to penalty|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosb: losing just 2 aces, wonder why only 10 tricks in the other room|pg||
nt|petergill: Will EW get all their tricks again for 500? They surely should. |pg||
nt|mcsd: welcome Petrer :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: prefer X with s hand giving p option|pg||
nt|petergill: hi Miroslav and John|pg||
nt|mcsd: i dont think it was fot T/O - proposal may be|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi mate|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|petergill: South being a passed hand has really shown 4-6 in majors, otherwise her initial Pass makes no sense|pg||
nt|mcsd: now @D leads from w seems best|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mcsd: forsing defence|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: so North, if he truly trusts partner, could run to 3@S, knowing spades must break 3-2 on EW's auction|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree should do somthing since s originally passed|pg||
nt|mcsd: but w may have 4@S?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: hardly when bidding 3d|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|oosb: not a useful Ruff & discard|pg||
nt|mcsd: e bidded 3@D W may have 4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h5|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|petergill: It's very much Jeanette's Reitzer's style to Dbl for t/o a lot with a singleton under (i.e. on the right of) the bidder - her old partner the late Ted Chadwick encouraged this ...|pg||
nt|petergill: winning style of bidding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh yes of course|pg||
nt|mcsd: Now S has same trump length as W|pg||
nt|mcsd: anyruff made by s is critical|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a very unnecessary big peanlty for s i think|pg||
nt|mcsd: That is forsing defence all about.|pg||
nt|petergill: only 300|pg||
nt|petergill: @s, @C, @D ruff and @s exit will be the play, for 300|pg||
pc|hT|nt|eamongall: 3 imps to Team Bailey|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: Next mach will start at 3 pm|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all - enjoyable bridge!|pg||
nt|petergill: If West bid 6@C, South would have Lightner Doubled, knowing her trusting husbandn would dare not lead anything but a @D (@S cannot be right = no dbl of 6@C, and @H cannot be right, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: so Lightner Dbl must ask for @d lead) and get 500. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bulletin 1 at http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Poznan/Bulletins/bul01.pdf|pg||
nt|eamongall: Hilmo is indicating 5@Cs was beaten in other room |pg||
nt|petergill: Results at http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|eamongall: but vugraph shows a @HK lead |pg||
nt|mcsd: Be carefull when having singleton trump not to lead it  |pg||
nt|petergill: Oops!|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mcsd: now @D again ad...|pg||
nt|petergill: 500 now|pg||
nt|mcsd: a @S may be good|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: @H play by South was error, had to simply take her tricks and get trump in ending|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how often u take your eye off the ball when u realise u are in  a very bad contract|pg||
nt|petergill: 800 if she finesses, 500 if she does not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: like in golf - take your medicine and get out of there|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oosb: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|paulg:  playing safely, unsurprisingly|pg||
nt|petergill: 300 if she doesn't finesse|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mcsd: she must take A@S and discard @S on @c T|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: as West has one too many trumps and will be endplayed|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oosb: too safely.|pg||
nt|oosb: overcomplicated it|pg||

nt|eamongall: a team called Blue Rose in the same group as this got hit for 81 imps bya team called Manno|pg||
nt|eamongall: Ha ..Krytoff Martens is part of Mano |pg||
nt|eamongall: 3 boards still to score here including decent looking results on 8 and 9 for Team 8|pg||
nt|eamongall: oops the vuraph boss is going to shut us down |pg||
nt|kastan88: ty Eamonn for comments, and tx to our operator Joanna. Kibbitzers ---> pls to open room|pg||
nt|eamongall: Team Banzai from Ireland got battered by strong Norwegians including Geir Helgemo .. by 46 imps |pg||
nt|eamongall: boards 8 and 9 did materialize as decent results for Team Comhar |pg||
nt|kastan88: so 17:13 in VP for Helness/Brogeland team|pg||

nt|mcsd: :)|pg||
nt|mcsd: tis can cost a lot Imps|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I've been commentating a lot at the Asia Pacific Championships this week, so i'm not used to this ping pong style of card play that happens in Europe.|pg||
nt|mcsd: :)|pg||
nt|mcsd: more interesting this way|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true gives us more to talk about|pg||
nt|mcsd: The best jankova ken get is 14 points, if tahy play say 2@s and make|pg||
nt|mcsd: no E-W play 3nt|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 29, South at the other table didn't try the "only chance" defence that was found at this table - the hand where Reitzer hoped for blocked hearts if South had @HKxx|pg||
nt|petergill: so Smederevac gets Gold Award on Bd 29 for top defence (and nice @HA falsecard by North) then No Gold for her on Bd 30|pg||
