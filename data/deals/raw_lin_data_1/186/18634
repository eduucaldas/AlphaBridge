nt|jcwla: So here we go with a big @C opening, what is the double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looked like majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  this would explain S taking so long over 2@s|pg||

pc|h8|nt|rodal f: Over for cross ruffs?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By @H as the start|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|petergill: The bidding and play (@CK unblock = doubleton) indicate that clubs are 7-2. Thus declarer expects some bad breaks in other suits. |pg||
nt|petergill: when China lost the 2008 World Championship final by one imp, excellent Chinese people like Jack Zhao consoled them by telling them that he would help them become champions in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2009, correctly as it turned out|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzek: oh|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: Let us say, it would take exceedingly friendly defense to bring home 4@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  since 4@h dbld can go for 300-500, the cost isn't that cheap|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: I can see 9 tricks, but declarer needs friendlier spades, I think|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|dT|pc|s7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|petergill: A good general principle is: never overruff with ace from Axx or Axx in trumps, usually ok to overruff with bare ace or Ax in trumps. |pg||
nt|petergill: West now hopes @HQ drops doubleton then @CJ drops singleton under @CQ, about a one in a million chance. |pg||

pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: @CK play at Trick 1 was too revealing to declarer. Better to play small on the club lead, then the king on the 2nd round of clubs might be from Kxx - less revealing to declarer|pg||

nt|petergill: His coach Patrick Huang would be proud of his play. |pg||

nt|rodal f: Normaly 4@H also would be home. Only a @D lead from E to beat it.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  one of the problems with the weak hand making a decision at the 5 level|pg||
nt|petergill: No double, so only 50's = no big deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ns better be caredul.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Regardless of the level S chose (and made a choice here that worked out great), showing the majors and then bidding @H's did show the nature of the hand well.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Jed and C Wu are Defending Champions in this event - they won last year, after much training by Patrick. |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|rodal f: All with a good color exsept N who will become the boss|pg||

mb|2C|nt|petergill: I might have rebid only 2@D, not liking my Jx in RHO's suit nor my bare ace, but I think most people would rebid 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: 3D must be a Limit raise or better Bergan raise |pg||

nt|jcwla: Hmm...usually 1@D does not include a 5-card M, no?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 1@D showed spades, 9-13 hcp|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty Steve:)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|petergill: 7@D, needing 4-3 @H's or short @HK, is a good spot if NS are silent, but not quite so good once NS have bid  |pg||
nt|petergill: This contract looks likely to fail, but you never know|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|petergill: Wang Hogn Li worked out that her very bad heart pips would make 2@H difficult to play, opposite a void or singleton @H.|pg||
nt|petergill: Hong Li|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  would 2@h over 2@c have been forcing or not?|pg||

nt|jcwla: A third-seat weak 2 perhaps for those playing them.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: another interesting hand - 6@D being very aggressive, 3NT being normal|pg||
nt|petergill: China's losses to Japan and Thailand might be explained by China not being at full strength this year|pg||

nt|tejjyid: I like to bid here, as East, because I hate balancing|pg||
mb|2H|an|0-6|nt|offthebend: and most likely a C lead and 11 tricks |pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT forcing for a round Chayes?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: defenetly it wins|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6-4 is always a good shape, even if the texture of the 6 card suit is a bit shaky|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth could try 3@C here, if that's invivtaioal and South has confirmed a @C suit|pg||

nt|rodal f: Thailand killed from a slam? Let's ee what OR will do|pg||
nt|jcwla: Gives the opponents an extra round of room to maneuver.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: After 9 rounds, China leads the Women's event by 31 VPs from Japan, Chinese Taipei and Indonesia, who are all close together|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: I agree with Sun Ming - @H10 (the great heart suit) makes 3@H a better rebid than 3NT (only one stop in @C) or 3@S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  if they can unscramble their tricks, 2@h should have gone down 1|pg||

mb|1D|nt|offthebend: D partial for EW if they can find it |pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: Only about 100 to 200 bridge players in Malaysia, so not many volunteers to do the hard work, so do not expect instant updates of websites|pg||
nt|rodal f: At B1 OR are playing 4@H and not 3NT= as here.|pg||
mb|r|nt|petergill: Splinter|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: 6@H is not a great contract, and of course would fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B1 sold at the mol. 4@HN= here and 3@DW at OR.|pg||
nt|jcwla: And one more overtrick IMP on 2.|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: rather sensible contract on a 9 card fit on board 1 :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3-card raises are awkward after a X for most pairs|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: It would be a major triumph to reach 6@D here|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C splinter? |pg||
nt|petergill: South ranked  1 female in the world, North ranked  4, and Gu at other table ranked  2 female in the world, in WBF rankings|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I don't like XX in case the auction gets pre-empted, but in practice i vaery rarely does, so you get to bid the hand this way|pg||
nt|petergill: Gu Ling's partner took a break of about 10 years from international bridge, then won the World Championship in Philadelphia last year, so is ranked "only" about  46. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@SX costs 500, but EW probably would bid on to 5@H. |pg||
nt|offthebend: any EXCUSE to open or overcall these days |pg||
nt|kerasidis: so the only forcing bid over overcall is double?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: whihc is very convenient|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yet again S treats the hand as both M's despite the large discrepancy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@S, bidding around the singleton, is preferred|pg||
nt|petergill: Now 4@D?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Guess was old fashioned treatment of "double for the majors" over the big club, so an easy 4@S call for N|pg||
nt|petergill: North follows the Kit Woolsey approach of getting in and doubling early with 12+ and 4333 shape|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kerasidis: or maybe jumbing|pg||
nt|andyv:  it worked the first time so why not?:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: E bid his colors and don't care the 2@S from S?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kerasidis: even if the dont lead dia i can not see 5 making|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's not a horrible treatment as long as the dbler has about equal majors or a stand along major (like the previous auction)..here, dbld has simply a good hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Redbl 10+, then East's Dbl take-out (a non-standard treatment), converted to penatly|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: I'm not a big fan of too many lead-directing doubles - they tend to advise the opponents that their values are in the right places, as here |pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid by French Polynesia|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: May we say that a 3NT might is lost. Bit hard for EW here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: they will have chance later also|pg||

pc|h2|nt|petergill: Once against, I would double 1@H on West cards (along with a majority of experts, surely), but the Indonesian youngsters prefer to overcall their five card suit. |pg||

nt|petergill: 3@SX is worth only 500, not 800, for NS|pg||

nt|rodal f: So 15-17NT for NS and a easy push|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|offthebend: yes 2H showed 5 cards in S |pg||
nt|tejjyid: and East couldn't find a raise? Maybe East's @C's were so good he thought the X meant something else|pg||
nt|petergill: in case East has Qxx|pg||

pc|s5|nt|rodal f: OK. So not 16+ as I wait for at 1@C prec variant|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kiwi_joker: Yes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: Here there's a useful card and a ruffing value to go with the four small.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: Just a question of how many 50's this contract fails by, given the misfit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Declarer's @D's will serve as trump substitutes, and the @S pips prevent the defence getting 3@S tricks|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|petergill: In Round 1, Board 16 contributed to some upset results, with a good slam bid by the good teams failing due to a bad break|pg||

nt|vugraphzek: thinking . .  .|pg||
nt|petergill: though there is a big worry that at the unfav vulnerability, West may have @DKx or bare @D king|pg||
nt|petergill: but Japanese women tend not to worry all that much about vulnerability and bid 3@S anyway, no on 2nd thought, Japanese players are very disciplined in the bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: surely Sun Ming knows this EW better than I do|pg||
nt|petergill: East is a well-known fairly famous player, but I don't know much about West|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|petergill: Sun Ming rarely (almost never) lets you down |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|kiwi_joker: It's a vul game, after all. Big payout chance vs small chance of -1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: the heart break will lead her to count West as 7123 shape|pg||

nt|offthebend: everybody UPGRADES these days 14 into 15 , 15 into 16 :)|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|petergill: you have to be a very good player to do things like that - the mundane average players just take the @D finesse, in their innocence |pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit strange that they want the contract over to the weak hand?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i do see an other swing here for ew|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: If East plays a spade, West has to duck|pg||

nt|tejjyid: so far, nice bidding|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|petergill: North (whose @D pip at Trick 2 suggested 5 @D's) is known to have 5 @D and 3 @H (no 1@h bid), thus some risk of club and @d overruffs. |pg||

mb|p|nt|jjsb: a really weird situation|pg||

nt|kerasidis: yes wd|pg||
nt|twcho: one may have to discuss whether transfer is still on here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 2nt attacking bid ..wild|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are probably on our way to 3@D here.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|petergill: 1NT weak, Dbl pen, Rdbl = long minor|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: West knows East has less than 3 hearts, so unless North has 5 or 6 hearts (unlikely?), West has 4 top tricks to 41S|pg||
nt|petergill: to 4@S I mean|pg||
nt|offthebend: They can make 5S on S finesse and by playing D towards the J |pg||
nt|rodal f: By that long thinking if no screens W have problem to bid. |pg||
nt|rodal f: But can tey take the safe income?|pg||
nt|jjsb: some in the audience  point out 1nt can only be made if junior :) not sure about that :) |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: On for a new push it seems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Tommy:)|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|twcho: NS is probably the top pair of HK|pg||
nt|kerasidis: about a weak ago ...i saw a very expeirienced pair misunderstanding their bid upon overcall on 1nt opening|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 16 imps lost|pg||
nt|twcho: and they are very aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi tommy|pg||
nt|twcho: hi dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|rodal f: B4 OR ended 3@HN. Here it was 5@DE= IMPs for Thailand.|pg||
nt|twcho: so one have to agree explicitly with partner when the transfer is still on  or not|pg||
nt|twcho: sell out to 3H with 7411?|pg||
nt|twcho: too cheap indeed|pg||
nt|kerasidis: of course...but there are some many difficulties yet to deal with|pg||
nt|rodal f: Cheep or cheap. I love the speciality made by cheep's:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can dbl here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so I think the odds massively favour a penalty dbl of 4@s on the West cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like the BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php    = til B20|pg||
nt|jjsb: a pass folloxed by a bid is normally stronger than initial overcal |pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes cheep endeed especially when partner showed values|pg||
nt|petergill: Rdbl = long suit not clubs (would bid 2@C with clubs)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Presumably XX was forced and 2@d showed @d and a major|pg||
nt|henryb:  you see, sorry, Peter and I disagree|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Do they play with screens?|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4Sx in a limited system and a known 10 card H fit is a bit surprising |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: sceen|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: screen|pg||
nt|jjsb: i still admit , i can see with that hand why i dont want to play a strong club ..|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's hand a bit difficult to evaluate but a 10 count does deserve more than a suit preference|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: +3 and next|pg||
nt|jjsb: the idea if opening 1@c with N is kinda scaring me ...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: so I was unfair to South - her line of play is perhaps best|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have played @HK at Trick 2, in case partner's heart was singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: then switched to clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: The low heart play shows that they have 100% faith in partner's count card at Trick 1|pg||
nt|jjsb: but of course not saying its bad !!! of course it can be more than helpfull in a lot of situation |pg||
nt|rodal f: Good news. Not at the @H trap. Sad news, could get some more income.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: If no screen and pass from NS the TD should be called after the board is finnich.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: That looks more like it. |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|offthebend: 5H can be made by playing Clubs early and guessing the C J otherwise one down |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Then might harder for call the TD.|pg||
nt|andyv:  despite the sterile nature of his hand, 3@d was a reasonable alternative|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|petergill: I wondered why Pass was (possibly) not alerted|pg||
pc|c6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|petergill: with 2/1 GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_S.pdf|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: so all the bids after 1@S were forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough problem for West; I would have made a pre-emptive @C raise on the 1st round & Perhaps X is better than 2@H|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: @CK onside  so no problems|pg||
nt|henryb:  Playing "DONT" runouts has become fairly common|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jjsb: will play AK of @h now i guess|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jjsb: and then +1 or = depends of where he will try to throw the @c |pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||

nt|petergill: might have to cash a heart before playing trumps in the scenario I was describing|pg||
nt|petergill: then +100|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 at OR: 3NT as here Here was 9 tr|pg||
nt|jjsb: i guess if u ask what to open with East u will have a lot of options|pg||
nt|jjsb: depending ur style |pg||
nt|jjsb: im personally a 2@h opening |pg||
nt|jcwla: NZ on the board with 1 on 7 (130 vs. 100)|pg||
nt|petergill: but 3@C P 5@C doesn't cost much, even if 4@S fails - especially if East leads a @D to 5@C|pg||
nt|petergill: or East might lead a club to 5@C|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|offthebend: likely 4S contract here UNLESS West overcalls 1S :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so this must show something besides @s:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Completing the @D-@S inversion.|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|rodal f: Interesting cards NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next Round Indonesia - China (Open)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or @sA and a @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: but i am pretty sure a lot will find pass or also 1@h |pg||
nt|petergill: 11C Precision |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S balanced, 8+ HCP|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|petergill: and her (relative newcomer, compared to Wang Hongli and Sun Ming) partner Feng Xuefeng is ranked  48 woman in the world due mainly to the win in Philly|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D inverted, forcing|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H shows stopper, hardly even alertable in the modern era, as it is so normal|pg||
nt|rodal f: B20 will become a =|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr 1 IMP for China|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS have any agreements in place, 2@s, 3@s and 4@s should all be natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  and use the @d suit for cue bidding purposes|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H 5+ @H, 16+ HCP|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|rodal f: Often u will drop for 2-2 if u miss QXXX as @C here|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 ended =|pg||
nt|offthebend: Pele didn't Really need to keep the bidding open with that poor 12 points and non working QJ in spades |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@C shows stopper|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 13-15|pg||
mb|3D|nt|petergill: Good lead!|pg||
nt|petergill: I like it - go for the good 4 card suit ahead of the weak longer suit with no entries  - a very sensible thing to try, especially in a match in which your team is the underdog |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT should fail now - on a heart lead, the bold 3NT had some chance. |pg||
nt|jjsb: i am afraid im not sure of there system on 1@c i just that 1@d is expressing a number of point |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 5@D and 3@S both are safe|pg||
nt|petergill: and 3NT I meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: S think 3@S is suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as I was wrong when I belived NS to paly 15-17NT. This is precission and relay or only @D from N|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: N will bid and show the adwanced que in @S I hope|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: ohh|pg||
nt|rodal f: S can't pass since 2/1 is made|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Declarer might still come to 9 tricks if he plays a heart to the ten|pg||
nt|petergill: which is not impossible|pg||
nt|petergill: only "might" = more likely is -100 or -200|pg||
nt|tejjyid: excellent; East's subsequent 2@H bid will say 6 cards & too weak to open|pg||
nt|jcwla: Query whether N is really ever going to find out information to play somewhere other than 4@S opposite pd's vul 2-level overcall?|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, little gained by the convention here as NS easily bid their hands.  Would a 3@d opener have been more effective?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think all roads lead to Rome on this hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  but took a long time to build those roads|pg||
nt|henryb:  6 of either red suit is not the worst contract ever seen|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|offthebend: good stop - this should come to easy 8 tricks unless Heart suit is attacked |pg||
nt|tejjyid: whihc, these days, is pretty weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: E thinks that 4@D is strong, slam try. West just bid 4@D as not so strong|pg||
nt|petergill: If @d is trumps, before bidding 4NT, always check if 5@H response takes you past your last safe haven|pg||
nt|rodal f: UPS. THIS CAN COST|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S denies Hxx (H = A, K or Q) support, I think|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: 1@D can also be controls if they use it for 0-2|pg||
nt|petergill: West would have raised a 3@D opener to 5@D.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: U meam u have underbidded by ure 16HP? |pg||
nt|twcho: strange not to introduce his 2nd good suit  by south|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South sould have bid that @S suit at some stage though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, over the 1@H; later for the tightrope walkers|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D natural, 3@H = xxx support without top honour|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think E failed to do so - or perhaps 4NT does not mean what I think it means|pg||
nt|jjsb: with the @c situation this one seems to be an ok contract |pg||
nt|jcwla: On 8, where NS here played 2@D making 4, their NZ counterparts failed by 3 in 3NT, so 7 more to Indonesia, up 35 through half the comparisons.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  but won't make because of the bad @d break. and even 4@h needs careful play|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S cue as slam try, 4@H signoff|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: anyway, West worked out that this is not a slam auction - else East would bid 4NT earlier - and thus had the commonsense to signoff with her poor hand|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|offthebend: and paula better overtake the second spade in case west ducks twice :)|pg||
nt|jjsb: i am been told its a 0 to 7 |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jjsb: i think @d looks like the only possible considering the dummy ? |pg||
pc|cK|nt|offthebend: oops - why did she throw the S |pg||
nt|andyv:  3N was good contract except for lack of tricks|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|petergill: South has a difficult time getting off lead now|pg||
nt|offthebend: still OK |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|petergill: 600 to EW, after an exciting auction|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|petergill: Nice play - @CJ was best, only because all other options looked bad|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s7|nt|petergill: Good @H play - devastating defence |pg||
nt|petergill: You ruff the 2nd club, play 2 top hearts to find the bad break, stop trumps perforce, and play @d by|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jjsb: and that contract is all about @c so |pg||
nt|twcho: with such good hand and good suit quality|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|rodal f: With the 16HPs Y. Agree u|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|rodal f: So a presission where Weiwei should have had some lessons for some?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kerasidis: or by north even if its not stronh|pg||
nt|petergill: leading low to king then low through the person with long trumps so a top @d doesn't get ruffed.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  somehow something seems amiss in the play of that hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jjsb: and = it is |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: then concede a @D |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|henryb:  a good play by Wang to tell partner not to ruff declarer's losing @d|pg||
nt|petergill: then pitch a @d on the club, to retain control|pg||
nt|henryb:  or ruff and play @sK, @sA and ruff a @s|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, North is in danger of being squeeed - not good defence at all!|pg||
nt|kerasidis: u mean clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, a good alternative|pg||
nt|petergill: North has pitched clubs, so the contract is safe, no matter what happens now|pg||

nt|rodal f: B23 3NT at OR. Will cost as here I belive. Was -2 at vul|pg||

nt|rodal f: B8 OR at 5@S and here 5@H-1|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4S may have made on a non club lead though |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 10: West's duck of the @H at trick 2 was very good defence|pg||

nt|rodal f: But non vul so a 9IMPer for KIWI it seems.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Will W see the big value at @S8 or does it matter?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jjsb: North decided enough of discussion i want to play 4 @h and i guess this has no play |pg||

nt|petergill: 2@H 5+ @h, 8+ HCP, GF|pg||
pc|c7|nt|offthebend: they have to find a way to cash 4 club tricks after winning a D - to beat 3NT |pg||

nt|tejjyid: I think I'd try and keep the @H support a secret|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if I didn't pass 2NT, then I would bid 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now the defence has a blueprint of what to do|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not only did NZ not gain on 9, they lost 5, bidding 4@H but going down 1. So this one is all Indonesia.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
pc|d7|nt|twcho: so NE are screenmates|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Perhaps declarer should set up the side suit first, which is usually a good policy?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|twcho: just one down and an excellent result for EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: So well pressed by EW by a possible lost slam for China.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i dont know what would be the ended contract if Mak opened 1@d|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although, apparently the defence aren't architects|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|rodal f: B21 ended as here 3NT|pg||

pc|c6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't @CQ free there? Not the K|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had to dbl hook the @ds starting with the J from S hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  The interference made it hard for N-S to exchange enough information. I wonder whether S would have bid differently with @sK instead of Q, which would make slam excellent|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|jjsb: oh well i guess yes ... EW are not playing badly in minors thougth so .. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Me. Never. 3@H always |pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: she seems to have 7 tricks even if she loses trump control|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: the 590 will be just 5 imps to Fr Poly, with @DA the (unapproved, in my opinion) opening lead to 4@s undoubled at the other table|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes CQ is better card and get the encourgement by west|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: The 2@D I'm unshure at. 2/1 and foring with color or rev drurey?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The third choice of course is 1NT but hard to think that could be best.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|petergill: Chinese Taipei women's team includes two women who almost made their Open team, so they should do well too|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: B23 also at the table|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jjsb: i like to have some kind of shortness to play a 21-22 game contract even on 9 card fit ... |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Let them find it and take 1 IMP. 4 @H make risk as I feel it.|pg||
nt|jjsb: i would have double maybe showing some cards a good 3@h bid |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was the deal with ure mate. Cards or hart:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|twcho: as long as east dare to introduce his @s suit, it is very difficult for NS to buy the contract|pg||
nt|kerasidis: would any one open this 1@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  reverse the @ss and @hs, and 1NT is fine|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|twcho: i would open 1@h|pg||
nt|petergill: With spades 3-0, entries to the South hand are a bit limited in 6@S, and one might have to overtake @HJ (if @H ace is ducked), use @H as "replacement trumps" to make 6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: anyway, RKCB would keep one out of 6@S|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|jcwla: Of course.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|henryb:  A kibitzer points out that RKCB keeps modern players out of these 50% slams|pg||

nt|twcho: so the misplay has caused Indonesia the 1st double-digit loss|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|twcho: because if trumps break 33, it makes no difference|pg||
nt|twcho: and if trumps breaks 42, the premature ruff will let her trump out of control|pg||
nt|pelu: look at the bidding in CR - also 3@D but then 3NT by East??? - where did se exp to find 9 tricks?|pg||

pc|s4|nt|petergill: To save or not to save?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Max was 3@C|pg||
nt|offthebend: it was hard to get to 3NT by EW on this bidding |pg||
nt|kerasidis: could ...but N could not imagine it is 6 card|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: B24 also 3NT but S to lead a @S and 12 tricks for a push|pg||
nt|jjsb: and we will probably play 3nt no @h fit and around 25hp thougth here its not the best contract |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H transfer|pg||
nt|twcho: so I add a "may". :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N would not be among my choices with two small @d|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: 4@S makes as long as declarer does not lose trump control|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|rodal f: No relay so color. 2NT=relay|pg||
nt|jjsb: let see if they can find a better minors game |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|petergill: the undertricks are only 50's, so no big loss compared to 2@S making|pg||
nt|petergill: Good dbl by N, avoids the trap of bidding 5 over 5 with too few trumps (even though 5@S might make on perfect play)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 China made 1IMP|pg||
nt|jjsb: nice lead |pg||

pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: @C or @D to play?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3-3 in @C than that is correct. Drop the A@D than that is correct. We see it but declerer|pg||

nt|petergill: Hi Andy, Jordon|pg||
nt|henryb:  P, probably, because I have a lot of defense. But 4@d might be better to force the opponents to bid at the 4 level|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass 3@d as smoothly as possible, hoping South balances?|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: perhaps he felt the gods were watching him|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that was the first significant card play error by NZ in the whole match - 40 of Indonesia's 41 imps have come from basic bidding errors by NZ players, such as when to bid ...|pg||
nt|petergill: game, how to compete etc|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|offthebend: Pele may be getting excited and try the slam |pg||
nt|rodal f: B10 I didn't watch. OR 1@S NS and CR 1NT+1 EW. A doubble score to come.|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D means that if South bids, you can start doubling, with confidence|pg||
nt|henryb:  If E had bid 4@d she probably would have had a chance to double 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|tejjyid: Sorry, maybe I have my South's mixed up...|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: For a photo of Wang Hongli, she's wearing the red scarf at http://www.nwpu.edu.cn/english/NewsEvents/NPUNews/84817.htm|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12 was 300 to NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: That near slam for NS, where EW had there best at 5@C-2|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D still 0-6HP as u got from a spec Sylvian:)|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1@s is relay 2@c should shoulg a certain force ? 2@d is relay again |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12: 5@CX was a good save - 4@H would have made - declarer should play @HA then !J in 4@h, after West has shown 7-4 (and thus short @H) in the bidding|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|petergill: I think Wang Hong Li would have passed 4@D, as @d length is a danger signal over 4@D - if partner cannot act with short @d, partner is likely to be weak|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  not sure what 2@s was all about...maybe an invite (replacing 2N)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: What if N had 15HP with @Da and not J. Still 1@S and not 1@C=16+ I belive|pg||
nt|rodal f: Kiwi at the lead after B10|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jjsb: i dont know what will be bidding but pretty sure North will find ways to shows 6-4 and that kind of strength :) and pretty sure also this will ended up 4@h |pg||
nt|jjsb: ty operator :) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Have S forced for game now. Normaly Y, but....|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: That's a good auction|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: Seems very likely|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|offthebend: Lucky for North but Prime AK and Ace -- did not cooperate , very timid bidding |pg||
nt|jjsb: i cant see any clear way not to loose the 2@s 1@d and 1@c (at least) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u are|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tejjyid: time-saving lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: 4 rounds of clubs, ruffing with @HQ, would be great defence, but alas S was dealt an attractive @S lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jjsb: plus i have the impression the defense has a clear idea of North distribution |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tejjyid: Iexpoect Ace and anoterh @D soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: If a top sapde was led at Trick 1, then a club switch to lock declarer out of dummy would be great defence|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tejjyid: Well, of course he cant see the hand as we can|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: South can do little else but continue @h and hope declarer errs later|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps, but when you have 6@s partner might not have been able to act because of lack of spades|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tejjyid: he's worried by the Kxx of @D possibility; then he'd need some black suit magic to get home|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  on this hand it works well as W hand is too top heavy in @hs...but usually with 9 hcp and pd overcalling 1NT, 3N seems to be automatic (esp. when vul)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jjsb: i take back the 4 loosers i see 5 now |pg||
nt|rodal f: B23 ended = ups. And 6IMP for China|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: one way to find that defence would be that if declarer has a 2nd @H, the defence has little chance|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, I agree 100% with Andy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|twcho: good guess by north|pg||
nt|henryb:  perhaps a 3-4-1-5 ten count|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c8|nt|petergill: always push to a vul game opposite a 1NT overcall|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|twcho: there must be some reason for east not leading his partner's suit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d3|nt|jjsb: East insure the down 1 and i believe rigth he is |pg||
nt|rodal f: U as me would have done the same at team.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 2@S = 4 cards|pg||
nt|jjsb: well not to be said u have to be a little "carefull" if east from that point ...|pg||
nt|jjsb: but i dont see any reason to play that Q @d |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|offthebend: 1S down 5 -- doesn't look very appetising to team mates :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|tejjyid: perhaps this is the better line, in fact|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: but it requires a (quite possible, not double dummy at all) top spade at Trick 1 to have a look at dummy|pg||
nt|twcho: so 2@d+1|pg||
nt|twcho: only +1|pg||
nt|twcho: still a trump to lose|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s7|nt|petergill: but with 9 points for the 3 @H stoppers and only 6 points elsewhere in 3433 shape, West's hand is more like a 14 count than a 15 count|pg||

nt|twcho: well done by the reigning WC|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|twcho: strong @c does have edge here|pg||
nt|twcho: they can keep the bidding lower and have more space to explore for the best contract|pg||
nt|pelu: the start 1@C - 2@C mede life easyer for NS|pg||
nt|twcho: this is particularly true when one side holds a very strong balance hand|pg||
nt|twcho: the traditional 2N opener or 2c-2D-2N is nicknamed slam killer|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N|an|alert|mb|p|nt|twcho: 2H is probably Kokish|pg||
nt|twcho: forcing north to bid 2@s|pg||
nt|pelu: S prob sh 24-25 HCP - if 4@C natural then a good bid|pg||
nt|twcho: then 2N shows a higher range bal hand|pg||
nt|pelu: or 3@C followed with 4@C|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|twcho: how to show her @c suit now?|pg||
nt|twcho: since 4@d/@h is a transfer|pg||
nt|twcho: so 4@s must mean something else|pg||
nt|twcho: but they have no space left to check for keycards and trump solidity|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: back to 3@C - 3X - 4@C - some play a jum,p to 4@C = 5-5 in major|pg||

mb|3C|nt|petergill: with @SK onside, 6@s plays well, but I think 6@s is a touch less than 50% chance, thus should not be bid. But I'm not sure|pg||

nt|petergill: some (not me) say not to splinter with bare king|pg||

nt|petergill: 2@C artificial game try, playing Two Way Checkback|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: East, who did not open a 13-15 NT, decided he had a maximum, but 4@s should fail, with black kings offside and @DQ a useless asset|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@D was forced|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Still back to the splinter at NS contra minisplinter and splinter at team. Not match.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H response probably shows minimum, 3@C and 4@C natural, 3@C showing the 6th club |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D cue|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT 1430, 5@C one key card|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D asks, 5NT = @CQ, thus @CKQxxxx|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d asks trump Q, 5N = Q and no side K|pg||
nt|petergill: 5NT also denies side king, thus no @DK, so 4@d cue must be singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: Can they ask for queens below 6NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  so to get to 8 HCP must have major suit Q|pg||
mb|7N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  with A@c onside, this hand becomes even easier|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: For profile of China Women's team of 2009, with photo of N and S, scroll down at http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/equipechine09.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S is a fair contract, but will fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2NT natural, forcing, does not have to be balanced, asks partner to bid out her shape|pg||
nt|henryb:  7N at worst on @d finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Over 2NT, North would have bid a 4 card major, so South knows North is 3316 or 7+ clubs|pg||

nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|jjsb: moind u , Sout watched the vulnerability before doing that one :) |pg||
nt|petergill: Indonesia have reached 5@H on Bd 27, and look like losing trump control and going down|pg||
mb|1H|nt|offthebend: thx all |pg||
nt|rodal f: As the spec shall have the same by there comment putting us at the sharpness|pg||
nt|jjsb: but this can create a little problem actually ....|pg||
nt|petergill: which should make the score about 51-10 to Indo for Bds 1-9 and Bds 11-13, with 4 bds still to be scored |pg||
mb|2D|nt|petergill: Patrick Huang did well to find the heart ruff needed to beat 6@C at the other table|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ths for inviting me Chayes. Been nice together with u nice specs:)|pg||
nt|jjsb: to reach 3nt that is |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision, 11-15, could be short|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jjsb: can we considere that any of the EW player got a clear stopper? |pg||
nt|jjsb: not easy...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as @H8765 is good enough for 3NT |pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 4@s without interference from the opps|pg||
nt|petergill: 53-10 I think, Bds 1-9 being 41-1 to Indo|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: South might have bid 3@S (not 2@S) at fav vul versus ctrong club (perfect conditions for maximal preempting) as 6-4 (or 6-5) shape is as good as a 7 card suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr:(|pg||
nt|twcho: this bd is more challenging for declarer|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = interesting - I would bid 1NT, but as they dbl on light values, they presumably like 1NT to be a bit stronger|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: B25 gave 1IMP for Indonesia.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@D 5+ @D, 8+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: and in my opinion N should remove bidding space early by raising spades directly, but his silence might prove golden, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: and so it does!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit diferent style at OR and here. OR 2@S - 4@S. IMPs to Thailand|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 10 imp for Thailand :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S fast arrival, weak in GF auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Sucked them in. |pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: I think South can place North with @DQxx and might pass 3NT, even if she thinks there's a 4-4 @h fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  A less happy contract than 3N|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jjsb: sensible lead .. that give that contract |pg||
nt|jjsb: funny that both line reach a contract that both suppose to be down and that after all they ended up making it ! :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  N pretty limited by initial pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  so range was about 8-10 or maybe a bad 11 that didn't open|pg||
nt|petergill: NS will survive their bidding misadventure only if 3NT fails - how does 3NT go on a @d lead?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: An interesting point for a partnership to agree on (in advance) - does 3@s allow South to bid 4@s over 4@H, or is the responder to the 2@S preempt in complete charge, with the 2@S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: preempter being a disciplined person who must pass 4@H? China clearly thinks the latter. |pg||
nt|petergill: I think East has bid his hand with 3@S and should Pass 4@S, not double it. Then West will bid 5@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B13 ended 4@H at OR as here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|petergill: Win @DA, run @C9? |pg||
nt|henryb:  you own a lot of tricks: 3@c, 3@d, 2@s, 1@h for example|pg||
pc|h2|nt|twcho: so defense has gone wild|pg||
nt|twcho: if north goes up with the ace, south's @s will be established before west @c|pg||
nt|twcho: and there is no way for him to gather 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|h6|nt|petergill: A coup by North gains 9 imps for the underdogs|pg||
nt|petergill: Trick 2 happened to be: cash @HK or get squeezed in red suits for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S wanted cue bids, he could have bid 3@s over 2@d to force them|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|twcho: but declarer was also wrong in covering @cJ with @cK|pg||
nt|twcho: but if south refuse to go up with his @c honor and north win the 1st @c with ace, defense willl prevail|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to our excellent operator Chayes Luang-On for good work. |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzek: Thank You|pg||

nt|vugraphzek: see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|twcho: so all the errors add up to a tie bd|pg||
nt|twcho: tks all for watching|pg||
nt|twcho: actually declarer can win the battle by ducking the 1st @s|pg||
nt|twcho: then he will be able to establish his @c before defenders establishing the @s|pg||
nt|twcho: quite an intriguing hand|pg||
nt|twcho: bye now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: Good smooth duck of @S10|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: Any telltale hesitation on @S10 would have been fatal for the defence|pg||
nt|petergill: Although 6@H makes, there's no advantage, looking at NS's 26 cards, from being in 6@H rather than 6@S, so that was unlucky for NZ |pg||
nt|petergill: A great start for Malaysia to beat one of the stronger teams in the event|pg||
nt|petergill: APBF event's website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round Start in 3o min|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Japan - China (Lady)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the defending champions Chinese Taipei are probably marginal favourites in the Open field, with China not at full strength.|pg||
nt|petergill: in the Women's, China are of course the favourites, though their team roster has changed a bit since their World Championship win|pg||
nt|petergill: See you in about 30 minutes for the next match|pg||
nt|petergill: Website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: but the website does not have any results, so far|pg||
nt|petergill: You have to take into account that Malaysia has only about 100 bridge players, so results might take a little while to appear, with a small number of people doing a lot of work. |pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: B26 by same press as here, 4@H and N bidded 4@S as here.|pg||
nt|jjsb: ok see u all guys in 45 minutes !! thanks again ! |pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: and that's all today from Kuala Lumpur - there will be 3 more matches tomorrow |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT play = @D , @C9 to king, 2nd @D. Cannot play small club to ten in 3NT, as West can insert jack to block clubs. So @CQ, @CA, @C10, spade up. East has to give you a @H or @d ...|pg||
nt|petergill: trick = 9 tricks. So this is bad for China, perhaps|pg||
pc|c9|nt|petergill: 4@S is a good save, so perhaps the first approach is the better one? Or perhaps, South, with 6-4 shape being as good as a 7 card suit, should at fav vul overcall 3@S over 1@H, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: allowing North to take the 4@S save? |pg||
nt|henryb:  they made 3N in the other room|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: See u all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank You.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Director here|pg||
nt|jjsb: mmhhh |pg||
nt|jjsb: well 3 @h bid migth be the problem |pg||
nt|jjsb: i was about to point that aspect that normally if the defense bid a 2 suiters u cue the bid to say u cotnrol that suit |pg||
nt|jjsb: so im not sure if the explanation was same at both table |pg||
nt|jjsb: South migth point out if he know that there is no @h cotnrol he would have lead a @h ?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  if dummy every comes down with an AKQxx of side suit after opener has bid a strong @c, it's cash out time|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Spec told that 2@S is 6@S+ and a opening hand at OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: See u later a time. Non know when:)|pg||
nt|granguru: es la otra patty|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: 6-4 shape is as good as a 7 card suit, just as 7-4 shape is as good as an 8 card suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzek: French Polynesia - Chinese Taipei (Open)|pg||

pc|sA|nt|vugraphzek: Thank you All :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: See you tomorrow|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: a Minus 1100 result from a weak NT on Bd 13 has added more relief for French Polynesia|pg||
nt|petergill: so only 18 imps the margin|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye all|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|andyv:  save the brain work for the tougher hands|pg||
nt|petergill: West sensibly tried to beat 4@S (e.g. if partner has @SA instead of @CKQ), but might have cashed @HK first |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: The last board at OR ca be a push but belive a gain for the Kiwi|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass around|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next segment start in 40 min|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lots of mistakes (big) but a few less by NZ|pg||
nt|super nova: With the Grand slam in D hand it would have been possible to bid 5nt saying we have all the key cards and the Queen, what do you think of 7.|pg||
nt|super nova: With solid clubs would have been an easy decision.|pg||
mc|8|nt|petergill: with Lusje Bojoh, an excellent player from Sumatra, playing 3NT as recommended here|pg||
