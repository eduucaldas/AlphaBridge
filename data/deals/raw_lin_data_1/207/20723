nt|olegario: there is a chance of making it, though E_W  if the timing is lost|pg||
nt|grebrof: the swedes are playing a conventional system where they dont count the Js - not sure how the americans play, but I hope someone can enlighten me|pg||

nt|sheila a:  S doesn't realise how strong partner is|pg||
nt|sheila a:  not excited to hear of @h shortage|pg||

pc|hA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|grebrof: even if W had opened 1nt, theres no reason not showing a 2 suiter - obviously Berthaus doesnt want a @h or even a @c lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sunsamvar:  Needs both club and @H honours to be corectly placed|pg||
nt|hlortz: we can see south was hoping for a quick ruff but the wrongplayer was short in @C|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: in the running scores Sweden is leading by 333 imps to 0. So a lot of work to do by USA 2 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: clearly a mistake, as Sweden only had a carry-over of 3 imps|pg||
nt|hlortz: declarer exits @h k to make a trump shift harmless - no @H lead so he expects s to have the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: we are now playing the Quarter Finals. It's Knock-Out from now on|pg||
nt|hlortz: mine shows swe leading 4-0|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the carry-over is based on the result of their match in the round robin|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sweden won by 10 imps. Since USA 2 finished higher in the rankings 1/3 of the difference is the carry-over|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck:  he wants to minimise damages vul, but not much he can do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyway, this will drift two or three off |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jbgood: not unnatural to double, but takes a good defense to beat it I think|pg||
nt|jbgood: a good meaning perfect|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rv: declarer will struggle to make 5 tricks here|pg||
nt|sheila a:  needing trumps to come in, it seems best to play W for the Q as can pick up qxxx on that side|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|brolucius: If any Americans were disappointed initially that their megastar Meckstroth-Rodwell team had not qualified, they must be reassured by the easy passage of both the USA teams into ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|an|hearts|mb|p|mb|3N|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|brolucius: This (Very young) team, USA2, defeated the Nickell team (including M/R) and also the Diamond team on their way to the Bermuda Bowl. |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: any backgound info why the young bridge gods Llall-Grue are not lined up here??|pg||
nt|Vugraphznw: may be they are resting|pg||
nt|Vugraphznw: Fredin thinking|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D is a transfer showing hearts, just as it would be opposite a 2NT opening. Of course, you should use the same methods for the two sequences.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznw: Fredin stil in the tank|pg||
nt|Vugraphznw: Fredin alerted 3nt bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is very rare that you want to play in 3@H, so some pairs now rebid 3@H only when they have a heart fit. Here 3NT denied a fit.|pg||

nt|sunsamvar:  cashing the @CA early is the key.. do not give def to unblock with Hx|pg||
nt|ady: around 1NT e/w|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, a very long way to go|pg||
nt|grebrof: we all agree to that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: or 2@D|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 5 minor and not 3NT the spot and 5D down|pg||
nt|bt:  thanks for telling us |pg||
nt|grebrof: seeing all the hands make every world class player look like an idiot - well - they do make mistakes, but the difference between you and me, is  that they actually put their mind ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: into it|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p!|an|negative|nt|fluffy: pass of 2@s might have had some special meaning at the other table, and that encouraged west to bid his hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but they have to reach 5 clubs for big swing|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Pass from E was negative -- DBL would have been gameforcing|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rv: very rare to see natural 1@d on 1@c with 4M+4@D|pg||
mb|p!|nt|bt:  i think it was just braindead but there are many boards left|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  thing is everyone makes mistakes, its how you handle them that counts|pg||

nt|rv: Versace's double shows extras, Inv hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: some partscore competition, minors won over majors, wich is not usually the case|pg||

nt|mdgraham: probably wants to go back to 2@h |pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: no angry birds (doubles ) inn teams so |pg||

nt|fluffy: Grue showing both minors, anyone can be longer if any, an lall decided to pick clubs wich seems worse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: both pairs play slightly odd two bids; NS Multi 2@d, 2@H=both majors, 2@s=6-carder|pg||

pc|c3|nt|fluffy: however clubs break better than diamonds|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|hlortz: likely down 1 or 2 ... players compete for partscore more than they used to in IMPs imo|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|panosk: id very much like to see their bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it's odd how "standard" varies from country to country |pg||
nt|mdgraham: like a lot of other things I suppose|pg||
nt|bt:  chalk another 14 imp up to undisciplined bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: making 5 or 6 says Zagorin|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it looks from here that West should have passed 3D in open room|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: "Play it" says N|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|fluffy: 1 down wouldn't matter if 2@s was making, but here it looks like 2@s is doomed, 2@c 1@d 1@h 2@s on a club lead, but Lall had no other lead avaible I think|pg||

nt|Vugraphznw: Fredin will question , I think, the result before|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: depends on lead: @S can make dummy trump short|pg||
nt|brolucius: East to have differences of opinion on the 3@D bid, when the opener's 2@C includes a weak diamond option.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Easy to...|pg||

nt|brolucius: Not to the players, apparently. They gave differing explanations.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: he means that the 2@S bid very dangerous if N pretty unlimited|pg||
nt|meargent: not very dangerous at that vul|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: then mb we differ what is very dangerous:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: Making such bids is difficult for partner when he has to judge how high to raise.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Such decisions are often based on 'total trumps' and if partner may have four cards for a two-level overcall, it is awkward.|pg||

nt|psyck:  rite, once he found the 3@sx, they could not really go wrong|pg||

nt|bt:  they play their 2@C as weak in diamonds or strong, and maybe payed a huge price|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: "you passed in first hand" says Zagorin laughing to Nystrom|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: seems like they are all good friends|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: and know eachother very well|pg||
nt|bt:  they are team mates in the us|pg||
nt|bt:  or have bin idk|pg||
nt|grebrof: good lead|pg||
nt|bt:  anyway this hand is diffuclt, everything offside|pg||
nt|bt:  difficult|pg||
nt|bt:  mayde by N at the other table|pg||
nt|fluffy: the play is very straightforward, you have 8 top tricks and you have time for @s finese to the queen and also one more than can be @sJ or @hA|pg||
nt|bt:  made|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 8 tricks obvious but where is 9th? - |pg||
nt|bt:  all of which fails|pg||
pc|d6|nt|runnerup: Hurd very optimistic|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: If I heard well, W said 2@d showed extra's and East said @D+@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: limited by not opening 1@c, but it does seem a bit gung-ho |pg||

pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|ady: defense needs a forcing game |pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  maybe north cud have overcalled 2@C s on his his 2nd turn..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and already an endplay on S - if E can read the situation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3 rounds of @s and after that @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: when the @s doen´t break|pg||
nt|jbgood: only 1 undoubled in 4@s at the other table - contract on  23 right-handed even and played by N...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: doesn´t....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but isn´t that play rather obvious?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jaapfr vg: sure 1@C=16+ so 1@D max 15|pg||
nt|fluffy: diamonds blocked would let him make the contract even if west had @hAxxx, but @hAJxx is too much|pg||
nt|bt:  at the other table east lead a low heart to the 6, 7 and 9, after that declarer wasnt very unhappy|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|sunsamvar:  and pushed Lauria into 3@H|pg||
nt|rv: yes at some stage Mukherjee needs to shift to @CJ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 7 of diamonds for heart|pg||
nt|bt:  and if east has @H9 west would have been right|pg||
nt|fluffy: even if bathurst missed the switch he will have another time when in with @sJ|pg||
nt|bt:  so opening 1@C on 4135 and a 10 count, then declaring nt from that side was a winner|pg||
nt|fluffy: it seems a bit odd to lead hearts for fallenius, he opponets had bid hearts and not diamonds|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fluffy: @sQ doesn't mean spades are 4-2, @sQ is a must card to play from @sQxx since its teh card known to be hold|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: 5 obvious losers   but forcing game should beat this |pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has ducked the first diamond, but will get them later|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||

pc|c3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  with no quick entry to dummy declarer will struggle|pg||

pc|s8|nt|warrens:  4@H looks like fast arrival here=a minimum|pg||

nt|Vugraphznw: Hurd: sorry but i did not know what to do|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|c5|nt|brolucius: 3NT did go down on a diamond lead at the other table, so USA2 take the lead. This is very well deserved, of course, since they could be 26 IMPs better off if that good heart slam ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: had made.|pg||

pc|sK|pc|d2|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||

pc|d3|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||

nt|odysseus69: playing on clubs reasonable- just needs AK with East or d ace with West|pg||

nt|panosk: gd 2@S bid is 2@H?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

pc|hT|nt|fluffy: thx again Dennis|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphznx: presumably|pg||

nt|barbyh: I'd like to see that !|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: is 3@H not a bit modest?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: if N can pass it|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: after 1@D she has a very good hand imo|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South had to bid 2S rather than 2H and maybe once West showed clubs and east raised hearts he should have tried 3S rather than 3NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: and this one is 3 down most likelly|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, lets see what happens after the 6 @DS|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Fredin will be disappointed to lose points for 4H-2|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I dont think he will run @ds|pg||
nt|fluffy: the problem is, there won't be 6@d, there might be 3 if you don't wanna lsoe your obvious chance of @sK onside|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: how should he win after that|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no problem for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: @s finesse or sneak a @c // I guess @s|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok - IF the @s finesse is on - how many tricks in @s?|pg||
nt|bt:  i think mathematics are only relevant as for making game or not, they are not bidding 6@S at the other table|pg||
nt|grebrof: 10 "for sure" - sometimes we forget that teams are about making the contract|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sheila a:  not much can go wrong here for declarer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fluffy: the hands are fitting so well again, this time for NS, and nytrom will have no trobule making 4@h when trumps are 3-3|pg||

nt|warrens:  I'm told they're in 3NT at the other table, which is also down|pg||
nt|warrens:  N/S play 14-16 nt, so N is too strong for 1NT|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Michael Rosenberg likes to claim that he 'never' passes a one-bid. We will see if South does the same. Yes! |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jaapfr vg: better line for W was @HK and then x@C and not another @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: East expects his side to have a fit somewhere.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: West bids at the minimum level, of course, because his partner could not bid over 1@C.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: EW lost their momentum the last 8 boards imo|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: as in most sports see what happens when a catastrophe does hit (a) player(s) it gets its negative followup afterthat|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, on 12, Sweden reached the unlucky 3NT when 4@S would have made. So, Fredin's well-conceived 4@H opening at this table did not net the expected swing in his direction.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d4|nt|jaapfr vg: especially golf players have to fight like hell to overcome that mentally|pg||

nt|barbyh: anyone know what 2 sp is?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: who I must believe?|pg||

pc|c8|nt|fluffy: nystrom carefull won @hA to be able to return a low one had declarer got @hQ stiff|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: grue apologized when he saw the dummy, probably not happy with his own bidding|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: pls stop informing me kibs sorry|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fluffy: best defence I think was to win @cK and play another club, but that was double dummy|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphznx: on board 12 bathurst-zagorin missed the 4@h, so another 10 imps to sweden|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at least with 4@sx in the other room on the last board, Jaap doesn't need to go fetch the ketchup |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: why ketchup:)?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|fluffy: it will be a long trip to the semi finals|pg||

nt|fluffy: can't see what alternative is grue thinking about, if you don't ruff you get another heart for sure|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps thinking with @sQ to enter dummy?|pg||
nt|fluffy: in north is balanced as the bidding shows|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: indeed much more squeeze chance with early @H given away|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|jaapfr vg: W passes 2@D though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: S nothing to bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D is one minor weakish or strong two-suiter 5-5.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West can guess which it is, after South's pass.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznw: as predicted lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  a perfect auctin for e-w.  sometimes system is a lovely thing|pg||
nt|warrens:  auction|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaapfr vg: we had to wait 15 handds:)|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: give him a beer:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznw: ok np|pg||
nt|Vugraphznw: from you ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I believe the strong two-suiter has to include just one major, which would imply that East must hold clubs. In that case, the @CA lead was ill-advised.|pg||

nt|warrens:  declarer will get his long spade at the end,since the defense can't tap him out|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: interesting to see how CR deals with this board|pg||
nt|brolucius: This championship follows the very civilised session times favoured in much of Europe (but not England). They start early and finish early, allowing plenty of time for good dining ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: while they perform the postmortems. In England you are lucky if you finish before midnight. |pg||

nt|Vugraphznw: thx all for watching|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Not so bad to escape for -100 on that misfit. |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphznw: great match...and they have 3 more sets tomorrow|pg||
nt|warrens:  Thank youto BBO for providing this fantastic VuGraph on the Bermuda Bowl.  Thank you Traian for doing such a good job as operator-it's not easy.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jaapfr vg: is it not totally unfair to say that this session was lost by the Swedes (more fair than to say won by USA2) or is that impolite?|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D!|nt|warrens:  Thanks to my fellow commentators, David, Jaap and Joey.  And thanks to all our spectators, who definitely keep us on our toes.  See you all tomorrow for the second half of this excellent QF match.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think USA2 has played very well and deserve their big gain.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@D shows a sound spade raise. He may be willing to bid again.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Although he will recall that his partner did not open a weak 2@S.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphznw: wow|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: So, only 8 trumps are likely in the E/W direction. This is the normal guide to how high you should compete and indeed East has passed.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: oh sorry you do not know that I am a big usaa2 fan and saw the best bridge in RR and repeatedly are saying that they will rule the bridge world for the decades coming:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  very disciplined by East, knowing his partner is a passed hand |pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, he applied the LAW|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jaapfr vg: deadly serious|pg||
nt|jacksond: but does the law work?|pg||
nt|jbennet: the law is a unicorn. |pg||
nt|jacksond: looks like both can make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  the law says, as a general rule, you should bid the same level as the number of cards in your fit.  HOWEVER, you should bid one more with a double fit.|pg||
nt|warrens:  this turns out to be a double fit hand|pg||
nt|jbennet: someimes it works, some times not. |pg||
nt|jbennet: this it did work however. because 2 8 card fits = a 9 card fit.|pg||
nt|warrens:  both sides have TWO 8-card fits, which makes a difference|pg||
nt|Vugraphznw: we are in overtime now :)|pg||
nt|jacksond: its as useful as knowing that with 20 points and no fit you can usually make about 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphznw: Fallenius in the tank|pg||
nt|jbennet: but 3 d was probably beatable. |pg||

nt|sheila a:  Thank you Ruud |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|runnerup: so last board here -possible 4 @h |pg||
nt|psyck:  even playing in slow mothion will not produce any noticeable swing here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  tx all. has been entertaining|pg||
nt|rv:  if someone utlilizes that much time, he will straight get a spot in Roland's list of top 5 slow players|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|yuval10: can EW enter the bidding and find their @c fit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  6@C|pg||

nt|yuval10: guess not|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar:  tho a mite disappointing for Indian fans|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: the play in 5@c could've been interesting|pg||
nt|yuval10: Fredin can imagine his partner has @h's, but will he X with such a poor @s holding?|pg||
nt|hlortz: thx to our great operator and kibs who kew the ns system better than we did :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@c 2+cards|pg||
nt|fluffy: bertheau doesn't care much I think he will pass whatever|pg||
nt|bt:  i was hoping for a big interesting hand that would eventually give sweden 13 imps or so|pg||
nt|odysseus69: only 50s|pg||
nt|bt:  and i got this|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fluffy: bertheau has to pick between biddign 4@s or bidding hearts so that partner can make a good decision later|pg||
nt|fluffy: he picked the straightforward spades wich worked pretty well|pg||
nt|fluffy: defence might promote a trick in diamonds if declarer missguesses, but that's only the third trick for the defence|pg||
nt|fluffy: thx Henry|pg||
nt|hlortz: to gonzalo [fluffy[ for great analysis and to bbo for putting this on 5 sessions more to come - i am off to bed 330am here in seatttle|pg||
nt|fluffy: and thx trising for his help with NS convention card|pg||

pc|h3|nt|antoniz: 2pik 7-8PC na 5+pikach|pg||
nt|sheila a:  this is an interesting choice|pg||
nt|sheila a:  not much in the way of trump tricks but good on Aces and Kings|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|runnerup: yes east passed with 4 @s -his partners suit and south passed -both had surely other options too -so missed |pg||

nt|yuval10: if E plays another @h, it's likely that South will let his partner ruff to maintain control|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fluffy: thx Jan|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rv:  losing QFs in all events can join trans-nationals from 3rd round on Tue onwards|pg||
nt|yuval10: now if he plays @c .... it seem like 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fluffy: superb job all day|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West might have tried spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: and tomorrow will be a "long" day for us BBO operators|pg||
nt|bt:  west indicated spades with his hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: after the quarterfinals finish ---- then two rounds in the Transnational will be here on BBO|pg||
nt|bt:  anyway great thanks to the operators, without them nothing is possible|pg||
nt|odysseus69: key moment|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 2 rounds of 10 boards will be sent from Transnationals|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can he possibly find spade|pg||
nt|fluffy: will be hard to pick a table, there are 150 teams I've heard!|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: and we will finish the transmissions from Veldhoven at about 11.30pm tomorrow evening (or night)|pg||
nt|bt:  west did play @H6 then @H4 must have spade king|pg||
nt|bt:  why else play like that|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good point but I still feel that a spade was a better idea|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: all teams that might loose their quarterfinals have a chance to play in the Transnationals too|pg||
nt|bt:  its mistrust not to play him for spade king|pg||
nt|bt:  or just not concentrating after a gruelling 31 boards today|pg||
nt|bt:  lol|pg||
nt|fluffy: trusting or not declarer has shown 17-19, that's why he needs to think about it carefully|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: A of @ss is in the middel of the cards in the E hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: a @d in front|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psyck:  Results: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
