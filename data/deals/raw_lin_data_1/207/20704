nt|sunsamvar:  Needs both club and @H honours to be corectly placed|pg||
nt|hlortz: we can see south was hoping for a quick ruff but the wrongplayer was short in @C|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: in the running scores Sweden is leading by 333 imps to 0. So a lot of work to do by USA 2 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: clearly a mistake, as Sweden only had a carry-over of 3 imps|pg||
nt|hlortz: declarer exits @h k to make a trump shift harmless - no @H lead so he expects s to have the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: we are now playing the Quarter Finals. It's Knock-Out from now on|pg||
nt|hlortz: mine shows swe leading 4-0|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the carry-over is based on the result of their match in the round robin|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sweden won by 10 imps. Since USA 2 finished higher in the rankings 1/3 of the difference is the carry-over|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck:  he wants to minimise damages vul, but not much he can do|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: not unnatural to double, but takes a good defense to beat it I think|pg||
nt|jbgood: a good meaning perfect|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rv: declarer will struggle to make 5 tricks here|pg||
nt|sheila a:  needing trumps to come in, it seems best to play W for the Q as can pick up qxxx on that side|pg||

nt|fluffy: how many diamonds does 1@d opening promise?|pg||

nt|bt: thats an oldie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump length irrelevant, was the fact that NS have no singletons that makes for big set|pg||

nt|fabsayc: bathurst wondering what declarer is doing|pg||

nt|andyv:  his is not to wonder why|pg||
nt|bt: better grab that trick while u caqn|pg||
nt|bt: can|pg||
nt|andyv:  it was also a book by Mike Lawrence|pg||
