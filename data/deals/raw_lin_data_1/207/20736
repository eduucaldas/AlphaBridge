mb|2D|an| |nt|rv: here from South hand, some play both 2@c/2@s asmajors with better @h/@S resp|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d probably for the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: a few others play 2m as natural and 2Om showing majors|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  the 4-3 fit may play about the same as the 5-3 here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: I like to play 2@c as both majors with equal or better @hs and 2@d as better @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c by this pair is probably a xfer to @d and can be major/minor or just a diamond suit|pg||
nt|rv: a few others even play 2@c as both majors 54 either way and 2@d as Michaels 55|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi Jill and hi Venky:)|pg||
nt|jillan:  An interesting first hand to start with, I have been checjing around and the English ladies picked up 8 imps by bidding 3NT (down 3) in one room and getting doubled in 2@S making in the other|pg||
nt|jillan:  not ebery day you pick up that much by going 3 down in 3NT|pg||
nt|rv: Hurd will do well to score 8 tricks and restrict damage|pg||
nt|jillan:  Hi ANdy nice to "see" you here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  with stiff @s, doubling with W hand pretty dangerous as N should be expected to have 3-4 spades and might leave dbl in, as was the case in the CR|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Bocchi's 1@C is natural. All 3 Italian pairs play 2-over 1, which means that a two-level response to one of a suit is game-forcing.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lechcold: witam na meczu Polska-Bu³garia|pg||
nt|brolucius: Wooldridge bid 1NT (transfer to 2@C) intending to support spades on the next round. That is why transfers are so effective in many situations. They give you two bites at the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: cherry.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wooldridge explaining he is not 100% sure if 1nt shows clubs or could be a raise in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sometimes they differ , depends on 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but hurd explained as @C ,  madala just wants to know the insides|pg||
nt|ady: would double of 3@S be penalty from North  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ins & outs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: madala asking for the director|pg||
nt|brolucius: When 1@C is basically natural but maybe two or three cards, it is usually best for the defenders to treat it as natural in their subsequent bidding.|pg||
nt|barnets: it seems norths double relates to wests 1n bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  1N=transfer to @C's, but since N opened 1@C, this showed a strong 3-card raise.  Hurd's immediate 2@S over the X showed a minimum|pg||
nt|ady: not sure  what south is meant to do?|pg||
nt|barnets: if wests bid showed clubs perhaps norths x also showed clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: That agreement prevents any misunderstandings, such as may have arisen here.|pg||
nt|barnets: hence x of 3@S would also be penalty|pg||
nt|barnets: by north|pg||
nt|ady: that would seem to be a reasonable choice|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's not immediately obvious why N/S should call the director. They are probably happy to be defending 3@S.|pg||
nt|barnets: 3 rounds of spades would seem to defeat 3@SX even with 3 club tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: hoi Gerbrand :)|pg||
nt|ady: lost of wast paper in  south hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: Gerbrand will enter the names asap|pg||

nt|roswolf: 2@D showed a bal 18-19|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry that we missed this board, it was due to technical problems|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm almost certain no other table will be as shy as this one|pg||
nt|fluffy: pass is more flexible than other partnerships, upmark has too many extras to just bid 3@c so he douebles|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: the important factor here for south, is that perhaps on some meanings of 1NT he is on forcing now, and on others he isnt|pg||
nt|ady: with spades breaking well there will be no problem|pg||
nt|kit: Bocchi will have to cover, giving declarer the heart discard.|pg||
nt|ady: east shows 6 diamonds and 5 hearts|pg||

nt|ady: west preferemce to 3@D game forcing|pg||
nt|ady: with a weak preference  might bid 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2NT is artificial as always, not sure if showing a weak hand or both minors, 3NT to play|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gracelin: the later round of bidding is not explained in their CC so we will have to take some guess.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6S is more comfortable a contract than 6D.|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: they didnt|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since N didnt confirm a fit yet, South redoubled just in case EW were in trouble|pg||

pc|s5|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|brolucius: East tries to slip through a 9th trick in diamonds. |pg||

nt|desinka: hello all|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps NS weren't prepared to defend against this 1NT convention|pg||
nt|fluffy: looks like Bocchi though that double of 1NT asked partner not to make any forward moves, but south didn't understand it that way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to understand that 5@D. His partner did not have enough to bid 2@D on the first round.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Sweden/fredin-fallenius.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS included 18 pages of supplementary notes !!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphznt: and now focus is on Einarsson|pg||
nt|ady: life made very difficult for n/s|pg||
pc|s9|nt|brolucius: Our valiant operator is trying to recover from the crash (which of course was not his fault at all).|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Jorgensen played with Baldursson in 1991|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and Jonsson was the third in this team playing in 1991|pg||
nt|jfeld:  So, Declarer will most likely make after the heart lead|pg||
nt|xenya: no 8th trick in sight|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 2 ways to cause problem for opps to prepare: either no notes or very long one|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mathat: Q @c lead 3 r  @h|pg||
nt|ady: I feel this should have been 300 the other way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry the cc for stansby-martel does not cover this sequence, i believe 3@C shows a minimum, after that i would be guessing|pg||
nt|pelu: we have the vuegraf-match here, so OR will start in 5 min|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may have a guess at the end whether West has 3 or 4 cards heart.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Einarsson is now shaking his head -- he now knows he did the wrong thing|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but a @h now -|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not necissarily|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gulyas: S knew his @SKQ was worthless, and he had no ace, so maybe his hand is not worth much|pg||
nt|ady: I am told 6@H in OR   A@S lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: heart ruffed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: after 21 rounds the first 8 teams (of 22) qualify for the quarter finals|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: australia currently 8th, china 11th|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: the difference only 10 VP|pg||
nt|ady: cant see the logic of going to 6@D     can be best on a finesse if west has Ace and jack of spades  and asit is here no play at all|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gracelin: I presume he will discard the losing club on 3-round of H.  But he smply takes the trump finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: Martel has to block the diamonds so he can take another spade finesse, so he will make only 11 tricks.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: we dont understand the bidding, but the finalk contract is perect |pg||
nt|pelu: perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 4d i think it was club control|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: xx first round control|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry the hard @D-sits = down 1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: except diamonds are 5-2 so not cold if he draws trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: I will go for my morning-coffee :(:(|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphznt: Versace called for director, because Li had be thinking before he played @HA|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|ady: 11 tricks on top|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hlortz: nice contract! needs a bit of care to make cant draw trump need to ruff 4 clubs in hand i think|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   and that gives access to BBO Voice for both tables of our match|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: precarious line for overtrick|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lechcold: i potem jeszcze trafiæ gdy S wyjdzie w ma³e trefl...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|jfeld:  meant control problems (not entry problems)|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|gracelin: don't think he can make now.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eggy:  I know that we hate it when dummy hits with Jxx(x) but a club still looks lower risk and a higher potential plus than Qt9 to me, don't you think, especially when partner can't have much|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: li had to give up the spade before playing hearts|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  keeping @D for last but no problem there now|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: didn't realise Nystrom still had 2 more trumps when he played @DK|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  always a two way effect when first board is a partial doubled into game....Sweden will be feeling very good about this and USA 2 must be careful not to overreact and simply forget the board.|pg||
nt|andyv:  a good 4@d bid hand here|pg||
nt|rv: some might bid 4@d with West to show good 6+@ds+4@s|pg||
nt|jillan:  The Swedes got off to a very good start yesterday to,but today they will keep on going :)|pg||
mb|4C|an| |mb|p|nt|andyv:  W choses the splinter...perhaps they don't have 4@d in their arsenal|pg||
mb|4H|an| |mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: incidentally only @h lead beats 6@s though no one is likely to bid slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  those who think the splinter is based on good @ds should consider AQxx, KQJx, Axxx, x|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|rv: so far young US-2 team have played this event with hardly any nerves from all the players, I suspect today will be bigger test of their mental strength further|pg||
nt|jillan:  Although young they are very seasoned players|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think the team will have any problem in that area....they have been remarkably resiliant in all their matches|pg||
nt|andyv:  and they have been underdogs for a lot of them.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||

nt|nickf: to start the match - you need to click on REDEAL down the bottom|pg||
nt|ady: may have endplayed north for the 12th|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yeah went to fast for me to follow all cards probably was an endplay|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  note that Einarsson went up from Qx|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Director gave warning, nothing happened|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hurd and Wooldridge dicussed how many boards they had to play before the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: would have "overhault" them|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: its Grue - Lall in the other room|pg||
nt|fluffy: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and with speedy play like the first board then maybe never :)|pg||

nt|psyck:  Running Scores: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|ady: south a bit stuck   1NT    or pass|pg||
nt|szalay: routine 4@S is coming|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS play strong club, UDCA|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: up to speed again|pg||
nt|ady: USA playing 3NT with n/s cards  OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: A pretty awful board for Italy, whatever was the cause of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: had to relog because open room was down|pg||
nt|pelu: I am back, and I see that Marrtel won 7@H on dummy reversal - the X of 3@D by W force him to that winning plan|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
mb|1C!|an|16+|nt|brolucius: No percentage in North entering the bidding.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ... and North has then protected with a take-out double.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: bocchi looking sy west cards on board 1|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 4@h = @ss|pg||
nt|ady: 1@S?|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Vincent|pg||
nt|lechcold: Multi mocno wykrzywione...no ale podobno pasuj¹c nic siê nie wygra:)|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a pass out|pg||
nt|xenya: in a sense, both pairs should be satisfied with that result |pg||
nt|ady: north may transfer into clubs|pg||
nt|jfeld:  either can cost, but my style is to lead a club there.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: frequent upgrades for good playing strength|pg||
mb|d|an|clubs|nt|brolucius: 1@S denies spades. With 4 or 5 spades he would double.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H and 5@C here equally most likely down|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c probably both majors, and north bids 2@d as pick yourself|pg||
nt|hlortz: declarer will be content with 8 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=@C|pg||
mb|r|an|gf, 3+!c|nt|gracelin: trying to see how he could make the slam :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = contructiv 10-13|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C is surprising, most partnerships use lebensohl 2nt response to double with a hand of less than 8 points|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C? by N I would expect 2UT (lebensohl)|pg||
nt|hedyg:  running scores and results: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2NT for minors.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so this big 4441 can be handled in many ways|pg||
nt|jfeld:  without the 10 of clubs, a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: for the results|pg||
nt|tax456: brutta cosa..simoncelli in fin di vita in malesia|pg||
nt|fluffy: Hurd won't let him pick it seems :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: we had a similar hand in first set with minors vs majors, the good thing to do then was to pass 3m and put it down|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: EW play standard short club, 5-card majors, strong notrump|pg||
nt|gracelin: West will bud to 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many use a cue-bid to show a sound 3-card raise, 2NT shows a 4-card raise.|pg||
nt|barnets: NS in danger now|pg||
nt|ady: no   west there with his 9 count|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg:  for results and running scores: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: agressive auction|pg||

nt|juror1: witam z Veldhoven, nastroje s¹ raczej minorowe, ale duch walki nie zamiera, natomiast seniorzy a zw³aszcza kobiety bardzo bojowo i optymistycznie nastawione do walki|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie graj¹ negatem|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H some weak raise in spades I suspect|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes thats what i think they wrote down here to|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
nt|ady: wonder if west will dbl 3@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: south thought 2NT was natural|pg||
nt|ady: seems does not have the chance|pg||
nt|fluffy: here double dummy at least it seems 3@c is a make, with the double @d finese and a guillemard coup you score 5@c and 4@ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: East has bid 2@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5H will be very expensive at this Vul.|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@HX was 1100|pg||
nt|barnets: for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: Madala very agressive   is pass stronger in that position given the quality of the overcall?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Must be|pg||
nt|psyck:  Results: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||

nt|jcwla:  Poland (EW) CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Poland/Gawrys-Kalita.pdf |pg||
nt|roswolf: looks ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Barel had choices here   DBL 2@H  1N would all probably get some votes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but fewest going to 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most play 2@S promises a rebid|pg||
mb|1S|an|4+!s|nt|fabsayc: 1nt was 13+ to 16|pg||
nt|ady: yes   fallen on their feet|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Bought the auction really cheap |pg||
nt|jfeld:  Note that North chose a Diamond not a club opening, there is a debate among experts which is better|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I like the 1@D opening bid it is much more flexible than 2@C or 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it will be Joe Grue - Justin Lall for USA 2 in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and Jon Baldursson - T. Jonsson for Iceland|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  As most of you will have noticed these names do not match the countries playing - I'm sure operator will get to that in a second|pg||
nt|rensph:  seems we're back and good to go. :) Hello everyone.|pg||
nt|mathat: 3 down|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby could have bid 2@C stayman -- probably didn't want that doubled.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or big hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but as passed hand ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL probably denied 5+ suit, so 1@S=4|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|gracelin: but often the opponents will not believe they are given a gift|pg||
nt|psyck:  Live video stream: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|psyck:  (you can mute the audio to hear voice commentary here)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few would bid 1@H, vul against not, on those South cards. |pg||
nt|ady: will try club switch|pg||
nt|ady: 9 or queen?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ta¿ S nie ma negatu...raczej nie graj¹ transferem|pg||
nt|lechcold: wiêc Brenner nie móg³ od razu skakaæ na koñcówkê|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N looks reasonable enough|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: ga all|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C    very close to making|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|eggy:  current running scores on:http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|ahollan1: splinter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double just makes it easier in my opinion for opponents since they have two more bids available|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Welcome all - BBO has decided that specs getting it too easy with just voice commentary, so you have to suffer written commentary too :)|pg||
nt|ady: lose control here|pg||
nt|hedyg:  for the livestream from the site: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|jaapfr: down 2 i suppose|pg||
nt|ady: only 7 obvious tricks|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobra czêciówka|pg||
nt|tax456: ha fatto scopa con 2 moto|pg||
nt|fluffy: passing 2NT was not a success and obviously NS have 8 top tricks to cash|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|kit: I'm surprised Stansby selling out to 3@C with a void.  Seems right to compete with 3@D.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true a natural bid.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  you have to think what is passed out more often - I guess 1@D|pg||
nt|jfeld:  here, it works out as he gets to find out about the diamond fit immediately.|pg||
nt|jfeld:  If they get aggressive and bid a slam, it should make if declarer takes the percentage line in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: When the opponents find a fit and then stop at the two level, the other side know that the points are divided and that they will likely have a fit somewhere.|pg||
nt|ady: and then again at 3 level|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi Ian :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: if 3@c constructive stansby must wonder why he's doubled with his 19 hcp|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think it's for minors -- just a reasonably strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H bound to fail as the cards lie, but what else could NS do?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Barel forgot Zack had passed in 1st seat|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: dubion cannot know east hand   of 7-4  or would surely correct|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West said 6-5 probably|pg||
nt|juror1: mo¿na obejrzeæ naszych w otwartym http://wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm surprised he didn't bid Stayman with that hand|pg||
nt|hlortz: guess they dont play lebensohl :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: their file is big, no doubt somewhere this auction covered, but i dont have time to search|pg||
nt|pelu: cc: 2M -D - P: lebensohl - against weak 2M - but what if 2@H is constructiv?|pg||
nt|ady: J@S best |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  yes you cannot pickup Q9xx in E|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: declarer needs to guess trump to make this, but I am afraid he will not.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably down one but can in fact pick up the spades|pg||
nt|hlortz: @h shift ought to get south off ay type of endplay|pg||
nt|hlortz: /any|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Right. This exact holding is why playing to the K and finessing is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or he's incredibly pessimistic|pg||
nt|szalay: its a reason to play Mathe-convention|pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: @c is 2-2|pg||
nt|barnets: So South survived a potential second disaster as a diamond lead would have produced 1100 should west have chanced a x of 3@H|pg||
nt|szalay: X:majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 4@H   last train|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last train =  still some interest, can't bid beyond game, says nothing about this suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: kibs tell me 5@C can be made but I believe it can not be made (always also @S loser)|pg||
nt|ady: think it might be right for Sementa to run when doubled|pg||
nt|lechcold: król pik móg³by daæ niez³y efekt:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: this morning 1st session was China-Netherlands Shi and Li now Shi and Lian? (if I remember correctly)|pg||
nt|athene: surprising to see this misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|ady: may have been better to cash other club winner first|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: hoi william|pg||
nt|ady: hi William|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gracelin: from the 5H bid and the double, it's likely that north has a singleton trump|pg||
nt|kit: It took a different lead to defeat this -- but E-W should be in 3@H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gracelin: how can he believe north bids 5H at unfav Vul. with this 5422 hand.|pg||
nt|jfeld:  interesting. I would have thought Hurd would have done more with his 22 count after the inverted raise|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer finesses in spades, seeking a discard for one of his diamond losers.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: most partnerships, you would think, at this level, would have discussed if system is on after a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i think this is an important match for both teams - fighting for the last qualifying spot|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jaapfr: yes DD 5@C can be made|pg||
nt|hedyg:  the OR is starting play now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pull 1@C and ruff 4th @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 10 min later than we do, we have theathre here :)|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H best|pg||
nt|hlortz: or perhaps a @D ruff for north?|pg||
nt|ady: likely 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H and back would further damage N's plan to ruff @S.|pg||
nt|xenya: a kibitzer points out that 4@S might make -- possible in some variations, but certainly not on a heart lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  they play inverted by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: s passed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: The location of the king of spades means that South does well in 3@C, but the same location means that E-W won't make 3@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after all, north only bid 2H in first round.  So maybe declarer will figure it out.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will have to finish this and re start to link with other table so after this hand ill close this|pg||
nt|gracelin: got it|pg||
nt|ady: not best  as J@D will set up the 9    and low diamond will in affent mean north ruffing a loser  and then trumps 2-2|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hlortz: nah thats setting up a @D i told him wrong lol|pg||
nt|hlortz: whatever, it looks like they were not on same page 3@c prob not dbled & -1  this is going for 500 i think|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: 2Nt here ask for better minor, so N is forced to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|hlortz: i see. thx|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS signals  are  standard|pg||

pc|d6|nt|idc: We have Martel-Stansby playing 12-14 NT & 5-card majors, Camps/Villas-Boas 15-17 & 5-card majors|pg||
nt|ady: now 9@D 8th trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  or was a max. simple raise with 4333?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rhelle:  hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This room will be shut down shortly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator needs to reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|gracelin: moment of truth. he would love to finesse the SJ but entry is not cnvenient|pg||
nt|gracelin: This is the first time Lian plays for China.  His partner Shi is a veteran and reach semi-final in the 2009 BB|pg||
nt|jfeld:  I'm not sure. |pg||
pc|d3|pg||

nt|andyv:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cards are not favourably placed for the contract.|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 2 off now, declarer losing 2 spades, 2 clubs and the @HA|pg||
nt|ady: now west in the club   better to have cashed earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: example   Zack could have bid 3@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jaapfr vg: ty I was informed that there are 2 players named Shi in the Chinese team|pg||
nt|athene: most pairs simply agree system is indeed "on"; i.e. you respond to a 1nt overcall just as though partner had opened 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: that might not be optimal, since it's unlikely you will want to transfer to opener's suit, for example|pg||
nt|athene: but it is definitely simplest|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and this morning was Shi and Hou playing (ty Dennis)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: another Shi I suppose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 17  Hurd 2@H North|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: well he could have floated spade 9|pg||

nt|jaapfr: EW will have more problems to digest this board than the Dutch lunch they just got Gerbrand:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I Don't know what they had for lunch..|pg||
nt|hedyg:  he can make  3 more tricks only|pg||
nt|ady: this looks a bright start for Netherlands   as far as this table is concerned  they would think they did well to stop out of a slam hand 1|pg||
nt|hedyg:  @c ruffed high and claim -3|pg||
nt|famus: Hello everyone, David Henry|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs: why nor take the chance and bid 2Nt - hope for 3@C and if 3@D from S then normal 4 card suit (even 5)|pg||
nt|xenya: just continue diamonds, E pitching spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: confirmed|pg||
nt|ady: 12 to China  1stt hand  where 6@D down 1 in this room|pg||
nt|warrens:  best now is for S to play the Q of @H's, which will help him endplay one of thedefenders|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: or maybe i was wrong and a club was needed|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: You can see what a good idea it was for North to keep the bidding alive over 2@H (which would have made). You should always be reluctant to let the opponents play at the two-level ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in a fit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he's on the wrong track|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mathat: think bocchi in vuln bid 5 with sngl @s|pg||
nt|gracelin: south cannot hace a singleton club, or he would lead one for the ruff, so the finesse is to play south for 3-5-3-2 very unlikely since north is raising 2H with 6|pg||

nt|eggy:  I agree, but he knew that S must have a very robust heart holding after the 3NT bid|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 3NT instead of 3@h indicates that south had already shown rength|pg||
nt|jfeld:  sorry, probably not givent that they open so aggressively|pg||
nt|jfeld:  good point Henry.|pg||
nt|eggy:  He had also denied a four card Major, so a spade loser was almost certain|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@D - 2@D wasn't inverted by an unpassed hand |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S passed in first seet -- so 2@d was "just normal" - not inverted minor|pg||
nt|ritong: not that 3@h shows anything else than a half stopper, although 3Nt sounds definitely discouraging|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Barel could have bid 4@H over 2@S|pg||
nt|szalay: very well played|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: it's funny, the Dutch have orange system cards...|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Thanks|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: still i'm sure they would have got there had without the 1@S opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will fleisher try 2@D [weak 2M opener]|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  East will be tempted to pass this|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S a save|pg||
nt|barnets: a low diamond lead V 6@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: both sides play fairly natural systems 5 card majors 15-17nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D is american multi, i am not allowed to say the real name|pg||
nt|hlortz: if this keeps up many IMPs will be scored since -500 figures to be a big swing also  not 17 tho|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: here better not to try slam which fails|pg||
nt|ady: n;s may possibly get overboard here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D    ok, i did NOT see that coming|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they use 2@D to show the weak hands with (5)6-card Major|pg||
mb|2N|nt|brolucius: North may respond 4@S  to his partner's one-bid. No, he has preferred 1@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we are up to speed now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: had to claim the first 2 |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S is two down, assuming the defence attack clubs early enough|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  Joel wasnt excited that although max he has 6 HCP in partners shortness|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2NT is natural in passout - important to discuss with a partner but should be standard|pg||
nt|eggy:  really - it looked like the strength of an inverted minor!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  And now West has a problem. 2@s is non forcing, but he has a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: but nanev, with singleton spade facing a takeout double, might bid on|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@SX in other room|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Oh, the pressure...|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry, hard to see the claims|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect 3@D is some kind of forcing spade raise|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play 3NT e/w|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1 Levin in 3@D East|pg||
mb|3C!|an|stayman|nt|idc: The Brazilian Federation has player profiles on-line, look at: http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/joaopaulocampos.php|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting hand and would require caution to stay at reasonable level.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this Chinese pair not playing Precision, but a natural system|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  He doesn't know about the wasted @h values in his partner's hand, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this sort of auction some play 2NT by the opener as weak-strong. That allows them to show a strong 3@C rebid (by bidding 3@C) or a shapely weaker one (via 2NT).|pg||
nt|ady: can the get a penalty in 1 heart|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|athene: fearing his opponents have a huge fit and more shape than they do have|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this will limp home|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do anyone here have the link for running scores|pg||
nt|ady: yes   6@H can be beaten  |pg||

nt|psyck:  who bid 3@c operator?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: only one makeable|pg||
nt|xenya: normal contract|pg||
nt|ady: without a club lead 6@D a decent contract   as club may go on long heart|pg||
nt|eggy:  cultured lead that was close to making the bulletin|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: puppet stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This is interesting.  East will lead a high heart and shift to a minor.  But does he shift to the suit where he has the king, or where he doesn't?  That is what declarer will have ...|pg||
nt|kit: to judge.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: although with @H 3-3 and IF @H lead ........ 6@D could be made|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D has many interesting chances|pg||
nt|athene: if the trumps come in|pg||
nt|athene: for example, on a club lead, you could win the ace, draw trumps, cash three rounds of spades discarding a club, and exit a club|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: IF:)|pg||
nt|ady: 3Nt might have gone down on a club lead if south reads the hand wrong|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: ok, this is interesting|pg||
nt|antoniz: witaj Grzegorz:)|pg||
nt|kit: Likely headed for 3NT -- the fate of that is not clear.|pg||
nt|athene: forcing the defenders to open up the hearts|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Leading the K also let's partner know to unblock with the Q.|pg||
nt|tax456: quando non c erano i bidding box succedeva anche questo...|pg||
nt|fluffy: he trusts his mind, not his fingers and sets the bidding to the game level|pg||
nt|fluffy: this has 4 obvious losers, however an endplay is makeable against east|pg||
nt|fluffy: forcing him to lead a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when he bids 4nt you might think it is offering two places to play, in which case he should pass 5@C|pg||
nt|hlortz: could be 6 imps if both 2@h and 2s make|pg||
nt|roswolf: settles for the minor game - understandable enough|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This doesnt look like it can make|pg||
nt|ady: I think would need to drop bare A@D to have a chance in 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  no chance|pg||
nt|roswolf: no very much uphill|pg||
nt|fluffy: assuming he doesn't give the contract away with the lead wich was certainly reasonable given that his only safe lead was a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and he does that at trick 1 instead :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW carding  odd/even|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue was only interested in 54 @H|pg||
nt|szalay: I confess don't see why stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with so many points, i thought he might just bid 3N immediately|pg||
nt|szalay: I thought so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gyorgy got there first :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might have been a slam|pg||
nt|szalay: and Jxx opposite a stopper|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: N/S are not playing a strong 1@C system. That is probably why North did not want to make a pre-emptive 4@S response - in case his partner was strong and they could make a slam.|pg||
nt|santyclz: W has no quick entry to allow a @s thru.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@S makes easily for me|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and how get @DQT3 out?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes it is a common treatment that you lead your honor above the gap with 4 out of 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads 3rd/5th against suit AND nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rhelle:  the problem for East is communication. He can throw @cs on @h KQ, but how to get there?|pg||
nt|brolucius: When dummy has only one card in the suit led, the partner of the opening leader can give a suit preference card to suggest a switch.|pg||
nt|ady: spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be another swing to USA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@C-1 looks too many tricks made to me|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes this is a team of [relatively] young stars|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @C2 shows preference for @H     i think|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gracelin: Lian was in a tough situation to guess the trump layout under the bidding.  Italy really earned this swing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2s was 5+ spades veery weak|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sementa led a trump in the other room against 4S, which is tougher for declarer.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thought max 10 tricks in @C b1|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead best|pg||
nt|famus: @ds wud b the best lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: trump leads are best and so it was|pg||
nt|ady: good lead|pg||
nt|famus: gr8--Grue heard us--prblm for declarer |pg||
nt|ady: bad club split will beat this|pg||
nt|ady: I think down 2|pg||
nt|hlortz: thats my guess -2|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: not possible to see what they write down|pg||
nt|fluffy: who says the strong hand must play the board now? :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2 clubs 15+ any reverse without 3spades or nat|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  8 easy tricks - 2 0 4 2 and a likely @h.|pg||
nt|idc: Since the defensive entries (@dT & @hA) are split N-S, defence won't be able to get at club winners|pg||
nt|ady: semi psyche by north    no action from south   believed vulnerable opps|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Polska-Izrael jutro ponownie z przekazem wideo|pg||
nt|pawel90: czemu po treflu nie jest bez trzech?|pg||
nt|kit: It looks like the defense should be able to establish enough black-suit winners before declarer can set up the diamonds, but they will have to be careful.|pg||
nt|ady: needs to keep to 2 trump losers  so a reasonable game   but not making|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
nt|roswolf: the play is likely to take some time|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately  evening knowing of diamond position still cannot make|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks are available here -- but that's neither here nor there|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  also Q from KQ109x for example|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think ACBL allows odd/even except 1st discard|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3n is  hand to go for coffee|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: sometimes when you have a scrambling bid like this you can use it to show a weak bid in the highest-ranking suit|pg||
nt|idc: Of course, declarer doesn't know heart layout, so this could still be tricky|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can"t be bid though makes.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: Now club ruff, heart ruff, and eventual diamond finesse will make|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rhelle:  North needs to take and shift to a @c - but not sure even that is enough|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a high spade, if 10 or J drops, he may ruff to hand to ruff the 3rd H.  If nothing drops, just pull the other trump|pg||
nt|kit: Nice choice to get to 5@D -- that will probably come home, although not clear.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree.  5 H's, 1@S, 1@C and 4 @D's (ruff one club in dummy, draw trump)|pg||
nt|kit: In principle declarer would have 3 diamond winneers in North, 1 ruff in South, 5 hearts, and two black aces, but club leads by defense could cause problems.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: in other words 5@H over 4@S would be "good" and 4nt - whatever - 5@H is "bad"|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  allows p to contribute the missing honor|pg||
nt|jfeld:  To read about the players you can check out the team profiles here. USA 2: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/usa2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: I wonder what declarer would have done on a diamond shift|pg||
nt|xenya: club now planning to ruff a club and discard a @D on the @H K|pg||
nt|athene: well, obviously, your first job in 6@D is to persuade west not to hold @DQ10x|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rhelle:  the @h2 may help - Lavinthal for @cs|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Of course, North also doesn't know that the 2@h opening was so weak in @h|pg||
nt|famus: bad everthing split i think-even trumps|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Iceland: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/iceland|pg||
nt|xenya: EW might have had trouble bidding this hand if left to their own devices |pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2  Levin 4@H East   but easier for them after Ginossar opened 2-suited 2@S|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: Well, that call undid the good work of finding the diamond fit.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: here we go again :)|pg||
nt|pawel90: o. teraz jest :)|pg||
nt|kit: Since declarer needs to ruff 1 club in dummy, it looks like his only hope is KQ doubleton of diamonds.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I think that's an excellent site by the way, thank you for that |pg||
nt|ritong: some play " strong K" these agreements have to be made for every pair|pg||

nt|rhelle:  hello|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes but too late I think|pg||
nt|rhelle:  no, just in time|pg||
nt|santyclz: N will think about what to ruff with on the 3rd @c, but it won't matter.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That might ddepend on whether he believed the SP signal that West had chosen to give.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the 3NT board that we watched a moment ago, the bidding and result were the same at the other table. You can check such things by hitting the MOVIE button at the bottom.|pg||
nt|athene: but as he is a passed hand i am not sure there is any need to make that distinction|pg||
nt|ady: likely to go down   will have to play exactly right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: most wil be in 4@S here I suppose|pg||

nt|cuan: now, perhaps - 2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rhelle:  East can only cross with a trump|pg||
nt|ady: east will need to let west win a spade to play a 2nd trump|pg||
nt|ady: should duck this|pg||
nt|famus: Lall gotta underlead his @s for Grue to play another @D|pg||
nt|ady: otherwise down 1|pg||

pc|d8|nt|santyclz2:  Declarer, of course, doesn't know it works but surely s has something for his preempt.|pg||

pc|cA|nt|boedhy:  he has only 1 trump|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ah yes - silly me|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think he should throw @c |pg||
nt|rhelle:  so he needs to discard, and wait until dummy is dead - South can hold up the @d 3 times|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Bauke takes second @d and plays @c|pg||
nt|boedhy:  west ruffs and now e WIjs ruffs third @d and they have @h to cash...|pg||

nt|psyck:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S, playing transfer responses to 1@C, basically denies a major - might promise diamonds but doesn't always for most pairs|pg||
nt|athene: now the big issue is, what does double mean?|pg||
nt|szalay: does anyone know the reason?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S not 5@S 4+@H unless game force|pg||
mb|d|nt|rhelle:  1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|boedhy:  these board tend te get in teh way if you let it make early in the match|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is there but south is worried about his singleton spade.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 6@c 1@d  o 5-4 minore sing @S|pg||
nt|ady: anotgher lightish opening|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@d - 2@d seems reasonable|pg||
nt|athene: double is either spades, or takeout of clubs, or takeout of diamonds|pg||
nt|remo: continua la saga del "non c'è enne @H senza enne @S"|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rhelle:  1@s = @h, unbalanced|pg||
nt|kit: I can't imagine not bidding 3@C on South hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt shows major-minor, shapely|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: you have to know which|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: or pd pls bid something I have enough=X|pg||
nt|athene: without any special agreements, most people play that double of any artificial bid shows that suit (e.g. doubling stayman)|pg||
nt|ady: double from south showing spades |pg||
nt|athene: the problem now is if north "raises" spades, he will wrongside it|pg||
nt|athene: that may very well be his concern here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: north asking about 1@s, if east can have 4card M|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise 2 or 3@S looks clearcut|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: only if GF with long @d 4M is possible|pg||
nt|ady: the hand belongs to n/s in spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 2@S looks more logic then imo|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 1@C - 1@S playing these methods is a bit like 1@C - 1@D playing Walsh; i.e. you might have a major but only with a really strong hand that is going to bid the major next, ...|pg||
nt|athene: forcing to game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm trying to find out|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1NT = relay|pg||
nt|ady: may get to 4@H     not a great contract   but can make|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4333 quite obviously not interested in stayman of any sort|pg||
nt|ady: why is it wrong sided    must eventually lose 2 diamonds and 2 clubs whoever plays spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and what about PASS?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H is 11+, 4@H just practical with 4-card supp|pg||
nt|eggy:  practical and perhaps optimistic :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we started play about 10 minutes before other table  so they get to see our results|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  3  Israel again opens 2-suited preempt  this time 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin in the normal 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so expect 5 imps to Israel on 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry on  3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4-fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: line-ups had to be submitted 15 min after the last session of yesterday|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if their are health reasons??|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: some of the player only found out later that the captain had made a switch|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|boedhy:  Rob Helle is teh coinventor of teh system Muller de Wijs are playing|pg||
nt|athene: overcalls are 3 or 4 cards with a longer suit somewhere else|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H has a chance, 4@S is down on the heart ruff |pg||
nt|gulyas: in the meantime, OR made 5@Cx on bd2, for another 14 to Ned, leading by 25, nice start|pg||
nt|hlortz: well being from US i am rooting for them but its a tough road|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like a normal 4@H hand -- should present no problems in bidding or play|pg||
nt|kit: amazingly enough, N-S stopped in 2@H in other room, so chance for big pickup for Italy|pg||
nt|kamyk: kiery ujawnione - mo¿na unikn¹æ rafy 3BA|pg||
nt|athene: i don't mean it necessarily will be better as the cards lie to have south play spades|pg||
nt|athene: but that is what north will be thinking|pg||
nt|athene: that is why he might be reluctant to bid spades himself|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  it puts pressure on opps and that's NS style|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I like Dbl a lot|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Johnny's favorite game try. Bid game and try to make it |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S is too unilateral|pg||
nt|tax456: 2sa è roba nuova|pg||
nt|cuan: 2NT by North not by west|pg||
nt|tax456: ahh|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@h = 4@h, 5+@d|pg||
nt|athene: so according to that scheme, lauria could have overcalled 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: or 1@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe, vulnerable, he thinks it's unduly risky|pg||
nt|athene: this looks like fairly old-fashioned precision club, so NS are just bidding naturally after the 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/USA%202/hurd-wooldridge.pdf|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: interesting point|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: rusinow leads|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S   shows spade control?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which doesn't say a lot for their system, NS need to cah their 4 winners|pg||
nt|hlortz: the latest system of game tries is bid game and try to make... should fail here :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1@D was one of their transfer responses|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ie. last minute changes may be allowed for non bridge reasons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amazing   since they didn't pre-submit a convention card for this pairing|pg||
mb|d|nt|rhelle:  2@s = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2NT = short in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@S transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S transfer to 2NT apparantly|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20  north declined to balance|pg||
nt|ady: even with the balanced shape  3NT could have been in jeopardy on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: will start on @C and probably make 10|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi Bob|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi Bob|pg||
nt|athene: which otherwise you would want to do, with that hand, as a pre-emptive measure, surely?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  surprising that W passed|pg||
nt|jfeld:  wow.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: quite possible that in the other room west opens a weak 2@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: good convention.|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a diamond guess to make 4@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@d = 2+ in third seat Vul, because they up the 1NT range to 14-15|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@H IF brave|pg||
nt|eggy:  I don't like pass apposite it though!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but lauria-versace seem to be very conservative with their weak twos, and weak jump bids in general|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's seems those Italians always have a right gadget to describe their hands perfectly.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if ducked to HQ, a club shift will beat it.  So declarer may decide to go up with HK and wor on spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Narkiewicz bardzo kaszle|pg||
nt|hlortz: is it totally clear to rise aC if decl leads it early?|pg||
nt|ady: 3 diamonds should be down 1   so not much in this hand |pg||
nt|warrens:  how can North not bid 3@S over 3@D?|pg||
nt|athene: i think there might well have been a subtle misunderstanding here for NS|pg||
nt|eggy:  opposite|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with three small @H, what does pd have|pg||
nt|fluffy: Cullin didn't want to bid spades once Hurd show them before (or perhaps he couldn't as it might be taken as cuebid)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: on the SW side W didnt alert the DBL in the first round until a little|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: later|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and then S had allready put down the 1@s bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: obviously a heart lead sets the 9th trick for declarer, but other leads seem to just slow the inevitable|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but after the alert from W -- S took it back -- and shows @s now instead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: can he make this after @C lead?|pg||

nt|xenya: but unlucky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably same bad break in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  3@s = 0-4-6-3|pg||
nt|boedhy:  WIESMULLER = Tarzan that is what they called their system|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Now North knows the @c losers will go on the @s AK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Takes away a round of bidding and may suggest a good opening lead.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: now they can manage two heart ruffs if they diagnose the layout|pg||
nt|fluffy: thx Jan this might be an UI thing declarer|pg||
nt|fluffy: sadly for wooldridge he has run from a making doubled game|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  so he will get excited!|pg||
nt|kit: And in fact, N-S have profitable save in 5@C, and pushing opponents to 5@H (which likely would have happened) is a big bonus|pg||
nt|athene: slam might be harder to reach if west opened 2@S - what do you do with that north hand? just punt 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, no need to pre-empt opps if they don't bid slams even when given a free run|pg||
nt|athene: really you should not miss this slam|pg||
nt|athene: if you play a strong club and opps politely yield you the floor|pg||
nt|psyck:  Declarer can make if he readds card right|pg||
nt|psyck:  could have also made on @d lead if he guesses right as defense cannot get @d ruff & @c trick|pg||
nt|psyck:  as dec can afford a @c loser if he reads @s, he should avoid the finesse here|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: So many plusses in bidding.|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry not|pg||
nt|fluffy: with a spade lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: ducked|pg||
nt|fluffy: it goes down|pg||
nt|xenya: unmakeable on a non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bertheau-cullin  and  nystrom-upmark have had recent successes in ACBL national pair events|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: lall wants to play everything natural after 2@s showing 4@s|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg:  1NT was raptor showing 4@s and a 5 card minor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 5@C XC was a beauty play by Drijver in OR b2|pg||
nt|fluffy: Drijver- Brink playing only 3@s on board 3, this means at least 10 IMPs for Italy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: GM Rob.|pg||

nt|hlortz: well done|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Iceland must watch out, they are quite safe but losing 25-x they might be out|pg||
nt|jfeld:  When in doubt, bidding 4S over 4H is a good policy.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rhelle:  4@c = relay, asking for controls|pg||
nt|boedhy:  still needs the third round @H control|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@d = 2 controls; an ace or 2 kings|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can he ask for it?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, and he will|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@h = relay, asking for high cards|pg||
nt|ady: 7 easy    8th have to work for|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bobh1: winning this match might help Poland get back in the hunt|pg||
nt|xenya: not much for the play here -- 3@D just making|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3NT makes too, of course. But hard to bid, as both players have a shaky @c stop|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Live scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|fluffy: excellent double by Per-Ola anyway, you are much more comfortable defending 4@d|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: Lall: 'I know it's Peter's play'|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rhelle:  5@c = @dK, @hK, nothing in @c|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|rhelle:  5@d = asking for more high cards|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@s = DQ, not @hQ|pg||
nt|boedhy:  On the last board at the other table Verhees van Prooyen were in the better 3nt contract, which on the layout is cold..|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so a good start for teh home team.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so really, NS are unlucky that South's red Q is in @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  otherwise they'd bid 7@d|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south would have been better to raise clubs right away|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Doesn't look likely.|pg||
nt|ady: careful defence will beat 3NT  2 hearts 1 club and 2 other aces|pg||

nt|fluffy: declarer could make now 11 tricks for +150, but that is still not much|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: entries mean he is likely to make it on the lucky heart diivision|pg||

pc|h7|nt|boedhy:  still think a lot of pairs will end up in 7 @d tho and i dont see a way to make it|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@h I don't understand - that is a sign-off|pg||
nt|rhelle:  in my version - clearly they play this differently|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3 boards total 35 imps is a rocket start|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: not with S imo|pg||
nt|athene: south thinks that his free 2@S bid showed a really good hand |pg||
pc|s5|nt|rhelle:  I guess that they could sign off in 5@d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  taht should be possible...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and 5@h is the relay, and 5NT shows the @dQ and denies the @hQ|pg||
nt|ady: that will bring 8 tricks  unless 6 card spade suit out|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|ady: with 9 cold tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok -1|pg||
nt|rhelle: on Board 1 both pairs miss their 4@s or 5@d game and play in a partscore - clearly a tough board|pg||
nt|xenya: some action here|pg||
nt|ady: will get to 3NT either way|pg||
nt|athene: as south i would show a good club raise then bid 3nt i think|pg||

nt|fluffy: thats a bit light for a non precision opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I totally agree with this call.  South knows his side has at least 8 clubs and E-W have at least 8 hearts, so odds in favor of competing to 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: south should force this to slam i think|pg||
nt|athene: AJ10xx is a lot better than just 5 hcp|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1@S Narkiewicz?|pg||

nt|ady: though 6@C also ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@D usually unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: *predict*|pg||
nt|xenya: EW NV, so W will feel free to bid as many spades as he wishes|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, thanks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@D is a real suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=max, weak 2@D, 0/1@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|boedhy:  bidding 3nt is really strange....|pg||
nt|gracelin: Madala-Bocchi use trsf response to 1C opening|pg||
nt|famus: I'm gettin msgs from involved kibtz--they got their money onn these boys winning--that b a gr8 morale booster for youngsters the world over|pg||
nt|kit: This is a bold bid at adverse vulnerability, but it is effective as it drives E-W too high|pg||
nt|lechcold: niestety w  2 Grzegorz przegra³ 3NT, które ju¿ móg³ zrealizowaæ:(|pg||
nt|psyck:  np Filipe, you got the important play right, was immaterial at end :)|pg||
nt|eggy:  not particularly safe - only 6 1/2 clear of 9th|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I like that kind of treatment, very popular in Europe not so much in US I understand|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if W splinters next, might get to 6|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but RKC should avoid that|pg||
nt|jfeld:  correct, I sometimes play 1@d promises a good 4 card or 5 card suit, a suit that you don't mind partner competing in.|pg||
nt|jfeld:  but not that common in the US|pg||

nt|jfeld:  Joel thinking how high to bid. I bet he bids|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no it is W thinking|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S has bid 3@h|pg||
nt|fluffy: Per-Ola decided not to double 1@c with his hand, perhaps for the vulnerability|pg||
nt|fluffy: wonder if he would had opened had east passed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: none of this has improved Fallenius' hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hlortz: will west try science or a simple 5@d?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: What a hand |pg||
nt|ady: hearts best spot for n/s|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@H down because of @S ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w may sac in @D|pg||
nt|xenya: 4N -- 2 suits|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good bid, 4NT.|pg||
nt|rhelle: Interesting 4@s bid from East. There is a school of thought (I adhere to it) that suggests to always raise your partner's preempt with 3-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: a quieter hand|pg||
nt|pawel90: NS maj¹ tu do wygrania nawet 5@H, ale obrona pikami jest dobra na kazdej wysokosci|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes @D the old joke what do u call an 8 card suit? trump!|pg||
nt|warrens:  an aggressive 5@C works.  Kit, you must love this :)|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult problem for Stansby, but he would have done a lot better doubling and collecting 500|pg||
nt|ady: defence can take spade and spade ruff   but nothing else|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes they may phantom|pg||
nt|roswolf: THE VUL MAY TEMPT THEM|pg||
nt|ady: 3 losers in diamonds  so can sacrifice at the 6 level|pg||
nt|oosmanb: into writing in all caps? :)|pg||
nt|xenya: even with a doubleton honour i would say...|pg||
nt|xenya: well, occasionally perhaps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@D/@H both make on @H finesse, may be difficult to bid.|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes. In this case, without the 4@s bid, South would have 2 rounds of bidding more, and could show his @s void|pg||
nt|rhelle: in the meantime North is regretting opening on an 11-count 4333 :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: a hand that Vul I'd never open|pg||
nt|xenya: he will be happy he did eventually|pg||
nt|fluffy: otherwise the hand owuld be headed for all pass!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not a successful lead     heart works out better|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting as well what 4NT actually means in this situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  North feels he is too weak to handle 1NT X|pg||
nt|kit: And here it pushed opponents to poor game|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S play 15+ - 18 for 1NT, so North was a shade light for that opening bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "good dummy" says Einarsson after W put down his cards - I agree :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and W layed down his @sK as it was just a small @s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in between|pg||
nt|jaapfr: some will bid as W|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can save for around  eight or eleven hundred|pg||
nt|famus: how much is 6@s costing|pg||
nt|xenya: N has a choice of bids -- 5@C/@D/@H|pg||
nt|athene: interesting use of double - few pairs play this way|pg||
nt|ady: not wild about east overcall of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: east may go for the spade lead on this bidding?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: dbl usually shows 4@s, but can be done on less, like on this hand. 1@s would show 5@s|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  operator adds 2 bids at the time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: exactly|pg||
nt|fluffy: everything is lieing well enough for EW, and 11 tricks are possible on a spade guess|pg||
nt|fluffy: but soth's silence makes it unlikelly for declarer to paly him for this strong spade holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  4  Pachtmann didn't bid with Fleisher hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: 20-20 split here|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@c is 10-15, with some poetic license 3rd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: silence|pg||
nt|roswolf: no caps lock on the blink:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so the players cannot know who is thinking from the operator|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H by W was an option but took the low road|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so the players cant here on the mouseclick is who hesitating or not|pg||
nt|jfeld:  surprising Einarsson did not want to look for slam with controls in the other suits and a good source of tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I prefer to not be in slam missing A + trump Q|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  unless I have 10 trumps - then you can actually show trump Q in RKC Blackwood without having it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: th concept of maximum and minimum weak two bids depend where you live|pg||
nt|szalay: its originally a Dutch convention|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and position of the moon|pg||
nt|szalay: backfired now as well|pg||
nt|jillan:  AND who is playing them|pg||
nt|szalay: because of gave 2 much information|pg||
pc|s4|nt|idc: The defence had to stay away from both pointed suits here (@s & @d) which wasn't an easy task for them|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's just hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|rhelle: although South is not allowed to draw this inference, he knows that North has a long think over 4NT|pg||
nt|athene: if west's redouble of the negative double would have shown a heart honour, then east knows the hearts probably won't get the job done|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: Aust allowed to make that 4@S for an early 12 imp lead|pg||
nt|antoniz: ciekawa rozgrywka|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie trafi³ po prostu po³o¿enia króla pik|pg||
nt|antoniz: 4pik by³o za 300|pg||
nt|psyck:  whatever it was, it worked|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will sac on insurance principles?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: how bad is 6@H without looking at ew cards i.e @S distribution|pg||
nt|bobh1: W will lead a @S but E will not know why|pg||
nt|ady: even without a spade lead   only can make 11 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: East probably doubled|pg||
nt|bobh1: is it because he has a singleton or because of the rdbl|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: this may well fail|pg||
nt|psyck:  W did not want to bid his poor @s suit i presume|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not surprised if the director was called at the end of this board|pg||
nt|xenya: normal treatment|pg||
nt|ady: good lead    without the 10@D 3NT could just be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|athene: going for diamonds is not a bad shot|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't understand the Q from W here|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @D8 was better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D  4th suit force|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will grue split his honors when fallenius leads up a @d?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C as weak two in diamonds or strong hand was invented by ira rubin and played by him in 1966 world championship|pg||
nt|ahollan1: win 1st @S often highlights fear of shift to another suit|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: So another 10 IMP's for Italy|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But given 3@S was a singleton, really shouldnt venture 6|pg||
nt|jfeld:  agree, not a great slam here.|pg||
nt|fluffy: if Hurd manages to ruff 3 diamonds in dummy he won't need to guess teh spades|pg||
nt|fluffy: but I think he doesn't have enough entries for that|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh well south has to lead first! and spade lead is appealing|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rhelle:  South is now advertising a rally big hand - and North will bid 3NT|pg||
nt|boedhy:  bidding 3NT yourself much safer|pg||
nt|rhelle:  9 tricks are of course easy once the @cQ drops|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so the NS aggressive auction looks like paying off|pg||

nt|ady: now 13 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: good sac|pg||
nt|bobh1: he will work it out because of the auction|pg||
nt|xenya: and this makes -- somewhat fortituously|pg||
nt|rhelle: Now, how should East signal? He 'knows' the @sAce will be ruffed|pg||
nt|xenya: you normally don't bid a slam missing an ace and the trump King|pg||
nt|fluffy: there you go, now he will make if he plays trumps before north ruffs a spade|pg||
nt|fluffy: if he plays a diamond, he will later need to play @cA+@c to avoid the ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess that means 3@C would show  5413 distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: otherwise it seems to me more important to tell about @C filler|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Some players would not have bid 3@C, vulnerable, worried that partner might have only 3 clubs. But you can see that making that pre-emptive bid has pushed E/W around.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is likely to have 1 honor for the bidding, if it's a @h this is a good contract.  The @sk dooms it.|pg||
nt|kit: Still likely 1 loser in each suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually it has value|pg||
nt|lechcold: bêd¹ punkty w 19, nasi nie poszli w obronê pikami|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a practical lead - looking for the 2nd trick assuming @HA is the first|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: not easy to defend here?|pg||
nt|szalay: NOW he will split for sure|pg||
pc|hA|nt|boedhy:  and 109xx of @d helps bogtime with that lead|pg||
nt|idc: Hard ask for East to lead a trump from a singleton at trick one, but a @c lead would have given declarer more problems|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: @cAQ throw a @s on @cJ|pg||
nt|ady: heart shift now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sweet choice for Poles|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i think i would do so too at the table|pg||
nt|oosmanb: excellent save|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: Need both king and 10 of spades onside|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S easy making, so looks like a +board for Sweden|pg||
nt|psyck:  also may have been worried of 3@s being passed if pd was weaker|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  claim +1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now it is really difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but very understandable that Kamil was worried about leading toward @HT9xx|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: long haul to 4th spade    meantime club switch best|pg||
nt|ady: then still 3 losers|pg||
nt|athene: well, the queen would be right if his partner had @DKxxx|pg||
nt|warrens:  only right if partner has led from AKxx|pg||
nt|athene: leton|pg||
pc|c5|nt|boedhy:  bigtime|pg||
nt|warrens:  and declarer has 10x|pg||
nt|fluffy: notice the important @s8 unblock from hand, this might probe vital in the end when he fineses south for the 9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr vg: but still N would make 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: giving declarer @DA10 doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: 9@D better  first trick from west  but then declarer would then play the clubs safely so west could not get on trick|pg||
nt|xenya: neither N nor S have any idea of W's club holding|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: so 8 tricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  or Kxxx|pg||
nt|eggy:  certainly poor after North's double I think|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Gerben42:  +2 even|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarers failure to play on diamonds indicates he has at most one card in suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this line screams singleton @D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rhelle:  another claim - 10 tricks|pg||
nt|pawel90: jakby Piotr zagrywa³ atuta ze sto³u unikna³by promocji. Tak -2|pg||

pc|s3|nt|antoniz: po piku,partner wyrzuci Waleta karo- to nakaz w kiera|pg||
nt|fluffy: now if @c 2-2 the contract is safe, he has to now find something that makes if clubs are 3-2|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3-1|pg||
nt|fluffy: he can play for clubs 3-1 and spades 3-3|pg||
nt|fluffy: ruffing diamond in dummy a heart in hand, a diamond in dummy and pulling trumps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hlortz: needs to find Sj t.o dbl gives clue|pg||

nt|andyv:  so far the new partnership has done very well|pg||
nt|rv: 22 unanswered IMPs for Sweden since this morning|pg||
nt|jillan:  This match is going back and forth like a roller coaster. Hope my stomachis up to it|pg||
nt|rv: usually new partnerships do very well initially, some call it honeymoon period:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzns: I didnt see norths second pass but East is thinking here and not north|pg||
nt|jillan:  as I told you before, the Swedes hava a tradition of changing partnership to keep up the honeymoon if you so want. Theyhave been doing it for decades|pg||
nt|rv: both sides of partnerships will tread very carefully in the initial days|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jillan:  danger ground...|pg||
nt|rv: I don't fancy Upmark's chances here, we could have new leader once again|pg||
nt|andyv:  a chance for another big swing|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think 3N will make since E will probably be forced to play @s to 10|pg||
nt|rv: Wooldridge has a tough lead problem though|pg||
nt|andyv:  @hs are out |pg||
pc|dT|nt|rv: if he leads a pointed suit, it might improve Upmark's chances considerably|pg||
nt|andyv:  and there is the 9th trick|pg||
nt|jillan:  you know the old proverb: "you have to risk something to gain something" ;=)|pg||
nt|rv: Upmark might play @HA and @H back instead of playing on @s here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: this hand is not still not over|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  at this point, E will have 2@ds, 4@s 2@c and 1@h|pg||
nt|jillan:  it is faaar from over|pg||
nt|andyv:  has to be careful with the @h suit here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: I suspect he will go down|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@c and @h, @d back and he will go down|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|andyv:  A@h|pg||
nt|jillan:  yes Andy, we know that, but declarer forgot his see-through-glasses aIthink :)|pg||
nt|rv: now @D9 back and easy 1 down|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|andyv:  is 9@d obvious here?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 65@h play may have been an echo|pg||
nt|andyv:  if playing reverse smith, it discourages a @d lead|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|jillan:  phew, first hurdle|pg||
nt|rv: Wooldridge needs to duck this for defense to have any chance|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|andyv:  he needs to duck @ss twice|pg||
nt|jillan:  well what else can Upmark do then play the @SK?|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, NS play reverse Smith and the 65@h discouraged a @d return|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, I do think that N could have worked out  that the 9@d was the key to the hand|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|jillan:  or the @SQ of cpurse :)|pg||
nt|rv: we have to realise these guys are playing for 9th successive day and errors are bound to increase|pg||

nt|santyclz: Right, so "good" was an overbid.|pg||
nt|ady: push|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could have made him guess|pg||
nt|famus: too much for Grue--to work out:) wonder what mood wud be the Brazlian sitting in W posn b?|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't see how W could X with 5 @H's.  Madala's bid did it.|pg||
nt|kit: This is a fair 4@H contract, but the 4-1 split probably defeats it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: again majors v minors|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no TD called...|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  EW might feel a bit worried now, so far their card isnt convincing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lowest score posted this set   450|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|boedhy:  better to be in 3nt..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooh double game swing USA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  intersting hand ... expect fireworks!|pg||
nt|kit: Flannery, may be 4-6 or even 5-6 as we see here|pg||
nt|xenya: they were just a bit slow -- no big deal|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: will not or did not?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|boedhy:  offcourse South Africa not among the favorites|pg||
nt|rhelle:  true - but a very solid team|pg||
nt|brolucius: Terence Reese once described Flannery as the worst bidding convention ever invented. "It copes with a distribution that causes no problen whatsoever with natural bidding,' was his ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: view.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: at this vul they open weak nt|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Not everybody's 2@h bid...|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes 4@h let thru in OR|pg||
nt|ady: might be 1@S passed out again|pg||
nt|pelu: ok when he lose 3 @D-tricks - then down 1 :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  6@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  although Apteker Gower are a good international pair|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 4 isreal bid to 4@S down 2 off the top|pg||
nt|ady: all game down I would think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=@C & @D   if he's good enough for that|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|boedhy:  And teh Netherlands are among the topfavorites especially on home turf|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@c will be lead directing|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is very high up on Roland Wald's list of the world's 10 worst conventions too.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Roland agrees.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It has always staggered me that so many very good players use it.|pg||
nt|kit: big advantage of Flannery is that you don't have to respond 1@S to 1@H on a 4-bagger, so opener knows it shows 5.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, it will be 12-14|pg||
nt|gracelin: There is an excellent interview to Bocchi on the net.  I just don't know how to copy to long address to present to you.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@s asks for minor|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3@d shows more d@s than @cs|pg||
nt|ady: games|pg||
nt|ady: but the majors only can make 7 tricks on the lay|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  bd 1 might have worked out differently on another lead, then 4 and this thin slam "missed"|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  many pairs play 2@C as a gadget here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I guess 2@c is Gazzilli like|pg||
nt|fluffy: he actually combined both chances sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  well ... I think Italy is very strong, especially in the absence of the alltime strong USA teams|pg||
nt|brolucius: Roland thinks the convention is so totally awful that he forbids commentators to use the F-word. (I will let your one aberration go unreported on this ocasion, Kit.)|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for 3NT e/w|pg||
nt|idc: The 3@c is minimum & without 4 card @d|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Some won't with 4 cards in the other major, some won't with a void, some will with one of those flaws but not both.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = good 12 to 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: WE graj¹ Precison|pg||
nt|idc: a 3@d response to 2NT would have been 4 diamonds, min or max|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very costly for Australia|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some back here I expect|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a razorblade sharp 4@S needs @C lead to beat?|pg||
nt|ady: no   strong club |pg||
nt|ady: minors have 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  South X of 5@c is interesting|pg||
nt|kit: Well, if I get fired it won't be the first time in my life :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: The x took no room, 4@c might have given e a problem --  although not in this case.|pg||
nt|daman:  http://neapolitanclub.altervista.org/eng/and-now-lets-talk-about-bridge-interview-to-norberto-bocchi.html|pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks, George.  You helped me out|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1@D nic o karach nie mówi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H denies 4-fit   not sure if they ever superaccept w/3-fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you did it al, jinked the cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guilty|pg||
pc|c8|nt|boedhy:  yes probably has a specific meaning..|pg||
nt|rhelle:  showing the desire to compete|pg||
nt|famus: at worst wud b a 5IMP swing--dunno|pg||
nt|kit: tempting to bid game with 3 aces, even though only 12 points and 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  some have names of players like Gazzilli, there's also Bart and Lisa convention :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|boedhy:  and now he has done his part and passes|pg||
nt|ady: might make 12 tricks as they lay|pg||
nt|ady: might make only 9 if spade is ducked early by defence|pg||
nt|ady: when hearts split well will have 9 tricks and be relucant ti risk diamond finesse|pg||
nt|idc: as has been pointed out to me, a good thing E-W missed their @s fit|pg||
nt|hlortz: fredin will NOT go down this time :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt : 4@Hs + 5 toptrricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: i predict...|pg||
nt|rhelle: so West's game try is aggressive|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: looks like it works now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and in scandinavia I have heard about "Hexan"|pg||
nt|fluffy: wooldridge not excited about the game try in clubs :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: his @sKQ are more useful than he thinks, still 3@h will have a lot of trouble to make|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "Sorry for what I am about to show" says Wooldridge before putting his cards on the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  4  Levin-Weinstein stop in 5@H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rhelle:  NS need to cash their 3 tricks in a hurry|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but looking at the hands....|pg||
nt|daman:  my oleasure     a great interview|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3@d = more @ds than @cs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the problem here was the wide range 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: needs to win in east hand to make 12|pg||
nt|barnets: we can see that but he is trying to guarantee just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: on this lead|pg||
nt|barnets: there is no absolute guarantee I can see|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: take the A , play @D and then take safety play perhaps for 9|pg||
nt|barnets: when he loses the lead the def shift to a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: attitude lead|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder if any Multi 2@d users will play 6@h by West and suffer a ruff at trick one|pg||
nt|idc: or perhaps East passes in some matches and West becomes declarer that way|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H lead|pg||
nt|ady: ?|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  otherway up|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S may make if they let him get the 4th @D to discard a @C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes so no @C lead for declarer|pg||
nt|gulyas: @DQ lead looks normal, then game is cold|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1@S forcing 1n 2nd neg like 0-5 i think|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll pass non-vul|pg||
nt|pelu: no bet from me :)|pg||
nt|ady: 100 to poland   rather than a dodgy 130 bidding on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead and off.|pg||
nt|ady: this looks destined to be 1 down|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: down if @D played|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: back live again|pg||
nt|ady: but now on that lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: now made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with NS never bidding   i think that is very lucky result for LW|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lechcold: akurat w przypadku otwarcie 1@D nazwa "Precision" nie jest zbyt trafna:)|pg||
nt|idc: after a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|ady: yes     that is true|pg||
nt|gulyas: here she comes|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has plenty of problems in 3@H here.  Play at trick 1 itself is far from clear.|pg||
nt|kit: Due to the entry situation he will probably play hearts leading them twice from dummy, which is not a success on this layout.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: lucky guys, yes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|boedhy:  5! is cold|pg||
nt|kit: Good judgment by all to reach par here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no disrespect, but predictions involving fredin are precarious|pg||
nt|pelu: DD 6@C can make, but "impossible" to bid - and against all odds|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right, Martin, but when he see 9 "sure" tricks in 3NT - |pg||
nt|fabsayc: we see 9, he does not|pg||
nt|pelu: he hasa to be carefull in start - if @Ss 5-2|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure he "see" 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 off|pg||
nt|fluffy: with a club lead perhaps he would stand a chance, now he doesn't have enough entries to try double finese in hearts|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: West does not want to play a second top spade here.|pg||
nt|hlortz: might w dbl 3@S with the intent to pull @c to @D?|pg||
nt|kit: He will use this entry to make a spade play I'm pretty sure.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if north has 5 spades there is no 100% line, but on hand just playing hearts will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: you have not lost connection - it is Cullin doing some thinking |pg||
nt|xenya: now, that was an imaginative lead by N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: amazing @S stop|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the @s8 will be lavinthal for @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  South can see he needs 2 @d tricks to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so he needs the @dK in North|pg||
nt|rhelle:  might as well play the @dJ now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Fredin says "ill be very surprised if i get down on this one"|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: in fact needed a club lead|pg||
nt|ady: unless going wrong with spades|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: They show standard count on king lead 5-level or higher contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will have given count.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and make 10|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: better than the arvitrary 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 3 pades, 3 hearts and @CA for the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fallenius taking the ace very fast|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Fredin: never see him take a card that fast :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gulyas: it maybe tricky if they play a @C back|pg||
nt|ady: good lead     may be able to force and entry to west hand in diamonds for a heart finesse |pg||
nt|psyck:  I don't think S had a further bid on 2N|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|barnets: now he has the guarantee for his contract|pg||
nt|pawel90: niestety treflowy tu obk³ada³|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: Now, when West shifts to a heart East will have to deduce that reason West didn't cash second spade is that it isn't cashing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: bound to lose the @D for safety|pg||
nt|famus: gets an additional entry|pg||
nt|hlortz: both sides have used trump leads on defense well|pg||
nt|athene:  hi :)|pg||
nt|athene:  sry private :)|pg||
nt|ady: in fact 9@S entry   so should make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|jfeld:  I'm a big fan of BART|pg||
nt|jfeld:  esp reverse BART|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now Wooldridge at a crossroads|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I'm currently reading Rodwell's book and cutting communication by the defense, that works here :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a @H return strands dummy's @C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gracelin: 3C is also making here, so either 9 or 10 tricks will result in a tied board|pg||
nt|idc: Now declarer can claim, overtrick if @sK right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: try this if you want to see live play, not very exciting http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|hlortz: this looks 2 off but i may wrong by a trick|pg||

nt|jaapfr: we agree on most pairs will bid this and most will make it?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|malpaluche: @d j'aurais compris|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: East has advertised length in the majors, so declarer will probably play West for the @DQ.|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say north had K10xx in diaimonds and hearts were 4-2|pg||
nt|jkotor: 4@s na przeciwnej, ³adnie naszych wyblokowali|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|boedhy:  difficult to see who must bid again|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
nt|kit: Note Levin's heart plays -- trying to hide king of hearts so declarer places him with other high cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer just needs one of SA/HK to be on side.  In fact both are.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the t/o X was left in for 300 OR|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but think  South has a sort of lesser rick decision|pg||
nt|boedhy:  risk|pg||
nt|kit: I doubt if declarer will be fooled here, but still good defensive technique|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: he would be down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must have been @SK  asking for unblock or count   then @Sx|pg||

nt|barnets: on a spade switch|pg||
nt|ady: 1 imp for USA|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  problem is he doesnt know that much about E distribution|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: guess he will cross ruff to 10 tricks for the same imp as 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|twcho: best if EW plays non-leaping Michael here|pg||
nt|gulyas: has to decide if he plays for the @HA to be onside, or the @Ds to be good, but this is better, of course|pg||
nt|kit: I'm really surprised he got the hearts right considering the entry problems.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: club back too late|pg||
nt|xenya: if N goes up @CA on the second club that is|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|ady: should get this right|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: he will is my bet|pg||
nt|ady: can be a nice swing for Autralia|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @D lead not so clear so mb a push more realistic?|pg||
nt|xenya: S must go up @DA |pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  North never had chance to show help in @H   Upmark needs to guess @H later in the hand and gets it right|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gracelin: he is happy with 9|pg||
nt|fluffy: wow! he played almost double dummy|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that part is easy :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gracelin: now he might reject the H finesse for a safe 9 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck:  so the swings continue & the score reamins tight|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: When declarer runs the trumps West will have to keep the @SA and so unguard the diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would allow declarer to pick up the suit when West held x-x-x (and had to throw one) and East started with Q-x. |pg||
nt|santyclz: China took a 5 imp lead when on bd 2 w chose to lead the @dk, s ruffed the 3rd round high and finessed into the stiff @cq.|pg||

nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|brolucius: The diamond position is known as a show-up squeeze, because East's @DQ-x may become 'shown up' after West has been forced to discard a diamond. When West follows low on the 2nd ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: round, his card is known to be his last in the suit.|pg||
nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense is playing with fire, jorgensen needs to avoid getting endplayed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade jack shift was totally safe after east discarded two cards in suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most pairs have gone to using King as strong lead against NT   in previous millenium Ace was the power lead|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  West 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  and then finding out he makes the contract|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 13 back looks like a match of big swings|pg||
nt|xenya: another slam for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C is excellent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 46 imps in 5 boards   buckle up  it could be rocky set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3352 has option of opening 1@C or 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C includes 20-21 Bal|pg||
mb|2N|an|22-24|nt|boedhy:  think this last one will loose|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2h is supposedly 10-12, multi for weaker hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@h = 6@hs 10-12 hcp|pg||

nt|fluffy: 1@c is strong 16+ (17 in balanced)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=22-24|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all - good "morning"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: upgrade looks right|pg||
mb|d|an|take-out|nt|kit: Weinstein evaluates his hand too strong for 1NT opening due to good 5-card club suit and 2 aces.|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H call shows 5 spades, 4 hearts, invite values if I remember|pg||
nt|brolucius: The US South did enter on the @CK-Q-J-x-x-x hand and they then pushed E/W to 5@S for a 13-IMP swing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lost connection, up to speed now|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 4H with the right guess of S, but they lack the points to go that high|pg||
nt|lechcold: to nie bêdzie prze³omowe rozdanie chyba..|pg||
nt|psyck:  this looks like another mildly swingy board|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   can make 5@D     |pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a save for n/s|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: interesting fight here this board|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@S from west, 3@H from north, and south will bid 4@S on the basis of the sixth spade|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so will end up in 3@H now|pg||
nt|fluffy: You're back jan?|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is board 23|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  against 5@s doubled|pg||
nt|pelu: can make - but not bid 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so you were right Martin :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and this has stolen the board|pg||
nt|gulyas: SD, not DD|pg||
nt|ady: likely heart game    12 tricks maybe without diamond lead|pg||
nt|pelu: some would bid 2@S in W - but Es sk still stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: or 6 possibly|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 2nt showing a good heart raise; same thing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fleisher could have transferred over DBL  but anemic 4@H wasn't attractive|pg||
nt|xenya: will he act now? and if yes, how?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rhelle:  Normall NS play 1NT as a good 12-15|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but 3rd and 4th hand, vulnerable, they play 14-15|pg||
nt|rhelle:  to avoid unwelcome penalty doubles|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have the cc on my second computer|pg||
nt|kit: N-S in other room did well to stop in 2@S making|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@S 4@H 4@S and ???|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@d is normally weak but can be strong|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@h looks like strong|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c might be like viking club 5-7 balanced=|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he should raise, if only to block minor rebids|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay of diamond pips   |pg||
nt|bobh1: not on best defense|pg||
nt|xenya: but finding a 4-4 minor-suit fit is always a problem|pg||
nt|xenya: i can't see him sell out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  6    2N-3@C[puppet stayman]//3@D-PASS   what a creative auction from Bobby Levin|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  with all the good tens and the @h king onsite he will make 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|jkotor: na 5@c co trzeba trafiæ|pg||
nt|famus: did*|pg||
nt|kit: Nice 2NT call by Martel -- that is a fine contract|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like to open the field for opp to bid - so 2@S from W from me every time (and pd know that its a weak support)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C good bid, showing the side suit to help partner judge over 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: west might hope for 2 trumps tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: S 6@S but very weak|pg||
nt|athene: and indeed that would give west the information to double|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: Many thanks to our excellent VG operator for the bidding explanations. Roland told us that the operators have been practising for a while and they have certainly been very good.|pg||
nt|kit: Routine 4@S contract, will easily make 10 or 11 tricks, and almost sure to be same at other table.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so you are cheating|pg||
nt|psyck:  this could make a couple of o/t's or u/t's|pg||
nt|ady: 6 as A@H   and a trump trick to lose|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D is not the worst contract ever but doomed here|pg||
nt|ady: has|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, not inconceivable that NS will end up in 6@h - which is unfortunate due to the @h break|pg||
nt|athene: since he has a misfit in the minors|pg||
mb|d|nt|jaapfr: @D lead again:)|pg||
nt|ady: diamond bid by Sementa stopped any chance of 12 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@H NF |pg||
nt|gulyas: sry for those who do not know the terms yet: SD: single dummy (like a declarer at the table)|pg||
nt|pawel90: po pikowym trzeba dojæ od razu impasem kier do stolu|pg||
nt|kit: 3@D will make also|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 5@d looks like limit to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: S will realive with 4@S|pg||
nt|jfeld:  East has a lot of playing strength, but not many controls. well judged|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hope we get an explanation of the 2@C alert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks :)|pg||
nt|szalay: 800|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one benefit of rolling 20-21 BAL into 2@C is that it is possible to play 2@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so a partial pick up by USA1|pg||
nt|gulyas: DD: double dummy, seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|famus: good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes 110 for east west is the correct score|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks if defence cash 3 clubs   otherwise 11|pg||
nt|athene: south is pussyfooting around here a little too much i think|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i presumed:(|pg||

nt|fluffy: upmark showing his shape|pg||
nt|fluffy: will probably do all the distribution here with a bid between 3@h and 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  Well 5@h also played in the other room..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just following the guidelines for commentators :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and that great :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it is not always easy to see what the players are writing to eachother on their small pieces of pater|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: paper |pg||
nt|xenya: are they on a relay route -- seems like it |pg||
nt|xenya: that might help|pg||
nt|rhelle: from (sometimes bitter) eperience, these relay sequences can be tricky - especially with distributions that occur infrequently|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry for disconnection...|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing missed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no, tx|pg||
nt|rhelle: although the explanation isn't quite what South has got, it did locate the @c fit|pg||
nt|xenya: so N knows S's shape -- should be 6 clubs now?|pg||
nt|athene: combination of sixth spade and the diamond strength...looks like 4@S to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I could just see the notes Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good eyes|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: or 2@C was @C + @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could have been @C and another   if Barel hadn't bid 2@S we'd know for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pachtmann did bid over the DBL   so playing 3@H north|pg||
nt|pelu: against best defense down 3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ecatsbridge.com has cc for all participants|pg||
nt|ady: not much in this hand    maybe an imp|pg||
nt|idc: 2NT was a game-forcing hand with some @d support, 3@h we can only guess at|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@s will pose no difficulty for Weinstein|pg||
nt|hlortz: difficult hands with big swings at stake - fun for the kibs, onot so much for the players|pg||
nt|xenya: so EW had a smooth ride to 2@S here, and S, knowing about a fit in a red suit, reasonablt decided not to compete at the 3 level|pg||
nt|pelu: but dificilt to find|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: will they stop?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lechcold: 4@S = minimum-minimorum, 5@C = 1 as z 5|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: now it should be ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thx to my new glasses :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: commentators have to be careful not to get carried away with DD analysis: players can only see 2 hands, not 4|pg||
nt|xenya: N setting trumps, S cuebids @Ds..., |pg||
nt|fluffy: oh upmark bid 3@h instead of 3@d what a waste of space|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rhelle: now South will bid 5@c, I guess. It's hard to be too enthousiastic with no aces|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphznt: well, south knows 4@s will probably 2 off, since partner is a passed hand |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am still getting kibitzers querying that it was right to enter with 3@C over 2@C on that South hand. Everyone knows that they should interfere over a strong 1@C, but it is just ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: as effective over 2@C, when the opponents are almost certain to have a game and will want to show their long suit rather than double you.|pg||
nt|ady: well cashed|pg||

nt|athene: so he has to have four hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: also west was more or less marked with spade ace since opponents points had to be divided|pg||
nt|ady: flat   only 1 club out   so heart finesse was safe|pg||
nt|barnets: in open room wst in 5@H on @D8 lead|pg||
nt|idc: I guess declarer could lead twice towards his clubs on a red suit lead, so can't stop him getting a 9th trick on any lead|pg||
nt|xenya: very low-scoring, yes|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@H was for me the impulse to bid 4S as S:)|pg||
nt|athene: if NS bounced to 4@S fast, east might bid on, with 5530 with spade void|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jillan:  But Johan would you really bid 3@D with that S hand? Wouldn't that suggest a will to compete?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rv: this table is playing 9th deal in approx 1 hr 25 mins, they need to complete remaining 7 deals in 55 mins|pg||
nt|jillan:  and maybe a stronger @D|pg||
nt|jillan:  and with or without a @D bid, Where would the tricks come from? P is a passed hand..|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: Sementa checking the @D suit, for 4@S|pg||

nt|hlortz: think usa2 wont miss many slams ... just so they dont bid too may losing ones|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: waterbreak, few minutes|pg||
nt|hlortz: wie break here :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: wine|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know shere USA2 are in the standings?|pg||
nt|famus: is the youner age a factor here David??:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: i have this sticky n key lol|pg||
nt|pelu: OR NS 2@S - if making falt board :)|pg||
nt|ady: part score |pg||
nt|jfeld:  it choses the match anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: play was very fast there after the @c lead :)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  unless both USA teams win, then its choice is nullified if Italy chose to play a US team|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if it goes just something like 1@S 2@H [gf] 2@S 3@H, then north might find a 4@D cue or something to show a good hand for hearts |pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  North has a monster hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Italians can win imps either by overbidding or underbidding.  You have to admire their judgment.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is why when you are in 2s you draw trumps and claim 3, so you dont do something stupid on the important boards|pg||
nt|ady: nothing nuch on here|pg||
nt|idc: So we have taken just 55 mins to play half the boards at this table, plenty of time left|pg||
nt|jaapfr: open room time problems are expected (only 3,5 boards played in 50 minutes)|pg||
nt|psyck:  they also play kickback, so 4@d would have been KC|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  exactly|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  except that 4th place isnt decided yet :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lost opportunity for a write-up :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if lall played spade queen he would have to shift to clubs to avoid a one suit endplay|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some would overcall 1nt here, but pass looks fine with that shape|pg||
nt|athene: west may double 2@D|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|rhelle:  1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and indeed Prooyen Verhees also bid it and even made a uptrick|pg||
nt|brolucius: The KR evaluator program seems to take a bizarre valuation of jacks. Roland quoted an example where Q-J doubleton was allocated only 0.75 points, compared with x-x. Seems much too ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: little for me.|pg||
nt|athene: wait till they bid hearts, then double for takeout :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D shows H, as before|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I doubt Campos, Villas-Boa have ever gotten a slow play warning, much less a penalty!|pg||
nt|hlortz: usa2 started this match in 4th i think|pg||
nt|famus: :) i think they shud ALLOW it--bet- wud improve over all standard:)|pg||
nt|ady: thx for information kibs|pg||
nt|ady: 2 level high enough  |pg||
nt|ady: this hand going nowhere good|pg||
nt|athene: he certain will if it's non-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: he is in the "pre-balancing" position, to some extent|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "you played 1@c -- how did you bid that" :)|pg||
nt|eggy:  Then they may choose Israel, if they can as that is their best carry forward|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Their system got the bidding too elevated before south could describe his hand.|pg||
nt|antoniz: Walet kier by³ zlokalizowany,wiêc tylko 300|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup quiet hands now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rhelle:  1@d = 0-8|pg||
nt|athene: that's the classic recipe for that south hand|pg||
nt|hedyg:  they started 10 minutes later|pg||
nt|famus: at present tying with Netherlands in 2nd spot|pg||
nt|oosmanb: thats a scary 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: in other words he doesn't want 2@D to get passed out and it might well be about to |pg||
nt|ady: dbl competive  showing a club suit and spade tolerance|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes this double is called "snapdragon"|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Correct.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  in the VC, France has done their job with 25 VP vs Trinidad, but can be caught by both Netherlands and Germany if they win their match big|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: the dealer burned itself out with the grand slam|pg||
nt|ady: will this be 2@H X|pg||
nt|ady: no|pg||
nt|roswolf: the poles have no fear|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very light 1@D, 3rd seat.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|boedhy:  Apteker was very happy to be in it and played very save..|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1@h = 19+|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = 6-8, balanced|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can they get 6@s in south....|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so any 4333 or 4432|pg||
nt|boedhy:  which is very good|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is the Vul for weak NT.  North is in the range but decisde not to open on 5-4 distribution.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h and 3@C sh make - but thats max|pg||
nt|gracelin: when north did not open weak NT or rebid NT, south knows north has an unbalanced hand and should have 5+ clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: China in 2@H in OR|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@D = kiery|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N|pg||
nt|twcho: The south player, Edgtton, is only 19 years old and is probably the youngest player in this event.|pg||
nt|athene: but it's just a takeout double really, no need for a special name, no matter how pretty|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rhelle:  2@h = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@c = 4333 with a 4-card minor|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but the system will let it play in North probably and |pg||

nt|vugraphznt: to Jacek wytlumaczyl 2@d jako kara i starszy|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: now versace runs to hearts and north doubles |pg||
nt|athene: but south won't (shouldn't) stick this, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: cue 2@H, check for 44 spades, bid 3nt otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: even though it's nice to go for penalties at this vulnerability, you know opps surely have an 8-card fit|pg||
nt|athene: so defending at the 1-level might well be wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd think not.  His pass of 1@d doubled was likely influenced by the vulnerability.  As it is north was on the thin side of the double and might have eschewed the double of 1@h ...|pg||
nt|kareno: with such thin hearts.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is not making|pg||
nt|pelu: some work for 9 tricks here, |pg||
nt|gracelin: and as usual, Bocchi judged correct;y to stop in 3C|pg||
nt|barnets: looks ok to me|pg||
nt|idc: E-W task here to stop in time, since 4@s is as high as you'd want to get|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Brasilian player as a rule tend to be very fast.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sad pics on the news, the south island of NZ is under flood waters|pg||
nt|ady: need to attack spades to beat this|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Yes very surprising how close it is|pg||
nt|jfeld:  in the Venice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: On this hand, East may have upgraded his hand to 18 points, with two tens that accompany other honours, and two 4-card suits.|pg||
nt|pelu: difficult lead for East|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but with Bocchi beind the wheel, I thk he can hold his loss to at most 4 tricks.|pg||
nt|ady: looks though they are heading for game|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fast play --> fast dinner|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4 b 40 minutes then:)|pg||

nt|jkotor: ale z Kysiem to Jac gra³, ¿e to 4@d i 5+stary|pg||
nt|kit: Same 3@C call as made at other table.  I don't understand it.  It seem like game very unlikely opposite mere 2@C rebid.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rhelle:  3@d = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s = 3-3-4-3|pg||
nt|rhelle:  as South promises at least 1 control (a king), the North hand is now looking pretty good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then 6@s is is a little better then 50% because you can guess the @d and on a @d or non @d lead you get info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had he opened 1NT, which I assume shows 15-17, West would doubtless have stayed low. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Changing the 10,8 to the q,j on the hand above yields 17.5 points, still low but more reasonable.|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Weinstein didn't even search for a 5-3 spade fit.  He judged that with 3-3 in hearts and clubs it was very unlikely that spades would take 2 more tricks than notrump, ...|pg||
nt|kit: which would be needed for 4@S to significantly gain over 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point.|pg||
nt|yke:  3NT is questionable to me. with a 5-3 fit you should play in spades when the long spades is the weak hand and in NT when the long spades is the strong hand|pg||
nt|yke:  because you might not be able to enjoy the long spades because of the entries|pg||
nt|kit: with AQx of clubs, there is no entry problem to the long spades|pg||
nt|yke:  good point|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Einarsson had a lot of water and now he goes to the toilet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Amazing!  @ss are only 4-1 not 5-0.|pg||
nt|twcho: a trump lead will probably set the contract|pg||
nt|psyck:  KC is key card & kickback is bidding the suit above agreed suit as roman keycard blackwood...just don't ask me any more :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  this looks like a normal puppet stayman sequence|pg||
nt|ady: 7 tricks looks ok    need an 8th from somewhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fallenius could have tried 3rd seat 2@D as weak 2@H/@S opener|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: At matchpoints there would be more incentive to look for a 5-3 spade fit, since making 1 extra trick in spades is worth something.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: after laying down his cards|pg||
nt|psyck:  not so normal rather|pg||
nt|psyck:  3@d likely denying 4 or 5 card major|pg||
nt|psyck:  & 3@s puppet back to 3N maybe|pg||
nt|athene: a very good example here of how bad it is to hold three small in RHO's suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yet another contract that won't make|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  ah! a variation :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s is a strong 1-suiter, |pg||
nt|gracelin: even with this lead, if declarer is to ruff spade, he might lose a 2nd trump trick.|pg||
nt|pelu: some cross-ruffing af 9 tricks now - even play for 10|pg||
nt|gracelin: so likely there are still 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: def have no tricks|pg||
nt|ady: the lay out is friendlt|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 clubs one spade|pg||
nt|barnets: one heart or 1 diamond should make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re:)|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D is a close call 5 to 7 tricks for S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: with @D 3-1 this cant make on any defence|pg||
nt|athene: south's @Sxxx is a "death holding"|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  btw there were years that those 3 teams were the 3 medalists *g|pg||
nt|jfeld:  all 3 of those teams were heavy favorites pre-touranment to qualify|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  one of them will be out|pg||
nt|xenya: normal 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: probably a quick 1 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no    it will be a slow down 1|pg||
nt|xenya: oh, W might lead a spade...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might  but i think @DQ |pg||
nt|xenya: if a spade lead, it will be slow for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  although why North wants to play a @s contract himself is a mystery to me|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well South africa has bid it and made it|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in other room|pg||
nt|xenya: i would never open as S 3rd in hand, no matter what|pg||
nt|eggy:  Indonesia were perhaps a surprise package, but they have been very consistent.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Vlad leads better than I do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college  systems were devised to have me on opening lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  4@c is a cue|pg||
nt|twcho: now declarer may succeed by ruffing three rounds of @s in dummy|pg||
nt|famus: -1|pg||
nt|athene: you frequently are going to lose the first three tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4-fit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|idc: With the preempt, declarer not likely to take 2 club finesses through South, and also likely to get trumps right|pg||
nt|jkotor: tu jest odwrotnie, wiêc co kto pomyli³ (3@h wygl¹da na "mam 33+ stare do 5+ partnera")|pg||

nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|athene: with the lead coming through partner's king or queen|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: not easy. 8 tricks there and work for the 9th.|pg||
nt|xenya: and, if i were told to open at gunpoint, it would be 1@H (prompted by a kibitzer)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would you take @S or @C finesse?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|boedhy:  now...... sign of or low @d lead...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ai ... North may pass 4@s now|pg||
nt|lechcold: nietrafnie Grzegorz|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect declarer will play to ruff fourth spade if necessary|pg||
nt|jfeld:  easy to tab between all 3 events on Bridge Winners|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rhelle:  I still think North would have done better to keep relay'ing|pg||
nt|brolucius: West at the other table did try to cash two spades against 5@S doubled and allowed the game to be made. |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose one down against 4@S making in the other room|pg||
nt|kareno: That heart five in north could possibly have been promoted to a trick with persistence in diamonds after cashing clubs.  The play is complex|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: very quick @H9|pg||
nt|athene: he is thinking that if he doesn't overtake this and cash the @DK for a spade pitch, the defence can draw trumps and cash two spades|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case the nine was a poor choice because it opens him to the promotion.|pg||
nt|athene: but the trick comes back for the defence with a trump promotion in diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, he is always losing out one way or another - even if he didn't waste the nine, the defence can prevail|pg||
nt|athene: for example on a diamond if he can ruff high north can pitch a club and get a club ruff with the @H5|pg||
nt|idc: West won't be expecting a doubleton heart on his left, which might be the surprise that dooms this contract|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Particularly when s shows up with @h length.|pg||
nt|kit: Not much can happen here -- 5 unavoidable losers.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo @S better.|pg||

pc|sK|nt|rhelle:  but, let's be honest, it's a marginal slam. Around 50%, so staying out of it is no shame|pg||
nt|pelu: @C9 8 7 6 are strong ruffs|pg||
nt|gracelin: east has doubled 1C, so he doesn't have a singleton HK.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now ruffing finesse in spade is the safe route|pg||
nt|gracelin: if instead, going to dummy with HQ and play another trump, West can win CK and play D to force declare losing control.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT|pg||
nt|jfeld:  tough bid for Joel, the suit is good enough that it makes 3@S clear|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yesterday they had a match of 16 boards in 1hour 10 minutes|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|boedhy:  true|pg||
nt|boedhy:  two times|pg||

nt|rhelle:  yes, he could|pg||
nt|rhelle:  this is why I'm surprised|pg||
nt|kit: Easy to reach slam here it looks like -- South can just take control|pg||
nt|rensph:  hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: interesting decision for south now|pg||
nt|athene: pass, 3nt, 4@H, double?|pg||
nt|kareno: I doubt south can double for penalty which is no doubt what he would want to do.|pg||
nt|antoniz: szlemiczek na impasie,zobaczymy|pg||
nt|idc: borderline slam hand this|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: system systemem ale takie 4 króle i dam bez wsparcia mog³oby sk³oniæ do zdewaluowania rêki czy¿ nie tak?|pg||
nt|kit: E-W play 12-14 1NT -- Martel chose to downgrade his hand.|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S looks good for n/s|pg||
mb|3H!|an|support|nt|santyclz2:  Looks like another 6@hs available.|pg||
nt|famus: till now this match has gone very fast speed|pg||
nt|kamyk: no tak, to trochê ³agodzi ocenê (ale nadal mi smutno:) )|pg||
nt|ady: maybe short on a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: My choice under the circumstances would probably be the losing 3nt.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: back live|pg||
nt|hedyg:  :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg:  2@s is a position..you might bid 2@d and pass pd's bid|pg||
nt|ady: this is the fastest gamed I have seen for a long time   10th hand in around 45 minutes|pg||
nt|athene: the double of 1nt here is takeout of diamonds, of course|pg||
nt|athene: so south passes just with a good diamond stack|pg||
nt|ady: even then hard to stop 2 club ruffs    so 7 trump tricks and 3 hearts|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: declarer will need to guess the hearts|pg||
nt|lechcold: paqs|pg||
nt|lechcold: passs|pg||
nt|lechcold: proszê:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now what   2@D  3@H  4@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT is just marked as strong raise on the cards, but must be GF or South would not have bid just 3@H. |pg||
nt|santyclz: One of the few hands where blackwood answers all your questions.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most players use it as game-forcing rather than 'limit or better'.|pg||
nt|kareno: If west leads that tempting diamond it is all over for south.|pg||
nt|athene: well 3nt hasn't got many tricks even if the @DQ isn't found|pg||
nt|kareno: Actually 3nt is doomed anyway but the diamond makes it quicker :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  the open room, which started 10 minutes later, in a vain hope of getting comparisions, as now 4 boards ahead|pg||
nt|psyck:  *are now|pg||
nt|xenya: strong 1@C and some effective obstruction by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the main clue being north will already have shown two aces|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  6@ss fails on a @c lead.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: system say 5 card major ask GF'|pg||
nt|kit: Good shift by Martel.  He can see that declarer, known to have a minor, needs to ruff clubs in dummy.|pg||
nt|jfeld:  I thought north might make a responsive double, but he would be poorly placed over south's frequent 4s bid|pg||
nt|eggy:  EW may not think -1 is so bad on this hand as 5 of either minor needs a ruff to be found|pg||
nt|jfeld:  at the other table, they were more conservative and only opened 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i typed that before the bid|pg||
nt|xenya: just like this, 4@H...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and was going to say  probably not 4@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  south difficult decision now|pg||
nt|rhelle:  he didn't seem to think it was that hard :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  first double?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  penalties, no doubt - 16+|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West did not alert 2@C, thinks natural|pg||
nt|boedhy:  second double still take out|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2nd is take-out|pg||
nt|idc: N-S play a (mostly) game-forcing 2/1|pg||
nt|idc: and no doubt the sequence to 3@h will be forcing|pg||
nt|idc: South has bid this as a minimum opener with little slam interest, so North may give up now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H?!|pg||
nt|pelu: I can see 6@S is on, but I dont exp NS to bid more that 4@s|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kiwibridge: and what if the answer showed @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: w'll hurry|pg||
nt|jfeld:  over the 2@S-3@H continuation, I think North has a clear double|pg||
nt|szalay: doubt he wd make it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont see any way to make|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: W has a tough lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: needs to avoid leading a @D to beat this|pg||
nt|hedyg:  might lead @s|pg||
nt|gulyas: that could work|pg||
nt|pelu: Kibs dont agree with me - they go for 6@s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north has a huge hand actually they will bid slam|pg||
nt|hlortz: martel is pushing w/ north hand opposite 2n jump and @S support|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S now from south surely|pg||
nt|athene: well, he might bid only three, reasoning he has shown good values already|pg||
nt|athene: and his @DKJ likely wasted facing void|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead would mean a possible heart ruff   but then there would be 3 club ruffs for the same result|pg||
nt|athene: still he does have a seven-loser hand and he is vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he does know 5-4 fit, singelton can be good enough|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S solves matters|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gracelin: 2D is a safer contract than 1NT which can be set with 3S, 3C and a H.  Bocchi made a great lead to pave the way for a successful defense.|pg||
nt|idc: Had South tried a courtesy cue bid of 4@d (as he might) then I think they would have gone on|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  After 2 boards with good chances for USA, one with a chance for Brasil.|pg||
nt|gulyas: anything but a @D really:)|pg||
nt|famus: @C double hook gives him 9|pg||
nt|antoniz: ocena do kitu|pg||

nt|boedhy:  2@c minors|pg||
nt|rhelle:  oh, that lead will make EW trump short|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and if then NS play 3 rounds of trumps, the roof will come down|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this will be disaster for EW|pg||
nt|rhelle:  especially as the West hand is dummy, so the defence is much easier that way|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes|pg||
nt|boedhy:  the fact that he could lead the @s ten|pg||
nt|pelu: what a lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @D lead very unlikely imo|pg||
nt|garden2005: proby te¿ nie dos³yszeli|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 64 imps swung this set  for a total gain of NOTHING to either side|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rensph:  quiet 1NT for EW here, diamonds break 4-4 so will end up with 6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|gracelin: admittedly, he has no good lead with his hand.  He'd rather attack dummy's suit than declarer's suit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south thinks to overtake and shift if north leads from doubleton K10, south has no entry to eastablish his spade anyway.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hlortz: so did we lose the comparisons hen we crashed earlier?|pg||
nt|famus: @s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D switch required.|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S sort of torments partner a little|pg||

pc|s3|nt|pelu: in OR @H-lead from N - and easy make|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W pokazal 4333 10-13|pg||
nt|kit: seems like declarer might have been better off setting up a sure spade trick.|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree with wexcellent trump support and singleton club  full value for raise to game|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|boedhy:  now he will try to ruff a @d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so close to 6 tricks...|pg||
nt|kit: If Weinstein chooses to lead from a king he will lead clubs, since no double of 5@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: What a waste of a hand, a good relay pair could use 11 rounds of bidding to get to the same contract.|pg||
nt|kit: But the passive lead reasonable, and now declarer takes them all|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he allows Bocchi to have led from K10x.  He must have seen it before.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer can duck this as well and defenders still need to defend carefull to ge all their trics.|pg||
nt|famus: wht a lead Bocchi made--amazing|pg||
nt|antoniz: wietne zagranie|pg||
nt|xenya: 10, even 11 tricks shouldn't be a problem here |pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: as a result, NS are in a thin game that, i predict, will go down |pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: Well, I am back after an alarming computer crash. All is OK again, thank goodness. Did I miss anything good? |pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|ady: yes   quite a lot of intersting hands|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate lay of clubs    should be 9 tricks      south knows whwere every card is so not too difficult|pg||
nt|roswolf: the clubs are favorable this should make|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and now unbeatable|pg||
nt|ady: now likely 11 tricks   ruff finesse a club|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: wasn unbeatble before lead infact|pg||
nt|ady: dont think could ever really be beaten|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: forget typing errors : same meaning|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|idc: though as I said, it is borderline: a @c lead might doom it on a different layout, or hearts both wrong, or @s suit not coming in|pg||
nt|hlortz: well bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: has not made it yet|pg||
nt|psyck:  ok, still enough time...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: this lead will allow him to avoid trying for early club ruff|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: but dont lose a spade   if gives spade ruff   then diamond finesse to discard spade|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle:  3NT + 1 is quite a nice result from the other table|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H shows spades|pg||
nt|idc: In a 2/1 system I always like 2NT to be the 'bucket bid', were all the poorish hands go|pg||
nt|gulyas: @Hs could have been 3-3, or @HT falling|pg||

nt|ahollan1: fleisher will take low road now|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphznt: Nice tool, 3@D by lauria would be very good overcall in @S, perhaps more|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: RDBL = 3@ss|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i was going to guess 2@S :(|pg||
mb|r|nt|rhelle:  1NT = relay|pg||
nt|brolucius: East perhaps hopes to be able to redbi 3@D, to show that hand.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: given their light openings getting the chance to play 1@S may be an advantage|pg||
nt|twcho: east may probe for slam while west will reject at every opportunity|pg||
nt|gulyas: he was vul, thats all he neeeded:)|pg||

nt|psyck:  looks like they will duplicate the auction al the way through|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Wonder how 6C was made at closed room.  Seems the bad break in spades will sink it.  SA and spade will surely beat it.|pg||
nt|barnets: grandslam here|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@C show at least a sound raise to 4@H and promises nothing so far as a club control is concerned.|pg||
nt|barnets: bid in poland sweden match|pg||

nt|oosmanb: making lots with the @S lead|pg||
nt|xenya: all you need is clubs no worse than 4-1 plus some additional chances|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: now has to bid 4@c, whereas an immediate 3@c might get him to 3@c only|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I guess this was a Lebensohl sequenze from N|pg||
nt|jfeld:  this looks like it is headed down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I could have passed 1@c -- but last time you went down 3 so I didnt dare to do it again - said Hurd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher sequence still keeping game in view   but i don't know which hand would have play after PASS over DBL|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double will help lall if he bids 3@S now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rensph:  They did manage to avoid 6@D but I believe south could've cuebid over 4@D|pg||
nt|twcho: nothing about @d|pg||
nt|oosmanb: will take all of 40 secs to play|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: mb bids 3nt\|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are inferences there that escape me|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rhelle:  2@d = relay|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Muller is known for his slow play |pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@d = 3-1-5-4 exacty|pg||
nt|kit: 2@D by Bobby would not be natural -- however, 2@S shows invite values|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala will now hope for the best in trumps, I guess, and pot 6@H.|pg||
nt|kit: Martel fails to take his plus score -- big swing on his decision.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3nt very doomed|pg||
nt|athene: west's mere 1@S was a bit wet|pg||
nt|xenya: what is N trying to convey? |pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: What would he bid with 7-8 and a doubleton spade?|pg||
nt|kit: he would bid 2@H, transfer to 2@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see. It is good to have such accurate methods.|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS conducted a Gazzilli auction here.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2C is normal response to forcing 1NT or any 16-17 up hand, 2D is 8 p and GF|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@h shows 3 cards in @h|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@s is probably natural|pg||
nt|twcho: and 2N deny 4 cards in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no alert for 2@S|pg||
nt|twcho: tks|pg||
nt|hlortz: easy game Q@C falling nicely|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and 40 minutes for 6 boards is not much...|pg||
nt|brolucius: For the past few weeks I have been doing voice commentary instead of tap-in commentary. It is good to see that I can still type OK. |pg||
nt|santyclz2:  That has the benefit of a rebid of opener's suit showing 6.  Using the rebid of opener's suit as the |pg||
nt|idc: The 2@s bid in this sequence is invitational, 5-cards @s and unbalanced|pg||
nt|ady: absolutely dooomed especially played by south  where no chance of 2nd spade trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6+@S  game try|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: sorry  i was wrong about PASS  it doesn't necessarily show weak NT, but definitely 0-2@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good shift|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: 5@S was a fine bid by south|pg||
nt|barnets: holding just J high trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: he kept a grandslam option open|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wouldn't have risked it with those trumps!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 5@S was less serious try then 5NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: than|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Bob for the bidding explanations. How they find time for it, as well as putting in all the bids and plays, I will never know.|pg||
nt|ady: what is best lone in 7    ruff 4 clubs in south hand?|pg||
nt|barnets: with such good trumps perhaps north should have accepted the invitation to the party|pg||
nt|twcho: OK, east decide that slam is quite far-stretching and simply end the auction by bidding 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|boedhy:  luckly easy 3nt..|pg||
nt|barnets: the key to bidding many slams is who has control of the high trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: north knows his partner has invited a grand slam|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  "bucket bid" is another popular method.|pg||
nt|idc: And I don't think it implies holding hearts as well as the spades|pg||
nt|ady: now can beat this|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah a safety play|pg||
nt|famus: going down cud b a big swing|pg||
nt|psyck:  E did well not to double in spite of pd's double of 3@h|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pelu: East (Sementa) lead @sA - but then in trick 2 @DA :(:(|pg||
nt|famus: cud b a swing|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't blame him.  He was looking at his 2 Aces, and these Chinese did bid slam off 2 Aces before.|pg||
nt|barnets: and he has AKQ of trumps|pg||
nt|twcho: just a matter of overtricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: they stayed ouy of trouble|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, even 4NT is not cold|pg||
nt|twcho: the 1@c opening has dissuaded north from leading his stronger minor|pg||
nt|twcho: and this lead immediately give declarer the 9th trick|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have spade link so nowhere to go for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: well, i think if you were going to lead a spade from that east hand you would start with the ace or queen|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: at least -2|pg||
nt|ady: yes   but at least a chance of something happening for n/s   this way are going several down|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  10    FLAT BOARD|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not a lot of losers for declarer -- but not enought winners|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: so 11 to 14 IMP on way for China|pg||
nt|pelu: no down 1: 2x@h and @Ss|pg||
pc|d2|nt|famus: may be--cant say till it ends|pg||
nt|gracelin: As north has not shown his 6th spade here, East may not find the killing defense.  However, without cashing SA, I thk 6C is still in trouble.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he has shown 6sp and 4H already|pg||
nt|pelu: will S pass to 4@s?|pg||
nt|gracelin: don;t thk North will ass, South has shown 8+|pg||
nt|ady: not enough entries to ruff 4 clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see how important the 4@C bid was set the slam ball rolling. If you could only bid 4@C with a club control, it would be a tricky time for North.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@D bit looks a bit odd here|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: aalthough i do not know the exact meaning|pg||
nt|athene: a bit of an overbid, but he was worried opps have a big spade fit (as they do)|pg||
nt|ady: 2 or 3 down|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe just trying to pre-empt to some extent|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i do not like in that position to preempt when i am so strong|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: The advantage of doing the tap-in commentary is that you have a split second to check whether your comment is completely stupid before you press enter.|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but then when you do say something stupid you look so bad :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Against that, some duff comment is preserved for posterity on the VuGraph web-sites. If you say something clueless, no-one records it and you can hope that the spectators thought ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: you were joking.  |pg||
nt|ady: no safety   3 hearts 1 spade and 1 club|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|boedhy:  still @h stop|pg||
nt|gracelin: pass|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by both teams :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on this board  after  1@C-P-1@H   Bobby Levin bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein raises to 4@H  Pachtmann 4@S|pg||
nt|pelu: prob down 2 - but 2@s making and also 3@S has a good chance|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rensph:  North might very well have bid 6NT after discovering @SA and the lack of a club stopper in partner's hand|pg||
nt|famus: he knows 11@s|pg||
nt|hlortz: but could be UNsafety play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: ruffing 3 diamonds in runs risk of 10@H making for defence   I think small slam is enough|pg||
nt|kit: some suggest West should have doubled 4@S -- but the 4@H call might have been a lot weaker since it is preemptive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a roller coaster ride that was|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: what about N to X 2@C?|pg||
nt|ady: not now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wd|pg||
nt|xenya: auction looks very confident -- well done|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 4@H is no @S A, K, Q or AKQ|pg||
nt|ady: can get out for 2 down  defence should take 4 spades 1 heart and 1 club|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: "He writes books about bridge, he can't possible be that stupid..."|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein handled the spade suit quite effectively|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suit pref for impossible suit  used to say  entry in trump|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: come on  I want my cup of tea|pg||
pc|hT|nt|barnets: on this hand the @DKQ fall in 3 rounds|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec needs only ruff 2 diamnds|pg||
nt|barnets: but that is fortunate|pg||
nt|ady: but grand slam not good enough |pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's right.|pg||
nt|barnets: and the practical odds is close but maybe not enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OR    just don't break the other suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   China now trailing Italy by only 9   [actually 8.7]|pg||
pc|h8|nt|twcho: a tie bd|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphznt: claiming |pg||
nt|gracelin: only 10 tricks and 11 imps to China|pg||

nt|fabsayc: smoker?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no I dont think so :)|pg||
nt|barnets: but north did not know that south was so minimum for his invite|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphznt: 3 sp for you Bocchi says|pg||
nt|barnets: and maybe should have bid it anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's not a situation where you need to bid an against-the-odds contract because you are behind. All the VPs from all the round-robin matches are added, so you must play with the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: odds throughout.|pg||
nt|ady: taking long enough in 6@H     |pg||
nt|barnets: the grandslam was bid at both tables in the poland sweden match|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: nmot that it was a very useful piece of information for E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Netherlands leads Iceland by 94    USA1 over Israel by 73|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|famus: I wud've preferred a Hi @C and come back to fin|pg||
nt|ady: problem for declarer last hand was no entry if heplayed  top clubs and queen did not fall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least  not on my account |pg||
nt|xenya: despite all those swings, the current score in this set is exactly even: 32-32 |pg||
pc|d6|nt|gulyas: good def here|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|barnets: open room are on their last board now|pg||
nt|ady: have been very slow at this table|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi must be thinking: 'Just as well I didn't bid the grand, if he is playing this slowly.'|pg||
nt|ady: thinking J9XX soades with east?|pg||
nt|ady: spades|pg||
nt|idc: Declarer was spared a @d guess by North's play of J, so hand will be over soon|pg||
nt|ady: dummy not squeezed as all the clubs can be discarded |pg||
pc|cK|nt|jfeld:  so another push. |pg||

pc|c4|nt|athene: south gets squeezed first :)|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: lauria thinking, did not pay much attention anymore :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|hJ|pg||

mb|2D|nt|santyclz2:  And onside too!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: as they were in bd. 9 ;)|pg||

nt|jfeld:  China losing to South Africa and has slipped down to 9th by a half VP!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and as you can see VERY CLOSE race|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you just look at NS hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks it would seem in hearts|pg||

nt|jkotor: z Kysiem Jacek gra³ 2@h = 54+ m³ode w sile inwitu i potem relay o dok³adny sk³ad|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Israeli pair has found the @S fit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: if it asks for short suits, that 3@c will encourage him|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3BA to idealny kontrakt w tym rozdaniu..4@H mo¿na przegraæ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically  1@D-1@H//2@H = 4-fit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: 5@D was a sensible option by North. Some would bid 5@C, claiming that they couldn't be any better for a passed hand. But South only made a simple overcall.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The VuGraph records are saved in various repositories (one is Nikos Sarantakos's VuGraph Project), so we can look up how other teams bid and made 7@H.|pg||
nt|ady: was worn out by then|pg||
nt|idc: But then if that is a return short suit try, South will be discouraged|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: E thinks|pg||
nt|garden2005: podzia³y s¹ @d 3-3 @c 3-2 ... szczyt marzeñ|pg||
nt|kamyk: a 3@C to pewnie 5-4 w m³odych i 9-11; niektórzy u¿ywaj¹ tu 2@H na tak¹ rêkê, ale to bardzo podstepne i wirogenne:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: ano racja Grzesiu, choæ piki dziel¹ siê nieszczególnie|pg||
nt|jfeld:  not a good time for either of those teams to get a time penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we have 50 minutes left of the match|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so no timepressure here|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Hurd elects not to compete|pg||
nt|pelu: @s-lead and @d10 back to defeat 4@h|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rensph:  Creative approach by W - had east shown a 5card major he'd be ok with that, too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this contract is touch and go, good guess in diamonds may see it home|pg||
nt|idc: ahha, am told 3@c is forced relay, then opener makes short suit try|pg||
nt|ady: may get too high|pg||
nt|famus: 6@s does come home --i think|pg||
nt|psyck:  other room has finished early, maybe Lall will login now to take a look at his teammates progress :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S asking W...|pg||
nt|ady: hand 26  a good swing for Chin   they are playing 2@CX   and made a game in this room|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: agree with all S passing?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 1@D-1@S//2@S can [rare] be 3-fit|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gracelin: They may end up in 2S with the Gazzilli.|pg||
nt|antoniz: dzielni ruszyL|pg||
nt|lechcold: kara mog³yby dzieliæ siê gorzej (drugi walet, drugi-czwarty król przed dam¹), wa¿ne by trefle by³y 3-2|pg||
nt|jkotor: E ma ekstremum w ramach 9-11 A, A, K i 10ka na podpórkê|pg||
nt|jkotor: lepsza karta to tylko 55 z tymi samymi honorami|pg||
nt|xenya: he might double now, with the idea of converting 2@H to 2@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: low scoring match and China leading so far.|pg||
nt|eggy:  I don't think that's particularly underbid it though|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 5 teams within 4.5 VPs|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: He could be a lot better as a passed hand.  Stiff in a major.  Queen of clubs someplace else.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|gracelin: All othe bids by south will show the strong hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is one disadvantage of the Gazzilli.|pg||
nt|gracelin: this time he has a very healthy 5-card suit.  North is worry south ma bid the same way with a much weak 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|kit: Martel knows declarer doesn't have A10x of hearts or first trick wouldn't have been ducked, so continuing hearts is safe.|pg||
nt|kit: And he had to lead low, since Stansby might have started with ace-doubleton.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not if you're this NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Ginossar tries 3N      Weinstein waits to see if that ends the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N it is  and quick @HK lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should mean USA1 plus in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no top losers here  but 6@S may prove difficult with 4-1 split   |pg||
nt|ritong: he briefly considered a @s J switch|pg||
nt|kit: no need for that, since if Stansby has king of spades the jack of spades shift can come later.|pg||
nt|jkotor: Gawry nie mo¿e wymyliæ A@s u partnera, a bez tej karty szlemik zawsze bêdzie s³aby|pg||
nt|ady: still got the diamond fit|pg||
nt|xenya: but preferred a cautious pass, being vulnerable|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: ?|pg||
nt|jkotor: seniorzy taryfa w plecy na Duñczyków, tylko panie dobrze w tej rundzie|pg||
nt|antoniz: to mo¿e wtedy od razu 2karo?|pg||
nt|ady: 2@CX may not make   but great against 620|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: my limited understanding of gazilli says that 2@c is either nat or 16-18, 2@d is 8+ any, and 2@s shows spades and clubs minimum|pg||
nt|gracelin: sout may pass 1NT with 12-13 pts in order not to be involved in the Gazzilli.  But with 14 he fears losing game if north has 10-11, even a passed hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south|pg||
nt|idc: Stansby declines the game-try but 4@c leaves North a different problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we should be back now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: there has been some technical problems in the open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N goes down a lot if Ginossar doesn't run @D before losing @S hook|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: oeffff|pg||
nt|ritong: thus he sticked on @hs|pg||
nt|antoniz: wtedy AK karo i K trefl,te¿ niele|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @s are nice and friendly. will probably lose 1@C and 2@D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: double dummy can make 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike standard -- Grue able to bid 3 times since 1@D opening was already limited to 15 HCP|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphznt: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this strange looking play is quite good|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: for running scores|pg||
nt|fabsayc: saving spade king for a late discard|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As long as the x isn't takeout.|pg||
nt|idc: His dbl looks sensible|pg||
nt|famus: ya-4-@s stops it and a top @C ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the reason is 3451 is the lesser evil|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: the reason why south bid 2@c instead of passing 1NT is that he might be facing an 11 point balanced hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: you are quite right.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think they can get out for less than 2hearts and eventually 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West showed 6-8 with red suits|pg||
nt|kamyk: W ma wprawdzie minimum, ale dobre honory - mo¿e móg³ jeszcze zanêciæ przez 4@S?|pg||
nt|pelu: also @DQ work|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: ty but then E 3@H not 4@H Gerbrand?|pg||
nt|jkotor: AK@d i K@c to potrzeba dzia³ki atutów i ¿eby pik sta³ jak kara gorzej ni¿ 33|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and we lost connection|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: that lead made it easier|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 10, instead 4@S Netherlands played 2@S and earned very important 9 imps.|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is quite annoying because S has to take @S finesse before cashing all diamond tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now defense can't go wrong   @SK doesn't offer useful discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're right Vlad -- entries to hand are gone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even in standard i like the grue sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3415 yes   not sure about 3451  that hand maybe rebids 2@D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rensph:  N missed a chance to give partner 2 ruffs there, now it looks like 3@D is making|pg||
nt|hedyg:  surely a direct 3@d over 2@H would have been gf and this was a slight invite|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: SHI a bit SHY:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I have entered the results from this room now|pg||
nt|xenya: on a heart lead, yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done to cash out|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: second push in a row on 11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forget that  3415 = 2@D opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Martin is right|pg||
nt|pelu: so from -500 to +100|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fluffy: but normally 2@s is with 4 clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW play a very natural system and use standard sugnals|pg||
nt|gracelin: signals|pg||
nt|xenya: no longer, Rashed -- The Netherlands gained 9 imps on 10 when they stopped in 2@S and made 10|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kareno: I use two-way stayman and with game values, I do always check.  That my hand is balanced (4333) doesn't mean partner's is also the same, particularly with the modern tendency to ...|pg||
nt|kareno: open a lot of 5/4 hands 1nt.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but not straightfoward|pg||
nt|oosmanb: could perhaps insure contract by giving an open @S since he's missing entries to hand|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: So the auction, say, 1nt - 2@d (gfs) - 2@s - 3@s offers a choice of contract.|pg||
nt|rensph:  declarer will have to choose between finessing in clubs or spades|pg||
nt|idc: I think I like the logic behind SOuth's lead: partner has short hearts so where are E-W tricks coming from except ruffs, so lead a trump|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|xenya: somewhat ironically|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this is close|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, one or two good decisions required|pg||
nt|boedhy:  needs to play @d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and as Muller is playing it will take some time|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then he will play @d offcourse|pg||
nt|rhelle:  indeed- if only to get information how to play @ss|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has nervous moments -- feels a lot better with king of hearts onside|pg||
nt|gracelin: after the HK lead, the H10 is irrevelent|pg||
nt|antoniz: chyba jednak 55|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and the same will be done in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so on track in a second -- I HOPE !!|pg||
nt|fluffy: :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: finally things seem to work|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: nice invention/convention:)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|rensph:  ...unless defense solves this problem for him|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|gracelin: the D shift deceived declarer, playing D strength with E|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or, as Papi says:  "You need a reason *not* to lead trumps".|pg||
nt|idc: At the vulnerability East wanted to suggest a 5@c sac to his partner, hence the 4@c bid|pg||
nt|idc: If any blame is to be awarded, West's dbl perhaps deserves it (though -300 instead of -140 no disaster)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: that's possibly the first time in my life I've predicted Duboin's line of play|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|pelu: thats a mistake by S - sh take @DA and play 3x@s|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1 imp if he makes 4|pg||
nt|ady: playing safe for 10    still 11|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: Now will strip out hearts and clubs, and then try to duck a spade to West|pg||
nt|antoniz: zagrali poprawne 5tr|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: By eliminating the side suits, he can survive when East holds @SQ-x.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Sementa decided his hand was worth game in @H, covered the black losers, nice @H fit and Kx in @d look pretty good|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gracelin: instead of taking 2 D tricks, Madala takes none by this defense.  He is not headed for -2|pg||
nt|idc: USA avoided the slam on failing finesse on Bd 8, so their lead up to 21 IMPs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good use of trump entry|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1:  25 where Lall made 4@HX    Upmark went down in 4@H|pg||

nt|athene: after 1@S - 1NT, how many clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: i bet he bids just two|pg||
nt|famus: in 6 i think he might well lead a @S|pg||
nt|psyck:  since 4@c often has other meanings, many would open 5@c here|pg||
nt|xenya: so Ginnosar in the other room decided not to take the @S hook, quietly going 1 off|pg||
mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|rhelle:  2@c = 11-15, 6+@c|pg||
nt|xenya: Ginossar rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS do play 1@S - 2@D as hears|pg||
nt|rensph:  other table reached 3N and made it, so 7 imps to South Africa|pg||
nt|hlortz: that will beat it --i think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not stopping under 4@S now I think|pg||
nt|jfeld:  important to discuss your follow ups after your side makes a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|jfeld:  a simple agreement is that if the opponents run, the first double is takeout and subsequent doubles are penalty|pg||
nt|eggy:  Einarsson (holding my average rubber bridge hand) no doubt hoping that East doesn't get carried away with a good hand|pg||
nt|jfeld:  and that you are in a force through 2@D or 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Sweden vs. New Zeeland has played 8 boards so far|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they have 45 minutes left to play the last 8 boards|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Einarsson here, hoping to escape|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it is Wooldridge thinking here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|boedhy:  south will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = relay|pg||
nt|athene: hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Two - no need to preempt with a solid opening bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: China has another chance here, 6S is cold|pg||
nt|fluffy: not your everyday vulnerable preempt|pg||
nt|fluffy: 6@s is far from cold requiers a good guess i ntrumps or in the minors|pg||
nt|gracelin: in Italy they say Vulnerability is for children and Bocchi is no children.|pg||
nt|fluffy: normally you should gues trumps, but you are not entry rich to dummy|pg||
nt|psyck:  they did have 4@c available after all|pg||
nt|psyck:  cc says " Wide ranging preempt"|pg||
nt|psyck:  I would expect W to pass|pg||
nt|psyck:  with @s's & @d's breaking, 4@s could make here|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks far too easy to predict 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: this looks a part score hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: no offense meant sorry SHI|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ lead    @D to Ace    @C finessed|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but they won't use the bid with this hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  W bids 4@d before n can.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 1's to Aus with a flat inbetween each|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   have around 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|famus: probly xfer to NT|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks like the stopping place for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks  unless A@D les against spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2NT = balanced|pg||
nt|kit: This is as flat a 4@H hand as you will find, it sppears.|pg||
nt|hlortz: and denies 4@S since o neg dbl perhaps|pg||
nt|eggy:  North will think there is a source of tricks now|pg||
nt|eggy:  or not!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very strange choice of lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a)  not leading major   b) leading from Jxxx  UGH|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it is really @d4..|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I once made a weak jump on 7 to AK in diamonds, quite proud of it until my '@h'Q turned out to be a missorted diamond|pg||
nt|idc: a weak jump on AKQxxxxx was consider over-sound by my peers|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  q10xxx in the midnight swiss...|pg||
nt|hlortz: /no/|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@d is precision style so can be few cards|pg||
nt|fluffy: to a minimum of 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul  1N=15-17|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fluffy: aat least with the club opening he will guess clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Shi didnt dare to cue 4@d|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess Lian will move on|pg||
nt|pelu: but Lian still looking for slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he had taken a bid but took it back|pg||
nt|idc: and 'weak-jump' became my nickname for a while (till I did something even worse)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 6@d = 500|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this doesnt look right|pg||
nt|ady: cant get there now|pg||
nt|ady: may make 3@D |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W better bid @d|pg||
nt|fluffy: Cullin should normally bid 1NT 11-13 with this hand, probably he did and its wooldridge who i thinking about entering the bidding with 2@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not vul =14-16|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rhelle:  (no singleton or void)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  so Einarsson chose his "best" suit|pg||
nt|jfeld:  this could work out quite poorly|pg||
nt|eggy:  It could indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this is not for people with weak hearts |pg||
pc|sK|nt|rensph:  6@S makes on the rather fortunate heart position here, but they'll likely end up in 4@S|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|boedhy:  2227 balanced tehese days :)|pg||
nt|athene: wow, only 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: i would want to bid a few more than that after partner doubles clubs for takeout|pg||
nt|idc: That's a good auction|pg||
nt|idc: Particularly by North, appreciating power of his shape after partner's negative dbl|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now what?  6 of a major looks likely  on the bidding (if not the hands).|pg||
nt|ady: south will have to find 3 discards on the clubs|pg||
nt|ady: best to take the 1st heart   but a difficult play|pg||
nt|famus: can see only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: oh my -- big chance for USA1 here|pg||
nt|kit: The North hand sure doesn't look like notrump to me.|pg||
nt|ritong: passing 3NT is a surprise, yes|pg||
nt|eggy:  Hurd knows spades are better|pg||
nt|eggy:  so takes the money (he hopes)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW vary their range   1/2/3nv = 14-16   3vul/4 = 15-17|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: this should be down, even down two is possible|pg||
nt|kit: however, important for Martel not to squander 10 of hearts at trick 1!|pg||
nt|psyck:  gr8 guess by Joel, I have to admid i would not have found the 5@c bid|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: missed a pass Karen|pg||
nt|kit: and ace asks for count or unblock I believe.  |pg||
nt|lechcold: muszê siê oddaliæ, i chyba dobrze bo moje kibicowanie szczêcia naszym nie przynosi...do zobaczenia jutro|pg||
nt|ady: and still 11|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|boedhy:  well maybe south should go for 3nt then ?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|boedhy:  sort of wrongsided it now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could it be slam looking form south...|pg||
nt|kareno: I also play that double as takeout.  And they have a light opening style with the forcing club system.|pg||
nt|rensph:  wouldn't want to get anywhere near 6@S usually|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best now is spade shift|pg||
nt|kit: he got it right!|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C - 2@D - 2@H lloks like invit with 5-4 in major|pg||
nt|fabsayc: chasing the vulnerable game that does not exist|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2 MAJOR ACES TO LOSE -NEXT|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT opening with a singleton a bit more fashionable these days   I prefer not|pg||
nt|jfeld:  the only problem with passing is partner might be there to the rescue...|pg||
nt|jfeld:  but obviously that is unexpected|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W laughs when he saw the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and so did Hurd and Wooldridge|pg||
pc|hT|nt|santyclz: USA 1 took a big lead when China went down in 4@S rather than the 3nt on bd 25.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You remember the deal where Levin upgraded a 17-count to 18, reaching 3NT opposite 7? China played that deal in 4@S, on a 5-3 fit and went one down. So, Kit's advice on the deal, ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that West should not seek a 5-3 spade fit proved to be good advice.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if they are there, I am quite sure Shi will take 12 tricks.  He is the best player in the team and reach semi final in BB in 2009.|pg||
nt|idc: Stansby's dbl started as minimum but I guess even his hand feels a little improved on auction|pg||
nt|idc: the 6@d bid should warn declarer of bad breaks ahead|pg||
nt|idc: I admit I might be tempted to do less as South - perhaps dbl is a little pesimistic but a forcing pass of 6@d maybe best|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: how to play now? not over yet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  now is there some way to endplay w with the @h loser and force a @s lead?  I don't see one,  but that doesn't mean one doesn't exist.|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, I suspect this won't make - need a 12th trick from another @d ruff or a spade|pg||
nt|idc: and this attack on dummy's trumps probably too hard to handle|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Martel reading a book|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "Starbound " that is|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@C+1 likely|pg||
nt|eggy:  Not sure once you have decided to bid 3C that you should then bid again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good duck from Barel  holds declarer to 2@D tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: must be, but very strange, yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 aces  great intermediates  = 15 :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fluffy: if declarer missguesses trumps he will need to find @dQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: or squeeze south in the reds|pg||
nt|gracelin: not a difficult task|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S = 2Aces + @SQ - Lian exp @sAKQ :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: he even has time to establish a long Heart|pg||
nt|famus: natural for him to play !j--but if he opts to play a small @s--the play ends at trick 2|pg||
nt|famus: @sj|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the vugraph schedule so you can plan your days and weeks      http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|pelu: he know that N is short in @S, so he could play @S6|pg||
nt|famus: that wud end the thrill!!:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has so many entry to dummy, so I thk to take CA and play small spade to finesse S10 is the right play|pg||
nt|fluffy: Imaine for example playing a low spade and south ducking @sK9xx he might lock you in dummy with a heart and you have no way back to hand except destoying you chances of stablishing ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: @cQ|pg||
nt|pelu: this will be the 3. slam-swing in the match - the first 2 gave China 25 IMP and prob 12 more here|pg||
nt|gracelin: China should be proud of themself in outbidding the Italians in 3 slams in one set.  If Shi makes this.|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby will probably shift to club, although anything but king of hearts works fine now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: It is in fact Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: many play 1x - 1y - 1NT now 2@D = GF, 2!x realy to 2@d and direct major weak|pg||
nt|roswolf: if it is now working!!|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: good safe 3@C|pg||
nt|ady: on hand 25 China mad 2@CX for a +180  and 13 imps to China|pg||
nt|ady: not sure how west found this fit   couold not east have been 5-3-3-2|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: interesting bidding and wp by SHI b25|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: sorry b26|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: but one of the slam only maded on a defensiv error|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes sorry:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this time he finds the 5 card major|pg||
nt|fluffy: wow that's a strong view from a passed hand!|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: various ways to come to nine tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: take a ruffing finesse in spades is one|pg||
nt|ritong: despite the superfavorable @s layout|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 11, China played at 6@S making 7 and lost 11 imps.|pg||
mc|9|nt|boedhy:  offcourse it was 50% but south has a very strong hand imo|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi must be thinking harder than we do except he is not looking at all 4 hands.  I am sure the line he chooses is the best one.|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the page for the result fromthe 3 events     http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|famus: so the Chinese wud b the first to put a dent in this Italian Juggernaut--They've rolled over evry other opponent mercilessly, and i dare say artfully till now|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: actually this was the bidding :)|pg||
nt|idc: Auction entered is 4 passes and I doubt that really happened, just a typing glitch i expect|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re los kabeltje:)|pg||
nt|famus: had he taken the first @H --had a possibilty in !endplaying S|pg||
nt|ady: was a difficult hand to make  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: he would have done better to lead low spade on third round|pg||
nt|ady: but survived|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: last board was 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China LEADS Italy by 12.3|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|athene: south doubles 1@S and then north bids 1nt, i suppose|pg||

nt|fluffy: the only line that had chances of making as chudecek suggested is to run @sQ and pray for @sKJx onside, with @s7xx begind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 1 suit,  @H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  so far NS have 12 plus scores - they will be happy|pg||
nt|gracelin: at this Vul. 2D shows 4S and 5+ minor with 5-11 pts|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2c was 18-19 , madala passed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, 2@C shows 18-19 balanced for them. The other Italian pairs use 2@D for that.|pg||
nt|pelu: me me thats absolut minimum for a Michaels 2@c -|pg||
nt|hlortz: true. it was a difficult hand to play. i expected trump leads w/qj09|pg||
nt|ritong: here lall/grue had a shooting auction, "helped" by a 2@h opening in east|pg||
mb|2S!|an|p/c|nt|ady: Sementa losts of clubs and spades again|pg||
nt|hedyg:  1@c= 2+|pg||
nt|pelu: but @H 10 9 make the hand better|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: safer|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Yes, Bd 11 still being played in other room, in 3NT by East (USA)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: that was 4117 almost same|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Raptor is only played in direct seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: East is unbalanced now he dbled|pg||
nt|ady: this time they do have a spade fit   but still might play more safely in clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see what happens with a quieter start|pg||
nt|psyck:  3@h fit jump|pg||
nt|ritong: hurd certainly would prefer chunkier suits|pg||
nt|ritong: but..|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H on heart queen being right|pg||
nt|ady: hand 27   China in 5@C X   need to play carefully to down 2   -300|pg||
nt|fluffy: when you go 3 down in a vulnerable slam and win 12 oh hell yo ufeel much better after checking scores!|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: quel systeme !|pg||
nt|ritong: his action has the merit to place his hand immediately|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, should be better @h suit normally...|pg||
nt|ritong: he will not participate further if unsollicited|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play in game|pg||
nt|oosmanb: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this upgrade may get them to the good slam, 2@S followed by 4@C splinter|pg||
nt|twcho: I still can't understand why declarer take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: Meanwhile: New Zealand doing well against USA1 (23-7VP), Sweden-USA2 almost even, Singapore vs Australia -- same  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S a playable level.|pg||
nt|ady: hand 27 looks around 5 imps to Australia|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: some might be tempted to double this with north but he does not have that great a hand|pg||
nt|athene: you either need a shortage so you can get some ruffs|pg||
nt|pelu: just a X to help opponents :) - he has shown @h+@s why D - extra values?? NO|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we have 12 minutes left -- and still 2 boards left after this one|pg||
nt|fluffy: ok it seems 2@d shows a multi 1 major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue DBL would be takeout|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 2@S is invite for hearts or signoff for spades|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|boedhy:  yes they will be pretty confident about there list|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only board 9 is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  It was bid and made at most tables|pg||
nt|athene: or you need such good trumps you just make them by force|pg||
nt|kareno: Nanev very close to a second double.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: I didn't know you were bi-lingual.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Because he was tricked by a 19 year old?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  after the accident on board 4 he is hesitant to bid 2@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C no chance|pg||
nt|ady: now Sementa has said it all|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Thundering here, South; I made a wrong bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: ciê¿ki rebid z rêk¹ E...|pg||
nt|antoniz: ³adna odzywka Piotra|pg||
nt|ritong: so we land in the 8 cards fit, relatively low level |pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry, 4@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: chances for -3 there in 5@C?|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@d is tell me your major|pg||
nt|fluffy: and 2NT can be whatever|pg||
pc|c4|nt|boedhy:  solid 3nt again|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention that 2@C on a passed hand should show a sound raise in partner's major was banned for years by the English Bridge Union.  They thought it allowed players to psyche ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in 3rd seat....|pg||
nt|kit: some might open the West hand 1NT and get to 3NT.  But they then might get a spade lead!|pg||
nt|athene: he really has not got that much defence|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case, north might sit.|pg||
nt|andyv:  for those who want to see the open room on livestream: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|ritong: looks healthy|pg||
nt|psyck:  this should also go down for a more or less push board|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kit: This lead will not test declarer.  A heart lead might have.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is known as the Drury convention.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And when 2@C shows 3 card support and 2@d is used for 4 card support it's 2-way Drury.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has the chance to ditch a diamond on the 4th club, so long as the defenders do not set up a diamond early.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Taking a trump finesse might allow a damaging diamond switch.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is no doubt what he is thinking about.|pg||
nt|idc: The 3@d showed 18-19 balanced & heart suport|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 9 tricks either spades or clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg:  in 4@s you would have to ruff high and play the J@S to create an entry to dummy with the 10@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|ady: this looks tough to make|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they did well to stop there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some don't use that treatment Martin -- either @S or to play in a minor|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rensph:  only worry of declarer here is to avoid losing 2 spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: with the knowledge of south's 4-cad spade, declarer can take deep finesse there to get 4S, 1H, 2C and 2D.|pg||
nt|ady: Duboin in with his jack   but partner had shown a good hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i am afraid that even is not enough hedy|pg||
nt|roswolf: my link does work if you get NO SEVICE press F5 on your computer:)|pg||
nt|fluffy: but regardless of what it was Hurd is going to compete|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2nt shows 6+@d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lechcold: na drugim stole pad³o 2@H i jest grane|pg||
nt|ritong: yes trumps are cruel|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: awful board to defend this 1@S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphznt: 5@h= 2 aces no @sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i see it is 14-16, so not an upgrade, and to me worth 4@D over 4@C since diamonds good for many discards|pg||
nt|hedyg:  extremely disciplined pass|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: instead of dbl direct 2@S is 6-4/5 less strong|pg||
nt|xenya: not an easy hand|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein worried about a club ruff, so may play two top spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 37 IMP for China on 3 slams !|pg||
nt|gracelin: as there are only 2 entries to dummy, he could cash SA first to see what's north singleton, when the S7 shown, he know to double hook S10 and SQ|pg||
nt|fokal: he can evan afford to cash the @s As|pg||
nt|famus: this shud b a swing back to Italy if @s dont go to deep fin|pg||
nt|fokal: *even|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  E-w appear to have 4 losers and stopped just in time.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  on the other hand he also knows that with double fit Duboin is big enough to bid 4@s if it is there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: claim|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i think he will just claim|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: a bit late with time|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes keep refreshing the website, it'll work |pg||
pc|s4|nt|fluffy: in 4@s, 4 players made, 10 players went down|pg||
nt|fluffy: making 3NT is for sure a supperb score|pg||
nt|gracelin: the Italian declarer must be among the 4 that make|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer lacks the entries for finesse south for Q107x, so he must hope north hold one of the Q, 10, or 7.  So cas SA and take the double hook|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer can fleely cash @sA now right?|pg||
nt|famus: has to beware of entries to play @s twice- but also needs to check the hand---Declarer has his work cut out for him|pg||
nt|lechcold: po kierowym ataku konieczny by³by impas i damy i ósemki pik|pg||

pc|sT|nt|ady: looks 1 down|pg||
nt|ady: clubs being 4-1|pg||
nt|xenya: but now EW can score a @D ruff|pg||
nt|ady: ruffed with long trumps|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: we had trump AKQJ and 22 hcp and could not beat 1@S:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i pass 2@D to play in that minor :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brolucius: If he plays trumps from the top and they break 3-2, he can set up the clubs, leeaving the master @SQ out. |pg||
nt|andyv:  and for current standings: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||

nt|hlortz: looks like 11|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ady: 2 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|bobh1: otherwise he might fear duplication|pg||
nt|ady: hand 27 was down 2 in 5@C X  5 back to Australia|pg||
nt|fluffy: what is wooldridge-hurd's NT rang?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ginossar rebid 3@C   i like Kamil's choice more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: potential protection of @SQ  and doesn't overstate strength of hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i should have waited   now told  China 67-3 for the set  leads Italy by 27|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brolucius: You can see how hopeless it would have been for North to 'cover an honour with an honour'. |pg||
nt|santyclz: The bad news is the trump break.  The good news is that s didn't request a @d through.|pg||
nt|kamyk: pechowe rozdanie - N mia³ prawo liczyc na dubla karo u partnera|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this might be a fast board|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I think I can remember from previous boards|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobh1: i guess he knew|pg||
nt|xenya: so declarer would have done better to play trumps at once|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: Diamond needed|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate sing. club is the 10|pg||
nt|bobh1: both slams depend on the @H Q and 32 @Hs|pg||
nt|ady: this could be a swing for Poland|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i even do not see DD how to beat 1@S|pg||
nt|fluffy: nice this explains why Hurd was not very optimistic on the bidding|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bobh1: perhaps they were influenced by the need to do something|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gracelin: yes, nicely done, now two entries to dummy for the double finesse.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: was not clear though|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it was australia playing the 5@c, so 5 imps to china|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: Now diamond shift and he is down.|pg||
nt|kit: Problem was he couldn't go up ace of hearts due to no entry to the club.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South may hope that North started with @CKQJ.|pg||
nt|bobh1: to get back in the match|pg||
nt|ady: well 13 imps wasted|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bidding 6@C didnt seem to be in the picture for a long time during the auction|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: If North had that in clubs, North would have cashed another club at least|pg||
nt|antoniz: dlatego wist karo jest niedobry,moim zdaniem|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: Yes, that's a good inference - one that South has missed.|pg||

nt|ady: 12 tricks available here for e/w   can they do it again|pg||

nt|ady: maybe 6@H    as can ruff out spade suit when 4-2|pg||
nt|oosmanb: haha for those watching Open room webcast|pg||
nt|roswolf: this slam is of rolanf proportions!:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Versace was toying with his final pass card over 4@H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|twcho: redouble is a better bid than a mere 2@h bid in OR|pg||
nt|psyck:  I would have expected a 1N opening by N here|pg||
nt|ritong: holding south hand, you know that this rates to be painful|pg||
nt|ritong: a strong NT, you mean?|pg||

nt|ady: sorry   did not see 1@S opening |pg||
nt|ady: not light double   sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are no books that tell you what to bid with East hand after partner shows @S and unknown minor|pg||

nt|ady: but a slam here may be flat|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: think SHI passes though|pg||
nt|xenya: good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: @H-lead against 4@S, then @D to K, @S to A @hQ to K and ruff, @CA and @C .. to K @hJ disc @C-loser, and so on = 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: heee  24-44 China (lucky or deserved:)?|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 3H, so 2S -1 or -2 is no big deal|pg||
nt|idc: Looking at the E-W heart intermediates on last hand, you might just hope for 2-2 trump split rather than a partial cross-ruff|pg||
nt|famus: he needs to ruff a @D for a push board i think|pg||
nt|ady: absolutely|pg||
nt|xenya: despite the grand slam swing we still have the lowest score as compared to the other matches|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ady: 2NT   strong break of transfer|pg||
nt|kit: operator -- this is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry|pg||
nt|kit: Normal 4@H contract -- should make along crossruff lines, taking at least 6 hearts, 2 spades, 1 diamond, and 1 club.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i know, kidding|pg||
nt|psyck:  I'm told 15-17 3rd, no mention of it in cc though|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think stefanov would miss an occasion to open 1NT if system allows it|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, same contract same lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: unexpected lead|pg||
nt|ady: good spot for n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C maybe alerted because there are hands that would bid Puppet Stayman instead of 2@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1NT is mostly a matter of system than points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running scores  http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl   remember to refresh screen|pg||
pc|s3|nt|twcho: sure, not your fault. :)|pg||
nt|eggy:  Also as NZ are playing Sweden (1.5 behind) there shouldn't be a problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when you PASS  partner has @C   when you DBL pard has @D    example of Great Shuffler's sense of humor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction screams     lead trump THEN look at your hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fluffy: the lead guesses diamonds for declarer, and now defeating 2@s will require a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|twcho: wow, they bid it|pg||
nt|kit: Most natural play is to lead diamond to king at trick 2, and another diamond.|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3NT is non serious or serious 3NT|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well stopped|pg||
nt|kareno: Clubs behave but not much else.  Good lead - actually Bridge World has an article this month about the benefits of major suit leads against notrumps - and their general success.|pg||
nt|athene: versace wondering whether to start clubs with small towards the ten i suppose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great|pg||
nt|twcho: no matter what the double means, it must show some useful value. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they will realize after finished|pg||
nt|ritong: a top @s, that is|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6N?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6NT|pg||
nt|ady: not straight foward though  if spades 4-2|pg||
nt|ady: even in hearts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: then @C finesse?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@H 3@S 2@C 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT either on spades 3-3   or club finesse |pg||
pc|d8|nt|brolucius: This is the last board of the session. I would like to thank Dirk, our splendid VG operator. Excellent session and many thanks!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: drive out @D ace before tackling @S |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3nt was non-serious|pg||
pc|d3|nt|boedhy:  4nt quantitative|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, unless you're in 6NT and you get the wrong lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  could be 12 tricks played from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the spectators all know how to make six, declarer does not|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: another down 1 EW joke|pg||
nt|hedyg:  very lucky lie of cards|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Sementa: this the match for 3@H and 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: proble though idf A@D is with south and club comes back   ?|pg||
nt|ady: problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: BBO|pg||
nt|jfeld:  That switch won't work out well, as North no longer has an entry to give the ruff|pg||
nt|jfeld:  most likely this will make now|pg||
nt|fluffy: whatever it was they stay at a safe level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin in 3@H East|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: if he carries on with this line he is going down|pg||

nt|kit: this really feels wrong to me.|pg||
nt|psyck:  @sQ from KQ or QJx|pg||
nt|ritong: varying from K to Q according to agreements|pg||

nt|rnmalik: can lose also @D switch.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table just finished 26  |pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm told Italy-China WILL be on vugraph next set    no surprise there :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rensph:  3@C puppet stayman here, little to the play in 4@S> Declarer will draw trumps and then requires the @HK to be onside|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kiwibridge: 1 @C ruff and the 1DA onside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his partner didn't open|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt he bid 3@H over 1N by N|pg||
nt|xenya: or maybe just 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: conventional 2N   then corrected 3@D to 3@H|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Chance was there to make 8 tricks but did not accept.|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N, i'm told |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rensph:  he might be able to play for a throw-in|pg||
nt|kamyk: w sierpniu 80 Rosiewicz piewa³: "Bulgarija,Bulgarija, u Polijaka awarija"|pg||
nt|brolucius: One down will be fine, against a making 2@H. Madala was unlucky to find only two trumps in the dummy. His bid was fine.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction a variation on mexican 2@D, west showed 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: of course the legitimate plan was to rely on 3-3 @S -- the line adopted by declarer works if the defence err twice -- not sure how good that is  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: another chance.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: Also, many thanks to Kit and Joe, my fellow commentators. We were awarded a fair bunch of boards - neither excellent, nor hopelessly boring - somewhere in between.|pg||

nt|hlortz: and @c 3-3|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rensph:  should the throw-in fail (If S holds the 3rd spade) he can still finesse the hearts himself|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|kareno: This is a hand I would rather leave to partner to declare always - too many choices.  I agree that a club to the ten is tempting.  The diamonds have opened a path for the defense.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaapfr vg: ok 9 tr and last board|pg||
nt|ady: not much scope for Austrialia on hands 29 to 31    so this looks a convincing win for China|pg||

nt|rv: ty Vincent for quietly doing an efficient job|pg||
nt|andyv:  they can nick 2@d one trick...but dbl has to be something else|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  if support, a bit unusual to play them over overcalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good spot to play Support DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that does fit Upmark's hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  this will play well|pg||
nt|rv: as commentators, our unanimous view is that all Vugraph operators in Veldhoven have been excellent all through last couple of weeks|pg||

pc|d3|pc|c5|nt|ritong: +1 goes for venky's remark:)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: was extremely fast|pg||
nt|jkotor: a jeszcze dodam (nie chc¹ mimo wszystko wyjæ na nadwornego krytyka naszych)|pg||

nt|ady: thx Natalia    thx specs|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer changes plan (somewhat incosistently perhaps), making contract |pg||
nt|rialc2: ciao a tutti|pg||
mb|1H|nt|boedhy:  throwing imps like candy..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board, we start again at 13.45|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: that is in 1 hour|pg||
nt|rhelle:  this is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes do you know there agreements|pg||
nt|rhelle:  they play dstructive preempts this vul(doesn't everybody?)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  what is the range|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but the temptation to bid 6@c must be strong|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt overcall perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: would be interesting to see how lauria-versace handle such interference|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like a normal 4H hand on this last deal of the set.|pg||
nt|barnets: east overcalled one heart in open|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has preferred a double to 1@H (the modern choice) and may escape a penalty.|pg||
nt|ady: great result for USA here in OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course they opened 1@D at the other table.|pg||
nt|ady: thx Gerbrand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Gerbarand you were great as always|pg||
nt|hedyg:  our thanks to our outstanding operator in Eindhoven, Gerbrand Hop, well done! to my excellent fellow commentators David , Daniel , Gonzalo and Jaap as well as CK, William and Ralf on voice for donating their time to guide us through these boards|pg||
nt|jkotor: ¿e tylko jedna para z tej reprezentacji gra³a ostatnio wszystko razem i gra w lidze razem|pg||
nt|eggy:  I can't see too much potential for a disaster either way here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@D, unbal|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  getting to 6@d now is too hard, I think|pg||
nt|rensph:  Even if spades break 4-1 taking the ace and returning a spade works equally well|pg||
nt|antoniz: bardzo trudny po otwarcie przeciwnika|pg||
nt|fabsayc: about the time they finish in open room :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  That is extremely fast for 1N|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the senior bowl Poland moved to the win from behind on bd 32, making x'd games in both rooms.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: here even not enough though:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kareno: So many thanks to Bob Drijver our excellent Operator.  To the specs for their wit and wisdom.  To Bill Frisby for his contributions and, of course, to WBF for allowing us to watch ...|pg||
nt|kareno: their marvelous production of the world championships.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Opened room started 10 minutes later than this room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are bidding 15 there|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: because the match is on VuGraph|pg||
nt|ady: slam to finish|pg||
nt|gulyas: ty all, it was an exciting match here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: bocchi pointing out 3H makes|pg||
nt|idc: Last board at this table (the Open room have 4 more though) so time for thanks:|pg||
nt|santyclz: True, only 16 imps....|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: Dennis tx for perfect job as usual and congrats to China|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  4@d may be an artificial slam try in @c|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will bid 5@c now expecting @h points|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally, this double shows a desire to penalize opps, but my guess is EW just use it to show some values|pg||
nt|barnets: I prefer the unfortunate 1@H bid|pg||
nt|twcho: last board for this round|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a memorable victory for Australia|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: We will be back at 13.45 local time|pg||
nt|petergill: West is thinking about whether to convert to 4@H|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Peter, a good win for your country|pg||
nt|petergill: If W does bid 4@H, then @SA lead works well, but might not be South's choice after this auction. The 3@S raise at the other table worked well, by guiding S to @SA lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  David Bird would be pleased with that speed though|pg||
nt|ritong: talking about this slam:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: defence helped too:)|pg||
nt|ady: looks like n/s can make 5@C      |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: you're welcome :) thanks all for the commentating|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: ths Denis|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: tx David and kibs last session at 16.45|pg||
nt|ady: thx specks|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and then Icelands faith has been put into other hands|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Having a stiff spade and a good suit, bidding 2@H is clear and not close in my opinion|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I cant figure out if Iceland is safe in Top8 -- but I think not, yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1@D will be a transfer bid.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  as well as to the World Bridge Federation and to the World Bridge Federation with the Nederlandse Bridge Bond for sharing this important event  with us,especially to Jacob Hop who is instrumental in organising the broadcasts on behalf of BBO!|pg||

pc|dA|nt|brolucius: The next session starts in around 1 hours and 10 minutes. It will be the last session of the day.|pg||
nt|kit: This time it is right to play the 5-3 major-suit fit|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even promising spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board for the day, back tomorrow at 10.30 Paris time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: here at the playing site in Veldhoven|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our excellent operator Jan Nielsen|pg||
nt|idc: to my fellow commentator Joe and to our Operator Paul|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie p³aczmy na zapas,do strefy awansu niedaleko, jutro jest nowy dzieñ|pg||
nt|garden2005: nast¹pi przebudzenie|pg||
nt|ady: another game for n/s|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|ritong: but north has a lot|pg||
nt|ritong: brutal bids of that sort must be precise|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes N will get to slam opp a positive response|pg||
nt|ritong: my guess would be 5332 9/10|pg||
nt|psyck:  1@c is 17+, so 8-9HCP 5332 for the 3N maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: anyway stefanov will drive on|pg||
nt|ritong: he is considering which way|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and return whilst last round RR is full of tension|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 16-board sessions tomorrow to finish the Quarter Finals|pg||
pc|d5|nt|boedhy:  still liking his hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: despite this loss of Italy they still do lead the Round Robin pack after round 5|pg||
nt|idc: to the WBF for allowing us to broadcast this event|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Martel doesn't particularly mind a @s contract by e-w.|pg||
nt|idc: and as always to Roland and BBO, without whose work none of this amazing stuff would happen|pg||
nt|hedyg:  special thanks to our specs for joining and the kind and helpful messages. we hope you enjoyed the show.|pg||
nt|ady: may take some bidding   4th heart and the jack  the key|pg||
nt|hlortz: thx David, Hasan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last board, thanks to our operator Felipe and to my co-commentators Peter and Henry|pg||
nt|ritong: sober|pg||
nt|ady: bad splits in the majors may beat any major suit game    but  5 clubs looks a make getting diamon d position right|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: tension here already. The Dutch all follow their ladies team|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: anyone any idea of ages N and S?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: currently 8th, but France in 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Ultima board del segmento|pg||
nt|fluffy: grue-lall got a very good result here|pg||
nt|fluffy: after EW found their 4-4 spade fit Grue on north doubled knowing his partner had 4@s and he had a big hand after opener|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rensph:  in this layout it all mattered very little, had north held the @HK it would've been a very effective @SQ|pg||
nt|famus: i rate them favourite to win|pg||
nt|gracelin: some care is needed here.  But I am confident Shi will also bring this home.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: LIAN already left the table|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a well educated quess Famus±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: the next match will start in 40 minutes from now.  Tks all for watching and hope you have enjoyed some great hands.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will also like to thank Felipe, our most capable operator who explained many bidding sequences to us.|pg||
nt|pelu: a way to play is @cA - @H to Q, @hA and then 4x@D discard @s, then @C AND MAKING 11|pg||
nt|jaapfr: looks tough for E )DD very easy'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but he is afraid for @H loss @C@C and @SA for down 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer want to cash HA first as a safety play(he could afford t lose one trump), but here the threat for club overruff made that play not totally safe.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and very afraid for ducking this IF S 6 card @C|pg||
nt|famus: playing @hA is sure wau to -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7 card|pg||
nt|famus: 6 cards he has so needs to duck|pg||
nt|gracelin: with a 7-card club suit at this Vul. south may have bid more.  so duck the first club then take trump finesse maybe a good way.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hope he does not go for the line @CA @HA x@S|pg||
nt|lechcold: dojd¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: chyba...|pg||
nt|jkotor: OBY!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fate -- not faith off course :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to the spectators for some alert analysis|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and to the commentator for an excellent job |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do you think 3@d is forcing or not here?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W seems to be in doubt|pg||
pc|dK|nt|boedhy:  now pass finally|pg||
nt|rhelle:  good sequence - 5@c is again 50% at best|pg||
nt|boedhy:  slam again 50% or so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well the 6 card trump support is hardly clear|pg||
nt|antoniz: mnie jest po prostu smutno,ale wierzê w przebudzenie naszych reprezentantów:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: * nie chc¹c|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie by³y to ³atwe rozdania|pg||
nt|psyck:  whichever strain he chooses will work as cards lay|pg||
nt|psyck:  6@c the normal choice to protect @dK|pg||
nt|eggy:  on this score they are safe I think|pg||
nt|jfeld:  So, Iceland looks safe to me|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Even if Japan blitzed they can't catch them|pg||
nt|eggy:  japan cannot pick up enough more (they are on 21 already)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: If that is so I will congratulate both teams in this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: starting times same throught the event|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play|pg||
nt|rhelle:  North: you guys have a bit of a @h fit|pg||
nt|kareno: Spectators, you'd better reserve your seats for the entire tournament - there is much wonderful bridge coming up!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W decides that 3@d was non forcing and passed|pg||
nt|petergill: At this vulnerability, I'm a big fan of Fleischer's decision to treat KQx as four spades |pg||
nt|petergill: Fleisher I mean|pg||
nt|twcho: if non-@s lead, declarer will go down at most one|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA lead ---> 300 when declarer has to try for 3-3 trumps to try to make his contract, but I think a @D lead might be more likely|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: Dennis?|pg||
nt|rialc2: siamo tutti scossi dalla scomparsa del "grande Sic"!|pg||
nt|fluffy: this double sometimes won't work obviously, but today it brings 500 that can't be beaten|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lechcold: :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i wonder if he has A10x in spades if things would have been different|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Li just left the room -- and now Liu is on his own -- will he manage that?|pg||
nt|ehsana: .....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile 5@D in open room going down undoubled|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi now has a decision to make. Pass, 2NT, 3@D? He has chosen 2NT.|pg||
nt|ady: request for a link to running scores please|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@SX would not have been much fun|pg||

nt|hlortz: thanks msrtin peter and our great kibs & operator.. it was a 2 board match for usa team...|pg||
nt|ritong: pard can hold @s KQJxx and an ace, perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: australia pulled back 5 on hand 29|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Shi seems rather old, Lian is younger (like 30s or 40s)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: ty|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|twcho: now declarer is safe from being punched|pg||
nt|gulyas: S probably showing distribution here|pg||
nt|hlortz: /martin/|pg||
nt|ady: not many top losers in hears with J9 doubleton   but spade force may deadent the club suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Vladimir and Harold and all the specs, absorbing bridge.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s look out of the bidding at this stage|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: once i told Shi is old, he immediately took out his 5@c :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: what a bid 5@C:)|pg||
nt|ady: oh a different turn|pg||
nt|resurectin:  not sure after interference, but usually 2d shows normal opening hand|pg||
nt|eggy:  and sweden are playing New zealand who are the only others who can pvertake them|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz2:  Although the dummy's @c holding looks ominous.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I think south showed some @S now|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Gerbrand when is restart please?|pg||
nt|garden2005: dziêkujê za wspólne kibicowanie - dobranoc :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: I love 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: dont know where that came from|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: from SHI|pg||
nt|yuval10: if X over 2@c was for a lead, and showed good suit, then why not?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i think edgtton is writing that dbl shows interest in bidding 5@h|pg||
nt|ady: though not sure about the west double?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  This looks like an easy 9 tricks with Diamonds coming home|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rensph:  3N is made on a heart lead and continuation here, but if defenders set up a diamond trick early on declarer will still have to find the @SQ|pg||
nt|rensph:  I'm also informed that lauria made 4@S on this hand|pg||
nt|rensph:  3NT, sorry|pg||
nt|jacksond: if plays donde for spade queen he makes quite easily|pg||
nt|rensph:  sorry, 3N making with clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: been called worse|pg||
nt|psyck:  well, if 3N limited hand, he is not looking fro grand|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: from N's double?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: yyy|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: hoi vlad|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: can't properly read the note, all writing are mixed together|pg||
nt|ritong: the line is interesting, though|pg||
nt|ritong: how would you proceed?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  duck 2 spades|pg||
nt|ritong: means two discards from dummy|pg||
nt|jfeld:  and try to duck a heart to the safe hand|pg||
nt|jfeld:  I would pitch a club|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: North realised that his partner must have had some purpose in bidding 2@C checkback. When it turned out that he was not looking for four hearts, he knew that he must have been ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: looking for a 5-3 spade fit.|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@C Krzysztof potraktowa³ jako normalny cue-bid|pg||
nt|famus: Thnks Henery--and i go along with the n key:)|pg||
nt|ady: clubs in fact blocked if the play 3NT    4 spades safer|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know it Italy in slam on hand 31?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yes they are|pg||
nt|ady: apparently ye    tht so|pg||
nt|jfeld:  and a heart|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Rashed, Harold -- and everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wlc|pg||
nt|yuval10: S wanted to bid it anyway but wanted to hear more from opps|pg||
nt|xenya: hoi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: all pressure now on E|pg||
nt|ady: I agree 5@C  from Shi a good possibility   but seemed to be lrking in wings for a couple of rounds|pg||
nt|yuval10: he was affraid that the bidding will stall after 3@s so he bided what he wanted to bid at first place|pg||
nt|ady: this must confirm a good win for China|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: running scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: assuming this makes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: grue hand was a problem response to the overcall, 1@S or 2@C would have worked better|pg||
pc|cK|nt|boedhy:  and offcourse this one is down on @s lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  thinking about it, 6@c is down on a @s lead|pg||
nt|kit: 10 easy tricks with spades splitting, but only 8 in notrump|pg||
nt|brolucius: if you want to listen to Voice Commentary, you should go directly to website: http://www.bridgebase.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 16.45 1hr 20 from now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb they go for 6@D|pg||
nt|gulyas: next set starting at 16:45|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably 3NT is 5422, and now north has to think|pg||
nt|hedyg:  shame only the 1st page of the NS CC is loaded :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DQ so vital here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I try to read what South wrote down|pg||
nt|fluffy: against many 8 HCP hands 6@d has no play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Lauria did bid 4NT as East|pg||
nt|yuval10: it will|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: yes it will make|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: simple after this lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: pls kibs we are not responsible for the bids of the players:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i hear Lian 45 and SHI 47 (your bridge much better than yr agequessing Dennis:)|pg||
nt|eggy:  if he ducks enough spades East he might even end up with a squeeze of West for +1 I think|pg||
pc|cA|nt|famus: yes--too tired--as pointed out by informed kibtz-- taking @H  A wud need to squeeze|pg||

nt|ritong: giving up on that suit|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: this likely to make|pg||
nt|brolucius: (My spelling is better than my typing.)|pg||
nt|barnets: should the two teams meet later on in the KO stages|pg||
nt|barnets: a good match and especially fine performance by the young USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: East doubled 1@C, so not certain that declarer will score four diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will not hold a singleton diamond for his double, so declarer will start with the @DK.|pg||
nt|ady: maybe south will raise|pg||
nt|ady: no|pg||
nt|gulyas: no reason to, he told his story already|pg||
nt|fluffy: soth has told his story, he is not raising|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South going through the auction, and asks who is declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And told he has a good hand for N|pg||

nt|rialc2: interessante e simpatica la difesa di Ovest: sfortunatissima nella situazione|pg||
nt|rialc2: a più tardi. Ciao|pg||
nt|fluffy: so 2@c and then 2NT didn't promise any major|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: especially getting diamonds right|pg||
nt|barnets: this will still be a small swing to USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: With -500 on there partners' card, it was very much the right thing to do (as it happens) to bid game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..their..|pg||
nt|barnets: who will win this match and have a carry forward of some kind|pg||
nt|ady: may make even with 3 diamonds    as long as playing 1st club from north|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: Bye|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: 4@H made -- looks quite a feat... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense didn't play @D early enough|pg||
nt|xenya: so the ddefence slipped in the other room -- and the same may well happen here...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s9|nt|petergill: Now S must rise on @CJ|pg||
nt|kamyk: no ale pamiêtajmy o chorobie Narkiewicza - to musia³o miec istotny wp³yw; ten sam sk³ad by³ w stanie osiagn¹æ du¿o wiêcej; no i jeszcze nie wszystko stracone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if West has @CK  that doesn't help the cause|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: doubled paert score sing   China played 2@C making 10 tricks in OR on hand 30|pg||
nt|yuval10: also http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: China have put a very creditable performance this match  |pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: I think will get diamond right   as does not want west on lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could easily be 4-4-4-1 for his initial take-out double.|pg||
nt|ady: well thx all|pg||
nt|jbennet: wd NS |pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought he might try @SQ|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: b17 and b17 made up for the exact difference between China and Australia sofar|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: b17 and b26|pg||
nt|jbennet: at last a pair who ventured biddin in early stage. reaching their unbeatable 5 Clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i think official playing time was over 7 minutes ago, but no director yet|pg||
nt|yuval10: it looks like the first 5 teams are locked in the QF ( Italy, NET, USA2, Israel and USA1 ) , while many teams are struggling for the last 3 spots|pg||
nt|xenya: so China was 2.5VP ahead of Australia after board 30. With Sweden pressing closely behind the last round is going to be fascinating|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: When you Join a table that has voice commentary (there will always be two during the world championships), you can switch on each of the three commentators.|pg||
nt|famus: tx David|pg||
nt|pelu: the "slam" here need @S 3-2, K onside and @D 3-3|pg||
nt|ritong: which does not cancel the @c option|pg||
nt|jfeld:  well it does |pg||
nt|ritong: does it?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  because of entries|pg||
nt|eggy:  well no squeeze for +1 then as the heart threat has been thrown|pg||
nt|ritong: you have to play for QJ on, no?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|hlortz: bye|pg||
nt|famus: byee|pg||
nt|jfeld:  you can't try diamonds first then|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: I am not sure of the exact carryovers but it usually depends on which team finishes higher in the round robin|pg||
nt|brolucius: West false-carded the @DQ, to mislead declarer as to the position of the @DJ.|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³yszenia,dziêki|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: standings after this round : Neth 161 Italy 155 Israel 149 and usa2 137|pg||
