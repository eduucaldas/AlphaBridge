nt|ahalim: 2NT seems lebensohl|pg||
nt|vbman: when n opens slam is guaranteed|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to reach 7... but 6 should be a walk in the park for these guys|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: first board already an exciting board, minimal opening of N, but nice layout|pg||
mb|2D|nt|viren169: simple J2N|pg||
nt|frankaus: Egtton in early 20's, Gosney just 30+/-|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: hi all|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  a close question whether to double or bid 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Ruia took back his pass and bid 4@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Welcome to Veldhovn|pg||
nt|henryb:  India is third in the Senior Bowl, USA 1 is tied for 7th|pg||
nt|otoj: hi all|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I really like the dble...|pg||
nt|viren169: ruff 4 clubs in North's hand...|pg||
nt|frankaus: the whole AUS open team under 50 quite unusual|pg||
nt|viren169: It is the 5th trump that make South's hand a great hand...|pg||
nt|vbman: exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: indeed young Australian players|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: E is taking time to evaluate his hand|pg||
nt|lechcold: jak to czêsto ostatnimi czasy bywa, seniorzy s¹ nasz¹ ostoj¹...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|henryb:  On the surface 4@s is a very reasonable contract -- down because of the bad red suit breaks.|pg||
nt|3for3: north south play canape with a big club...|pg||
nt|3for3: ew 2/1 american style|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, leading a @d in dummy's suit is not attractive either|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have to go make sure my team is in place. be back shortly|pg||
nt|davidstern: .|pg||
mb|3D|nt|3for3: this sort of auction usually suggests a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: remains a trump|pg||
nt|vbman: 5th trump also means the queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: dizeñ dobry - witam spragnionych dobrej gry i zwyciêstwa dru¿yny polskiej...|pg||
nt|vbman: they might bid grand if they have the technology|pg||
nt|viren169: yes...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: Hi Jaap|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|pelu: both pairs play standard 5 card major, 2-0-1 for the daner only F1|pg||

nt|lechcold: chcia³em w³anie pochwaliæ licytacjê:(|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: an aggressive E could balance|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb:  greetings again|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: kasle is now aware about the five possible discards|pg||
nt|ritong: and the @s 6 shows an odd count|pg||
nt|ritong: basically, 5 when west bid 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: so..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good start Indonesia|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ryskiel_: banalne 10 lew choæ rozgrywaj¹cy jeszcze o tym nie wie, szczególnie po wicie w jego kolor...mo¿e zacznie co kombinowaæ ale szybko oka¿e siê, ¿e strach ma wielkie oczy tylko|pg||
nt|viren169: should be a flat bd...|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but a bit shot into the dark|pg||
nt|ritong: but he might find surprising declarer did not try for @s A on|pg||
nt|pelu: and both pairs - that not normal - play 2@D as weak 2 in @D! - we are back in the 50'es :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vbman: when opps are slamming it is seldom benefitial to dbl anything , only if u want to save vul vs. not|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jacksond: poorish borderline game. looks like 2 losers in both diamonds and clubs even if Diamond ace was favourable|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ryskiel_: nie kombinuje - praktyczny jegomoæ|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: also, a @h cancels the fifth discard|pg||
nt|pelu: same bidding in open|pg||
nt|pelu: but a @c-lead|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzpd: north and south discussing the board in polish|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for W too dangerous imo|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|c3|nt|hlortz: this match will finish 1/3 of the RR  to qualify 8 of the teams for KO usa1 lies 11th italy 12/13|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|pelu: @Dq sh now be safe for declarer|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|henryb:  Declarer might have been better advised to start the crossruff without cashing the @hA|pg||
nt|pelu: in the round robin Denmark won 22-8 and the carry over ios 14,5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d9|pc|h3|nt|henryb:  declarer can now make 5 in several ways: on a club return, a double squeeze with hearts in the middle or a straight forward red suit squeeze against S|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|3for3: now west has to give dummy an entry|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|3for3: 110 and 1 imp to usa|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree...|pg||
nt|vbman: first blood for aussies|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c4|nt|henryb:  anyway, down 1 looks inescapable, and 4 imps to Germany on the first board|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ryskiel_: nasi graj¹ oczywicie WJotem którym tam, a Amerykanie zapewne swoim Standard American|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: w piki to wet bez wistu w atu 12 lew by³o mozliwe do uskrobania:)|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S need to be careful on this one...|pg||
mb|p|nt|otoj: otherwise decl had time to establish club for down 1|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jaapfr: 5@S C NS depending @SK first|pg||
nt|henryb:  South's vulnerable overcall is unlikely to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: 4@S looks good here but down on bad breaks @S 4-1 k@C offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I think they started with spade, than twice harts|pg||
nt|vbman: l cant see a way they stop at 3cl|pg||
nt|viren169: a heavy 2@H|pg||
nt|vbman: unless campos tries something clever|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: not an easy board for N-S to avoid getting too high|pg||
nt|frankaus: N had only 10HCP but 27 zars  - only need 26 to open |pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: Hi Oom Jaap :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: hello all|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: this is a feisty auction|pg||

nt|ahalim: hello don|pg||
nt|otoj: a discipline pass by N.. |pg||
nt|don_kapu: hello mr arifin|pg||
nt|otoj: hi Don..|pg||
nt|viren169: and more pressure from West|pg||
nt|viren169: dble again and pass the 4@C response?|pg||
nt|vbman: or pass out|pg||
nt|frankaus: link to zar points - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: a good preemptive raise from W, S has 19pt and normally does not want to pass|pg||
nt|viren169: South may try (unsuccessfully) 3N|pg||
nt|jacksond: little harder to get to slam after opponents have pre-empted|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Schwartz-Finkel play 2/1 with many special agreements in various auctions|pg||
nt|henryb:  Vivaldi-Mosca also play fairly straightforward methods but unusual 2-bids|pg||
nt|vbman: think the raise will help him|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  3!n is better|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: oj - obawiam siê ¿e to nie obiegnie|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: a safe 6@H save for ew with 6@HX-2|pg||
nt|don_kapu: hi otoj|pg||
nt|josj: selamat malam dari Veldhovend ke Indonesia:)|pg||
nt|jacksond: South going to bid 3NT surely|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S has 4 losers, but in OR the lead was @CA and @C to K and ruff - so Peter Schaltz now have a chance to make|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb:  I expect Schwartz will bid 4@s and probably play there|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi mas Aria:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Laska powstrzymaj szalej¹ce konie proszê...|pg||
nt|viren169: Dble is best...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: south being cautious|pg||

nt|pelu: same lead here - and what else to lead from S?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|viren169: Good lead|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jaapfr: the crux here is how can EW enter the bidding with their @C@H fits (almost impoossible)|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: kontrakt ma szanse jak reforma gier hazardowych w Polsce|pg||
nt|jacksond: North was maybe worth one more bid |pg||

nt|blewah: so 1@c is 16+|pg||

pc|s7|nt|vbman: change play|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: a really interesting bidding sequence, with good judgement from N to get out of 3@s x|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|henryb:  Of course if the N-S cards were switched, 3!n would not look as good|pg||
nt|ahalim: eh ono Liliek|pg||
nt|vbman: l disagree with campos' raise|pg||
nt|szeryf: tu Ryszard Kie³czewski - muszê obs³ugiwaæ dwa pokoje st¹d drugi nick|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  down 1, which is actually a good save against a making 4@h for N-S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hlortz: was mosca's pass over 4@S forcing?  maybe|pg||
nt|3for3: levin doesnt want arnim in to play 2 more rounds of trump|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S failed in open room...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: this is where players err -south knows no defence works therefore play quickly and conservr mental energy - there is a lot of bridge left to be played|pg||

nt|roswolf: but many play it as a big 2 suiter even in this type of sequence|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S, I think, might make 4@s or 5@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They make 5@S, max.|pg||
nt|ritong: EW do not play stayman followed with 2@s as invite, visibly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now 3nt in right hand whilst @C lead very unlikely|pg||
nt|3for3: that will still lead to 3nt|pg||
nt|3for3: I'd lead a club here...|pg||
nt|blewah: yes. 2@c is precision|pg||
nt|lokaty: niestety trefle siê s³abo dziel¹ i przyjdzie polec|pg||
nt|otoj: what will be the lead by W?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 3!v from lasut as a sm and goes to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: also if 2@S would be a wjs - a slam try is indicated|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H clearly slamming|pg||
nt|roswolf: noryth signs off with his load of trash|pg||
nt|roswolf: SHOULD sign off|pg||
nt|henryb:  or four in a "death wish|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3? that's for wimps lol a bold 4!|pg||
nt|3for3: but a spade could have easily been right|pg||
nt|ritong: so they deserve some suffering|pg||
nt|ritong: so do their opponents next room, by the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: very quickly bid by the Australian|pg||
nt|henryb:  This can make against a spade lead if declarer guesses well in @d|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jaapfr: 3nt now imo|pg||
nt|hlortz: well all that wasted @D stuff a bit unlucky but pressing for game not vul seems 'optimistic'|pg||
nt|henryb:  wimpishness has a lot so say for itself: if you had to choose between 2@h and 4@h, 2@h would be most people's choice on the N-S cards :)|pg||
nt|blewah: 6 card 11-15 or 5@c 4M|pg||
nt|henryb:  North has a tough rebid over 3@h. 3@h is forcing - although it does not promise 5|pg||
nt|henryb:  3!n might be right|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: good lead from west here.|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h looks to be down 1: 6 trumps and three aces. But maybe he can set up the long spade while he still has control|pg||
nt|henryb:  @hJ, @s ruff, @cA, @dA -- no. not quite|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: indeed theres a lack of communication for it i guess without loosing trump control|pg||
nt|henryb:  without the trump lead its easy.|pg||
nt|vbman: lead cl win 1 imp|pg||

nt|ritong: can t cancel 40 years of routine so easily, can you?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 2@C in fact|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jaapfr: good 4@S but a pity down 1|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think 5@s does not make if E-W tap dummy before both their spade winners are gone|pg||
nt|henryb:  declarer's best line now is to ruff three clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|westjava: 4th best without honour|pg||
nt|viren169: Match will be all square after this one...|pg||

mb|d|nt|grebrof: the scores are not updated yet http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|roswolf: thinnish 3nt bid and made in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: bidding many close games does put pressure on the defense which sometimes slips|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
mb|4H|nt|blewah: i think 1nt with 5M is gaining popularity|pg||

nt|vbman: 1 sp not my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: probably shows both minors|pg||
nt|viren169: Now N will bid 3@H or some good aise in spades|pg||
mb|d|nt|don_kapu: good evening Jaap from Medan North Sumatrea|pg||
nt|henryb:  North has a tough rebid, made tougher by three small in opener's suit|pg||
nt|kerasidis: an other 3 @d probably would be usefull|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: E wanted to double but changed his mind|pg||
nt|jacksond: 4Sx is a good vulnerable save against 4H.  |pg||
nt|smoller:  Doubledummy all trick can be made in spades and diamonds - will he get 11?|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H down 3 = 800, but W prob bid 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: everywhere in the world but not in Italy. At least all the BB players of that country|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Don dari Sumatera utara:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: north considering a slam try!? hardly worth it|pg||
nt|roswolf: and again using up more mental energy|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is incredible - what is he thinking about - the number of angels you can get on a pinhead!?|pg||
nt|henryb:  meanwhile you sell several 6-7 imp losses to gain one 10 imp or 6 imp gain. not a good tradeoff, imo|pg||
nt|henryb:  close whether to respond 1@h or pass. I would pass. but if he bids 1@h, as he did, partner will raise to 4.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: po partii to musz¹ graæ|pg||
nt|don_kapu: if west bid 3nt, Lasul will take 5 tricks @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: an ace and J, I would respond.|pg||
nt|henryb:  not an easy hand to play. but cards lie favorably|pg||

nt|don_kapu: Hai, blewah|pg||
nt|pelu: no ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  i suspect it is too complicated for declarer to get it right|pg||
nt|blewah: For the italians, the sanctity of 5M cannot be disquised with 1NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like 3@S is the limit here if Declarer gets the trumps right|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: asking meaning of 2@h means 4 card @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: confirmed by Campos|pg||
nt|jacksond: EW never looked at the save|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: sorry|pg||

nt|henryb:  Or three after 2 spades and a club shift?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: N is not agreeing with S bidding on previous game and other way round|pg||

pc|d4|nt|don_kapu: cannot - 1, becouse @S will discard from @S|pg||
nt|blewah: and it works!|pg||
nt|don_kapu: - 2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: declarer is safe because the @SA is right but he dont know that|pg||
nt|henryb:  It will be hard for declarer not to take at least 7 tricks|pg||

pc|cT|nt|don_kapu: but 4@S always by EW|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jacksond: not so easy now|pg||
nt|pelu: Denmark had a row of exelent results, but the last 4 matches not so good: 14 against Pakistan, 12 against Indonesia, 13 against Netherland and only 18 against Guadeloupe|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: either @ds 3/3 or @h ace on|pg||
nt|ritong: guy lasserre will take the lower , in terms of probability, because he knows @ds 3/3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: would not risk the @D finesse and play for @H 3/3 and 10 tricks.|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  3 10s.|pg||

nt|jacksond: seniors dont overcall with Ron's hand. However in the BB and VC it is a different matter|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobh1: this might keep EW out of @Ss|pg||

nt|ritong: rest is worse|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting dble... |pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Most people play x of 4@s is primarily for penalty arround here. I guess that's different in other parts of the world.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: its just awfully good,  but not perfect   |pg||
nt|3for3: on the board, with a vul game swing|pg||

nt|viren169: Me too...|pg||

nt|ritong: perhaps double followed with @hs would show some goodies, as opposed to direct 3@h weaker and distributional|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, always a problem when threatened with @ss|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: "the Viking club" played by Grøtheim and Tundal is probably the most famous system from Norway, but still few players in Norway actually play it|pg||

nt|ritong: thus poizat opts for showing directly the suit|pg||

pc|d5|nt|bobh1: i guess @Hs is better altho both make on this layout|pg||
nt|3for3: slam needs little more than a favorable lie in clubs, but as we can see, today they are not|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|henryb:  On the other hand, even down 4 is only 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 3@D was 1 or both majors with invitational values and 3@S rejected spades|pg||
nt|jacksond: Well if they bid that one wiith so few points then the Australian EW pair will certainly bid this one |pg||
nt|pelu: so @DQ has cost Denmark 41 IMP :(|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: I have had 2 suggestions that S should win @C with ace |pg||
nt|3for3: well, the hearts are quite friendly, so declarer should be fine|pg||
nt|3for3: that would be a great play!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: maaf|pg||

pc|d9|nt|roswolf: hmm as i thought|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  Fisher and Hamilton did well to stop low.|pg||

nt|pelu: now Finkel is out of the bidding with his 6-5|pg||
mb|2N|nt|projekt1: precision 1@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if a bid of 1 @S was unbalanced and bigger hand by W?|pg||
nt|3for3: modern style is to bypass 1@S with 4333...I think this is best|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are right,  she is 4333 |pg||
nt|3for3: east can still checkback for 4@S, i am sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the hand worth a check back? |pg||
nt|sybarra: and aceless 4x1 |pg||
nt|3for3: aceless 11, stiff king of diamonds...but it is a VUL game to shoot for|pg||
nt|sybarra: close  |pg||
nt|josj: Munawar threw a spade to induce the endplay|pg||

mb|3H|nt|roswolf: that was well judged by north imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: ood job backing into game |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I guess Peter (S) diddnt want to bid 1 NT with only xx in @h here, plus they maybe play 1 NT as forcing|pg||
nt|henryb:  Americans balance more freely than most others|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but there a @S discard was needed to make it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 3@h was not absolutely necessary|pg||
mb|4H|nt|3for3: a matter of style whether west shows 4@S or 3@H first|pg||
nt|henryb:  but Hamilton made it because West mistakenly pitched a spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: here 2@C forced 2@D|pg||
nt|viren169: probably playing on clubs until the cows come home|pg||
nt|viren169: or until the E/W give him an entry to dummy with a @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: egtton flipping over @cQ and @d4 in his hand|pg||
nt|viren169: lol... the Q should have been on the table 5 mins ago!|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W will do well to cash their hearts and clubs and exit a spade.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: now he also considers @sK|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like E/W are playing reverse cound so West will know the position when the 2nd club is played...|pg||
nt|pelu: but play for 3Nt by EW - so even down 3 = flat boards against 1NT by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/saopaulo.09/Asp/CrossTableRank.asp?qtournid=783|pg||

mb|d|nt|pelu: as I see only a @D-lead cxan defeat|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: England wasnt qualified and Sweden ended 10th - I guess both these teams want to be in the top 8 this year|pg||
nt|alpagavp: The eighth top teams will be qualified |pg||
mb|p|nt|jacksond: Yes hard for EW to get rich on non vul undertricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: sabine asked if she could have 4 sp|pg||
nt|sybarra: S opened the hand 2 @D in other toom |pg||

nt|petergill: EW Convention Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Brazil/campos-villasboas.pdf|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobh1: South has a really nice hand but no good bid over 1@D|pg||
nt|bobh1: once he passed, he had to bid 3@S because his balancing double could have been much weaker|pg||
nt|alpagavp: in the quarter final, I am pretty sure that both teams here will be qualified|pg||
nt|3for3: well, that is one benefit to bypassing spades!|pg||
nt|lokaty: sz³o 4@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: this looks in trouble now|pg||
nt|pelu: @D lead can kill the discard on @DJ (@c-loser)|pg||

nt|pelu: tx partner :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: yes i would play on spades too|pg||
nt|sybarra: no real lead attractive in the N hand |pg||
nt|3for3: meyers is up to 7 top tricks, with lots of play in clubs and hearts for the other 2|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure this line can ever be right?!?!|pg||
nt|petergill: is reverse count, except is some situations|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h2|nt|bobh1: for his part, N might have jumped to 3@S the first time, but he didn't want to hang his partner for balancing|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's got to get the @Hs right|pg||
nt|bobh1: good defense by giving a @D ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: North in deep thoughts...|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's probably wondering where E's opeing bid is|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobh1: he figured it out|pg||
nt|hlortz: down this time - selling the 6 imps that henry was talking about earlier if of team stays out of game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  Schartz and Finkel have been very accurate so far; can they continue -- not necessary to get a @h ruff, though, they have a natural @s trick|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz2:  Efficient defense.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|smoller:  Nice @H9, Jorgensen?|pg||
nt|pelu: in the bidding S has show 6-4 but with a very weak hand he would bid 2@H over 1@S (and not 2@C)|pg||
nt|pelu: better duck the first @h - |pg||
nt|pelu: Steen can 4@H win if W duck @HK and next time play @c10?|pg||

nt|pelu: Running score Den No 4 - AUS No 7 - Denmark are 6 VP after USA 2, and Australia +14 VP to India (No9)|pg||
nt|pelu: ok|pg||
nt|smoller:  Hardly 1@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: making 6 seems a lot |pg||
nt|santyclz2:  One of the advantages of Polish @c is that @d shows @ds.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (1@d)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: if S hits it can N sit?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: that sud be just =|pg||
nt|3for3: very playable, and as the card lie, makeable 6@H|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D a transfer|pg||
nt|ritong: but it consumes lots of space when @hs can be the strain|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|blewah: it's 20-21 bal in their system|pg||
nt|henryb:  on repeated trump leads, 2@h is probably down|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S anyone?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 25: @D to queen picks up Jx in either hand for 3 tricks, whereas @d to ten does not pick up 3 tricks if loses to king with 4-2 @D|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H shows 6 or more spades|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 2@H is a just a general force... (or an xfer to @S?)|pg||
nt|pelu: D bt N?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yes|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: a quiet partscore|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe hard to reach slam now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@C puppet 3@H etc i suppose|pg||
nt|jacksond: still lots of boards remaining|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: 6@H much better from north|pg||
nt|ritong: therefore 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: A transfer: X of 1@H would have been 4 or 5 spades|pg||
nt|petergill: No 2@H shows 6+ @S 100% for sure|pg||
nt|viren169: with it being a xfer... they should go more slowly to investigate the slam|pg||
nt|viren169: ok thks|pg||
nt|petergill: I think North will probably move|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: the south hand doesn't look like it's a slam on this board|pg||
nt|petergill: North can be very weak with 6 @S, so South has shown a really good hand|pg||
nt|vbman: 6 looser hand opposite another 5-6 looser, may try|pg||
nt|viren169: North will make another move with 2 bullets |pg||
nt|pelu: B9: Australia in 3NT - Lead @H = making|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry Luc - no ? - just the bid I expected :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: tough at imps|pg||
nt|3for3: since the clubs are with east|pg||
nt|blewah: as they don't play puppet stayman |pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: i dont think they will sniff at slam|pg||
nt|viren169: dont like the 4@S bid...|pg||
nt|viren169: wd... now 6@S should be reached...|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C cue, 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
nt|vbman: 2h maybe at least inv'l|pg||
nt|viren169: ...5@D-5@H-6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Nabil Edgtton correctly upgraded his 17 count as too strong for 15-17 1NT. That @D suit is worth more like 9 points than 7 points|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: as south I would write down I would push on to slam and bid 5@d|pg||
nt|viren169: ... I MUST....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: i have already upgrade my profile|pg||
pc|c4|nt|blewah: if i read their CC correctly|pg||
nt|lechcold: gdyby Laska spasowa³ na tê kontrê...:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: maybe S should pass with his whole hand in @Ss|pg||

pc|cK|nt|frankaus: WD|pg||
nt|viren169: lol... why waste time!|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would rebid 2@D instead of 1nt - avoids this inelegant contract|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: y|pg||
nt|alunand14: ya :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lucky guys!!|pg||
nt|petergill: In 6@S, the best play is to draw trumps and try to get the 12th trick from @D, not to try to ruff a club|pg||
nt|viren169: South felt he has to catch up...|pg||
nt|viren169: 2 round of trumps (finding they break) and ruff a @C?!?!|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  4@d looks like a splinter.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  3@c like a mini-splinter but there are several other options possible.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzpd: Yes they play stayman|pg||
nt|blewah: puppet, Karen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no|pg||
nt|alunand14: no, stayman|pg||
nt|petergill: The reason Gos chose 5@C instead of 4NT is that it gave Nabil a way to stop in 5@S, if Nabil's 4@S bid had been a puint instead of the real thing |pg||
pc|h8|nt|grebrof: this is a good contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  If declarer finds out about both black aces before playing trumps, he has a chance to guess the hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  but likely to go wrong|pg||
nt|3for3: once again...wrong :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: its the commentators curse|pg||
nt|sybarra: but n/s have to know they are behind in match, so maybe pressing |pg||
nt|ritong: good luck west|pg||
nt|smoller:  EW will now make 2NT :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong:  |pg||
nt|pelu: but for sure not 2NT from S - bad @C-stopper, and his @Ds not very good - that will cost - 200-300 - |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|viren169: otherwise go back to @Ds|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|alpagavp: For the moment France is 9th and China is 16th|pg||
nt|3for3: that doesnt really pay on the WBF scale.  You win or lose VP's regardless of the score of the match, until you are behind a very large amount|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  E has a very unappatizing hand from which to lead and trys a little trickery.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|grebrof: a more agressive E would have bid the @s-suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Paul Gosney likes bidding 4NT 1430 as much as the rest of us, but there is a time (like here) to pass the captaincy of the decision to partner|pg||
nt|szeryf: only lead to make problems for declearer|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|viren169: yes... I am sure he would have cue 5@H over 5@D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|3for3: and -41 is not large enough....they would still get 6 vp's for that result.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am reminded,  n/s may not think they are behind,  this table has been pretty good |pg||
nt|3for3: well done...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: given explanations|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy lead from E hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: with screen up so both oppenents are clear|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 500|pg||
nt|kerasidis: should he unblock K@s before playing club?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|3for3: good point..from NS things are ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say, I was not looking at leading a club|pg||
nt|3for3: auken has a tough guess, but she cant go wrong...MY kind of guess|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|viren169: Aussies have the lead!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bobh1: better to have played @Ds|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: They are talking about it, he didn't want to make a mistake if it could go down|pg||
nt|petergill: Nabil knew not to look for grand slam, as North would have bid 4NT if searching for grand slam|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  But he can ruff just enough.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 3@c was not a mini splinter, expl at table, 4 card support in @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: N said: I did not know that when the cards from S where on the table|pg||
nt|pelu: difficult position for S - 3NT looks as a fair bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: TD called|pg||
mb|1C|nt|alpagavp: This board is again dangerous, 6@d is a good contract but from north hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx for asking karen|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yw|pg||
mb|1H|nt|smoller:  South called?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no east for time|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: Sabine writing about 2 clubs|pg||
nt|3for3: the dreaded 10-12 nt...makes life tough on the opps..|pg||
nt|3for3: most play that double of 2@C here is a good hand...says nothing about clubs.|pg||
nt|3for3: Like she had penalty doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: you need real methods with this range of nt,  and defending it |pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
mb|1S|nt|grebrof: S does have a huge hand + its not pretty bidding a suit topped by the JT|pg||
nt|alpagavp: quasi impossible to reach|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might get to 6@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  a good slam well reached by the germans in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: make 7, has to ruff 2 D on the table as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: i think Levin wrote as if i had doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: but this is the Venice Cup,  so all systems "on"  |pg||
nt|ritong: not sure poizat reopens|pg||
nt|pelu: who - NS to complain partners bid :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mikael_w: yes, almost posible to beat 3 NT if dec makes alot of missguess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|grebrof: so it should be possible to copy this|pg||
nt|nkgupt: any slam played by N will be cold (not 6@h/@c) :)|pg||
nt|alpagavp: and if we play 6@d for south hand the only lead that beats the contract is @c no?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would bid 1N as West, but it is very unclear|pg||
nt|blewah: no game, but N may get anxious with his hand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|henryb:  Double would be reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|ritong: reasonable|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: which doesnt have much play even on a non spade lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2NT (Jacoby) or 4@D?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not sure what version of Jacoby the Americans play|pg||
nt|henryb:  Much too good for 4@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C short and 3@D short.|pg||
nt|ritong: passed pard, etc|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@c from S, and then...|pg||

nt|don_kapu: -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or 3nt even|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: but different if x |pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: W not into bidding 2@c|pg||
nt|alpagavp: the best is to play 6NT from north|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H shows a smattering of hcp i think|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: yes they do :)|pg||
nt|3for3: better than tiny big writing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: two entire little pages now|pg||
nt|viren169: Will E/W bid game here? And which one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  no; 3@c something and 3@d = what?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 4@s?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was wrong. They made 2@s|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  A mini-splinter is typically something like 8-10 hcp, 4 card trump support and a singleton or void in the bid suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: director in... 35 minutes left|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Pretty tempting though after n's takeout x.|pg||

pc|d2|nt|don_kapu: but East will not agree with 3nt contract|pg||

nt|viren169: what about a 4-4 @H fit (if it exists?)|pg||
nt|viren169: I think Declarer will go down 2 trying to make it here...|pg||

nt|grebrof: if you can have 6 card minor in your 1nt - I rather bid it at the 3level|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|grebrof: NS obviously using Rusinov leads|pg||
nt|grebrof: leading something else might have been better|pg||
nt|grebrof: finding the @s Q is not important anymore - contract should be safe as there are no ruffs anywhere|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, we all would lead @hs, but even that lead might not beat this contract|pg||
nt|viren169: and 6@C said that I think we are high enough!|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot see any endplay or squeeze - if there was one, Tony Nunn would almost certainly have found it|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|grebrof: if P can bid some sort of Stayman - you normally can make 3@c/@ds OR it is a better contract than 1nt anyway|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: looks like the Polish have dropped to 3rd place and Germany is now just in the top 8|pg||
nt|pelu: gift-shop :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Yes!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|3for3: Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Danny always a pleasure |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Felipe,  great job   |pg||
mb|3D!|an|majors|nt|3for3: big club|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thanks to all of the specs for your great comments,   lots of fun |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: last board of this match|pg||
nt|pelu: remember board 12 where S passed after the RD - in OR S bid 1@D - and NS played 3@D making|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: y thx harold|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H looks likely|pg||
nt|hlortz: and its 3:35am here in seattle so i'm off to bed. enjoyable comments and some action hads|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D multi overcall?|pg||
nt|sybarra: something special |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ty! lets see if we get to 100 imps on this set|pg||
nt|ritong: ah haa|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C on @SQ lead: Clubs 4-1 is more likely than @D 6-1, so declarer would get that guess right|pg||
nt|viren169: And finally onto the last....|pg||
nt|jacksond: Last board. If scores in all matches remain much as they are it looks like denmark will finish 4th in RR. Unfortunately for them that means they will nearly certtainly play USA 1 ...|pg||
nt|jacksond: in quarterfinals as USA look like finishing in 5-8 spot and the top thre in the RR will avoid picking USA1|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: tom. the quarter finals will start|pg||
nt|smoller:  Looks like the Copenhagen convention|pg||
mb|4S|nt|grebrof: I think mainly your P has to be able to dbl/bid 1nt or so if a balancing with those 10hp should be right - but ok|pg||
nt|alunand14: thanks karen.....thanks jaap......thanks all :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  will A make a negative double? yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: on 13, where NS had a shapely 11 opposite 8, they did bid 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h is 5+@h, 5+ second suit, less than opening strength|pg||
nt|hlortz: hands that n key is nnnnnnnnnnnnnnot going to behave :)|pg||
nt|ritong: allez allez!|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks Karen, WBF and BBO (including all kibz and commentators)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is marginal at best|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rest of our friends did fall asleep:)|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C can be doubleton if 4432 or 5332|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Rob.  A big hand for our operator Rob Jetten, great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ty for watching and see you later for the final round of 21|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ty, ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: :)|pg||
nt|smoller:  5-5 or more in majors|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ritong: à partir de cette ouverture, ça ira|pg||
nt|ritong: bon choix philou|pg||
nt|ritong: en plus lassere est déclarant, ça le rassurera, à propos des @h|pg||
nt|ritong: lasserre*|pg||
nt|ritong: si c est necéssaire|pg||
nt|pelu: DEN 2 VPs from 3.place - still 4 boards in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: and lost 5 imps|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = 4 or 5 spades, not 6 spades|pg||
nt|viren169: what do you do with 6 spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: east didn't even dare to support on his 4crd suit|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry I lost connection|pg||
nt|smoller:  Oh, needing 3 covercards from South|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: see you all tomorrow for the next matches, starting at 10.30 hours|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may use the "multi overcall" vs a big club system |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am guessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I think they are yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult auction for n/s to get into, but then do they really want to be "in" |pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: Last board|pg||
nt|alpagavp: the results are here|pg||
nt|alpagavp: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: selamat tidur and good evening bye all|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: this looks like a good save for NS|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like down 1, no tragedy when 4@d makes E-W|pg||
nt|ritong: carrément|pg||
nt|ritong: il est vraiment rassuré:)|pg||
nt|ritong: le score final devrait être 18/12|pg||
nt|ritong: pas de gros bobo|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I'm not sure if I read the explanation of 3@H right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: perfect pressure bid 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: and again the last board is an exciting one.....|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: power bidding|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: Last board, and I will tx our operator Luc for at perfect job, and Steen Mollere for his commentatting - a real expert - kibs has not been very active but tx to u also - see u ...|pg||
nt|pelu: again|pg||
pc|cA|nt|grebrof: 4 @s must be better than this|pg||
nt|3for3: meyers cant be sad defending with 6 trump is always fun|pg||
nt|sybarra: if Sabine passes,   might have been -2 and tied match?|pg||
nt|3for3: i think it would have been better than that for ew.|pg||
nt|ritong: il va tabler très vite|pg||
nt|lokaty: dwa ostatnie rozdania nieciekawe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if 5@H and expected @SA lead N has enough @S to falsecard and E might continue @D in tr 2|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hlortz: even better 3n makes ew also lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D can make except for super defence, @CA and small @S.:)|pg||
nt|projekt1: again a possibility for phantastic defence : @cA -10, low @s -  @c ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Might nip this a trick but it's going to be closer than s expects.  Can e avoid a @s loser?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Double-dummy he can but in the real world...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||

pc|c6|nt|bobh1: EW have a @S game|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2N made it awkward for them to find it|pg||
nt|pelu: 9 toptricks for NS when @D J!= drop|pg||
pc|s9|nt|grebrof: as predicted, the swedish kids at the other table werent fooled into bidding 3nt on board 30 - with a luckyer layout it would make, but streching at nonvul rarely wins you ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: teammatches|pg||
nt|alunand14: jaap, good news from Indonesia ladies : board 28 play 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  with the favorable location of both kings and good diamond break declarer should make 3 or four, winning 2 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: jorgensen appologizes|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: that he had nothing to think about|pg||
nt|jacksond: Notice Rons 1NT opening here|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|grebrof: unfortunately, the lead makes the contract for NS|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The moment of truth:)|pg||
nt|smoller:  Luckily for NS the ruff will cost a natural trump trick|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s2|pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  but a win by 43 for US1, maximum VP|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wow-wd.|pg||

nt|roswolf: and will cost an imp|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra:  brazil made 2 sp against usa |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx feliipe for info |pg||
nt|pelu: even if he open (normal) with 1@C then 2@S from E, neg D from S and 3NT by N|pg||
nt|jacksond: sure not saying a different contract will be reached on these cards  BUT on other hands yes|pg||
nt|pelu: that is his problem :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: NS play 10-12 1NT in 1st seat at fav vul, hence this auction (no 1NT opening by N)|pg||
