mb|p|nt|rv: I suspect Grue will come in again with 4@s|pg||

nt|rv: identical result in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all 6 semi-final matches are playing the same boards   and all are being shown on BBO|pg||
nt|rv: still I am sure it will do confidence of Grue-Lall a world of good to score one over Levin-Weinstein|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10 imps for USA2 is carryover from the Round Robin head-to-head match|pg||
nt|szalay: about young turks: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Turks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: USA2 has had the better of USA1 in the last 2 meetings|pg||
nt|szalay: bloody push, we can say|pg||
nt|szalay: btw 4@S is making, so not a big deal|pg||

nt|brolucius: China beat them by 1 IMP in a great match. (There was a very rare vice squeeze on the last board - worth looking up in the VG records).|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|hlortz: er 130 i mean\|pg||

nt|brolucius: A 12-IMP lead is nothing much, but it is a lot different to the score of one set ago.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bocchi-Madala CC: http://goo.gl/B2bUO|pg||
nt|paulg:  Shi-Lian CC: http://goo.gl/5M0ah|pg||
nt|brolucius: The @SQ lead would give declarer 4 spade tricks and a second heart discard.|pg||
nt|ady: may well settle for 3NT   these type of boards can create such big swings on a guess|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: part score in diamonds  looks best|pg||
nt|brolucius: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||

nt|ady: could Bocchi get over ambitious in hearts|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|antoniz: witam serdecznie:)|pg||
nt|ady: bid diamond fit e/w    but 2 aces   so just game in diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live is the link for the live stream|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@c strong, 1@h natural pass = 0-4 or penalty pass?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brolucius: Bocchi's 1@C is natural. All 3 Italian pairs play 2-over 1, which means that a two-level response to one of a suit is game-forcing.|pg||

nt|xenya: 3@C was nor forcing|pg||
mb|d!|nt|gracelin: Lian and Dhi is the natural pair in the Chinese team.  Bocchi also play natural with variable 1NT range|pg||
nt|gracelin: we sstart the match with a slam hand.  6S is cold and 7S on the D finesse which works.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy is now lying first comfortably with an average of 24 VP in the first 4 round.  China lies 13th at moment.|pg||

nt|ady: major suit lead gives it|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lian and Shi are not playing a strong 1@C system. One of a minor is natural and may be as few as 3 cards.|pg||
nt|ady: though a low spade  even from west does not|pg||
nt|ady: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lechcold: witam na meczu Polska-Bu³garia|pg||
nt|brolucius: Wooldridge bid 1NT (transfer to 2@C) intending to support spades on the next round. That is why transfers are so effective in many situations. They give you two bites at the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: cherry.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wooldridge explaining he is not 100% sure if 1nt shows clubs or could be a raise in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sometimes they differ , depends on 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but hurd explained as @C ,  madala just wants to know the insides|pg||
nt|ady: would double of 3@S be penalty from North  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ins & outs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: madala asking for the director|pg||
nt|brolucius: When 1@C is basically natural but maybe two or three cards, it is usually best for the defenders to treat it as natural in their subsequent bidding.|pg||
nt|barnets: it seems norths double relates to wests 1n bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  1N=transfer to @C's, but since N opened 1@C, this showed a strong 3-card raise.  Hurd's immediate 2@S over the X showed a minimum|pg||
nt|ady: not sure  what south is meant to do?|pg||
nt|barnets: if wests bid showed clubs perhaps norths x also showed clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: That agreement prevents any misunderstandings, such as may have arisen here.|pg||
nt|barnets: hence x of 3@S would also be penalty|pg||
nt|barnets: by north|pg||
nt|ady: that would seem to be a reasonable choice|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's not immediately obvious why N/S should call the director. They are probably happy to be defending 3@S.|pg||
nt|barnets: 3 rounds of spades would seem to defeat 3@SX even with 3 club tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: hoi Gerbrand :)|pg||
nt|ady: lost of wast paper in  south hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: Gerbrand will enter the names asap|pg||
nt|ady: tricky for south    good opening bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||

nt|pelu: Fredin-Fallenius also very naturel 5 card major, 1NT 14-16/15-17|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D showed a bal 18-19|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry that we missed this board, it was due to technical problems|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm almost certain no other table will be as shy as this one|pg||
nt|fluffy: pass is more flexible than other partnerships, upmark has too many extras to just bid 3@c so he douebles|pg||
mb|d|nt|fluffy: the important factor here for south, is that perhaps on some meanings of 1NT he is on forcing now, and on others he isnt|pg||
nt|ady: with spades breaking well there will be no problem|pg||
nt|kit: Bocchi will have to cover, giving declarer the heart discard.|pg||
nt|ady: east shows 6 diamonds and 5 hearts|pg||

nt|gracelin: Lian and Shi is the only natural pair in the Chinese team.  So in closed room North for China will pen 14-16 1NT and south has less reason t try slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT was slightly ambitious.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West had an obvious raise with that splendid heart suit.|pg||
nt|lechcold: to powa¿ny przeciwnik, który siê powa¿nie liczy w walce o awans do ósemki |pg||

nt|ady: west preferemce to 3@D game forcing|pg||
nt|ady: with a weak preference  might bid 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2NT is artificial as always, not sure if showing a weak hand or both minors, 3NT to play|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: apart from the club suit all looks well|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: Hi all and welcome to the last round in the Round Robin at the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: a fairly normal 3nt to bid - diamond lead would have been nasty|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: since they are in GF tempo, mabe south will rebid is spade suit and get a raise on the way to 6S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense is easier now east has bid diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they didnt|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since N didnt confirm a fit yet, South redoubled just in case EW were in trouble|pg||
nt|hlortz: grue a bit aggressive with his 4 count imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: antykontra Mihova mo¿e spowodowaæ wist  treflowy |pg||

nt|vugraphznt: if S ducks one @h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and I guess thats not DD :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes that may work also|pg||
nt|ady: an extra diamond trick on that lead as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Joe Grue to be aggressive, he usually only needs 13 cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi al, how true|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|brolucius: East tries to slip through a 9th trick in diamonds. |pg||
nt|brolucius: By leading the jack, pretending to finesse against the Q, he aims to catch South asleep. Not today!|pg||
nt|desinka: hello all|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps NS weren't prepared to defend against this 1NT convention|pg||
nt|fluffy: looks like Bocchi though that double of 1NT asked partner not to make any forward moves, but south didn't understand it that way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to understand that 5@D. His partner did not have enough to bid 2@D on the first round.|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  so far both teams have I think exceeded their own expectations for the RR|pg||
nt|ritong: hallo gerben|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  US2 are solidly in 3rd place, and Iceland are in 6th with an excellent position to qualify|pg||
nt|jfeld:  South has entry problems to take the correct view in diamonds, but fortunately hearts are 4-4, so he won't get tapped out.|pg||
nt|eggy:  Pretty experienced the Iceland team though|pg||

nt|brolucius: Happy memories!|pg||
nt|gracelin: How can you forget it ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The early days of Precision Club.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south plays 6C guess West will lead a trump and eveything is down to the H guess.|pg||
nt|ady: could be a 20 odd imp swing if Italy bid this swing  on making and going down|pg||
nt|ady: bid this slam|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy lost 3 slam swings last set (all going dow in slams), could this be a 4th one ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has bid clubs first, as it happens, and West wil be on lead against a slam in that suit. The @SQ lead would work very badly.|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: N: "Exciting auction on the first hand"|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: ok tranfers answers on 1@c, |pg||

nt|vugraphznt: east might think the one Ace isn't @cA, for West did not bid 4@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: The general guideline is to lead aggressively against a suit slam, and passively against 6NT. But here both hands are balanced and a passive lead will work well against 6@C.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: 6D will go down if it's East hold that K10xx in trumps.  |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes some players from the 1991 winning team|pg||
nt|roswolf: low heart would be ideal perhaps!?|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6NT is down even if declarer guess H.  But I thk hey have found the club fut.|pg||

pc|c7|nt|vugraphznt: and now focus is on Einarsson|pg||
nt|ady: life made very difficult for n/s|pg||
nt|roswolf: against 6nt|pg||
nt|ady: settled for game|pg||
nt|ady: maybe felt too flat |pg||
nt|roswolf: against 5@C probably doesnt matter:)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Our valiant operator is trying to recover from the crash (which of course was not his fault at all).|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Jorgensen played with Baldursson in 1991|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and Jonsson was the third in this team playing in 1991|pg||
nt|jfeld:  So, Declarer will most likely make after the heart lead|pg||
nt|xenya: no 8th trick in sight|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 2 ways to cause problem for opps to prepare: either no notes or very long one|pg||
nt|gracelin: just a matter of overtrick.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mathat: Q @c lead 3 r  @h|pg||
nt|ady: I feel this should have been 300 the other way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry the cc for stansby-martel does not cover this sequence, i believe 3@C shows a minimum, after that i would be guessing|pg||
nt|pelu: we have the vuegraf-match here, so OR will start in 5 min|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gracelin: declarer may have a guess at the end whether West has 3 or 4 cards heart.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Einarsson is now shaking his head -- he now knows he did the wrong thing|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but a @h now -|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not necissarily|pg||
nt|roswolf: brave decision to leave Bocchi in here he had a rough session4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gulyas: S knew his @SKQ was worthless, and he had no ace, so maybe his hand is not worth much|pg||
nt|ady: I am told 6@H in OR   A@S lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not possible to calculate the odds precisely, for North-South, and they have very reasonably stopped short. Perhaps they remembered the several failing slams in the last set.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart ruffed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: after 21 rounds the first 8 teams (of 22) qualify for the quarter finals|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: australia currently 8th, china 11th|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: the difference only 10 VP|pg||
nt|ady: cant see the logic of going to 6@D     can be best on a finesse if west has Ace and jack of spades  and asit is here no play at all|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: I presume he will discard the losing club on 3-round of H.  But he smply takes the trump finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: Martel has to block the diamonds so he can take another spade finesse, so he will make only 11 tricks.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: we dont understand the bidding, but the finalk contract is perect |pg||
nt|pelu: perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 4d i think it was club control|pg||

nt|tax456: ha fatto scopa con 2 moto|pg||
nt|fluffy: passing 2NT was not a success and obviously NS have 8 top tricks to cash|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is a bit unusual to allow 1@H - 2@H to play, but Bocchi was right to pass, as it happens.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: 4S is als down as there is no entry t dummy to take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: mind you 4@S is lucky to make|pg||
nt|barnets: it doesnt|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: I'm surprised Stansby selling out to 3@C with a void.  Seems right to compete with 3@D.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true a natural bid.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  you have to think what is passed out more often - I guess 1@D|pg||
nt|jfeld:  here, it works out as he gets to find out about the diamond fit immediately.|pg||
nt|jfeld:  If they get aggressive and bid a slam, it should make if declarer takes the percentage line in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 9 |pg||
nt|barnets: make|pg||
nt|barnets: as patrick said|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: Hi Ian :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: if 3@c constructive stansby must wonder why he's doubled with his 19 hcp|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think it's for minors -- just a reasonably strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H bound to fail as the cards lie, but what else could NS do?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Barel forgot Zack had passed in 1st seat|pg||

nt|barnets: So South survived a potential second disaster as a diamond lead would have produced 1100 should west have chanced a x of 3@H|pg||
nt|szalay: X:majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 4@H   last train|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last train =  still some interest, can't bid beyond game, says nothing about this suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jaapfr: kibs tell me 5@C can be made but I believe it can not be made (always also @S loser)|pg||
nt|ady: think it might be right for Sementa to run when doubled|pg||
nt|lechcold: król pik móg³by daæ niez³y efekt:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: this morning 1st session was China-Netherlands Shi and Li now Shi and Lian? (if I remember correctly)|pg||
nt|athene: surprising to see this misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|ady: may have been better to cash other club winner first|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: hoi william|pg||
nt|ady: hi William|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: from the 5H bid and the double, it's likely that north has a singleton trump|pg||
nt|kit: It took a different lead to defeat this -- but E-W should be in 3@H|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gracelin: how can he believe north bids 5H at unfav Vul. with this 5422 hand.|pg||
nt|jfeld:  interesting. I would have thought Hurd would have done more with his 22 count after the inverted raise|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer finesses in spades, seeking a discard for one of his diamond losers.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: most partnerships, you would think, at this level, would have discussed if system is on after a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i think this is an important match for both teams - fighting for the last qualifying spot|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jaapfr: yes DD 5@C can be made|pg||
nt|hedyg:  the OR is starting play now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pull 1@C and ruff 4th @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 10 min later than we do, we have theathre here :)|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H best|pg||
nt|hlortz: or perhaps a @D ruff for north?|pg||
nt|ady: likely 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H and back would further damage N's plan to ruff @S.|pg||
nt|xenya: a kibitzer points out that 4@S might make -- possible in some variations, but certainly not on a heart lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  they play inverted by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: s passed|pg||
nt|ady: K@H   not a gret feature for a balaance|pg||
nt|brolucius: When one side has a trump fit and stops at the two-level, you usually know that your side holds around half the points and should have a fit somewhere. Hence the conditions are ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: optimal for protection.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Bocchi maybe cautious at this Vul.|pg||
nt|roswolf: assuming no club ruffs - hmm not favorite then:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: The location of the king of spades means that South does well in 3@C, but the same location means that E-W won't make 3@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after all, north only bid 2H in first round.  So maybe declarer will figure it out.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will have to finish this and re start to link with other table so after this hand ill close this|pg||
nt|gracelin: got it|pg||
nt|ady: not best  as J@D will set up the 9    and low diamond will in affent mean north ruffing a loser  and then trumps 2-2|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|hlortz: nah thats setting up a @D i told him wrong lol|pg||
nt|hlortz: whatever, it looks like they were not on same page 3@c prob not dbled & -1  this is going for 500 i think|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: 2Nt here ask for better minor, so N is forced to bid 3@C|pg||

pc|c3|nt|idc: We have Martel-Stansby playing 12-14 NT & 5-card majors, Camps/Villas-Boas 15-17 & 5-card majors|pg||
nt|ady: now 9@D 8th trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  or was a max. simple raise with 4333?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rhelle:  hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This room will be shut down shortly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator needs to reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|gracelin: moment of truth. he would love to finesse the SJ but entry is not cnvenient|pg||
nt|gracelin: This is the first time Lian plays for China.  His partner Shi is a veteran and reach semi-final in the 2009 BB|pg||
nt|jfeld:  I'm not sure. |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bafieri: undo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't blame 1@S  but not sure if  2@S or 3@H gets more credit for missing game|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rhelle:  NS had a relay sequence, where North asked South questions about his distribution and strength|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cards are not favourably placed for the contract.|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 2 off now, declarer losing 2 spades, 2 clubs and the @HA|pg||
nt|ady: now west in the club   better to have cashed earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: example   Zack could have bid 3@H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jaapfr vg: ty I was informed that there are 2 players named Shi in the Chinese team|pg||
nt|athene: most pairs simply agree system is indeed "on"; i.e. you respond to a 1nt overcall just as though partner had opened 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: that might not be optimal, since it's unlikely you will want to transfer to opener's suit, for example|pg||
nt|athene: but it is definitely simplest|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and this morning was Shi and Hou playing (ty Dennis)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: another Shi I suppose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 17  Hurd 2@H North|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: well he could have floated spade 9|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg:  this is going to fall apart any moment now|pg||
nt|ady: heading towards 800|pg||
nt|jaapfr: EW will have more problems to digest this board than the Dutch lunch they just got Gerbrand:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I Don't know what they had for lunch..|pg||
nt|hedyg:  he can make  3 more tricks only|pg||
nt|ady: this looks a bright start for Netherlands   as far as this table is concerned  they would think they did well to stop out of a slam hand 1|pg||
nt|hedyg:  @c ruffed high and claim -3|pg||
nt|famus: Hello everyone, David Henry|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs: why nor take the chance and bid 2Nt - hope for 3@C and if 3@D from S then normal 4 card suit (even 5)|pg||
nt|xenya: just continue diamonds, E pitching spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: confirmed|pg||
nt|ady: 12 to China  1stt hand  where 6@D down 1 in this room|pg||
nt|warrens:  best now is for S to play the Q of @H's, which will help him endplay one of thedefenders|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: or maybe i was wrong and a club was needed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: You can see what a good idea it was for North to keep the bidding alive over 2@H (which would have made). You should always be reluctant to let the opponents play at the two-level ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in a fit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he's on the wrong track|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually north is squeezed|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mathat: think bocchi in vuln bid 5 with sngl @s|pg||
nt|gracelin: south cannot hace a singleton club, or he would lead one for the ruff, so the finesse is to play south for 3-5-3-2 very unlikely since north is raising 2H with 6|pg||

nt|eggy:  I agree, but he knew that S must have a very robust heart holding after the 3NT bid|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 3NT instead of 3@h indicates that south had already shown rength|pg||
nt|jfeld:  sorry, probably not givent that they open so aggressively|pg||
nt|jfeld:  good point Henry.|pg||
nt|eggy:  He had also denied a four card Major, so a spade loser was almost certain|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@D - 2@D wasn't inverted by an unpassed hand |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S passed in first seet -- so 2@d was "just normal" - not inverted minor|pg||
nt|ritong: not that 3@h shows anything else than a half stopper, although 3Nt sounds definitely discouraging|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Barel could have bid 4@H over 2@S|pg||
nt|szalay: very well played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good hand for specs to see that one way to pull trump  is to play your long side-suit|pg||

nt|jfeld:  Thanks|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: still i'm sure they would have got there had without the 1@S opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will fleisher try 2@D [weak 2M opener]|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!s|nt|rhelle:  East will be tempted to pass this|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S a save|pg||
nt|barnets: a low diamond lead V 6@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: both sides play fairly natural systems 5 card majors 15-17nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D is american multi, i am not allowed to say the real name|pg||
nt|hlortz: if this keeps up many IMPs will be scored since -500 figures to be a big swing also  not 17 tho|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: here better not to try slam which fails|pg||
nt|ady: n;s may possibly get overboard here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D    ok, i did NOT see that coming|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they use 2@D to show the weak hands with (5)6-card Major|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North may respond 4@S  to his partner's one-bid. No, he has preferred 1@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we are up to speed now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: had to claim the first 2 |pg||

nt|Gerben42:  2NT is natural in passout - important to discuss with a partner but should be standard|pg||
nt|eggy:  really - it looked like the strength of an inverted minor!|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w can make 3@C here|pg||
nt|gracelin: 12-14 1NT at this Vul.|pg||
mb|1S!|an|2/3 c!s 11-14|nt|rhelle:  And now West has a problem. 2@s is non forcing, but he has a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: but nanev, with singleton spade facing a takeout double, might bid on|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@SX in other room|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Oh, the pressure...|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry, hard to see the claims|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect 3@D is some kind of forcing spade raise|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play 3NT e/w|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1 Levin in 3@D East|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he did not like the @HK, but if both sides can make something you should not let the vulnerability stop you from competing. |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: The Brazilian Federation has player profiles on-line, look at: http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/joaopaulocampos.php|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting hand and would require caution to stay at reasonable level.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this Chinese pair not playing Precision, but a natural system|pg||
nt|roswolf: will they find a way to game on such thin values and making 10 tricks would be no sinecure|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rhelle:  He doesn't know about the wasted @h values in his partner's hand, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this sort of auction some play 2NT by the opener as weak-strong. That allows them to show a strong 3@C rebid (by bidding 3@C) or a shapely weaker one (via 2NT).|pg||
nt|ady: can the get a penalty in 1 heart|pg||
nt|ady: e/w heading for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: fearing his opponents have a huge fit and more shape than they do have|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this will limp home|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do anyone here have the link for running scores|pg||
nt|ady: yes   6@H can be beaten  |pg||
nt|kit: I don't know the N-S structure here -- I imagine the follow-up will show a strong 5-5|pg||
nt|roswolf: because of the vul west didnt play for pens|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@s invitational with 5@s|pg||
nt|fluffy: south has very good hand althou minimum|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT would be 15+ to 18, so the 2NT rebid is weak.|pg||
nt|roswolf: no the safe low road|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|fabsayc: at wbf.org|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@SX is also interesting|pg||

nt|ahollan1: puppet stayman|pg||
mb|3S!|an|balanced choice of games|nt|kit: This is interesting.  East will lead a high heart and shift to a minor.  But does he shift to the suit where he has the king, or where he doesn't?  That is what declarer will have ...|pg||
nt|kit: to judge.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: although with @H 3-3 and IF @H lead ........ 6@D could be made|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D has many interesting chances|pg||
nt|athene: if the trumps come in|pg||
nt|athene: for example, on a club lead, you could win the ace, draw trumps, cash three rounds of spades discarding a club, and exit a club|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: IF:)|pg||
nt|ady: 3Nt might have gone down on a club lead if south reads the hand wrong|pg||

nt|fluffy: forcing him to lead a diamond|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: when he bids 4nt you might think it is offering two places to play, in which case he should pass 5@C|pg||

nt|roswolf: settles for the minor game - understandable enough|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This doesnt look like it can make|pg||
nt|ady: I think would need to drop bare A@D to have a chance in 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  no chance|pg||
nt|roswolf: no very much uphill|pg||
nt|fluffy: assuming he doesn't give the contract away with the lead wich was certainly reasonable given that his only safe lead was a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and he does that at trick 1 instead :)|pg||

nt|gracelin: with their accurate defense, they beat a lot of 2-level contracts that were made at othe table.  That also make them less inclined to bid in boardline cases.|pg||
nt|roswolf: competent bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: N/S are not playing a strong 1@C system. That is probably why North did not want to make a pre-emptive 4@S response - in case his partner was strong and they could make a slam.|pg||
nt|santyclz: W has no quick entry to allow a @s thru.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@S makes easily for me|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and how get @DQT3 out?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes it is a common treatment that you lead your honor above the gap with 4 out of 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads 3rd/5th against suit AND nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ady: easy contract   a matter of 9 or 10 I would thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  the problem for East is communication. He can throw @cs on @h KQ, but how to get there?|pg||
nt|brolucius: When dummy has only one card in the suit led, the partner of the opening leader can give a suit preference card to suggest a switch.|pg||
nt|ady: spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be another swing to USA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@C-1 looks too many tricks made to me|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes this is a team of [relatively] young stars|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @C2 shows preference for @H     i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Lian was in a tough situation to guess the trump layout under the bidding.  Italy really earned this swing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2s was 5+ spades veery weak|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sementa led a trump in the other room against 4S, which is tougher for declarer.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thought max 10 tricks in @C b1|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead best|pg||
nt|famus: @ds wud b the best lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: trump leads are best and so it was|pg||
nt|ady: good lead|pg||
nt|famus: gr8--Grue heard us--prblm for declarer |pg||
nt|ady: bad club split will beat this|pg||
nt|ady: I think down 2|pg||
nt|hlortz: thats my guess -2|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: not possible to see what they write down|pg||
nt|fluffy: who says the strong hand must play the board now? :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is an invite sequence i thik|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no, 3@s was GF|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphznt: 2 clubs 15+ any reverse without 3spades or nat|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  8 easy tricks - 2 0 4 2 and a likely @h.|pg||
nt|idc: Since the defensive entries (@dT & @hA) are split N-S, defence won't be able to get at club winners|pg||
nt|ady: semi psyche by north    no action from south   believed vulnerable opps|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Polska-Izrael jutro ponownie z przekazem wideo|pg||
nt|pawel90: czemu po treflu nie jest bez trzech?|pg||
nt|kit: It looks like the defense should be able to establish enough black-suit winners before declarer can set up the diamonds, but they will have to be careful.|pg||
nt|ady: needs to keep to 2 trump losers  so a reasonable game   but not making|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
nt|roswolf: the play is likely to take some time|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately  evening knowing of diamond position still cannot make|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks are available here -- but that's neither here nor there|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  also Q from KQ109x for example|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think ACBL allows odd/even except 1st discard|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3n is  hand to go for coffee|pg||
nt|brolucius: I saw Bocchi interviewed on some internet video and he said that this was one of the strongest Italian teams ever, with three good pairs who were all friends.|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 11|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm they wobbled a lot in the last set|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: sometimes when you have a scrambling bid like this you can use it to show a weak bid in the highest-ranking suit|pg||
nt|idc: Of course, declarer doesn't know heart layout, so this could still be tricky|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can"t be bid though makes.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: Now club ruff, heart ruff, and eventual diamond finesse will make|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rhelle:  North needs to take and shift to a @c - but not sure even that is enough|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a high spade, if 10 or J drops, he may ruff to hand to ruff the 3rd H.  If nothing drops, just pull the other trump|pg||
nt|kit: Nice choice to get to 5@D -- that will probably come home, although not clear.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree.  5 H's, 1@S, 1@C and 4 @D's (ruff one club in dummy, draw trump)|pg||
nt|kit: In principle declarer would have 3 diamond winneers in North, 1 ruff in South, 5 hearts, and two black aces, but club leads by defense could cause problems.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3H by north makes since west can never get in to play spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: game pplayed by north would be interesting on this layout|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fun at table regarding playing s!10|pg||
nt|gracelin: on C2 lead, dummy has to insert CJ to deny West an entry.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: in other words 5@H over 4@S would be "good" and 4nt - whatever - 5@H is "bad"|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  allows p to contribute the missing honor|pg||
nt|jfeld:  To read about the players you can check out the team profiles here. USA 2: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/usa2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: I wonder what declarer would have done on a diamond shift|pg||
nt|xenya: club now planning to ruff a club and discard a @D on the @H K|pg||
nt|athene: well, obviously, your first job in 6@D is to persuade west not to hold @DQ10x|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Hamza|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rhelle:  the @h2 may help - Lavinthal for @cs|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Of course, North also doesn't know that the 2@h opening was so weak in @h|pg||
nt|famus: bad everthing split i think-even trumps|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Iceland: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/iceland|pg||
nt|xenya: EW might have had trouble bidding this hand if left to their own devices |pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2  Levin 4@H East   but easier for them after Ginossar opened 2-suited 2@S|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kit: Well, that call undid the good work of finding the diamond fit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: west there is a lot of potential tricks in the club suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphznt: here we go again :)|pg||
nt|pawel90: o. teraz jest :)|pg||
nt|kit: Since declarer needs to ruff 1 club in dummy, it looks like his only hope is KQ doubleton of diamonds.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I think that's an excellent site by the way, thank you for that |pg||
nt|ritong: some play " strong K" these agreements have to be made for every pair|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphznt: gives a heart and discards all the clubs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rhelle:  good switch|pg||
nt|boedhy:  hi Rob and all|pg||
nt|rhelle:  hello|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes but too late I think|pg||
nt|rhelle:  no, just in time|pg||
nt|santyclz: N will think about what to ruff with on the 3rd @c, but it won't matter.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That might ddepend on whether he believed the SP signal that West had chosen to give.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the 3NT board that we watched a moment ago, the bidding and result were the same at the other table. You can check such things by hitting the MOVIE button at the bottom.|pg||
nt|athene: but as he is a passed hand i am not sure there is any need to make that distinction|pg||
nt|ady: likely to go down   will have to play exactly right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: most wil be in 4@S here I suppose|pg||
nt|ady: finess the spade   and get J@C right|pg||

nt|ady: nice lay for 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: you have to know which|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: or pd pls bid something I have enough=X|pg||
nt|athene: without any special agreements, most people play that double of any artificial bid shows that suit (e.g. doubling stayman)|pg||
nt|ady: double from south showing spades |pg||
nt|athene: the problem now is if north "raises" spades, he will wrongside it|pg||
nt|athene: that may very well be his concern here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: north asking about 1@s, if east can have 4card M|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise 2 or 3@S looks clearcut|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: only if GF with long @d 4M is possible|pg||
nt|ady: the hand belongs to n/s in spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 2@S looks more logic then imo|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 1@C - 1@S playing these methods is a bit like 1@C - 1@D playing Walsh; i.e. you might have a major but only with a really strong hand that is going to bid the major next, ...|pg||
nt|athene: forcing to game|pg||

nt|ady: why is it wrong sided    must eventually lose 2 diamonds and 2 clubs whoever plays spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and what about PASS?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H is 11+, 4@H just practical with 4-card supp|pg||

nt|brolucius: events.|pg||
nt|gracelin: there are behind with 32 boards to go.  Not a usual position at the QF (except in 2007)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Whether such international teams are good for the future of the game is a subject of some debate. Obviously good for certain players' bank balances.|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  Rob Helle is teh coinventor of teh system Muller de Wijs are playing|pg||
nt|athene: overcalls are 3 or 4 cards with a longer suit somewhere else|pg||

nt|gulyas: in the meantime, OR made 5@Cx on bd2, for another 14 to Ned, leading by 25, nice start|pg||
nt|hlortz: well being from US i am rooting for them but its a tough road|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like a normal 4@H hand -- should present no problems in bidding or play|pg||
nt|kit: amazingly enough, N-S stopped in 2@H in other room, so chance for big pickup for Italy|pg||
nt|kamyk: kiery ujawnione - mo¿na unikn¹æ rafy 3BA|pg||
nt|athene: i don't mean it necessarily will be better as the cards lie to have south play spades|pg||
nt|athene: but that is what north will be thinking|pg||
nt|athene: that is why he might be reluctant to bid spades himself|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  it puts pressure on opps and that's NS style|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I like Dbl a lot|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Johnny's favorite game try. Bid game and try to make it |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S is too unilateral|pg||
nt|tax456: 2sa è roba nuova|pg||
nt|cuan: 2NT by North not by west|pg||
nt|tax456: ahh|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT makes for NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes QF is their achilles heel - and remember they chose China as their opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@h = 4@h, 5+@d|pg||
nt|athene: so according to that scheme, lauria could have overcalled 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: or 1@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe, vulnerable, he thinks it's unduly risky|pg||
nt|athene: this looks like fairly old-fashioned precision club, so NS are just bidding naturally after the 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/USA%202/hurd-wooldridge.pdf|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: say LR or bad game raise, danger of getting to bad game|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: interesting point|pg||
nt|roswolf: any shape i assume?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: rusinow leads|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S   shows spade control?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which doesn't say a lot for their system, NS need to cah their 4 winners|pg||
nt|hlortz: the latest system of game tries is bid game and try to make... should fail here :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1@D was one of their transfer responses|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ie. last minute changes may be allowed for non bridge reasons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amazing   since they didn't pre-submit a convention card for this pairing|pg||
nt|brolucius: Presumably Dble was a transfer to hearts on the first round.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rhelle:  2@s = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2NT = short in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@S transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S transfer to 2NT apparantly|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20  north declined to balance|pg||
nt|ady: even with the balanced shape  3NT could have been in jeopardy on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: will start on @C and probably make 10|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi Bob|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi Bob|pg||
nt|athene: which otherwise you would want to do, with that hand, as a pre-emptive measure, surely?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  surprising that W passed|pg||
nt|jfeld:  wow.|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of intermediates in the south hand creates the game opportunity|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w may go to the stratosphere|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: quite possible that in the other room west opens a weak 2@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: good convention.|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a diamond guess to make 4@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@d = 2+ in third seat Vul, because they up the 1NT range to 14-15|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@H IF brave|pg||
nt|eggy:  I don't like pass apposite it though!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 1st double promised 5@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: The use of transfer bids is spreading. Over a double is a good time for them, also facing an overcall.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: dbl is stronger than 2@D (first dbl Madala)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@H by South would have shown spades, of course.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south can figure out north's distribution but maybe worried only one D stopper and the club finesse maybe wrong.|pg||
nt|roswolf: madala will bid on here but he might make a club slam try on the way|pg||
nt|brolucius: The effect of a really awful set, such as Italy has just endured, can be to introduce doubt into everything you do subsequently. Whether such general rules apply to the great ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italians, we wait to see. |pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting comment david|pg||
nt|gracelin: slam try? I thk south is thinking on to bid 3NT or pass 3C.|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   lost connection     not a clear cut game to bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely someone out of 3130 knows the link to the running scores?! I am asked for it.|pg||
nt|gracelin: in fact 5C also makes and south could move toward that, too.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this italian tem think differently|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: but lauria-versace seem to be very conservative with their weak twos, and weak jump bids in general|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's seems those Italians always have a right gadget to describe their hands perfectly.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if ducked to HQ, a club shift will beat it.  So declarer may decide to go up with HK and wor on spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Narkiewicz bardzo kaszle|pg||
nt|hlortz: is it totally clear to rise aC if decl leads it early?|pg||
nt|ady: 3 diamonds should be down 1   so not much in this hand |pg||
nt|warrens:  how can North not bid 3@S over 3@D?|pg||
nt|athene: i think there might well have been a subtle misunderstanding here for NS|pg||
nt|eggy:  opposite|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with three small @H, what does pd have|pg||
nt|fluffy: Cullin didn't want to bid spades once Hurd show them before (or perhaps he couldn't as it might be taken as cuebid)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: on the SW side W didnt alert the DBL in the first round until a little|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: later|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and then S had allready put down the 1@s bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: obviously a heart lead sets the 9th trick for declarer, but other leads seem to just slow the inevitable|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but after the alert from W -- S took it back -- and shows @s now instead|pg||
nt|brolucius:  Bermuda Bowl running scores: http://goo.gl/26o6o|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: good lead, @h ruff coming up|pg||
pc|h4|nt|boedhy:  So he knowes the system like nobody alse oh offcourse WEISMULLER themselver.|pg||
nt|lechcold: na 3BAxx atak poszed³ w kiera...nie powinni siê nasi pomyliæ |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 30 trump break complicates the slam   but  you have to be there|pg||

nt|rhelle: so 3-3-2-5 hands, 12-13, become unbiddable if 1@d shows 3+|pg||
nt|xenya: duly corrected  - 2@D on 2+ diamonds would be too much, even for these days... |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: welcome Rob|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  990?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Agree with Jack. Automatic 4@S bid. with 3 low hearts and qjx for partner|pg||
nt|jfeld:  yep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H= 2 keycards without trump Q|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he make this after @C lead?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rhelle:  3@c = relay|pg||

nt|boedhy:  WIESMULLER = Tarzan that is what they called their system|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Now North knows the @c losers will go on the @s AK|pg||

nt|fabsayc: now they can manage two heart ruffs if they diagnose the layout|pg||
nt|fluffy: thx Jan this might be an UI thing declarer|pg||
nt|fluffy: sadly for wooldridge he has run from a making doubled game|pg||
nt|barnets: X|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rhelle:  so he will get excited!|pg||
nt|kit: And in fact, N-S have profitable save in 5@C, and pushing opponents to 5@H (which likely would have happened) is a big bonus|pg||
nt|athene: slam might be harder to reach if west opened 2@S - what do you do with that north hand? just punt 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, no need to pre-empt opps if they don't bid slams even when given a free run|pg||
nt|athene: really you should not miss this slam|pg||
nt|athene: if you play a strong club and opps politely yield you the floor|pg||
nt|psyck:  Declarer can make if he readds card right|pg||
nt|psyck:  could have also made on @d lead if he guesses right as defense cannot get @d ruff & @c trick|pg||
nt|psyck:  as dec can afford a @c loser if he reads @s, he should avoid the finesse here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: So many plusses in bidding.|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry not|pg||
nt|fluffy: with a spade lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: ducked|pg||
nt|fluffy: it goes down|pg||
nt|xenya: unmakeable on a non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bertheau-cullin  and  nystrom-upmark have had recent successes in ACBL national pair events|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: lall wants to play everything natural after 2@s showing 4@s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg:  1NT was raptor showing 4@s and a 5 card minor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 5@C XC was a beauty play by Drijver in OR b2|pg||
nt|fluffy: Drijver- Brink playing only 3@s on board 3, this means at least 10 IMPs for Italy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: GM Rob.|pg||
nt|eggy:  well, when your only values are QJx @S you don't even need to check you heart holding surely|pg||
nt|szalay: nice lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fredin dbld 3@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably still gets this right based on Fallenius DBL of 1@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: instable; see http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, take your pick from those while I watch the bridge!|pg||

nt|hlortz: well done|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Iceland must watch out, they are quite safe but losing 25-x they might be out|pg||
nt|jfeld:  When in doubt, bidding 4S over 4H is a good policy.|pg||
nt|ady: unblock of clubs here|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump lead may floor this|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W asking the bid of 2@C...|pg||
nt|roswolf: west considrong rdbling for blood!?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes he is... and asking again |pg||
nt|barnets: I think a heart lead might work ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: might end up shedding his own though|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rhelle:  4@c = relay, asking for controls|pg||
nt|boedhy:  still needs the third round @H control|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@d = 2 controls; an ace or 2 kings|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can he ask for it?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, and he will|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@h = relay, asking for high cards|pg||
nt|ady: 7 easy    8th have to work for|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has too much work|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 17 3nt by W made 11 tricks on the@HQ lead! 11 imps to the azurri|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bobh1: winning this match might help Poland get back in the hunt|pg||
nt|xenya: not much for the play here -- 3@D just making|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3NT makes too, of course. But hard to bid, as both players have a shaky @c stop|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Live scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|fluffy: excellent double by Per-Ola anyway, you are much more comfortable defending 4@d|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: grue saying: 'the King is my play (also)' |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lall: 'I know it's Peter's play'|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rhelle:  5@c = @dK, @hK, nothing in @c|pg||
nt|famus: and likely to meet the Italian juggernaut--which met their 'David" in New Zealand yesterday|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi I am back - and as u see 3Nt in OR down 4 board 2|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rhelle:  5@d = asking for more high cards|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@s = DQ, not @hQ|pg||
nt|boedhy:  On the last board at the other table Verhees van Prooyen were in the better 3nt contract, which on the layout is cold..|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so a good start for teh home team.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so really, NS are unlucky that South's red Q is in @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  otherwise they'd bid 7@d|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south would have been better to raise clubs right away|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Doesn't look likely.|pg||
nt|ady: careful defence will beat 3NT  2 hearts 1 club and 2 other aces|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer must guess trumps to make|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like east needs score his @C3  to make this|pg||
nt|barnets: otherwise cant|pg||
nt|barnets: close contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: may cash club and try diamond to the 10|pg||
nt|kamyk: Twoje ulubione silne 2BA te¿ czasem zawiedzie:)|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer could make now 11 tricks for +150, but that is still not much|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: entries mean he is likely to make it on the lucky heart diivision|pg||
nt|warrens:  I can see how N/S might stop in 2@H if S doesn't make a second try|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: VC: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qphase=QF&qroundno=1&qtournid=886|pg||

nt|boedhy:  still think a lot of pairs will end up in 7 @d tho and i dont see a way to make it|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@h I don't understand - that is a sign-off|pg||
nt|rhelle:  in my version - clearly they play this differently|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3 boards total 35 imps is a rocket start|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: not with S imo|pg||
nt|athene: south thinks that his free 2@S bid showed a really good hand |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rhelle:  I guess that they could sign off in 5@d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  taht should be possible...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and 5@h is the relay, and 5NT shows the @dQ and denies the @hQ|pg||
nt|ady: that will bring 8 tricks  unless 6 card spade suit out|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: dont think so Barnet   favour diamond to the 10|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) Weak @D  b) STR|pg||
mb|1N!|an|9-11|nt|boedhy:  well done then anyway :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  NL is taking a bid lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: italians always seem to be there at the end|pg||
nt|bobh1: it seems declarer took an odd view in @Cs|pg||
nt|fluffy: thats a bit light for a non precision opener|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS on for 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I totally agree with this call.  South knows his side has at least 8 clubs and E-W have at least 8 hearts, so odds in favor of competing to 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: south should force this to slam i think|pg||
nt|athene: AJ10xx is a lot better than just 5 hcp|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1@S Narkiewicz?|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie s¹dzê|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W apologized|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D best|pg||
nt|roswolf: misere view|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I present West won't be silenced easily|pg||
nt|athene: if i bid 3nt first time we might miss 6@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=RELAY, 15+ HCP|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as we can see NS open on playing strength rather than points|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: not vul should balance|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S alerted his 2@s bid - guess it show exactly 3@s and 8-10hcp|pg||
nt|ady: though 6@C also ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@D usually unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: *predict*|pg||
nt|xenya: EW NV, so W will feel free to bid as many spades as he wishes|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, thanks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@D is a real suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=max, weak 2@D, 0/1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  bidding 3nt is really strange....|pg||
nt|gracelin: Madala-Bocchi use trsf response to 1C opening|pg||
nt|famus: I'm gettin msgs from involved kibtz--they got their money onn these boys winning--that b a gr8 morale booster for youngsters the world over|pg||
nt|kit: This is a bold bid at adverse vulnerability, but it is effective as it drives E-W too high|pg||
nt|lechcold: niestety w  2 Grzegorz przegra³ 3NT, które ju¿ móg³ zrealizowaæ:(|pg||
nt|psyck:  np Filipe, you got the important play right, was immaterial at end :)|pg||
nt|eggy:  not particularly safe - only 6 1/2 clear of 9th|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I like that kind of treatment, very popular in Europe not so much in US I understand|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if W splinters next, might get to 6|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but RKC should avoid that|pg||
nt|jfeld:  correct, I sometimes play 1@d promises a good 4 card or 5 card suit, a suit that you don't mind partner competing in.|pg||
nt|jfeld:  but not that common in the US|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Running scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=881 |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  is S thinking of acting?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Joel thinking how high to bid. I bet he bids|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no it is W thinking|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S has bid 3@h|pg||
nt|fluffy: Per-Ola decided not to double 1@c with his hand, perhaps for the vulnerability|pg||
nt|fluffy: wonder if he would had opened had east passed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: none of this has improved Fallenius' hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: ON  4 N/S PLAYING IN 3NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess 2C showed both majors.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will eiher bid 4H directly or X to invte.|pg||
nt|roswolf: o feel italy are steming over the horizon|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: will west try science or a simple 5@d?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: What a hand |pg||
nt|ady: hearts best spot for n/s|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@H down because of @S ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w may sac in @D|pg||
nt|xenya: 4N -- 2 suits|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good bid, 4NT.|pg||
nt|rhelle: Interesting 4@s bid from East. There is a school of thought (I adhere to it) that suggests to always raise your partner's preempt with 3-card support|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi CK|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ady: a quieter hand|pg||
nt|pawel90: NS maj¹ tu do wygrania nawet 5@H, ale obrona pikami jest dobra na kazdej wysokosci|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes @D the old joke what do u call an 8 card suit? trump!|pg||
nt|warrens:  an aggressive 5@C works.  Kit, you must love this :)|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult problem for Stansby, but he would have done a lot better doubling and collecting 500|pg||
nt|ady: defence can take spade and spade ruff   but nothing else|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes they may phantom|pg||
nt|roswolf: THE VUL MAY TEMPT THEM|pg||
nt|ady: 3 losers in diamonds  so can sacrifice at the 6 level|pg||
nt|oosmanb: into writing in all caps? :)|pg||
nt|xenya: even with a doubleton honour i would say...|pg||
nt|xenya: well, occasionally perhaps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@D/@H both make on @H finesse, may be difficult to bid.|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes. In this case, without the 4@s bid, South would have 2 rounds of bidding more, and could show his @s void|pg||
nt|rhelle: in the meantime North is regretting opening on an 11-count 4333 :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: a hand that Vul I'd never open|pg||
nt|xenya: he will be happy he did eventually|pg||
nt|fluffy: otherwise the hand owuld be headed for all pass!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: not a successful lead     heart works out better|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting as well what 4NT actually means in this situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi Krishna|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  North feels he is too weak to handle 1NT X|pg||
nt|kit: And here it pushed opponents to poor game|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S play 15+ - 18 for 1NT, so North was a shade light for that opening bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "good dummy" says Einarsson after W put down his cards - I agree :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and W layed down his @sK as it was just a small @s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in between|pg||
nt|jaapfr: some will bid as W|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can save for around  eight or eleven hundred|pg||
nt|famus: how much is 6@s costing|pg||
nt|xenya: N has a choice of bids -- 5@C/@D/@H|pg||
nt|athene: interesting use of double - few pairs play this way|pg||
nt|ady: not wild about east overcall of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: east may go for the spade lead on this bidding?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: dbl usually shows 4@s, but can be done on less, like on this hand. 1@s would show 5@s|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  operator adds 2 bids at the time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: exactly|pg||
nt|fluffy: everything is lieing well enough for EW, and 11 tricks are possible on a spade guess|pg||
nt|fluffy: but soth's silence makes it unlikelly for declarer to paly him for this strong spade holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  4  Pachtmann didn't bid with Fleisher hand|pg||
nt|ady: 22 pts game    but suitable values|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room long tank by north over whether to leave in the X of 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 20-20 split here|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@c is 10-15, with some poetic license 3rd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: silence|pg||
nt|roswolf: no caps lock on the blink:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so the players cannot know who is thinking from the operator|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H by W was an option but took the low road|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so the players cant here on the mouseclick is who hesitating or not|pg||
nt|jfeld:  surprising Einarsson did not want to look for slam with controls in the other suits and a good source of tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I prefer to not be in slam missing A + trump Q|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  unless I have 10 trumps - then you can actually show trump Q in RKC Blackwood without having it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: th concept of maximum and minimum weak two bids depend where you live|pg||
nt|szalay: its originally a Dutch convention|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and position of the moon|pg||
nt|szalay: backfired now as well|pg||
nt|jillan:  AND who is playing them|pg||
nt|szalay: because of gave 2 much information|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: The defence had to stay away from both pointed suits here (@s & @d) which wasn't an easy task for them|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's just hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|rhelle: although South is not allowed to draw this inference, he knows that North has a long think over 4NT|pg||
nt|athene: if west's redouble of the negative double would have shown a heart honour, then east knows the hearts probably won't get the job done|pg||
nt|brolucius: Diamond bidding may have helped South to judge that North would not have much wasted in diamonds. No, he has passed 3@H. |pg||
nt|barnets: china got to 3@H freely on 19 on spade lead so italy should pick up 4 imps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: Aust allowed to make that 4@S for an early 12 imp lead|pg||
nt|antoniz: ciekawa rozgrywka|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie trafi³ po prostu po³o¿enia króla pik|pg||
nt|antoniz: 4pik by³o za 300|pg||
nt|psyck:  whatever it was, it worked|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will sac on insurance principles?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: how bad is 6@H without looking at ew cards i.e @S distribution|pg||
nt|bobh1: W will lead a @S but E will not know why|pg||
nt|ady: even without a spade lead   only can make 11 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: East probably doubled|pg||
nt|bobh1: is it because he has a singleton or because of the rdbl|pg||
nt|nkgupt: golden cards and layout|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: this may well fail|pg||
nt|psyck:  W did not want to bid his poor @s suit i presume|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not surprised if the director was called at the end of this board|pg||
nt|xenya: normal treatment|pg||
nt|ady: good lead    without the 10@D 3NT could just be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|athene: going for diamonds is not a bad shot|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't understand the Q from W here|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @D8 was better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D  4th suit force|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will grue split his honors when fallenius leads up a @d?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C as weak two in diamonds or strong hand was invented by ira rubin and played by him in 1966 world championship|pg||
nt|ahollan1: win 1st @S often highlights fear of shift to another suit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: So another 10 IMP's for Italy|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But given 3@S was a singleton, really shouldnt venture 6|pg||
nt|jfeld:  agree, not a great slam here.|pg||
nt|fluffy: if Hurd manages to ruff 3 diamonds in dummy he won't need to guess teh spades|pg||
nt|fluffy: but I think he doesn't have enough entries for that|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh well south has to lead first! and spade lead is appealing|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rhelle:  South is now advertising a rally big hand - and North will bid 3NT|pg||
nt|boedhy:  bidding 3NT yourself much safer|pg||
nt|rhelle:  9 tricks are of course easy once the @cQ drops|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so the NS aggressive auction looks like paying off|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well it is sort of lucky offcourse on a @s lead you need that|pg||
nt|antoniz: 5karo mo¿na wygraæ,ale 4pik zawsze -1|pg||
nt|jkotor: znaczy jak w koñcu S otworzy kiera, co jest raczej oczywiste|pg||
nt|ady: now 13 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: good sac|pg||
nt|bobh1: he will work it out because of the auction|pg||
nt|xenya: and this makes -- somewhat fortituously|pg||
nt|rhelle: Now, how should East signal? He 'knows' the @sAce will be ruffed|pg||
nt|xenya: you normally don't bid a slam missing an ace and the trump King|pg||
nt|fluffy: there you go, now he will make if he plays trumps before north ruffs a spade|pg||
nt|fluffy: if he plays a diamond, he will later need to play @cA+@c to avoid the ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess that means 3@C would show  5413 distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: otherwise it seems to me more important to tell about @C filler|pg||
nt|ady: surprised    |pg||
nt|gracelin: he made a discipline pass.  He let north decide how many D honors are wasted.|pg||

nt|psyck: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/USA%202/zagorin-bathurst.pdf|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 2 grue-lall beat 4@H, they are saying declarer misplayed it, i am not so sure|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: Some players would not have bid 3@C, vulnerable, worried that partner might have only 3 clubs. But you can see that making that pre-emptive bid has pushed E/W around.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is likely to have 1 honor for the bidding, if it's a @h this is a good contract.  The @sk dooms it.|pg||
nt|kit: Still likely 1 loser in each suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually it has value|pg||
nt|lechcold: bêd¹ punkty w 19, nasi nie poszli w obronê pikami|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm slighty unexpectedly a vul game swing opportunity for the chinese|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's double was a game invitation and he stodd by North's decision. 3@H by South would not have been invitational.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Gerben42:  a practical lead - looking for the 2nd trick assuming @HA is the first|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: not easy to defend here?|pg||
nt|szalay: NOW he will split for sure|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and 109xx of @d helps bogtime with that lead|pg||
nt|idc: Hard ask for East to lead a trump from a singleton at trick one, but a @c lead would have given declarer more problems|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: @cAQ throw a @s on @cJ|pg||
nt|ady: heart shift now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sweet choice for Poles|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i think i would do so too at the table|pg||
nt|oosmanb: excellent save|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: Need both king and 10 of spades onside|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S easy making, so looks like a +board for Sweden|pg||
nt|psyck:  also may have been worried of 3@s being passed if pd was weaker|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  claim +1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now it is really difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but very understandable that Kamil was worried about leading toward @HT9xx|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: long haul to 4th spade    meantime club switch best|pg||
nt|ady: then still 3 losers|pg||
nt|athene: well, the queen would be right if his partner had @DKxxx|pg||
nt|warrens:  only right if partner has led from AKxx|pg||
nt|athene: leton|pg||
pc|d7|nt|boedhy:  bigtime|pg||
nt|warrens:  and declarer has 10x|pg||
nt|fluffy: notice the important @s8 unblock from hand, this might probe vital in the end when he fineses south for the 9|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: but still N would make 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: giving declarer @DA10 doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: 9@D better  first trick from west  but then declarer would then play the clubs safely so west could not get on trick|pg||
nt|xenya: neither N nor S have any idea of W's club holding|pg||
nt|gracelin: closed room is unlikely to bid this game either.  North is not strong enough for the 14-16 1NT so will open 1D, showing 11-13 if balanced.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: so 8 tricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  or Kxxx|pg||
nt|eggy:  certainly poor after North's double I think|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Gerben42:  +2 even|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarers failure to play on diamonds indicates he has at most one card in suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this line screams singleton @D|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rhelle:  another claim - 10 tricks|pg||
nt|pawel90: jakby Piotr zagrywa³ atuta ze sto³u unikna³by promocji. Tak -2|pg||
nt|ady: as mentioned North might have had A10 dbleton|pg||

pc|d5|pc|c3|nt|resurectin:  Hi all|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|barnets: had west held only 3 clubs 6@C would be cold on @s finesse|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|antoniz: po piku,partner wyrzuci Waleta karo- to nakaz w kiera|pg||

nt|fluffy: 3-1|pg||
nt|fluffy: he can play for clubs 3-1 and spades 3-3|pg||
nt|fluffy: ruffing diamond in dummy a heart in hand, a diamond in dummy and pulling trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hlortz: needs to find Sj t.o dbl gives clue|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@S=@C & @D   if he's good enough for that|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@D at least three diamonds and 11-21 points.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|boedhy:  And teh Netherlands are among the topfavorites especially on home turf|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@c will be lead directing|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is very high up on Roland Wald's list of the world's 10 worst conventions too.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Roland agrees.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It has always staggered me that so many very good players use it.|pg||
nt|kit: big advantage of Flannery is that you don't have to respond 1@S to 1@H on a 4-bagger, so opener knows it shows 5.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, it will be 12-14|pg||
nt|gracelin: There is an excellent interview to Bocchi on the net.  I just don't know how to copy to long address to present to you.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@s asks for minor|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3@d shows more d@s than @cs|pg||
nt|ady: games|pg||
nt|ady: but the majors only can make 7 tricks on the lay|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  bd 1 might have worked out differently on another lead, then 4 and this thin slam "missed"|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  many pairs play 2@C as a gadget here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I guess 2@c is Gazzilli like|pg||
nt|fluffy: he actually combined both chances sorry|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, north could have stronger trumps and weaker spade so there's no trump finesse to take.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer might have made last hand by ruffing a diamond when in dummy|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rhelle:  well ... I think Italy is very strong, especially in the absence of the alltime strong USA teams|pg||
nt|brolucius: Roland thinks the convention is so totally awful that he forbids commentators to use the F-word. (I will let your one aberration go unreported on this ocasion, Kit.)|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for 3NT e/w|pg||
nt|idc: The 3@c is minimum & without 4 card @d|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Some won't with 4 cards in the other major, some won't with a void, some will with one of those flaws but not both.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = good 12 to 15|pg||
nt|roswolf: well not with the 1NT overcall i think - but what do i know?:)|pg||
nt|ady: board 4 was in fact a push   also 3NT n/s    and thankfully for Italy not 3@DX|pg||
nt|fabsayc: instead of playing a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 5@H now by west|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 7@d X par |pg||
mb|5H|nt|lechcold: WE graj¹ Precison|pg||
nt|idc: a 3@d response to 2NT would have been 4 diamonds, min or max|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very costly for Australia|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some back here I expect|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a razorblade sharp 4@S needs @C lead to beat?|pg||
nt|ady: no   strong club |pg||
nt|ady: minors have 10 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@D shows three diamonds only with 4-4-3-2 shape.|pg||
nt|barnets: on 19 remarkeably e/w switched after spade lad and allowed dec 11 tricks when he only had 8|pg||
nt|psyck: 7@d may save an imp i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  South X of 5@c is interesting|pg||
nt|kit: Well, if I get fired it won't be the first time in my life :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: The x took no room, 4@c might have given e a problem --  although not in this case.|pg||
nt|daman:  http://neapolitanclub.altervista.org/eng/and-now-lets-talk-about-bridge-interview-to-norberto-bocchi.html|pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks, George.  You helped me out|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1@D nic o karach nie mówi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H denies 4-fit   not sure if they ever superaccept w/3-fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you did it al, jinked the cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guilty|pg||
nt|psyck: would you consider 4@h instead of 4@d by E Martin?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now i would definitely bid slam with bathurst hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well 4@H is fine if a fit jump, i dont play them|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, by passed hand, not much else it can be...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i play it as a splinter|pg||
nt|psyck: ok|pg||
mb|6S|nt|boedhy:  yes probably has a specific meaning..|pg||
nt|rhelle:  showing the desire to compete|pg||
nt|famus: at worst wud b a 5IMP swing--dunno|pg||
nt|kit: tempting to bid game with 3 aces, even though only 12 points and 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  some have names of players like Gazzilli, there's also Bart and Lisa convention :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  and now he has done his part and passes|pg||
nt|ady: might make 12 tricks as they lay|pg||
nt|ady: might make only 9 if spade is ducked early by defence|pg||
nt|ady: when hearts split well will have 9 tricks and be relucant ti risk diamond finesse|pg||
nt|idc: as has been pointed out to me, a good thing E-W missed their @s fit|pg||
nt|hlortz: fredin will NOT go down this time :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt : 4@Hs + 5 toptrricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: i predict...|pg||
nt|rhelle: so West's game try is aggressive|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: looks like it works now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and in scandinavia I have heard about "Hexan"|pg||
nt|fluffy: wooldridge not excited about the game try in clubs :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: his @sKQ are more useful than he thinks, still 3@h will have a lot of trouble to make|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "Sorry for what I am about to show" says Wooldridge before putting his cards on the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  4  Levin-Weinstein stop in 5@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5D has chance but maybe difficult to handle.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  NS need to cash their 3 tricks in a hurry|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but looking at the hands....|pg||
nt|daman:  my oleasure     a great interview|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3@d = more @ds than @cs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the problem here was the wide range 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: needs to win in east hand to make 12|pg||
nt|barnets: we can see that but he is trying to guarantee just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: on this lead|pg||
nt|barnets: there is no absolute guarantee I can see|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: take the A , play @D and then take safety play perhaps for 9|pg||
nt|barnets: when he loses the lead the def shift to a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: attitude lead|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder if any Multi 2@d users will play 6@h by West and suffer a ruff at trick one|pg||
nt|idc: or perhaps East passes in some matches and West becomes declarer that way|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H lead|pg||
nt|ady: ?|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  otherway up|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S may make if they let him get the 4th @D to discard a @C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes so no @C lead for declarer|pg||
nt|gulyas: @DQ lead looks normal, then game is cold|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1@S forcing 1n 2nd neg like 0-5 i think|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll pass non-vul|pg||
nt|pelu: no bet from me :)|pg||
nt|ady: 100 to poland   rather than a dodgy 130 bidding on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead and off.|pg||
nt|ady: this looks destined to be 1 down|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: down if @D played|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: back live again|pg||
nt|ady: but now on that lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: now made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with NS never bidding   i think that is very lucky result for LW|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but i expect the italians to be there anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: akurat w przypadku otwarcie 1@D nazwa "Precision" nie jest zbyt trafna:)|pg||
nt|idc: after a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|ady: yes     that is true|pg||
nt|gulyas: here she comes|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has plenty of problems in 3@H here.  Play at trick 1 itself is far from clear.|pg||
nt|kit: Due to the entry situation he will probably play hearts leading them twice from dummy, which is not a success on this layout.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well done|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: lucky guys, yes|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3D should be easy enough, maybe club to Q and H finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: where we saw 5@CX down 1 e/w Italy in 4@SX on 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|d7|nt|boedhy:  5! is cold|pg||
nt|kit: Good judgment by all to reach par here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no disrespect, but predictions involving fredin are precarious|pg||
nt|pelu: DD 6@C can make, but "impossible" to bid - and against all odds|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right, Martin, but when he see 9 "sure" tricks in 3NT - |pg||
nt|fabsayc: we see 9, he does not|pg||
nt|pelu: he hasa to be carefull in start - if @Ss 5-2|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure he "see" 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 off|pg||
nt|fluffy: with a club lead perhaps he would stand a chance, now he doesn't have enough entries to try double finese in hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: this match is on a knife-edge|pg||
nt|gracelin: undo|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: West does not want to play a second top spade here.|pg||
nt|hlortz: might w dbl 3@S with the intent to pull @c to @D?|pg||
nt|kit: He will use this entry to make a spade play I'm pretty sure.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if north has 5 spades there is no 100% line, but on hand just playing hearts will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: you have not lost connection - it is Cullin doing some thinking |pg||
nt|xenya: now, that was an imaginative lead by N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: amazing @S stop|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer must have ruffed|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the @s8 will be lavinthal for @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  South can see he needs 2 @d tricks to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so he needs the @dK in North|pg||
nt|rhelle:  might as well play the @dJ now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Fredin says "ill be very surprised if i get down on this one"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: in fact needed a club lead|pg||
nt|ady: unless going wrong with spades|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: They show standard count on king lead 5-level or higher contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will have given count.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and make 10|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: better than the arvitrary 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 3 pades, 3 hearts and @CA for the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fallenius taking the ace very fast|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Fredin: never see him take a card that fast :)|pg||
mc|12|nt|gulyas: it maybe tricky if they play a @C back|pg||
nt|ady: good lead     may be able to force and entry to west hand in diamonds for a heart finesse |pg||
nt|psyck:  I don't think S had a further bid on 2N|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 1 out of 100 will find he deadly @C lead imo|pg||
nt|gulyas: after the @DQ lead, he would play for the likely @DJ onside|pg||
nt|ady: long diamond can be set up before club is established for defence|pg||
nt|famus: that was odd|pg||
nt|ady: did not see the lay  but cant see how only  6 tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on 21   2@D-end   so i think sweden takes the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: the table is discussing whether bidding 7@d is good or not|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they agree that it is interesting at matchpoints|pg||

nt|ady: how many hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: Traian, from Australia  has always been very good on sessions that I have watched.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Next to me is an operator from Denmark, doing Rama|pg||
nt|roswolf: only the 8 david|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S seems obvious|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6S will be difficult to bid after the preempt|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  and then finding out he makes the contract|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 13 back looks like a match of big swings|pg||
nt|xenya: another slam for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C is excellent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 46 imps in 5 boards   buckle up  it could be rocky set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3352 has option of opening 1@C or 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C includes 20-21 Bal|pg||
mb|1C|an|2+|nt|boedhy:  think this last one will loose|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2h is supposedly 10-12, multi for weaker hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@h = 6@hs 10-12 hcp|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another interesting board. 6@C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gulyas: I can see the cards, too:) - but he may play for the @HA onside on, say, a trump lead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: upgrade looks right|pg||
mb|d|an|4+!s|nt|kit: Weinstein evaluates his hand too strong for 1NT opening due to good 5-card club suit and 2 aces.|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H call shows 5 spades, 4 hearts, invite values if I remember|pg||
nt|brolucius: The US South did enter on the @CK-Q-J-x-x-x hand and they then pushed E/W to 5@S for a 13-IMP swing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lost connection, up to speed now|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 4H with the right guess of S, but they lack the points to go that high|pg||
nt|lechcold: to nie bêdzie prze³omowe rozdanie chyba..|pg||

nt|ady: 4@S a save for n/s|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: interesting fight here this board|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@S from west, 3@H from north, and south will bid 4@S on the basis of the sixth spade|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so will end up in 3@H now|pg||
nt|fluffy: You're back jan?|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is board 23|pg||

nt|barnets: e/w can make 3N here|pg||
mb|2D!|an|good 2!h bid|nt|boedhy:  against 5@s doubled|pg||
nt|pelu: can make - but not bid 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so you were right Martin :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and this has stolen the board|pg||
nt|gulyas: SD, not DD|pg||
nt|ady: likely heart game    12 tricks maybe without diamond lead|pg||
nt|pelu: some would bid 2@S in W - but Es sk still stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: or 6 possibly|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 2nt showing a good heart raise; same thing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fleisher could have transferred over DBL  but anemic 4@H wasn't attractive|pg||
nt|xenya: will he act now? and if yes, how?|pg||
mb|p|an|no 3!ss mostly|nt|rhelle:  Normall NS play 1NT as a good 12-15|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but 3rd and 4th hand, vulnerable, they play 14-15|pg||
nt|rhelle:  to avoid unwelcome penalty doubles|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have the cc on my second computer|pg||
nt|kit: N-S in other room did well to stop in 2@S making|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@S 4@H 4@S and ???|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@d is normally weak but can be strong|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@h looks like strong|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c might be like viking club 5-7 balanced=|pg||
mb|2S|an|gametry|nt|gracelin: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he should raise, if only to block minor rebids|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay of diamond pips   |pg||
nt|bobh1: not on best defense|pg||
nt|xenya: but finding a 4-4 minor-suit fit is always a problem|pg||
nt|xenya: i can't see him sell out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  6    2N-3@C[puppet stayman]//3@D-PASS   what a creative auction from Bobby Levin|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  with all the good tens and the @h king onsite he will make 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|jkotor: na 5@c co trzeba trafiæ|pg||
nt|famus: did*|pg||
nt|kit: Nice 2NT call by Martel -- that is a fine contract|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like to open the field for opp to bid - so 2@S from W from me every time (and pd know that its a weak support)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C good bid, showing the side suit to help partner judge over 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: west might hope for 2 trumps tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: S 6@S but very weak|pg||
nt|athene: and indeed that would give west the information to double|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S seems much too heavy|pg||
nt|brolucius: East was nowhere NEAR a raise of 4@S, so West had to do more (not that it was really possible) to get there.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|brolucius: Many thanks to our excellent VG operator for the bidding explanations. Roland told us that the operators have been practising for a while and they have certainly been very good.|pg||
nt|kit: Routine 4@S contract, will easily make 10 or 11 tricks, and almost sure to be same at other table.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so you are cheating|pg||
nt|psyck:  this could make a couple of o/t's or u/t's|pg||
nt|ady: 6 as A@H   and a trump trick to lose|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D is not the worst contract ever but doomed here|pg||
nt|ady: has|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, not inconceivable that NS will end up in 6@h - which is unfortunate due to the @h break|pg||
nt|athene: since he has a misfit in the minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: @D lead again:)|pg||
nt|ady: diamond bid by Sementa stopped any chance of 12 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@H NF |pg||
nt|gulyas: sry for those who do not know the terms yet: SD: single dummy (like a declarer at the table)|pg||
nt|pawel90: po pikowym trzeba dojæ od razu impasem kier do stolu|pg||
nt|kit: 3@D will make also|pg||
nt|ady: really to much to bid more than 4@S   and east has little reason to proceed|pg||
nt|gracelin: agere, but that's what a preempt is for.  4S not enough, but 5S maybe dangerous.|pg||
nt|psyck: with flat hand & already having shown a good raise, W will reject the 2@s game try|pg||
mb|3H|nt|oosmanb: 5@d looks like limit to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: S will realive with 4@S|pg||
nt|jfeld:  East has a lot of playing strength, but not many controls. well judged|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hope we get an explanation of the 2@C alert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks :)|pg||
nt|szalay: 800|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one benefit of rolling 20-21 BAL into 2@C is that it is possible to play 2@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so a partial pick up by USA1|pg||
nt|gulyas: DD: double dummy, seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|famus: good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes 110 for east west is the correct score|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks if defence cash 3 clubs   otherwise 11|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this is plenty high enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  Well 5@h also played in the other room..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just following the guidelines for commentators :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and that great :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it is not always easy to see what the players are writing to eachother on their small pieces of pater|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: paper |pg||
nt|xenya: are they on a relay route -- seems like it |pg||
nt|xenya: that might help|pg||
nt|rhelle: from (sometimes bitter) eperience, these relay sequences can be tricky - especially with distributions that occur infrequently|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry for disconnection...|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing missed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no, tx|pg||
nt|rhelle: although the explanation isn't quite what South has got, it did locate the @c fit|pg||
nt|xenya: so N knows S's shape -- should be 6 clubs now?|pg||
nt|athene: combination of sixth spade and the diamond strength...looks like 4@S to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I could just see the notes Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good eyes|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: or 2@C was @C + @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could have been @C and another   if Barel hadn't bid 2@S we'd know for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pachtmann did bid over the DBL   so playing 3@H north|pg||
nt|pelu: against best defense down 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ecatsbridge.com has cc for all participants|pg||
nt|ady: not much in this hand    maybe an imp|pg||
nt|idc: 2NT was a game-forcing hand with some @d support, 3@h we can only guess at|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@s will pose no difficulty for Weinstein|pg||
nt|hlortz: difficult hands with big swings at stake - fun for the kibs, onot so much for the players|pg||
nt|xenya: so EW had a smooth ride to 2@S here, and S, knowing about a fit in a red suit, reasonablt decided not to compete at the 3 level|pg||
nt|pelu: but dificilt to find|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: will they stop?|pg||
nt|barnets: thsi is a good shift by south|pg||
nt|barnets: will hold dec to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: continuing hearts would have brought same result|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lian thinking......|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lechcold: 4@S = minimum-minimorum, 5@C = 1 as z 5|pg||
nt|barnets: good lead|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks to our Operator, Paul, now we know 3@h showed a singleton|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: if it was only for not to fool us:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zack working thru transportation issues before playing to trick 1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rhelle: once your partners opens, you find the fit, you're unlikely to stop under slam with the N hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: true patrick but i confess i would have punted 6@S|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ok we are up after some difficulties|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: now it should be ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thx to my new glasses :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: commentators have to be careful not to get carried away with DD analysis: players can only see 2 hands, not 4|pg||
nt|xenya: N setting trumps, S cuebids @Ds..., |pg||
nt|fluffy: oh upmark bid 3@h instead of 3@d what a waste of space|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has communication in diamond suit|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rhelle: now South will bid 5@c, I guess. It's hard to be too enthousiastic with no aces|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphznt: well, south knows 4@s will probably 2 off, since partner is a passed hand |pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: I am still getting kibitzers querying that it was right to enter with 3@C over 2@C on that South hand. Everyone knows that they should interfere over a strong 1@C, but it is just ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: as effective over 2@C, when the opponents are almost certain to have a game and will want to show their long suit rather than double you.|pg||
nt|ady: well cashed|pg||
nt|psyck:  he may have placed E with a balanced hand on the lead|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: sssssss|pg||
nt|ady: meant in game|pg||
nt|roswolf: sensible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: board 6 levin did in fact bid 4@H as a fit jump by passed hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rhelle: well bid!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wd.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: there is a losing line right now|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Is s leading from jxxx or axxx?|pg||
nt|kit: Bocchi has easy jack of hearts shift|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and since North bid 3@h south might think 4@h is not always making|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz2:  Neither is high on the list of preferable opening leads.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb these 2 teams can be the ultimate finalists of the BB:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@S indicated duplication|pg||
nt|ady: 13 imps to Italy on the 3NT that should have been10 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: S's hand is limited to 15/16 perhaps, so N can't conceivably bid grand here|pg||
nt|rhelle: I have to go - playing myself in 45 mins. Bye everyone, enjoy the bridge!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: may get a @H lead which would be natural looking for ruff. If @Hs are 5/3.|pg||
nt|jfeld:  with 3-3 trumps declarer should not have any problems.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kareno: So the curious raise to 3@s led to a reasonable but doomed contract.|pg||
nt|hlortz: call me chicken no aces no kings no singletons 3 trump only - i'd be more scared of partner than opps |pg||
nt|hlortz: ;0|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@d is stablishing fit in spades I think|pg||
nt|psyck: Netherland found the MP sac of 7@d against 6@s for an imp|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gracelin: it's all down the guessing S9 for either 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: and north says something like I don't ahve keycards|pg||
nt|fluffy: whatever all of this was, tehy did an excellent job avoiding the dangerous 5 level|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Sr but I cant read all of the notes given by Cullin to Wooldridge -- but have filled in the once I could read :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: this appears headed -1 even if @d's not attacked by defense|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: but with no cover would be anti-percentage|pg||
nt|xenya: if S had @DA instead of KQ, 7@C wouldn't be all that stupid -- depends on 3-2 @C and 4-2 @H -- but i'm not sure it's with the odds|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gracelin: SJ|pg||
nt|antoniz: zagra³ perfekcyjnie|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kareno: The play I would make in spades would be the ten.  Then you can pick up any Qx or Qxx in south (opener's) hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: Why not?|pg||
nt|athene: lauria thinking about south's distribution|pg||
nt|athene: he has only five clubs|pg||
nt|fluffy: safety play in spades is cashing @sA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|santyclz: In a lower level game it's frequently even more useful as the opps may have agreements to handle the situation.|pg||
nt|fluffy: to avoid losing to a singleton honnor offside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: down 1 or  overtrick on guess here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S10 is very important card|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: some luck here  with clubs 5-2 east cannot overruff 6 and 7 of diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: well played and defended 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fluffy: and to draw as many trumps as you can before losing the lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense here has been accurate enough|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|twcho: 7 imps for USA1|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, this is THE match to watch now, these teams currently ranked 1st and 2nd|pg||
pc|dK|nt|boedhy:  still 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @SQ promoted|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|fabsayc: but there is a pseudo squeeze|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D=not 5@H/@S   2@H=4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 2@H=4@S and NOT 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: par is 5@HX -1|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kit: South could have a doubleton spade and a 6-count it would seem.  Unless these bids don't mean what they look like.|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@h is practically laydown while 6@s relies on 3-2 spades pretty well.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, indeed.  A good stop, probably enough for them to ake the lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: take|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think li should have mentioned his hearts before raising clubs|pg||
nt|famus: ok so 3NT was @s cue|pg||
nt|garden2005: i dwa kiery|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Thanks Jordan, so basically Italy would normally get to choose who is in their bracket,  but here there are 2 US teams so they must be in the same half.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  about this auction: I find that doubling a splinter with the suit is not that useful|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I play it as lead-directing for the higher remaining suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  in this case @H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it is E thinking if anyone should ask :)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  So most likely Italy and Netherlands will play in the semi's unless one of them loses in the quarters.|pg||

nt|ady: thats the best part of 3NT  difficult no to give something on lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might have held only 3 clubs in a weak 1NT, so East has done well to bid 5@C. He will surely be happy when there is no double.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: looks like 4@S down 1 or 2 = 5-6 IMP for Italy|pg||
nt|ady: diuble of 3@H game try    3@S  would be competitive|pg||
nt|oosmanb: interesting auction|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: red lead give red score here|pg||
nt|ady: but wrongsided   now likely to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wrong sided the contract here|pg||
nt|athene: not the best methods to bid 1@S with that east hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: we all agree including the kibs:)|pg||
nt|athene: you know partner will be bidding 1nt a lot and wrongsiding 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: don't think east should bid a systematical 1@s with balanced hands if NT should be played by him|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 2x:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: here some pairs play 2@d as 18-19 BAL or natural over transfers after 1@C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  no Italy and Neth. will play in the quarters unless one US team loses their QF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Inv+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=2/3@S, MAX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=a) 4@S 5@C, 1@H  b) 4441@H|pg||
nt|ady: not a bid deal  double    down 1|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: new zealand is the surprise of the tournament so far, they are leading usa2 by 35-10|pg||
nt|barnets: west played north for @DA as he is quite capable of having|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4@H X could be easily 2 down|pg||

nt|fluffy: whata nightmare to play something at trick 2 from hand|pg||
nt|ady: not that great Bob   K@H missing as well|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if one US team loses, Italy picks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the only time you can go past 2@D is with a strong hand i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3NT denies shortness|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: if south knows his partner's shape then 6@H looks clear, with the good suit texture, even not knowing of the @H10 opposite|pg||
nt|kareno: Still it is hard to posit such a perfect fit.|pg||
nt|athene: a pity - my guess is south found out distribution but didn't know he was facing so many prime cards|pg||
nt|kareno: I would guess Italy will find the slam in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: and he didn't have any way to make a mild slam try in hearts - if he had done so, north would surely have accepted|pg||
nt|barnets: a good pickup here for USA|pg||
nt|idc: Perhaps West could have tried 4@d instead, East cues 4@h, and they might stop in 5@c|pg||
nt|ady: well bid|pg||
nt|kit: Madala must have played ace of spades -- otherwise that doesn't make sense, and clear to play ace anyway|pg||

nt|boedhy:  for the runnning scores click on live scores bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|boedhy:  still think much more system default or bidding mistake from Gower that they were not bidding it|pg||
nt|boedhy:  But Muller wil be thinking about this...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  sure - but as South you're still kicking yourself|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only one in 7@d on the board... Chili against Italy bog lead for them also|pg||
nt|yke:  some players might just open 1NT. But maybe they play 13-15 NT since they play precision?|pg||
nt|famus: 4S not alerted looks like rkc?|pg||
nt|pelu: but 2@S making, so even down 2 could be a flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: just for comparison, in the USA2-Sweden match 68 imps have been exchanged over the first 7 boards|pg||
nt|xenya: 58 rather|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 1@C-1@H-2nt?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, lots of possibilities, but getting a strong balanced hand to play it is one of the most important goals|pg||
nt|ady: hand 22   4@S making here is flat   in spite of a diamond lead in OR     south switched to heart without cashing 2nd diamond|pg||
nt|ady: diamond switch now very good for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i think he will play @H9 or @H9 now:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: north trying to ask questions about 1NT, if it can be 4144 for example|pg||
nt|gracelin: when West can be expected to hold no more than 2H, He is sure to have 4+ of clubs.'|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that either North or South held an obvious double.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: 15+ - 18 1NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it was,|pg||
nt|nkgupt: will need to discard on second @d to make...apart from @h guess|pg||
nt|barnets: this is a great opportunity for Italy|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe 3 rounds daimonds beat this|pg||
nt|barnets: diamond and second diamond disc|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Gerben42:  5@S was "I have a problem in @D, bid 6 if you can solve it"|pg||
nt|eggy:  Are there still carry forwards from the round robin?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with @DA, W might have shown KC to have 7 as option|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Yes eggy|pg||
nt|xenya: not a single flat board so far|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, as Kit remarked, they have had to take a rather close view to reach game after their chosen start.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like 15+ to me.  Maybe a 5 card major is a barrier for them.|pg||
nt|gracelin: bad lucks for China that HK is not on side.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that is 71-0 after 11|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  carryover is decided by the RR match between the teams|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Ok. So I believe Italy will get to choose which one of Netherlands, USA 2 and Israel/USA 1 it wants to play.|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  22  where we saw 2@H+1  Upmark in 3N East|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: diamond lead will create problems with spades 4-2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in fact i dont see a way to make the hand|pg||
nt|idc: mind you, i've been in many, many worse slams than this one on a finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and 5@H 2 and queen of hearts|pg||
nt|ady: slam easier to get to via strong club|pg||
nt|bobh1: transportation issues|pg||
nt|ady: even gteat club play of the Queen   pickint up 3 club tricks may not be enough|pg||
nt|ady: great|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @C98 are mighty here|pg||
nt|ady: can still make 3 club tricks playing the queen   but difficult line |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  either + 1/2 the IMPs of the RR if the team that won the match was ranked higher, or -1/3 the IMPs if the team that won the match was ranked lower|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: so that unbid heart suit was the only making slam|pg||
nt|kit: well, maybe he didn't -- but it does seem clear play|pg||
nt|pelu: board 23 where some of us would bid 2@S i W -  Weinstein also Pass, and the NS won the contract in 3@C - making|pg||
nt|bobh1: S's last bid was close but I can see why he raised|pg||
nt|bobh1: at imps anyway|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: @s 9 next|pg||
nt|ady: I doubt east will fall for that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads are 4th or 2nd from bad holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're right Vlad   just over 8 imps per board so far|pg||

mc|9|nt|boedhy:  on board 6 I was right lot of peaple in 5@s even 4@s doubled...|pg||
nt|yke:  for me it is a 1NT opening. But that's just a matter of style|pg||
nt|gracelin: good play on route to 9 tricks.  Declarer can later duck a round of D, draw top trumps and pitch dummy's D on good H, then ruff a D.|pg||
nt|pelu: even with @HK onside there are hard work to make 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: same play if Hearts are 3-3, declarer can pitch one D on H to lose only 1S, 1D and 1C|pg||
nt|pelu: and 12 opp 11 - and bad @C-value is not game potentional in green|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer in 2S here needs to find way to encounter a possible 4-1 trumps break, thus the huddle.|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: play was very fast there after the @c lead :)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  unless both USA teams win, then its choice is nullified if Italy chose to play a US team|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: if it goes just something like 1@S 2@H [gf] 2@S 3@H, then north might find a 4@D cue or something to show a good hand for hearts |pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  North has a monster hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Italians can win imps either by overbidding or underbidding.  You have to admire their judgment.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is why when you are in 2s you draw trumps and claim 3, so you dont do something stupid on the important boards|pg||
nt|ady: nothing nuch on here|pg||
nt|idc: So we have taken just 55 mins to play half the boards at this table, plenty of time left|pg||
nt|jaapfr: open room time problems are expected (only 3,5 boards played in 50 minutes)|pg||
nt|psyck:  they also play kickback, so 4@d would have been KC|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  exactly|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  except that 4th place isnt decided yet :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lost opportunity for a write-up :(|pg||

mb|4D!|an|!h|nt|athene: some would overcall 1nt here, but pass looks fine with that shape|pg||
nt|athene: west may double 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and indeed Prooyen Verhees also bid it and even made a uptrick|pg||
nt|brolucius: The KR evaluator program seems to take a bizarre valuation of jacks. Roland quoted an example where Q-J doubleton was allocated only 0.75 points, compared with x-x. Seems much too ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: little for me.|pg||
nt|athene: wait till they bid hearts, then double for takeout :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D shows H, as before|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I doubt Campos, Villas-Boa have ever gotten a slow play warning, much less a penalty!|pg||
nt|hlortz: usa2 started this match in 4th i think|pg||
nt|famus: :) i think they shud ALLOW it--bet- wud improve over all standard:)|pg||
nt|ady: thx for information kibs|pg||
nt|ady: 2 level high enough  |pg||
nt|ady: this hand going nowhere good|pg||
nt|athene: he certain will if it's non-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: he is in the "pre-balancing" position, to some extent|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "you played 1@c -- how did you bid that" :)|pg||
nt|eggy:  Then they may choose Israel, if they can as that is their best carry forward|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kareno: Their system got the bidding too elevated before south could describe his hand.|pg||
nt|antoniz: Walet kier by³ zlokalizowany,wiêc tylko 300|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup quiet hands now|pg||
nt|brolucius: We see again (from West) that the cue-bid is used to show a sound raise - such an important part of modern bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1@d = 0-8|pg||
nt|athene: that's the classic recipe for that south hand|pg||
nt|hedyg:  they started 10 minutes later|pg||
nt|famus: at present tying with Netherlands in 2nd spot|pg||
nt|oosmanb: thats a scary 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: in other words he doesn't want 2@D to get passed out and it might well be about to |pg||
nt|ady: dbl competive  showing a club suit and spade tolerance|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes this double is called "snapdragon"|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Correct.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  in the VC, France has done their job with 25 VP vs Trinidad, but can be caught by both Netherlands and Germany if they win their match big|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the dealer burned itself out with the grand slam|pg||
nt|ady: will this be 2@H X|pg||
nt|ady: no|pg||
nt|roswolf: the poles have no fear|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very light 1@D, 3rd seat.|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  Apteker was very happy to be in it and played very save..|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1@h = 19+|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = 6-8, balanced|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can they get 6@s in south....|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so any 4333 or 4432|pg||
nt|boedhy:  which is very good|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is the Vul for weak NT.  North is in the range but decisde not to open on 5-4 distribution.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h and 3@C sh make - but thats max|pg||
nt|gracelin: when north did not open weak NT or rebid NT, south knows north has an unbalanced hand and should have 5+ clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: China in 2@H in OR|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@D = kiery|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N|pg||
nt|twcho: The south player, Edgtton, is only 19 years old and is probably the youngest player in this event.|pg||
nt|athene: but it's just a takeout double really, no need for a special name, no matter how pretty|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rhelle:  2@h = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@c = 4333 with a 4-card minor|pg||

nt|ady: very sketch 4@H     4@S   cheap|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS can make 4H barring a club lead and duck.  But likely EW will buy the hand in spade.|pg||
nt|gracelin: If East should accept will just the extra spade, then West should not invite.  Partnership problem.|pg||
nt|gracelin: with|pg||
nt|brolucius: Invite is OK, acceptance was more borderline.|pg||
nt|ady: cannot avoid 5 losers   so might not have been cheap if doubled|pg||
nt|gracelin: a popular method is to bid 2NT to show a good raise and leave room for manuver.  or to double then going back to 3S.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: now versace runs to hearts and north doubles |pg||
nt|athene: but south won't (shouldn't) stick this, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: cue 2@H, check for 44 spades, bid 3nt otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: even though it's nice to go for penalties at this vulnerability, you know opps surely have an 8-card fit|pg||
nt|athene: so defending at the 1-level might well be wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd think not.  His pass of 1@d doubled was likely influenced by the vulnerability.  As it is north was on the thin side of the double and might have eschewed the double of 1@h ...|pg||
nt|kareno: with such thin hearts.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is not making|pg||
nt|pelu: some work for 9 tricks here, |pg||
nt|gracelin: and as usual, Bocchi judged correct;y to stop in 3C|pg||

nt|jfeld:  Yes very surprising how close it is|pg||
nt|jfeld:  in the Venice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N forcing|pg||
nt|gracelin: the direct 3H bid forces partner to either pass or bid game.  East think I have a full overcall and an extra spade.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: take your aces boys and gain an imp|pg||

nt|santyclz: Changing the 10,8 to the q,j on the hand above yields 17.5 points, still low but more reasonable.|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Weinstein didn't even search for a 5-3 spade fit.  He judged that with 3-3 in hearts and clubs it was very unlikely that spades would take 2 more tricks than notrump, ...|pg||
nt|kit: which would be needed for 4@S to significantly gain over 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point.|pg||
nt|yke:  3NT is questionable to me. with a 5-3 fit you should play in spades when the long spades is the weak hand and in NT when the long spades is the strong hand|pg||
nt|yke:  because you might not be able to enjoy the long spades because of the entries|pg||
nt|kit: with AQx of clubs, there is no entry problem to the long spades|pg||
nt|yke:  good point|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Einarsson had a lot of water and now he goes to the toilet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Amazing!  @ss are only 4-1 not 5-0.|pg||
nt|twcho: a trump lead will probably set the contract|pg||
nt|psyck:  KC is key card & kickback is bidding the suit above agreed suit as roman keycard blackwood...just don't ask me any more :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  this looks like a normal puppet stayman sequence|pg||
nt|ady: 7 tricks looks ok    need an 8th from somewhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fallenius could have tried 3rd seat 2@D as weak 2@H/@S opener|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: At matchpoints there would be more incentive to look for a 5-3 spade fit, since making 1 extra trick in spades is worth something.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: after laying down his cards|pg||
nt|psyck:  not so normal rather|pg||
nt|psyck:  3@d likely denying 4 or 5 card major|pg||
nt|psyck:  & 3@s puppet back to 3N maybe|pg||
nt|athene: a very good example here of how bad it is to hold three small in RHO's suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yet another contract that won't make|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rhelle:  ah! a variation :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s is a strong 1-suiter, |pg||
nt|gracelin: even with this lead, if declarer is to ruff spade, he might lose a 2nd trump trick.|pg||
nt|pelu: some cross-ruffing af 9 tricks now - even play for 10|pg||
nt|gracelin: so likely there are still 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: def have no tricks|pg||
nt|ady: the lay out is friendlt|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 clubs one spade|pg||
nt|barnets: one heart or 1 diamond should make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re:)|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D is a close call 5 to 7 tricks for S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: with @D 3-1 this cant make on any defence|pg||
nt|athene: south's @Sxxx is a "death holding"|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  btw there were years that those 3 teams were the 3 medalists *g|pg||
nt|jfeld:  all 3 of those teams were heavy favorites pre-touranment to qualify|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  one of them will be out|pg||
nt|xenya: normal 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: probably a quick 1 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no    it will be a slow down 1|pg||
nt|xenya: oh, W might lead a spade...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might  but i think @DQ |pg||
nt|xenya: if a spade lead, it will be slow for sure|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rhelle:  although why North wants to play a @s contract himself is a mystery to me|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well South africa has bid it and made it|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in other room|pg||
nt|xenya: i would never open as S 3rd in hand, no matter what|pg||
nt|eggy:  Indonesia were perhaps a surprise package, but they have been very consistent.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Vlad leads better than I do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college  systems were devised to have me on opening lead|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@c is a cue|pg||
nt|twcho: now declarer may succeed by ruffing three rounds of @s in dummy|pg||
nt|famus: -1|pg||
nt|athene: you frequently are going to lose the first three tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4-fit|pg||
nt|psyck: same defense after all...|pg||
nt|psyck: should not take long now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might play heart to ace now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|idc: With the preempt, declarer not likely to take 2 club finesses through South, and also likely to get trumps right|pg||

nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|athene: with the lead coming through partner's king or queen|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: not easy. 8 tricks there and work for the 9th.|pg||
nt|xenya: and, if i were told to open at gunpoint, it would be 1@H (prompted by a kibitzer)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would you take @S or @C finesse?|pg||
nt|gracelin: West has a 9-loser square hand.  probably 2S is enough, and that's what EW can make even if East has a 6-card suit with 10 nice pts.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|boedhy:  now...... sign of or low @d lead...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ai ... North may pass 4@s now|pg||
nt|lechcold: nietrafnie Grzegorz|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect declarer will play to ruff fourth spade if necessary|pg||
nt|jfeld:  easy to tab between all 3 events on Bridge Winners|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rhelle:  I still think North would have done better to keep relay'ing|pg||
nt|brolucius: West at the other table did try to cash two spades against 5@S doubled and allowed the game to be made. |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose one down against 4@S making in the other room|pg||
nt|kareno: That heart five in north could possibly have been promoted to a trick with persistence in diamonds after cashing clubs.  The play is complex|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: very quick @H9|pg||
nt|athene: he is thinking that if he doesn't overtake this and cash the @DK for a spade pitch, the defence can draw trumps and cash two spades|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case the nine was a poor choice because it opens him to the promotion.|pg||
nt|athene: but the trick comes back for the defence with a trump promotion in diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, he is always losing out one way or another - even if he didn't waste the nine, the defence can prevail|pg||
nt|athene: for example on a diamond if he can ruff high north can pitch a club and get a club ruff with the @H5|pg||
nt|idc: West won't be expecting a doubleton heart on his left, which might be the surprise that dooms this contract|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Particularly when s shows up with @h length.|pg||
nt|kit: Not much can happen here -- 5 unavoidable losers.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo @S better.|pg||

nt|barnets: and enjoy the long cards|pg||
nt|barnets: eg playing@SA spade dec can make|pg||
nt|barnets: by setting up daimonds|pg||
nt|barnets: so the def wont do that|pg||
nt|barnets: were south to play a trump west plays the king and north will duck it|pg||
nt|barnets: on a heart back dec needs 6 trump tricks to go with his 4 side winners|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rhelle:  but, let's be honest, it's a marginal slam. Around 50%, so staying out of it is no shame|pg||
nt|pelu: @C9 8 7 6 are strong ruffs|pg||
nt|gracelin: east has doubled 1C, so he doesn't have a singleton HK.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now ruffing finesse in spade is the safe route|pg||
nt|gracelin: if instead, going to dummy with HQ and play another trump, West can win CK and play D to force declare losing control.|pg||
nt|barnets: with 4 tens and 3 nines though :)|pg||
nt|barnets: very nice intermediate spot cards|pg||

pc|h8|nt|kit: I think his 2@D call is right.  Will be much better if Lall is distributional, and 3NT figures to be thin at best with at most 25 HCP and usually less -- possibly a lot less.|pg||

nt|ady: this is the fastest gamed I have seen for a long time   10th hand in around 45 minutes|pg||
nt|athene: the double of 1nt here is takeout of diamonds, of course|pg||
nt|athene: so south passes just with a good diamond stack|pg||
nt|ady: even then hard to stop 2 club ruffs    so 7 trump tricks and 3 hearts|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 1@D opener for me, as in closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT is just marked as strong raise on the cards, but must be GF or South would not have bid just 3@H. |pg||
nt|santyclz: One of the few hands where blackwood answers all your questions.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most players use it as game-forcing rather than 'limit or better'.|pg||
nt|kareno: If west leads that tempting diamond it is all over for south.|pg||
nt|athene: well 3nt hasn't got many tricks even if the @DQ isn't found|pg||
nt|kareno: Actually 3nt is doomed anyway but the diamond makes it quicker :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  the open room, which started 10 minutes later, in a vain hope of getting comparisions, as now 4 boards ahead|pg||
nt|psyck:  *are now|pg||
nt|xenya: strong 1@C and some effective obstruction by EW|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: the main clue being north will already have shown two aces|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  6@ss fails on a @c lead.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: system say 5 card major ask GF'|pg||
nt|kit: Good shift by Martel.  He can see that declarer, known to have a minor, needs to ruff clubs in dummy.|pg||
nt|jfeld:  I thought north might make a responsive double, but he would be poorly placed over south's frequent 4s bid|pg||
nt|eggy:  EW may not think -1 is so bad on this hand as 5 of either minor needs a ruff to be found|pg||
nt|jfeld:  at the other table, they were more conservative and only opened 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i typed that before the bid|pg||
nt|xenya: just like this, 4@H...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and was going to say  probably not 4@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  south difficult decision now|pg||
nt|rhelle:  he didn't seem to think it was that hard :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  first double?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  penalties, no doubt - 16+|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West did not alert 2@C, thinks natural|pg||
nt|boedhy:  second double still take out|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2nd is take-out|pg||
nt|idc: N-S play a (mostly) game-forcing 2/1|pg||
nt|idc: and no doubt the sequence to 3@h will be forcing|pg||
nt|idc: South has bid this as a minimum opener with little slam interest, so North may give up now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H?!|pg||
nt|pelu: I can see 6@S is on, but I dont exp NS to bid more that 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: and what if the answer showed @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: w'll hurry|pg||
nt|jfeld:  over the 2@S-3@H continuation, I think North has a clear double|pg||
nt|szalay: doubt he wd make it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont see any way to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: W has a tough lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: needs to avoid leading a @D to beat this|pg||
nt|hedyg:  might lead @s|pg||
nt|gulyas: that could work|pg||
nt|pelu: Kibs dont agree with me - they go for 6@s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north has a huge hand actually they will bid slam|pg||
nt|hlortz: martel is pushing w/ north hand opposite 2n jump and @S support|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S now from south surely|pg||
nt|athene: well, he might bid only three, reasoning he has shown good values already|pg||
nt|athene: and his @DKJ likely wasted facing void|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead would mean a possible heart ruff   but then there would be 3 club ruffs for the same result|pg||
nt|athene: still he does have a seven-loser hand and he is vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he does know 5-4 fit, singelton can be good enough|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S solves matters|pg||
nt|ady: diamond switch best|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this has worked out well for Kamil as 1nt is best spot|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gracelin: 2D is a safer contract than 1NT which can be set with 3S, 3C and a H.  Bocchi made a great lead to pave the way for a successful defense.|pg||
nt|idc: Had South tried a courtesy cue bid of 4@d (as he might) then I think they would have gone on|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  After 2 boards with good chances for USA, one with a chance for Brasil.|pg||
nt|gulyas: anything but a @D really:)|pg||

nt|rhelle:  and if then NS play 3 rounds of trumps, the roof will come down|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this will be disaster for EW|pg||

nt|boedhy:  yes|pg||

nt|gracelin: admittedly, he has no good lead with his hand.  He'd rather attack dummy's suit than declarer's suit.|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: W pokazal 4333 10-13|pg||
nt|kit: seems like declarer might have been better off setting up a sure spade trick.|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree with wexcellent trump support and singleton club  full value for raise to game|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks easy seeing all the cards but to declarer? fatigue at this stage of the match does funny things|pg||
nt|barnets: Duboin playing in 4@S as I explained not drawing any trumps |pg||
nt|barnets: and and x ruffing|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lian and Bocchi nearly sleeping....|pg||
pc|s2|nt|boedhy:  now he will try to ruff a @d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so close to 6 tricks...|pg||
nt|kit: If Weinstein chooses to lead from a king he will lead clubs, since no double of 5@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: What a waste of a hand, a good relay pair could use 11 rounds of bidding to get to the same contract.|pg||
nt|kit: But the passive lead reasonable, and now declarer takes them all|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he allows Bocchi to have led from K10x.  He must have seen it before.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer can duck this as well and defenders still need to defend carefull to ge all their trics.|pg||
nt|famus: wht a lead Bocchi made--amazing|pg||
nt|antoniz: wietne zagranie|pg||

nt|barnets: yes|pg||

nt|ady: fortunate lay of clubs    should be 9 tricks      south knows whwere every card is so not too difficult|pg||
nt|roswolf: the clubs are favorable this should make|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and now unbeatable|pg||
nt|ady: now likely 11 tricks   ruff finesse a club|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: forget typing errors : same meaning|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|idc: though as I said, it is borderline: a @c lead might doom it on a different layout, or hearts both wrong, or @s suit not coming in|pg||
nt|hlortz: well bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: has not made it yet|pg||
nt|psyck:  ok, still enough time...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: this lead will allow him to avoid trying for early club ruff|pg||

nt|xenya: maybe down 2 now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|famus: oops sry|pg||
nt|nkgupt: nice def creating a trump guess for declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: has east read the trump situation?|pg||
nt|barnets: so on 25 Duboin made 4@S|pg||

nt|ady: low club now    |pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: ok so as suggested, in the other room the tricky slam was found|pg||
nt|kareno: I use 2@c for strong hands and after intervention, I play that double by the direct hand shows extreme weakness.  That would have worked well in this case.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bebechira:  Lall saying : i am back in :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the problem with 4@D on such a good suit is that it bypasses 3N|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: true, but with 2-1 in the majors it could work out very well competitively|pg||
nt|rv: what do these guys play 3n opening, some play 3n as pre-empt in 4 level minor and 4m as Namyats|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS   3N=Gambling   EW play Namyats|pg||
nt|kit: 3rd/5th leads, so if low from dummy, Levin could duck|pg||
nt|rv: this should go atleast 1 off, possibly 2 down|pg||
nt|szalay: I think to play 3N as 4-level pre isnt a good idea|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: Kantar agrees Gyorgy|pg||
nt|szalay: to DBL for 3N or 4-of-minor aren't same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kantar 3N = strong 4@H/@S opener|pg||
nt|szalay: I played tabletennis in my childhood as well, probably this is the reason|pg||
nt|kit: it is a tradeoff -- you gain when you have the Namyats strong 4 of a major opening, you might lose when you have the 4 of a minor opening.|pg||
nt|szalay: what is more likely, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: I think the strong 4 of a major opening more likely -- how many 4 of a minor preempts do we see?|pg||
nt|kit: Also, playing 3NT as 4 of a minor preempt does have the gain of letting partner pass 3NT if he has the goods.|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|boedhy:  luckly easy 3nt..|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not a lot of losers for declarer -- but not enought winners|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: so 11 to 14 IMP on way for China|pg||
nt|pelu: no down 1: 2x@h and @Ss|pg||
pc|s2|nt|famus: may be--cant say till it ends|pg||
nt|gracelin: As north has not shown his 6th spade here, East may not find the killing defense.  However, without cashing SA, I thk 6C is still in trouble.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he has shown 6sp and 4H already|pg||
nt|pelu: will S pass to 4@s?|pg||
nt|gracelin: don;t thk North will ass, South has shown 8+|pg||
nt|ady: not enough entries to ruff 4 clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see how important the 4@C bid was set the slam ball rolling. If you could only bid 4@C with a club control, it would be a tricky time for North.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@D bit looks a bit odd here|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: aalthough i do not know the exact meaning|pg||
nt|athene: a bit of an overbid, but he was worried opps have a big spade fit (as they do)|pg||
nt|ady: 2 or 3 down|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe just trying to pre-empt to some extent|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i do not like in that position to preempt when i am so strong|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: The advantage of doing the tap-in commentary is that you have a split second to check whether your comment is completely stupid before you press enter.|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but then when you do say something stupid you look so bad :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Against that, some duff comment is preserved for posterity on the VuGraph web-sites. If you say something clueless, no-one records it and you can hope that the spectators thought ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: you were joking.  |pg||
nt|ady: no safety   3 hearts 1 spade and 1 club|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|boedhy:  still @h stop|pg||
nt|gracelin: pass|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by both teams :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on this board  after  1@C-P-1@H   Bobby Levin bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein raises to 4@H  Pachtmann 4@S|pg||
nt|pelu: prob down 2 - but 2@s making and also 3@S has a good chance|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rensph:  North might very well have bid 6NT after discovering @SA and the lack of a club stopper in partner's hand|pg||
nt|famus: he knows 11@s|pg||
nt|hlortz: but could be UNsafety play|pg||
nt|ady: if diamonds were 2-2   this might have gone down|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it might have|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has already shown a great hand with his high-level double. Not tempted to go any higher, quite rightly.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: ruffing 3 diamonds in runs risk of 10@H making for defence   I think small slam is enough|pg||
nt|kit: some suggest West should have doubled 4@S -- but the 4@H call might have been a lot weaker since it is preemptive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a roller coaster ride that was|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaapfr: what about N to X 2@C?|pg||
nt|ady: not now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wd|pg||
nt|xenya: auction looks very confident -- well done|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 4@H is no @S A, K, Q or AKQ|pg||
nt|ady: can get out for 2 down  defence should take 4 spades 1 heart and 1 club|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: "He writes books about bridge, he can't possible be that stupid..."|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein handled the spade suit quite effectively|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suit pref for impossible suit  used to say  entry in trump|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: come on  I want my cup of tea|pg||
pc|s7|nt|barnets: on this hand the @DKQ fall in 3 rounds|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec needs only ruff 2 diamnds|pg||
nt|barnets: but that is fortunate|pg||
nt|ady: but grand slam not good enough |pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's right.|pg||
nt|barnets: and the practical odds is close but maybe not enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OR    just don't break the other suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   China now trailing Italy by only 9   [actually 8.7]|pg||
pc|sK|nt|twcho: a tie bd|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gracelin: If D were 2-2, then he can establish dummy's club for spade discard.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphznt: claiming |pg||
nt|gracelin: only 10 tricks and 11 imps to China|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Just a short break here -- Li has to go somewhere else :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: smoker?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no I dont think so :)|pg||
nt|barnets: but north did not know that south was so minimum for his invite|pg||
nt|ady: thats true|pg||
nt|roswolf: 10 tricks for declarer here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphznt: 3 sp for you Bocchi says|pg||
nt|barnets: and maybe should have bid it anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's not a situation where you need to bid an against-the-odds contract because you are behind. All the VPs from all the round-robin matches are added, so you must play with the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: odds throughout.|pg||
nt|ady: taking long enough in 6@H     |pg||
nt|barnets: the grandslam was bid at both tables in the poland sweden match|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: nmot that it was a very useful piece of information for E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Netherlands leads Iceland by 94    USA1 over Israel by 73|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|famus: I wud've preferred a Hi @C and come back to fin|pg||
nt|ady: problem for declarer last hand was no entry if heplayed  top clubs and queen did not fall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least  not on my account |pg||
nt|xenya: despite all those swings, the current score in this set is exactly even: 32-32 |pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: good def here|pg||

pc|c4|nt|athene: i am surprised south didn't just continue hearts to force lauria|pg||
nt|ady: claim|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: In a club game, you would expect 60-70% for bidding a small slam.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|santyclz2:  N-s cards sitting nicely.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what would you do as N ? X or pass|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

mc|9|nt|barnets: open room are on their last board now|pg||
nt|ady: have been very slow at this table|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi must be thinking: 'Just as well I didn't bid the grand, if he is playing this slowly.'|pg||
nt|ady: thinking J9XX soades with east?|pg||
nt|ady: spades|pg||
nt|idc: Declarer was spared a @d guess by North's play of J, so hand will be over soon|pg||

mb|4H|mb|d|nt|kit: Or so I thought|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: maybe Levin expected helpful @S lead|pg||
nt|rv: poor game reached here|pg||
nt|kit: Admittedly he is a little unlucky much of his partner's values are in clubs|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rv: maybe Levin could have bid 2@s as game try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 12   Netherlands over Italy by 5|pg||
nt|rv: he possibly didn't want to give information to defense about his hand and chanced 4@h|pg||
nt|kit: He was hoping his partner had a singleton spade -- then maybe opponents would go to 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Game try wouldn't really give any information about his hand, since he can choose any game try he wants.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so there were a lot of ways 4@H could gain   Weinstein just had wrong hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Lall did well to avoid @S lead|pg||
nt|kit: Still, I think he should have bid 2@S.  If Weinstein totally rejects (and  Weinstein could come back with 3@C or 3@D if in-between), Levin won't want to be in game.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: Even if Lall doesn't find the diamond shift, declarer will still have to lose the fourth round of spades.|pg||
nt|szalay: small @D is the best turn now, I think|pg||
nt|kit: And I'm pretty sure he will find the diamond shift|pg||
nt|rv: apologies for repeating, all players are very tired (10th successive day) and it is showing in their bidding and play|pg||
nt|kit: Good point -- king of diamonds might look like singleton to partner.  On a small diamond, partner can't go wrong.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|szalay: and he could lead trump yet|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h3|pg||

nt|pelu: and here NS will hope for a win on this board - for sure not losing 11 IMP|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: talking about system|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might have led a singleton spade, so J-9-x-x with East was not so likely.|pg||

nt|hlortz: dull bring back the goulash hands :)|pg||
nt|ady: north opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South never counts tricks, he thought down 3, they said, same as Bocchi.. :) he said if you start dbling i will start paying attention|pg||

nt|ahollan1: same 1@D as earlier|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: 3@D better than double on that shape.|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed.|pg||
nt|idc: We heard a comment at the table earlier that 'spades are always 5-0', so I guess this 4-1 counts as a favourable break|pg||
nt|ady: maybe part score in diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: might go 5@CX-2|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: this 20-20 board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein also gives partner @C ruff to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if he hadn't done that   they would have beat 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently only 2 imps now|pg||
nt|barnets: time running out here for china|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm east warping a bit - no doubr feels the need to create a swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i double versace passed 1nt|pg||

nt|lechcold: szlemik w trefle teraz?|pg||

nt|barnets: and swing he will have if n/s pass|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|santyclz: So much for 3nt by n...|pg||
nt|kit: 4@C a little scary -- Weinstein thinks opponents might have a slam.|pg||
nt|pelu: but a problem for NS that they never found their 5-3 fit in @c|pg||
nt|lechcold: transfer na kolor wroga to Stayman|pg||
nt|ady: light opening from west|pg||
nt|hlortz: his was more tactical than technical imo he decided if he lost a @C right away def would be harder|pg||
nt|bobh1: can make a game|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: yes|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but of course  no reason to expect @SKJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is soooooo close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  can be 5/4 either way|pg||
nt|roswolf: the rabbits will run soon|pg||
nt|barnets: lucky 1n x|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: E explains: "Our drury style is very aggressive|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: but many would just bid 3nt rather than use stayman|pg||
nt|ady: that makes the diamond part score awkward for n/s|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Hopefully they get to finish|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the implication is 2@H is a junk raise|pg||

nt|ahollan1: systemically  1@D-1@H//2@H = 4-fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 5@D was a sensible option by North. Some would bid 5@C, claiming that they couldn't be any better for a passed hand. But South only made a simple overcall.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The VuGraph records are saved in various repositories (one is Nikos Sarantakos's VuGraph Project), so we can look up how other teams bid and made 7@H.|pg||

nt|jfeld:  Hurd elects not to compete|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: agree with all S passing?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 1@D-1@S//2@S can [rare] be 3-fit|pg||
nt|gracelin: so he can only return to 2S to show below 8, north will surely pass|pg||

nt|xenya: he might double now, with the idea of converting 2@H to 2@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: low scoring match and China leading so far.|pg||
nt|eggy:  I don't think that's particularly underbid it though|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 5 teams within 4.5 VPs|pg||
nt|brolucius: What would 2@H mean? Natural and fewer than 8?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: zero leads|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but it would need 5+ hearts.|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a swing likely but perhaps not to china|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: He could be a lot better as a passed hand.  Stiff in a major.  Queen of clubs someplace else.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|gracelin: All othe bids by south will show the strong hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is one disadvantage of the Gazzilli.|pg||
nt|gracelin: this time he has a very healthy 5-card suit.  North is worry south ma bid the same way with a much weak 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|kit: Martel knows declarer doesn't have A10x of hearts or first trick wouldn't have been ducked, so continuing hearts is safe.|pg||
nt|kit: And he had to lead low, since Stansby might have started with ace-doubleton.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not if you're this NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Ginossar tries 3N      Weinstein waits to see if that ends the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N it is  and quick @HK lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should mean USA1 plus in both rooms|pg||
nt|gracelin: in Gazzilli south needs to bid 2D with all 8+, a GF facing the strong hand (2C is 16+ or natural)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: no top losers here  but 6@S may prove difficult with 4-1 split   |pg||
nt|ritong: he briefly considered a @s J switch|pg||
nt|kit: no need for that, since if Stansby has king of spades the jack of spades shift can come later.|pg||

nt|ady: 2@CX may not make   but great against 620|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fluffy: my limited understanding of gazilli says that 2@c is either nat or 16-18, 2@d is 8+ any, and 2@s shows spades and clubs minimum|pg||
nt|gracelin: sout may pass 1NT with 12-13 pts in order not to be involved in the Gazzilli.  But with 14 he fears losing game if north has 10-11, even a passed hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south|pg||
nt|idc: Stansby declines the game-try but 4@c leaves North a different problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we should be back now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: there has been some technical problems in the open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N goes down a lot if Ginossar doesn't run @D before losing @S hook|pg||

nt|psyck: 3@d bid looks risky with E an unlimited hand, but once opps have found a fit, it is less riskier|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fluffy: the reason why south bid 2@c instead of passing 1NT is that he might be facing an 11 point balanced hand|pg||

pc|c3|nt|ady: that lead made it easier|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 10, instead 4@S Netherlands played 2@S and earned very important 9 imps.|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is quite annoying because S has to take @S finesse before cashing all diamond tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now defense can't go wrong   @SK doesn't offer useful discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're right Vlad -- entries to hand are gone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even in standard i like the grue sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3415 yes   not sure about 3451  that hand maybe rebids 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: 5 for Italy on hand 8   alout to play 3@C   against 5@C down 1  when Italy went to 4@H this table|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rensph:  N missed a chance to give partner 2 ruffs there, now it looks like 3@D is making|pg||
nt|hedyg:  surely a direct 3@d over 2@H would have been gf and this was a slight invite|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: SHI a bit SHY:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I have entered the results from this room now|pg||
nt|xenya: on a heart lead, yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done to cash out|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: second push in a row on 11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forget that  3415 = 2@D opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Martin is right|pg||
nt|pelu: so from -500 to +100|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is down more!?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fluffy: but normally 2@s is with 4 clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW play a very natural system and use standard sugnals|pg||
nt|gracelin: signals|pg||
nt|xenya: no longer, Rashed -- The Netherlands gained 9 imps on 10 when they stopped in 2@S and made 10|pg||
nt|gracelin: bith 2H and 2S show less than 8, but are natural.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno: I use two-way stayman and with game values, I do always check.  That my hand is balanced (4333) doesn't mean partner's is also the same, particularly with the modern tendency to ...|pg||
nt|kareno: open a lot of 5/4 hands 1nt.|pg||
nt|gracelin: so Italy maybe forging ahead after the disastrous set.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a big improvement on standard bidding in that area. All the more necessary when 2-over-1 systems widen the range for the 1NT response.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but even 2S is in jeopardy here.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1NT is best and if north had opened 1NT they would be there.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Without such as Gazzilli, you are more or less forced to open 1NT with 5-3-3-2 shape and a 5-card major. |pg||
nt|gracelin: while the China Open team won 50 imps last set, the Chinese Ladies team lost the same 50 mps to France.|pg||
nt|ady: could be a few imps for China here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oosmanb: but not straightfoward|pg||
nt|oosmanb: could perhaps insure contract by giving an open @S since he's missing entries to hand|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kareno: So the auction, say, 1nt - 2@d (gfs) - 2@s - 3@s offers a choice of contract.|pg||
nt|rensph:  declarer will have to choose between finessing in clubs or spades|pg||
nt|idc: I think I like the logic behind SOuth's lead: partner has short hearts so where are E-W tricks coming from except ruffs, so lead a trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now kamil cant both lead diamonds and hearts|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gracelin: Yes, if their north player does open 1NT at the other room.|pg||
nt|ady: so a mixed mood lunch time in Chinese camp|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, the guys are laughing and the girls are weeping.|pg||
nt|brolucius: They would not order 'number 50' on the Chinese menu.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: somewhat ironically|pg||
pc|s4|nt|boedhy:  this is close|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, one or two good decisions required|pg||
nt|boedhy:  needs to play @d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and as Muller is playing it will take some time|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then he will play @d offcourse|pg||
nt|rhelle:  indeed- if only to get information how to play @ss|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has nervous moments -- feels a lot better with king of hearts onside|pg||
nt|gracelin: after the HK lead, the H10 is irrevelent|pg||
nt|antoniz: chyba jednak 55|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and the same will be done in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so on track in a second -- I HOPE !!|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice invention/convention:)|pg||
nt|barnets: should have stayed in 1NX :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|barnets: that would have got a plus|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|rensph:  ...unless defense solves this problem for him|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: the D shift deceived declarer, playing D strength with E|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or, as Papi says:  "You need a reason *not* to lead trumps".|pg||
nt|idc: At the vulnerability East wanted to suggest a 5@c sac to his partner, hence the 4@c bid|pg||
nt|idc: If any blame is to be awarded, West's dbl perhaps deserves it (though -300 instead of -140 no disaster)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: that's possibly the first time in my life I've predicted Duboin's line of play|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps go down 1|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: thats a mistake by S - sh take @DA and play 3x@s|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1 imp if he makes 4|pg||
nt|ady: playing safe for 10    still 11|pg||
nt|gracelin: But we saw before that China Women can stage a strong comeback with enough hands.|pg||
nt|ady: hand 9 flat  4@S -2   200    similar auction  Sementa  declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: West has options to a) trf to @h and bid @cs or b) trf to @h and auto splinter in @cs|pg||

nt|athene: after 1@S - 1NT, how many clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: i bet he bids just two|pg||
nt|famus: in 6 i think he might well lead a @S|pg||
nt|psyck:  since 4@c often has other meanings, many would open 5@c here|pg||
nt|xenya: so Ginnosar in the other room decided not to take the @S hook, quietly going 1 off|pg||
nt|ady: yes   some might have gone down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@c = 11-15, 6+@c|pg||
nt|xenya: Ginossar rather|pg||
nt|gracelin: good hand for China as they open 15+ to 18 1NT.  Will East consider his hand 18+?|pg||
mb|1N!|an|14-16|nt|athene: NS do play 1@S - 2@D as hears|pg||
nt|rensph:  other table reached 3N and made it, so 7 imps to South Africa|pg||
nt|hlortz: that will beat it --i think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not stopping under 4@S now I think|pg||
nt|jfeld:  important to discuss your follow ups after your side makes a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|jfeld:  a simple agreement is that if the opponents run, the first double is takeout and subsequent doubles are penalty|pg||
nt|eggy:  Einarsson (holding my average rubber bridge hand) no doubt hoping that East doesn't get carried away with a good hand|pg||
nt|jfeld:  and that you are in a force through 2@D or 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Sweden vs. New Zeeland has played 8 boards so far|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they have 45 minutes left to play the last 8 boards|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Einarsson here, hoping to escape|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it is Wooldridge thinking here|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  south will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = relay|pg||
nt|athene: hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Two - no need to preempt with a solid opening bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: China has another chance here, 6S is cold|pg||
nt|fluffy: not your everyday vulnerable preempt|pg||
nt|fluffy: 6@s is far from cold requiers a good guess i ntrumps or in the minors|pg||
nt|gracelin: in Italy they say Vulnerability is for children and Bocchi is no children.|pg||
nt|fluffy: normally you should gues trumps, but you are not entry rich to dummy|pg||
nt|psyck:  they did have 4@c available after all|pg||
nt|psyck:  cc says " Wide ranging preempt"|pg||
nt|psyck:  I would expect W to pass|pg||
nt|psyck:  with @s's & @d's breaking, 4@s could make here|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks far too easy to predict 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: this looks a part score hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: no offense meant sorry SHI|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ lead    @D to Ace    @C finessed|pg||
mb|4D!|an|!h|nt|athene: but they won't use the bid with this hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  W bids 4@d before n can.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 1's to Aus with a flat inbetween each|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   have around 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|famus: probly xfer to NT|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks like the stopping place for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks  unless A@D les against spades|pg||
mb|d|nt|rhelle:  2NT = balanced|pg||
nt|kit: This is as flat a 4@H hand as you will find, it sppears.|pg||
nt|hlortz: and denies 4@S since o neg dbl perhaps|pg||
nt|eggy:  North will think there is a source of tricks now|pg||
nt|eggy:  or not!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very strange choice of lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a)  not leading major   b) leading from Jxxx  UGH|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it is really @d4..|pg||
nt|gracelin: he did. now China is going to bid to their H game and face the bad breaks.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i think so too|pg||
mb|4H|nt|idc: I once made a weak jump on 7 to AK in diamonds, quite proud of it until my '@h'Q turned out to be a missorted diamond|pg||
nt|idc: a weak jump on AKQxxxxx was consider over-sound by my peers|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  q10xxx in the midnight swiss...|pg||
nt|hlortz: /no/|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@d is precision style so can be few cards|pg||
nt|fluffy: to a minimum of 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul  1N=15-17|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may reach 4@H      not the easiest contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: aat least with the club opening he will guess clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Shi didnt dare to cue 4@d|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess Lian will move on|pg||
nt|pelu: but Lian still looking for slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he had taken a bid but took it back|pg||
nt|idc: and 'weak-jump' became my nickname for a while (till I did something even worse)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 6@d = 500|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this doesnt look right|pg||
nt|ady: cant get there now|pg||
nt|ady: may make 3@D |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W better bid @d|pg||
nt|fluffy: Cullin should normally bid 1NT 11-13 with this hand, probably he did and its wooldridge who i thinking about entering the bidding with 2@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not vul =14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  (no singleton or void)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  so Einarsson chose his "best" suit|pg||
nt|jfeld:  this could work out quite poorly|pg||
nt|eggy:  It could indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this is not for people with weak hearts |pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  6@S makes on the rather fortunate heart position here, but they'll likely end up in 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty harold|pg||
pc|d2|nt|boedhy:  2227 balanced tehese days :)|pg||
nt|athene: wow, only 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: i would want to bid a few more than that after partner doubles clubs for takeout|pg||
nt|idc: That's a good auction|pg||
nt|idc: Particularly by North, appreciating power of his shape after partner's negative dbl|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now what?  6 of a major looks likely  on the bidding (if not the hands).|pg||
nt|ady: south will have to find 3 discards on the clubs|pg||
nt|ady: best to take the 1st heart   but a difficult play|pg||
nt|famus: can see only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: oh my -- big chance for USA1 here|pg||
nt|kit: The North hand sure doesn't look like notrump to me.|pg||
nt|ritong: passing 3NT is a surprise, yes|pg||
nt|eggy:  Hurd knows spades are better|pg||
nt|eggy:  so takes the money (he hopes)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW vary their range   1/2/3nv = 14-16   3vul/4 = 15-17|pg||
nt|gracelin: if East had opened 1NT, West will surely pass in a makeable contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: they should punt the slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: too quick with pass me...|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 4@h must be shi|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: this should be down, even down two is possible|pg||
nt|kit: however, important for Martel not to squander 10 of hearts at trick 1!|pg||
nt|psyck:  gr8 guess by Joel, I have to admid i would not have found the 5@c bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: he might punt 7|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: missed a pass Karen|pg||
nt|kit: and ace asks for count or unblock I believe.  |pg||

nt|ady: and still 11|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well maybe south should go for 3nt then ?|pg||
nt|ady: Madal quiet on this hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|boedhy:  sort of wrongsided it now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could it be slam looking form south...|pg||
nt|kareno: I also play that double as takeout.  And they have a light opening style with the forcing club system.|pg||
nt|rensph:  wouldn't want to get anywhere near 6@S usually|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best now is spade shift|pg||
nt|kit: he got it right!|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C - 2@D - 2@H lloks like invit with 5-4 in major|pg||
nt|fabsayc: chasing the vulnerable game that does not exist|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2 MAJOR ACES TO LOSE -NEXT|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT opening with a singleton a bit more fashionable these days   I prefer not|pg||
nt|jfeld:  the only problem with passing is partner might be there to the rescue...|pg||
nt|jfeld:  but obviously that is unexpected|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W laughs when he saw the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and so did Hurd and Wooldridge|pg||
pc|h8|nt|santyclz: USA 1 took a big lead when China went down in 4@S rather than the 3nt on bd 25.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You remember the deal where Levin upgraded a 17-count to 18, reaching 3NT opposite 7? China played that deal in 4@S, on a 5-3 fit and went one down. So, Kit's advice on the deal, ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that West should not seek a 5-3 spade fit proved to be good advice.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if they are there, I am quite sure Shi will take 12 tricks.  He is the best player in the team and reach semi final in BB in 2009.|pg||
nt|idc: Stansby's dbl started as minimum but I guess even his hand feels a little improved on auction|pg||
nt|idc: the 6@d bid should warn declarer of bad breaks ahead|pg||
nt|idc: I admit I might be tempted to do less as South - perhaps dbl is a little pesimistic but a forcing pass of 6@d maybe best|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: how to play now? not over yet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  now is there some way to endplay w with the @h loser and force a @s lead?  I don't see one,  but that doesn't mean one doesn't exist.|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, I suspect this won't make - need a 12th trick from another @d ruff or a spade|pg||
nt|idc: and this attack on dummy's trumps probably too hard to handle|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Martel reading a book|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "Starbound " that is|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@C+1 likely|pg||
nt|eggy:  Not sure once you have decided to bid 3C that you should then bid again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good duck from Barel  holds declarer to 2@D tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: must be, but very strange, yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 aces  great intermediates  = 15 :)|pg||
nt|ady: bit top heavy   18 and 2 tens for 1NT opening|pg||
nt|barnets: well bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: at the match score and with all the controls angreat trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: no stays at 6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fluffy: if declarer missguesses trumps he will need to find @dQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: or squeeze south in the reds|pg||
nt|gracelin: not a difficult task|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S = 2Aces + @SQ - Lian exp @sAKQ :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: he even has time to establish a long Heart|pg||
nt|famus: natural for him to play !j--but if he opts to play a small @s--the play ends at trick 2|pg||
nt|famus: @sj|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the vugraph schedule so you can plan your days and weeks      http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|pelu: he know that N is short in @S, so he could play @S6|pg||
nt|famus: that wud end the thrill!!:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has so many entry to dummy, so I thk to take CA and play small spade to finesse S10 is the right play|pg||
nt|fluffy: Imaine for example playing a low spade and south ducking @sK9xx he might lock you in dummy with a heart and you have no way back to hand except destoying you chances of stablishing ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: @cQ|pg||
nt|pelu: this will be the 3. slam-swing in the match - the first 2 gave China 25 IMP and prob 12 more here|pg||
nt|gracelin: China should be proud of themself in outbidding the Italians in 3 slams in one set.  If Shi makes this.|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby will probably shift to club, although anything but king of hearts works fine now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: It is in fact Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: many play 1x - 1y - 1NT now 2@D = GF, 2!x realy to 2@d and direct major weak|pg||
nt|roswolf: if it is now working!!|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: good safe 3@C|pg||

nt|roswolf: the chinese fighting to the end|pg||

nt|barnets: playing diamonds for 1 loser|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pelu: but one of the slam only maded on a defensiv error|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes sorry:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this time he finds the 5 card major|pg||
nt|fluffy: wow that's a strong view from a passed hand!|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has described his hand accurately. If he rebid 3@H instead, West would not have much of a picture (were he to be stronger, with slam intentions).|pg||
nt|gracelin: they do open 1NT on 18, but the 3 10's swayed Shi to upgrade to 19.|pg||
nt|ady: in fact 3 tens|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C made it easier for West to respond on some weakish hand with a major suit.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: various ways to come to nine tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: take a ruffing finesse in spades is one|pg||
nt|ritong: despite the superfavorable @s layout|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 11, China played at 6@S making 7 and lost 11 imps.|pg||
mc|12|nt|boedhy:  offcourse it was 50% but south has a very strong hand imo|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi must be thinking harder than we do except he is not looking at all 4 hands.  I am sure the line he chooses is the best one.|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the page for the result fromthe 3 events     http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|famus: so the Chinese wud b the first to put a dent in this Italian Juggernaut--They've rolled over evry other opponent mercilessly, and i dare say artfully till now|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: actually this was the bidding :)|pg||
nt|idc: Auction entered is 4 passes and I doubt that really happened, just a typing glitch i expect|pg||

nt|famus: had he taken the first @H --had a possibilty in !endplaying S|pg||
nt|ady: was a difficult hand to make  |pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 1 suit,  @H/@S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rhelle:  so far NS have 12 plus scores - they will be happy|pg||

nt|ady: double fit in reds   4@H makes e/w|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: Sementa losts of clubs and spades again|pg||
nt|hedyg:  1@c= 2+|pg||
nt|pelu: but @H 10 9 make the hand better|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: safer|pg||
nt|ady: but 4@S cheap for n/s|pg||
mb|2N|nt|idc: Yes, Bd 11 still being played in other room, in 3NT by East (USA)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: that was 4117 almost same|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Raptor is only played in direct seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: East is unbalanced now he dbled|pg||
nt|ady: this time they do have a spade fit   but still might play more safely in clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see what happens with a quieter start|pg||
nt|psyck:  3@h fit jump|pg||
nt|ritong: hurd certainly would prefer chunkier suits|pg||
nt|ritong: but..|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H on heart queen being right|pg||
nt|ady: hand 27   China in 5@C X   need to play carefully to down 2   -300|pg||
nt|fluffy: when you go 3 down in a vulnerable slam and win 12 oh hell yo ufeel much better after checking scores!|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5D/5H also make|pg||
nt|ady: e/w will never be allowed to play 4@H   |pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: quel systeme !|pg||
nt|ritong: his action has the merit to place his hand immediately|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, should be better @h suit normally...|pg||
nt|ritong: he will not participate further if unsollicited|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play in game|pg||
nt|oosmanb: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this upgrade may get them to the good slam, 2@S followed by 4@C splinter|pg||
nt|twcho: I still can't understand why declarer take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: Meanwhile: New Zealand doing well against USA1 (23-7VP), Sweden-USA2 almost even, Singapore vs Australia -- same  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S a playable level.|pg||
nt|ady: hand 27 looks around 5 imps to Australia|pg||
nt|barnets: i think that was a tired play by east|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H is a much better shot|pg||
nt|barnets: not cashing the @DA first|pg||
nt|roswolf: but may have scored a goal|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some might be tempted to double this with north but he does not have that great a hand|pg||
nt|athene: you either need a shortage so you can get some ruffs|pg||
nt|pelu: just a X to help opponents :) - he has shown @h+@s why D - extra values?? NO|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we have 12 minutes left -- and still 2 boards left after this one|pg||
nt|fluffy: ok it seems 2@d shows a multi 1 major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue DBL would be takeout|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 2@S is invite for hearts or signoff for spades|pg||
nt|ady: yes  5 level also ok for e.w|pg||
pc|hT|nt|boedhy:  yes they will be pretty confident about there list|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only board 9 is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  It was bid and made at most tables|pg||
nt|athene: or you need such good trumps you just make them by force|pg||
nt|kareno: Nanev very close to a second double.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: I didn't know you were bi-lingual.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Because he was tricked by a 19 year old?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  after the accident on board 4 he is hesitant to bid 2@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C no chance|pg||
nt|ady: now Sementa has said it all|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Thundering here, South; I made a wrong bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: ciê¿ki rebid z rêk¹ E...|pg||
nt|antoniz: ³adna odzywka Piotra|pg||
nt|ritong: so we land in the 8 cards fit, relatively low level |pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry, 4@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: chances for -3 there in 5@C?|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@d is tell me your major|pg||
nt|fluffy: and 2NT can be whatever|pg||
nt|gracelin: West is inconsistent.  He bid 1NT intended to jump to 3 to show a limited raise.  But after 2S he just showed his D and concealed the  fit|pg||
nt|ady: some judgement required here both sides|pg||
nt|fabsayc: modern auction, not particularly succesful but a pass of 1@D might also be wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: E has a hand which he thought was too good for a 14-16 NT opener|pg||
pc|h2|nt|boedhy:  solid 3nt again|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention that 2@C on a passed hand should show a sound raise in partner's major was banned for years by the English Bridge Union.  They thought it allowed players to psyche ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in 3rd seat....|pg||
nt|kit: some might open the West hand 1NT and get to 3NT.  But they then might get a spade lead!|pg||
nt|athene: he really has not got that much defence|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case, north might sit.|pg||
nt|andyv:  for those who want to see the open room on livestream: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|ritong: looks healthy|pg||
nt|psyck:  this should also go down for a more or less push board|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT is apparently billed as natural on the China convention card. But that makes the rest of the auction a mystery for E/W.|pg||
nt|gracelin: sorry,  from the bidding it's obvious West's 1NT over the double already showed H fit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a sharp double here?|pg||
nt|gracelin: you cannot learn these stuff from their CC, only the bidding will tell the true story.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Their card says 'Redouble 0+ HCP, penalty seeking 1X-(DBL) - any = Nat,NF.'|pg||
nt|brolucius: 9+ not 0+|pg||
nt|ady: neither east nor west could hardly double 4@S with amy confidence|pg||
nt|brolucius: Super fit for both sides.|pg||
nt|gracelin: But if West figure East to be short in spade, he could try 5=level hoping to find partner with AK, A.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: This lead will not test declarer.  A heart lead might have.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is known as the Drury convention.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And when 2@C shows 3 card support and 2@d is used for 4 card support it's 2-way Drury.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has the chance to ditch a diamond on the 4th club, so long as the defenders do not set up a diamond early.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Taking a trump finesse might allow a damaging diamond switch.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is no doubt what he is thinking about.|pg||
nt|idc: The 3@d showed 18-19 balanced & heart suport|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 9 tricks either spades or clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg:  in 4@s you would have to ruff high and play the J@S to create an entry to dummy with the 10@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|ady: this looks tough to make|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they did well to stop there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some don't use that treatment Martin -- either @S or to play in a minor|pg||
nt|ady: quite lucky on the auction for e/w that 4 red trricks stand up in defence|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rensph:  only worry of declarer here is to avoid losing 2 spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: with the knowledge of south's 4-cad spade, declarer can take deep finesse there to get 4S, 1H, 2C and 2D.|pg||
nt|ady: Duboin in with his jack   but partner had shown a good hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i am afraid that even is not enough hedy|pg||
nt|roswolf: my link does work if you get NO SEVICE press F5 on your computer:)|pg||
nt|fluffy: but regardless of what it was Hurd is going to compete|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2nt shows 6+@d|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lechcold: na drugim stole pad³o 2@H i jest grane|pg||
nt|ritong: yes trumps are cruel|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: awful board to defend this 1@S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphznt: 5@h= 2 aces no @sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i see it is 14-16, so not an upgrade, and to me worth 4@D over 4@C since diamonds good for many discards|pg||
nt|hedyg:  extremely disciplined pass|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: instead of dbl direct 2@S is 6-4/5 less strong|pg||
nt|xenya: not an easy hand|pg||
nt|barnets: most matches decided now holland lead usa 1 women by 16 imps with 4 boards left|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: Weinstein worried about a club ruff, so may play two top spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 37 IMP for China on 3 slams !|pg||
nt|gracelin: as there are only 2 entries to dummy, he could cash SA first to see what's north singleton, when the S7 shown, he know to double hook S10 and SQ|pg||
nt|fokal: he can evan afford to cash the @s As|pg||
nt|famus: this shud b a swing back to Italy if @s dont go to deep fin|pg||
nt|fokal: *even|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  E-w appear to have 4 losers and stopped just in time.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  on the other hand he also knows that with double fit Duboin is big enough to bid 4@s if it is there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: claim|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i think he will just claim|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: a bit late with time|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes keep refreshing the website, it'll work |pg||
nt|gracelin: good judgment and get a bonus if south doubles|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|fluffy: in 4@s, 4 players made, 10 players went down|pg||
nt|fluffy: making 3NT is for sure a supperb score|pg||
nt|gracelin: the Italian declarer must be among the 4 that make|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer lacks the entries for finesse south for Q107x, so he must hope north hold one of the Q, 10, or 7.  So cas SA and take the double hook|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer can fleely cash @sA now right?|pg||
nt|famus: has to beware of entries to play @s twice- but also needs to check the hand---Declarer has his work cut out for him|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i pass 2@D to play in that minor :)|pg||
nt|ady: bad for Italy|pg||
nt|roswolf: might have more now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: If he plays trumps from the top and they break 3-2, he can set up the clubs, leeaving the master @SQ out. |pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed david|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: 2 imps to Italy|pg||

nt|fluffy: what is wooldridge-hurd's NT rang?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ginossar rebid 3@C   i like Kamil's choice more|pg||

nt|barnets: I am advised 29 with3 boards left|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see how hopeless it would have been for North to 'cover an honour with an honour'. |pg||
nt|santyclz: The bad news is the trump break.  The good news is that s didn't request a @d through.|pg||
nt|kamyk: pechowe rozdanie - N mia³ prawo liczyc na dubla karo u partnera|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed |pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobh1: i guess he knew|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: i even do not see DD how to beat 1@S|pg||
nt|fluffy: nice this explains why Hurd was not very optimistic on the bidding|pg||
nt|barnets: both USA womens teams were favoured to do well|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobh1: perhaps they were influenced by the need to do something|pg||
nt|fabsayc: laying down club king earlier would have simplified this defense|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: last chance for NS|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, nicely done, now two entries to dummy for the double finesse.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: was not clear though|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it was australia playing the 5@c, so 5 imps to china|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: Now diamond shift and he is down.|pg||
nt|kit: Problem was he couldn't go up ace of hearts due to no entry to the club.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South may hope that North started with @CKQJ.|pg||
nt|bobh1: to get back in the match|pg||
nt|ady: well 13 imps wasted|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bidding 6@C didnt seem to be in the picture for a long time during the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but no semis for them|pg||

nt|pelu: so far a lot of small swings for Sweden - better bidding in partscores = 22 IMP and 2 big swing 17 + 13 for USA|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@c strong as always, 2@h is just an agressive weak 2|pg||
mb|2D!|an|3!s 7-10|nt|rensph:  EW likely to end up in 4@S here|pg||

nt|fluffy: upmark as everytime you have lenght without honnors in opponent's suit has no clear bidding|pg||

nt|xenya: S happy to pass -- W now?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok is 7-10 raise|pg||
nt|psyck: BROMAD style bid i suppose|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lechcold: ojojoj|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt is no doubt a 4 card spade raise, alternative was some flower bid in hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: should i tell the players?|pg||
nt|pelu: @s @H squeeze against S|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks available here for e/w   can they do it again|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ill back them, moneys on slam|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 6@H    as can ruff out spade suit when 4-2|pg||
nt|oosmanb: haha for those watching Open room webcast|pg||
nt|roswolf: this slam is of rolanf proportions!:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Versace was toying with his final pass card over 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: i think thats how they do it|pg||
nt|barnets: to make sure 2 different countries are in the final|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: redouble is a better bid than a mere 2@h bid in OR|pg||
nt|psyck:  I would have expected a 1N opening by N here|pg||
nt|ritong: holding south hand, you know that this rates to be painful|pg||
nt|ritong: a strong NT, you mean?|pg||
nt|ritong: ow|pg||
nt|ritong: very painful, even|pg||
nt|psyck:  1N=(13)14-16 for them|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand  but easy for n/s to get overboard  after light take-out double by north|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: did not see gosney alert 2@h, but edggton did|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   did not see 1@S opening |pg||
nt|ady: not light double   sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are no books that tell you what to bid with East hand after partner shows @S and unknown minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or how to scientifically bid 8-card suits      but i digress|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: not sure about the meaning of double|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I could not see explanation, sorry|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H plays well here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they corrected to 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: ok back to earth now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: signalling he really doesnt want to pass|pg||
nt|ady: but a slam here may be flat|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but EW in 4@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: in 30|pg||
nt|xenya: the one thing you shouldn't do as S is bid 3N on this auction|pg||
nt|xenya: PASS or DOUBLE (if greedy)|pg||
nt|psyck: Bergen Raise Over MAjor Double|pg||
nt|psyck: distinguishes 3/4 card fit & point ranges|pg||

nt|pelu: u cant tell them that!!!|pg||
nt|ritong: phew|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: think SHI passes though|pg||
nt|xenya: good lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: @H-lead against 4@S, then @D to K, @S to A @hQ to K and ruff, @CA and @C .. to K @hJ disc @C-loser, and so on = 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: heee  24-44 China (lucky or deserved:)?|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 3H, so 2S -1 or -2 is no big deal|pg||
nt|idc: Looking at the E-W heart intermediates on last hand, you might just hope for 2-2 trump split rather than a partial cross-ruff|pg||
nt|famus: he needs to ruff a @D for a push board i think|pg||
nt|ady: absolutely|pg||
nt|xenya: despite the grand slam swing we still have the lowest score as compared to the other matches|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good stop and 8 tricks are, may make 9.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: "there|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: 2NT   strong break of transfer|pg||
nt|kit: operator -- this is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry|pg||
nt|kit: Normal 4@H contract -- should make along crossruff lines, taking at least 6 hearts, 2 spades, 1 diamond, and 1 club.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i know, kidding|pg||
nt|psyck:  I'm told 15-17 3rd, no mention of it in cc though|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think stefanov would miss an occasion to open 1NT if system allows it|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, same contract same lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: unexpected lead|pg||
nt|ady: good spot for n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C maybe alerted because there are hands that would bid Puppet Stayman instead of 2@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1NT is mostly a matter of system than points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running scores  http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl   remember to refresh screen|pg||
nt|barnets: Italy bid 6@H too |pg||
nt|barnets: on 29|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: sure, not your fault. :)|pg||
nt|eggy:  Also as NZ are playing Sweden (1.5 behind) there shouldn't be a problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when you PASS  partner has @C   when you DBL pard has @D    example of Great Shuffler's sense of humor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction screams     lead trump THEN look at your hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the italians are in 61H too on the slam hand|pg||
nt|barnets: no the final pass was retracted |pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: the lead guesses diamonds for declarer, and now defeating 2@s will require a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|twcho: wow, they bid it|pg||
nt|kit: Most natural play is to lead diamond to king at trick 2, and another diamond.|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3NT is non serious or serious 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  well stopped|pg||
nt|kareno: Clubs behave but not much else.  Good lead - actually Bridge World has an article this month about the benefits of major suit leads against notrumps - and their general success.|pg||
nt|athene: versace wondering whether to start clubs with small towards the ten i suppose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great|pg||
nt|twcho: no matter what the double means, it must show some useful value. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they will realize after finished|pg||
nt|ritong: a top @s, that is|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6N?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6NT|pg||
nt|ady: not straight foward though  if spades 4-2|pg||
nt|ady: even in hearts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: then @C finesse?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@H 3@S 2@C 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT either on spades 3-3   or club finesse |pg||
nt|barnets: so that effectively will be the end of this match|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: This is the last board of the session. I would like to thank Dirk, our splendid VG operator. Excellent session and many thanks!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: drive out @D ace before tackling @S |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3nt was non-serious|pg||
nt|ady: declined I would think|pg||
nt|gracelin: stopped accurately|pg||
nt|barnets: and he is still thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: now he passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|psyck: other room in 3@cW here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well they escaped, 3@C was down 2 for 300|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this may do worse but not doubled|pg||
pc|dT|nt|boedhy:  4nt quantitative|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, unless you're in 6NT and you get the wrong lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  could be 12 tricks played from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the spectators all know how to make six, declarer does not|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: another down 1 EW joke|pg||
nt|hedyg:  very lucky lie of cards|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Sementa: this the match for 3@H and 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: proble though idf A@D is with south and club comes back   ?|pg||
nt|ady: problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: BBO|pg||
nt|jfeld:  That switch won't work out well, as North no longer has an entry to give the ruff|pg||
nt|jfeld:  most likely this will make now|pg||
nt|fluffy: whatever it was they stay at a safe level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin in 3@H East|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: if he carries on with this line he is going down|pg||
nt|lechcold: http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114883,10496682,Nielegalny_turniej_pokera_w_restauracji.html... tu widaæ co siê dzieje z tymi, którzy graj¹ w gry uzale¿nione od ...|pg||

nt|ady: not to much of a problem with trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|ady: after all that   jsut 3NT|pg||
nt|oosmanb: cant East atleast bid 4NT |pg||
nt|barnets: China made a great comeback but Italy played tough when they neede to in the final set|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|twcho: great bid by Edgtton|pg||
nt|kit: this really feels wrong to me.|pg||
nt|psyck:  @sQ from KQ or QJx|pg||
nt|ritong: varying from K to Q according to agreements|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think they may have just given back the slam swing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can lose also @D switch.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table just finished 26  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H-2 was a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told Italy-China WILL be on vugraph next set    no surprise there :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rensph:  3@C puppet stayman here, little to the play in 4@S> Declarer will draw trumps and then requires the @HK to be onside|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: 1 @C ruff and the 1DA onside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his partner didn't open|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt he bid 3@H over 1N by N|pg||
nt|xenya: or maybe just 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: conventional 2N   then corrected 3@D to 3@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can suspect four spades with West for his double.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lechcold: Grzegorz nie powinien tak siê emocjonowaæ swoimi walorami w czerwonych kolorach|pg||
nt|hedyg:  nnow 3@ss and disc @c|pg||
nt|antoniz: je¿eli to co ogl¹dam ma byæ wzorem wspó³czesnej walki....to chcê byæ starowiecki:)|pg||
nt|ady: and clubs splitting|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht so|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Chance was there to make 8 tricks but did not accept.|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N, i'm told |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rensph:  he might be able to play for a throw-in|pg||
nt|kamyk: w sierpniu 80 Rosiewicz piewa³: "Bulgarija,Bulgarija, u Polijaka awarija"|pg||
nt|brolucius: One down will be fine, against a making 2@H. Madala was unlucky to find only two trumps in the dummy. His bid was fine.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction a variation on mexican 2@D, west showed 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: of course the legitimate plan was to rely on 3-3 @S -- the line adopted by declarer works if the defence err twice -- not sure how good that is  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: another chance.|pg||
nt|barnets: and deserved their win|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Also, many thanks to Kit and Joe, my fellow commentators. We were awarded a fair bunch of boards - neither excellent, nor hopelessly boring - somewhere in between.|pg||

nt|barnets: Italy V Netherlands USA1 VUSA 2 in Bermuda Bowl semi final tomorrow|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree the azurri wobbled badly but showed their talent and guts in coming back to win - the chinese should however be very pleased with their effort|pg||
nt|barnets: Sementa in 6@D remembered to cash the ace first |pg||
nt|roswolf: if they cash the hearts and exit woth a diamond this is down|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobh1: what did W show?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|twcho: and good effort by Gosney too|pg||
nt|hlortz: and @c 3-3|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|rensph:  should the throw-in fail (If S holds the 3rd spade) he can still finesse the hearts himself|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|kareno: This is a hand I would rather leave to partner to declare always - too many choices.  I agree that a club to the ten is tempting.  The diamonds have opened a path for the defense.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jaapfr vg: ok 9 tr and last board|pg||
nt|ady: not much scope for Austrialia on hands 29 to 31    so this looks a convincing win for China|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, someday you will have to tell me about it|pg||
nt|twcho: this will be a serious blow for USA1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hlortz: oops 32|pg||
nt|psyck:  also available on www.bridgewinners.com a site most bridge players must be familiar with by now|pg||
nt|ady: hands 11 and 12 combined  4 imps for Italy   so very close |pg||
pc|dK|pc|c4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kit: He will still survive, but it seems so much more natural to set up at least 1 diamond trick first.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|twcho: the balancing double is absolutely normal by west|pg||
nt|twcho: but north had bid it much better than his counterpart in OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there is so otfen when it is wrong too|pg||
nt|oosmanb: denied 3@S I think|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|lechcold: bez 2...a dobrego dnia mog³o byæ swoje|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: up to 17, bad 18 probably|pg||
nt|oosmanb: <18|pg||
nt|bobh1: then how can E pass?|pg||
nt|ady: what Poland got on hand 30  may go back on 31|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: last board of this match|pg||
nt|barnets: good but normal result for NS here|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the session thx all  thx specs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: was extremely fast|pg||
nt|jkotor: a jeszcze dodam (nie chc¹ mimo wszystko wyjæ na nadwornego krytyka naszych)|pg||
nt|ritong: that one took 17 seconds other room, play included|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next set begins 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|barnets: France beat china women by 9.7 imps i|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator Paul, and my co-commentator Krishna, good job by both|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: next match starts in 55 minutes from now|pg||
nt|ady: thx Natalia    thx specs|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer changes plan (somewhat incosistently perhaps), making contract |pg||
nt|rialc2: ciao a tutti|pg||
mb|1D|nt|boedhy:  throwing imps like candy..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board, we start again at 13.45|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: that is in 1 hour|pg||
nt|rhelle:  this is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes do you know there agreements|pg||
nt|rhelle:  they play dstructive preempts this vul(doesn't everybody?)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  what is the range|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but the temptation to bid 6@c must be strong|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt overcall perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: would be interesting to see how lauria-versace handle such interference|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like a normal 4H hand on this last deal of the set.|pg||
nt|barnets: east overcalled one heart in open|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has preferred a double to 1@H (the modern choice) and may escape a penalty.|pg||
nt|ady: great result for USA here in OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course they opened 1@D at the other table.|pg||
nt|ady: thx Gerbrand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Gerbarand you were great as always|pg||
nt|hedyg:  our thanks to our outstanding operator in Eindhoven, Gerbrand Hop, well done! to my excellent fellow commentators David , Daniel , Gonzalo and Jaap as well as CK, William and Ralf on voice for donating their time to guide us through these boards|pg||
nt|jkotor: ¿e tylko jedna para z tej reprezentacji gra³a ostatnio wszystko razem i gra w lidze razem|pg||
nt|eggy:  I can't see too much potential for a disaster either way here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@D, unbal|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator, Harold. Great Job! Our appreciation to all the organisers for bringing this festival of bridge to our screens. ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Naresh and Barnet for their company and perceptive comments. Also to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|barnets: in very close match and a 4 imp carryforward|pg||
mb|d|nt|rhelle:  getting to 6@d now is too hard, I think|pg||
nt|rensph:  Even if spades break 4-1 taking the ace and returning a spade works equally well|pg||
nt|antoniz: bardzo trudny po otwarcie przeciwnika|pg||
nt|fabsayc: about the time they finish in open room :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  That is extremely fast for 1N|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the senior bowl Poland moved to the win from behind on bd 32, making x'd games in both rooms.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: here even not enough though:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: This may well turn out to be a historic match. It is great to be able to see it unfolding, live and free of charge, on BBO. |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thanks all see you back tomorrow....|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Martin, Paul, & kibitzers|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thx all! see you after lunch :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: So many thanks to Bob Drijver our excellent Operator.  To the specs for their wit and wisdom.  To Bill Frisby for his contributions and, of course, to WBF for allowing us to watch ...|pg||
nt|kareno: their marvelous production of the world championships.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Opened room started 10 minutes later than this room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are bidding 15 there|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: because the match is on VuGraph|pg||
nt|ady: slam to finish|pg||
nt|gulyas: ty all, it was an exciting match here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphznt: bocchi pointing out 3H makes|pg||
nt|idc: Last board at this table (the Open room have 4 more though) so time for thanks:|pg||
nt|santyclz: True, only 16 imps....|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: Dennis tx for perfect job as usual and congrats to China|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rhelle:  4@d may be an artificial slam try in @c|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will bid 5@c now expecting @h points|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally, this double shows a desire to penalize opps, but my guess is EW just use it to show some values|pg||
nt|barnets: I prefer the unfortunate 1@H bid|pg||
nt|twcho: last board for this round|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a memorable victory for Australia|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: We will be back at 13.45 local time|pg||
nt|petergill: West is thinking about whether to convert to 4@H|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Peter, a good win for your country|pg||
nt|petergill: If W does bid 4@H, then @SA lead works well, but might not be South's choice after this auction. The 3@S raise at the other table worked well, by guiding S to @SA lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  David Bird would be pleased with that speed though|pg||
nt|ritong: talking about this slam:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: defence helped too:)|pg||
nt|ady: looks like n/s can make 5@C      |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: you're welcome :) thanks all for the commentating|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: ths Denis|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: tx David and kibs last session at 16.45|pg||
nt|ady: thx specks|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and then Icelands faith has been put into other hands|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Having a stiff spade and a good suit, bidding 2@H is clear and not close in my opinion|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I cant figure out if Iceland is safe in Top8 -- but I think not, yet|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: 1@D will be a transfer bid.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  as well as to the World Bridge Federation and to the World Bridge Federation with the Nederlandse Bridge Bond for sharing this important event  with us,especially to Jacob Hop who is instrumental in organising the broadcasts on behalf of BBO!|pg||
nt|jkotor: przed ME cykl powa¿nych przygotowañ by³ trochê d³u¿szy i porz¹dniejszy|pg||
nt|ritong: merci karen|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder how many of the 2394 kibitzers are praying that their manager will not suddenly enter the office. (I remember the feeling).|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: starting tomorrow at 10.30|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The next session starts in around 1 hours and 10 minutes. It will be the last session of the day.|pg||
nt|kit: This time it is right to play the 5-3 major-suit fit|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even promising spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board for the day, back tomorrow at 10.30 Paris time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: here at the playing site in Veldhoven|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our excellent operator Jan Nielsen|pg||
nt|idc: to my fellow commentator Joe and to our Operator Paul|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie p³aczmy na zapas,do strefy awansu niedaleko, jutro jest nowy dzieñ|pg||
nt|garden2005: nast¹pi przebudzenie|pg||
nt|ady: another game for n/s|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|ritong: but north has a lot|pg||
nt|ritong: brutal bids of that sort must be precise|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes N will get to slam opp a positive response|pg||
nt|ritong: my guess would be 5332 9/10|pg||
nt|psyck:  1@c is 17+, so 8-9HCP 5332 for the 3N maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: anyway stefanov will drive on|pg||
nt|ritong: he is considering which way|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and return whilst last round RR is full of tension|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 16-board sessions tomorrow to finish the Quarter Finals|pg||
nt|fabsayc: vugraph match for next set will be netherlands-italy with voice commentary|pg||
mb|4S|nt|boedhy:  still liking his hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: despite this loss of Italy they still do lead the Round Robin pack after round 5|pg||
nt|idc: to the WBF for allowing us to broadcast this event|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Martel doesn't particularly mind a @s contract by e-w.|pg||
nt|idc: and as always to Roland and BBO, without whose work none of this amazing stuff would happen|pg||
nt|hedyg:  special thanks to our specs for joining and the kind and helpful messages. we hope you enjoyed the show.|pg||
nt|ady: may take some bidding   4th heart and the jack  the key|pg||
nt|hlortz: thx David, Hasan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last board, thanks to our operator Felipe and to my co-commentators Peter and Henry|pg||
nt|ritong: sober|pg||
nt|ady: bad splits in the majors may beat any major suit game    but  5 clubs looks a make getting diamon d position right|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: tension here already. The Dutch all follow their ladies team|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: anyone any idea of ages N and S?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: currently 8th, but France in 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Ultima board del segmento|pg||
nt|fluffy: grue-lall got a very good result here|pg||
nt|fluffy: after EW found their 4-4 spade fit Grue on north doubled knowing his partner had 4@s and he had a big hand after opener|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: We will be back at 16.45 local time|pg||
nt|gracelin: or about 64 minutes from nw.|pg||
nt|ady: Bocchi got his 2 suits in|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I wouldn't be surprised if we will see the last quarter of this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: shi should respect the vul and pass imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  in this layout it all mattered very little, had north held the @HK it would've been a very effective @SQ|pg||
nt|famus: i rate them favourite to win|pg||
nt|gracelin: some care is needed here.  But I am confident Shi will also bring this home.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: LIAN already left the table|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a well educated quess Famus±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: the next match will start in 40 minutes from now.  Tks all for watching and hope you have enjoyed some great hands.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will also like to thank Felipe, our most capable operator who explained many bidding sequences to us.|pg||
nt|pelu: a way to play is @cA - @H to Q, @hA and then 4x@D discard @s, then @C AND MAKING 11|pg||
nt|jaapfr: looks tough for E )DD very easy'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but he is afraid for @H loss @C@C and @SA for down 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer want to cash HA first as a safety play(he could afford t lose one trump), but here the threat for club overruff made that play not totally safe.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and very afraid for ducking this IF S 6 card @C|pg||
nt|famus: playing @hA is sure wau to -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7 card|pg||
nt|famus: 6 cards he has so needs to duck|pg||
nt|gracelin: with a 7-card club suit at this Vul. south may have bid more.  so duck the first club then take trump finesse maybe a good way.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hope he does not go for the line @CA @HA x@S|pg||
nt|lechcold: dojd¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: chyba...|pg||
nt|jkotor: OBY!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fate -- not faith off course :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: a flyer by the azurri on the last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: and to the spectators for some alert analysis|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and to the commentator for an excellent job |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do you think 3@d is forcing or not here?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W seems to be in doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  now pass finally|pg||
nt|rhelle:  good sequence - 5@c is again 50% at best|pg||
nt|boedhy:  slam again 50% or so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well the 6 card trump support is hardly clear|pg||
nt|antoniz: mnie jest po prostu smutno,ale wierzê w przebudzenie naszych reprezentantów:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: * nie chc¹c|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie by³y to ³atwe rozdania|pg||
nt|psyck:  whichever strain he chooses will work as cards lay|pg||
nt|psyck:  6@c the normal choice to protect @dK|pg||
nt|eggy:  on this score they are safe I think|pg||
nt|jfeld:  So, Iceland looks safe to me|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Even if Japan blitzed they can't catch them|pg||
nt|eggy:  japan cannot pick up enough more (they are on 21 already)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: If that is so I will congratulate both teams in this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: starting times same throught the event|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we will be covering the other matches including this with written commentary|pg||
pc|d2|nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play|pg||
nt|rhelle:  North: you guys have a bit of a @h fit|pg||
nt|kareno: Spectators, you'd better reserve your seats for the entire tournament - there is much wonderful bridge coming up!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W decides that 3@d was non forcing and passed|pg||
nt|petergill: At this vulnerability, I'm a big fan of Fleischer's decision to treat KQx as four spades |pg||
nt|petergill: Fleisher I mean|pg||
nt|twcho: if non-@s lead, declarer will go down at most one|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA lead ---> 300 when declarer has to try for 3-3 trumps to try to make his contract, but I think a @D lead might be more likely|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: Dennis?|pg||
nt|rialc2: siamo tutti scossi dalla scomparsa del "grande Sic"!|pg||
nt|fluffy: this double sometimes won't work obviously, but today it brings 500 that can't be beaten|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this should make 5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lechcold: :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i wonder if he has A10x in spades if things would have been different|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Li just left the room -- and now Liu is on his own -- will he manage that?|pg||
nt|ehsana: .....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile 5@D in open room going down undoubled|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi now has a decision to make. Pass, 2NT, 3@D? He has chosen 2NT.|pg||
nt|ady: request for a link to running scores please|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@SX would not have been much fun|pg||

nt|petergill: If @D lead to ace, then on @CJ at Trick 2, S must rise ace OR underlead @SA when @D is ruffed|pg||
nt|lechcold: Brazylijczycy zagrali dobrze|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeli nawet, to nic nie t³umaczy gry katastrofalnej, a tak¹ w nadmiarze tu ogl¹dam od 4 dni|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: a o 16.45 - mecz open Polska-Izrael, rowniez z przekazem wideo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this result wont help Sweden, who are borderline for qualifying to KO stage|pg||
nt|hlortz: thanks msrtin peter and our great kibs & operator.. it was a 2 board match for usa team...|pg||
nt|ritong: pard can hold @s KQJxx and an ace, perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: australia pulled back 5 on hand 29|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Shi seems rather old, Lian is younger (like 30s or 40s)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they did|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy has forged ahead.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|twcho: now declarer is safe from being punched|pg||
nt|gulyas: S probably showing distribution here|pg||
nt|hlortz: /martin/|pg||
nt|ady: not many top losers in hears with J9 doubleton   but spade force may deadent the club suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Vladimir and Harold and all the specs, absorbing bridge.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s look out of the bidding at this stage|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: once i told Shi is old, he immediately took out his 5@c :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: what a bid 5@C:)|pg||
nt|ady: oh a different turn|pg||
nt|resurectin:  not sure after interference, but usually 2d shows normal opening hand|pg||
nt|eggy:  and sweden are playing New zealand who are the only others who can pvertake them|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd13 cost china 13imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11 actually|pg||
nt|gracelin: actually 11, 200 + 300|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitch a heart and club to 10 seems normal to me|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Although the dummy's @c holding looks ominous.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I think south showed some @S now|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Gerbrand when is restart please?|pg||
nt|garden2005: dziêkujê za wspólne kibicowanie - dobranoc :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: I love 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: dont know where that came from|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: from SHI|pg||
nt|yuval10: if X over 2@c was for a lead, and showed good suit, then why not?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i think edgtton is writing that dbl shows interest in bidding 5@h|pg||
nt|ady: though not sure about the west double?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  This looks like an easy 9 tricks with Diamonds coming home|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rensph:  3N is made on a heart lead and continuation here, but if defenders set up a diamond trick early on declarer will still have to find the @SQ|pg||
nt|rensph:  I'm also informed that lauria made 4@S on this hand|pg||
nt|rensph:  3NT, sorry|pg||
nt|jacksond: if plays donde for spade queen he makes quite easily|pg||
nt|rensph:  sorry, 3N making with clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: been called worse|pg||
nt|psyck:  well, if 3N limited hand, he is not looking fro grand|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: from N's double?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: yyy|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: hoi vlad|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: can't properly read the note, all writing are mixed together|pg||
nt|ritong: the line is interesting, though|pg||
nt|ritong: how would you proceed?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  duck 2 spades|pg||
nt|ritong: means two discards from dummy|pg||
nt|jfeld:  and try to duck a heart to the safe hand|pg||
nt|jfeld:  I would pitch a club|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: North realised that his partner must have had some purpose in bidding 2@C checkback. When it turned out that he was not looking for four hearts, he knew that he must have been ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: looking for a 5-3 spade fit.|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@C Krzysztof potraktowa³ jako normalny cue-bid|pg||
nt|famus: Thnks Henery--and i go along with the n key:)|pg||
nt|ady: clubs in fact blocked if the play 3NT    4 spades safer|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know it Italy in slam on hand 31?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yes they are|pg||
nt|ady: apparently ye    tht so|pg||
nt|jfeld:  and a heart|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: thanks Rashed, Harold -- and everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wlc|pg||
nt|yuval10: S wanted to bid it anyway but wanted to hear more from opps|pg||
nt|xenya: hoi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: all pressure now on E|pg||
nt|ady: I agree 5@C  from Shi a good possibility   but seemed to be lrking in wings for a couple of rounds|pg||
nt|yuval10: he was affraid that the bidding will stall after 3@s so he bided what he wanted to bid at first place|pg||
nt|ady: this must confirm a good win for China|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: running scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: assuming this makes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: grue hand was a problem response to the overcall, 1@S or 2@C would have worked better|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and offcourse this one is down on @s lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  thinking about it, 6@c is down on a @s lead|pg||
nt|kit: 10 easy tricks with spades splitting, but only 8 in notrump|pg||
nt|brolucius: if you want to listen to Voice Commentary, you should go directly to website: http://www.bridgebase.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 16.45 1hr 20 from now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb they go for 6@D|pg||
nt|gulyas: next set starting at 16:45|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably 3NT is 5422, and now north has to think|pg||
nt|hedyg:  shame only the 1st page of the NS CC is loaded :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DQ so vital here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I try to read what South wrote down|pg||
nt|fluffy: against many 8 HCP hands 6@d has no play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Lauria did bid 4NT as East|pg||
nt|yuval10: it will|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: yes it will make|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: simple after this lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: pls kibs we are not responsible for the bids of the players:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i hear Lian 45 and SHI 47 (your bridge much better than yr agequessing Dennis:)|pg||
nt|eggy:  if he ducks enough spades East he might even end up with a squeeze of West for +1 I think|pg||
pc|h4|nt|famus: yes--too tired--as pointed out by informed kibtz-- taking @H  A wud need to squeeze|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and Versace has bid 6@H|pg||
nt|ritong: now he has an avoidance play if east has three@hs including exactly one card superior to the 8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphznt: Bye for now|pg||
nt|kareno: So that's it and Italy will get most or all of the VPs for this match.  Well done!!|pg||
nt|rensph:  lets see how declarer handles 4@S here though|pg||
nt|gracelin: He play Hear to break 2-2 or a singleton honor drops.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pity|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy recovered 19 mps in last 2 boards for a tied match.  Bye all|pg||
nt|famus: so a well deserved 1 imp:) thnks all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still China wins    wddddddddd±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed.  They tied with both Sweden and Italy today|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: see you soon|pg||
nt|lechcold: przyda³oby siê 4N jako cue-ogólny|pg||
nt|petergill: If @CJ to king at Trick 2, then on @DK N will play @D9 as suit pref for @SA underlead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@D plsssssss|pg||
nt|ady: may know shape   but needs KJ hearts as well as QD|pg||
nt|fluffy: he is also worried about clubs because he has @cQx and partner could have 2 low|pg||
nt|fluffy: wooldridge and hurd probably play a conventional 1NT-2NT|pg||
nt|ady: got 11 imps on 13  where China went down 3 in 4@H     China played 3@C  down 1|pg||
nt|ady: a little unlucky for China|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: this likely to make|pg||
nt|brolucius: (My spelling is better than my typing.)|pg||
nt|barnets: should the two teams meet later on in the KO stages|pg||
nt|barnets: a good match and especially fine performance by the young USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: East doubled 1@C, so not certain that declarer will score four diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will not hold a singleton diamond for his double, so declarer will start with the @DK.|pg||
nt|ady: maybe south will raise|pg||
nt|ady: no|pg||
nt|gulyas: no reason to, he told his story already|pg||
nt|fluffy: soth has told his story, he is not raising|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South going through the auction, and asks who is declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And told he has a good hand for N|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they are|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finishing on a game swing for USA2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: I should also thank the players - been a lot of good bridge to watch|pg||

nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North could do a slam try|pg||
nt|ritong: i would do like you, jason|pg||
nt|ritong: keeping the @h option|pg||
nt|rialc2: interessante e simpatica la difesa di Ovest: sfortunatissima nella situazione|pg||
nt|rialc2: a più tardi. Ciao|pg||
nt|fluffy: so 2@c and then 2NT didn't promise any major|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: especially getting diamonds right|pg||
nt|barnets: this will still be a small swing to USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: With -500 on there partners' card, it was very much the right thing to do (as it happens) to bid game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..their..|pg||
nt|barnets: who will win this match and have a carry forward of some kind|pg||
nt|ady: may make even with 3 diamonds    as long as playing 1st club from north|pg||
nt|ady: thx Henry Hasan|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Lauria now thinking of bidding 6NT vs pass|pg||
nt|gracelin: CJ?|pg||
nt|ady: 2 down in 3@C   so net gain of 500 for Italy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|boedhy:  well good start for the Netherlands...and with all these difficult and lively boards fun to watch|pg||
nt|boedhy:  bye bye|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ok, thx all - see you in an hour|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bye|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H made -- looks quite a feat... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense didn't play @D early enough|pg||
nt|xenya: so the ddefence slipped in the other room -- and the same may well happen here...|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|petergill: Now S must rise on @CJ|pg||
nt|kamyk: no ale pamiêtajmy o chorobie Narkiewicza - to musia³o miec istotny wp³yw; ten sam sk³ad by³ w stanie osiagn¹æ du¿o wiêcej; no i jeszcze nie wszystko stracone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if West has @CK  that doesn't help the cause|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: doubled paert score sing   China played 2@C making 10 tricks in OR on hand 30|pg||
nt|yuval10: also http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: China have put a very creditable performance this match  |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: I think will get diamond right   as does not want west on lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could easily be 4-4-4-1 for his initial take-out double.|pg||
nt|ady: well thx all|pg||
nt|jbennet: wd NS |pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought he might try @SQ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|fluffy: his hcp are maximum yes jaap, but partner could have anything|pg||

pc|h6|nt|ady: J@C   might have been better|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jaapfr vg: b17 and b17 made up for the exact difference between China and Australia sofar|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: b17 and b26|pg||
nt|jbennet: at last a pair who ventured biddin in early stage. reaching their unbeatable 5 Clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i think official playing time was over 7 minutes ago, but no director yet|pg||
nt|yuval10: it looks like the first 5 teams are locked in the QF ( Italy, NET, USA2, Israel and USA1 ) , while many teams are struggling for the last 3 spots|pg||
nt|xenya: so China was 2.5VP ahead of Australia after board 30. With Sweden pressing closely behind the last round is going to be fascinating|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|brolucius: When you Join a table that has voice commentary (there will always be two during the world championships), you can switch on each of the three commentators.|pg||
nt|famus: tx David|pg||
nt|pelu: the "slam" here need @S 3-2, K onside and @D 3-3|pg||
nt|ritong: which does not cancel the @c option|pg||
nt|jfeld:  well it does |pg||
nt|ritong: does it?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  because of entries|pg||
nt|eggy:  well no squeeze for +1 then as the heart threat has been thrown|pg||
nt|ritong: you have to play for QJ on, no?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|hlortz: bye|pg||
nt|famus: byee|pg||
nt|jfeld:  you can't try diamonds first then|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: I am not sure of the exact carryovers but it usually depends on which team finishes higher in the round robin|pg||
nt|brolucius: West false-carded the @DQ, to mislead declarer as to the position of the @DJ.|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³yszenia,dziêki|pg||
nt|ady: rast now a bit end played because of club play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italy have stemmed the flow of IMPs in the last set, taking the session 25-7 with a couple of comparisons to come. The final session will be something to savour.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, he didn't listen us to lead CJ earlier.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: standings after this round : Neth 161 Italy 155 Israel 149 and usa2 137|pg||
nt|idc: including that last play - East realizes he can afford 2 trump losers but only if he starts on side suit immediately|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Karen great operating, thanks Henry and Tommy and all spectators for great feedback|pg||

nt|fabsayc: thanks to all the commentators, spectators and especially our operator, good job|pg||
mc|10|nt|brolucius: But no doubt he was helped by East's switch to the @D7. |pg||
nt|barnets: tks all specs|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
nt|ady: kept the loss to 1 imp|pg||
