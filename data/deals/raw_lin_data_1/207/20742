nt|ryskiel_: witam ponownie|pg||
nt|runnerup: this can go home ofcause|pg||
nt|runnerup: actually needs very bad def to let this make|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: declarer asks about 3@H; it shows a distributional hand|pg||
nt|olegario: there is a chance of making it, though E_W  if the timing is lost|pg||
nt|grebrof: the swedes are playing a conventional system where they dont count the Js - not sure how the americans play, but I hope someone can enlighten me|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I will try to tell you what I hear and see here from the room |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: but I am getting older -- so might have problems seeing everything :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because of 3@C Puppet   you'll sometimes see 2@C alerted|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|grebrof: anyway - this board ended in 2@h which might even be overboard - if we are to use an expression from shiping|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi all|pg||
nt|djneill:  well it does make slam on this lie|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||

nt|odysseus69: Hi Jan|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|jbgood: hi from Veldhoven|pg||

nt|odysseus69: needs help from defence|pg||

pc|sT|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|djneill:  North has all but one trick, so the count is rectified for a possible squeeze if he runs the winners, but that would require a very clumpy distribution, someone having all the high hearts and spades, but why not it doesn't hurt to try|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|ady: Hi RV|pg||
nt|sheila a:  but opening at 1 level makes it easier to find your best fit|pg||
nt|olegario: this is a cool slam to bid but not so easy to play though everything lays as it should|pg||
nt|sheila a:  S doesn't realise how strong partner is|pg||
nt|sheila a:  not excited to hear of @h shortage|pg||
nt|olegario: yes but Diogo has control of the hand and now he shows better his hand|pg||
nt|olegario: he has tow tough decisions to bid|pg||
nt|olegario: two|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@C with 2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: well, ok; but logically, it must be for the minors|pg||

nt|lontoh 63: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: good evening Lontoh|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like make now -2 @d tricks won -so looks like 9|pg||
nt|hlortz: looks like trump would have been best this may let it get home|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|vugraphznx: results and running scores can be found here: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|panosk: this dont look gd|pg||
nt|rv: this will go many down, same bidding in OR as well|pg||
nt|djneill:  but I thought the point of bridge was to find a major fit, which 1NT steps around|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|lontoh 63: thanks Ruud|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|grebrof: even if W had opened 1nt, theres no reason not showing a 2 suiter - obviously Berthaus doesnt want a @h or even a @c lead|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  Needs both club and @H honours to be corectly placed|pg||
nt|hlortz: we can see south was hoping for a quick ruff but the wrongplayer was short in @C|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: in the running scores Sweden is leading by 333 imps to 0. So a lot of work to do by USA 2 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: clearly a mistake, as Sweden only had a carry-over of 3 imps|pg||
nt|hlortz: declarer exits @h k to make a trump shift harmless - no @H lead so he expects s to have the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: we are now playing the Quarter Finals. It's Knock-Out from now on|pg||
nt|hlortz: mine shows swe leading 4-0|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the carry-over is based on the result of their match in the round robin|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sweden won by 10 imps. Since USA 2 finished higher in the rankings 1/3 of the difference is the carry-over|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psyck:  he wants to minimise damages vul, but not much he can do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyway, this will drift two or three off |pg||
nt|shurik: still shoul bea push for 140 - but great mp score|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good argument for  either Kaplan Inversion   [1@H-1@S="forcing nt"]  or flannery|pg||
nt|barnets: i would say point is to get a plus when you can|pg||
nt|djneill:  true|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where was that hint when i was playing rubber bridge?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: not unnatural to double, but takes a good defense to beat it I think|pg||
nt|jbgood: a good meaning perfect|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rv: declarer will struggle to make 5 tricks here|pg||
nt|sheila a:  needing trumps to come in, it seems best to play W for the Q as can pick up qxxx on that side|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|barnets: I think the x of 1N shows a strong hand with @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: over nebulous 1cl or 1 d it is imperative to enter the auction early when its still cheap. So immediately D if 1D might well include hands where  "i was also going to open a ...|pg||
nt|jbennet: nebulous D"|pg||
nt|jbennet: they didnt have that agreement, and duly paid 12 IMP:s for it.|pg||

nt|sheila a:  In the other room E opened 1@s and when 4@h came back to him made an 'action' double|pg||
nt|fluffy: some in the middle bid like 5@h would had worked better for Bertheau as the cards lied|pg||
mb|2D|an|hearts|nt|jbgood: S pitched a @d in the OR - that is why he only took 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: no imps will be moved here |pg||

nt|ahollan1: FREQUENT upgrade to 14-16|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, sometimes both players in a pair feel like take it slow and wait and see, then its not easy to find a game when both players think partner is bidding on your card as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for this reason, many pairs treat NS 1N opener as Weak|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|sheila a:  E here gets his hand off his chest more quickly|pg||
nt|shurik: thin 3nt here for US but 9 tricks without any sweat|pg||
mb|d|nt|panosk: i m with CK too|pg||
nt|fluffy: NS being agressive this might lead to -800|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this might end up Fredin Dbl 4 @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  @h could be rite in slam too, hoping for 1@h, 1@c trick, but ddepends on bidding|pg||
nt|jbgood: possible to get ambitious on the S hand when prd supports spades ... no good layout for game though|pg||
nt|odysseus69: without the spade king play I was expecting the heart Q next|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: against suit NS lead 3th 5th|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@h shows 3@hs|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@h a slamtry I think|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@h sets the fit and lets start cuebidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: but Grue has too many spades to try it|pg||
nt|mikael_w: or 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: trump lead may give 3@D a probelem|pg||
nt|rv: Italy leading with 361, India in 17th place on 265, 34 VPs behind 8th spot NZ|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  great lead|pg||
nt|ady: can get the position of 10C right to make|pg||
nt|djneill:  North is relying on the clubs to make up for the HCP|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@DX was 800|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think Fredin wanted to Dbl, but maybe Dbl says he wants @d lead now|pg||
nt|shurik: yes he had a win win situation- passing the dble is 500 bidding 3nt- 600|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Grue asking lall if 3h would have been forcing|pg||
nt|djneill:  East certainly cannot expect partner to have a lot here to lead towards - he has 13 HCP and the opponents bid 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Lall said NO|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|odysseus69: in trhe slam zone here|pg||
nt|fluffy: @sA missing Kevin knows|pg||

pc|c3|nt|ady: now should be down|pg||
nt|odysseus69:  needs an unlikely diamond lead to make slam|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure I agree with cue a void here when W has opened, but I have found myself doiing it more than onece|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@d is showing the 2 cuebids, and 4@s might be kickback or some last train, whatever it is, bathurst is happy to play slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 4@d might be Last train|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: instead of a cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: it does guarantee a @s control|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: but not a @d cuebid|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah, it should guarantee that|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fluffy: zagorin has evaluated very well his @cKx, and now 6@h will make if they can just play the correct heart top honnor|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: makeable now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rv: this and 2 more rounds to be played in RR|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  yes|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 3  NS never bid  Wooldridge in 3N|pg||
nt|jbennet: in fact club lead followed by an immediate sp switch had set up path for -1100. (1+2+3+2)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yusufb: nerde:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South might fear that leading spade ace might suggest he has q of hearts|pg||
nt|grebrof: the lead is very good|pg||
nt|shurik: i think we need undo?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: no..|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphznx: Grue just notices and he said what did i do?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jbgood: The first 4 seem safe, but 7 teams fighting for the other 4 quarter final spots |pg||
pc|cA|nt|sheila a:  difficult for S to bid over 4@s opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: that seemed a litlle surprising to Bathurst|pg||
nt|grebrof: as I said - leading an ace, often say you have something in trumps|pg||
nt|fluffy: yeah, who would expect teh palyer who opened 4 CHP previous board to pass with a void at the 1 level?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he avoided the diamond lead - but not sure that even that would be enough|pg||
nt|grebrof: entering at the 1level or opening 3rd hand is 2 different things, but I agree|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|rv: top 8 teams will qualify for QFs at today end of day (EOD)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

nt|jfeld:  Grue thought he had one more trick|pg||
nt|djneill:  now must hope for a lucky lie, like West with the @sA|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fluffy: tried to steal the @s trick, not a success|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|s4|pg||

nt|fluffy: but this will jus tbe 3 tricks for teh defence|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, he had to try somethinh|pg||
nt|grebrof: g|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barnets: easts 3@D bid here was risky and his failure to come in on the last hand probably had something to do with hs bidding here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|panosk: yes today is the end of round robin, many formidable teams wud have to leave |pg||
nt|psyck:  Indians got to 3N here other room|pg||

pc|h4|nt|jbgood: some are saying the first six are safe - not sure about that...|pg||

nt|shurik: yes Barnet agree|pg||
nt|djneill:  opportunity cost more than anything, doubt other room will reach game|pg||
nt|jbennet: the only way to prevent -1100 in 3 d x was for east to take spade ace at trick 2 and then play another club at trick 3. |pg||

mb|3D|nt|rv: 2@c could be transfer to @d|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1NT probably shows a good support hand|pg||

nt|hlortz: that was a strange finesse might have lost + a @C ruff why ot just D throwing J@C for safe 10 tricks or did i miss something?|pg||

nt|bt:  i doubt usa2 defines themselves as underdogs :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  South will bid game now|pg||
nt|djneill:  North should have 4 hearts, so 9 trumps a singleton and joe grue|pg||
nt|shurik: 3dia actually helps , plus they are agressive bidders|pg||
mb|4H|nt|runnerup: 11 in @h by guessing -this is more challencing|pg||
nt|rv: sry 3 card drury|pg||
nt|fluffy: nystrom's hand is good, but having the strong opening on his right is not particularilly appealing|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: well, bertheau had thought very long before taking @sQ, so he had last trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@S a save against 6 of a red suit|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah table action |pg||
nt|fluffy: you want AQ10 and KJ9 when RHO opens, his hand would be wonderful if the strong hand was in his left|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  not likely to bid @h slam with two keycards missing|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: bertheau telling he thought 1N was cuebid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garden2005: nie tylko piki, bedzie p¹czek albo kilka paczek :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  i guess North will settle for cash here|pg||
nt|fluffy: looks like 8 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|jacksond: there opnly other choice after doing well in the RR was to pick USA 1|pg||
nt|bt:  i wont tell u what i think but a team that wins us trials and are 3rd in the RR are no underdogs usually|pg||
nt|odysseus69: defence better not slip|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but may try passive spade lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: at this point of the match, USA2 are the underdogs, but only narrowly|pg||
nt|fluffy: remember 2@c can be any balanced hand, not neccesarilly long clubs|pg||
nt|jacksond: the odds even before the tournament quoted in bulletin were 8/1 Sweden and 16/1 USA 2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: lerading from axxx not attractive on this auction|pg||
nt|odysseus69: nothing attractive|pg||

nt|ahollan1: top level for CCs of all participants  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/wbf/2011netherlands/systems.asp|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Interesting the Swedes mixed it up. I've heard Nystrom and Upmark are going to start playing together in the future.|pg||
nt|jbennet: if holding enough trumps and half the deck the number of tricks u lose= The combined number "declarer's shortest suits+dummy's shortest suits". |pg||
pc|s2|nt|sheila a:  having diagnosed the lack of @h stop EW have a choice of 4@s or 5@d|pg||

nt|djneill:  danger for North?  4-0 @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nystrom-upmark  and  bertheau-cullin have had recent wins in ACBL National Pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and nystrom-upmark played in recent China Invitational teams|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok, North knows now where both major Kings must be if East has 15 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Grue almost said exactly that :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  so he is just waiting to claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Grue giving a running commentary?    Adam Zmudzinski does that too|pg||
nt|jfeld:  yes, this was a better safety play :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|runnerup: what is happening now -forcing pass -when they could have died in loosing 4 @s |pg||
nt|grebrof: I never understood the passive leads when you have entries - or that you know you have the entries but you "know" your partner has nothing|pg||

nt|fluffy: I don't think we are here to predict what will happen, and less again to support a team against another|pg||
nt|odysseus69: going for 20 wrong predictions|pg||
nt|grebrof: the @d 10 is much more clarifying,  - but it depends on agreements|pg||

nt|fluffy: sweden had a disater at the other table|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5 minor and not 3NT the spot and 5D down|pg||
nt|bt:  thanks for telling us |pg||
nt|grebrof: seeing all the hands make every world class player look like an idiot - well - they do make mistakes, but the difference between you and me, is  that they actually put their mind ...|pg||

nt|djneill:  1@h = @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2+@C  and 1@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|fluffy: pass of 2@s might have had some special meaning at the other table, and that encouraged west to bid his hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but they have to reach 5 clubs for big swing|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Pass from E was negative -- DBL would have been gameforcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: very rare to see natural 1@d on 1@c with 4M+4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  i think it was just braindead but there are many boards left|pg||
nt|barnets: surprised lall did not overcall here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  thing is everyone makes mistakes, its how you handle them that counts|pg||
nt|jbennet: another strange move.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panosk: lots of imps exchanging hands in 1st few boards in all matches|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: West thinking|pg||
nt|djneill:  both sides missed their 9fits|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s can make 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nystrom making 3N   nice line that works if @C OR @H break |pg||
nt|jbennet: after all 2D is a cheap bid. |pg||
nt|barnets: sorry bad spade spli upsets it|pg||
nt|shurik: i think 5 dia will run home here- who dropped the ball here?|pg||
nt|jbennet: that do not commit EW to game.|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes george very nice for sweden now, they needed that|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Fredins 1@h showing @s for sure took away n/s @s contrakt. even if @d is better to play for e/w this was winning action|pg||

nt|sheila a:  Assume 3@s showed max and 5@s |pg||

nt|rv: Versace's double shows extras, Inv hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: some partscore competition, minors won over majors, wich is not usually the case|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: grue saying he could have invited over 1N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably wants to go back to 2@h |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Indonesia made 3NT on board 21, so the gap closes to 118-114|pg||
nt|djneill:  so East did not open 1@d and rebid clubs, perhaps because they have a rule that @d must be as long as @c|pg||
nt|warrens:  under their system, could E open 1@D and rebid 2@C's to show 5-4 (even if reversed)?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|runnerup: no angry birds (doubles ) inn teams so |pg||
nt|sheila a:  played the other way up in the other room and got a @d lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: Grue showing both minors, anyone can be longer if any, an lall decided to pick clubs wich seems worse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: both pairs play slightly odd two bids; NS Multi 2@d, 2@H=both majors, 2@s=6-carder|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW two-way 2@C and 2@d, 2M=5card s+4+minor, weakish|pg||

nt|grebrof: I kinda find it hard that supporting to 4@s and this VUL would be too bad with an A and 4 trumps, but Peter has probably seen Fredriks entries before|pg||
nt|jbennet: 2 d from west and after that 3 clubs.  (but i dont expect anyone to agree that 2d should have been bid at west,s 2nd turn).|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|fluffy: however clubs break better than diamonds|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|s3|nt|panosk: id very much like to see their bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it's odd how "standard" varies from country to country |pg||
nt|mdgraham: like a lot of other things I suppose|pg||
nt|bt:  chalk another 14 imp up to undisciplined bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: making 5 or 6 says Zagorin|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it looks from here that West should have passed 3D in open room|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: "Play it" says N|pg||
nt|barnets: italy missed the 4@h game we saw n/s just bid 2 boards back|pg||
nt|djneill:  South knows East's shape now, since East has 5 clubs and 9 spades, only shape, 0445|pg||
pc|hT|pc|sA|nt|djneill:  er 0 spades|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1 down wouldn't matter if 2@s was making, but here it looks like 2@s is doomed, 2@c 1@d 1@h 2@s on a club lead, but Lall had no other lead avaible I think|pg||
nt|barnets: last board actually|pg||
nt|jbennet: so passing 2 clubs not a -10 IMP decision but possible a -12 IMP-decision.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphznx: and then he claims again|pg||

nt|ady: Laria will open|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: players are taking a break|pg||
nt|ady: so am I|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, N could well pass|pg||
nt|panosk: and many more David |pg||
nt|rv: OR on brd 6 played in 1n from East hand, @s lead sets up too many tricks for defense|pg||
nt|rv: Lauria-Versace did very well to unearth a 4-4 @d fit after 1@c opening and play in @d partial|pg||
nt|rv: I can bet not too many E-W pairs across the field would play brd 6 in @d strain|pg||
nt|psyck:  Deal 7 is uncontested aution other room, so they should get there too|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  i guess the 11 point hands with N/S will be passed and the 10 point hand with Lauria opened|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: restart|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s a point Jon, but will set a lot of pressure on partner|pg||
nt|sheila a:  so Egypt over-reaching at both tables and losing a lot of imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I think it motivates you when you have a negative :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: easy reply: it depends   lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Dutch men team definitely dangerous|pg||
nt|grebrof: I get some feedbacks on board 6 - if you have an agreement with your P you stick with that - so Fredins 3@h was probably in the system - which makes Fallenius the sinner - or ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: whatever: they lost the board - a tight match is what we want anyway - I seriously doubt that that board will be the last  questionabe decision made in this match :)|pg||
nt|bt:  i think 2@C was obvious|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as expected  on  6  Hurd opened 1@D and rebid 2@C|pg||
nt|shurik: if he chooses dble- they mite be on the way to 6clubs which fails with a heart lead and spade ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Fredid said some kind of quiet sorry|pg||
nt|djneill:  true|pg||

nt|jbennet: a clearcut major showing overcall|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mdgraham: thanks all - 16 USA1|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: +|pg||
nt|djneill:  will East go to game, if N-S had those hands they would|pg||
nt|shurik: another super thin 4h here for US|pg||
nt|jbennet: as can be seen 4h=10 aunt agatha tricks|pg||
nt|djneill:  lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: haven't heard about auntie in long time|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@c = noise = game try|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s can save in 5@C down 1|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: so they are being outscored 52-29 at the moment|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: was in RR completely the opposite|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS 1@d can be 0 cards - best defence to that is probably a natural 2@d overcall|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w save|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C down 1|pg||
nt|djneill:  again, E-W spurring N-S ever higher|pg||
nt|jbennet: since D west huge favourite to hold D ace, 4h hardly a game on a guess.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rv: bridge played at a fast pace here, 7 brds in 45 mins or so, they have another 90 mins to finish remaining 9 brds|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|djneill:  South likes that @hA and @sQ doesn't he|pg||

nt|rv: you meant Sumit or Sunit, both are:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  Yes Sumit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not the best lead for the defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence will probably take a diamond and two clubs on the go - so this looks like one off|pg||
nt|bt:  it could be that fredins 3@H was not as bad but merely foisted on him by system|pg||
nt|fluffy: but opposite 2@d he might want to show clubs to worry about hearts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fluffy: nystrom trusts @h3 encouraging signal and the defence quickly sets 5@h tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: ought to be good for -1|pg||
nt|bt:  they play their 2@C as weak in diamonds or strong, and maybe payed a huge price|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: "you passed in first hand" says Zagorin laughing to Nystrom|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: seems like they are all good friends|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: and know eachother very well|pg||
nt|bt:  they are team mates in the us|pg||
nt|bt:  or have bin idk|pg||
nt|grebrof: good lead|pg||
nt|bt:  anyway this hand is diffuclt, everything offside|pg||
nt|bt:  difficult|pg||
nt|bt:  mayde by N at the other table|pg||
nt|fluffy: the play is very straightforward, you have 8 top tricks and you have time for @s finese to the queen and also one more than can be @sJ or @hA|pg||
nt|bt:  made|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 8 tricks obvious but where is 9th? - |pg||
nt|bt:  all of which fails|pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 sp was probably shoe´wing singelton spade.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|runnerup: Hurd very optimistic|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: If I heard well, W said 2@d showed extra's and East said @D+@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: limited by not opening 1@c, but it does seem a bit gung-ho |pg||
pc|s6|pg||

pc|h7|nt|barnets: well that is 50 rather than 100 :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: Ace WEAKER lead than King|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ady: defense needs a forcing game |pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  maybe north cud have overcalled 2@C s on his his 2nd turn..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and already an endplay on S - if E can read the situation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3 rounds of @s and after that @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: when the @s doen´t break|pg||
nt|jbgood: only 1 undoubled in 4@s at the other table - contract on  23 right-handed even and played by N...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: doesn´t....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but isn´t that play rather obvious?|pg||
nt|shurik: well thats a better save since noone dbled|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this will be a cheep sac vs 4 @h|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|jaapfr vg: sure 1@C=16+ so 1@D max 15|pg||
nt|fluffy: diamonds blocked would let him make the contract even if west had @hAxxx, but @hAJxx is too much|pg||
nt|bt:  at the other table east lead a low heart to the 6, 7 and 9, after that declarer wasnt very unhappy|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  and pushed Lauria into 3@H|pg||
nt|rv: yes at some stage Mukherjee needs to shift to @CJ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 7 of diamonds for heart|pg||
nt|bt:  and if east has @H9 west would have been right|pg||
nt|fluffy: even if bathurst missed the switch he will have another time when in with @sJ|pg||
nt|bt:  so opening 1@C on 4135 and a 10 count, then declaring nt from that side was a winner|pg||
nt|fluffy: it seems a bit odd to lead hearts for fallenius, he opponets had bid hearts and not diamonds|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|fluffy: @sQ doesn't mean spades are 4-2, @sQ is a must card to play from @sQxx since its teh card known to be hold|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but the result was very close to par result.|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes good call, 3NT can be a fine sac with a running suit|pg||
mc|8|nt|ady: 5 obvious losers   but forcing game should beat this |pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has ducked the first diamond, but will get them later|pg||

nt|odysseus69: unlikely 3NT by North woud be winner|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  Yes, you'd have expected one of them to bid when they can make game, but neither had a clear bid at any stage|pg||
nt|mdgraham: A Sunday lunchtime pint is an old tradition in England|pg||

nt|odysseus69: ageist comments not PC David|pg||

nt|fluffy: perhaps true Jan, but you would remember a lor more the semifinals probably|pg||
nt|jacksond: thanks Victor. didnt realise you were a PC man|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but still cant make|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: if they find  J@D|pg||
nt|sheila a:  for a moment I thought S was going to play in 1@c on the 3-2 fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: N and east both trying to share candy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: bu³y oczywizda|pg||
nt|rv: Sumit opened 1@c with his better minor in 3rd seat, this bid might prove costly in play of contract since Bhabesh may lead a @c|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: a lot of kibs seem to be thursty though:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS have stolen this - still, not clear how EW find their heart fit|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: thx dragon1e ...|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: wrong quess|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: in the end they made peace agrreing 5c doubled is what would have happened lool|pg||
nt|barnets: and that is the likely def to 4@H Johan |pg||
pc|h3|nt|sheila a:  if N has to bid, perhaps he should bid the major|pg||
nt|sheila a:  I know it looks a horrible suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: North thinking a while before passing, now tells he had the option to transfer to @D|pg||
nt|djneill:  East can try to eliminate @h/@c and lead a @d to the 8 if North does not split, or maybe a third heart to hopefully South, pitching a diamond, but I don't think it will work, ikn fact North might just play a @d to end it all after in with @s|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: so they are back to happy for +50|pg||
nt|barnets: to beat 4@H west must play his partenr for @HKx or QX and misguess by dec|pg||

nt|grebrof: well, even if you get some lead, its not always a single|pg||

nt|bt:  all this mental energy to go one or 2 down, bridge is cruel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we are all NZ today|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: I am still here - so no breakdown :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: still S thinking|pg||
nt|bt:  thing is if the lead is a singleton, finessing is useless to make|pg||
nt|bt:  with a doubleton and @HQxx they most likely lead something else, unless 2 aces|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: S says "sorry" and is still thinking|pg||
nt|mikael_w: unless after @c-lead and duck Grue play @d to Q and a small @h from dummy. then Fredin might go up with the A to give E the ruff|pg||

pc|s2|nt|grebrof: well - its all for fun this anyway|pg||
nt|bt:  we are all morons but we se all the cards so its very easy then|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might as well play spade king first before taking stock|pg||

nt|fluffy: appart from @dA onside that is|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jaapfr vg: could be 3@H C|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and 4@C makes?|pg||

nt|sunsamvar:  or 4@D taking away all the space|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good hand for the system, that|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 27 good board usa|pg||
nt|odysseus69: surprisingly North did not risk 3S in open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well judged on both sides|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes|pg||
nt|barnets: Italy now down by just 5 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: some would open 4@h with west's cards|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lechcold: zauwa¿ylicie, ¿e nasz vugraf w ogóle nie robi ¿adnych b³êdów??|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: will North stretch to a strog club...yes|pg||
nt|jacksond: that is 40 unanswered imps to the slightly younger USA side|pg||
nt|fluffy: but the things are going well for US now, no need to create swings|pg||
nt|bt:  eh no|pg||
nt|grebrof: theres a lot of dbl-scores going the americans way now - not like the "lucky" slam/gameswings - for us playing this for awhile, 3 cuts to make a game/slam is not considered being ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: brilliant at most times|pg||
nt|bt:  40-1 lol|pg||
nt|jacksond: missed the 1 imp on board 10|pg||
nt|odysseus69: got to play 4S and not 3N T|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: tzn. 11-te|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 0-7|pg||
nt|barbyh: 8 tricks should qualify|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: if ew no noise here to 4@H-1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so much for a good board usa - lose 1|pg||
nt|bt:  that was huge 1 imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: wszystko idzie jakby to komputer wyk³ada³ odzywki i karty:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tak 11|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: czasem sie zdarza :) zauwazyliscie, ze jak przekazuje z pokoju, w ktorym graja Jassem i Martens, to Polska wygrywa? :)|pg||
nt|ady: quieter hand   20-20   and fairly flat|pg||
nt|panosk: spades win being nobler :)|pg||
nt|rv:  I presume Saha will pass here|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 2nt is explained as "Good-bad"|pg||
nt|fluffy: Jan we want to know if 2@h shows @ds or @s, can you see anything?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2NT is clubs but distributiona I suspect|pg||
nt|grebrof: another good thing about the usa now, is that they dont know if they are good or now, so they will still be aggressive|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: and Bathurst wrote "This is a bad competetive hand"|pg||
nt|fluffy: good bad meaning that he has a weak competitive hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok North opened 1NT so E-W should be thinking game, the way it has gone this time :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought Grue would upgrade to 1@C|pg||
nt|jbennet: No one knows had happened had fredin adopted the  rule "preempt 1 level below game" on the previous hand'|pg||
pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: and 2H might be spades but probably just a forcing bid|pg||
nt|bt:  some say that a team giving up less than 2 imps per board is doing well and will usually win, they both are here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Johan  you may want to expound on that rule|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphznx: chyba wiem w ktorym pokoju usiasc w nastepnym meczu na Wlochy :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 5 boards and 40 min, should be ok the director said|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@h 3@c 1@d?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: y 2@H-3@H made it easy in OR|pg||
nt|bt:  just barely|pg||
nt|shurik: grue can count 9 tricks and bid 3nt Johan|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lechcold: to prosimy jako tak siê ustawiæ na kolejne mecze, ¿eby ..no w³anie:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: I understand the the Open room has been closed down for a while - may be the reason for lack of comparisons|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3nt is diabolic|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns has most of the points but notrh now only passes -because he has enemy suits -still south active|pg||
nt|rv:  N-S pair O/C very lite, here they will play transfers, so 2@s shows courtsey/weak raise, 2@h would be good raise|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: if south has a weaker hand, he can bid 2@d (Multi)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Ah, I see - hearts 4-0 offside|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 2@S1@D1@H losers|pg||
nt|odysseus69: may "save"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphznx: Nadim almost passed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lechcold: znany i nie do koñca rozwi¹zany problem "pustego dubla" po otwarciu 1N|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: what a great PASS by N|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sheila a:  N perhaps too embarrassed by his initial @d to bid 2@d |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: helped by the 1nt W|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed  |pg||
nt|barbyh: amazing|pg||
nt|bt:  yea nice lead by west|pg||
nt|bt:  ;)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Nadim called director, but the play can go on|pg||
nt|runnerup: after pass 500 easyer than this -which can go down -Hurd missed that  -but he must have his reasons |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: if in OR also 3@H I will eat all cards ok:)?|pg||
nt|grebrof: Im sorry to say, but 3nt here is isrespecting your TMs|pg||
pc|s9|nt|garden2005: ja go rozwi¹za³em :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: -5 |pg||
nt|kamyk: OK, bêdzie mniej bola³o|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: it's about souths slow bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: North disagrees|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: North agrees :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Director is here, and he will wait till play finishes|pg||
nt|panosk: gd 2@S bid is 2@H?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fluffy: so 2@h is probably jsut a good raise, too bad for NS since the only making game between 3NT 4@s and 5@d despite all of them being reasonable is 4@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: needs a diamond switch now for defence|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fluffy: thx again Dennis|pg||
nt|djneill:  West shifts to dummy's short suit, @sxx|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: @d probably 5-5, so trumps will split|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i am sure Debbie Rosenberg will find it|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: North closes the screen to ask about the 1@D opening bid|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|barbyh: I'd like to see that !|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: is 3@H not a bit modest?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: if N can pass it|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: after 1@D she has a very good hand imo|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South had to bid 2S rather than 2H and maybe once West showed clubs and east raised hearts he should have tried 3S rather than 3NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: and this one is 3 down most likelly|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, lets see what happens after the 6 @DS|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Fredin will be disappointed to lose points for 4H-2|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I dont think he will run @ds|pg||
nt|fluffy: the problem is, there won't be 6@d, there might be 3 if you don't wanna lsoe your obvious chance of @sK onside|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: how should he win after that|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no problem for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: @s finesse or sneak a @c // I guess @s|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok - IF the @s finesse is on - how many tricks in @s?|pg||
nt|bt:  i think mathematics are only relevant as for making game or not, they are not bidding 6@S at the other table|pg||
nt|grebrof: 10 "for sure" - sometimes we forget that teams are about making the contract|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sheila a:  not much can go wrong here for declarer|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fluffy: the hands are fitting so well again, this time for NS, and nytrom will have no trobule making 4@h when trumps are 3-3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done|pg||
pc|c8|nt|barbyh: 5 loser hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: may make this if guessing KX spades|pg||

nt|sunsamvar:  what is 2@C then RV ?|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3-2|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: y but if 1@D 0-7|pg||
nt|barbyh: has to have specific cards|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - I have seen stranger contracts than this make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5 discards no problem for West |pg||

nt|ady: not now|pg||
nt|scotty: @hJ simply informative about hearts.  H2 (as played) should mean, "can stand @d shift" so maybe Debbie should have found it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: 1N made in other room so Sweden picks up only 5 on  10|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: An ace and a king is qute good for a negative 1@d though |pg||
nt|barbyh: on the cusp |pg||
nt|bt:  for sure but thing is when west has that hand there is no reasonable problem, none|pg||
nt|odysseus69: marked with 11 cards in his 2 suits so spade finesse not fancied|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry if its wrong partner ---- says S --- and take @sA|pg||
nt|fluffy: when did west show 11 cards?|pg||
nt|bt:  so 5 imps to the us|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2NT can be a competitive hand with hearts|pg||
pc|c6|nt|djneill:  West sniffs the air, shifts back|pg||
nt|shurik: holds to 2 now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|runnerup: defence slips here|pg||
nt|rv:  2@c is transfer to @ds|pg||
nt|fluffy: he can try the overtrick now playing spades|pg||
nt|fluffy: before clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rv:  all bids from 1n onwards are transfers|pg||
nt|ady: now can be down 2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: well, eve if the hearts had broken, North would still need the @DA onside - and from the bididng, it probably isn't|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think he played to fast tjere, putting the @cQ in was not the best|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|shurik: dont see the reason for club Q here- it was extra entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  11  Upmark bids 4N where Lall passed 4@HX|pg||
nt|djneill:  wow|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: wow indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  5@D undoubled with 100 honors ....   and i renew my medication|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d5|nt|fluffy: first test clubs aren't 4-0|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: phantom save 4@SX-2 bad luck|pg||
nt|barbyh: she could go down if east underleads her diamond|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so credit to North for a reasonable evaluation of her @sxx and @dJx|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|ady: defence cfashes 2 hearts and east gets of with a diamond|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fluffy: and now go for the overtrick in spades|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|runnerup: shoud have chanced to @h when he got 2. @c|pg||

mb|p|nt|garden2005: chyba nawet @hA nie wypuszcza|pg||
nt|lechcold: mo¿e i asem kier|pg||
nt|fluffy: the system says this should be opened in 2@c but its easy to see why he doesn't like it when 2@c shows 6@c 90% of the time or more|pg||
nt|hlortz: and those clubs are a bit thin|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garden2005: z dreszczykiem :) dla Martensa|pg||
nt|runnerup: so who knew which player was thinking|pg||
nt|rv:  North's double is support showing 3@h|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: psychologically it is fine to overcome a -16 imp carryover and leading after 32 boards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as long as you are still leading after 96|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: or being close|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: also true|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 121-33 Dutch men|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2NT was 2 suited - maybe 6-4 was possible but it felt like 6-5 to me and Berteau|pg||
nt|jbennet: thats how it should go.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: faktycznie trzeci trefelek czyma|pg||
nt|kamyk: na szczêcie atu 3-0|pg||
nt|shurik: i dont think he will pass 2h?|pg||
nt|jbennet: to bid over 2 h would be long term losing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: it was clear it was south, tray stayed long at SW side, and it was not a auction to think long for west|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: my site tells 45-109|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a:  W delighted that partner didn't dbl again|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 3@C for the third board in succession|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: 5-1 fit may do ok ... |pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the previous board - the jump to 4@S is fine, so maybe the 1@s overcall wasn't such a good idea|pg||
nt|barbyh: anyone know what 2 sp is?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: who I must believe?|pg||
nt|fluffy: I don't paly this convention but I thoiugh you also bid 2NT with 7 good hearts and 11-12 points or so|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1@D0-7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbennet: an automatic pass over 2h (for a player with good judgement that is).|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lechcold: teoretycznie chyba @SA jest najbezpieczniejszy (o ile mo¿na mówiæ o bezpieczeñstwie)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -so no use for those anymore -bad |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rv:  for academic interest, Versace wouldn't have relished playing in 1@s double, he will struggle to make 5 tricks:)|pg||

pc|hK|nt|rv:  even 4 tricks may not be there|pg||
nt|rv:  no one penalizes opponents at 1 level though:)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: looking at Note 2 on the CC |pg||
nt|barnets: to make dec play @HA @HK|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: South told west the wrong thing|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: but it didn't matter|pg||
nt|fluffy: best defence seems to me to force declarer with hearts|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|nt|fluffy: nystrom carefull won @hA to be able to return a low one had declarer got @hQ stiff|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: grue apologized when he saw the dummy, probably not happy with his own bidding|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well East supported hearts so presumably 3|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Fredin saying : i should given it more thought loool|pg||
nt|barnets: when south suggested he was going for a ruff west mishandled the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Lall laughing |pg||
nt|barnets: very nice play by south|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: the next set starts about an hour after this one finishes |pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: and ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is a large margin|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: pls stop informing me kibs sorry|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|fluffy: best defence I think was to win @cK and play another club, but that was double dummy|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphznx: on board 12 bathurst-zagorin missed the 4@h, so another 10 imps to sweden|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at least with 4@sx in the other room on the last board, Jaap doesn't need to go fetch the ketchup |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: why ketchup:)?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|c5|nt|grebrof: this match maybe gives Zia a little drawback in his theory saying that you should be playing +60% of the contracts - the swedes have not been lucky this session anyway|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rv:  I remember SA beating Italians in QFs of BB a few years back by playing unconventional bridge|pg||
nt|psyck:  the other room is even faster than here, thay are all eager to attack the lunch room|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: in the quarter finals they play 6x16 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: today and tomorrow 3 sessions of 16|pg||
nt|hlortz: so 2 full days then|pg||
nt|fluffy: it will be a long trip to the semi finals|pg||
nt|hlortz: as gonzalo said the heart tap is going to beat 3@S for sure|pg||
nt|fluffy: can't see what alternative is grue thinking about, if you don't ruff you get another heart for sure|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps thinking with @sQ to enter dummy?|pg||
nt|fluffy: in north is balanced as the bidding shows|pg||
nt|fluffy: the he probably has @sJ10 stiff|pg||

nt|jbennet: now west more or less knows p have x spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: how so? |pg||
nt|sybarra: no real clue yet|pg||
nt|jbennet: because with 5332 or 5422 it is not likely that east would bid freely on 4 level..|pg||
nt|jbennet: not 100% sure of course but a strong indication that east is not balanced.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: N lurking in the bushes with the 4 @S bid |pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: and 2 @d was? |pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  could have made it if he cashed the A of @S after the A of @C's.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphznx: South said surprise when he saw 3@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: so this balanced had 5-4-3-1 in it ok|pg||
nt|sheila a:  straightforward 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: THANK YOU! :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  they were running|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sheila a:  this is the last round of qualifying for the quarter-finals|pg||
nt|mdgraham: immediate transfer. One weakness with 2NT as transfer is that you might not know the fit if South raises North's suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: pass|pg||
nt|fluffy: they play Negative free bids over double, will they play them over 1@s also? |pg||
mb|3S|nt|jaapfr vg: i miss 3nt bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: here East has seven diamonds, so that doesn't apply, but it might on other hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'd expect at least Axx in diamonds for 3NT|pg||
nt|barbyh: dont see how she can sit for this|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3nt bid W is to me selling same hand 2x|pg||
nt|barbyh: right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and, perhaps, slightly better spades |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and might put E on the wrong foot by passing now|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I bet East will pass|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: mb operator will UNDO the 3nt:)|pg||

nt|rv:  for Indian fans, Seniors team is winnign match 23-7 vs Egypt, just 6 VPs less than last qualifying spot at this stage|pg||
nt|fluffy: some artifical bididng, I think 3@h is asking aprtner to bid 3NT whatever he's got and so he did|pg||
nt|hlortz: @D bids dont really mean much at tis table lol...|pg||
nt|fluffy: this concealed the spade suit from south, but nystrom didn't care, very good lead|pg||

nt|fluffy: 2@d sames game forcing values with diamonds|pg||

nt|ahollan1: patient died|pg||
nt|shurik: one of those hands that you have no clue if they have game or not|pg||

mb|p|nt|fluffy: bertheau has to pick between biddign 4@s or bidding hearts so that partner can make a good decision later|pg||
nt|fluffy: he picked the straightforward spades wich worked pretty well|pg||
nt|fluffy: defence might promote a trick in diamonds if declarer missguesses, but that's only the third trick for the defence|pg||
nt|fluffy: thx Henry|pg||
nt|hlortz: to gonzalo [fluffy[ for great analysis and to bbo for putting this on 5 sessions more to come - i am off to bed 330am here in seatttle|pg||

nt|ahollan1: which begins in 1 hour 25 minutes |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|runnerup: yes east passed with 4 @s -his partners suit and south passed -both had surely other options too -so missed |pg||

nt|odysseus69: declarer marked with heart 10 so might as well play 2nd heart|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry lars, wooldridge bid 3@d but nobody was courageus to double it|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I am not absolutely sure what matches will be on BBO -- but they will all be interesting :)|pg||

nt|barnets: tks traian- all specs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rv:  teams not qualifying here can play trans-nationals from Mon onwards|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: zapraszam na dwa wystêpy polskich dru¿yn mêskich o 16:45...w jednym nawet bêd¹ im robiæ zdjêcia:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: if E plays another @h, it's likely that South will let his partner ruff to maintain control|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|fluffy: thx Jan|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv:  losing QFs in all events can join trans-nationals from 3rd round on Tue onwards|pg||
nt|yuval10: now if he plays @c .... it seem like 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fluffy: superb job all day|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West might have tried spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: and tomorrow will be a "long" day for us BBO operators|pg||
nt|bt:  west indicated spades with his hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: after the quarterfinals finish ---- then two rounds in the Transnational will be here on BBO|pg||
nt|bt:  anyway great thanks to the operators, without them nothing is possible|pg||
nt|odysseus69: key moment|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 2 rounds of 10 boards will be sent from Transnationals|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can he possibly find spade|pg||
nt|fluffy: will be hard to pick a table, there are 150 teams I've heard!|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: and we will finish the transmissions from Veldhoven at about 11.30pm tomorrow evening (or night)|pg||
nt|bt:  west did play @H6 then @H4 must have spade king|pg||
nt|bt:  why else play like that|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good point but I still feel that a spade was a better idea|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: all teams that might loose their quarterfinals have a chance to play in the Transnationals too|pg||
nt|bt:  its mistrust not to play him for spade king|pg||
nt|bt:  or just not concentrating after a gruelling 31 boards today|pg||
nt|bt:  lol|pg||
nt|fluffy: trusting or not declarer has shown 17-19, that's why he needs to think about it carefully|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: A of @ss is in the middel of the cards in the E hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: a @d in front|pg||
