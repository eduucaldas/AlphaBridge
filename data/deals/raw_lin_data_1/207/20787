mb|3D!|nt|yo_yo: why would you do that unless you see all the cards?|pg||

nt|rmb1: I was wrong about adverse vulnerabilty silencing EW :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: because it is close between the precentages of an intrafinesse and leading towards the Q|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|runnerup: some misunderstanding perhaps|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: the 3@D response was constructive, with a bust he would have bid a lebensohl 2nt|pg||
nt|hlortz: dummy's trump are a bit disappointing but we can see that the aggressive style from usa2 has paid well --so far|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||

nt|rmb1: South must have something for her double: so North could play a trump to @HA|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c9|nt|odysseus69: West has to hod her cards up and of course not fly with q of diamonds- oops|pg||

nt|ady: 4@S   - 1     against 4@H   making|pg||
nt|szalay: but why not 3N with 9 top tricks and halfstoppers outside?|pg||
nt|kit: North would never sell to 4@H|pg||
nt|nkgupt: @h suit likely to get burried under a flurry of @s's so tend to open lighter w/ @h's|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT would be an interesting shot by North, I admit, but I doubt if it is a percentage action.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|ady: 4@S as voluntary action a surprise|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: here normal handling in 1s lead to 12 tricks in @h (or nt ,but that is wrong contract)|pg||
nt|hlortz: well suit quality of weak 2's has gone down over the years|pg||
nt|wstuart: A common treatment is to play 4@S as a strong single suited hand after a weak 2 opening.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hlortz: martel will likely buy it for 4@S -1|pg||

mb|p|nt|nkgupt: good auction to be in a nice percentage slam|pg||
