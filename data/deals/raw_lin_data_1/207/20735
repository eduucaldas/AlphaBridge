nt|xenya: but he opted for a natural bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what about a good practical bid|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D shows one of the major suits|pg||
nt|ady: Nortj will be very surprised its spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt=Lebensohl|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT with stiff king not usual|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Herbsts play Nat, Acol based, Major 5, better minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@C natural but may be a two card suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Traian.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: dzieñ dobry (jeli to "polski pokój")|pg||

nt|lechcold: witam|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Victor|pg||
nt|lml: hello|pg||
nt|lml: this auction is following the same lines as in the Open Room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it is Stansby taking a pause here|pg||
nt|lml: the trick will be the opening lead against a 6 level contract by north south|pg||
nt|panosk: gd morning to all|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT  leb   3@D direct would be forcing to game I would think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We have some huge technical problems with the PC and internet connections here in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: SORRY for that|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We are getting some technical assistance- and will try to be back very soon |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we know you are doing all you can Jan, no worries|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And the bidding on Board 18 in this room went |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@h opening from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@h (preempt)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass fromN|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pass from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: then N bid 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: going down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he took the pass card out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fallenius may cue bid 4@S|pg||
nt|hlortz: both sides can make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: a relatively peaceful hand, for starters?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  EW CC: http://tinyurl.com/66ttlf5|pg||
nt|szalay: wd u reopen as West?|pg||
nt|barnets: playing 3N in open|pg||
nt|kit: Pachtman knows his partner is short in hearts.  What he doesn't know about is the club fit.  But he can see 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South in the tank|pg||
nt|barnets: same bidding in open south passed|pg||
nt|kit: if South finds a 4@C call, North can reasonably bid the slam.|pg||
nt|kit: But bidding 4@C is a pretty big position I think.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and likely pass here too. S has no bid for that matter.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is still thinking|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can't NS make 6@C?|pg||
nt|kit: of course they can|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: i might have overcalled 1nt as east|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bulgaria bid 6@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Round 10 and Israel are performing well while Bulgaria are lower in the table than their recent form|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the dreaded xxx opposite xxx as stopper- 3H from West should show values|pg||
nt|xenya: this may well make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|desinka: hello Panos:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@C GF relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: apart from the hcp he has an empty hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south with both majors(though weak) is strangely silent|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|ady: it appears the contract n/s is 6@S    not all bid in 1 go|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: dzien dobry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Then ???  3NT - Pass???|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: @sA in hand|pg||
nt|xenya: which is likely|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR they led the @SA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and N still dont know what majorsuit S has|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he passed slowly :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lml: its fun to watch my friends play from Canada play the talented Israeli pair|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and why not?|pg||
nt|lml: do you think Stansby should double for a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|lml: is it possible to figure this out?|pg||
nt|ady: north must still think hearts south suit|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps he should get a small bonus for thinking :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol true|pg||
nt|roswolf: t/o dbl of hearts|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lechcold: ze Szwecj¹ nigdy nie by³o ³atwo i czêciej oni nas lali ni¿ my ich...zobaczymy|pg||
nt|lechcold: witamy naszego vugrafa:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Barel chose the natural option|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is not so clear as a cue bid, not sure the intent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IMPs for Netherlands from carryover of head-to-head match in Round Robin|pg||
nt|gracelin: China is behind by 37 imps but there are 48 boards to go.  So all is not finished yet.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ryskiel_: witam w kolejnym dzisiejszym meczu, ostatnim|pg||
nt|ady: 4@D down 1 on best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Bulgaria at the moment in 9th |pg||
nt|ady: must set up 2 heart tricks before clubs are established|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so they would need some VPs to get in the top 8|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: "You often have singletons opening 1nt?" asks S|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziñ dobry - witam w przedostatniej rundzie RR - dru¿yna polska spotyka siê z reprezentacj¹ Islandii|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Vladimir|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: theoretically this should go one down, 1 heart, 1 spade and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now doomed for 1 down in 5D|pg||
nt|hlortz: pass or correct type bid perhaps with 5@D in reserve if needed|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Traian|pg||
nt|hedyg:  NS CC: http://tinyurl.com/67anzfx|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 2@S is likely move now|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C a better spot for NS.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South is still a junior, don't know his age exactly|pg||
nt|panosk: gm Dessy|pg||
nt|panosk: gm Pim|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: gm|pg||
nt|oosmanb: losing 1@H and 2@C should be very quick for sementa|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: action to start with :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   one window per table|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that was aggressive|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphznv: West: i should have passed 2@h when he puts dummy down|pg||
nt|jbgood: so that explains the double:)|pg||
nt|panosk: it was easy that will make it easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3nt could have been a bit difficult to defend against, might need to overtake @C Q and lead a @S through|pg||
nt|olegario: not much can be done, they have gone a bit too high up|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Olegario...welcome|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now the defense is easy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hi olegario :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: both sides have great fits   but both limited to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Never says W and laughs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: E agrees // we newer has .. did I have one :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphznv: declarer claiming 12 tricks -- but Versace rejects - only 11 tricks he says|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@C shows 5+ @H , 10+|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they have screamed for club lead so no chance of anything else|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, seem like a flat board to me|pg||
nt|olegario: Hello skaftij :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like a crazy double to me, getting a diamond ruff wont set 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant on its own, he does not know about partners spade ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: K@C out diamond switch and spade ace and again diamond|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: Lindop has to rise on a spade to the jack now|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS's system card: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Australia/edgtton-gosney.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a kib tells me he is only 19|pg||
nt|desinka: seems|pg||
nt|hlortz: i woud have thought south would bid 5@C 2 way bid make or cheap save|pg||
nt|hlortz: best lead!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my point was fredin does not even know one club is cashing|pg||
nt|hlortz: very true|pg||
nt|hlortz: takes @H ruffs to beat 5@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: lead should sign post the correct line|pg||
nt|gracelin: surprised that Madala is not bidding at all with 5-4 major and 6 pts.  NS seems to be making 2S|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed patrick but need some imps back early i feel|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe too much wine last night!?|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure, Geoffrey, a most difficlt task, but not hopeless.|pg||
nt|roswolf: so much of this game is momentum thus giving you a feel good factor|pg||
nt|gracelin: however, with clubs not breaking, EW can't make even 1NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I saw him in the bar last night, but he wasn't drinking alcohol|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphznv: 4@c showed that N has a 3-5-5-0 hand and minimum|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N has described a weak 5530|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as with Round Robin,  all matches in all events playing the same boards|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: is Madala still below 18?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lechcold: M-J graj¹ silnym treflem przed parti¹, WJ po partii|pg||
nt|lechcold: bêdzie trudno wybroniæ siê mniej ni¿ bez 3|pg||

nt|jbgood: 2@h was 8-11, that is why S dared to double 2@s|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Baldursson playing quietly in 1NT so first blood to Iceland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Quarter Final & Semi Final matches  96 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: all going swimmingly|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah team discipline is good then maybe just drinking the npc's brand of coffee|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ryskiel_: USA 2 ogra³o W³ochów...jak poradzi sobie z nimi nasza dru¿yna?|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he has 8 tricks and very hard to find the 9th lol|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lechcold: na drugim stole Buras-Narkiewicz vs Hurd-Wooldridge|pg||
nt|ady: defence got of to good start  so down 1|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: maybe not ... I guess he will still come to 2 diamond tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Brink presses on|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can ruff 3@C in dummy |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exiting first hand // a gameforce relay bidding here - and an Ice-relay bidding in then open room|pg||

nt|ady: good save against 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: N's decision to play 3N rather than 4@S with a 4-3-3-3 shape is understandable but quite unlucky|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Markku|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi vladimit|pg||
nt|xenya: note that 4@S makes despite a possible @D ruff|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: director here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i will explain everything at the end of the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director in the room with us|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ashley advised Cornell that a card is not turn the corect way|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and the swedish boys called the director|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: a nice start to the match with a grand slam :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i stand corrected: 4@S does not make -- sorry |pg||
nt|gracelin: south just need to keep 2 diamonds to gold declarer to 6 tricks.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c7|nt|panosk: may make 6|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we could be in for a heady ride Jan :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jorgensen playing 3@D North|pg||
nt|xenya: also a likely make, so this seems a partscore swing for Iceland|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  As Hedy posted earlier. http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ is the link for video|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was non-force, so Drijver 2@D either 4+ or extra values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surpised Brink didn't bid 3@D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphznv: yes:)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  hello all|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and just before the match started Drijver said that I had to turn on the heat in the room|pg||
nt|boedhy:  exciting board to start with indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess thats not needed just now :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Ruud and yes indeed Iceland have also bid grand|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can you go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Ruud|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not as they lie, but you could have on Qxx trumps offside|pg||
nt|boedhy:  you cannt draw trumps i think|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah iceland went down after two times trump|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and Iceland went down 1 in the closed room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll back Drijver to make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Brink has just given his partner a glass of water |pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes he is a very good declarer|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah so now he wants teh heat turned off...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbgood: Fallenius will have no problems in winning 3 @c - S may even get squeezed for the overtrick|pg||

nt|oosmanb: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|olegario: this should be a flat hand, nothing exciting expected|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if they score heart ruff then he has pitch for spade loser on fourth heart|pg||
nt|szalay: likely game for N_S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=Forcing  16+ HCP unbal, 17+ BAL|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i wonder how it was made|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and declarer accepts 11 tricks // I dont think he should have|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was my fault...so you can blame me :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yet more action on this one|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H is not a terrible contract but it wont make here|pg||
nt|szalay: can they bid it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=a) 0-7 HCP  b) 8+ HCP, 0-1 controls|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w are low pn hcp and therefore shouldnt go too hign|pg||
nt|roswolf: *on|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: Hi all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: 11 tricks looks ok for e/w|pg||
nt|stoffers: So, Italy has started in great fashion (as usual), but iceland has some work to do|pg||
nt|lml: 5@C probably can't either|pg||
nt|lml: well double dummy you could draw one trump|pg||
nt|lml: and ruff the fourth spade|pg||
nt|xenya: i think both contracts are makeable, DD |pg||

nt|roswolf: the precision base also shpuld excel|pg||

nt|bobholl: 4@H is too difficult :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S seems straightforward abd they are unlikely to get too high|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: 1@H was a bid of convenience for West|pg||
nt|lechcold: nasi w 3N s¹ tutaj|pg||
nt|olegario: a double is to come soon|pg||
nt|ady: can make 12 tricks in hearts    but would be scary|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup very scary|pg||
nt|ady: sure they will be content with game|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S would be off, losing 2@H+@S+@C=4 tricks for the defence.|pg||

nt|odysseus69: an alternative route is for East to raise NT - the xxx in clubs suggests a problem which existed|pg||
nt|lml: well we might find out about whether Martel can make 5@C in a minute|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is pretty double dummy but maybe he will find it|pg||
nt|xenya: still the bidding just  might put S |pg||
nt|lml: to make 5@C you draw one round of trump and ruff the fourth spade in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: on the right track|pg||
nt|xenya: in 4@H|pg||
nt|desinka: now |pg||

nt|gracelin: sme West may cobnsider this hand suitable for 4D over 1S to show a strong 6-4.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: south might have bid double |pg||
nt|jbgood: both these pairs play transfers after 1@c .... and some more|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't alert 2@C|pg||
nt|panosk: many advocate 2@D 1st and then double if u have to|pg||

nt|ahollan1: wijs-muller   playing Tarzan Precision  also reached 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our EW pair play  Ice-Relay  aka  Icelandic Relay|pg||
nt|barnets: trump lead will beat this |pg||
nt|kit: key which suit Levin leads.  If he leads a club, I don't think 3@H will make.  If he leads a diamond, it will make.|pg||
nt|gracelin: still others may want to try 4C Splinter|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but sensible bridge is the order of the day on most hands if you get some freakish distributions then comes the time for flair and imagination|pg||

nt|skaftij:  hard to infer that East can have this hand from EW Convention card|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: but I suppose the vulnerability was a disincentive|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: does 1@h show a 4 card suit?|pg||

nt|gracelin: everything breaks normally here but declarer must be prepared for worse scenario.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: but this, i'm almost certain, won't make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a 2nt bid as at the other table would have helped a lot|pg||

nt|panosk: 3@S was an overbid in my opinion|pg||
nt|ady: this likely to be down 2|pg||
nt|kit: In theory declarer can recover by playing a second club cutting communications, then AK of spades dropping the queen, a second trump, and be able to ruff fourth spade.  But that ...|pg||

nt|lml: 1NT was balanced showing less than a strong notrump|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that's why it was asked, also if spade suit could be there|pg||

nt|kit: which is what he is doing -- remember, he can't see all the cards as we can.|pg||
nt|gracelin: spade to J, then 2 high D and D ruff may be good.  North could ruff the 3rd D to stop overtrick|pg||

mb|3N|nt|desinka: and Al|pg||
nt|ady: best spot appears to be 4@S n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N debating between stayman or transfer. Stayman better imo.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h down on the trump break - but N will save if they bid it?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  a very good lead from Brink played this game down with any other lead it will be close|pg||
nt|ady: I would think 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice splinter|pg||
nt|gracelin: the opening makes it less appealling for EW to bid a slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: so just 2 imps on 2 wildish hands|pg||
nt|ady: typical Sementa opening in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||

nt|boedhy:  for both teams still alot at stake|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make 5 here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am assuming he wont risk heart ruff by playing for club ruff|pg||
nt|gracelin: Leaving to their own, 6C is a reasonable contract.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but of course, not making here.|pg||
nt|roswolf: true and making 12 tricks might be iffy|pg||
nt|gracelin: this shud be easy enough and probably 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphznv: Versace claims 12 tricks after the lead -- they are playing quick here |pg||

nt|oosmanb: South will correct to 2@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@D not so bad (last hand) but may be a bit tricky due to 4-1 @D|pg||
nt|runnerup: this secvense helps to let 4 @h -make easyly -south has all cards -also 3nt|pg||

nt|gracelin: the lead maybe referred to as Canape lead.  You bid your longer suit but lead your shorter one.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: the bid worked out well|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 3@S from north  6 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy off to amazing start winning 96 of possible 100 VPs|pg||

nt|desinka: yes, agree.. but now Martel's p may think abt @ds fit..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you know how Martel-Stansby treat 4th suit after jump shift?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@s is still safe double dummy I think|pg||
nt|kit: no I don't, Al|pg||
nt|panosk: looks it wont make|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The Netherlands offcourse the higher the better because then you get to pick your opps|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Muller made 4@S on  2|pg||
nt|ady: this could be very expensive   spade lead and diamond through|pg||
pc|c2|nt|boedhy:  as we can see 4@h is close tho...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and in natural bidding you can end in @h and with 16 opposite 8 think many will be in game...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but a @h lead against 4@h is killing too|pg||
nt|alnanda: yes 4@h is posible altough hard way to make|pg||
nt|ady: that lead wont upset declarer    but any lead likely to be good for south  except maybe a low spade|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Oosman, Jan:)|pg||

nt|andersk: Looks like down, even if he gets the sp right! |pg||
nt|andersk: EW only has to avoid dummy to get entry to the 3rd and 4th sp|pg||
nt|xenya: had N chosen to advance more slowly (5@C?), they might have stopped in 5 |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure what a double of 4@S would have been, but maybe similar to the double of 3@c earlier, saying "i want to bid on"|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think with making 3@d is a good result|pg||
nt|ady: will be enough on best defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: now the spade switch|pg||
nt|ady: Semenra will do better not to cover the high spades|pg||
nt|ady: diamond from west  devasting   3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a big opportunity for china|pg||
nt|ady: could be around down 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bell tolls for someone|pg||

nt|udo: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: still 2-0 -- i think it will be a record across the matches on those boards|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Italy-Netherlands 0-25 on the same 2 boards|pg||

nt|ady: 6@H might fail|pg||

nt|ady: would be unlucky|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 @s + 3 @h are a risk to open 2@s weak|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=limit raise or better   2N=strong NT|pg||

nt|barnets: 3@D israel in open|pg||
nt|ady: but 3-0 heart split and needing a club ruff may be too much|pg||

nt|lechcold: 1N 18-20|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D is a spade raise- exactly what this promises varies from partnership to partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East doesn't accept|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so bidding is as displayed, only North doesn't see it yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pushed to North now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North has to decide the final contract now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does 4@H need @s guess or no?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1H showing @ss|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Wijs did not enter with @h bid on bd3, allowing Einarsson to support with 2@s iso 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and tends to be bad hand for slam|pg||
nt|stoffers: some might bid 2@d on Duboins hand here, me included. He may regret it now when partner leads clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Same lead in the OR.|pg||
nt|wild card: hi|pg||
nt|wild card: this looks like a makebale contract|pg||
nt|wild card: *makeable|pg||
nt|lml: this may work out well for Israel|pg||
nt|lml: pretty aggressive bidding by this team so far|pg||
nt|xenya: and how|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR Weinstein overcalled 2@C instead of doubling|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict some 14 imps to Israel on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: MArtel has found a book|pg||
nt|lml: its a style thing but the club suit looks pretty weak to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and has started reading in it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't pass, but the tray wa spushed to the North side already|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and North bid already and SW saw it when the tray was pulled back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director walked away, i Didn't hear his ruling..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Tray is at WestSouth side now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Think director went to get some help|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nd director here: they said it's more complicated|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the meantime i go for a coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Norths 3@S is treated is as a bid of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: without screens|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East can accept 3@S or let the tray go back to Fredin|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East asking what the total consequences ar|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west passes, north bids 3@s and auction proceeds as normal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west doesn't pass, then if north bid @S's (at any lvl) south has to pass 1 round|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: If west doesn't pass and North bids something else than @S south should pass the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|andersk: interesting 4@H here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: same here :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: china lost 3 imps on bd17 2@S-1 by the chinese south in the other room|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is unlikely to misguess H position now.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south also has a tough lead.  3 Aces and a singleton trump, all unappealling|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: 4@C isn't giving east any problem|pg||
nt|lml: he liked the stiff spade and the club fit|pg||
nt|lml: so will south cuebid the @HK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=shortness|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so were back now..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And we are back live now|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Board 18 was a 4@c down 2 in N|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well done Jan and thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a 4@s making on board 19|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes well done Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Now we are LIVE again - and 2nt showed a 3 or 4 card @s support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice to see some totally natural bidding :)|pg||
nt|xenya: so Sweden are off to a flying start in this match -- very important for them  as they are currently 9th, closely followed by Australia and Japan |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ashley in the tank now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Muller did bid @H:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  5 @s is not easy to make without a @c lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bidding defensive does have downsides too|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer needs to use his high trump to play the red suit.  Club can be led from either hand.  So better win and start a red suit.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|boedhy:  think this will go down so 8 imps or so to iceland|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and thanks 350 specs for hanging in there with us :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a great start for the "hometeam" |pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes and an important match it is. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|star6ija: Trendafilov will attack hearts now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is asking questions at moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW lead 2nd/4th against suit and nt     upside down signals focusing on count|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so we have to wait and see|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds 3-2  and hearts 4-4   this should roll home|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say, @D to the Ace, small @D ruff, small @S to the Ace and another @D ruff, @S to J and @D ruff and @SK. Do we get to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I cant see the title of it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South annoyed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  there is.....|pg||
nt|boedhy:  strange bidding form south 2@c round forcing|pg||

nt|hlortz: hello Lars yes sweden has picked up a few so far|pg||
nt|xenya: 8 teams qualify for the quarterfinals -- and this is the last round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similiar situation here|pg||
nt|kit: scary stop when vul 3NT is so close.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: after Levin put the cards down...North said YOU HAVE SOMETHING :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|ady: have stayed out    have done well   may get a swing|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  well with the odds|pg||
nt|gracelin: when north can only contribute S6 on first trick, south shud know declarer's trumps are all high.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: here the KJ of clubs are waste paper- |pg||
nt|boedhy:  if you end up 4th you will get the best team form 5-8 as opponent for instance USA1|pg||

nt|boedhy:  can he read the 5 he should|pg||

nt|runnerup: there is a way to put a @d loose away so take care of @h by dummys trumps -but now -after @c lead there is no way to go down |pg||
nt|xenya: now, of course, EW may find a save in @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @S only 3 losers    and  that's ok in 4@H|pg||

nt|lml: 6NT by north can go down if the spade and clubs are offside|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely ruff and would bank on @D finesse, whick is correct.|pg||
nt|ady: in fact sorry this is down 2|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have the club pips to restrick to 1 loser|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: from south 6@C is better |pg||
nt|lml: with the @SQ protected|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North had a chance to double 2C but resisted - |pg||
nt|xenya: -1 on the lead?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think 3@s will make also|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have only just come back from a week-end away, so I don't even know which teams qualified.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: indeed me too another 7|pg||

nt|ron_sc2002: and the defence made the same to beat 5@H|pg||

pc|c3|nt|jbgood: N showing confidence in prd's discards|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: as the cards lie of course nothing can hurt a grand|pg||
nt|jbennet: think west is thinking of guarding agaist sp 5-1. (if they were then winning the lead in dummy had been fatal).|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: but roofs coming in hurt less when it's just 50s :)|pg||

mc|11|nt|udo: should be only 1 more trick for versace|pg||
nt|ady: setting up a 3rd diamond trick in case spades break badly|pg||
nt|ady: if east eventually enters with 3rd round of spades to west hand and runs J@C   south can win and playQ@d  sett up the 10  but no good to east who has 4 clubs|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: ale roznie zapiszê bo ciekawe|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes South doubled 1D in OR- even you and I would have doubled David - old and conservative as we are|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|lml: Stansby took a reasonable shot single dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ginossar asks if its possible to play a little faster|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: almost played one hour and only 5 boards completed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and with 5@c going down good result i think for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Last night I spoke with the icelandic pair in this room for some time|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they had a testmatch some time ago against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and did they tell anything interesting..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and was beaten quiet heavily|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another fast one|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe the will get an early dinner today:)|pg||
nt|bt: i get lots of messages but i cant comment on all, but i try :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: any rubber bridge players out there??|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW play 15+ - 18 1NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: well, north threw a trick, yes|pg||
nt|athene: he could have kept @DJ and the heart winner|pg||
nt|famus: Hi all|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: rozdanie of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|barnets: dec lost a spade ruff |pg||
nt|gracelin: Guess this East hand qualify for good 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if south had ventured 2nt over 2@H that might have pushed EW into 3@H-1, but it was a bit hard with a 3 count|pg||
nt|antoniz: wietne szkoleniowo|pg||
nt|ady: problem for north  if he does double 2@C   then they will reach the making game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6D doomed but where will this end?|pg||
nt|barnets: in 5@C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ron_sc2002: 2NT maybe is a fit-inv|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi overcalled 1@H as expected|pg||
nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
nt|ady: possible to get overboard   but 6@D should fail|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, I was disconnected and missed that competitive auction. I will look at it via the MOVIE button.|pg||
nt|barnets: he had it made by not finessing clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: but took club finesse and lost a ruff|pg||
nt|yusufb: oda bole hareretlimi|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: 2NT transfer @C ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: transfer to @C.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well then 1nt is obvious:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: I would call the north hand a mixed raise ... 2@D suggests a limit raise to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt = @h fit|pg||
nt|udo: looks like:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: invitational values|pg||
nt|udo: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: explained from Versace to Masood|pg||
nt|ady: around 1NT  loooks likely|pg||
nt|wild card: what's the range of 1NT?|pg||
nt|lechcold: wejcie hmhmhm...graniczne:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some play that 4D =D and H|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that Fallenius failed to take Lars' advice and show his second suit - paying the price.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@c = majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: East knows of only 8 trumps between the hands, but may take the push to3@H on a 5-5 hand. |pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D looks a likely spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: if east bids of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, uncontested 1@H-2NT is limit with 3 or 4 cards; clearly a raise here too|pg||
nt|lml: its pretty close between the two choices|pg||
nt|famus: Hello Udo & William|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N=12-14 EXCEPT  3rd seat vul = 15-17|pg||
nt|wild card: thx|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but not here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North said "content"|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: more spades from west|pg||
nt|lml: a lot more it appears|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hello all|pg||
nt|stoffers: Rising with King best now|pg||
nt|stoffers: Hi there Denmark :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sort of :-)|pg||
nt|ady: off beat pre-empt has caused havoc|pg||
nt|runnerup: here also a nt game sits|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no ok   north likely considered his hand to flat to look for anythin more than game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1nt opening is 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but maybe N didnt like his distribution 3343|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: is this just club values or a game try?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Game try, I suppose.|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  a make     5@S   a save non vul against vul|pg||
nt|ady: or 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: Pass is clearly forcing in this situation|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: E with 6-5 will bid again|pg||
nt|ady: I meant for n/s   but e/w got there first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  And in that board we see the other site of Brink bidding a daring 5@c drove the opps to high|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are a very good pair never the less|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they are pleased with the way there are playing in the tournament so far ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so the Iceland team knew this would be a VERY VERY difficult match|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: why not 3@C instead of 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: = and so far they were absolutely right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Skaftij types faster|pg||
nt|kit: Either way, West has easy 3@H call.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door North expressed his happiness|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 2 down after perfect defense (2 club ruffs) will lose an imp for Sweden|pg||
nt|bt: well commentators all of us suggested @D bids, but he is the one playing the world championships so ...|pg||
nt|andyv:  1     ITALY  3582   NETHERLANDS 342    USA 2 3424   ISRAEL 314.35   USA 1 310.56   ICELAND 308.57   NEW ZEALAND 2998   CHINA 295.5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Swap West's black suits, so his K-Q were assisting partner's help-suit, and he might have gone to 4@H.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin said 3c was game try... and said I havent seen you rejecting a game try in 3 years loool|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has limited dummy entries -- but if South leads a club that will make his life easier.|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe due to the 5-card major.  Some still reject to open 1NT with a good 5-card M|pg||
pc|d9|nt|famus: has to sac|pg||
nt|athene: versace's pass over 5@S clearly encouraging his partner to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N has bid 6@s|pg||
nt|udo: sacrifice is successfull, but not so clear for me|pg||
nt|famus: EW different league--to say the least!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now Lauria thinking again|pg||
nt|udo: if he bids 6 @S,,wd|pg||
nt|star6ija: complicate decision for Martel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Aronov will open 1N and Stefanov will bid  so  nobody stopping in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like..he is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D down 1    but difficulty for north to do anything|pg||
nt|star6ija: no...Stefanov will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- does DBL now show 2@D?|pg||
nt|star6ija: they play 14-16 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|jbgood: Bermuda Bowl running scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|ady: 14-16 no-trump I am told so even more reason for north to just go to game|pg||
nt|brolucius: Always a good idea to bid NT as soon as possible with a balanced hand. Here North rebids 1NT to show 11-14.|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks like a normal 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Weinstein: i almost bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but an ok spot has been reached|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andersk: this should be another fast board for makeing maximum partscoore|pg||
nt|hlortz: good result ew in OR here |pg||
nt|xenya: EW in trouble now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|star6ija: I expected this bid|pg||
nt|xenya: a club lead beats 4@S...|pg||
nt|lml: I am going to guess that this hand wont be played that quickly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when opponents have the ranking suit, show your second suit, when they dont is less important|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice brings both minors into the picture|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Only lived in Denmark last 31 years, being an Icelander|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well i think you want to be in 4@h with such strong @h|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a lot of bidding by EW, but this will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N scramble?   i.e. no preference|pg||
nt|szalay: sure|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: 3 clubs a possibilty   but not obvious for north with small values|pg||
nt|lml: North-south can set up a diamond for a club pitch now|pg||
nt|xenya: but naturally enough, a @D has been lead|pg||
nt|lml: Just to make it clear to a few who asked.  On a club lead you win the club and you cant set up diamonds fast enough|pg||
nt|lml: east-west keep leading clubs and will set up a trick before you can get a diamond discard going|pg||
nt|lml: on any other lead north-south can play diamonds first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s lead|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will make this |pg||
nt|boedhy:  the @h are also helpfull in 3nt offcourse|pg||
nt|boedhy:  1@s 4@h 2 in each minor|pg||
nt|runnerup: little under point -but makes like it is -something to play and bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh yes, with 11 losers and x-x-x in the help suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: all laughing|pg||
nt|kit: I think declarer will use his one and only dummy entry for a club finesse.  That works, but he will have to lose 3 trump tricks for down 1.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: so you think it is right to give up on making the contract kit ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table|pg||
nt|kit: South has a problem here -- he can't be sure his partner has only 3 spades, unless they always bid higher with 4.|pg||
nt|barnets: rather than try to make it|pg||
nt|kit: why does that give up?  Can't somebody have Ax of hearts?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes Ax hearts is good enough|pg||
pc|s3|nt|udo: parscore reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: he cannot afford to leave opps here as far as 2@d could be made as well as 3@cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct   Aronov-Stefanov NT=14-16|pg||
nt|antoniz: +1 imp|pg||
nt|lml: a diamond lead makes it a piece of cake :0|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4@h-3  in board 5?? Might be entered wrong|pg||
nt|bt: in the open room grue was very aggressive and paid a heavy price|pg||
nt|brolucius: The top 8 teams in the round-robin, at end of play tonight, will enter the quarter-finals of the knock-out stage.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|famus: wd--wonder whether the other room wud b pushed to limits|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be hard to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: ok, might be harder now|pg||
nt|athene: lauria doesn't know his partner has quite so many clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry lost connection|pg||
nt|ady: taken the plunge     looks like 2 spade trricks and 2 diamonds     |pg||
nt|panosk: still talking about last hand privately sorry :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: anyway the 1S opening let them stop in time.  Seems to lose nly 1S, 2H and 2D, but maybe 1 3rd D.  Declarer shud have covered DK|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: Baxter is heading to dummy for a diamond pictch on the heart  and a spade play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exactly!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so he does not have to take the @d decision|pg||
nt|lml: there may be a trump promotion on a diamond play now |pg||

pc|cA|nt|athene: but still i think @DK shift is ok|pg||
nt|athene: if the @CQ got covered|pg||

nt|odysseus69: what action over 3S? double or 4H?|pg||
nt|ady: would you not prefer double  than 4@H Victor  and then possibly bid  diamonds if partner responds clubs?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzer rightly suggests that West should think again when 4H is doubled|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this works on my computer|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a cunning low @s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are 4th, you usually find yourself with some stiff opponents that none of the other top 4 wanted to face.|pg||
nt|kit: Well, this sure isn't what I expected|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bt: this is a soft result by ew but bidding game and making it was not in the cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Can someone post the web-address for the ruinning scores?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|skaftij:  nope|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: @CK asked for count there i would imagine|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Should make comfortably|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to go wrong in defense - but Fallenius thought it through|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, will just make now|pg||
nt|ady: that at least gives a chance of reaching a good spot   or possibly 3@SX|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont think so, I looked at bidding and it seemes like Fredin Falleinus had a misunderstanding!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oops|pg||
nt|jbennet: DD 3NT unbeatable.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but east doesnt know it. |pg||
nt|runnerup: east is worried that 1s are not 3-3 .that is one problems out of fju|pg||
nt|jbennet: awkward communication problems. |pg||
nt|jbennet: east doestn know that NS is unable to take 3 d tricks.|pg||
nt|jbennet: west..|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- if he cashes @CK now and crosses to @SQ to take two clubs, what will he discard from dummy? |pg||

nt|brolucius: Thanks to the kibs who sent me the link.|pg||
nt|xenya: so this appears to be a poor line|pg||
nt|jbennet: if he cashes club ace and enters hanf with sp Q then no make.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|nt|lml: so no problems now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes prefer double but I have become modern??? and play 4D=D and H|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lml: it is terribly hard to see that a diamond would help from the south hand|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has a chance to make it even if south ducks the club as many you suggest|pg||
nt|lml: but probably wont|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: small @d lead would have been great by N|pg||
nt|lml: baxter can throw a club on the heart and guess diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is now a push|pg||
pc|cT|nt|boedhy:  @d back costs a trick|pg||
nt|jbennet: good shot so far .|pg||
nt|gracelin: if he ruff spade first he can establish a spade winner to discard one of the losers.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wild card: in the other room, west raised his partner to 3NT immediately|pg||
nt|wild card: a good bid in my opinion although we can see 3NT won't make on this board|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: now declarer "knows" @Ds are 3-3|pg||
nt|panosk: E will be worried momentarily about a @D ruff but he soon be relieved|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|brolucius: New Zealand are the only real surprise in the top 8 at the moment. Well done to them.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|star6ija: first blood US, unless Aronov steal 8th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but with the @s with open is understandable otherwise you can see the 4 @h in hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|famus: so they get the max|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: Levin figures South has to help him out.  And in fact all this may work.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North thinking now|pg||
nt|brolucius: North wondering whether to ruff (and play a diamond)|pg||
nt|kit: But may not be good enough -- that 7 of hearts is a problem perhaps.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kamyk: @D D nie nowinna byæ w pe³ni liczona przy ocenie, czy mamy na inwit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tap tap |pg||
nt|gracelin: now declarer needs to guess the trump.  Lead HQ maybe, when south already showed SA and DAJ10|pg||
nt|gracelin: this way is also good. not touching trumps at all|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am quite sure declarer is now making.  Well done, Lian.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: can bring down K@H in 3   but cant play a spade from north at the same time|pg||
nt|stoffers: and if declearer had the T@s Sementa would have been squeezed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|ady: that would solve the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D9 looming large|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Baldursson can survive en passant|pg||
nt|skaftij:  even if spade tap|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stoffers: check that score operator|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he claimed down 1 , saying sorry for misplaying @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: for now i dont say anything...|pg||
nt|stoffers: oh, wrong claim|pg||
nt|stoffers: correct|pg||
nt|boedhy:  9 tricks at the end|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that site works folks so use it instead of the official|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jbennet: he might try heart Q after the spades.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|skaftij:  ah|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|jbennet: if so then South ducks and then ducks again on the 2nd heart|pg||
nt|xenya: @DK now for -2 |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Would Drijver think for a while with Queen?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's ruff with his higher trump is called an 'uppercut', The aim is to drive out a higher trump from declarer and perhaps promote partner's trumps.|pg||
nt|kit: simply forcing declarer to ruff was enough -- Levin loses control, even if he plays 10 of hearts here.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: spade favourate now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  probably same result at the other table....Muller playing?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jbennet: if north discards a D|pg||
nt|xenya: tap tap|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bt: they deftly added a norwegian, but isnt NZ focus elsewhere this morning?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: more imps to italy|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|jbennet: now moment of truth.|pg||
nt|xenya: now he is down to a @H guess|pg||
nt|runnerup: imps chances in bunches  in this match|pg||

nt|ahollan1: live scores  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011   remember to refresh screen to get updates|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: discussion in bulgarian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i do not understand.... :(|pg||
nt|boedhy:  as you can see @d back not best defence|pg||
nt|boedhy:  another good result for Brink Drijver...|pg||
nt|ady: likely 4@H|pg||
nt|andersk: Falleinus probably tried to show equal length  majors, and passed 4 @H and Fredin probably took it as somethin else|pg||
nt|bt: for the british isles i can inform there is a rugby WC ... :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: This site allows you to look at the leaderboard in all three events (links at the bottom of the page:    http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|kamyk: gdyby to by³a @S D...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 boards in 75 mins is painfuly slow|pg||
nt|xenya: still down but only 1|pg||
nt|xenya: same idea|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Sorry, wrong claim at first|pg||
nt|roswolf: -3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: smolen and 4@S i guess, here|pg||
nt|wild card: by staying somewhat lower, south africa gained 3 IMPs, getting the lead in this match|pg||
nt|barnets: that was a flat board same result in open|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: losing 2 clubs and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|bt: not that u guys care about that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  and is forcing|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rnmalik: 4@H a likely contract for NS and makeable as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however 5D should not escape from a double|pg||
nt|jbgood: very good result for the Aussies here|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The youngsters (ok 30) are among the top 5 in the world|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s looks makeable but deeds some guesses|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: time penalties are looming in this room|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphznv: West noticed 4@S was cold last board|pg||
nt|boedhy:  are they in @h that plays better|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, South had a heavy 2NT available, showing minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another doubled contract made in the open room|pg||
nt|runnerup: spades must be handled -by odds ,but @h must be ducked once -and then you have chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, some cunning system :)|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they play some convention here..but they will end in 4@S|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: I am not really sure what 2@D is maybe forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am recording the rugby, so no scores, please.|pg||
nt|bt: and grue lall decided 7@C was good here|pg||
nt|brolucius: 30 points but the hands do not fit too well, and the cards lie poorly too.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - since N had no entry to give prd a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Ah de Wijs made an uptrick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they in NT also 1 imp|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looking at that scoreboard the first 6 temas are pretty save..|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes N 5@d doubled|pg||
nt|gracelin: Chicken, I expected 4S|pg||
nt|roswolf: so did i|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||
nt|lml: seems like we have found the actual auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now for east; what shall he do with 1@s bid in N?|pg||
nt|lml: still should east bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking.......by E|pg||
nt|wild card: the four diamonds in the north hand make it liekly for partner to be short|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and you can see why in these 6 boards|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: przy okazji wyg³osi³em pogl¹d (nie do zrealizowania), ¿e cz³owiek najpierw powinien byæ dziadkiem  a dopiero potem ojcem |pg||
nt|garden2005: dzieñ dobry wszystkim :)|pg||
nt|kit: North will be thinking slam after this start|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: four spades is not too far off actually|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AQ@C and @S Ace nicely placed. Key cards for the contract.|pg||
nt|jbgood: brb|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a @s lead did nothing to embarass declarer|pg||
nt|bt: aha rugby is tomorrow, the nz team hopes for bridge and rugby at that time|pg||
nt|xenya: another opportunity for NZ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but this has scored a goal methinks|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS can make 6C if knows to drop Q, In reality, making 5C will be a solid result|pg||
nt|gracelin: and 3NT is equally good.|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow they might get there now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||
nt|lml: not surprised east thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
nt|antoniz: czeæ Grzesiu:)|pg||
nt|jbennet: is 4 sp really makeable against best defence??|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
nt|ady: unsafe balance for north in my opinion|pg||
nt|xenya: at last an easy hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like south bid 4N as to play|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah there is some low level bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, it's tomorrow.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, we are away for the week-end and I set the recorder.|pg||
nt|garden2005: mamy potencja³ i naboje?|pg||
nt|runnerup: now @h possition is clear -so helps to play|pg||
nt|gracelin: actually 4S maybe doubled for 800, but might also push NS into reaching a wrong contract.|pg||
nt|roswolf: it cant cost south to make one voluntary squeak ans bifddding 4@C gets them to the races|pg||
nt|roswolf: this certainly does|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ady: east I feel only woth an invite opposite    but west would have accepted|pg||
nt|ady: is this also 14-16 no-trump Jan ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 15-17|pg||
nt|oosmanb: board 6 has some interesting auctions at other tables|pg||
nt|andersk: Better cash he's 6 tricks, If he looses a club trick early he might go 4 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems to North that his @s will not be pulling weight|pg||
nt|garden2005: no jak teraz @h? siê czuj¹|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tak Grzesiu...niestety naboje co drugi lepy|pg||
nt|kamyk: chyba nieporozumienie: Gawrys przyj¹³, ¿e 3BA, to m³ode|pg||

nt|brolucius: 3@S is stronger than 4@S and promises some values (at least one control somewhere).|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: the law of the total trumps :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 trumps for NS...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm, can you concede tricks that you cannot possibly loose?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he wrote -100|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Don't know the law too well|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nor really, but operator or players watching arent to say anything |pg||
nt|xenya: you can make 6 here -- but you don't want to be there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  aggresive but controled bidding,  combined with perfect play and some luck :)|pg||
nt|ady: thx   15-17   but even so vould be facing a poor heart holding   west has a nice toppy hand with good hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: Hi David and Lars! I can assure you that the kiwi team has the right focus on today's matches:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seven would have been fine if south had diamond ace rather than KQ|pg||
nt|bt: how did england do? wales was 4th i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: When North cannot cue-bid in hearts, declarer will know of one hole in his hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  but...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  4 imps to Iceland probably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then is thin though with only 8 trumps|pg||
nt|brolucius: The text-books advise you not to bid a grand if there is any chance that the other room will miss the small slam. They also have some advice (I forget it at the moment) about how ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: many aces you need for a grand slam.|pg||
nt|garden2005: w ocenie od zg³aszaj¹cych mi na priv Kibiców, Gawry nie mai³ na 5@d|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -partscore board ?|pg||
nt|jbennet: how is 4sp makeable?? |pg||
nt|skaftij:  1@c Relay Precision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D looks like a checkback |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sry|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't see any reason declarer should guess to drop HQ doubleton offside.|pg||
nt|roswolf: impressive bidding judgment -truly World Class|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphznv: Duboin picked 3 times the 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|famus: can he hit @cs?|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW play sound 1 openings|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2NT ask and Alfredo now bid 3NT, max no shortness|pg||
nt|lechcold: po tym ataku no problem|pg||
nt|odysseus69: notice that Zack did not get carried away and bid only 3S where others might have bid game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West trying to speed up, they are 2 boards behind|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South sorry, think for being slow|pg||
nt|bt: anyway i think lall bid way too much at the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think it has come up yet   EW  1st discard = odd/even|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW leads  2nd/4th|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think South should be showing any encouragement -- he has a dead minimum 2@C opener|pg||
nt|brolucius: North thought he was too strong to sign off in 4@S, with two kings in his hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: playing 3N i open after south rebid 2N|pg||
nt|roswolf: italian flair patrick:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: let's see :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stoffers: If one of the pairs finds out they will ofcource correct the score|pg||
nt|kit: This is a good example of control bid crazy, when controls aren't the problem.  Tricks are.|pg||

nt|xenya: well N had passed over 3@S -- no reason to be clever now i think|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see the other auction by putting your cursor over the Open Room result.|pg||
nt|bt: unless their firm agreement is that 5NT in all auctions is "pick a slam"|pg||
nt|runnerup: you lose 1 @s -1 @h -throw one to @c k -and 1 @c ofcause|pg||
nt|xenya: especially as he should know @Hs are likely to be 3-3 for his side|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now they surely stop in 5@S.|pg||
nt|roswolf: in practice this may well be the decisive hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|famus: a natural @s lead -wont get them anywhere|pg||
nt|ady: if this lead is from length the 9@C will ensure only 2 club losers  so the game depends on A@D right|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphznv: 3@H = 15+  5-5 , rest goes without saying|pg||
nt|stoffers: Duboin knowing about a diamondlooser now (no 4@d)|pg||

nt|ady: tricky defence here|pg||
nt|ady: need to win A@S   andplay 9@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 9 tricks whatever defence does- cant get club ruff and 2 heart tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  alot of comment on this remark.|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  can't win this without help from defense|pg||
nt|kit: they should, but it is too high.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: protecting the @DK on the lead doesn't really help EW any|pg||
nt|jbennet: even if taking right view in spades and hearts no way to handle the 2nd heart loser. |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czy Volva produkowane pzrez Szwedów s¹ te¿ sztuczn¹ metod¹ robione?|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: tylko nie w pika|pg||
nt|garden2005: jedne z komentarzy do rozdania: "mia³ powiedzieæ 4@H  a jak P ma m³ode to przeniesie siê 5@C na 5@D  a tak to du,,,,,,,,! " :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: North would of course bid 6@S with the @SK.|pg||
nt|kit: Better I think to find out if you have strength for slam at 4-level and worry about controls at 5-level rather than other way around.|pg||
nt|barnets: would you rebid  2@S or 2N with south hand ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Close.|pg||
nt|barnets: 2N is the winner|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: once south plays the clubs he now knows he has the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well spotted David|pg||
nt|ady: got the first bit right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might well find H9|pg||
nt|ady: still not that great a game even with a suitable hand with west|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: games that win are good games :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Here North was able to ask for key cards, so there was no problem. Sweden gained advantage from their spade pre-emption at the other table.|pg||
nt|kit: I agree close -- either could work out.  Probably 2NT a favorite on balance.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North said : do not go down in 5|pg||
nt|kit: Granted 5@S somewhat unlucky to go down.  But with better bidding they wouldn't have been facing the bad luck.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Give North the other black jack and it would be not so bad.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: for example if partner has the @DA and you need to set up a spade and have declarer misguess diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moysian fit = 4-3   is this Mini-Moysian  or is that 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: a swing of 25/26 imps |pg||
pc|dK|nt|famus: wud he duck???|pg||
nt|ady: 1 trump out of the way|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|stoffers: 6 (lucky) imps to Iceland on bd21, they take what they get against opponents like this|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think i wouldnt have passed with north although i opened light|pg||
nt|barnets: yes the @CJ needs to be a spade|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: nowhere to put the diamond losers anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find that duck|pg||
nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|kemperg: he knows @CA with partner, so @DA on leader|pg||

nt|jbgood: but still a big gain for Australia|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: actually maybe it was not that hard|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|runnerup: maybe -too dfficult -because rigth 2 @s to defence|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|lml: he can probably afford a heart now for the uptrick ... we know it will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S had @s 4 in his hands to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  6   Muller in 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: this is a big swing for usa|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: East was unable to read the opening lead of the @S9.|pg||
nt|xenya: think i'll get coffee|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir must b cursing himself for not switching @ds--this is turning into a rout|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Better :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes sorry|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that it matters.|pg||
nt|bt: decl has 12 easy tricks now and a bundle of imps to sweden|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: if his partner has the @DA, the contract is always dead|pg||
nt|ady: should be in game   but I dont feel east should be the one to deccide if there an invitational method|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lml: or a spade|pg||

nt|lechcold: prawdopodobnie Szwedzi nie byli w stanie zbadaæ co maj¹ w treflach|pg||
nt|runnerup: so no attack to Nyström for pushing ns to game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director in the room ....we will not finish all the boards i think|pg||
pc|h5|nt|boedhy:  but then west at some point would have bid his @s and making 3 is no problem so think this will be a push|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: i think i missed somethink|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: something|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may all hand on the meaning of 3NT. If that is serious or non-serious, that would effect how strongly North should bid - whether he was worth going past 4@S with his second ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: king.|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer believed king of spades is singleton he might have had a double-dummy line to make on trump end-play.  But Levin could easily play king from Kx.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: On a lucky day you would make 6@S; today you go down in 5@S.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: and if declarer has the @DA, it is clear that playing ace and another trump just releases control and allows the diamonds to run|pg||
nt|ady: club ruff coming soon|pg||
nt|ady: needs to ruff high|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup cant understand why he didnt draw a 2nd round of trumps|pg||
nt|ady: if they are in a position to draw a 3rd round would go down   had not developed enough tricks|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: this is very often a problem for the defence - whether to draw trumps or not|pg||
nt|lml: declarer in 4@H makes an easy 5 |pg||
nt|barnets: like the belladonna hand v Kantar|pg||
nt|roswolf: wd|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is one trick short to exercise the show-up squeeze, when West need to keep his D and discard one Heart.|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer will get a coubt on the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: count|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: when declarer is trying for a ruff but has a threatening side-suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: and underleading or ducking the ace of trumps is often the key|pg||
nt|ady: diamond play has helped declarer|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|star6ija: this appear to be dreat swing for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|star6ija: great*|pg||

nt|barnets: in 7@C|pg||
nt|barnets: very similar idea|pg||
nt|barnets: well spotted|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Bocchi didn't like that|pg||
nt|roswolf: as a apec says wonderful bid ,sorrowful end|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: because of the director call they got extra time|pg||

nt|boedhy:  2@s pp d p2nt 3@s all pass|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I just have been asked to turn off the heat again|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: "Super" said Brink / and started singing "Super Trouper" -- "is that from Iceland" he then asked :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Yoou must ask Drijver if his hormons are bothering him :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :) Jan being worked hard'|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: No its not -- its from Sweden -- ABBa|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and then S continues singing --- I think he is a better bridgeplayer than singer|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I cant see exactly what Duboin wrote|pg||
nt|brolucius: The young USA2 team is some 30 VPs ahead of USA1.|pg||
nt|bt: sweden might play 3@C in both rooms here|pg||

nt|ady: but not neccessarily making     lay out bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H would be strong game interest, nothing about @H|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2@d shows maybe normal openning... or long suit game try|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   busy here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the bulgarians like the red cards|pg||
nt|ady: as usual   honor 10 of  suit in dummy when leading the Queen|pg||
nt|panosk: key place is 8th that leads to quarterfinals but its early to say|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no spade lead.... |pg||
nt|skaftij:  It is quite a task, both to operate and to comment, you are doing a great job Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i was wondering why he did not discard the heart loser and looked into his hand and was missing lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: all bids are alerted|pg||
nt|gracelin: China recovered 13 imps on the hand EW stopped in 3NT with their 30 HCP after south opened 1S.  Italians went down in 5C in other room.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|stoffers: Good operator, thx|pg||

nt|oosmanb: wow probably 6@C now|pg||
nt|andersk: good bidding here. |pg||
nt|xenya: Sweden and NZ are currently neck-in-neck, with Japam trailing by 1VP|pg||
mb|3N!|an|forcing|nt|wild card: but after this start that will be too hard|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, NS pushed EW to the 3-level|pg||
nt|kit: Levin's aggressive preempt keeps N-S out of spades -- but that is good for N-S.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D did its work.|pg||
nt|kit: But still probably unable to make 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: do they?|pg||

nt|skaftij:  :-)|pg||

nt|szalay: trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd/4th leads mean  LOW from worthless doubleton|pg||

nt|skaftij:  Your profile says otherwise|pg||
nt|antoniz: dwie|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@d aldo suggests a singleton somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: a hard slam to reach but I thought they might|pg||
nt|lml: south has to do something other than 4@h I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: too difficult to find out that either of them has enough entries|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lars, you have any idea of how/why West should bid 3@C? Did he pull the wrong card from the box?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes sweden had a misunderstanding looks like 2@H/1@D[precision] was michaels as many play 2@D/@d as natural |pg||
nt|bt: they play some 2 Major jumps as 4 of that suit and a longer minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H showed hearts and another suit or at least that is what west thought|pg||
nt|bt: west played that convention|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usually best, I find, to treat 1@D as natural initially - even if it may be short.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever of the US North to keep quiet on his amazingly good clubs.|pg||
nt|bt: they only played together for 10 yrs, har to get (1m)-2M right :)|pg||
nt|bt: hard|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer ducks to break communications between West and East.|pg||
nt|kit: In other room Fleisher violated and opened 1@H on the strong 4-card suit -- to his regret, as he wound up in 3@H.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: one of the good things about passing is that you are not defending 4@S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Anders we spoke too soon|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ends in 5@s|pg||
nt|xenya: now it should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  7  Weinstein in 2N West|pg||
nt|boedhy:  So his hormons could be bothering him|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: do you see my profile as Jan?|pg||
nt|kit: At both tables E-W were temporarily in 3@D whih doesn't make.  But very difficult for N-S to know that.  That is why preempts can be effective.  Even when they seem to get you to a ...|pg||
nt|kit: bad contract, they can still work.|pg||
nt|barnets: if east shifts a club dec may make the hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will play for hearts 4-2, because of the 3@D bid, which leaves West with more non-diamonds than East.|pg||
nt|kit: How can it ever make?  4 hearts, 1 diamond, 1 clubs, 2 spades at most I think.|pg||
nt|barnets: by takiing 4 heart tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: Looks like it.|pg||
nt|barnets: and enplayinq west in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Then 2@C showed @C + @S|pg||
nt|ady: made in OR    chance for China|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't see 6H making on this one.|pg||
nt|roswolf: north doing a lot of bidding - i would have given up on slam long ago|pg||
nt|gracelin: he does have a standard 2 opening and south gave a raise.|pg||
nt|gracelin: also some sign of life with the 3NT bid (rather than 4H).|pg||

nt|barnets: no we play a low spade from dummy at end to our 9|pg||
nt|ady: then clear diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: i don't think he will be able to finesse clubs now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he claimed 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: overtrick??|pg||
nt|star6ija: but they are going to be back shortly as far as I know Aronov - Stefanov simpathy to the higher levels|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but it was me who did not notice that on the king of diamonds \e played the ten |pg||
nt|ady: diamonds played for declarer by defence  so an overtrick last hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: maybe he played the Jack of Diamonds instead of 9|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but did you watch the tempo|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no really they are very very good|pg||
nt|barnets: west wins the 10 and is enplayed|pg||

nt|lml: the reason that the slam works is that north-south dont have quacks they have controls|pg||

nt|ady: souths trumps not high enough to defeat this|pg||
nt|roswolf: he may have been better ducking the first diamond altogether|pg||

nt|barnets: not an unreasonable play|pg||
nt|ady: 10@D  signled  entry higher ranking of sensible suit    |pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: a possible alternative was to finesse the @CJ earlier, before knocking out the second spade|pg||

nt|boedhy:  very quick play so far|pg||
nt|ady: e/s have a slam|pg||
nt|oosmanb: probably some "polite" words being exchanged in Italian now|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: director back in the room|pg||

nt|szalay: no|pg||
nt|szalay: small trump|pg||
nt|szalay: after cash AK|pg||
nt|kit: end-play for down 2 and a push|pg||
nt|ady: still 10 back for China   keeps them in the hunt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: and canada went ahead ... but with a lot of luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 10-12 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: they bid spades which was not the best slam|pg||
nt|lml: but the suit broke|pg||
nt|antoniz: Pawe³ to normalny kontrakt|pg||
nt|bt: ns took 10 tricks at the other table in clubs, and gained 5 imps, strange game this|pg||
nt|brolucius: A close friend of mine, Marc Smith, was coach to the young Thailand team in a recent world championship. (They had to practice in a  nearby horse-racing stadium, due to lack of ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: facilities). His great moment was when his proteges defeated Meckstroth/Rodwell's USA by a good margin!|pg||
nt|szalay: and 3@S, a ruff and 2 trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st seat favorable  1N=9-12|pg||
nt|gracelin: Something must be wrong there. China kept on giving Bocchi chances and Bocchi gracefully rejected everytime.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: comes up a lot, generates swings|pg||
nt|athene: NS might be in a lot of trouble now they have gone past their 8-card fit|pg||
nt|pawel90:  wolalbym 5@c graÄ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable means  you not vul   opponents vul|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2M=M+m (54),|pg||

mb|d|nt|lml: well done |pg||
nt|lml: to get to slam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: indeed, nice bidding in open room|pg||
nt|udo: 2@D or 2 @H ?|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a make e/w|pg||
nt|panosk: gd result for Sweeden a bit fortunate too|pg||
nt|runnerup: this will be another push one way or another (3 @c=) |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|vugraphznv: blame me |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: Weinstein did it well in board 7...almost equalized it :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a lesson there about signalling with card you can't afford to play|pg||
nt|ady: another part score hand   clubs likely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the rest of the play correct...except the ten instead of the 5 at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is thepressur of thecBB QF|pg||
mb|4H|nt|wild card: fleisher showing a 12-14 hand with four spades, I presume|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For NS 3 NT can make.|pg||
nt|boedhy:  board 24 again sorry to say but a very good result for the boys|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: on this board David or ?|pg||
nt|ady: thats 7 tricks in the bag|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: How strong is it asks W|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could have made it tho...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S answars "Usually 15-17"|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Jan, you could give Sementa a piece of paper to alert and explain his statements :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Very aggresive 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|kit: Double is responsive I believe.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C 12+ points and 3+ clubs.|pg||
nt|ady: playable 4@H   but does not make|pg||
nt|ady: could be some more imps for China|pg||
nt|gracelin: and Italy in other room also went down in the 4S that need a good guess in Heart which became easy after south's double.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 6NT isnt terrible.  It just needs the spade finesse|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not easy to see which line is best but ruffing 2 @c in dummy was possible...|pg||
nt|szalay: I prefer to play this DBL rather 'cards' than pure penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: will end in 3 NT, i think|pg||
nt|famus: well this wud certainly propel them higher than desired|pg||
nt|boedhy:  10 opposite 11 and a quick 9 tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes 3@s down one|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could have been another 4 imps |pg||
nt|boedhy:  and those boards tend to add up...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I dont think thats a good idea at the moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8  playing Tarzan Precision  Muller passed 1@S so Einarsson balanced 2@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Not the best dummy you saw|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand  doubleton @S led thru Q to partner's AKJxx|pg||
nt|kit: That will get E-W to hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: COME BACK   FANTUNES -all is forgiven|pg||
nt|gracelin: so China is only down 17 and there are still two slam swings to their favor.|pg||
mb|d|nt|wild card: I see no reason for south to try something, at most 24 points in the combined hands|pg||
nt|wild card: and I count only 8 tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|wild card: on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|ady: likely to end in 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: but cards dont lie very nice|pg||
nt|famus: 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ lead would be very nice|pg||
nt|skaftij:  and reached it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@C  gazilli,  2@S less than 8  no 3@S|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@c = 15+|pg||
nt|lml: but of course this is the normal contract|pg||
nt|xenya: but very tough to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Running scores in Bermuda Bowl http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881 |pg||
nt|skaftij:  and agressive 2@h bid here vul |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: correct score on 24 now|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@C= means that 1@C should be 3 down|pg||
nt|runnerup: no -they will get + 150 -200 now -wd|pg||
nt|roswolf: that dbl looks  a tilt double|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will be better off to take out this|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wouldnt|pg||
nt|gracelin: his opening was shaded and he has distribution.|pg||
nt|gracelin: on perfect defense, the decision is 790 Vs. 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Martel's 1@S showed either 5+@C or some shortness|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: or natural|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Brink will struggle here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if north played 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he'd either open 1N with 12-14 or rebid 1N to show strong NT|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1 spade and 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ok some play in 3Nt here|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H is safe.  3@H treacherous.  4@H, reached in other room, hopeless.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|antoniz: Swietny wist|pg||
nt|pawel90:  na czesciowke z kontrÄ w atu. teraz bez wielu.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but @h are friendly, @C ace is on|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but he might try to find J@S instead of playing on @h 3-3, lets see|pg||
nt|xenya: lack ot entries to dummy though|pg||
nt|bt: looks like a nice game but on a diamond lead it gets difficult, south is under a lot of pressure though|pg||
nt|garden2005: ja wiem, ¿e Kalita i tak by wygra³ - pochwali³em Jonssona za skrócenie rozdania i za ewentualnego impa|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: (nice for declarer, i mean) :)|pg||
nt|ady: can set up the hearts    but no entry with clubs 4-2   so should make just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl this link will work i'm told|pg||
nt|sybarra: hoi Ruud and all |pg||
nt|boedhy:  hoping to get off for 2 down or so..|pg||
nt|brolucius: This affected the draw for the KO-stage and in fact allowed England to progress to the final.|pg||
nt|bt: fredin is famous for leading aces against 3NT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|famus: tuff transportation prblms|pg||
nt|athene: probably heart lead now, ducked|pg||
nt|udo: great lead,,,,,,,amazing how often they find best lead|pg||
nt|famus: duck 100%|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: GREAT to watch such leads :)|pg||
nt|famus: dont blame NS to be in 3NT--how much they go down is moot|pg||
nt|ady: if west played 4@H  a trump lead may beat it|pg||
nt|boedhy:  sorry have to go back in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: non vul so no worries really|pg||
nt|szalay: 8 of @H is mighty card|pg||
nt|xenya: well this makes -- but you need to pull out the right card each time you are on lead|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lml: this looks to make with no problems with the clubs working|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 4-1|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Hi Sybarra cover for me..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: E had @h A in his hand - puts it back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do not know why|pg||
nt|gracelin: there is no way to misguess on this one and Shi is a very reliable player.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|athene: 500 here without much bother; that's fine when your game is touch and go|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you lose 3 imps if they make the thin 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they should know their defensive signals at this level|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not easy to see that he could play a @h back...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i tend to think this lead would work more often than any other|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C was a worthwhile bid because it might allow North to complete to 3@C if he held three clubs.|pg||
nt|gracelin: anything but a spade return may see 990, with all dummy's spades going on the good clubs, after 2 round of trumps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|bt: the thought here is that if you want to beat this kontrakt, A@H has to "work" for the defence|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a 'failed Stayman' auction, where responder looks for a major and does not find one, you should favour a major-suit lead. Don't worry that responder has a major. Worry instead ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that declarer will be well-stocked in the minors. |pg||
nt|bt: odds changes slightly when one of the opps hands are very strong like here|pg||
nt|bt: declarer will go to dummy, take a spade finesse and aouth will eventually be squeezed down to his underpants|pg||
nt|bt: south|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have just written a book 'Winning Notrump Leads', with Taf Anthias, where we analysed (by computer) opening leads after a variety of auctions ending in NT. That was one of our ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: findings.|pg||
nt|hlortz: just give w  fewer @H and one more @C say and the lead would be a great success|pg||
nt|brolucius: After an auction of 1NT - 3NT, it is nearly always right to lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even 10-x in a major is better than K-J-x-x in a minor.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fallenius is thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better to win?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table Grue led the @D4.|pg||
nt|bt: fallenius knows partner has nothing else, maybe @DJ|pg||
nt|bt: yea at the other table south was pressured on 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he ducks woolridge will eventually have the option of throwing him in with third heart|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely South knows from the bidding that West holds @HQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would not lead the ace from A-J-x-x|pg||
nt|bt: he must place partner with @DJ thats when there is a possibility to beat this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might but wont continue with jack|pg||
nt|runnerup: but ew seems to make 3nt also |pg||
nt|xenya: and club shift helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8  deWijs playing 2@S West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jonsson was endplayed at trick 2|pg||
nt|szalay: right card means = pull trumps and play finesses?:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: during the pause   i think it significant to note that  all 6 USA teams advanced to KO|pg||
nt|szalay: all we know for right penalty double needs 8 of @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in Bermuda Bowl  4 of 6 European Teams advance|pg||
nt|szalay: 4 from 7|pg||
nt|szalay: Holland is European, I was told|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh that's right  extra team for host country|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those with very short days this time of year   Iceland, Netherlands and Sweden all advanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Israel and Italy   --  i miscounted  5 of 7|pg||
nt|szalay: btw|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: east south Jan   making a joke|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ahhhh -- I did not understand that :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: he should make an uptrick on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|szalay: Israel is european, as well|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: but sometimes you gain 12 when it goes off|pg||
nt|athene: those are good odds for just taking the money|pg||

nt|psyck:  You can also find live scores in this link: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Duboin promissed 6@H, 3@S and 15+ points|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ryskiel_: zaraz zaraz co tu siê dzieje?|pg||
nt|ady: seems K@H lead may beat it now  exceot north may later be squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not everyone will open on East which will make it tough to reach game - pass and double Norths 1nt response gets to hearts but maybe not game|pg||
nt|sybarra: one sec and will come back  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S made so Netherlands double partscore pickup on  8|pg||
nt|ady: doomed |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|oosmanb: nope @h straight away!|pg||
nt|gracelin: declareris of course worried about a 4-0 trump breaks.  But he will soon find out it's not the case.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but he might misplay because of the "pressure"|pg||
nt|gracelin: HA is the normal play now, but declarer may think deeper|pg||
nt|roswolf: really as long as he doesnt panic this is a cinch|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would set up his side suit - as per general principles|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi is not the man to panic.  He played the last 3 Bermuda Bowls and reached semifinal in 2009.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes which is why Bocchi's malaise is so evident|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Chinese team beat the defending Champion Norway in the QF.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|star6ija: there are some diffivulties|pg||
nt|lechcold: mo¿e byæ:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade to jack seems so normal|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: some might be wondering why it's so obvious for east to duck his @HA there at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Aronov in 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds taken quickly anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup: without @d lead-or switch  -which is difficult|pg||
nt|ady: should be another 5 to china|pg||
pc|hK|nt|boedhy:  @s @c ducked and @d to the 10 for 6 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: rallying a bit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bt: that was strange|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: if you have the ace over KQ it's just standard to duck at top level|pg||
nt|athene: it hurts declarer's transportation|pg||
nt|athene: and also helps your own|pg||

pc|cK|nt|athene: now EW can cash two hearts any time west gets in|pg||
nt|athene: if east won the first trick he couldn't attack hearts any more|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer would have a sure trick and an entry|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no right prediction this time Ruud :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: maybe the result but not the line of play|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: now give up a spade if finesse wrong |pg||
nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein never bid where karaivanov-trendafilo wore out their red cards|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: going somewhere for themselves|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so I am all on my own|pg||

nt|brolucius: That is the link to the E/W convention card. (Many thanks to the excellent ECATS site).|pg||

nt|roswolf: CHINA now effectively leading|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: also they might just bid 1NT - 2@H; 2@S pass in the other room|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3N bez biletu w PO:(|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Back with more action|pg||
nt|leao:  scoresheet must look pretty depressing at the table from the brazilians perspective...|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Brink have a gadget here?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looks liks 6@s|pg||
nt|bt: iceland is getting closer to the struggle for 8th spot, and usa1 might if they drop some more to NZ|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, S bid 3@S at this point|pg||
nt|runnerup: here Swedish ns where in 5-1 fit -which doesnt look like the best place|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks. That site works VERY well,. England 59 - Sweden 24. |pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, only 9 imps difference and there are still the two slams and 790 to come.|pg||
nt|roswolf: now more distribution floating about|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: not automatic to reach the game with that 7 facing 17|pg||
nt|lml: looks like 3@S ... lets see|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  I believe either 1 suited in clubs   are clubs and a major?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|ady: another flatish hand   part score|pg||
nt|yuval10: Gyorgy sazaly, in an earlier match, suggested that the US teams will be tougher to beat during the KO team, also the Italian one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this time a max NT|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will he have visions of that after 1NT opening|pg||
nt|boedhy:  he should if he hears a fit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the hands fit perfectly|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 1NT will help them win auction in 2@H probably|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Souths pass over 1NT in OR is a matter of style, lots of points but no suit to attack|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S substantially better played by south|pg||
nt|gracelin: oh, the 3D is by north|pg||
nt|roswolf: well his head may be bitten off here|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|kemperg: Pakistani wont feel well :(|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: now south wants to splinter in two suits at once :)|pg||

nt|ady: probaly 1NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Zack will want to become invisible - uncharacteristic careless play|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi leao:) |pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S is not a silly contract but the cards lie unluckily for N/S.|pg||
nt|bt: at the other table i think the bids were normal until north bid 4@S, @HQx is really bad on that auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H & @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=no pref|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks a good return in OR|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: you would like to just bid blackwood except you might get too high|pg||
nt|brolucius: England was not fancied by the bookies, but what do they know?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some people play 4@D shows this sort of hand -very strong suit with support for partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok i am told 4@C asks for keycards|pg||
nt|athene: if so, north won't be taking so long :) just a matter of counting four steps|pg||
nt|athene: i think 4@C is a splinter in fact|pg||
nt|athene: and north has the well-known problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N shut his eys and looks to the ceiling... thinking|pg||
nt|athene: he has some extras but his only available cue-bid goes past game|pg||
nt|lml: so can west find the diamond lead ... the @DQ|pg||
nt|lml: north should bid 4@H here|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what 2NT would show?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N not convenient with partners bid, 4@h seems logical|pg||
nt|lml: I guess 19?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: can't say, I assume so|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass or correct for N|pg||
nt|lml: the Canadians had a bit of a strange auction on the previous board to end in 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt and 4@h should not make|pg||

nt|lml: Israel has been doing very well ... tough fighters too|pg||
nt|oosmanb: dont know if 2@S makes for NS but its close |pg||
nt|garden2005: próba ¿¹d³a|pg||
nt|roswolf: west courageously sallies forth|pg||
nt|gracelin: I think West went to far by bidding 3D, showing D plus a major, at this Vul.|pg||
nt|gracelin: too|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sorry|pg||
nt|roswolf: aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|kit: difficult hand to handle here.  As it turns out 6 of either major makes with both majors 3-3.|pg||
nt|barnets: lucky major suit division here both 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: a w RP?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  doubleton @c helps but the good @d arent that much help|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes. The 5th trump is worth a couple of points, to compensate.|pg||
nt|brolucius: My comments are struggling to make it to the Netherlands, appearing after a time-delay of a few seconds. Perhaps someone is censoring them on the way.|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D now, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South already passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: practical bidding|pg||
nt|ady: maybe diamond lead   free finess for a club pitch|pg||
nt|roswolf: might have been an excitinf auction the original thiugh:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: neither 3NT nor 4H makes.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: still, he has such a nice hand, i think he SHOULD go past game|pg||
nt|ady: nast lead for north|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: complimenting Bjarni on his average dummy putting :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: mo¿e by³o otwarcie !NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Brink finding 4 @C bid "amusing" |pg||
nt|olegario: Hello all, Thank you leao! olegario from Belo Horizonte, Brazil|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will W bid spades? or diamonds?|pg||
nt|ady: east may have trouble keeping trump control to bring in the diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: north considering playing the king|pg||
nt|bt: we have the same contract here, east will lead @HA and west discourage, then diamond shift|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H usually forcing. If so, 3@H must mean a big two-suiter (or a splinter agreeing diamonds).|pg||
nt|barnets: Israel bid to 3N in open|pg||
nt|kit: I think Weinstein should just bid 4@S and end it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Weinstein thinking...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: right, so i can believe THIS is keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does 1@D imply unbalanced hand?|pg||

nt|yuval10: same bidding as in the OR here|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|lml: pretty clear to make 3 except if stansby gives a trick away on a diamond lead for an overtrick|pg||
nt|jbgood: the queen of spades was lead in the OR - and the slam made|pg||
nt|boedhy:  some sort of maximum now |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they found a 44 fit|pg||
nt|skaftij:  EW CC does not reveal their escape methods|pg||
nt|bt: its not only that Qx is bad, its a minus value|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very few pairs have ability to show @D at 2-level over 1N opener|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: south is not going to make this|pg||

nt|lechcold: a to nie sz³o|pg||

nt|sybarra: all of them! |pg||
nt|ahollan1: tarzan did NOT DBL 4@H on  9|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Iceland got to 4@h on bd 9, undoubled though|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Al you are too fast!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tarzan =  wijs-muller   sounds like name of movie's tarzan from 1930s/40s  Johnny Weissmuller|pg||
nt|szalay: who was Hungarian:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hungarian??   i know he was olympic swimmer  but didn't know heritage|pg||

mb|p|nt|famus: U bet--but these guys are creating same feelings in every team they've encountered so far:)|pg||

nt|boedhy:  4@c they wil have agreed on|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm cerrtain 3N will make on 9 in the other room|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point! Yes, he needs the @DK set up before the clubs give a discard. |pg||
nt|runnerup: minor games are down with ruffs in other minor -if you has ny way to find such games|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: grali 1 BA - 3 BA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Exactly as Lars predicted.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, East should see that it is the main chance of beating the contract (if no trump trick is available). |pg||
nt|bt: every now and then i find a diamond in the rough, right?|pg||
nt|barnets: west passed in open  same bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: A sensible auction.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lechcold: 3 by³o szwole¿erskie:)|pg||

nt|bt: without diamond king west encourages|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: góral mo¿e przynieæ niedu¿y zysk, ale czy musi?|pg||
nt|xenya: not a contract to be in when you are late|pg||
nt|barnets: dec needed 1 major suit to break to make 3n so was fortunate|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: if south had opened a strong 2@C what would have happened I wonder|pg||
nt|antoniz: czyli 2NT graæ musieli,trudno|pg||
nt|pawel90:  raczej sami bÄdziemy wistowaÄ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: can he make it?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1 NT showed 14-16 so W could have a minor jack |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south in deep thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: back in hand now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South has 2 entries to dummy in @c so will play towards @sAJ since East is known to have @SKQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and back on the table they go|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but he does not know te @c layout yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards in hand|pg||
nt|kit: exactly -- 4@S can stand some bad splits.  3NT maybe not.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: weinstein : i am not claiming but i will show you my hand loool|pg||
nt|gracelin: 20-21, with 22-23 they open 2D and rebid 2NT.  with 23+, 2C then 2NT|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|wild card: this contract will purely depend on a heart decision|pg||
nt|antoniz: idzie 6kier,to dobrze|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4 pasy zostaly na razie wpisane, bo w rozdaniu bylo tylko 48 kart|pg||
nt|jbgood: but in @cs always 2 club losers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: only a @C lead lets it make..|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 17 imps for Sweden|pg||
nt|garden2005: kiwki i wolnoamerykanka ... czy tak powinnimy wygrywaæ?|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: and the israeli boys in one voice: you make everything lool |pg||
nt|roswolf: ty patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D opening can also be a weak two in either major|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer doesn't know the bad trump split yet.  He's working on how to make on 3-2 break|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont think this is ever makeable i fancy -2|pg||
nt|gracelin: The other room is commentated by Italian. They must not like what's going on.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: thanks  quick scan of notes made me think 1@C or 1N with all balanced hands up to 19 HCP|pg||
nt|ady: set up the long diamon   got 4 diamonds  2 hearts and 1 spade|pg||
nt|lechcold: dwie nadróbki...dobrze ¿e m³odzie amerykañska nie popêdzi³a do szlemika kierowego|pg||
nt|ady: heart now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  A @d to dummy may risk 2@h 1S and 2@d for the defense. Declarer does not like it until he sees @c situation|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but he will play a @c to dummy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|skaftij:  after escape method , he will infer that  @C are 4-2, west showed 4+@C-4+@H|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lml: I like a spade play now ... @SQ or jack|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4@c maybe after 2@c opening|pg||
nt|ady: running the 9 guaranteed 7 tricks  and in the event did not cost|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: claim and toilet break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as expected Aronov going down 2 in 4@S on  8|pg||
nt|ady: usa got 6 imps on hand 8 where Bulgaria were to high in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 6 boards   in Bermuda Bowl  Guadalupe leads Iceland by 19 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and we are back|pg||
nt|wild card: and I think it best to play the jack|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer's main line is to ruff a club and discard one on the good spade. but he also worry about D ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the ether will certainly be full of hot air tinged with woe no doubt - but they are allowed a bad set sometime:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: if you had a choice of 3@S or 4@C to splinter, 3@S looks better, as partner has more room over it|pg||
nt|lml: good play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tough for W now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|wild card: but if he plays the jack, the contract will fail, as we see|pg||
nt|wild card: N did show two aces though|pg||
nt|wild card: and if he had had a singleton hearts, he might have had a bid over 1@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo it is a pure guess.|pg||
nt|wild card: looking only at the heart position, I guess it's better to play the jack|pg||
nt|wild card: wins if south has AQx in trumps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: but anyway, they got there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its a very good one and nothing much to the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so well done NL another derserved big plus|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play so 13 imps to the netherlands...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: very well bid by NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: really "communicating" |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Iceland have been pushed down to 6th and this won't help|pg||
nt|skaftij:  clubs is only chance - he knows D finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards stil placed on the table and thinking...|pg||
nt|garden2005: zazwyczaj taki styl reprezntuj¹ pary, ktore maja kompleks ni¿szoci i próbuj¹ w pokerka zagraæ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|leao:  Campos will try to get tricks anyway he can now :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  although if he tries to ruff a @c ... but the @c queen should bother him|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Iceland has a tough "program" for the day|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: has to play Israel in the last match this afternoon|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only needs 1 @C ruff so playing trumps safe|pg||
nt|runnerup: this was down -not any more?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the time is almost up and 6 more boards to play|pg||

nt|roswolf: they are only mortals not gods!|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure. like 2007 against S. Africa|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: S had a difficult decision to make, and he banked on 5 hearts with N -- N could have just 4, Al?|pg||
nt|ady: same 11 tricks    a push|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: on any lead i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the director in the room|pg||
nt|xenya: so they will be penalised, which is good news for Japan, who are trailing NZ by 1VP|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: mr Slavek Latala|pg||
pc|hK|nt|runnerup: he ruffed too high -so back to minus|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lml: probably down 2|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has 7 top tricks and probably has to come to a black suit trick|pg||
nt|lml: a balck suit queen|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no entries to the dummy|pg||
nt|wild card: well done robert stephens|pg||
nt|lml: nice try to set up a heart by no luck|pg||
nt|gracelin: Even God may not be able to save Madala on this 4H :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the italian lead is only 9 and bds 23-25 have not been scored yet|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lml: Martel might rise on the club to lead a diamond through|pg||
nt|lml: makes it easier on partner|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: every team desperate to make the top 8 as we near the end of the RR|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphznv: the 1@h interference by W in the other room made it more difficult|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: last hand  if the cards shown on the screen were correct then 10 tricks were there   north has discarded too many diamonds|pg||
nt|leao:  good news, the king is on side, but bad news is it's Kxxx|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Secured 1 down|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bt: decl needs @CK onside then east doesnt have @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: They lost another 7 on board 7|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sorry board 22|pg||
nt|gracelin: thjis culd be a huge set for China, but don't forget there are still 32 boards to go.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 38-3 to china this set after bd22 - with more imps to come|pg||
nt|roswolf: this set reminds me of the leaning tower of pisa|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: dont you like good partners like that|pg||

nt|ady: yes    |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: vwd NL|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for quarter final they have big problems. Maybe the Netherlands will choose them (because of the carry-over...)or they will be playing USA 1 |pg||

mb|p|nt|leao:  they got off it cheaply at 200|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I really though this would be closer|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: The icelandic pair in this room was yesterday sure that the Netherlands would pick them if they had a chance to do so|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: missing @HJ10xx you cash the single honour first because you can only pick up 4-0 break one way|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H both majors - popular weapon|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can read more about the Bermuda Bowl, particularely the US teams and the Israeli one too, plus expert analyzes, on www.bridgewinners.com|pg||

nt|jbgood: 6 boards to go here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17  EXCEPT  1st seat favoralbe|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: if you had the 10 you would cash the honour from hand first as you can pick up Jxxx in either hand|pg||
nt|athene: japan might get their first imp there, if East in the other room leads his ace against six|pg||
nt|athene: (i am sure bocchi madala will reach six)|pg||
nt|lml: well Baxter's choice of 2@S turned out to be a good choice although perhaps south would still have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: so Canada has the lead again|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3BA to Splinter karowy jak s¹dzê|pg||
nt|antoniz: splinter karowy|pg||
nt|leao:  \i expect board 24 will show a tidy profit for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can beat 4 @H  but have to take their tricks  |pg||
nt|bt: now some people can bid 2@S strong on that hand, wouldnt that be nice?|pg||
nt|brolucius: In NT it is a 5-or-7 hand, depending on whether the clubs come in. 7@S much better, because you can establish the clubs against a 4-1 break.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like a very biddable grand slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H now would suggest diamond support, because he is a passed hand.|pg||
nt|bt: west can splinter in diamonds, east blackwood and 5NT maybe?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7@S needs almost nothing|pg||
nt|hlortz: ew had a rather hasty auction in OR   seems like there might be some bids between 2n and 6n imo |pg||
nt|bt: credit to the 2@H opening at the other table|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: if they can take the club finesse and make 11 in 3nt|pg||
nt|stoffers: A lot of dull boards this set|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north will be shaking but impossible to find 2Hx|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  slight over statement    but 2NT could be much weaker in balancing seat  and very good stops in hearts   just have to play partner with enough  to make game   7 or 8 points ...|pg||
nt|ady: may do|pg||

nt|xenya: 1@DX -1 might not be such a bad result for Israel |pg||
nt|oosmanb: wow nice hand|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Very nice. Easy when you see all hands, the players need to do this again and againn for days and tiredness creeps in|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West said : only this partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D pre-emptive, of course, since he can cue-bid with a good raise.|pg||
nt|hlortz: that was a factor certainly|pg||
nt|bt: i think 4@D makes it a lot easier here|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps the lack of time made swedish do that little slip in defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nystrom seems very fast...|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H a good 2@S raise I believe.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2h=9-11 3 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin just wrote it down|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am not sure about that last result ... looked like 2 down not 1 down|pg||
nt|star6ija: I do not expect they to go further than 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to penalize this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but DBL would work very well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  well the gain is only 50|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphznv: i asked them and the claim was for 1 down, 1 also though like 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I asked them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=ART FG  a) @C  b) 4@H  c) long @S|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: impodajny to ten mecz nie jest|pg||
nt|yuval10: me too Linda, those are very strong 2 teams|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: as I said earlier -- they were being beaten heavily in the test match |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Running scores > http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that is usually the case. 4@D does not show more than 4@S. It shows one of the reasons WHY you are worth 4@S. |pg||
nt|bt: if north bids 5@D it would have been tough|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bertheau for sure slower than nystrom|pg||
nt|kit: 2NT probably some weak competitive hand, while a 3-level call would be constructive.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder if he could have doubled to show hearts.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Seems clear to show them now.|pg||
nt|kit: maybe double shows only 4 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South in the tank now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he actually has 2 of the 3 options covered|pg||
nt|stoffers: We want action and blood :)|pg||
nt|wild card: not the first time we see a transfer on one level today|pg||
nt|ady: this might be 1 too high|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now it becomes interesting|pg||
nt|ady: only 9 obvious tricks including K@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: E may bid again and he did |pg||
nt|skaftij:  risk is losing double digit imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  dummy has 3@C  looked like 2 before|pg||
nt|ady: 1 too high|pg||
nt|ady: in hearts I meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: can e/w cash their tricks here|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: i played against Lauria-Versace 3 or 4 times,,,when they are on a run,, u feel pressure every second|pg||
nt|athene: slam is not so bad here, if played by north to protect the @CK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D asks|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2 and a half :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: brawo Krzysztofy,piêknie i skutecznie|pg||
nt|lechcold: co siê musi udaæ, w koñcu to Mistrzostwa Swiata:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like making 10 with @S start|pg||
nt|ady: I believe the 2 heart opening shows 5 hearts and 4 spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can do it - spade and South must play 10 then 2nd spade (9) and can establish spade trick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or can end play North|pg||
nt|ady: I think J@S  may be right|pg||
nt|ady: J@S    if south covers with the queen   then king    come back to east and low spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT  best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: szczêliwie ju¿ po dwóch przebitkach karasi rozdanie siê koñczy|pg||

nt|olegario: ohoh now :) too high up again|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: after the lead declarer claims making 5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@d makeable as the hand is|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so no play here :)|pg||
nt|kit: I can't imagine what South could do but bid 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: china need to keep their foot on the italians throat - score the imps now and dont delay|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: but south has the diamonds so it would have to be 6nt (or 6@S, but that is not likely)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=4@H    totally new concept|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3@H = 5@S-4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm very much impressed with how the Israeli team are playing here, and we must not forget it's a rather young one, most of them age nearly 40|pg||
nt|lml: there is no reason for south to pull with JX of diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: a slightly different auction gave more room for NS than in the OR - and may land in thispartial|pg||
nt|panosk: looks like a gd contract |pg||
nt|panosk: lead will provide 9th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  I can imagine why. They play solid easy bridge as we can see from these boards|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so normally the better team wins then....And I think the Netherlands are a bit better ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: very solid indeed|pg||
nt|szalay: boring 1 off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: early World Championships were scored Total Points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so here  NS would be net +50 after 100 honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honors died when Imps came into use|pg||
nt|kit: But now I know.|pg||
nt|brolucius: How can they miss a 5-4 fit in the 'other major'?|pg||
nt|barnets: 2n clearly misunderstood|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt was competitive at the 3 level|pg||
nt|kit: This is a major mixup.  South apparently thought 3@S asked for a spade stopper.  North thought 2NT then 3NT showed notrump.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: all reasonable plays produce a 10th trck|pg||
nt|bt: 5nt then 7@S looks easy now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now after all the key cards are known 5NT will invite a grand and West will accept with those clubs.|pg||
nt|gracelin: they tried here, but with trumps 4-1, probably dwn.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|famus: 6NT wud be great|pg||
nt|athene: north may now offer 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: but it's tricky|pg||
nt|athene: good hand but no aces|pg||
nt|lechcold: karach:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: well - looks as if 2@h was gf...|pg||
nt|leao:  rite, if they dont take their 4 tricks kickly they wont take them at all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if it meant 'two places to play', it seems it was misjudged with 5 cards in the other major.|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch not a good time to save|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|udo: nice bid by South,,now North shoudl accept,,, he has a clear max|pg||
nt|wild card: interesting question is, what would redouble instead of 1@s mean|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I believe 1@s did show a 3crd|pg||
nt|wild card: and does dbl on 1@h show a takeout hand (like this), or something in hearts|pg||
nt|lechcold: bardzo ostro|pg||
nt|pawel90:  trzeba karo trafiÄ|pg||
nt|antoniz: trafi karko i super|pg||
nt|leao:  not a chance now|pg||
nt|desinka:  looks like flat board to me|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|desinka:  EW play kind of polish club|pg||
nt|barnets: south should have x 2@H or bid 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Shi thinks the same I think, talking chinese I think, don't understand anything|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lechcold: podzia³ kar i trafienie palcówki potrzebne|pg||
nt|xenya: hmm|pg||
nt|lml: Matel has to pick a major with 3-3|pg||
nt|desinka:  depends from the vuln|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i always wonder what it would be like to revive them in a duplicate setting|pg||
nt|barnets: that is clear|pg||
pc|h8|nt|skaftij:  Is it Ilan or Ophir who is South?|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, he has just shown the @CK. I was not expecting that.|pg||
nt|bt: now if east thinks and does bid 6@S ...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5NT not only asks for kings, also for a trick source which woolridge has|pg||
nt|brolucius: Makes no sense if West bids 7@S now. Why not on the previous round?|pg||
nt|bt: i thenk the us2 coach should do some work here|pg||
nt|garden2005: bêd¹ p¹czki|pg||
nt|xenya: this will also take some time -- before it goes down|pg||
pc|hK|nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|athene: well, this might make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now the lead // who would lead a @c|pg||
nt|athene: lauria did not double 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: but the italians don't double these bids very often|pg||
nt|athene: so versace might still lead a club|pg||
nt|famus: i bet a @c lead|pg||
nt|udo: @C looks like he natural lead........maybe a @D|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's close between club and spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is not "that great"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ilan is south|pg||
nt|bt: if east thought and then bid 6@S they are toast|pg||
nt|ady: now losing 300    4 imps  instead of gaining aroound 5   still easier to decide from here|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|udo: 13 now|pg||
nt|panosk: see how long he thinks to make sure of finding the correct plan even in a seemingly straightforward contract?|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 24 the chinese stayed low in 4@H AND just made it|pg||
nt|roswolf: the chinese have scored 62 unanswered imps in 6 bds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|famus: might lose an imp or two here--coz the Ita wud b in 6NT if at all|pg||
nt|ady: this will likely make in spite of bad split|pg||
nt|yuval10: that won't be a big success for USA1|pg||
nt|lml: so this is how you can end in a 3-3 fit friends even when you are great players|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Against aggresive teams as India for instance yesterday you can loose because of some slem boards who happen to make|pg||
nt|runnerup: one down next -save time |pg||
nt|roswolf: however you can never write off the azurri|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: ok now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all over - now 11 but he wont want to get greedy again|pg||
nt|yuval10: with the natural @h lead the contract seem like drifting at least 3|pg||
nt|xenya: W didn't know E had the @D10 when he ran|pg||
nt|lml: I like a trump lead and so does South!|pg||
nt|lml: it was a reasonable action by Stansby but it worked out badly|pg||
nt|hlortz: and 6@s must be in temo or 7S ot allowed|pg||
nt|hlortz: /tempo/|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, they got there but no 'points for style'.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here i dont think tempo matters since 5NT confirmed all the key cards|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|leao:  300|pg||
nt|ady: can cash the diamond now or have it later     east will finesse 10@D for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: yes    may be 500   depemding on how it goes |pg||
nt|roswolf: these hands are so dipirting yo play|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: defence just has trump tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will not make this|pg||
nt|gracelin: will be more on the 790 hand.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|szalay: as 1 kib said: good save vs. 4@S|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|athene: well, if bocchi-madala play 6nt from north side, Pakistan can feel it is just not their day|pg||
nt|stoffers: Got to go, thx all and see you :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  True Viking attitude :-)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: can cash @SAK and play three rounds of trumps now to force east to give a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't help|pg||
nt|athene: you can throw the club loser from dummy and ruff in hand but then dummy has only one trump to deal with two club losers|pg||
nt|athene: so one down|pg||
nt|athene: west didn't want to shift to the @CQ because declarer could have stiff king (four clubs with east for the double)|pg||
nt|athene: sorry five|pg||
nt|jbgood: if clubs dont break he has 9 if the diamond finesse is on - nothing works|pg||
nt|boedhy:  two off....|pg||
pc|s2|nt|skaftij:  Thx Christer|pg||
nt|kit: The normal and cold 4@H reached in the other room, so big pickup for USA1|pg||
nt|brolucius: A run of poorish boards for the Israel N/S.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this certainly sets up the last 2 sets nicely|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lechcold: ale dla odmiany @H10 u N lub S czyni szlema bardzo dobrym kontraktem|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: We wroc³awiu poci¹g jest ko³o po³udnia...zaraz sprawdzê dok³¹dniej|pg||
nt|brolucius: West is adding possible ruffing tricks in diamonds too, so he surely had a 7@S bid on the previous round.|pg||
nt|ady: can get to the spade discard and ruff a diamond|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another squeeze coming up|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: so far north south is doing this perfectly|pg||
nt|barnets: in open south bid a normal 3@H over 2@S|pg||
nt|barnets: and reached the sane contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: In a way South had more options here, with only 2@H in front of him.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ryskiel_: arymistrzowskie 3 nogi|pg||
pc|sA|nt|udo: sy, still 12|pg||
nt|roswolf: true patrick|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lml: surprising result in the OR|pg||
nt|athene: he probably just asked if the @HQ falls|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a lot of italian words being said|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I dont understand italian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so cant say what is the problem|pg||

mb|d|an|3!H|nt|lechcold: bêd¹ chyba punkty|pg||
nt|xenya: again, a solid result for Israel from the OR|pg||
nt|boedhy:  I got a lot of comment yesterday when i was complementing Drijver Brink |pg||
nt|boedhy:  So I thought today i do something different|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: then I will complement them - have never seen them play "in real life" before - but so far they have played brilliantly|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but you cant let these guys build up a big lead -they are great front runners|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 1S bid solved West's rebid problem.  The Chinese don't raise on 3|pg||
mb|r|nt|ady: low heart lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 NT the safest game|pg||
nt|jbgood: defense made it easy at the other table|pg||
nt|leao:  this shud make comfortably|pg||
nt|ady: minors behave for 6@C    but likely to finish in 3NT|pg||
nt|bt: i dont know if there was a break anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Break or not, it is illogical to realise that 7 is there when partner signs off but not before.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no there was not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink 2@H more constructive than 2@D["multi"]|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: surely East runs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C probably @C and another|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H making in OR  a good reult for Israel|pg||
nt|desinka:  lets see|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@c gameforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@d I think is explained as "balanced hand"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now South in the tank|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Janusz jaki wywa¿ony w s³owach ...no. no|pg||
nt|barnets: same bidding in open passed out|pg||
nt|imp_jan: f = 128|pg||
nt|brolucius: West sees no advantage in a splinter 4@H on such a weak hand. It would give North an extra option.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: west didnt bother with stayman with a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
nt|lml: all quacky too|pg||
nt|desinka:  yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: an old chess maneouvre, you repeat the position to gain thinking time|pg||
nt|bt: good to hear, then he was only teasing partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here i think 6@C was in that category|pg||
nt|hlortz: so while illogical i guess its legal if no UI|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Tough balancing|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: e/w now of the hook|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: true...west breathing easier|pg||
nt|lechcold: u Amerykanów pad³o 2@S i graj¹ 3N po ataku @HD|pg||
nt|ady: not surprised  not in game here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  North plays 3NT in OR, looks like going down|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: important board|pg||
nt|xenya: why should EW get to 3N i can't imagine -- but may be diplicated here|pg||
nt|barnets: north passed 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: in open final contract|pg||
nt|kit: Levin's 4-card overcall struck gold -- or will it be mud after the hand is over?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|wild card: would you bid 2@s or 2@h now?|pg||
nt|wild card: we can see 2@h is a much better contract|pg||
nt|kamyk: mozna go zrozumieæ: zacz¹³ od Staymana, bo jak znajdzie st. 4-ke, to OK; po 2@D nie mia³ jak sie dowiedzieæ o ficie pik, wiêc zaryzykowa³ Smolenia - nie widze tu wielkiej winy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mmm could be down on the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what would you lead|pg||
nt|xenya: not now perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: all bids are alerted of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only 2-suiter NS can show is @H & @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: He had classic hand for a 4-card overcall: good values, good 4-card suit, and length in opener's suit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: north might bid 2NT to sow a good raise.  but he is stronger than that.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphznv: he looks more relaxed now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S looks appropriate however could bid 2@H, matter of judgment.|pg||
nt|lml: Martels 1NT is 15-17|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 to Sw..next|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@D promising 4-card major(s) but not 5|pg||
nt|ady: the 2@C rescue might also have been painful on good defence|pg||
nt|antoniz: trafi karo i brawa za agresjê|pg||
nt|ady: some play inverted minor raise not forcing to game|pg||
nt|skaftij:  this will make 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
nt|skaftij:  or 11|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: new leader after this|pg||
nt|skaftij:  he knows his side does not hold the balance of high cards|pg||
nt|ady: can make this now|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: good for u Jan--coz all those must b which u wudn't want ur young son to hear!!!:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 110 lub 140 |pg||
nt|leao:  after ew have fun with theyr @h its game over|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Kilka zagrañ by³o dla mnie niezrozumia³ych. mam na mysli rozgrywkê|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but the master suit, @s maybe|pg||
nt|szalay: i rather blame north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry i reversed meaning of 2@D/2@H   2@H is weaker|pg||
nt|kit: The double of 4@S is rather amazing to me -- might have been influenced by previous boards.|pg||
nt|roswolf: the italiams dont lose many matches 40+ imps up|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: lauria-versace often have quite intense "discussions" when they get a less than perfect board :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  9 quick tricks|pg||
nt|antoniz: 140|pg||
nt|lechcold: z tak cienkimi numerkami pikowymi nie ka¿dy zdecydowa³by siê na skok w tych za³ozeniach|pg||
nt|desinka:  in this vulnerables 1@C is 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|desinka:  so 2@C is GF|pg||

nt|jkmjanusz: Z êki N te 5@C... |pg||
nt|antoniz: dobra decyzja,tylko-1|pg||
nt|szalay: why didnt he raise?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphznv: they like to play with 6 trumps i think|pg||
nt|ady: need to play a spade now|pg||
nt|lml: 2@C was likely setting up an invitational auction since Stansby could just have bid hearts if he wanted to play th|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East: sorry if I did something stupid|pg||
nt|panosk: gd game bad breaks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not that :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: zrobilimy Janusz panel wyborczy na forum bryd¿owym, g³osowa³o 99 bryd¿ystów - zdoby³es 27 g³osów :) rzadko masz kontakt z nami i dlatego ci pisze o tym wyniku|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: No, to nie zanosi sie na zwyciêstwo taryf¹...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ale jak zdobêdziemy w ostatniej rundzie 45VP to jeszcze mamy szanse:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: need exact defense to beat 4H, spade lead and D shift.  D lead also works, of course.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|udo: this lead helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  that 1N was 9-12|pg||
nt|star6ija: they reached the worst possible contract...even 3N has greater chances|pg||
nt|lml: there|pg||
nt|lml: Jan tells me that 1NT can be a bit weaker after a negative doubel 14-16|pg||
nt|panosk: will make though |pg||
nt|ady: east doing well|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this wont take long either|pg||
nt|ady: if playing north for doubleton honor in clubs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lechcold: Fredin na drugim stole tego nie zrobi³|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Antoni - czy tu miejsce na rozwa¿ania co by by³o gdyby by³o? Nie wystarcz¹ ³amy B?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West you didn't. maybe something good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ai|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Great Dealer thinks we have just ben treated to a grand slam, so we should (as a penance) watch some - usually very slow - 1NT contract. |pg||
nt|skaftij:  With 2@h contrsuctive, North should raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: balancing 2@H  when 2@D would be more constructive|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|wild card: well, you already have told you're low on points, and you'll never make your hearts in a spade contract|pg||
nt|boedhy:  played too quickly there|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sr FOLKS -- should never have complemented them -- always ends this way when I do -- SORRY |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lucky for NL 5C was allowed to make OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i got it wrong 1st time  --  actually  2@D stronger than 2@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  true|pg||
nt|kit: Levin working on the clubs, so will have some tricks if opponents draw trumps.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: some play re-double in east seat compels 2@C  which east would pass with what he had  or if a higher suit would then bid his suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have 3 ranges for 1N   at fav  1/2=9-12  3/4=11-14  otherwise 15-17|pg||
nt|odysseus69: interesting bidding in OR- having bid 2H over the double South revalued and bid 4H after 3D|pg||
nt|jbgood: fine contract for a push - he will not risk the club finesse - and three club tricks the reward|pg||
nt|ady: this could bring in some imps for Bulgaria|pg||
pc|d3|nt|desinka:  still early to say that :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||

nt|antoniz: jednak bedzie -2,ma³y zysk|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Jak ruszy³ @C@C to moze byc bez dwóch...|pg||
nt|brolucius: It can scarcely be an out-and-out penalty double since most of his hand (the heart honors) could be ruffed away.|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  down 1|pg||
nt|ady: likely down 2|pg||
nt|ady: but still a good board for China|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a steal|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|bt: race for 8th spot is now: T5 US1/Iceland 307.5 7. NZ 302 8. Australia 301 9. Sweden 298 10 China 297.5 11. Japan 295|pg||
pc|h6|nt|udo: still,,,9 tricks ,,hmm,,,,may need some endplay|pg||
nt|athene: will he try finessing the @S9 for a dummy entry?|pg||
nt|ady: needs to get club right|pg||
nt|ady: bad situation in either minor might have meant slam going down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|udo: i see only 7 tricks actually|pg||
nt|famus: that 1 imp is becoming more illusive with each passing board--sounds like poetry!!:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: it appears west is trying to sign off but east is persisting|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: North doesn't know 4-card overcall, so he may think it necessary to tap dummy again.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: @SK there was safe, wasn't it? i guess not if east had @SQ109xx, but is that really possible?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: tht this was glong to be played in clubs    but this will also come home|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: down now - right|pg||
nt|kit: But North got it right -- holding declarer to 3 ruffs in dummy.|pg||
nt|barnets: same def so far in open|pg||
nt|barnets: exactly|pg||
nt|kit: Oh, Soouth overtook to play a spade.  Good play.  South knew the story.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ehsana: hello all :)|pg||
nt|ady: spade ruff   will beat this |pg||
nt|desinka:  lucky - 6@C/6@D are almost the same in this positions of the cards|pg||
nt|ady: not down in clubs    6NT would have made as well|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I would like 6@c a lot more|pg||
nt|desinka:  for sure|pg||
nt|bt: i think we have sweden-nz in the last round also|pg||
nt|brolucius: I usually find that it is a close decision between looking out of the window and watching a 1NT contract (but some say that this is an eccentric view).|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: not guaranteed    west only bid once  and did not rebid diamonds|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: so probably 4|pg||
nt|lml: and likely a push or an imp in it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wests 3D bid has received criticism from spectators- rightly so- his hand is poor defensively so shouldnt give oppo 2nd chance|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphznv: a spade to the @s J|pg||
nt|athene: lauria decides to give up on the heart finesse since it might be wrong anyway and even if right, very hard to get to take it twice|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EA--can u tell us who was their coach--i forget the name??|pg||
nt|athene: even if the @S10 is onside|pg||
nt|ehsana: Kokish's  reps in Karachi|pg||
nt|famus: ah ok--ther are people looking here for those reps:))haha--joking|pg||
nt|athene: if the hearts are breaking, then it is advantageous to cash them|pg||
nt|star6ija: how he will go probably wrong|pg||
nt|ady: can make   ruff high and draw   and play on either red suit  |pg||
nt|star6ija: I think chances are greater for ruffing with the 8 here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fingers on the ten...not on the table|pg||
nt|ady: have to guess|pg||
nt|lml: Martel is getting his long suit going right away|pg||
nt|panosk: if spade finess doesnt work ruff another heart in dummy|pg||
nt|desinka:  sorry|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Przeka¿cie Witoldowi pozdrowienia. I dajcie moj adres. Rysio ma!|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: to take some exit cards away from the defence and make them discard|pg||
pc|c7|nt|desinka:  stupid comment|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|famus: with two entries it wud've fetched him more to return @hs--but Lauria does it for him|pg||
nt|ehsana: hink Lauria is giving all up|pg||
nt|athene: but if they aren't breaking, cashing them just sets up a trick or tricks for a defender|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finesse @ss now|pg||
nt|udo: @S to 9 and still interesting|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: guessed right    though perhaps a little luck;y|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes, but ... if W has 4 trumps with 9 promotion is already done|pg||

nt|bt: some interesting cards here, ns better stay at the 4 level|pg||
nt|bt: or get to nt|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4 to go|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that was clear way to play it, since South's 2@H normally shows only three hearts, leaving North with two big ones in the end position.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: LEVIN IS A SUPER PLAYER|pg||
nt|ady: 12 back   well timed bid|pg||

nt|roswolf: all pass|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: Sometimes very difficult to decide between NT and a 5-3 major fit. I usually solve the problem by always playing in the major. |pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 3@c=6-9hcp 4@ss|pg||

nt|xenya: but still in contention?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: of course|pg||

nt|runnerup: if Nyström still bids they better find 4-4- fit |pg||

mb|p|nt|bt: i follow kantar-eisenberg on that|pg||
nt|bt: with overstrength always play 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS play multi - maybe he thinks that hand is too strong for weak-two but too weak for 1@S|pg||
nt|wild card: board 10, EW in the open room also bid 4@h, got a diamond lead, declarer misguessed trumps but still got home after a wrong defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West asks about the time|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 20/25 min offcial|pg||

nt|oosmanb: which Ace do you lead against 5@C !!|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ady: spades best for n/s   difficult to find now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looking at it more deeply he had to choose if partner had the @c or @s ace|pg||
nt|skaftij:  the 4-1 break make 4@s difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most play support DBL only thru 2@H|pg||
nt|szalay: but over 2M it shows extras|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: Part of the game:)|pg||
nt|lml: on the lie of the cards e-w can do pretty well in a minor|pg||
nt|xenya: much depends on how NS treat this sequence...|pg||
nt|lml: but no way to know that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jorgs bidding doesnt match their CC|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2NT = FG raise|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: or maybe he just thinks his spades are not good enough for a weak-two|pg||
nt|athene: i bet bocchi is not so demure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: seems a cross ruff game here|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that the defence is overrruffing|pg||
nt|lml: he has five top tricks so he needs to make 3 little diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he can make a ruff of a small club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hard to do so with this layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11  Stefanov in 4@H on the Moysian|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually declarer after correct guess in @ss has to keep all his @ds in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: and it appears 3@S was just a signoff|pg||
nt|bt: so if u have like 26 hcp and 53, get to the major, u need the extra ruff|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I wrote what Jorgensen wrote to N|pg||
nt|skaftij:  4@d void probably|pg||
nt|bt: with 28 or more get to nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, there is no threat of an adverse ruff in NT, of course.|pg||
nt|bt: at least thats my interpretation of how they played, must ask them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S according to cc is GI-relay [15]|pg||
nt|barnets: USA building a strong lead - now by 38|pg||
nt|brolucius: As often happens, we are assigned a penance of 1NT after an exciting board.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes regaining your composure is necessary once you have been through the wringer|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pawel90:  5@D byÅo tanie|pg||
nt|sybarra: has a bit to handle however |pg||
nt|leao:  6 even, without  @d lead |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course and that is what he has :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will not make this...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  have to go have fun all|pg||
nt|skaftij:  running scores |pg||
nt|skaftij:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|runnerup: now @d lead needed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Jonsson asked if he has to much|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Baldursson answer is: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: north in closed room made an imiganative bid of 4@C over 1N rebid|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is easy for text-books to tell us not to allow a bad board to affect our subsequent play. This advice is all too difficult to follow, as we have seen here.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they are laughing about the lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wild card: south apparently wants to know whether to play 3NT or 4@s, and that's an easy decision for north|pg||
nt|lml: a spade lead will not be helpful to the defense|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @c ruffs would give alot of defensive tricks.. 2 ruffs A@H A@S 2@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no i dont know what that means :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told by a kibitzer that a recent analysis showed (in world championship play) that 3NT played better than four of a major when the hands are balanced. He says that Glyn ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Liggins (of England) was the author. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they have 25 minutes left|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have not read it, but it would be interesting to see.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this hand south has no reason to play 4@H for sure|pg||
nt|kit: jack of spades lead a thoughtful shot -- but not for this hand. |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|panosk: tough contract lets see how he deals with it|pg||
nt|panosk: prefer semi forcing 2@D with W hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bye Ruud and thanks from all of us'|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Natural 4@S but appears difficult to make on J@D lead.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3C for 5 card major|pg||
nt|leao:  yes, he has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 6 with j10 of spades dropping|pg||
nt|leao:  rite|pg||
nt|leao:  @d and @d?|pg||
nt|bt: i also never look for a major w 4333, its just so i dont waste my energy deciding or give up information |pg||
nt|runnerup: @s lead |pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: think this will end in game|pg||
nt|ady: not slam|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wild card: 3@h conventional, I've seen Americans do that before|pg||
nt|wild card: with both @dA and @cK offside, he will go down|pg||
nt|wild card: and 3NT might be made|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems to imply that responder should bid Stayman (rather than make a transfer bid) when he is 5-3-3-2 with a 5-card major and sound game values. |pg||
nt|barnets: south is still thinking what that means|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: could go wrong   |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: score board 28 corrected...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to rise with spade ace after d finesse loses|pg||
nt|ady: then play for K@C with north|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays clubs now and north wins and plays a 2nd spade  will again have to play the ace|pg||
nt|odysseus69: much debate - should he play clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: diamond finesse now looks normal|pg||
nt|ady: club can wait|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Zack shaking his head.. perhaps thinking about board 25?|pg||
nt|ady: good duck of spade from south|pg||
nt|leao:  nope|pg||
nt|ady: looks good for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chick:  and the Venice Cup for those interested:   http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=882|pg||
nt|andersk: well I do not lead @H A|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|lechcold: ten Grue jest bardzo grony|pg||
nt|sybarra: but not a slam "we" want to be in |pg||
nt|andersk: 4 sp makes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphznv: it did|pg||
nt|jbgood: so one imp for Sweden most likely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he did not play|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  11  [3@C S -1]  Muller in 4@S east|pg||
nt|barnets: by a pssed hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: he is trying for the crossruff but it wont work for him|pg||
nt|leao:  lol... agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few people do that, though.|pg||
nt|hlortz: south has both xtra high cards and no aces - that points me to 3n also|pg||
nt|bt: so 3nt was slam invitaional presumably|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: west might have pushed with 5@C   and taken a view if east cu 5@D|pg||
nt|wild card: he can discard 3 clubs now|pg||
nt|wild card: but after @d10, I doubt he will depend on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lechcold: przepraszam, priv:) ale Joe Grue, naprawdê jest grony|pg||
nt|kit: Not that anything else is particularly better.|pg||
nt|roswolf: an overtrick is on here|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jbgood: but not when W didnt cach the club ...|pg||
nt|bt: hurd has no clear lead here, i would try that too|pg||
nt|bt: i dont think this auction makes ducking @DA a difficult play|pg||
pc|s9|nt|leao:  goig for the forcing defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: may end up making only 5 |pg||
nt|leao:  well, he's in 4, so no problem|pg||
nt|boedhy:  hi all back|pg||
nt|sybarra: re hi Ruud |pg||
nt|boedhy:  not much imps going on i see|pg||
nt|boedhy:  board 24 only|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 24  |pg||
nt|leao:  ruff, @d to dummy and @d back.... if W ruffs, he'll be ruffing pards trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes that was a extreme result|pg||
nt|leao:  yes, Miguel felt the urge to show pard he had @h as well, instead of leading pards suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we losing connection or is Bas thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bas is thinking|pg||
nt|leao:  looks like hes thinking|pg||
nt|olegario: sure now trying for an extra trick which may not happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not after 4-1 trump split|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: premature Q@C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT much easier - if I had 5 card Stayman would I use it? dont tink so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean so you dont have to lead?|pg||
nt|runnerup: i just cant see that north has any rigth to bid to 3 @c -but he did (i think south agrees)|pg||
nt|xenya: can make by setting up hearts|pg||
nt|skaftij:  ith 3-2 spades 4 spades also off after 3 rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C is final contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are four more sessions of 16 boards, so there is no need to push hard after a couple of bad boards.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ryskiel_: jakby dali graæ|pg||
nt|panosk: hoping for spades 3-3|pg||
nt|andersk: now even easier|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why is ducking something that West should consider?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|wild card: probably he will have to|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the scorebaords again http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as we near the end of this round|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: as if @C ever get any respect  now they're premature|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: the good news is that the long hand is overrufing the spades|pg||
nt|lml: so he will probably come to the diamond 9 eventually for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: west claims|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lechcold: gramy z USA2 o 16:45 jakby co...|pg||
nt|ady: not going well|pg||
nt|lml: this should make the endplay obvious|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|davidstern: Losing 0-1-1-2|pg||
nt|davidstern: Down 1 I estimate|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein waits expectantly for third diamond to come through -- he is disappointed.|pg||
nt|gracelin: lucky for China the opening lead only costs them an overtrick.|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: for voice commentators   yes, lead was @CA|pg||

nt|panosk: if you cancell out 2 slams one gained and one lost for each team the vast majority of imps were scored by part scores|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Not goo dfor Brasil tho who should imo be possible to end up in the top 8 is getting difficult |pg||
nt|ady: 3@C  must show diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@c is a transfer to 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a possibilty for n/s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@C the limit for EW|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Dubion had PASS out of the box more than once - and chooses to stay with it|pg||
nt|bardo: no il +1 non c'è stato|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is good to see that there are some hands where 2@H is opened on both sides of the Atlantic.|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: ok, NS system in the other room put west on lead against the slam, so japan didn't get their imp |pg||

nt|athene: versace going for singleton heart with his partner and an immediate knockout|pg||
nt|ady: would need a club ruff to beat 4@H   but n/s not in the bidding|pg||
nt|bt: this is the type of auctions where north has to base his action on south having some values, like 6-7 hcp|pg||
nt|brolucius: Look at the Open Room bidding, by putting your cursor on the Open Room result (top left). East broke a fundamental rule of bidding by going to 4@H, He had made a limit bid and knew ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: little of what partner held.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein would have some chances if Levin's ace of hearts were ace of diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing 'ace for attitude, king for count' leads, North could lead the @SK to ask partner to unblock any honor he might hold, otherwise to give count. This would allow North to ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: judge if the @SQ was falling from West.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously  most tables will have identical auction even though very different inferences|pg||
nt|star6ija: have to go now , see you at 4:45 CET for the next Bulgaria's hard fight agains Poland|pg||
nt|star6ija: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bye|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|ady: need to take some care here   defenders each had a side suit singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table..thinking|pg||
nt|kamyk: ale by³ to sensowny plan - krótki @DK u wchodz¹cego|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwna gra|pg||
nt|yuval10: and in worst case you play 2NT with the points equal between both sides|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Campos sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nope |pg||
nt|szalay: I think weak openings survive cause weak overcall is coming|pg||
nt|skaftij:  lost opportunity for Iceland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've only ruled out @H lead|pg||
nt|kit: North does have a problem here -- but as the hand is, anything but king of spades defeats the contract.|pg||
nt|ady: north surprise at 2NT with what he has in spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: some good some bad and some indifferent bridge but boy very exciting too|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|skaftij:  this can be defeated with 3x @s after takin @cs|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so south didnt bid anything yet (thats a first) and his partner bids 4@s and he has thid hand....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump makes a lot of sense |pg||
nt|skaftij:  good lead|pg||
nt|xenya: and a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially with West showing at least invitational strength|pg||
pc|c3|nt|famus: i think it was the right thing to do|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and @h K might be a falsecard with KJx|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S has a chnace now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and declarer will make this one - is my guess|pg||
nt|ady: another chance for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3S shows 4S and 5H - Smolen is what I thnk its called|pg||
nt|leao:  no 5@s with d lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: evryone is saying 6@C on the major squeeze|pg||
nt|skaftij:  that will take care of (A)Qxx in North|pg||
nt|brolucius: He could hardly hope to shut out a spade fit if North/South held one.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he can make this but is not easy|pg||
nt|runnerup: so he took @s finess after all|pg||
pc|c2|nt|skaftij:  At last some action :-)|pg||
nt|lml: the problem here is getting to the 1 point hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: also of course it makes life tougher for opps|pg||
nt|barnets: so fleishers imagination brought in 10 more tricks for usa|pg||
nt|barnets: 10 more imps |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 51-5 this set|pg||
nt|barnets: i meant|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: big set for the americans|pg||
nt|barnets: fleisher Kamil were very effective in round robinthird in Butler scoring|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might instead have led the @S10, since he expected West to hold a spade stopper and the lower lead might work well when South held only two spades.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|xenya: can be made on this lead|pg||
nt|lml: once they didnt lead hearts it can be made if you guess all|pg||
nt|yuval10: he just play A@s and J@s|pg||
nt|lml: you need to tap the dummy at trick two|pg||
nt|ady: n/s do have 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: east a little worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: @CK lead not all that appealing on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: west likely to have a strong notrump sort of hand; it could easily cost|pg||
pc|h4|nt|odysseus69: new leader|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course easier said than done|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein works out that there is no miracle layout, so sets up his diamond trick to minimize the damage.|pg||
nt|barnets: the butler scoring scores your result with every other pair playing in opposite direction|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: 1 top trump helps|pg||
nt|lechcold: 130 i -2 impy|pg||
nt|leao:  best decision. shug go 2 off|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah finally he bids|pg||
nt|barnets: and gives a rough idea how each pair is playing|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|wild card: probably he wasn't considering anything else than 6@s, but east had some questions about the auction or kept the tray for a couple of seconds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No play, can cash a @C otherwise make 7.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: trump lead is very appealing on this bidding so duboin might play north for the @SQ from the failure to lead a trump|pg||
nt|ady: west not leading a heart as north had shown 5 hearts  4 spades and a game going hand with 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told that Brink is allergic to PASS cards|pg||
pc|cK|nt|famus: is he going to hook @s straight away?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately the bidding didn't help them diagnose the obvious squeeze :) 1 to me|pg||
nt|xenya: i can't make out NS's auction at all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: looks like  11  Stefanov may actually make 4@H in the Moysian fit|pg||
nt|ady: small trump best|pg||
nt|odysseus69: look it up - i will ask|pg||
nt|ady: but e/w have the same in diamonds|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: cant see how that helps defence|pg||
nt|lechcold: zarówno 1BA jak i pas na 1BA jako mi siê nie podobaj¹:(|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think 5@s is makeable...|pg||
nt|sybarra: club club  maybe|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: on the other hand the threat of a club ruff might make him just bash out @SAK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now, it be even go 2 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East will surely ditch a @h|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what is the range of 1NT - 14-16 i guess but sure to find out in a moment|pg||
nt|ady: 11 in OR     maybe an extra heart as they lay|pg||
pc|h7|nt|leao:  not with @d lead and @h back :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they cannt get there @d tricks|pg||
nt|bt: are the nz team allowed to do that "haka" before their matches? seems like they did against usa1|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: best for declarer to play 2nd round of clubs from east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: in the tank now|pg||
nt|ady: of course we can see that   easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2 times @c|pg||
nt|brolucius: I remember someone sending me a message saying that it was ridiculously unfair on the players for the Butler ranking to be published. Amazing view. |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|pawel90:  1BA pokazuje bilans przynajmniej|pg||

nt|roswolf: a solid result for the azurri|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably:)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|odysseus69: 14-16 confirmed|pg||
nt|panosk: eventually will play diamonds and that is his problem, how to?|pg||
nt|leao:  if he goes for a xruff he may go -1 only|pg||
nt|leao:  rite... always -2|pg||
nt|gracelin: The turbulance seems to be over for he Italians.  They start to play solid bridge with sound judgment as usual.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: he needed to float @S to make  but hard to picture Martel's shape|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a heart  then a@C and a club|pg||
nt|lml: this is a very sensible line|pg||
nt|yuval10: and naturally you play AK@s and go down|pg||
nt|xenya: wrong...|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe that was fro a player who was performing poorly|pg||
nt|brolucius: Might as well say that you should not announce the football results if a team has lost by more than four goals.|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czy kto mo¿e zna termin V Kolumna...to co z wojny hiszpañskiej w 36 roku|pg||

nt|lml: it just doesnt work|pg||
nt|barnets: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: need to play well in the next 2 sets|pg||
mc|9|nt|kit: Of course for the Butler there is some luck involving which pairs you play against, but for the most part the luck evens out and it is a pretty good representation of how things ...|pg||

nt|brolucius: you imagine the Times reporting that 'one of the Arsenal players missed a penalty in the 52nd minute'?|pg||

nt|sybarra: maybe even I could make this one|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suppose the writer did not want his own mistakes written up later.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's double is a take-out double and South has the usualy two duties: to choose a trump suit (or NT) and to show the strength of his hand. Here 2@S would not show his extra ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: strength. |pg||
nt|ady: ended quietly|pg||
nt|gracelin: trump lead?|pg||

nt|bt: wow usa clearly wants to choose sweden|pg||
nt|barnets: I think that is right - some writers go out there way not to though|pg||

nt|runnerup: do more + for Sw..|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: north pened a tactical lead direct 1 spade in 3rd seat to get the right lead if defending|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in OR South found a response to 1H - there is an old system called Acol- where 2H opener shows 8 or more tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: a touch-and-go game, the Q@s makes this contract an excellent one|pg||

nt|skaftij:  otoh, they bid agressively|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: east is stil in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With 12-14 and @c, West would bid 2@c and revert to 2@h over 2@d I think|pg||
nt|ritong: thank you, pard|pg||
nt|bt: thing is we all make horrendous mistakes but it is partnerpreserving to play them yourself|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could not really hope to win the auction to good effect when his partner could not speak over 1@C. So, wiser to pass.|pg||
nt|bt: not only is woolridge upset over his partners bids, he also have to play a really awful contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: East is expecting better clubs opposite because he asked partner to choose between the red suits.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have doubled 1@H to get in the auction safely 1@S should have good shape including clubs on actual auction|pg||
nt|szalay: bald is very agressive today|pg||

nt|skaftij:  sry missed that Israel raeched the slam too, I get so many comments, thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: his head is burried inside his palms|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Better than 6NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now...asking more questions|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ....more questions lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: back to thinking ....do not go away|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With bidding like this and pauses like,  everyone is aware that the contact may be touch and go. They hate to give the match away on the penultimate deal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction would be game force by unpassed hand|pg||
nt|skaftij:  HS can organise a ruff|pg||
nt|skaftij:  NS|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wild card: now the heart ruff is lost|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H back would have yielded a ruff as well.|pg||
nt|leao:  he has to extract the @d ace b4 pulling trumps|pg||
nt|oosmanb: bath coup'esque |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finaly a spade landed on the table|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wild card: and it's only 300|pg||
nt|boedhy:  his @h are too good so no problems indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: so 4 or 5 to Sweden|pg||
nt|ady: lots of tricks now      4 spades   1 diamond   and  3 clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: now defenders can play 3 round of trump so declarer might need to finesse CQ for a H pitch.  The D8 lost to D10 maybe damaging.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Many thanks also to my fellow commentators, Lars and Henry. It was an enjoyable session.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 1@C opening showed 2+, conceivably can have 5 diamonds also if balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice shift|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is not good|pg||
nt|lml: that club play is a problem|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer uses the two trump entries to dummy to lead twice towards his club honours.|pg||
nt|gracelin: eclarer needs to finess in club now, or he is down|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure the Italian in other room will make this 4S, so if Shi goes down here, the match is almost even|pg||
nt|gracelin: play and defense are areas that the Italian have a big advantage ove other teams.|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for link to results|pg||
nt|gracelin: they think harder and deeper.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: the other room just started bidding  13|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yuval10: Israel's next match is against Italy, very tough day for them, they've done great so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the 4/1 @H break is just pesky |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so, remove the 2 slam swings and Iceland would have a narrow lead, that's how close it really is|pg||
nt|ady: and 1 heart|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|barnets: Israel have played well in round robin and this is their poorest set shown so far|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is not particularly worried about suffering a club ruff, because he needs to set up the suit anyway, and a ruff may be with a natural trump trick.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|roswolf: but do they think on the right lines?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lml: he still has nine tricks though|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes drijver will probably get a @h trick at the end|pg||
nt|leao:  hell have to time it carefully|pg||
nt|leao:  but miguel is a careful player :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm so sorry   thought Baldursson rebid 3@D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: 1 imps for Italy|pg||
nt|gracelin: good.  Shi also realized that he must take the club finesse to make.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panosk: thinking if he can do anything about possible bad breaks but he cant so here you are|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: and that will be a push|pg||
nt|lml: heading to an uptrick |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lml: it appears|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not quite bath coup but he won 2 tricks when he deserved 1 in @S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so should make 7 now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|gracelin: on H return, declarer shud ruff in hand and ruff to establish D|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy from here|pg||
nt|gracelin: and even if he ruffs in dummy, CK will be ruffed out so no problem either. |pg||
pc|cT|nt|bt: eschewing diamonds finesse was a thoughtful play|pg||
pc|s8|nt|skaftij:  On  12, Iceland is in 3NT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: I am always happy to add thanks to BBO, for letting us all enjoy these wonderful championships live, at no charge. Long may it last!|pg||
nt|bt: i got to use that word ...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: nearly half way   China still in the hunt|pg||
pc|d7|nt|leao:  see?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  going -200|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ryskiel_: kobiety odnios³y zwyciêstwo na Niemkami...pyrrusowe niestety|pg||
nt|gracelin: why? when CK appeared, just draw trimps and claim|pg||
pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: spectator suggests and I agree - facing a passed partner North should open 4H|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, I thot all clubs are high when they are not.  |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: trumps splitting   so ok     not the greatest game|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: N to the bathroom...|pg||
nt|athene: of course if west doubles a 2@H transfer that might alter things|pg||

nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator, Karen. Great Job! Our appreciation to all the organisers for bringing this festival of bridge to our screens. ...|pg||

nt|gracelin: replied|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: final board of match at our table    3rd/final session of the day scheduled to begin in about 1 hour|pg||
nt|xenya: that's the end for NZ i'm afraid|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all|pg||
mb|1D|nt|skaftij:  This is the last match today|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director is here to watch time for the last board, but I don't think they will be punished because of the 10 min for the director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: probably both teams will make the last 8 and they deserve it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: may hope is that Australia will make the last 8 as well :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: see previous explanation of 1@D|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems South would have been better placed with a 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks to all the commentators and kibs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: now south has the choice of 2@S, weak takeout|pg||
nt|athene: or 2@C "weak stayman"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL = 4 or 5 @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H for e/w looks the spot|pg||
nt|panosk: next match will start in about an hour|pg||
nt|boedhy:  last board|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes all other matches finished|pg||
nt|runnerup: 500 here is good for Nz  but not enougth -ns has to guess well to make any game (3nt)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Many thanks also to Barnet and Kit, my fellow commentators, for their insights into the play.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Weinstein asking about the double|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North asking about the 2c bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Thank you all kibs for good comments, I was not able to bring all forwards |pg||
nt|ady: thx Harold  and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next match at 13.45 hours|pg||
nt|lml: somebody asked about whether the players know about the running score|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a make n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common treatment over Michaels showing Majors  is to use 2@H/@S to show stronger hands in @C/@D   and 3minor just competitive|pg||
nt|szalay: or: 3m: INV|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@H/2@S: either weaker OR stronger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen that treatment|pg||
nt|szalay: we call it COMB|pg||
nt|ady: thx Geoffrey  and Karen  and all specs  |pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: 5@h is a decent save against 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S would be a general takeout without spades|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S ..1 off seems coming up :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s = 3@ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s is excatly what he has|pg||
nt|skaftij:  thanks to our magnificent operator|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bob|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last hand of this match. Thanks to our operator Natalia and specs for watching some absorbing bridge.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big win on last board expected for Swedes|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziwny splinter|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwny|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although 5@D can then only 3 imps win|pg||
nt|lechcold: miejmy nadziejê, ¿e nie bêdzie nieporozumienia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or 3nt|pg||
nt|antoniz: 3NT jest dobre|pg||
nt|lml: they dont but they can usually have a feel for how they are doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems flawed in that it gives opponents extra space when cue can be weak|pg||
nt|ady: low heart lead    should hold declarer to 4 tricks if defence is awake|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: maybe if he bids 2@S now over 2red from his partner, that is invitational|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT... the 2 lowest suits|pg||
nt|ritong: garbage with 3@ss|pg||
nt|athene: so double isn't just exactly 4 spades, as in standard methods|pg||
nt|ady: got there quickly    nust know I would like a cup of tea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul 1@C includes weak NT as well as some strong hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the day, we restart at 10.30 tomorrow|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This is the fastest session I have ever seen on vugraph|pg||
nt|roswolf: a tricky bd to finish with|pg||

mb|2S|nt|ady: thx Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks, last board for the day here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@c must show @d and @s|pg||
nt|wild card: Last board of this match. Next round will start at 13:45 local time (in somewhat more than an hour)|pg||
nt|wild card: is that correct Natalia?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Think so.|pg||
nt|yuval10: answer is of course not|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Thanks everyone, and join us for the next segment|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is only 400|pg||
nt|szalay: not true|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thx Geoffrey and Patrick|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We will be back in about 50 minutes, but I don't know which matches will be on|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: and if he does that north will go to game for sure with a maximum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why East bid 4@H instead of 1@D transfer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry in Polish dzien dobry|pg||
nt|ady: all games failing for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H the best     but fails|pg||
nt|ady: now at  the only making contract |pg||
nt|ady: west considering passing I would think|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to rebid that ht suit, but really no choice|pg||
nt|leao:  4@h?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  dbl from south standard these days |pg||
nt|boedhy:  I think with all the light opening going on you should have more ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ruud was great company, but it is you the spectators who really make it for us, so thanks @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how did that PASS get in there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: a steal for Israel here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tough to find the slam|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzienn dobry:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzien:)|pg||
nt|lml: in a match like this it isnt always as clear till you compare|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East almost played @h3|pg||
nt|panosk: vugraph schedule in your own local times http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and there a daring 2nt from west... 3nt from east??|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s lead........???|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play a neg. X quite that lite,     |pg||
nt|leao:  hungry 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: good save 5@D e/w|pg||
nt|ady: may take the push to 5@H|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok looks 9 on top |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so who is to blame?|pg||
nt|ady: because I want my cup of tea|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol ...for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming weat holds weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weat???   that was supposed to be weSt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  13  Levin in 6@S East|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: wow..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that will be worth some imps to usa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that after Stefanov opened 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south stil thinking ...do not go away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from other room  "Eighteen minutes left, TD telling the players to be a bit quicker. Levin: "Good one when I'm in 6@S""|pg||
nt|ady: play of 6@S easier after £@C opening|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: we will restart in 50 mins from now|pg||

mb|p|nt|skaftij:  in OR, still playing no 30|pg||

nt|xenya: classic reverse by N on 6-3 |pg||
nt|lml: well he has 7-3|pg||
nt|xenya: tes, 6+|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a @d among the @hs|pg||
nt|xenya: could be just 6 i meant|pg||
nt|xenya: now S has a great hand for partner|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2B-2NT = trnsf; according to CC|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin pointed the finger to the 3s bid and then it gave it a finger down lool|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rnmalik: Could make 3NT, 6@D+1@C+2@S=9.|pg||
nt|leao:  it was a very agressive neg x, agree|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think I would lead the @d jack...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink only 7 HCP  but pure fit for partner's majors|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: how do you allocate it?|pg||
nt|lml: we have "both|pg||
nt|lechcold: @CA - lavinthal pikowy i dalej wiadomo|pg||
nt|lml: Weinstein and Levin did well to get to the best slam|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@C is on with A@D right|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and 6NT for same reason|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@c additional chance of ruffing @S good|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it's a good 6@C |pg||
nt|bt: one thing about sloppy play though, its difficult to get back to good bridge|pg||
nt|brolucius: They must play that 2@C promises a major. So, West is able to bid 3@S to show a weak hand and a spade fit.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lechcold: a i bez tego nie ma jak tego graæ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes would be beauty @CA x@S @C for down 1|pg||

nt|oosmanb: dont need A@D onside for 6@C like I said, @S can be ruffed good with K@H entry. 4@S 6@C 2@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but 6NT does need it so 6@C better|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S has shown 5-3-3-2 and 5 AFR points with the 3nt bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I havent seen an explanation of the 4@d bid|pg||
nt|xenya: let's see how well their relay system will work here|pg||

nt|skaftij:  @s Ace aganst 4 @h here, if bid would make declarer task more difficult|pg||
