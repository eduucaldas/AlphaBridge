nt|lebridgeur: 2  nt is what we call mini cue bid|pg||
nt|pamela: not sure she meant the 2NT to  be anything other than some leb auction  but with the values she had I am surprised she did not bid 3H |pg||
nt|pamela: ah  explain  please?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: in Nt   12 easy tricks|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: bidding a suit in response to the double would be weaker|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Zalicytuj swój koloe jakikolwiek masz partnerze?|pg||
nt|antoniz: gracz W ma trudn¹ pozycjê po kontrze partnera|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: ojojoj   -  autostrada|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s now showing a weak raise, a direct 2@s would probably be constructive|pg||
nt|nkgupt: not really dec willl loose control i think|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: exactly Pamela|pg||
nt|pamela: what  is the value of that way ? |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 nt  is 8 to 12 hcp|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: result of the first board is 3@c=|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: welcome again to this session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both USA 1 and China have qualified for the Q finals. USA 1 is 1st, China 4th now|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Kontrakt by³ i tak nie do zdarcia|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: declarer now sees the 0-5 trump split and is not happy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  will be tough|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: thinking how to play it now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c finesse might see him through|pg||
nt|andyv:  there is very little to the play of the hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: as one may guess, 1@d was transfer and 3@d showing shortness with heart support|pg||
nt|star6ija: declarer has his chances but has to deal carefully with the board, because we have 4 trumps with W|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2 teams that are very close in the ranking|pg||
nt|penseur9: there's also http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-venice-cup with live updates during the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3@d not alerted|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all from sunny London  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  hi Mike-wlc:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two spades from dummy can be discarded on the top hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so eight tricks outside trumps - so it looks like South needs to avoid a trump loser|pg||
nt|pamela: any shape>?|pg||
nt|lesio: hohoho|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobrze, ¿e przed parti¹|pg||
nt|garden2005: Grenthe znarszczyl brwi?|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: Kowalski mowi, ze popelnil blad...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rhelle: hello everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: south overcalled 1N in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and DBL 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north has shown @C length  but hasn't passed yet|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rhelle: I am a stand-in commentator, so not familiar with either pair - will do the best I can|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: wlc Rob|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a 3-2 break would be a guess, so declarer might be thinking about a possible 4-1 division - in which case she will come to the right conclusion|pg||
nt|lesio: wist pomocny|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|farrukh: but even then e/w should pick up a few imps |pg||
nt|rhelle: this contract will not overly tax declarer, especially with this lead and the @dK right|pg||
nt|penseur9: difficult but this should make|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes   could show her suit later   here thought she did notneed|pg||
nt|pamela: ok thanks .. |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a swoj¹ drog¹ proszê popatrzeæ jak to jest z tymi konwencjami - nie sztuka ustaliæ znaczenie pierwszego wejcia, trzeba jeszcze ustaliæ dalsze kroki|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nkgupt: there it is|pg||
nt|kamyk: na razie wszystko z kontr¹ - chc¹ sobie pokazaæ nawzajem, kto  rz¹dzi na stole?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: Hackett has been thinking a long time  but she doesn't seem to have any winning options|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dodgy start - still, there are 96 boards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, priv|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: you can pick up Q9xx in West, but not in East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so I predict that this will be 1370 and 12 imps to the Chinese|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so, if declarer leads a small trump towards dummy, it would be good for West to play the nine |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there may be a clue in East's 4@h bid - if East has length in the majors, possibly more likely to be short in diamonds - but I don't know how much can be read into that, ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: particularly at this vulnerability   |pg||
nt|ahalim: oops|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: obie strony maj¹ co nieco do roboty w tym rozdaniu|pg||
nt|antoniz: mam nadziejê,¿e nie znajdzie wygrywaj¹cej lini rozgrywki|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Wygrywaj¹ca jest nienaturalna|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Jonsson overcalled with 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: must prevent S from taking a trick, so he can draw trumphs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: thrumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: each country has his or her own shirts here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Iceland is in yellow, Japan in light orange|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes, bot are on the right side of the line, so we exect tight match here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rhelle: however, there are some mild communication problems|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi all|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume they explained 2@s as relay asking for hand type and forgot to alert the answer?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|star6ija: both*|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E is playing with another partner today then yesterday|pg||
nt|star6ija: this play of the spades ensures only 1 loser if E was with 10x Q10, K10...the most persentage play|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a je¿eli Kowalski mówi, ¿e pope³ni³ b³¹d, to trzeba jeszcze ustalenia zapamiêtaæ, co jest tym trudniejsze im rzadziej jaka sekwencja przychodzi|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lesio: mi sie wydaje ze Apekowi zamiast 4@H wypod³o 4@D z biddingboxu|pg||
nt|lesio: 4@C powinni byc do koloru|pg||
nt|garden2005: jak siê widzi takiego dziada to kazdemu s³abo sie robi|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: mamy system na 400 stron|pg||

pc|d7|nt|vugraphzpb: hm|pg||

nt|andyv:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011 for live feed of another table in the bermuda bowl|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: some discussion in Swedish|pg||

nt|odysseus69: good morning all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: good morning :)|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi Victor-wlc:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2 out of 2 finesses for slam - no good but unlikely to bid it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at start of this match  Germany 7th place  Poland 12th|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes sun and ming|pg||
nt|pamela: wang and sun are formidable players..  played against them    they are so intense and focused when they play |pg||
nt|vbman: --------------------19-----------------------|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 9 tricks for E/W|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Wygrywa³o: dwa razy Kiery, Pika na Karo - i @C Dama!|pg||
nt|garden2005: kto s³abo wchodzi ten na dudka wychodzi :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N can make a couple of @ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW about the same in @hs|pg||
nt|vbman: board 19|pg||
nt|lesio: tak jak bokserzy badaja przeciwnika:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: narazie skutecznoæ karnych kontr jest niedu¿a|pg||
nt|lesio: dobrze ze uzgodnili @C a nie @D:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak na taki rozjazd stracili tylko2 impy to musz¹ ten mecz wygraæ....inaczej bêd¹ mieli bliskie spotkanie III stopnia ze mn¹:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rhelle: looks like EW can make 6@h, whereas NS have a good save (-1) in 6@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: that save has been found at the other table|pg||
nt|odysseus69: fearless 2H overcall -too rich for my taste - maybe thats why I am not playing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 21 matches   top 8 teams advance to knockout phase|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT can be played as 19-21 in fourth seat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which will probably lead to 4@h|pg||
nt|vbman: when some one checks for the vu later they dont get for which board comments are made|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cicus: again not easy for NS to enter the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h=xfer to @s|pg||
nt|pamela: bull dogs when they see an opening to cut you up! lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: now EW  wuill not play a @h contract|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: no double - no trouble seems apt here|pg||
nt|cicus: as usual, the hand with shortness acts|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d probably 5-7 with @ds|pg||
nt|star6ija: declarer in the open room had played trumps, but without finesse, so 13 IMPs for USA, thanks to safety play|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: missing 4@h by E/W?|pg||
nt|jaker: pretty routine 3n here|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@h opening in third position is quite normal at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs adjust responses after Stayman-DBL  to clarify @C holding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 0/2 on predictions so far  |pg||
nt|antoniz: albo,po eliminacji blotka trefla do 8-ki|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dburn:  and that is a weak hand with 5 spades and a minor by West|pg||
nt|dburn:  the New Zealand pair using Moscito, a system that does not allow very many passes in first or second or third position|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 @c pass or correct in minor|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 Nt practical now by East|pg||
nt|pamela: looks like another three NTer|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: lub impas wewnêtrzny w treflach|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rhelle: 2@d is no doubt a transfer to @h|pg||
nt|dburn:  some guesses for declarer - normal to pick up spades, will probably lose two hearts, so much will depend on clubs|pg||
nt|benjy: Hi all|pg||
nt|ahalim: this will be a partscore-battle|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: D'Ovidio giving up very fast|pg||
nt|hobakan: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobry wieczór wszystkim...panowie nie dostarczaj¹ nam chwil radoci,mo¿e chocia¿ panie siê nad nami zlituj¹|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: vulnerable 2@H overcall seems to be ' brave ' |pg||
nt|lesio: APEK BEZ ATU NA 14:)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|skaftij:  The convention card for EW does not explicitly say 16+|pg||
nt|star6ija: very high pressure by North|pg||
nt|fluffy: north rebids 1NT with 5422 wich is also very common nowdays|pg||
nt|penseur9: likely 3NT from E/W here|pg||
nt|penseur9: wrong :)|pg||
nt|pelu: oh 3NT was the last stop for EW|pg||
nt|eweber: open is playing 3nt|pg||
nt|pelu: and in OR von Arnim in 3NT|pg||
nt|pamela:  the lack of Heart support  from Lu should  encourage her to bid it   |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not easy for West|pg||
nt|pamela: no  she will be  trying to decide if P wants the H support   because the original double should show some diam surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and rightly so since this will make on this layout|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, is that not a penalty bid?|pg||
nt|rhelle: lots of top players play transfers in these competitive situations|pg||
nt|star6ija: they may win some IMPs more, due to this 3@ss gadget|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 2 @c Roudinesco|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: true, N had no means to invite|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: a new chance for 3 NT|pg||
nt|pamela: yes   |pg||
nt|pamela: a girl could grow old here :-) |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West is  known to have long @h  after Ns bids|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: takie wydarzenie powinno podnieæ morale pary na wysokoæ co najmniej Matterhornu|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: I'm told that 2@d is just a GF |pg||
nt|jaker: we'll probably see a range of opening leads across the various matches. I'd try a heart myself|pg||
nt|dgame: @h lead sets the contract|pg||
nt|odysseus69: many different ways of raising spades these days - exactly what 2NT showed is a matter of p/ship agreement|pg||
nt|lesio: po naszemu magister|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rhelle: I can see the logic of that - 6@c also looks a distinct possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it was expl. as strong|pg||
nt|nkgupt: great lead!!|pg||
nt|pelu: @H-lead even better - would kill dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: only 8 toptricks - and hard work to setup the 9.|pg||
nt|nkgupt: cant see time to setup anything on the given lead|pg||
nt|nkgupt: infact cant see any other game but ofr 5@d making on any decent def|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S is looking at the convention card of E/W for leads|pg||
nt|penseur9: it seems there's no way to recoup here..|pg||
nt|pelu: in 3Nt the are only 7 toptrick with @hs 5-2 - extra trick in S but the 9. tyrick if difficult not playing DD|pg||
nt|pelu: is 4Nt for Aces or last stop?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I think W alerted it|pg||
nt|penseur9: I think last stop... something went wrong here in the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: cant see what she has written|pg||
nt|eweber: theoretically W has the points for her jump to 3@d, but I assume most experts would find another bid|pg||
nt|pelu: easy for EW in OR after 1@C strong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, the 4@H guess was right :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will have a pretty good idea where most of the oustanding high cards are|pg||
nt|vbman: makes 4cl, 3sp 2h , two dia|pg||
pc|d3|nt|skaftij:  1NT would have been 15-17 in that pos. |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Using standard openings and relays after 1@C opening - 1@D  promises 4 and unbal/semibal|pg||
nt|ahalim: @S contract is actually better for EW|pg||
nt|fluffy: despite being way behind on HCP NS get to play this hand, teh lie out is not very friendly, lets see what they can do|pg||
nt|copeyj: b2|pg||
nt|copeyj: Sorry - private :(|pg||
nt|pamela: oh wow|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a po anglosasku checkback Stayman|pg||
nt|lesio: z dobrej reki|pg||
nt|garden2005: przejmie i podegra?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cicus: still, with a passed partner you don't have to pursuit nonvul games|pg||
nt|rhelle: now, have they agreed what to do over intervention of 4NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2 popular schemes are DOPI-ROPI and DEPO-REPO|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Was intending to show 18-19 bal|pg||
nt|fluffy: the diamond suit is "frozen" wich means that any player who touches it will olose a trick|pg||
nt|fluffy: teh club suit is gonna be frozen soon also|pg||
nt|eweber: 3NT wouzld have been my choice with semibal hand and many points in the short suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W to S : I thought it would be to play|pg||
nt|pelu: one good news for W - no X :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be possible to endplay East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after a partial elimination   but don't quote me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the problem is vonArnim @C10|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i surely would have bid game after pass pass, weak opening|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: kiepsko zacz¹³ siê ten segment...w poprzednim zaczêlimy od jednego jajka, teraz od dwóch|pg||
nt|lesio: musi wybicK@D|pg||
nt|w_adam: po pikowym chyba bez szans - musi Apek zmienic na karo teraz|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: bo jak siê otwiera BA podlimitowo, to musi byæ dobra rêka do BA|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry club suit is not frozen, @c9 protects east's @cJ|pg||
nt|pelu: so as I expected: 4Nt to play |pg||
nt|ahalim: decl will lose 1@S,1@D and 1@C|pg||
nt|lesio: :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  @h switch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South almost 100% to hold the spade ace, so no guess on the lead|pg||
nt|lesio: dobry wist|pg||
nt|lesio: 9@H mogla pomoc rozgrywajacemu|pg||
nt|antoniz: kiery zablokowane|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: maybe he expected 5-5|pg||
nt|dgame: cold then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so after @CA @D @D @S @S @S  @C  west can win|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rhelle: Double=0, Redouble=1 or Even / Odd|pg||
nt|rhelle: it seems they didn't quite understand each other|pg||
nt|dburn:  England rather fortunate on board 2, where they reached a somewhat ridiculous 3NT that had about eight or nine losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: slyszy Was :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andyv:  although N may continue with @s and expect S to be able to overruff dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: @c10 now - or @H work for defense|pg||
nt|pelu: against 3Nt: @D lead from N - and easy 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@d|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: but then maybe @H9 is powerful|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now it's virtually double dummy - expect West to drop the @CQ  |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Muidenberg is called the  opening bid of 2 of a major with a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: probably 3NT instead of second double,|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: same here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fluffy: migry decides to go over diamonds, she loses 1 trick by touching the suit, but she stablishes 2 extra ticks for partner|pg||
nt|vbman: that makes 11 and maybe one from a h , sp squeeze after dia ace is drawn|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rhelle: so although EW miss slam, they still pick up 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: now 10 tricks for E/W|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na drugim stole 3 BA gra E...ciêzko mu bêdzie wygraæ po pikowym oj nielekko|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: couhd have made 6 on heart lead but not now|pg||

nt|dburn:  this will be a 1@d opening, I guess|pg||
nt|dburn:  four hearts, not four spades, minor suit canape possible|pg||
nt|dburn:  choice of actions for South now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3@s was indeed a preemptive bid, making it imp. for E/W to find @h|pg||
nt|eweber: A1097 instead of Q1097|pg||
nt|penseur9: that was a very costly misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit of violence on the other room, but 5@H scores 650, so no huge matter |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: needs to play in @H here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn:  she can bid 1@h as a distributional takeout, or double as a more balanced takeout, or overcall in her long suit|pg||
nt|benjy: how do you feel about her choice david?|pg||
nt|dburn:  would have doubled myself, with 1@h as second choice - not all that keen on 2@c|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn:  but double nd 1@h lead to murkier later auctions than 2@c, which may have influenced matters|pg||
nt|benjy: super agressive 2NT bid by Fiona|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks like no troubles for declarer here|pg||
nt|pelu: easy 4@H - time to make coffee :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: modern tendency is to bid 5 card major - ok when strong enough for second bid - but facing a passed partner and minimum with both majors I prefer double|pg||
nt|ritong: the correct bid is 3@h, for a french|pg||
nt|ritong: also for a german|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east will probably double and in due course bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=2011Veldhoven&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CConventionCards|pg||
nt|pelu: give N @DK and not @SK - then plsy for slam|pg||
nt|fluffy: straightforward bidding for EW|pg||
nt|fluffy: stansby has to decide between rebidding her good hearts or bidding 3NT protecting @sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: again limited 4+@H possible canape [longer] @C/@D|pg||
nt|westjava: hi every one!|pg||
nt|westjava: sry late:)|pg||
nt|lesio: wygra³ przez @D:) ale @H trafi³:)|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: ...Apek zagra³ kiery gór¹ zak³¹daj¹c, ¿e karo jest nie do odebrania po ich dwukrotnym zagraniu|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Francuzi ju¿ nic nie trafiaj¹ - 3 BA jest z czapy jak podpowiada mi tu jeden z kibiców:)|pg||
nt|lesio: naszym wypuscili |pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: DONT LIKE EAST'S PASS and 4@S is not the best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then pick event/country to get partnership convention card|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, 2@c is supposed to deliver more of a suit and / or more of a hand|pg||
nt|benjy: So you would bid over 2@C?|pg||
nt|dburn:  just about - could well have enough for 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: so I would like to pay more attention to the previous board|pg||
nt|vbman: very cool its no time to dbl 2h for pen|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn:  but this lead knocks out the entry to the clubs, so we may well not have enough for 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  although other things are reasonably favourable (e.g. the diamonds), so this will be close|pg||
nt|pamela: seen worse  but there is quite a bit of work to do on this hand .. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with @H 2/1 split its made, 1 ruff and 1 discard. other chance if @H are 3/0 club 4/3 or long @C with @H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eweber: well, after 4@d there wasn't a safe spot any more|pg||
nt|penseur9: this make easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: good bid by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought 2@H promised 4-fit :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: East looking at the conv card|pg||
nt|vbman: a heart underlead?|pg||
nt|vbman: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: now N/S seem to miss their best fit in @c|pg||
nt|ritong: nevertheless, lasserre will drive this to at least 5@c imo|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Jakby wistowali jak ludzie: normalnie, odwrotnie lub odmiennie - to by ob³o¿yli...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: did east want a double from w?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|andyv:  now N have to cash out immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS|pg||
nt|odysseus69: which heart to lead - having raised top of 3 is right|pg||
nt|westjava: hi pak Arifin!|pg||
nt|ahalim: hi Liliek|pg||
nt|lesio: wiedzia³ ze wist by³ z dubla i moze oddaæ 2 @H bo dostanie lewe na @C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  and the contract allowed to make|pg||
nt|lesio: tutaj raczej tego nie bêdzie|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzpb: she is moving now to get a good seat, if possible|pg||
nt|star6ija: As Radoslav Radev pointed, 3 in Major weak is used by Eric Kokisch, who is a kind of advisor of strongest US players|pg||
nt|fluffy: sh picks the right one, 3NT is doomed on a spade lead|pg||
nt|pelu: but also 4NT would be a hard work to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W is asking how many @h N has with the 2@h raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: can she have 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: which seems about 80%ish|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  a sizeable swing for EW|pg||
nt|fluffy: it takes a diamond lead to beat 4@h quickly|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: swoj¹ drog¹ by³o w tym sporo pecha...|pg||
nt|antoniz: to prawda|pg||
nt|garden2005: dobry wieczór wszystkim :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: witaj:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witaj Grzesiu|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|benjy: if she wins in dummy and leads a spade up east has to duck to give the defence a chance|pg||
nt|odysseus69: got to develop club trick - interesting to see what happens |pg||
nt|odysseus69: cashing the diamonds will cause pain to all 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: small @s to the J seems a way to go|pg||
nt|pamela: they are on their way|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: alas very unfortunate|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w³anie|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: small club to jack looks better|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 11 lew|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fluffy: declarer can't avoid a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|vbman: can underlead later but must not help|pg||
nt|ritong: good stop|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: Upmark had option to Relay to get information about South hand, but elected to show @C with some shortness|pg||
nt|dburn:  East opened at the other table also, and South elected to double|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Witamy|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: indeed!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that looked right from here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with 8,9 of @c this seems ok|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spade Q best but no good|pg||
nt|westjava: it's true, @H from decl?|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes that's the 9th trick|pg||
nt|westjava: ohh ya:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@H, 6@D and 1@C|pg||
nt|lesio: z taka rozgrywka seniorzy do OPEN|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dburn:  West bid 1NT, which ended the auction, and eight tricks were taken|pg||
nt|dburn:  but they were taken by the defenders, so NZ have a useful plus 200|pg||
nt|benjy: this is cold now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not many will bid and make game here|pg||
nt|w_adam: wbrew pozorom nie jest to takie oczywiste|pg||
nt|lesio: teraz @s|pg||
nt|w_adam: Jak Jacek szarpnie asa karo to na pewno ob³o¿¹|pg||

nt|w_adam: raczej z tej pozucji to juz nie ma takiej mozliwosci jak Apek zagra³ kiera|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fluffy: there was still a chance for the defence if simons had switched to spades|pg||
nt|penseur9: one looser in @H, @D and @C|pg||
nt|ahalim: too late|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jaker: if north had chosen to overcall EW might stumble into spades, which I think makes 10 tricks, rather luckily|pg||
nt|fluffy: cos declarer needs to guess if she has to paly @sK or @sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW do not canape with majors    1@H could be 4@H 4@S   so maybe Auken guessed that wasn't happening and liked preemptive value of 2@H over 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: her 1N would have shown 0-3@S|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|westjava: the late @S lead|pg||
nt|westjava: she cant find, cause of 1@S respond I think|pg||
nt|kamyk: i odwrotnie:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: unfortunately I don't know any of the NS meanings  after the 1st 2 or 3 bids|pg||
nt|cicus: seems they do|pg||
nt|dburn:  sure - it may well have been cold anyway, but winning the first spade has certainly done no good for the defence|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cicus: perfect contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this defence, declarer has his life easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: her life, it's the Venice Cup|pg||
nt|fluffy: again there will be a chance if Stansby doesn't cash @cJ soon to discard her @sJ|pg||
nt|lesio: odwrotnie to chyba sie nie da|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: a spec suggests west should pass 3@H - THAT GOOD EASILY BE RIGHT - but east isnt guaranteed to have the hand he has - east failure to double 3@H should have cost him a packet|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in OR, defenders cut spade communication with the opening lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: stansby is afraid of clubs breaking badly obviously|pg||
nt|westjava: one of basic I was learn is, attack dummy suit|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: and actualyy has:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: another good result for India|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they are discussing the explanation|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems ideal to me - and n/s have only themselves to blame for the disaster|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is called|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: by Brazil|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry i meant e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec asks why td called|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is asking sw for explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W / S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: about 3@h bid and explanation; it was only alerted for E, not for W|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it is sour grapes and e/w are trying to win back the board in the appeals room|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 4@s was 1 down|pg||
nt|roswolf: imo e/w were crazy in not doubling 3@H OR INDEED NOT PASSING 3@h out vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3@h could be hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: they played in the wrong suit and they should have just played bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: already some interesting first boards|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done NZ|pg||
nt|kamyk: czas zrobi swoje|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c3|nt|dburn:  but it will be a few more IMPs to New Zealand, who started this tournament very well, have faded a little, but are still comfortably in the hunt for a qualifying spot|pg||

nt|westjava: where r u come from, don?|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!s|nt|vugraphzpb: TD is collecting the written expl of 3@h :-)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a nice hand for the majors over a strong nt|pg||
nt|dburn:  North-South play a weak no trump, so this may be an upgrade|pg||
nt|star6ija: and Wests in both rooms chose diferent ways of acting, as well as Norths. US tactics was winning in both rooms, so deserved 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i like 4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, with a correct diamond guess, EW can make twelve tricks in diamonds or spades|pg||

nt|ahalim: bid|pg||

nt|fluffy: stansby is trully loaded, she might be thinking about slam now|pg||
nt|fluffy: the best way to handle the hand now is with 4@c splinter, migry will then know that her @cK is useless and sing off in 4@s quickly|pg||
nt|fluffy: splinter avoids the club duplication|pg||
nt|pamela: but no   there is only one club   in Lu hand  |pg||

nt|star6ija: now it is interesting to see weak 2 openning with 2 Aces|pg||
nt|jaker: anyone else surprised by the 4 heart bid? |pg||
nt|fluffy: if for example stansby bids now 4@c over 3@s|pg||
nt|fluffy: not migry might think @cK is facing @cA|pg||
nt|fluffy: and overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: never sure of the wisdom of that - if partner holds Qx opposite your AKJxxx, for example, partner will hardly imagine that you have six tricks in the suit |pg||

nt|odysseus69: 500 good result again for NZ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the chinese bid very aggresive in the other room opening 1@S with easts hand. Ending in 3@C +2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  4@h could have gone down 2 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@dX was made in OR|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: she has 11pt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems hopeless on this layout|pg||
nt|andyv:  so NS will win imps no matter what happens here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Predictably they played previous in 3D in open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now must guess @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which she should get right|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Director came in to tell they are running a bit late|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2 nt = @d|pg||
nt|vbman: seem so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: toilet break here|pg||
nt|vbman: break after the lead?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  the dbl by S should guide declarer on how to play the @s suit|pg||
nt|fluffy: anyway everything is lieing very well for EW, and they can't lose anything but 2 aces, so slipping a bit wouldn't matter here|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a large number of pairs in the Bermuda Bowl are playing  1m-(1@H)-1@S = 0-3@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for them  DBL = 4/5@S and they have other bids for 6+@S|pg||
nt|rhelle: that said, both red suits are so kind for declarer, that 3NT always makes|pg||
nt|ahalim: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i think i can read 9-13 on one of the notes|pg||

nt|odysseus69: spade lead for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: and wake up a sleeping tiger,don?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E had 5@d as bidding card ready, but rethought about this bid and decided to bid 3@h first (cue, control, natural?)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: looks as if E/W can make 3nt here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: e.g. 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  2@H for INV+ and 2@S weak  is frequent treatment|pg||

nt|dgame: 4@h a bit better|pg||
nt|don_kapu: dont see the posible oh 6@C|pg||
nt|eweber: for the excuse of East can be said that it is difficult for her to imagine that partner has only 5@d for her jump to 5@d|pg||
nt|don_kapu: no, i come here by IFO (identified Flying Object)|pg||
nt|westjava: can u beat 4@H?|pg||

nt|westjava: oh sry, 4@H will off|pg||
nt|don_kapu: a @C lead maybe defeated 4@H|pg||
nt|baldfriede: hrd to say what exactly 3@h means without knowing their system|pg||
nt|baldfriede: hard*|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: hard to say indeed, also 3@d forcing or not; it seems non-forcing....|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak to by³o po radziecku? burnyje ap³odismienty?|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Not so much fuss here, straight to the slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  better from South as it happens, this - West doesn't have an obvious club lead|pg||
nt|dburn:  but she may be put off a diamond by North's bid in the suit - not sure what that meant|pg||
nt|star6ija: according to the auction E may ask for Spade continuation though|pg||
nt|jaker: can hope for someone to have Kx or Qx, but if it's east, she can unblock the honor, so you normally try to cash it early, preferably by leading to it, before they see the danger|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N is counting and counting and counting while looking at her cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  she wasn't, but that has blown a tempo for the defence, and declarer can get the long diamond going before the defence can get a club|pg||
nt|vbman: yes sp hook looks ok but maybe she plays on h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes|pg||
nt|vbman: cause sp hook works when j is tripleton|pg||
nt|vbman: dia to the q and h to 9 is double dummy indeed|pg||
nt|garden2005: 4BA Jacka pomog³o|pg||
pc|s3|nt|skaftij:  This cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: agree, one K off, one not|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: in the mean time, N went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is a little bit dangerous for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: politely asking the Japan for admittance|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit of play in this - but as spades are 3-3, and @SQ is an entry, it is likely to make |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: if she continues @C this will be two off, 2@C 2@S 1@H 1@D|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: wow|pg||
nt|pamela: no double!!! surely that is a forcing pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: well small @H would be interesting from QJ9xx :) will probably beat it!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: my immediate reaction is that it has same benefit of all transfer responses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there is a large group - especially in north america  that wants to apply law of total tricks   so  Neg DBL = exactly 4@S and 1@S=5+|pg||
nt|cicus: that was a popular treatment here even before the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: can't tell why|pg||
nt|ahollan1: momentum|pg||
nt|rhelle: mmmm leading the @dQ is a losign play when South has the singleton K|pg||
nt|rhelle: so in general, when you don't have the 10, low to the J is better|pg||
nt|dgame: u rite kapu 12 or 13 imps for germany|pg||
nt|don_kapu: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the diamond blockage is moderately helpful as well |pg||
nt|westjava: 2@C in dummy in my eyes|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: it seems   that west pass is forcing kind|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she alerted it so it should be forcing by her|pg||
nt|kamyk: pamiêtam frazê: "oklaski przechodz¹ce w owacje" :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn:  assuning declarer plays that way, of course, and does not rely on a heart to the king|pg||
nt|benjy: can't she try both by leading a @D now|pg||
nt|dburn:  she can certainly combine chances in some way, yes|pg||
nt|hobakan: what about 4NT.. it's 4 th step.|pg||

pc|c3|nt|star6ija: we have to point out that 4@s is ice cold contract, so some swing (even double game) is possible|pg||
nt|jaker: can also play for east to have 10x, by leading low to the 8 or 9, and then leading the j (intrafinesse)|pg||

nt|alunand14: yes :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  tiny @h game for NS - easier to play than to bid, actually|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night...I hope we get some sleep:)|pg||
nt|benjy: If East had returned a club their would declarer have had to guess|pg||
nt|benjy: as if @Ds were 4-2 then she would have to lead up to the @H king?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 IMPs Japan as far as US pair i the OR played in 5@d for 1 down|pg||
nt|eweber: most pairs play suit pref. when dummy is short|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: a @d lead is better|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: New Zealand now has a 10 imp lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: weak NT lost the part score battle -|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: their range for 2@C=10-16|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N would be INV+ in @C, so 3@C=... less than invite  :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: but will they reach it?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzpb: after a long thinking pause by Deas|pg||

nt|jkmjanusz: Te Piki u Apka sa stale - i jakos tak bardziej pechowe...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think Peter Weichsel started that trend when playing with Alan Sontag|pg||
nt|rhelle: this looks like another 3NT contract|pg||
nt|westjava: mb they will bid|pg||
nt|w_adam: teoretycznie N stawa³ w fajnym przymusie na 3 kolory, ale przy dobrej obronie mozna sobie z tym poradziæ (na zagrane ma³e karo S musia³by wstawiæ króla)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: faktycznie, czyli na drugim stole wypuszczono szlemika|pg||

nt|w_adam: koñcówki w obydwa starsze|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: well, south didn't think long before bidding it|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@D = weak 2. 3NT certainly frisky|pg||
nt|don_kapu: very cheap bidding|pg||
nt|fluffy: another simple balanced hadn rebid|pg||
nt|pelu: still only chance with the dummy she see|pg||
nt|pelu: could never cost|pg||
nt|eweber: ssure, this is what I said, but defense was not as silly as it looks with open cards|pg||
nt|westjava: let's see|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 22 + 8 = 30 and she know that|pg||
nt|don_kapu: can't even make 5|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: na drugim stole niestety nic dobrego nie da siê powiedzieæ o akcji naszej pary - brak kontry, puszczona lewa|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: it is certainly key part of Meckwell [RM Precision] and  RM Lite which is played by many top US pairs now|pg||
nt|cicus: makes competitive bidding easier but constructive bidding as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure the adjustment was to improve constructive bidding|pg||
nt|fluffy: depending on your agreements, 1@c-1NT might deny 4@d cards|pg||
nt|fluffy: it that's the case simons might have opted to play 3@c instead of 1NT, but she decided to stay at a low lever this time|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now they may not find club fit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6NT no good|pg||
nt|lesio: 5@H powie |pg||
nt|lesio: chyba|pg||
nt|w_adam: z rêki W 11 lew w @S, niestety Apek nie rozpocz¹³ od pika|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  3@h was not a favorite to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @s suit sitting favorably for declarer, 3@s should make...losing 1@s, 2@h and 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W want to go to slam; 4@s is a cue|pg||
nt|fluffy: defence might cash first 9 tricks for down 3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now, let's see if North is inclined to lead her partner's suit|pg||
nt|ritong: as it looks currently, and chances are extremely high it will stay, french opponent will be poland in semis|pg||
nt|ritong: when USA teams have to meet at that stage|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the USA women play slow|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this will make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this is a demonstration of why 2C is the right rebid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant see how South can bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it seems very hard now to reach the best slam; 6@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the NS convention card makes reference to additional notes, but the pdf file doesn't have the supplementary sheet |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vonArnim will be disappointed with dummy's @S spots|pg||
nt|alunand14: but bad distribution :(|pg||
nt|westjava: 1@S and 1@H losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@S|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 2@S|pg||
nt|alunand14: 2@S|pg||
nt|westjava: agreed:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: [having played some form of big club since 1971]|pg||
nt|pelu: Gernamy in 6@d - no D so 11 IMP for Germany|pg||
nt|westjava: @SJ942|pg||
nt|lesio: BA jest dobra z reki Apka:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: ohoh, S trying to create entry for a @D lead, no luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: im sorry missed a pass,|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 club ruffs are enough to win (as we see)|pg||
nt|tomi2: in that 6m hand we see many tables bidding and some making contracts like 6NT or 7 in a minor. 7 Clubs oftn fails because the @SA is on lead, 7@D makes on some tables. Did not spot ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: that the French auction here is so good, but nowadays Blackwood is out of fashion, so well done to them ;)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: assuming 4NT quantitative|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably the @D2 was encouraging..... |pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: bd 20 india gained 12 imps but it is subject to a td ruling here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: slowly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: he has to develop a @c|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 5, East lead @d ace so 4@h making, 10 imps to Iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: club ruff|pg||
nt|benjy: I'm afraid I have to go, goodluck England, thanks David|pg||
nt|don_kapu: NS can competitive till 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: no expl. on 4NT given|pg||
nt|odysseus69: easy to reach after 2C rebid|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer will soon discover !A onside|pg||
nt|rhelle: The Moysian fit ... with the trumps so well placed, it's bound to succeed as well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  The @s position MAY yield 3 tricks for the defense if S had lead jack|pg||
nt|hobakan: not a good time for rasing to 5|pg||
nt|jaker: perhaps a misunderstanding. When you play both Jacoby and texas transfers, normally one of them is a slam try, and the other is sign-off. The auction suggests that they may have ...|pg||
nt|jaker: been on different wave lengths|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: misunderstanding about 4@h bid, W thinks it was for slam, E to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they just discussed this (in Italian.... ;))|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: :0|pg||
nt|fluffy: they need not to block the hearts though|pg||
nt|alunand14: only 10 tricks in @S or NT|pg||
nt|vbman: ah blew 1 trick|pg||
nt|vbman: 7 for ned.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cicus: he had a tough lead, trumps excluded and 4 small also unattractive|pg||
nt|cicus: I sympathize with him if that matters much|pg||
nt|cicus: there is still hope for NS - a @H ruff and maybe declarer won't pick up spades|pg||
nt|cicus: very faint chance, to be sure|pg||
nt|farrukh: and there was no need for a @h finesse actually...it was just a practice finesse:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems @H finesse was an illusion|pg||
nt|vbman: do you specs notice the dutch pair is playing outrageously|pg||
nt|w_adam: -1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|glen: if FX stands for "special effects" we have had some fireworks already at this table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Farrukh's comment got there first|pg||
nt|odysseus69: on the bidding West should lead a spade - South marked with shortage|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: very good @h return from N|pg||

nt|fluffy: this sohouldn't be a problem for Migry, she has huge support and invitational or more values, she should bid at least 3@c now, but most likelly 2@h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: this cant be right!?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=5-7zz, some splinter  [A=3 K=2 Q=1]|pg||

nt|pelu: @C-lead to Q and @DK would defeat, but still problems|pg||
nt|eweber: OPen is playing 3@h only|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: It was|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but how do they stop out of slam if West has (say ) @DQxx? |pg||
nt|mdgraham: virtually the same auction next door|pg||
nt|vbman: l hear that chinese are breathing hard at the neck of italians?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it seems also amost a game in N/S possible|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: Cullin is just making forcing noises -- Upmark clarifying hand   we just don't know the specifics|pg||
nt|andyv:  N doesn't know yet how favorably everything lies for her|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Kibs - tell me - what do u normal play here?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - South did bid clubs this time- she learns fast|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: good defence shoud beat 3NT   France revival in wiew ?|pg||
nt|antoniz: maj¹c 9 kart w starszych kolorach,nie ba³ siê koñcówki w starszy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzpb: does 2@h show 6-card? then with 4 trumps can show @hQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think they rebid 2@H with nothing extra to say|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E promised a stronger hand than she has|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: however clarification of 2@c opening unclear|pg||
nt|eweber: oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: well, good lead at least|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rhelle: 1@c is a stretch, as far as I'm concerned. I'd be happy to pass that West hand. 12 points, but such a load of cr.p ...|pg||
nt|rhelle: In the end , I think East does well not to make a further slam try|pg||
nt|andyv:  when W wins @d and returns @h, N will have to put up the K|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: interesting bidding here|pg||
nt|westjava: mb try to play @S now|pg||
nt|vbman: but they are still the favourites|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems a strange decision at trick 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: fortunately the @CA is right|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer needs to "unblock" the spade ace next|pg||
nt|skaftij:  BD 6 OR: Jonsson plays 5@c D for a pickup to Iceland|pg||
nt|star6ija: they reached good contract|pg||
nt|fluffy: still IMO she passed too quickly, the hand deserved a deeper consideration|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cicus: 6@H is the right target - trump losers may be a problem if spades are chosen|pg||
nt|farrukh: if i remember these relays correctly, N has shown 6+@s in a balanced hand and his controls, either in standard way or in zz terms|pg||
nt|odysseus69: its all about jack of diamonds|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 6 BA te¿ równie¿|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|don_kapu: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|vbman: l expect an italy-netherland final|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will have to shift to @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: even if they tried to find better spot bidding 3N, I doubt E would leave them there having 11 cards in major|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zalicytowa³e to graj chopie|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w czarne go Jacku w carne|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: my guess about 2@D response came from Nystrom-Bertheau Supplementary Notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assumed same relay structure even though they use different opening 2-bids|pg||
nt|cicus: upmark-cullin system notes (page 4) confirm your explanation, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 7   Nystrom-Bertheau got shut out of @S, sold to 2@C South  and Pakistan on the board with 11 imps|pg||
nt|farrukh: if S is thinking so long there may have been some glitch in the relays|pg||
nt|pelu: most kibs: dont play my suit! - bit for sure here Fredin wont @C-lead :)|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|dburn:  1@h spades, 2NT spade raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: afraid that east got a@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she only needs four @H tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cicus: as I said I think this is slightly inferior to 6@H but OK now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Masood currently in 6@H but Ahmed still has a bid|pg||
nt|cicus: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|alunand14: lah, menang @S mestinya cabut trump dulu ?|pg||
nt|pamela: imps back to France |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on the same lead declarer played @s and got a @h switch|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzpb: W explained his X as " I think it will go down" on the paper|pg||
nt|fluffy: partner's failure to bid 4@s is not bad news after all|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: now declarer will have a sinking feeling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H in other room|pg||
nt|hobakan: but of course unlucky diamond distribution..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running scores   http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-venice-cup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no changes in leader board for Venice Cup or Bermuda Bowl   i haven't checked Seniors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is penultimate match in the Round Robin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 advance to KO|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Germany 7th  Poland 12th|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cicus: two playing options here - either draw trumps and hope @Hs come in or try to ruff a @D then draw trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since both majors split 32  i think this makes -- just make sure to win this trick in hand that ensures reentry to dummy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't think it was possible for east to ask for aces and Queen, pls correct me if I am wrong|pg||
nt|penseur9: still looks like two @C and a @S looser|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: @s9 in S wd be better|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: @sQ now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: then E must play @d|pg||
nt|pelu: or even more - she know now the W cant have @sKx |pg||
nt|penseur9: sorry be right back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final match for Germany is 2nd place England|pg||

pc|hA|nt|alunand14: ya, tp tetap lbh berrisiko kalo ga cabut trum :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: made a mistake app with @d K, result now 10 tricks for E/W, but N/S know they had to play!!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: which he's done|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not sure playing 3 rounds of trumps is wise|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a groan from part of the gallery and cheer from the other|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East marked with 5-5-2-1 and odds favour Jack with West|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: now relief|pg||
nt|rhelle: declarer has 5 trump tricks, 3 @c, 1@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: and trying to ruff the 4th @c in dummy seems called for|pg||
nt|rhelle: so now declarer is struggling, and needs to do some good guessing to avoid going down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: you cannot do cue's and asking for trump Q|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, but she wrong:)|pg||
nt|westjava: now, 1 from @C|pg||

pc|sT|nt|cicus: make the screen brighter|pg||
nt|rhelle: this works too, but is riskier - if East had AK98 of @c, it would hand the game back to her|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: and they are all back now.|pg||
nt|rhelle: but a deserved 10 IMPs to Germany, IMHO|pg||
nt|andyv:  N's thinking should have been:  If I have to play @hs, I will have to lead to my King...EW are not here to help me so I should stick to my original plan.|pg||

nt|roswolf: good point glen|pg||

nt|glen: still 3@C is not good with no ruffing value in the S hand|pg||
nt|glen: some of my partnerships would play pass by S here to play 2@SXX|pg||
nt|fluffy: spade lead was good news in theory, but declarer is a bit stuack in her own hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: she makes if she plays for @h 3-3 and @s 4-3 obviously, but is tehre a better chance?|pg||

nt|w_adam: 11 lew|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: the vampires gather for their feast|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: oeps, this can get nasty|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: 4@S??  at which point|pg||
nt|rhelle: A delicate 2NT contract|pg||
nt|tomi2: west worked out partner should be short in @D here|pg||
nt|penseur9: fatigue may be setting in for the Canadian pair since they're only 4 player team|pg||
nt|eweber: 2! was 2way checkback, asking N to bid 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: For the people wondering why England is more in front than the scored imps. There was a cary over of half the imps scored during the Round Robin, so England had 4 imps to start ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  this may be a good save by NS as 4@h can make |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: cross ruff seems an approach to take|pg||
nt|westjava: wow, E fly too high I think|pg||
nt|baldfriede: but again not something that can easily be found, with the two top trump honors missing|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|tomi2: the small @D might be a mistake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DQ says  "i can win next round of @D"   that means   singleton Q or  QJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cicus: immediately over the double|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  proper contract (if only NS hands in consideration), and hardly found @cA lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible to find without clues from the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: another chance now for the defense|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  do NOT play Q from Qx|pg||
nt|garden2005: a mo¿e kropnie gór¹?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: balancing double  =  never jump to game   not to mention hasn't guaranteed 4@S|pg||
nt|cicus: I did not consider passing, but also did not look at the colours|pg||
nt|cicus: you are right, 4 spades were not guaranteed|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'm being corrected, apparently 5 member team|pg||
nt|penseur9: 6 members|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice unblock of @CJ - makes things clear |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: kropnie gór¹ jak mu co na g³owê spadnie|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: Nystrom opened East hand  1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ahmed playing 2@S North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand much easier to play seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|cicus: very true - drawing trumps results in only 8 tricks if @S do not break|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  apparently, N couldn't have singleton @c after 1NT opening|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however this should make- South in big trouble on run of diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|glen: EW have a zillion years of experience and they know there's blood in the water|pg||
nt|glen: hence everything by NS will get X'ed|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is something to be said for bidding 3NT as South|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually I don't think cross ruff is necessary here, because E knows where all the points are|pg||
nt|jaker: nice lead. Too bad for her the 8 and 7 of spades aren't reversed. As it is, suit is blocked|pg||
nt|alunand14: 3 imps for INA ?|pg||
nt|ahalim: some imps for indonesia|pg||

nt|cicus: S was extremely conservative in OR|pg||
nt|alunand14: bad lead from sawiruddin :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: indeed a good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: The dropping of the @DQ will provide declarer with a @C discard.|pg||

pc|s2|nt|rhelle: if the @c run, you may well make 9. If they don't, you may not even make 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this isn't strongest defense    i wonder what 5@H said that prompted @C shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if it offered ruff-sluff  seems @DK was least risky and many ways it could be best|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fluffy: she must cash @dAQ before conceding a heart, else west will play a diamond to endplay her back|pg||
nt|pelu: there are CCs for 3 pairs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  K@c and @c, @h return and 3rd @c to take the maximum no. of tricks|pg||

pc|h2|nt|vugraphzpb: 11 tricks from top with club A gone, 12 with spade finesse|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4 losers in the red suits - defence need to take their @s trick before it goes on @cs|pg||
nt|rhelle: great lead!|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h here depends on 3-2 trump break and successfu @c finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: in my opinion u normal dont need X for penalty - the weak hand can now take out in 5 card minor - I prefer that D = 5 card minor + 4 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: you need it if somebody psyches a 1NT opener|pg||
nt|pelu: and u need to take 800 if u have game|pg||
nt|eweber: this is valid vs wk nt as well|pg||
nt|pelu: against weak NT D = penalty - for sure|pg||
nt|eweber: I play differnt methods with different partners and I can say that I miss the pen X more often then the 4M5m when I play the other sys|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't object to 1@S, 2@S or 3@S in this situation|pg||

nt|roswolf: from north's point of view couldnt south still have a small doubleton club?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@h was Game forcing|pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h will make on any lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: it also might be made if E decides to lead Q of Spades instead of @D Jack|pg||
nt|star6ija: or as Danny Sprung pointed via black squeeze, which on the actual layout doesn't work|pg||
nt|westjava: little bit different bid until now...|pg||

nt|skaftij:  BD 7, Jonsson led a @s. Now a @h shift was required but not found. tough defense|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in 3Nt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Moment of truth in OR, |pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h is slightly better because a @c can be ditched on @s Queen|pg||
nt|skaftij:  OR is 2 boards behind designated time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Interesting deals in this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: very long pause for the outcome, questions asked to N on bidding|pg||
nt|star6ija: some tricky move would be N to play small @c from dummy to put pressure over W if he had the King|pg||
nt|dgame: 6@s cold|pg||
nt|don_kapu: like ice cream|pg||
nt|pelu: lets see here - there are play for 3NT - but hard work - how is 2@hs?|pg||
nt|eweber: Germany place 4 at the moment, CDN 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: small @h now|pg||
nt|pelu: the missed defense in B21+B24 cost Canada 28 IMP!|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only reject  Pass and 4@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: now 11|pg||
nt|fluffy: as long as partner has at least 2 cards in your suit you are better in 2M than 1NT becaus eif he has 3, well you have a fit, if he doesn't, then you probably won't have the entrys ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: to stablish the suit anyway|pg||

pc|c4|nt|skaftij:  celand and China  got penalty for slow play |pg||
nt|andyv:  E up to 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: so 6@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: hard to avoid in this bidding sequence|pg||
nt|jaker: then, if declarer ducks a trump comes through, and if he wins and plays a spade, S can win and cash spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East opened 1@h next door|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzpb: south knows from the lead that west has another diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: so shouldn't go wrong here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but possibility to go wrong still exists for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: north knows west started with 7 hearts|pg||

nt|westjava: Murniati in OR 3 times bid @D|pg||

nt|glen: but south is happy with just one|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: claimed quickly when W had also @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky for West|pg||
nt|cicus: well, I lost 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, I can hardly imagine N's reasoning|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but well done by palmer to give them a chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: south will have shown her diamond count, so north's only chance was to cash @cA|pg||
nt|pelu: E only down 1 in 3@C ??|pg||
nt|jaker: a low club instead of the ace would have been an interesting play|pg||
nt|eweber: you never know :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Sabine Auken also 1NT, but pass from S and now 2@C from von Arnim!? - 2@H pas pas pas|pg||
nt|eweber: predictions are sometimes difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: down 1  so only 10 imps|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Hello all|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Paul!, wlc!|pg||
nt|alunand14: hi Paul :)|pg||
nt|vbman: ----------------27-------------------|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: mam te¿ uwagê, ¿e prawdopodobnie w pokoju otwartym le zapisano wynik...albo le zapisywano poszczególne lewy bo zamiast -1 powinno byæ +1|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lontoh 63: hi|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: normal 4@s    one down I bet on apush|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1@H max of 15 HCP|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  may be, N hoped for @s trick if W were 3-7-2-1?|pg||
nt|penseur9: always difficult :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: TY all  :)|pg||
nt|lokaty: s³yszê od NAtalki, ¿e znowu inwektywy po polsku lec¹:)|pg||
nt|garden2005: Apek nie wypuci ju¿ przed 5@c|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cicus: but you saw that Mohiudd bid it first :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=good raise of @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  most likely 3N will be final contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: half time now|pg||
nt|star6ija: even at this high level (World Championship) W may not duck, having doubleton King|pg||
mb|4S|nt|glen: never accept the trojan club|pg||
nt|rhelle: that is a red-blooded 2@c overcall|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may invite slam|pg||
nt|odysseus69: grand here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hand too strong for Precision 2@C  so  multi-purpose 1@C|pg||
nt|vbman: double , ok|pg||
nt|kamyk: Wspólny Jêzyk?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: after bd 25 25-11 to India|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with passive defense (@h lead) it will go down|pg||
nt|eweber: as far as I know 2@c asked for 4card @h in their sys|pg||
mb|p|nt|alunand14: small slam from N|pg||
nt|rhelle: after this sequence, North can envisage @c shortage in her partner's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S had a re-double in her hand and then decided for 4@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: still, 4@h is a bit lazy, with this fine-looking hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@c is normally invitational or better - so it sets @h as trump suit|pg||
nt|rhelle: which means XX to show 1st round control looks perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: what would 3@S by S have meant??|pg||
nt|rhelle: we can see that 6@s is perhaps a superior contract|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@h alerted, probably weak, nice treatment when you ahppen to hold that hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good bid by South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play 2@C = 10-14 HCP|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: not easy to find 4 @H here|pg||
nt|lesio: jeszcze moze byc zysk z tych 800:)|pg||
mb|6C|nt|vugraphzpb: but then cashing @cA also isn't wrong, the 3rd spade will go on the @dJ|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@s is natural, I'd think|pg||
nt|star6ija: also with C Jack or with @D JAck|pg||
nt|eweber: so pd will never bid 2@s and this is a chance to escape|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6D?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: more or less on J of @s right|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: spór kiery na piki - czyli nikt nie wie ile komu idzie|pg||
nt|w_adam: Lesio narzeka³e, ¿e ring bokserski - a tu remisik za remisikiem|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: but I don't think South is strong enough for that|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1Nt is  15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW takeout doubles focus on majors, so minor suit distribution often non-traditional|pg||
nt|mrt2000: a comfortable 4@H for NS here|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobrze, ¿e nie lataj¹ talerze:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H was not invitational|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Japan heading for 4@s in OR on bd 9, East opened|pg||
nt|star6ija: Danny Sprung clearified this openning of 1 @d...always unbalanced with 5+@d or 4441|pg||
nt|fluffy: pasman scared of the 4 levl since she doesn't like the sapde void, will simons show upport at 4 level?|pg||
nt|pelu: very clever :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: good stop|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: 3@D - 3BA?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: nopes, and stansby steals their 11 card fit with the preempt, preempts work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C promises 15+ HCP  [otherwise open 2@C]|pg||
nt|mrt2000: well bid b|pg||
nt|mrt2000: by N|pg||
nt|westjava: she found it|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: got it|pg||
nt|vbman: 4sp plus one looks affirmative to me|pg||
nt|lesio: zosta³o jeszcze pare rund|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: faktycznie - ale te remisy s¹ nie takie ja³owe...wszêdzie jak w tañcu na linie|pg||
pc|sA|nt|glen: a 9 count 2/1 in the open room got EW to 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: I am wondering if they can stop here|pg||
nt|dgame: should be playing carefully|pg||
nt|pelu: not after this lead :) - 13 tricks :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: trudne rozdanie w ramach WJ|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na karym koniu gdzie pêdzisz kozacze?|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Grzesiu mam propozycjê nazwy Twojego wynalazku...robocza nazwa jest za trudna|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|alunand14: X of hartono already make slam missing from S|pg||
nt|rhelle: great 5@d bid from North|pg||
nt|rhelle: save her partner's ass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: expl. of 4@d was not correct apparently|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 or 4 @sin similar situation B croneir bid 4|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Cronier sorry|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzpb: 11-25 (bra-ind) now|pg||
nt|star6ija: ah...4@d is may be Blackwood (Gene Saxe's statement)|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR Sweden has found the @S-fit as NS (:()|pg||
nt|pelu: playing 4@SD|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very tame bidding by Canada in open room|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 11 tricks available for @C played to best advantage|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if, not for!|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: may lose 2 @C and 1 @H just enough|pg||
nt|vbman: this will a hard hill to climb|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: same contract other room, but EW never in the auction after  1@H-1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: unlucky call by S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: this more like a pairs auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W is not happy with delayed 3@h bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is called again!!|pg||
nt|glen: the thing is N had nothing to think about over 3@D|pg||
nt|fluffy: she might make the contract is she guesses @cJ and trumps|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: simons playing @hK intuitively but its a small mistake, when aprtner leads trumps she might have @hKxx but she won't lead trumps from @hQxx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much play for this|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jedyna utopijna szansa to zagraæ karo do 10-ki - W nie pod³ozy przecie¿ figury|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 4 impy w plery:(:(|pg||
nt|garden2005: podzia³ trefli jest, zabrak³o podzia³u kar|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zagra na podzia³ kar 4-2 a to nie udaje siê niestety|pg||
nt|garden2005: 4-3|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jednak wszyscy (oprócz mnie) mieli dobrych matematyków w szkole:) 4-3 oczywizda|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie chcial te¿ mieæ zadziorów karowych E, bo wtedy mo¿na by³o go przymusiæ po takiej obronie|pg||

nt|garden2005: a przecie¿ tyle ciekawych historii bryd¿owych znamy  :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|glen: 2@H had some risk in a potential misfit auction, there was no way N was bidding again|pg||
nt|roswolf: with screens hesitations are less likely to cause adjustments|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it is about thinking of N and thereafter bidding of S of 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is present bud bidding is not ended....|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @d play will probably be the issue here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10 is losest card that is led with doubleton   i.e. 9x leads x|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: 5@H bez dwóch... Teraz: czêciowe odatutowanie...|pg||
nt|garden2005: wal mia³o i na roboczo|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cicus: I can't see the purpose of 1@S response|pg||
nt|alunand14: 11 imp's for indonesia and draw now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: the brazilians here are rattled i think|pg||
nt|glen: but N had nothing to think about|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W raises his hands on pass of S after 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is a wild shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: pass cards of W are not in sequential order on the tray, TD is now called by N|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as south  - west has lost his cool|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: again fireworks?|pg||
nt|glen: sometimes you need to "calm the fuss down" to think clearly, but the fireworks can be distracting|pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand is all about the @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they are discussing pauses of W, N and E now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: during the bidding|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|star6ija: at least 2 IMPs US thanking to the rifhtsided contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sarniak playing 4@SX West|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ano o tym myla³em|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: there is also a lontg way to go in this tournament|pg||
nt|glen: S thinks "maybe I should have paused too, not be left out"|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wonder if east will consider cashing out for -1!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the pass after 2@s is the issue|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c switch seems likely|pg||
nt|tomi2: France avoided the slam missing the ace and @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: so 10 imps were kind of randomly given to Germany depending on the position of the @HQ|pg||
nt|dgame: calculate the posibility 4-1 Break og @h|pg||
nt|dgame: of|pg||
nt|dgame: no sugar :(|pg||
nt|vbman: 11 for usa|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|vugraphzpb: this does not seem to be well played|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: INFIT G|pg||

nt|garden2005: ja uwielbia³em za m³odu s³uchaæ opowieci Macieszczaka, sk¹d siê bior¹ teraz tacy powa¿ni userzy?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson needs to play on @d now....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: asking about leads and signals now by E|pg||
nt|garden2005: :) IF wystarczy|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: G musi byæ!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: many play  East 2@S would be natural, but maybe needs 6th @S or better hand|pg||
nt|eweber: and vs 6 South might double to avoid the @d lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, you never know - a small heart to the nine might work |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that that's a practical thing to do|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|garden2005: G to maj¹ seniorki :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and now Auken endplayed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless she plays @S  then will be endplayed again later|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the margin goes back to 3  only for France|pg||
nt|garden2005: mogê opowiedzieæ jak Laska rozgrywa³ turniej na Korsyce i zapytali go o znaczenie licytacji :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wiedzia³??|pg||
nt|garden2005: - Za nic nie chcia³ powiedzieæ co oznacza sekwencja|pg||
nt|garden2005: wiedzia³ ale siie upar³|pg||
nt|garden2005: trafil jednak na mafioso, który go o to zapyta³|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzpb: i don't see how she can make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and the scorer of the usa has fallen asleep again....|pg||
pc|d2|nt|skaftij:  Does he have a hunch about the @s position?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N is looking sad now|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Nie wyszed³ w @D - da³ nadróbkê|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: 1@S response wouldn't occur to me either -- unless playing Kaplan Inversion where 1@S=forcing NT equivalent|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if she can be endplayed 5 times -- that is good for defense against 3 level contract|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|glen: at 50 for the extra down trick, he will take the @C finesse|pg||
mc|11|nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||

mb|1D|nt|skaftij:  10-12|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS headint to 4@h, the vul may tempt W to sac in 5@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  heading|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: difficult hand or North|pg||
nt|vbman: u cant beat champions by giving consequitive presents|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that north hand isn't worth anywhere near the 10 HCP Walter the Walrus would claim|pg||
nt|dgame: 2@s?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d probably a relay here - some pairs use 2NTas a puppet to 3@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sfoxa:  the lay of the cards isn't very pleased for EW (rather playing partscore in @s)|pg||
nt|ahalim: however N cd have @HQ singleton or @H cd be 2-2|pg||
nt|dgame: choose a minor|pg||
nt|dgame: 5@c cold then|pg||
nt|fluffy: yet another balanced hand opening|pg||
nt|fluffy: Migry biddig 2@s wich I suspect is a transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|eweber: well, some pairs might reach 6 by jumping in somehow|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H down 1 - card by card same play as here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: risks 3@D from partner|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s X pass 2@c 2@s ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well 6@D OBJECTIVELY is good once east overcalls|pg||
nt|roswolf: i suspect n/s might bid this|pg||
nt|fluffy: asking partner if she is maximum or minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wondeer if Sawicka has bid to show @C & @D|pg||
nt|ahalim: 4@H goes down losing 2@S, !@H and 1@D|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: but @H -1|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: does not look as a favorable score for French ladies but the hand is shaky let us see|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: french pair never bid @s  in OR!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@H might have been a transfer with S, not sure though? or only showing @D?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Kontra tu - to lekki fit w Kierach - oraz cosik w pozosta³ych kolorach|pg||
mb|2S|nt|glen: don't you need to play @S K83 opposite @S J72 for one loser?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: that's a little over 50%, so kind of random swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, both neither make|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to - jak siê okazê - 10+PC z fitem ...je³i siê da okazaæ|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: correct point|pg||

nt|fluffy: she won't show clubs with 5332|pg||
nt|odysseus69: end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe she'll balance with 5@C|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: south on  2@d cue bidded @h|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: yes it might not make!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: tough decision by S|pg||
nt|dgame: cue short in @s|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@c is maximum hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she is thinking about it|pg||
nt|vbman: l guess 4h will be bid|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a second double|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: and 3NT sets teh contract|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very aggressive double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough call at these colors|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: in the end decides against it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: better to have a bid over 2@S that shows 2 suits|pg||
nt|vbman: winning first dia from n with ace is vastly important|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: 5@D = hand so bad I will remove room to bid blackwood|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: S whispered: "minors"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  DBL or 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: in that case they never showed spades:)|pg||
nt|ritong: now north under the spotlights|pg||
nt|ritong: might emerge with 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed glen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction will NOT be duplicated since  Nystrom's 1/2/3 seat favorable 1N=10-12|pg||
nt|andyv:  the QJ@d made N put on the brakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  in this auction, the lead should be read as a singleton...W would otherwise lead a top @d|pg||

nt|mdgraham: hmm  the diamond stopper appears a bit diaphanous  |pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  but defence isn't a pleasant walk, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: palmer not enquiring about the 1NT range here|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt hard work, but on @H-lead S can make 4@S (DD: @HQ + 3x@S from top)|pg||

nt|fluffy: back to pasman who can bid pass or 4@s|pg||
nt|fluffy: and she goes quietly since she is balanced|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is a good general rule when responding to take out doubles at high level, pass if you are balanced|pg||
nt|fluffy: here sadly, one or partner's aces isn't cashing, and @sQ is useless, and 4@c will make in comfort|pg||

nt|mdgraham: but we can surmise that it doesn;t include penalty doubles of strong NT's (assuming that was a strong NT) |pg||
nt|dgame: 2@c for nine minors|pg||

nt|star6ija: push board|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: next board is played in wrong direction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: so only the result|pg||
nt|fluffy: obviously pass would had worked much better if partner had 20 count 4432 or alike|pg||
nt|pelu: No - we need him as operator - help :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: thx guys :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg:  great!|pg||
nt|alunand14: at 3rd rnd @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Declarer can couter every move|pg||
nt|skaftij:  counter|pg||
nt|fluffy: but he catched him with the opposite hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: her|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: for a second  Nystrom was in 4@HX East!!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks the spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: unbelievable, now the scorer and dias are taking a short nap|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: short  breaks|pg||
nt|pelu: and girl? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N ostensibly 15-17|pg||
nt|alnanda: good job East, not play K@s, make declerer guess again @s position :) congrat Sokolow|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: 2 more bds after this|pg||
nt|cicus: oh my !|pg||
nt|hedyg:  light overcalls on 1 level accepted everywhere now|pg||
nt|andreasw:  after picking up 6-5 on last hand north now picked up a 6-4:)) lovely cards to hold|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I apologize|pg||
nt|odysseus69: surpring pass by North|pg||
nt|mrt2000: makes the contract  :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ostre ale skuteczna 6@h zagrali nasi, ciekawe czy Francuzi im dorownaj¹?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andreasw:  n-s might end up in slam if S bids 4@s now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pass?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have heard a rumour that England have dumped Germany out of the top eight|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: That is no rumour|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: And we are back in the top 8:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  the light overcall will steer NS away from the @h suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may well bid 2N here|pg||
nt|pelu: Back again - serius tecnical problems - every 15 min a have lost connection to Internet :(:(:(|pg||

mb|p|nt|skaftij:  East intended to show 1819 bal - W is using transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: leaving N/S from @h or @c contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: What about a beer Elke?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: changed now - 3NT not much fun nor even 2NT -multi still creates discomfort|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this seems doomed|pg||
nt|dgame: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@CX is better but still 5 top losers vulnerable will be 800 against nothing|pg||
nt|cicus: did it end there?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the question is whether she feels she has enough to try for 3N.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  2@c was negative freebid, nf|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they alerted 2@c because it was not-forcing|pg||
nt|eweber: np|pg||
nt|pelu: no coffee for her and wine for us :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a convention from medieval times, Ripstra  used 2@C/@D to show majors + better minor|pg||
nt|garden2005: i liny|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: short breaks of sleeping|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither wants to choose a major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: did well to make 12 tricks next door|pg||
nt|vbman: l mean they are getting tired|pg||
nt|ritong: usually, raising a reopening requests some distributional good news|pg||
nt|ritong: but, here, balancing can come from a wide range of hands, and also NS have to find imps somewhere|pg||
nt|garden2005: wiele par gra tak, ze po silnym przyjêcium 3@h licytuje siê do szlemika forsujace 3NT bez krókosci, a zalicytowanie koloru to krótkosæ bez wzglêdu na cue bidy w kolorze ominietym, ...|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: 3 karo to pytanie o uzupe³nienie w tym kolorzez, Laska nie ma, ale 10-ka okazuje siê byæ na wagê honoru|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  If S had bid 2N, N would have an easy 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg:  yes ty|pg||
nt|eweber: you deserve a beer for your job :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: no, they did not, meaning france will expand their lead|pg||
nt|lokaty: najwa¿niejsze, ¿e powinienen sobie poradziæ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cicus: odd that N did not X this - can it be that would als have been T/O?|pg||
nt|rhelle: go, Pony, you never find KJ9x behind you|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: easy 9 tricks, 2@S 2@H 3@C and 2@D|pg||
nt|ritong: hoping their mates will have a rocket sheet|pg||
nt|mpeti:  JuÅ¼ siÄ baÅem, Å¼e Jacek zawalczy...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|star6ija: with no trump lead now the cross ruff is open|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: but even played by west is likely to go down|pg||
nt|fluffy: everybody making very reasonable decisions so far|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sawicka REALLY happy about her decision not to open 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction screams     lead trump then look at the rest of your hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: this seems doomed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky N found @dA by partner, not the @cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  E's 1N bid may actually have helped NS|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  good lead to knock out an entry into the N hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they have time trouble 3boards in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|jaker: in the other room, west passed the 2d opening, and NS got to a very reasonable 4h contract, which i guess failed on a club ruff|pg||
nt|mrt2000: this will be ugly ............|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 11 dla naszych|pg||
pc|h5|nt|glen: now can develop @C suit for @D discard|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson could bid 3@D = 18-19 with 4 card support in @H, wonder why he shunned that|pg||
nt|w_adam: albo 10 jak as karo nie wemie|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe she couldn't hear screams because of screens|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although that is not the final score, still some boards left apparently|pg||
nt|mrt2000: could go up to 5 off!|pg||
nt|mrt2000: but 3 more likely|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  it's a 10-imps gain for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 11 even|pg||
nt|rhelle: I daresay that there is a case for South competing with 2@s after the 2@c bid|pg||
nt|w_adam: 11 :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzpb: he asked how much time was left; maybe he was in a hurry :-)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  :-)|pg||
nt|hedyg:  good @d switch|pg||
nt|andreasw:  kib ask why W did not open 3@h insted of 2@h?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|alunand14: 6 imp's again for indonesia|pg||
nt|ritong: so, they move|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rhelle: but it all worked out in the end|pg||
nt|eweber: was I the one who needed a coffee? ;-) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt any EW pair could confidently find @C fit here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: You have to know that we are in a separate room, just the 4 players and me (BBO operator) so she should be able to hear any screams|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: diferent road but same play by w and same result lookslike|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Jakies nudne te rozdania. Pora ma Mw w Gulasza|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ryskiel_: akurat id¹ ma³o dynamiczne rozdania - mo¿e poza tym 4@h z kontr¹ (zaledwie 2 impy zysku, bo tam nie skontrowano)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ja te¿, bo móg³ zadzia³¹æ syndrom odwetowy za poprzednie rozdanie gdzie spasi³ z 18-kê|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: but on that lead should make|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: very good switch to @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this was not a good decision by E|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2 even|pg||
nt|odysseus69: just needed 10x club with East|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: @S765 nothing to brag about -- no defense if EW run  ...  take the non-vul plus seems right|pg||
nt|eweber: I will take a wine as well|pg||
nt|pelu: why lead a singleton here - partner is favorit to no entries|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Heineken is mjamm|pg||
nt|vbman: cl is not good|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|glen: could lose @S, @C, @H only|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|vugraphzpb: making again a new playing plan?|pg||
nt|ritong: ho hum.|pg||
nt|star6ija: at least he had to unblock the 10 of @H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|glen: N can test declarer with @H|pg||
nt|vbman: lost 1 trick|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
mc|11|nt|roswolf: should only lose etc:)|pg||
nt|hedyg:  however ..|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west saves time by pitching club|pg||
nt|odysseus69: claim 1 down now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the 7@S was a penaltycard|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: chwila przerwy|pg||

nt|lontoh 63: jauh amat selisih imps nya ..... hmmmmmm|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@DX is huge result    other tables also preempting 4@D but NS finding 4@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  another excellent result for Italy...the 1@h overcall may have helped them|pg||

nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 4@D 5@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: fearless double facing a passed partner at red|pg||
nt|ritong: same length, 6x16|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: perhaps not 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: sry, typo|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and one more board for lucky bidders|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks like 10 tricks in @c for NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: how high will S bid?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: tame board here |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 2@d - 7-9 z fitem kier|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|fluffy: yet another all balanced hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 8 tricks - next please|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm told Lauria made 5@H   seems everyone else treating west as 1-suiter|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: double game swing for France here|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3NT, or 6@d for NS - depending on @d finess that works|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and @s finess as well|pg||
nt|penseur9: is slam E/W biddable here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south resisting temptation|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S indeed thinking about 3nt......|pg||
nt|glen: S pausing for effect|pg||
nt|hedyg:  3 card bergen raise..i believe only in France|pg||
nt|alnanda: still 4 segment @@ 16 board..anything can happen|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahalim: frankly speaking : i don't like these bergen type raises with only 3-crd support|pg||
nt|pelu: 32 HCP but no fit but 6NT on - either @Ss 3-3 or @CK in S|pg||
nt|eweber: if West plays|pg||
nt|penseur9: how about 6@H?|pg||
nt|eweber: from E on a @c lead it is worse|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: he resisted|pg||
nt|ritong: south had a tough problem to solve other table|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: sorry now i'm told both tables in Italy v Iceland played 5@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is something to be said for a 1NT overcall in North|pg||
nt|tomi2: this was not a bergen raise, it was simply an invitational raise with support|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N unintentionally moved the tray, before E had bid; they are making a joke about this also|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and promptly E bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: dont know if double showing some points, but some imps back to France here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good time to play transfer leads|pg||
nt|cicus: bd 13 - lucky for Sweden that both pairs had their disaster on the same board - 16 IMP|pg||
nt|ritong: here, cronier did not create it  good decision|pg||
nt|andreasw:  im guessing one of the reasons would be his hand distrabution.. while 3@h would be weaker then 10-13 and can also hold 6@h aswell he wanted to show he "had something" |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: good lead|pg||
nt|pelu: the 2@H from W was contructiv: 10-13|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S should not take the first @c trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hopefully Paul can find out what 1N shows|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here's my guess   1N=@C  for suit or lead direct with @S fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that fits Daniela's 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I think it is a transfer to 2@C with possibly some kind of @S raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can't "blame" South for bidding 4@h - she was probably expecting a bit more from North |pg||
nt|lontoh 63: ada yang bilang kasih voor kata .... hahahahahaha|pg||
nt|alunand14: aggreed.........arif :)|pg||
nt|vbman: easily bid|pg||

nt|antoniz: 4NT jak chce pokazaæ nadwy¿kê,naturalny inwit|pg||
mb|4N|nt|fluffy: this lead sometimes causes problems for the defence|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'm being told that many tables in six |pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess too Paul, danke|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: bez jednej czy bez dwóch - that is a question?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  the sweedish team only stood in 3@s on board 29 making 10 tricks so now bulgarya is in the lead with 3 boards to go|pg||
nt|pelu: East has prob now shown Gf+ values|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: after 1@h-2@h it gets tricky - East might have bid on 2 points|pg||
nt|penseur9: doesn't mean they all make :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this should go down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i have friend who would berate partner/teammates if they led from Jack -- even when it was right|pg||
nt|tomi2: their aim was not to preempt opps out of the auction, they would probably not do this with 7hcp only|pg||
nt|tomi2: they wanted to investigate the 4@S game|pg||
nt|ahalim: i said bergen type raises not bergen raises :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: if @sQ might show @sKQxx or @sQJx east doens't know if she should appeal or not|pg||

pc|s9|nt|rhelle: or 9, maybe a bad 10|pg||
nt|rhelle: this could be another partscore swing - 2@h vs 2@s|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D GF and then only 2NT (stronger than 3NT) - why are West not slamgoing?|pg||
nt|garden2005: a potem przymus kierowo-treflowo na rêkê W|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|andreasw:  very close match!|pg||
nt|jaker: interesting result from USA senior 1 on board 6 where NS relayed but stopped in 5d. 6d was made on a heart lead when W pitched a spade and declarer guessed to discard a heart on ...|pg||
nt|jaker: the third spade from dummy, thus endplayed east to give a ruff sluff to get rid to the last  heart. that was nicely done|pg||
nt|fluffy: again stansby finds the best play, she has played extremlly well all this match|pg||
nt|penseur9: good question|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I was overthinking bd 24. S should have ducked the first @d, then defence is chanceless|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: specs here missed a cool defense on  29|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: all that leads to ... should declarer duck at trick 1?|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry|pg||
nt|hedyg:  they surely have other bids for 7 hcps support, 3@c and 3@d bergen raises are not preemptive either, only 3M is|pg||

pc|s9|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzpb: probably expecting that bessis bid 2@s if she wanted to know 3-card support|pg||
nt|hedyg:  if she throws E in now there is an endplay to make the contract|pg||
nt|hedyg:  but no way she can see that|pg||
nt|hedyg:  i think 2@d followed by 3NT surely shows 5@ss|pg||
nt|hedyg:  else she could have bid 3NT directly|pg||
nt|tomi2: what else can she now play for? a revoke?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  how can she know that @cs are blocked?|pg||
nt|tomi2: she can hope for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but no defender will have bared the @sK|pg||
