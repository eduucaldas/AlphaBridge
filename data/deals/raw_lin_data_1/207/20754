nt|vugraphznv: I will enter the bids 2 and 2 |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so that the players have no chance to know who might be fast or slow at the other side of the screen|pg||

mb|p|an| |nt|lechcold: wa¿ny mecz z konkurentem do awansu i medalu(?)|pg||
nt|xenya: but he opted for a natural bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what about a good practical bid|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D shows one of the major suits|pg||
nt|ady: Nortj will be very surprised its spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt=Lebensohl|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT with stiff king not usual|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Herbsts play Nat, Acol based, Major 5, better minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@C natural but may be a two card suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Traian.|pg||
nt|bobholl: they won't bid 3nt anymore i guess :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kamyk: dzieñ dobry (jeli to "polski pokój")|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: dzien dobry|pg||
nt|antoniz: witam serdecznie:)|pg||
nt|antoniz: polski|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sweden has switched back to its Big Club pair|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: hi all - and wlc to Veldhoven|pg||
nt|lechcold: witam|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Victor|pg||
nt|lml: hello|pg||
nt|lml: this auction is following the same lines as in the Open Room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it is Stansby taking a pause here|pg||
nt|lml: the trick will be the opening lead against a 6 level contract by north south|pg||
nt|panosk: gd morning to all|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT  leb   3@D direct would be forcing to game I would think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We have some huge technical problems with the PC and internet connections here in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: SORRY for that|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We are getting some technical assistance- and will try to be back very soon |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we know you are doing all you can Jan, no worries|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And the bidding on Board 18 in this room went |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@h opening from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@h (preempt)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass fromN|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pass from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: then N bid 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: going down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he took the pass card out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fallenius may cue bid 4@S|pg||
nt|hlortz: both sides can make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: a relatively peaceful hand, for starters?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  EW CC: http://tinyurl.com/66ttlf5|pg||
nt|szalay: wd u reopen as West?|pg||
nt|barnets: playing 3N in open|pg||
nt|kit: Pachtman knows his partner is short in hearts.  What he doesn't know about is the club fit.  But he can see 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South in the tank|pg||
nt|barnets: same bidding in open south passed|pg||
nt|kit: if South finds a 4@C call, North can reasonably bid the slam.|pg||
nt|kit: But bidding 4@C is a pretty big position I think.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and likely pass here too. S has no bid for that matter.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is still thinking|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can't NS make 6@C?|pg||
nt|kit: of course they can|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: i might have overcalled 1nt as east|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: Bulgaria bid 6@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Round 10 and Israel are performing well while Bulgaria are lower in the table than their recent form|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the dreaded xxx opposite xxx as stopper- 3H from West should show values|pg||
nt|xenya: this may well make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|desinka: hello Panos:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@C GF relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: apart from the hcp he has an empty hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south with both majors(though weak) is strangely silent|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|ady: it appears the contract n/s is 6@S    not all bid in 1 go|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: dzien dobry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Then ???  3NT - Pass???|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: @sA in hand|pg||
nt|xenya: which is likely|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR they led the @SA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and N still dont know what majorsuit S has|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he passed slowly :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lml: its fun to watch my friends play from Canada play the talented Israeli pair|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and why not?|pg||
nt|lml: do you think Stansby should double for a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|lml: is it possible to figure this out?|pg||
nt|ady: north must still think hearts south suit|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps he should get a small bonus for thinking :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol true|pg||
nt|roswolf: t/o dbl of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: ze Szwecj¹ nigdy nie by³o ³atwo i czêciej oni nas lali ni¿ my ich...zobaczymy|pg||
nt|lechcold: witamy naszego vugrafa:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Barel chose the natural option|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is not so clear as a cue bid, not sure the intent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IMPs for Netherlands from carryover of head-to-head match in Round Robin|pg||
nt|gracelin: China is behind by 37 imps but there are 48 boards to go.  So all is not finished yet.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ryskiel_: witam w kolejnym dzisiejszym meczu, ostatnim|pg||
nt|ady: 4@D down 1 on best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Bulgaria at the moment in 9th |pg||
nt|ady: must set up 2 heart tricks before clubs are established|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so they would need some VPs to get in the top 8|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: "You often have singletons opening 1nt?" asks S|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziñ dobry - witam w przedostatniej rundzie RR - dru¿yna polska spotyka siê z reprezentacj¹ Islandii|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't north know it was natural ?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: theoretically this should go one down, 1 heart, 1 spade and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now doomed for 1 down in 5D|pg||
nt|hlortz: pass or correct type bid perhaps with 5@D in reserve if needed|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Traian|pg||
nt|hedyg:  NS CC: http://tinyurl.com/67anzfx|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 2@S is likely move now|pg||
nt|hantveit:  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: 3@C a better spot for NS.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South is still a junior, don't know his age exactly|pg||
nt|panosk: gm Dessy|pg||
nt|panosk: gm Pim|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: gm|pg||
nt|oosmanb: losing 1@H and 2@C should be very quick for sementa|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: action to start with :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   one window per table|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that was aggressive|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West: i should have passed 2@h when he puts dummy down|pg||
nt|jbgood: so that explains the double:)|pg||
nt|panosk: it was easy that will make it easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3nt could have been a bit difficult to defend against, might need to overtake @C Q and lead a @S through|pg||
nt|olegario: not much can be done, they have gone a bit too high up|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Olegario...welcome|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now the defense is easy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hi olegario :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: both sides have great fits   but both limited to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Never says W and laughs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: E agrees // we newer has .. did I have one :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphznv: declarer claiming 12 tricks -- but Versace rejects - only 11 tricks he says|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@C shows 5+ @H , 10+|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they have screamed for club lead so no chance of anything else|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, seem like a flat board to me|pg||
nt|olegario: Hello skaftij :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like a crazy double to me, getting a diamond ruff wont set 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant on its own, he does not know about partners spade ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: K@C out diamond switch and spade ace and again diamond|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: Lindop has to rise on a spade to the jack now|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS's system card: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Australia/edgtton-gosney.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a kib tells me he is only 19|pg||
nt|desinka: seems|pg||
nt|hlortz: i woud have thought south would bid 5@C 2 way bid make or cheap save|pg||
nt|hlortz: best lead!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my point was fredin does not even know one club is cashing|pg||
nt|hlortz: very true|pg||
nt|hlortz: takes @H ruffs to beat 5@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: lead should sign post the correct line|pg||
nt|gracelin: surprised that Madala is not bidding at all with 5-4 major and 6 pts.  NS seems to be making 2S|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed patrick but need some imps back early i feel|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe too much wine last night!?|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure, Geoffrey, a most difficlt task, but not hopeless.|pg||
nt|roswolf: so much of this game is momentum thus giving you a feel good factor|pg||
nt|gracelin: however, with clubs not breaking, EW can't make even 1NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I saw him in the bar last night, but he wasn't drinking alcohol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = NF   2@C=a) 10-13, (3)4+@C  b) 14-15, not 55|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4@c showed that N has a 3-5-5-0 hand and minimum|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N has described a weak 5530|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as with Round Robin,  all matches in all events playing the same boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2@H = 5@S 4@H  14-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Dennis already entered those explanations|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gracelin: is Madala still below 18?|pg||
nt|hantveit: Hi bob|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lechcold: M-J graj¹ silnym treflem przed parti¹, WJ po partii|pg||
nt|lechcold: bêdzie trudno wybroniæ siê mniej ni¿ bez 3|pg||

nt|jbgood: the EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Sweden/fredin-fallenius.pdf|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h was 8-11, that is why S dared to double 2@s|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Baldursson playing quietly in 1NT so first blood to Iceland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Quarter Final & Semi Final matches  96 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: all going swimmingly|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah team discipline is good then maybe just drinking the npc's brand of coffee|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: USA 2 ogra³o W³ochów...jak poradzi sobie z nimi nasza dru¿yna?|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he has 8 tricks and very hard to find the 9th lol|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lechcold: na drugim stole Buras-Narkiewicz vs Hurd-Wooldridge|pg||
nt|ady: defence got of to good start  so down 1|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: maybe not ... I guess he will still come to 2 diamond tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kiwibridge: Brink presses on|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ady: good save against 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: N's decision to play 3N rather than 4@S with a 4-3-3-3 shape is understandable but quite unlucky|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Markku|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi vladimit|pg||
nt|xenya: note that 4@S makes despite a possible @D ruff|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: director here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i will explain everything at the end of the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director in the room with us|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: a nice start to the match with a grand slam :)|pg||

pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: we could be in for a heady ride Jan :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jorgensen playing 3@D North|pg||
nt|xenya: also a likely make, so this seems a partscore swing for Iceland|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  As Hedy posted earlier. http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ is the link for video|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was non-force, so Drijver 2@D either 4+ or extra values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surpised Brink didn't bid 3@D|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: hi Ruud and yes indeed Iceland have also bid grand|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can you go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Ruud|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not as they lie, but you could have on Qxx trumps offside|pg||
nt|boedhy:  you cannt draw trumps i think|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah iceland went down after two times trump|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and Iceland went down 1 in the closed room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll back Drijver to make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Brink has just given his partner a glass of water |pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: i wonder how it was made|pg||

nt|barnets: trump lead will beat this |pg||
nt|kit: key which suit Levin leads.  If he leads a club, I don't think 3@H will make.  If he leads a diamond, it will make.|pg||

pc|h5|nt|xenya: but this, i'm almost certain, won't make|pg||

nt|skaftij:  his match is a great opportunity for iceland: if they win it, they will be relaxed tomorrow, because ranks 7-8 will be fairly far away, not chapping at their heels|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 19 is not correct as well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes, also 19 incorrect|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i will stop for the moment... i will ask what is happening|pg||
nt|skaftij:  S: @sKJ73 @H 108743 @dA @c J104|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: we are back|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Ah that's better!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i will claim at the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they are playing brd 19 now|pg||
nt|hlortz: oops 5 down lose 3|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wtedy w reprezentacji Polski grali Balicki-¯mudziñski, Martens - Szymanowski i Klukowaki - Moszczyñski|pg||
nt|xenya: a somewhat off-shape (and off-strength?) 2N opening...|pg||
nt|xenya: led to a boring 3N -- perhaps for the best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller won't play the hand nearly that quickly|pg||
nt|gracelin: didn't north ruff the 3rd D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would expect the chinese to push here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Could not see, to fast, but they made 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i don't know about what board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2 imps to china on bd 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: and with a diamond fit you may keep the opponents out of the bidding ... as here|pg||
nt|lechcold: witamy m³odzie¿|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tylko wszed³ i od razu poprawia...trzeba by³ow poprzednim meczu poprawiaæ Tatê:)|pg||
nt|alnanda: test|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  will be reached by n/s|pg||
nt|ady: e/w do well to play 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: David Lindop is thinking how many spades|pg||
nt|desinka: hi David|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assume DBL=4+@S  but some pairs   specify 4/5|pg||
nt|roswolf: south shows where the hcp are|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tricky hand for East - we can see that 3NT is ok, but East can't|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H 44 so 3nt makes |pg||
mb|1N|nt|desinka: and Al|pg||
nt|ady: best spot appears to be 4@S n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N debating between stayman or transfer. Stayman better imo.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h down on the trump break - but N will save if they bid it?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  a very good lead from Brink played this game down with any other lead it will be close|pg||
nt|ady: I would think 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice splinter|pg||
nt|gracelin: the opening makes it less appealling for EW to bid a slam.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: so just 2 imps on 2 wildish hands|pg||
nt|ady: typical Sementa opening in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: picture West with Jxx in spades for example|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has a pretty obvious 4@S bid, i would have said|pg||
nt|lml: we have 10 spades ... we belong at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dessy|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the best bulgarian pair recently...for more than 20 years they are almost non-stop part of the Bulgarian National Team in the top international forums|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Desita :)|pg||
nt|desinka: the best one.. but lets see the contract..|pg||
nt|desinka: Hey, Momchil@h|pg||
nt|lechcold: skok Martensa bezkompromisowy, ale mo¿e wepchn¹æ EW w szlemika, którego po³o¿enie wymaga..sami widzicie czego:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but splinter will help Brink declare|pg||
nt|roswolf: light but shapely opening - yes e/w will do well to score game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4-fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room in 4@S|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, and 5c, but 3nt more likely|pg||
nt|hantveit: shoul make 4s too|pg||
nt|hantveit: should|pg||
nt|bobholl: threy made it indeed|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3h=single H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 4@H is not making but in this vul it is hard for N to let it go|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for both teams still alot at stake|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make 5 here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am assuming he wont risk heart ruff by playing for club ruff|pg||
nt|gracelin: Leaving to their own, 6C is a reasonable contract.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but of course, not making here.|pg||
nt|roswolf: true and making 12 tricks might be iffy|pg||
nt|gracelin: this shud be easy enough and probably 11 tricks|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphznv: Versace claims 12 tricks after the lead -- they are playing quick here |pg||
nt|boedhy:  Brasil strugling to get to the first 8|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South will correct to 2@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@D not so bad (last hand) but may be a bit tricky due to 4-1 @D|pg||
nt|runnerup: this secvense helps to let 4 @h -make easyly -south has all cards -also 3nt|pg||
nt|xenya: tempting for N to go on|pg||
nt|ady: that really should be penaly now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: live scores under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well that won't work|pg||
nt|skaftij:  What a shot!|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and it does go off but not enough perhaps|pg||
nt|gracelin: the lead maybe referred to as Canape lead.  You bid your longer suit but lead your shorter one.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: the bid worked out well|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 3@S from north  6 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy off to amazing start winning 96 of possible 100 VPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@S gets raised without primary support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they seem to be the in form team :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North in the tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so suit not good enough for 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: lack of 3@S has made it difficult to reach the best spot|pg||
nt|star6ija: Martel has to repeat the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Chip Martel would bid 3N instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ok ale ja skorzysta³em z okazji by co podszczypn¹æ - jak to mam (mom?) w zwyczaju|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and they'll win it there probably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: folks, try to analyze like the players, not as double dummy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: north-south are too high|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt 20-22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a bit unlucky  but  Drijver expected better hand from Brink -- and certainly not @HA|pg||
nt|barnets: playing 4@S in open|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ady: that mey sound like a cu  agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is ok...repeating them immediately would have shown more solid colour|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- in general, 4 of a previously bid major is offer to play I believe.|pg||
nt|ady: rather than trying to show 6 card suit not shown earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now South in the tank|pg||
nt|kit: But if Stansby is thinking, then there may be some doubt|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, agree.. but now Martel's p may think abt @ds fit..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you know how Martel-Stansby treat 4th suit after jump shift?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@s is still safe double dummy I think|pg||
nt|kit: no I don't, Al|pg||
nt|panosk: looks it wont make|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The Netherlands offcourse the higher the better because then you get to pick your opps|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they end up in their best fit with good controled bidding it seems. |pg||

nt|ryskiel_: w³asnie by³o|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller made 4@S on  2|pg||
nt|ady: this could be very expensive   spade lead and diamond through|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  as we can see 4@h is close tho...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and in natural bidding you can end in @h and with 16 opposite 8 think many will be in game...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but a @h lead against 4@h is killing too|pg||
nt|alnanda: yes 4@h is posible altough hard way to make|pg||
nt|ady: that lead wont upset declarer    but any lead likely to be good for south  except maybe a low spade|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Oosman, Jan:)|pg||

nt|oosmanb: in Usa 2 vs Bulgaria board 2.. 1NT is being played by West!|pg||
nt|andersk: Looks like down, even if he gets the sp right! |pg||
nt|andersk: EW only has to avoid dummy to get entry to the 3rd and 4th sp|pg||
nt|xenya: had N chosen to advance more slowly (5@C?), they might have stopped in 5 |pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: i am not sure what a double of 4@S would have been, but maybe similar to the double of 3@c earlier, saying "i want to bid on"|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think with making 3@d is a good result|pg||
nt|ady: will be enough on best defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: now the spade switch|pg||
nt|ady: Semenra will do better not to cover the high spades|pg||
nt|ady: diamond from west  devasting   3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a big opportunity for china|pg||
nt|ady: could be around down 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bell tolls for someone|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe east is putting the chilren to bed before commencing the slaughter|pg||
nt|roswolf: children|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Shi had the @SQ in his hand, put it  back|pg||
nt|ady: low spade from east best    but cant expect that|pg||

nt|ady: to salvage something|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Shi still thinking, alle the cards still open|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Sementa calling director|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd2 flat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe this pair does allow raise on 3   |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Stefanov in 4@S North|pg||
nt|ady: North giving preference on 4 and 2 of diamonds instead of showing a likely 6 card suit seems where it went wrong|pg||
nt|star6ija: I like Martel's way of bidding|pg||
nt|stoffers: Loosing a couple of diamonds and maybe one spade here, more coffee :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks and 5 imps.|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S not unreasonable contract especially if @DA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking...he placed the cards on the table and deep in thought|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: so far canada has been the aggressor and it has worked|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|lml: they stole the contract on board 2 in 2@D|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|santyclz2:  Slam is off an ace and the @sq, in addition to needing reasonable @h splits.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Much too good for Roland, sub-par for the rest of us.|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|kit: I guess he chose to raise spades instead due to the jack of spades.  Losing hearts might go on the diamonds, particularly if Rodwell has the king.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Considering Meckstroth's minor-suit holdings, it is hard to see how the 4-4 heart fit can be better than the 5-3 spade fit.|pg||

nt|hantveit: if partner bids 3D, you say 3S as force, partner can insist on 4D with 4+ dia|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree completely|pg||
nt|hantveit: a@h|pg||
nt|hantveit: great, thank you, it only took me 6 years to learn that|pg||
nt|hantveit: operator, please tell them to not rush|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Sorry, the director came, Angelini had 14 cards|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: what bid do you like by south?|pg||
nt|barnets: needs a spade lead here to set 3N e/w|pg||
nt|pbundy: hi everyone :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this big club 1@D bid is NEVER  54 minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 5@C perhaps|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S can go down while 4@H is always making|pg||
nt|athene: north must suspect that east has hearts, so why not give him a bit of a problem?|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: yes 5@C is a good save|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: west's pass showing some values I think|pg||
nt|lml: a matter of style|pg||
nt|athene: hello good morning everyone|pg||
nt|udo: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: still 2-0 -- i think it will be a record across the matches on those boards|pg||
nt|lml: I guess double makes sense with four spades and a not great club suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Italy-Netherlands 0-25 on the same 2 boards|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will end in 4@h making probably|pg||
nt|bt: grue and lall doing their best to give up small imps at the other table, all of us swedes are grateful|pg||
nt|bt: and hi everyone|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @s still good against 5 @h here -so little battle |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4-fit, 11-13|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kemperg: hi all|pg||
nt|lechcold: tym razem 1@C Wujotowy|pg||
nt|boedhy:  plus 1 even |pg||
nt|ady: Bulgaria got 6 immps on hand 1   losing 50 in 4 diamonds   5@D doubled in OR   300|pg||
nt|ady: obvious down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Iceland stops in 5@S on  3|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H might fail|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow going for slam|pg||
nt|ady: would be unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 @s + 3 @h are a risk to open 2@s weak|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=limit raise or better   2N=strong NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: it is maybe inverted minor and 2N showing 15-17?|pg||
nt|alnanda: there is no difficulty reaching 4@h, i think..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: noooo Jan is catching up after the tech problems|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: These guys are good, and VERY FAST |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: najbli¿szy prawdy by³ maciej12 poda³ 45imp...wynik by³ 415-376|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal thimg to do is ofcause bid 4 @s -if they know that to be ok -and let ns deside after that -so maybe 5 @h =|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@D israel in open|pg||
nt|ady: but 3-0 heart split and needing a club ruff may be too much|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: even without being a convention it suggests that kind of hand|pg||
nt|xenya: more realistic|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West dbls 3@D now, but director tells them to wait for safety|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Well, we will find ou later how 3nT was made erhaps duck a @d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Lars|pg||
nt|hantveit: so, a penalty for ew.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south just hopes his partner doesn't do anything uncooperative, like bidding clubs :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1N 18-20|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D is a spade raise- exactly what this promises varies from partnership to partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East doesn't accept|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so bidding is as displayed, only North doesn't see it yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pushed to North now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North has to decide the final contract now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does 4@H need @s guess or no?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1H showing @ss|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Wijs did not enter with @h bid on bd3, allowing Einarsson to support with 2@s iso 4@s|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and tends to be bad hand for slam|pg||
nt|stoffers: some might bid 2@d on Duboins hand here, me included. He may regret it now when partner leads clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Same lead in the OR.|pg||
nt|wild card: hi|pg||
nt|wild card: this looks like a makebale contract|pg||
nt|wild card: *makeable|pg||
nt|lml: this may work out well for Israel|pg||
nt|lml: pretty aggressive bidding by this team so far|pg||
nt|xenya: and how|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR Weinstein overcalled 2@C instead of doubling|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict some 14 imps to Israel on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: MArtel has found a book|pg||
nt|lml: its a style thing but the club suit looks pretty weak to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and has started reading in it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't pass, but the tray wa spushed to the North side already|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and North bid already and SW saw it when the tray was pulled back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director walked away, i Didn't hear his ruling..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Tray is at WestSouth side now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Think director went to get some help|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nd director here: they said it's more complicated|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the meantime i go for a coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Norths 3@S is treated is as a bid of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: without screens|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East can accept 3@S or let the tray go back to Fredin|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East asking what the total consequences ar|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west passes, north bids 3@s and auction proceeds as normal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west doesn't pass, then if north bid @S's (at any lvl) south has to pass 1 round|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: If west doesn't pass and North bids something else than @S south should pass the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|andersk: interesting 4@H here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: same here :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: china lost 3 imps on bd17 2@S-1 by the chinese south in the other room|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is unlikely to misguess H position now.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south also has a tough lead.  3 Aces and a singleton trump, all unappealling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is either balanced  or   5minor 4Major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@C isn't giving east any problem|pg||
nt|lml: he liked the stiff spade and the club fit|pg||
nt|lml: so will south cuebid the @HK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=shortness|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so were back now..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And we are back live now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and first imps for iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Board 18 was a 4@c down 2 in N|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well done Jan and thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a 4@s making on board 19|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes well done Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Now we are LIVE again - and 2nt showed a 3 or 4 card @s support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice to see some totally natural bidding :)|pg||
nt|xenya: so Sweden are off to a flying start in this match -- very important for them  as they are currently 9th, closely followed by Australia and Japan |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ashley in the tank now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Muller did bid @H:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  5 @s is not easy to make without a @c lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bidding defensive does have downsides too|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer needs to use his high trump to play the red suit.  Club can be led from either hand.  So better win and start a red suit.|pg||
nt|hantveit: why not 3!AH |pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  think this will go down so 8 imps or so to iceland|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and thanks 350 specs for hanging in there with us :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a great start for the "hometeam" |pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes and an important match it is. |pg||
nt|jbennet: An x with void hearts dangerous.|pg||
nt|pbundy: a possibility that the extreme trump break may give declarer a problem here - IF they do indeed declare in 3@H|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 aIh|pg||
nt|hantveit: see, I lost it again|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H would have been much better|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3a@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: Trendafilov will attack hearts now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is asking questions at moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW lead 2nd/4th against suit and nt     upside down signals focusing on count|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so we have to wait and see|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds 3-2  and hearts 4-4   this should roll home|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say, @D to the Ace, small @D ruff, small @S to the Ace and another @D ruff, @S to J and @D ruff and @SK. Do we get to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I cant see the title of it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South annoyed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  there is.....|pg||
nt|boedhy:  strange bidding form south 2@c round forcing|pg||
nt|hantveit: I am slow, but I think I got it now|pg||
nt|hantveit: @C|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphznv: bulgaria scored 10 on the slam hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: he would rather have seen a redouble:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South to toilet now|pg||
nt|bt: thanks martin|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello Lars yes sweden has picked up a few so far|pg||
nt|xenya: 8 teams qualify for the quarterfinals -- and this is the last round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similiar situation here|pg||
nt|kit: scary stop when vul 3NT is so close.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: after Levin put the cards down...North said YOU HAVE SOMETHING :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|ady: have stayed out    have done well   may get a swing|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  well with the odds|pg||
nt|gracelin: when north can only contribute S6 on first trick, south shud know declarer's trumps are all high.|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe Angelini sponsored them as well|pg||
pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: here the KJ of clubs are waste paper- |pg||
nt|boedhy:  if you end up 4th you will get the best team form 5-8 as opponent for instance USA1|pg||
nt|bt: so on the pedestrian heart lead decl has 8 tricks, now he has 9|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another potential good board for sweden|pg||
nt|runnerup: this cant be bad for Sweden either|pg||
nt|barnets: exact same bidding in open room|pg||
pc|cA|nt|antoniz: blisko szczêcia|pg||

nt|oosmanb: interesting on a @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe cullin leads @H|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right |pg||
nt|gracelin: thoug declarer has only 3 obvious loser, he might not have 10 trick since he cannt ruff the 4th D.  North will overruff.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but 3 sP is a choice|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: i would have overcalled 1@H with the north hand but pass is ok if your partner is there for you with a double|pg||
nt|kemperg: the only lossing line?|pg||
nt|wild card: yes|pg||
nt|wild card: but now he's down|pg||

pc|c3|nt|stoffers: no problem...sementa found a @d nomather what :)|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: they are very friendly at the table|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: wow ... well done north south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or was it USA lost 10|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: if you say the name it'd probably turn into a best-seller in a moment :)|pg||
nt|bt: grue had a brain melt in 6@C doubled and lall gave up a second spade finesse, thanks|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sorry - zwyciêzc¹ konkursu by³ marian 12 anie maciej12|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andersk: no chanse to set now|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|alnanda: i think 2@c is drury|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be 2@H only showed a minimum but it's strange anyway|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, but it is hard when we do not know the system. But they should be able to find a 4-4 fit in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Angelini found the 13th card on the floor from last game, maybe that is why he threw away the clubs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ron_sc2002: agree.. partner probably wont bid again so better to make pressure on E and bid directly 5@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on heart lead he makes also|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: would all of you have got to 6@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tricky too bid|pg||
nt|lml: it sure is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now the live scores is down so hope we get that back soon|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm should be made ok i think|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, I a, wrong.  Declarer does have 10 tricks.  He can pitach the 4th D on a good club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi sry lost connx|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oosmanb: Best lead is @d probably|pg||
nt|jbennet: would most likely had led to 4 cl for +130.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 18  other table 5@C going down  so 11 for Sweden|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: in 10 minutes or so he will be brought back to cruel reality|pg||
nt|lml: south asked for a heart earlier|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah trying to make it...|pg||
nt|pbundy: no useful pitch - and a ruff high appears to doom the contract also|pg||
nt|pbundy: not to mention some clubs which must be disposed of......|pg||
nt|jbennet: a narrow escape. for -1. |pg||
pc|c8|nt|lml: with the high spade|pg||
nt|yuval10: he saw KJ@d KQ@s in N, K@h can't be with him as well|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: north might have intended 4@C to say "you can save in 5@C if you like"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: some more imps coming up for sweden|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like another 10 |pg||
nt|hantveit: It must be the @c ace|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: an established partnership like the Herbst have it easier because they know what to expect from each other|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well their is the advatage of being known as a good player......|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: played on @S and @H 3/2. |pg||
nt|yuval10: neither can the A@c|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ryskiel_: pewnie uk³¹da tekst przemówienia obroñczego|pg||

nt|ahollan1: deWijs may open west hand 1N  [or PASS]|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wild card: but when you try to ruff your diamonds you only need spades 3/2 and diamonds 5/3|pg||

pc|h3|nt|xenya: yes, looks like it will be -2 |pg||
nt|roswolf: establish clubs and hold his breath by playing a diamond up|pg||

nt|anton72: but anyway ..Hi Mike ..and thx for the nice job what u doing well !!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 140 looks about right :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: 12 well deserved imps to give Israel the lead|pg||
nt|kamyk: gdyby @CA sta³...|pg||
nt|jbennet: he might deduce south having 2623 from start|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  [4@HN=]   Fallenius in 2@H|pg||
nt|jbennet: that couldnt have been s surprise.|pg||
nt|pbundy: had he known the layout, a club pitch might have been more opportune|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strongly recommend    buckle up   this will be a bumpy set of boards|pg||
nt|jbennet: the hearts were huge huge favourite to be 4-0.|pg||
nt|hantveit: then it makes more sence, but he must have lost if after the opening...|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lml: yes it does but Stansby doesnt know that yet|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but Campos now kowes never to trust Brink anymore|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphznv: he did not ruff yet|pg||
nt|jbennet: but on the other hand there is no way to deep finesse in D lacking 1 entry.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h5|nt|lml: he is about to find out though :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: smalltrue  there was a defence   smalll club at trick 2  possible but difficult|pg||
nt|boedhy:  something i could have told him on beforehand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jbennet: in fact it was 99 % sure that hearts were 4-0.|pg||
nt|jbennet: if not then east only possible distributon were 4324|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphznv: claiming losing a @s and a @H|pg||
nt|panosk: what a struggle for a mere 2@S part score|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@H sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if he makes it lose 2 imps goes it down 7 imps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbennet: and no sane player would sit for 3 h x with 4-c support in clubs and only xxx in hearts.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|star6ija: @c switch would probably defeat the contract|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room, but South described minor 2-suiter|pg||
nt|lechcold: oj|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jbennet: so since j9x is impossible to handle; the issue is play south for EJ or E9.|pg||
nt|runnerup: and no entry to play A9 -so Aj|pg||
nt|jbennet: he might be afraid that south had 2713 from start.|pg||
nt|xenya: well if N had J9x now, the finesse would be essential|pg||

nt|lechcold: tak mi sie wydaje|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not any more -the early club play usually indicates a singleton - else declarer would try to find out more before guessing club|pg||
nt|lml: so 2NT goes doen 2 both ways|pg||
nt|xenya: just 12 imps -- well played by Stansby|pg||
nt|lml: curious hand says oscar the owl|pg||
nt|boedhy:  starnge bidding tho|pg||
nt|ady: might make 4@S on last hand   but unlikely contract|pg||
nt|boedhy:  thought the 4-1 was too much but the @h lead helped a lot|pg||
nt|boedhy:  just loosing two imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now everyone has got the heat up -- also the operator :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: preetty amazing to hold it to -2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now we hope to calm down a little |pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h quickly beaten on a @s ruff in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what a start for sweden|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin-Weinstein are giants of world bridge |pg||
nt|ady: that could be 12 toChina|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w may shoot out 3nt here|pg||
nt|ady: and could get shot for down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 5@C bid would win 4 imps and maybe more if EW will bid to the 5 level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14|pg||
nt|wild card: on fleisher's line of play, he would probably only have succeeded if spades were 3/2|pg||

nt|oosmanb: 4@S |pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|bt: on a heart lead he has some work to do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when you suit is running bid 3nt, dont worry much about stoppers or where 9th trick will come from|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I just love watching these competitive auctions, with world class players making the decisions.|pg||
nt|bt: i assume decl got a diamond lead at the other table here and gave up on the heart finesse, lall doesnt believe much in finesses we already know|pg||
nt|brolucius: It doesn't actually improve my own success at such decisions, but I kid myself that it does.|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: good start for Iceland|pg||
nt|hantveit: 5d at wests han might be interesting if north tries to lift on heart ace|pg||
nt|bobholl: what to bid with the west hand ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: 2@s+5@ss+4@cs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 7-10hcp|pg||
nt|kemperg: should fear a ruff|pg||
nt|wild card: or 4/1 with the 4card with the 3 trumps|pg||
nt|lml: seldom right for a team to play 2NT in both directions|pg||
nt|jbgood: they also use 2@d for the real garbage|pg||
nt|panosk: NS have a minor slam EW will compete |pg||
nt|bt: 4@S might have worked better here, but 1@S is normal|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is the modern style to overcall 1@S rather than 4@S.|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes now a slam again and this is over |pg||
nt|jbennet: thsi is a board where again science takes the pot.|pg||

nt|bobholl: nice position @D K :)|pg||
nt|szalay: always tough to bid game after 1@C (strong)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South's 2@d looks like either (a) hearts (b) both majors|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi all|pg||
nt|anton72: i guess ...both M |pg||
nt|mdgraham: in which case, North may have meant 2@S as a (case a) transfer-accept of hearts (b) well, don't know really|pg||
nt|anton72: no way to ending in 2 @s if partner know 5+ @h i think|pg||
nt|anton72: or may be you are right ...good accept for hearts ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: semi-force|pg||
nt|pbundy: a bit surprised that east did not show a 2 suiter here - particularly given the colors|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: in the Open Room they did start with a weak 2 using multi ... that may have made it a bit harder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S were 3/2, you mean @Hs.|pg||
nt|boedhy:  3crd support|pg||
nt|oosmanb: moderately straight forward hands so far, and almost all the tables playing v fast|pg||
nt|barnets: Israel bid to 5@C here with little values 20 hcp e/w|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 20:20 both sides and partial.|pg||
nt|anton72: anyway sweden can get a big gain here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and it looks lie 4@h has a good play on this lie, but I don't think they'll get there|pg||
nt|pbundy: double now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know the 2@C rebid :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: is he thinking for 6 go to 7 or just pass?|pg||
nt|panosk: *6@D|pg||
nt|panosk: intersting views from kibs coming in |pg||

nt|brolucius: 2@S shows a sound heart raise.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The double shows some spade support (or a doubleton honor) but denies the values to bid 3@S.|pg||
nt|hlortz: and theres always the guilty pleasure in seeing others go wrong - gives us hope :)|pg||
nt|bt: now fallenius should get diamonds in there to involve partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@D now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has a great fit for both red suits, as you see.|pg||
nt|bt: luckily for sweden fallenius would normally, only god knows what fredin would do with that hand|pg||
nt|bt: not even god actually|pg||
nt|bt: fredin has a great mind but for us mortals its hard to understand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if they bid this slam i will say again..woooow|pg||
nt|jbennet: 3h probably some sort of semi fit in spades. a hand unsuitable to rebid 2 NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 25hcp|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @d better than 4 @s -if you loose  one @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = good raise of @H|pg||
nt|xenya: will they get to 4? I'm not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs use 1N as the "cue"|pg||
nt|kit: Very aggressively bid to 5@C in other room -- might make, might not.|pg||
nt|gracelin: they better stay low|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1S shows D|pg||
nt|roswolf: or controla maybe|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much on for n/s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suggestion that 2@d was spades + another - quite possible|pg||
nt|hantveit: pass if 2clubs is majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 2@C is both majors by E|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi David welcome|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning David|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to hear 5D now|pg||
nt|ady: Italians got to 5@D   and guessed the J@S   after the same take-out double from south|pg||
nt|ady: thx    good morning all|pg||
nt|panosk: also clubs beter in case a club ruff |pg||
nt|boedhy:  2NT looks natural tho and that is imo strange but absolutely Brink like....|pg||
nt|ady: request for link  for scores please|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@s MAY BE ANOTHER SPOT NOW|pg||
nt|roswolf: if rdbl showed Hx in spades|pg||
nt|ady: some play that re-dbl showing at least doubleton honor in spades   others play good general values|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@c not alerted on both sides|pg||
nt|jbennet: 2 clubs rebid probably shows some sort of extras. |pg||
nt|hantveit: rebid clubs later|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@D for the lead :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: duboin giving his partner quite a bit of leeway for 2@C at favourable|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 2@H is a fine contract|pg||
nt|lml: lots of tricks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 2/3@S|pg||
nt|bt: now fredin gets no help deciding, thats the problem w 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: north south were silent|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D?|pg||
nt|hantveit: in creative moments :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i wouldn't have bid (afraid of 4@H)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: more than 13|pg||
nt|lml: on the finesses|pg||
nt|wild card: I mean if hearts were 3/2 and spades 4/1 he would have also gone down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||

nt|boedhy:  3@d|pg||
nt|ady: dont think anyone going very high|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D  should be down 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Did not hear explanation of redouble|pg||
nt|ady: 200 as good as any|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3D or 4C seems ok|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi missed a chance to double 1S to show spade. either for lead directing or for competing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess     missorted hand|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think aggressive in the long run is best. |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but his @DQJ are not going to be much use facing shortage|pg||

nt|boedhy:  all pass|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you are WAY AHEAD of the players :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  trying to make up for my last prediction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Duboin thinking now|pg||
nt|andersk: I wonder if 3 @S would be stronger than 4 in this auction?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South worth a move|pg||
nt|ahollan1: likes 4@H & @D filler  but 4333 slows down Drijver|pg||
nt|szalay: rdbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll get the CC from the ecats site and see if I can found out - give 5 mins|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 imp in the air ....|pg||
nt|anton72: but what ..1 by 1 ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely 11 tricks with nice lay of diamonds and spade split|pg||
nt|stoffers: Einarson with a huge hand after whats shown here, i would rather bid 3@s than 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: noticed Zack 's 3@D     presumeable at that point weaker than pass?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can he read the 5 he should|pg||
nt|jbennet: west will rule out 3NT as a playable spot. |pg||
nt|xenya: with NS silent. bidding this slam would have been a real feat|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ola Rimstedt let me know that in the open room they play 6d|pg||
nt|runnerup: if you dont loose any @d -you make 6 -but here -important to loose no @d -whenr you are short of trumps also |pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder how many tables will reach it -- not too many i think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so may be the kiwis can take some badly needed imps back|pg||
nt|szalay: cheap and effective|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Johnsson helping NS get back into game exploration|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@C-3@H-4@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: ns still don't know the bad @S|pg||
nt|kit: East opened the bidding there -- here, they won't get so high.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a common approach in "Brit 1@c" is for 2@c by South to show the majors and 2@d to show one major |pg||
nt|jbennet: but in view of souths 3 cl bid.|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2nt now from Boye I guess|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: with 33 HCP most pairs should reach a slam somewhere|pg||
nt|lml: maybe all|pg||
nt|antoniz: po kierowym lub treflowym -1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this will make for sure - South would love to withdraw his take out double|pg||
nt|skaftij:  this will be 15 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|skaftij:  14|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: definetly imps for the kiwis|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and the night is still young for them -- there will be other opportunities no doubt|pg||
nt|runnerup: there is a way to put a @d loose away so take care of @h by dummys trumps -but now -after @c lead there is no way to go down |pg||
nt|xenya: now, of course, EW may find a save in @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @S only 3 losers    and  that's ok in 4@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  costs 500|pg||
nt|gracelin: when opponents play these transfer responses, one shud take advantage of that.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west again with 2 nt ? secondary @D |pg||
nt|bobholl: don't like to double with no @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: zreszt¹ jak oceni³ Gawry kontrê Kality to ja wiem ale nie powiem|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for a quick 1 off..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well we knew this was coming, if i bid 4@H my intent is to pull any doubles|pg||
nt|bt: i think fallenius could have done better here|pg||
nt|barnets: a spade was led against 5@C that gives 4 spade tricks and dec only needs 2 @D ruffs|pg||
nt|barnets: so will make for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin explaing : 3c is his worst hand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: explaining|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, some play that pass is weaker than 3@C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D showed a sound raise to at least 3@C. 3@C instead would have been pre-emptive.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  just thought too good for 2@S :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: needing a club finesse you really dont want to be in the grand but ...|pg||
nt|ady: nice cheap trick to begin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yet to see a routine game hand:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: so no double - and a small win for Sweden|pg||
nt|panosk: club ruff if in diamonds that is|pg||
nt|ady: e/w taken the non vul save|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yeah|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you were right :)|pg||
nt|bt: you have to make your mind up if you want to involve partner or do guesswork, sometimes informative bids helps opponents also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice bid showing @D help|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@d suits brink|pg||
nt|szalay: no more time to bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: Martel's pass shows equal length in the majors |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and 3@H got it in the OR|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, North doubled 5@d and South pulled to 5 @H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  That went to East wko bid the par contract, 6@d|pg||
nt|skaftij:  North then bid 6@h, certainly reasonable |pg||
nt|jbennet: 2 clubs more likely to an improvised call (not willing to rebid AQ-nano-sixth.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|antoniz: sk¹d znam ten tekst?|pg||

nt|panosk: gd call|pg||
nt|ady: on that lead making 200 anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H   just making  flat     tht Italiaans may well have been in 6|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer might not believe the even spade break|pg||
mb|3D|nt|panosk: 7 imps to Sweeden|pg||
nt|oosmanb: switch to @D probably, looks like only chance |pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: so south knows they are off the @CQ from the keycard response|pg||
nt|udo: @D discard?|pg||
nt|lml: this looks like at least a small pickup for USA|pg||
nt|szalay: wd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i think @CA undisclosed   Brink gets to game, but maybe Drijver should have bid it|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|jbennet: and indeed it worked fine, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't recall if i mentioned    both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|jbennet: enabling NS to figure out the good fit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed it worked out very well   i particular like the way the auction put @SK in West hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: although it may not be 100% certain to grue that the club 2 is a singleton|pg||
nt|hantveit: angelini did not dear say 3D|pg||
nt|bobholl: brave :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|stoffers: But, bad splits and game not making today- quite lucky for him|pg||
nt|ady: best defence down 3   but 4@H should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: 4@D is good if its your contract and gets partner involved, it was on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can someone please give me the running scores link|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver hand did NOT have to be this pure|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: as expected, bocchi bid 5@C and reaped a large reward|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, I do not like to double with void either. 2nt showing 6 clubs an 4d would be my choice|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: the canadians were a bit lucky|pg||
nt|lml: 6NT by north can go down if the spade and clubs are offside|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely ruff and would bank on @D finesse, whick is correct.|pg||
nt|ady: in fact sorry this is down 2|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have the club pips to restrick to 1 loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: from south 6@C is better |pg||
nt|lml: with the @SQ protected|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North had a chance to double 2C but resisted - |pg||
nt|xenya: -1 on the lead?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think 3@s will make also|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have only just come back from a week-end away, so I don't even know which teams qualified.|pg||
nt|barnets: in 5@C dec takes care of his 3 diamond losers by ruffing 2 and pitching one on the long spade|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: indeed me too another 7|pg||
nt|hantveit: angelini woke up now, and this might be the advantage with boyes double. He has points. 2nt is more defensive|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: if he plays a trump now, the roof comes in; south just draws trumps|pg||
nt|lechcold: tak czy siak -12|pg||
nt|roswolf: now he will|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ron_sc2002: and the defence made the same to beat 5@H|pg||

nt|hantveit: dia A, partner ask for more dia|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be only -1 (KQ@C take care of @S|pg||
nt|hantveit: east must hold xx in clubs after the 3 club bid|pg||
nt|hantveit: I do not think it is enough time bob, east might ruff the third club with a low heart|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: as the cards lie of course nothing can hurt a grand|pg||
nt|jbennet: think west is thinking of guarding agaist sp 5-1. (if they were then winning the lead in dummy had been fatal).|pg||
nt|pbundy: he simply may not have wished to lead away from AQ in hearts or the like|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: but roofs coming in hurt less when it's just 50s :)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: no well still OK for NL|pg||

nt|lml: if north doesnt play a spade|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbennet: east's silence over 1 sp allowed NS to nice and quietly find out that thier cards fitted well.|pg||
nt|pbundy: all's well that ends well tho - for USA  2|pg||
nt|hantveit: for north, it maybe looks like boye holds 4-0-4-5. In that case he might play club KQ at once|pg||

nt|athene: south will score the @D7 at trick 13 too|pg||

nt|bobholl: will be -2 now|pg||
nt|hantveit: spade ace, q from han, and spade J might work against some, but not here|pg||

nt|bobholl: meckstroth open 2@H with the N hand|pg||
nt|hantveit: will probably try spade ace and club q. -2 is for sure now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: it might have been a buit harder if South split the heart honors|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ryskiel_: wszystko jedno|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 100 honors?|pg||
nt|hantveit: why not, it looks like a std weak 2 if you play that|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: ale roznie zapiszê bo ciekawe|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes South doubled 1D in OR- even you and I would have doubled David - old and conservative as we are|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|lml: Stansby took a reasonable shot single dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ginossar asks if its possible to play a little faster|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: almost played one hour and only 5 boards completed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and with 5@c going down good result i think for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Last night I spoke with the icelandic pair in this room for some time|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they had a testmatch some time ago against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and did they tell anything interesting..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and was beaten quiet heavily|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|barnets: dec lost a spade ruff |pg||
nt|gracelin: Guess this East hand qualify for good 15|pg||
nt|pbundy: someone asked me on the last hand if i would have bid vul with east's hand:  no!  but at these colors, i would have entered|pg||
nt|hantveit: a 21/19 fight these hands are more important then many believes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if south had ventured 2nt over 2@H that might have pushed EW into 3@H-1, but it was a bit hard with a 3 count|pg||
nt|antoniz: wietne szkoleniowo|pg||
nt|ady: problem for north  if he does double 2@C   then they will reach the making game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6D doomed but where will this end?|pg||
nt|barnets: in 5@C|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|ron_sc2002: 2NT maybe is a fit-inv|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi overcalled 1@H as expected|pg||
nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
nt|ady: possible to get overboard   but 6@D should fail|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, I was disconnected and missed that competitive auction. I will look at it via the MOVIE button.|pg||
nt|barnets: he had it made by not finessing clubs|pg||

nt|rnmalik: transfer to @C.|pg||

nt|anton72: good sacriface from OR by England ladies|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't know their range but seems a bit strong to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I would call the north hand a mixed raise ... 2@D suggests a limit raise to me|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: invitational values|pg||
nt|udo: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: explained from Versace to Masood|pg||
nt|ady: around 1NT  loooks likely|pg||
nt|wild card: what's the range of 1NT?|pg||
nt|lechcold: wejcie hmhmhm...graniczne:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some play that 4D =D and H|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that Fallenius failed to take Lars' advice and show his second suit - paying the price.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@c = majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: East knows of only 8 trumps between the hands, but may take the push to3@H on a 5-5 hand. |pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D looks a likely spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: if east bids of course|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: yes, uncontested 1@H-2NT is limit with 3 or 4 cards; clearly a raise here too|pg||
nt|lml: its pretty close between the two choices|pg||
nt|famus: Hello Udo & William|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N=12-14 EXCEPT  3rd seat vul = 15-17|pg||
nt|wild card: thx|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but not here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North said "content"|pg||
nt|anton72: 5 @d is cool .....even 6 could me made without @h lead and right guessing @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: more spades from west|pg||

nt|skaftij:  Hello all|pg||
nt|stoffers: Rising with King best now|pg||
nt|stoffers: Hi there Denmark :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sort of :-)|pg||
nt|ady: off beat pre-empt has caused havoc|pg||
nt|runnerup: here also a nt game sits|pg||
nt|bobholl: poor n will have to bid 3@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: no ok   north likely considered his hand to flat to look for anythin more than game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1nt opening is 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but maybe N didnt like his distribution 3343|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: is this just club values or a game try?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Game try, I suppose.|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  a make     5@S   a save non vul against vul|pg||
nt|ady: or 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some use 2@d from south to say no pref|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: Pass is clearly forcing in this situation|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: E with 6-5 will bid again|pg||
nt|ady: I meant for n/s   but e/w got there first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  And in that board we see the other site of Brink bidding a daring 5@c drove the opps to high|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are a very good pair never the less|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they are pleased with the way there are playing in the tournament so far ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so the Iceland team knew this would be a VERY VERY difficult match|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: why not 3@C instead of 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: = and so far they were absolutely right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Skaftij types faster|pg||
nt|kit: Either way, West has easy 3@H call.|pg||
nt|hantveit: can they double again?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door North expressed his happiness|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 2 down after perfect defense (2 club ruffs) will lose an imp for Sweden|pg||
nt|bt: well commentators all of us suggested @D bids, but he is the one playing the world championships so ...|pg||
nt|andyv:  1     ITALY  3582   NETHERLANDS 342    USA 2 3424   ISRAEL 314.35   USA 1 310.56   ICELAND 308.57   NEW ZEALAND 2998   CHINA 295.5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Swap West's black suits, so his K-Q were assisting partner's help-suit, and he might have gone to 4@H.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin said 3c was game try... and said I havent seen you rejecting a game try in 3 years loool|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has limited dummy entries -- but if South leads a club that will make his life easier.|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe due to the 5-card major.  Some still reject to open 1NT with a good 5-card M|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: has to sac|pg||
nt|athene: versace's pass over 5@S clearly encouraging his partner to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N has bid 6@s|pg||
nt|udo: sacrifice is successfull, but not so clear for me|pg||
nt|famus: EW different league--to say the least!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now Lauria thinking again|pg||
nt|udo: if he bids 6 @S,,wd|pg||
nt|star6ija: complicate decision for Martel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Aronov will open 1N and Stefanov will bid  so  nobody stopping in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like..he is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D down 1    but difficulty for north to do anything|pg||
nt|star6ija: no...Stefanov will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- does DBL now show 2@D?|pg||
nt|star6ija: they play 14-16 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|jbgood: Bermuda Bowl running scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|ady: 14-16 no-trump I am told so even more reason for north to just go to game|pg||
nt|brolucius: Always a good idea to bid NT as soon as possible with a balanced hand. Here North rebids 1NT to show 11-14.|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks like a normal 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Weinstein: i almost bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but an ok spot has been reached|pg||
nt|anton72: verry pesimistic bidd here by E-W|pg||
nt|bobholl: s didn't double 2nt so pass quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: this should be another fast board for makeing maximum partscoore|pg||
nt|hlortz: good result ew in OR here |pg||
nt|xenya: EW in trouble now|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: I expected this bid|pg||
nt|xenya: a club lead beats 4@S...|pg||
nt|lml: I am going to guess that this hand wont be played that quickly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when opponents have the ranking suit, show your second suit, when they dont is less important|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice brings both minors into the picture|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, if he bids 4, I think boye will double|pg||
nt|bobholl: boy will have to choose ruff's or lead @C|pg||
pc|c5|nt|skaftij:  Only lived in Denmark last 31 years, being an Icelander|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well i think you want to be in 4@h with such strong @h|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a lot of bidding by EW, but this will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N scramble?   i.e. no preference|pg||
nt|szalay: sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 20  [3@HX]    Fredin 4@H undoubled|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bertheau looking at lall and the X as if he is asking if it asks for a special lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: not sure where west could consider running - if indeed that's going through his mind|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Lall saying no|pg||
nt|hantveit: club to ace, club 4 to king and dia ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: 3 clubs a possibilty   but not obvious for north with small values|pg||
nt|lml: North-south can set up a diamond for a club pitch now|pg||
nt|xenya: but naturally enough, a @D has been lead|pg||
nt|lml: Just to make it clear to a few who asked.  On a club lead you win the club and you cant set up diamonds fast enough|pg||
nt|lml: east-west keep leading clubs and will set up a trick before you can get a diamond discard going|pg||
nt|lml: on any other lead north-south can play diamonds first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s lead|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will make this |pg||
nt|boedhy:  the @h are also helpfull in 3nt offcourse|pg||
nt|boedhy:  1@s 4@h 2 in each minor|pg||
nt|runnerup: little under point -but makes like it is -something to play and bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh yes, with 11 losers and x-x-x in the help suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: all laughing|pg||
nt|kit: I think declarer will use his one and only dummy entry for a club finesse.  That works, but he will have to lose 3 trump tricks for down 1.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: so you think it is right to give up on making the contract kit ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table|pg||
nt|kit: South has a problem here -- he can't be sure his partner has only 3 spades, unless they always bid higher with 4.|pg||
nt|barnets: rather than try to make it|pg||
nt|kit: why does that give up?  Can't somebody have Ax of hearts?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes Ax hearts is good enough|pg||
nt|anton72: i think W can continued with DBL over 2 @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you are unfamiliar with screens    NE are on one side and SW on the other side of the divider|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all questions are directed to screenmated|pg||
nt|jbennet: must have been a misunderstanding here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and  BOTH players alert partnership bids|pg||
nt|pbundy: i don't think that justin can even go wrong on the lead - vis a vis being able to beat the contract|pg||
nt|jbennet: x followed by pass should not be forcing. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: it sure looks like 2N was for minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2N wasn't alerted|pg||
nt|jbennet: therefore 2NT should not be natural but competitive for miors|pg||
pc|cA|nt|udo: parscore reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: he cannot afford to leave opps here as far as 2@d could be made as well as 3@cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct   Aronov-Stefanov NT=14-16|pg||
nt|antoniz: +1 imp|pg||
nt|lml: a diamond lead makes it a piece of cake :0|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4@h-3  in board 5?? Might be entered wrong|pg||
nt|bt: in the open room grue was very aggressive and paid a heavy price|pg||
nt|brolucius: The top 8 teams in the round-robin, at end of play tonight, will enter the quarter-finals of the knock-out stage.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pairs need to define whether or not DBL creates force -- and if so, up to what level|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|famus: wd--wonder whether the other room wud b pushed to limits|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be hard to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: ok, might be harder now|pg||
nt|athene: lauria doesn't know his partner has quite so many clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry lost connection|pg||
nt|ady: taken the plunge     looks like 2 spade trricks and 2 diamonds     |pg||
nt|panosk: still talking about last hand privately sorry :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: anyway the 1S opening let them stop in time.  Seems to lose nly 1S, 2H and 2D, but maybe 1 3rd D.  Declarer shud have covered DK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: Baxter is heading to dummy for a diamond pictch on the heart  and a spade play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exactly!|pg||

nt|odysseus69: what action over 3S? double or 4H?|pg||
nt|ady: would you not prefer double  than 4@H Victor  and then possibly bid  diamonds if partner responds clubs?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzer rightly suggests that West should think again when 4H is doubled|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this works on my computer|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a cunning low @s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are 4th, you usually find yourself with some stiff opponents that none of the other top 4 wanted to face.|pg||

pc|cK|nt|skaftij:  nope|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: @CK asked for count there i would imagine|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Should make comfortably|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to go wrong in defense - but Fallenius thought it through|pg||
nt|hantveit: no rush to overtake club q as boye holds HK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|stoffers: yes, will just make now|pg||
nt|ady: that at least gives a chance of reaching a good spot   or possibly 3@SX|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont think so, I looked at bidding and it seemes like Fredin Falleinus had a misunderstanding!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oops|pg||
nt|jbennet: DD 3NT unbeatable.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but east doesnt know it. |pg||
nt|runnerup: east is worried that 1s are not 3-3 .that is one problems out of fju|pg||
nt|jbennet: awkward communication problems. |pg||
nt|jbennet: east doestn know that NS is unable to take 3 d tricks.|pg||
nt|jbennet: west..|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- if he cashes @CK now and crosses to @SQ to take two clubs, what will he discard from dummy? |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they made in the open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was he supposed to start @C firsr?|pg||
nt|yusufb: salvoda direktore bunlar kayda alýnsýn demiþ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: they play upside down|pg||
nt|ady: might make an overtrrick as it has gone|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well for declarer |pg||
nt|lechcold: jak mi siê zdaje, Kalita móg³ po³o¿yæ graj¹c kiera w lewie drugiej!! to dlatego, ¿e N mia³ za mocne kiery:)) ale to by³oby zagranie dla nadcz³owieka|pg||

nt|bt: we have 5 teams battling for last two spots|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks to the kibs who sent me the link.|pg||
nt|xenya: so this appears to be a poor line|pg||
nt|jbennet: if he cashes club ace and enters hanf with sp Q then no make.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S9 promised 10  [Rusinow]|pg||
nt|pbundy: nystrom can get up to 8 now ...|pg||
nt|jbennet: this is en axample why top pairs should emphasize NOT on slam bidding in undisturbed auctions, but to define thier methods in common competitive situations. suck as this one.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nystrom asking how light 2@c can be|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: grue saying he does it on 'sick' hands|pg||
nt|pbundy: my guess is he is weighing whether or not to go for 8 tricks - or cash out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: almost always shows 13 cards|pg||
nt|pbundy: if the diamond is off - won't be pretty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 21  Fredin opens intermediate 2@S and plays there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that was hand with the slow auction to perfecta 4@S|pg||
nt|jbennet: note that 2NT balnacing bid was well chosen enabling ew to find laydown 3 cl|pg||
nt|pbundy: a report from a relative of one of the players that they are declaring 2@S in the other room|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: so no problems now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes prefer double but I have become modern??? and play 4D=D and H|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: it is terribly hard to see that a diamond would help from the south hand|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has a chance to make it even if south ducks the club as many you suggest|pg||
nt|lml: but probably wont|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: small @d lead would have been great by N|pg||
nt|lml: baxter can throw a club on the heart and guess diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is now a push|pg||
pc|hA|nt|boedhy:  @d back costs a trick|pg||
nt|jbennet: good shot so far .|pg||
nt|gracelin: if he ruff spade first he can establish a spade winner to discard one of the losers.|pg||
nt|hantveit: -1 now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wild card: in the other room, west raised his partner to 3NT immediately|pg||
nt|wild card: a good bid in my opinion although we can see 3NT won't make on this board|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer "knows" @Ds are 3-3|pg||
nt|panosk: E will be worried momentarily about a @D ruff but he soon be relieved|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm also watching that room via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: New Zealand are the only real surprise in the top 8 at the moment. Well done to them.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|star6ija: first blood US, unless Aronov steal 8th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but with the @s with open is understandable otherwise you can see the 4 @h in hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|famus: so they get the max|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kit: Levin figures South has to help him out.  And in fact all this may work.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North thinking now|pg||
nt|brolucius: North wondering whether to ruff (and play a diamond)|pg||
nt|kit: But may not be good enough -- that 7 of hearts is a problem perhaps.|pg||
nt|pbundy: if he hooks and it loses - no more tricks for declarer.........|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy leads China by 15|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am told that once west doubled, e/w had to double declarer for penalties OR bid 2NT|pg||
nt|jbennet: taking AK = sure -500|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  1N-(2@C)-3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: at least :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: as ew lost a dia trick|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kamyk: @D D nie nowinna byæ w pe³ni liczona przy ocenie, czy mamy na inwit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tap tap |pg||
nt|gracelin: now declarer needs to guess the trump.  Lead HQ maybe, when south already showed SA and DAJ10|pg||
nt|gracelin: this way is also good. not touching trumps at all|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am quite sure declarer is now making.  Well done, Lian.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: can bring down K@H in 3   but cant play a spade from north at the same time|pg||
nt|stoffers: and if declearer had the T@s Sementa would have been squeezed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|ady: that would solve the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D9 looming large|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Baldursson can survive en passant|pg||
nt|skaftij:  even if spade tap|pg||
nt|anton72: 4 down|pg||
pc|s9|nt|stoffers: check that score operator|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he claimed down 1 , saying sorry for misplaying @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: for now i dont say anything...|pg||
nt|stoffers: oh, wrong claim|pg||
nt|stoffers: correct|pg||
nt|boedhy:  9 tricks at the end|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that site works folks so use it instead of the official|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jbennet: he might try heart Q after the spades.|pg||
nt|jbennet: finessing = good chance for -200. No disaster.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|skaftij:  ah|pg||
nt|anton72: pretty cool defence ...but only 200 ....|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hantveit: sorry, I wrote it before I saw h ace, |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbennet: if so then South ducks and then ducks again on the 2nd heart|pg||
nt|xenya: @DK now for -2 |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Would Drijver think for a while with Queen?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's ruff with his higher trump is called an 'uppercut', The aim is to drive out a higher trump from declarer and perhaps promote partner's trumps.|pg||
nt|kit: simply forcing declarer to ruff was enough -- Levin loses control, even if he plays 10 of hearts here.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: spade favourate now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  probably same result at the other table....Muller playing?|pg||
nt|pbundy: well guessed by nystrom|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbennet: if north discards a D|pg||
nt|xenya: tap tap|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bt: they deftly added a norwegian, but isnt NZ focus elsewhere this morning?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: more imps to italy|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|anton72: sweden will be lead with 1 imp after this|pg||
nt|hantveit: boye will duch hearts|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbennet: now moment of truth.|pg||
nt|xenya: now he is down to a @H guess|pg||

mc|7|nt|xenya: S has ducked smoothly enough i think|pg||

nt|boedhy:  another good result for Brink Drijver...|pg||
nt|ady: likely 4@H|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 6 boards in 75 mins is painfuly slow|pg||
nt|xenya: still down but only 1|pg||
nt|xenya: same idea|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Sorry, wrong claim at first|pg||
nt|roswolf: -3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: smolen and 4@S i guess, here|pg||
nt|wild card: by staying somewhat lower, south africa gained 3 IMPs, getting the lead in this match|pg||
nt|barnets: that was a flat board same result in open|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: losing 2 clubs and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|bt: not that u guys care about that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  and is forcing|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: 4@H a likely contract for NS and makeable as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however 5D should not escape from a double|pg||
nt|jbgood: very good result for the Aussies here|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The youngsters (ok 30) are among the top 5 in the world|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s looks makeable but deeds some guesses|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: time penalties are looming in this room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D    |pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt 3nt i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: West noticed 4@S was cold last board|pg||
nt|boedhy:  are they in @h that plays better|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, South had a heavy 2NT available, showing minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another doubled contract made in the open room|pg||
nt|runnerup: spades must be handled -by odds ,but @h must be ducked once -and then you have chances|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: ok, some cunning system :)|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they play some convention here..but they will end in 4@S|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: I am not really sure what 2@D is maybe forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am recording the rugby, so no scores, please.|pg||
nt|bt: and grue lall decided 7@C was good here|pg||
nt|brolucius: 30 points but the hands do not fit too well, and the cards lie poorly too.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't upgrade here because 3rd seat vul and 4th seat always 15-17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@D   go figure|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - since N had no entry to give prd a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Ah de Wijs made an uptrick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they in NT also 1 imp|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looking at that scoreboard the first 6 temas are pretty save..|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes N 5@d doubled|pg||
nt|gracelin: Chicken, I expected 4S|pg||
nt|roswolf: so did i|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||
nt|lml: seems like we have found the actual auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now for east; what shall he do with 1@s bid in N?|pg||
nt|lml: still should east bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking.......by E|pg||
nt|wild card: the four diamonds in the north hand make it liekly for partner to be short|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and you can see why in these 6 boards|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: przy okazji wyg³osi³em pogl¹d (nie do zrealizowania), ¿e cz³owiek najpierw powinien byæ dziadkiem  a dopiero potem ojcem |pg||
nt|garden2005: dzieñ dobry wszystkim :)|pg||
nt|kit: North will be thinking slam after this start|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: four spades is not too far off actually|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AQ@C and @S Ace nicely placed. Key cards for the contract.|pg||
nt|jbgood: brb|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a @s lead did nothing to embarass declarer|pg||
nt|bt: aha rugby is tomorrow, the nz team hopes for bridge and rugby at that time|pg||
nt|xenya: another opportunity for NZ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but this has scored a goal methinks|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS can make 6C if knows to drop Q, In reality, making 5C will be a solid result|pg||
nt|gracelin: and 3NT is equally good.|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow they might get there now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi lost connx again :(|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||
nt|lml: not surprised east thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
nt|antoniz: czeæ Grzesiu:)|pg||
nt|jbennet: is 4 sp really makeable against best defence??|pg||
nt|hantveit: 9 tricks in closed|pg||
nt|bobholl: unlucky lead but reasonable|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
nt|ady: unsafe balance for north in my opinion|pg||
nt|xenya: at last an easy hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like south bid 4N as to play|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah there is some low level bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, it's tomorrow.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, we are away for the week-end and I set the recorder.|pg||
nt|garden2005: mamy potencja³ i naboje?|pg||
nt|runnerup: now @h possition is clear -so helps to play|pg||
nt|gracelin: actually 4S maybe doubled for 800, but might also push NS into reaching a wrong contract.|pg||
nt|roswolf: it cant cost south to make one voluntary squeak ans bifddding 4@C gets them to the races|pg||
nt|roswolf: this certainly does|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: east I feel only woth an invite opposite    but west would have accepted|pg||
nt|ady: is this also 14-16 no-trump Jan ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 15-17|pg||
nt|oosmanb: board 6 has some interesting auctions at other tables|pg||
nt|andersk: Better cash he's 6 tricks, If he looses a club trick early he might go 4 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems to North that his @s will not be pulling weight|pg||
nt|garden2005: no jak teraz @h? siê czuj¹|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tak Grzesiu...niestety naboje co drugi lepy|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|star6ija: the law of the total trumps :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 trumps for NS...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm, can you concede tricks that you cannot possibly loose?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he wrote -100|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Don't know the law too well|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nor really, but operator or players watching arent to say anything |pg||
nt|xenya: you can make 6 here -- but you don't want to be there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  aggresive but controled bidding,  combined with perfect play and some luck :)|pg||
nt|ady: thx   15-17   but even so vould be facing a poor heart holding   west has a nice toppy hand with good hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: Hi David and Lars! I can assure you that the kiwi team has the right focus on today's matches:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seven would have been fine if south had diamond ace rather than KQ|pg||
nt|bt: how did england do? wales was 4th i think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: When North cannot cue-bid in hearts, declarer will know of one hole in his hand.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|skaftij:  but...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  4 imps to Iceland probably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then is thin though with only 8 trumps|pg||
nt|brolucius: The text-books advise you not to bid a grand if there is any chance that the other room will miss the small slam. They also have some advice (I forget it at the moment) about how ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: many aces you need for a grand slam.|pg||
nt|garden2005: w ocenie od zg³aszaj¹cych mi na priv Kibiców, Gawry nie mai³ na 5@d|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW leads  2nd/4th|pg||

nt|runnerup: you lose 1 @s -1 @h -throw one to @c k -and 1 @c ofcause|pg||
nt|xenya: especially as he should know @Hs are likely to be 3-3 for his side|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now they surely stop in 5@S.|pg||
nt|roswolf: in practice this may well be the decisive hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|famus: a natural @s lead -wont get them anywhere|pg||
nt|ady: if this lead is from length the 9@C will ensure only 2 club losers  so the game depends on A@D right|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@H = 15+  5-5 , rest goes without saying|pg||
nt|stoffers: Duboin knowing about a diamondlooser now (no 4@d)|pg||
nt|lechcold: bardzo trafny rebid Gawrysia|pg||
nt|kamyk: gdyby Gawrys powiedzia³ zwyczajnie 2@D, to co sie licytuje z kart¹ E? Mówi¹c 1BA uproci³ rozdanie.|pg||
nt|ady: tricky defence here|pg||
nt|ady: need to win A@S   andplay 9@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 9 tricks whatever defence does- cant get club ruff and 2 heart tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  alot of comment on this remark.|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  can't win this without help from defense|pg||
nt|kit: they should, but it is too high.|pg||
nt|bobholl: world champion 1993 :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: protecting the @DK on the lead doesn't really help EW any|pg||
nt|jbennet: even if taking right view in spades and hearts no way to handle the 2nd heart loser. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry, i missed it    Fredin DID  DBL 3N on 22|pg||

pc|c2|nt|ryskiel_: czy Volva produkowane pzrez Szwedów s¹ te¿ sztuczn¹ metod¹ robione?|pg||

nt|bt: anyway the ns auction at the other table was one of those toughies and they failed, it is good for my team so i am happy|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tylko nie w pika|pg||
nt|garden2005: jedne z komentarzy do rozdania: "mia³ powiedzieæ 4@H  a jak P ma m³ode to przeniesie siê 5@C na 5@D  a tak to du,,,,,,,,! " :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: North would of course bid 6@S with the @SK.|pg||
nt|kit: Better I think to find out if you have strength for slam at 4-level and worry about controls at 5-level rather than other way around.|pg||
nt|barnets: would you rebid  2@S or 2N with south hand ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Close.|pg||
nt|barnets: 2N is the winner|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: once south plays the clubs he now knows he has the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well spotted David|pg||
nt|ady: got the first bit right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might well find H9|pg||
nt|ady: still not that great a game even with a suitable hand with west|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: games that win are good games :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Here North was able to ask for key cards, so there was no problem. Sweden gained advantage from their spade pre-emption at the other table.|pg||
nt|kit: I agree close -- either could work out.  Probably 2NT a favorite on balance.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North said : do not go down in 5|pg||
nt|kit: Granted 5@S somewhat unlucky to go down.  But with better bidding they wouldn't have been facing the bad luck.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Give North the other black jack and it would be not so bad.|pg||
nt|hantveit: sounds like an old wise guy|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: for example if partner has the @DA and you need to set up a spade and have declarer misguess diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moysian fit = 4-3   is this Mini-Moysian  or is that 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: a swing of 25/26 imps |pg||
nt|hantveit: :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|famus: wud he duck???|pg||
nt|ady: 1 trump out of the way|pg||
pc|d6|nt|stoffers: 6 (lucky) imps to Iceland on bd21, they take what they get against opponents like this|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think i wouldnt have passed with north although i opened light|pg||
nt|barnets: yes the @CJ needs to be a spade|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: nowhere to put the diamond losers anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find that duck|pg||
nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|kemperg: he knows @CA with partner, so @DA on leader|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ju¿ wiem ¿e Volvo produkuje siê teraz w Chinach, wiec na pewno sztucznie|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on  6 the auction was 1N-all pass|pg||

nt|jbgood: but still a big gain for Australia|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: actually maybe it was not that hard|pg||
pc|c6|nt|runnerup: maybe -too dfficult -because rigth 2 @s to defence|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lml: he can probably afford a heart now for the uptrick ... we know it will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S had @s 4 in his hands to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  6   Muller in 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: this is a big swing for usa|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: East was unable to read the opening lead of the @S9.|pg||
nt|xenya: think i'll get coffee|pg||
pc|c9|nt|famus: Tahir must b cursing himself for not switching @ds--this is turning into a rout|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Better :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes sorry|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that it matters.|pg||
nt|bt: decl has 12 easy tricks now and a bundle of imps to sweden|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: if his partner has the @DA, the contract is always dead|pg||
nt|ady: should be in game   but I dont feel east should be the one to deccide if there an invitational method|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lml: or a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice play|pg||
nt|udo: i think he should find the duck,,,he knows @D are running most of the time|pg||
nt|lechcold: prawdopodobnie Szwedzi nie byli w stanie zbadaæ co maj¹ w treflach|pg||
nt|runnerup: so no attack to Nyström for pushing ns to game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director in the room ....we will not finish all the boards i think|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|boedhy:  but then west at some point would have bid his @s and making 3 is no problem so think this will be a push|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: s³owem wylosowali z³¹ sekwencjê sporód wielu lepszych|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphznv: i think i missed somethink|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: something|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may all hand on the meaning of 3NT. If that is serious or non-serious, that would effect how strongly North should bid - whether he was worth going past 4@S with his second ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: king.|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer believed king of spades is singleton he might have had a double-dummy line to make on trump end-play.  But Levin could easily play king from Kx.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brolucius: On a lucky day you would make 6@S; today you go down in 5@S.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: and if declarer has the @DA, it is clear that playing ace and another trump just releases control and allows the diamonds to run|pg||
nt|ady: club ruff coming soon|pg||
nt|ady: needs to ruff high|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup cant understand why he didnt draw a 2nd round of trumps|pg||
nt|ady: if they are in a position to draw a 3rd round would go down   had not developed enough tricks|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|athene: this is very often a problem for the defence - whether to draw trumps or not|pg||
nt|lml: declarer in 4@H makes an easy 5 |pg||
nt|barnets: like the belladonna hand v Kantar|pg||
nt|roswolf: wd|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is one trick short to exercise the show-up squeeze, when West need to keep his D and discard one Heart.|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer will get a coubt on the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: count|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: when declarer is trying for a ruff but has a threatening side-suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: and underleading or ducking the ace of trumps is often the key|pg||
nt|ady: diamond play has helped declarer|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|star6ija: this appear to be dreat swing for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|star6ija: great*|pg||

nt|barnets: when Kantar could have played the K from kx|pg||
nt|barnets: in 7@C|pg||
nt|barnets: very similar idea|pg||
nt|barnets: well spotted|pg||
pc|h5|nt|boedhy:  but west would have bid @s so this will be a push i think|pg||

nt|szalay: trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd/4th leads mean  LOW from worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|szalay: to be honest small trump is the best lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: clarification just in case other North Americans are in the room|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW made it easy to stay low|pg||
nt|star6ija: why then they did not use them during the previous board :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol..i think they discussed it|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes sometimes the silence is golden|pg||

nt|boedhy:  Drijver is only 30 but he was old when he was 20....|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Your profile says otherwise|pg||
nt|antoniz: dwie|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@d aldo suggests a singleton somewhere|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: a hard slam to reach but I thought they might|pg||
nt|lml: south has to do something other than 4@h I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: too difficult to find out that either of them has enough entries|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lars, you have any idea of how/why West should bid 3@C? Did he pull the wrong card from the box?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes sweden had a misunderstanding looks like 2@H/1@D[precision] was michaels as many play 2@D/@d as natural |pg||
nt|bt: they play some 2 Major jumps as 4 of that suit and a longer minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H showed hearts and another suit or at least that is what west thought|pg||
nt|bt: west played that convention|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usually best, I find, to treat 1@D as natural initially - even if it may be short.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever of the US North to keep quiet on his amazingly good clubs.|pg||
nt|bt: they only played together for 10 yrs, har to get (1m)-2M right :)|pg||
nt|bt: hard|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer ducks to break communications between West and East.|pg||
nt|kit: In other room Fleisher violated and opened 1@H on the strong 4-card suit -- to his regret, as he wound up in 3@H.|pg||
nt|anton72: verry bad lead by E ...but result is perfect for ENG|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of course, 4@hx would not have been so hot without the 2-2 trump break|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: one of the good things about passing is that you are not defending 4@S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Anders we spoke too soon|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ends in 5@s|pg||
nt|xenya: now it should make|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps grue thinks 2@C shows diamonds?|pg||
nt|jbennet: but on the other hand...|pg||
nt|jbennet: 12 tricks available in clubs.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1:  7  Weinstein in 2N West|pg||
nt|boedhy:  So his hormons could be bothering him|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: do you see my profile as Jan?|pg||
nt|kit: At both tables E-W were temporarily in 3@D whih doesn't make.  But very difficult for N-S to know that.  That is why preempts can be effective.  Even when they seem to get you to a ...|pg||
nt|kit: bad contract, they can still work.|pg||
nt|barnets: if east shifts a club dec may make the hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will play for hearts 4-2, because of the 3@D bid, which leaves West with more non-diamonds than East.|pg||
nt|kit: How can it ever make?  4 hearts, 1 diamond, 1 clubs, 2 spades at most I think.|pg||
nt|barnets: by takiing 4 heart tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: Looks like it.|pg||
nt|barnets: and enplayinq west in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Then 2@C showed @C + @S|pg||
nt|ady: made in OR    chance for China|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't see 6H making on this one.|pg||
nt|roswolf: north doing a lot of bidding - i would have given up on slam long ago|pg||
nt|gracelin: he does have a standard 2 opening and south gave a raise.|pg||
nt|gracelin: also some sign of life with the 3NT bid (rather than 4H).|pg||
nt|jbennet: 11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 22 looks like Hurd will be down 2 in 3NX|pg||
nt|pbundy: even with a diamond out and a spade switch?|pg||
nt|jbennet: and only 10 if defence attack spades when being on lead|pg||

nt|roswolf: a test of south's cardplay|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :) I think he can play|pg||
nt|roswolf: yu|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barnets: for 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|ady: defence started a diamond   but after a losing spade finess  switched to a heart   and now they lost their way|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: which makes no difference as the cards lie|pg||
nt|lml: throwing a heart from dummy on a diamond|pg||
nt|xenya: right|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|boedhy:  no double from west......not good imo|pg||

nt|gracelin: The match will be very close if Bocchi also goes down in this slam|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lechcold: przebicie czwartego trefla po dwukrotnym atutowaniu to najprostsza droga do zwyciêstwa|pg||

nt|skaftij:  kibs tell Traian Chira|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yep...this is me|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Maybe friends list mixes it up|pg||
nt|xenya: EW cand beat it if they lead @Hs or E a @C at some point -- but not easy to defend with N's hand concealed|pg||
nt|ady: now  Q@D  needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: true this looks like playing on tilt|pg||
nt|gracelin: C9 lead is best|pg||
nt|bobholl: even now not made yet|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|wild card: if declarer plays trumps from the top, he'is severe danger of them breaking 4-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: safe lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: don't understand this lead at all.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|ady: looking at all the cards  possible to make 9 tricks    at some stage gaining an entry with the  hearts   play a low diamond from north   and later play the  jack of diamonds  ...|pg||
nt|ady: pinning the 10|pg||
nt|odysseus69: my good friend Dr Haase just pointed out that heart 9 was no good on last since decarer could run to dummys 10|pg||
nt|barnets: he makes 4hearts 1 club 3 spades and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|kit: I see -- we are of course putting the 9 of spades through.|pg||
nt|roswolf: return pard's suit -easy|pg||
nt|ady: now should be down|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lechcold: i no to gra Upmark|pg||
nt|boedhy:  2@s no problem for declarer 3@s on the other hand...|pg||
nt|szalay: trump is standout, isnt it?|pg||
nt|ady: now heart  |pg||
nt|jbennet: yet another passivity warning .|pg||
nt|hantveit: NS can just push spade|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lechcold: na to|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: grue saying he bid 2NT to make them miss their @d fit|pg||
nt|jbennet: west did not act over 2 clubs |pg||
nt|ahollan1: it worked!|pg||
nt|hantveit: or 1H|pg||
nt|hantveit: @h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|boedhy:  sorry @c 3 offcourse|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some teams have a coach, one of whose duties is to research the bidding methods of the upcoming opponents. Here a coach would have ensured that E/W knew what 1@D meant and which ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: defenses would apply.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Brink did well to get in the auction  --  many would PASS|pg||
nt|barnets: no we play a low spade from dummy at end to our 9|pg||
nt|ady: then clear diamonds|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: i don't think he will be able to finesse clubs now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he claimed 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: overtrick??|pg||
nt|star6ija: but they are going to be back shortly as far as I know Aronov - Stefanov simpathy to the higher levels|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but it was me who did not notice that on the king of diamonds \e played the ten |pg||
nt|ady: diamonds played for declarer by defence  so an overtrick last hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: maybe he played the Jack of Diamonds instead of 9|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but did you watch the tempo|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no really they are very very good|pg||
nt|barnets: west wins the 10 and is enplayed|pg||
nt|hantveit: thx|pg||
nt|hantveit: but my english still stinks|pg||
nt|hantveit: no help there|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: the reason that the slam works is that north-south dont have quacks they have controls|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: W asks about 3@h bid to S (screen is lowered first)|pg||
nt|athene: with the hearts cleared|pg||
nt|ady: souths trumps not high enough to defeat this|pg||
nt|roswolf: he may have been better ducking the first diamond altogether|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pbundy: just as long as he didn't have to declare 2NT :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: and east didnt act over 2 NT (he had a cheap 3 cl bid available).|pg||
pc|s9|nt|barnets: not an unreasonable play|pg||
nt|ady: 10@D  signled  entry higher ranking of sensible suit    |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: a possible alternative was to finesse the @CJ earlier, before knocking out the second spade|pg||
nt|udo: next 7 imps for italy  5@S xed vs 6@S xed,,,,,,really one-qay-match so far|pg||

nt|xenya: so 1 imp to USA1|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: trying to get some time back|pg||
nt|boedhy:  very quick play so far|pg||
nt|ady: e/s have a slam|pg||

nt|szalay: small trump|pg||
nt|szalay: after cash AK|pg||
nt|kit: end-play for down 2 and a push|pg||
nt|ady: still 10 back for China   keeps them in the hunt|pg||
nt|pbundy: this could be a danger hand for USA  2, tho - if the spade switch is not found, 11 tricks are there|pg||
nt|pbundy: as we just saw.........|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  23  [3NW=]  Hurd 2@D East|pg||
nt|hantveit: interesting in closed as they failed 3nt by two tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: and canada went ahead ... but with a lot of luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 10-12 1NT|pg||

nt|szalay: and 3@S, a ruff and 2 trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st seat favorable  1N=9-12|pg||
nt|gracelin: Something must be wrong there. China kept on giving Bocchi chances and Bocchi gracefully rejected everytime.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: comes up a lot, generates swings|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: S answars "Usually 15-17"|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Jan, you could give Sementa a piece of paper to alert and explain his statements :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Very aggresive 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|kit: Double is responsive I believe.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C 12+ points and 3+ clubs.|pg||
nt|ady: playable 4@H   but does not make|pg||
nt|ady: could be some more imps for China|pg||
nt|gracelin: and Italy in other room also went down in the 4S that need a good guess in Heart which became easy after south's double.|pg||
nt|hantveit: prec?|pg||
nt|bobholl: they bid 1nt 3nt too optimistic in east|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 6NT isnt terrible.  It just needs the spade finesse|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not easy to see which line is best but ruffing 2 @c in dummy was possible...|pg||
nt|szalay: I prefer to play this DBL rather 'cards' than pure penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7 boards 46 imps|pg||
mb|2N|nt|udo: will end in 3 NT, i think|pg||
nt|famus: well this wud certainly propel them higher than desired|pg||
nt|boedhy:  10 opposite 11 and a quick 9 tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes 3@s down one|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could have been another 4 imps |pg||
nt|boedhy:  and those boards tend to add up...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I dont think thats a good idea at the moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8  playing Tarzan Precision  Muller passed 1@S so Einarsson balanced 2@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Not the best dummy you saw|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand  doubleton @S led thru Q to partner's AKJxx|pg||
nt|kit: That will get E-W to hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: COME BACK   FANTUNES -all is forgiven|pg||
nt|gracelin: so China is only down 17 and there are still two slam swings to their favor.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they opened 1NT showing 16-18 in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: I see no reason for south to try something, at most 24 points in the combined hands|pg||
nt|wild card: and I count only 8 tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|wild card: on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|ady: likely to end in 8|pg||
nt|anton72: unlucky values and numbers of diamonds in E |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 3@h=good raise to 3@S (alas, on this lie one too high) - and 4@s is two too high |pg||
nt|ahollan1: we were told possible adjustment to hand from 5th set|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H just fails by 1 trick|pg||
mb|3N|nt|udo: but cards dont lie very nice|pg||
nt|famus: 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ lead would be very nice|pg||
nt|skaftij:  and reached it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@C  gazilli,  2@S less than 8  no 3@S|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@c = 15+|pg||
nt|lml: but of course this is the normal contract|pg||
nt|xenya: but very tough to bid it|pg||

nt|skaftij:  and agressive 2@h bid here vul |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: correct score on 24 now|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@C= means that 1@C should be 3 down|pg||
nt|runnerup: no -they will get + 150 -200 now -wd|pg||
nt|roswolf: that dbl looks  a tilt double|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will be better off to take out this|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wouldnt|pg||
nt|gracelin: his opening was shaded and he has distribution.|pg||
nt|gracelin: on perfect defense, the decision is 790 Vs. 800|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the problem is that EW have, basically, two balanced hands|pg||
nt|anton72: yes u are right ...even K @d onside still not enough|pg||
nt|pbundy: which hand might that be, al?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Martel's 1@S showed either 5+@C or some shortness|pg||

nt|oosmanb: but he might try to find J@S instead of playing on @h 3-3, lets see|pg||
nt|xenya: lack ot entries to dummy though|pg||
nt|bt: looks like a nice game but on a diamond lead it gets difficult, south is under a lot of pressure though|pg||
nt|garden2005: ja wiem, ¿e Kalita i tak by wygra³ - pochwali³em Jonssona za skrócenie rozdania i za ewentualnego impa|pg||
nt|jbennet: EW now might feel that extraordinary measures are called for.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we weren't told :(|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am guessing not............|pg||
nt|pbundy: a suggestion it might be the last hand where grue declared 2@S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: (nice for declarer, i mean) :)|pg||
nt|ady: can set up the hearts    but no entry with clubs 4-2   so should make just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl this link will work i'm told|pg||
nt|sybarra: hoi Ruud and all |pg||
nt|boedhy:  hoping to get off for 2 down or so..|pg||
nt|brolucius: This affected the draw for the KO-stage and in fact allowed England to progress to the final.|pg||
nt|bt: fredin is famous for leading aces against 3NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|famus: tuff transportation prblms|pg||
nt|athene: probably heart lead now, ducked|pg||
nt|udo: great lead,,,,,,,amazing how often they find best lead|pg||
nt|famus: duck 100%|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: GREAT to watch such leads :)|pg||
nt|famus: dont blame NS to be in 3NT--how much they go down is moot|pg||
nt|ady: if west played 4@H  a trump lead may beat it|pg||
nt|boedhy:  sorry have to go back in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: non vul so no worries really|pg||
nt|szalay: 8 of @H is mighty card|pg||
nt|xenya: well this makes -- but you need to pull out the right card each time you are on lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: it was scored as 110 - but from the play, i'd thought he'd gone down 1|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lml: this looks to make with no problems with the clubs working|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 4-1|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Hi Sybarra cover for me..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: E had @h A in his hand - puts it back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do not know why|pg||
nt|gracelin: there is no way to misguess on this one and Shi is a very reliable player.|pg||
nt|pbundy: WRONG prediction again here by yours truly!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|anton72: in W possition I prefere to play and bid 2 NT inv + |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the jump to 4@s is optimistic, but change a couple of cards in the West hand, and put @dA onside, and it might very well have play |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: 500 here without much bother; that's fine when your game is touch and go|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you lose 3 imps if they make the thin 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they should know their defensive signals at this level|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not easy to see that he could play a @h back...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i tend to think this lead would work more often than any other|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C was a worthwhile bid because it might allow North to complete to 3@C if he held three clubs.|pg||
nt|gracelin: anything but a spade return may see 990, with all dummy's spades going on the good clubs, after 2 round of trumps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|bt: the thought here is that if you want to beat this kontrakt, A@H has to "work" for the defence|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a 'failed Stayman' auction, where responder looks for a major and does not find one, you should favour a major-suit lead. Don't worry that responder has a major. Worry instead ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that declarer will be well-stocked in the minors. |pg||
nt|bt: odds changes slightly when one of the opps hands are very strong like here|pg||
nt|bt: declarer will go to dummy, take a spade finesse and aouth will eventually be squeezed down to his underpants|pg||
nt|bt: south|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have just written a book 'Winning Notrump Leads', with Taf Anthias, where we analysed (by computer) opening leads after a variety of auctions ending in NT. That was one of our ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: findings.|pg||
nt|hlortz: just give w  fewer @H and one more @C say and the lead would be a great success|pg||
nt|brolucius: After an auction of 1NT - 3NT, it is nearly always right to lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even 10-x in a major is better than K-J-x-x in a minor.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fallenius is thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better to win?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table Grue led the @D4.|pg||
nt|bt: fallenius knows partner has nothing else, maybe @DJ|pg||
nt|bt: yea at the other table south was pressured on 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he ducks woolridge will eventually have the option of throwing him in with third heart|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely South knows from the bidding that West holds @HQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would not lead the ace from A-J-x-x|pg||
nt|bt: he must place partner with @DJ thats when there is a possibility to beat this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might but wont continue with jack|pg||
nt|runnerup: but ew seems to make 3nt also |pg||
nt|xenya: and club shift helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8  deWijs playing 2@S West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jonsson was endplayed at trick 2|pg||
nt|szalay: right card means = pull trumps and play finesses?:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: during the pause   i think it significant to note that  all 6 USA teams advanced to KO|pg||
nt|szalay: all we know for right penalty double needs 8 of @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in Bermuda Bowl  4 of 6 European Teams advance|pg||
nt|szalay: 4 from 7|pg||
nt|szalay: Holland is European, I was told|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh that's right  extra team for host country|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those with very short days this time of year   Iceland, Netherlands and Sweden all advanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Israel and Italy   --  i miscounted  5 of 7|pg||
nt|szalay: btw|pg||
nt|jbennet: Thet must have been aware of that they just missed a laydwon game. allowing opponents to play 4 cl making instead  of scoring +400 in 5d. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bertheau saying 4@d is shortness|pg||
nt|bobholl: opposite 16-18 in imps i bid it also indeed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: east south Jan   making a joke|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ahhhh -- I did not understand that :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: he should make an uptrick on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|szalay: Israel is european, as well|pg||
nt|anton72: then over Fionas 3 @s .... or 3@d ...easy can pass|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: but sometimes you gain 12 when it goes off|pg||
nt|athene: those are good odds for just taking the money|pg||

nt|psyck:  You can also find live scores in this link: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Duboin promissed 6@H, 3@S and 15+ points|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ryskiel_: zaraz zaraz co tu siê dzieje?|pg||
nt|ady: seems K@H lead may beat it now  exceot north may later be squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not everyone will open on East which will make it tough to reach game - pass and double Norths 1nt response gets to hearts but maybe not game|pg||
nt|sybarra: one sec and will come back  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S made so Netherlands double partscore pickup on  8|pg||
nt|ady: doomed |pg||
pc|s6|nt|oosmanb: nope @h straight away!|pg||
nt|gracelin: declareris of course worried about a 4-0 trump breaks.  But he will soon find out it's not the case.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but he might misplay because of the "pressure"|pg||
nt|gracelin: HA is the normal play now, but declarer may think deeper|pg||
nt|roswolf: really as long as he doesnt panic this is a cinch|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would set up his side suit - as per general principles|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi is not the man to panic.  He played the last 3 Bermuda Bowls and reached semifinal in 2009.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes which is why Bocchi's malaise is so evident|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Chinese team beat the defending Champion Norway in the QF.|pg||

nt|star6ija: there are some diffivulties|pg||
nt|lechcold: mo¿e byæ:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade to jack seems so normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24   Hurd-Wooldridge find @D fit -- but not @S      5@DX|pg||
nt|jbennet: The only explanation why east didnt pass 4 sp with weak trumps and only 1 ace.|pg||
nt|jbennet: must have been that he hoped for a miracle.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: well, nystrom thought that his unlimited partner made a slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: maybe only needing the club cue|pg||
nt|hantveit: NS, can just push dia every time|pg||
nt|hantveit: or change to clubs now, whatever you fancy|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: some might be wondering why it's so obvious for east to duck his @HA there at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Aronov in 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds taken quickly anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup: without @d lead-or switch  -which is difficult|pg||
nt|ady: should be another 5 to china|pg||
pc|c8|nt|boedhy:  @s @c ducked and @d to the 10 for 6 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult hand - Q10xx Axx xx Axxx and game simply depends on @dA onside, assuming trumps 2-1|pg||
nt|bobholl: n has to find @C switch now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: rallying a bit|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bt: that was strange|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: if you have the ace over KQ it's just standard to duck at top level|pg||
nt|athene: it hurts declarer's transportation|pg||
nt|athene: and also helps your own|pg||

nt|xenya: got to believe in his luck|pg||
nt|ady: still could just get the heart wrong|pg||
nt|hantveit: had to find it for -3, but would still be down with dia|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: now EW can cash two hearts any time west gets in|pg||
nt|athene: if east won the first trick he couldn't attack hearts any more|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer would have a sure trick and an entry|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no right prediction this time Ruud :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: maybe the result but not the line of play|pg||
nt|pbundy: i thought he did, too - but nystrom seemed a bit minimum to me.......particularly opposite diamond shortness|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nystrom did alert as cuebid, not specifically shortness|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: now give up a spade if finesse wrong |pg||
nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein never bid where karaivanov-trendafilo wore out their red cards|pg||
nt|oosmanb: good play, since he knew K@D was the only time he'd get to dummy if A@S is with West|pg||

mb|2S|nt|athene: not automatic to reach the game with that 7 facing 17|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|ady: another flatish hand   part score|pg||
nt|yuval10: Gyorgy sazaly, in an earlier match, suggested that the US teams will be tougher to beat during the KO team, also the Italian one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this time a max NT|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will he have visions of that after 1NT opening|pg||
nt|boedhy:  he should if he hears a fit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the hands fit perfectly|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 1NT will help them win auction in 2@H probably|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Souths pass over 1NT in OR is a matter of style, lots of points but no suit to attack|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S substantially better played by south|pg||
nt|gracelin: oh, the 3D is by north|pg||

nt|brolucius: 4@S is not a silly contract but the cards lie unluckily for N/S.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @H & @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=no pref|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks a good return in OR|pg||
nt|hantveit: looks hard to get more then 9 tricks if ew play spade and spade early|pg||
nt|bobholl: boye will lead @H i guess|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: you would like to just bid blackwood except you might get too high|pg||
nt|brolucius: England was not fancied by the bookies, but what do they know?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of strong 1@C  --  1Major - 4Major is very wide range|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: god guess:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: good|pg||
nt|hantveit: and spade in trick 2?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: some people play 4@D shows this sort of hand -very strong suit with support for partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok i am told 4@C asks for keycards|pg||
nt|athene: if so, north won't be taking so long :) just a matter of counting four steps|pg||
nt|athene: i think 4@C is a splinter in fact|pg||
nt|athene: and north has the well-known problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N shut his eys and looks to the ceiling... thinking|pg||
nt|athene: he has some extras but his only available cue-bid goes past game|pg||
nt|lml: so can west find the diamond lead ... the @DQ|pg||
nt|lml: north should bid 4@H here|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what 2NT would show?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N not convenient with partners bid, 4@h seems logical|pg||
nt|lml: I guess 19?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: can't say, I assume so|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass or correct for N|pg||
nt|lml: the Canadians had a bit of a strange auction on the previous board to end in 1@S|pg||

nt|gracelin: too|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sorry|pg||
nt|roswolf: aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could be opening bid with 3-fit that has no slam interest|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s is limited here, hence the jump to 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as well as what standard players hold for 1-4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: difficult hand to handle here.  As it turns out 6 of either major makes with both majors 3-3.|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: a w RP?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  doubleton @c helps but the good @d arent that much help|pg||

nt|brolucius: My comments are struggling to make it to the Netherlands, appearing after a time-delay of a few seconds. Perhaps someone is censoring them on the way.|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D now, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South already passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: practical bidding|pg||
nt|ady: maybe diamond lead   free finess for a club pitch|pg||
nt|roswolf: might have been an excitinf auction the original thiugh:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: neither 3NT nor 4H makes.|pg||
nt|anton72: yes Dhondy open 1 @c 2 + cards ..and both swedish afraid from clubs :)|pg||
nt|anton72: go in 1 NT or in 2 @c|pg||

nt|olegario: Hello all, Thank you leao! olegario from Belo Horizonte, Brazil|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will W bid spades? or diamonds?|pg||
nt|ady: east may have trouble keeping trump control to bring in the diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: north considering playing the king|pg||
nt|bt: we have the same contract here, east will lead @HA and west discourage, then diamond shift|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H usually forcing. If so, 3@H must mean a big two-suiter (or a splinter agreeing diamonds).|pg||
nt|barnets: Israel bid to 3N in open|pg||
nt|kit: I think Weinstein should just bid 4@S and end it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Weinstein thinking...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: right, so i can believe THIS is keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does 1@D imply unbalanced hand?|pg||
nt|lechcold: by³o|pg||
nt|kamyk: w tym rozdaniu Szwedzi lepiej policzyli punkty:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: B-N graj¹ 14-16|pg||
nt|lechcold: musieli zatem chyba graæ 2N co najmniej...|pg||
nt|lechcold: bez politycznych konotacji plis|pg||
nt|lechcold: :)|pg||
nt|lml: and we duplicate the auction in the OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: same bidding as in the OR here|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|lml: pretty clear to make 3 except if stansby gives a trick away on a diamond lead for an overtrick|pg||
nt|jbgood: the queen of spades was lead in the OR - and the slam made|pg||
nt|boedhy:  some sort of maximum now |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they found a 44 fit|pg||
nt|skaftij:  EW CC does not reveal their escape methods|pg||
nt|bt: its not only that Qx is bad, its a minus value|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very few pairs have ability to show @D at 2-level over 1N opener|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: south is not going to make this|pg||
nt|star6ija: should be|pg||
nt|lechcold: a to nie sz³o|pg||
nt|leao:  they're way too high now|pg||
nt|sybarra: all of them! |pg||
nt|ahollan1: tarzan did NOT DBL 4@H on  9|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Iceland got to 4@h on bd 9, undoubled though|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Al you are too fast!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tarzan =  wijs-muller   sounds like name of movie's tarzan from 1930s/40s  Johnny Weissmuller|pg||
nt|szalay: who was Hungarian:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hungarian??   i know he was olympic swimmer  but didn't know heritage|pg||
nt|szalay: we know it:)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|famus: U bet--but these guys are creating same feelings in every team they've encountered so far:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Lauria lays down @hs and @cs claiming 7 tricks|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: przecie¿ nie obowi¹zuje cisza wyborcza..|pg||
nt|kamyk: stary dylemat - kontrowac takie 4@C, czy nie; raz sie sobie pomo¿e, a raz im...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  4@c they wil have agreed on|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm cerrtain 3N will make on 9 in the other room|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point! Yes, he needs the @DK set up before the clubs give a discard. |pg||
nt|runnerup: minor games are down with ruffs in other minor -if you has ny way to find such games|pg||
nt|dburn:  the English defenders had better be less afraid of clubs|pg||
nt|anton72: @d switch?....|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ryskiel_: grali 1 BA - 3 BA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Exactly as Lars predicted.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, East should see that it is the main chance of beating the contract (if no trump trick is available). |pg||
nt|bt: every now and then i find a diamond in the rough, right?|pg||
nt|barnets: west passed in open  same bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: A sensible auction.|pg||
nt|kit: Somehow that West hand just doesn't look like notrump to me.|pg||
nt|hantveit: must play spade to duck, and later take spade and play dia... hard to hold it too 9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lechcold: 3 by³o szwole¿erskie:)|pg||
nt|leao:  hard to diagnos a double now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, on occasions partner would 'come again' over 4@S.|pg||
nt|roswolf: how many hcp does 2nt show 21-22?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|boedhy:  so maximum with @s and maybe even cue|pg||
nt|boedhy:  aiiiiii....|pg||
nt|oosmanb: on same lead?|pg||
nt|antoniz: ciekawie siê zrobi³o|pg||
nt|kamyk: spójrzcie na 25. w otwartym - radosny bryd¿:)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lml: of course hearts could have behaved better|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but Brink should go on I think|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Iceland missed it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed they did'|pg||
nt|bt: without diamond king west encourages|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: góral mo¿e przynieæ niedu¿y zysk, ale czy musi?|pg||
nt|xenya: not a contract to be in when you are late|pg||
nt|barnets: dec needed 1 major suit to break to make 3n so was fortunate|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: if south had opened a strong 2@C what would have happened I wonder|pg||
nt|antoniz: czyli 2NT graæ musieli,trudno|pg||
nt|pawel90:  raczej sami bÄdziemy wistowaÄ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: can he make it?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1 NT showed 14-16 so W could have a minor jack |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south in deep thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: back in hand now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South has 2 entries to dummy in @c so will play towards @sAJ since East is known to have @SKQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and back on the table they go|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but he does not know te @c layout yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards in hand|pg||
nt|kit: exactly -- 4@S can stand some bad splits.  3NT maybe not.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: weinstein : i am not claiming but i will show you my hand loool|pg||
nt|gracelin: 20-21, with 22-23 they open 2D and rebid 2NT.  with 23+, 2C then 2NT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wild card: this contract will purely depend on a heart decision|pg||
nt|antoniz: idzie 6kier,to dobrze|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4 pasy zostaly na razie wpisane, bo w rozdaniu bylo tylko 48 kart|pg||
nt|jbgood: but in @cs always 2 club losers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: only a @C lead lets it make..|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 17 imps for Sweden|pg||
nt|garden2005: kiwki i wolnoamerykanka ... czy tak powinnimy wygrywaæ?|pg||
nt|szalay: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Weissmuller|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hiding @D2  so that @D8 is hard to read   [upside-down attitude]|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and the israeli boys in one voice: you make everything lool |pg||
nt|roswolf: ty patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D opening can also be a weak two in either major|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer doesn't know the bad trump split yet.  He's working on how to make on 3-2 break|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont think this is ever makeable i fancy -2|pg||
nt|gracelin: The other room is commentated by Italian. They must not like what's going on.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: thanks  quick scan of notes made me think 1@C or 1N with all balanced hands up to 19 HCP|pg||
nt|ady: set up the long diamon   got 4 diamonds  2 hearts and 1 spade|pg||
nt|lechcold: dwie nadróbki...dobrze ¿e m³odzie amerykañska nie popêdzi³a do szlemika kierowego|pg||
nt|ady: heart now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  A @d to dummy may risk 2@h 1S and 2@d for the defense. Declarer does not like it until he sees @c situation|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but he will play a @c to dummy|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|skaftij:  after escape method , he will infer that  @C are 4-2, west showed 4+@C-4+@H|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s6|nt|lml: I like a spade play now ... @SQ or jack|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4@c maybe after 2@c opening|pg||
nt|ady: running the 9 guaranteed 7 tricks  and in the event did not cost|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: claim and toilet break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as expected Aronov going down 2 in 4@S on  8|pg||
nt|ady: usa got 6 imps on hand 8 where Bulgaria were to high in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 6 boards   in Bermuda Bowl  Guadalupe leads Iceland by 19 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and we are back|pg||
nt|wild card: and I think it best to play the jack|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer's main line is to ruff a club and discard one on the good spade. but he also worry about D ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the ether will certainly be full of hot air tinged with woe no doubt - but they are allowed a bad set sometime:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: if you had a choice of 3@S or 4@C to splinter, 3@S looks better, as partner has more room over it|pg||
nt|lml: good play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tough for W now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|wild card: but if he plays the jack, the contract will fail, as we see|pg||
nt|wild card: N did show two aces though|pg||
nt|wild card: and if he had had a singleton hearts, he might have had a bid over 1@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo it is a pure guess.|pg||
nt|wild card: looking only at the heart position, I guess it's better to play the jack|pg||
nt|wild card: wins if south has AQx in trumps|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway, they got there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its a very good one and nothing much to the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so well done NL another derserved big plus|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play so 13 imps to the netherlands...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: very well bid by NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: really "communicating" |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Iceland have been pushed down to 6th and this won't help|pg||
nt|skaftij:  clubs is only chance - he knows D finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards stil placed on the table and thinking...|pg||
nt|garden2005: zazwyczaj taki styl reprezntuj¹ pary, ktore maja kompleks ni¿szoci i próbuj¹ w pokerka zagraæ|pg||
nt|bobholl: one more match in 15 minutes :) have fun|pg||
pc|d4|nt|leao:  Campos will try to get tricks anyway he can now :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  although if he tries to ruff a @c ... but the @c queen should bother him|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Iceland has a tough "program" for the day|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: has to play Israel in the last match this afternoon|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only needs 1 @C ruff so playing trumps safe|pg||
nt|runnerup: this was down -not any more?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the time is almost up and 6 more boards to play|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e tylko 200?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: GIB podobno nawet wygrywa|pg||
nt|roswolf: they are only mortals not gods!|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure. like 2007 against S. Africa|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: S had a difficult decision to make, and he banked on 5 hearts with N -- N could have just 4, Al?|pg||
nt|ady: same 11 tricks    a push|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: on any lead i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the director in the room|pg||
nt|xenya: so they will be penalised, which is good news for Japan, who are trailing NZ by 1VP|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: mr Slavek Latala|pg||
nt|dburn:  but this is setting up winners for declarer|pg||
pc|dK|nt|runnerup: he ruffed too high -so back to minus|pg||
nt|dburn:  not enough of them, fortunately, but...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only six|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: actually lall returned @d10 earlier|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: probably down 2|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has 7 top tricks and probably has to come to a black suit trick|pg||
nt|lml: a balck suit queen|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no entries to the dummy|pg||
nt|wild card: well done robert stephens|pg||
nt|lml: nice try to set up a heart by no luck|pg||
nt|gracelin: Even God may not be able to save Madala on this 4H :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the italian lead is only 9 and bds 23-25 have not been scored yet|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lml: Martel might rise on the club to lead a diamond through|pg||
nt|lml: makes it easier on partner|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: every team desperate to make the top 8 as we near the end of the RR|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the 1@h interference by W in the other room made it more difficult|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, Manchester City were quite happy with six yesterday |pg||
nt|anton72: i am happy for citizens too :))|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the United fans weren't..... |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: last hand  if the cards shown on the screen were correct then 10 tricks were there   north has discarded too many diamonds|pg||
nt|leao:  good news, the king is on side, but bad news is it's Kxxx|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Secured 1 down|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bt: decl needs @CK onside then east doesnt have @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: They lost another 7 on board 7|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sorry board 22|pg||
nt|gracelin: thjis culd be a huge set for China, but don't forget there are still 32 boards to go.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 38-3 to china this set after bd22 - with more imps to come|pg||
nt|roswolf: this set reminds me of the leaning tower of pisa|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: dont you like good partners like that|pg||
nt|bt: it wasnt magic, lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he is guesseing the spades because of lack of entries|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ady: better for north now to draw last trump  |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it seems|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: really Jan?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it seems so|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Iceland still more then a match away from 9th place so no real problems yet|pg||
pc|h7|nt|szalay: as we thought: he made it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gracelin: But I am sure the bet station still give higher odds for Italy to win.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I woud have led S10 instead of a club.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but italy will be grateful there are at least 2 full sets after this one|pg||
pc|sK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|szalay: sry|pg||
nt|szalay: 1 off|pg||
pc|s3|nt|antoniz: tylko -3|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but i cannot always see it, because he holds his hand on the cards|pg||
pc|s5|nt|leao:  clb now|pg||
nt|leao:  nice going, making drijver ruff pards trick|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: now can ruff the 3rd diamond|pg||
nt|skaftij:  cannot go wrong now, 5 imps to Israel|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: soon a claim coming|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so 3@h -1 |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|leao:  and then endplaying him if he doesnt ruff|pg||
nt|skaftij:  levelling the score|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: big swing for canada here since they played spades the opposite way!|pg||
nt|hantveit: must guess spades now|pg||
mc|8|nt|lechcold: tak, Cullin musia³by postawiæ na podzia³ pików by wygraæ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Bye all|pg||
