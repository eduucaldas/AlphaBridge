nt|ady: hi RV|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|rv: Roland is very prompt in updating his ranking every week, (ex) if this table finishes in less than 2 hrs, he might lose his top spot:)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: for those that dont know Netherland 14 imps is a carry over start from round robin|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|rv: good switch, still declarer rates to be favorite to score this contract|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: we agree RV|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and a solid start for Iceland whilst 2@H does presumably make|pg||
nt|rv: all k/o matches in BB are battles of attrition, QFs and SFs are over 96 brds (16x6) spread over 2 days each|pg||

nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D shows one of the major suits|pg||
nt|ady: Nortj will be very surprised its spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt=Lebensohl|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT with stiff king not usual|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Herbsts play Nat, Acol based, Major 5, better minor|pg||

nt|lml: hello|pg||
nt|lml: this auction is following the same lines as in the Open Room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it is Stansby taking a pause here|pg||
nt|lml: the trick will be the opening lead against a 6 level contract by north south|pg||
nt|panosk: gd morning to all|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT  leb   3@D direct would be forcing to game I would think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We have some huge technical problems with the PC and internet connections here in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: SORRY for that|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We are getting some technical assistance- and will try to be back very soon |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we know you are doing all you can Jan, no worries|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And the bidding on Board 18 in this room went |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@h opening from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@h (preempt)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass fromN|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pass from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: then N bid 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: going down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he took the pass card out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fallenius may cue bid 4@S|pg||
nt|hlortz: both sides can make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: a relatively peaceful hand, for starters?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  EW CC: http://tinyurl.com/66ttlf5|pg||
nt|szalay: wd u reopen as West?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bulgaria bid 6@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Round 10 and Israel are performing well while Bulgaria are lower in the table than their recent form|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the dreaded xxx opposite xxx as stopper- 3H from West should show values|pg||
nt|xenya: this may well make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|desinka: hello Panos:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@C GF relay|pg||
mb|d|nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|ady: it appears the contract n/s is 6@S    not all bid in 1 go|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: dzien dobry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Then ???  3NT - Pass???|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: @sA in hand|pg||
nt|xenya: which is likely|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR they led the @SA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and N still dont know what majorsuit S has|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lml: its fun to watch my friends play from Canada play the talented Israeli pair|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and why not?|pg||
nt|lml: do you think Stansby should double for a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|lml: is it possible to figure this out?|pg||
nt|ady: north must still think hearts south suit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lechcold: ze Szwecj¹ nigdy nie by³o ³atwo i czêciej oni nas lali ni¿ my ich...zobaczymy|pg||
nt|lechcold: witamy naszego vugrafa:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Barel chose the natural option|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is not so clear as a cue bid, not sure the intent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IMPs for Netherlands from carryover of head-to-head match in Round Robin|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: witam w kolejnym dzisiejszym meczu, ostatnim|pg||
nt|ady: 4@D down 1 on best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Bulgaria at the moment in 9th |pg||
nt|ady: must set up 2 heart tricks before clubs are established|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so they would need some VPs to get in the top 8|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: "You often have singletons opening 1nt?" asks S|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziñ dobry - witam w przedostatniej rundzie RR - dru¿yna polska spotyka siê z reprezentacj¹ Islandii|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Vladimir|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: theoretically this should go one down, 1 heart, 1 spade and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now doomed for 1 down in 5D|pg||
nt|hlortz: pass or correct type bid perhaps with 5@D in reserve if needed|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Traian|pg||
nt|hedyg:  NS CC: http://tinyurl.com/67anzfx|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 2@S is likely move now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3@C a better spot for NS.|pg||

nt|panosk: gm Dessy|pg||
nt|panosk: gm Pim|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: gm|pg||
nt|oosmanb: losing 1@H and 2@C should be very quick for sementa|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: action to start with :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   one window per table|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphznv: West: i should have passed 2@h when he puts dummy down|pg||
nt|jbgood: so that explains the double:)|pg||
nt|panosk: it was easy that will make it easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3nt could have been a bit difficult to defend against, might need to overtake @C Q and lead a @S through|pg||
nt|olegario: not much can be done, they have gone a bit too high up|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Olegario...welcome|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now the defense is easy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hi olegario :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: both sides have great fits   but both limited to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Never says W and laughs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: E agrees // we newer has .. did I have one :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphznv: declarer claiming 12 tricks -- but Versace rejects - only 11 tricks he says|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@C shows 5+ @H , 10+|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they have screamed for club lead so no chance of anything else|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, seem like a flat board to me|pg||
nt|olegario: Hello skaftij :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like a crazy double to me, getting a diamond ruff wont set 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant on its own, he does not know about partners spade ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: K@C out diamond switch and spade ace and again diamond|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: Lindop has to rise on a spade to the jack now|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS's system card: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Australia/edgtton-gosney.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a kib tells me he is only 19|pg||
nt|desinka: seems|pg||
nt|hlortz: i woud have thought south would bid 5@C 2 way bid make or cheap save|pg||
nt|hlortz: best lead!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my point was fredin does not even know one club is cashing|pg||
nt|hlortz: very true|pg||
nt|hlortz: takes @H ruffs to beat 5@C|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphznv: 4@c showed that N has a 3-5-5-0 hand and minimum|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N has described a weak 5530|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||

nt|xenya: N's decision to play 3N rather than 4@S with a 4-3-3-3 shape is understandable but quite unlucky|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  As Hedy posted earlier. http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ is the link for video|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was non-force, so Drijver 2@D either 4+ or extra values|pg||

pc|s6|nt|vugraphznv: yes:)|pg||

nt|boedhy:  can you go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Ruud|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not as they lie, but you could have on Qxx trumps offside|pg||
nt|boedhy:  you cannt draw trumps i think|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah iceland went down after two times trump|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and Iceland went down 1 in the closed room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll back Drijver to make|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|rhelle: this looks like a 1@c opening to me|pg||

nt|rv: can South won with @H6 and play 3rd @c?|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: the bid worked out well|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 3@S from north  6 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy off to amazing start winning 96 of possible 100 VPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@S gets raised without primary support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they seem to be the in form team :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North in the tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so suit not good enough for 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: lack of 3@S has made it difficult to reach the best spot|pg||
nt|star6ija: Martel has to repeat the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Chip Martel would bid 3N instead of 3@D|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 2nt 20-22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a bit unlucky  but  Drijver expected better hand from Brink -- and certainly not @HA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ady: that mey sound like a cu  agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is ok...repeating them immediately would have shown more solid colour|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- in general, 4 of a previously bid major is offer to play I believe.|pg||
nt|ady: rather than trying to show 6 card suit not shown earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now South in the tank|pg||
nt|kit: But if Stansby is thinking, then there may be some doubt|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, agree.. but now Martel's p may think abt @ds fit..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you know how Martel-Stansby treat 4th suit after jump shift?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@s is still safe double dummy I think|pg||
nt|kit: no I don't, Al|pg||
nt|panosk: looks it wont make|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The Netherlands offcourse the higher the better because then you get to pick your opps|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they end up in their best fit with good controled bidding it seems. |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Muller made 4@S on  2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|boedhy:  as we can see 4@h is close tho...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and in natural bidding you can end in @h and with 16 opposite 8 think many will be in game...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but a @h lead against 4@h is killing too|pg||
nt|alnanda: yes 4@h is posible altough hard way to make|pg||
nt|ady: that lead wont upset declarer    but any lead likely to be good for south  except maybe a low spade|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Oosman, Jan:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: of course a double by north-south would have worked well but that was hard to do|pg||

nt|andersk: Looks like down, even if he gets the sp right! |pg||
nt|andersk: EW only has to avoid dummy to get entry to the 3rd and 4th sp|pg||
nt|xenya: had N chosen to advance more slowly (5@C?), they might have stopped in 5 |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure what a double of 4@S would have been, but maybe similar to the double of 3@c earlier, saying "i want to bid on"|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think with making 3@d is a good result|pg||

nt|panosk: or maybe it will|pg||
nt|panosk: ?|pg||
nt|panosk: NS need to get a heart as well to defeat|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: wow...sweden bid and made 6d|pg||

nt|jbgood: 9-12, yes|pg||

nt|lml: well 4@S has one big advantage|pg||
nt|xenya: right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and 4@c has another - @d lead gives 2 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ron_sc2002: nice play|pg||
nt|lml: no peeking!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they know ... now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stefanov in 4@S North|pg||
nt|ady: North giving preference on 4 and 2 of diamonds instead of showing a likely 6 card suit seems where it went wrong|pg||

mb|1D|nt|athene: i would open 2@C with east's hand for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: then south might try 3@C maybe|pg||

nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S can go down while 4@H is always making|pg||
nt|athene: north must suspect that east has hearts, so why not give him a bit of a problem?|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: yes 5@C is a good save|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: west's pass showing some values I think|pg||

nt|athene: hello good morning everyone|pg||
nt|udo: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: still 2-0 -- i think it will be a record across the matches on those boards|pg||
nt|lml: I guess double makes sense with four spades and a not great club suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Italy-Netherlands 0-25 on the same 2 boards|pg||

mb|4S|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=limit raise or better   2N=strong NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: it is maybe inverted minor and 2N showing 15-17?|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: even without being a convention it suggests that kind of hand|pg||
nt|xenya: more realistic|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West dbls 3@D now, but director tells them to wait for safety|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Well, we will find ou later how 3nT was made erhaps duck a @d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Lars|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south just hopes his partner doesn't do anything uncooperative, like bidding clubs :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1N 18-20|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D is a spade raise- exactly what this promises varies from partnership to partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East doesn't accept|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so bidding is as displayed, only North doesn't see it yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pushed to North now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North has to decide the final contract now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does 4@H need @s guess or no?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1H showing @ss|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Wijs did not enter with @h bid on bd3, allowing Einarsson to support with 2@s iso 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and tends to be bad hand for slam|pg||
nt|stoffers: some might bid 2@d on Duboins hand here, me included. He may regret it now when partner leads clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Same lead in the OR.|pg||
nt|wild card: hi|pg||
nt|wild card: this looks like a makebale contract|pg||
nt|wild card: *makeable|pg||
nt|lml: this may work out well for Israel|pg||
nt|lml: pretty aggressive bidding by this team so far|pg||
nt|xenya: and how|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR Weinstein overcalled 2@C instead of doubling|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict some 14 imps to Israel on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: MArtel has found a book|pg||
nt|lml: its a style thing but the club suit looks pretty weak to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and has started reading in it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't pass, but the tray wa spushed to the North side already|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and North bid already and SW saw it when the tray was pulled back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director walked away, i Didn't hear his ruling..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Tray is at WestSouth side now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Think director went to get some help|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nd director here: they said it's more complicated|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the meantime i go for a coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Norths 3@S is treated is as a bid of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: without screens|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East can accept 3@S or let the tray go back to Fredin|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East asking what the total consequences ar|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west passes, north bids 3@s and auction proceeds as normal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west doesn't pass, then if north bid @S's (at any lvl) south has to pass 1 round|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: If west doesn't pass and North bids something else than @S south should pass the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|andersk: interesting 4@H here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: 4@C isn't giving east any problem|pg||
nt|lml: he liked the stiff spade and the club fit|pg||
nt|lml: so will south cuebid the @HK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=shortness|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so were back now..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And we are back live now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and first imps for iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Board 18 was a 4@c down 2 in N|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well done Jan and thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a 4@s making on board 19|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes well done Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Now we are LIVE again - and 2nt showed a 3 or 4 card @s support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice to see some totally natural bidding :)|pg||
nt|xenya: so Sweden are off to a flying start in this match -- very important for them  as they are currently 9th, closely followed by Australia and Japan |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ashley in the tank now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Muller did bid @H:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  5 @s is not easy to make without a @c lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|boedhy:  think this will go down so 8 imps or so to iceland|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and thanks 350 specs for hanging in there with us :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a great start for the "hometeam" |pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes and an important match it is. |pg||
pc|dK|nt|star6ija: Trendafilov will attack hearts now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is asking questions at moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW lead 2nd/4th against suit and nt     upside down signals focusing on count|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so we have to wait and see|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds 3-2  and hearts 4-4   this should roll home|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say, @D to the Ace, small @D ruff, small @S to the Ace and another @D ruff, @S to J and @D ruff and @SK. Do we get to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I cant see the title of it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South annoyed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  there is.....|pg||
nt|boedhy:  strange bidding form south 2@c round forcing|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bulgaria scored 10 on the slam hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: he would rather have seen a redouble:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South to toilet now|pg||
nt|bt: thanks martin|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello Lars yes sweden has picked up a few so far|pg||
nt|xenya: 8 teams qualify for the quarterfinals -- and this is the last round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similiar situation here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: here the KJ of clubs are waste paper- |pg||
nt|boedhy:  if you end up 4th you will get the best team form 5-8 as opponent for instance USA1|pg||
nt|bt: so on the pedestrian heart lead decl has 8 tricks, now he has 9|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another potential good board for sweden|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|ady: safer toclear last trump so run of diamonds could not be interupted|pg||
nt|rhelle: it will be hard for NS to reach 4@h after a 1@c opening|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: y very safe play|pg||
nt|rv: US, Italy, Great Britain, France, Brazil, Iceland, Dutch, Norway are only countries to have won Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|rhelle: very good result for NS in the other room|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S!|nt|rhelle: 1@s = 0-5 points, and denies 4+ @s|pg||
nt|ady: just 3 spade losers in 4@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: must W bid here?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rhelle: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: X would have shown 0-5 and 4+@s|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: 19-34|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||

nt|rhelle: he is vulnerable, of course |pg||
mc|10|nt|rhelle: with a 4333 distribution|pg||
nt|rv: on strong 1M O/C over strong @c, many play 2n as good raise since cue bid is not available|pg||

nt|athene: bocchi-madala play quite an active game so i would not be surprised if bocchi bids 5@C in that same position|pg||
nt|athene: a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|kemperg: seeing bears on the road|pg||
nt|lechcold: atak atutowy spod trzeciej dziesi¹tki winien zasugerowaæ Martensowi, ¿e w innych kolorach Upmark ma niewygodne do wistu konfiguracje|pg||
nt|lechcold: tak mi sie wydaje|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not any more -the early club play usually indicates a singleton - else declarer would try to find out more before guessing club|pg||
nt|lml: so 2NT goes doen 2 both ways|pg||
nt|xenya: just 12 imps -- well played by Stansby|pg||
nt|lml: curious hand says oscar the owl|pg||
nt|boedhy:  starnge bidding tho|pg||
nt|ady: might make 4@S on last hand   but unlikely contract|pg||
nt|boedhy:  thought the 4-1 was too much but the @h lead helped a lot|pg||
nt|boedhy:  just loosing two imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now everyone has got the heat up -- also the operator :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: preetty amazing to hold it to -2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now we hope to calm down a little |pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h quickly beaten on a @s ruff in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what a start for sweden|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 5@C bid would win 4 imps and maybe more if EW will bid to the 5 level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14|pg||
nt|wild card: on fleisher's line of play, he would probably only have succeeded if spades were 3/2|pg||
nt|lechcold: porz¹dne by³y..bez @H9 by³aby tu masakra:)|pg||
nt|pawel90:  moim zdaniem trzeba kontrowaÄ z rÄkÄ Jacka.|pg||

nt|szalay: good fitting 4@H|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: analezienie trefli jest bardzo trudne nawet przy posiadaniu ich w liczbie 9 na osi, bo otwierajacy maj¹c s³abe otwarcie powie 2@s a nie ¿adne 3@c|pg||
nt|jbgood: 8-11 "weak" 2s|pg||
nt|boedhy:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl  the WBF site is offline but here you can find the scores too|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Brink Drijver play transfer is the sitaution on board 20 so something else went wrong|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4@S |pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|bt: on a heart lead he has some work to do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when you suit is running bid 3nt, dont worry much about stoppers or where 9th trick will come from|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I just love watching these competitive auctions, with world class players making the decisions.|pg||
nt|bt: i assume decl got a diamond lead at the other table here and gave up on the heart finesse, lall doesnt believe much in finesses we already know|pg||
nt|brolucius: It doesn't actually improve my own success at such decisions, but I kid myself that it does.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: podpowiadaj¹, ¿e z omawianego meczu w Yokohamie tu wystêpuje jeszcze dwóch zawodników  Baldursson i Gawry|pg||

nt|pawel90:  je=kara|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the jack of spades was just revealed - now all E-W have to do is reach 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: good start for Iceland|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: 2@s+5@ss+4@cs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 7-10hcp|pg||
nt|kemperg: should fear a ruff|pg||
nt|wild card: or 4/1 with the 4card with the 3 trumps|pg||
nt|lml: seldom right for a team to play 2NT in both directions|pg||
nt|jbgood: they also use 2@d for the real garbage|pg||
nt|panosk: NS have a minor slam EW will compete |pg||
nt|bt: 4@S might have worked better here, but 1@S is normal|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is the modern style to overcall 1@S rather than 4@S.|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes now a slam again and this is over |pg||
nt|jbennet: thsi is a board where again science takes the pot.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS=a) 0-4 HCP  b) PEN|pg||
nt|skaftij:  running scores BB|pg||

nt|bobholl: nice position @D K :)|pg||
nt|szalay: always tough to bid game after 1@C (strong)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lml: in the Open Room they did start with a weak 2 using multi ... that may have made it a bit harder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S were 3/2, you mean @Hs.|pg||
nt|boedhy:  3crd support|pg||
nt|oosmanb: moderately straight forward hands so far, and almost all the tables playing v fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: is he thinking for 6 go to 7 or just pass?|pg||
nt|panosk: *6@D|pg||
nt|panosk: intersting views from kibs coming in |pg||
nt|panosk: i agree it seems N doesnt 1st round control in spades else wud have bid 5@S|pg||

nt|brolucius: 2@S shows a sound heart raise.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The double shows some spade support (or a doubleton honor) but denies the values to bid 3@S.|pg||
nt|hlortz: and theres always the guilty pleasure in seeing others go wrong - gives us hope :)|pg||
nt|bt: now fallenius should get diamonds in there to involve partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@D now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has a great fit for both red suits, as you see.|pg||
nt|bt: luckily for sweden fallenius would normally, only god knows what fredin would do with that hand|pg||
nt|bt: not even god actually|pg||
nt|bt: fredin has a great mind but for us mortals its hard to understand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if they bid this slam i will say again..woooow|pg||
nt|jbennet: 3h probably some sort of semi fit in spades. a hand unsuitable to rebid 2 NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 25hcp|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @d better than 4 @s -if you loose  one @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = good raise of @H|pg||
nt|xenya: will they get to 4? I'm not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs use 1N as the "cue"|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ron_sc2002: 2@C is both majors by E|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi David welcome|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning David|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to hear 5D now|pg||
nt|ady: Italians got to 5@D   and guessed the J@S   after the same take-out double from south|pg||
nt|ady: thx    good morning all|pg||
nt|panosk: also clubs beter in case a club ruff |pg||
nt|boedhy:  2NT looks natural tho and that is imo strange but absolutely Brink like....|pg||
nt|ady: request for link  for scores please|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: duboin giving his partner quite a bit of leeway for 2@C at favourable|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 2@H is a fine contract|pg||
nt|lml: lots of tricks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 2/3@S|pg||
nt|bt: now fredin gets no help deciding, thats the problem w 4@H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: more than 13|pg||
nt|lml: on the finesses|pg||
nt|wild card: I mean if hearts were 3/2 and spades 4/1 he would have also gone down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|garden2005: zdaje siê, ¿e matematyczna lekko wiêksza szansa zawiod³a (> o @dJx)|pg||

nt|panosk: thx for ur insight|pg||
nt|boedhy:  3@d|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: but his @DQJ are not going to be much use facing shortage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv:  running scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|boedhy:  3@s|pg||
nt|boedhy:  all pass|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you are WAY AHEAD of the players :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  trying to make up for my last prediction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Duboin thinking now|pg||
nt|andersk: I wonder if 3 @S would be stronger than 4 in this auction?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South worth a move|pg||
nt|ahollan1: likes 4@H & @D filler  but 4333 slows down Drijver|pg||
nt|szalay: rdbl|pg||
mb|r|nt|ady: likely 11 tricks with nice lay of diamonds and spade split|pg||
nt|stoffers: Einarson with a huge hand after whats shown here, i would rather bid 3@s than 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: noticed Zack 's 3@D     presumeable at that point weaker than pass?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can he read the 5 he should|pg||
nt|jbennet: west will rule out 3NT as a playable spot. |pg||
nt|xenya: with NS silent. bidding this slam would have been a real feat|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ola Rimstedt let me know that in the open room they play 6d|pg||
nt|runnerup: if you dont loose any @d -you make 6 -but here -important to loose no @d -whenr you are short of trumps also |pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder how many tables will reach it -- not too many i think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so may be the kiwis can take some badly needed imps back|pg||
nt|szalay: cheap and effective|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Johnsson helping NS get back into game exploration|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@C-3@H-4@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: ns still don't know the bad @S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: with 33 HCP most pairs should reach a slam somewhere|pg||
nt|lml: maybe all|pg||
nt|antoniz: po kierowym lub treflowym -1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this will make for sure - South would love to withdraw his take out double|pg||
nt|skaftij:  this will be 15 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|skaftij:  14|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: definetly imps for the kiwis|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and the night is still young for them -- there will be other opportunities no doubt|pg||
nt|runnerup: there is a way to put a @d loose away so take care of @h by dummys trumps -but now -after @c lead there is no way to go down |pg||
nt|xenya: now, of course, EW may find a save in @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @S only 3 losers    and  that's ok in 4@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  costs 500|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ryskiel_: zreszt¹ jak oceni³ Gawry kontrê Kality to ja wiem ale nie powiem|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for a quick 1 off..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well we knew this was coming, if i bid 4@H my intent is to pull any doubles|pg||
nt|bt: i think fallenius could have done better here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: needing a club finesse you really dont want to be in the grand but ...|pg||
nt|ady: nice cheap trick to begin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yet to see a routine game hand:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: so no double - and a small win for Sweden|pg||
nt|panosk: club ruff if in diamonds that is|pg||
nt|ady: e/w taken the non vul save|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yeah|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you were right :)|pg||
nt|bt: you have to make your mind up if you want to involve partner or do guesswork, sometimes informative bids helps opponents also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice bid showing @D help|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@d suits brink|pg||
nt|szalay: no more time to bid it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|xenya: Martel's pass shows equal length in the majors |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and 3@H got it in the OR|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, North doubled 5@d and South pulled to 5 @H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  That went to East wko bid the par contract, 6@d|pg||
nt|skaftij:  North then bid 6@h, certainly reasonable |pg||
mb|p|nt|antoniz: sk¹d znam ten tekst?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: z autopsji Antoni z autopsji:)|pg||
nt|antoniz: :):)|pg||
nt|ady: notice 3nt slipped through in OR|pg||
nt|panosk: gd call|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 7 imps to Sweeden|pg||
nt|oosmanb: switch to @D probably, looks like only chance |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so south knows they are off the @CQ from the keycard response|pg||
nt|udo: @D discard?|pg||
nt|lml: this looks like at least a small pickup for USA|pg||
nt|szalay: wd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i think @CA undisclosed   Brink gets to game, but maybe Drijver should have bid it|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|stoffers: But, bad splits and game not making today- quite lucky for him|pg||
nt|ady: best defence down 3   but 4@H should make|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bt: 4@D is good if its your contract and gets partner involved, it was on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can someone please give me the running scores link|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver hand did NOT have to be this pure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: as expected, bocchi bid 5@C and reaped a large reward|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lml: the canadians were a bit lucky|pg||
nt|lml: 6NT by north can go down if the spade and clubs are offside|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely ruff and would bank on @D finesse, whick is correct.|pg||
nt|ady: in fact sorry this is down 2|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have the club pips to restrick to 1 loser|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: from south 6@C is better |pg||
nt|lml: with the @SQ protected|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North had a chance to double 2C but resisted - |pg||
nt|xenya: -1 on the lead?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think 3@s will make also|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ron_sc2002: well done by bocchi|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not anymore|pg||

pc|hA|nt|lechcold: nie jestem pewien czy ta szansa by³a wiêksza...bior¹c pod uwagê przes³anki wynikaj¹ce z pierwszego wistu|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wd.|pg||
nt|ady: no take out double in OR   and 2@C response from west   system bid  I would think   then eventually 3NT    low spade lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed me too another 7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: if he plays a trump now, the roof comes in; south just draws trumps|pg||
nt|lechcold: tak czy siak -12|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ron_sc2002: and the defence made the same to beat 5@H|pg||
nt|ady: however entries are scarce  so still may be down 3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jbgood: N showing confidence in prd's discards|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lml: as the cards lie of course nothing can hurt a grand|pg||
nt|jbennet: think west is thinking of guarding agaist sp 5-1. (if they were then winning the lead in dummy had been fatal).|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: but roofs coming in hurt less when it's just 50s :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: ka¿dy pisze i myli to co mu siê wydaje, analizy musz¹ byæ szybkie ... mo¿na czasem sie pomyliæ :) nie upieram siê, ze mam racjê|pg||
nt|lml: I think so|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|udo: should be only 1 more trick for versace|pg||
nt|ady: setting up a 3rd diamond trick in case spades break badly|pg||
nt|ady: if east eventually enters with 3rd round of spades to west hand and runs J@C   south can win and playQ@d  sett up the 10  but no good to east who has 4 clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lechcold: ja te¿:)|pg||
nt|ady: sorry there was a take-out dbl|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|odysseus69: going through the motions but we all know how it is going to end|pg||
nt|jkotor: cos szkodzi grac atu na oddanie waleta?|pg||
nt|jkotor: sorry, priv|pg||
nt|lml: unless somehow Stansby can engineer an endplay on south|pg||
nt|xenya: the defence might slip though|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so 2 imps for the netherlands|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no well still OK for NL|pg||
pc|dK|nt|stoffers: USA 21-0 vs sweden after 5, here no swing at all|pg||
nt|lml: if north doesnt play a spade|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: looks a push|pg||
nt|stoffers: vs Chile, sry|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lechcold: Joe rozgrywa wspaniale jak do tej pory|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: south will score the @D7 at trick 13 too|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is possible now|pg||

pc|c5|nt|lechcold: Justin:)|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: also S could say again else than pass imo|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, I think South is the main culprit here|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: a fighting partscore board here: a lot can happen|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = good 12 - 15|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: 4--3-3-3   2@H seemed ok     maybe a try of 3@D from south|pg||
nt|rhelle: they pass bad balanced 12-counts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: N in action to show 2M|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rv: ubiquitous landy will make an apperance here|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: 2nt W?|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ady: X take-out|pg||
nt|rv: 2n could be scrambling here|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: natural 2NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: I think 2NT would be lebensohl, showing a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 2@S was the last positive score for Dutch|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: no alerts|pg||
nt|ady: with 1 suiter could just bid suit    passed 1NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: so 2NT is showing a balanced Max|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|jaapfr vg: DD 3@D can make but SD?/|pg||
nt|rv: Muller will possibly score 7 tricks here|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is complicated - wouldn't like to play it or make predictions on the outcome|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: my line would be @SA direct and @C developing|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: with regard to the 2@C bid N|pg||
nt|ady: clubs coming in for 3 tricks   but still looks a trick short    but may still be 3 imps to Netherlands|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: thinking @S very probably 4-4|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: hope Muller agrees though:)|pg||

nt|rv: once North shows 54 in majors and 3@cs, only hope is stiff @d honor with North|pg||

nt|stoffers: F5 for refreshing|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ale roznie zapiszê bo ciekawe|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes South doubled 1D in OR- even you and I would have doubled David - old and conservative as we are|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|lml: Stansby took a reasonable shot single dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ginossar asks if its possible to play a little faster|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: almost played one hour and only 5 boards completed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and with 5@c going down good result i think for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Last night I spoke with the icelandic pair in this room for some time|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they had a testmatch some time ago against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and did they tell anything interesting..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and was beaten quiet heavily|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another fast one|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe the will get an early dinner today:)|pg||
nt|bt: i get lots of messages but i cant comment on all, but i try :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: any rubber bridge players out there??|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: well, north threw a trick, yes|pg||
nt|athene: he could have kept @DJ and the heart winner|pg||
nt|famus: Hi all|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: rozdanie of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if south had ventured 2nt over 2@H that might have pushed EW into 3@H-1, but it was a bit hard with a 3 count|pg||
nt|antoniz: wietne szkoleniowo|pg||
nt|ady: problem for north  if he does double 2@C   then they will reach the making game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6D doomed but where will this end?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 2NT maybe is a fit-inv|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi overcalled 1@H as expected|pg||
nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
nt|ady: possible to get overboard   but 6@D should fail|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, I was disconnected and missed that competitive auction. I will look at it via the MOVIE button.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|udo: 2NT transfer @C ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: transfer to @C.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I would call the north hand a mixed raise ... 2@D suggests a limit raise to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt = @h fit|pg||
nt|udo: looks like:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: invitational values|pg||
nt|udo: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: explained from Versace to Masood|pg||
nt|ady: around 1NT  loooks likely|pg||
nt|wild card: what's the range of 1NT?|pg||
nt|lechcold: wejcie hmhmhm...graniczne:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some play that 4D =D and H|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that Fallenius failed to take Lars' advice and show his second suit - paying the price.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@c = majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: yes, uncontested 1@H-2NT is limit with 3 or 4 cards; clearly a raise here too|pg||
nt|lml: its pretty close between the two choices|pg||
nt|famus: Hello Udo & William|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N=12-14 EXCEPT  3rd seat vul = 15-17|pg||
nt|wild card: thx|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but not here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North said "content"|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: more spades from west|pg||
nt|lml: a lot more it appears|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hello all|pg||
nt|stoffers: Rising with King best now|pg||
nt|stoffers: Hi there Denmark :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sort of :-)|pg||
nt|ady: off beat pre-empt has caused havoc|pg||
nt|runnerup: here also a nt game sits|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no ok   north likely considered his hand to flat to look for anythin more than game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1nt opening is 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but maybe N didnt like his distribution 3343|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and just bid 3nt|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ron_sc2002: Pass is clearly forcing in this situation|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: E with 6-5 will bid again|pg||
nt|ady: I meant for n/s   but e/w got there first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  And in that board we see the other site of Brink bidding a daring 5@c drove the opps to high|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are a very good pair never the less|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they are pleased with the way there are playing in the tournament so far ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so the Iceland team knew this would be a VERY VERY difficult match|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: why not 3@C instead of 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: = and so far they were absolutely right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Skaftij types faster|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door North expressed his happiness|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 2 down after perfect defense (2 club ruffs) will lose an imp for Sweden|pg||
nt|bt: well commentators all of us suggested @D bids, but he is the one playing the world championships so ...|pg||
nt|andyv:  1     ITALY  3582   NETHERLANDS 342    USA 2 3424   ISRAEL 314.35   USA 1 310.56   ICELAND 308.57   NEW ZEALAND 2998   CHINA 295.5|pg||
mb|3D|nt|famus: has to sac|pg||
nt|athene: versace's pass over 5@S clearly encouraging his partner to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N has bid 6@s|pg||
nt|udo: sacrifice is successfull, but not so clear for me|pg||
nt|famus: EW different league--to say the least!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now Lauria thinking again|pg||
nt|udo: if he bids 6 @S,,wd|pg||
nt|star6ija: complicate decision for Martel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Aronov will open 1N and Stefanov will bid  so  nobody stopping in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like..he is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D down 1    but difficulty for north to do anything|pg||
nt|star6ija: no...Stefanov will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- does DBL now show 2@D?|pg||
nt|star6ija: they play 14-16 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|jbgood: Bermuda Bowl running scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|ady: 14-16 no-trump I am told so even more reason for north to just go to game|pg||
nt|brolucius: Always a good idea to bid NT as soon as possible with a balanced hand. Here North rebids 1NT to show 11-14.|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks like a normal 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: this should be another fast board for makeing maximum partscoore|pg||
nt|hlortz: good result ew in OR here |pg||
nt|xenya: EW in trouble now|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: I expected this bid|pg||
nt|xenya: a club lead beats 4@S...|pg||
nt|lml: I am going to guess that this hand wont be played that quickly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when opponents have the ranking suit, show your second suit, when they dont is less important|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Only lived in Denmark last 31 years, being an Icelander|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well i think you want to be in 4@h with such strong @h|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a lot of bidding by EW, but this will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N scramble?   i.e. no preference|pg||
nt|szalay: sure|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: 3 clubs a possibilty   but not obvious for north with small values|pg||
nt|lml: North-south can set up a diamond for a club pitch now|pg||
nt|xenya: but naturally enough, a @D has been lead|pg||
nt|lml: Just to make it clear to a few who asked.  On a club lead you win the club and you cant set up diamonds fast enough|pg||
nt|lml: east-west keep leading clubs and will set up a trick before you can get a diamond discard going|pg||
nt|lml: on any other lead north-south can play diamonds first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s lead|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will make this |pg||
nt|boedhy:  the @h are also helpfull in 3nt offcourse|pg||
nt|boedhy:  1@s 4@h 2 in each minor|pg||
nt|runnerup: little under point -but makes like it is -something to play and bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|udo: parscore reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: he cannot afford to leave opps here as far as 2@d could be made as well as 3@cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct   Aronov-Stefanov NT=14-16|pg||
nt|antoniz: +1 imp|pg||
nt|lml: a diamond lead makes it a piece of cake :0|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4@h-3  in board 5?? Might be entered wrong|pg||
nt|bt: in the open room grue was very aggressive and paid a heavy price|pg||
nt|brolucius: The top 8 teams in the round-robin, at end of play tonight, will enter the quarter-finals of the knock-out stage.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|famus: wd--wonder whether the other room wud b pushed to limits|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be hard to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: ok, might be harder now|pg||
nt|athene: lauria doesn't know his partner has quite so many clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry lost connection|pg||
nt|ady: taken the plunge     looks like 2 spade trricks and 2 diamonds     |pg||
nt|panosk: still talking about last hand privately sorry :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lml: Baxter is heading to dummy for a diamond pictch on the heart  and a spade play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exactly!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so he does not have to take the @d decision|pg||
nt|lml: there may be a trump promotion on a diamond play now |pg||
nt|stoffers: Ah, nice|pg||
nt|lechcold: 11 lew jeli rozegramy kara przed kierami (konieczne z uwagi na blokadê kar)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: live scores back thanfully, see all matches here http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|runnerup: entryes are difficult |pg||

pc|dT|nt|boedhy:  will make this |pg||
nt|boedhy:  still not working on my mac..|pg||
nt|brolucius: The team cominb 1st can choose their opponents from those 5-8. The team coming second has the next choice, etc...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: creative lead by Cornell|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: but still i think @DK shift is ok|pg||
nt|athene: if the @CQ got covered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe it will be 1N in the other room|pg||
nt|xenya: S had better duck this and see what happens|pg||
pc|d4|nt|boedhy:  but with the @h 4-1 you better not be in 3..|pg||
nt|boedhy:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I thought that would be flat at all 60+ tables|pg||

nt|odysseus69: what action over 3S? double or 4H?|pg||
nt|ady: would you not prefer double  than 4@H Victor  and then possibly bid  diamonds if partner responds clubs?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzer rightly suggests that West should think again when 4H is doubled|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this works on my computer|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a cunning low @s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are 4th, you usually find yourself with some stiff opponents that none of the other top 4 wanted to face.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bt: this is a soft result by ew but bidding game and making it was not in the cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Can someone post the web-address for the ruinning scores?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|skaftij:  nope|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: @CK asked for count there i would imagine|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Should make comfortably|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to go wrong in defense - but Fallenius thought it through|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, will just make now|pg||
nt|ady: that at least gives a chance of reaching a good spot   or possibly 3@SX|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont think so, I looked at bidding and it seemes like Fredin Falleinus had a misunderstanding!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oops|pg||
nt|jbennet: DD 3NT unbeatable.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but east doesnt know it. |pg||
nt|runnerup: east is worried that 1s are not 3-3 .that is one problems out of fju|pg||
nt|jbennet: awkward communication problems. |pg||
nt|jbennet: east doestn know that NS is unable to take 3 d tricks.|pg||
nt|jbennet: west..|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- if he cashes @CK now and crosses to @SQ to take two clubs, what will he discard from dummy? |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they made in the open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was he supposed to start @C firsr?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: they play upside down|pg||
nt|ady: might make an overtrrick as it has gone|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well for declarer |pg||
nt|lechcold: jak mi siê zdaje, Kalita móg³ po³o¿yæ graj¹c kiera w lewie drugiej!! to dlatego, ¿e N mia³ za mocne kiery:)) ale to by³oby zagranie dla nadcz³owieka|pg||

nt|bt: we have 5 teams battling for last two spots|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks to the kibs who sent me the link.|pg||
nt|xenya: so this appears to be a poor line|pg||
nt|jbennet: if he cashes club ace and enters hanf with sp Q then no make.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|lml: so no problems now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes prefer double but I have become modern??? and play 4D=D and H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lml: it is terribly hard to see that a diamond would help from the south hand|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has a chance to make it even if south ducks the club as many you suggest|pg||
nt|lml: but probably wont|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: small @d lead would have been great by N|pg||
nt|lml: baxter can throw a club on the heart and guess diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is now a push|pg||
pc|c2|nt|boedhy:  @d back costs a trick|pg||
nt|jbennet: good shot so far .|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wild card: in the other room, west raised his partner to 3NT immediately|pg||
nt|wild card: a good bid in my opinion although we can see 3NT won't make on this board|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: now declarer "knows" @Ds are 3-3|pg||
nt|panosk: E will be worried momentarily about a @D ruff but he soon be relieved|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: New Zealand are the only real surprise in the top 8 at the moment. Well done to them.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|star6ija: first blood US, unless Aronov steal 8th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but with the @s with open is understandable otherwise you can see the 4 @h in hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|famus: so they get the max|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kamyk: @D D nie nowinna byæ w pe³ni liczona przy ocenie, czy mamy na inwit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tap tap |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: can bring down K@H in 3   but cant play a spade from north at the same time|pg||
nt|stoffers: and if declearer had the T@s Sementa would have been squeezed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|ady: that would solve the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D9 looming large|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Baldursson can survive en passant|pg||
nt|skaftij:  even if spade tap|pg||
pc|h3|nt|stoffers: check that score operator|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he claimed down 1 , saying sorry for misplaying @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: for now i dont say anything...|pg||
nt|stoffers: oh, wrong claim|pg||
nt|stoffers: correct|pg||
nt|boedhy:  9 tricks at the end|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that site works folks so use it instead of the official|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbennet: he might try heart Q after the spades.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|skaftij:  ah|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|jbennet: if so then South ducks and then ducks again on the 2nd heart|pg||
nt|xenya: @DK now for -2 |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Would Drijver think for a while with Queen?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: spade favourate now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  probably same result at the other table....Muller playing?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|jbennet: if north discards a D|pg||
nt|xenya: tap tap|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bt: they deftly added a norwegian, but isnt NZ focus elsewhere this morning?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||

nt|xenya: any clue here?|pg||

nt|runnerup: spades must be handled -by odds ,but @h must be ducked once -and then you have chances|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: ok, some cunning system :)|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they play some convention here..but they will end in 4@S|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: I am not really sure what 2@D is maybe forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am recording the rugby, so no scores, please.|pg||
nt|bt: and grue lall decided 7@C was good here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - since N had no entry to give prd a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Ah de Wijs made an uptrick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they in NT also 1 imp|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looking at that scoreboard the first 6 temas are pretty save..|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes N 5@d doubled|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||
nt|lml: seems like we have found the actual auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now for east; what shall he do with 1@s bid in N?|pg||
nt|lml: still should east bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking.......by E|pg||
nt|wild card: the four diamonds in the north hand make it liekly for partner to be short|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and you can see why in these 6 boards|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: przy okazji wyg³osi³em pogl¹d (nie do zrealizowania), ¿e cz³owiek najpierw powinien byæ dziadkiem  a dopiero potem ojcem |pg||
nt|garden2005: dzieñ dobry wszystkim :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: four spades is not too far off actually|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AQ@C and @S Ace nicely placed. Key cards for the contract.|pg||
nt|jbgood: brb|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a @s lead did nothing to embarass declarer|pg||
nt|bt: aha rugby is tomorrow, the nz team hopes for bridge and rugby at that time|pg||
nt|xenya: another opportunity for NZ?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||
nt|lml: not surprised east thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
nt|antoniz: czeæ Grzesiu:)|pg||
nt|jbennet: is 4 sp really makeable against best defence??|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
nt|ady: unsafe balance for north in my opinion|pg||
nt|xenya: at last an easy hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like south bid 4N as to play|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah there is some low level bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, it's tomorrow.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, we are away for the week-end and I set the recorder.|pg||
nt|garden2005: mamy potencja³ i naboje?|pg||
nt|runnerup: now @h possition is clear -so helps to play|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: east I feel only woth an invite opposite    but west would have accepted|pg||
nt|ady: is this also 14-16 no-trump Jan ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 15-17|pg||
nt|oosmanb: board 6 has some interesting auctions at other tables|pg||
nt|andersk: Better cash he's 6 tricks, If he looses a club trick early he might go 4 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems to North that his @s will not be pulling weight|pg||
nt|garden2005: no jak teraz @h? siê czuj¹|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tak Grzesiu...niestety naboje co drugi lepy|pg||
nt|kamyk: chyba nieporozumienie: Gawrys przyj¹³, ¿e 3BA, to m³ode|pg||

mb|p|nt|star6ija: the law of the total trumps :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 trumps for NS...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm, can you concede tricks that you cannot possibly loose?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he wrote -100|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Don't know the law too well|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nor really, but operator or players watching arent to say anything |pg||
nt|xenya: you can make 6 here -- but you don't want to be there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  aggresive but controled bidding,  combined with perfect play and some luck :)|pg||
nt|ady: thx   15-17   but even so vould be facing a poor heart holding   west has a nice toppy hand with good hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: Hi David and Lars! I can assure you that the kiwi team has the right focus on today's matches:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seven would have been fine if south had diamond ace rather than KQ|pg||
nt|bt: how did england do? wales was 4th i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|skaftij:  but...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  4 imps to Iceland probably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then is thin though with only 8 trumps|pg||
nt|brolucius: The text-books advise you not to bid a grand if there is any chance that the other room will miss the small slam. They also have some advice (I forget it at the moment) about how ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: many aces you need for a grand slam.|pg||
nt|garden2005: w ocenie od zg³aszaj¹cych mi na priv Kibiców, Gawry nie mai³ na 5@d|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -partscore board ?|pg||
nt|jbennet: how is 4sp makeable?? |pg||
nt|skaftij:  1@c Relay Precision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D looks like a checkback |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sry|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphznv: Duboin picked 3 times the 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|famus: can he hit @cs?|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW play sound 1 openings|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2NT ask and Alfredo now bid 3NT, max no shortness|pg||
nt|lechcold: po tym ataku no problem|pg||
nt|odysseus69: notice that Zack did not get carried away and bid only 3S where others might have bid game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West trying to speed up, they are 2 boards behind|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South sorry, think for being slow|pg||
nt|bt: anyway i think lall bid way too much at the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think it has come up yet   EW  1st discard = odd/even|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW leads  2nd/4th|pg||
pc|cA|nt|stoffers: If one of the pairs finds out they will ofcource correct the score|pg||

nt|boedhy:  NS can make 3@c tho|pg||
nt|xenya: well N had passed over 3@S -- no reason to be clever now i think|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see the other auction by putting your cursor over the Open Room result.|pg||
nt|bt: unless their firm agreement is that 5NT in all auctions is "pick a slam"|pg||
nt|runnerup: you lose 1 @s -1 @h -throw one to @c k -and 1 @c ofcause|pg||
nt|xenya: especially as he should know @Hs are likely to be 3-3 for his side|pg||
pc|s2|nt|famus: a natural @s lead -wont get them anywhere|pg||
nt|ady: if this lead is from length the 9@C will ensure only 2 club losers  so the game depends on A@D right|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphznv: 3@H = 15+  5-5 , rest goes without saying|pg||
nt|stoffers: Duboin knowing about a diamondlooser now (no 4@d)|pg||
nt|lechcold: bardzo trafny rebid Gawrysia|pg||
nt|kamyk: gdyby Gawrys powiedzia³ zwyczajnie 2@D, to co sie licytuje z kart¹ E? Mówi¹c 1BA uproci³ rozdanie.|pg||
nt|ady: tricky defence here|pg||
nt|ady: need to win A@S   andplay 9@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 9 tricks whatever defence does- cant get club ruff and 2 heart tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  alot of comment on this remark.|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  can't win this without help from defense|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: protecting the @DK on the lead doesn't really help EW any|pg||
nt|jbennet: even if taking right view in spades and hearts no way to handle the 2nd heart loser. |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czy Volva produkowane pzrez Szwedów s¹ te¿ sztuczn¹ metod¹ robione?|pg||
nt|jbgood: may be a double game swing if he takes the heart finesse and finds the trump|pg||
nt|bt: anyway the ns auction at the other table was one of those toughies and they failed, it is good for my team so i am happy|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tylko nie w pika|pg||

pc|sK|nt|lml: once south plays the clubs he now knows he has the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well spotted David|pg||
nt|ady: got the first bit right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might well find H9|pg||
nt|ady: still not that great a game even with a suitable hand with west|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: games that win are good games :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Here North was able to ask for key cards, so there was no problem. Sweden gained advantage from their spade pre-emption at the other table.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: for example if partner has the @DA and you need to set up a spade and have declarer misguess diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moysian fit = 4-3   is this Mini-Moysian  or is that 4-2 fit|pg||
pc|s7|nt|famus: wud he duck???|pg||
nt|ady: 1 trump out of the way|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|stoffers: 6 (lucky) imps to Iceland on bd21, they take what they get against opponents like this|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think i wouldnt have passed with north although i opened light|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: nowhere to put the diamond losers anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find that duck|pg||
nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|kemperg: he knows @CA with partner, so @DA on leader|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ju¿ wiem ¿e Volvo produkuje siê teraz w Chinach, wiec na pewno sztucznie|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: on  6 the auction was 1N-all pass|pg||
nt|star6ija: Karaivanov would be surprized realizing that Trendafilov still is not shorter in trumps than him|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still a big gain for Australia|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: actually maybe it was not that hard|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|runnerup: maybe -too dfficult -because rigth 2 @s to defence|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|lml: he can probably afford a heart now for the uptrick ... we know it will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S had @s 4 in his hands to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  6   Muller in 2N|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: East was unable to read the opening lead of the @S9.|pg||
nt|xenya: think i'll get coffee|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir must b cursing himself for not switching @ds--this is turning into a rout|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Better :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes sorry|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that it matters.|pg||
nt|bt: decl has 12 easy tricks now and a bundle of imps to sweden|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: if his partner has the @DA, the contract is always dead|pg||
nt|ady: should be in game   but I dont feel east should be the one to deccide if there an invitational method|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: or a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice play|pg||
nt|udo: i think he should find the duck,,,he knows @D are running most of the time|pg||
nt|lechcold: prawdopodobnie Szwedzi nie byli w stanie zbadaæ co maj¹ w treflach|pg||
nt|runnerup: so no attack to Nyström for pushing ns to game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director in the room ....we will not finish all the boards i think|pg||
pc|d8|nt|boedhy:  but then west at some point would have bid his @s and making 3 is no problem so think this will be a push|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: s³owem wylosowali z³¹ sekwencjê sporód wielu lepszych|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i think i missed somethink|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: something|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|athene: and if declarer has the @DA, it is clear that playing ace and another trump just releases control and allows the diamonds to run|pg||
nt|ady: club ruff coming soon|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: this is very often a problem for the defence - whether to draw trumps or not|pg||
nt|lml: declarer in 4@H makes an easy 5 |pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: when declarer is trying for a ruff but has a threatening side-suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: and underleading or ducking the ace of trumps is often the key|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|star6ija: this appear to be dreat swing for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|star6ija: great*|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D=a) some game interest  b) mild slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South writing explanations|pg||
nt|ady: 2 level high enough|pg||
nt|antoniz: oby nie szlemik na impasie Damy trefl|pg||
nt|lml: wrong again ... shucks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H would be strong game interest, nothing about @H|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2@d shows maybe normal openning... or long suit game try|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   busy here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the bulgarians like the red cards|pg||
nt|ady: as usual   honor 10 of  suit in dummy when leading the Queen|pg||
nt|panosk: key place is 8th that leads to quarterfinals but its early to say|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no spade lead.... |pg||
nt|skaftij:  It is quite a task, both to operate and to comment, you are doing a great job Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i was wondering why he did not discard the heart loser and looked into his hand and was missing lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: all bids are alerted|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stoffers: Good operator, thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: also without saying, so i'll change now that he has 110|pg||
nt|stoffers: Yes, wd|pg||

nt|psyck:  Italy, Netherland, USA2 the top 3|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@H or NT are both cold the thing is to be there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and with the way Drijver played his @h telling his partner he had a trick in @c|pg||
nt|oosmanb: wow probably 6@C now|pg||
nt|andersk: good bidding here. |pg||
nt|xenya: Sweden and NZ are currently neck-in-neck, with Japam trailing by 1VP|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wild card: but after this start that will be too hard|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, NS pushed EW to the 3-level|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|star6ija: do they?|pg||
nt|ady: well stopped|pg||
nt|jbgood: another imp for the overtrick|pg||
nt|skaftij:  :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Jan is in the open room|pg||
nt|szalay: trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd/4th leads mean  LOW from worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|szalay: to be honest small trump is the best lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: clarification just in case other North Americans are in the room|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: EW made it easy to stay low|pg||
nt|star6ija: why then they did not use them during the previous board :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol..i think they discussed it|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes sometimes the silence is golden|pg||

nt|skaftij:  Your profile says otherwise|pg||
nt|antoniz: dwie|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: a hard slam to reach but I thought they might|pg||
nt|lml: south has to do something other than 4@h I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: too difficult to find out that either of them has enough entries|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lars, you have any idea of how/why West should bid 3@C? Did he pull the wrong card from the box?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes sweden had a misunderstanding looks like 2@H/1@D[precision] was michaels as many play 2@D/@d as natural |pg||
nt|bt: they play some 2 Major jumps as 4 of that suit and a longer minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H showed hearts and another suit or at least that is what west thought|pg||
nt|bt: west played that convention|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usually best, I find, to treat 1@D as natural initially - even if it may be short.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever of the US North to keep quiet on his amazingly good clubs.|pg||
nt|bt: they only played together for 10 yrs, har to get (1m)-2M right :)|pg||
nt|bt: hard|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lml: one of the good things about passing is that you are not defending 4@S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Anders we spoke too soon|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ends in 5@s|pg||
nt|xenya: now it should make|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  7  Weinstein in 2N West|pg||
nt|boedhy:  So his hormons could be bothering him|pg||

nt|skaftij:  Maybe friends list mixes it up|pg||
nt|xenya: EW cand beat it if they lead @Hs or E a @C at some point -- but not easy to defend with N's hand concealed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wild card: if declarer plays trumps from the top, he'is severe danger of them breaking 4-1|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|ady: looking at all the cards  possible to make 9 tricks    at some stage gaining an entry with the  hearts   play a low diamond from north   and later play the  jack of diamonds  ...|pg||
nt|ady: pinning the 10|pg||
nt|odysseus69: my good friend Dr Haase just pointed out that heart 9 was no good on last since decarer could run to dummys 10|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lechcold: i no to gra Upmark|pg||
nt|boedhy:  2@s no problem for declarer 3@s on the other hand...|pg||
nt|szalay: trump is standout, isnt it?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lechcold: na to|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|boedhy:  sorry @c 3 offcourse|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some teams have a coach, one of whose duties is to research the bidding methods of the upcoming opponents. Here a coach would have ensured that E/W knew what 1@D meant and which ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: defenses would apply.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Brink did well to get in the auction  --  many would PASS|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: i don't think he will be able to finesse clubs now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he claimed 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: overtrick??|pg||
nt|star6ija: but they are going to be back shortly as far as I know Aronov - Stefanov simpathy to the higher levels|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but it was me who did not notice that on the king of diamonds \e played the ten |pg||
nt|ady: diamonds played for declarer by defence  so an overtrick last hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: maybe he played the Jack of Diamonds instead of 9|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but did you watch the tempo|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no really they are very very good|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lml: the reason that the slam works is that north-south dont have quacks they have controls|pg||
nt|pawel90:  walet kier sie odlozy i lezymy|pg||

nt|athene: with the hearts cleared|pg||
nt|ady: souths trumps not high enough to defeat this|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: a possible alternative was to finesse the @CJ earlier, before knocking out the second spade|pg||
nt|udo: next 7 imps for italy  5@S xed vs 6@S xed,,,,,,really one-qay-match so far|pg||

nt|ady: may not get there|pg||
nt|rv: if North invites, South will accept with 6-4 and good intermediats|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: at first glance cards EW badly placed for 4@H but in fact it is not bad at all|pg||
nt|rv: 3rd seat opening at these colors, texture of my (North) hand will lead me to pass|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: mb i am too much a coward:(|pg||
nt|rv: I like to play this double as accepting Inv and giving partner a choice of bidding 4@h or passing 3@s double, South can't really be stacked with @s on this auction|pg||
nt|ady: may go wrong here   spade back  ruff high    3rd trump trick|pg||
nt|ady: even ruffing with the 8|pg||
nt|rv: as David and Jaap remarked, it requires excellent partnership understanding to double with South hand, even many top partnerships wouldn't have discussed this|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 1@S was 100% real?|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: 4+|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|rv: incidentally many play on (1@h)-(1@s), 2@s as natural|pg||

nt|boedhy:  could have been another 4 imps |pg||
nt|boedhy:  and those boards tend to add up...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I dont think thats a good idea at the moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8  playing Tarzan Precision  Muller passed 1@S so Einarsson balanced 2@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Not the best dummy you saw|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand  doubleton @S led thru Q to partner's AKJxx|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wild card: I see no reason for south to try something, at most 24 points in the combined hands|pg||

nt|udo: great lead,,,,,,,amazing how often they find best lead|pg||
nt|famus: duck 100%|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: GREAT to watch such leads :)|pg||
nt|famus: dont blame NS to be in 3NT--how much they go down is moot|pg||
nt|ady: if west played 4@H  a trump lead may beat it|pg||
nt|boedhy:  sorry have to go back in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: non vul so no worries really|pg||
nt|szalay: 8 of @H is mighty card|pg||
nt|xenya: well this makes -- but you need to pull out the right card each time you are on lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: this looks to make with no problems with the clubs working|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 4-1|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Hi Sybarra cover for me..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: E had @h A in his hand - puts it back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do not know why|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|athene: 500 here without much bother; that's fine when your game is touch and go|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you lose 3 imps if they make the thin 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they should know their defensive signals at this level|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not easy to see that he could play a @h back...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i tend to think this lead would work more often than any other|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|bt: the thought here is that if you want to beat this kontrakt, A@H has to "work" for the defence|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a 'failed Stayman' auction, where responder looks for a major and does not find one, you should favour a major-suit lead. Don't worry that responder has a major. Worry instead ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that declarer will be well-stocked in the minors. |pg||
nt|bt: odds changes slightly when one of the opps hands are very strong like here|pg||
nt|bt: declarer will go to dummy, take a spade finesse and aouth will eventually be squeezed down to his underpants|pg||
nt|bt: south|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have just written a book 'Winning Notrump Leads', with Taf Anthias, where we analysed (by computer) opening leads after a variety of auctions ending in NT. That was one of our ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: findings.|pg||
nt|hlortz: just give w  fewer @H and one more @C say and the lead would be a great success|pg||
nt|brolucius: After an auction of 1NT - 3NT, it is nearly always right to lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even 10-x in a major is better than K-J-x-x in a minor.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fallenius is thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better to win?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table Grue led the @D4.|pg||
nt|bt: fallenius knows partner has nothing else, maybe @DJ|pg||
nt|bt: yea at the other table south was pressured on 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he ducks woolridge will eventually have the option of throwing him in with third heart|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely South knows from the bidding that West holds @HQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would not lead the ace from A-J-x-x|pg||
nt|bt: he must place partner with @DJ thats when there is a possibility to beat this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might but wont continue with jack|pg||
nt|runnerup: but ew seems to make 3nt also |pg||
nt|xenya: and club shift helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8  deWijs playing 2@S West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jonsson was endplayed at trick 2|pg||
nt|szalay: right card means = pull trumps and play finesses?:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: during the pause   i think it significant to note that  all 6 USA teams advanced to KO|pg||
nt|szalay: all we know for right penalty double needs 8 of @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in Bermuda Bowl  4 of 6 European Teams advance|pg||
nt|szalay: 4 from 7|pg||
nt|szalay: Holland is European, I was told|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh that's right  extra team for host country|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those with very short days this time of year   Iceland, Netherlands and Sweden all advanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Israel and Italy   --  i miscounted  5 of 7|pg||
nt|szalay: btw|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: east south Jan   making a joke|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ahhhh -- I did not understand that :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: he should make an uptrick on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|szalay: Israel is european, as well|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: but sometimes you gain 12 when it goes off|pg||
nt|athene: those are good odds for just taking the money|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: zaraz zaraz co tu siê dzieje?|pg||
nt|ady: seems K@H lead may beat it now  exceot north may later be squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not everyone will open on East which will make it tough to reach game - pass and double Norths 1nt response gets to hearts but maybe not game|pg||
nt|sybarra: one sec and will come back  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S made so Netherlands double partscore pickup on  8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|oosmanb: nope @h straight away!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|star6ija: there are some diffivulties|pg||
nt|lechcold: mo¿e byæ:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade to jack seems so normal|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: some might be wondering why it's so obvious for east to duck his @HA there at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Aronov in 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds taken quickly anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup: without @d lead-or switch  -which is difficult|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s @c ducked and @d to the 10 for 6 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d6|nt|bt: that was strange|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: if you have the ace over KQ it's just standard to duck at top level|pg||
nt|athene: it hurts declarer's transportation|pg||
nt|athene: and also helps your own|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Upmark jest lekko wpuszczony|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: oni graj¹ w BA nie wychod w singla Wikingu|pg||

nt|xenya: got to believe in his luck|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: now EW can cash two hearts any time west gets in|pg||
nt|athene: if east won the first trick he couldn't attack hearts any more|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer would have a sure trick and an entry|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no right prediction this time Ruud :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: maybe the result but not the line of play|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: now give up a spade if finesse wrong |pg||
nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein never bid where karaivanov-trendafilo wore out their red cards|pg||
nt|oosmanb: good play, since he knew K@D was the only time he'd get to dummy if A@S is with West|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @S can wait @H could not|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not automatic to reach the game with that 7 facing 17|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|ady: another flatish hand   part score|pg||
nt|yuval10: Gyorgy sazaly, in an earlier match, suggested that the US teams will be tougher to beat during the KO team, also the Italian one|pg||

nt|boedhy:  he should if he hears a fit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the hands fit perfectly|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 1NT will help them win auction in 2@H probably|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Souths pass over 1NT in OR is a matter of style, lots of points but no suit to attack|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S substantially better played by south|pg||

nt|brolucius: 4@S is not a silly contract but the cards lie unluckily for N/S.|pg||
nt|bt: at the other table i think the bids were normal until north bid 4@S, @HQx is really bad on that auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H & @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=no pref|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|athene: you would like to just bid blackwood except you might get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some people play 4@D shows this sort of hand -very strong suit with support for partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok i am told 4@C asks for keycards|pg||
nt|athene: if so, north won't be taking so long :) just a matter of counting four steps|pg||

nt|athene: and north has the well-known problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N shut his eys and looks to the ceiling... thinking|pg||
nt|athene: he has some extras but his only available cue-bid goes past game|pg||

nt|lml: north should bid 4@H here|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what 2NT would show?|pg||

nt|lml: I guess 19?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: can't say, I assume so|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass or correct for N|pg||

nt|ady: east may have trouble keeping trump control to bring in the diamonds|pg||

nt|skaftij:  but he will play a @c to dummy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|skaftij:  after escape method , he will infer that  @C are 4-2, west showed 4+@C-4+@H|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lml: I like a spade play now ... @SQ or jack|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4@c maybe after 2@c opening|pg||
nt|ady: running the 9 guaranteed 7 tricks  and in the event did not cost|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: claim and toilet break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as expected Aronov going down 2 in 4@S on  8|pg||
nt|ady: usa got 6 imps on hand 8 where Bulgaria were to high in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 6 boards   in Bermuda Bowl  Guadalupe leads Iceland by 19 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and we are back|pg||
nt|wild card: and I think it best to play the jack|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: if you had a choice of 3@S or 4@C to splinter, 3@S looks better, as partner has more room over it|pg||
nt|lml: good play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tough for W now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|wild card: but if he plays the jack, the contract will fail, as we see|pg||
nt|wild card: N did show two aces though|pg||
nt|wild card: and if he had had a singleton hearts, he might have had a bid over 1@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo it is a pure guess.|pg||
nt|wild card: looking only at the heart position, I guess it's better to play the jack|pg||
nt|wild card: wins if south has AQx in trumps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: but anyway, they got there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its a very good one and nothing much to the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so well done NL another derserved big plus|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play so 13 imps to the netherlands...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: very well bid by NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: really "communicating" |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Iceland have been pushed down to 6th and this won't help|pg||
nt|skaftij:  clubs is only chance - he knows D finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards stil placed on the table and thinking...|pg||
nt|garden2005: zazwyczaj taki styl reprezntuj¹ pary, ktore maja kompleks ni¿szoci i próbuj¹ w pokerka zagraæ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|leao:  Campos will try to get tricks anyway he can now :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  although if he tries to ruff a @c ... but the @c queen should bother him|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Iceland has a tough "program" for the day|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: has to play Israel in the last match this afternoon|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only needs 1 @C ruff so playing trumps safe|pg||
nt|runnerup: this was down -not any more?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the time is almost up and 6 more boards to play|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e tylko 200?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: GIB podobno nawet wygrywa|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: S had a difficult decision to make, and he banked on 5 hearts with N -- N could have just 4, Al?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: on any lead i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the director in the room|pg||
nt|xenya: so they will be penalised, which is good news for Japan, who are trailing NZ by 1VP|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: mr Slavek Latala|pg||
pc|sA|nt|runnerup: he ruffed too high -so back to minus|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lml: probably down 2|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has 7 top tricks and probably has to come to a black suit trick|pg||
nt|lml: a balck suit queen|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no entries to the dummy|pg||
nt|wild card: well done robert stephens|pg||
nt|lml: nice try to set up a heart by no luck|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: Martel might rise on the club to lead a diamond through|pg||
nt|lml: makes it easier on partner|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: every team desperate to make the top 8 as we near the end of the RR|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphznv: the 1@h interference by W in the other room made it more difficult|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: last hand  if the cards shown on the screen were correct then 10 tricks were there   north has discarded too many diamonds|pg||
nt|leao:  good news, the king is on side, but bad news is it's Kxxx|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Secured 1 down|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bt: decl needs @CK onside then east doesnt have @SQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: dont you like good partners like that|pg||
nt|bt: it wasnt magic, lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he is guesseing the spades because of lack of entries|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: better for north now to draw last trump  |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it seems|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: really Jan?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it seems so|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||

nt|skaftij:  cannot go wrong now, 5 imps to Israel|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: soon a claim coming|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|leao:  and then endplaying him if he doesnt ruff|pg||

nt|rv: lol Jaap,not me Roland|pg||

nt|rv: Roland watches over all of us, he is busy with Voice commentary|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d!|mb|p|nt|rv: 3@c is pre-empt raise, double is possibly game try here|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|rv: super bidding|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jaapfr vg: not because they are Dutch but the last session BB on vuegraph EW played bridge from another planet so unbelieveble good |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|rv: yes Jaap, we know you are neutral and Dutch team has fantastic players|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jaapfr vg: i am a fan of usa2:)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|rv: incidentally my prediction is Italy to beat Dutch in finals here|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: that is possible but only when a USA team loses in the QF, else they have to face eachother|pg||
nt|ady: south opened 1NT CR   2@H overcall by west   P   P   another go by south 3@C   passed out|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rv: after 1n opening, it is lot tougher to reach to be fair to Ice-men|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: with regard to kibs remarks : fan of usa2, italy and Dutch (they played so well imo during RR that a real bridge lover must be fan of these teams):)|pg||
nt|ady: suggest if you duck a spade club back   but can ruff   go back to A@D and ruff last club    thehn hearts ruffing  and over ruff last trick|pg||

nt|ady: yes    |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: vwd NL|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for quarter final they have big problems. Maybe the Netherlands will choose them (because of the carry-over...)or they will be playing USA 1 |pg||

nt|bt: any easy 7@S, can ns compete enough?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: od fold, A/Q|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -made it -so |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the director just said 5 mins per board |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lall-Grue on same board  so Nystrom-Bertheau must really be slow|pg||
mb|1N|nt|leao:  they got off it cheaply at 200|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I really though this would be closer|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: The icelandic pair in this room was yesterday sure that the Netherlands would pick them if they had a chance to do so|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Might be a small pick up for Sweden last board|pg||
nt|garden2005: zyska³ 13 w 26, bilans -2|pg||
nt|garden2005: -3|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: pakistan might get an imp on 24|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: martel has a good hand|pg||
nt|lechcold: szlem graniczny, zobaczymy jak naszym pójdzie|pg||
nt|oosmanb: if they stop in 2@H|pg||
nt|xenya: Match A Open Room will be kept open to announce the quarterfinal pairings|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: missing @HJ10xx you cash the single honour first because you can only pick up 4-0 break one way|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H both majors - popular weapon|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can read more about the Bermuda Bowl, particularely the US teams and the Israeli one too, plus expert analyzes, on www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|lml: I am quite impressed with the bridge in this match.  What do you think?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 boards to go here|pg||
nt|garden2005: ale witne zagranie zaliczy³ :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17  EXCEPT  1st seat favoralbe|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you had the 10 you would cash the honour from hand first as you can pick up Jxxx in either hand|pg||
nt|athene: japan might get their first imp there, if East in the other room leads his ace against six|pg||
nt|athene: (i am sure bocchi madala will reach six)|pg||
nt|lml: well Baxter's choice of 2@S turned out to be a good choice although perhaps south would still have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: so Canada has the lead again|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3BA to Splinter karowy jak s¹dzê|pg||
nt|antoniz: splinter karowy|pg||
nt|leao:  \i expect board 24 will show a tidy profit for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can beat 4 @H  but have to take their tricks  |pg||
nt|bt: now some people can bid 2@S strong on that hand, wouldnt that be nice?|pg||
nt|brolucius: In NT it is a 5-or-7 hand, depending on whether the clubs come in. 7@S much better, because you can establish the clubs against a 4-1 break.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like a very biddable grand slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H now would suggest diamond support, because he is a passed hand.|pg||
nt|bt: west can splinter in diamonds, east blackwood and 5NT maybe?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7@S needs almost nothing|pg||
nt|hlortz: ew had a rather hasty auction in OR   seems like there might be some bids between 2n and 6n imo |pg||
nt|bt: credit to the 2@H opening at the other table|pg||
nt|garden2005: przepraszam za gubienie literek, obiecujê poprawê|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: if they can take the club finesse and make 11 in 3nt|pg||
nt|stoffers: A lot of dull boards this set|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north will be shaking but impossible to find 2Hx|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  slight over statement    but 2NT could be much weaker in balancing seat  and very good stops in hearts   just have to play partner with enough  to make game   7 or 8 points ...|pg||
nt|ady: may do|pg||

nt|xenya: 1@DX -1 might not be such a bad result for Israel |pg||
nt|oosmanb: wow nice hand|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Very nice. Easy when you see all hands, the players need to do this again and againn for days and tiredness creeps in|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West said : only this partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D pre-emptive, of course, since he can cue-bid with a good raise.|pg||
nt|hlortz: that was a factor certainly|pg||
nt|bt: i think 4@D makes it a lot easier here|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps the lack of time made swedish do that little slip in defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nystrom seems very fast...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am not sure about that last result ... looked like 2 down not 1 down|pg||
nt|star6ija: I do not expect they to go further than 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to penalize this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but DBL would work very well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  well the gain is only 50|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: i asked them and the claim was for 1 down, 1 also though like 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I asked them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=ART FG  a) @C  b) 4@H  c) long @S|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: impodajny to ten mecz nie jest|pg||
nt|yuval10: me too Linda, those are very strong 2 teams|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: as I said earlier -- they were being beaten heavily in the test match |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Running scores > http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that is usually the case. 4@D does not show more than 4@S. It shows one of the reasons WHY you are worth 4@S. |pg||
nt|bt: if north bids 5@D it would have been tough|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bertheau for sure slower than nystrom|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: he actually has 2 of the 3 options covered|pg||
nt|stoffers: We want action and blood :)|pg||
nt|wild card: not the first time we see a transfer on one level today|pg||
nt|ady: this might be 1 too high|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now it becomes interesting|pg||
nt|ady: only 9 obvious tricks including K@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: E may bid again and he did |pg||
nt|skaftij:  risk is losing double digit imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  dummy has 3@C  looked like 2 before|pg||
pc|d2|nt|udo: i played against Lauria-Versace 3 or 4 times,,,when they are on a run,, u feel pressure every second|pg||
nt|athene: slam is not so bad here, if played by north to protect the @CK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D asks|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2 and a half :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: brawo Krzysztofy,piêknie i skutecznie|pg||
nt|lechcold: co siê musi udaæ, w koñcu to Mistrzostwa Swiata:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like making 10 with @S start|pg||
nt|ady: I believe the 2 heart opening shows 5 hearts and 4 spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can do it - spade and South must play 10 then 2nd spade (9) and can establish spade trick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or can end play North|pg||
nt|ady: I think J@S  may be right|pg||
nt|ady: J@S    if south covers with the queen   then king    come back to east and low spade|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: 3NT  best spot|pg||

nt|oosmanb: 5@d makeable as the hand is|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so no play here :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: but south has the diamonds so it would have to be 6nt (or 6@S, but that is not likely)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=4@H    totally new concept|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3@H = 5@S-4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm very much impressed with how the Israeli team are playing here, and we must not forget it's a rather young one, most of them age nearly 40|pg||
nt|lml: there is no reason for south to pull with JX of diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: a slightly different auction gave more room for NS than in the OR - and may land in thispartial|pg||
nt|panosk: looks like a gd contract |pg||
nt|panosk: lead will provide 9th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  I can imagine why. They play solid easy bridge as we can see from these boards|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so normally the better team wins then....And I think the Netherlands are a bit better ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: very solid indeed|pg||
nt|szalay: boring 1 off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: early World Championships were scored Total Points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so here  NS would be net +50 after 100 honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honors died when Imps came into use|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|odysseus69: all reasonable plays produce a 10th trck|pg||
nt|bt: 5nt then 7@S looks easy now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now after all the key cards are known 5NT will invite a grand and West will accept with those clubs.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|famus: 6NT wud be great|pg||
nt|athene: north may now offer 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: but it's tricky|pg||
nt|athene: good hand but no aces|pg||
nt|lechcold: karach:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: well - looks as if 2@h was gf...|pg||
nt|leao:  rite, if they dont take their 4 tricks kickly they wont take them at all|pg||
pc|d6|nt|udo: nice bid by South,,now North shoudl accept,,, he has a clear max|pg||
nt|wild card: interesting question is, what would redouble instead of 1@s mean|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I believe 1@s did show a 3crd|pg||
nt|wild card: and does dbl on 1@h show a takeout hand (like this), or something in hearts|pg||

nt|lml: Matel has to pick a major with 3-3|pg||
nt|desinka:  depends from the vuln|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i always wonder what it would be like to revive them in a duplicate setting|pg||
pc|hK|nt|skaftij:  Is it Ilan or Ophir who is South?|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, he has just shown the @CK. I was not expecting that.|pg||
nt|bt: now if east thinks and does bid 6@S ...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5NT not only asks for kings, also for a trick source which woolridge has|pg||
nt|brolucius: Makes no sense if West bids 7@S now. Why not on the previous round?|pg||
nt|bt: i thenk the us2 coach should do some work here|pg||
nt|garden2005: bêd¹ p¹czki|pg||
nt|xenya: this will also take some time -- before it goes down|pg||
pc|h3|nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|athene: well, this might make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now the lead // who would lead a @c|pg||
nt|athene: lauria did not double 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: but the italians don't double these bids very often|pg||
nt|athene: so versace might still lead a club|pg||
nt|famus: i bet a @c lead|pg||
nt|udo: @C looks like he natural lead........maybe a @D|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's close between club and spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is not "that great"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ilan is south|pg||
nt|bt: if east thought and then bid 6@S they are toast|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|udo: 13 now|pg||
nt|panosk: see how long he thinks to make sure of finding the correct plan even in a seemingly straightforward contract?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|famus: might lose an imp or two here--coz the Ita wud b in 6NT if at all|pg||
nt|ady: this will likely make in spite of bad split|pg||
nt|yuval10: that won't be a big success for USA1|pg||
nt|lml: so this is how you can end in a 3-3 fit friends even when you are great players|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Against aggresive teams as India for instance yesterday you can loose because of some slem boards who happen to make|pg||
nt|runnerup: one down next -save time |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: ok now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all over - now 11 but he wont want to get greedy again|pg||
nt|yuval10: with the natural @h lead the contract seem like drifting at least 3|pg||
nt|xenya: W didn't know E had the @D10 when he ran|pg||

pc|dA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: can cash @SAK and play three rounds of trumps now to force east to give a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't help|pg||
nt|athene: you can throw the club loser from dummy and ruff in hand but then dummy has only one trump to deal with two club losers|pg||
nt|athene: so one down|pg||
nt|athene: west didn't want to shift to the @CQ because declarer could have stiff king (four clubs with east for the double)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: low heart lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 NT the safest game|pg||
nt|jbgood: defense made it easy at the other table|pg||

nt|ady: minors behave for 6@C    but likely to finish in 3NT|pg||
nt|bt: i dont know if there was a break anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Break or not, it is illogical to realise that 7 is there when partner signs off but not before.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: an old chess maneouvre, you repeat the position to gain thinking time|pg||

mb|3H|nt|wild card: would you bid 2@s or 2@h now?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the only 2-suiter NS can show is @H & @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: he looks more relaxed now|pg||

nt|skaftij:  this will make 9 or 10 tricks|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: new leader after this|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: West you didn't. maybe something good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ai|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Great Dealer thinks we have just ben treated to a grand slam, so we should (as a penance) watch some - usually very slow - 1NT contract. |pg||
nt|skaftij:  With 2@h contrsuctive, North should raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: balancing 2@H  when 2@D would be more constructive|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wild card: well, you already have told you're low on points, and you'll never make your hearts in a spade contract|pg||
nt|boedhy:  played too quickly there|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sr FOLKS -- should never have complemented them -- always ends this way when I do -- SORRY |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lucky for NL 5C was allowed to make OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i got it wrong 1st time  --  actually  2@D stronger than 2@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  true|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: some play re-double in east seat compels 2@C  which east would pass with what he had  or if a higher suit would then bid his suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have 3 ranges for 1N   at fav  1/2=9-12  3/4=11-14  otherwise 15-17|pg||
nt|odysseus69: interesting bidding in OR- having bid 2H over the double South revalued and bid 4H after 3D|pg||
nt|jbgood: fine contract for a push - he will not risk the club finesse - and three club tricks the reward|pg||
nt|ady: this could bring in some imps for Bulgaria|pg||

pc|h6|nt|udo: still,,,9 tricks ,,hmm,,,,may need some endplay|pg||
nt|athene: will he try finessing the @S9 for a dummy entry?|pg||
nt|ady: needs to get club right|pg||
nt|ady: bad situation in either minor might have meant slam going down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|udo: i see only 7 tricks actually|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|athene: @SK there was safe, wasn't it? i guess not if east had @SQ109xx, but is that really possible?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: tht this was glong to be played in clubs    but this will also come home|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: down now - right|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ehsana: hello all :)|pg||
nt|ady: spade ruff   will beat this |pg||
nt|desinka:  lucky - 6@C/6@D are almost the same in this positions of the cards|pg||
nt|ady: not down in clubs    6NT would have made as well|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I would like 6@c a lot more|pg||
nt|desinka:  for sure|pg||
nt|bt: i think we have sweden-nz in the last round also|pg||
nt|brolucius: I usually find that it is a close decision between looking out of the window and watching a 1NT contract (but some say that this is an eccentric view).|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: not guaranteed    west only bid once  and did not rebid diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: so probably 4|pg||
nt|lml: and likely a push or an imp in it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wests 3D bid has received criticism from spectators- rightly so- his hand is poor defensively so shouldnt give oppo 2nd chance|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphznv: a spade to the @s J|pg||
nt|athene: lauria decides to give up on the heart finesse since it might be wrong anyway and even if right, very hard to get to take it twice|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EA--can u tell us who was their coach--i forget the name??|pg||
nt|athene: even if the @S10 is onside|pg||
nt|ehsana: Kokish's  reps in Karachi|pg||
nt|famus: ah ok--ther are people looking here for those reps:))haha--joking|pg||
nt|athene: if the hearts are breaking, then it is advantageous to cash them|pg||
nt|star6ija: how he will go probably wrong|pg||
nt|ady: can make   ruff high and draw   and play on either red suit  |pg||
nt|star6ija: I think chances are greater for ruffing with the 8 here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fingers on the ten...not on the table|pg||
nt|ady: have to guess|pg||
nt|lml: Martel is getting his long suit going right away|pg||
nt|panosk: if spade finess doesnt work ruff another heart in dummy|pg||

pc|c7|nt|athene: to take some exit cards away from the defence and make them discard|pg||
pc|c2|nt|desinka:  stupid comment|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|famus: with two entries it wud've fetched him more to return @hs--but Lauria does it for him|pg||
nt|ehsana: hink Lauria is giving all up|pg||
nt|athene: but if they aren't breaking, cashing them just sets up a trick or tricks for a defender|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finesse @ss now|pg||
nt|udo: @S to 9 and still interesting|pg||

nt|bt: or get to nt|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4 to go|pg||

nt|sybarra: guess we are the speed table today |pg||
nt|leao:  board 24 coming up at the other table|pg||
nt|ady: may be over 20 imps swing on last hand being in diamonds rather than clubs or no-trumps|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Yes jan shut up :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I will from now on|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4Comparisons but the OR playinglast board|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew in forest here in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: New Zealand not in a qualifying spot any more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL focusing on Majors   partner avoids @D unless real length|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Sometimes very difficult to decide between NT and a 5-3 major fit. I usually solve the problem by always playing in the major. |pg||

nt|vugraphznv: of course|pg||

mb|p|nt|bt: i follow kantar-eisenberg on that|pg||
nt|bt: with overstrength always play 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS play multi - maybe he thinks that hand is too strong for weak-two but too weak for 1@S|pg||
nt|wild card: board 10, EW in the open room also bid 4@h, got a diamond lead, declarer misguessed trumps but still got home after a wrong defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West asks about the time|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 20/25 min offcial|pg||
nt|leao:  4@s looks cold for NS as cards lay|pg||

nt|oosmanb: which Ace do you lead against 5@C !!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, also 6NT instead of 6 of a suit (which may break badly)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: spades best for n/s   difficult to find now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looking at it more deeply he had to choose if partner had the @c or @s ace|pg||
nt|skaftij:  the 4-1 break make 4@s difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most play support DBL only thru 2@H|pg||
nt|szalay: but over 2M it shows extras|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: Part of the game:)|pg||
nt|lml: on the lie of the cards e-w can do pretty well in a minor|pg||
nt|xenya: much depends on how NS treat this sequence...|pg||
nt|lml: but no way to know that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jorgs bidding doesnt match their CC|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2NT = FG raise|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: or maybe he just thinks his spades are not good enough for a weak-two|pg||
nt|athene: i bet bocchi is not so demure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: seems a cross ruff game here|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that the defence is overrruffing|pg||
nt|lml: he has five top tricks so he needs to make 3 little diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he can make a ruff of a small club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hard to do so with this layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11  Stefanov in 4@H on the Moysian|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually declarer after correct guess in @ss has to keep all his @ds in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: and it appears 3@S was just a signoff|pg||
nt|bt: so if u have like 26 hcp and 53, get to the major, u need the extra ruff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphznv: I wrote what Jorgensen wrote to N|pg||
nt|skaftij:  4@d void probably|pg||
nt|bt: with 28 or more get to nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, there is no threat of an adverse ruff in NT, of course.|pg||
nt|bt: at least thats my interpretation of how they played, must ask them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S according to cc is GI-relay [15]|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pawel90:  5@D byÅo tanie|pg||
nt|sybarra: has a bit to handle however |pg||
nt|leao:  6 even, without  @d lead |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course and that is what he has :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will not make this...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  have to go have fun all|pg||
nt|skaftij:  running scores |pg||
nt|skaftij:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|runnerup: now @d lead needed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Jonsson asked if he has to much|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Baldursson answer is: yes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wild card: south apparently wants to know whether to play 3NT or 4@s, and that's an easy decision for north|pg||
nt|lml: a spade lead will not be helpful to the defense|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @c ruffs would give alot of defensive tricks.. 2 ruffs A@H A@S 2@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no i dont know what that means :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told by a kibitzer that a recent analysis showed (in world championship play) that 3NT played better than four of a major when the hands are balanced. He says that Glyn ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Liggins (of England) was the author. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they have 25 minutes left|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have not read it, but it would be interesting to see.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this hand south has no reason to play 4@H for sure|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panosk: tough contract lets see how he deals with it|pg||
nt|panosk: prefer semi forcing 2@D with W hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bye Ruud and thanks from all of us'|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: Natural 4@S but appears difficult to make on J@D lead.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3C for 5 card major|pg||
nt|leao:  yes, he has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 6 with j10 of spades dropping|pg||
nt|leao:  rite|pg||
nt|leao:  @d and @d?|pg||
nt|bt: i also never look for a major w 4333, its just so i dont waste my energy deciding or give up information |pg||
nt|runnerup: @s lead |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: think this will end in game|pg||
nt|ady: not slam|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wild card: 3@h conventional, I've seen Americans do that before|pg||
nt|wild card: with both @dA and @cK offside, he will go down|pg||
nt|wild card: and 3NT might be made|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems to imply that responder should bid Stayman (rather than make a transfer bid) when he is 5-3-3-2 with a 5-card major and sound game values. |pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: could go wrong   |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: score board 28 corrected...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to rise with spade ace after d finesse loses|pg||
nt|ady: then play for K@C with north|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays clubs now and north wins and plays a 2nd spade  will again have to play the ace|pg||
nt|odysseus69: much debate - should he play clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: diamond finesse now looks normal|pg||
nt|ady: club can wait|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Zack shaking his head.. perhaps thinking about board 25?|pg||
nt|ady: good duck of spade from south|pg||
nt|leao:  nope|pg||
nt|ady: looks good for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chick:  and the Venice Cup for those interested:   http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=882|pg||
nt|andersk: well I do not lead @H A|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lechcold: ten Grue jest bardzo grony|pg||
nt|sybarra: but not a slam "we" want to be in |pg||
nt|andersk: 4 sp makes|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it did|pg||
nt|jbgood: so one imp for Sweden most likely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he did not play|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  11  [3@C S -1]  Muller in 4@S east|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: he is trying for the crossruff but it wont work for him|pg||
nt|leao:  lol... agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few people do that, though.|pg||
nt|hlortz: south has both xtra high cards and no aces - that points me to 3n also|pg||
nt|bt: so 3nt was slam invitaional presumably|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: west might have pushed with 5@C   and taken a view if east cu 5@D|pg||
nt|wild card: he can discard 3 clubs now|pg||
nt|wild card: but after @d10, I doubt he will depend on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lechcold: przepraszam, priv:) ale Joe Grue, naprawdê jest grony|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jbgood: but not when W didnt cach the club ...|pg||
nt|bt: hurd has no clear lead here, i would try that too|pg||
nt|bt: i dont think this auction makes ducking @DA a difficult play|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|leao:  goig for the forcing defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: may end up making only 5 |pg||
nt|leao:  well, he's in 4, so no problem|pg||
nt|boedhy:  hi all back|pg||
nt|sybarra: re hi Ruud |pg||
nt|boedhy:  not much imps going on i see|pg||
nt|boedhy:  board 24 only|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 24  |pg||
nt|leao:  ruff, @d to dummy and @d back.... if W ruffs, he'll be ruffing pards trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes that was a extreme result|pg||
nt|leao:  yes, Miguel felt the urge to show pard he had @h as well, instead of leading pards suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we losing connection or is Bas thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bas is thinking|pg||
nt|leao:  looks like hes thinking|pg||
nt|olegario: sure now trying for an extra trick which may not happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not after 4-1 trump split|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: premature Q@C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT much easier - if I had 5 card Stayman would I use it? dont tink so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean so you dont have to lead?|pg||
nt|runnerup: i just cant see that north has any rigth to bid to 3 @c -but he did (i think south agrees)|pg||
nt|xenya: can make by setting up hearts|pg||
nt|skaftij:  ith 3-2 spades 4 spades also off after 3 rounds of diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ryskiel_: jakby dali graæ|pg||
nt|panosk: hoping for spades 3-3|pg||
nt|andersk: now even easier|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why is ducking something that West should consider?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wild card: probably he will have to|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the scorebaords again http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as we near the end of this round|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as if @C ever get any respect  now they're premature|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: the good news is that the long hand is overrufing the spades|pg||
nt|lml: so he will probably come to the diamond 9 eventually for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: west claims|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lechcold: gramy z USA2 o 16:45 jakby co...|pg||
nt|ady: not going well|pg||
nt|lml: this should make the endplay obvious|pg||
pc|hA|nt|davidstern: Losing 0-1-1-2|pg||
nt|davidstern: Down 1 I estimate|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for voice commentators   yes, lead was @CA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: well done by North but ducking club jack was VERY anti percentage|pg||
nt|panosk: actually trying to discard hearts from dummy and ruff his heart loser in hand|pg||
nt|panosk: *from hand|pg||
nt|panosk: also found out that spades arent 3-3 |pg||
pc|c3|nt|antoniz: oby tak skutecznie jak ze Szwecj¹ do tej pory:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wd|pg||
nt|panosk: Isreal in 6@S in previous gained them a hefty 13 imps , new leader|pg||
nt|bt: mainly because he has nothing to play back, and maybe north will play for a @D underlead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wild card: now his only hope is for west to have only 2 or 3 trumps|pg||
nt|andersk: Upmark not happy with that, however the split makes it easy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: played for K@C with south when north played low   and king to come down in 3|pg||
nt|panosk: if N had K@D cud have made |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: or jack|pg||
nt|panosk: well not really if N ducked heart ruff decl wud have to play diamonds himself|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: wd S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: so who wants to be endplayed|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pachtman did wait for it - he just claimed 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: did not bither with club finesse|pg||
nt|ady: bother|pg||
nt|xenya: so the par here is 5@CX -1|pg||
nt|ritong: he has something to play back|pg||
nt|brolucius: West hoped that partner had a top trump and a doubleton club. He could then win and cross to @CA for a ruff.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: i wonder what the record is for most bbo vugraph tables in play at any one time|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: which seems his only chance as @S K is certainly offside|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: double squeeze now|pg||
nt|ady: north has to keep a top club  and south has to keep heart  so 3rd diamond is a trick|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ah can get there often enough|pg||
nt|runnerup: good guess -but still looses imps|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|panosk: i learn as i go :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|s2|nt|wild card: well done, smelled his chance to make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a short break requested by one of the players|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: the cards lie very well for north-south|pg||
nt|ehsana: DBL was nota good option ??|pg||
nt|wild card: this will probably force p to bid 4@s, he will ask for keycards|pg||
nt|yuval10: the logic is to enable partner to bid with a big hand and /or 2 suiter hand in which he doesn't open 2@c with |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West: I hop I don't have to much|pg||
nt|panosk: * Israel sorry|pg||
nt|skaftij:  When entering dummy second time, run the 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: will west offer notrumps, or just bash in 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: he surely must bid SOME game, with a good 17 count facing drury|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: why not?|pg||
nt|athene: versace going for singleton heart with his partner and an immediate knockout|pg||
nt|ady: would need a club ruff to beat 4@H   but n/s not in the bidding|pg||
nt|bt: this is the type of auctions where north has to base his action on south having some values, like 6-7 hcp|pg||
nt|brolucius: Look at the Open Room bidding, by putting your cursor on the Open Room result (top left). East broke a fundamental rule of bidding by going to 4@H, He had made a limit bid and knew ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: little of what partner held.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: curiously  most tables will have identical auction even though very different inferences|pg||
nt|star6ija: have to go now , see you at 4:45 CET for the next Bulgaria's hard fight agains Poland|pg||
nt|star6ija: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bye|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|ady: need to take some care here   defenders each had a side suit singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table..thinking|pg||
nt|kamyk: ale by³ to sensowny plan - krótki @DK u wchodz¹cego|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwna gra|pg||
nt|yuval10: and in worst case you play 2NT with the points equal between both sides|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Campos sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nope |pg||
nt|szalay: I think weak openings survive cause weak overcall is coming|pg||
nt|skaftij:  lost opportunity for Iceland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've only ruled out @H lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|skaftij:  this can be defeated with 3x @s after takin @cs|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so south didnt bid anything yet (thats a first) and his partner bids 4@s and he has thid hand....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump makes a lot of sense |pg||
nt|skaftij:  good lead|pg||
nt|xenya: and a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially with West showing at least invitational strength|pg||
pc|s2|nt|famus: i think it was the right thing to do|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and @h K might be a falsecard with KJx|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S has a chnace now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and declarer will make this one - is my guess|pg||
nt|ady: another chance for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3S shows 4S and 5H - Smolen is what I thnk its called|pg||
nt|leao:  no 5@s with d lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: evryone is saying 6@C on the major squeeze|pg||
nt|skaftij:  that will take care of (A)Qxx in North|pg||
nt|brolucius: He could hardly hope to shut out a spade fit if North/South held one.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he can make this but is not easy|pg||
nt|runnerup: so he took @s finess after all|pg||
pc|sT|nt|skaftij:  At last some action :-)|pg||
nt|lml: the problem here is getting to the 1 point hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: also of course it makes life tougher for opps|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|xenya: can be made on this lead|pg||
nt|lml: once they didnt lead hearts it can be made if you guess all|pg||
nt|yuval10: he just play A@s and J@s|pg||
nt|lml: you need to tap the dummy at trick two|pg||
nt|ady: n/s do have 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: east a little worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: @CK lead not all that appealing on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: west likely to have a strong notrump sort of hand; it could easily cost|pg||
pc|hK|nt|odysseus69: new leader|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course easier said than done|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: 1 top trump helps|pg||
nt|lechcold: 130 i -2 impy|pg||
nt|leao:  best decision. shug go 2 off|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah finally he bids|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|wild card: probably he wasn't considering anything else than 6@s, but east had some questions about the auction or kept the tray for a couple of seconds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No play, can cash a @C otherwise make 7.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: trump lead is very appealing on this bidding so duboin might play north for the @SQ from the failure to lead a trump|pg||
nt|ady: west not leading a heart as north had shown 5 hearts  4 spades and a game going hand with 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told that Brink is allergic to PASS cards|pg||
pc|c2|nt|famus: is he going to hook @s straight away?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately the bidding didn't help them diagnose the obvious squeeze :) 1 to me|pg||
nt|xenya: i can't make out NS's auction at all|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: looks like  11  Stefanov may actually make 4@H in the Moysian fit|pg||
nt|ady: small trump best|pg||
nt|odysseus69: look it up - i will ask|pg||
nt|ady: but e/w have the same in diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: cant see how that helps defence|pg||
nt|lechcold: zarówno 1BA jak i pas na 1BA jako mi siê nie podobaj¹:(|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think 5@s is makeable...|pg||
nt|sybarra: club club  maybe|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: on the other hand the threat of a club ruff might make him just bash out @SAK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now, it be even go 2 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East will surely ditch a @h|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what is the range of 1NT - 14-16 i guess but sure to find out in a moment|pg||
pc|d2|nt|leao:  not with @d lead and @h back :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they cannt get there @d tricks|pg||
nt|bt: are the nz team allowed to do that "haka" before their matches? seems like they did against usa1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: best for declarer to play 2nd round of clubs from east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: in the tank now|pg||
nt|ady: of course we can see that   easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2 times @c|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pawel90:  1BA pokazuje bilans przynajmniej|pg||
nt|lechcold: aczkolwiek mo¿na znaleæ uzasadnienie dla obu odzywek..|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Seems that goes for Drijver as well|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|odysseus69: 14-16 confirmed|pg||
nt|panosk: eventually will play diamonds and that is his problem, how to?|pg||
nt|leao:  if he goes for a xruff he may go -1 only|pg||
nt|leao:  rite... always -2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: he needed to float @S to make  but hard to picture Martel's shape|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a heart  then a@C and a club|pg||
nt|lml: this is a very sensible line|pg||
nt|yuval10: and naturally you play AK@s and go down|pg||
nt|xenya: wrong...|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czy kto mo¿e zna termin V Kolumna...to co z wojny hiszpañskiej w 36 roku|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: yes I believe in smollen  3@H  after stayman and 2 diamond response would have been the same   but not game forcing?|pg||
nt|lml: it just doesnt work|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|brolucius: Very good, Lars.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: he has to duck to preserve the entry to the fourth club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: signaling is asked by N now to E|pg||
nt|ehsana: better this way on this holding|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|athene: in the other room bocchi-madala DID play 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: and DID get a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: but|pg||
nt|athene: their system meant north was declarer|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: now definately should get club right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still going down, isn't he?|pg||
nt|ady: but should not have cashed the diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must lose 2@C and 1@S |pg||
nt|ady: a@C  and club before the K@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and NS already have 1 trick|pg||
nt|rialc2: vedo che, praticamente, ci sono state solo manche (da ciò lo score "perfetto")|pg||
nt|skaftij:  on bd 29, Baldursson in 5@s, let rge @d lead run to 9 so 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: but now the defence get the @DK set up too fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or stansby scores @S & @D|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|famus: doesnt show on the scoreboard?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fine defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just forgot to DBL|pg||
mc|6|nt|xenya: or do they just bid their 5-card suits and raise on 3 -- still that doesn't account for N's final raise|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Does not make sense that 2@s should be forcing if 2@d is strong|pg||
nt|skaftij:  so South should just pass|pg||

nt|ritong: tea time, david|pg||
nt|bt: this is a bad 14 count, and fallenius agrees|pg||
nt|bt: losing|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: the heart stopper and the high card point count are not sufficient though|pg||
nt|bt: he will show it as 11-13|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: why not 1N from Karaivanov???   i thought 9-12 in this situation|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand 4@S and 5@D.|pg||
nt|leao:  31-2 with no good boards coming is not a goo omen|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   lost connection|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 1NT by N most likely|pg||
nt|oosmanb: by South actually|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has bid 1@S in response to his partner's transfer bid.|pg||

nt|xenya: or S|pg||
nt|bt: well he better take it oout then|pg||
nt|brolucius: North showed spades, so East had a 1@S bid for take-out. Double would mean something else.|pg||

mb|p|nt|wild card: plenty of time to shift to a heart later on|pg||

nt|ady: they have taken the push|pg||
nt|runnerup: do more + for Sw..|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: north pened a tactical lead direct 1 spade in 3rd seat to get the right lead if defending|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in OR South found a response to 1H - there is an old system called Acol- where 2H opener shows 8 or more tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: a touch-and-go game, the Q@s makes this contract an excellent one|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W have found their club fit.|pg||

nt|skaftij:  West has shown about 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson will be reluctant|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they bid it in the open room|pg||
nt|skaftij:  otoh, they bid agressively|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: east is stil in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With 12-14 and @c, West would bid 2@c and revert to 2@h over 2@d I think|pg||
nt|ritong: thank you, pard|pg||
nt|bt: thing is we all make horrendous mistakes but it is partnerpreserving to play them yourself|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could not really hope to win the auction to good effect when his partner could not speak over 1@C. So, wiser to pass.|pg||
nt|bt: not only is woolridge upset over his partners bids, he also have to play a really awful contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: East is expecting better clubs opposite because he asked partner to choose between the red suits.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have doubled 1@H to get in the auction safely 1@S should have good shape including clubs on actual auction|pg||
nt|szalay: bald is very agressive today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H denied 4-fit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: I like the small club|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: perfect play the small @c|pg||
nt|xenya: not likely to make -- but you never know|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: now...asking more questions|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ....more questions lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: back to thinking ....do not go away|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With bidding like this and pauses like,  everyone is aware that the contact may be touch and go. They hate to give the match away on the penultimate deal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||

nt|leao:  he has to extract the @d ace b4 pulling trumps|pg||
nt|oosmanb: bath coup'esque |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finaly a spade landed on the table|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wild card: and it's only 300|pg||
nt|boedhy:  his @h are too good so no problems indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: so 4 or 5 to Sweden|pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: Many thanks also to my fellow commentators, Lars and Henry. It was an enjoyable session.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 1@C opening showed 2+, conceivably can have 5 diamonds also if balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice shift|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is not good|pg||
nt|lml: that club play is a problem|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: the other room just started bidding  13|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yuval10: Israel's next match is against Italy, very tough day for them, they've done great so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the 4/1 @H break is just pesky |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so, remove the 2 slam swings and Iceland would have a narrow lead, that's how close it really is|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|cT|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lml: he still has nine tricks though|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes drijver will probably get a @h trick at the end|pg||
nt|leao:  hell have to time it carefully|pg||
nt|leao:  but miguel is a careful player :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm so sorry   thought Baldursson rebid 3@D|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|panosk: thinking if he can do anything about possible bad breaks but he cant so here you are|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: and that will be a push|pg||
nt|lml: heading to an uptrick |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: it appears|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not quite bath coup but he won 2 tricks when he deserved 1 in @S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so should make 7 now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bt: eschewing diamonds finesse was a thoughtful play|pg||
pc|dT|nt|skaftij:  On  12, Iceland is in 3NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: I am always happy to add thanks to BBO, for letting us all enjoy these wonderful championships live, at no charge. Long may it last!|pg||
nt|bt: i got to use that word ...|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s7|nt|leao:  see?|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|ryskiel_: kobiety odnios³y zwyciêstwo na Niemkami...pyrrusowe niestety|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: spectator suggests and I agree - facing a passed partner North should open 4H|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
mc|8|nt|ady: trumps splitting   so ok     not the greatest game|pg||
nt|hlortz: and thaks to the many great comments from the kibs|pg||
nt|skaftij:  MÃ¼ller responded 2@c to the 1NT opening, |pg||

mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, (3)4+@D, unbal, 3@D if (41)35, maybe 2245|pg||
nt|rv: welcome Al, our resident Big @c expert|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|jaapfr vg: the Dutch were awfully tough in both rooms imo|pg||
nt|ady: one more hand   sorry|pg||
nt|ady: this should be flat|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rv: yes Dutch were high-quality, Icemen were below their usual standard, I am sure they can and will play better in subsequent segments|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over Michaels for the Majors  similar situation to Unusual NT  where 2 cuebids available to differentiate strength in the other 2 suits|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: so 3@C just competitive  2@H would show better hand with @C|pg||
nt|rv: 3@c is @c suit competitive, 2@h would be @c suit Inv+|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: danger danger danger|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s would be @dsuit Inv+ and 3@d would be comp from Muller's hand on 2@D by North|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 5@DX-2 or 5@S C just 2 imps difference here|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: mb 5@S X?|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: a chance to go down   but likely diamond lead|pg||
nt|rv: can this beaten on @c lead, ruff,@d underlead and @c back?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 5@D much more down:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: even @C lead makes|pg||
nt|rv: sry can't be beaten|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jaapfr vg: did not pay attention to @DT9853 in S|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: so 5@S XC|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D   800|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: must leave bye all|pg||
nt|rv: here again North could have doubled 5@d to indicate willingness to compete to 5@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: If he makes 5 imps and  73-30 to dutch including 14 imps carryover|pg||
nt|ady: good finish for Iceland|pg||
pc|s2|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in  1 hour   but with different matches|pg||
nt|rv: Icemen have been found wanting in some of the competitive situations, they have not consulted partners often enough|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||

pc|h4|nt|vugraphznu: -100|pg||
mc|10|nt|rv: De Wijs have let them off with discount|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the set...|pg||
nt|athene: south has a pretty nice 12; he might just invite|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N to the bathroom...|pg||
nt|athene: of course if west doubles a 2@H transfer that might alter things|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next session will be at 16.45 hours..|pg||
nt|athene: but they play 2-way stayman over the mini notrump|pg||
nt|athene: and no transfers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N back |pg||
nt|lml: no big deal when you have nine tricks anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Last board now // Hope you all enjoyed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: last board now|pg||
nt|ady: final hand of the session    thx all    thx specs|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Einarsson decided quickly not to finesses @h, queen being more likely with South and ruff pending|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of te session    thx Victor   |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the set|pg||
nt|yuval10: heading to the last board|pg||
nt|lml: nice result for north south ... lets see how Pachtman-Ginossar handle it|pg||
nt|panosk: that is our last board for this session|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but it was two WELL DESERVED slam swings :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not "just lucky ones"|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and so the last, and Jan we owe you much for your great skills on vugraph @H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and a fun hand to finish with|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: last board|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thx a lot for watching...fantastic match|pg||
nt|bt: involving a baseball bat|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: incredibile ...but we will play all|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final board of the 1st session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in 1 hour 25 minutes|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: final board of match at our table    3rd/final session of the day scheduled to begin in about 1 hour|pg||
nt|xenya: that's the end for NZ i'm afraid|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|skaftij:  This is the last match today|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director is here to watch time for the last board, but I don't think they will be punished because of the 10 min for the director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: probably both teams will make the last 8 and they deserve it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: may hope is that Australia will make the last 8 as well :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: see previous explanation of 1@D|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems South would have been better placed with a 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks to all the commentators and kibs|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: now south has the choice of 2@S, weak takeout|pg||
nt|athene: or 2@C "weak stayman"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL = 4 or 5 @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H for e/w looks the spot|pg||
nt|panosk: next match will start in about an hour|pg||
nt|boedhy:  last board|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes all other matches finished|pg||
nt|runnerup: 500 here is good for Nz  but not enougth -ns has to guess well to make any game (3nt)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Thanks Kevin, excellent operator|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|skaftij:  Thank you all kibs for good comments, I was not able to bring all forwards |pg||
nt|ady: thx Harold  and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next match at 13.45 hours|pg||
nt|lml: somebody asked about whether the players know about the running score|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a make n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common treatment over Michaels showing Majors  is to use 2@H/@S to show stronger hands in @C/@D   and 3minor just competitive|pg||
nt|szalay: or: 3m: INV|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@H/2@S: either weaker OR stronger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen that treatment|pg||
nt|szalay: we call it COMB|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lml: 5@h is a decent save against 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S would be a general takeout without spades|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S ..1 off seems coming up :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s = 3@ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s is excatly what he has|pg||
nt|skaftij:  thanks to our magnificent operator|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bob|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last hand of this match. Thanks to our operator Natalia and specs for watching some absorbing bridge.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big win on last board expected for Swedes|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziwny splinter|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwny|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although 5@D can then only 3 imps win|pg||
nt|lechcold: miejmy nadziejê, ¿e nie bêdzie nieporozumienia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or 3nt|pg||
nt|antoniz: 3NT jest dobre|pg||
nt|lml: they dont but they can usually have a feel for how they are doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems flawed in that it gives opponents extra space when cue can be weak|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: maybe if he bids 2@S now over 2red from his partner, that is invitational|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT... the 2 lowest suits|pg||
nt|ritong: garbage with 3@ss|pg||
nt|athene: so double isn't just exactly 4 spades, as in standard methods|pg||
nt|ady: got there quickly    nust know I would like a cup of tea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul 1@C includes weak NT as well as some strong hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the day, we restart at 10.30 tomorrow|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This is the fastest session I have ever seen on vugraph|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thx Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks, last board for the day here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@c must show @d and @s|pg||
nt|wild card: Last board of this match. Next round will start at 13:45 local time (in somewhat more than an hour)|pg||
nt|wild card: is that correct Natalia?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Think so.|pg||
nt|yuval10: answer is of course not|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Thanks everyone, and join us for the next segment|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is only 400|pg||
nt|szalay: not true|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: and if he does that north will go to game for sure with a maximum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why East bid 4@H instead of 1@D transfer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry in Polish dzien dobry|pg||
nt|ady: all games failing for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H the best     but fails|pg||
nt|ady: now at  the only making contract |pg||
nt|ady: west considering passing I would think|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to rebid that ht suit, but really no choice|pg||
nt|leao:  4@h?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  dbl from south standard these days |pg||
nt|boedhy:  I think with all the light opening going on you should have more ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ruud was great company, but it is you the spectators who really make it for us, so thanks @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how did that PASS get in there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: a steal for Israel here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tough to find the slam|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzienn dobry:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzien:)|pg||
nt|lml: in a match like this it isnt always as clear till you compare|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East almost played @h3|pg||
nt|panosk: vugraph schedule in your own local times http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and there a daring 2nt from west... 3nt from east??|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s lead........???|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play a neg. X quite that lite,     |pg||
nt|leao:  hungry 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: good save 5@D e/w|pg||
nt|ady: may take the push to 5@H|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok looks 9 on top |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so who is to blame?|pg||
nt|ady: because I want my cup of tea|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol ...for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming weat holds weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weat???   that was supposed to be weSt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  13  Levin in 6@S East|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: wow..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that will be worth some imps to usa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that after Stefanov opened 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south stil thinking ...do not go away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from other room  "Eighteen minutes left, TD telling the players to be a bit quicker. Levin: "Good one when I'm in 6@S""|pg||
nt|ady: play of 6@S easier after £@C opening|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: we will restart in 50 mins from now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Daily Bulletin always shows the lineup of vugraph matches for the day   http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Bulletins.asp?redirect=1&|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: please rejoin us for more wonderful matches from veldhoven|pg||
nt|lechcold: po tym wicie nie ma problemu z wygraniem 2@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Drijver and Brink are a great pair and have had an excellent set here|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  in OR, still playing no 30|pg||
nt|skaftij:  possible swing to Italy |pg||
nt|wild card: swift surrender by NS|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@D ³atwo mo¿na po³o¿yæ|pg||
nt|ady: specs suggesting diamond lead  and 4@C is down   but  can still make|pg||
nt|xenya: classic reverse by N on 6-3 |pg||
nt|lml: well he has 7-3|pg||
nt|xenya: tes, 6+|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a @d among the @hs|pg||
nt|xenya: could be just 6 i meant|pg||
nt|xenya: now S has a great hand for partner|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2B-2NT = trnsf; according to CC|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: Could make 3NT, 6@D+1@C+2@S=9.|pg||
nt|leao:  it was a very agressive neg x, agree|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think I would lead the @d jack...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink only 7 HCP  but pure fit for partner's majors|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: how do you allocate it?|pg||
nt|lml: we have "both|pg||
nt|lechcold: @CA - lavinthal pikowy i dalej wiadomo|pg||
nt|lml: Weinstein and Levin did well to get to the best slam|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@C is on with A@D right|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and 6NT for same reason|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@c additional chance of ruffing @S good|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it's a good 6@C |pg||
nt|bt: one thing about sloppy play though, its difficult to get back to good bridge|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lechcold: a i bez tego nie ma jak tego graæ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes would be beauty @CA x@S @C for down 1|pg||

nt|yuval10: makes this and it finished 40:36 and 16:14 for Israel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 1 down but lets see|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to guage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C lead @C ruff doesn't gain anything|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: the light overcall drives to the wrong lead, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't know what 4@c meant, maybe finding best denomination|pg||
nt|ady: what but 1 club and 2 spades   assume Zack will ruff high a 2nd diamond?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thot he might play on hearts which fails|pg||
nt|ady: took the save non vul against vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natural trump trick|pg||
nt|szalay: Aof@s, @hs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: and Lindop|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I might also |pg||

nt|lml: I think North might have tried 6@D here|pg||
nt|panosk: our thanks to our very able operator Pim, great job indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: AFR Points: A=3, K=2 and Q=1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: dont need A@D onside for 6@C like I said, @S can be ruffed good with K@H entry. 4@S 6@C 2@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but 6NT does need it so 6@C better|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S has shown 5-3-3-2 and 5 AFR points with the 3nt bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I havent seen an explanation of the 4@d bid|pg||
nt|xenya: let's see how well their relay system will work here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This might be a pickup to Iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: saved by e|pg||
nt|skaftij:  N temted|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tempted|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: north in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, @d King was led|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: probably a double will come after|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @s Ace aganst 4 @h here, if bid would make declarer task more difficult|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: yes the 2NT bid was a killer|pg||
nt|lml: I think west is more to blame myself|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what they would have played the double of 2NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: so USA1 will preserve 10 imps over the last board, still 16:14 Israel|pg||
nt|lml: he didnt cuebid over 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: in fact can make setting up spades    just 2 sspade losers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: last board of this match - and tomorrow the Round Robin continues|pg||
