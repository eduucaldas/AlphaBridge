nt|westjava: good save in 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Sally Brock's 2NT shows a good @S raise|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H i mean|pg||

mb|p|nt|hlortz: just overtricks at stake - time to get some tea :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: this looks pretty difficult to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@S losers and can only afford 1 @C loser|pg||
nt|ahalim: can prubaly make on an endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: run the @c 9 after eliminating @s and @d looks best|pg||
nt|yo_yo: can maybe eliminate @S and @D |pg||
nt|ahalim: yes that works|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the other room Dhondy led J@C |pg||

nt|westjava: ohh sry, that was a phantom sacrifice I think:)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Another potential 3NT?  EW may not bid at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: W didnt do well actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: south did though|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but @S lead, it's off|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: now a real 0akeable game on 3nt  and will be bidden i presume|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: you can play the intrafinesse|pg||
nt|ahalim: alas we shall never know|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: means running @c9 afterwards @cQ|pg||
mb|1H|nt|runnerup: makeable|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the double only cost 3 imps and was worth the possible psychological gain if it worked|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: why would you do that unless you see all the cards?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: dropping W s jack|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|runnerup: a alm here 6nt /@d /@c |pg||
nt|runnerup: slam|pg||
nt|rmb1: I was wrong about adverse vulnerabilty silencing EW :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: because it is close between the precentages of an intrafinesse and leading towards the Q|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|2D|nt|runnerup: some misunderstanding perhaps|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: the 3@D response was constructive, with a bust he would have bid a lebensohl 2nt|pg||
nt|hlortz: dummy's trump are a bit disappointing but we can see that the aggressive style from usa2 has paid well --so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 5 ruffs and 2 aces?|pg||
nt|rmb1: The first set will has shown that there will be a battle on every hand in this match, no chance to relax|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: W just didn t open ;)|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 @h seems strange but ..ok -it stopped this to game|pg||
nt|ahalim: apparently NS don't play ned. dbls|pg||
mb|d|an|strong|nt|vugraphznx: it was alerted, so not strange :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: X denied @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: yes i see|pg||
nt|westjava: random from card generator?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|odysseus69: both tables playing weak nt - common happening in England but not elsewhere|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barbyh: big red cheeks and black hair, thats about it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting the threshold that players set for a 2-level overcall these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: timing has not been best possible -when game is on you are in partial and wise versus|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably 2@c was a forcing enquiry|pg||
nt|mamos: defence have four tricks if they can organise |pg||
pc|dK|nt|lontoh 63: hi all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: 2@c Gazilli has been much in evidence in these championships|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|runnerup: i see -slam not so clear -but makes this time|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yorkbeach:  with clubs 5-5, the @s trick is not running away|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahalim: the indonesian players were once coaached by Kokish, that's why they play weak NT|pg||
nt|alnanda: @h blocked''|pg||
nt|ahalim: this has no change at all|pg||
nt|mamos: West hast to overtake and play @sQ to defeat I think|pg||
pc|dA|nt|alnanda: with no information, i think same result with other table, can't find Q@h|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: additionally many Ws will put in @cK if you lead it|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but the ruff is ...|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|rmb1: I am told "EW are in their late 20's, a product of [the Indonesian] bridge goes to school programme"|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|westjava: you are right, Robin|pg||

nt|westjava: we call it BMS (Bridge Masuk Sekolah = gridge goes to school)|pg||
nt|westjava: *bridge|pg||
nt|rmb1: South must have something for her double: so North could play a trump to @HA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: but the Club ruff might|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West has to hod her cards up and of course not fly with q of diamonds- oops|pg||
nt|ahalim: although @H's are blocked|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|ahalim: but can discard @H on the @D|pg||
nt|alnanda: other room NS play 3 NT make +400|pg||
nt|rmb1: But timing is on NS's side, they have two chances to draw trumps (now or later :))|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: hm, the tables dont seem to be connected|pg||
nt|westjava: a technical problem....it's ok|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|alnanda: yes.., now 1 losser @h pass|pg||

nt|hlortz: hello|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lontoh 63: this was black start from n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: commentator please|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes tricky - because if North bids clubs strongly, NS are likely to finish in 5@c rather than 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: in the OR the Indonesians played the first three tricks in the way needed to defeat  -- but then West continued Spades|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lontoh 63: that|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|runnerup: here normal handling in 1s lead to 12 tricks in @h (or nt ,but that is wrong contract)|pg||
nt|hlortz: well suit quality of weak 2's has gone down over the years|pg||
nt|wstuart: A common treatment is to play 4@S as a strong single suited hand after a weak 2 opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: martel will likely buy it for 4@S -1|pg||
nt|wstuart: That looks likely.|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: in @s|pg||
nt|don_kapu: and all pass for 2@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|lontoh 63: io so cape maklum lah ....... kondisi begini yang kuat stamina yang bisa main bagus ,tapi sama2 US juga pasti so cape |pg||
nt|ahalim: omg a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not always nice to play in a 3-3 fit |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if EW had bid and raised @d, East might lead the @d2 as suit preference|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|runnerup: partner opened and you had 19 hcp -may lead to slam|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: will have to put in the scores manually|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks like a more straightforward make|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting choice by declarer in the @h suit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wstuart: Not much to te play on this one I think.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|runnerup: @d was missed by ew -but it can happen in many secvenses -|pg||
nt|yo_yo: happens a lot when 1NT forcing and west is forced to rebid longest minor|pg||
nt|mamos: easier for us of course because we know Spade honours onside|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: don't know how many degree on there but though cold now|pg||
nt|mamos: but looks like making even if declarer loses a trump a Heart and a Club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trying to decipher the NS leads - presumably declarer knew the @hQ was offside|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphznx: It's about 20 degrees Celsius in here :)|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: East might have bid 2@D though|pg||

nt|mamos: now presumably a @d and a trump up|pg||
pc|d9|nt|runnerup: all boards have been flat so far |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 81-66 is the score|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you have opened arifin?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 2 imps missing for Indonesia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit weak for me to open|pg||
nt|ahalim: with West;s cards ? No|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they seem to lead the 9 from Q-10-9 - zero or two higher leads|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant avoid heart ruff now - had to play 3rd heart before trumps|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|don_kapu: if @S win and return @H will make -1|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: once North flew with heart ace there was 9 tricks|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: 86-81 now, 2 IMPs missing|pg||
nt|westjava: I think so|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the runnung score shown here (142-123) does not take account of a ruling on the previous set|pg||
nt|mamos: flat boards suit England quite well at this stage|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: we still have 7 boards...|pg||

nt|davidstern: So a good battle to ensue|pg||
nt|buddyshah: X or 3@S?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: so much for e/w bidding and making 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: last bord here 4 @s ns with 20 points migth make at least after bad defence ..if you are optimistic -normally some 9 --3 @d is difficult|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2NT certainly shows hearts|pg||

nt|westjava: as usual:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: EAst might open 4@S with an 8 card suit|pg||

nt|buddyshah: Interesting  3@C|pg||
nt|buddyshah: he wants to buy the contract|pg||
nt|buddyshah: 3@C = @C + @S      Inviting  4@S  thans  to Kib :)|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: settled for 10 for push|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  what happened on the ruling was that NS had a RKCB sequence. South showed 1 key card. North asked for the trump queen. South denied it but there was a hesitation involved. North then bid the slam.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mamos: South held Jxxx|pg||

nt|ahalim: N trying to steal the @S;s|pg||
nt|dburn:  this is a good result for Indonesia, since North-South can make quite a lot of clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW have good spade fit but East's @h honours are not working so well - East's 1@h overcall will warn West of this|pg||
nt|blewah: yes. 5@c looks good|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: the bidding looks odd on this board in the OR|pg||

nt|blewah: S hand value has increased a lot after that 2@c|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT wont be a success I guess|pg||
nt|dburn:  at the other table East bid 2@d to show majors, so North-South never bid clubs at all|pg||
nt|mamos: or perhaps it will :0|pg||
mb|2H|nt|don_kapu: or @h 5|pg||
nt|westjava: odd and strange|pg||
nt|ahalim: the operator bid like that|pg||
nt|blewah: 1@d 15-17 bal or 11/12-15 unbal|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: it was just the final contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  choices of 4@c, 5@c and 2@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|don_kapu: woww|pg||

nt|blewah: how did W infered that @s?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|westjava: ok|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok operator error,  easy to do when they play fast |pg||
nt|westjava: every body so tired there|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the operator in the OR just had some difficulties during the bidding :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, South bid 1NT rather than double, so she does not have spades, and North bid the minors so she does not have spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  so maybe East has spades, unless the dealing machine has eaten them all|pg||
mb|p|nt|alnanda: still down, but must perfect defense |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: this is going to be passed out :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed it was, though I would have thought East could bid 3@s|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|odysseus69: defence better be careful - as long as West ducks first diamond East can warn partner off spade return|pg||
nt|don_kapu: according to my brother hood, this is pancake board (flat board)|pg||
nt|westjava: @S9 lead other room|pg||
nt|ahalim: I think blewah shd become operator once|pg||
nt|westjava: tied money policy, moneter crisis, don|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as a passed hand, South cannot be much better than she is. who would be bidding 2@c rather than 1NT?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|don_kapu: flat board|pg||
nt|dburn:  still time to take plenty of tricks for the defenders|pg||
pc|sA|nt|alnanda: Q@h !!|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|blewah: raising directly @c would have work better, it seems|pg||
pc|c2|nt|blewah: i don't think i would be strong enough to do it oom Arifin|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe 1 imp for England|pg||

nt|blewah: maybe the toughest job in bridge|pg||

nt|westjava: teams KO from semi finals play in Transnational : http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=884|pg||
mb|1C|nt|dgame: "plong"|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  at this level you can place a degree of confidence in what the opponents are doing|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphznx: they will play for 3rd place|pg||
nt|dburn:  here is another possible game in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn:  but so far no one has bid those except West|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tough to find after West bid the suit|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:  this game didn't have to make at the other table, did it?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: a playoff that is with less boards than the finals|pg||
nt|westjava: u r right Paul, the others I mean|pg||
nt|dburn:  South may have a chance now, if 3@c is natural (as it should be)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North has the right sort of shape to X 2@s but not enough values|pg||
nt|mamos: south might dbl and N bid Clubs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn:  I guess it did, once South led a spade|pg||
nt|alnanda: @s lead|pg||
nt|blewah: what is 3@s?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn:  but North had not opened, so South didn't know what to lead|pg||
nt|dburn:  but about 1,000 IMPs have been lost in this tournament so far by people who cannot bid the opponents' non-suits naturally|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: and having bid 2D South should run when doubled|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|blewah: i see|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: i think that  pass by S   "timid"|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West's 1@c is either clubs or a weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  and that, in times when both 1@c and 1@d are frequently short suits, is really not very sensible|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it would get an alert where I play|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|blewah: unfavorable vulnerability. a bit conservative maybe by S, though|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|alnanda: next world championship 2013, Indonesia to host , we must prepare ourselves as organizers and achievement|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|dburn:  well, maybe. But if East had held the ace of clubs and West the ace of hearts, 3NT doubled would have made an overtrick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well maybe East would have led a heart - we can maybe all day - I am too old and cowardly to want to be in 3NTx on the N/S cards |pg||

pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|odysseus69: on the other hand I am in the camp which advocates an opening bid on North so no sympathy when passing costs game|pg||
pc|cA|nt|blewah: ruff out some @ds would be my line, can go to hand with trump|pg||
nt|blewah: to table, I mean|pg||
nt|westjava: Venice other SF, France leads 84 - 46.5 imps vs Netherland|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 6 imp ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South might have reopened wih 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn:  they will have a singleton only when 4=4=4=1 precisely - but they will have a doubleton quite a lot of the time|pg||

mb|p|nt|don_kapu: ok pass|pg||
nt|dburn:  not the most exciting set of boards, this - but with the match as close as it is, a couple of part-score swings could well decide the issue|pg||

nt|westjava: so, the new leader, again?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: 5 more to usa1 for this 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|dgame: 2 top controls on @s|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: dreaded slam on finesse board - my pet hate|pg||
mb|2H|nt|odysseus69: Rolands law- bid it when right  dont when wrong|pg||
nt|dgame: dewi is digging it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in reality a fractin less than 50% - 6-1 club break - not massive - reduces it a fraction|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: ABCC in Bali 2012 is open tournament|pg||
nt|westjava: so, this board will be push|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South did not fancy a weak NT in third seat vulnerable with 12 - not sure of the logic for preferring 1@d to 1C though|pg||
nt|blewah: yes to some questions, NS play weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  but on this auction North is marked with the king|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|nt|mamos: nonetheless NS find themselves in a pretty good spot|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  possible pick up for Indonesia|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dburn:  at the other table 1NT could have been made easily enough, but dummy had to discard on three rounds of spades|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|don_kapu: how do you when it is right or wrong ? law of The Egg of Colombus|pg||
nt|dburn:  and declarer kept all of North's diamonds and then misguessed the suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer got the @d wrong at the other table|pg||
nt|dburn:  so that she lost four spades and one of everything else|pg||
nt|blewah: continue with @c now?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|odysseus69: not sure I understand the OR bidding - East did not appear to be doing enough but maye 3H was a max or min over 3C -some play this and 4H is in middle|pg||
nt|don_kapu: in Depok, this bidding style we call Dewi Persik Digging|pg||
nt|don_kapu: sdh finisse again @d, |pg||
nt|dburn:  and South probably has some shortage for the jump to 3@h|pg||

nt|blewah: even 6nt|pg||
nt|blewah: no there are 6 of them|pg||
nt|dburn:  their other pair has not played so far in this match|pg||
nt|blewah: Bojoh and Tueje have been playing in all (?) segments |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I understand There will be an indepth article on The Indonesian Womens Team in tomorrows Bulletin complete with Colour photo|pg||
nt|blewah: Murniati and Dewi next|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: the last 3 boards, injury time, don?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: i dont think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 1NT in both rooms for England?|pg||

mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: I feel 2NT is correct but Sally wont want to miss game|pg||
nt|don_kapu: whats your westjava|pg||
nt|dburn:  if North-South can bid a lot of spades, East-West may find slam hard to reach|pg||
nt|blewah: OK. in RR 21, Bojoh - Tueje were benched|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|dburn:  and North-South have just bid a lot of spades|pg||
nt|mamos: same auction as OR|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  same start in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: so far :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  but West has a pretty good hand - if 5NT meant pick a slam, she might do that|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|blewah: 3nt is an impressive score from Closed Room|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, that jack of hearts may be promoted on the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no West dredged up a pass- or is 1D forcing?|pg||
nt|blewah: and repeated here|pg||
nt|don_kapu: ok|pg||

mb|p|nt|westjava: normal choice of lead|pg||
nt|don_kapu: so many chat to me and i will repeated it|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|dburn:  not sure what 4NT means - probably takeout, but even so...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East must have a near maximum pass to X 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: Nicola might kno w what this means   dont|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  she will not like her @h if that is the deciding factor|pg||
nt|dburn:  ...if this is the way to try for slam in hearts, Smith may be put off by the quality of her trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  she may think there is the @sA and 1 @h to lose|pg||
nt|blewah: 4nt and then 5@h must be bigger than a direct 5@h|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, partner should have five clubs for this auction, and in general when partner makes a slam try and you have the ace and king of her main suit, you should bid a slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  because she must have most of the rest|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good point and East has nothing wasted in @s|pg||
nt|dburn:  for all that, East made a good decision at the other table|pg||

mb|2S|an|3 or more controls|nt|blewah: 2@s 3 controls|pg||
mb|d|nt|don_kapu: but i think USA2 have a 16 imps of CO|pg||
nt|westjava: where will they land on this board, don?|pg||
nt|dburn:  1NT, I should imagine, but if East bids 2@h South will double|pg||
nt|don_kapu: yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS have 31 HCP but no fit|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|westjava: included this score, don|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: carry-over is already included in the score|pg||
nt|dburn:  they have enough of a spade fit that if they could redouble to play, the result would be more than adequate|pg||
nt|mamos: NS need to stop safely here  -- no big fit so should ..... be ok|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@c = almost a game force|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|westjava: ty Ruud|pg||
nt|alunand14: no, Don.......This score includes CO|pg||
nt|don_kapu: ohhh ty for the explanation|pg||
nt|alunand14: thanks Ruud.....|pg||
nt|blewah: 11 controls, can they stop below slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  moreover, that double should enable declarer to take three spade tricks, whereas without it she would not have done|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that's a clever bid by nicola!|pg||
nt|blewah: what is 2@c, David?|pg||
mb|6N|nt|dburn:  South trying for a 4-4 spade fit - I guess there might be a game, but 2@d is a good fallback position|pg||
nt|yo_yo: must be puppet stayman|pg||
nt|dburn:  2@c is Stayman|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Q or 10|pg||
nt|dburn:  North is not expected to show hearts on this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|alnanda: no double no trouble...|pg||
nt|dgame: @d lead?|pg||
nt|westjava: no reason to dbl, Arief|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: West asking lots of questions before leading|pg||
nt|alunand14: and........|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  miracle @h position gives this play|pg||
nt|ahalim: state-of-the-match bidding I think|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe Dhondy's approach in CR is the solution to this hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|westjava: normal lead, but a happy lead to decl|pg||
nt|mamos: well  it is not impossible|pg||
nt|blewah: unorthodox 2NT opening|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, North was probably worth only 4NT, but 6NT is understandable - there should be around 32-33 highs|pg||
nt|don_kapu: but this hand can be make by sq E in @S and @D|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: one agresive biding from Lusye ,that's her style|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS play a 20-22 2NT opening; North was perhaps expecting her partner to be better than that|pg||
nt|mamos: East will have some troubleome discards|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nkgupt: one of the rare hands where 4th from longest is the best lead:)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lontoh 63: sometimes do not like it |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|dgame: could gain 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks in OR  looks a lot |pg||
nt|blewah: with 20-21 2nt, they have only 30-31 in total|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed, but South didn't open 2NT - she opened 2@c|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|don_kapu: imposible to get 9 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: now set up @C|pg||
nt|alnanda: if there is no recording errors, we can congratulate to Indonesia Ladies Team..,  we should be proud of their struggles|pg||
nt|westjava: freak distribution of @C|pg||
nt|dgame: nice chance|pg||
nt|dburn:  not sure why declarer put up the queen - East not all that likely to lead a spade from the king when partner had opened 1@h|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|nkgupt: all this may not help def as dec will be able to count his hcps|pg||
nt|nkgupt: was a great lead if W had not opened the bidding|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|josj: and the Dutch women as well :)|pg||
nt|dgame: does'nt really mater|pg||
nt|don_kapu: dint u see the 8@C stop @C running westjaca|pg||
nt|westjava: yes sir|pg||
nt|blewah: right. that's why i suggested S to open 2NT as Dhondy did|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: this isnt down yet by any means|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn:  certainly not|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: large fish for England|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now we wait for a smile, Indonesia supporters or England Suppporters and i will smile to both :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is makeable, E is caught in a 3-suit squeeze|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West may need to convince declarer that she has the @dQ|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, not three suits - there isn't a heart threat as such|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|d4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|westjava: bravo Om Jos!:)|pg||
nt|josj: ? I did not play...:)|pg||
nt|alunand14: :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes but declarer does not know that|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|westjava: "t" factor, David|pg||
pc|d2|nt|westjava: I know, but you will write all in bulettin:)|pg||
nt|mamos: declare may feel she has to finesse here|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 3 @C discard now|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: oh .. wait one miracle|pg||
nt|mamos: no    ..:)    still on track|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now @H finisse|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: 11 imps|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dburn:  still, clubs about to disappear now|pg||
nt|westjava: (tired):)|pg||
nt|dburn:  she can do that later - she needs the hearts now|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|blewah: @h finesse is on but no entry to dummy for the Q i think|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s3|nt|don_kapu: look like - 2|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|don_kapu: flat board|pg||
nt|dburn:  and will have to guess after chasing the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|don_kapu: take @H ace|pg||
nt|blewah: oh there is @dK|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Viena coup|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|westjava: so, a flat board like a pancake, don|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: the aphorism say that : one down is a good bridge |pg||
nt|don_kapu: yes mr west|pg||
nt|dgame: a push one|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 1 or 2 imp|pg||
nt|don_kapu: if Q = 2 imp, id small @S = 1 imp|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will know that East started with 4@d and West with 3|pg||
nt|blewah: E will be squeezed|pg||
pc|d7|nt|don_kapu: nowwww @D to K and sq with @H Q|pg||
nt|mamos: now @d and @hQ  and East surrrenders|pg||

nt|lontoh 63: yes ... England started with a 10-IMP carry-over so they have in fact lost 32 IMPs for now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  slight clue for the @cA onside is that South might have led a @c with similar holdings in each minor|pg||
nt|alnanda: how about 1 !|pg||
nt|alnanda: how about 1 @c losser ?|pg||
nt|dgame: interesting|pg||
