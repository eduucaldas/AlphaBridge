nt|vugraphzpd: Hi Arifin and Arif|pg||
nt|ahalim: 2NT seems lebensohl|pg||
nt|vbman: when n opens slam is guaranteed|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to reach 7... but 6 should be a walk in the park for these guys|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: first board already an exciting board, minimal opening of N, but nice layout|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: N/S play precision|pg||
mb|2S|nt|viren169: simple J2N|pg||
nt|frankaus: Egtton in early 20's, Gosney just 30+/-|pg||

mb|3N|nt|henryb:  a close question whether to double or bid 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Ruia took back his pass and bid 4@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Welcome to Veldhovn|pg||
nt|henryb:  India is third in the Senior Bowl, USA 1 is tied for 7th|pg||
nt|otoj: hi all|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I really like the dble...|pg||
nt|viren169: ruff 4 clubs in North's hand...|pg||
nt|frankaus: the whole AUS open team under 50 quite unusual|pg||
nt|viren169: It is the 5th trump that make South's hand a great hand...|pg||
nt|vbman: exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: indeed young Australian players|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: E is taking time to evaluate his hand|pg||
nt|lechcold: jak to czêsto ostatnimi czasy bywa, seniorzy s¹ nasz¹ ostoj¹...|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  On the surface 4@s is a very reasonable contract -- down because of the bad red suit breaks.|pg||
nt|3for3: north south play canape with a big club...|pg||
nt|3for3: ew 2/1 american style|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, leading a @d in dummy's suit is not attractive either|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have to go make sure my team is in place. be back shortly|pg||
nt|davidstern: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: this sort of auction usually suggests a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: remains a trump|pg||
nt|vbman: 5th trump also means the queen|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ryskiel_: dizeñ dobry - witam spragnionych dobrej gry i zwyciêstwa dru¿yny polskiej...|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4@H can be made here but not too easy|pg||
nt|ahalim: A small @H from N wbe very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: he played it I think|pg||
nt|otoj: I think that N did that |pg||
nt|vbman: maybe when thinking  he has lost 12|pg||
nt|vbman: ------------------18---------------------|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: they where discussing if they could have reached the grand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: So 2 more IMPs for France due to the bold t/o X from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w piki to wet bez wistu w atu 12 lew by³o mozliwe do uskrobania:)|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S need to be careful on this one...|pg||
mb|p|nt|otoj: otherwise decl had time to establish club for down 1|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jaapfr: 5@S C NS depending @SK first|pg||
nt|henryb:  South's vulnerable overcall is unlikely to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: 4@S looks good here but down on bad breaks @S 4-1 k@C offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I think they started with spade, than twice harts|pg||
nt|vbman: l cant see a way they stop at 3cl|pg||
nt|viren169: a heavy 2@H|pg||
nt|vbman: unless campos tries something clever|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: not an easy board for N-S to avoid getting too high|pg||
nt|frankaus: N had only 10HCP but 27 zars  - only need 26 to open |pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: Hi Oom Jaap :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: hello all|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|roswolf: this is a feisty auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  3!n or 5@d look really cold|pg||
nt|ahalim: hello don|pg||
nt|otoj: a discipline pass by N.. |pg||
nt|don_kapu: hello mr arifin|pg||
nt|otoj: hi Don..|pg||
nt|viren169: and more pressure from West|pg||
nt|viren169: dble again and pass the 4@C response?|pg||
nt|vbman: or pass out|pg||
nt|frankaus: link to zar points - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: a good preemptive raise from W, S has 19pt and normally does not want to pass|pg||
nt|viren169: South may try (unsuccessfully) 3N|pg||
nt|jacksond: little harder to get to slam after opponents have pre-empted|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Schwartz-Finkel play 2/1 with many special agreements in various auctions|pg||
nt|henryb:  Vivaldi-Mosca also play fairly straightforward methods but unusual 2-bids|pg||
nt|vbman: think the raise will help him|pg||
mb|4H|nt|henryb:  3!n is better|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: oj - obawiam siê ¿e to nie obiegnie|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: W making a slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: a safe 6@H save for ew with 6@HX-2|pg||
nt|don_kapu: hi otoj|pg||
nt|josj: selamat malam dari Veldhovend ke Indonesia:)|pg||
nt|jacksond: South going to bid 3NT surely|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S has 4 losers, but in OR the lead was @CA and @C to K and ruff - so Peter Schaltz now have a chance to make|pg||
nt|edou2704:  slam is there, thanks to the @h and @c finesses|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I expect Schwartz will bid 4@s and probably play there|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi mas Aria:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Laska powstrzymaj szalej¹ce konie proszê...|pg||
nt|viren169: Dble is best...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south being cautious|pg||
nt|roswolf: rightly so|pg||
nt|3for3: east should be able to handle this...since south's trumps are so low|pg||
nt|don_kapu: and westjava|pg||
nt|vbman: but .....|pg||
nt|szeryf: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: good afternoon|pg||

nt|pelu: same lead here - and what else to lead from S?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: Good lead|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the crux here is how can EW enter the bidding with their @C@H fits (almost impoossible)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: mosquito killed by Sabine|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: kontrakt ma szanse jak reforma gier hazardowych w Polsce|pg||
nt|jacksond: North was maybe worth one more bid |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: sporty|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, for some questions, Indonesians NS play precision|pg||
nt|blewah: so 1@c is 16+|pg||
nt|ahalim: en goede middag Jos|pg||
nt|vbman: down a few instead of down at least 1|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|ritong: 1 imp away|pg||
nt|blewah: and 2@c stayman. 2@s must be @h|pg||
nt|otoj: hi Liliek|pg||
nt|pelu: after @H to K and A, @S to 9 and now its safe to run @CQ (even if K in S)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vbman: change play|pg||
nt|vbman: dont play queen|pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect Declarer will go wrong in the spades|pg||
nt|vbman: one of famous advices of forquet of italy|pg||
nt|szeryf: witam polskich kibiców|pg||
nt|jacksond: Australians hoping now that slam will fail if bid in the other room|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: my hopes are misplaced - this tanl is unnecessary|pg||
nt|roswolf: tank|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jaapfr: bets on now : 10 or 11 tricks kibs:)?|pg||
nt|josj: hi Liliek, Arifin and Joto :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: a really interesting bidding sequence, with good judgement from N to get out of 3@s x|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  Of course if the N-S cards were switched, 3!n would not look as good|pg||
nt|ahalim: eh ono Liliek|pg||
nt|vbman: l disagree with campos' raise|pg||
nt|szeryf: tu Ryszard Kie³czewski - muszê obs³ugiwaæ dwa pokoje st¹d drugi nick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  down 1, which is actually a good save against a making 4@h for N-S|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|hlortz: was mosca's pass over 4@S forcing?  maybe|pg||
nt|3for3: levin doesnt want arnim in to play 2 more rounds of trump|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S failed in open room...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: this is where players err -south knows no defence works therefore play quickly and conservr mental energy - there is a lot of bridge left to be played|pg||
pc|s6|pc|dJ|nt|westjava: Oom Jos apa kabar..?:)|pg||
nt|smoller:  ok|pg||
nt|pelu: wellcome to Steen Moller|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|3for3: it looks like declarer can prvail, trump a heart in hand...even though the 3d club gets ruffed, and overruffed, the long diamond can be the10th trick... I think!|pg||
nt|henryb:  The US1 team had an easy time against Reunion in the same round|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaapfr: 5 for 11 and 1 for 10|pg||
nt|viren169: not a bad raise at that vul?!?!|pg||
nt|szeryf: seniorzy to nasza ostatnia nadzieja na medal...do tej pory nie zawodzili|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: next|pg||
nt|josj: baik, tk :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: -1 or maybe -2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: if direct going for the cross ruff then 4@H C easily|pg||
nt|jacksond: Australia need a reasonble result in this match against Denmark the leaders in the RR to be sure of a KO match|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|westjava: tuan rumah sibuk, ya..?:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|henryb:  Looks safest to do this: concede the diamond|pg||
nt|henryb:  now S has to cash or lose the @hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: W has a difficult task ahead what to play now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: and thats why its taking time and a lot of sighing from Kowalski|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|henryb:  North may raise 2@h to 3|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W make 6@h unless N-S negotiate a @c ruff|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H makeable and 6@S by NS a good save.|pg||
nt|smoller:  Danger is getting to 5 - big duplication in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: best to pass as E but tough|pg||
nt|jaapfr: best=best result|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|roswolf: well if 4@C IS A CUE IN THEIR SYSTEM I WOULD BID IT|pg||
nt|roswolf: but many play it as a big 2 suiter even in this type of sequence|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S, I think, might make 4@s or 5@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They make 5@S, max.|pg||
nt|ritong: EW do not play stayman followed with 2@s as invite, visibly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now 3nt in right hand whilst @C lead very unlikely|pg||
nt|3for3: that will still lead to 3nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: also if 2@S would be a wjs - a slam try is indicated|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H clearly slamming|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: very quickly bid by the Australian|pg||
nt|henryb:  This can make against a spade lead if declarer guesses well in @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 3nt now imo|pg||
nt|hlortz: well all that wasted @D stuff a bit unlucky but pressing for game not vul seems 'optimistic'|pg||
nt|henryb:  wimpishness has a lot so say for itself: if you had to choose between 2@h and 4@h, 2@h would be most people's choice on the N-S cards :)|pg||
nt|blewah: 6 card 11-15 or 5@c 4M|pg||
nt|henryb:  North has a tough rebid over 3@h. 3@h is forcing - although it does not promise 5|pg||
nt|henryb:  3!n might be right|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: good lead from west here.|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h looks to be down 1: 6 trumps and three aces. But maybe he can set up the long spade while he still has control|pg||
nt|henryb:  @hJ, @s ruff, @cA, @dA -- no. not quite|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: indeed theres a lack of communication for it i guess without loosing trump control|pg||
nt|henryb:  without the trump lead its easy.|pg||
nt|vbman: lead cl win 1 imp|pg||
nt|viren169: reverse dummy for for 11 tricks (w/out a @C lead)|pg||

nt|ritong: can t cancel 40 years of routine so easily, can you?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 2@C in fact|pg||

pc|c3|nt|henryb:  I think 5@s does not make if E-W tap dummy before both their spade winners are gone|pg||
nt|henryb:  declarer's best line now is to ruff three clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|westjava: 4th best without honour|pg||
nt|viren169: Match will be all square after this one...|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@D jeszcze wychodzi³o na wpustce|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|westjava: for Venice Cup : http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=882|pg||
nt|smoller:  More strange not to play a second trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: declearer has the @h7 in hand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no revoke pls|pg||
pc|sT|nt|3for3: meyers will fear going down here...but the ace of hearts is right so all is well|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|vbman: the lead has vanished now:)|pg||
nt|jacksond: of course we see that contract is in no danger but declarer was worried|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jaapfr: but looks realistic to me to bid 4@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|grebrof: this is the second match in Venice cup - I know for sure Sweden won their first match, but I am not sure about England|pg||

nt|henryb:  old joke, with a lot of truth to it. many players are abandoning invitational auctions these days|pg||
pc|h4|nt|westjava: 10 tricks I think|pg||

nt|ahalim: not certain, because Eddy doe not see what we see|pg||
nt|don_kapu: infact whatever manoppo play, always right, finisse @S or play @S to K then play @H and finisse @D10|pg||
nt|westjava: yes sir, that's why|pg||

pc|d4|nt|henryb:  Schwartz has to shift to a @s now.|pg||
nt|ahalim: I told you !!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|roswolf: thinnish 3nt bid and made in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: bidding many close games does put pressure on the defense which sometimes slips|pg||

mb|1H|nt|blewah: i think 1nt with 5M is gaining popularity|pg||

nt|roswolf: expect the same here it is a vul game |pg||
nt|3for3: 4@D looks more normal with the 8 bagger...|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S may enter the auction |pg||
nt|vbman: 1 sp not my choice|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: probably shows both minors|pg||
nt|viren169: Now N will bid 3@H or some good aise in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: good evening Jaap from Medan North Sumatrea|pg||
nt|henryb:  North has a tough rebid, made tougher by three small in opener's suit|pg||
nt|kerasidis: an other 3 @d probably would be usefull|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: E wanted to double but changed his mind|pg||
nt|jacksond: 4Sx is a good vulnerable save against 4H.  |pg||
nt|smoller:  Doubledummy all trick can be made in spades and diamonds - will he get 11?|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H down 3 = 800, but W prob bid 4@s|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|blewah: everywhere in the world but not in Italy. At least all the BB players of that country|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Don dari Sumatera utara:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north considering a slam try!? hardly worth it|pg||
nt|roswolf: and again using up more mental energy|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is incredible - what is he thinking about - the number of angels you can get on a pinhead!?|pg||
nt|henryb:  meanwhile you sell several 6-7 imp losses to gain one 10 imp or 6 imp gain. not a good tradeoff, imo|pg||
nt|henryb:  close whether to respond 1@h or pass. I would pass. but if he bids 1@h, as he did, partner will raise to 4.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: po partii to musz¹ graæ|pg||
nt|don_kapu: if west bid 3nt, Lasul will take 5 tricks @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 6@h wont make|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: an ace and J, I would respond.|pg||
nt|henryb:  not an easy hand to play. but cards lie favorably|pg||
nt|rnmalik: True. Lose a trick in every suit except spades.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Hai, blewah|pg||
nt|pelu: no ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: though its a very good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: you have to ruff one club, but have to draw trumps first|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb:  i suspect it is too complicated for declarer to get it right|pg||
nt|blewah: For the italians, the sanctity of 5M cannot be disquised with 1NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like 3@S is the limit here if Declarer gets the trumps right|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: asking meaning of 2@h means 4 card @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: confirmed by Campos|pg||
nt|jacksond: EW never looked at the save|pg||

pc|d6|nt|blewah: S tries falsecarding|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  It looks as if 2@c was a form of drury.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|don_kapu: cannot - 1, becouse @S will discard from @S|pg||
nt|blewah: and it works!|pg||
nt|don_kapu: - 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: good safe|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is safe because the @SA is right but he dont know that|pg||
nt|henryb:  It will be hard for declarer not to take at least 7 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  perhaps difficult to take more|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now only -1|pg||

nt|don_kapu: maybe some contract in other room|pg||
nt|smoller:  The bidding may be influenced by the missed game on board 5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|don_kapu: but 4@S always by EW|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jacksond: not so easy now|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ritong: either @ds 3/3 or @h ace on|pg||
nt|ritong: guy lasserre will take the lower , in terms of probability, because he knows @ds 3/3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: would not risk the @D finesse and play for @H 3/3 and 10 tricks.|pg||

nt|viren169: Interesting dble... |pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Most people play x of 4@s is primarily for penalty arround here. I guess that's different in other parts of the world.|pg||

nt|roswolf: 10 tricks duly made|pg||

nt|viren169: a few back for the Aussies|pg||

nt|jacksond: Clearly EW pLAY AN EXTREMELY NATURAL SYSTEM|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|roswolf: like that preempt in 3rd|pg||
nt|roswolf: north might pass|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps double followed with @hs would show some goodies, as opposed to direct 3@h weaker and distributional|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, always a problem when threatened with @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: lho simply bids 3@s and you re done|pg||
nt|henryb:  Apparently Schwartz-Finkel play constructive preempts, and Finkel was hoping for something good. He won't find it|pg||

nt|don_kapu: if he drink a blood of lion he will go to 5@C|pg||
nt|viren169: another light dble (passed hand) will push N/S to 3@S|pg||
nt|nkgupt: another hand any agression|pg||
pc|s3|nt|grebrof: "the Viking club" played by Grøtheim and Tundal is probably the most famous system from Norway, but still few players in Norway actually play it|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may play east for a 7  card suit and take the first club?|pg||
nt|3for3: hi again...|pg||
nt|3for3: another slam potential board.|pg||
nt|ritong: thus poizat opts for showing directly the suit|pg||
nt|blewah: Manopo has more than just 2@c, obviously|pg||
nt|viren169: N may have dbled 3@C wishing to compete...|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Is this one of the pairs that play either precision or Polish @c depending on vulnerability?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobh1: i guess @Hs is better altho both make on this layout|pg||
nt|3for3: slam needs little more than a favorable lie in clubs, but as we can see, today they are not|pg||
nt|sybarra: even 3 nt will be a challenge |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S down 2 with x@H lead only down 1 i think:)|pg||

pc|s2|nt|henryb:  if N leads a long suit he gives away a trick|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  6 top tricks, a lot of work to do.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb:  On the other hand, even down 4 is only 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 3@D was 1 or both majors with invitational values and 3@S rejected spades|pg||
nt|jacksond: Well if they bid that one wiith so few points then the Australian EW pair will certainly bid this one |pg||
nt|pelu: so @DQ has cost Denmark 41 IMP :(|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: I have had 2 suggestions that S should win @C with ace |pg||
nt|3for3: well, the hearts are quite friendly, so declarer should be fine|pg||
nt|3for3: that would be a great play!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: maaf|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  He has to try to keep n out of the lead -- at least early in the hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 2nt is 18-20pt, just expl.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: hmm as i thought|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  Fisher and Hamilton did well to stop low.|pg||
nt|3for3: but declarer would still take top 3 hearts first, and come home|pg||
nt|smoller:  This one also looks like down one|pg||
nt|pelu: are u sure - he can ruff a @D now and disc a @D on @sJ|pg||
nt|smoller:  Right Peter|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  Klumpp is being very pushy with his prime 17|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 4@H maybe more than -3 becouse short trumjp in @C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: down 2 so chance India|pg||
nt|don_kapu: nut 4@S is good|pg||
nt|pelu: a very bad final bid by Berg - down on @C-lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dans un partenariat assez aggressif (p-e moins repandu en france qu'ailleurs pourtant), la silence de E sur 1T aurait tendance a indiquer une main plutot plate, alors  la ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probabilite serait qu'E puisse soutenir les trefles, voire les 2 mineurs. donce une intervention par Ouest ne porte pas grand danger|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes and here rough road and where to stop.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: go India go:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now down 1:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 1nt rebid would then be 16-17pt i assume|pg||
pc|c7|nt|henryb:  has already gone too far|pg||
nt|projekt1: Kaisers 3Nt declines all slam-tryes|pg||

mb|p|nt|projekt1: precision 1@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if a bid of 1 @S was unbalanced and bigger hand by W?|pg||
nt|3for3: modern style is to bypass 1@S with 4333...I think this is best|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are right,  she is 4333 |pg||
nt|3for3: east can still checkback for 4@S, i am sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the hand worth a check back? |pg||
nt|sybarra: and aceless 4x1 |pg||
nt|3for3: aceless 11, stiff king of diamonds...but it is a VUL game to shoot for|pg||
nt|sybarra: close  |pg||

nt|nkgupt: the danger on 23 was costly for germany|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: more IMPs for Germany|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobh1: ood job backing into game |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I guess Peter (S) diddnt want to bid 1 NT with only xx in @h here, plus they maybe play 1 NT as forcing|pg||
nt|henryb:  Americans balance more freely than most others|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but there a @S discard was needed to make it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 3@h was not absolutely necessary|pg||
pc|h4|nt|3for3: a matter of style whether west shows 4@S or 3@H first|pg||
nt|henryb:  but Hamilton made it because West mistakenly pitched a spade|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|3for3: here 2@C forced 2@D|pg||
nt|viren169: probably playing on clubs until the cows come home|pg||
nt|viren169: or until the E/W give him an entry to dummy with a @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: egtton flipping over @cQ and @d4 in his hand|pg||
nt|viren169: lol... the Q should have been on the table 5 mins ago!|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W will do well to cash their hearts and clubs and exit a spade.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: now he also considers @sK|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like E/W are playing reverse cound so West will know the position when the 2nd club is played...|pg||
nt|pelu: but play for 3Nt by EW - so even down 3 = flat boards against 1NT by EW|pg||
nt|nkgupt: and 24 too expect the same way|pg||

nt|3for3: well, that is one benefit to bypassing spades!|pg||
nt|lokaty: sz³o 4@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: this looks in trouble now|pg||
nt|pelu: @D lead can kill the discard on @DJ (@c-loser)|pg||

nt|pelu: tx partner :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: yes i would play on spades too|pg||
nt|sybarra: no real lead attractive in the N hand |pg||
nt|3for3: meyers is up to 7 top tricks, with lots of play in clubs and hearts for the other 2|pg||

nt|petergill: is reverse count, except is some situations|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h5|nt|bobh1: for his part, N might have jumped to 3@S the first time, but he didn't want to hang his partner for balancing|pg||

nt|bobh1: good defense by giving a @D ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: North in deep thoughts...|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|hlortz: down this time - selling the 6 imps that henry was talking about earlier if of team stays out of game|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  Schartz and Finkel have been very accurate so far; can they continue -- not necessary to get a @h ruff, though, they have a natural @s trick|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|smoller:  Nice @H9, Jorgensen?|pg||
nt|pelu: in the bidding S has show 6-4 but with a very weak hand he would bid 2@H over 1@S (and not 2@C)|pg||
nt|pelu: better duck the first @h - |pg||
nt|pelu: Steen can 4@H win if W duck @HK and next time play @c10?|pg||

nt|viren169: Some specs want to see some fireworks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 1@d and 1@h was bid at the same time by E|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: bidding card sticked, luckily it was seen before the tray was moved to the other side|pg||
mb|1H|nt|grebrof: Sweden went out vs the later winners China|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h is on the @h guess|pg||

mb|1N|nt|nkgupt: 3@s for EW|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@d double pass 3@s would show that kind of hand|pg||

nt|henryb:  double is negative|pg||
nt|viren169: Could be here...|pg||
nt|pelu: Running score Den No 4 - AUS No 7 - Denmark are 6 VP after USA 2, and Australia +14 VP to India (No9)|pg||
nt|pelu: ok|pg||
nt|smoller:  Hardly 1@H|pg||
nt|nkgupt: now the contra.....dont suppose this slam in @h/@s will have a chance of being bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: wild hand but with @S and @H 3-3 there are 12 treicks in NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: making 6 seems a lot |pg||
nt|santyclz2:  One of the advantages of Polish @c is that @d shows @ds.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (1@d)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: if S hits it can N sit?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: that sud be just =|pg||
nt|3for3: very playable, and as the card lie, makeable 6@H|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D a transfer|pg||
nt|ritong: but it consumes lots of space when @hs can be the strain|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|blewah: it's 20-21 bal in their system|pg||
nt|henryb:  on repeated trump leads, 2@h is probably down|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S anyone?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 25: @D to queen picks up Jx in either hand for 3 tricks, whereas @d to ten does not pick up 3 tricks if loses to king with 4-2 @D|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H shows 6 or more spades|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 2@H is a just a general force... (or an xfer to @S?)|pg||
nt|pelu: D bt N?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a quiet partscore|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe hard to reach slam now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@C puppet 3@H etc i suppose|pg||
nt|jacksond: still lots of boards remaining|pg||
pc|hT|nt|3for3: 6@H much better from north|pg||
nt|ritong: therefore 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: A transfer: X of 1@H would have been 4 or 5 spades|pg||
nt|petergill: No 2@H shows 6+ @S 100% for sure|pg||
nt|viren169: with it being a xfer... they should go more slowly to investigate the slam|pg||
nt|viren169: ok thks|pg||
nt|petergill: I think North will probably move|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: the south hand doesn't look like it's a slam on this board|pg||
nt|petergill: North can be very weak with 6 @S, so South has shown a really good hand|pg||
nt|vbman: 6 looser hand opposite another 5-6 looser, may try|pg||
nt|viren169: North will make another move with 2 bullets |pg||
nt|pelu: B9: Australia in 3NT - Lead @H = making|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry Luc - no ? - just the bid I expected :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobh1: tough at imps|pg||
nt|3for3: since the clubs are with east|pg||
nt|blewah: as they don't play puppet stayman |pg||
pc|h3|nt|3for3: i dont think they will sniff at slam|pg||
nt|viren169: dont like the 4@S bid...|pg||
nt|viren169: wd... now 6@S should be reached...|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C cue, 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
nt|vbman: 2h maybe at least inv'l|pg||
nt|viren169: ...5@D-5@H-6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Nabil Edgtton correctly upgraded his 17 count as too strong for 15-17 1NT. That @D suit is worth more like 9 points than 7 points|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: as south I would write down I would push on to slam and bid 5@d|pg||
nt|viren169: ... I MUST....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: i have already upgrade my profile|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|blewah: if i read their CC correctly|pg||
nt|lechcold: gdyby Laska spasowa³ na tê kontrê...:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobh1: maybe S should pass with his whole hand in @Ss|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then a slam chanceless|pg||
nt|lechcold: by³aby masakra|pg||
nt|lokaty: ko³o 800|pg||
pc|h8|nt|frankaus: WD|pg||
nt|viren169: lol... why waste time!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: i would rebid 2@D instead of 1nt - avoids this inelegant contract|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: y|pg||
nt|alunand14: ya :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lucky guys!!|pg||
nt|petergill: In 6@S, the best play is to draw trumps and try to get the 12th trick from @D, not to try to ruff a club|pg||
nt|viren169: South felt he has to catch up...|pg||
nt|viren169: 2 round of trumps (finding they break) and ruff a @C?!?!|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  4@d looks like a splinter.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  3@c like a mini-splinter but there are several other options possible.|pg||
nt|nkgupt: is a roland slam...abt 13%|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Yes they play stayman|pg||
nt|blewah: puppet, Karen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no|pg||
nt|alunand14: no, stayman|pg||
nt|petergill: The reason Gos chose 5@C instead of 4NT is that it gave Nabil a way to stop in 5@S, if Nabil's 4@S bid had been a puint instead of the real thing |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|grebrof: this is a good contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  If declarer finds out about both black aces before playing trumps, he has a chance to guess the hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  but likely to go wrong|pg||
nt|3for3: once again...wrong :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: its the commentators curse|pg||
nt|sybarra: but n/s have to know they are behind in match, so maybe pressing |pg||
nt|ritong: good luck west|pg||
nt|smoller:  EW will now make 2NT :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong:  |pg||
nt|pelu: but for sure not 2NT from S - bad @C-stopper, and his @Ds not very good - that will cost - 200-300 - |pg||
pc|s6|nt|viren169: otherwise go back to @Ds|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|alpagavp: For the moment France is 9th and China is 16th|pg||
nt|3for3: that doesnt really pay on the WBF scale.  You win or lose VP's regardless of the score of the match, until you are behind a very large amount|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  E has a very unappatizing hand from which to lead and trys a little trickery.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|grebrof: a more agressive E would have bid the @s-suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Paul Gosney likes bidding 4NT 1430 as much as the rest of us, but there is a time (like here) to pass the captaincy of the decision to partner|pg||
nt|szeryf: only lead to make problems for declearer|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... I am sure he would have cue 5@H over 5@D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|3for3: and -41 is not large enough....they would still get 6 vp's for that result.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am reminded,  n/s may not think they are behind,  this table has been pretty good |pg||
nt|3for3: well done...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: given explanations|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy lead from E hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: with screen up so both oppenents are clear|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 500|pg||
nt|kerasidis: should he unblock K@s before playing club?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|3for3: good point..from NS things are ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say, I was not looking at leading a club|pg||
nt|3for3: auken has a tough guess, but she cant go wrong...MY kind of guess|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|viren169: Aussies have the lead!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobh1: better to have played @Ds|pg||

nt|grebrof: that would probably trigger W into supporting at some point and make it harder for NS to bid the slam - maybe|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I can live with upgrading E hand to 18-19 with 5-card@d. and then MAYBE it was possible to find. but still a slam you can do without :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: They are talking about it, he didn't want to make a mistake if it could go down|pg||
nt|petergill: Nabil knew not to look for grand slam, as North would have bid 4NT if searching for grand slam|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  But he can ruff just enough.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 3@c was not a mini splinter, expl at table, 4 card support in @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: N said: I did not know that when the cards from S where on the table|pg||
nt|pelu: difficult position for S - 3NT looks as a fair bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: TD called|pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: This board is again dangerous, 6@d is a good contract but from north hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx for asking karen|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yw|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller:  South called?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no east for time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzpd: Sabine writing about 2 clubs|pg||
nt|3for3: the dreaded 10-12 nt...makes life tough on the opps..|pg||
nt|3for3: most play that double of 2@C here is a good hand...says nothing about clubs.|pg||
nt|3for3: Like she had penalty doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: you need real methods with this range of nt,  and defending it |pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
nt|nkgupt: a sure 4@h and 5@h on @c 10 guess|pg||
mb|1H|nt|grebrof: S does have a huge hand + its not pretty bidding a suit topped by the JT|pg||
nt|alpagavp: quasi impossible to reach|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might get to 6@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  a good slam well reached by the germans in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: make 7, has to ruff 2 D on the table as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: i think Levin wrote as if i had doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: but this is the Venice Cup,  so all systems "on"  |pg||
nt|ritong: not sure poizat reopens|pg||
nt|pelu: who - NS to complain partners bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: yes, almost posible to beat 3 NT if dec makes alot of missguess|pg||
mb|4H|nt|grebrof: so it should be possible to copy this|pg||
nt|nkgupt: any slam played by N will be cold (not 6@h/@c) :)|pg||
nt|alpagavp: and if we play 6@d for south hand the only lead that beats the contract is @c no?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would bid 1N as West, but it is very unclear|pg||
nt|blewah: no game, but N may get anxious with his hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  Double would be reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||

nt|marlowepi: Rebonjour...Veuillez m'excuser de mon absence mais j'ai perdu ma connexion. je crois que mon ordi etait navre par la chute du chelem il y a qq donnes...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: which doesnt have much play even on a non spade lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2NT (Jacoby) or 4@D?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not sure what version of Jacoby the Americans play|pg||
nt|henryb:  Much too good for 4@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C short and 3@D short.|pg||
nt|ritong: passed pard, etc|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@c from S, and then...|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: you right aria|pg||
nt|don_kapu: -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or 3nt even|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: but different if x |pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: W not into bidding 2@c|pg||
nt|alpagavp: the best is to play 6NT from north|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H shows a smattering of hcp i think|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: Arnim writing a lot|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: yes they do :)|pg||
nt|3for3: better than tiny big writing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: two entire little pages now|pg||
nt|viren169: Will E/W bid game here? And which one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  no; 3@c something and 3@d = what?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 4@s?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was wrong. They made 2@s|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  A mini-splinter is typically something like 8-10 hcp, 4 card trump support and a singleton or void in the bid suit.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzpd: director in... 35 minutes left|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty vincent|pg||

nt|petergill: Villas Boas with his weak trumps wisely retreats to 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: a bit of a leap into the unknown!|pg||
nt|petergill: The Dbl of 4@H will guide S to @H7 lead, I think |pg||
nt|petergill: S thinking whether to Dbl 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: south asks west if they play stayman with 5@h4@s or the other way around, west confirming|pg||

nt|nkgupt: well is wat i said ....a good 3@d bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: W did not open in the other room |pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: The tt in Edgtton is because the name was misspelt (on a document?) a couple of generations ago, and the spelling mistake stayed in place|pg||
nt|viren169: Thought Courtney was playing with Harper next year?|pg||
nt|viren169: Michaels Cue bid here...|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Wrong vulnerability for a 5-level excursion.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Pretty tempting though after n's takeout x.|pg||
nt|smoller:  Here 4@H is easy and 5@C shoul also make|pg||

mb|2S|nt|hlortz: you would think so but east liked his hand :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: perhaps " i do not have 2@h and 5@s"|pg||

nt|jaapfr: if no pass now they will go for 6@C|pg||

nt|westjava: Not especially good: 3-2 C plus DK or 3-3D or some doubleton JD.  |pg||
nt|ahalim: in fact due to the favorable @D position you also make 6NT|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@H show 3154|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: effective bidding in the OR, neither N nor S had a bid|pg||

nt|petergill: Australia currently 8th, 9 VPs ahead of Brazil who are 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: he might even go two down if he tests the spades and then falls back on a club finesse|pg||
nt|viren169: I thought Brazil were going to run away with it after the first few bds!|pg||
nt|petergill: For VC live scores, change 881 at end of that link to 882, or to 883 for Seniors live scores|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  To rebid 1nt or 2@c.  That is the question.|pg||

nt|grebrof: having a stiff A in a sidesuit when opening weak 2 is kinda different, but ok - you have to show them @ss somehow|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|pc|d4|nt|henryb:  the N hand? for sure. you can't afford not to|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jkotor: po skoku kierami gra siê nieco ³atwiej|pg||
nt|petergill: Good decision by Gosney not to show weak 5-4 (2@H NF) as partner could not have 3 spades (would bid 1@S over 1@H)|pg||
nt|viren169: what about a 4-4 @H fit (if it exists?)|pg||
nt|viren169: I think Declarer will go down 2 trying to make it here...|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT might be OK if 4-4 @H fit exists, given N's lack of texture in @H and honours in other suits |pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: and he does|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|viren169: -100 or -200?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: nabil touching his ace, @c8 was an ill omen|pg||
nt|petergill: Australia now 6th in Seniors and 8th in Open|pg||
nt|viren169: as S is a poker player... I guess -200!|pg||
nt|petergill: Nabil's card reading and technique is improving rapidly from "top junior" with the stratosphere the limit, given his age (19)|pg||
nt|petergill: He also takes enough time when he has a real problem, looks at it from all angles|pg||
nt|viren169: If I was West I would put my shades on now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: south shaking his head all the time, also looking at opps convention card|pg||
nt|viren169: Does South have any real clues here to play the Ace?!?!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobh1: -1|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: They are talking about the @HQ Ruia played|pg||
mb|1H|nt|grebrof: in the first 9 matches, Sweden has only lost 2 - so this looks promising for our neighbours :)|pg||
nt|petergill: When my team lost to this Aussie team in the Final of the Playoff, I thought Edgtton - Gosney were the best pair in the match.  |pg||
nt|viren169: Another exciting bd...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: chez pas mal d'autorites, E devrait ouvrir d'1SA (si fort) car apres 1C-1P il serait angoisse|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|roswolf: i think the diamond queen was obvious - the keycard response revealed the lack of 1 ace which was likely to be the trump king|pg||

nt|ritong: sur un autre flanc, le déclarant peut choisir d abandonner la @s D|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 29: I think the effortlessness of the @C discard, and the non @d opening lead, were the clues he relied on|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|bobh1: USA finally scored some imps on 11 but they're running out of real estate|pg||

nt|sybarra: I dont see 10 tricks  with the way the hand sits|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: Not from his bridgepartner, very good atmosphere here|pg||
nt|henryb:  X says I want to bid 5@h, but not before you have a chance to defend|pg||
nt|viren169: more micheals cue bids here|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C Michaels, at least 5/5 in majors|pg||
nt|santyclz: I wonder what s's nt range is.  That looks like a weak nt to me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: en tout cas, les américains ne feront pas preuve du même optimisme que leurs homologues|pg||
nt|jaapfr: razorblade 4@C|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4@H C|pg||

nt|viren169: Noth might have muddied the waters here a bit...|pg||
mb|d|nt|alpagavp: Willard must be very carefull here. Nice first step|pg||
nt|alpagavp: The goal is to lose 1@s 1@h and 1@c|pg||
nt|nkgupt: sud be easy w/ a normal safety play |pg||
nt|nkgupt: the @h k might induce a @c underlead|pg||

nt|santyclz: Thanks, I'm told their range is 14-16.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yes, its 14-16ù|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: cant say I agree very much with this sequence|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H=cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 14-16pt|pg||

nt|santyclz: This looks as if it would be much better off in @cs on the lead of a red suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: bon|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT = 3 keycards so East looks for grand slam |pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S=cue|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S was RKCB|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: down 1 here...and 5 more to germany.  quite a high scoring match!|pg||

nt|jaapfr: from his @HQ I meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: :)|pg||
nt|viren169: ok...|pg||
nt|petergill: 5NT said we have all the keycards - can you bid seven?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apres 1SA, il se peut que le contrat soit 2P:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|grebrof: if you can have 6 card minor in your 1nt - I rather bid it at the 3level|pg||
pc|h4|nt|grebrof: NS obviously using Rusinov leads|pg||
nt|grebrof: leading something else might have been better|pg||
nt|grebrof: finding the @s Q is not important anymore - contract should be safe as there are no ruffs anywhere|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, we all would lead @hs, but even that lead might not beat this contract|pg||
nt|viren169: and 6@C said that I think we are high enough!|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot see any endplay or squeeze - if there was one, Tony Nunn would almost certainly have found it|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe too high!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: south kept the tray at the SW side for a while|pg||
nt|nkgupt: after a long germany getting some imps...good for impartials(kibs)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  an imp rides on the lead|pg||

nt|jaapfr: is it sure W will play @C when in with @HK?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|grebrof: if P can bid some sort of Stayman - you normally can make 3@c/@ds OR it is a better contract than 1nt anyway|pg||
nt|santyclz: On a @s lead they would appear to have 9 tricks.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||

nt|ianmcc: needs @h contin|pg||

pc|h7|nt|ritong: mais la question des atouts n est pas résolue|pg||

nt|santyclz: No, their nt starts at 14 so that's probably not it...  I give up.  Suggestions?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: N waved his hands in such a way that 1@d is a weaker opening|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: fielders choice  declarer has only a few tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: good save|pg||
nt|blewah: *said|pg||
nt|jaapfr: therefor I corrected|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@s is artificial, looks for 4 trumps, min/max|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: everyone at the table laughing out loud|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: Denmark in 4@H in OR|pg||
nt|pelu: no play for that game|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess this is the last board of the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no 1 after this board..|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh 16? thx|pg||
nt|viren169: This shouldn't take too long... holding AK(x) you usually dont have a problem with the lead |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: east: "I didn't make the last mistake"|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzpd: wlc|pg||
nt|alpagavp: Again 11 for France. neve won 3NT|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, here has been alot of relä-bids and finaly they will play the same contract as everybody els :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: an OPTIMAL score|pg||
pc|s7|nt|grebrof: nice layout in @hs for NS here  10 easy tricks should be made here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|grebrof: trumps 2-2 too, so|pg||
nt|rnmalik: should be an easy make.|pg||
nt|3for3: well, 10-12 at unfavorable is pretty loony, imo.  No offense to those who do so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 3 rounds of @s, duck a @d double dummy?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bobh1: he could have ducked the @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes with certain dbles you could go for 800 or so |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: almost none playing 12-14 vul, 10-12 would be too much|pg||
nt|blewah: you cannot take side, Pak Jaap. according to the handbook of commentators page 1034|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|vugraphzpd: strip squeezing E?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|grebrof: and the obvious @h-switch comes|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|roswolf: declarer still has some guessing to do|pg||

pc|h5|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  2 down is 9 imps; 3 down is 5 to the US|pg||
nt|ritong: enfin bon, la route est longue et tout le monde a un match creux, c est inévitable|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: difficult to see the play due to sunshine.. will claim asap|pg||
pc|sT|nt|henryb:  Thanks to BBO, the WBF, the NBB, and all the people who make this possible. Including the players and all of you kibitzers|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: cant ask GIB if that works :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ok confirmed|pg||

nt|alpagavp: on board 28|pg||

pc|d7|nt|vugraphzpd: well played for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: couple of imps for the cushion |pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzpd: obviously he did|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mikael_w: would be intrested to see how E/W do in @h. But there is a big risk it will end up in a bloodbatch when the trumphs starts to thin out|pg||
pc|hK|nt|westjava: exploration and investigation play|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|smoller:  Another small swing for USA|pg||
nt|pelu: But with if only 1 @H-loser, nu @D-ruff and correct guess in @S 4@H could make|pg||
pc|d6|nt|santyclz: Looks as if this just fetches.|pg||
nt|pelu: ???? - a fines overtrick sh have cost the contract|pg||
nt|smoller:  Its a lot to ask for, Peter|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: On @SQ lead to that 6@C, declarer later has to decide whether to ruff the @D high or low, i.e does S have singleton club or @D|pg||

nt|sybarra: and thanks to all of the specs for your great comments,   lots of fun |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: last board of this match|pg||

mb|1N!|an|12-14|nt|bobh1: y thx harold|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H looks likely|pg||
nt|hlortz: and its 3:35am here in seattle so i'm off to bed. enjoyable comments and some action hads|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D multi overcall?|pg||
nt|sybarra: something special |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ty! lets see if we get to 100 imps on this set|pg||
nt|ritong: ah haa|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C on @SQ lead: Clubs 4-1 is more likely than @D 6-1, so declarer would get that guess right|pg||
nt|viren169: And finally onto the last....|pg||
nt|jacksond: Last board. If scores in all matches remain much as they are it looks like denmark will finish 4th in RR. Unfortunately for them that means they will nearly certtainly play USA 1 ...|pg||
nt|jacksond: in quarterfinals as USA look like finishing in 5-8 spot and the top thre in the RR will avoid picking USA1|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: tom. the quarter finals will start|pg||
nt|smoller:  Looks like the Copenhagen convention|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I think mainly your P has to be able to dbl/bid 1nt or so if a balancing with those 10hp should be right - but ok|pg||
nt|alunand14: thanks karen.....thanks jaap......thanks all :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  will A make a negative double? yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: on 13, where NS had a shapely 11 opposite 8, they did bid 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h is 5+@h, 5+ second suit, less than opening strength|pg||
nt|hlortz: hands that n key is nnnnnnnnnnnnnnot going to behave :)|pg||
nt|ritong: allez allez!|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks Karen, WBF and BBO (including all kibz and commentators)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is marginal at best|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rest of our friends did fall asleep:)|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C can be doubleton if 4432 or 5332|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Rob.  A big hand for our operator Rob Jetten, great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ty for watching and see you later for the final round of 21|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ty, ty|pg||

nt|ritong: lasserre*|pg||
nt|ritong: si c est necéssaire|pg||
nt|pelu: DEN 2 VPs from 3.place - still 4 boards in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: and lost 5 imps|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = 4 or 5 spades, not 6 spades|pg||
nt|viren169: what do you do with 6 spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: east didn't even dare to support on his 4crd suit|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry I lost connection|pg||
nt|smoller:  Oh, needing 3 covercards from South|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: see you all tomorrow for the next matches, starting at 10.30 hours|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may use the "multi overcall" vs a big club system |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am guessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I think they are yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult auction for n/s to get into, but then do they really want to be "in" |pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: Last board|pg||
nt|alpagavp: the results are here|pg||
nt|alpagavp: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: E asking about S's bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: this looks like a good save for NS|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like down 1, no tragedy when 4@d makes E-W|pg||
nt|ritong: carrément|pg||
nt|ritong: il est vraiment rassuré:)|pg||
nt|ritong: le score final devrait être 18/12|pg||
nt|ritong: pas de gros bobo|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I'm not sure if I read the explanation of 3@H right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: perfect pressure bid 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: and again the last board is an exciting one.....|pg||
nt|nkgupt: one overtrick based on @d 2 way guess|pg||
nt|nkgupt: thx all was a great set for france|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: power bidding|pg||

nt|pelu: again|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|grebrof: 4 @s must be better than this|pg||
nt|3for3: meyers cant be sad defending with 6 trump is always fun|pg||
nt|sybarra: if Sabine passes,   might have been -2 and tied match?|pg||
nt|3for3: i think it would have been better than that for ew.|pg||
nt|ritong: il va tabler très vite|pg||
nt|lokaty: dwa ostatnie rozdania nieciekawe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if 5@H and expected @SA lead N has enough @S to falsecard and E might continue @D in tr 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: In BB sensation China leading Italy 152-139 with 2 boards to go|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|hlortz: even better 3n makes ew also lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D can make except for super defence, @CA and small @S.:)|pg||
nt|projekt1: again a possibility for phantastic defence : @cA -10, low @s -  @c ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Might nip this a trick but it's going to be closer than s expects.  Can e avoid a @s loser?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Double-dummy he can but in the real world...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||

pc|d3|nt|bobh1: EW have a @S game|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2N made it awkward for them to find it|pg||
nt|pelu: 9 toptricks for NS when @D J!= drop|pg||
pc|dA|nt|grebrof: as predicted, the swedish kids at the other table werent fooled into bidding 3nt on board 30 - with a luckyer layout it would make, but streching at nonvul rarely wins you ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: teammatches|pg||
nt|alunand14: jaap, good news from Indonesia ladies : board 28 play 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  with the favorable location of both kings and good diamond break declarer should make 3 or four, winning 2 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: jorgensen appologizes|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: that he had nothing to think about|pg||
nt|jacksond: Notice Rons 1NT opening here|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|grebrof: unfortunately, the lead makes the contract for NS|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The moment of truth:)|pg||
nt|smoller:  Luckily for NS the ruff will cost a natural trump trick|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|henryb:  but a win by 43 for US1, maximum VP|pg||
