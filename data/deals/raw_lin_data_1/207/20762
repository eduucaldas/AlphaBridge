nt|ahollan1: 1N=7-11 HCP, 0-3@S|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: a sort of lol|pg||
mb|1N|nt|skaftij:  In this position, 1NT by East would have been 10-12|pg||
nt|pamela: this opening two suiters seems back in fashion again I see |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it seems but in my opinion its to strong for a weak opening...|pg||

nt|pamela: at this vulnerability  I guess as in life the shape says it all but not much substance to the sp suit   nice partner to have what she has :-)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: EW should finish in  4!   making one or two overtricks|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 4 @h|pg||
nt|vbman: must have a way for a sp raise|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e to powstrzymaæ Jurka?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: they are. 1@D promising 4 came in handy for EW here|pg||

mb|d|nt|star6ija: hello again, now we have all the information correct here, the names the results, etc, right Rob?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2  nt is what we call mini cue bid|pg||
nt|pamela: not sure she meant the 2NT to  be anything other than some leb auction  but with the values she had I am surprised she did not bid 3H |pg||
nt|pamela: ah  explain  please?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: in Nt   12 easy tricks|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: bidding a suit in response to the double would be weaker|pg||
nt|pamela: Ic a sort of rev Leb  then :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  NS should get to 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs lead 2nd/4th   |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: r¹baj waæ|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pos³uszny...Laska re?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s now showing a weak raise, a direct 2@s would probably be constructive|pg||
nt|nkgupt: not really dec willl loose control i think|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: exactly Pamela|pg||
nt|pamela: what  is the value of that way ? |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 nt  is 8 to 12 hcp|pg||
nt|vbman: the lead matters though|pg||
nt|vbman: its one imp|pg||
nt|lesio: jakie re:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahalim: depending who is on lead, they will make the first 7 tricks|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: g³one|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzpb: had to restart, sry, all ok now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: result of the first board is 3@c=|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: welcome again to this session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both USA 1 and China have qualified for the Q finals. USA 1 is 1st, China 4th now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzpb: declarer now sees the 0-5 trump split and is not happy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  will be tough|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: thinking how to play it now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c finesse might see him through|pg||
nt|andyv:  there is very little to the play of the hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: as one may guess, 1@d was transfer and 3@d showing shortness with heart support|pg||
nt|star6ija: declarer has his chances but has to deal carefully with the board, because we have 4 trumps with W|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2 teams that are very close in the ranking|pg||
nt|penseur9: there's also http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-venice-cup with live updates during the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3@d not alerted|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all from sunny London  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  hi Mike-wlc:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two spades from dummy can be discarded on the top hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so eight tricks outside trumps - so it looks like South needs to avoid a trump loser|pg||
nt|pamela: any shape>?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|nkgupt: but def will need to attack @d in time|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rhelle: hello everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: south overcalled 1N in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and DBL 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north has shown @C length  but hasn't passed yet|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rhelle: I am a stand-in commentator, so not familiar with either pair - will do the best I can|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: wlc Rob|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a 3-2 break would be a guess, so declarer might be thinking about a possible 4-1 division - in which case she will come to the right conclusion|pg||
nt|lesio: wist pomocny|pg||
pc|c7|nt|farrukh: but even then e/w should pick up a few imps |pg||
nt|rhelle: this contract will not overly tax declarer, especially with this lead and the @dK right|pg||
nt|penseur9: difficult but this should make|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes   could show her suit later   here thought she did notneed|pg||
nt|pamela: ok thanks .. |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|nkgupt: there it is|pg||
nt|kamyk: na razie wszystko z kontr¹ - chc¹ sobie pokazaæ nawzajem, kto  rz¹dzi na stole?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: Hackett has been thinking a long time  but she doesn't seem to have any winning options|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dodgy start - still, there are 96 boards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, priv|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: you can pick up Q9xx in West, but not in East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so I predict that this will be 1370 and 12 imps to the Chinese|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so, if declarer leads a small trump towards dummy, it would be good for West to play the nine |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there may be a clue in East's 4@h bid - if East has length in the majors, possibly more likely to be short in diamonds - but I don't know how much can be read into that, ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: particularly at this vulnerability   |pg||
nt|ahalim: oops|pg||
pc|c3|nt|skaftij:  In OR, Jonsson overcalled with 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: must prevent S from taking a trick, so he can draw trumphs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: thrumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: each country has his or her own shirts here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Iceland is in yellow, Japan in light orange|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes, bot are on the right side of the line, so we exect tight match here|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rhelle: however, there are some mild communication problems|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi all|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume they explained 2@s as relay asking for hand type and forgot to alert the answer?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|star6ija: both*|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E is playing with another partner today then yesterday|pg||
nt|star6ija: this play of the spades ensures only 1 loser if E was with 10x Q10, K10...the most persentage play|pg||

nt|star6ija: at this high level declarer is warned somehow for bad trump break, because otherwise trump lead is obvious according to the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: in the mean time, N is reading the extended version of the convention card of E/W|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: a lot of chances for S to make this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this is not well played by W; trump is much better|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E has to discard a @h now|pg||

nt|aramesh_:  Hi Victor-wlc:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2 out of 2 finesses for slam - no good but unlikely to bid it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at start of this match  Germany 7th place  Poland 12th|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes sun and ming|pg||
nt|pamela: wang and sun are formidable players..  played against them    they are so intense and focused when they play |pg||
nt|vbman: --------------------19-----------------------|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 9 tricks for E/W|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N can make a couple of @ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW about the same in @hs|pg||
nt|vbman: board 19|pg||
nt|lesio: tak jak bokserzy badaja przeciwnika:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: narazie skutecznoæ karnych kontr jest niedu¿a|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rhelle: looks like EW can make 6@h, whereas NS have a good save (-1) in 6@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: that save has been found at the other table|pg||
nt|odysseus69: fearless 2H overcall -too rich for my taste - maybe thats why I am not playing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 21 matches   top 8 teams advance to knockout phase|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT can be played as 19-21 in fourth seat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which will probably lead to 4@h|pg||
nt|vbman: when some one checks for the vu later they dont get for which board comments are made|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: again not easy for NS to enter the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h=xfer to @s|pg||
nt|pamela: bull dogs when they see an opening to cut you up! lol|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lebridgeur: now EW  wuill not play a @h contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no double - no trouble seems apt here|pg||
nt|cicus: as usual, the hand with shortness acts|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d probably 5-7 with @ds|pg||
nt|star6ija: declarer in the open room had played trumps, but without finesse, so 13 IMPs for USA, thanks to safety play|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: missing 4@h by E/W?|pg||
nt|jaker: pretty routine 3n here|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@h opening in third position is quite normal at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs adjust responses after Stayman-DBL  to clarify @C holding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 0/2 on predictions so far  |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|dburn:  and that is a weak hand with 5 spades and a minor by West|pg||
nt|dburn:  the New Zealand pair using Moscito, a system that does not allow very many passes in first or second or third position|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 @c pass or correct in minor|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 Nt practical now by East|pg||
nt|pamela: looks like another three NTer|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 2@d is no doubt a transfer to @h|pg||
nt|dburn:  some guesses for declarer - normal to pick up spades, will probably lose two hearts, so much will depend on clubs|pg||
nt|benjy: Hi all|pg||
nt|ahalim: this will be a partscore-battle|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: D'Ovidio giving up very fast|pg||
nt|hobakan: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobry wieczór wszystkim...panowie nie dostarczaj¹ nam chwil radoci,mo¿e chocia¿ panie siê nad nami zlituj¹|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: vulnerable 2@H overcall seems to be ' brave ' |pg||
mb|2D!|an|2+!s|nt|skaftij:  The convention card for EW does not explicitly say 16+|pg||
nt|star6ija: very high pressure by North|pg||
nt|fluffy: north rebids 1NT with 5422 wich is also very common nowdays|pg||
nt|penseur9: likely 3NT from E/W here|pg||
nt|penseur9: wrong :)|pg||
nt|pelu: oh 3NT was the last stop for EW|pg||
nt|eweber: open is playing 3nt|pg||
nt|pelu: and in OR von Arnim in 3NT|pg||
nt|pamela:  the lack of Heart support  from Lu should  encourage her to bid it   |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not easy for West|pg||
nt|pamela: no  she will be  trying to decide if P wants the H support   because the original double should show some diam surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and rightly so since this will make on this layout|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, is that not a penalty bid?|pg||
nt|rhelle: lots of top players play transfers in these competitive situations|pg||
nt|star6ija: they may win some IMPs more, due to this 3@ss gadget|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 2 @c Roudinesco|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cicus: true, N had no means to invite|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: a new chance for 3 NT|pg||
nt|pamela: yes   |pg||
nt|pamela: a girl could grow old here :-) |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West is  known to have long @h  after Ns bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: I'm told that 2@d is just a GF |pg||
nt|jaker: we'll probably see a range of opening leads across the various matches. I'd try a heart myself|pg||
nt|dgame: @h lead sets the contract|pg||
nt|odysseus69: many different ways of raising spades these days - exactly what 2NT showed is a matter of p/ship agreement|pg||
nt|lesio: po naszemu magister|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rhelle: I can see the logic of that - 6@c also looks a distinct possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it was expl. as strong|pg||
nt|nkgupt: great lead!!|pg||
nt|pelu: @H-lead even better - would kill dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: only 8 toptricks - and hard work to setup the 9.|pg||
nt|nkgupt: cant see time to setup anything on the given lead|pg||
nt|nkgupt: infact cant see any other game but ofr 5@d making on any decent def|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S is looking at the convention card of E/W for leads|pg||
nt|penseur9: it seems there's no way to recoup here..|pg||
nt|pelu: in 3Nt the are only 7 toptrick with @hs 5-2 - extra trick in S but the 9. tyrick if difficult not playing DD|pg||
nt|pelu: is 4Nt for Aces or last stop?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I think W alerted it|pg||
nt|penseur9: I think last stop... something went wrong here in the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: cant see what she has written|pg||
nt|eweber: theoretically W has the points for her jump to 3@d, but I assume most experts would find another bid|pg||
nt|pelu: easy for EW in OR after 1@C strong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, the 4@H guess was right :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will have a pretty good idea where most of the oustanding high cards are|pg||
nt|vbman: makes 4cl, 3sp 2h , two dia|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  1NT would have been 15-17 in that pos. |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Using standard openings and relays after 1@C opening - 1@D  promises 4 and unbal/semibal|pg||
nt|ahalim: @S contract is actually better for EW|pg||
nt|fluffy: despite being way behind on HCP NS get to play this hand, teh lie out is not very friendly, lets see what they can do|pg||
nt|copeyj: b2|pg||
nt|copeyj: Sorry - private :(|pg||
nt|pamela: oh wow|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a po anglosasku checkback Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: still, with a passed partner you don't have to pursuit nonvul games|pg||
nt|rhelle: now, have they agreed what to do over intervention of 4NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2 popular schemes are DOPI-ROPI and DEPO-REPO|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Was intending to show 18-19 bal|pg||
nt|fluffy: the diamond suit is "frozen" wich means that any player who touches it will olose a trick|pg||
nt|fluffy: teh club suit is gonna be frozen soon also|pg||
nt|eweber: 3NT wouzld have been my choice with semibal hand and many points in the short suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W to S : I thought it would be to play|pg||
nt|pelu: one good news for W - no X :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be possible to endplay East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after a partial elimination   but don't quote me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the problem is vonArnim @C10|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i surely would have bid game after pass pass, weak opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: sorry club suit is not frozen, @c9 protects east's @cJ|pg||
nt|pelu: so as I expected: 4Nt to play |pg||
nt|ahalim: decl will lose 1@S,1@D and 1@C|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  @h switch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South almost 100% to hold the spade ace, so no guess on the lead|pg||
nt|lesio: dobry wist|pg||
nt|lesio: 9@H mogla pomoc rozgrywajacemu|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: maybe he expected 5-5|pg||
nt|dgame: cold then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so after @CA @D @D @S @S @S  @C  west can win|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rhelle: Double=0, Redouble=1 or Even / Odd|pg||
nt|rhelle: it seems they didn't quite understand each other|pg||
nt|dburn:  England rather fortunate on board 2, where they reached a somewhat ridiculous 3NT that had about eight or nine losers|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  although N may continue with @s and expect S to be able to overruff dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: @c10 now - or @H work for defense|pg||
nt|pelu: against 3Nt: @D lead from N - and easy 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: but then maybe @H9 is powerful|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now it's virtually double dummy - expect West to drop the @CQ  |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Muidenberg is called the  opening bid of 2 of a major with a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: probably 3NT instead of second double,|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: same here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fluffy: migry decides to go over diamonds, she loses 1 trick by touching the suit, but she stablishes 2 extra ticks for partner|pg||
nt|vbman: that makes 11 and maybe one from a h , sp squeeze after dia ace is drawn|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rhelle: so although EW miss slam, they still pick up 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: now 10 tricks for E/W|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: couhd have made 6 on heart lead but not now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wygra³oby siê przez kara - ale to mniejsza szansa od impasu kier|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rhelle: so first blood to USA1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vbman: ah no, |pg||
nt|ritong: chicken:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn:  this will be a swing one way or the other, since the contract at the other table was a part score|pg||
nt|dburn:  so, 10 to NZ or 7 to England depending on Wilkinson's view of the clubs|pg||
nt|dburn:  not really all that much to go on - the only suit whose distribution she knows for sure is spades|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahalim: sry 2@D, mistype|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  in W leads the Q@c and N ducks, W should lose 2 @d tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: !10 would have been easy for EW - now they need to be alert|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doesn't need to now |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: maybe now endplayw West?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vbman: heart q is doubleton sorry no connection for a sq|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: saving the beercard|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Running Scores: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl For VC and SB scroll to the bottom of the page, where you find the links to the scoreboards.|pg||
nt|nkgupt: will need to play a @s or @ck to beat it now|pg||
nt|chmitty: On the bidding, 3NT would probably go down|pg||
nt|lesio: jak przez @D?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzpb: will try to check their conv. card|pg||
nt|fluffy: now pasman knows that hearts are certainly not breaking, since @h10 switch is certainly a doubleton, prospects are bad|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|chmitty: after a @d lead the natural play is to finesse @s and play ... Queen @h from dummy|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: it was  something that could be foreseen this Qof @h after the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 11 of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: sry|pg||
nt|lesio: musia³ trafic D@H|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|roswolf: a solid rresult for India|pg||
nt|vbman: palmers discards stop the squeeze|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  S tried for the uppercut which would have worked if N's @hs were A8x|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s succeeded in OR for NS|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: throw in with trump  then guess @H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: a very fair plan - making if @hs 4-3|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vbman: hold what u see|pg||
nt|vbman: that is hearts|pg||
nt|vbman: n will get it right off course|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|andyv:  W will need to hold this to down one in order not to lose board...and now will do just that|pg||
nt|benjy: If south is presumed to hold the king of diamonds then the ace of clubs rated to be with north else south might have opened the bidding, but the location of the jack would still be ...|pg||
nt|benjy: unknown|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i missed the benefit of 1st round duck of @C  so didn't see this line until declarer already made the play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn:  but she went right - well done|pg||
nt|fluffy: defence happy with 2 down, ducking @sA would had been a bit better|pg||
nt|fluffy: I mean 1 down|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|lebridgeur: choice of end play|pg||
nt|pamela: seems odd to not be in game   but  one does what one thinks best at the table.. with information given .. |pg||

nt|jaker: unlucky 3n...hearts 5-3 with the length on lead|pg||
nt|eweber: @h 43 and A1098 in @d with N would have helped though :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table in 3N South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will be much easier contract for declarere|pg||
nt|pamela: long way to go  but the gap has narrowed.. |pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzpb: played quick the last 5 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s about maximum for EW|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS can make 4@h|pg||

nt|cicus: I am told :)|pg||
nt|cicus: big club|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has a very very light take out double here...good shape but low in hcp|pg||
nt|dburn:  this will be a 1@d opening, I guess|pg||
nt|dburn:  four hearts, not four spades, minor suit canape possible|pg||
nt|dburn:  choice of actions for South now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3@s was indeed a preemptive bid, making it imp. for E/W to find @h|pg||
nt|eweber: A1097 instead of Q1097|pg||
nt|penseur9: that was a very costly misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit of violence on the other room, but 5@H scores 650, so no huge matter |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: needs to play in @H here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn:  she can bid 1@h as a distributional takeout, or double as a more balanced takeout, or overcall in her long suit|pg||
nt|benjy: how do you feel about her choice david?|pg||
nt|dburn:  would have doubled myself, with 1@h as second choice - not all that keen on 2@c|pg||
nt|benjy: I agree|pg||
nt|dgame: n-s miss a game 4@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what action over 1D- double or 1H|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym nast¹pi³ wist w karo i w konsekwencji |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm suggesting a heart lead (showing shortage)|pg||
nt|roswolf: and of course @C support|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: even now 3@h is alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: late|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal    1@S=5-7 zz, a) 5+@D, some shortness  b) 4@D(441)|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't be sure but I think S showed @Hs and game forcing values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zz points are:  A=3 K=2 Q=1  [unless short]|pg||
nt|cicus: ah, thanks Al ,you are prepared|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: deas is not looking perfectly healthy; in a electrical chair, hand in bandage|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  but double nd 1@h lead to murkier later auctions than 2@c, which may have influenced matters|pg||
nt|benjy: super agressive 2NT bid by Fiona|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks like no troubles for declarer here|pg||
nt|pelu: easy 4@H - time to make coffee :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: modern tendency is to bid 5 card major - ok when strong enough for second bid - but facing a passed partner and minimum with both majors I prefer double|pg||
nt|ritong: the correct bid is 3@h, for a french|pg||
nt|ritong: also for a german|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east will probably double and in due course bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=2011Veldhoven&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CConventionCards|pg||

nt|fluffy: stansby has to decide between rebidding her good hearts or bidding 3NT protecting @sK|pg||

pc|hA|nt|roswolf: DONT LIKE EAST'S PASS and 4@S is not the best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then pick event/country to get partnership convention card|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, 2@c is supposed to deliver more of a suit and / or more of a hand|pg||
nt|benjy: So you would bid over 2@C?|pg||
nt|dburn:  just about - could well have enough for 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: so I would like to pay more attention to the previous board|pg||
nt|vbman: very cool its no time to dbl 2h for pen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn:  but this lead knocks out the entry to the clubs, so we may well not have enough for 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  although other things are reasonably favourable (e.g. the diamonds), so this will be close|pg||
nt|pamela: seen worse  but there is quite a bit of work to do on this hand .. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with @H 2/1 split its made, 1 ruff and 1 discard. other chance if @H are 3/0 club 4/3 or long @C with @H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eweber: well, after 4@d there wasn't a safe spot any more|pg||
nt|penseur9: this make easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: good bid by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought 2@H promised 4-fit :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: East looking at the conv card|pg||
nt|vbman: a heart underlead?|pg||
nt|vbman: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: now N/S seem to miss their best fit in @c|pg||
nt|ritong: nevertheless, lasserre will drive this to at least 5@c imo|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: did east want a double from w?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|andyv:  now N have to cash out immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS|pg||
nt|odysseus69: which heart to lead - having raised top of 3 is right|pg||
nt|westjava: hi pak Arifin!|pg||
nt|ahalim: hi Liliek|pg||
nt|lesio: wiedzia³ ze wist by³ z dubla i moze oddaæ 2 @H bo dostanie lewe na @C|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  and the contract allowed to make|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzpb: she is moving now to get a good seat, if possible|pg||
nt|star6ija: As Radoslav Radev pointed, 3 in Major weak is used by Eric Kokisch, who is a kind of advisor of strongest US players|pg||
nt|fluffy: sh picks the right one, 3NT is doomed on a spade lead|pg||
nt|pelu: but also 4NT would be a hard work to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W is asking how many @h N has with the 2@h raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: can she have 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: which seems about 80%ish|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  a sizeable swing for EW|pg||
nt|fluffy: it takes a diamond lead to beat 4@h quickly|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|benjy: if she wins in dummy and leads a spade up east has to duck to give the defence a chance|pg||
nt|odysseus69: got to develop club trick - interesting to see what happens |pg||
nt|odysseus69: cashing the diamonds will cause pain to all 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: small @s to the J seems a way to go|pg||
nt|pamela: they are on their way|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: alas very unfortunate|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w³anie|pg||
pc|s2|nt|odysseus69: small club to jack looks better|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fluffy: declarer can't avoid a diamond ruff|pg||

nt|ritong: good stop|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Upmark had option to Relay to get information about South hand, but elected to show @C with some shortness|pg||
nt|dburn:  East opened at the other table also, and South elected to double|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: indeed!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that looked right from here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with 8,9 of @c this seems ok|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spade Q best but no good|pg||
nt|westjava: it's true, @H from decl?|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes that's the 9th trick|pg||
nt|westjava: ohh ya:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@H, 6@D and 1@C|pg||
nt|lesio: z taka rozgrywka seniorzy do OPEN|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn:  West bid 1NT, which ended the auction, and eight tricks were taken|pg||
nt|dburn:  but they were taken by the defenders, so NZ have a useful plus 200|pg||
nt|benjy: this is cold now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not many will bid and make game here|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fluffy: there was still a chance for the defence if simons had switched to spades|pg||
nt|penseur9: one looser in @H, @D and @C|pg||
nt|ahalim: too late|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jaker: if north had chosen to overcall EW might stumble into spades, which I think makes 10 tricks, rather luckily|pg||
nt|fluffy: cos declarer needs to guess if she has to paly @sK or @sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW do not canape with majors    1@H could be 4@H 4@S   so maybe Auken guessed that wasn't happening and liked preemptive value of 2@H over 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: her 1N would have shown 0-3@S|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|westjava: the late @S lead|pg||
nt|westjava: she cant find, cause of 1@S respond I think|pg||
nt|kamyk: i odwrotnie:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: unfortunately I don't know any of the NS meanings  after the 1st 2 or 3 bids|pg||
nt|cicus: seems they do|pg||
nt|dburn:  sure - it may well have been cold anyway, but winning the first spade has certainly done no good for the defence|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cicus: perfect contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this defence, declarer has his life easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: her life, it's the Venice Cup|pg||
nt|fluffy: again there will be a chance if Stansby doesn't cash @cJ soon to discard her @sJ|pg||
nt|lesio: odwrotnie to chyba sie nie da|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: a spec suggests west should pass 3@H - THAT GOOD EASILY BE RIGHT - but east isnt guaranteed to have the hand he has - east failure to double 3@H should have cost him a packet|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in OR, defenders cut spade communication with the opening lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: stansby is afraid of clubs breaking badly obviously|pg||
nt|westjava: one of basic I was learn is, attack dummy suit|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: and actualyy has:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: another good result for India|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they are discussing the explanation|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems ideal to me - and n/s have only themselves to blame for the disaster|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is called|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: by Brazil|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry i meant e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec asks why td called|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is asking sw for explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W / S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: about 3@h bid and explanation; it was only alerted for E, not for W|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it is sour grapes and e/w are trying to win back the board in the appeals room|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 4@s was 1 down|pg||
nt|roswolf: imo e/w were crazy in not doubling 3@H OR INDEED NOT PASSING 3@h out vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3@h could be hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: they played in the wrong suit and they should have just played bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: already some interesting first boards|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done NZ|pg||
nt|kamyk: czas zrobi swoje|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|dburn:  but it will be a few more IMPs to New Zealand, who started this tournament very well, have faded a little, but are still comfortably in the hunt for a qualifying spot|pg||

nt|ahollan1: multi-purpose Polish 1@C   usually weak NT  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: gosh - another penalty |pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: ok thx Rob|pg||
nt|jaker: over 1s opening, choice between 2d and x|pg||
nt|fluffy: the hand ended up with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|fluffy: because after ruffing @c9|pg||
nt|fluffy: and running all trumps|pg||
nt|penseur9: how high will N/S go here?|pg||
nt|pelu: will we see a fight on the 5-level?|pg||
nt|penseur9: quite possible|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I am told   that if decalrer had played  king of @h first she could make it on adouble squeeze I did not check|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: north is subject to a @d-@s squeeze|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@DS = 3+|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Slam on a finesse - the hand I hate most|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N-S congratulate Palmer with her nice play of board 4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: how many spades/|pg||
nt|westjava: where r u come from, don?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzpb: TD is collecting the written expl of 3@h :-)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a nice hand for the majors over a strong nt|pg||
nt|dburn:  North-South play a weak no trump, so this may be an upgrade|pg||
nt|star6ija: and Wests in both rooms chose diferent ways of acting, as well as Norths. US tactics was winning in both rooms, so deserved 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i like 4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, with a correct diamond guess, EW can make twelve tricks in diamonds or spades|pg||
nt|pamela: yes  but to play the K first is odd .. |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah hah|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and leaves again|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: !:-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16 [1/2/3nv]  15-17 [3vul/4]|pg||
nt|ahalim: two easy slams to id|pg||
nt|fluffy: unable to hold 4@d and @sA she must drop a trick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: double-then 5D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|benjy: If i was playing a weak NT here then I would open one with the south hand|pg||
nt|benjy: Ok  you have 14 HCP and a couple of 10s but the 4333 is enough to keep me in range|pg||
nt|ahalim: bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: good morning to all|pg||
nt|jaker: the modern trend is more towards overcall and then double next with this hand type.|pg||
nt|pelu: D= dont bid partner - but sje is weong:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: may have pushed then to slam|pg||
nt|ritong: an other possible shock for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4@H NOT 4@S|pg||
nt|fluffy: stansby is trully loaded, she might be thinking about slam now|pg||
nt|fluffy: the best way to handle the hand now is with 4@c splinter, migry will then know that her @cK is useless and sing off in 4@s quickly|pg||
nt|fluffy: splinter avoids the club duplication|pg||
nt|pamela: but no   there is only one club   in Lu hand  |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes  agreed|pg||
nt|pamela: she cannot do it no matter what she plays needs a cl ruff surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 1-3-5 is outcome|pg||
nt|baldfriede: hello to thisd match|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S is pleased with the 4 trumps of his partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: if the td rules in Brazil's favour it will almost certainly be appealed|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d will require guessing the @s suit or a @s lead|pg||
nt|benjy: and X in the pass out seems normal|pg||
nt|benjy: north will prob be glad to go back to clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: good move|pg||
nt|lokaty: dobrze, ¿e nie zdecydowa³ siê na inwit, bo ju¿ na 3 treba by³o trafiæ @H|pg||

mb|3C|nt|dgame: 1nt is quite in dangger|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting that both Easts opened 1NT with 2362 shape  |pg||
nt|lokaty: czy¿by Pan Leenhardt by³ tak odwa¿nym seniorem?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: this variation of NT ranges is very fashionable|pg||
nt|cicus: among big clubbers|pg||
nt|andyv:  for up to the minute scores: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is interesting to see weak 2 openning with 2 Aces|pg||
nt|jaker: anyone else surprised by the 4 heart bid? |pg||
nt|fluffy: if for example stansby bids now 4@c over 3@s|pg||
nt|fluffy: not migry might think @cK is facing @cA|pg||
nt|fluffy: and overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: never sure of the wisdom of that - if partner holds Qx opposite your AKJxxx, for example, partner will hardly imagine that you have six tricks in the suit |pg||
nt|vbman: something artificial here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: N says; we should not waste time with these hands; 11 tricks|pg||
nt|star6ija: but everything goes if the partner is warned|pg||
nt|pelu: and wrong again :)|pg||
nt|eweber: is she?|pg||
nt|lesio: czy dlatego jest juz by³y:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: widzia³e jak zlaszczy³ 4@h|pg||
mb|3H|nt|eweber: I think D was just cards here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that was a forcing pass I presume|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: agressive bidding by E/W, previnting N/S from reaching slam|pg||
nt|odysseus69: trump lead recommended|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes, pass was forcing, leaving decision to N|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: @D lead will kill 5@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they may have heard you Victor :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 500 good result again for NZ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the chinese bid very aggresive in the other room opening 1@S with easts hand. Ending in 3@C +2|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@h could have gone down 2 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@dX was made in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: thinking how to approach diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: first spade, then diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: asking what the double means|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 12-15 was said|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she has 11pt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems hopeless on this layout|pg||
nt|andyv:  so NS will win imps no matter what happens here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Predictably they played previous in 3D in open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now must guess @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which she should get right|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Director came in to tell they are running a bit late|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2 nt = @d|pg||
nt|vbman: seem so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: toilet break here|pg||
nt|vbman: break after the lead?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  the dbl by S should guide declarer on how to play the @s suit|pg||
nt|fluffy: anyway everything is lieing very well for EW, and they can't lose anything but 2 aces, so slipping a bit wouldn't matter here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|baldfriede: but a bit unpleased too, since with good lie of the cards, as it happens here, game is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|lesio: bedzie bez 1 raczej:(|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: a good slam here - in fact laydown if S plays it at NT (not possible now)|pg||
nt|ahalim: EW have a sacrifice in the majors but will not bid it|pg||
nt|tomi2: non vuln / vuln with 55 in majors many will bid wests hand, even with that weak suits|pg||
nt|ahalim: right and then probably will find the save|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: bessis took out 6@c but put it back in the bidding box|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S attack and declarer must worry that Auken has @SQJ and @DAQ|pg||
nt|vbman: she has 2 dia 3cl 2sp and 2h , but noy before dutch win 5|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: reverse attitude discard-3 down for sure|pg||
nt|pamela: making three for a push |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but they seem to know eachothers style, since they passed under game with 12 opposing an opening.|pg||
nt|pamela: unless they slip up  and then makes 5|pg||
nt|pamela: they seem to have a style that is the opposite to the 'invite aggressivley  accept conservatively'|pg||
nt|lokaty: ale kierowy wypuszcza³ 3 trefle|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vbman: the dias must be looking terrible to e|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: 2nd/4th in middle of hand too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if East might have bid 4@c over 3@s - even so, slam is still far off|pg||
nt|pamela: gee that is a text book breaker as well lol|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cicus: 12 sure tricks without needing the spade finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but since @SK onside it doesn't matter who plays it -- yes, that's resulting|pg||
nt|jaker: defense needs to be careful,trump switch makes things easier|pg||
nt|jaker: q of hearts best now|pg||
nt|jaker: but I think any non-club is ok|pg||
nt|vbman: aaaa|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: takes time to think, long|pg||
nt|andyv:  the other clue is that N has shown at least 9 cards in @hs and @cs |pg||
pc|cA|nt|hobakan: wd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've never played that method|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cicus: this is maybe better than 6NT from N - but 2 IMPs less|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: the other room is still bidding  4 so can't say if 2 imps in play or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: nice switch to @h, but S has doubled giving values|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cicus: the risk of 6@C is a @D ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all in all    6@C looks like a good spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are some transportation issues after @D lead [we know, but Cullin isn't aware that @CQ is singleton]|pg||

nt|rhelle: disciplined pass by South|pg||
nt|skaftij:  CC says weak 2 in @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: can't see what the players ar writing about 1NT|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like at partscore - better play in @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S, maybe longer @C/@D, not 4@H & 4@S [1@H]|pg||
nt|westjava: and u go here by UFO?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: bidding is now faster.....than playing, as stated by Deas|pg||
nt|rhelle: however, North may now not find the @s lead|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 1@H - 1@S - 2@C - 2@D - ???|pg||
nt|fluffy: simons has 3 ways of bidding the hand now, 2NT straightforward, 2@s explaining the hand, or 2@c followed by 2NT conceiling the spades|pg||

mb|4D|nt|tomi2: am I the only one who cant reach the official WBF page since yesterday evening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but D'Ovidio will certainly have a minmimum|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe 3@S is ok for -1 (not red)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I guess W is bidding 4@S now - he expects more strength at the right place|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the limited 1@h opener, EW may be able to stop in 5@d|pg||
nt|dburn:  OK - North bid hearts, not West, but North showed spades|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2c will work fine if pasman doenst pass and bids 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S  7-10 with 4-fit|pg||
nt|ritong: west is not in a position, regarding score, which incites to look for trouble|pg||
nt|lokaty: 5@H od Russyana albo Blackwood, ju¿ chyba dojd¹:)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzpb: meaning of 3@s was asked; natural >3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S is thinking to bid 6@c|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Link to CC's: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=2011Veldhoven&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CConventionCards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so far so good, though 7th trick is to be found|pg||
nt|benjy: i still don't believe you would have upgraded that hand though|pg||
nt|ahalim: I have it right now|pg||
nt|don_kapu: ohhh, donny direct bid to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a large number of pairs in the Bermuda Bowl are playing  1m-(1@H)-1@S = 0-3@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for them  DBL = 4/5@S and they have other bids for 6+@S|pg||
nt|rhelle: that said, both red suits are so kind for declarer, that 3NT always makes|pg||
nt|ahalim: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i think i can read 9-13 on one of the notes|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c is a decent contract anyway declarer will get better use of trumps than the defence I think|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spade lead for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: and wake up a sleeping tiger,don?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E had 5@d as bidding card ready, but rethought about this bid and decided to bid 3@h first (cue, control, natural?)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: looks as if E/W can make 3nt here|pg||
mb|6S|nt|cicus: e.g. 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  2@H for INV+ and 2@S weak  is frequent treatment|pg||
nt|alunand14: 13 tricks now...........|pg||
nt|star6ija: after ruffing will W underlead has @DAce for second ruff?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this should go down; @c A, @c, @h, small @d, @c and trumph again|pg||
nt|dgame: 4@h a bit better|pg||
nt|don_kapu: dont see the posible oh 6@C|pg||
nt|eweber: for the excuse of East can be said that it is difficult for her to imagine that partner has only 5@d for her jump to 5@d|pg||
nt|don_kapu: no, i come here by IFO (identified Flying Object)|pg||
nt|westjava: can u beat 4@H?|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he accepts, reluctantly, the possibility of a partscores swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  might well have done - lots of intermediates|pg||
nt|pelu: can i explain 2@D - I cant find information on CC|pg||
nt|hobakan: minor investigation|pg||
nt|vbman: u have to bid close games when vuln.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pamela: a H lead and this is off  .. oh dear  clubs is superior  this time around |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West seems to have been shy    her partner is  obviously  void in @s|pg||
nt|pamela: oh I am wrong it always makes  only the ace and a ruff  |pg||
nt|pamela: I was thinking 6|pg||
nt|pamela: ( that is my excuse and I am sticking to it)|pg||
nt|vbman: l dont see how this is made|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 4@s 1@h 2@c and 2@d?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: and he did|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and he does cheap insurance!?|pg||
nt|cicus: I cannot assess the merits of such an agreement but it is too popular to be bad|pg||
nt|pelu: tx :)|pg||
nt|pelu: = both majors|pg||
nt|jaker: 6d is an interesting spot. you have various choices for how to handle the hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes 2@H 1@S and 1@C|pg||
nt|westjava: oh sry, 4@H will off|pg||
nt|don_kapu: a @C lead maybe defeated 4@H|pg||
nt|baldfriede: hrd to say what exactly 3@h means without knowing their system|pg||
nt|baldfriede: hard*|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: hard to say indeed, also 3@d forcing or not; it seems non-forcing....|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak to by³o po radziecku? burnyje ap³odismienty?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|skaftij:  Not so much fuss here, straight to the slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  better from South as it happens, this - West doesn't have an obvious club lead|pg||
nt|dburn:  but she may be put off a diamond by North's bid in the suit - not sure what that meant|pg||
nt|star6ija: according to the auction E may ask for Spade continuation though|pg||
nt|jaker: can hope for someone to have Kx or Qx, but if it's east, she can unblock the honor, so you normally try to cash it early, preferably by leading to it, before they see the danger|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N is counting and counting and counting while looking at her cards|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dburn:  she wasn't, but that has blown a tempo for the defence, and declarer can get the long diamond going before the defence can get a club|pg||
nt|vbman: yes sp hook looks ok but maybe she plays on h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes|pg||
nt|vbman: cause sp hook works when j is tripleton|pg||
nt|vbman: dia to the q and h to 9 is double dummy indeed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|skaftij:  This cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: agree, one K off, one not|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: in the mean time, N went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is a little bit dangerous for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: politely asking the Japan for admittance|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit of play in this - but as spades are 3-3, and @SQ is an entry, it is likely to make |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: if she continues @C this will be two off, 2@C 2@S 1@H 1@D|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: wow|pg||
nt|pamela: no double!!! surely that is a forcing pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: well small @H would be interesting from QJ9xx :) will probably beat it!|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my immediate reaction is that it has same benefit of all transfer responses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there is a large group - especially in north america  that wants to apply law of total tricks   so  Neg DBL = exactly 4@S and 1@S=5+|pg||
nt|cicus: that was a popular treatment here even before the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: can't tell why|pg||
nt|ahollan1: momentum|pg||
nt|rhelle: mmmm leading the @dQ is a losign play when South has the singleton K|pg||
nt|rhelle: so in general, when you don't have the 10, low to the J is better|pg||
nt|dgame: u rite kapu 12 or 13 imps for germany|pg||
nt|don_kapu: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the diamond blockage is moderately helpful as well |pg||
nt|westjava: 2@C in dummy in my eyes|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: it seems   that west pass is forcing kind|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she alerted it so it should be forcing by her|pg||
nt|kamyk: pamiêtam frazê: "oklaski przechodz¹ce w owacje" :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn:  assuning declarer plays that way, of course, and does not rely on a heart to the king|pg||
nt|benjy: can't she try both by leading a @D now|pg||
nt|dburn:  she can certainly combine chances in some way, yes|pg||
nt|hobakan: what about 4NT.. it's 4 th step.|pg||
nt|hobakan: 4@d:0-3 , 4@h:1-4 , 4@s:no Q , 4 NT:with Q..|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vbman: yes the percentage l guess is slightly with h|pg||
nt|vbman: ughhhhh|pg||
nt|vbman: operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it is right|pg||
nt|vbman: can still make|pg||
nt|vbman: n knows dec has 5233|pg||
pc|d2|nt|star6ija: we have to point out that 4@s is ice cold contract, so some swing (even double game) is possible|pg||
nt|jaker: can also play for east to have 10x, by leading low to the 8 or 9, and then leading the j (intrafinesse)|pg||
nt|hobakan: 5@c= 2 keys + @dQueen plus one king out side.. may be?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: that is not written on paper as expl.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N has given the decision back to S|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: of course  it is   |pg||
nt|vbman: so she will play a cl|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: has S 2 hearts??? Eastes problem now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: or has he spades (2)|pg||
nt|glen: hi geoffrey, all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: hello all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E has @h A and @s 9 for replay|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: which of the two he will play|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that treatment was defined in the 1970s|pg||
nt|alunand14: if Hartono play @DK, 3 round @H and @CQ : 13 tricks|pg||
nt|don_kapu: and somebody chat me, 4@H always - 1 kecuali lead @H|pg||

nt|andyv:  good night...I hope we get some sleep:)|pg||
nt|benjy: If East had returned a club their would declarer have had to guess|pg||

nt|star6ija: 4 IMPs Japan as far as US pair i the OR played in 5@d for 1 down|pg||
nt|eweber: most pairs play suit pref. when dummy is short|pg||

mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: their range for 2@C=10-16|pg||
nt|cicus: many now play 2@C to show 6+ @Cs right away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would be INV+ in @C, so 3@C=... less than invite  :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: but will they reach it?|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzpb: after a long thinking pause by Deas|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they led a diamond in the other room - West played a spade towards the queen for nine tricks|pg||
nt|baldfriede: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: preempts do their job|pg||
mb|r|nt|ahollan1: i think Peter Weichsel started that trend when playing with Alan Sontag|pg||
nt|rhelle: this looks like another 3NT contract|pg||
nt|westjava: mb they will bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 2C rebid is more usual|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D only weak variety  |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: well, south didn't think long before bidding it|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@D = weak 2. 3NT certainly frisky|pg||
nt|don_kapu: very cheap bidding|pg||
nt|fluffy: another simple balanced hadn rebid|pg||
nt|pelu: still only chance with the dummy she see|pg||
nt|pelu: could never cost|pg||
nt|eweber: ssure, this is what I said, but defense was not as silly as it looks with open cards|pg||
nt|westjava: let's see|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 22 + 8 = 30 and she know that|pg||
nt|don_kapu: can't even make 5|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: must admit i've never seen opener able to rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one spec reminds me of the title of a french book-  when China  will wake up-|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it is certainly key part of Meckwell [RM Precision] and  RM Lite which is played by many top US pairs now|pg||
nt|cicus: makes competitive bidding easier but constructive bidding as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure the adjustment was to improve constructive bidding|pg||
nt|fluffy: depending on your agreements, 1@c-1NT might deny 4@d cards|pg||
nt|fluffy: it that's the case simons might have opted to play 3@c instead of 1NT, but she decided to stay at a low lever this time|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now they may not find club fit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6NT no good|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@h was not a favorite to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @s suit sitting favorably for declarer, 3@s should make...losing 1@s, 2@h and 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W want to go to slam; 4@s is a cue|pg||
nt|fluffy: defence might cash first 9 tricks for down 3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now, let's see if North is inclined to lead her partner's suit|pg||
nt|ritong: as it looks currently, and chances are extremely high it will stay, french opponent will be poland in semis|pg||
nt|ritong: when USA teams have to meet at that stage|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzpb: the USA women play slow|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this will make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this is a demonstration of why 2C is the right rebid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant see how South can bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it seems very hard now to reach the best slam; 6@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the NS convention card makes reference to additional notes, but the pdf file doesn't have the supplementary sheet |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vonArnim will be disappointed with dummy's @S spots|pg||
nt|alunand14: but bad distribution :(|pg||
nt|westjava: 1@S and 1@H losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@S|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 2@S|pg||
nt|alunand14: 2@S|pg||
nt|westjava: agreed:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: [having played some form of big club since 1971]|pg||
nt|pelu: Gernamy in 6@d - no D so 11 IMP for Germany|pg||
nt|westjava: @SJ942|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: ohoh, S trying to create entry for a @D lead, no luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: im sorry missed a pass,|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 club ruffs are enough to win (as we see)|pg||
nt|tomi2: in that 6m hand we see many tables bidding and some making contracts like 6NT or 7 in a minor. 7 Clubs oftn fails because the @SA is on lead, 7@D makes on some tables. Did not spot ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: that the French auction here is so good, but nowadays Blackwood is out of fashion, so well done to them ;)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: assuming 4NT quantitative|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably the @D2 was encouraging..... |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: bd 20 india gained 12 imps but it is subject to a td ruling here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: slowly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: he has to develop a @c|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 5, East lead @d ace so 4@h making, 10 imps to Iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: club ruff|pg||
nt|benjy: I'm afraid I have to go, goodluck England, thanks David|pg||
nt|don_kapu: NS can competitive till 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: no expl. on 4NT given|pg||
nt|odysseus69: easy to reach after 2C rebid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sfoxa:  declarer will soon discover !A onside|pg||
nt|rhelle: The Moysian fit ... with the trumps so well placed, it's bound to succeed as well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  The @s position MAY yield 3 tricks for the defense if S had lead jack|pg||
nt|hobakan: not a good time for rasing to 5|pg||
nt|jaker: perhaps a misunderstanding. When you play both Jacoby and texas transfers, normally one of them is a slam try, and the other is sign-off. The auction suggests that they may have ...|pg||
nt|jaker: been on different wave lengths|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: misunderstanding about 4@h bid, W thinks it was for slam, E to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they just discussed this (in Italian.... ;))|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: :0|pg||
nt|fluffy: they need not to block the hearts though|pg||
nt|alunand14: only 10 tricks in @S or NT|pg||
nt|vbman: ah blew 1 trick|pg||
nt|vbman: 7 for ned.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cicus: he had a tough lead, trumps excluded and 4 small also unattractive|pg||
nt|cicus: I sympathize with him if that matters much|pg||
nt|cicus: there is still hope for NS - a @H ruff and maybe declarer won't pick up spades|pg||
nt|cicus: very faint chance, to be sure|pg||
nt|farrukh: and there was no need for a @h finesse actually...it was just a practice finesse:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems @H finesse was an illusion|pg||
nt|vbman: do you specs notice the dutch pair is playing outrageously|pg||
pc|c9|nt|glen: if FX stands for "special effects" we have had some fireworks already at this table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Farrukh's comment got there first|pg||
nt|odysseus69: on the bidding West should lead a spade - South marked with shortage|pg||
nt|don_kapu: whays lead westjava|pg||
nt|westjava: ok, you r on the right level, Joice (Tueje)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: whats|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: would you guess the @D right on a @C return, Al?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|skaftij:  What is East to do? He covers, and back comes a low @s = guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: very good @h return from N|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|tomi2: germany only in 5@D|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|fluffy: pasman is can't stop making evident that @h10xxx is important, that might be a clue for EW|pg||

nt|vbman: slams are how inexperienced teams loose to better ones|pg||
nt|vbman: ------------------------24----------------------|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: looks like stansby devaluated his hand to a 2@c rebid for being void in aprtner's suit|pg||
nt|fluffy: this sohouldn't be a problem for Migry, she has huge support and invitational or more values, she should bid at least 3@c now, but most likelly 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this cant be right!?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=5-7zz, some splinter  [A=3 K=2 Q=1]|pg||
nt|star6ija: board 21 is another example of adantage of quick entering the auction...12 IMPs to USA1 because of openning 2@h with 2 Aces|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 2 choice of lead, 10@C or @S 4 if i am right|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+  ostensibly 8+ hcp|pg||

nt|vbman: there is a slam gone down|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: so the notes are wrong  or Upmark misbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: players not alerting much. They discussed it before the match, so obvious alerts aren't made|pg||
nt|fluffy: wow, splinter|pg||
nt|fluffy: I guess that 1@s shows 5 cards|pg||
nt|fluffy: otherwise she wouldn't splinter giving up the spade fit|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: pocelowali rozdanie skubañcy|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzpb: E thinks about his hand ...|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this lead, N will actually not need any pitches from the @d suit as cards lie...but still, will set up the @ds for a @h pitch|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will another big swing for NS as 1N was bid and made in CR|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 2@D = not agree of 2@C and South can bid anything ecxept @C|pg||
nt|fluffy: what is she expecting to lose in 6@c I can't understand|pg||
nt|fluffy: well, if partner doesn't have @dQ there is a problem having to ruff too many things|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|eweber: X plus 4@h seems quite aggressive |pg||
nt|penseur9: 4@H could be down one here|pg||
nt|pelu: @C-lead to Q and @DK would defeat, but still problems|pg||
nt|eweber: OPen is playing 3@h only|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: It was|pg||

nt|mdgraham: virtually the same auction next door|pg||

nt|pelu: Hi Kibs - tell me - what do u normal play here?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - South did bid clubs this time- she learns fast|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: good defence shoud beat 3NT   France revival in wiew ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzpb: does 2@h show 6-card? then with 4 trumps can show @hQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think they rebid 2@H with nothing extra to say|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E promised a stronger hand than she has|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: however clarification of 2@c opening unclear|pg||
nt|eweber: oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: well, good lead at least|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rhelle: 1@c is a stretch, as far as I'm concerned. I'd be happy to pass that West hand. 12 points, but such a load of cr.p ...|pg||
nt|rhelle: In the end , I think East does well not to make a further slam try|pg||
nt|andyv:  when W wins @d and returns @h, N will have to put up the K|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: interesting bidding here|pg||
nt|westjava: mb try to play @S now|pg||
nt|vbman: but they are still the favourites|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: seems a strange decision at trick 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: fortunately the @CA is right|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer needs to "unblock" the spade ace next|pg||
nt|skaftij:  BD 6 OR: Jonsson plays 5@c D for a pickup to Iceland|pg||
nt|star6ija: they reached good contract|pg||
nt|fluffy: still IMO she passed too quickly, the hand deserved a deeper consideration|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@H is the right target - trump losers may be a problem if spades are chosen|pg||
nt|farrukh: if i remember these relays correctly, N has shown 6+@s in a balanced hand and his controls, either in standard way or in zz terms|pg||
nt|odysseus69: its all about jack of diamonds|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|don_kapu: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|vbman: l expect an italy-netherland final|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: That is only possible if one of the USA teams loses|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  W will have to shift to @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: even if they tried to find better spot bidding 3N, I doubt E would leave them there having 11 cards in major|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess about 2@D response came from Nystrom-Bertheau Supplementary Notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assumed same relay structure even though they use different opening 2-bids|pg||
nt|cicus: upmark-cullin system notes (page 4) confirm your explanation, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 7   Nystrom-Bertheau got shut out of @S, sold to 2@C South  and Pakistan on the board with 11 imps|pg||
nt|farrukh: if S is thinking so long there may have been some glitch in the relays|pg||
nt|pelu: most kibs: dont play my suit! - bit for sure here Fredin wont @C-lead :)|pg||

pc|sA|nt|dburn:  1@h spades, 2NT spade raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: afraid that east got a@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she only needs four @H tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cicus: as I said I think this is slightly inferior to 6@H but OK now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Masood currently in 6@H but Ahmed still has a bid|pg||
nt|cicus: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|alunand14: lah, menang @S mestinya cabut trump dulu ?|pg||
nt|pamela: imps back to France |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on the same lead declarer played @s and got a @h switch|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W explained his X as " I think it will go down" on the paper|pg||
nt|fluffy: partner's failure to bid 4@s is not bad news after all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: now declarer will have a sinking feeling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H in other room|pg||

pc|h9|nt|cicus: two playing options here - either draw trumps and hope @Hs come in or try to ruff a @D then draw trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since both majors split 32  i think this makes -- just make sure to win this trick in hand that ensures reentry to dummy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't think it was possible for east to ask for aces and Queen, pls correct me if I am wrong|pg||
nt|penseur9: still looks like two @C and a @S looser|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: @s9 in S wd be better|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: @sQ now|pg||

pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: which he's done|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not sure playing 3 rounds of trumps is wise|pg||

nt|odysseus69: East marked with 5-5-2-1 and odds favour Jack with West|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: now relief|pg||
nt|rhelle: declarer has 5 trump tricks, 3 @c, 1@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: and trying to ruff the 4th @c in dummy seems called for|pg||
nt|rhelle: so now declarer is struggling, and needs to do some good guessing to avoid going down|pg||

nt|westjava: again part score|pg||
mb|d|nt|cicus: many would have overcalled an offshape 1NT here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzpb: so no error|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@D majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: standard bidding, 2 @s will be the end contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl looks like it's game forcing|pg||
nt|star6ija: interesting point...all this depends on agreements|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: that was expl. at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: by N|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR 3@D - after same start - made on a Squeeze against E i major|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: DD, 4@h is makeable|pg||

nt|pelu: Fredin hate to pass :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but 3@S down 1-2 and 3@C down 1 on @H-lead (or shift)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: still in the tank|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this will not make|pg||
nt|lokaty: idzie koñcówa, po kontrze ³atwiejsza|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or 1@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, misread the opening bid...simply a negative dbl|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C = 10-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Bulgaria in 3@h in OR|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spade lead would help|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north might regret re opening|pg||
nt|glen: hopefully they can use 2NT here to get to 5-3 @C fit|pg||
nt|glen: or pass|pg||
nt|glen: to get N to pick|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point glen|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Anyone for balancing with East hand? Would end up in 4@s, unmakable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north has best meld but passes throughout|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ze szpicówk¹ po karowym?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: hmm, I expected 4@S from S but the vulnerability biased him|pg||
nt|odysseus69: £NT probably no 4 or 5 card major|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hate to confess i would lead a spade|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North does not want to lead|pg||
nt|ritong: robert confirms|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|lokaty: ju¿ szlemik nawet:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|glen: still 3@C is not good with no ruffing value in the S hand|pg||
nt|glen: some of my partnerships would play pass by S here to play 2@SXX|pg||
nt|fluffy: spade lead was good news in theory, but declarer is a bit stuack in her own hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: she makes if she plays for @h 3-3 and @s 4-3 obviously, but is tehre a better chance?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: found best - I confess I would have led a spade|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: the vampires gather for their feast|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: oeps, this can get nasty|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S??  at which point|pg||
nt|rhelle: A delicate 2NT contract|pg||
nt|tomi2: west worked out partner should be short in @D here|pg||
nt|penseur9: fatigue may be setting in for the Canadian pair since they're only 4 player team|pg||
nt|eweber: 2! was 2way checkback, asking N to bid 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: For the people wondering why England is more in front than the scored imps. There was a cary over of half the imps scored during the Round Robin, so England had 4 imps to start ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  this may be a good save by NS as 4@h can make |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: cross ruff seems an approach to take|pg||
nt|westjava: wow, E fly too high I think|pg||
nt|baldfriede: but again not something that can easily be found, with the two top trump honors missing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tomi2: the small @D might be a mistake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DQ says  "i can win next round of @D"   that means   singleton Q or  QJ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: immediately over the double|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  proper contract (if only NS hands in consideration), and hardly found @cA lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible to find without clues from the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: another chance now for the defense|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  do NOT play Q from Qx|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: balancing double  =  never jump to game   not to mention hasn't guaranteed 4@S|pg||
nt|cicus: I did not consider passing, but also did not look at the colours|pg||
nt|cicus: you are right, 4 spades were not guaranteed|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'm being corrected, apparently 5 member team|pg||
nt|penseur9: 6 members|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice unblock of @CJ - makes things clear |pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: Nystrom opened East hand  1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ahmed playing 2@S North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand much easier to play seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|cicus: very true - drawing trumps results in only 8 tricks if @S do not break|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  apparently, N couldn't have singleton @c after 1NT opening|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however this should make- South in big trouble on run of diamonds|pg||
pc|hT|nt|glen: EW have a zillion years of experience and they know there's blood in the water|pg||
nt|glen: hence everything by NS will get X'ed|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is something to be said for bidding 3NT as South|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually I don't think cross ruff is necessary here, because E knows where all the points are|pg||
nt|jaker: nice lead. Too bad for her the 8 and 7 of spades aren't reversed. As it is, suit is blocked|pg||
nt|alunand14: 3 imps for INA ?|pg||
nt|ahalim: some imps for indonesia|pg||
nt|westjava: @C now, or never|pg||
nt|westjava: sry, the same, -1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  so, E has to find a way|pg||
nt|fluffy: club finese is on, but now there is no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: german south overcalled 3@D and that ended the auction|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trying to think single dummy ....   want to preserve QJ  so  win dummy @H to Ace, @C finesse     i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm in a loop re: just playing @D now :(|pg||
nt|cicus: S was extremely conservative in OR|pg||
nt|alunand14: bad lead from sawiruddin :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: indeed a good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: The dropping of the @DQ will provide declarer with a @C discard.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: they could have let e/w play in 2@S quietly|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h made in OR|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now must play @D to 10 or Q for - 1|pg||
nt|vbman: hmmmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: a kibitzer corrected me, DD 4@h is one down|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sfoxa:  well done|pg||
nt|pamela: so they should be at this level really :-)) |pg||
pc|h7|nt|rhelle: if the @c run, you may well make 9. If they don't, you may not even make 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this isn't strongest defense    i wonder what 5@H said that prompted @C shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if it offered ruff-sluff  seems @DK was least risky and many ways it could be best|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|fluffy: she must cash @dAQ before conceding a heart, else west will play a diamond to endplay her back|pg||
nt|pelu: there are CCs for 3 pairs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  K@c and @c, @h return and 3rd @c to take the maximum no. of tricks|pg||
nt|fluffy: stansby foreseeing this is trhining about unblocking the hearts, kudos if she finds it|pg||
nt|fluffy: obvious danger is, declarer might have @h10!|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well not the case always|pg||
nt|vbman: cl ace will solve all problems|pg||
pc|d5|nt|penseur9: yes sorry|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some credit to Nystrom for opening 1N=14-16  i think might be easier for North to bid more than 2@S than for South to take another call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm    remember to refresh screen to get updates|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy having a very big set against Bulgaria   that puts Italy almost half a match ahead of 2nd place Netherlands|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: Yes she did|pg||

nt|pelu: in my opinion u normal dont need X for penalty - the weak hand can now take out in 5 card minor - I prefer that D = 5 card minor + 4 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: you need it if somebody psyches a 1NT opener|pg||
nt|pelu: and u need to take 800 if u have game|pg||
nt|eweber: this is valid vs wk nt as well|pg||
nt|pelu: against weak NT D = penalty - for sure|pg||
nt|eweber: I play differnt methods with different partners and I can say that I miss the pen X more often then the 4M5m when I play the other sys|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't object to 1@S, 2@S or 3@S in this situation|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na 19 impach?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|glen: does E lead a @S?|pg||
nt|roswolf: from north's point of view couldnt south still have a small doubleton club?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@h was Game forcing|pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h will make on any lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: it also might be made if E decides to lead Q of Spades instead of @D Jack|pg||
nt|star6ija: or as Danny Sprung pointed via black squeeze, which on the actual layout doesn't work|pg||
nt|westjava: little bit different bid until now...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|glen: even though S is hort|pg||
nt|pelu: I cant seew any play for 2Nt - only if NS help declarer :)|pg||

nt|westjava: ...and landing at the same land|pg||
nt|westjava: the same lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzpb: sorry error in the auction|pg||
nt|ahalim: 13 tricks here also|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not this time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  BD 7, Jonsson led a @s. Now a @h shift was required but not found. tough defense|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in 3Nt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Moment of truth in OR, |pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h is slightly better because a @c can be ditched on @s Queen|pg||
nt|skaftij:  OR is 2 boards behind designated time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Interesting deals in this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: very long pause for the outcome, questions asked to N on bidding|pg||
nt|star6ija: some tricky move would be N to play small @c from dummy to put pressure over W if he had the King|pg||
nt|dgame: 6@s cold|pg||
nt|don_kapu: like ice cream|pg||
nt|pelu: lets see here - there are play for 3NT - but hard work - how is 2@hs?|pg||
nt|eweber: Germany place 4 at the moment, CDN 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: small @h now|pg||
nt|pelu: the missed defense in B21+B24 cost Canada 28 IMP!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: only reject  Pass and 4@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: now 11|pg||
nt|fluffy: as long as partner has at least 2 cards in your suit you are better in 2M than 1NT becaus eif he has 3, well you have a fit, if he doesn't, then you probably won't have the entrys ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: to stablish the suit anyway|pg||
nt|fluffy: unless playing in a trump contract|pg||
nt|eweber: small @h would have been my lead in this aution|pg||
nt|westjava: so, a push like a pancake|pg||
pc|s3|nt|alunand14: and same in bidding :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  E may well need the 9@s as a throw in card to endplay N in the @h and/or @c suit|pg||

nt|star6ija: he can afford to lose this trick|pg||
nt|star6ija: so let's see what it will be|pg||
nt|pelu: now 7 tricks on a endplay of S|pg||
nt|westjava: almost|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|skaftij:  celand and China  got penalty for slow play |pg||
nt|andyv:  E up to 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: so 6@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: hard to avoid in this bidding sequence|pg||
nt|jaker: then, if declarer ducks a trump comes through, and if he wins and plays a spade, S can win and cash spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East opened 1@h next door|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzpb: south knows from the lead that west has another diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: so shouldn't go wrong here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but possibility to go wrong still exists for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: north knows west started with 7 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: otherwise south wouldn't overtake|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: depends on the point of view|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|star6ija: N may find it fortunate :)|pg||
nt|dgame: claim all|pg||
nt|don_kapu: time to claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: mine too|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eweber: sometimes it might cost a @h trick, but my experience tells me it is worth the risk|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzpb: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N is deciding in what order to play the tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: Murniati in OR 3 times bid @D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: But E in OR in 3@C - not better|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|skaftij:  BD 8 OR, Kaku in East took the slow approach bidding 3@D iso 4@C. Ended in 3NT so Japan is levelling the match|pg||

nt|star6ija: what about the slam...3-2 is 68 % and @c King onside is half of this|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  though, I can hardly imagine N's reasoning|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but well done by palmer to give them a chance to go wrong|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D=good raise of @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  most likely 3N will be final contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: half time now|pg||
nt|star6ija: even at this high level (World Championship) W may not duck, having doubleton King|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: never accept the trojan club|pg||
nt|rhelle: that is a red-blooded 2@c overcall|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may invite slam|pg||
nt|odysseus69: grand here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hand too strong for Precision 2@C  so  multi-purpose 1@C|pg||
nt|vbman: double , ok|pg||
nt|kamyk: Wspólny Jêzyk?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: after bd 25 25-11 to India|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with passive defense (@h lead) it will go down|pg||
nt|eweber: as far as I know 2@c asked for 4card @h in their sys|pg||
pc|h2|nt|alunand14: small slam from N|pg||
nt|rhelle: after this sequence, North can envisage @c shortage in her partner's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S had a re-double in her hand and then decided for 4@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: still, 4@h is a bit lazy, with this fine-looking hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@c is normally invitational or better - so it sets @h as trump suit|pg||
nt|rhelle: which means XX to show 1st round control looks perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: what would 3@S by S have meant??|pg||
nt|rhelle: we can see that 6@s is perhaps a superior contract|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@h alerted, probably weak, nice treatment when you ahppen to hold that hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good bid by South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play 2@C = 10-14 HCP|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: not easy to find 4 @H here|pg||
nt|lesio: jeszcze moze byc zysk z tych 800:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzpb: but then cashing @cA also isn't wrong, the 3rd spade will go on the @dJ|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@s is natural, I'd think|pg||
nt|star6ija: also with C Jack or with @D JAck|pg||
nt|eweber: so pd will never bid 2@s and this is a chance to escape|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6D?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: more or less on J of @s right|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rhelle: but I don't think South is strong enough for that|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1Nt is  15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW takeout doubles focus on majors, so minor suit distribution often non-traditional|pg||
nt|mrt2000: a comfortable 4@H for NS here|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobrze, ¿e nie lataj¹ talerze:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: 3@H was not invitational|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Japan heading for 4@s in OR on bd 9, East opened|pg||
nt|star6ija: Danny Sprung clearified this openning of 1 @d...always unbalanced with 5+@d or 4441|pg||
nt|fluffy: pasman scared of the 4 levl since she doesn't like the sapde void, will simons show upport at 4 level?|pg||
nt|pelu: very clever :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: good stop|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fluffy: nopes, and stansby steals their 11 card fit with the preempt, preempts work|pg||

nt|westjava: she found it|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: got it|pg||
nt|vbman: 4sp plus one looks affirmative to me|pg||

nt|pelu: not after this lead :) - 13 tricks :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|pelu: in OR Sweden has found the @S-fit as NS (:()|pg||
nt|pelu: playing 4@SD|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very tame bidding by Canada in open room|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 11 tricks available for @C played to best advantage|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if, not for!|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: may lose 2 @C and 1 @H just enough|pg||
nt|vbman: this will a hard hill to climb|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract other room, but EW never in the auction after  1@H-1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: unlucky call by S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: this more like a pairs auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W is not happy with delayed 3@h bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is called again!!|pg||
nt|glen: the thing is N had nothing to think about over 3@D|pg||
nt|fluffy: she might make the contract is she guesses @cJ and trumps|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fluffy: simons playing @hK intuitively but its a small mistake, when aprtner leads trumps she might have @hKxx but she won't lead trumps from @hQxx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much play for this|pg||
pc|c9|nt|glen: 2@H had some risk in a potential misfit auction, there was no way N was bidding again|pg||
nt|roswolf: with screens hesitations are less likely to cause adjustments|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it is about thinking of N and thereafter bidding of S of 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is present bud bidding is not ended....|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @d play will probably be the issue here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10 is losest card that is led with doubleton   i.e. 9x leads x|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see the purpose of 1@S response|pg||
nt|alunand14: 11 imp's for indonesia and draw now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: the brazilians here are rattled i think|pg||
nt|glen: but N had nothing to think about|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W raises his hands on pass of S after 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is a wild shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: pass cards of W are not in sequential order on the tray, TD is now called by N|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as south  - west has lost his cool|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: again fireworks?|pg||
nt|glen: sometimes you need to "calm the fuss down" to think clearly, but the fireworks can be distracting|pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand is all about the @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they are discussing pauses of W, N and E now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: during the bidding|pg||
pc|d7|nt|star6ija: at least 2 IMPs US thanking to the rifhtsided contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sarniak playing 4@SX West|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: there is also a lontg way to go in this tournament|pg||
nt|glen: S thinks "maybe I should have paused too, not be left out"|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wonder if east will consider cashing out for -1!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the pass after 2@s is the issue|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c switch seems likely|pg||
nt|tomi2: France avoided the slam missing the ace and @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: so 10 imps were kind of randomly given to Germany depending on the position of the @HQ|pg||

nt|pelu: 2@H down 1 - card by card same play as here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: risks 3@D from partner|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s X pass 2@c 2@s ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well 6@D OBJECTIVELY is good once east overcalls|pg||
nt|roswolf: i suspect n/s might bid this|pg||
nt|fluffy: asking partner if she is maximum or minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wondeer if Sawicka has bid to show @C & @D|pg||
nt|ahalim: 4@H goes down losing 2@S, !@H and 1@D|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: but @H -1|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: does not look as a favorable score for French ladies but the hand is shaky let us see|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: french pair never bid @s  in OR!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@H might have been a transfer with S, not sure though? or only showing @D?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|glen: don't you need to play @S K83 opposite @S J72 for one loser?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: that's a little over 50%, so kind of random swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, both neither make|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: correct point|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they are honest about this to themselves and the opps|pg||
nt|fluffy: she won't show clubs with 5332|pg||
nt|odysseus69: end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe she'll balance with 5@C|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: south on  2@d cue bidded @h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: yes it might not make!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: tough decision by S|pg||
nt|dgame: cue short in @s|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@c is maximum hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she is thinking about it|pg||
nt|vbman: l guess 4h will be bid|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a second double|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: and 3NT sets teh contract|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very aggressive double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough call at these colors|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: in the end decides against it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: better to have a bid over 2@S that shows 2 suits|pg||
nt|vbman: winning first dia from n with ace is vastly important|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: 5@D = hand so bad I will remove room to bid blackwood|pg||
nt|pelu: I see: alert SW on 2Nt - but prob no alert by N|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S whispered: "minors"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  DBL or 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: in that case they never showed spades:)|pg||
nt|ritong: now north under the spotlights|pg||
nt|ritong: might emerge with 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed glen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction will NOT be duplicated since  Nystrom's 1/2/3 seat favorable 1N=10-12|pg||
nt|andyv:  the QJ@d made N put on the brakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  in this auction, the lead should be read as a singleton...W would otherwise lead a top @d|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is your everyday 1NT-2NT-3NT auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm  the diamond stopper appears a bit diaphanous  |pg||
pc|h6|nt|sfoxa:  but defence isn't a pleasant walk, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: palmer not enquiring about the 1NT range here|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt hard work, but on @H-lead S can make 4@S (DD: @HQ + 3x@S from top)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this is going too high for e/w|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzpb: nice though|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W seems to be in trance now|pg||
nt|dgame: oh no|pg||
nt|alnanda: good overcall 1@s from E with only 4 card|pg||
nt|ritong: opts for low road|pg||
pc|hK|nt|skaftij:  this should make an overtrick or 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  S did not read it that way|pg||
nt|tomi2: this is an interesting spot, they have two 8 card fits. in clubs they even have all spotcards but one defender holds the "straight flush"|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont like that lead - my 3rd choice|pg||
nt|mrt2000: think it takes a trump lead to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|ritong: a good choice here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hobakan: 5 card Majör include 2NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: apparantly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: expl was asked and given at the table|pg||
nt|pelu: almost fee fines - later she can discard her @C-loser|pg||
nt|pelu: tree finess|pg||
nt|pelu: free :)|pg||
nt|eweber: @hQ can't cost much, except for a poss @d ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: S know that East has !A or K, so finess with odds|pg||
nt|pelu: @DA (K)|pg||
nt|eweber: right 17 HCP missing only|pg||
nt|pelu: also lead 3. best so ) here promise K|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: in the play 4 @S probably it in E should make it|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rhelle: I'm not sure playing the @sK, when you know the ace is behind, is that great a play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: 9@D upside-down attitude|pg||
nt|star6ija: they avoided the risky contract of 4@h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tomi2: @SK onside but spades 4-1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hey everyone hey peter:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Hi Andreas|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: sorry partner -- don't like those either|pg||
nt|dgame: 6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: should still be 2 down - |pg||
pc|d7|nt|alunand14: but make her partner chase up 4@S : arief :)|pg||
nt|westjava: how about @S lead on this contract?|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, @S now I think|pg||
nt|alunand14: better lead @S|pg||
nt|alnanda: guess @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i think @H|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: we will have a new leader after this board         I better leave you   Iam not a mascott for french team|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|westjava: no good reason to lead others|pg||
nt|westjava: well dune|pg||
nt|dgame: need playing @s twice befor playing the @h|pg||
nt|mrt2000: it's not beaten yet|pg||
nt|westjava: yes|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|tomi2: including the spade finesse and the dropping 8 they have 4@S 4@C and two aces, so they need two ruffs, but then trumps 4-1 might cause problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: if i can read the notes correctly, south is telling that 3@h showed fit and short @d|pg||
nt|tomi2: don't understand wests double here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: at least i can read ' 4315' |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahalim: I think W thought E was on lead :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: my (and for some other ones as well) first thought was, she forgot to be on lead hersef and wanted to get a club lead from partner|pg||
nt|lokaty: znajdzie to karo?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: why that - ??|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rhelle: there are 2 discards in dummy ... but only 1 entry. How to draw trumps and get to dummy?|pg||
nt|vbman: cl return maybe sets|pg||
pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: might as well take ace and exit with diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DJ should have prevented @CA play  -- but what other choice was there?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vbman: 2|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andreasw:  haha:))|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: probably @SQ as exit|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|pelu: against best defense 1NT could go down : @S from W in on @HA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzpb: kamer 21|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might as well play heart to 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: difficult contract for E, she has to decide to stay in dummy or not |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: ruilen....?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better to stay and play heart from table|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eweber: she probably counted 9 tricks|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 650  China|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andreasw:  did not see the entire hand:) was looking at board 27 and 4@s seems only to be down 1?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: enjoy bye all|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the best S's move seems to cash @hA and play a @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this line allows N to get her @c trick|pg||
nt|dgame: set 1|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|pelu: only 5 tricks played - I exp down 2|pg||

mb|1N|nt|hobakan: i have to go..|pg||
nt|hobakan: thx all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: just now, they were waiting for E to bid, but the bidding tray was on the wrong side|pg||
nt|fluffy: you don't like partner to preempt before you when you hold KQJ10xxx|pg||
nt|pelu: easy to play and sh also be easy to bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: weak NT got its money back|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  West uncertain about defense in majors, give 'em five!|pg||
nt|star6ija: good result for Japan in the OR|pg||
nt|fluffy: but that's what just happened|pg||
nt|fluffy: simons has an obvious take out double|pg||

nt|lokaty: na razie|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|fluffy: and stansby has options on pass, 4@h and 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  kibs agree and so does Magnusson|pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h will have a hard time|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 6@c is the ' easier ' contract|pg||
nt|skaftij:  beaten for certain with @d lead and contiuation when in with @s king|pg||
nt|skaftij:   continuation|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@s looks like a flat here unless e-w feels like 5@h could be a good sacrefise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure what the EW defence to 1NT is, sry|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: well i would have opened a weak 2/muti as north but 1@S is not a sin|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hope that East has left for a beak|pg||
nt|hedyg:  catching up with the crash|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: sorry all, but i couldn't load the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: so i had to restart|pg||
nt|pelu: Trick 6: @SQ from S, @SK from W and @SA from East :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: back to pasman who can bid pass or 4@s|pg||
nt|fluffy: and she goes quietly since she is balanced|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is a good general rule when responding to take out doubles at high level, pass if you are balanced|pg||
nt|fluffy: here sadly, one or partner's aces isn't cashing, and @sQ is useless, and 4@c will make in comfort|pg||
nt|eweber: a good moment to thank our vuegraph operator who is doing an excellent job here, not only telling what is going on at the table but also helping the commentators with the analysis ...|pg||
nt|eweber: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+  and this is as strong as the opening gets|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@C alerted by west but not by east|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: it is a very relaxing sphere and especially N is in for a talk/laugh|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes Paul Orth doing a great job|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@c was Bergen - only invit to 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 4@H & 5+@C  b) 5@H & 4+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: close enough|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but we can surmise that it doesn;t include penalty doubles of strong NT's (assuming that was a strong NT) |pg||
nt|dgame: 2@c for nine minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: if i read it well 1@D showed both majors but im not sure about it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N not forcing    DBL obviously takeout  a great treatment, especially in context of Big Club|pg||
nt|cicus: modern informatory double in a traditionally penalty double situation|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i just find that amazing!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they don't have a bid for 4441|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzpb: long thinking by S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good pairs spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N is explaining the bidding sequence (on paper) to E|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am told that 2D was forcing Stayman and not the screen explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: could not read the complete expl, sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but 2@s is gf|pg||
nt|dgame: 2@c is the best contract|pg||
nt|ritong: but lasserre will learn about lacking @d K|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: in the meantime, in the Bermuda Bowl, Holland has just overtaken Italy to take first place (based on current scores)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  ah|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Certain to win now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: a normal @d start would have been much better for E/W|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Magnusson wanted to establish a @s trick before the rats got at it, @cs threatening|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Questionable lead, certainly when all 52 cards visible :-) |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it is always easy for me :-)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Give the good guys some advice pls|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: after the match :-P|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and they play a lot better than me !|pg||

nt|skaftij:  Why not play low? Pls whisper to saouth|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: to make it, he must lay high|pg||
nt|skaftij:  He needs to do more than that|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 8 cant cost|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice stop|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@C still ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: long thinking by E and asking about hand of N (can she have one @d)|pg||
nt|eweber: Paul is also a very competent player, we might see him in Bermuda some day...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 28  5@S made!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CA lead|pg||
nt|westjava: but I dont like 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: would 3@H not have been enough?|pg||
nt|dgame: nice contract|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 5@C has play|pg||
nt|baldfriede: a switch to a low @d would set 3nt, but S can not know that|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes, E ducked the first @s|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: That is no rumour|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@CX is better but still 5 top losers vulnerable will be 800 against nothing|pg||
nt|cicus: did it end there?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the question is whether she feels she has enough to try for 3N.|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: they alerted 2@c because it was not-forcing|pg||

pc|cK|nt|roswolf: this seems doomed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky N found @dA by partner, not the @cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  E's 1N bid may actually have helped NS|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  good lead to knock out an entry into the N hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they have time trouble 3boards in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|jaker: in the other room, west passed the 2d opening, and NS got to a very reasonable 4h contract, which i guess failed on a club ruff|pg||
nt|mrt2000: this will be ugly ............|pg||
pc|c6|nt|glen: now can develop @C suit for @D discard|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson could bid 3@D = 18-19 with 4 card support in @H, wonder why he shunned that|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pc|s9|pg||

nt|eweber: was I the one who needed a coffee? ;-) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt any EW pair could confidently find @C fit here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: You have to know that we are in a separate room, just the 4 players and me (BBO operator) so she should be able to hear any screams|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: diferent road but same play by w and same result lookslike|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: the 7@S was a penaltycard|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzpb: she has to find the spade finesse|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: 1 @d + 2 @c + 2 @s|pg||

nt|eweber: if West plays|pg||

nt|eweber: from E on a @c lead it is worse|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

nt|ritong: south had a tough problem to solve other table|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: sorry now i'm told both tables in Italy v Iceland played 5@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is something to be said for a 1NT overcall in North|pg||
nt|tomi2: this was not a bergen raise, it was simply an invitational raise with support|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N unintentionally moved the tray, before E had bid; they are making a joke about this also|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and promptly E bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: dont know if double showing some points, but some imps back to France here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: good time to play transfer leads|pg||
nt|cicus: bd 13 - lucky for Sweden that both pairs had their disaster on the same board - 16 IMP|pg||
nt|ritong: here, cronier did not create it  good decision|pg||
nt|andreasw:  im guessing one of the reasons would be his hand distrabution.. while 3@h would be weaker then 10-13 and can also hold 6@h aswell he wanted to show he "had something" |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: good lead|pg||
nt|pelu: the 2@H from W was contructiv: 10-13|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S should not take the first @c trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hopefully Paul can find out what 1N shows|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here's my guess   1N=@C  for suit or lead direct with @S fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that fits Daniela's 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I think it is a transfer to 2@C with possibly some kind of @S raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can't "blame" South for bidding 4@h - she was probably expecting a bit more from North |pg||
nt|lontoh 63: ada yang bilang kasih voor kata .... hahahahahaha|pg||
nt|alunand14: aggreed.........arif :)|pg||
nt|vbman: easily bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fluffy: this lead sometimes causes problems for the defence|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'm being told that many tables in six |pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess too Paul, danke|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andreasw:  the sweedish team only stood in 3@s on board 29 making 10 tricks so now bulgarya is in the lead with 3 boards to go|pg||
nt|pelu: East has prob now shown Gf+ values|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rhelle: after 1@h-2@h it gets tricky - East might have bid on 2 points|pg||
nt|penseur9: doesn't mean they all make :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this should go down 2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: i have friend who would berate partner/teammates if they led from Jack -- even when it was right|pg||
nt|tomi2: their aim was not to preempt opps out of the auction, they would probably not do this with 7hcp only|pg||
nt|tomi2: they wanted to investigate the 4@S game|pg||
nt|ahalim: i said bergen type raises not bergen raises :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: if @sQ might show @sKQxx or @sQJx east doens't know if she should appeal or not|pg||
nt|fluffy: another spade obviously loses a trick for the defence|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: or not  but they both did better than defend 4@S|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C strong in Open will prob lead to 6NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought we had Paul   now back to Dirk|pg||
nt|alnanda: must optimis.., GO Indonesia Go !!!|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: easy to bid and play 4 @S|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W did not overcall 1@h but contract was still 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rhelle: or 9, maybe a bad 10|pg||
nt|rhelle: this could be another partscore swing - 2@h vs 2@s|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D GF and then only 2NT (stronger than 3NT) - why are West not slamgoing?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andreasw:  very close match!|pg||
nt|jaker: interesting result from USA senior 1 on board 6 where NS relayed but stopped in 5d. 6d was made on a heart lead when W pitched a spade and declarer guessed to discard a heart on ...|pg||
nt|jaker: the third spade from dummy, thus endplayed east to give a ruff sluff to get rid to the last  heart. that was nicely done|pg||
nt|fluffy: again stansby finds the best play, she has played extremlly well all this match|pg||
nt|penseur9: good question|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I was overthinking bd 24. S should have ducked the first @d, then defence is chanceless|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs here missed a cool defense on  29|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: all that leads to ... should declarer duck at trick 1?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS leads vs NT are 3rd/5th|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: 1@d is conventional|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 8-11?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: precision opening bids for EW    1@D should be 2+   2@C=6+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they've made 2@C DENY 4 card major  i'm checking cc now|pg||
nt|3for3: i dont think they play 1@D guarantees 2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, hope, kibs enjoyed comparing the matter of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3NT can't be beaten here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: chance now to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but east has a minimum, at least in my book|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: maybe west should have bid it already|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: a vulnerable overcall at 2-level should show a good hand in my opinion|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ open team were in 5@D making|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: ty to Andy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=a major (Multi style)|pg||
nt|westjava: sry, North Ireland:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: also thanks to all persons that commented and watched, see you later|pg||
mb|p|nt|farrukh: so it seems that there may be some ruling involved looking at the bidding and the table score for board 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right Danny -- they play 2@D=mini-multi|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 31 proved to be a big swing for USA1|pg||

nt|star6ija: also to Rob for his terrific job and to BBO for making possible to watch online this remarkable event|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: thank you!|pg||

nt|fluffy: look|pg||
nt|eweber: it is amazing that a single person can type everything in without mistakes, report comments and alerts from table, answer privat chat and analyse board 24 as well!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N by passed hand shows the unbid suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N obviously a @S raise   not sure what else it says|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe clarifies @H as 5+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the opening bid could be 4@H 4@S|pg||
