nt|vugraphznv: what about a good practical bid|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D shows one of the major suits|pg||
nt|ady: Nortj will be very surprised its spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt=Lebensohl|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT with stiff king not usual|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Herbsts play Nat, Acol based, Major 5, better minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@C natural but may be a two card suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Traian.|pg||
nt|bobholl: they won't bid 3nt anymore i guess :)|pg||

nt|lechcold: witam|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Victor|pg||
nt|lml: hello|pg||
nt|lml: this auction is following the same lines as in the Open Room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it is Stansby taking a pause here|pg||
nt|lml: the trick will be the opening lead against a 6 level contract by north south|pg||
nt|panosk: gd morning to all|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT  leb   3@D direct would be forcing to game I would think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We have some huge technical problems with the PC and internet connections here in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: SORRY for that|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We are getting some technical assistance- and will try to be back very soon |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we know you are doing all you can Jan, no worries|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And the bidding on Board 18 in this room went |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@h opening from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@h (preempt)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass fromN|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pass from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: then N bid 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: going down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he took the pass card out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fallenius may cue bid 4@S|pg||
nt|hlortz: both sides can make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: a relatively peaceful hand, for starters?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  EW CC: http://tinyurl.com/66ttlf5|pg||
nt|szalay: wd u reopen as West?|pg||
nt|barnets: playing 3N in open|pg||
nt|kit: Pachtman knows his partner is short in hearts.  What he doesn't know about is the club fit.  But he can see 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South in the tank|pg||
nt|barnets: same bidding in open south passed|pg||
nt|kit: if South finds a 4@C call, North can reasonably bid the slam.|pg||
nt|kit: But bidding 4@C is a pretty big position I think.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and likely pass here too. S has no bid for that matter.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is still thinking|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can't NS make 6@C?|pg||
nt|kit: of course they can|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: i might have overcalled 1nt as east|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi david,geoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is somewhat of a punt|pg||
nt|ady: north bidding his shape if not his hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: who needs points!?|pg||
nt|ady: better than 4@H  they may have got to with a free run|pg||
nt|roswolf: if south doubles the azurri may run but if he doesnt then they might make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Dennis and all specs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: today we have session 4, 5 and 6 of the semi finals|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bulgaria bid 6@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Round 10 and Israel are performing well while Bulgaria are lower in the table than their recent form|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the dreaded xxx opposite xxx as stopper- 3H from West should show values|pg||
nt|xenya: this may well make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|desinka: hello Panos:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@C GF relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: apart from the hcp he has an empty hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south with both majors(though weak) is strangely silent|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this also gives you access to Voice Commentary for both rooms in our match|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|ady: it appears the contract n/s is 6@S    not all bid in 1 go|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: dzien dobry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Then ???  3NT - Pass???|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: @sA in hand|pg||
nt|xenya: which is likely|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR they led the @SA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and N still dont know what majorsuit S has|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he passed slowly :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  1N=15-17|pg||
nt|rv: this promises to be battle royale, 2 experienced and top sides in good form|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Al|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lml: its fun to watch my friends play from Canada play the talented Israeli pair|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and why not?|pg||
nt|lml: do you think Stansby should double for a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|lml: is it possible to figure this out?|pg||
nt|ady: north must still think hearts south suit|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps he should get a small bonus for thinking :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol true|pg||
nt|roswolf: t/o dbl of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here we go again RV|pg||

nt|odysseus69: Barel chose the natural option|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is not so clear as a cue bid, not sure the intent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IMPs for Netherlands from carryover of head-to-head match in Round Robin|pg||
nt|gracelin: China is behind by 37 imps but there are 48 boards to go.  So all is not finished yet.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they shouldnt|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a quick defeat likely|pg||
nt|ady: cannot make on any lead    just 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ryskiel_: witam w kolejnym dzisiejszym meczu, ostatnim|pg||
nt|ady: 4@D down 1 on best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Bulgaria at the moment in 9th |pg||
nt|ady: must set up 2 heart tricks before clubs are established|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so they would need some VPs to get in the top 8|pg||

nt|bobholl: didn't north know it was natural ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok a slow defeat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  weak NT, Strong 1@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: tarzan leaps into the fray|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: theoretically this should go one down, 1 heart, 1 spade and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now doomed for 1 down in 5D|pg||
nt|hlortz: pass or correct type bid perhaps with 5@D in reserve if needed|pg||

nt|roswolf: not much ammo thiugh|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi al|pg||

nt|panosk: gm Dessy|pg||
nt|panosk: gm Pim|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: gm|pg||
nt|oosmanb: losing 1@H and 2@C should be very quick for sementa|pg||

nt|roswolf: well that was aggressive|pg||
nt|bobholl: east not feeling to happy now :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphznv: West: i should have passed 2@h when he puts dummy down|pg||
nt|jbgood: so that explains the double:)|pg||
nt|panosk: it was easy that will make it easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3nt could have been a bit difficult to defend against, might need to overtake @C Q and lead a @S through|pg||
nt|olegario: not much can be done, they have gone a bit too high up|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Olegario...welcome|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now the defense is easy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hi olegario :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: both sides have great fits   but both limited to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Never says W and laughs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: E agrees // we newer has .. did I have one :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: hi|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: declarer claiming 12 tricks -- but Versace rejects - only 11 tricks he says|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@C shows 5+ @H , 10+|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they have screamed for club lead so no chance of anything else|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, seem like a flat board to me|pg||
nt|olegario: Hello skaftij :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like a crazy double to me, getting a diamond ruff wont set 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant on its own, he does not know about partners spade ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: K@C out diamond switch and spade ace and again diamond|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi oosman |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS upside down count & attitude   Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|rv: literally and figuratively true:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: Lindop has to rise on a spade to the jack now|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS's system card: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Australia/edgtton-gosney.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a kib tells me he is only 19|pg||
nt|desinka: seems|pg||
nt|hlortz: i woud have thought south would bid 5@C 2 way bid make or cheap save|pg||
nt|hlortz: best lead!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my point was fredin does not even know one club is cashing|pg||
nt|hlortz: very true|pg||
nt|hlortz: takes @H ruffs to beat 5@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: lead should sign post the correct line|pg||
nt|gracelin: surprised that Madala is not bidding at all with 5-4 major and 6 pts.  NS seems to be making 2S|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed patrick but need some imps back early i feel|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe too much wine last night!?|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure, Geoffrey, a most difficlt task, but not hopeless.|pg||
nt|roswolf: so much of this game is momentum thus giving you a feel good factor|pg||
nt|gracelin: however, with clubs not breaking, EW can't make even 1NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I saw him in the bar last night, but he wasn't drinking alcohol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = NF   2@C=a) 10-13, (3)4+@C  b) 14-15, not 55|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't know their ranges but 3 nt is surely too high|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphznv: 4@c showed that N has a 3-5-5-0 hand and minimum|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N has described a weak 5530|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as with Round Robin,  all matches in all events playing the same boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2@H = 5@S 4@H  14-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Dennis already entered those explanations|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||

pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: Brink presses on|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can ruff 3@C in dummy |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exiting first hand // a gameforce relay bidding here - and an Ice-relay bidding in then open room|pg||
nt|nkgupt: -1 may not be a bad score ...4@s is making i think|pg||
nt|nkgupt: by @c's can be forced only twice|pg||
nt|ady: would be easy with 7-5 to have bid higher   Netherlands might have the edge on this hand getting a plus|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it might but is it biddable with west making a strong noise - doubt it myself but the azurri are a law unto themselves|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec observes "kept EW out of 4@h"|pg||
nt|bobholl: Bas is feeling the pressure already :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: btw the home support for team orange is awesome judging by the messages i receive:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt:  |pg||
nt|ady: only danger for Netherlands  in OR  they some way get to 4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: or lose to 170|pg||
nt|roswolf: great hand and this is only bd1 of the SF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||

nt|bobholl: ah ha clarification from a kibitzer pass promised 8-11|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: good save against 3@S|pg||

nt|xenya: the winning line is outlined above|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I suppose, I don't know|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think you can, in the Transnationals|pg||
nt|nkgupt: might hav done a lil better ducking the @c|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: 3@C would have been easy enough on a heart lead|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 3@H should go down but no so bad as 3@C will make|pg||
nt|josj: good morning Europe and hello all|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hallo Jos..|pg||
nt|josj: after the excitement of the first board, we are now on firm ground again|pg||
nt|josj: hi Harold|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Hi Jos|pg||
nt|josj: hi Victor|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I would play on @S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: probably thinking of best line for 3 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|kit: which is what he is doing -- remember, he can't see all the cards as we can.|pg||
nt|gracelin: spade to J, then 2 high D and D ruff may be good.  North could ruff the 3rd D to stop overtrick|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Now a likely @H switch as interest was shown by N.|pg||
nt|lml: The auction has helped for sure |pg||
nt|hantveit: impossible to change to dia K, east might have AKQ in hearts and ace double in dia|pg||
pc|c7|nt|runnerup: that last  3nt -made -because @h switch to J /9. trick -after @c k  lead |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm verhees in the other room played a nonoptimum line|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the club suit|pg||
nt|brgpro: if he guesses trumps he will discard a @s then exit a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BOLS [liquor distributor?] sponsored competition of bridge tips in  1980    all articles online  just to a search|pg||
nt|brgpro: will make the contract 90% of the time,|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphznv: Duboin in deep thoughts..|pg||
nt|ady: clubs abd spades behaving sell for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BBO Voice Commentary available for both tables of that match|pg||
nt|lml: and even the @C10 is a hint|pg||
nt|lml: you always want a low club singleton|pg||
nt|skaftij:  home anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pulling trump  only makes sense when you see all hands|pg||
pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: wheel fell off in Closed room on first board|pg||
nt|josj: but no double so great chance missed by Israel...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this seemingly routine board is taking a long time - declarer contemplating bad breaks but seems to be in conttrol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South I mean|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spade jack now covers everything|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is final set of Quarter Final match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: SemiFinal matchups depend on how USA teams do|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director just came in to tell that there will be an appeal over a board of the previous set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if BOTH win today  then  one SemiFinal MUST be USA1 vs USA2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the appeal will be after this set|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so in case of a close finish the outcome might me decided after this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dennis   was it 1@SX +560??|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|panosk: N is doing his best, lesson to be learned here dont quit easily an undertrick less is a gain even in a hopeless situation|pg||

nt|oosmanb: I probably wouldnt have bid again with East's hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: had he played a second club he would have made it|pg||
nt|kit: Now Levin can underlead his club (Weinstein played queen, showing the jack), and third round of trumps defeats the contract.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they must have overcalled 1@s the OR, thus declarer believes W has the points and simply played @c to the Q to go down...or misguess trumps, one of the 2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|desinka: hi all :)|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: wtedy w reprezentacji Polski grali Balicki-¯mudziñski, Martens - Szymanowski i Klukowaki - Moszczyñski|pg||
nt|xenya: a somewhat off-shape (and off-strength?) 2N opening...|pg||
nt|xenya: led to a boring 3N -- perhaps for the best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller won't play the hand nearly that quickly|pg||
nt|gracelin: didn't north ruff the 3rd D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would expect the chinese to push here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Could not see, to fast, but they made 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i don't know about what board|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That being so, I dont think I have anything more than my 2@H already showed|pg||
nt|roswolf: first blood to team orange|pg||
nt|roswolf: big blood|pg||

nt|alnanda: test|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  will be reached by n/s|pg||
nt|ady: e/w do well to play 3NT|pg||
nt|oosmanb: N might have overcalled with QJ10xx and South raised with Axx so Kxx@s also doubtful|pg||
nt|bobholl: true i wouldn't bid it too :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|brgpro: dec. will surely play @cK with E after this bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: David Lindop is thinking how many spades|pg||
nt|desinka: hi David|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assume DBL=4+@S  but some pairs   specify 4/5|pg||
nt|roswolf: south shows where the hcp are|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tricky hand for East - we can see that 3NT is ok, but East can't|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H 44 so 3nt makes |pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer responses for the dutch>|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weak NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|desinka: and Al|pg||
nt|ady: best spot appears to be 4@S n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N debating between stayman or transfer. Stayman better imo.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h down on the trump break - but N will save if they bid it?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  a very good lead from Brink played this game down with any other lead it will be close|pg||
nt|ady: I would think 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice splinter|pg||
nt|gracelin: the opening makes it less appealling for EW to bid a slam.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: no|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-3@S|pg||
nt|brgpro: 1@s=t/o double with fewer than 4@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer sjhpwing clubs?|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: so just 2 imps on 2 wildish hands|pg||
nt|ady: typical Sementa opening in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: picture West with Jxx in spades for example|pg||
mb|d!|an|take-out, 4!h|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has a pretty obvious 4@S bid, i would have said|pg||
nt|lml: we have 10 spades ... we belong at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dessy|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the best bulgarian pair recently...for more than 20 years they are almost non-stop part of the Bulgarian National Team in the top international forums|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Desita :)|pg||
nt|desinka: the best one.. but lets see the contract..|pg||
nt|desinka: Hey, Momchil@h|pg||
nt|lechcold: skok Martensa bezkompromisowy, ale mo¿e wepchn¹æ EW w szlemika, którego po³o¿enie wymaga..sami widzicie czego:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but splinter will help Brink declare|pg||
nt|roswolf: light but shapely opening - yes e/w will do well to score game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4-fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room in 4@S|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, and 5c, but 3nt more likely|pg||
nt|hantveit: shoul make 4s too|pg||
nt|hantveit: should|pg||
nt|bobholl: threy made it indeed|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3h=single H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  my typo   see Jack's explanation|pg||
nt|roswolf: denies 4 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 4@H is not making but in this vul it is hard for N to let it go|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for both teams still alot at stake|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make 5 here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am assuming he wont risk heart ruff by playing for club ruff|pg||
nt|gracelin: Leaving to their own, 6C is a reasonable contract.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but of course, not making here.|pg||
nt|roswolf: true and making 12 tricks might be iffy|pg||
nt|gracelin: this shud be easy enough and probably 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=blocking|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will X again|pg||
nt|rv: Madala feels it is worth risking 2 level O/C for lead purpose|pg||
mb|2N|an|limit|nt|vugraphznv: Versace claims 12 tricks after the lead -- they are playing quick here |pg||
nt|boedhy:  Brasil strugling to get to the first 8|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South will correct to 2@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@D not so bad (last hand) but may be a bit tricky due to 4-1 @D|pg||
nt|runnerup: this secvense helps to let 4 @h -make easyly -south has all cards -also 3nt|pg||
nt|xenya: tempting for N to go on|pg||
nt|ady: that really should be penaly now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well that won't work|pg||
nt|skaftij:  What a shot!|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and it does go off but not enough perhaps|pg||
nt|gracelin: the lead maybe referred to as Canape lead.  You bid your longer suit but lead your shorter one.|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: welcome back Kit :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is not pure Stayman -- just a relay for more info|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, many play lite O/Cs for lead or sacrifice |pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: the bid worked out well|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 3@S from north  6 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy off to amazing start winning 96 of possible 100 VPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@S gets raised without primary support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they seem to be the in form team :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North in the tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so suit not good enough for 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: lack of 3@S has made it difficult to reach the best spot|pg||
nt|star6ija: Martel has to repeat the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Chip Martel would bid 3N instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ok ale ja skorzysta³em z okazji by co podszczypn¹æ - jak to mam (mom?) w zwyczaju|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and they'll win it there probably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: folks, try to analyze like the players, not as double dummy :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6NT is on but kind of roland slam :) 20% or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: north-south are too high|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt 20-22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a bit unlucky  but  Drijver expected better hand from Brink -- and certainly not @HA|pg||
nt|barnets: playing 4@S in open|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Just been given EW CC by a well informed kibitzer: ty Johan|pg||
nt|roswolf: inv raise coming|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ady: that mey sound like a cu  agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is ok...repeating them immediately would have shown more solid colour|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- in general, 4 of a previously bid major is offer to play I believe.|pg||
nt|ady: rather than trying to show 6 card suit not shown earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now South in the tank|pg||
nt|kit: But if Stansby is thinking, then there may be some doubt|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, agree.. but now Martel's p may think abt @ds fit..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you know how Martel-Stansby treat 4th suit after jump shift?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@s is still safe double dummy I think|pg||
nt|kit: no I don't, Al|pg||
nt|panosk: looks it wont make|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The Netherlands offcourse the higher the better because then you get to pick your opps|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they end up in their best fit with good controled bidding it seems. |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Muller made 4@S on  2|pg||
nt|ady: this could be very expensive   spade lead and diamond through|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is not to be fancied|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd @S enouraging because declarer can duck twice|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  as we can see 4@h is close tho...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and in natural bidding you can end in @h and with 16 opposite 8 think many will be in game...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but a @h lead against 4@h is killing too|pg||
nt|alnanda: yes 4@h is posible altough hard way to make|pg||
nt|ady: that lead wont upset declarer    but any lead likely to be good for south  except maybe a low spade|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Oosman, Jan:)|pg||

nt|andersk: Looks like down, even if he gets the sp right! |pg||
nt|andersk: EW only has to avoid dummy to get entry to the 3rd and 4th sp|pg||
nt|xenya: had N chosen to advance more slowly (5@C?), they might have stopped in 5 |pg||
nt|roswolf: well the usual game try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this won't make either|pg||
nt|brgpro: E still needs to lead @h 8 or 9, otherwise the suit is blocked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hedy --- you're very muffled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy and Peter coming thru well  but not Hedy|pg||
nt|rv: 8 tricks is possibly limit here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: i am not sure what a double of 4@S would have been, but maybe similar to the double of 3@c earlier, saying "i want to bid on"|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think with making 3@d is a good result|pg||
nt|ady: will be enough on best defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: now the spade switch|pg||
nt|ady: Semenra will do better not to cover the high spades|pg||
nt|ady: diamond from west  devasting   3 rounds of trumps|pg||

nt|ady: could be around down 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bell tolls for someone|pg||

nt|roswolf: children|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Shi had the @SQ in his hand, put it  back|pg||

nt|ady: low spade now not likely to cost|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Shi still thinking, alle the cards still open|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Sementa calling director|pg||

nt|star6ija: assuming that 3@cs establishes GF, 3@h maybe sounds more or less natural|pg||

nt|xenya: it would seem 4@C is about as good as 4@S here|pg||
nt|lml: well 4@S has one big advantage|pg||
nt|xenya: right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and 4@c has another - @d lead gives 2 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: if Muller had passed 2@s double, could have collected 300|pg||
nt|rv: now -100|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winning 2nd @S  maybe prevents Madala from signalling @D entry|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ron_sc2002: nice play|pg||
nt|lml: no peeking!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they know ... now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stefanov in 4@S North|pg||
nt|ady: North giving preference on 4 and 2 of diamonds instead of showing a likely 6 card suit seems where it went wrong|pg||
nt|star6ija: I like Martel's way of bidding|pg||
nt|stoffers: Loosing a couple of diamonds and maybe one spade here, more coffee :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks and 5 imps.|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S not unreasonable contract especially if @DA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking...he placed the cards on the table and deep in thought|pg||
nt|roswolf: a very similar auction to the same poor contract|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: so far canada has been the aggressor and it has worked|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||

pc|c2|nt|brgpro: well, will 4@c be forcing in this auction?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vanProoijen-Verhees play a very unusual system  so when auctions look similar they're usually with very different inferences|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|lml: they stole the contract on board 2 in 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: at least 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|roswolf: what is his complaint - too slow?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the hollanders have a great tradition of winning against the odds|pg||
nt|roswolf: also their squad system and support for the national team deserve some laurels|pg||

pc|d9|nt|roswolf: dropping the @HQ may well just be a gut feelinf - madala has flair in abundance|pg||
nt|brgpro: many specs told me that if E has the Q he would be end played but how could he go to dummy again?|pg||
nt|brgpro: the way he played...he had no more entry to dummy|pg||

nt|hantveit: Looks like angelini got a tilt there. Boye is a good partner in thouse situations, I am sure he backs up his partner not. |pg||
nt|hantveit: now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: However they have declared that they frequently bid 3 card @H/@S after 1@c/1@D opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: had they all raised @H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not sure|pg||
nt|brgpro: declarer, knowing the suit breaks 6-3 will surely win the first @h with some hope.....( i mean after @h5 lead)...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: live video and voice commentary from onsite vugraph room http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live|pg||
nt|hantveit: when partner is doing something increddible bad, the best partners is backing him up, the worst are yelling.|pg||
nt|bobholl: they have a (very) good pair on the other table|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@H a better slam than 6@S|pg||
nt|hantveit: I am not familiar with NSs system, but in natural 2D is a goo bid on souths han|pg||
nt|hantveit: if partner bids 3D, you say 3S as force, partner can insist on 4D with 4+ dia|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree completely|pg||
nt|hantveit: a@h|pg||
nt|hantveit: great, thank you, it only took me 6 years to learn that|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this big club 1@D bid is NEVER  54 minors|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: 5@C perhaps|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S can go down while 4@H is always making|pg||
nt|athene: north must suspect that east has hearts, so why not give him a bit of a problem?|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: yes 5@C is a good save|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: west's pass showing some values I think|pg||
nt|lml: a matter of style|pg||
nt|athene: hello good morning everyone|pg||
nt|udo: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: still 2-0 -- i think it will be a record across the matches on those boards|pg||
nt|lml: I guess double makes sense with four spades and a not great club suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Italy-Netherlands 0-25 on the same 2 boards|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will end in 4@h making probably|pg||
nt|bt: grue and lall doing their best to give up small imps at the other table, all of us swedes are grateful|pg||

nt|runnerup: 5 @s still good against 5 @h here -so little battle |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Iceland stops in 5@S on  3|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H might fail|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow going for slam|pg||
nt|ady: would be unlucky|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Can it be 10-14 NT?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: They play multi when Vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 @s + 3 @h are a risk to open 2@s weak|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=limit raise or better   2N=strong NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: it is maybe inverted minor and 2N showing 15-17?|pg||
nt|alnanda: there is no difficulty reaching 4@h, i think..|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: najbli¿szy prawdy by³ maciej12 poda³ 45imp...wynik by³ 415-376|pg||

nt|barnets: 3@D israel in open|pg||
nt|ady: but 3-0 heart split and needing a club ruff may be too much|pg||
nt|bobholl: luckily it was NV :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes that could be the reason, he could discard a @D on the 4th @h if E had any|pg||
nt|kit: 6@S will depend on the opening lead here|pg||
nt|kit: Levin with a difficult rebid chooses to hedge with 2@D, as neither 2@H nor 3@H feels right.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=not 4/5@S  a) any (mild) INV, no fit  b) to play 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D non-force|pg||
nt|brgpro: where is Rob when we need him?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have notes too :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: the inventor of the Tazan prec. system|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has trust in his pard's dummy play!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Tarzan reference because  wijs-muller sounds like name of man who played Tarzan in the movies   Johnny Weissmuller|pg||
nt|roswolf: tough reopening positon for south basicall opps could have anything|pg||
nt|brgpro: if Duboin doubles this....the best for N is to pass...|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl seems flexible|pg||
nt|brgpro: although i believe he will just shrug and pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lauria 1N East|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: even without being a convention it suggests that kind of hand|pg||
nt|xenya: more realistic|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West dbls 3@D now, but director tells them to wait for safety|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Well, we will find ou later how 3nT was made erhaps duck a @d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Lars|pg||
nt|hantveit: so, a penalty for ew.|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember we can see ALL the cards the players only 26|pg||
nt|roswolf: when fixed stay fixed|pg||
nt|brgpro: 1NT wont be a good moment to play in...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south just hopes his partner doesn't do anything uncooperative, like bidding clubs :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1N 18-20|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D is a spade raise- exactly what this promises varies from partnership to partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East doesn't accept|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so bidding is as displayed, only North doesn't see it yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pushed to North now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North has to decide the final contract now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does 4@H need @s guess or no?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1H showing @ss|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Wijs did not enter with @h bid on bd3, allowing Einarsson to support with 2@s iso 4@s|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh|pg||
nt|brgpro: assume E has only 2@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs use transfers over the DBL   showing EITHER  the suit OR  fit with lead-director|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and tends to be bad hand for slam|pg||
nt|stoffers: some might bid 2@d on Duboins hand here, me included. He may regret it now when partner leads clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Same lead in the OR.|pg||
nt|wild card: hi|pg||
nt|wild card: this looks like a makebale contract|pg||
nt|wild card: *makeable|pg||
nt|lml: this may work out well for Israel|pg||
nt|lml: pretty aggressive bidding by this team so far|pg||
nt|xenya: and how|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR Weinstein overcalled 2@C instead of doubling|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict some 14 imps to Israel on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: MArtel has found a book|pg||
nt|lml: its a style thing but the club suit looks pretty weak to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and has started reading in it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't pass, but the tray wa spushed to the North side already|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and North bid already and SW saw it when the tray was pulled back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director walked away, i Didn't hear his ruling..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Tray is at WestSouth side now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Think director went to get some help|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nd director here: they said it's more complicated|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the meantime i go for a coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Norths 3@S is treated is as a bid of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: without screens|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East can accept 3@S or let the tray go back to Fredin|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East asking what the total consequences ar|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west passes, north bids 3@s and auction proceeds as normal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west doesn't pass, then if north bid @S's (at any lvl) south has to pass 1 round|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: If west doesn't pass and North bids something else than @S south should pass the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|andersk: interesting 4@H here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: same here :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: china lost 3 imps on bd17 2@S-1 by the chinese south in the other room|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is unlikely to misguess H position now.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south also has a tough lead.  3 Aces and a singleton trump, all unappealling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is either balanced  or   5minor 4Major|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: 4@C isn't giving east any problem|pg||
nt|lml: he liked the stiff spade and the club fit|pg||
nt|lml: so will south cuebid the @HK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=shortness|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so were back now..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And we are back live now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and first imps for iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Board 18 was a 4@c down 2 in N|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well done Jan and thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a 4@s making on board 19|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes well done Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Now we are LIVE again - and 2nt showed a 3 or 4 card @s support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice to see some totally natural bidding :)|pg||
nt|xenya: so Sweden are off to a flying start in this match -- very important for them  as they are currently 9th, closely followed by Australia and Japan |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ashley in the tank now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Muller did bid @H:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  5 @s is not easy to make without a @c lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bidding defensive does have downsides too|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer needs to use his high trump to play the red suit.  Club can be led from either hand.  So better win and start a red suit.|pg||
nt|hantveit: why not 3!AH |pg||
nt|bobholl: the  1nt is just to play opposite 8-11 so not well defined|pg||
nt|oosmanb: CC says Nonvul TP if pd passed|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So he wants to play 1NT. thats it.|pg||
nt|bobholl: he 'd better lead a @H otherwise made |pg||
pc|h2|nt|boedhy:  think this will go down so 8 imps or so to iceland|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and thanks 350 specs for hanging in there with us :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a great start for the "hometeam" |pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes and an important match it is. |pg||
nt|jbennet: An x with void hearts dangerous.|pg||
nt|pbundy: a possibility that the extreme trump break may give declarer a problem here - IF they do indeed declare in 3@H|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 aIh|pg||
nt|hantveit: see, I lost it again|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H would have been much better|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3a@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, forgot about bad spade split -- so slam won't be making anyway -- or will it -- might be a trump coup.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lew Mathe:  NEVER lead trump  ....  unless it is right|pg||

nt|star6ija: Trendafilov will attack hearts now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is asking questions at moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW lead 2nd/4th against suit and nt     upside down signals focusing on count|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so we have to wait and see|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds 3-2  and hearts 4-4   this should roll home|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say, @D to the Ace, small @D ruff, small @S to the Ace and another @D ruff, @S to J and @D ruff and @SK. Do we get to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I cant see the title of it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South annoyed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  there is.....|pg||
nt|boedhy:  strange bidding form south 2@c round forcing|pg||
nt|hantveit: I am slow, but I think I got it now|pg||
nt|hantveit: @C|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah result merchant was he!?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphznv: bulgaria scored 10 on the slam hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: he would rather have seen a redouble:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South to toilet now|pg||
nt|bt: thanks martin|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello Lars yes sweden has picked up a few so far|pg||
nt|xenya: 8 teams qualify for the quarterfinals -- and this is the last round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similiar situation here|pg||
nt|kit: scary stop when vul 3NT is so close.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: after Levin put the cards down...North said YOU HAVE SOMETHING :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|ady: have stayed out    have done well   may get a swing|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  well with the odds|pg||
nt|gracelin: when north can only contribute S6 on first trick, south shud know declarer's trumps are all high.|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe Angelini sponsored them as well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|odysseus69: here the KJ of clubs are waste paper- |pg||
nt|boedhy:  if you end up 4th you will get the best team form 5-8 as opponent for instance USA1|pg||
nt|bt: so on the pedestrian heart lead decl has 8 tricks, now he has 9|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another potential good board for sweden|pg||
nt|runnerup: this cant be bad for Sweden either|pg||
nt|barnets: exact same bidding in open room|pg||

nt|andersk: @C lead, then If he hooks a @D switch for -1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: interesting on a @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe cullin leads @H|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right |pg||
nt|gracelin: thoug declarer has only 3 obvious loser, he might not have 10 trick since he cannt ruff the 4th D.  North will overruff.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but 3 sP is a choice|pg||
nt|brgpro: i hope he was right each time he led one!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most know the name Mathe because of conventional overcall of strong @C  where DBL=majors NT=minors|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: i would have overcalled 1@H with the north hand but pass is ok if your partner is there for you with a double|pg||
nt|kemperg: the only lossing line?|pg||
nt|wild card: yes|pg||
nt|wild card: but now he's down|pg||
nt|jbennet: which is the one recommended.|pg||
nt|kit: All the warning signs are out there -- double of 4@D, no 4@H Q by partner.  Looks like Levin should find the pass.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking...he looks in agony lol|pg||
nt|szalay: Kit we can say TEMPTING signs as well|pg||
nt|szalay: good support, RDBL over DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he placed the cards on the table|pg||
nt|szalay: what was EXACT meaning of 3@H?|pg||
nt|rv: E-W are close to making 4@h, N-S make 9 tricks in 3n, interesting brd here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|stoffers: no problem...sementa found a @d nomather what :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: witam serdecznie|pg||

nt|ady: could make if hearts with south    9 tricks available    but defence have 5|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they are very friendly at the table|pg||
nt|oosmanb: can switch though, to kill dummy's entry, THAT is findable|pg||
nt|bobholl: but does he suspect a@s single |pg||
nt|oosmanb: Can be pretty certain since with dblton he mightve run from dbl?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: however |pg||
nt|oosmanb: what if pd has AJxx|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: he can have that off course :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but a @D a@H and 7 @S = C|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: wow ... well done north south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or was it USA lost 10|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: if you say the name it'd probably turn into a best-seller in a moment :)|pg||
nt|bt: grue had a brain melt in 6@C doubled and lall gave up a second spade finesse, thanks|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sorry - zwyciêzc¹ konkursu by³ marian 12 anie maciej12|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and passed|pg||
nt|brgpro: a quiet 1 down here...but 1NT will be interesting, |pg||
pc|c2|nt|andersk: no chanse to set now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ? If pd had J@D along with A. then top 4@D and 2@C tricks?|pg||
nt|bobholl: south took a profitable gamble :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: switch K@H and J@d|pg||
nt|kit: I would have to check, but looking at Weinstein's hand I imagine it is a forcing 3@S call.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|alnanda: i think 2@c is drury|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be 2@H only showed a minimum but it's strange anyway|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, but it is hard when we do not know the system. But they should be able to find a 4-4 fit in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Angelini found the 13th card on the floor from last game, maybe that is why he threw away the clubs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: although that doesnt even leave 8-11 with East|pg||
nt|rv: this should drift 1 down|pg||
nt|rv: Italy likely to pick-up another 10 IMPs on brd 19|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ron_sc2002: agree.. partner probably wont bid again so better to make pressure on E and bid directly 5@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on heart lead he makes also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller won't go down quickly|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: would all of you have got to 6@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tricky too bid|pg||
nt|lml: it sure is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now the live scores is down so hope we get that back soon|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm should be made ok i think|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, I a, wrong.  Declarer does have 10 tricks.  He can pitach the 4th D on a good club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi sry lost connx|pg||
pc|dA|nt|oosmanb: Best lead is @d probably|pg||
nt|jbennet: would most likely had led to 4 cl for +130.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 18  other table 5@C going down  so 11 for Sweden|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: in 10 minutes or so he will be brought back to cruel reality|pg||
nt|lml: south asked for a heart earlier|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah trying to make it...|pg||
nt|pbundy: no useful pitch - and a ruff high appears to doom the contract also|pg||
nt|pbundy: not to mention some clubs which must be disposed of......|pg||
nt|jbennet: a narrow escape. for -1. |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: with the high spade|pg||
nt|yuval10: he saw KJ@d KQ@s in N, K@h can't be with him as well|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: north might have intended 4@C to say "you can save in 5@C if you like"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: some more imps coming up for sweden|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like another 10 |pg||
nt|hantveit: It must be the @c ace|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: an established partnership like the Herbst have it easier because they know what to expect from each other|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh sorry  deWijs declarer|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well their is the advatage of being known as a good player......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Versace didn't open West hand|pg||
nt|rv: only 5 since Lauria couldn't manage to find way to make 8 tricks in @h partial|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: @d6 could be singleton or T6|pg||
nt|tez: 3 of @h suit preferance here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so muller now thinking whether he should try to cash a 2nd @d|pg||
nt|rv: Muller can safely play second trump to cater to all scenarios|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but he knows de Wijs only had @h JTxxxx, so @cA also possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver  4@S North|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: played on @S and @H 3/2. |pg||
nt|yuval10: neither can the A@c|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ryskiel_: pewnie uk³¹da tekst przemówienia obroñczego|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Declarer giving up 3 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: just making|pg||
nt|xenya: down 1 (i don't think he will take a deep @D finesse on the 2nd round) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs may open west hand 1N  [or PASS]|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wild card: but when you try to ruff your diamonds you only need spades 3/2 and diamonds 5/3|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wistuj¹ - jak w "wist rozmowa w tym samym jêzyku" |pg||

nt|boedhy:  peolpe tend to trsut you|pg||
nt|pbundy: with the spade ace not sitting well, all spells trouble for declarer|pg||
nt|kit: I'm told 3@H is invite+ in spades|pg||
nt|brgpro: say a @c lead and back, S shd just cover E's card...leaving him with no entry in hand ( to play a @s up)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: yes, looks like it will be -2 |pg||
nt|roswolf: establish clubs and hold his breath by playing a diamond up|pg||
nt|anton72: looks like 140 and flat board |pg||
nt|rv: 4@s is normal contract here, very enterprising (euphemism for gambling) players  may try 3n:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|antoniz: Piotr myli o singlowym Asie pik|pg||
nt|anton72: sry ..was private |pg||
nt|anton72: but anyway ..Hi Mike ..and thx for the nice job what u doing well !!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 140 looks about right :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: 12 well deserved imps to give Israel the lead|pg||
nt|kamyk: gdyby @CA sta³...|pg||
nt|jbennet: he might deduce south having 2623 from start|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  [4@HN=]   Fallenius in 2@H|pg||
nt|jbennet: that couldnt have been s surprise.|pg||
nt|pbundy: had he known the layout, a club pitch might have been more opportune|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strongly recommend    buckle up   this will be a bumpy set of boards|pg||
nt|jbennet: the hearts were huge huge favourite to be 4-0.|pg||
nt|hantveit: then it makes more sence, but he must have lost if after the opening...|pg||
nt|rv: well def|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lml: yes it does but Stansby doesnt know that yet|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but Campos now kowes never to trust Brink anymore|pg||
nt|roswolf: another push|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice discards as well, helping partner|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphznv: he did not ruff yet|pg||
nt|jbennet: but on the other hand there is no way to deep finesse in D lacking 1 entry.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c3|nt|lml: he is about to find out though :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: smalltrue  there was a defence   smalll club at trick 2  possible but difficult|pg||
nt|boedhy:  something i could have told him on beforehand|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jbennet: in fact it was 99 % sure that hearts were 4-0.|pg||
nt|jbennet: if not then east only possible distributon were 4324|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphznv: claiming losing a @s and a @H|pg||
nt|panosk: what a struggle for a mere 2@S part score|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@H sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if he makes it lose 2 imps goes it down 7 imps|pg||
nt|kit: Zagorin ducked the ace of hearts.  Weinstein now working on a trump coup, but won't succeed since third round of diamonds isn't cashing.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jbennet: and no sane player would sit for 3 h x with 4-c support in clubs and only xxx in hearts.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|star6ija: @c switch would probably defeat the contract|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room, but South described minor 2-suiter|pg||
nt|lechcold: oj|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jbennet: so since j9x is impossible to handle; the issue is play south for EJ or E9.|pg||
nt|runnerup: and no entry to play A9 -so Aj|pg||
nt|jbennet: he might be afraid that south had 2713 from start.|pg||
nt|xenya: well if N had J9x now, the finesse would be essential|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuan: ora 5@C è chicane o asso secco|pg||

nt|remo: lo chicane non sarebbe una buona notizia, anche se in tal caso le @D di W sarebbero più "ciccione"|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|gluckenval: fortuna che Lorenzo ha tenuto aperto il tutto|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|remo: se invece gioca sulle @D dovrebbe mantenere facilmente|pg||

nt|kemperg: should fear a ruff|pg||
nt|wild card: or 4/1 with the 4card with the 3 trumps|pg||
nt|lml: seldom right for a team to play 2NT in both directions|pg||
nt|jbgood: they also use 2@d for the real garbage|pg||
nt|panosk: NS have a minor slam EW will compete |pg||
nt|bt: 4@S might have worked better here, but 1@S is normal|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is the modern style to overcall 1@S rather than 4@S.|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes now a slam again and this is over |pg||
nt|jbennet: thsi is a board where again science takes the pot.|pg||

nt|bobholl: nice position @D K :)|pg||
nt|szalay: always tough to bid game after 1@C (strong)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South's 2@d looks like either (a) hearts (b) both majors|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi all|pg||
nt|anton72: i guess ...both M |pg||
nt|mdgraham: in which case, North may have meant 2@S as a (case a) transfer-accept of hearts (b) well, don't know really|pg||
nt|anton72: no way to ending in 2 @s if partner know 5+ @h i think|pg||
nt|anton72: or may be you are right ...good accept for hearts ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: semi-force|pg||
nt|pbundy: a bit surprised that east did not show a 2 suiter here - particularly given the colors|pg||
nt|brgpro: if Versace doubles, they would be in game...so |pg||
nt|roswolf: the clubs must be orange flavoured here|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3NT or 4@H, Lauria is considering...but never 3@H i believe|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment jack|pg||
nt|brgpro: pass?|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be even pass :)|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C looks down 1 on a spade lead    bu East might be more ambitious|pg||
nt|brgpro: that is a big decision...although that is the winning one perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: now pass frightens me|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes and as Jos points out excellent journalist press and Bulletin facilities|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = FG, 9+ HCP, 2+ controls, 4+@S, maybe longer suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in the Open Room they did start with a weak 2 using multi ... that may have made it a bit harder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S were 3/2, you mean @Hs.|pg||
nt|boedhy:  3crd support|pg||
nt|oosmanb: moderately straight forward hands so far, and almost all the tables playing v fast|pg||
nt|barnets: Israel bid to 5@C here with little values 20 hcp e/w|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 20:20 both sides and partial.|pg||
nt|anton72: anyway sweden can get a big gain here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and it looks lie 4@h has a good play on this lie, but I don't think they'll get there|pg||
nt|pbundy: double now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know the 2@C rebid :(|pg||
nt|bobholl: never pretty in comparisations doubled partscore made :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: im sorry, north wasnt thinking. Just forgot to pass for him:)|pg||
nt|ady: might try 3NT    that  should come unstuck|pg||
nt|roswolf: would perhaps put off breakfast for the vampires |pg||
nt|brgpro: we knew that|pg||
nt|brgpro: give N one more @h and one less @s...pass could be dangerous|pg||
nt|bobholl: larry (the law ) says pass may be 16 1/2 tricks only|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|panosk: is he thinking for 6 go to 7 or just pass?|pg||
nt|panosk: *6@D|pg||
nt|panosk: intersting views from kibs coming in |pg||

nt|brolucius: 2@S shows a sound heart raise.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The double shows some spade support (or a doubleton honor) but denies the values to bid 3@S.|pg||
nt|hlortz: and theres always the guilty pleasure in seeing others go wrong - gives us hope :)|pg||
nt|bt: now fallenius should get diamonds in there to involve partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@D now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has a great fit for both red suits, as you see.|pg||
nt|bt: luckily for sweden fallenius would normally, only god knows what fredin would do with that hand|pg||
nt|bt: not even god actually|pg||
nt|bt: fredin has a great mind but for us mortals its hard to understand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if they bid this slam i will say again..woooow|pg||
nt|jbennet: 3h probably some sort of semi fit in spades. a hand unsuitable to rebid 2 NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 25hcp|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @d better than 4 @s -if you loose  one @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = good raise of @H|pg||
nt|xenya: will they get to 4? I'm not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs use 1N as the "cue"|pg||
nt|kit: Very aggressively bid to 5@C in other room -- might make, might not.|pg||
nt|gracelin: they better stay low|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1S shows D|pg||
nt|roswolf: or controla maybe|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much on for n/s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suggestion that 2@d was spades + another - quite possible|pg||
nt|hantveit: pass if 2clubs is majors|pg||
nt|brgpro: wow|pg||
nt|nkgupt: does he follow it any more? :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: So six top losers here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 2@C is both majors by E|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi David welcome|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning David|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to hear 5D now|pg||
nt|ady: Italians got to 5@D   and guessed the J@S   after the same take-out double from south|pg||
nt|ady: thx    good morning all|pg||
nt|panosk: also clubs beter in case a club ruff |pg||
nt|boedhy:  2NT looks natural tho and that is imo strange but absolutely Brink like....|pg||
nt|ady: request for link  for scores please|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@s MAY BE ANOTHER SPOT NOW|pg||
nt|roswolf: if rdbl showed Hx in spades|pg||
nt|ady: some play that re-dbl showing at least doubleton honor in spades   others play good general values|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@c not alerted on both sides|pg||
nt|jbennet: 2 clubs rebid probably shows some sort of extras. |pg||
nt|hantveit: rebid clubs later|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@D for the lead :)|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|athene: duboin giving his partner quite a bit of leeway for 2@C at favourable|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 2@H is a fine contract|pg||
nt|lml: lots of tricks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 2/3@S|pg||
nt|bt: now fredin gets no help deciding, thats the problem w 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: north south were silent|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D?|pg||
nt|hantveit: in creative moments :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i wouldn't have bid (afraid of 4@H)|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3....@h...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: muller will relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: more than 13|pg||

nt|ady: dont think anyone going very high|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D  should be down 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Did not hear explanation of redouble|pg||
nt|ady: 200 as good as any|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3D or 4C seems ok|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi missed a chance to double 1S to show spade. either for lead directing or for competing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess     missorted hand|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think aggressive in the long run is best. |pg||
nt|ady: remember  though Versace could be stronger  and 500-800 looms|pg||
nt|nkgupt: great judgement to bid a tiny 3@h:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't like it but this is the winning decision :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: caution perhaps justified here|pg||
nt|roswolf: true bob|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H a surprise |pg||
nt|davidstern: Hmmm negative one but unlikely quick|pg||
mb|2S|an|.|nt|athene: but his @DQJ are not going to be much use facing shortage|pg||

nt|boedhy:  trying to make up for my last prediction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Duboin thinking now|pg||
nt|andersk: I wonder if 3 @S would be stronger than 4 in this auction?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South worth a move|pg||
nt|ahollan1: likes 4@H & @D filler  but 4333 slows down Drijver|pg||
nt|szalay: rdbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll get the CC from the ecats site and see if I can found out - give 5 mins|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 imp in the air ....|pg||
nt|anton72: but what ..1 by 1 ....|pg||
nt|oosmanb: some play rdbl there as Hx in @H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But if 1@h could be 4 cards, rdbl as support looks good|pg||
nt|nkgupt: he sure knows when to underbid :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: great lead now find the @D ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: these guys may do strange looking things but they usually result in positive imp results|pg||
nt|brgpro: with this lead, 3@h is not the winning one but pass|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, i would open 1@c 3rd seat and pass when pd responds a red suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely 11 tricks with nice lay of diamonds and spade split|pg||
nt|stoffers: Einarson with a huge hand after whats shown here, i would rather bid 3@s than 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: noticed Zack 's 3@D     presumeable at that point weaker than pass?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can he read the 5 he should|pg||
nt|jbennet: west will rule out 3NT as a playable spot. |pg||
nt|xenya: with NS silent. bidding this slam would have been a real feat|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ola Rimstedt let me know that in the open room they play 6d|pg||
nt|runnerup: if you dont loose any @d -you make 6 -but here -important to loose no @d -whenr you are short of trumps also |pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder how many tables will reach it -- not too many i think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so may be the kiwis can take some badly needed imps back|pg||
nt|szalay: cheap and effective|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Johnsson helping NS get back into game exploration|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@C-3@H-4@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: ns still don't know the bad @S|pg||
nt|kit: East opened the bidding there -- here, they won't get so high.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a common approach in "Brit 1@c" is for 2@c by South to show the majors and 2@d to show one major |pg||
nt|jbennet: but in view of souths 3 cl bid.|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2nt now from Boye I guess|pg||
mb|3H|an|4261|nt|lml: with 33 HCP most pairs should reach a slam somewhere|pg||
nt|lml: maybe all|pg||
nt|antoniz: po kierowym lub treflowym -1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this will make for sure - South would love to withdraw his take out double|pg||
nt|skaftij:  this will be 15 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|skaftij:  14|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: definetly imps for the kiwis|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and the night is still young for them -- there will be other opportunities no doubt|pg||
nt|runnerup: there is a way to put a @d loose away so take care of @h by dummys trumps -but now -after @c lead there is no way to go down |pg||
nt|xenya: now, of course, EW may find a save in @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @S only 3 losers    and  that's ok in 4@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  costs 500|pg||
nt|gracelin: when opponents play these transfer responses, one shud take advantage of that.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west again with 2 nt ? secondary @D |pg||
nt|bobholl: don't like to double with no @H|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H could be balanced 25+, might not be hearts, so 2@S asks|pg||
nt|kit: and 3@D is natural 2-suiter|pg||
nt|davidstern: Defence must cash out else...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: zreszt¹ jak oceni³ Gawry kontrê Kality to ja wiem ale nie powiem|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for a quick 1 off..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well we knew this was coming, if i bid 4@H my intent is to pull any doubles|pg||
nt|bt: i think fallenius could have done better here|pg||
nt|barnets: a spade was led against 5@C that gives 4 spade tricks and dec only needs 2 @D ruffs|pg||
nt|barnets: so will make for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin explaing : 3c is his worst hand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: explaining|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, some play that pass is weaker than 3@C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D showed a sound raise to at least 3@C. 3@C instead would have been pre-emptive.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  just thought too good for 2@S :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4@S  5+@D|pg||
nt|rv: Al knows most of big @c systems by heart:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = exactly 4261|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|lml: needing a club finesse you really dont want to be in the grand but ...|pg||
nt|ady: nice cheap trick to begin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yet to see a routine game hand:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: so no double - and a small win for Sweden|pg||
nt|panosk: club ruff if in diamonds that is|pg||
nt|ady: e/w taken the non vul save|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yeah|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you were right :)|pg||
nt|bt: you have to make your mind up if you want to involve partner or do guesswork, sometimes informative bids helps opponents also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice bid showing @D help|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@d suits brink|pg||
nt|szalay: no more time to bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time --  i use notes|pg||
nt|rv: he is a great asset in any commentary panel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S asks controls   [A=2 K=1]|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: Martel's pass shows equal length in the majors |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and 3@H got it in the OR|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, North doubled 5@d and South pulled to 5 @H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  That went to East wko bid the par contract, 6@d|pg||
nt|skaftij:  North then bid 6@h, certainly reasonable |pg||
nt|jbennet: 2 clubs more likely to an improvised call (not willing to rebid AQ-nano-sixth.)|pg||

nt|ady: on that lead making 200 anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H   just making  flat     tht Italiaans may well have been in 6|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer might not believe the even spade break|pg||
nt|tomi2: cant north have @CA instead of @CK and @SQJ here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 7 imps to Sweeden|pg||
nt|oosmanb: switch to @D probably, looks like only chance |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 controls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top level for convention cards of all participants   http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/wbf/2011netherlands/systems.asp|pg||
mb|6S|nt|lml: so south knows they are off the @CQ from the keycard response|pg||
nt|udo: @D discard?|pg||
nt|lml: this looks like at least a small pickup for USA|pg||
nt|szalay: wd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i think @CA undisclosed   Brink gets to game, but maybe Drijver should have bid it|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|jbennet: and indeed it worked fine, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't recall if i mentioned    both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|jbennet: enabling NS to figure out the good fit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed it worked out very well   i particular like the way the auction put @SK in West hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: although it may not be 100% certain to grue that the club 2 is a singleton|pg||
nt|hantveit: angelini did not dear say 3D|pg||
nt|bobholl: brave :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: But, bad splits and game not making today- quite lucky for him|pg||
nt|ady: best defence down 3   but 4@H should make|pg||
nt|kit: with that and 4-card heart support he probably would have Q-bid 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: 4@D is good if its your contract and gets partner involved, it was on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can someone please give me the running scores link|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver hand did NOT have to be this pure|pg||
nt|bobholl: they stopped just in time |pg||
nt|tomi2: but he has to show his fit first, I would take 4@C as a cuebidwith @D fit|pg||
nt|szalay: I'm quite curious why floks lead T from T9xxx, instead of smallest to sho count|pg||
nt|szalay: show|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then traverse  BermudaBowl and country|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: as expected, bocchi bid 5@C and reaped a large reward|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, I do not like to double with void either. 2nt showing 6 clubs an 4d would be my choice|pg||
nt|rv: normally most of relay systems work in following order a) find out partner's shape b) find out full distribution c) find out controls or keycards etc|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: the canadians were a bit lucky|pg||
nt|lml: 6NT by north can go down if the spade and clubs are offside|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely ruff and would bank on @D finesse, whick is correct.|pg||
nt|ady: in fact sorry this is down 2|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have the club pips to restrick to 1 loser|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @S switch they only make 3 now 4 i guess|pg||
nt|szalay: folks|pg||
nt|kit: Makes sense -- well, maybe Levin would make another move with that.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 controls means   AA or AKK  so Muller knows grand slam not making|pg||
nt|rv: there is also provision usually to break relay and switch to natural methods|pg||
nt|rv: best lead for defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this lead holds to 12 tricks   other leads Muller makes small slam|pg||
nt|rv: Muller will take his time to play to first trick|pg||
nt|brgpro: hi en hoi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no worries if trump 22     probably can't make if 40|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: livestream  http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live   i believe it is a table from Venice Cup  England v Indonesia|pg||
nt|rv: can Muller ruff both a @h and 4th @c, he may play to set-up @ds?|pg||
nt|brgpro: after this lead he has to try to ruff twice in dummy|pg||
nt|rv: win @HA, @CA, @SA, @ck pitching a @h, duck a @d?|pg||
nt|brgpro: there is a danger of a trump promotion|pg||
nt|rv: there could be trump promotion if he attempts to ruff both @h and @c|pg||
nt|brgpro: he can come back with trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so what happens if Madala flies @DK?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, the promotion is always there anyway|pg||
nt|rv: I think it is down on accurate defense|pg||
nt|brgpro: i mean the danger of a promotion|pg||
nt|rv: if he plays on @d, dummy can be punched to prevent setting up @ds|pg||
nt|brgpro: not if he wins @hA then @cA then @s back and duck a @d...|pg||
nt|timb: Declarer just has to ruff a heart and a club|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: from south 6@C is better |pg||
nt|lml: with the @SQ protected|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North had a chance to double 2C but resisted - |pg||
nt|xenya: -1 on the lead?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think 3@s will make also|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have only just come back from a week-end away, so I don't even know which teams qualified.|pg||

nt|hantveit: angelini woke up now, and this might be the advantage with boyes double. He has points. 2nt is more defensive|pg||

nt|bobholl: may be only -1 (KQ@C take care of @S|pg||
nt|hantveit: east must hold xx in clubs after the 3 club bid|pg||
nt|hantveit: I do not think it is enough time bob, east might ruff the third club with a low heart|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: as the cards lie of course nothing can hurt a grand|pg||
nt|jbennet: think west is thinking of guarding agaist sp 5-1. (if they were then winning the lead in dummy had been fatal).|pg||
nt|pbundy: he simply may not have wished to lead away from AQ in hearts or the like|pg||
nt|oosmanb: friendly layout|pg||

nt|timb: but there are entry problems|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|udo: should be only 1 more trick for versace|pg||
nt|ady: setting up a 3rd diamond trick in case spades break badly|pg||
nt|ady: if east eventually enters with 3rd round of spades to west hand and runs J@C   south can win and playQ@d  sett up the 10  but no good to east who has 4 clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: but will angelini find the @S shift (he should off course)|pg||

nt|odysseus69: yes South doubled 1D in OR- even you and I would have doubled David - old and conservative as we are|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||

nt|bobholl: wow indeed nice defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: our first slam hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: finally a 6|pg||
nt|ady: slam in either major|pg||
nt|roswolf: team orange creep very close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told Justin Lall led @Dx from Kx   allowing slam to make in USA2 v USA1|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: claim was a bit strange, madala showed his cards to give up, then all watched the hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@S in other room  Brink on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and they saw bocchi got squeezed|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, north threw a trick, yes|pg||
nt|athene: he could have kept @DJ and the heart winner|pg||
nt|famus: Hi all|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: rozdanie of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|barnets: dec lost a spade ruff |pg||
nt|gracelin: Guess this East hand qualify for good 15|pg||
nt|pbundy: someone asked me on the last hand if i would have bid vul with east's hand:  no!  but at these colors, i would have entered|pg||
nt|hantveit: a 21/19 fight these hands are more important then many believes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees  5@C South|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if south had ventured 2nt over 2@H that might have pushed EW into 3@H-1, but it was a bit hard with a 3 count|pg||
nt|antoniz: wietne szkoleniowo|pg||
nt|ady: problem for north  if he does double 2@C   then they will reach the making game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6D doomed but where will this end?|pg||
nt|barnets: in 5@C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 or 4@H ?|pg||
nt|brgpro: in reality it will go down more often than making...however, as i said earlier...there could be a squeeze against N if they are not careful|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 2NT maybe is a fit-inv|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi overcalled 1@H as expected|pg||
nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
nt|ady: possible to get overboard   but 6@D should fail|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, I was disconnected and missed that competitive auction. I will look at it via the MOVIE button.|pg||
nt|barnets: he had it made by not finessing clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: but took club finesse and lost a ruff|pg||
nt|yusufb: oda bole hareretlimi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|hantveit: 10 tricks in minor as the dia are behaving|pg||
nt|bobholl: or namyats :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: how expensive is 7@d?|pg||
nt|brgpro: 5@c for NS on @d guess|pg||
mb|4S|nt|udo: 2NT transfer @C ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: transfer to @C.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well then 1nt is obvious:)|pg||
nt|anton72: good sacriface from OR by England ladies|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't know their range but seems a bit strong to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I think the explanation is @C or @H, but not sure|pg||
nt|bobholl: who is saving against whom ??|pg||
nt|brgpro: 1400...|pg||
nt|brgpro: almost the same|pg||
nt|roswolf: doesnt look too difficult to reach although the @D barrage may confuse things|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3nt is to be avoided|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I would call the north hand a mixed raise ... 2@D suggests a limit raise to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt = @h fit|pg||
nt|udo: looks like:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: invitational values|pg||
nt|udo: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: explained from Versace to Masood|pg||
nt|ady: around 1NT  loooks likely|pg||
nt|wild card: what's the range of 1NT?|pg||
nt|lechcold: wejcie hmhmhm...graniczne:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some play that 4D =D and H|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that Fallenius failed to take Lars' advice and show his second suit - paying the price.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@c = majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: East knows of only 8 trumps between the hands, but may take the push to3@H on a 5-5 hand. |pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D looks a likely spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: if east bids of course|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C would be great now|pg||
nt|brgpro: @s lead to the A then a @d back...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, uncontested 1@H-2NT is limit with 3 or 4 cards; clearly a raise here too|pg||
nt|lml: its pretty close between the two choices|pg||
nt|famus: Hello Udo & William|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N=12-14 EXCEPT  3rd seat vul = 15-17|pg||
nt|wild card: thx|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but not here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North said "content"|pg||
nt|anton72: 5 @d is cool .....even 6 could me made without @h lead and right guessing @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: alot of folks wanted south to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=@S raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may have fixed hinself fortunately south is so strong he can fly solo|pg||
nt|brgpro: the X by N shd garantee @H i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: more spades from west|pg||
nt|lml: a lot more it appears|pg||

nt|skaftij:  Sort of :-)|pg||
nt|ady: off beat pre-empt has caused havoc|pg||
nt|runnerup: here also a nt game sits|pg||
nt|bobholl: poor n will have to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: good question :)|pg||
nt|kit: This will lead to normal 3NT, likely headed down after heart leads|pg||
nt|ahollan1: versace lauria weren't that tough on defense to 5@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: so X by DUboin just showed extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: italians use many DBL to just say  extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it didn't come up -- but for all of spec who play Drury --  what do you bid with South after  P-1@S?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: no ok   north likely considered his hand to flat to look for anythin more than game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1nt opening is 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but maybe N didnt like his distribution 3343|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: is this just club values or a game try?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Game try, I suppose.|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  a make     5@S   a save non vul against vul|pg||
nt|ady: or 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some use 2@d from south to say no pref|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 10 tricks in 4@H for EW but importantly cant make 5@H|pg||
nt|rv: 1n|pg||
nt|brgpro: 1NT, what else? |pg||
pc|cA|nt|ron_sc2002: Pass is clearly forcing in this situation|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: E with 6-5 will bid again|pg||
nt|ady: I meant for n/s   but e/w got there first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  And in that board we see the other site of Brink bidding a daring 5@c drove the opps to high|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are a very good pair never the less|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they are pleased with the way there are playing in the tournament so far ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so the Iceland team knew this would be a VERY VERY difficult match|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: why not 3@C instead of 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: = and so far they were absolutely right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Skaftij types faster|pg||
nt|kit: Either way, West has easy 3@H call.|pg||
nt|hantveit: can they double again?|pg||
nt|bobholl: so 4@S is automatic over 4@H at this vulnarabilty|pg||
nt|bobholl: now sjoert wanted he had bid 5@C|pg||
nt|brgpro: now...from S's point of view, pd can have @s xxx @hKxxx @dAx @cxxxx which makes 6@C a great contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the italians may end up in slam|pg||
nt|brgpro: but how can he develop|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door North expressed his happiness|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 2 down after perfect defense (2 club ruffs) will lose an imp for Sweden|pg||
nt|bt: well commentators all of us suggested @D bids, but he is the one playing the world championships so ...|pg||

nt|brolucius: Swap West's black suits, so his K-Q were assisting partner's help-suit, and he might have gone to 4@H.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin said 3c was game try... and said I havent seen you rejecting a game try in 3 years loool|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has limited dummy entries -- but if South leads a club that will make his life easier.|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe due to the 5-card major.  Some still reject to open 1NT with a good 5-card M|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|famus: has to sac|pg||

nt|udo: sacrifice is successfull, but not so clear for me|pg||
nt|famus: EW different league--to say the least!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now Lauria thinking again|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: looks like..he is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D down 1    but difficulty for north to do anything|pg||
nt|star6ija: no...Stefanov will pass|pg||

nt|ady: 14-16 no-trump I am told so even more reason for north to just go to game|pg||

nt|ady: 3 clubs a possibilty   but not obvious for north with small values|pg||
nt|lml: North-south can set up a diamond for a club pitch now|pg||
nt|xenya: but naturally enough, a @D has been lead|pg||
nt|lml: Just to make it clear to a few who asked.  On a club lead you win the club and you cant set up diamonds fast enough|pg||
nt|lml: east-west keep leading clubs and will set up a trick before you can get a diamond discard going|pg||
nt|lml: on any other lead north-south can play diamonds first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s lead|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will make this |pg||
nt|boedhy:  the @h are also helpfull in 3nt offcourse|pg||
nt|boedhy:  1@s 4@h 2 in each minor|pg||
nt|runnerup: little under point -but makes like it is -something to play and bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh yes, with 11 losers and x-x-x in the help suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: all laughing|pg||
nt|kit: I think declarer will use his one and only dummy entry for a club finesse.  That works, but he will have to lose 3 trump tricks for down 1.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: so you think it is right to give up on making the contract kit ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table|pg||
nt|kit: South has a problem here -- he can't be sure his partner has only 3 spades, unless they always bid higher with 4.|pg||
nt|barnets: rather than try to make it|pg||
nt|kit: why does that give up?  Can't somebody have Ax of hearts?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes Ax hearts is good enough|pg||
nt|anton72: i think W can continued with DBL over 2 @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you are unfamiliar with screens    NE are on one side and SW on the other side of the divider|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all questions are directed to screenmated|pg||
nt|jbennet: must have been a misunderstanding here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and  BOTH players alert partnership bids|pg||
nt|pbundy: i don't think that justin can even go wrong on the lead - vis a vis being able to beat the contract|pg||
nt|jbennet: x followed by pass should not be forcing. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: it sure looks like 2N was for minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2N wasn't alerted|pg||
nt|jbennet: therefore 2NT should not be natural but competitive for miors|pg||
nt|bobholl: i can only say it wins 1 imp probably but if w had bid 7@S :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or top level   http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/wbf/2011netherlands/systems.asp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs 6@S  Brink led @C|pg||
nt|rv: easy for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the point was -- you can't bid 2@C if that guarantees a fit in partner's minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so you need to know how to describe a maximum pass with @C suit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|udo: parscore reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: he cannot afford to leave opps here as far as 2@d could be made as well as 3@cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct   Aronov-Stefanov NT=14-16|pg||
nt|antoniz: +1 imp|pg||
nt|lml: a diamond lead makes it a piece of cake :0|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4@h-3  in board 5?? Might be entered wrong|pg||
nt|bt: in the open room grue was very aggressive and paid a heavy price|pg||
nt|brolucius: The top 8 teams in the round-robin, at end of play tonight, will enter the quarter-finals of the knock-out stage.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pairs need to define whether or not DBL creates force -- and if so, up to what level|pg||
nt|roswolf: a consercvative view by south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: versace led @H after MUCH different auction|pg||
pc|sA|nt|famus: wd--wonder whether the other room wud b pushed to limits|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be hard to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: ok, might be harder now|pg||
nt|athene: lauria doesn't know his partner has quite so many clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry lost connection|pg||
nt|ady: taken the plunge     looks like 2 spade trricks and 2 diamonds     |pg||
nt|panosk: still talking about last hand privately sorry :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: anyway the 1S opening let them stop in time.  Seems to lose nly 1S, 2H and 2D, but maybe 1 3rd D.  Declarer shud have covered DK|pg||
nt|kit: Bathurst can't know for sure where jack of hearts is, but he will continue with queen anyway to make sure of knocking ace of hearts out of dummy.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: Baxter is heading to dummy for a diamond pictch on the heart  and a spade play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exactly!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so he does not have to take the @d decision|pg||
nt|lml: there may be a trump promotion on a diamond play now |pg||
nt|stoffers: Ah, nice|pg||
nt|lechcold: 11 lew jeli rozegramy kara przed kierami (konieczne z uwagi na blokadê kar)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only problem is if somebody has 5@s so will hold up once|pg||

nt|runnerup: entryes are difficult |pg||
nt|skaftij:  This will need a @h guess at least|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Duboin and Hou showing each other the hands|pg||
nt|gracelin: club shift is most damaging now|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will make this |pg||
nt|boedhy:  still not working on my mac..|pg||
nt|brolucius: The team cominb 1st can choose their opponents from those 5-8. The team coming second has the next choice, etc...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: creative lead by Cornell|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: dbl by bertheau on 2@s would have been penalty he says|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me most play DBL forces at 2-level|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: but still i think @DK shift is ok|pg||
nt|athene: if the @CQ got covered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe it will be 1N in the other room|pg||
nt|xenya: S had better duck this and see what happens|pg||
nt|roswolf: and found|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|boedhy:  but with the @h 4-1 you better not be in 3..|pg||
nt|boedhy:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I thought that would be flat at all 60+ tables|pg||

nt|odysseus69: what action over 3S? double or 4H?|pg||
nt|ady: would you not prefer double  than 4@H Victor  and then possibly bid  diamonds if partner responds clubs?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzer rightly suggests that West should think again when 4H is doubled|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this works on my computer|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a cunning low @s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are 4th, you usually find yourself with some stiff opponents that none of the other top 4 wanted to face.|pg||
nt|kit: Well, this sure isn't what I expected|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bt: this is a soft result by ew but bidding game and making it was not in the cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Can someone post the web-address for the ruinning scores?|pg||
nt|rv: on trump back, Bocchi will do well even to make 9 tricks, he will possibly play for @DAK doubleton (only chance)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|skaftij:  nope|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: @CK asked for count there i would imagine|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Should make comfortably|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to go wrong in defense - but Fallenius thought it through|pg||
nt|hantveit: no rush to overtake club q as boye holds HK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|stoffers: yes, will just make now|pg||
nt|ady: that at least gives a chance of reaching a good spot   or possibly 3@SX|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont think so, I looked at bidding and it seemes like Fredin Falleinus had a misunderstanding!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oops|pg||
nt|jbennet: DD 3NT unbeatable.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but east doesnt know it. |pg||
nt|runnerup: east is worried that 1s are not 3-3 .that is one problems out of fju|pg||
nt|jbennet: awkward communication problems. |pg||
nt|jbennet: east doestn know that NS is unable to take 3 d tricks.|pg||
nt|jbennet: west..|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- if he cashes @CK now and crosses to @SQ to take two clubs, what will he discard from dummy? |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they made in the open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was he supposed to start @C firsr?|pg||
nt|yusufb: salvoda direktore bunlar kayda alýnsýn demiþ|pg||

nt|bt: we have 5 teams battling for last two spots|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks to the kibs who sent me the link.|pg||
nt|xenya: so this appears to be a poor line|pg||
nt|jbennet: if he cashes club ace and enters hanf with sp Q then no make.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S9 promised 10  [Rusinow]|pg||
nt|pbundy: nystrom can get up to 8 now ...|pg||
nt|jbennet: this is en axample why top pairs should emphasize NOT on slam bidding in undisturbed auctions, but to define thier methods in common competitive situations. suck as this one.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nystrom asking how light 2@c can be|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: grue saying he does it on 'sick' hands|pg||
nt|pbundy: my guess is he is weighing whether or not to go for 8 tricks - or cash out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: almost always shows 13 cards|pg||
nt|pbundy: if the diamond is off - won't be pretty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 21  Fredin opens intermediate 2@S and plays there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that was hand with the slow auction to perfecta 4@S|pg||
nt|jbennet: note that 2NT balnacing bid was well chosen enabling ew to find laydown 3 cl|pg||
nt|pbundy: a report from a relative of one of the players that they are declaring 2@S in the other room|pg||
nt|brgpro: i usually dont have a max pass, so i will never face that question...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in venice cup  Netherlands 29-0 this set  now trail France by only 5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|lml: so no problems now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes prefer double but I have become modern??? and play 4D=D and H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: it is terribly hard to see that a diamond would help from the south hand|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has a chance to make it even if south ducks the club as many you suggest|pg||
nt|lml: but probably wont|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: small @d lead would have been great by N|pg||
nt|lml: baxter can throw a club on the heart and guess diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is now a push|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @d back costs a trick|pg||
nt|jbennet: good shot so far .|pg||
nt|gracelin: if he ruff spade first he can establish a spade winner to discard one of the losers.|pg||
nt|hantveit: -1 now|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to play @DJ and then @D9 pinning 8 and 7 to go 1 down|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|wild card: in the other room, west raised his partner to 3NT immediately|pg||
nt|wild card: a good bid in my opinion although we can see 3NT won't make on this board|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: now declarer "knows" @Ds are 3-3|pg||
nt|panosk: E will be worried momentarily about a @D ruff but he soon be relieved|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm also watching that room via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kit: The expected play. |pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: New Zealand are the only real surprise in the top 8 at the moment. Well done to them.|pg||
nt|kit: If 4 diamond tricks would get declarer up to 9 he would have gone up king of clubs, but that only gets him up to 8.|pg||
nt|tomi2: would N duck a dia here?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|star6ija: first blood US, unless Aronov steal 8th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but with the @s with open is understandable otherwise you can see the 4 @h in hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|famus: so they get the max|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: Levin figures South has to help him out.  And in fact all this may work.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North thinking now|pg||
nt|brolucius: North wondering whether to ruff (and play a diamond)|pg||
nt|kit: But may not be good enough -- that 7 of hearts is a problem perhaps.|pg||
nt|pbundy: if he hooks and it loses - no more tricks for declarer.........|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy leads China by 15|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am told that once west doubled, e/w had to double declarer for penalties OR bid 2NT|pg||
nt|jbennet: taking AK = sure -500|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  1N-(2@C)-3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: at least :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: as ew lost a dia trick|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kamyk: @D D nie nowinna byæ w pe³ni liczona przy ocenie, czy mamy na inwit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tap tap |pg||
nt|gracelin: now declarer needs to guess the trump.  Lead HQ maybe, when south already showed SA and DAJ10|pg||
nt|gracelin: this way is also good. not touching trumps at all|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am quite sure declarer is now making.  Well done, Lian.|pg||
nt|brgpro: the @d87 falls, so only down 1 if he plays that,|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: can bring down K@H in 3   but cant play a spade from north at the same time|pg||
nt|stoffers: and if declearer had the T@s Sementa would have been squeezed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|ady: that would solve the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D9 looming large|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Baldursson can survive en passant|pg||
nt|skaftij:  even if spade tap|pg||
nt|anton72: 4 down|pg||
pc|d9|nt|stoffers: check that score operator|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he claimed down 1 , saying sorry for misplaying @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: for now i dont say anything...|pg||
nt|stoffers: oh, wrong claim|pg||
nt|stoffers: correct|pg||
nt|boedhy:  9 tricks at the end|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that site works folks so use it instead of the official|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jbennet: he might try heart Q after the spades.|pg||
nt|jbennet: finessing = good chance for -200. No disaster.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|skaftij:  ah|pg||
nt|anton72: pretty cool defence ...but only 200 ....|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|hantveit: sorry, I wrote it before I saw h ace, |pg||
nt|brgpro: now he has to decide the last @d of E if that is the 7 or the 10|pg||
mc|9|nt|jbennet: if so then South ducks and then ducks again on the 2nd heart|pg||
nt|xenya: @DK now for -2 |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Would Drijver think for a while with Queen?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's ruff with his higher trump is called an 'uppercut', The aim is to drive out a higher trump from declarer and perhaps promote partner's trumps.|pg||
nt|kit: simply forcing declarer to ruff was enough -- Levin loses control, even if he plays 10 of hearts here.|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Sorry, wrong claim at first|pg||
nt|roswolf: -3?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 down is good bridge|pg||
nt|nkgupt: isnt the S bidding (preempting) his hand in pieces....think always a bad policy|pg||
nt|brgpro: but now after this lead declarer knows the @s...must be AQ ( maybe the J ) by E|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps he shouldbe bolder:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not much of a guess after @S overcall|pg||
nt|brgpro: so he will surely guess the @d suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: They just explained 3@D was natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: how many tricks karen 11 or 12|pg||
nt|rv: well played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bocchi might have a future in this game|pg||
nt|brgpro: @d J was the right card but after that he had to guess|pg||
nt|rv: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: smolen and 4@S i guess, here|pg||
nt|wild card: by staying somewhat lower, south africa gained 3 IMPs, getting the lead in this match|pg||

mb|2N!|an|!d+!h|nt|rnmalik: 4@H a likely contract for NS and makeable as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however 5D should not escape from a double|pg||
nt|jbgood: very good result for the Aussies here|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The youngsters (ok 30) are among the top 5 in the world|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s looks makeable but deeds some guesses|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: time penalties are looming in this room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D    |pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt 3nt i guess|pg||
nt|rv: most folks play 2@s here as Michaels|pg||
nt|brgpro: EW can make 5@s...but NS will surely save in @h...actually even 6@H is 500 only, could be a small gain...but i think 5@h mightta do the job anyways...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the dutch pairs and italian pairs like to know both suits of 2-suiters|pg||
nt|rv: Blue Club @c O/Cs?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphznv: West noticed 4@S was cold last board|pg||
nt|boedhy:  are they in @h that plays better|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, South had a heavy 2NT available, showing minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another doubled contract made in the open room|pg||
nt|runnerup: spades must be handled -by odds ,but @h must be ducked once -and then you have chances|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it helps a lot if you know both suits|pg||
nt|brgpro: madala might try 5@c here, ( fit in one suit and values there)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Modified Ghestem|pg||
nt|rv: playing Blue @c or similar O/Cs, you sacrifice on 3 level minor preempts and show all variety of 2 suit O/Cs|pg||
nt|brgpro: this kind of fit showing bids helps a lot in high level decisions|pg||
nt|brgpro: personally i would surely try 5@C...|pg||
nt|brgpro: that can also scare them off the bidding|pg||
mb|4N!|an|a little better than 5!d/5!h|nt|athene: ok, some cunning system :)|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they play some convention here..but they will end in 4@S|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: I am not really sure what 2@D is maybe forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am recording the rugby, so no scores, please.|pg||
nt|bt: and grue lall decided 7@C was good here|pg||
nt|brolucius: 30 points but the hands do not fit too well, and the cards lie poorly too.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't upgrade here because 3rd seat vul and 4th seat always 15-17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@D   go figure|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 only (2 imps carry over)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   i was really wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - since N had no entry to give prd a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Ah de Wijs made an uptrick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they in NT also 1 imp|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looking at that scoreboard the first 6 temas are pretty save..|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes N 5@d doubled|pg||
nt|gracelin: Chicken, I expected 4S|pg||
nt|roswolf: so did i|pg||
nt|brgpro: nah...they play prec...|pg||
nt|rv: on Bocchi's 2n, here some play 4@h by East to show raise to 4@s with 1 defensive trick and direct jump to 4@s to show no defensive trick|pg||
nt|rv: that could help in 5 level decision for E-W|pg||
nt|brgpro: usually 4Nt can be the same but it implies @d fit and 5@C shd imply @h fit( in case they bid 5@s in front and N has to decide)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||
nt|lml: seems like we have found the actual auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now for east; what shall he do with 1@s bid in N?|pg||
nt|lml: still should east bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking.......by E|pg||
nt|wild card: the four diamonds in the north hand make it liekly for partner to be short|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and you can see why in these 6 boards|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: przy okazji wyg³osi³em pogl¹d (nie do zrealizowania), ¿e cz³owiek najpierw powinien byæ dziadkiem  a dopiero potem ojcem |pg||
nt|garden2005: dzieñ dobry wszystkim :)|pg||
nt|kit: North will be thinking slam after this start|pg||
nt|ady: yes  2 imps   there was a 2 imp carry over|pg||
nt|brgpro: X=4+@s and pass denied 3?|pg||
nt|brgpro: 1NT must be some kind of @h raise|pg||
nt|brgpro: a good 2@H it looks|pg||
nt|roswolf: players are so awkward:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: four spades is not too far off actually|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AQ@C and @S Ace nicely placed. Key cards for the contract.|pg||
nt|jbgood: brb|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a @s lead did nothing to embarass declarer|pg||
nt|bt: aha rugby is tomorrow, the nz team hopes for bridge and rugby at that time|pg||
nt|xenya: another opportunity for NZ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but this has scored a goal methinks|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS can make 6C if knows to drop Q, In reality, making 5C will be a solid result|pg||
nt|gracelin: and 3NT is equally good.|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow they might get there now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi lost connx again :(|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you play gazilli you could pass now relxedly but now ??|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||
nt|lml: not surprised east thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
nt|antoniz: czeæ Grzesiu:)|pg||
nt|jbennet: is 4 sp really makeable against best defence??|pg||
nt|hantveit: 9 tricks in closed|pg||
nt|bobholl: unlucky lead but reasonable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=game force relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
nt|ady: unsafe balance for north in my opinion|pg||
nt|xenya: at last an easy hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like south bid 4N as to play|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah there is some low level bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, it's tomorrow.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, we are away for the week-end and I set the recorder.|pg||
nt|garden2005: mamy potencja³ i naboje?|pg||
nt|runnerup: now @h possition is clear -so helps to play|pg||
nt|gracelin: actually 4S maybe doubled for 800, but might also push NS into reaching a wrong contract.|pg||
nt|roswolf: it cant cost south to make one voluntary squeak ans bifddding 4@C gets them to the races|pg||
nt|roswolf: this certainly does|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east I feel only woth an invite opposite    but west would have accepted|pg||
nt|ady: is this also 14-16 no-trump Jan ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 15-17|pg||
nt|oosmanb: board 6 has some interesting auctions at other tables|pg||
nt|andersk: Better cash he's 6 tricks, If he looses a club trick early he might go 4 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems to North that his @s will not be pulling weight|pg||
nt|garden2005: no jak teraz @h? siê czuj¹|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tak Grzesiu...niestety naboje co drugi lepy|pg||
nt|kamyk: chyba nieporozumienie: Gawrys przyj¹³, ¿e 3BA, to m³ode|pg||
nt|garden2005: Gawry móg³ daæ 4@s po 3NT, ¿e ma dwa kolory|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w³¹snie Grzesiu s³yszysz wystrza³ lepym nabojem|pg||
nt|kamyk: to przyk³ad, co znaczy sta³a para - ona ju¿ tam kiedy by³a; para zestawiona nawet z dobrych graczy w trakcie przygotowañ wszystkiego nie zdo³a omówiæ|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S is stronger than 4@S and promises some values (at least one control somewhere).|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: the law of the total trumps :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 trumps for NS...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm, can you concede tricks that you cannot possibly loose?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he wrote -100|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Don't know the law too well|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nor really, but operator or players watching arent to say anything |pg||
nt|xenya: you can make 6 here -- but you don't want to be there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  aggresive but controled bidding,  combined with perfect play and some luck :)|pg||
nt|ady: thx   15-17   but even so vould be facing a poor heart holding   west has a nice toppy hand with good hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: Hi David and Lars! I can assure you that the kiwi team has the right focus on today's matches:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seven would have been fine if south had diamond ace rather than KQ|pg||
nt|bt: how did england do? wales was 4th i think|pg||
nt|brgpro: i am surprised that W passed on 4NT...with his max 1@s opening...|pg||
nt|rv: 4n by Madala did scare Wijs:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: muller - de wijs play DBL in these situations as interest in bidding 5@s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: When North cannot cue-bid in hearts, declarer will know of one hole in his hand.|pg||
nt|brgpro: this is already too high|pg||
nt|ady: looks 1 over the top|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not many imps exchanged this set|pg||
nt|brgpro: they play prec @c, so he has a ceiling of his 1@s opening...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|skaftij:  but...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  4 imps to Iceland probably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then is thin though with only 8 trumps|pg||
nt|brolucius: The text-books advise you not to bid a grand if there is any chance that the other room will miss the small slam. They also have some advice (I forget it at the moment) about how ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: many aces you need for a grand slam.|pg||
nt|garden2005: w ocenie od zg³aszaj¹cych mi na priv Kibiców, Gawry nie mai³ na 5@d|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -partscore board ?|pg||
nt|jbennet: how is 4sp makeable?? |pg||
nt|skaftij:  1@c Relay Precision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D looks like a checkback |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sry|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't see any reason declarer should guess to drop HQ doubleton offside.|pg||
nt|roswolf: impressive bidding judgment -truly World Class|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the lead has changed|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt is best :)|pg||
nt|kit: on board 21 N-S bid slam off 2 aces, but defense missed the cash -- so match tied up|pg||
nt|szalay: whats your policy with 4333?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol..just said not many imps exchanged :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphznv: Duboin picked 3 times the 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|famus: can he hit @cs?|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW play sound 1 openings|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2NT ask and Alfredo now bid 3NT, max no shortness|pg||
nt|lechcold: po tym ataku no problem|pg||
nt|odysseus69: notice that Zack did not get carried away and bid only 3S where others might have bid game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West trying to speed up, they are 2 boards behind|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South sorry, think for being slow|pg||
nt|bt: anyway i think lall bid way too much at the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think it has come up yet   EW  1st discard = odd/even|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW leads  2nd/4th|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think South should be showing any encouragement -- he has a dead minimum 2@C opener|pg||
nt|brolucius: North thought he was too strong to sign off in 4@S, with two kings in his hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: playing 3N i open after south rebid 2N|pg||
nt|roswolf: italian flair patrick:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: let's see :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=4+@D|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|stoffers: If one of the pairs finds out they will ofcource correct the score|pg||
nt|kit: This is a good example of control bid crazy, when controls aren't the problem.  Tricks are.|pg||
nt|barnets: and did not bid spades at all|pg||
nt|hantveit: I prefer @h|pg||
nt|hantveit: if you find partner with KQxx or KJxx in a major suit. It dos not really help you if it is @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry (westra) says 4th best from your longest :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: sounds like a wise guy :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: dont u think he needed to show that? at least X 4NT...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: maybe he didn't want to invite 5@s with his balanced hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: but as i said ealier...5@H does the job and even not doubled...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think they use DBLs to say  willing to bid 5@S opposite weak hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S bid is very wide range|pg||
nt|brgpro: ok, but he surely wants to help pd to decide who is saving on this hand?|pg||
nt|rv: that is why I suggested, it is important to differentiate decent and pure pre-emptive @s raise,can use 4@h/4@s|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@s is a practical bid, i do agree especially after a limited 1@s opening...but i do think W shd have Xed 4NT to tell pd about his max|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lechcold: silny trefl u Szwedów..dalej pewnie masa sztucznoci, których nie znam:(|pg||
nt|lechcold: ale skoñczy siê na 3BA:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: Panie 48:0 po 6 rozdaniach vs. Maroko:) mo¿e to oznaka prze³omu?|pg||
nt|lechcold: kierowy by³by morderczy|pg||
nt|boedhy:  NS can make 3@c tho|pg||
nt|xenya: well N had passed over 3@S -- no reason to be clever now i think|pg||
nt|brgpro: might well open 1@s and they will be overboard here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brolucius: You can see the other auction by putting your cursor over the Open Room result.|pg||
nt|bt: unless their firm agreement is that 5NT in all auctions is "pick a slam"|pg||
nt|runnerup: you lose 1 @s -1 @h -throw one to @c k -and 1 @c ofcause|pg||
nt|xenya: especially as he should know @Hs are likely to be 3-3 for his side|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now they surely stop in 5@S.|pg||
nt|roswolf: in practice this may well be the decisive hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the first 6 bds have been full of drama|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 chances to attack @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C 5+5+|pg||
pc|h3|nt|famus: a natural @s lead -wont get them anywhere|pg||
nt|ady: if this lead is from length the 9@C will ensure only 2 club losers  so the game depends on A@D right|pg||
nt|brgpro: my net is so slow...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=short @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this looks very macho - tarzan at its best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's happening to me too Jack|pg||
nt|brgpro: so Muller might try 4@s|pg||
nt|brgpro: but i think they won't be doubled here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those peeking at auction from other room   vanProoijen 2@D=11-15 HCP, 5+@H 4+@D|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@H = 15+  5-5 , rest goes without saying|pg||
nt|stoffers: Duboin knowing about a diamondlooser now (no 4@d)|pg||
nt|lechcold: bardzo trafny rebid Gawrysia|pg||
nt|kamyk: gdyby Gawrys powiedzia³ zwyczajnie 2@D, to co sie licytuje z kart¹ E? Mówi¹c 1BA uproci³ rozdanie.|pg||
nt|ady: tricky defence here|pg||
nt|ady: need to win A@S   andplay 9@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 9 tricks whatever defence does- cant get club ruff and 2 heart tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  alot of comment on this remark.|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  can't win this without help from defense|pg||
nt|kit: they should, but it is too high.|pg||
nt|bobholl: world champion 1993 :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: protecting the @DK on the lead doesn't really help EW any|pg||
nt|jbennet: even if taking right view in spades and hearts no way to handle the 2nd heart loser. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry, i missed it    Fredin DID  DBL 3N on 22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know if NS play Smith   their CC doesn't really describe carding very well|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't see a way to prevent 1 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table starts  1@S-(2@S)-3@H|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ryskiel_: czy Volva produkowane pzrez Szwedów s¹ te¿ sztuczn¹ metod¹ robione?|pg||
nt|jbgood: may be a double game swing if he takes the heart finesse and finds the trump|pg||
nt|bt: anyway the ns auction at the other table was one of those toughies and they failed, it is good for my team so i am happy|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tylko nie w pika|pg||
nt|garden2005: jedne z komentarzy do rozdania: "mia³ powiedzieæ 4@H  a jak P ma m³ode to przeniesie siê 5@C na 5@D  a tak to du,,,,,,,,! " :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: witamy Cezarego Balickiego :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: ech.... zasypalicie mnie ju¿ tyloma propozycjami innej licytacji G-K, ¿e nawet nie wiem która przytoczyæ ... ka¿da jest lepsza ni¿ ta co siê zdarzy³a|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would of course bid 6@S with the @SK.|pg||
nt|kit: Better I think to find out if you have strength for slam at 4-level and worry about controls at 5-level rather than other way around.|pg||
nt|barnets: would you rebid  2@S or 2N with south hand ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Close.|pg||
nt|barnets: 2N is the winner|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: once south plays the clubs he now knows he has the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well spotted David|pg||
nt|ady: got the first bit right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might well find H9|pg||
nt|ady: still not that great a game even with a suitable hand with west|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: games that win are good games :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Here North was able to ask for key cards, so there was no problem. Sweden gained advantage from their spade pre-emption at the other table.|pg||
nt|kit: I agree close -- either could work out.  Probably 2NT a favorite on balance.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North said : do not go down in 5|pg||
nt|kit: Granted 5@S somewhat unlucky to go down.  But with better bidding they wouldn't have been facing the bad luck.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Give North the other black jack and it would be not so bad.|pg||
nt|hantveit: sounds like an old wise guy|pg||
nt|roswolf: italy bid game ,got doubled in the other room|pg||
nt|brgpro: Muller is hoping to see @cA in dummy...he is hoping...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what does Duboin lead on this auction where Muller bid NT opposite known shortness??|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: for example if partner has the @DA and you need to set up a spade and have declarer misguess diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moysian fit = 4-3   is this Mini-Moysian  or is that 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: a swing of 25/26 imps |pg||
nt|hantveit: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems normal|pg||
pc|d2|nt|famus: wud he duck???|pg||
nt|ady: 1 trump out of the way|pg||
pc|dK|nt|stoffers: 6 (lucky) imps to Iceland on bd21, they take what they get against opponents like this|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think i wouldnt have passed with north although i opened light|pg||
nt|barnets: yes the @CJ needs to be a spade|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: nowhere to put the diamond losers anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find that duck|pg||
nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|kemperg: he knows @CA with partner, so @DA on leader|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ju¿ wiem ¿e Volvo produkuje siê teraz w Chinach, wiec na pewno sztucznie|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Sorry everyone I must leave now, thanks to all the organizers|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  6 the auction was 1N-all pass|pg||
nt|star6ija: Karaivanov would be surprized realizing that Trendafilov still is not shorter in trumps than him|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still a big gain for Australia|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: actually maybe it was not that hard|pg||
pc|h6|nt|runnerup: maybe -too dfficult -because rigth 2 @s to defence|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|lml: he can probably afford a heart now for the uptrick ... we know it will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S had @s 4 in his hands to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  6   Muller in 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: this is a big swing for usa|pg||
nt|brgpro: mightta go 2 down if madala decides to play E for @dK10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if DBL shows extra offense, then West hand can't do that|pg||
nt|rv: he might play for @dkt doubleton with East|pg||
nt|rv: restricted choice and go 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: problem with dbl as they play it, is that you cannot show interest in doubling opps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: in return you can find good saves when you have an offensive hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: so, in this case..the traditional way works|pg||
nt|rv: that is why Muller's bid can't be so wide ranging|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: East was unable to read the opening lead of the @S9.|pg||
nt|xenya: think i'll get coffee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we know nothing about East hand except he wants to play 3N opposite 5152 / 5053|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will be slaughter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs might have pulled with 56|pg||
nt|brgpro: he was hoping to see @cAx...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|famus: Tahir must b cursing himself for not switching @ds--this is turning into a rout|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Better :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes sorry|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that it matters.|pg||
nt|bt: decl has 12 easy tricks now and a bundle of imps to sweden|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: if his partner has the @DA, the contract is always dead|pg||
nt|ady: should be in game   but I dont feel east should be the one to deccide if there an invitational method|pg||
nt|brgpro: like the poker players yelling on the river: @cA please! one time!|pg||
nt|roswolf: never play me for the perfect hand i never have it - applies here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just mentioning since East @C suit could have been @H on this auction|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: or a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice play|pg||
nt|udo: i think he should find the duck,,,he knows @D are running most of the time|pg||
nt|lechcold: prawdopodobnie Szwedzi nie byli w stanie zbadaæ co maj¹ w treflach|pg||
nt|runnerup: so no attack to Nyström for pushing ns to game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director in the room ....we will not finish all the boards i think|pg||
pc|d6|nt|boedhy:  but then west at some point would have bid his @s and making 3 is no problem so think this will be a push|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: s³owem wylosowali z³¹ sekwencjê sporód wielu lepszych|pg||
nt|ady: will need to untangle the spades|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphznv: i think i missed somethink|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: something|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may all hand on the meaning of 3NT. If that is serious or non-serious, that would effect how strongly North should bid - whether he was worth going past 4@S with his second ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: king.|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer believed king of spades is singleton he might have had a double-dummy line to make on trump end-play.  But Levin could easily play king from Kx.|pg||

nt|ady: club lead to beat 4@H   can get 2 ruffs |pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 2@H would be strong game interest, nothing about @H|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2@d shows maybe normal openning... or long suit game try|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: the bulgarians like the red cards|pg||
nt|ady: as usual   honor 10 of  suit in dummy when leading the Queen|pg||

nt|boedhy:  no spade lead.... |pg||
nt|skaftij:  It is quite a task, both to operate and to comment, you are doing a great job Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i was wondering why he did not discard the heart loser and looked into his hand and was missing lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: all bids are alerted|pg||
nt|gracelin: China recovered 13 imps on the hand EW stopped in 3NT with their 30 HCP after south opened 1S.  Italians went down in 5C in other room.|pg||

nt|oosmanb: wow probably 6@C now|pg||
nt|andersk: good bidding here. |pg||
nt|xenya: Sweden and NZ are currently neck-in-neck, with Japam trailing by 1VP|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it does indeed look as if Dhondy's 2@d (after 1@c-1NT) was spades and another - if so, that would explain Senior's 2@s, if not why she didn't bid 2@h en route|pg||
nt|anton72: Dhondy bid 2 @c ....|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sorry|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|wild card: but after this start that will be too hard|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, NS pushed EW to the 3-level|pg||

nt|brolucius: 3@D did its work.|pg||
nt|kit: But still probably unable to make 3NT.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very good result for England next door|pg||
nt|pbundy: there seems to be some misunderstanding here - no?|pg||
nt|brgpro: pass...i won't but it is a good judgement here with the @c ruff coming, 4@h is -1|pg||

nt|szalay: trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd/4th leads mean  LOW from worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|szalay: to be honest small trump is the best lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: clarification just in case other North Americans are in the room|pg||
nt|bobholl: despite the unlucky lead this won't make|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: EW made it easy to stay low|pg||
nt|star6ija: why then they did not use them during the previous board :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol..i think they discussed it|pg||

nt|roswolf: 3@d aldo suggests a singleton somewhere|pg||
nt|bobholl: very inspired pass by sjoert|pg||
nt|brgpro: now a @s for -2|pg||
nt|szalay: 3 down is possible yet|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: a hard slam to reach but I thought they might|pg||
nt|lml: south has to do something other than 4@h I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: too difficult to find out that either of them has enough entries|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lars, you have any idea of how/why West should bid 3@C? Did he pull the wrong card from the box?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes sweden had a misunderstanding looks like 2@H/1@D[precision] was michaels as many play 2@D/@d as natural |pg||
nt|bt: they play some 2 Major jumps as 4 of that suit and a longer minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H showed hearts and another suit or at least that is what west thought|pg||
nt|bt: west played that convention|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usually best, I find, to treat 1@D as natural initially - even if it may be short.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever of the US North to keep quiet on his amazingly good clubs.|pg||
nt|bt: they only played together for 10 yrs, har to get (1m)-2M right :)|pg||
nt|bt: hard|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer ducks to break communications between West and East.|pg||
nt|kit: In other room Fleisher violated and opened 1@H on the strong 4-card suit -- to his regret, as he wound up in 3@H.|pg||
nt|anton72: verry bad lead by E ...but result is perfect for ENG|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of course, 4@hx would not have been so hot without the 2-2 trump break|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like down at least 2 -- the third undertrick will be the fight|pg||
nt|szalay: fight with Diamonds|pg||
nt|davidstern: The @DJ onside sort of - either way finesse|pg||
nt|davidstern: I will make one statement - he wont go down here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC just says  2@C=Stayman :(|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@D just denied four spades|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lml: one of the good things about passing is that you are not defending 4@S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Anders we spoke too soon|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ends in 5@s|pg||
nt|xenya: now it should make|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps grue thinks 2@C shows diamonds?|pg||
nt|jbennet: but on the other hand...|pg||
nt|jbennet: 12 tricks available in clubs.|pg||
nt|szalay: like a south african match:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry denied 4@H could have 4@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1:  7  Weinstein in 2N West|pg||
nt|boedhy:  So his hormons could be bothering him|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: do you see my profile as Jan?|pg||
nt|kit: At both tables E-W were temporarily in 3@D whih doesn't make.  But very difficult for N-S to know that.  That is why preempts can be effective.  Even when they seem to get you to a ...|pg||
nt|kit: bad contract, they can still work.|pg||
nt|barnets: if east shifts a club dec may make the hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will play for hearts 4-2, because of the 3@D bid, which leaves West with more non-diamonds than East.|pg||
nt|kit: How can it ever make?  4 hearts, 1 diamond, 1 clubs, 2 spades at most I think.|pg||
nt|barnets: by takiing 4 heart tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: Looks like it.|pg||
nt|barnets: and enplayinq west in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Then 2@C showed @C + @S|pg||
nt|ady: made in OR    chance for China|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't see 6H making on this one.|pg||
nt|roswolf: north doing a lot of bidding - i would have given up on slam long ago|pg||
nt|gracelin: he does have a standard 2 opening and south gave a raise.|pg||
nt|gracelin: also some sign of life with the 3NT bid (rather than 4H).|pg||
nt|jbennet: 11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 22 looks like Hurd will be down 2 in 3NX|pg||
nt|pbundy: even with a diamond out and a spade switch?|pg||
nt|jbennet: and only 10 if defence attack spades when being on lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: to pick up J 4th in @d, he will have to finesse W|pg||

nt|bobholl: even now not made yet|pg||
nt|tomi2: very light 1@c opener here, imo deserves that score. 1@C odes not make life difficult for opps, does not really encourage partner to raise clubs or lead them and that hand had no ...|pg||

nt|odysseus69: my good friend Dr Haase just pointed out that heart 9 was no good on last since decarer could run to dummys 10|pg||
nt|barnets: he makes 4hearts 1 club 3 spades and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|kit: I see -- we are of course putting the 9 of spades through.|pg||
nt|roswolf: return pard's suit -easy|pg||
nt|ady: now should be down|pg||
nt|davidstern: Best not to go there Al. There has been discussion about lack of disclosure on cards|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lechcold: i no to gra Upmark|pg||
nt|boedhy:  2@s no problem for declarer 3@s on the other hand...|pg||
nt|szalay: trump is standout, isnt it?|pg||
nt|ady: now heart  |pg||
nt|jbennet: yet another passivity warning .|pg||
nt|hantveit: NS can just push spade|pg||
nt|davidstern: And things may change|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lechcold: na to|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: grue saying he bid 2NT to make them miss their @d fit|pg||
nt|jbennet: west did not act over 2 clubs |pg||
nt|ahollan1: it worked!|pg||
nt|hantveit: or 1H|pg||
nt|hantveit: @h|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, u can't cover too much on cc, as long as u explain it at the table, u r fine|pg||
nt|davidstern: I could point you to some cards which lack the basic basic fundamentals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: compare this to one of the Brazilian pairs CC including  50 pages of Supplementary Notes|pg||
nt|davidstern: For my Aussie friends out there - Transnationals http://tinyurl.com/66l7slm|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont have a need for supplemental notess as long as the card shows the basic responses which some dont even do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: aren't they all playing the spring nationals David?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, i used to play in this event, do u think i will go through their notes? |pg||
nt|brgpro: doesnt matter how thick it could be...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: coach's job to identify the unusual things that may come up :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: NO Al the Australian Open Team played in the qual of the BB and stayed for TN|pg||
nt|brgpro: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i meant  the australian spectators :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ah no only seniors and womens on and 02:53 in the morning|pg||
pc|d3|nt|boedhy:  sorry @c 3 offcourse|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some teams have a coach, one of whose duties is to research the bidding methods of the upcoming opponents. Here a coach would have ensured that E/W knew what 1@D meant and which ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: defenses would apply.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Brink did well to get in the auction  --  many would PASS|pg||
nt|barnets: no we play a low spade from dummy at end to our 9|pg||
nt|ady: then clear diamonds|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think he will be able to finesse clubs now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he claimed 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: overtrick??|pg||
nt|star6ija: but they are going to be back shortly as far as I know Aronov - Stefanov simpathy to the higher levels|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but it was me who did not notice that on the king of diamonds \e played the ten |pg||
nt|ady: diamonds played for declarer by defence  so an overtrick last hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: maybe he played the Jack of Diamonds instead of 9|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but did you watch the tempo|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no really they are very very good|pg||
nt|barnets: west wins the 10 and is enplayed|pg||
nt|hantveit: thx|pg||
nt|hantveit: but my english still stinks|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: new leader :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin thinking |pg||
nt|szalay: I doubt that lead survives this board|pg||
nt|tomi2: think giving partner the @H ruff, cashing ak of clubs and wait for 2 dia tricks is best here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|antoniz: g³êboki impas 98 trefl|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done from boye|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lml: and long souths|pg||
nt|lml: suits|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: W asks about 3@h bid to S (screen is lowered first)|pg||
nt|athene: with the hearts cleared|pg||
nt|ady: souths trumps not high enough to defeat this|pg||
nt|roswolf: he may have been better ducking the first diamond altogether|pg||
nt|bobholl: south counting east's points |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pbundy: just as long as he didn't have to declare 2NT :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: and east didnt act over 2 NT (he had a cheap 3 cl bid available).|pg||
pc|d9|nt|barnets: not an unreasonable play|pg||
nt|ady: 10@D  signled  entry higher ranking of sensible suit    |pg||
nt|rv: my link to Trans-nationals|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: a possible alternative was to finesse the @CJ earlier, before knocking out the second spade|pg||
nt|udo: next 7 imps for italy  5@S xed vs 6@S xed,,,,,,really one-qay-match so far|pg||
nt|ady: correct    |pg||
pc|c8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|roswolf: leading pards presumed suit!?|pg||

pc|s9|nt|ryskiel_: mam niepotwierdzone wieci, ¿e na drugim stole zagrano te¿ 3 BA, co mnie nie dziwi specjalnie|pg||
nt|gracelin: why SQ, To put all pressure on West.|pg||
nt|hantveit: he had to play that way to avoid -2|pg||
nt|bobholl: North still confident of beating this|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
mc|7|nt|athene: even if it loses, north can't attack the hearts|pg||
nt|udo: one-way|pg||

nt|xenya: so 1 imp to USA1|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: trying to get some time back|pg||
nt|boedhy:  very quick play so far|pg||
nt|ady: e/s have a slam|pg||
nt|oosmanb: probably some "polite" words being exchanged in Italian now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not after the board -- it was during the board -- I dont speak italian so I am not able to translate|pg||
nt|hlortz: some teams cant afford a coach :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director back in the room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he will not leave here ...we are too late|pg||
nt|xenya: i retract, sorry|pg||
nt|szalay: no|pg||
nt|szalay: small trump|pg||
nt|szalay: after cash AK|pg||
nt|kit: end-play for down 2 and a push|pg||
nt|ady: still 10 back for China   keeps them in the hunt|pg||
nt|pbundy: this could be a danger hand for USA  2, tho - if the spade switch is not found, 11 tricks are there|pg||
nt|pbundy: as we just saw.........|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  23  [3NW=]  Hurd 2@D East|pg||
nt|hantveit: interesting in closed as they failed 3nt by two tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt is very optimistic|pg||
nt|roswolf: more distribution here|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w outgunned though|pg||
nt|brgpro: many of the agreements won't come up at all, |pg||
nt|rv: world class field of 150+teams, Meckwell, Fantunes for Angelini, Z-men, H-men for Monaco and many other top stars|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lml: and canada went ahead ... but with a lot of luck|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: 10-12 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: they bid spades which was not the best slam|pg||
nt|lml: but the suit broke|pg||
nt|antoniz: Pawe³ to normalny kontrakt|pg||
nt|bt: ns took 10 tricks at the other table in clubs, and gained 5 imps, strange game this|pg||
nt|brolucius: A close friend of mine, Marc Smith, was coach to the young Thailand team in a recent world championship. (They had to practice in a  nearby horse-racing stadium, due to lack of ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: facilities). His great moment was when his proteges defeated Meckstroth/Rodwell's USA by a good margin!|pg||
nt|szalay: and 3@S, a ruff and 2 trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st seat favorable  1N=9-12|pg||
nt|gracelin: Something must be wrong there. China kept on giving Bocchi chances and Bocchi gracefully rejected everytime.|pg||
nt|nkgupt: other tbl 4@h from S so almost impossible to defend|pg||
nt|brgpro: will make a game in @H for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room 4 @H in south no @C lead :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: comes up a lot, generates swings|pg||
nt|athene: NS might be in a lot of trouble now they have gone past their 8-card fit|pg||
nt|pawel90:  wolalbym 5@c graÄ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable means  you not vul   opponents vul|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2M=M+m (54),|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also called "green"|pg||
nt|pbundy: for those wanting plenty of swings and action - here it is....|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, we look at all the cards, but it looks like a pass on easts hand on 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: all shapely except north  4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@h and shd be reached easily|pg||
mb|3C!|an|mixed raise|nt|lml: well done |pg||
nt|lml: to get to slam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: indeed, nice bidding in open room|pg||
nt|udo: 2@D or 2 @H ?|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a make e/w|pg||
nt|panosk: gd result for Sweeden a bit fortunate too|pg||
nt|runnerup: this will be another push one way or another (3 @c=) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite a good West hand, with two aces and four trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D is NOT 1-suited --  that hand opens 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do not play namyats|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: blame me |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: Weinstein did it well in board 7...almost equalized it :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a lesson there about signalling with card you can't afford to play|pg||
nt|ady: another part score hand   clubs likely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the rest of the play correct...except the ten instead of the 5 at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is thepressur of thecBB QF|pg||
nt|bobholl: "muiderberg" 5@H 4+ minor would have been nice in S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Might be what 2@H means|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H seems predestined|pg||
nt|ahollan1: historical trivia    namyats = Stayman spelled backwards|pg||
nt|brgpro: N could have made this contract in the OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Stayman didn't invent the convention   or   Stayman for that matteer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just first to do the write-up|pg||
mb|4H|nt|wild card: fleisher showing a 12-14 hand with four spades, I presume|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For NS 3 NT can make.|pg||
nt|boedhy:  board 24 again sorry to say but a very good result for the boys|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: on this board David or ?|pg||
nt|ady: thats 7 tricks in the bag|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: How strong is it asks W|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could have made it tho...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S answars "Usually 15-17"|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Jan, you could give Sementa a piece of paper to alert and explain his statements :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Very aggresive 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|kit: Double is responsive I believe.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C 12+ points and 3+ clubs.|pg||
nt|ady: playable 4@H   but does not make|pg||
nt|ady: could be some more imps for China|pg||
nt|gracelin: and Italy in other room also went down in the 4S that need a good guess in Heart which became easy after south's double.|pg||
nt|hantveit: prec?|pg||
nt|bobholl: they bid 1nt 3nt too optimistic in east|pg||
nt|brgpro: they play mini NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 6NT isnt terrible.  It just needs the spade finesse|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not easy to see which line is best but ruffing 2 @c in dummy was possible...|pg||
nt|szalay: I prefer to play this DBL rather 'cards' than pure penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7 boards 46 imps|pg||
nt|rv: 3@c is mixed raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: will end in 3 NT, i think|pg||
nt|famus: well this wud certainly propel them higher than desired|pg||
nt|boedhy:  10 opposite 11 and a quick 9 tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes 3@s down one|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could have been another 4 imps |pg||
nt|boedhy:  and those boards tend to add up...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I dont think thats a good idea at the moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8  playing Tarzan Precision  Muller passed 1@S so Einarsson balanced 2@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Not the best dummy you saw|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand  doubleton @S led thru Q to partner's AKJxx|pg||
nt|kit: That will get E-W to hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: COME BACK   FANTUNES -all is forgiven|pg||
nt|gracelin: so China is only down 17 and there are still two slam swings to their favor.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they opened 1NT showing 16-18 in the open room|pg||
nt|davidstern: Team members for TN teams and I found it hard to find can be seen at|pg||
nt|davidstern: http://registration.bridgechamp.com/tourn/Veldhoven.11/ParticipantsTeams.asp?qtournid=899&qdetails=1&qcountryid=All|pg||
nt|brgpro: it does make sense to play a @h to the 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: I see no reason for south to try something, at most 24 points in the combined hands|pg||
nt|wild card: and I count only 8 tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|wild card: on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|ady: likely to end in 8|pg||
nt|anton72: unlucky values and numbers of diamonds in E |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 3@h=good raise to 3@S (alas, on this lie one too high) - and 4@s is two too high |pg||
nt|ahollan1: we were told possible adjustment to hand from 5th set|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H just fails by 1 trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room 23 Versace 5@SX|pg||
nt|brgpro: a mixed raise of 3@c ( usually unbal. 4 card raise)|pg||
nt|rv: many play cue as good rasie (10+hcp) and jump cue as mixed raise (4+trumps 5-8 hcp)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|udo: but cards dont lie very nice|pg||
nt|famus: 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ lead would be very nice|pg||
nt|skaftij:  and reached it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@C  gazilli,  2@S less than 8  no 3@S|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@c = 15+|pg||
nt|lml: but of course this is the normal contract|pg||
nt|xenya: but very tough to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Running scores in Bermuda Bowl http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881 |pg||
nt|skaftij:  and agressive 2@h bid here vul |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: correct score on 24 now|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@C= means that 1@C should be 3 down|pg||
nt|runnerup: no -they will get + 150 -200 now -wd|pg||
nt|roswolf: that dbl looks  a tilt double|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will be better off to take out this|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wouldnt|pg||
nt|gracelin: his opening was shaded and he has distribution.|pg||
nt|gracelin: on perfect defense, the decision is 790 Vs. 800|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the problem is that EW have, basically, two balanced hands|pg||
nt|anton72: yes u are right ...even K @d onside still not enough|pg||
nt|pbundy: which hand might that be, al?|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 1NT rebid is 13-16?|pg||
nt|roswolf: wearing orange tinted glasses bob:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: maybe more|pg||
nt|bobholl: sure :0:);(|pg||
nt|brgpro: direct cue can be on 3, but mixed raise is surely 4+ with distribution|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: Martel's 1@S showed either 5+@C or some shortness|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: or natural|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Brink will struggle here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: if north played 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he'd either open 1N with 12-14 or rebid 1N to show strong NT|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1 spade and 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ok some play in 3Nt here|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H is safe.  3@H treacherous.  4@H, reached in other room, hopeless.|pg||
nt|hantveit: no way to stop here either|pg||
nt|bigtrain: certainly makes bidding with east easier to understand|pg||
nt|davidstern: The weather here has been cool 3-10 degrees but nice autumnal colours and often sunny - but now rainy|pg||
nt|josj: will improve again later this week|pg||
nt|davidstern: And the best thing here is of course..................The unlimited Lavazza coffee served by very attractive ladies (and men)|pg||
nt|brgpro: considering the @h suit itself, if they are 3-2, it makes no difference, if they are 4-1, u cant guard sing. Q or J anyways, can only guard sing. 9|pg||
nt|josj: must be an unusual sight for you, David...autumnal colours in October, I assume :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: The following has been reported by a female: the men not attractive?:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: however, there is @d in consideration as well...u r afraid of possible @d ruffs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: She might be wrong David|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has entries in dummy to play a @H up, 2 @d entries|pg||
nt|davidstern: I cant make any statement without people getting the wrong idea so I will leave it there but I think she is....|pg||
nt|brgpro: without the @d problem i believe the right way is to play a @h to the 10|pg||
nt|brgpro: say u have @dAkx in dummy|pg||
nt|davidstern: The spade ten means something but I am not sure what - could be reverse attitude|pg||
nt|brgpro: i said, if u have @dAkx in dummy then the right way is to play a @h to the 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA2 has extended its lead over USA1   all the way to 9|pg||
nt|davidstern: Is it right to play to the @H missing the nine? Not sure about that|pg||
nt|davidstern: 10|pg||
nt|brgpro: considering single suit, it is definitelly the right way|pg||

nt|xenya: lack ot entries to dummy though|pg||

nt|famus: duck 100%|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: GREAT to watch such leads :)|pg||
nt|famus: dont blame NS to be in 3NT--how much they go down is moot|pg||
nt|ady: if west played 4@H  a trump lead may beat it|pg||
nt|boedhy:  sorry have to go back in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: non vul so no worries really|pg||
nt|szalay: 8 of @H is mighty card|pg||
nt|xenya: well this makes -- but you need to pull out the right card each time you are on lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: it was scored as 110 - but from the play, i'd thought he'd gone down 1|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: this looks to make with no problems with the clubs working|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 4-1|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Hi Sybarra cover for me..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: E had @h A in his hand - puts it back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do not know why|pg||
nt|gracelin: there is no way to misguess on this one and Shi is a very reliable player.|pg||
nt|pbundy: WRONG prediction again here by yours truly!|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|anton72: in W possition I prefere to play and bid 2 NT inv + |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the jump to 4@s is optimistic, but change a couple of cards in the West hand, and put @dA onside, and it might very well have play |pg||
nt|bobholl: @C are terrible but @S are fine|pg||
nt|rv: top 8 to qualify after 15 rounds, above scores at end of 8 rounds|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: 500 here without much bother; that's fine when your game is touch and go|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you lose 3 imps if they make the thin 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they should know their defensive signals at this level|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not easy to see that he could play a @h back...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i tend to think this lead would work more often than any other|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C was a worthwhile bid because it might allow North to complete to 3@C if he held three clubs.|pg||
nt|gracelin: anything but a spade return may see 990, with all dummy's spades going on the good clubs, after 2 round of trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: invite and not a definitive answer|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@D shows @h fit and @d values which sounds like music to S|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT a possibility played by North     likely to make 4@H as well|pg||
nt|brgpro: can make 5 in fact|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed - even us mortals might bid the same:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|bt: the thought here is that if you want to beat this kontrakt, A@H has to "work" for the defence|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a 'failed Stayman' auction, where responder looks for a major and does not find one, you should favour a major-suit lead. Don't worry that responder has a major. Worry instead ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that declarer will be well-stocked in the minors. |pg||
nt|bt: odds changes slightly when one of the opps hands are very strong like here|pg||
nt|bt: declarer will go to dummy, take a spade finesse and aouth will eventually be squeezed down to his underpants|pg||
nt|bt: south|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have just written a book 'Winning Notrump Leads', with Taf Anthias, where we analysed (by computer) opening leads after a variety of auctions ending in NT. That was one of our ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: findings.|pg||
nt|hlortz: just give w  fewer @H and one more @C say and the lead would be a great success|pg||
nt|brolucius: After an auction of 1NT - 3NT, it is nearly always right to lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even 10-x in a major is better than K-J-x-x in a minor.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fallenius is thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better to win?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table Grue led the @D4.|pg||
nt|bt: fallenius knows partner has nothing else, maybe @DJ|pg||
nt|bt: yea at the other table south was pressured on 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he ducks woolridge will eventually have the option of throwing him in with third heart|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely South knows from the bidding that West holds @HQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would not lead the ace from A-J-x-x|pg||
nt|bt: he must place partner with @DJ thats when there is a possibility to beat this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might but wont continue with jack|pg||
nt|runnerup: but ew seems to make 3nt also |pg||
nt|xenya: and club shift helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8  deWijs playing 2@S West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jonsson was endplayed at trick 2|pg||
nt|szalay: right card means = pull trumps and play finesses?:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: during the pause   i think it significant to note that  all 6 USA teams advanced to KO|pg||
nt|szalay: all we know for right penalty double needs 8 of @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in Bermuda Bowl  4 of 6 European Teams advance|pg||
nt|szalay: 4 from 7|pg||
nt|szalay: Holland is European, I was told|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh that's right  extra team for host country|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those with very short days this time of year   Iceland, Netherlands and Sweden all advanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Israel and Italy   --  i miscounted  5 of 7|pg||
nt|szalay: btw|pg||
nt|jbennet: Thet must have been aware of that they just missed a laydwon game. allowing opponents to play 4 cl making instead  of scoring +400 in 5d. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bertheau saying 4@d is shortness|pg||
nt|bobholl: opposite 16-18 in imps i bid it also indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: that helps :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: a smidgeon|pg||
nt|brgpro: this lead made life easier|pg||
nt|ady: overtrick  now likely|pg||
nt|brgpro: so they played @h game from the short side, made the @C ruff impossible to find|pg||
nt|ady: would also make on other possibility  ace A@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the azurri take the lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: east south Jan   making a joke|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ahhhh -- I did not understand that :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: he should make an uptrick on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|szalay: Israel is european, as well|pg||
nt|anton72: then over Fionas 3 @s .... or 3@d ...easy can pass|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: but sometimes you gain 12 when it goes off|pg||
nt|athene: those are good odds for just taking the money|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a nie RodStroth?|pg||
nt|psyck:  You can also find live scores in this link: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|ady: kib suggesting 3NT  very much a gamble|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Duboin promissed 6@H, 3@S and 15+ points|pg||
nt|ady: that unfortunate for Italy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ryskiel_: zaraz zaraz co tu siê dzieje?|pg||
nt|ady: seems K@H lead may beat it now  exceot north may later be squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not everyone will open on East which will make it tough to reach game - pass and double Norths 1nt response gets to hearts but maybe not game|pg||
nt|sybarra: one sec and will come back  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S made so Netherlands double partscore pickup on  8|pg||
nt|ady: doomed |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Angelini must be heavy favorite with feature pairs  Fantunes, Meckwell|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|oosmanb: nope @h straight away!|pg||
nt|gracelin: declareris of course worried about a 4-0 trump breaks.  But he will soon find out it's not the case.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but he might misplay because of the "pressure"|pg||
nt|gracelin: HA is the normal play now, but declarer may think deeper|pg||
nt|roswolf: really as long as he doesnt panic this is a cinch|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would set up his side suit - as per general principles|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi is not the man to panic.  He played the last 3 Bermuda Bowls and reached semifinal in 2009.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes which is why Bocchi's malaise is so evident|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Chinese team beat the defending Champion Norway in the QF.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|star6ija: there are some diffivulties|pg||
nt|lechcold: mo¿e byæ:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade to jack seems so normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24   Hurd-Wooldridge find @D fit -- but not @S      5@DX|pg||
nt|jbennet: The only explanation why east didnt pass 4 sp with weak trumps and only 1 ace.|pg||
nt|jbennet: must have been that he hoped for a miracle.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: well, nystrom thought that his unlimited partner made a slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: maybe only needing the club cue|pg||
nt|hantveit: NS, can just push dia every time|pg||
nt|hantveit: or change to clubs now, whatever you fancy|pg||
nt|rv: in my view tougher to qualify for QFs in trans-nationals than in BB|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: some might be wondering why it's so obvious for east to duck his @HA there at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Aronov in 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds taken quickly anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup: without @d lead-or switch  -which is difficult|pg||
nt|ady: should be another 5 to china|pg||
nt|brgpro: this board could easily be another push|pg||
pc|d4|nt|boedhy:  @s @c ducked and @d to the 10 for 6 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult hand - Q10xx Axx xx Axxx and game simply depends on @dA onside, assuming trumps 2-1|pg||
nt|bobholl: n has to find @C switch now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: rallying a bit|pg||
nt|roswolf: going off as well|pg||
nt|brgpro: when Muller is in tank, we can safely go and make a coffee...( tea in my case , i am from china!)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bt: that was strange|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: angelini playing with brogeland himself|pg||
nt|rv: Monaco suprisingly not doing well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks  Dennis  i couldn't remember Angelini's partner|pg||
nt|rv: Monaco with Zimmerman-Multon, Balicki-Zmud, Helgemo-Helness in 74th place with 121 VPs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: if you have the ace over KQ it's just standard to duck at top level|pg||
nt|athene: it hurts declarer's transportation|pg||
nt|athene: and also helps your own|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Upmark jest lekko wpuszczony|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: oni graj¹ w BA nie wychod w singla Wikingu|pg||

nt|panosk: double dummy ie spade lead 4@H dont make|pg||
nt|xenya: got to believe in his luck|pg||
nt|ady: still could just get the heart wrong|pg||
nt|hantveit: had to find it for -3, but would still be down with dia|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: now EW can cash two hearts any time west gets in|pg||
nt|athene: if east won the first trick he couldn't attack hearts any more|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer would have a sure trick and an entry|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no right prediction this time Ruud :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: maybe the result but not the line of play|pg||
nt|pbundy: i thought he did, too - but nystrom seemed a bit minimum to me.......particularly opposite diamond shortness|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nystrom did alert as cuebid, not specifically shortness|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: now give up a spade if finesse wrong |pg||
nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein never bid where karaivanov-trendafilo wore out their red cards|pg||
nt|oosmanb: good play, since he knew K@D was the only time he'd get to dummy if A@S is with West|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @S can wait @H could not|pg||
nt|oosmanb: still some work to do!|pg||

nt|oosmanb: 1NT will help them win auction in 2@H probably|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Souths pass over 1NT in OR is a matter of style, lots of points but no suit to attack|pg||

mb|1S!|nt|athene: some people play 4@D shows this sort of hand -very strong suit with support for partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok i am told 4@C asks for keycards|pg||
nt|athene: if so, north won't be taking so long :) just a matter of counting four steps|pg||

nt|athene: and north has the well-known problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N shut his eys and looks to the ceiling... thinking|pg||
nt|athene: he has some extras but his only available cue-bid goes past game|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: can't say, I assume so|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass or correct for N|pg||
nt|lml: the Canadians had a bit of a strange auction on the previous board to end in 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt and 4@h should not make|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wola³bym ¿eby nieporawdziwe by³o wistowanie w ostatnim rozdaniu|pg||
nt|lechcold: z rozdaniem 8 by³ jaki k³opot w PO|pg||
nt|yuval10: the KO stage is of course an entierly different thing, and the US teams, with all their experience, will surely have some edge|pg||
nt|lml: Israel has been doing very well ... tough fighters too|pg||
nt|oosmanb: dont know if 2@S makes for NS but its close |pg||
nt|garden2005: próba ¿¹d³a|pg||
nt|roswolf: west courageously sallies forth|pg||
nt|gracelin: I think West went to far by bidding 3D, showing D plus a major, at this Vul.|pg||
nt|gracelin: too|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sorry|pg||
nt|roswolf: aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could be opening bid with 3-fit that has no slam interest|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s is limited here, hence the jump to 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as well as what standard players hold for 1-4|pg||
nt|bobholl: he simply asks him :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: difficult hand to handle here.  As it turns out 6 of either major makes with both majors 3-3.|pg||
nt|barnets: lucky major suit division here both 3-3|pg||
nt|ady: very favourable lay for n/s|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 3 finneses in :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: will be a quick claim...even when the declarer is Bauke!|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ryskiel_: a w RP?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  doubleton @c helps but the good @d arent that much help|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes. The 5th trump is worth a couple of points, to compensate.|pg||
nt|brolucius: My comments are struggling to make it to the Netherlands, appearing after a time-delay of a few seconds. Perhaps someone is censoring them on the way.|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D now, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South already passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: practical bidding|pg||
nt|ady: maybe diamond lead   free finess for a club pitch|pg||
nt|roswolf: might have been an excitinf auction the original thiugh:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: neither 3NT nor 4H makes.|pg||
nt|anton72: yes Dhondy open 1 @c 2 + cards ..and both swedish afraid from clubs :)|pg||
nt|anton72: go in 1 NT or in 2 @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: still, he has such a nice hand, i think he SHOULD go past game|pg||
nt|ady: nast lead for north|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: complimenting Bjarni on his average dummy putting :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: mo¿e by³o otwarcie !NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Brink finding 4 @C bid "amusing" |pg||
nt|olegario: Hello all, Thank you leao! olegario from Belo Horizonte, Brazil|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will W bid spades? or diamonds?|pg||
nt|ady: east may have trouble keeping trump control to bring in the diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: north considering playing the king|pg||
nt|bt: we have the same contract here, east will lead @HA and west discourage, then diamond shift|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H usually forcing. If so, 3@H must mean a big two-suiter (or a splinter agreeing diamonds).|pg||
nt|barnets: Israel bid to 3N in open|pg||
nt|kit: I think Weinstein should just bid 4@S and end it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Weinstein thinking...|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 1NT shows 7-10 both majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some might call that a pre-gloat|pg||
nt|brgpro: once Boccki didnt overcall in @h, they will have another potential win on this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wijs will make simple noises to get more distribution info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=4+@S 4+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unbalanced|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|athene: right, so i can believe THIS is keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does 1@D imply unbalanced hand?|pg||
nt|lechcold: by³o|pg||
nt|kamyk: w tym rozdaniu Szwedzi lepiej policzyli punkty:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: B-N graj¹ 14-16|pg||
nt|lechcold: musieli zatem chyba graæ 2N co najmniej...|pg||
nt|lechcold: bez politycznych konotacji plis|pg||
nt|lechcold: :)|pg||
nt|lml: and we duplicate the auction in the OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: same bidding as in the OR here|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|lml: pretty clear to make 3 except if stansby gives a trick away on a diamond lead for an overtrick|pg||
nt|jbgood: the queen of spades was lead in the OR - and the slam made|pg||
nt|boedhy:  some sort of maximum now |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they found a 44 fit|pg||
nt|skaftij:  EW CC does not reveal their escape methods|pg||
nt|bt: its not only that Qx is bad, its a minus value|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very few pairs have ability to show @D at 2-level over 1N opener|pg||
nt|brgpro: S will pass|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i was wrong, it is 0-10 with 4-4 majors not 7-10|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: south is not going to make this|pg||
nt|star6ija: should be|pg||
nt|lechcold: a to nie sz³o|pg||
nt|leao:  they're way too high now|pg||
nt|sybarra: all of them! |pg||
nt|ahollan1: tarzan did NOT DBL 4@H on  9|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Iceland got to 4@h on bd 9, undoubled though|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Al you are too fast!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tarzan =  wijs-muller   sounds like name of movie's tarzan from 1930s/40s  Johnny Weissmuller|pg||
nt|szalay: who was Hungarian:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hungarian??   i know he was olympic swimmer  but didn't know heritage|pg||
nt|szalay: we know it:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@S is already a tad high|pg||
nt|brgpro: but if it is 0-6, he would pass 1@H|pg||
nt|ady: likely 9 tricks here|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|famus: U bet--but these guys are creating same feelings in every team they've encountered so far:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Lauria lays down @hs and @cs claiming 7 tricks|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: przecie¿ nie obowi¹zuje cisza wyborcza..|pg||
nt|kamyk: stary dylemat - kontrowac takie 4@C, czy nie; raz sie sobie pomo¿e, a raz im...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  4@c they wil have agreed on|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm cerrtain 3N will make on 9 in the other room|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point! Yes, he needs the @DK set up before the clubs give a discard. |pg||
nt|runnerup: minor games are down with ruffs in other minor -if you has ny way to find such games|pg||
nt|dburn:  the English defenders had better be less afraid of clubs|pg||
nt|anton72: @d switch?....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5+5+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: grali 1 BA - 3 BA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Exactly as Lars predicted.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, East should see that it is the main chance of beating the contract (if no trump trick is available). |pg||
nt|bt: every now and then i find a diamond in the rough, right?|pg||
nt|barnets: west passed in open  same bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: A sensible auction.|pg||
nt|kit: Somehow that West hand just doesn't look like notrump to me.|pg||
nt|hantveit: must play spade to duck, and later take spade and play dia... hard to hold it too 9|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|lechcold: 3 by³o szwole¿erskie:)|pg||
nt|leao:  hard to diagnos a double now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, on occasions partner would 'come again' over 4@S.|pg||
nt|roswolf: how many hcp does 2nt show 21-22?|pg||
nt|bobholl: kib's remark a good save against 5@H but i guess that's not making|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  so maximum with @s and maybe even cue|pg||
nt|boedhy:  aiiiiii....|pg||
nt|oosmanb: on same lead?|pg||
nt|antoniz: ciekawie siê zrobi³o|pg||
nt|kamyk: spójrzcie na 25. w otwartym - radosny bryd¿:)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|lml: of course hearts could have behaved better|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but Brink should go on I think|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Iceland missed it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed they did'|pg||
nt|bt: without diamond king west encourages|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: góral mo¿e przynieæ niedu¿y zysk, ale czy musi?|pg||
nt|xenya: not a contract to be in when you are late|pg||
nt|barnets: dec needed 1 major suit to break to make 3n so was fortunate|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: if south had opened a strong 2@C what would have happened I wonder|pg||
nt|antoniz: czyli 2NT graæ musieli,trudno|pg||
nt|pawel90:  raczej sami bÄdziemy wistowaÄ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: can he make it?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1 NT showed 14-16 so W could have a minor jack |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south in deep thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: back in hand now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South has 2 entries to dummy in @c so will play towards @sAJ since East is known to have @SKQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and back on the table they go|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but he does not know te @c layout yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards in hand|pg||
nt|kit: exactly -- 4@S can stand some bad splits.  3NT maybe not.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: weinstein : i am not claiming but i will show you my hand loool|pg||
nt|gracelin: 20-21, with 22-23 they open 2D and rebid 2NT.  with 23+, 2C then 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D =(65)11|pg||
nt|brgpro: W has to settle for 3NT now...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one more ask shows specific shape|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|wild card: this contract will purely depend on a heart decision|pg||
nt|antoniz: idzie 6kier,to dobrze|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4 pasy zostaly na razie wpisane, bo w rozdaniu bylo tylko 48 kart|pg||
nt|jbgood: but in @cs always 2 club losers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: only a @C lead lets it make..|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 17 imps for Sweden|pg||
nt|garden2005: kiwki i wolnoamerykanka ... czy tak powinnimy wygrywaæ?|pg||
nt|szalay: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Weissmuller|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hiding @D2  so that @D8 is hard to read   [upside-down attitude]|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and the israeli boys in one voice: you make everything lool |pg||
nt|roswolf: ty patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D opening can also be a weak two in either major|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer doesn't know the bad trump split yet.  He's working on how to make on 3-2 break|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont think this is ever makeable i fancy -2|pg||
nt|gracelin: The other room is commentated by Italian. They must not like what's going on.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thanks  quick scan of notes made me think 1@C or 1N with all balanced hands up to 19 HCP|pg||
nt|ady: set up the long diamon   got 4 diamonds  2 hearts and 1 spade|pg||
nt|lechcold: dwie nadróbki...dobrze ¿e m³odzie amerykañska nie popêdzi³a do szlemika kierowego|pg||
nt|ady: heart now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  A @d to dummy may risk 2@h 1S and 2@d for the defense. Declarer does not like it until he sees @c situation|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but he will play a @c to dummy|pg||
nt|brgpro: maybe 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think he'll run trump|pg||
nt|brgpro: small chance when @dQjx falls 3rd|pg||
mb|3S!|an|5611|nt|skaftij:  after escape method , he will infer that  @C are 4-2, west showed 4+@C-4+@H|pg||
nt|brgpro: then he can make the rest|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@S  =  5611|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lauria playing 3@H|pg||
nt|brgpro: there are 9 tricks in 3NT ( w/o @s lead)|pg||
nt|brgpro: @s lead against 3NT will make this hand very complicated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H should include at least 2 controls  A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3NT will get @c10 lead for sure...with @d 3-3. easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H made 5|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|lml: I like a spade play now ... @SQ or jack|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4@c maybe after 2@c opening|pg||
nt|ady: running the 9 guaranteed 7 tricks  and in the event did not cost|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: claim and toilet break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as expected Aronov going down 2 in 4@S on  8|pg||
nt|ady: usa got 6 imps on hand 8 where Bulgaria were to high in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 6 boards   in Bermuda Bowl  Guadalupe leads Iceland by 19 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and we are back|pg||
nt|wild card: and I think it best to play the jack|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer's main line is to ruff a club and discard one on the good spade. but he also worry about D ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the ether will certainly be full of hot air tinged with woe no doubt - but they are allowed a bad set sometime:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you had a choice of 3@S or 4@C to splinter, 3@S looks better, as partner has more room over it|pg||
nt|lml: good play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tough for W now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|wild card: but if he plays the jack, the contract will fail, as we see|pg||
nt|wild card: N did show two aces though|pg||
nt|wild card: and if he had had a singleton hearts, he might have had a bid over 1@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo it is a pure guess.|pg||
nt|wild card: looking only at the heart position, I guess it's better to play the jack|pg||
nt|wild card: wins if south has AQx in trumps|pg||
nt|meargent: trump usually best lead on this sort of auction but easts duck suprising|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|athene: but anyway, they got there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its a very good one and nothing much to the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so well done NL another derserved big plus|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play so 13 imps to the netherlands...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: very well bid by NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: really "communicating" |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Iceland have been pushed down to 6th and this won't help|pg||
nt|skaftij:  clubs is only chance - he knows D finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards stil placed on the table and thinking...|pg||
nt|garden2005: zazwyczaj taki styl reprezntuj¹ pary, ktore maja kompleks ni¿szoci i próbuj¹ w pokerka zagraæ|pg||
nt|bobholl: one more match in 15 minutes :) have fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|leao:  Campos will try to get tricks anyway he can now :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  although if he tries to ruff a @c ... but the @c queen should bother him|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Iceland has a tough "program" for the day|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: has to play Israel in the last match this afternoon|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only needs 1 @C ruff so playing trumps safe|pg||
nt|runnerup: this was down -not any more?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the time is almost up and 6 more boards to play|pg||
nt|nkgupt: same contract from S OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  should trust Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e tylko 200?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: GIB podobno nawet wygrywa|pg||
nt|roswolf: they are only mortals not gods!|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure. like 2007 against S. Africa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry that was supposed to be private  and different hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D forced 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: S had a difficult decision to make, and he banked on 5 hearts with N -- N could have just 4, Al?|pg||
nt|ady: same 11 tricks    a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "end signal"|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: on any lead i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the director in the room|pg||
nt|xenya: so they will be penalised, which is good news for Japan, who are trailing NZ by 1VP|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: mr Slavek Latala|pg||
nt|dburn:  but this is setting up winners for declarer|pg||
nt|brgpro: Bocchi is surprised they ended up in a suit he wanted to overcall against str. @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wijs  PASS or makes signoff|pg||
nt|brgpro: can he handle the 6-0 break?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at all hands YES    playing single dummy at the table -- not as easy|pg||
nt|rv: tough to handle 6-0 break, if he finesses this may have a chance|pg||
nt|brgpro: if he finesses, he shd make for sure but i doubt he would do so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: first question for us --- is there a downside to finesse @D?|pg||
nt|brgpro: so after @d A, unblock @cA then a @h...looks normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink in 3@CX South|pg||
nt|rv: will be costly for Dutch|pg||
nt|rv: 3@c double is terrible contract for declarer|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has 5 side tricks, so need 5 trumps...can he handle that?|pg||
nt|brgpro: his @h86 looks nice though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  it is Drijver playing in North   but still ugly contract|pg||
nt|rv: he starts of @DA, ruff, @CA, @SA, @ck, @CQ, @s/@c ruff, may have a chance|pg||
nt|brgpro: think if he goes up the @dA, he might need to ruff a @d first|pg||
nt|brgpro: then @cA and a @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Madala's choice of @D10  muddies the waters|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the french women were also in 3@cX, -1400!|pg||
nt|rv: that line could work, all-in-all if he can makes could lose a bushel of IMPs|pg||
nt|brgpro: unlikely to finesse now, so he will go up the A ...and need to ruff one first i believe!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|runnerup: he ruffed too high -so back to minus|pg||
nt|dburn:  not enough of them, fortunately, but...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only six|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: actually lall returned @d10 earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ostensibly 10 shows Jack   so expet shortness|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: probably down 2|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has 7 top tricks and probably has to come to a black suit trick|pg||
nt|lml: a balck suit queen|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no entries to the dummy|pg||
nt|wild card: well done robert stephens|pg||
nt|lml: nice try to set up a heart by no luck|pg||
nt|gracelin: Even God may not be able to save Madala on this 4H :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the italian lead is only 9 and bds 23-25 have not been scored yet|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: Martel might rise on the club to lead a diamond through|pg||
nt|lml: makes it easier on partner|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: every team desperate to make the top 8 as we near the end of the RR|pg||
nt|roswolf: the AZZURRI tell me to try and spell :(|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphznv: the 1@h interference by W in the other room made it more difficult|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, Manchester City were quite happy with six yesterday |pg||
nt|anton72: i am happy for citizens too :))|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the United fans weren't..... |pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: last hand  if the cards shown on the screen were correct then 10 tricks were there   north has discarded too many diamonds|pg||
nt|leao:  good news, the king is on side, but bad news is it's Kxxx|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Secured 1 down|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bt: decl needs @CK onside then east doesnt have @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: They lost another 7 on board 7|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sorry board 22|pg||
nt|gracelin: thjis culd be a huge set for China, but don't forget there are still 32 boards to go.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 38-3 to china this set after bd22 - with more imps to come|pg||
nt|roswolf: this set reminds me of the leaning tower of pisa|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lml: dont you like good partners like that|pg||
nt|bt: it wasnt magic, lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he is guesseing the spades because of lack of entries|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: better for north now to draw last trump  |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it seems|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: really Jan?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it seems so|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Iceland still more then a match away from 9th place so no real problems yet|pg||
nt|davidstern: The eight card suit scrambled my video and I had to reopen BBO :(|pg||
nt|rv: great displined pass by Bocchi here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|szalay: as we thought: he made it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: But I am sure the bet station still give higher odds for Italy to win.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I woud have led S10 instead of a club.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but italy will be grateful there are at least 2 full sets after this one|pg||
nt|brgpro: now declarer has some entry problems, likely to make 9 only|pg||
nt|brgpro: well...now..dont think he can handle it any more...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make this   lose 13   down = lose 17|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|szalay: sry|pg||
nt|szalay: 1 off|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|antoniz: tylko -3|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but i cannot always see it, because he holds his hand on the cards|pg||
nt|ady: terrible for defenders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously  doesn't matter if down 1, 2 or 3  in this part of the Imp Scale|pg||
pc|s7|nt|leao:  clb now|pg||
nt|leao:  nice going, making drijver ruff pards trick|pg||
nt|rv: Italians have raised their game when it mattered most, true sign of great players|pg||
nt|rv: this segment could prove decisive in final analyses|pg||
nt|rv: very little to separate these 2 fine teams till yesterday, first time either team has opened up a sizeable lead, it is upto Dutch to dig deep and fight-back|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: now can ruff the 3rd diamond|pg||
nt|skaftij:  cannot go wrong now, 5 imps to Israel|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: soon a claim coming|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so 3@h -1 |pg||
pc|c5|nt|leao:  and then endplaying him if he doesnt ruff|pg||
nt|skaftij:  levelling the score|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: big swing for canada here since they played spades the opposite way!|pg||

nt|jbgood: 6 boards to go here|pg||
nt|garden2005: ale witne zagranie zaliczy³ :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17  EXCEPT  1st seat favoralbe|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: if you had the 10 you would cash the honour from hand first as you can pick up Jxxx in either hand|pg||
nt|athene: japan might get their first imp there, if East in the other room leads his ace against six|pg||
nt|athene: (i am sure bocchi madala will reach six)|pg||
nt|lml: well Baxter's choice of 2@S turned out to be a good choice although perhaps south would still have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: so Canada has the lead again|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3BA to Splinter karowy jak s¹dzê|pg||
nt|antoniz: splinter karowy|pg||
nt|leao:  \i expect board 24 will show a tidy profit for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can beat 4 @H  but have to take their tricks  |pg||
nt|bt: now some people can bid 2@S strong on that hand, wouldnt that be nice?|pg||
nt|brolucius: In NT it is a 5-or-7 hand, depending on whether the clubs come in. 7@S much better, because you can establish the clubs against a 4-1 break.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like a very biddable grand slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H now would suggest diamond support, because he is a passed hand.|pg||
nt|bt: west can splinter in diamonds, east blackwood and 5NT maybe?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7@S needs almost nothing|pg||
nt|hlortz: ew had a rather hasty auction in OR   seems like there might be some bids between 2n and 6n imo |pg||
nt|bt: credit to the 2@H opening at the other table|pg||
nt|garden2005: przepraszam za gubienie literek, obiecujê poprawê|pg||
nt|dburn:  unclear, this - East-West at the other table got to 4@h, which they might or might not have been going to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is the most brutal part about being vugraph operator -- players who don't let you see cards played|pg||
nt|pbundy: this seems like a boring one - but - with these 4 you never know!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H game force|pg||
nt|jbennet: Interesting hand if north had bid 3NT. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they have a discussion if Sjoert has 7 or 6 @D since they have a 2@D opening as weak with @D|pg||
nt|meargent: personally i prefer 1@H with a 7 loser|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, (3)4+@D, unbal, 3@D if (41)35, maybe 2245|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if they can take the club finesse and make 11 in 3nt|pg||
nt|stoffers: A lot of dull boards this set|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north will be shaking but impossible to find 2Hx|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  slight over statement    but 2NT could be much weaker in balancing seat  and very good stops in hearts   just have to play partner with enough  to make game   7 or 8 points ...|pg||

nt|xenya: 1@DX -1 might not be such a bad result for Israel |pg||
nt|oosmanb: wow nice hand|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Very nice. Easy when you see all hands, the players need to do this again and againn for days and tiredness creeps in|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West said : only this partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D pre-emptive, of course, since he can cue-bid with a good raise.|pg||
nt|hlortz: that was a factor certainly|pg||
nt|bt: i think 4@D makes it a lot easier here|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps the lack of time made swedish do that little slip in defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nystrom seems very fast...|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H a good 2@S raise I believe.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2h=9-11 3 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin just wrote it down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S would promise 6+|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: well, i have to guess sometimes. is an interesting game :)|pg||
nt|kit: where does the bidding stop?|pg||
nt|kit: Problem now is Levin doesn't know who's hand it is.  He would opposite a 2@H opener.|pg||
nt|meargent: for EW it better stop here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=<FG or wrong for relay, 4+@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: I am not sure about that last result ... looked like 2 down not 1 down|pg||
nt|star6ija: I do not expect they to go further than 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to penalize this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but DBL would work very well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  well the gain is only 50|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphznv: i asked them and the claim was for 1 down, 1 also though like 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I asked them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=ART FG  a) @C  b) 4@H  c) long @S|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: impodajny to ten mecz nie jest|pg||
nt|yuval10: me too Linda, those are very strong 2 teams|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: as I said earlier -- they were being beaten heavily in the test match |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Running scores > http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that is usually the case. 4@D does not show more than 4@S. It shows one of the reasons WHY you are worth 4@S. |pg||
nt|bt: if north bids 5@D it would have been tough|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bertheau for sure slower than nystrom|pg||
nt|kit: 2NT probably some weak competitive hand, while a 3-level call would be constructive.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder if he could have doubled to show hearts.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Seems clear to show them now.|pg||
nt|kit: maybe double shows only 4 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South in the tank now|pg||
nt|dburn:  but my vote would be for "not", since I can't see a tenth winner for them|pg||
nt|jbennet: BBO lead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C can be 5/4 either way|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: he actually has 2 of the 3 options covered|pg||
nt|stoffers: We want action and blood :)|pg||
nt|wild card: not the first time we see a transfer on one level today|pg||
nt|ady: this might be 1 too high|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now it becomes interesting|pg||
nt|ady: only 9 obvious tricks including K@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: E may bid again and he did |pg||
nt|skaftij:  risk is losing double digit imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  dummy has 3@C  looked like 2 before|pg||
nt|ady: 1 too high|pg||
nt|ady: in hearts I meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: can e/w cash their tricks here|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|udo: i played against Lauria-Versace 3 or 4 times,,,when they are on a run,, u feel pressure every second|pg||
nt|athene: slam is not so bad here, if played by north to protect the @CK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D asks|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2 and a half :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: brawo Krzysztofy,piêknie i skutecznie|pg||
nt|lechcold: co siê musi udaæ, w koñcu to Mistrzostwa Swiata:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like making 10 with @S start|pg||
nt|ady: I believe the 2 heart opening shows 5 hearts and 4 spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can do it - spade and South must play 10 then 2nd spade (9) and can establish spade trick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or can end play North|pg||
nt|ady: I think J@S  may be right|pg||
nt|ady: J@S    if south covers with the queen   then king    come back to east and low spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sorry, problem with loading the board again|pg||
nt|rv: re all, sry lost conn, welcome back|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: after the lead declarer claims making 5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@d makeable as the hand is|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so no play here :)|pg||
nt|kit: I can't imagine what South could do but bid 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: china need to keep their foot on the italians throat - score the imps now and dont delay|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: but south has the diamonds so it would have to be 6nt (or 6@S, but that is not likely)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=4@H    totally new concept|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3@H = 5@S-4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm very much impressed with how the Israeli team are playing here, and we must not forget it's a rather young one, most of them age nearly 40|pg||
nt|lml: there is no reason for south to pull with JX of diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: a slightly different auction gave more room for NS than in the OR - and may land in thispartial|pg||
nt|panosk: looks like a gd contract |pg||
nt|panosk: lead will provide 9th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  I can imagine why. They play solid easy bridge as we can see from these boards|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so normally the better team wins then....And I think the Netherlands are a bit better ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: very solid indeed|pg||
nt|szalay: boring 1 off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: early World Championships were scored Total Points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so here  NS would be net +50 after 100 honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honors died when Imps came into use|pg||
nt|kit: But now I know.|pg||
nt|brolucius: How can they miss a 5-4 fit in the 'other major'?|pg||
nt|barnets: 2n clearly misunderstood|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt was competitive at the 3 level|pg||
nt|kit: This is a major mixup.  South apparently thought 3@S asked for a spade stopper.  North thought 2NT then 3NT showed notrump.|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, North bid 5@d just in case either it made or 4@h would have done|pg||
nt|jbennet: banging down an ace. |pg||
pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: all reasonable plays produce a 10th trck|pg||
nt|bt: 5nt then 7@S looks easy now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now after all the key cards are known 5NT will invite a grand and West will accept with those clubs.|pg||
nt|gracelin: they tried here, but with trumps 4-1, probably dwn.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H seems pre-destined for team orange here|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|famus: 6NT wud be great|pg||
nt|athene: north may now offer 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: but it's tricky|pg||
nt|athene: good hand but no aces|pg||
nt|lechcold: karach:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: well - looks as if 2@h was gf...|pg||
nt|leao:  rite, if they dont take their 4 tricks kickly they wont take them at all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if it meant 'two places to play', it seems it was misjudged with 5 cards in the other major.|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch not a good time to save|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this might make, if North just cashes @sAK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D is non-serious slam try|pg||
nt|jbennet: not entirely cast-iron.|pg||
nt|pbundy: as we saw just a few boards ago, getting to the five level would make it far less boring|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3NT over 3@s would be natural grue says|pg||
nt|pbundy: w/d by n/s not to get too high|pg||
pc|dK|nt|udo: nice bid by South,,now North shoudl accept,,, he has a clear max|pg||
nt|wild card: interesting question is, what would redouble instead of 1@s mean|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I believe 1@s did show a 3crd|pg||
nt|wild card: and does dbl on 1@h show a takeout hand (like this), or something in hearts|pg||
nt|lechcold: bardzo ostro|pg||
nt|pawel90:  trzeba karo trafiÄ|pg||
nt|antoniz: trafi karko i super|pg||
nt|leao:  not a chance now|pg||
nt|desinka:  looks like flat board to me|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|desinka:  EW play kind of polish club|pg||
nt|barnets: south should have x 2@H or bid 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Shi thinks the same I think, talking chinese I think, don't understand anything|pg||
nt|brgpro: but will lose an imp here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you think West auction too revealling  so non-@S lead?|pg||
nt|brgpro: trump lead...A and H...then take first @c and play a @d...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lechcold: podzia³ kar i trafienie palcówki potrzebne|pg||
nt|xenya: hmm|pg||
nt|lml: Matel has to pick a major with 3-3|pg||
nt|desinka:  depends from the vuln|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i always wonder what it would be like to revive them in a duplicate setting|pg||
nt|barnets: that is clear|pg||
nt|ady: A@C lead did not cost  but continuation did|pg||
nt|ady: but contract always there|pg||
nt|brgpro: even 4 is in danger...|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, since @c9 falls 3rd...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|skaftij:  Is it Ilan or Ophir who is South?|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, he has just shown the @CK. I was not expecting that.|pg||
nt|bt: now if east thinks and does bid 6@S ...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5NT not only asks for kings, also for a trick source which woolridge has|pg||
nt|brolucius: Makes no sense if West bids 7@S now. Why not on the previous round?|pg||
nt|bt: i thenk the us2 coach should do some work here|pg||
nt|garden2005: bêd¹ p¹czki|pg||
nt|xenya: this will also take some time -- before it goes down|pg||
nt|kit: A lead with a plan -- ace of clubs, club to king, club ruff.  Unfortunately, partner has neither king of clubs nor a third club.|pg||
nt|brgpro: and the 4th @C is with the long trump...so no danger at all...|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|athene: well, this might make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now the lead // who would lead a @c|pg||
nt|athene: lauria did not double 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: but the italians don't double these bids very often|pg||
nt|athene: so versace might still lead a club|pg||
nt|famus: i bet a @c lead|pg||
nt|udo: @C looks like he natural lead........maybe a @D|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's close between club and spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is not "that great"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ilan is south|pg||
nt|bt: if east thought and then bid 6@S they are toast|pg||
nt|ady: now losing 300    4 imps  instead of gaining aroound 5   still easier to decide from here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and might very well do just that, as there are no entries to dummy for the spade finesse |pg||
nt|mdgraham: now if the diamonds had been 2-2....|pg||
nt|dburn:  this isn't the clearest opening lead in the world, either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  then 4@D just a cue    thanks Dennis|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|udo: 13 now|pg||
nt|panosk: see how long he thinks to make sure of finding the correct plan even in a seemingly straightforward contract?|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 24 the chinese stayed low in 4@H AND just made it|pg||
nt|roswolf: the chinese have scored 62 unanswered imps in 6 bds|pg||
nt|dburn:  so there is some chance declarer may lose only one club|pg||
nt|jbennet: only overtricks at stake.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|famus: might lose an imp or two here--coz the Ita wud b in 6NT if at all|pg||
nt|ady: this will likely make in spite of bad split|pg||
nt|yuval10: that won't be a big success for USA1|pg||
nt|lml: so this is how you can end in a 3-3 fit friends even when you are great players|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Against aggresive teams as India for instance yesterday you can loose because of some slem boards who happen to make|pg||
nt|runnerup: one down next -save time |pg||
nt|roswolf: however you can never write off the azurri|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: ok now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all over - now 11 but he wont want to get greedy again|pg||
nt|yuval10: with the natural @h lead the contract seem like drifting at least 3|pg||
nt|xenya: W didn't know E had the @D10 when he ran|pg||
nt|lml: I like a trump lead and so does South!|pg||
nt|lml: it was a reasonable action by Stansby but it worked out badly|pg||
nt|hlortz: and 6@s must be in temo or 7S ot allowed|pg||
nt|hlortz: /tempo/|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, they got there but no 'points for style'.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here i dont think tempo matters since 5NT confirmed all the key cards|pg||
nt|anton72: they can give entry :) in clubs ...last one :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|leao:  300|pg||
nt|ady: can cash the diamond now or have it later     east will finesse 10@D for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: yes    may be 500   depemding on how it goes |pg||
nt|roswolf: these hands are so dipirting yo play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24   5@DX was down 1|pg||
nt|davidstern: Just done some small maths on X opposite AKT8652 and marginally better to play AK but very little in it|pg||

pc|h6|nt|szalay: as 1 kib said: good save vs. 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn:  something like that|pg||
nt|jbennet: much more intersting if north had bid 3nt and got a spade lead.|pg||
nt|nkgupt: other tbl preempted 4@d|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nkgupt: and did not get a @cA lead|pg||

pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: wow   @HK put declarer in danger of going down|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for scores etc|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: can cash @SAK and play three rounds of trumps now to force east to give a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't help|pg||
nt|athene: you can throw the club loser from dummy and ruff in hand but then dummy has only one trump to deal with two club losers|pg||
nt|athene: so one down|pg||
nt|athene: west didn't want to shift to the @CQ because declarer could have stiff king (four clubs with east for the double)|pg||
nt|athene: sorry five|pg||
nt|jbgood: if clubs dont break he has 9 if the diamond finesse is on - nothing works|pg||
nt|boedhy:  two off....|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|skaftij:  Thx Christer|pg||
nt|kit: The normal and cold 4@H reached in the other room, so big pickup for USA1|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: We wroc³awiu poci¹g jest ko³o po³udnia...zaraz sprawdzê dok³¹dniej|pg||
nt|brolucius: West is adding possible ruffing tricks in diamonds too, so he surely had a 7@S bid on the previous round.|pg||
nt|ady: can get to the spade discard and ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not as much as technical card players, but practical card players|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphznv: another squeeze coming up|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: so far north south is doing this perfectly|pg||
nt|barnets: in open south bid a normal 3@H over 2@S|pg||
nt|barnets: and reached the sane contract|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|runnerup: cant he claim|pg||
nt|kit: I think South should have bid 4@H whatever he thought 3@S was.  Presumably North wouldn't have made a takeout double without at least 3 hearts unless prepared to bid NT or a long ...|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes but you cant let these guys build up a big lead -they are great front runners|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 1S bid solved West's rebid problem.  The Chinese don't raise on 3|pg||
nt|brgpro: S has an interestig rebid after X from N now|pg||
nt|kit: if you don't overcall 1@S on Levin's hand, you will never overcall with a 4-card major.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: low heart lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 NT the safest game|pg||

nt|ady: minors behave for 6@C    but likely to finish in 3NT|pg||
nt|bt: i dont know if there was a break anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Break or not, it is illogical to realise that 7 is there when partner signs off but not before.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no there was not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink 2@H more constructive than 2@D["multi"]|pg||

nt|barnets: same bidding in open passed out|pg||
nt|imp_jan: f = 128|pg||
nt|brolucius: West sees no advantage in a splinter 4@H on such a weak hand. It would give North an extra option.|pg||
nt|nkgupt: upto 9 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|jbennet: but the key to get it right of course to duck the first d, getiing a siganl from p on the 2nd |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not on actual hand     in general  the 1-under overcall is move effective than 1-over because of preemption|pg||
nt|brgpro: can NS make 4@s here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: west didnt bother with stayman with a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||

nt|desinka:  yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: an old chess maneouvre, you repeat the position to gain thinking time|pg||

nt|fabsayc: here i think 6@C was in that category|pg||
nt|hlortz: so while illogical i guess its legal if no UI|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Tough balancing|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: important board|pg||
nt|xenya: why should EW get to 3N i can't imagine -- but may be diplicated here|pg||
nt|barnets: north passed 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: in open final contract|pg||
nt|kit: Levin's 4-card overcall struck gold -- or will it be mud after the hand is over?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=17-19|pg||
nt|meargent: 4@Hs a bit unluckey|pg||
nt|brgpro: but W might save over 4@s and that is.....800 perhaps|pg||
nt|tez: other table playing 4@c dbl from east|pg||
nt|rv: 4-0 @s break makes it complicated|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wild card: would you bid 2@s or 2@h now?|pg||
nt|wild card: we can see 2@h is a much better contract|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: what would you lead|pg||
nt|xenya: not now perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: all bids are alerted of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only 2-suiter NS can show is @H & @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: He had classic hand for a 4-card overcall: good values, good 4-card suit, and length in opener's suit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: north might bid 2NT to sow a good raise.  but he is stronger than that.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@CX in  other room|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphznv: he looks more relaxed now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i got it wrong 1st time  --  actually  2@D stronger than 2@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  true|pg||
nt|kit: Levin working on the clubs, so will have some tricks if opponents draw trumps.|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@H is ind overruling partner here. he has a good hand after 3@C but now they doubled 3@D and partner did not make another try with pass I think he should accept partners decision|pg||
nt|kit: The double of 3@D will save declarer from going down 2.  Without that, he would surely take the diamond finesse on a diamond shift.|pg||
nt|tomi2: his partner can count his spades on his own|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: some play re-double in east seat compels 2@C  which east would pass with what he had  or if a higher suit would then bid his suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have 3 ranges for 1N   at fav  1/2=9-12  3/4=11-14  otherwise 15-17|pg||
nt|odysseus69: interesting bidding in OR- having bid 2H over the double South revalued and bid 4H after 3D|pg||
nt|jbgood: fine contract for a push - he will not risk the club finesse - and three club tricks the reward|pg||
nt|ady: this could bring in some imps for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|brgpro: Lauria|pg||
nt|nkgupt: N did open a nat 1@d? :)|pg||
nt|ady: south should be able to signal which switch|pg||
nt|jbennet: if 4h was making then any contract of their own likely to be expensive.|pg||
nt|brgpro: but Duboin is more than happy to pass the X...looking at his @c holding|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|desinka:  still early to say that :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Teraqz @D W|pg||
nt|garden2005: nie wró¿ Janusz dramatów :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: jednak bedzie -2,ma³y zysk|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Jak ruszy³ @C@C to moze byc bez dwóch...|pg||
nt|brolucius: It can scarcely be an out-and-out penalty double since most of his hand (the heart honors) could be ruffed away.|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  down 1|pg||
nt|ady: likely down 2|pg||
nt|ady: but still a good board for China|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a steal|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pbundy: nystrom knows they need some swings|pg||
nt|ady: north I mean|pg||
nt|ady: not too difficult |pg||
nt|kit: true, but East knows no spade wastage.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bt: race for 8th spot is now: T5 US1/Iceland 307.5 7. NZ 302 8. Australia 301 9. Sweden 298 10 China 297.5 11. Japan 295|pg||
nt|pbundy: he is aware they have some unfortunate results|pg||
nt|kit: Zagorin decided more likely that South doubled without king of diamonds than that diamonds 7-1 and club hook on.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|udo: still,,,9 tricks ,,hmm,,,,may need some endplay|pg||
nt|athene: will he try finessing the @S9 for a dummy entry?|pg||
nt|ady: needs to get club right|pg||
nt|ady: bad situation in either minor might have meant slam going down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that treatment sure worked well here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|brgpro: he can finesse @d...so 5 side winners then ruff a @h in hand...makes 6...can he find 4 more ?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|udo: i see only 7 tricks actually|pg||
nt|famus: that 1 imp is becoming more illusive with each passing board--sounds like poetry!!:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: I could understand a direct 4@H after 3@C of course but when he bid 3@D he gained ne and usefull information about this deal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Pass/DBL Inversion might be yet-another Eric Rodwell creation|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: it appears west is trying to sign off but east is persisting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm referring to 1N   not the 2@H accept of transfer|pg||
nt|nkgupt: dont think wud make even on @h continuation|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: North doesn't know 4-card overcall, so he may think it necessary to tap dummy again.|pg||
nt|pbundy: so was i :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: -800 is not that terrible...they are cold for 620 and they might be pushed to 5 level...who knows|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: @SK there was safe, wasn't it? i guess not if east had @SQ109xx, but is that really possible?|pg||
nt|jbennet: as it happened also trump continuation had been enough.|pg||
nt|ady: take the 2 diamonds    then can sit back|pg||
nt|ady: no   4th spade would be a problem|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: tht this was glong to be played in clubs    but this will also come home|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: down now - right|pg||
nt|kit: But North got it right -- holding declarer to 3 ruffs in dummy.|pg||
nt|barnets: same def so far in open|pg||
nt|barnets: exactly|pg||
nt|kit: Oh, Soouth overtook to play a spade.  Good play.  South knew the story.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this time he's getting protection from his teammates|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ehsana: hello all :)|pg||
nt|ady: spade ruff   will beat this |pg||
nt|desinka:  lucky - 6@C/6@D are almost the same in this positions of the cards|pg||
nt|ady: not down in clubs    6NT would have made as well|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I would like 6@c a lot more|pg||
nt|desinka:  for sure|pg||
nt|bt: i think we have sweden-nz in the last round also|pg||
nt|brolucius: I usually find that it is a close decision between looking out of the window and watching a 1NT contract (but some say that this is an eccentric view).|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect single dummy 4@s may go down unless it is doubled|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would think the chance is not that slim...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: not guaranteed    west only bid once  and did not rebid diamonds|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: so probably 4|pg||
nt|lml: and likely a push or an imp in it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wests 3D bid has received criticism from spectators- rightly so- his hand is poor defensively so shouldnt give oppo 2nd chance|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a spade to the @s J|pg||
nt|athene: lauria decides to give up on the heart finesse since it might be wrong anyway and even if right, very hard to get to take it twice|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EA--can u tell us who was their coach--i forget the name??|pg||
nt|athene: even if the @S10 is onside|pg||
nt|ehsana: Kokish's  reps in Karachi|pg||
nt|famus: ah ok--ther are people looking here for those reps:))haha--joking|pg||
nt|athene: if the hearts are breaking, then it is advantageous to cash them|pg||
nt|star6ija: how he will go probably wrong|pg||
nt|ady: can make   ruff high and draw   and play on either red suit  |pg||
nt|star6ija: I think chances are greater for ruffing with the 8 here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fingers on the ten...not on the table|pg||
nt|ady: have to guess|pg||
nt|lml: Martel is getting his long suit going right away|pg||
nt|panosk: if spade finess doesnt work ruff another heart in dummy|pg||
nt|desinka:  sorry|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Przeka¿cie Witoldowi pozdrowienia. I dajcie moj adres. Rysio ma!|pg||
nt|brgpro: so u invest 5 imps and possible gain of 12, which may happen|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|athene: to take some exit cards away from the defence and make them discard|pg||
pc|s3|nt|desinka:  stupid comment|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|famus: with two entries it wud've fetched him more to return @hs--but Lauria does it for him|pg||
nt|ehsana: hink Lauria is giving all up|pg||
nt|athene: but if they aren't breaking, cashing them just sets up a trick or tricks for a defender|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finesse @ss now|pg||
nt|udo: @S to 9 and still interesting|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: guessed right    though perhaps a little luck;y|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes, but ... if W has 4 trumps with 9 promotion is already done|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lechcold: kolejne bardzo ciekawe rozdanie|pg||
nt|antoniz: para gra w sytuacjach wahliwych do przodu,nie przekraczaj¹c granic zdrowego rozs¹dku i to mnie siê podoba|pg||

pc|h5|nt|desinka:  forgot W is the declarer|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|famus: @H back|pg||
nt|skaftij:  CC says 2M weaker, Seems Brink has a 2@d bid|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1:  10  Muller 1NEast  [that's hand where 2@H-1]|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Most pairs play it the other way around I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why i got it wrong :)|pg||
nt|kit: However, with South having only 3 hearts and king of diamonds, it looks like declarer can make.|pg||
nt|kit: true, but I would bid game on his hand if my queen of diamonds were a small diamond after a 3@C game try and holding 4 small spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: on  11  Levin east overcalled artificial 1@C with 1@S|pg||
nt|ady: playing on hearts for 9th trick|pg||
nt|jbennet: see if south is aware|pg||
nt|pbundy: now nystrom's spades are taking care of lall's trumps.......|pg||
nt|tez: promotion @h 9|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|famus: so 7 it is|pg||
nt|athene: easy for masood now; he knows his pd has the @DA entry to hearts|pg||
nt|udo: soith ahs a @D exit now, for north to cash the @H s|pg||
nt|udo: south|pg||
nt|ehsana: loks 4 away|pg||
nt|udo: 2 down,,whatever he does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will be hard to duplicate Martel's 4@S making|pg||
pc|s8|nt|famus: -2|pg||
nt|brgpro: -3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|desinka:  because of the 2@D relay|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: EW both known for ability to make creative bids at the table|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: lauria just hoping south has the @DA of course|pg||
nt|famus: :)|pg||
nt|ady: dont split|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: but diamonds coming in now|pg||
nt|star6ija: well played|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sorry + 2 will correct|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  was thinking they were playing 4 hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no 10 tricks 2+2.. will correct mom.|pg||
nt|yuval10: now S will clear the @h's for just made|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: south might try a spade with the idea of promoting the @HJ in the north hand|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|ady: sorry Jan   another request for results link|pg||
nt|brolucius: No guess in diamonds, since North has the top hearts.|pg||
nt|kit: this is not a good time to try an end-play :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: his fingers on the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: made in open|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent table-side info from Traian.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a lot of imps at stake here|pg||
nt|barnets: dec thinking of going wrong as a result of norths x|pg||
nt|barnets: which suggested more def|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: north turmned the card very quickly|pg||
nt|barnets: we see north has @H A10 left|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jbennet: no lall could have ruffed with the ACE|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: ecept no entry|pg||
nt|jbennet: and returned a club.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|udo: his only chance,,|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: that would mean north doesn't get the hearts AND south gets endplayed|pg||
nt|lml: it took me too long to type that|pg||
nt|kit: if North down to stiff ace of hearts and Kx of diamonds, North could have unblocked ace -- and should.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: hello there|pg||

nt|bt: or get to nt|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4 to go|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that was clear way to play it, since South's 2@H normally shows only three hearts, leaving North with two big ones in the end position.|pg||

nt|ady: 12 back   well timed bid|pg||

nt|dburn:  you see what I mean?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think rebid will be    2@C=4@H  unbalanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think deWijs was the one who psyched  4@S bid  holding something like  x QJxxxx Qxxxx x when partner opened 3@D|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@h for EW but S bids it first...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=unbalanced|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bocchi alerted 1@s, probably because it shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: 5@h even..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 28  800|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ady: spades best for n/s   difficult to find now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looking at it more deeply he had to choose if partner had the @c or @s ace|pg||
nt|skaftij:  the 4-1 break make 4@s difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most play support DBL only thru 2@H|pg||
nt|szalay: but over 2M it shows extras|pg||
nt|pbundy: dennis - that is why i am quite often loathe to write off ANYONE in these competitions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry missed it   2N= 4@H 6@D|pg||
nt|pbundy: matches can swing by a lot without tons of boards to go|pg||
nt|jbennet: might work when you sit and home and bid hands as pracitse with no opponents|pg||
nt|jbennet: east probed for game  with 2 sp and then respected his p decision. |pg||
nt|brgpro: will stop in 4 i bet|pg||
nt|roswolf: thiws might well be bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: west might well try a splinter bid.|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT good hearts|pg||
nt|jbennet: or show his 2nd suit , |pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@d is at pd's throat...hard to judg, i think 3@c is perhaps his choice|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is a 50% slam so :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe 4@D if that splinter is allowed in the system|pg||
nt|jbennet: to show 2nd suit not a bad idea at all, he might get a good flop. 3235 or 4234 with suitable cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Part of the game:)|pg||
nt|lml: on the lie of the cards e-w can do pretty well in a minor|pg||
nt|xenya: much depends on how NS treat this sequence...|pg||
nt|lml: but no way to know that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jorgs bidding doesnt match their CC|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2NT = FG raise|pg||
nt|brgpro: think he will introduce his 2nd suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess that tarzan will get to 4@H|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes totally agree, 4d leaves no room for p.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: or maybe he just thinks his spades are not good enough for a weak-two|pg||
nt|athene: i bet bocchi is not so demure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: seems a cross ruff game here|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that the defence is overrruffing|pg||
nt|lml: he has five top tricks so he needs to make 3 little diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he can make a ruff of a small club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hard to do so with this layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11  Stefanov in 4@H on the Moysian|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually declarer after correct guess in @ss has to keep all his @ds in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: and it appears 3@S was just a signoff|pg||
nt|bt: so if u have like 26 hcp and 53, get to the major, u need the extra ruff|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S?|pg||
nt|brgpro: rather than a crowded 4@d|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@s=@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: I wrote what Jorgensen wrote to N|pg||
nt|skaftij:  4@d void probably|pg||
nt|bt: with 28 or more get to nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, there is no threat of an adverse ruff in NT, of course.|pg||
nt|bt: at least thats my interpretation of how they played, must ask them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S according to cc is GI-relay [15]|pg||
nt|barnets: USA building a strong lead - now by 38|pg||
nt|brolucius: As often happens, we are assigned a penance of 1NT after an exciting board.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes regaining your composure is necessary once you have been through the wringer|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2@c=puppet to 2@d...XYZ|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pawel90:  5@D byÅo tanie|pg||
nt|sybarra: has a bit to handle however |pg||
nt|leao:  6 even, without  @d lead |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course and that is what he has :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will not make this...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  have to go have fun all|pg||
nt|skaftij:  running scores |pg||
nt|skaftij:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|runnerup: now @d lead needed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Jonsson asked if he has to much|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Baldursson answer is: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: north in closed room made an imiganative bid of 4@C over 1N rebid|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is easy for text-books to tell us not to allow a bad board to affect our subsequent play. This advice is all too difficult to follow, as we have seen here.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they are laughing about the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more from Venice Cup  USA2 trailing Indonesia by 21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that match is on BBO |pg||
nt|jbennet: in real life with agressive opponents however: The subsequent bidding may be ruined. |pg||
nt|kit: It is often right to table a singleton ace of trumps, but here I think the diamond lead is reasonable -- might get a ruff in partner's hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the orangemen have avoided 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously  this is the time when 3N rolls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not |pg||
nt|brgpro: well, i am wrong or Bocchi forgot?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: south apparently wants to know whether to play 3NT or 4@s, and that's an easy decision for north|pg||
nt|lml: a spade lead will not be helpful to the defense|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @c ruffs would give alot of defensive tricks.. 2 ruffs A@H A@S 2@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no i dont know what that means :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told by a kibitzer that a recent analysis showed (in world championship play) that 3NT played better than four of a major when the hands are balanced. He says that Glyn ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Liggins (of England) was the author. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they have 25 minutes left|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have not read it, but it would be interesting to see.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this hand south has no reason to play 4@H for sure|pg||
nt|kit: jack of spades lead a thoughtful shot -- but not for this hand. |pg||
nt|roswolf: favorite to go -1 which will still gain imps|pg||
nt|brgpro: declarer needs to get @d right and @s finesse to make this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DKTx is too tough with no transportation for 3N|pg||
nt|roswolf: might well get the trumps right on the auction|pg||
nt|brgpro: but it is not impossible though...the 3@h jump might be the clue...if he has a sing...what could that be...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: win   @SQ [duck]   @DQ seems very reasonable|pg||
nt|rv: Lauria's 4@c was not warranted in OR in last deal|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panosk: tough contract lets see how he deals with it|pg||
nt|panosk: prefer semi forcing 2@D with W hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bye Ruud and thanks from all of us'|pg||
nt|jillan:  interesting results so far in the Venice Cup BOT American teams are down. USA 2 against Indonesia 198/219. USA 1 against Netherlands 171/172|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Indonesia just picked up more  leading by 34|pg||
nt|jbennet: this time south decidednot to overcall 1 sp (clearcut).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the round robin  1) USA2  2) USA1   so these are big upsets|pg||
nt|jbennet: giving EW room to scientifically find out that 6h was there for taking. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: players not explaining, so i can't tell you what 3@d or 3@h means|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 25  [5@SE-1]   Wooldridge in 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: probably bertheau is relaying|pg||
nt|roswolf: never close to the slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: pity that the position of @C A decides and not judgement / technic|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Natural 4@S but appears difficult to make on J@D lead.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3C for 5 card major|pg||
nt|leao:  yes, he has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 6 with j10 of spades dropping|pg||
nt|leao:  rite|pg||
nt|leao:  @d and @d?|pg||
nt|bt: i also never look for a major w 4333, its just so i dont waste my energy deciding or give up information |pg||
nt|runnerup: @s lead |pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're only 5 boards ahead of the other table    almost always happen for Grue-Lall|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@c by W would have been @d|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 3@s=@c|pg||
nt|brgpro: i was told|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must guess if @SQ covered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Bocchi thinks his hand too good to hear  2@D-P|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3NT pass pass W would X that, asking for a @h|pg||
nt|brgpro: so NS have plenty of time to run to 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver in 3@D|pg||
nt|rv: looks like Bocchi has forgotten sys here|pg||
nt|rv: as Jack remarked|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c is puppet to play in 2@d or Inv hands, 2@d would be GF if playing 2 way checkback here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: think this will end in game|pg||
nt|ady: not slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW have a Note 3 defining continuations after 2@D, but there's not much I can see about what they do after interference  |pg||
nt|dburn:  still, this isn't down yet|pg||
nt|dburn:  if if South gives North a ruff it will be, but otherwise there are chances|pg||
nt|ahollan1: typically  relays get  exact distribution then total controls [A=2 K=1]  or for this pair  zz points  A=3 K=2 Q=1|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nystrom writes 3@s = 'i think 1462' |pg||
nt|rv: some play 2 way checkback only on 1x-1y-1n, a few others play it on 1x-1y-1z as well|pg||
mb|d|nt|wild card: 3@h conventional, I've seen Americans do that before|pg||
nt|wild card: with both @dA and @cK offside, he will go down|pg||
nt|wild card: and 3NT might be made|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems to imply that responder should bid Stayman (rather than make a transfer bid) when he is 5-3-3-2 with a 5-card major and sound game values. |pg||
nt|barnets: south is still thinking what that means|pg||
nt|brgpro: w has to x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: XYZ is same as 2-way checkback but expanded to cover  3rd bid being 1@H or 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: could go wrong   |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: score board 28 corrected...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to rise with spade ace after d finesse loses|pg||
nt|ady: then play for K@C with north|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays clubs now and north wins and plays a 2nd spade  will again have to play the ace|pg||
nt|odysseus69: much debate - should he play clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: diamond finesse now looks normal|pg||
nt|ady: club can wait|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Zack shaking his head.. perhaps thinking about board 25?|pg||
nt|ady: good duck of spade from south|pg||
nt|leao:  nope|pg||
nt|ady: looks good for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chick:  and the Venice Cup for those interested:   http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=882|pg||
nt|andersk: well I do not lead @H A|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: ten Grue jest bardzo grony|pg||
nt|sybarra: but not a slam "we" want to be in |pg||
nt|andersk: 4 sp makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: it did|pg||
nt|jbgood: so one imp for Sweden most likely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he did not play|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  11  [3@C S -1]  Muller in 4@S east|pg||
nt|barnets: by a pssed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lall DBL  must made Bertheau's hand HUGE|pg||
nt|jbennet: south probably judged that they were ahead enough in this match. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bertheau was telling the same|pg||
nt|jbennet: so the otherwise normal overcall of 1 sp  was not necessary. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: from what i've seen on vugraph   DBLs during relay sequences are huge LOSER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL  not only gives relayers info about opp hands   but  worse  gives them extra space|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: USA picked up 12 imps on 25, as did the dutch women in their match against usa2|pg||
nt|rv: Italians are self destructing here, this match is far from over|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bocchi looking at the bidding in amazement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hope Dennis can understand the italian postmortem|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i wonder what he will say when dummy comes down|pg||
nt|rv: Lauria on brd 28 in CR and Bocchi here on brd 29|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: he is trying for the crossruff but it wont work for him|pg||
nt|leao:  lol... agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few people do that, though.|pg||
nt|hlortz: south has both xtra high cards and no aces - that points me to 3n also|pg||
nt|bt: so 3nt was slam invitaional presumably|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although if partner has defined a balanced 18-19, double can be used as penalty - but maybe that's hopelessly old-fashioned|pg||
nt|dburn:  although if North forces dummy with a diamond, there will be too much for declarer to do|pg||
nt|dburn:  not that diamond, mind you - but West may not believe that she can run it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why @DK? North won't lead from @DAQ - and the ace might be singleton  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 32 is final board of the match -- actually it is board 96|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: against usa1, that was|pg||
nt|brgpro: let's who gorgot...|pg||
nt|rv: they have let Dutch back into this match|pg||
nt|brgpro: forgot|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: saying nothing, just looking at it|pg||
nt|brgpro: only 500 though|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: west might have pushed with 5@C   and taken a view if east cu 5@D|pg||
nt|wild card: he can discard 3 clubs now|pg||
nt|wild card: but after @d10, I doubt he will depend on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lechcold: przepraszam, priv:) ale Joe Grue, naprawdê jest grony|pg||
nt|kit: Not that anything else is particularly better.|pg||
nt|roswolf: an overtrick is on here|pg||
nt|brgpro: side suit|pg||
nt|jbennet: so west did indeed show 2nd suit. Surprsingly east bid only bid 4h. |pg||
nt|brgpro: but 12 away|pg||
nt|rv: still 12 IMPs away?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bocchi telling muller 2@c was GF, 2@d natural sign off|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now they are discussing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: but not when W didnt cach the club ...|pg||
nt|bt: hurd has no clear lead here, i would try that too|pg||
nt|bt: i dont think this auction makes ducking @DA a difficult play|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 3@s-4@d(if cue) W might have givenn one more try|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|leao:  goig for the forcing defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: may end up making only 5 |pg||
nt|leao:  well, he's in 4, so no problem|pg||
nt|boedhy:  hi all back|pg||
nt|sybarra: re hi Ruud |pg||
nt|boedhy:  not much imps going on i see|pg||
nt|boedhy:  board 24 only|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 24  |pg||
nt|leao:  ruff, @d to dummy and @d back.... if W ruffs, he'll be ruffing pards trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes that was a extreme result|pg||
nt|leao:  yes, Miguel felt the urge to show pard he had @h as well, instead of leading pards suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we losing connection or is Bas thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bas is thinking|pg||
nt|leao:  looks like hes thinking|pg||
nt|olegario: sure now trying for an extra trick which may not happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not after 4-1 trump split|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although Norht might have pre-empted with seven diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn:  now, declarer will do well to get out for down one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: premature Q@C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT much easier - if I had 5 card Stayman would I use it? dont tink so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean so you dont have to lead?|pg||
nt|runnerup: i just cant see that north has any rigth to bid to 3 @c -but he did (i think south agrees)|pg||
nt|xenya: can make by setting up hearts|pg||
nt|skaftij:  ith 3-2 spades 4 spades also off after 3 rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C is final contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are four more sessions of 16 boards, so there is no need to push hard after a couple of bad boards.|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, even with the best defence, since N has @sKx, ( 10 is on too), he can make this if he guesses @d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ryskiel_: jakby dali graæ|pg||
nt|panosk: hoping for spades 3-3|pg||
nt|andersk: now even easier|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why is ducking something that West should consider?|pg||
nt|ady: Italy disappointed A@C right|pg||
nt|kit: Note good technique of winning king of diamonds.  If Levin wins ace both opponents will know there is no diamond trick coming, since if Levin had Ax he would have gone up queen.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wild card: probably he will have to|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the scorebaords again http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as we near the end of this round|pg||
nt|bobholl: de wijs muller still bidding :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as if @C ever get any respect  now they're premature|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: madala going through the notes now|pg||
nt|brgpro: i do think after 1@d-1@h-1@s, 2@c XYZ has its advantages, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: can you grab a copy for me??|pg||
nt|rv: even best in business forget system in second round of bidding on fairly basic sequence|pg||
nt|rv: rest of us still hope to continue playing game competitively:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of earmarks of Italian Blue Team was their ability to have a disaster and say NOTHING|pg||
nt|rv: Bocchi assumed 2@c (4th suit) was GF, Madala thought 2@c was puppet to 2@d to play or variety of Inv hands|pg||
nt|rv: they will sort it out soon at the cost of 12 IMPs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: the good news is that the long hand is overrufing the spades|pg||
nt|lml: so he will probably come to the diamond 9 eventually for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: west claims|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lechcold: gramy z USA2 o 16:45 jakby co...|pg||
nt|ady: not going well|pg||
nt|lml: this should make the endplay obvious|pg||
pc|s3|nt|davidstern: Losing 0-1-1-2|pg||
nt|davidstern: Down 1 I estimate|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein waits expectantly for third diamond to come through -- he is disappointed.|pg||
nt|gracelin: lucky for China the opening lead only costs them an overtrick.|pg||
nt|kit: did he really lead a club from dummy?  I find that hard to believe|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for voice commentators   yes, lead was @CA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 32 trump   may start with @DA|pg||
nt|brgpro: but since W had the right explaination, he had to X and have no objection for the wrong info his pd got|pg||
nt|rv: now 14 IMPS|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: well done by North but ducking club jack was VERY anti percentage|pg||
nt|panosk: actually trying to discard hearts from dummy and ruff his heart loser in hand|pg||
nt|panosk: *from hand|pg||
nt|panosk: also found out that spades arent 3-3 |pg||
pc|cA|nt|antoniz: oby tak skutecznie jak ze Szwecj¹ do tej pory:)|pg||
nt|kit: In other room contract is 5@C, which is much more interesting.|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wd|pg||
nt|panosk: Isreal in 6@S in previous gained them a hefty 13 imps , new leader|pg||
nt|bt: mainly because he has nothing to play back, and maybe north will play for a @D underlead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wild card: now his only hope is for west to have only 2 or 3 trumps|pg||
nt|andersk: Upmark not happy with that, however the split makes it easy|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: played for K@C with south when north played low   and king to come down in 3|pg||
nt|panosk: if N had K@D cud have made |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: or jack|pg||
nt|panosk: well not really if N ducked heart ruff decl wud have to play diamonds himself|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: wd S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: so who wants to be endplayed|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pachtman did wait for it - he just claimed 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: did not bither with club finesse|pg||
nt|ady: bother|pg||
nt|xenya: so the par here is 5@CX -1|pg||
nt|ritong: he has something to play back|pg||
nt|brolucius: West hoped that partner had a top trump and a doubleton club. He could then win and cross to @CA for a ruff.|pg||
nt|barnets: a spade was led|pg||
nt|brgpro: N doesnt look like to have sing. @dK...so small @d...|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction   hard to imagine @DQ being bad play|pg||
nt|roswolf: just the 3 imps|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: i wonder what the record is for most bbo vugraph tables in play at any one time|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the lull after a 36-IMP storm.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: whew   i got that in print just in time|pg||
nt|rv: Dennis did Bocchi actually @DK or @SK?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: which seems his only chance as @S K is certainly offside|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: double squeeze now|pg||
nt|ady: north has to keep a top club  and south has to keep heart  so 3rd diamond is a trick|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ah can get there often enough|pg||
nt|runnerup: good guess -but still looses imps|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|panosk: i learn as i go :)|pg||
nt|barnets: which gives aqway a trick|pg||
nt|rv: many specs pointing out he must have played @DK|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: play is shown as it went|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|barnets: for def|pg||
nt|kit: might not be a lull -- check out other room.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wild card: well done, smelled his chance to make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a short break requested by one of the players|pg||
nt|panosk: still very gd play from Zack|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but does that beat the spread for Italy v China?|pg||
nt|roswolf: and duly made|pg||
nt|nkgupt: OR in slam on priv.|pg||
nt|brgpro: the Dutch are in 6@H OR|pg||
nt|bobholl: orange can use luck :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes he did|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this the correct play :)|pg||
nt|kit: That is imcomprehensible to me.  If hearts had been 2-2, he would have just gone down when cold if ace of spades on.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or what Jack said|pg||
nt|brgpro: in any case, we are back to even|pg||
nt|rv: all our operators here in Holland have been superb, hardly any errors, I should't have asked for clarification|pg||
mb|2H|nt|skaftij:  Very favourable lie of the cards for EW|pg||
nt|lml: Still both sides are playing very good bridge|pg||
nt|boedhy:  27 looks like a good board too|pg||
nt|ritong: not even the @c jack?|pg||
nt|jbennet: east was a little lucky that slam was only 50%. give west club queen as well and it would have been a more or  less cast-iron 6h. |pg||
nt|brgpro: after a prec 1@c and positive 1@h...|pg||
nt|roswolf: well team orange on a roll|pg||
mb|3C|nt|skaftij:  6@h can be made but is odds against|pg||

nt|skaftij:  the nebulous @d|pg||

mb|p|nt|famus: yes that cud a handful|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 27 / SORRY|pg||
nt|famus: be*|pg||
nt|ady: likely e/w will reach 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=15-20 BAL or game force |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@S on the cards.|pg||
nt|wild card: north's hand looks like 6@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: note how both W's answered with only 1 point over 1@c|pg||
nt|panosk: and 5 imps to Isreal for not quitting desperate contract|pg||
nt|leao:  board 26 also took its toll|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@d= 5@s5@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: inverted 2@D    |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i will tell him off at the end :)|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: [sorry  or unbal 5+@C 15+ HCP]   1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Bulgaria need the points much more than Israel who were 3rd over night|pg||
nt|ady: no good fit for n/s   heading for 3NT   |pg||
nt|ady: not wild about overcall   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s only one down?|pg||
nt|rv: at this stage in the event, whoever makes lesser mistakes or last but one mistake wins:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: not mentioning @h Kxx, always a small problem to hold Hxx in other major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i forgot Martel was allowed to bid|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  making here n/s|pg||
nt|panosk: if you cancell out 2 slams one gained and one lost for each team the vast majority of imps were scored by part scores|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Not goo dfor Brasil tho who should imo be possible to end up in the top 8 is getting difficult |pg||
nt|ady: 3@C  must show diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@c is a transfer to 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a possibilty for n/s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@C the limit for EW|pg||
nt|xenya: as expected, 3N on 9 was made in the OR -- 10 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Dubion had PASS out of the box more than once - and chooses to stay with it|pg||
nt|bardo: no il +1 non c'è stato|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is good to see that there are some hands where 2@H is opened on both sides of the Atlantic.|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would bid 1nt on west's hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: wouldnt stop north bidding but would give pard some info|pg||
nt|gracelin: he set up a trap.|pg||
nt|roswolf: south may pass here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H is obstructive|pg||
nt|rv: exciting bridge, but not necessarily high-quality|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: ok, NS system in the other room put west on lead against the slam, so japan didn't get their imp |pg||
nt|brolucius: East OK for a diamond pre-empt, as I see it. No need to worry about a big heart fit because N/S would then have a big spade fit.|pg||
nt|barnets: he has a ruffing finesse in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  But not likely to go beyond 2@s|pg||
nt|leao:  NS have 4@s|pg||
nt|leao:  and EW do not have 4@h|pg||
nt|bt: ew overcompeted here in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: the trap wasnt sprung|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, Madala made a discipline pass.|pg||
nt|pbundy: this would be my lead here, too :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: looks like +140.|pg||
nt|brgpro: now 3NT|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes...everytime i played BB, i lost 4-5 kgs at the end |pg||
mb|4N|nt|lml: interesting|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Play in @h. low to 8 first |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Zero leads|pg||
nt|ady: is 1@D forcing?|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will be a bit jaundiced|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the cards lie very well for north-south|pg||
nt|ehsana: DBL was nota good option ??|pg||
nt|wild card: this will probably force p to bid 4@s, he will ask for keycards|pg||
nt|yuval10: the logic is to enable partner to bid with a big hand and /or 2 suiter hand in which he doesn't open 2@c with |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West: I hop I don't have to much|pg||
nt|panosk: * Israel sorry|pg||
nt|skaftij:  When entering dummy second time, run the 10|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: will west offer notrumps, or just bash in 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: he surely must bid SOME game, with a good 17 count facing drury|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: why not?|pg||
nt|athene: versace going for singleton heart with his partner and an immediate knockout|pg||
nt|ady: would need a club ruff to beat 4@H   but n/s not in the bidding|pg||
nt|bt: this is the type of auctions where north has to base his action on south having some values, like 6-7 hcp|pg||
nt|brolucius: Look at the Open Room bidding, by putting your cursor on the Open Room result (top left). East broke a fundamental rule of bidding by going to 4@H, He had made a limit bid and knew ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: little of what partner held.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein would have some chances if Levin's ace of hearts were ace of diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing 'ace for attitude, king for count' leads, North could lead the @SK to ask partner to unblock any honor he might hold, otherwise to give count. This would allow North to ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: judge if the @SQ was falling from West.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession    i would lead @D|pg||
nt|jbennet: and now a possible +200.|pg||
nt|roswolf: they will have been in worse partscores|pg||
nt|ady: west should tell his partner not to be concerned for overtricks|pg||
nt|brgpro: so this is a very tough event to play in|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: curiously  most tables will have identical auction even though very different inferences|pg||
nt|star6ija: have to go now , see you at 4:45 CET for the next Bulgaria's hard fight agains Poland|pg||
nt|star6ija: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bye|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|ady: need to take some care here   defenders each had a side suit singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table..thinking|pg||
nt|kamyk: ale by³ to sensowny plan - krótki @DK u wchodz¹cego|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwna gra|pg||
nt|yuval10: and in worst case you play 2NT with the points equal between both sides|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Campos sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nope |pg||
nt|szalay: I think weak openings survive cause weak overcall is coming|pg||
nt|skaftij:  lost opportunity for Iceland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've only ruled out @H lead|pg||
nt|kit: North does have a problem here -- but as the hand is, anything but king of spades defeats the contract.|pg||
nt|ady: north surprise at 2NT with what he has in spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: some good some bad and some indifferent bridge but boy very exciting too|pg||
nt|nkgupt: italy likely to loose a few on this one|pg||
nt|bobholl: hope sjoert won't guess to lead a @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|jbennet: will defenders kan take all their 6 tricks?. |pg||
nt|brgpro: he heard me...|pg||
mb|6S|nt|skaftij:  this can be defeated with 3x @s after takin @cs|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so south didnt bid anything yet (thats a first) and his partner bids 4@s and he has thid hand....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump makes a lot of sense |pg||
nt|skaftij:  good lead|pg||
nt|xenya: and a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially with West showing at least invitational strength|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=good raise to 2@h, as they are playing transfers after the double |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they do, both explained it as good @H raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so East may well bid 4@h now, knowing the good fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and then NS may save....|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4@D sounds strange to me... what should it mean, cant be to prepare a sac against 4@S since you would pass 3 probably...|pg||
nt|dburn:  4@d shows diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn:  and offers a possible contract|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes but why would you do?|pg||
nt|dburn:  I know there are very few bids in the modern game, but this is one of them|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: might|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's revolutionary, 4@D showing diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=takeout  0-3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: i think it was the right thing to do|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and @h K might be a falsecard with KJx|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S has a chnace now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and declarer will make this one - is my guess|pg||
nt|ady: another chance for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3S shows 4S and 5H - Smolen is what I thnk its called|pg||
nt|leao:  no 5@s with d lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: evryone is saying 6@C on the major squeeze|pg||
nt|skaftij:  that will take care of (A)Qxx in North|pg||
nt|brolucius: He could hardly hope to shut out a spade fit if North/South held one.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he can make this but is not easy|pg||
nt|runnerup: so he took @s finess after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  At last some action :-)|pg||
nt|lml: the problem here is getting to the 1 point hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: also of course it makes life tougher for opps|pg||
nt|barnets: so fleishers imagination brought in 10 more tricks for usa|pg||
nt|barnets: 10 more imps |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 51-5 this set|pg||
nt|barnets: i meant|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: big set for the americans|pg||
nt|barnets: fleisher Kamil were very effective in round robinthird in Butler scoring|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might instead have led the @S10, since he expected West to hold a spade stopper and the lower lead might work well when South held only two spades.|pg||
nt|grebrof: even 2@s could have been 3@s, but the suit is kinda thin and maybe even short nowadays when you dbl with any opening hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so game missed :(|pg||
nt|bobholl: well this is the best lead for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: can be made on this lead|pg||
nt|lml: once they didnt lead hearts it can be made if you guess all|pg||
nt|yuval10: he just play A@s and J@s|pg||
nt|lml: you need to tap the dummy at trick two|pg||
nt|ady: n/s do have 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12-7 to team orange thus far - awesome bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: high level bridge as a way to lose weight  -  a new campaign for the acbl!!|pg||
nt|rv: this is 11th consecutive day of 48 brds, teams playing finals have to play 3 more days|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: east a little worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: @CK lead not all that appealing on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: west likely to have a strong notrump sort of hand; it could easily cost|pg||
nt|rv: lol Al|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: new leader|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course easier said than done|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein works out that there is no miracle layout, so sets up his diamond trick to minimize the damage.|pg||
nt|barnets: the butler scoring scores your result with every other pair playing in opposite direction|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: this set|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: 1 top trump helps|pg||
nt|lechcold: 130 i -2 impy|pg||
nt|leao:  best decision. shug go 2 off|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah finally he bids|pg||
nt|barnets: and gives a rough idea how each pair is playing|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|wild card: probably he wasn't considering anything else than 6@s, but east had some questions about the auction or kept the tray for a couple of seconds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No play, can cash a @C otherwise make 7.|pg||
nt|rv: 1 IMP for needy here|pg||
nt|brgpro: good lead...to save an imp|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: trump lead is very appealing on this bidding so duboin might play north for the @SQ from the failure to lead a trump|pg||
nt|ady: west not leading a heart as north had shown 5 hearts  4 spades and a game going hand with 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told that Brink is allergic to PASS cards|pg||
pc|dK|nt|famus: is he going to hook @s straight away?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately the bidding didn't help them diagnose the obvious squeeze :) 1 to me|pg||
nt|xenya: i can't make out NS's auction at all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: looks like  11  Stefanov may actually make 4@H in the Moysian fit|pg||
nt|ady: small trump best|pg||
nt|odysseus69: look it up - i will ask|pg||
nt|ady: but e/w have the same in diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college systems were invented to ensure i was on opening lead|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: cant see how that helps defence|pg||
nt|lechcold: zarówno 1BA jak i pas na 1BA jako mi siê nie podobaj¹:(|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think 5@s is makeable...|pg||
nt|sybarra: club club  maybe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will not be pleased with this, I think - but they will score more than if they defended 4@sx  |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: on the other hand the threat of a club ruff might make him just bash out @SAK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now, it be even go 2 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East will surely ditch a @h|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what is the range of 1NT - 14-16 i guess but sure to find out in a moment|pg||
nt|ady: 11 in OR     maybe an extra heart as they lay|pg||
pc|sT|nt|leao:  not with @d lead and @h back :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they cannt get there @d tricks|pg||
nt|bt: are the nz team allowed to do that "haka" before their matches? seems like they did against usa1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: best for declarer to play 2nd round of clubs from east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: in the tank now|pg||
nt|ady: of course we can see that   easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2 times @c|pg||

mb|1N!|an|12-15|nt|wild card: north's hand looks like 3NT|pg||
nt|oosmanb: part game battle|pg||
nt|ritong: tea time, david|pg||
nt|bt: this is a bad 14 count, and fallenius agrees|pg||
nt|bt: losing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after 1@H-dbl, what about 3@D as a fit-jump? East might be better placed then|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: we will resume in 1h and 15 mins from now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 87 imps swung this set   net gain for Italy ....  5|pg||
nt|brgpro: let's see how they run after 1NT opening|pg||
nt|rv: double here to show values|pg||
mb|d|nt|wild card: the heart stopper and the high card point count are not sufficient though|pg||
nt|bt: he will show it as 11-13|pg||
nt|ady: big mis fit e/w  if they get busy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was there some psychological point to 3 rounds of @C ending in dummy?    there was no longer transportation to protect against West holding @DJxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: why not 1N from Karaivanov???   i thought 9-12 in this situation|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand 4@S and 5@D.|pg||
nt|leao:  31-2 with no good boards coming is not a goo omen|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   lost connection|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 1NT by N most likely|pg||
nt|oosmanb: by South actually|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has bid 1@S in response to his partner's transfer bid.|pg||
nt|bt: probably east passed and south bid 1@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 11-14, 1nt is 15-17 when vul|pg||
nt|davidstern: So having commentated live for two sessions and with my fingers for one session I wish you all adieu|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein taking full advantage of the vulnerability to jack up the auction.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, too late now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@d=4+@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: well yes, mostly 4card support for fit jumps... though still not getting 4@D, if she has support 4@H should be reasonalbe if she has not she will correct to 4@H anyway...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vulnerable   jump overcalls are intermediate|pg||
nt|jbennet: had north had club ace and not the jack, hi might have at least ponder for 1 sec or 2|pg||
nt|brgpro: i  believe we have similar things in chinese but i cant remember any!|pg||
nt|kit: Note West opens 1NT even though no rebid problems after opening 1@D.  This is becoming the common trend.|pg||
nt|brgpro: 17 opposite 4...they were in 3NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems odd byt true|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS=forcing unless 4333|pg||
nt|rv: on weak nt, double is usually played as values, on strong nt some play conventional treatment |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass by muller not forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: both teams are playing good bridge with Canada making a few good decisions |pg||
nt|lechcold: to nie bêdzie ciekawe rozdanie|pg||
nt|bt: aha ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing hearts + unspecified?|pg||
mb|p|an|any 4333|nt|udo: no,,,,,,,1NT is a preempt,,so never downgrade:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, sorry, 1@S for take-out.|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D in open on 30|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I think so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vanProoijen-Verhees  play Raptor NT overcall  so  DBL is needed with Strong NT|pg||
nt|brgpro: well...they dont!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wild card: 5@d needs attentive declarer play|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Do zwrotu 2@H@H i@C...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: He is showing 2 suits, but couldn't read which one is specified|pg||
nt|ady: keep out now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everybody recognizes Pinball Wizard|pg||
nt|nkgupt: that time better to count the eggs i suppose|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but you know the dutch saying :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: so on this board the numer of tricks changed froma start defender 6: declarer 7: after the heart play from west defenders: 5 declarer:8.|pg||
nt|meargent: they might get to 6@Ss if west refuses transfer|pg||
nt|kit: This super-accept will get East very interested in slam|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer DONT runouts or Twisted swine on double of weak nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and with full disclosure   EW do announce that West is some 4333|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: opening 1NT has other virtues than showing 15/17|pg||
nt|ady: too high e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks for n/s in hearts   though e/w have a good save in spades|pg||
nt|xenya: or S|pg||
nt|bt: well he better take it oout then|pg||
nt|brolucius: North showed spades, so East had a 1@S bid for take-out. Double would mean something else.|pg||
nt|roswolf: north tempted to pass the t/ox|pg||
nt|roswolf: but chose the macho bid|pg||
nt|brgpro: sorry...i will never question again....both teams in the BB semi final got to 3NT...|pg||
nt|brgpro: i am only sitting here watching...i must have missed something|pg||
nt|roswolf: :) different level of bridge - my club game tonight will be pedestrian by comparison|pg||
nt|rv: playing DONT runouts, XX is single suiter, 2@c is @c+another, 2@d is @d+maj, 2@h is majors|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphznv: Tournament Director has arrived and tells they have 10 minutes left|pg||

nt|antoniz: tak|pg||
nt|kit: But normal 4@S contract reached, and with no bad splits appears to make easily.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 40 years ago, or so, it was thought ungentlemanly to give the name of the declarer if he had made a stupid play and done down. Also ridiculous. Continuing the football analogy, can ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: you imagine the Times reporting that 'one of the Arsenal players missed a penalty in the 52nd minute'?|pg||
nt|kit: well, if I'm writing up a match and somebody makes a bad play, the world will know exactly who.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Mike Lawrence in seminal book of Overcalls was first to suggest IN WRITING   situational strength of jump overcalls|pg||
nt|brgpro: just learned!|pg||
nt|rv: playing twisted swing, all of the above and pass forces redouble by partner to play or run (2@c) with 4333|pg||
nt|rv: twisted swine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA ask attitude  @S9=discourage|pg||
nt|brgpro: not that terrible...maybe just -2with 3NT making NS|pg||
nt|brgpro: might even be a small gain|pg||
nt|brgpro: i meant -3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver  3N North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: typical holding for lead of Ace   AKx|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: 10 tricks claimed very shortly |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a normal 3nt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  good sacrifice|pg||
nt|lechcold: prawie na jedno wychodzi:)|pg||
nt|leao:  this shud make and be flat|pg||
nt|boedhy:  thats true but then again it depends were you stand |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe even I could make this one|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suppose the writer did not want his own mistakes written up later.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's double is a take-out double and South has the usualy two duties: to choose a trump suit (or NT) and to show the strength of his hand. Here 2@S would not show his extra ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: strength. |pg||
nt|ady: ended quietly|pg||
nt|gracelin: trump lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they punt the game regardless|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer can work on either clubs or diamonds as both suits break favorably for declarer.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks ok with the even breaks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: do you like bypassing diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: it did work to get them a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lead is asked @d 6|pg||
nt|athene: it's definitely not a bad 15 count|pg||
nt|wild card: I guess he'll lead Q of @c|pg||
nt|ady: need A@D right     predictably both rooms in game|pg||
nt|yuval10: running scores :  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's double will be a Support Double, showing 3-card support for partner's spades.|pg||
nt|bt: wow usa clearly wants to choose sweden|pg||
nt|barnets: I think that is right - some writers go out there way not to though|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy got one swing by making 4H on the hand Bocchi shift to D to set it.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: opening bids are getting lighter|pg||
nt|kit: But RKC will tell them they are off an ace and the queen of trumps.  East will then stop, since there could be third round heart or club problems from his point of view.|pg||
nt|rialc2: 21 but very good deal: E/W must be very careful to bit this game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H5 "attitude"|pg||
nt|brgpro: if W jumps up the A, he needs to switch to a @C|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w must take care here|pg||
nt|brgpro: now looking at the cards, i realize why i am not playing there...|pg||
nt|rialc2: and then he has to duck the 2nd @C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H8 played in other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: that certainly looks correct|pg||
nt|brgpro: after @h8 , declarer almost has 0% chance...too much to do and defence will find @c switch soon or after|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed jack|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wild card: plenty of time to shift to a heart later on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q alright but @D:)|pg||
nt|ady: -300 in 4@S    dont thin n/s can be sure of 5@H|pg||
nt|ady: they have taken the push|pg||
nt|runnerup: do more + for Sw..|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ady: north pened a tactical lead direct 1 spade in 3rd seat to get the right lead if defending|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in OR South found a response to 1H - there is an old system called Acol- where 2H opener shows 8 or more tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: a touch-and-go game, the Q@s makes this contract an excellent one|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W have found their club fit.|pg||
nt|bt: that 1@S takeout was just horrendous and his poor partner has to play it|pg||
nt|jbennet: what a shot from south.|pg||
nt|jbennet: positive thinking.|pg||
nt|jbennet: and it will probably make,too.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  Madala fears deWijs holding  HTxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but this was the risk -- fears a shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy -- you're right|pg||
nt|brgpro: as long as W opening the bidding in OR, 3NT shd be made|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  1@C opened in other room|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andy, gm|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: ducked it ... cool|pg||
nt|ehsana: 2H shows 4spades|pg||
nt|ritong: that too|pg||
nt|udo: style is to upgrade much more often than the other way|pg||
nt|athene: three aces and the @H10 makes up for 4333|pg||
nt|leao:  if i can, u surely can :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6nt looks cold|pg||
nt|skaftij:  kibs point out that AQxx cannot be handled |pg||
nt|skaftij:  EW play "HÃ¤xan"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: east in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West has shown about 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson will be reluctant|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they bid it in the open room|pg||
nt|skaftij:  otoh, they bid agressively|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: east is stil in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With 12-14 and @c, West would bid 2@c and revert to 2@h over 2@d I think|pg||
nt|ritong: thank you, pard|pg||
nt|bt: thing is we all make horrendous mistakes but it is partnerpreserving to play them yourself|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could not really hope to win the auction to good effect when his partner could not speak over 1@C. So, wiser to pass.|pg||
nt|bt: not only is woolridge upset over his partners bids, he also have to play a really awful contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: East is expecting better clubs opposite because he asked partner to choose between the red suits.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have doubled 1@H to get in the auction safely 1@S should have good shape including clubs on actual auction|pg||
nt|szalay: bald is very agressive today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H denied 4-fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: TRUMP LEAD as expected by us commentators|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer will probably win in hand to start D|pg||
nt|roswolf: oops|pg||
nt|brgpro: well done|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: I like the small club|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if it gets north|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: perfect play the small @c|pg||
nt|xenya: not likely to make -- but you never know|pg||
nt|bt: thing is only real suit shown by ns is spades so a take out is for all other suits|pg||
nt|jbennet: east had a chance to x 3NT |pg||
nt|kit: West, however, isn't too worried about that -- so he might gamble on picking up the queen|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the other semifinal can not be closer... 61-60|pg||
nt|brgpro: still need to duck the next @C( not so difficult?)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: this is cruisy should be well in time|pg||

nt|skaftij:  pick a slam?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now west turn|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Some tell me West may have shown (17) 18-19|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Or they guess|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With no obvious fit, East lacks intermediates|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: west stil thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy has been with us the entire time -- doing Voice Commentary with Hedy and Peter|pg||
nt|rv: yes he told me, Roland doing Voice in US-1 vs US-2?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no  Roland in other room of our match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BBO always doing voice in both rooms of one match|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6@c for iceland on board 12|pg||
nt|bt: anyway thanks hurd!!|pg||
nt|bt: you can come here anytime|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: had north wanted south on lead for something he may have ducked|pg||
nt|lml: looks like north will get a spade and a club for +1|pg||
nt|lml: for Baxter|pg||
nt|lml: Israel made an extra uptrick on the previous board to come back to a 9 imp deficit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: +1 it seems to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but N is thinking a lot|pg||
nt|lml: my guess is he will shift to a heart|pg||
nt|lml: it wont matter|pg||
nt|lml: second choice is another diamond|pg||
nt|lml: who thinks a heart?|pg||
nt|desinka:  yes|pg||
nt|desinka:  +1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Let me take this opportunity to thanks our splendid VG operator, Pim. Excellent session and we very much appreciate your efforts! |pg||
nt|runnerup: only one left so Sweden seems to be in|pg||
nt|gracelin: north didn't see D8 was played ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: YES the match tightens again|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: maybe I didn't...|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect Wijs can scramble 4 tricks here for 3 IMPs pick-up|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphznv: i do :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would like to see auction after  P-1N[9-12]|pg||
nt|odysseus69: when you have to open 1 heart you hold your breath |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see West opened 1NT next door, with the 4441 shape   |pg||
nt|jbennet: now that would have alerted west not to panic.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C3 attitude   so Muller should know to continue|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphznv: Declarer just layed his cards down claiming 11 |pg||
nt|skaftij:  But Easts "quacks" are after al in PD's suits|pg||
nt|kit: It is possible that East's 3NT call showed some shortness, 4@c asked, and 4@D diamond shortness.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: right about now, in fact|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 30, Lauria in 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|ady: happy A@S with west    split aces  hopefully now|pg||
nt|panosk: just a diamond ruff in dummy needed here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in venice cup   Netherlands over USA1  now +13|pg||
nt|roswolf: too tired still -1 but defence must be accurate|pg||
nt|brgpro: can always get his @cK|pg||
nt|rv: @DQ and @CK in wash?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|udo: @S 3-2,, @H finesse,,all is fine|pg||
nt|udo: no @C ruff|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Kibs tell 5NT pick a slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: well they picked one that makes lol|pg||
nt|skaftij:  this will pull the match like 16-14 in Iceland favour|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a looot of explanation going on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now North is settled after so much talk and is ready to lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nope..cards on the table..... and thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  sry missed that Israel raeched the slam too, I get so many comments, thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: his head is burried inside his palms|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Better than 6NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now...asking more questions|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ....more questions lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: back to thinking ....do not go away|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With bidding like this and pauses like,  everyone is aware that the contact may be touch and go. They hate to give the match away on the penultimate deal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction would be game force by unpassed hand|pg||
nt|skaftij:  HS can organise a ruff|pg||
nt|skaftij:  NS|pg||
nt|ady: can affford the finnesse|pg||
nt|meargent: or some sort of serious slam try|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wild card: now the heart ruff is lost|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H back would have yielded a ruff as well.|pg||
nt|leao:  he has to extract the @d ace b4 pulling trumps|pg||
nt|oosmanb: bath coup'esque |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finaly a spade landed on the table|pg||
pc|hT|nt|wild card: and it's only 300|pg||
nt|boedhy:  his @h are too good so no problems indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: so 4 or 5 to Sweden|pg||
nt|ady: lots of tricks now      4 spades   1 diamond   and  3 clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: now defenders can play 3 round of trump so declarer might need to finesse CQ for a H pitch.  The D8 lost to D10 maybe damaging.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks also to my fellow commentators, Lars and Henry. It was an enjoyable session.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 1@C opening showed 2+, conceivably can have 5 diamonds also if balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice shift|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer cannot pick up QJ8x in North hand, so proper play is ace first.|pg||
nt|meargent: this lead wont brused declarer but the no lead would in 5@Ss|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphznv: this is not good|pg||
nt|lml: that club play is a problem|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer uses the two trump entries to dummy to lead twice towards his club honours.|pg||
nt|gracelin: eclarer needs to finess in club now, or he is down|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure the Italian in other room will make this 4S, so if Shi goes down here, the match is almost even|pg||
nt|gracelin: play and defense are areas that the Italian have a big advantage ove other teams.|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for link to results|pg||
nt|gracelin: they think harder and deeper.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: the other room just started bidding  13|pg||
nt|nkgupt: sud be 2 imps on priv as they r in 2@d|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yuval10: Israel's next match is against Italy, very tough day for them, they've done great so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the 4/1 @H break is just pesky |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so, remove the 2 slam swings and Iceland would have a narrow lead, that's how close it really is|pg||
nt|ady: and 1 heart|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer had 8 of spades, proper safety play would be first round finesse -- whether worth giving up the IMP for that I don't know.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|barnets: Israel have played well in round robin and this is their poorest set shown so far|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is not particularly worried about suffering a club ruff, because he needs to set up the suit anyway, and a ruff may be with a natural trump trick.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: good stuf|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|rv: Italians will be kicking themselves after this segment, they took tough decisions well, 3 huge mistakes on fairly ordinary deals|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|roswolf: but do they think on the right lines?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously  if Bocchi led @SQ  promising King    Madala would have encoraged at trick 1|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|brgpro: still need to guess @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator, Karen. Great Job! Our appreciation to all the organisers for bringing this festival of bridge to our screens. ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Al and Jack for their company and perceptive comments. Also to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.might south ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: finesse the diamond?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't he play @SA first  |pg||
nt|rv: missing Vul game on deal 25 and 2 unnecessary penalties on deals 27 and 28|pg||
nt|rv: sry 28 and 29|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: he still has nine tricks though|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes drijver will probably get a @h trick at the end|pg||
nt|leao:  hell have to time it carefully|pg||
nt|leao:  but miguel is a careful player :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm so sorry   thought Baldursson rebid 3@D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: 1 imps for Italy|pg||
nt|gracelin: good.  Shi also realized that he must take the club finesse to make.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panosk: thinking if he can do anything about possible bad breaks but he cant so here you are|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: and that will be a push|pg||
nt|lml: heading to an uptrick |pg||
nt|ady: decided against   quuen could come down in 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: shortly the last bd  16|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: it appears|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not quite bath coup but he won 2 tricks when he deserved 1 in @S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so should make 7 now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|gracelin: on H return, declarer shud ruff in hand and ruff to establish D|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy from here|pg||
nt|gracelin: and even if he ruffs in dummy, CK will be ruffed out so no problem either. |pg||
pc|c2|nt|bt: eschewing diamonds finesse was a thoughtful play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|skaftij:  On  12, Iceland is in 3NT|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am always happy to add thanks to BBO, for letting us all enjoy these wonderful championships live, at no charge. Long may it last!|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the set...|pg||
nt|athene: south has a pretty nice 12; he might just invite|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N to the bathroom...|pg||
nt|athene: of course if west doubles a 2@H transfer that might alter things|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next session will be at 16.45 hours..|pg||
nt|athene: but they play 2-way stayman over the mini notrump|pg||
nt|athene: and no transfers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N back |pg||
nt|lml: no big deal when you have nine tricks anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Last board now // Hope you all enjoyed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: last board now|pg||
nt|ady: final hand of the session    thx all    thx specs|pg||

nt|panosk: that is our last board for this session|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but it was two WELL DESERVED slam swings :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not "just lucky ones"|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and so the last, and Jan we owe you much for your great skills on vugraph @H|pg||

nt|gracelin: replied|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board - thanks to our operator Vincent - excellent job |pg||
nt|anton72: that one is flat already ..but by the way is verry interesting ...in match NED-USA1 they stay in board 9 from 40 minutes ...mean runing scores ...something unpredictible ...|pg||
nt|anton72: if Vincent can help us ....will be perfect |pg||

nt|ahollan1: final board of the session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: set 5 begins in 55 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: final board of match at our table    3rd/final session of the day scheduled to begin in about 1 hour|pg||
nt|xenya: that's the end for NZ i'm afraid|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the match -- for this table|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  This is the last match today|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director is here to watch time for the last board, but I don't think they will be punished because of the 10 min for the director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: probably both teams will make the last 8 and they deserve it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: may hope is that Australia will make the last 8 as well :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: see previous explanation of 1@D|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems South would have been better placed with a 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks to all the commentators and kibs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|jillan:  any chance 40 imps + can ride on it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: after this match there will be an appeal over a board of the previous set|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now south has the choice of 2@S, weak takeout|pg||
nt|athene: or 2@C "weak stayman"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL = 4 or 5 @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H for e/w looks the spot|pg||
nt|panosk: next match will start in about an hour|pg||
nt|boedhy:  last board|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes all other matches finished|pg||
nt|runnerup: 500 here is good for Nz  but not enougth -ns has to guess well to make any game (3nt)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Thanks Kevin, excellent operator|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks also to Barnet and Kit, my fellow commentators, for their insights into the play.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Weinstein asking about the double|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North asking about the 2c bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but good news is that appeal is moot|pg||
nt|jillan:  which one do you know|pg||
nt|meargent: if north opens they will probably get to 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=11-15 HCP, 6+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D relay|pg||
nt|brgpro: will play 3@c here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|skaftij:  Thank you all kibs for good comments, I was not able to bring all forwards |pg||
nt|ady: thx Harold  and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next match at 13.45 hours|pg||
nt|lml: somebody asked about whether the players know about the running score|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a make n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common treatment over Michaels showing Majors  is to use 2@H/@S to show stronger hands in @C/@D   and 3minor just competitive|pg||
nt|szalay: or: 3m: INV|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@H/2@S: either weaker OR stronger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen that treatment|pg||
nt|szalay: we call it COMB|pg||
nt|ady: thx Geoffrey  and Karen  and all specs  |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i still don't know what board it is about|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 5@h is a decent save against 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S would be a general takeout without spades|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S ..1 off seems coming up :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s = 3@ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s is excatly what he has|pg||
nt|skaftij:  thanks to our magnificent operator|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bob|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last hand of this match. Thanks to our operator Natalia and specs for watching some absorbing bridge.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big win on last board expected for Swedes|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziwny splinter|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwny|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although 5@D can then only 3 imps win|pg||
nt|lechcold: miejmy nadziejê, ¿e nie bêdzie nieporozumienia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or 3nt|pg||
nt|antoniz: 3NT jest dobre|pg||
nt|lml: they dont but they can usually have a feel for how they are doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems flawed in that it gives opponents extra space when cue can be weak|pg||
nt|ady: low heart lead    should hold declarer to 4 tricks if defence is awake|pg||
nt|brgpro: we end up with a quiet game here in @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1-suit, minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 32 boards remain in the Semi Final|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: maybe if he bids 2@S now over 2red from his partner, that is invitational|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT... the 2 lowest suits|pg||
nt|ritong: garbage with 3@ss|pg||
nt|athene: so double isn't just exactly 4 spades, as in standard methods|pg||
nt|ady: got there quickly    nust know I would like a cup of tea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul 1@C includes weak NT as well as some strong hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the day, we restart at 10.30 tomorrow|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This is the fastest session I have ever seen on vugraph|pg||
nt|roswolf: a tricky bd to finish with|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanjks Geoff and Karen.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thx Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks, last board for the day here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@c must show @d and @s|pg||
nt|wild card: Last board of this match. Next round will start at 13:45 local time (in somewhat more than an hour)|pg||
nt|wild card: is that correct Natalia?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Think so.|pg||
nt|yuval10: answer is of course not|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Thanks everyone, and join us for the next segment|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is only 400|pg||
nt|szalay: not true|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thx Geoffrey and Patrick|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We will be back in about 50 minutes, but I don't know which matches will be on|pg||
nt|roswolf: this has been a fascinating fight|pg||
nt|ady: destines for spade game|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@c = unbalanced min|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@c by W( min. 6 @c and no major) will end up the bidding|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: and if he does that north will go to game for sure with a maximum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why East bid 4@H instead of 1@D transfer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry in Polish dzien dobry|pg||
nt|ady: all games failing for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H the best     but fails|pg||
nt|ady: now at  the only making contract |pg||
nt|ady: west considering passing I would think|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to rebid that ht suit, but really no choice|pg||
nt|leao:  4@h?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  dbl from south standard these days |pg||
nt|boedhy:  I think with all the light opening going on you should have more ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ruud was great company, but it is you the spectators who really make it for us, so thanks @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how did that PASS get in there?|pg||
nt|brgpro: there is Rob! |pg||
nt|brgpro: where were u?|pg||
nt|rhelle: quietly watching :) Your comments are much better than mine|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: a steal for Israel here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tough to find the slam|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzienn dobry:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzien:)|pg||
nt|lml: in a match like this it isnt always as clear till you compare|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East almost played @h3|pg||
nt|panosk: vugraph schedule in your own local times http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and there a daring 2nt from west... 3nt from east??|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s lead........???|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play a neg. X quite that lite,     |pg||
nt|leao:  hungry 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: good save 5@D e/w|pg||
nt|ady: may take the push to 5@H|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok looks 9 on top |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so who is to blame?|pg||
nt|ady: because I want my cup of tea|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol ...for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming weat holds weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weat???   that was supposed to be weSt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  13  Levin in 6@S East|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: wow..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that will be worth some imps to usa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that after Stefanov opened 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south stil thinking ...do not go away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from other room  "Eighteen minutes left, TD telling the players to be a bit quicker. Levin: "Good one when I'm in 6@S""|pg||
nt|ady: play of 6@S easier after £@C opening|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: we will restart in 50 mins from now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Daily Bulletin always shows the lineup of vugraph matches for the day   http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Bulletins.asp?redirect=1&|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: please rejoin us for more wonderful matches from veldhoven|pg||
nt|lechcold: po tym wicie nie ma problemu z wygraniem 2@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Drijver and Brink are a great pair and have had an excellent set here|pg||
nt|ady: Italians maybe showed majors on the same auction in west seat|pg||
nt|gracelin: defending 3D is best.|pg||
nt|szalay: 1N looks supersafety to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  in OR, still playing no 30|pg||
nt|skaftij:  possible swing to Italy |pg||
nt|wild card: swift surrender by NS|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@D ³atwo mo¿na po³o¿yæ|pg||
nt|ady: specs suggesting diamond lead  and 4@C is down   but  can still make|pg||
nt|xenya: classic reverse by N on 6-3 |pg||
nt|lml: well he has 7-3|pg||
nt|xenya: tes, 6+|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a @d among the @hs|pg||
nt|xenya: could be just 6 i meant|pg||
nt|xenya: now S has a great hand for partner|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2B-2NT = trnsf; according to CC|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin pointed the finger to the 3s bid and then it gave it a finger down lool|pg||
nt|mdgraham: either the connection is broken or someone is going for a world-record think|pg||
nt|jbennet: he can now bid 3 sp (establishing game force).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ending this roller coaster with a very boring hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: Could make 3NT, 6@D+1@C+2@S=9.|pg||
nt|leao:  it was a very agressive neg x, agree|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think I would lead the @d jack...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink only 7 HCP  but pure fit for partner's majors|pg||
nt|brgpro: what...|pg||
nt|ady: surprise choice|pg||
nt|brgpro: i take back what i said...|pg||
nt|jbennet: which was the normal bid. 3NT was a alfa male bid. |pg||
nt|brgpro: 3nT-1 it looks like|pg||
nt|bobholl: for me too :( @C K wrong :(|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: how do you allocate it?|pg||
nt|lml: we have "both|pg||
nt|lechcold: @CA - lavinthal pikowy i dalej wiadomo|pg||
nt|lml: Weinstein and Levin did well to get to the best slam|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@C is on with A@D right|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and 6NT for same reason|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@c additional chance of ruffing @S good|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it's a good 6@C |pg||
nt|bt: one thing about sloppy play though, its difficult to get back to good bridge|pg||
nt|brolucius: They must play that 2@C promises a major. So, West is able to bid 3@S to show a weak hand and a spade fit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double must be a two-suiter by passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what you wanted to know Anton?|pg||
nt|anton72: result|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a link to the running scores?|pg||
nt|anton72: or whats happened |pg||
nt|anton72: no|pg||
nt|anton72: runing scores stay in board 9 from 40 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ah i see now too, i dont know what happend...|pg||
nt|brgpro: will lead a trump|pg||
nt|brgpro: who wants to bet?|pg||
nt|rv: big thanks to excelllent Vugraph operator Dennis and wonderful co-commentators Jack, Al and all specs for patiently listening to us with insightful comments|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lechcold: a i bez tego nie ma jak tego graæ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes would be beauty @CA x@S @C for down 1|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwne decyzje obu naszych graczy|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie sympatyzujê ze Splinterem z rêk¹ S....kompletnie nie sympatyzujê|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Jassem chyba pomylil sie w systemie|pg||
nt|antoniz: ja te¿ nie|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Martens zrozumial 3@s jako splinter @h|pg||
nt|lechcold: ale mecz przegramy:(|pg||
nt|kamyk: zamiast podsumowania: jak sie tak patrzy na BBO, to sporo widaæ...|pg||
nt|lechcold: by³o kilka naprawdê bardzo ciekawych rozdañ|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jutro przekazy z meczu Polaków o 13.30 i 16:45 - tak jak dzisiaj zapraszam z ca³ej si³y...mo¿e wreszcie zobaczymy prawdziwych polskich husarzy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: o 13.45 :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³uszenia jutro,dobrej nocy:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: o 13:45 dziêkujê Nataly...pewnie nei wiecie ¿e opeartorem jest nasza dziewczyna - Natalia Bana od pewnego czasu mieszkaj¹ca w Holandii|pg||
nt|kamyk: powiem za Wañkowiczem: Dziekujê Uprzejmie, Przybêdê Akuratnie:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: makes this and it finished 40:36 and 16:14 for Israel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 1 down but lets see|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to guage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C lead @C ruff doesn't gain anything|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed you can be too macho|pg||
nt|brgpro: not me!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sorry, played too fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too difficult to find the 50% slam after 2@H raise|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ritong: the light overcall drives to the wrong lead, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't know what 4@c meant, maybe finding best denomination|pg||
nt|ady: what but 1 club and 2 spades   assume Zack will ruff high a 2nd diamond?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thot he might play on hearts which fails|pg||
nt|ady: took the save non vul against vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natural trump trick|pg||
nt|szalay: Aof@s, @hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS got one wrong|pg||
nt|nkgupt: so the first set team orrange doing remarkably well ...extending their lead from 2 to 20|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: and Lindop|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I might also |pg||
nt|boedhy:  dont think he would have led that against 3nt...|pg||
nt|leao:  and that was the 8th trick|pg||
nt|pbundy: hard to decipher the wasted values and lack of fit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: and Baxter|pg||
nt|lml: votes each way|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeli to tak mia³o byæ, to jednak nie bêdê wkuwa³ systemu M-J:)|pg||
nt|lml: I think North might have tried 6@D here|pg||
nt|panosk: our thanks to our very able operator Pim, great job indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: AFR Points: A=3, K=2 and Q=1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: dont need A@D onside for 6@C like I said, @S can be ruffed good with K@H entry. 4@S 6@C 2@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but 6NT does need it so 6@C better|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S has shown 5-3-3-2 and 5 AFR points with the 3nt bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I havent seen an explanation of the 4@d bid|pg||
nt|xenya: let's see how well their relay system will work here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This might be a pickup to Iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: saved by e|pg||
nt|skaftij:  N temted|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tempted|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: north in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, @d King was led|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: probably a double will come after|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @s Ace aganst 4 @h here, if bid would make declarer task more difficult|pg||
nt|ady: this could be a swing for Italy   4@S making|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: for you to bet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next time I bet first:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: yes the 2NT bid was a killer|pg||
nt|lml: I think west is more to blame myself|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what they would have played the double of 2NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: so USA1 will preserve 10 imps over the last board, still 16:14 Israel|pg||
nt|lml: he didnt cuebid over 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: in fact can make setting up spades    just 2 sspade losers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: last board of this match - and tomorrow the Round Robin continues|pg||
nt|skaftij:  nope|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and passes|pg||
nt|anton72: ok ...TY Vincent |pg||
nt|meargent: i wouldnt open that north hand |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: good victory the Netherlands|pg||
nt|skaftij:  420 + 140?|pg||

nt|garden2005: atak atutowy dawa³ jakie nadziej?|pg||
nt|antoniz: kara zlokalizowane|pg||
nt|kamyk: pora na po¿egnania - do lepszych czasów (tylko w naszym bryd¿u, to one ju¿ zdaje siê by³y) |pg||

nt|ryskiel_: dziêkujê wszystkim kibicom, |pg||
nt|jbennet: if p over 3sp had insisted on 3NT, then south could pass.|pg||
nt|rv: thanks to Tez for chipping in with comments as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 13 tricks  so boring but 1 imp|pg||
nt|brgpro: will make 12 here too for a push. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: still lose the @dK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  my eyes blurring|pg||
nt|rv: we watched plenty of drama here|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: next round in 1 hour approx|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think most of us understand this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: A=3point, K=2points Q=1point|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the 4@s bid showed 2K and 1Q |pg||
nt|garden2005: bez pracy nie ma Karolu ko³aczy... tak jest od wieków |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 11-58 is in Vips?|pg||
nt|ady: maybe not after this hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: why Brink chose to X rather than a bit heavy 1@s...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphznv: 4@C fit for at least 1 with good hand |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Jonsson had the chance to defeat, just missed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 30 OR|pg||
nt|ady: good start from north    thats kept it to down 2|pg||
nt|brgpro: will go down 3 here|pg||
nt|meargent: but hard to argue with those that do compared to what is opened these days|pg||
nt|meargent: 5 controls 2 and half quick tricks|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd open as weak NT, but wd pass if strong NT|pg||
nt|jbennet: club lead was perhaps best after all.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: he really has a pretty good playing strength hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: still 6 matches left for the teams to qualify for the quarterfinals|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: top 8 will advance|pg||
nt|ady: I thin might have done better playing diamonds   forcing dummys trumps  to try and nulify the spade suit|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to beat this now|pg||
nt|ady: diamond led would have been better for defence|pg||

nt|antoniz: dziêki za cierpliwoæ, drodzy komentatorzy. Smutne te Mistrzostwa.Niech seniorzy nam je os³odz¹:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: with 6 unavoidable losers, likely -2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 12  and  didn't notice @HQ was missing|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|roswolf: thx all|pg||
nt|gracelin: What a set !, China recovered 50 imps against ITALY to take the lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: tks all and bye|pg||
nt|roswolf: sets up the match nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Bocchi and Madala didn't look worried yet when they saw the score...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Closing down now, see you later|pg||
nt|jbennet: D followed by 3 sp=" I have good hand with spades which is too strong for an overcall"|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: same goes for comments.please calm down.|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes i can see 11 in notrumps -true but 500 will win some imps -|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 25-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump leads beat 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@h was a real pressure bid over the nebulous 1@d|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|meargent: so  would i|pg||
nt|brgpro: but the @C will be discarded first|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: if you play 3@S is not forcing maybe you could but that is hard|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na Ciebie Karopl zawsze mogê liczyæ:) |pg||
nt|ady: so another imp for Italy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|harmon: .|pg||
nt|kamyk: operator by³ nasz¹ siln¹ stron¹ - dziekujemy|pg||
nt|lechcold: vugraf nienaganny:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 14.15.16 all good vps to have :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: both teams need to be steady tomorrow|pg||
nt|ady: Sememta hoping for another slip up to come to 6 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or that @DK offside |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|harmon: Baxter has clear 3h bid competition in spades|pg||
nt|harmon: 3s is forcing|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but there you see even another disadvantage for the double...|pg||
nt|garden2005: dziêkujê równie¿ za wspólne kibicowanie :) do zobaczenia|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Dobrze, ¿e nie zrobili nadróbki...|pg||
nt|kamyk: dziekujê - do nastepnego razu|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: dziekuje i do zobaczenia |pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: NiestetyA: tak, jak to ocenilem: graja rednio, a czasem ... az przykro patrzeæ!|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Do zobaczenia!|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: expect 9 tricks only|pg||
nt|xenya: Match A Open Room will be kept open to announce the quarterfinal pairings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver have been very solid  and when speeding, haven't been caught|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indonesia South (Venice Cup) bid 4@S on the South cards.|pg||
nt|brgpro: on the 4th @s, so 12|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: versace plays the @DQ to make it look as though he has nothing in diamonds in hand|pg||
nt|lml: so a pickup for the usa|pg||
nt|ady: but I dont thinks so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed it was   full credit to Nystrom|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: still, Bocchi-Madala should wander into this game without much trouble|pg||
nt|lechcold: mecz skoñczy siê 16:14 dla nas|pg||
nt|lechcold: wynik chyba lepszy niz gra|pg||
nt|lechcold: i jak na historiê naszych potyczek ze Szwedami  -ca³kiem niez³y|pg||
nt|leao:  hell take his 8 tricks and run|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have link to scores/standings?|pg||
nt|xenya: well done indeed|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Grazie a tutti|pg||
nt|skaftij:  A lot of missed opportunities by Iceland. But the match is far from over yet, still 80 boards to go|pg||
nt|roswolf: nor do i|pg||
nt|ady: has shown too much  |pg||
nt|ady: so 37 imps for Italy half way|pg||
nt|brgpro: -1 but still a loss of 3 imps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: safety play in hearts   make sure not to lose finesse to stiff king|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bye all|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: back in 45 min|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaapfr vg: if squeeze could be 10 or 11|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes -Sweden got that 500 -i see -ok -well done there|pg||
nt|roswolf: still a close match|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thank you all, goodbye|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|nkgupt: for me a ssimple 1@s|pg||
nt|ady: I expect 12 back to Italy|pg||
nt|roswolf: for me too|pg||
nt|brgpro: surprised 11 imps on the last hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: i am sure :(|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes, 12|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|brgpro: thanks en bedankt|pg||
nt|jbennet: that however 3sp would start a coopeation. Whereas a unilateral decision will express his dominance in the flock.|pg||
nt|jbennet: so the 3NT did indeed confirmed his alfa male status.|pg||
nt|jbennet: to the prize of -10-11 IMP:s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: A singleton trump is an unusual lead against a 4-4 fit, so declarer can often make deductions about the unsuitable leads that the defender holds in the other three suits.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North thinking|pg||
nt|meargent: i am sure that hurd in OR will open it |pg||
nt|jbennet: (prevented west from playing low if a club was led from dummy).|pg||
nt|brgpro: i woulda lead a trump for sure...|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes nicely set up for tomorrow|pg||
nt|rv: bye all, see you soon, do come back in 45 mins for exciting 5th segment|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: thru 25   Italy leads China by 26|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that match was close for a long time  and with China ahead or a good chunk|pg||
nt|brgpro: good night and see u tomorrow. thanks guys|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Board 9 corrected|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Bye all|pg||

nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart  1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we'll have different matches in session 2|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Iceland has never lost a BB final  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: better to say they've won all finals they've played?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes, that is what I intended to say|pg||
nt|skaftij:  BD 14 will be a 6 imp pickup for Iceland|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Tarzan playing 2 NT|pg||
nt|skaftij:  God is neither Italian nor Dutch. May the best team win|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sweden leads USA2  by 22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 over Israel by 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy over China by only 34|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so our match biggest difference    go figure|pg||
nt|skaftij:  The carryover comes from NL victory over Iceland|pg||
nt|skaftij:  The argument being that it is the encounter between 2 teams in the end |pg||
nt|skaftij:  that should decide|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Is the a carryover in SF and final as well?|pg||
nt|brgpro: see you|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running scores at  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm  or  www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thanks all see you back in 1 1 /2 hour ca.|pg||
nt|ritong: now he can determine that north has singleton @s|pg||
nt|lml: 10 Imps I think|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|ady: needs low heart|pg||
nt|ady: cant see why Shi blocked the spade suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|udo: but with @c 3-3 , no need to find @S queen|pg||
nt|ritong: with 5@h presumably, 4@ds and 3 @cs if he tests the suit, what he certainly will do|pg||
nt|athene: yes, after he cashes the clubs, the spade guess won't present a problem|pg||
nt|lechcold: B-N zagrali poprawnie na drugim stole|pg||
nt|lechcold: tutaj posz³o ze 30 impów:(|pg||
nt|ady: small win for Israel|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thanks all bye|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so Israel emerge with narrow victory- thx all - I had a lot of help from kibitzers and I needed it badly|pg||

pc|cT|nt|vugraphznv: players thanking each other for the good match|pg||
nt|pbundy: four comparisons to come in now|pg||
nt|pbundy: thanks all - very exciting match!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if USA1 and USA2 both win   they meet in the SemiFinals as part of Conditions of Contest|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i hear the appeal will be about the QJ doubleton lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: USA 2 can only lose 8 imps in the appeal, as they now won 13 imps, but it can be ruled to a +5 imps score|pg||
nt|ahollan1: venice cup  USA1 vs Netherlands   4 boards to score   Netherlands +17|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the semi finals will start tomorrow morning at 10:30 local time (same time as every day)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but tonight we will also broadcast the first 2 rounds of the Transnationals!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they start at 20:30 local time |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but now that the sun is out  some of us will be asleep|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: in 1 hour 45 minutes that is|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: we broadcast rounds 1 and 2, both 10 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tomorrow we will only broadcast the Semi finals, so no Transnationals on BBO|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but when the Transnationals reach the quarter finals we will broadcast those matches as well|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it looks as though USA 1 and USA 2 will go through to the semi-finals. Israel did not play the final set, so USA 1 is through|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: USA 1 and USA 2 have to play each other in the semi finals|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so the Netherlands will face Italy in the other semi finals|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that is, if Italy wins|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphznv: See you all tomorrow |pg||
