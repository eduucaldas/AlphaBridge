nt|westjava: sure, they do it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: note N orths pass- I am sure that most will venture 3H but this is not Israeli style|pg||
nt|odysseus69: best lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: next|pg||
nt|josj: well, 3nt is definitely easier, with the @D behaving...|pg||
nt|sybarra: landed in better spot |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe |pg||
nt|meargent: 2@Hs is conventional|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 2@d was written on paper: limit raise, 4+|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: head on the table....thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i do not think she has higher ambitions than 5d|pg||
nt|odysseus69: is it possible that South has jxx - North does not want to provide entry to dummy so withhods Q righly|pg||
nt|odysseus69: small diamond to 9 is the deep finesse play|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|famus: Barel has no idea--everything works for him--wud b pleasently surprised|pg||
nt|famus: looking at 4 possible losers|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: and they landed in the best spot|pg||

nt|sharkey: Will make - but Indonesia may pick up a couple of IMPs in @H contract|pg||
nt|orentol: yea.. and might know they may miss major fit.|pg||
nt|dburn:  South may find the club ruff hard to believe, of course|pg||
nt|dburn:  and North ought to play the queen of hearts now, not the ace|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi David|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so back to describing the events|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not clear to North how best to continue|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we can see that trump is best but he cant - iiiiiii dont think a club can cost|pg||

nt|meargent: 2@DS was at least a limit raiser|pg||
nt|odysseus69:  eventually he will ruff|pg||
nt|odysseus69: discarding is giving up|pg||
nt|eamongall: I would think that 2@S is rebid is on the low side given its precision but then 1@S only promises 3 card @Ss .. I better look for some convention cards |pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|sharkey: Nice switch from N|pg||
pc|hK|nt|starkist: natural way to guess the @d's at least|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: S has it difficult|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW big club  and many bids value "zz" points  [A=3 K=2 Q=1]  lots of relays|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  fairly vanilla 2/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: imps are converted to VPs [victory points]|pg||
nt|dburn:  since if she leads ace and another, South may try for a heart ruff and not a club ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: so England are in the game with a chance - but the problem is declarer cant get to dummy to take the finesse in @S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: and top 8 teams advance to Knockout Phase|pg||
nt|westjava: freak distribution, interesting play here|pg||
nt|blewah: @d or @h from hand is reasonable|pg||
nt|westjava: other room, Gaviard (S) not to overcall after 1@S|pg||
nt|copeyj: so i think it is down 1 regardless|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed - no real way to do that|pg||
nt|dburn:  but the defenders slightly fortunate that declarer's spades aren't solid|pg||
nt|dburn:  Rimstedt quite right to overtake the queen of hearts - North should have @hAQ doubleton to defend like that|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|meargent: 6@Ds being played by italians in OR|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: looks as if the @d suit comes in in 4@h, so a normal contract turns into a good save|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: USA not X'd in the other room|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|xenya: if you are bidding confidently enough, you have a good chance to push non-vulnerable opponents a bit higher |pg||
nt|yuval10: it's likely that @c's are 2-2 because both defenders were in their hand once and didn't play @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps the only possible case in which it won't apply is when South has A@c singelton, and that's what makes W thinks|pg||
nt|yuval10: if South has the A@c, and he wins and play @d, then declarer has to guess, which of course is not optimal|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps declarer could have done better if he had assured an entry to dummy  |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Barel now sighing and puffing|pg||
nt|alnanda: goedemiddag netherland.. :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: players that fail to qualify will probably play the Transnational Teams but maybe in different partnerships/teams|pg||
nt|blewah: but need a low @c from the table|pg||
nt|blewah: with 54 M she didn't consider it as balance|pg||
nt|westjava: yes she will, 2 entry on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: have to restart again, sry|pg||
nt|orentol: yea reasonable after J @s won and 9 @c ;)|pg||
nt|sharkey: West started the double finesse in @H - shud continue now and not top the suit|pg||

nt|meargent: has i said alot of noise ending in 6@Ds|pg||

pc|c3|nt|barbyh: I think south is pinning his hopes on the club suit coming in|pg||
nt|alnanda: selamat malam Indonesia..|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: unblocing good idea|pg||
pc|d2|nt|josj: making an abundance of tricks now|pg||
nt|meargent: probably get @Ds rgt just to protect @S holding|pg||
nt|meargent: and limiting damage if she is wrong|pg||
nt|meargent: played that way after same lead in OR|pg||
nt|meargent: gordon DONT embaress me|pg||

nt|blewah: difficult hand. could be made though I think of @c was low from the table|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: yes, i loggin in as visible|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: 4h has to be a strong bid at these colors|pg||
nt|garden2005: Kibice*|pg||

nt|dburn:  indeed, and 1NT would be a mini|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|josj: NS also have a good save in 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: the 6d bid probably give you confidence to underleaed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2S now usually balanced with 4S - Wow that was surprise|pg||
nt|odysseus69: think he was taking advance sacrifice but North may expect a lot more- but the colours may be a clue|pg||

mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: This is plain silly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not in this match  -- identical auctions both tables|pg||
nt|joanem: no support X i guess|pg||

nt|joanem: denies 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL gets the nod because 4@H and only doubleton @S   @SAxx and 4@H  would probably bid 3N since able to duck @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both lead @SQ  but would be interesting to examine play after @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting if done by someone else:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller could bid 2@C to show loing @D -- but needed [at least] another King |pg||

nt|vugraphznz: probably a good board for france|pg||
nt|josj: over 5@D, W could no longer make the 5@C fitbid to solve East's problems...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably win here to prevent @C shift  or early @H guess but duck seems to have merit too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I assumed 4S from South|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: sorry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no problem|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the 4S bid was so ncharacteristic that I almost fell off my chair|pg||

mb|p|nt|meargent: @HQ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: tough hand to lead from for Smith|pg||
nt|copeyj: but this is a very ambitious game, which should go down with 3@S and 1@D to lose, but stranger things have happened|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: à 3SA on ne peut pas à la fois affranchir les @c et encaisser les @d, faute de communication|pg||
nt|dburn:  good lead, but West has to put in the nine to make sure of an entry - that is, unless declarer puts in the jack to kill it|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: would love to finesse in @D [trusting @DJ to be honest]  but transportation is bad without peeking for location of @HA|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: the hand is much easier seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is the downside of using double dummy software like GIB or Deep Finesse|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|grebrof: yeah - I expected Sweden to lead - lol|pg||
nt|grebrof: anyway - we like tight matches|pg||
nt|mug: we all do except the players|pg||
nt|mug: Dhondy will continue to 3@H, she might have bid at the 3-level the previous turn|pg||
nt|grebrof: commentating the last 16 boards where one team leads by 100imps isnt that exciting, no|pg||
nt|mug: you get more exciting psyches|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, as she already has shown a good lift in @hs, I think bidding 3 the first time is overruling P a bit|pg||
nt|mug: not really, partner just said she thought no game, she didn't say don't compete |pg||

pc|d6|pc|s4|pc|c2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mug: it made next door|pg||
nt|grebrof: it is possible - ruff @h @s A - @d and @h ruffs |pg||
nt|mug: when North ruffed in twice, Sally Brock overruffed and set up spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|mug: but if North doesn't ruff in, there's a danger of a cross-ruff|pg||

nt|ritong: j ai naivement imaginé que levin dirait 3SA|pg||
nt|eamongall: some red suit work required to bring home 4@S here if they bid it |pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: i believe the other dutch pairs play Raptor NT overcalls  so North will bid 1N to show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doubt it will make any difference in final contract/result|pg||
nt|reisig: Not the toughest hand to play |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H or pass?|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@S block I think|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, must be weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|joanem:  better to show your 4 card suit and play the 5/2 |pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphznz: coffee hand ?|pg||
nt|josj: even better would be 1 top trumps and then @S|pg||
nt|fokal: this may make|pg||
nt|joanem: oops she has not |pg||
nt|mamos: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: The play might be interesting if they reach 3NT|pg||
nt|blewah: cue is used for limt raise+, usually in modern bridge|pg||
nt|starkist: did sharyn really get out the jack of @d?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: previous board, @h 6|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: was the lead|pg||
nt|alunand14: yes, standard and weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: w 18 sorry:(|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: juz powinno byc dobrze|pg||
nt|josj: and it may go down|pg||
nt|fokal: because of the @h suit |pg||
nt|fokal: but has to guess corrcty in @d|pg||
nt|josj: E will duck the @DA and create a little problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: loose 1h,1d and 1c...|pg||
nt|fokal: and not start with @c|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: yes true|pg||
nt|fokal: tough board|pg||
nt|josj: hi Olivier, welcome to join into the commentary :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: my bet is on Willard... she will make this|pg||
nt|josj: I tend to agree...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the minor suit 10s and the weak hearts suggest a pass of 1NT|pg||
nt|joanem: now they will have a bad time in the 43 breaking 42 |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this can be a swing board|pg||
nt|meargent: and it aint 4th best|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: N is not sure|pg||
nt|meargent: well i am|pg||
nt|ritong: peut être ont elles une réponse pour les deux majeures|pg||
nt|eamongall: but stockdale is in there advertising her wares ...understandably |pg||
nt|eamongall: so declarer should be ok .. |pg||
nt|sharkey: As we see 3 NT makes - opportunity for the Americans next door|pg||
nt|sharkey: Vul games shud be bid if the chance of success is 37% according to the math gurus - this hand may fit in|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Lall's fit showing jump shut out the @S in the other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here GeO remains silent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also 3N east  after 1@S open with Fredin passing 1st round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HT falling means 2nd stopper in the suit -- and natural attack of @C kills entry to long @H|pg||
nt|joanem: 2s much easier |pg||
nt|joanem: and jill lead |pg||
nt|odysseus69: but 2S also down|pg||
nt|ritong: et dans ce cas levin aurait opté pour 4@s, sûre d un doubleton en face|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D denies 3 hearts (else Support Dbl), hence alert (I think)|pg||

nt|ritong: mais ces sophistications ne sont plus tellement d actualité|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: yes 2@D denied a 3 card @H|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Vincent|pg||
nt|odysseus69: assume he has shown heart shortage so West has nothing wasted although only 12 points|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: only need to find the killing defense|pg||
nt|jbgood: i am told it is not difficult - but i would also say it is not difficult to bid something with GeO's hand - and he didnt:)|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi Barbara-wlc:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not so good if West had 642 of spades and J1065 of hearts- the toy worked but I am not convinced|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: nice shift|pg||
nt|alunand14: we watching the match between England (rank 1) with Indonesia (rank 4)....|pg||
nt|mamos: this might all depend on Spades|pg||
nt|copeyj: Rimstedt smelt this one out - and this is going to be uncomfortable for brock|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: just saw this one go down    Pakistan North got diamond lead   and played spade to the king and trick 2  and conceeded 2nd spade tricke and spade ruff and K@H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: de nos jours, on dit 1SA 3SA dans les deux salles et on laisse les défenseurs se débrouiller|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D is easy , but 3NT on a @h lead looks hard-to-analyse - should make 3NT maybe?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|edou2704:  3@d is making so 3@h should be a good save if north can find the right @c play|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: ah the defence can get a Diamond ruff now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphznz: nice start|pg||
nt|josj: first hurdle surmounted|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: this looks safer   though a club is a little worry|pg||
nt|ady: if North plays the ace and draws last trump   and plays a spade  and plays the 9  and east has the queden  then a 2nd club would defeat the contract|pg||
nt|starkist: say it pepe|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: now they made up some time, easy board|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: Inm 3NT - win @HA then spade to nine or ace - develop a 9th trick in spades while @DA is in dummy as access to long spade|pg||

nt|chmitty: les Françaises sont à 4@s sur entame @d ... 11 levées probables donc|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|drorp: seems like only shot for south is to hope parnter has J@D, i dont really know why he's still thinking... anywyaz chagas will have to unblock (which isn't that hard either)|pg||
nt|mamos: well he can see Qx|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe easier now after the lead of the K|pg||

nt|odysseus69: all well asards lie but 4-1 trumps would have been too much to handle|pg||
nt|odysseus69: king of spades and all well-club to hand and concede spade|pg||
nt|sharkey: S showed and invitational hand OR but N didnt accept the invitation so likely a push|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mamos: easy for declarer now|pg||
nt|copeyj: oh my - can make this now i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: North would have been better of pitching|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|grebrof: but ok - it should be easy and it was|pg||
nt|drorp: unblocking in the 1st trick is good techqnique, if you gonna unblock better do it 1st trick possible, just to make it easier on partner|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: careful now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't be surprised if 2@H IS the winner in long run|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=PUP 3@C  a) weak @C/@D  b) @D, some shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: plusieurs options pour joanna|pg||
nt|ritong: contre, 3@s, 3@c|pg||

nt|chmitty: 4@c pardon|pg||
nt|chmitty: et on laisse jouer 4@s du coup|pg||
nt|ritong: c est ballot|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT - prev board - running off all the @D's looks best then --- W keeps Jxx, Qx void, Jx and has one discard to make, but discards after S who has a problem|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 4S cheap|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cheap save against slam- at vulnerability maybe West should join in over 1D|pg||
nt|petergill: or could simply play N for @C10, that's easy looking at 52 cards|pg||

nt|odysseus69: the response of 4H not alerted - can you explain Joan|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has something gone wrong?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin looks puzzled by the 4d bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 5d bid sorry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks as if North showed 1 key card by mistake|pg||
nt|joanem: cue of hearts |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if 4C was key card North may reaiise she gave wrong response and bid 6C now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin stil thinking|pg||
nt|joanem: levin very worried about spades as no cue there?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no sac |pg||
nt|chmitty: Espérons que Levin entame @c pour nous laisser une chance|pg||
nt|chmitty: mais je n'y crois pas|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 4 in 3NT - S can keep K10x, KJ, void, Ax, so perhaps randomly trying to guess @C10 early is the best way to go |pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: thanks :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it also allows NS to get into the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here  Muller doesn't have any help from NS  so has to guess @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: Palmer may play ace of hts and a ht,   to hold down ruffs?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|garden2005: ta uwaga o b³êdzie w ustawieniu pochodzi³a od rosenknoppa :) brawo za czujnosc|pg||
nt|joanem: yep eek |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin passed and said I do not know..|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: both sides of the screen discussing the 4c bid lol|pg||
nt|starkist: 6 on a guess|pg||
pc|c8|nt|odysseus69: 2D seems to have worked - North didnt have enough for 2H but maybe after 3C -p-p 3H is possible|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@h was possible as dealer|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|petergill: Welcome to Wayne Stuart|pg||
nt|barbyh: a nice surprise when the heart king is onside|pg||
nt|meargent: 6@Ds is quite a good contract|pg||
nt|chmitty: I'm asked what écarry over" means : it means that at the start of this match, there is already a small dscore, coming from the results between both teams|pg||
nt|chmitty: when they met in the eliminatories|pg||
nt|chmitty: "carry over" sry|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud N have raised after pd willing to play 1 NT xx?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|drorp: not easy decision for Amaral, and he gives a lot of credit to the vul overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: hate 5@c there - seems better to bid 4@c the previous round  Job done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer will probably try to find @S10 doubleton somewhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real way to force defense to break @S or @D   [frozen suits]|pg||
nt|meargent: not such a good line if @Ss ly badly|pg||
nt|meargent: should play @S NOW|pg||
nt|sybarra: but it ace of sp with W,  now would have to deal with @D ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: and a club loser   |pg||
nt|sybarra: that was but if, spade ace|pg||
nt|meargent: she is probably DOOMED then in any case|pg||
nt|meargent: if east has 3@Hs |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: N asking about signals|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: shaking her head now|pg||
nt|meargent: in OR north bid a direct 4@Hs over 3@Ss and US got to 8@Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and S is reading the bulletin|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess the ace of sp has to be with E, given the opening |pg||
nt|meargent: ace and @H will work but i dont thinck its best|pg||
nt|chmitty: on peut gagner à cartes ouvertes je crois|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lechcold: tu te¿ jest szansa na punkty... w kiery na WE mo¿na sporo ugraæ|pg||
nt|ritong: c est en tout cas ce que dit GiB|pg||
nt|starkist: virtually cold on non@h lead|pg||
nt|meargent: but 5@Ds is better than 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: netherlands open went 1 down in 6@d|pg||
pc|sK|nt|josj: best defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: live results under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|joanem: i think jill L thought that 5d was cue agreeing clubs denying 1st or 2nd round control of spades - so passed 5d|pg||
nt|lechcold: Murniatinie zaryzykowa³a wejcia 1@D,ciekawe...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a ile Lechu?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|drorp: double dummy this contract makes, double finessing the JT of hearts, and chagas might actually make it if he can place Gino with the A@C from the quick double on 5@C|pg||
nt|grebrof: Israel is unbeaten so far - 16, 25 and 15, while Brasil have scored 18, 14 and 20 |pg||
nt|drorp: sorry 1 off double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: south passed twice|pg||
nt|meargent: but then again i am a lousy declarer|pg||
nt|starkist: 1n opening with east hand other table , you approve pepe?|pg||
nt|meargent: not really|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fokal: probably counting on 3 @h tricks with the finesse|pg||
nt|lechcold: na drugim stole 2N i wist kierowy. Jest szansa na pierwsze punkty|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|josj: the @C shift|pg||
nt|blewah: 9 now|pg||
nt|westjava: you see, how lady find a lady...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphznz: welcome back all |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: play was very slow until now, so we did not miss many boards|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it is a recurring event- players give wrong response to keycard - dont know why |pg||
nt|lechcold: to zale¿y od wistu i rozgrywki:) po walecie karo na przyk³ad to hoho...|pg||
nt|blewah: it's women's business|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: good|pg||
nt|xenya: so 11 tricks coming|pg||
nt|drorp: 5@C is a big gamble that they make 4@S when u have 2 sure defensive tricks, unless he actually thought he can make 5@C|pg||
nt|starkist: @d's too meaty and prime|pg||
nt|meargent: too good for weak nt |pg||
nt|starkist: that too|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that also lets you see result from ALL tables of any given hand|pg||
nt|ritong: ça joue toujours|pg||
pc|cK|nt|westjava: I always wrong|pg||
nt|copeyj: This is a pretty good game - wonder if Dhondy-Senior have some methods to get to it next door|pg||
pc|d5|nt|odysseus69: 4H virtually laydown but somehow both rooms cant get there- difficult- both North and South dislike their diamond holding but  it is a perfect marriage|pg||
nt|eamongall: I see about 5 more tricks for NS|pg||
nt|eamongall: thats 7 in total and 3 down ... and 200  from their team mates |pg||
nt|sharkey: Is this the first time the Indonesian Ladies Team have advanced this far in Benice Cup Hendra?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: it seems a bit umnlikely to make after Pass by dealer|pg||
nt|fokal: she will still make 3 @h tricks, but not for that reason :)|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|westjava: how about lady of diamond, let's see|pg||
nt|starkist: I only like my steak meaty and prime|pg||
nt|meargent: good enough for strong nt but it does seem to me a bit of a shot|pg||
nt|edou2704:  the result from round robin is partially keeped|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jbgood: another gain for NZ - should be 6 imps|pg||
nt|meargent: and beth palmer is a world champion|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are not exactly a slouch Mr.. Silver |pg||
nt|meargent: not as a declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well just arrange the auction so that pard plays all the tough hands |pg||
nt|meargent: thats always my hope|pg||
nt|sharkey: *Venice|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chmitty: il aurait fallu jouer @h et @h en défaussant son @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: mais c'est jouer spécifiquement les atouts 41 et les @h 22|pg||
nt|ritong: joanna joue simplement pour l as de @s placé et les atouts ronds|pg||
nt|ritong: maintenant, si levin ne prend pas, elle aura des éléments de table|pg||
nt|chmitty: Levin va prendre et jouer @d c'est certain|pg||
nt|ritong: et de toute façon, si levin ducke, c est fini|pg||
nt|ritong: et elle le sait|pg||
pc|h3|nt|alunand14: yes....before only rank 9 :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: impressive feat|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: Lindop led @S so that gave declarer  10|pg||
nt|lokaty: na pewno dziwi brak wejcia 1@D po treflu, pewnie maj¹ jak¹ konwencjê|pg||
nt|edou2704:  if winning team from this match finished before the other, they have a 50% carry over|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: back in the tank now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: she closed the screen asking about the count|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right Rich- I failed to spot the pass|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: 66 teams all playing same board  makes for great comparisons|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: if south doesn't have the @sJ he might now underlead the Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CJ to show more points and maybe get Muller to place @SA in north??|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: in fear of giving 2 discards on @c if declarer had @c KQT|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d a indiqué un fit franc, trois cartes a @s|pg||
nt|chmitty: on ne peut plus que défausser pour ne chuter que d'une|pg||
nt|chmitty: double mauvais coup Français : le par était à 6@d contrés deux de chute|pg||
nt|ritong: joanna a du mal a se résoudre à chuter|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: unless declarer gors fot ultra safety -- which he did|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@H is a sensible spot to be - you don't want to be in 6@H on a finesse when 650/680 might pick up imps if 500 or 300 happens at other table|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: mais..|pg||
nt|edou2704:  if they lost, there is a 33% carry over|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 4th match (the internetsite is finally up again), Israel scored 22 and Brasil 25, so both these teams have started off very well|pg||
nt|drorp: heading towards 2 off now, had to play a heart, now he won't have 2 entries anymore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cullin just convincing himself that nothing can go wrong with @D play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: should have gone with gut|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but this still works when Upmark exits @DA|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Italy gains 10 IMPS back with avoiding a chanceless 3NT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|blewah: safer route for overtrick|pg||
pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: then 2H OK over 2D too|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: rightly perhaps|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: now forced to play Nabil for @SJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the longer he thinks, the more convinced Muller will be|pg||
pc|d7|nt|westjava: yup|pg||
pc|h6|nt|drorp: and in the 5th Israel tied while Brazil scored 18, it's a clash between 3rd and 4th places|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|grebrof: Israel in 2nd and Brasil at 4th|pg||
nt|reisig: Right..already limited|pg||
nt|copeyj: England gained 15 imps on the last board... Sweden went down 2 in 5@CX|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: Beth pressing it here |pg||
pc|hA|nt|meargent: and 8 imps to USA :(|pg||

nt|ritong: enfin, pas tout de suite|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=@S + @C/@D|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 3H from North now standard |pg||
nt|sybarra: and an easy 3 nt here ++2|pg||
nt|meargent: the trick here is to avoid slam|pg||
nt|westjava: 10 or 11 tricks, aria?|pg||
nt|westjava: or to Felipe?|pg||
nt|blewah: i think it was 11|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will north join in?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: IF you agree to play the convention with your partner -- make sure you know if 4minor bid is forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: muller has a good hand now with 2 aces, 4 trumps and a singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: though he would prefer to have more high card points in the red suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in the other room  elAhmady running trump interesting squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and LOTS of pressure on defenders to discard properly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump to 6@D very reasonable here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know if there is any scientific way to investigate staying lower or getting higher|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: but with the hearts the way they are, even 5@d is a difficult contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4333 in N, not source of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think I remember n/s can open some wild nt bids |pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|meargent: hopefully for NS they wont find their @D fit|pg||
nt|chmitty: c'était très dur de passer 5@h pour Joanna : en disant 5@h Sud indique seulement son envie de jouer au palier de 5|pg||

nt|petergill: Back on Bd 4 in 3NT - in the 6 card ending, S has to pitch something - @HJ looks like the only chance, now declarer exits in @C and the defence is awkwardly placed. Sp perhaps no ...|pg||
nt|petergill: need to guess @C10 in 3NT on Bd 4|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT weak |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C both majors|pg||

nt|drorp: other table bidding started with north opening and then rebidding clubs, so this result might be duplicated, but i didn't see how the bidding ended|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@S=slam interest @H  and 5@C=slam interest @D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the double pprobably was 4 or more spades where 1S would deny 4|pg||

nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
nt|meargent: from my point of view this is more than decent if NS bid it|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 sp squeaks home|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphznz: 4h did not make at the other table....so another big chunk of imps for france|pg||
nt|josj: they were in 2nt...:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: loool... i see now|pg||
nt|lokaty: treflowy tylko k³ad³ chyba|pg||
nt|lokaty: 3@S da³ Burek, bo graj¹ 1 NT 14-16|pg||
nt|joanem: but having an 8 card beautiful diamond suit is sad to be raising clubs on 3 small  |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this link seems to work: http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live/scorebord-venice-cup|pg||
nt|mamos: not much to be said about this either|pg||
nt|petergill: Geo Tislevoll moved from Norway to Auckland New Zealand when he married Faith Mayer who lives in NZ but she sometimes play s bridge for her country of origin Philippines|pg||
nt|chmitty: not so easy to grab 9 tricks anyhow|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: 4@C=relay   4@S=3zz  4630|pg||
nt|odysseus69: many still play that 1S promises 5 and double is no more than 4 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly this pair is not afraid to bid 'em |pg||
nt|meargent: EW will have to try really hard to let this one through and i for one dont think they can do it|pg||
nt|chmitty: Bénédicte a chuté 4@c|pg||
nt|chmitty: sans doute sur le flanc AR de @h suivi de petit @s ... elle a mal deviné|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont like 3S bid|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like a gazilli auction to me...2@c=enq and 2@d is 8+  says Gad viren169 |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so they're already doing better than the Canadian EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H played by West    so there is risk of @S ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ZZ   simply  A=3 K=2 Q=1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with trump lead can still make 12 tricks by guessing south singleton trump and ruffing finesses in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that reasonable play when contract is 5@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady still playing   21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rare situation having Muller table faster than other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D was pushed  so only imps from 1st board of the set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and potential swing here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened south hand 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: many pairs playing 4@h on this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a number of pairs play "leaping Michaels" over 3-level preempts too|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: probably not being able to show a 2-suiter over a 3@s-opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: including Sadek who alerted his 4@D overcall :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady bid 4@S and Brink 5@C!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Sweden bid the slam so 13 imps in the bag|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to wróc¹ p[iechot¹ wczeniej...i by³oby to jak najbardziej s³uszne|pg||
nt|chmitty: double dummy you do of course, but Bénédicte is not (yet) a magician|pg||
nt|chmitty: for instance is South plays another @s you must play @h to the 9, than the K from your hand ..etc..|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lechcold: szlemik treflowy, doæ kiepski|pg||
nt|westjava: decl will go home with this lead|pg||
nt|meargent: i like this result from OR better than the last one|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphznz: a lot of tricks now|pg||
nt|eamongall: I got a txt message the other day from a pard and he says PD sees lots of gazilli in Bermuda Bowl ... that means more updates in my bidding sys  is coming |pg||
nt|viren169: Hi all...|pg||
nt|eamongall: good good |pg||
nt|viren169: This does look like a simple Gazilli auction... and yes a lot of partnerships are playing it now...|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e kto wie jak jest po japoñsku "wszystko jedno"?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the story i heard   the original notes used ZZ as place holder  but so many people saw draft it was too late to come up with better name|pg||
nt|joanem: good lead - may have to take heart finesse now - that works too |pg||
nt|lechcold: sam impas kier jeszcze nie robi gry|pg||

nt|chmitty: just a little help from my friends :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: maybe @S was for @C's|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: @S7|pg||
nt|chmitty: maybe ... but you can't do all with one card : give count and give a preference signal as well|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: right...|pg||
nt|chmitty: id dummy as a singleton @s then preference is the priority|pg||
nt|chmitty: here ot's not so clear|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lechcold: niestety 2BA wypuszczone w  55|pg||
nt|joanem: hard to get to that dummy of course |pg||
pc|c2|nt|lechcold:  5|pg||
nt|reisig: That @c 2 = underlead the @d or a fring squad with be here:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: now some relay systems refer to AKQ points or just 321|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does cullin run?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  missed that auction was over|pg||
nt|pawel90: po pikowym te¿ mo¿na próbowaæ wyrzucaæ trefla na kiera... i traci siê tempo.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west obeys|pg||
nt|sharkey: Could make 5 here|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: south africa made 6@d on a @d-lead|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a nie lepiej by³o napocz¹æ dam¹ pik - partner z 10-k¹ by zachêci³|pg||
nt|viren169: Within 5-10y most serious Partnerships will have it in thier kit-bag.|pg||
nt|eamongall: I have a vague memory that some of Gazilli ...is linked to Benito Garrozo |pg||
nt|eamongall: let me google |pg||
nt|viren169: Yes... Invented by the Italians... adopted by the yanks!|pg||
nt|viren169: Can I say yanks?|pg||
nt|viren169: England off to a great start this morning...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|drorp: Israel defended and doubeled in both rooms on board 21, setting by 2 tricks both contracts, for a 13 imp swing|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: this will be discussed in the postmortem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: impressive|pg||
nt|petergill: 23-0 now because |pg||
nt|westjava: @HQ to pitch @D loser|pg||
nt|eamongall: A complex method of rebidding after a major opening and forcing 1 no trump response|pg||
pc|dT|nt|meargent: however gordons lead shouldnt bruse declarer|pg||
nt|eamongall: you just did ...so guess its ok |pg||
nt|viren169: Can be played without the forcing NT....|pg||
nt|viren169: Anyone interested... send me an email and I will forward it on to them... |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also stops in 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: to see the results of a board you can go to the running scores and then click a match|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: then select the board number and it will show all the results of that board|pg||
nt|joanem: there now |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: sorry missed the trump play :(|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but 4C  allows to check on club honours - always going to play in diamonds |pg||
nt|meargent: i predict new leaders:(|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|chmitty: good start|pg||
nt|chmitty: now she has to guess whether the @h 8 is "sincere" (from J8) or not (from J87)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: on Bd 4, Peter Newell received a friendly @s lead to queen and ace in 3NT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s4|nt|xenya: now he will just take his 7 tricks, losing 1 imp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but easy to understand Cullin being worried about 12 tricks in 6N|pg||
nt|blewah: 1@d will disappear with @h |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @D9 will take a trick|pg||
nt|joanem: oh ok |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: sorry imissed play...i will claim at the end|pg||
nt|joanem: ran 2nd trump to dummy;s 9 |pg||
nt|joanem: then heart finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the answer should be 8 tricks unless declarer makes 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69:  2 down|pg||
nt|sharkey: From East's point of view the void in pd's suit a negative - turns out nothing wasted in @S and the hands fit nicely|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kamyk: Polska czeka, my czekamy na zdobycie pierwszej bramy|pg||
nt|starkist: well...|pg||
nt|starkist: drum roll...|pg||
nt|starkist: decl blocked @c's|pg||

nt|ahollan1: give North the @S10|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|grebrof: Italy 111 - Netherlands 102 - Brazil 95 - Israel 92 - Poland 90 - Usa 2 86 - Sweden (jippi!) 85 and Bulgaria 70.5 in the bracket for the playoffs so far - but its a long way to go ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: still :)|pg||
nt|meargent: excuse me :)|pg||
nt|blewah: unlucky lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|meargent: hard for NS to avoid endplay later in hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|drorp: 2@H here is headed towards making|pg||
nt|pawel90: Nie jestem pewien, czy to 2BA by³o puszczone. W nie ma co wyrzucaæ do kar, a potem chyba musi znaleæ siê na wpucie|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah, who know about the lead|pg||
nt|eamongall: I was directing a bridge competition on Saturday and as I passed one table I heard the 4 folk discussing deeply  the fact that a few tables up was a nun playing bridge |pg||
nt|eamongall: I stopped and said ... the lady up there in the black ... has 2 arms 2 ears a brain and two eyes same as you 4 ...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: he might exit with a @D though|pg||

nt|ritong: pierre?|pg||
nt|edou2704:  yes,  a good double partscore for france|pg||
nt|viren169: another swingy hand here...|pg||

nt|viren169: will be more careful over 2N...|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: now only thought south has is weather we play 6 or 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D would show unbalanced hand  and 1N needs good 12   so deWijs had to PASS|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: running scores can be found here: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably the only pair playing a Big Club that does pass West hand|pg||
nt|joanem: a 2 over 1 sequence coming up |pg||
nt|meargent: EW play the weak NT  thus the 1@C opening|pg||
nt|blewah: multi 2@d|pg||

nt|viren169: 3@S will be enough at red...|pg||

nt|sharkey: What will West do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: 3@H presumably natural with extras|pg||

nt|viren169: dble=t/out or penalties?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: and B/wood should solve his problem then|pg||

nt|chmitty: the French stopped at a safe level on this board|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pawel90: Martens chyba mia³ 2 szanse na wyjcie w trefla nawet|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@h was ready to be passed out if it were S's suit. but Bojoh shot the star after knowing it was @s|pg||
nt|viren169: and now 4@H...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Very diificult reach slam after preempt by S|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and easy 3NT the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Meyers did not alert 3nt but Levin did|pg||
nt|joanem: jill l did not want to rebid the 6 card poor diamond suit - so 2n is better option |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and an unexpected (to me) alert|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i did not notice if she alerted 2nt bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT must be showing some extras but North sure to pass|pg||
nt|petergill: With @H 5-1, 6@H is doomed and 6@C looks best - hard to reach 6@C if S rebids 2@D and clubs becomes the 4th suit in the auction|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@S was enough I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Brown explained double as take-out|pg||
nt|viren169: still a few back to Sweden (I guess)|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like take out ...but when pard advertising 21 hcp approx can be penalty|pg||
nt|copeyj: well this is not going to make very many tricks, it would appear|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: or cue bids |pg||
nt|josj: even we have here...|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS playing mini-multi aka Wagner   i.e. always weak 2Major  no strong options|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: W: My bid shld have been double|pg||
nt|meargent: east= the ex sharyn kokish|pg||
nt|chmitty: il faudra laminer Inde et Trinidad ... et serrer le jeu contre l'Indonésie|pg||
nt|chmitty: une équipe qui joue très très correctement et est en passe de se qualifier|pg||
nt|petergill: but fortunately South rebid 2@C so they are on their way to 6@C|pg||
nt|blewah: previous board. the same 4@s contract but Neve in N led @c5|pg||
nt|blewah: in the other room|pg||
nt|westjava: very nice lead|pg||
nt|meargent: yes she did|pg||
nt|starkist: can duck 1 @h|pg||
nt|edou2704:  in some matches the score is already significant, nederlans is leading by 80 against iceland in BB|pg||
nt|chmitty: I bet a certain % of pairs would play at the 5 or 6 level with these cards, even in a strong field|pg||
nt|viren169: 3 schools of thought here... some play it as t/out and some play it as penalties... and the rest haven't discussed it!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|drorp: yep, as much as a slam hand can be boring, this one is quite boring|pg||

nt|petergill: The 23-0 scoreline looks like a typical All Blacks Rugby Union scoreline|pg||

nt|dburn:  whcih way?|pg||

nt|odysseus69: I was remembering Rolands instruction not to be too critical|pg||

nt|ritong: t as rien, ma fille|pg||
nt|ritong: dis 5@d paisiblement|pg||
nt|copeyj: can be down 6 now but they would have to defend well|pg||
nt|copeyj: would be a funny flat board - 3N tick and 1@D down 6|pg||
nt|dburn:  no way for Smith to tell who has the last diamond|pg||
nt|copeyj: they are in 2@D next door|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: pleasant little hand with @H's 2/1  and @D ace on side etc |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant @H's 2/2 |pg||
nt|meargent: not to mention the 32 @C break|pg||
nt|westjava: to avoid dummy entry|pg||
nt|edou2704:  4NT seems to be the limit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mamos: do we know what 2NT showed |pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like good bidding to me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: south opened 1@D showing @H and thus they dived over 4S, here NS silent|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||

nt|odysseus69: I just noticed that bidding has continued- well South has great controls - the problem is that North does not have enough  for his bidding|pg||
nt|eamongall: so a hesitation double is penalties :) |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bouncer: nice|pg||
nt|petergill: True, you need a 12th trick, so the play of 6@c will be interesting|pg||
nt|wstuart: They should be OK in 6@C; draw trumps, one @h goes on the @SA, and ruff teh 4th @D.|pg||
nt|petergill: Do you rely on @H 4-2 or do you ruff two spades in S hand, keeping @SA to control the suit? |pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I miscounted, there are 12 easy tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT 1430 |pg||

nt|reisig: Next|pg||
nt|copeyj: but not any more|pg||
nt|dburn:  perhaps not|pg||
nt|copeyj: England gained 8 on b22 when Sweden tried 3N next door which went down 2|pg||
nt|dburn:  declarer can guess hearts now for down three, but England will pick up 5 IMPs at least|pg||
nt|dburn:  unless declarer doesn't play anything at all, of course, which may restrict the loss to the 3 IMP slow play penalty|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: the American EW have overbid slightly there|pg||
nt|jbgood: *told|pg||
nt|starkist: ohhhhh|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North realised he had done too much and baled out in time|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yuval10: they never overbid, overbid was if they bid slam here :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's their style to push for a marginal games|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can ruff with A|pg||
nt|odysseus69: those who laugh at 4 card major systems should always watch where partner cant support clubs|pg||

nt|eok: see my email?|pg||
nt|barbyh: north has to decide whether west has 6 or 7 clubs|pg||

nt|petergill: even if there is a spade switch at Trick 3|pg||
nt|petergill: as is likely with E being almost entryless|pg||

nt|mug: better for us than when every other hand is 1NT +1 |pg||
nt|grebrof: in BB Israel threw the towel in before the last segment - 123imps behind USA1|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|mug: but I think there are plenty of keen statisticians out there who would pounce if the dealing was irregular over a significant number of sessions |pg||

nt|edou2704:  unfortunately a little too high|pg||
nt|viren169: A thin 4@H here for E/W|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|meargent: but in fairness 1@C opened in that room|pg||
nt|blewah: hi Lontoh|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@D spot, usually with 7 cards|pg||
nt|meargent: maybe look for 7 first but raise i do|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: ciekawy kontrakt by³ hgrany w otwartym - 1 txx to ostatnio mia³em w Jury d  Apell|pg||
nt|davidstern: 8 boards in 85 minutes yep that is slow|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 1@s probably showing an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|xenya: hopefully we'll  see it also :) |pg||
nt|josj: if you treat it like a coffee hand, you will go down:)|pg||
nt|joanem: hope u dont; mean they have less to think about !!!|pg||

nt|meargent: 2@DS shows the red suits|pg||
nt|odysseus69: east wants to bid- i dont think he should|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: how many spades from East? - 3 looks right|pg||

nt|viren169: if they (can) get into the auction!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i thought McAvoy might open 2@D|pg||

nt|lontoh 63: vampires coming .... need something for dinner|pg||

nt|viren169: nicely done by N/W to keep the opps out!|pg||
nt|viren169: -2 here and back in the lead!|pg||
nt|eamongall: However we must remember we are sitting here seeing 4 hands and with no table pressure |pg||
nt|viren169: interesting lead|pg||
nt|eamongall: players only see 1 when bidding and 2 when defending/declaring |pg||
mb|4S|nt|odysseus69: good decision from West|pg||
nt|jkotor: jak bycie to grali?|pg||
nt|meargent: and reus is charmed to bid @Hs|pg||
nt|sharkey: East found the "extras" and bid game.  Even with @DA in front this wudn't make|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: I am assured that Barel is not known for slow play|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK so closed room 1NT -1 and this room 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: with balanced hands they rebid 1NT even with 4@s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: live scores in all divisions can be seen here http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, 2 rounds of trumps and then @C is not bad at all; if anyone ruffs she will be on play...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very low scoring match   with netherlands picking up overtrick imp on last 2 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice fitting hands for EW|pg||
nt|joanem: so the US gals in other room did bid the slam on brd 8 viaa good 2 over 1 sequence with splinter in diamonds  |pg||
nt|mamos: The English NS played 1NT after a two way Club and a NT rebid on Board 7   and indeed the Indonesian defence took the foirst nine red tricks for a good swing and the match lead|pg||
nt|ritong: meyers va réveiller|pg||
nt|blewah: interesting choice of reopening|pg||
nt|westjava: fasten seat belt pls...|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Hurd and Wooldridge are certainly slower than average|pg||
nt|jkotor: przez trefle chyba najlepiej|pg||
nt|petergill: Good auction by Kamil - Fleisher to 6@C: 1@h - 2@C artificial GF allowed S to show his hand to North, leading to 6@C|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ryskiel_: lekko nie bêdzie|pg||
nt|mamos: not a very exciting hand|pg||
nt|wstuart: should make on the @C finesse now.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: am i seeing things or Did East really bid 3S|pg||
nt|chmitty: as we can see, EW have a good contract at @h mais none of the players cand bid this suit safely|pg||

nt|lechcold: kontrakt bez szans niestety|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and good save by USA|pg||
nt|petergill: This lead gives the extra entry for the black suit finesses|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|drorp: good pass by chagas on 2@S, soft 15 count no realy chance of making game, and here comes the trump lead which is often the right lead in those kind of partscore auctions, specially ...|pg||
nt|drorp: with good holding in opener's 2nd suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver opened weak 2@D North   that will make it tougher for the Egyptians|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nabil's heavy 2@D bid may give deWijs problems|pg||
nt|jkotor: na pocz¹tek oczywicie|pg||
nt|mamos: two flat hands - declarer has to work hard  for her three NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: really|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|reisig: OK ..talk to each other ..for a while :)|pg||
nt|petergill: An ultra-dynamic (Zia in his youth?) opening lead of @HJ might work wonders |pg||
nt|sharkey: West's 3@H shows a hand limit raise or better in @S - 3@S would have been more preemptive type|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: this should be a quick 1 down|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like no swing here|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, they stopped 2 levels lower -- but wrongsided|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes the CR had the joy of the @D10 lead from west|pg||
nt|ritong: et tout le monde aura fait son boulot|pg||
nt|meargent: i know that feragami and partner played that forcing|pg||
nt|sharkey: But US bid 4@H OR so looks like 6 IMPs to US and r\the lead narrows to 6 IMPs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Cullin won't go -3 now|pg||
nt|edou2704:  EW have a good @h fit, but not so easy to find when Willard bid 1@s, some would double 1@d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: but N might continue with the @CQ now|pg||
nt|edou2704:  she could have reopen 2@h also|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|lontoh 63: Henri|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: note Fallenius 3rd seat "multi" 2@C opener which includes a weak 2@D hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H was reached in other room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East bid sensibly in OR - first showed clubs then splintered in diamonds|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: now ok |pg||
nt|westjava: 10 imps for 3nt = -1 other room, previous board|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: hoping to pin W's 10|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: west thought very long before ducking the @cK|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lechcold: z tej samej|pg||
nt|drorp: diamond switch was necessary now though, but hard for east to know that dummy's clubs gonna be good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mcavoy did well to stay out of auction   cullin won't be able to read distribution|pg||
nt|meargent: thof course the 1@D opening lead to a very playable contract and a probable 1imp pickup for canada:)|pg||
nt|ritong: intraitable|pg||
nt|wstuart: I tihnk a low @H, cashing 3@H and then exiting a @D would also work.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry s3=step 3|pg||

nt|ritong: surprising choice|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@d must be majors but usually 55|pg||
nt|ritong: now, it emphsizes @ss|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this has been a good session for conservative bidding -a camp where I still belong-|pg||
nt|viren169: prbably 4@H here|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2NT is a game forcing raise|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@C is natural |pg||

nt|odysseus69: 21 points and 2 balanced hands- cant even contemplate game|pg||
nt|meargent: that lynn doesnt give up easily|pg||
nt|sybarra: and palmer to bid 2 @H now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think e/w dont let them play before pressing clubs one more time |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: N asks, which type of hands are included in X|pg||
nt|meargent: not a terrible spot the suit breaks badly but the spot cards dont|pg||

nt|copeyj: I think 3@D asks shortage if I remember correctly|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|ryskiel_: nie mam jak widaæ ale mam co lepszego|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  does 2@S guarantee 6+, does 3@C guarantee extra points and/or 5+@C,  etc|pg||
nt|reisig: A likely Puppet auction|pg||
nt|joanem: interesting raise to 2h because of bad spades i guess and diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: south took a very low road|pg||
nt|meargent: easts preempt did its job|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D says you pick major pd|pg||
nt|alunand14: good decision not bid 3@S, but 4@S, so that Tueje not dbl :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: and now?|pg||
nt|reisig: 1 try ...and out|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, 2@S was stop call|pg||
nt|ritong: okay, @ds are not promising, but rest is fine|pg||

nt|chmitty: @s and @h sry|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@h shows already 5 cards in the suit|pg||
nt|chmitty: I believe Sylvie will bid 4@s now|pg||
nt|edou2704:  in other VC matches : usa2 +40 vs indonesia ; england +35 vs sweden ; netherlands =13 vs usa1|pg||
mb|3N|nt|drorp: east decided to upgrade his hand to an 18-19 balanced hand, not sure it would be my choice, but rebidding 2@C isn't that appealing either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for me   south hand is either a 2@S or 2N rebid depending on partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is not good enough strength or shape for 3@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @S9|pg||

nt|odysseus69: maybe 4C is natural - some play that 3S over 3H agrees hearts and 4C is just natural|pg||
nt|edou2704:  netherlands +13 vs usa1|pg||
nt|dburn:  not sure what any of this means, to be honest|pg||
mb|p|nt|meargent: it probably will make:(|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT superaccept, 3@H re-transfer|pg||
nt|sharkey: West elected not to x as pd passed hand|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphznz: 3 clubs to loose..and 2 spades...anything else?|pg||
nt|josj: trump lead cost a trick...|pg||
nt|josj: declarer can now advance the @HQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: pinning he 9|pg||
nt|josj: if she ever gets to dummy...she should, in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: the 9|pg||
nt|josj: yep...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: easier to play NT - this will take longer|pg||
nt|joanem: but remember the gals are faster|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: lol|pg||
nt|joanem: i woudl expect hearts to be breaking 4/2 after the X and be less likely to raise hearts  to 2 - also like my 5 clubs for nts|pg||
nt|lechcold: znowu szlemowe rozdanie|pg||
nt|starkist: actually @d down on @c lead|pg||
nt|meargent: not that i would do so with that east hand too strong for me|pg||
nt|starkist: 3s was left over chutzpah|pg||
nt|odysseus69: another hand where biddin too much costs- I dont think North hand qualifies for 2C|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not easy for Tueje to x|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: good lead|pg||
nt|drorp: dont like to upgrade hands where my best spot card is 6|pg||
nt|jbgood: think he will make it now - in particular if he gets to see that N also has the @c ace|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: when it comes to correct views Michael is often god like :)|pg||

nt|meargent: think this is best lead for def might give them a chance|pg||
nt|petergill: Tough lead for West ...|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: howdy|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think 4@h-4@S now perhaps|pg||
nt|copeyj: just 4@S and that should end matters|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this will probably make -- foe 5 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|petergill: I guess the longest suit @H's has least to lose?|pg||
nt|wstuart: Many pairs will bid a doubleton as their preaccept - unless the doubleton is the suit just below their trump suit which would prevent pard from re-xfring|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S still looks doomed, even after this lead|pg||
nt|edou2704:  4@s is a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|edou2704:  for our vugraph who is doing a great job, in BB netherland +75 vs iceland|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: hmmm...|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: hmm|pg||
nt|viren169: Q. How may partnerships can break a xfer seq in their system over 2N?|pg||
nt|sharkey: previous hand|pg||
nt|dburn:  but the longer it goes on, the more worried the England supporters will be|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: cover to encourage @C finesse??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N East in other room, but still @S lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i think same @C/@H layouts |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   bad joke|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: might lead a heart first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: difference in other room though   @S to Queen Ace, lose @C, then @SK @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: if the Q loses, then try @hA to see if the J drops|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and if not take the @c finesse|pg||
nt|mamos: good start for the defence|pg||
nt|eamongall: a spec reckons Brown and Stockdale want to play every contract .. |pg||
nt|viren169: dont have 4 losers but dont have 10 tricks here either |pg||
nt|viren169: South will probably try and ruff a @C and pitch one on the @S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|odysseus69: the delay in the 4D bid suggests a possible doubt about the meaning of 4C - maybe I am completely wrong|pg||
nt|wstuart: Leading from the K in the 4 card suit is a little safer than lead from the Kx or the Kxxxxx.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: lucky 6@H   but correction to 6N puts opening leader in     the dog house|pg||

nt|mamos: should be one off now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|westjava: dbl score to Ina  25, 4@D = -2 |pg||
nt|westjava: and gain 9 imps|pg||
nt|meargent: for me i think reus 3 @Ss was automatic as was gordons pass the fault here lies with easts terrible 3@Hs|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like most do not break xfer over 2N or ...2N|pg||
nt|viren169: @c now?|pg||
nt|dburn:  these days, many play that 3@h shows three hearts whereas 3NT (or 3@s with five) does not|pg||
nt|eamongall: stockdale needs to ruff @Cs and draw trumps at the same time ... its a tough life as they don't let you play 2 cards at once |pg||
nt|eamongall: so this is doomed to failure |pg||
nt|viren169: nothing is doomed at bridge... |pg||

pc|cQ|nt|blewah: sorry, not doubled|pg||
nt|viren169: What's new?!?! It always rains in Ireland!|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|petergill: The doubleton bid helps the defence a lot - it can be better to bid in such a way that declarer's hand less "known" to the defenders. |pg||
nt|odysseus69: every overbid has been punished- every conservative action has been right|pg||
pc|d3|nt|odysseus69: good news|pg||
nt|meargent: think east had to play @C at trick 1 2 or 3 to beat this|pg||

pc|dA|nt|grebrof: can agree with you again Dror (maybe we should play together?) |pg||
nt|viren169: only 3d is good isn't it?|pg||

nt|mamos: lol   sweet :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: perhaps if he'd lead a club earlier|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: I do agree too - experts seem to upgrade for any reason -- " I had three fives?"  and when weaker players do it seems ineveiably to lead to trouble|pg||
nt|grebrof: the thing that maybe makes someone upgrade here, is the vulnerability + they might have an agreement always show 18 when they have 17 and a 5cardsuit|pg||
nt|wstuart: Kx also, will never come back.  It could win by getting a ruff if you catch the ace in the other hand, but with Qx in trumps, he might be getting that trick anyway.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barbyh: declarer can throw s in with a club to collect heart queen for d 1|pg||
nt|meargent: but think this one is in the bag for declarer|pg||
nt|meargent: in fact it will be tough to stop declarer fom making 3|pg||
nt|mamos: no indeed not any more|pg||
nt|mamos: defence needed to set up the two Diamond tricks |pg||
nt|chmitty: le déroulé de la donne est exactement le même que dans l'autre salle ... no swing|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: Looks like 1 NT makse so 5 IMPs back to Indonesia|pg||

pc|hA|nt|vugraphznz: Ware: Dont like finessing :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: tout ça semble effectivement naturel|pg||
nt|petergill: And Kxxx might not blow a trick if partner has the jack and declarer misguesses. |pg||
nt|wstuart: So, all in all, I would have also chosen the Kxxx lead, though I hate them all.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Agree.|pg||

nt|ritong: several upsides|pg||

nt|odysseus69: everybody opens 1NT with good 6 card suirs and swear it is right- I persist with 1 club - |pg||

nt|lechcold: i to 1NT te¿ by³o troszkê za mocne|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think EW play this pass as forcing.|pg||
nt|wstuart: West is intending to pull a DBL by east to 5@S to show a slam try.,|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 8, Kamil - Fleisher are in 3NT on a spade lead - a lot might hinge on @DJ guess|pg||
nt|petergill: West's Pass is forcing|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: dziewczyny niestety sprawdzaja wszystko na kartach konwencyjnych...|pg||
nt|wstuart: that will get them to 6@S.  However, east is going to bid slam himself, and west will likely raise to 7 based on his likely source of tricks in @C.|pg||
nt|petergill: When playing against opponents who play a Forcing Pass over 5@D, maybe 4@d causes more problems for EW than 5@d does. I know it's normal to preempt to the max with a good fit, but ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D - 4@s makes East guess if West is stretching to bid 4@S or not. |pg||
nt|ritong: first being that introducing boss suit is often rewrded|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Again the same problem i am afraid|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: back, sorry|pg||
pc|cA|nt|drorp: i'm assuming east bid 1@H to show spades, west's 1@S shows 3 and up to 15 count or so, 2@D is the 2 way CB again, any GF|pg||

nt|grebrof: many times|pg||
nt|josj: I would opt for something stronger than coffee here...|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: coffee for everybody except me :(|pg||
nt|meargent: this shouldnt take long|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yuval10: 6@c looks like a decent contract which makes on a good day. not today, though|pg||
nt|xenya: but if they do, 6@C is clearly better -- looking at the NS hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: south was reaching for 3@c over 2@s, but put it back|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2nd negative perhaps?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: lool|pg||
nt|odysseus69: either major works|pg||
nt|westjava: when can not?|pg||
nt|blewah: if they play lebensohl or some sort, that 3@c is weak|pg||
nt|ritong: well, perhaps the @s lead will turn out good, if raise is not possible|pg||
nt|starkist: and a 4 card major on the side|pg||
nt|meargent: notice souths pass under 20 points is an automtic pass after partner makes a pre emptive minor raise|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: it is as N says; there is everything wrong with my bid|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is not the sort of deal sweden need i don't think|pg||
pc|c3|nt|granguru:  good chances to win|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@d (bold) and 5@d got the job done for NZ - the aim being to keep EW out of 7@S|pg||
nt|blewah: no reason for N to continue then|pg||
nt|viren169: no...|pg||
nt|dburn:  but East may pass now|pg||
nt|eamongall: I note China is bashing Italy in 4th set of Bermuda Bowl ... |pg||

nt|sharkey: Unless West attemps a to serve a Greek gift when in on @CA...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|drorp: east went through 2@D just to make sure partner doesnt have some weird hand (like 6 clubs, or 5-4-3-1 with stiff heart) had partner had those type of hands, he would be exploring ...|pg||
nt|drorp: slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: screen down..Levin asking questions|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yuval10: he has a very bad hand against majors from Partner|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: south thinking|pg||
nt|lokaty: jest szansa na +4 impy, bo na drugim stole 3@H +50|pg||
pc|s5|nt|josj: bidding 6@D might get 6@S from S...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  3N West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no surprise  West opened that hand|pg||
nt|barbyh: in the open room ew were in 5hts dbld|pg||
nt|barbyh: not a good result|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: looks like 1100 and 16 imps USA|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps EW were worried about bad breaks, given how high NS bid on so little|pg||
nt|odysseus69: here 3c is 1 down but it gives N/S a chance of a plus if E-W press on|pg||
nt|viren169: and West with a 4333 min wont go on|pg||
nt|eamongall: 52-3 in imps this set ... they gone into the lead by about 12 |pg||

nt|josj: but an educated gamble at the right moment can be worth a fortune|pg||
nt|blewah: sorry, that 3@c would be stronger hand|pg||
nt|blewah: so that is why N continues|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling that would not be a crime|pg||

pc|c7|nt|josj: actually, @DKQ come down with 2 ruffs only so np in the play, I think|pg||

nt|josj: Sylvie can't go down on this layout...|pg||
nt|joanem: hard to make the discards on the clubs that;s probably where the 10th trick came from in other room? |pg||
nt|blewah: E trusts the auction|pg||
nt|ritong: although, when you do that, declarer usually saves one trick or even more, warned with bad split|pg||
nt|starkist: devil/made/do/it?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: i have some ideas as to what the first bids meant -- but am completely in the dark abouy the sudsequent bidding|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: this could give it all back|pg||

nt|jbgood: needing some help from defense |pg||

nt|vugraphznz: NS didn't ask for explanation, so I have no idea what's going on|pg||

pc|dA|nt|xenya: anyway, all's well that ends well|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: players explained all bids were natural from 2@s|pg||
nt|xenya: including 3@S?|pg||
nt|drorp: east playing the safe way for 3 spade tricks, and gets rewarded|pg||
nt|mamos: THAT HAS WORKED WELL|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: Ware should have 4@h and 5@c for his bids, so GeO was right in passing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room contract much better than this|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kiwibridge: there'll be a post mortem for sure|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|wstuart: There's a whole class of conventions which haven't been fully explored by the laws.  For instance, some pairs (including EW at thsi table) play (3@D)-P-(5@D)-P as a forcing pass.|pg||
nt|kareno: In a BB match I was watching n/s got to 3nt under their own steam, not doubled and down one :)|pg||

nt|starkist: I saw worse, getting to 3@c|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: vwd indeed|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Now West will return small @S|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: 1 off that's enough so same way for this board|pg||

nt|meargent: on 2nd thought 6@Cs?|pg||

nt|mamos: unless North does something odd|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: N asks now already for 2nd time to E if 3@c is really a 6+ card @c; YES|pg||
nt|kareno: The pass by Dianna Gordon could prove expensive on this deal.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: no upgrade for those nice Clubs?:)|pg||
nt|drorp: i mean i would bid game directly|pg||
nt|mamos: ah :)  that I agree with :)|pg||
nt|drorp: 2@h slightly wild, but in this vul and with pretty solid trumps, it's not dangerous (although i dont see an upside to it aswell)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north hand not getting better|pg||
nt|mamos: nope:(|pg||

nt|copeyj: wonder what 1N showed|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: not sure dbl at N is the right decision . but ok, I can understand|pg||
nt|mamos: just making sure partner knows your suit is Hearts ?:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Better to open that rag because it is 5/4 with good cards in your suits.|pg||
nt|meargent: and that tony is the argument for passing that north hand|pg||
nt|starkist: I open light and pass that hand|pg||
nt|viren169: need a @D shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: to have a chance to defeat this...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: not going to take long to play|pg||
nt|drorp: he has 5 and a half defensive tricks, he wants to play 2@H double if south has a hand that planned to pass either 2@s or 2@d|pg||
nt|mamos: quicker than I could type it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could be the worst lead for defense|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this match so far has been all about bidding - and thats where the points come from|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 3@H explained as 5+@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@S inferior to 1 NT so likely 1 or 2 IMPs to US here|pg||

pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: @DQ 2nd worst|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it was going to be hard for Upmark to find @C lead either way|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: this will be only 3rd non-overtrick swing|pg||
nt|sharkey: West has to duck|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphznz: South looking at me, trying to see how it goes I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which puts declarer under most pressure now   @C or @S?|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: they dont seem to agree|pg||
nt|petergill: If @S9 was played from dummy, Geo Tislevoll would have ducked  |pg||
nt|wstuart: The weak NT sort of force the action.|pg||
nt|wstuart: You can't sit back and pass with your own strong NT, so you have to get in and DBL and the IMPs can start flying in either direction.|pg||
nt|petergill: On paper, this is the strongest NZ team I've seen in ages. Last year there was a controversy when this NS pair were not selected in the NZ team after they came in the top three ...|pg||

nt|joanem: happy to run it to the Q in 4, but.....|pg||
nt|wstuart: Many DBLs at IMPs are actually more defensive in nature - you have to protect potential game scores in other contracts rather than trying to kill the opps.|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's really rather rare that you simply know that the opps have made a big mistake.|pg||

nt|garden2005: za co Kubie podziêkowa³e Rysiu? ... napsioczy³ i uciek³ :(|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: za to ¿e siê znalaz³|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead!|pg||
nt|copeyj: 5@C 0/3 and Brock will bid 5N and Smith will sign off I thk|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: if the play record is correct, S won 4@s in the other room - 2 down may be a wrong entry |pg||
nt|sharkey: no - wont make |pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: with the @hs 3-3 this would be an undebid with this lead|pg||
nt|meargent: en fin|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ...i poszed³:)|pg||
nt|dburn:  no real way to ask about Smith's diamond suit - but this is the percentage action on what she knows so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: he has 6@s, he has a @d super stopper, but he elects a third possibility with @h xx  strange|pg||
nt|petergill: The 5-0 break stops only the overtrick, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|wstuart: I know he had already showed some type of stopper with 2NT, but after 3@H he could have said he was a little happier about his @S holding.|pg||
nt|starkist: down 2|pg||
nt|starkist: oh|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like new leaders again|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: Cullin's 4/5 approach good save against game but very lucky he didn't push them to a makeable slam|pg||
nt|copeyj: well she now knew Smith didn't have @DK|pg||
nt|copeyj: so knew grand could not be good|pg||
nt|dburn:  sure - this was a good, controlled auction|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i had this auction in my notes but no others, so didn't know options/alternative replies|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in 3NT if declarer plays spade to 9 (unlikely) after ace of hearts then North has to switch to diamond|pg||
nt|chmitty: declarer will have to guess @c now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|drorp: running the diamond with 10 top tricks could've been seen a bit embarassing if it went K@D, @D ruff, @C to A and @D ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: Geo was worried about inducing a @D lead if he suggested very strong spades via 3NT - and what if partner has Kx in @D?|pg||
nt|wstuart: it's not clear he can't make an overtrick anyway?|pg||
nt|chmitty: and probably won't|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|copeyj: win in hand, 3 rounds of @H ending in dummy, @DA and claim I should think|pg||
pc|hK|nt|grebrof: well |pg||
pc|h4|nt|drorp: but the chances of that were very slim, and not all saftey plays are worth while, losing 1 imp every time is costly also|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it does look like he made 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek playing 3N West|pg||
nt|petergill: but Wayne still has a good point, though it's arguable|pg||
nt|edou2704:  it was better to not cover the !10 at 2nd trick|pg||
nt|edou2704:  @d 10|pg||

pc|h6|nt|jbgood: so am I|pg||
nt|starkist: this works also I guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: what do you think, yuval?|pg||
nt|wstuart: it's true, @D were scary, but S had to have something somewhere, and it wasn't in @H or @S.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lechcold: rutynowa rozgrywka|pg||
nt|don_kapu: ohh i count - 1|pg||
nt|eamongall: elsewhere Georgio is bringing home 4@S on 25 for about 12 imps to Italy |pg||
nt|dburn:  might have won the first club on the table, to keep the king as an entry to play diamonds rather than having to cross to the ace of spades|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: @D lead against 3N  for declarer's 9th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: has a lot of options now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: playing for @h 3-3, @cK onside or squeezes / endplays|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right   33 @H or @CK in north|pg||
pc|d2|nt|meargent: draw trumps and go down like a man|pg||
nt|starkist: we don t have a patent on it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Beth has choice of how to go down    a) slowly  b) quickly      "b" is never the selected option|pg||
nt|meargent: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: shouldn't she have played E for @h J singleton?|pg||

pc|h7|nt|yuval10: i think 3@c also caused some troubles|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing off the trumps stops any danger of E getting 2 ruffs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chmitty: two down now ... South will be squeezed|pg||
nt|dburn:  but the third heart will do as well|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wstuart: I don't think I would have tried to guess the hand perfectly at this form of scoring, either, in order to trump coup east, but I think it might have been possible.|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: no round of @s, @hQ immediately, draw trumps and enter dummy with a @c ruff to finesse @h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HQ smother jack  needs extra entry to dummy to pickup suit for no loss|pg||
nt|granguru:  In fact some players do go against the agreement and start @HQ with @HKQx in order to avoid partner overtaking...I think many top players have experienced this untasteful situation and go wrong at least once, even they have played 25 yrs togethe|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS opening bids are described as 5542|pg||

nt|ritong: oui, c est a la vue des quatre jeux que je dis cela|pg||
nt|odysseus69: another spades and minor?|pg||

nt|chmitty: bid 3NT with EW cards is not a success of a strong club system, but let's see what happens here|pg||
nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: here both N treated their hand has a 7-carded, quite natural when partner is passed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D could have game force strength but 0-4 zz|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: eas has 7 tricks...so coffee hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Bermuda Bowl  for Iceland   after  2@D [weak major]  Jonsson bid 3@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: W took some view to leave 3@h X with 4-4 @s fit|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H puts real pressure on EW|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: 1@S instead of DBL??|pg||

nt|ritong: fine spot|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure what 2N was...|pg||
nt|dburn:  natural and optimistic|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like an obvious pass to me...|pg||
nt|dburn:  but West may have thought it was something else|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|lechcold: 4@S wygra lekko...chyba ¿e zostanie postraszony przebitk¹ karow¹|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: board 29 +1 will correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Deas-Palmer play  "mini-multi"  aka Wagner   i wonder if either of them would have found the 3@H bid|pg||
nt|petergill: BB: Favoured teams from Poland and Bulgaria in 14th and 15th have very little hops of qualifying|pg||

nt|wstuart: This is gonna be hard to make!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he fancies NT rather than 4H - 2nt is too high|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|grebrof: I mainly lead offensively and I cant say that I have lost on it - I think its the same with these players: its better to lead something you have than lead something you dont want ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: did she have a non-forcing way to show @D? |pg||
nt|meargent: @D lead gives EW a chance|pg||
nt|blewah: should be made, i think. even with that bad break of trumps|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: i don't see anything in CC to explain non-use of negative dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: maybe they play DBL denies 4@s|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well cashed for an imp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  but since CC says neg => 4@S  i would expect entry to show it does not apply here|pg||
nt|ritong: phew|pg||
nt|chmitty: @h switch and one or two off|pg||
nt|eamongall: I guess Sweden don;t open 14-16 1Nt with any 5 major .. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: privet vlad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H did go down    making Sweden on wrong side of FOUR slam swings this match|pg||
nt|mamos: and the defence should prevail|pg||
nt|wstuart: but it is possible|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think west will exiat a @C now|pg||
nt|petergill: Mike Ware follows the approved Mike Ware plays of "when in doubt, put the opponents on lead"  and "put them on lead so they can make the mistakes"|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|xenya: bounjour Henri|pg||

nt|ritong: his pard contributed @h Q on the lead, so no trump trick for his side|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if NS ever open 1N with 5-card major|pg||

nt|meargent: in OR canada cleverly found out they were short 2 aces and stopped at 5 level|pg||

nt|granguru:  @D8 asked for a @H return, as there was a great danger of losing that trick in the @C suit length|pg||
nt|wstuart: Sounds like my kind of guy - except for being fun, handsome, and a good bridge player.|pg||
nt|wstuart: '|pg||

mb|2H|nt|drorp: some lazyness from Gino there, it's not like they're 20 mins late...|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess a fit jump to 4@h was unavailable...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: forcing or semi-forcing|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: that was a nice pass by N, if he X then his side might've run into some big troubles|pg||
nt|ritong: fine move by north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this mechanism means they'll have lots of room below game to learn no slam|pg||
nt|starkist: other room south must have got bergens mixed up to go slamming|pg||
nt|petergill: Lead now 36 imps after Newell and Reid beat the 4@S then bid the grand slam|pg||
nt|wstuart: The lead was from teh other side on 4@S - the @HA was lead and there was no inference to be drawn as to the location of the @SQ|pg||
nt|edou2704:  tea time already ?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: needs guts to do that|pg||
nt|xenya: good decision by N not to compete further|pg||
nt|jbgood: GeO was not as tempted as Lall at the other table - and passed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a useful 8 to the Kiwi with 1 to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has 4 tricks in the side suits and needs to add six trump tricks.|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@d 4SA|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@d shows @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: interesting choice by Gino here, deciding to go slow so he can represent his shape, rather than making a wild preempt at a big level (like 5@D :))|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek's PASS looks much better to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs is known for his agressive bidding in competition, doesn't let the opps play at low level|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably forcing|pg||
nt|joanem: 4s is aggressive thought she woudl bid 3s after 1n|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no bad breaks so no problems|pg||
nt|starkist: splinter|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure about this|pg||
nt|ritong: rather a cue with @s fit|pg||
nt|copeyj: Sweden bid 6@H on 29 next door too - well done to (presumably) flatten the board|pg||
nt|copeyj: aggressive opening, but don't forget N/S play precision so openings limited|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: south must feel he hasn't shown his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: by at least a king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  1N-3N   makes more sense to me|pg||
nt|granguru:  and even if it werent so, it shows a great defensive hability by the E player|pg||
nt|ritong: ou 2SA mini maxi|pg||
nt|blewah: or @s raise, Henri?|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - S kept it open and launched EW into 4@H...|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: sharyn and dianna were 4th in the butlers, some consolation, good try|pg||
nt|viren169: another flat bd... |pg||
nt|dburn:  maybe - a heart lead might have left declarer guessing a bit|pg||
nt|viren169: the trump lead wont do any harm to declarer|pg||
nt|viren169: Decarer will set up the diamonds for 10 tricks|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: 2@C was forcing to game, so East could bid 3@H on the next round.|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: Gino and Ronpa are both in early 30s, Gino ex junior for many years, i used to practice with him alot back in his junior days|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: what a lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: surprize lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H was 1 down but 130 better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice confident stop|pg||
nt|ritong: indonesia in the right contract again|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@S by Sjoberg a good bid - Rimstedt should bid 3N now I should think|pg||
nt|copeyj: and they have protected the @D tenace|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: push, nice little win for Canada against titans|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: oeps|pg||

nt|alunand14: how do you think about this board, Carl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: two or three specs have pointed out how ell EW Brock Smith are playing - I think thats very true - they certainly were heading the Butler for the Venice Cup last night|pg||
nt|ritong: surprenant|pg||
nt|petergill: "handsome"? I think Mike himself might say that he's only handsome when you compare him with the meagre standards set by other male bridge players|pg||
nt|starkist: I might open 1@d with north hand|pg||

nt|copeyj: for Venice Cup running scores|pg||
nt|copeyj: the foul @C and @S break dooms this it seems|pg||
pc|d4|nt|drorp: Ronpa is a big talent but started bridge somewhat late, so he missed on the junior circuit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would bet that Sadek is in the minority and that most won't be able to resist balancing DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: needs to lead a trump to beat this, i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since the auction is forced to game, it can be difficult for the players to know if partner has extra values. 3NT is an important bid on the way to a major-suit game. The Serious ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT shows extra values during cue-bidding, the non-serious 3NT denies them. You can play it either way. |pg||
nt|starkist: not the dream dummy|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: no doubt he has seen partner's openings brfore|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: restart at 10.30 tomorrow|pg||
nt|chmitty: 4@h très tendu, qui chute sans doute sur entame @s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as I blunder along I am being assisted on all sides by knowledgeable spectators- thx|pg||

nt|viren169: posiible swing here...|pg||
nt|alunand14: last board.........thanks Kevin....thanks Carl......thanks all.........:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: becoming increasingly popular to open 1N with various 5-4s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|drorp: pachtman had very good hand for hearts, but didn't realise the 7-5 distribution, looked more like 6-5 or 7-4|pg||
nt|mamos: and a few small swings mostly to Israel|pg||
nt|grebrof: thats true Mike|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sorry i ANTONIEMU ZDZIENICKIEMU, który nie jest be|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, that was a welcome respite for England (the unbiassed commentator said). If they can flatten this one, it will not be so bad.|pg||
nt|barbyh: dummy reversal makes it|pg||
nt|meargent: predict ns MISS THEIR @h FIT AND ew PLAY 5@dS|pg||
nt|ritong: 10|pg||
nt|sharkey: Janice upgraded her hand to 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: tu nasi s¹ w 3BA, wist kierowy - musz¹ wygraæ|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow. did he ever|pg||
nt|drorp: Gino's tactic didn't work out, personally i would just blast a big diamond bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: muller not opening strong club here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H actually could be 5@H 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: with 5-5 they rather open the Major first, before they are being preempted to 4@s|pg||
nt|pawel90: szlemik nie jest ³atwy|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziêki:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when they said  you can't preempt with 4 of other major or a void  they forgot to say it was no-no with BOTH|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: opposite passed hand   better to show suits|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this is the last board of the set.. |pg||
nt|josj: they will have two, I assume :)|pg||
nt|edou2704:  X from north now?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: TD in checking which board played... (time keeper)..|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H may be Dont - showing Majors|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Thanks to all the commentators and kibs. we will return at 16:45|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: no need to precise that south did not enter the bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: not many big mistakes have been made in this match - no wonder they have started well these teams|pg||
nt|drorp: last board of the match now, about an hour before the time is over|pg||
nt|mamos: this is a huge hand for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Thanks to Jon and Gary|pg||
nt|jbgood: you too, Gary:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  Dennis got there first|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: yes of course|pg||
nt|starkist: normally we don t preempt with side majors but fav vul can bring the devil out|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: tie?|pg||
nt|ritong: ta ta ta, jos:)|pg||
nt|ritong: please don t jinx, buddy|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: ok 2h made|pg||
nt|copeyj: I have to say I would not have been able to resist overcalling with the E hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphznz: so you have to mix the beer with coke?|pg||
nt|meargent: unless the rules are changed|pg||
nt|viren169: obvious re-opener?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|drorp: chagas may have found the bid that will get them to slam|pg||
nt|drorp: needs to find another bid now|pg||
nt|drorp: very tough slam to bid, based on the 10 card diamond fit|pg||
nt|grebrof: hardly Chagas "duty" to bid slam, but I guess S has one more bid if Chagas can dig up some @d-support|pg||
nt|mamos: Will EW pass if he bids 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: woow..the french team are looking for english blood at the 1 level|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: wyniki kobiet: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live/scorebord-venice-cup|pg||
nt|chmitty: l'ouverture de 1@d en 3ème, que je trouve très normale, les a propulsées à 4@h|pg||
nt|kareno: Spade shift now for the money.|pg||
nt|viren169: South not good enough to leave it in...|pg||
nt|viren169: now 2@D... what the difference between this seq and 2@d instead of the dble?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: the next session will begin at 13.45CET (in about 1 hour)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: Kevin was our great operator, apologies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  1@H with 5@S may just apply to 1st/2nd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs passing, probably expecting 2@s with Muller, since the opps didn't overcall 2@s or raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good stop|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: that 5@C overcall is somewhat -- er -- exotic... |pg||
nt|drorp: great stuff from Chagas|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll never know|pg||
nt|drorp: passing the 4 level, impressive|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree - very good bid|pg||
nt|drorp: 6@D coming now|pg||
nt|mamos: everything lies well for Slam here|pg||
nt|ritong: c est la vie|pg||
nt|ritong: la prochaine fois l entame @d battra leur manche|pg||
nt|edou2704:  cronier bid 3@s due to the double fit |pg||
nt|copeyj: but 4@S will not find a way home I don't think - at least down 2 on this lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lechcold: dziwny rebid Yokoi (2@S zamiast 1BA)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D forcing checkback|pg||
nt|petergill: NZ 7th now, 3.5 VP behind 5th and 8 VP ahead of 9th. Aus 8th|pg||
nt|sharkey: hm...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ryskiel_: karo - wróg bez atu!|pg||
nt|grebrof: its hard with no aces|pg||
nt|drorp: woahh i didn't expect that|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders can make plenty of tricks at double dummy. Oh, a nice lead!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NOOOOOOO   why spoil a good coke|pg||

pc|h6|nt|ryskiel_: jeszcze dziwniejsze 3@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s now ( more likely than @d ) means 4 off|pg||
nt|jfanha: vão perder 16-14 em vez de ganharem 18-12...acontece aos destemidos barrativos desta vida...|pg||
nt|drorp: partner went over 4 level, how can he not have 2 aces|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have been weaker hand with @H/@S  [or strong with one minor]|pg||
nt|lechcold: w protokole rozd 32 w Open jest pomy³ka, proszê siê nie stresowaæ, to jest remisowe rozdanie:)|pg||
nt|wstuart: I was asked what I think of this US team.  I like them a lot.  There are no weak links in any of the players.  I know every one of them personally and I think they have as good a ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: chance as any team in the event.|pg||
nt|viren169: one seq must show a better hand...|pg||

nt|alnanda: chance to big imp for indonesia :)|pg||
nt|barbyh: bojoh should make this|pg||

nt|barbyh: very aggresive bid by west|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade switch would work well, as it happens. Then South could put two spades through. |pg||
nt|petergill: in 3rd seat, weak 1NT opening is not used by the top experts - hence this standard-style auction by EW|pg||
nt|blewah: Indonesia will play Morocco in the last round while France vs. Trinidad and Tobago|pg||
nt|ritong: merciless, i tell you:)|pg||
