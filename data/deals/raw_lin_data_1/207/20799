nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi welcome to the venice cup semi final.  The first set was very swingy and England lost 32, from a carry over of10|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Here we go again|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: actually the score is 66 to 81, but the operator in the OR didn t recieve that message before starting the broadcast|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|westjava: hi Robin, hi every one!|pg||

mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: hello everyone|pg||

nt|yo_yo: hi :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Hi Mike, any news on the ruling from the last set? Julian|pg||
nt|mamos: an aggressive t/o double from East |pg||
nt|mamos: as we would expect|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|hlortz: here we had a pretty routine texas to 4@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North sure to come again|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this inv migth lead -to 4 @h -2 if they find ! ruff|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS will just see how many of their "winners" will cash|pg||
nt|westjava: good save in 5@D|pg||
nt|mug: correction direct from Aylesbury on that point, Barry's giving them time off to watch the match|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|yo_yo: Sally Brock's 2NT shows a good @S raise|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H i mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with 4+ in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: just overtricks at stake - time to get some tea :)|pg||
nt|mug: Heather might have reopened with a take-out double here|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: this looks pretty difficult to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@S losers and can only afford 1 @C loser|pg||
nt|ahalim: can prubaly make on an endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: run the @c 9 after eliminating @s and @d looks best|pg||
nt|yo_yo: can maybe eliminate @S and @D |pg||
nt|ahalim: yes that works|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the other room Dhondy led J@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|alnanda: 1S LOSSER DISCRAD WITH q@D|pg||
nt|mug: 2NT was minors, also fairly reasonable but swapping plus for minus|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: at some point in the game|pg||
nt|mamos: several specs ask about the ruling from the last set   does anyone onsite know the outcome|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Heather too busy but everyone bids more than me|pg||
nt|mug: lucky not to be bigger minus, both South and North might have got hold of 3@D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|don_kapu: what a brave bidding|pg||
nt|don_kapu: but 3nt look like will make|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mug: Nevena would have left a double in, 2@S is one off|pg||
pc|cA|nt|don_kapu: woww|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|ahalim: but decl might place the @CK with W because of the overcall|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the discard doesnt do much good except aid the elimination|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mug: but I can imagine Heather feeling that defending doubled partials was not the way to go at the score|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2NT a more attractive spot than 3D - perhaps pass by East was better option|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yorkbeach:  system card for EW http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/smith-brock.pdf|pg||
nt|mamos: Club lead will allow trump promotion|pg||
pc|c8|nt|don_kapu: maybe + 1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|alnanda: lead @s big problem for declerer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I know i would go down, let's see if Nicola Smith can make it|pg||
nt|alnanda: ohh sorry|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: good morning all|pg||
nt|don_kapu: good afternoon from Medan - Indonesia|pg||
nt|mug: West could even have been 5-6 but granted unlikely|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mug: they didn't know diamonds were 5-0|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rmb1: .. and thats it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: but this also seems likely to defeat |pg||
pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: yes - she did what was asked so I shouldnt question|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now the elimination|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: although  .......|pg||
nt|mug: passed out in the OR, didn't West have 14 points?|pg||

nt|mug: I'd told it wasn't passed out, techincal problems of some kind|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dgame: test|pg||
nt|mug: I'm getting a lot of messages about the scores being wrong, if it's close at the end I'd wait a few minutes for the official result|pg||
nt|odysseus69: e-w booked for -3 even by passing 2S so bidding 3D only cost 3 more|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d7|nt|dburn:  this is still OK - provided the defence does not set up dummy's diamond before knocking out its trump|pg||
nt|mug: 2@S* down one would have been a push|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mamos: both E and west had the chance to defeat this but got the timing fractionally wrong|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ruff and discard instead of end play, well done|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s5|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|rmb1: Another potential 3NT?  EW may not bid at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: W didnt do well actually|pg||
nt|mug: took some defending though, the defenders need to clear their club trick before declarer sets up the long heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: south did though|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but @S lead, it's off|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|runnerup: now a real 0akeable game on 3nt  and will be bidden i presume|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: you can play the intrafinesse|pg||
nt|ahalim: alas we shall never know|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: means running @c9 afterwards @cQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: makeable|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the double only cost 3 imps and was worth the possible psychological gain if it worked|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: why would you do that unless you see all the cards?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: dropping W s jack|pg||

nt|runnerup: slam|pg||
nt|rmb1: I was wrong about adverse vulnerabilty silencing EW :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: because it is close between the precentages of an intrafinesse and leading towards the Q|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|runnerup: some misunderstanding perhaps|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: the 3@D response was constructive, with a bust he would have bid a lebensohl 2nt|pg||
nt|hlortz: dummy's trump are a bit disappointing but we can see that the aggressive style from usa2 has paid well --so far|pg||
nt|mug: good afternoon Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 5 ruffs and 2 aces?|pg||
nt|rmb1: The first set will has shown that there will be a battle on every hand in this match, no chance to relax|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|vugraphznx: W just didn t open ;)|pg||

mb|4H|nt|runnerup: yes i see|pg||
nt|westjava: random from card generator?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: both tables playing weak nt - common happening in England but not elsewhere|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: 12-14 NT rebid and 2@C checkback Stayman|pg||
pc|d3|nt|odysseus69: if she doesnt rise will need to guess clubs but I expect Ace|pg||
nt|mug: Dhondy needs to rise ace here, I think she's likely to do that as she's cold if hearts divide|pg||
pc|dA|nt|barbyh: big red cheeks and black hair, thats about it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting the threshold that players set for a 2-level overcall these days|pg||
pc|d4|nt|runnerup: timing has not been best possible -when game is on you are in partial and wise versus|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably 2@c was a forcing enquiry|pg||
nt|mamos: defence have four tricks if they can organise |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: hi all|pg||
nt|mug: even low would have been ok, she'd have been forced into rising king at trick three|pg||

pc|h2|nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|runnerup: i see -slam not so clear -but makes this time|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with clubs 5-5, the @s trick is not running away|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahalim: the indonesian players were once coaached by Kokish, that's why they play weak NT|pg||
nt|alnanda: @h blocked''|pg||
nt|ahalim: this has no change at all|pg||
nt|mamos: West hast to overtake and play @sQ to defeat I think|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|westjava: you are right, Robin|pg||

nt|westjava: we call it BMS (Bridge Masuk Sekolah = gridge goes to school)|pg||
nt|westjava: *bridge|pg||
nt|rmb1: South must have something for her double: so North could play a trump to @HA|pg||
nt|mug: but ace was correct, no reason for North to lead away from @DK on this bidding|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: but the Club ruff might|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: West has to hod her cards up and of course not fly with q of diamonds- oops|pg||
nt|ahalim: although @H's are blocked|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahalim: but can discard @H on the @D|pg||
nt|alnanda: other room NS play 3 NT make +400|pg||
nt|rmb1: But timing is on NS's side, they have two chances to draw trumps (now or later :))|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: hm, the tables dont seem to be connected|pg||

nt|ahalim: made in the end :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello|pg||
nt|mug: so noone has anything in the locker, just 13 more board of bridge, we think Arifin?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H from West? |pg||
nt|ahalim: 6@S C turned back to 4@S + 2 |pg||
mb|3H|nt|lontoh 63: this was black start from n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: commentator please|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes tricky - because if North bids clubs strongly, NS are likely to finish in 5@c rather than 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: in the OR the Indonesians played the first three tricks in the way needed to defeat  -- but then West continued Spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lontoh 63: that|pg||
nt|mug: 3@H not exactly classical with four spades on the side, but what do you suggest?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|runnerup: here normal handling in 1s lead to 12 tricks in @h (or nt ,but that is wrong contract)|pg||
nt|hlortz: well suit quality of weak 2's has gone down over the years|pg||
nt|wstuart: A common treatment is to play 4@S as a strong single suited hand after a weak 2 opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: martel will likely buy it for 4@S -1|pg||
nt|wstuart: That looks likely.|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: in @s|pg||
nt|don_kapu: and all pass for 2@S|pg||
nt|ahalim: only half an imp extra for England, which the program cannot show|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mug: an excellent bid of 3NT, some players would double but you don't really want to heart partner bid clubs, let alone diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok for me but I bet that there will be some 4H bidders|pg||
nt|ahalim: ok turned back to 5@S +1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lontoh 63: io so cape maklum lah ....... kondisi begini yang kuat stamina yang bisa main bagus ,tapi sama2 US juga pasti so cape |pg||
nt|ahalim: omg a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not always nice to play in a 3-3 fit |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if EW had bid and raised @d, East might lead the @d2 as suit preference|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mug: declarer should cash @CA at trick two, plain sailing from there|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|runnerup: partner opened and you had 19 hcp -may lead to slam|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphznx: will have to put in the scores manually|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks like a more straightforward make|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting choice by declarer in the @h suit|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wstuart: Not much to te play on this one I think.|pg||
nt|ahalim: for people who are interested in the score per session of this match|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|runnerup: @d was missed by ew -but it can happen in many secvenses -|pg||
nt|yo_yo: happens a lot when 1NT forcing and west is forced to rebid longest minor|pg||
nt|mamos: easier for us of course because we know Spade honours onside|pg||
nt|blewah: hi Pak Arifin. is this the official score?|pg||
nt|mug: Smith made the maximum in the CR, so declarer has to pin the @S10 or manage some kind of endplay to flatten the board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now should start spades from dummy or Ace and small spade|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps @DK next to guarantee the contract?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes Q of spades works but swop Ace of diamonds and spade king and a bad idea|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lontoh 63: don't know how many degree on there but though cold now|pg||
nt|mamos: but looks like making even if declarer loses a trump a Heart and a Club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trying to decipher the NS leads - presumably declarer knew the @hQ was offside|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East might have bid 2@D though|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: now presumably a @d and a trump up|pg||
pc|d5|nt|runnerup: all boards have been flat so far |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 81-66 is the score|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you have opened arifin?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 2 imps missing for Indonesia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit weak for me to open|pg||
nt|ahalim: with West;s cards ? No|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they seem to lead the 9 from Q-10-9 - zero or two higher leads|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: cant avoid heart ruff now - had to play 3rd heart before trumps|pg||

mb|1H|nt|hlortz: possible @S slam here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: Sally passes but the other North opened 1@D|pg||

nt|anton72: mean c/o of eng ladies|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: the running scoreboard has England on 151 so it looks as if TD ruled against Indonesia in the last stanza|pg||
nt|anton72: because correct result now in this case is 168 -157|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes it is|pg||

nt|westjava: re hi all!|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: rehi|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|yo_yo: Now West opens her 10 count and |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|runnerup: 3 @h could have and would have been -2 ,but not a place to pass for west -very difficult place |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I think he will finesse in @d|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not really|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: S then must have had @hA|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: but it would create a 2nd entry to dummy|pg||
nt|westjava: will they reach to 6?|pg||
nt|hlortz: cue bids here...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4@C is likely a control bid in that suit, however, it may show a min range in HCP;  they may play a serious 3NT which would show more HCP and then let opener continue the auction.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahalim: evrybody starts bidding :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 11 seems a lot of tricks in OR|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: West will regret opening in a minute|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3@H was likely an ask for further description.|pg||
nt|ahalim: remember the Dutch ladies won the venice cup by 0,5 imp some years ago in bermuda|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahalim: stopped just in time|pg||
pc|dT|pc|sT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very aggressive bidding in Open room|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, no first control in @C I think|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos: we have no official communication on the ruling 6@s was bid at both tables on Board ?  in the last stanza  by the Indonesians after a slow 5@S bid I think and England asked for a ...|pg||
nt|mamos: ruling|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|hlortz: 4n/5c 0/3 and 5@D asking Q@S 6@C yes to Q plus k@C|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|mug: this is going to at least make to 2 more IMPs to Indonesia|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|wstuart: Looks like this is going down on the only lead to beat it.  This may swing some IMPs.|pg||
nt|hlortz: 6s looks a bit tricky with a @H lead u need to unblock @C shed a @H then...|pg||
nt|mamos: 10 tricks for West|pg||
pc|cA|nt|runnerup: not very many imps chances in this either -all thougth lead gave extra trick |pg||
nt|odysseus69: here West had close decision and might wel have passed 3C|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  it was a RKCB sequence on the ruling and an ask for the trump queen|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahalim: is that typical from Sally and Nicola ?|pg||
nt|wstuart: Can't get back to your hand|pg||

pc|hA|nt|lontoh 63: After 3 @H why N pass while 2 @S dbl by S, big question ..... although in theory they could get at 3 @S at least|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: 5 1c really makes ,but i doubt that they will bid less |pg||

nt|don_kapu: 6@S or 6@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: she claimed for 9 tricks|pg||

nt|yo_yo: DEwi shows both majors|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S do you think?|pg||
nt|mamos: there may of course be an appeal  we don't know but at present England lead by 11 more imps than is shown here|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|runnerup: 5 @c|pg||
nt|odysseus69: think she lost 2 hearts 1 spade and 1 club|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: i believe Stockdale said wrong card|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and nicola will bid  what|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: once North flew with heart ace there was 9 tricks|pg||
nt|alnanda: lost 2@h, 1@s,1@c and ruff @d|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now the road to 6@H or 6@S is opened wide after a 4@D bidding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: X might indicate @H suit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dgame: 7@d for -5|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 150 looks very normal here|pg||
nt|alnanda: 7@d :) ??|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|alnanda: -6|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: e did not open in OR so 4@S escaped w/o X|pg||
nt|wstuart: -2 looks about right here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: only 6 down|pg||
pc|s3|nt|alnanda: for 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maximum 6 down = 1400|pg||
nt|mug: very aggressive upgrade by Heather Dhondy, the five-card suit is good but the stiff A-K not so good|pg||
nt|mug: decent contract but the minors lie badly |pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahalim: this bidding is truly worthclass level|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who will Nicola play for @D?|pg||
nt|hlortz: maybe -1...|pg||

nt|runnerup: some overbid  -but that happens -even 4 @s is down - also 5 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: E deeply in thought|pg||
nt|mamos: The English NS pushed EW uncomfortably high here but 5@S made seems like a push|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in the OR NS competed to the 5-level at the favourable vul but EW judged successfully to bid 5@s|pg||
nt|anton72: need a minor shift now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahalim: when E shows up with the @S A, Nicola will guess the @D;s I think|pg||
pc|cK|nt|blewah: @d return to force a guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: WEst made a vulnerable bid so is maybe favoute to have ace|pg||

nt|mamos: so still a long way to go in this match 10 more boards here and 16 more in the final stanza - with the teams turning over between three and four imps a board still very much ...|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wstuart: Looks like the @D spots are going to get crushed out and he will only lose 3 @D tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|blewah: not an obvious shift but that's the weakest suit on the table|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||

nt|dburn:  this is a good result for Indonesia, since North-South can make quite a lot of clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW have good spade fit but East's @h honours are not working so well - East's 1@h overcall will warn West of this|pg||

mb|p|nt|don_kapu: or @h 5|pg||

nt|anton72: looks like we all can get a last 4-5 boards in the most tied match ....Italy lead only 3 imps |pg||

pc|dA|nt|westjava: ok|pg||

nt|westjava: every body so tired there|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the operator in the OR just had some difficulties during the bidding :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, South bid 1NT rather than double, so she does not have spades, and North bid the minors so she does not have spades|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn:  so maybe East has spades, unless the dealing machine has eaten them all|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|alnanda: still down, but must perfect defense |pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: this is going to be passed out :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed it was, though I would have thought East could bid 3@s|pg||
pc|sT|nt|odysseus69: defence better be careful - as long as West ducks first diamond East can warn partner off spade return|pg||
nt|don_kapu: according to my brother hood, this is pancake board (flat board)|pg||
nt|westjava: @S9 lead other room|pg||
nt|ahalim: I think blewah shd become operator once|pg||
nt|westjava: tied money policy, moneter crisis, don|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as a passed hand, South cannot be much better than she is. who would be bidding 2@c rather than 1NT?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|don_kapu: flat board|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|dburn:  this game didn't have to make at the other table, did it?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: a playoff that is with less boards than the finals|pg||
nt|westjava: u r right Paul, the others I mean|pg||
nt|dburn:  South may have a chance now, if 3@c is natural (as it should be)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North has the right sort of shape to X 2@s but not enough values|pg||
nt|mamos: south might dbl and N bid Clubs|pg||
nt|mug: I wonder why Dhondy didn't upgrade this hand to an opening 1NT?|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|dburn:  I guess it did, once South led a spade|pg||
nt|alnanda: @s lead|pg||
nt|blewah: what is 3@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  but North had not opened, so South didn't know what to lead|pg||
nt|dburn:  but about 1,000 IMPs have been lost in this tournament so far by people who cannot bid the opponents' non-suits naturally|pg||
mb|4S|nt|odysseus69: and having bid 2D South should run when doubled|pg||

mb|p|nt|blewah: i see|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: i think that  pass by S   "timid"|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West's 1@c is either clubs or a weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  and that, in times when both 1@c and 1@d are frequently short suits, is really not very sensible|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it would get an alert where I play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|blewah: unfavorable vulnerability. a bit conservative maybe by S, though|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mug: ah well, they got there|pg||
nt|odysseus69: didnt do so well last time- does that affect her?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|alnanda: next world championship 2013, Indonesia to host , we must prepare ourselves as organizers and achievement|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, maybe. But if East had held the ace of clubs and West the ace of hearts, 3NT doubled would have made an overtrick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well maybe East would have led a heart - we can maybe all day - I am too old and cowardly to want to be in 3NTx on the N/S cards |pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: on the other hand I am in the camp which advocates an opening bid on North so no sympathy when passing costs game|pg||
pc|cT|nt|blewah: ruff out some @ds would be my line, can go to hand with trump|pg||
nt|blewah: to table, I mean|pg||
nt|westjava: Venice other SF, France leads 84 - 46.5 imps vs Netherland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the x ruff will work as it happens|pg||
pc|c8|nt|don_kapu: 6 imp ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South might have reopened wih 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn:  they will have a singleton only when 4=4=4=1 precisely - but they will have a doubleton quite a lot of the time|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mug: some pairs simply don't open 1NT with a 5-card majors, for example the three pairs on the Italian open team|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|westjava: Bali waiting all of us|pg||
nt|blewah: they are becoming minority day by day, i think|pg||
nt|blewah: as 5M332 is gaining popularity all over the world|pg||
nt|blewah: for 1nt, I mean|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|nt|blewah: in CR after garbage stayman Murniati gave up to 2@d|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|odysseus69: think of you as a mere youth David|pg||
nt|mug: Indonesia are in 4@S on 27 too so that leaves this flattish looking board and four more for England to recover 13 IMPs|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mamos: so -1 but 2 imps to EW and England|pg||
nt|blewah: i wonder what dbl would mean in their agreement|pg||

nt|blewah: N could have tried 2@c though|pg||
nt|blewah: 54+ in minors|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|westjava: ABCC in Bali 2012 is open tournament|pg||
nt|westjava: so, this board will be push|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South did not fancy a weak NT in third seat vulnerable with 12 - not sure of the logic for preferring 1@d to 1C though|pg||
nt|blewah: yes to some questions, NS play weak NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn:  but on this auction North is marked with the king|pg||

nt|dburn:  and declarer kept all of North's diamonds and then misguessed the suit|pg||

nt|blewah: continue with @c now?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not sure I understand the OR bidding - East did not appear to be doing enough but maye 3H was a max or min over 3C -some play this and 4H is in middle|pg||
nt|don_kapu: in Depok, this bidding style we call Dewi Persik Digging|pg||

nt|blewah: OK. in RR 21, Bojoh - Tueje were benched|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:  and North-South have just bid a lot of spades|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|mug: Indonesia missed 4@S on  28 so that's 6 or 7 to England, depending on the overtricks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn:  not sure what 4NT means - probably takeout, but even so...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East must have a near maximum pass to X 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: Nicola might kno w what this means   dont|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  she will not like her @h if that is the deciding factor|pg||
nt|dburn:  ...if this is the way to try for slam in hearts, Smith may be put off by the quality of her trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  she may think there is the @sA and 1 @h to lose|pg||
nt|blewah: 4nt and then 5@h must be bigger than a direct 5@h|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, partner should have five clubs for this auction, and in general when partner makes a slam try and you have the ace and king of her main suit, you should bid a slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  because she must have most of the rest|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good point and East has nothing wasted in @s|pg||
nt|dburn:  for all that, East made a good decision at the other table|pg||

nt|lontoh 63: one agresive biding from Lusye ,that's her style|pg||

nt|lontoh 63: yes ... England started with a 10-IMP carry-over so they have in fact lost 32 IMPs for now|pg||

nt|alnanda: how about 1 @c losser ?|pg||
nt|dgame: interesting|pg||
