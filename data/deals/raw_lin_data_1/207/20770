mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: So board 18 was 11 for USA2 when the CR N/S bid to 4@HX which had to go down one on the 4-1 trump break with a loser in each suit (@D's were 1-1).|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Note that the double of 5@D by N had to cover a lot of ground just to show extra values, so Boyd was not tempted to bid 5@H or 5@S.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|jcwla: This looks like it will make on the dot, losing one in each suit except @D's.  Decl will win and advance a @C.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Note that N has kind of a difficult rebid over 1@S.  Normally would want nicer @H's for the 3@H rebid, some might temporize with 2@D for example.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or even settle for 2@H.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: The better reason not to open 1NT is that you may deem it too good. K&R has it at 19: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=A842+87+AKJ62+AT |pg||

nt|sommer: many will play 3NT on this NS, but not many will make it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 108 imps in 14 boards -- the swings were there -- but unfortunately for the Danish team they did not have them all|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: France leads Poland 84-68 in the other Senior semi.|pg||
nt|jcwla: England leads Indonesia by 16 and France leads Netherlands by 19 in the Venice semis.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|jcwla: And the BB semis are incredibly close: Netherlands by 5 and USA1 by 1 at this instant.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcwla: Thanks to my excellent co-commentator, John Adams, for his keen insight.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks to our excellent operator, great job.|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: Thanks to Aramesh for coordinating the written commentary for this broadcast.|pg||
nt|jcwla: And of course thanks to all specs.  Hope you enjoyed, come back for more in 55 mins.|pg||
nt|kjadams: double is "snapdragon"  showing 4th suit and tolerance for partner's suit.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kjadams: will be hard to stop with Boyd's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: and indeed he shoots out game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|kjadams: note the light opener.   They open most 11's.  This is not a bad one by any means|pg||
nt|jcwla: No it's A, A, K - would prefer combined but still not quacks - and a couple of tens.|pg||
nt|kjadams: most direct line is 2 club finesses.   he is a trick shy so will need one more.|pg||
nt|kjadams: the spot cards in majors looks like may do the trick.|pg||
nt|kjadams: duck 2 diamonds if they shift, and play to set up 3rd spade trick.|pg||

nt|kjadams: if west plays spade now, Peter can try Heart Q, ducking King.|pg||
nt|kjadams: diamond shift gives the only real problem.|pg||
nt|kjadams: or on a spade, he can just drive out the other spade banking on the club finesse.|pg||
nt|jcwla: @S3 was encouragement for @S|pg||
nt|kjadams: driving the spade gets him 3 spades, 2 reds, 4 clubs.|pg||
nt|kjadams: on a diamond, he needs to duck twice and guess who has the 4th diamond.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kjadams: spade 9 looks best now.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcwla: Well this board is like so many have been in this set: USA1 stopping lower and NS here having to bring home the bacon for a swing.  So far they are perfect.|pg||
