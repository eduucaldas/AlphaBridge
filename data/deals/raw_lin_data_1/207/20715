nt|vugraphznt: he says sorry and sigh's   but with a little smile :)|pg||
nt|pelu: and here NS will hope for a win on this board - for sure not losing 11 IMP|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: talking about system|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might have led a singleton spade, so J-9-x-x with East was not so likely.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: claimed 6,  agreed making 7 afterwards|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder if they are running into time trouble.|pg||
nt|hlortz: dull bring back the goulash hands :)|pg||
nt|ady: north opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South never counts tricks, he thought down 3, they said, same as Bocchi.. :) he said if you start dbling i will start paying attention|pg||
nt|ady: could have played 1 top clu though and then returned with a diamond to then ake a view 2nd round|pg||
nt|jkotor: Generalnie to w rozdaniu 10 5@d na 8 atutach i 21 PC nie jest szczytem marzeñ jeli przeciwnicy potrafi¹ wistowaæ|pg||

nt|fabsayc: stansby could have returned a club|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 4@S C but NS can go higher:)??|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@D better than double on that shape.|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed.|pg||
nt|idc: We heard a comment at the table earlier that 'spades are always 5-0', so I guess this 4-1 counts as a favourable break|pg||
nt|ady: maybe part score in diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: might go 5@CX-2|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: this 20-20 board|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i double versace passed 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt :)|pg||
nt|rensph:  W might be tempted to bid a thin game here, but it's NV so might very well pass this|pg||
nt|lechcold: szlemik w trefle teraz?|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: So much for 3nt by n...|pg||
nt|kit: 4@C a little scary -- Weinstein thinks opponents might have a slam.|pg||
nt|pelu: but a problem for NS that they never found their 5-3 fit in @c|pg||
nt|lechcold: transfer na kolor wroga to Stayman|pg||
nt|ady: light opening from west|pg||
nt|hlortz: his was more tactical than technical imo he decided if he lost a @C right away def would be harder|pg||
nt|bobh1: can make a game|pg||
nt|xenya: 1N is 12-14, possibly bad 15, if i remember|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: you are correct.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: but many would just bid 3nt rather than use stayman|pg||
nt|ady: that makes the diamond part score awkward for n/s|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Hopefully they get to finish|pg||
pc|c7|nt|santyclz2:  And onside too!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: as they were in bd. 9 ;)|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: and as you can see VERY CLOSE race|pg||

nt|xenya: ah|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|idc: if it asks for short suits, that 3@c will encourage him|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3BA to idealny kontrakt w tym rozdaniu..4@H mo¿na przegraæ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: 5@D was a sensible option by North. Some would bid 5@C, claiming that they couldn't be any better for a passed hand. But South only made a simple overcall.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The VuGraph records are saved in various repositories (one is Nikos Sarantakos's VuGraph Project), so we can look up how other teams bid and made 7@H.|pg||
nt|ady: was worn out by then|pg||
nt|idc: But then if that is a return short suit try, South will be discouraged|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: E thinks|pg||
nt|garden2005: podzia³y s¹ @d 3-3 @c 3-2 ... szczyt marzeñ|pg||
nt|kamyk: a 3@C to pewnie 5-4 w m³odych i 9-11; niektórzy u¿ywaj¹ tu 2@H na tak¹ rêkê, ale to bardzo podstepne i wirogenne:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: ano racja Grzesiu, choæ piki dziel¹ siê nieszczególnie|pg||
nt|jfeld:  not a good time for either of those teams to get a time penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we have 50 minutes left of the match|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so no timepressure here|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Hurd elects not to compete|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rensph:  Creative approach by W - had east shown a 5card major he'd be ok with that, too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this contract is touch and go, good guess in diamonds may see it home|pg||
nt|idc: ahha, am told 3@c is forced relay, then opener makes short suit try|pg||
nt|ady: may get too high|pg||
nt|famus: 6@s does come home --i think|pg||
nt|psyck:  other room has finished early, maybe Lall will login now to take a look at his teammates progress :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S asking W...|pg||
nt|ady: hand 26  a good swing for Chin   they are playing 2@CX   and made a game in this room|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: agree with all S passing?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gracelin: They may end up in 2S with the Gazzilli.|pg||
nt|antoniz: dzielni ruszyL|pg||
nt|lechcold: kara mog³yby dzieliæ siê gorzej (drugi walet, drugi-czwarty król przed dam¹), wa¿ne by trefle by³y 3-2|pg||
nt|jkotor: E ma ekstremum w ramach 9-11 A, A, K i 10ka na podpórkê|pg||
nt|jkotor: lepsza karta to tylko 55 z tymi samymi honorami|pg||
nt|xenya: he might double now, with the idea of converting 2@H to 2@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: low scoring match and China leading so far.|pg||
nt|eggy:  I don't think that's particularly underbid it though|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 5 teams within 4.5 VPs|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: He could be a lot better as a passed hand.  Stiff in a major.  Queen of clubs someplace else.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|gracelin: All othe bids by south will show the strong hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is one disadvantage of the Gazzilli.|pg||
nt|gracelin: this time he has a very healthy 5-card suit.  North is worry south ma bid the same way with a much weak 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|kit: Martel knows declarer doesn't have A10x of hearts or first trick wouldn't have been ducked, so continuing hearts is safe.|pg||
nt|kit: And he had to lead low, since Stansby might have started with ace-doubleton.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not if you're this NS|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: no top losers here  but 6@S may prove difficult with 4-1 split   |pg||
nt|ritong: he briefly considered a @s J switch|pg||
nt|kit: no need for that, since if Stansby has king of spades the jack of spades shift can come later.|pg||
nt|jkotor: Gawry nie mo¿e wymyliæ A@s u partnera, a bez tej karty szlemik zawsze bêdzie s³aby|pg||
nt|ady: still got the diamond fit|pg||
nt|xenya: but preferred a cautious pass, being vulnerable|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: ?|pg||
nt|jkotor: seniorzy taryfa w plecy na Duñczyków, tylko panie dobrze w tej rundzie|pg||
nt|antoniz: to mo¿e wtedy od razu 2karo?|pg||
nt|ady: 2@CX may not make   but great against 620|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fluffy: my limited understanding of gazilli says that 2@c is either nat or 16-18, 2@d is 8+ any, and 2@s shows spades and clubs minimum|pg||
nt|gracelin: sout may pass 1NT with 12-13 pts in order not to be involved in the Gazzilli.  But with 14 he fears losing game if north has 10-11, even a passed hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south|pg||
nt|idc: Stansby declines the game-try but 4@c leaves North a different problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we should be back now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: there has been some technical problems in the open room|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oeffff|pg||
nt|ritong: thus he sticked on @hs|pg||
nt|antoniz: wtedy AK karo i K trefl,te¿ niele|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @s are nice and friendly. will probably lose 1@C and 2@D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: double dummy can make 5@D|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphznt: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this strange looking play is quite good|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: for running scores|pg||
nt|fabsayc: saving spade king for a late discard|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As long as the x isn't takeout.|pg||
nt|idc: His dbl looks sensible|pg||
nt|famus: ya-4-@s stops it and a top @C ruff|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fluffy: the reason why south bid 2@c instead of passing 1NT is that he might be facing an 11 point balanced hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: you are quite right.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think they can get out for less than 2hearts and eventually 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West showed 6-8 with red suits|pg||
nt|kamyk: W ma wprawdzie minimum, ale dobre honory - mo¿e móg³ jeszcze zanêciæ przez 4@S?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: ty but then E 3@H not 4@H Gerbrand?|pg||
nt|jkotor: AK@d i K@c to potrzeba dzia³ki atutów i ¿eby pik sta³ jak kara gorzej ni¿ 33|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and we lost connection|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: that lead made it easier|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 10, instead 4@S Netherlands played 2@S and earned very important 9 imps.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rensph:  N missed a chance to give partner 2 ruffs there, now it looks like 3@D is making|pg||
nt|hedyg:  surely a direct 3@d over 2@H would have been gf and this was a slight invite|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: SHI a bit SHY:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I have entered the results from this room now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fluffy: but normally 2@s is with 4 clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW play a very natural system and use standard sugnals|pg||
nt|gracelin: signals|pg||
nt|xenya: no longer, Rashed -- The Netherlands gained 9 imps on 10 when they stopped in 2@S and made 10|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kareno: I use two-way stayman and with game values, I do always check.  That my hand is balanced (4333) doesn't mean partner's is also the same, particularly with the modern tendency to ...|pg||
nt|kareno: open a lot of 5/4 hands 1nt.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but not straightfoward|pg||
nt|oosmanb: could perhaps insure contract by giving an open @S since he's missing entries to hand|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: So the auction, say, 1nt - 2@d (gfs) - 2@s - 3@s offers a choice of contract.|pg||
nt|rensph:  declarer will have to choose between finessing in clubs or spades|pg||
nt|idc: I think I like the logic behind SOuth's lead: partner has short hearts so where are E-W tricks coming from except ruffs, so lead a trump|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cT|nt|xenya: somewhat ironically|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this is close|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, one or two good decisions required|pg||
nt|boedhy:  needs to play @d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and as Muller is playing it will take some time|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then he will play @d offcourse|pg||
nt|rhelle:  indeed- if only to get information how to play @ss|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has nervous moments -- feels a lot better with king of hearts onside|pg||
nt|gracelin: after the HK lead, the H10 is irrevelent|pg||
nt|antoniz: chyba jednak 55|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and the same will be done in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so on track in a second -- I HOPE !!|pg||

nt|djneill:  E-W know North is 3-suited, so a trump lead looks normal, but that will pick up the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: The score is updated now, the real score is 19-62|pg||
mb|4H|nt|djneill:  N-S do not turn down the pressure when they are down, they are professionals and know that keeping up the pressure is the Way |pg||

nt|athene: after 1@S - 1NT, how many clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: i bet he bids just two|pg||
nt|famus: in 6 i think he might well lead a @S|pg||
nt|psyck:  since 4@c often has other meanings, many would open 5@c here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@c = 11-15, 6+@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS do play 1@S - 2@D as hears|pg||
nt|rensph:  other table reached 3N and made it, so 7 imps to South Africa|pg||
nt|hlortz: that will beat it --i think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not stopping under 4@S now I think|pg||
nt|jfeld:  important to discuss your follow ups after your side makes a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|jfeld:  a simple agreement is that if the opponents run, the first double is takeout and subsequent doubles are penalty|pg||
nt|eggy:  Einarsson (holding my average rubber bridge hand) no doubt hoping that East doesn't get carried away with a good hand|pg||
nt|jfeld:  and that you are in a force through 2@D or 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Sweden vs. New Zeeland has played 8 boards so far|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they have 45 minutes left to play the last 8 boards|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Einarsson here, hoping to escape|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it is Wooldridge thinking here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|boedhy:  south will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = relay|pg||
nt|athene: hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Two - no need to preempt with a solid opening bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: China has another chance here, 6S is cold|pg||
nt|fluffy: not your everyday vulnerable preempt|pg||
nt|fluffy: 6@s is far from cold requiers a good guess i ntrumps or in the minors|pg||
nt|gracelin: in Italy they say Vulnerability is for children and Bocchi is no children.|pg||
nt|fluffy: normally you should gues trumps, but you are not entry rich to dummy|pg||
nt|psyck:  they did have 4@c available after all|pg||
nt|psyck:  cc says " Wide ranging preempt"|pg||
nt|psyck:  I would expect W to pass|pg||
nt|psyck:  with @s's & @d's breaking, 4@s could make here|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks far too easy to predict 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: this looks a part score hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: no offense meant sorry SHI|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but they won't use the bid with this hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  W bids 4@d before n can.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 1's to Aus with a flat inbetween each|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   have around 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|famus: probly xfer to NT|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks like the stopping place for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks  unless A@D les against spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rhelle:  2NT = balanced|pg||
nt|kit: This is as flat a 4@H hand as you will find, it sppears.|pg||
nt|hlortz: and denies 4@S since o neg dbl perhaps|pg||
nt|eggy:  North will think there is a source of tricks now|pg||
nt|eggy:  or not!|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I once made a weak jump on 7 to AK in diamonds, quite proud of it until my '@h'Q turned out to be a missorted diamond|pg||
nt|idc: a weak jump on AKQxxxxx was consider over-sound by my peers|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  q10xxx in the midnight swiss...|pg||
nt|hlortz: /no/|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@d is precision style so can be few cards|pg||
nt|fluffy: to a minimum of 1|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fluffy: aat least with the club opening he will guess clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Shi didnt dare to cue 4@d|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess Lian will move on|pg||
nt|pelu: but Lian still looking for slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he had taken a bid but took it back|pg||
nt|idc: and 'weak-jump' became my nickname for a while (till I did something even worse)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 6@d = 500|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this doesnt look right|pg||
nt|ady: cant get there now|pg||
nt|ady: may make 3@D |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W better bid @d|pg||
nt|fluffy: Cullin should normally bid 1NT 11-13 with this hand, probably he did and its wooldridge who i thinking about entering the bidding with 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  (no singleton or void)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  so Einarsson chose his "best" suit|pg||
nt|jfeld:  this could work out quite poorly|pg||
nt|eggy:  It could indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this is not for people with weak hearts |pg||
mb|2S|nt|rensph:  6@S makes on the rather fortunate heart position here, but they'll likely end up in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  2227 balanced tehese days :)|pg||
nt|athene: wow, only 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: i would want to bid a few more than that after partner doubles clubs for takeout|pg||
nt|idc: That's a good auction|pg||
nt|idc: Particularly by North, appreciating power of his shape after partner's negative dbl|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now what?  6 of a major looks likely  on the bidding (if not the hands).|pg||
nt|ady: south will have to find 3 discards on the clubs|pg||
nt|ady: best to take the 1st heart   but a difficult play|pg||
nt|famus: can see only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: oh my -- big chance for USA1 here|pg||
nt|kit: The North hand sure doesn't look like notrump to me.|pg||
nt|ritong: passing 3NT is a surprise, yes|pg||
nt|eggy:  Hurd knows spades are better|pg||
nt|eggy:  so takes the money (he hopes)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  right|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: this should be down, even down two is possible|pg||
nt|kit: however, important for Martel not to squander 10 of hearts at trick 1!|pg||
nt|psyck:  gr8 guess by Joel, I have to admid i would not have found the 5@c bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: missed a pass Karen|pg||
nt|kit: and ace asks for count or unblock I believe.  |pg||
nt|lechcold: muszê siê oddaliæ, i chyba dobrze bo moje kibicowanie szczêcia naszym nie przynosi...do zobaczenia jutro|pg||
nt|ady: and still 11|pg||
mb|4C|nt|boedhy:  well maybe south should go for 3nt then ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  sort of wrongsided it now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could it be slam looking form south...|pg||
nt|kareno: I also play that double as takeout.  And they have a light opening style with the forcing club system.|pg||
nt|rensph:  wouldn't want to get anywhere near 6@S usually|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best now is spade shift|pg||
nt|kit: he got it right!|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C - 2@D - 2@H lloks like invit with 5-4 in major|pg||
nt|fabsayc: chasing the vulnerable game that does not exist|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2 MAJOR ACES TO LOSE -NEXT|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT opening with a singleton a bit more fashionable these days   I prefer not|pg||
nt|jfeld:  the only problem with passing is partner might be there to the rescue...|pg||
nt|jfeld:  but obviously that is unexpected|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W laughs when he saw the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and so did Hurd and Wooldridge|pg||
mb|5C|nt|santyclz: USA 1 took a big lead when China went down in 4@S rather than the 3nt on bd 25.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You remember the deal where Levin upgraded a 17-count to 18, reaching 3NT opposite 7? China played that deal in 4@S, on a 5-3 fit and went one down. So, Kit's advice on the deal, ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that West should not seek a 5-3 spade fit proved to be good advice.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if they are there, I am quite sure Shi will take 12 tricks.  He is the best player in the team and reach semi final in BB in 2009.|pg||
nt|idc: Stansby's dbl started as minimum but I guess even his hand feels a little improved on auction|pg||
nt|idc: the 6@d bid should warn declarer of bad breaks ahead|pg||
nt|idc: I admit I might be tempted to do less as South - perhaps dbl is a little pesimistic but a forcing pass of 6@d maybe best|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: how to play now? not over yet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  now is there some way to endplay w with the @h loser and force a @s lead?  I don't see one,  but that doesn't mean one doesn't exist.|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, I suspect this won't make - need a 12th trick from another @d ruff or a spade|pg||
nt|idc: and this attack on dummy's trumps probably too hard to handle|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Martel reading a book|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "Starbound " that is|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@C+1 likely|pg||
nt|eggy:  Not sure once you have decided to bid 3C that you should then bid again|pg||
mb|d|nt|fluffy: if declarer missguesses trumps he will need to find @dQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: or squeeze south in the reds|pg||
nt|gracelin: not a difficult task|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S = 2Aces + @SQ - Lian exp @sAKQ :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: he even has time to establish a long Heart|pg||
nt|famus: natural for him to play !j--but if he opts to play a small @s--the play ends at trick 2|pg||
nt|famus: @sj|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the vugraph schedule so you can plan your days and weeks      http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|pelu: he know that N is short in @S, so he could play @S6|pg||
nt|famus: that wud end the thrill!!:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has so many entry to dummy, so I thk to take CA and play small spade to finesse S10 is the right play|pg||
nt|fluffy: Imaine for example playing a low spade and south ducking @sK9xx he might lock you in dummy with a heart and you have no way back to hand except destoying you chances of stablishing ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: @cQ|pg||
nt|pelu: this will be the 3. slam-swing in the match - the first 2 gave China 25 IMP and prob 12 more here|pg||
nt|gracelin: China should be proud of themself in outbidding the Italians in 3 slams in one set.  If Shi makes this.|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby will probably shift to club, although anything but king of hearts works fine now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: It is in fact Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: many play 1x - 1y - 1NT now 2@D = GF, 2!x realy to 2@d and direct major weak|pg||
nt|roswolf: if it is now working!!|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: good safe 3@C|pg||
nt|ady: on hand 25 China mad 2@CX for a +180  and 13 imps to China|pg||
nt|ady: not sure how west found this fit   couold not east have been 5-3-3-2|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: interesting bidding and wp by SHI b25|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: sorry b26|pg||
mb|r|nt|pelu: but one of the slam only maded on a defensiv error|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes sorry:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this time he finds the 5 card major|pg||
nt|fluffy: wow that's a strong view from a passed hand!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: various ways to come to nine tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: take a ruffing finesse in spades is one|pg||
nt|ritong: despite the superfavorable @s layout|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 11, China played at 6@S making 7 and lost 11 imps.|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  offcourse it was 50% but south has a very strong hand imo|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi must be thinking harder than we do except he is not looking at all 4 hands.  I am sure the line he chooses is the best one.|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the page for the result fromthe 3 events     http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|famus: so the Chinese wud b the first to put a dent in this Italian Juggernaut--They've rolled over evry other opponent mercilessly, and i dare say artfully till now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: jak nie idzie, to nie idzie - nawet tu stracimy impa|pg||
nt|fluffy: I think guessing spades declarer will lose 1@c, 1@s and a heart ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: there might be some problems with the scores entered -- WE WILL FIX IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hlortz: yes with both k and j diamonds with south i dont see how to make it|pg||
nt|fluffy: no, guessing spades he can keep hurd off lead and make it|pg||
nt|fluffy: draw trumps guessing clubs and run @sQ brings teh contract, but this is double dummy, what will declarer do?|pg||
nt|fluffy: he must worry about clubs 4-0 to start with, he might be thinking about 1000|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rensph:  pointed out to me that it's not 12 tricks if E leads a club through, so S would have to play the hand in order to succeed. :)|pg||
nt|idc: I still admire the auction (by both sides) up till 6@d, then perhaps South did a little too much|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer will go up with the ace|pg||
nt|twcho: but he has to choose from finessing in @c or establishing the 4th @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make if he does not touch trumps early|pg||
nt|xenya: even with @H 5-0 it's an easy make|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: another room and another SHI|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: down 3, and 14 badly needed IMPs for USA1|pg||
nt|ady: apparantly 2NT was alerted as showing 4 plus clubs  so there must be another way of inviting game with 5 spades and not 4 clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: maybe 1NT 2@c // 2@d 2@s shows 5@s inv|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: mb even 3@S|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kareno: And all he needs are eight :)|pg||
nt|ady: now down 1|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer losing a trump and 2 aces|pg||
nt|eggy:  East has a plan ! :)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  down 1 and a push|pg||
pc|c7|nt|idc: but perhaps we should put it down to good E-W sac causing tough problem|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As was suspected, Brasil got to 6@h on  board 10.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South found out 3@C is making|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and that 4@s is not making|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: East is to the bathroom|pg||
nt|ady: south cannot afford to discard a spade as 5 clubs and a sspade can be cashed  and south then end played with a heart|pg||
nt|roswolf: it isnt i am told!!:(|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: now overruff, diamond shift kills the dummy entry|pg||
nt|gracelin: now he need to guess DQ for his slam.  Declarer may try Heart 3-3 first,|pg||
nt|pelu: did he realy need to play @SJ?|pg||
nt|famus: so he has to play on the red suit squeeze but i think must surrender a @S NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: I say no, since he as so many reentries to dummy|pg||
nt|twcho: :(|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N was a good alternative of course|pg||
nt|rnmalik: timely K @D. S needs to ruff a @D on table for the 10th trick.|pg||
nt|ady: China in a great position to challenge for a qualifying spot  if they keep their lead in this match|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: sure|pg||
nt|resurectin:  Still here, yes i believe 2nt is invitational with clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: china now ahead 0.5 VP over Australia|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: were 10th and australia 8th and first 8 do qualify for QF after round 21|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but Japan and Sweden also only 2.5 and 3.5 VP away|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: so only 8|pg||
nt|ritong: hi ck hi all|pg||
nt|fluffy: as long as he doesn't touch spades, defence should prevail|pg||
nt|fluffy: he must know that he cannot score any further heart ruff since declarer will ruff with @cQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: so drawing trumps looks promising, diamonds won't provide more than 1 trick for declarer and he will have to play spades himself|pg||
pc|cA|nt|twcho: nice smooth duck by south in the 1st trick|pg||
nt|twcho: now the contract is doomed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Nigel is a classy young player with a great future'|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck:  Salut Henri|pg||
pc|c3|nt|famus: to keep trump control and check out @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: take @S10 and play @DJ - he has a ruffing finess later in @c|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is to eatablish his club trick first|pg||
nt|pelu: my bet: he will make :)|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@c was indeed a fine anticipation|pg||
nt|ritong: and the best way to push opps to guessing|pg||
nt|ritong: other choices, like 4@h hoping to play there or pass, hoping that lho will make an error are way less clever, imho|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: The bidding is not as we see it, obviously. Our VG operator is valiantly trying to recover from the crash (which is not fault of his). |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fluffy: now best declarer can do is 1 down|pg||
nt|fluffy: if south tries some fancy pitches from @hA he might even finnish on 2 down|pg||
nt|fluffy: because he will have to ruff @h8 with 1 trump|pg||
nt|fluffy: and then do something with @sQ108 opposite ONLY ONE TRUMP|pg||
nt|fluffy: even chinese finese in spades leaves him with 1 down|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: H to dummy, run CQ, covered, ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: without playing next card south claimes...|pg||
nt|fluffy: if succesful|pg||
pc|h5|nt|antoniz: przeciwko dru¿ynie z Izraela nie idzie od wielu lat|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: very very close|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|gracelin: if south overruff and play Heart, dummy wns, cash CJ, and ruff Heart back, the last trump will double squeeze NS|pg||
nt|fokal: true|pg||
nt|gracelin: and south cannot discard H here.  Best for im is to discard a D.|pg||
nt|gracelin: hm|pg||
nt|idc: I would ignore the 11 IMPs credited to Brasil on Bd 11|pg||
nt|twcho: Looking at his age, a mere 19 years old teenager, amazing|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gracelin: Madala did just that.|pg||
nt|fokal: E can't afford to play a trump now|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs offered my free cofeee if making - I look forward - he will make!|pg||
nt|fokal: since he doesn't know what to discard from dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kiwibridge: sorry Nabil I meant|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Versace called the director again, something about the double|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: If it showed @D or support for @H|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fluffy: chance of 2 down here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fokal: double squeeze still working if s ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: preparing diamond 2|pg||
nt|gracelin: now if south overruff the same double squeeze works.  |pg||
nt|fokal: if S discard a @d : @h ruff, @d to the K @h ruff|pg||
nt|fokal: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes.  Great hand|pg||
nt|fokal: indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: if S discard @d2 - then decl can take !KL ruff a @H and lst trick to @s9|pg||
nt|pelu: @dK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|fluffy: he can play spade double finese|pg||
pc|s8|nt|famus: By now SHI like any world class declarer knows the hand|pg||

nt|famus: wd China|pg||
nt|pelu: so S has to discard a @h, but then again @D to K, @H-ruff and S can be endplayed on @s9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey my half hearted prediction came true|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: actually this was the bidding :)|pg||
nt|idc: Auction entered is 4 passes and I doubt that really happened, just a typing glitch i expect|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re los kabeltje:)|pg||
nt|famus: had he taken the first @H --had a possibilty in !endplaying S|pg||
nt|ady: was a difficult hand to make  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: he would have done better to lead low spade on third round|pg||
nt|ady: but survived|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south doubles 1@S and then north bids 1nt, i suppose|pg||
nt|gracelin: I have predicted Shi will make this slam.  Glad he didn't let me down.|pg||
nt|famus: shud read him for 7@hs with that Vul|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: result|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: back to the double figure swings|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a z kim nam tu sz³o?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: but @CQ mb was better|pg||
nt|fluffy: the only line that had chances of making as chudecek suggested is to run @sQ and pray for @sKJx onside, with @s7xx begind|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rhelle:  so far NS have 12 plus scores - they will be happy|pg||
nt|gracelin: at this Vul. 2D shows 4S and 5+ minor with 5-11 pts|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2c was 18-19 , madala passed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, 2@C shows 18-19 balanced for them. The other Italian pairs use 2@D for that.|pg||
nt|pelu: me me thats absolut minimum for a Michaels 2@c -|pg||
nt|hlortz: true. it was a difficult hand to play. i expected trump leads w/qj09|pg||
nt|ritong: here lall/grue had a shooting auction, "helped" by a 2@h opening in east|pg||
mb|2D!|an|unknown Major|nt|ady: Sementa losts of clubs and spades again|pg||
nt|hedyg:  1@c= 2+|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: safer|pg||
mb|2N!|an|shows !ds|nt|idc: Yes, Bd 11 still being played in other room, in 3NT by East (USA)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: that was 4117 almost same|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Raptor is only played in direct seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: East is unbalanced now he dbled|pg||
nt|ady: this time they do have a spade fit   but still might play more safely in clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see what happens with a quieter start|pg||
nt|psyck:  3@h fit jump|pg||
nt|ritong: hurd certainly would prefer chunkier suits|pg||
nt|ritong: but..|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H on heart queen being right|pg||
nt|ady: hand 27   China in 5@C X   need to play carefully to down 2   -300|pg||
nt|fluffy: when you go 3 down in a vulnerable slam and win 12 oh hell yo ufeel much better after checking scores!|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|barnets: quel systeme !|pg||
nt|ritong: his action has the merit to place his hand immediately|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, should be better @h suit normally...|pg||
nt|ritong: he will not participate further if unsollicited|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play in game|pg||
nt|oosmanb: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this upgrade may get them to the good slam, 2@S followed by 4@C splinter|pg||
nt|twcho: I still can't understand why declarer take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: Meanwhile: New Zealand doing well against USA1 (23-7VP), Sweden-USA2 almost even, Singapore vs Australia -- same  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S a playable level.|pg||
nt|ady: hand 27 looks around 5 imps to Australia|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: some might be tempted to double this with north but he does not have that great a hand|pg||
nt|athene: you either need a shortage so you can get some ruffs|pg||
nt|pelu: just a X to help opponents :) - he has shown @h+@s why D - extra values?? NO|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we have 12 minutes left -- and still 2 boards left after this one|pg||
nt|fluffy: ok it seems 2@d shows a multi 1 major|pg||
mb|4D|nt|boedhy:  yes they will be pretty confident about there list|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only board 9 is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  It was bid and made at most tables|pg||
nt|athene: or you need such good trumps you just make them by force|pg||
nt|kareno: Nanev very close to a second double.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: I didn't know you were bi-lingual.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Because he was tricked by a 19 year old?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  after the accident on board 4 he is hesitant to bid 2@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C no chance|pg||
nt|ady: now Sementa has said it all|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Thundering here, South; I made a wrong bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: ciê¿ki rebid z rêk¹ E...|pg||
nt|antoniz: ³adna odzywka Piotra|pg||
nt|ritong: so we land in the 8 cards fit, relatively low level |pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry, 4@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: chances for -3 there in 5@C?|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@d is tell me your major|pg||
nt|fluffy: and 2NT can be whatever|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  solid 3nt again|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention that 2@C on a passed hand should show a sound raise in partner's major was banned for years by the English Bridge Union.  They thought it allowed players to psyche ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in 3rd seat....|pg||
nt|kit: some might open the West hand 1NT and get to 3NT.  But they then might get a spade lead!|pg||
nt|athene: he really has not got that much defence|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case, north might sit.|pg||
nt|andyv:  for those who want to see the open room on livestream: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|ritong: looks healthy|pg||
nt|psyck:  this should also go down for a more or less push board|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This lead will not test declarer.  A heart lead might have.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is known as the Drury convention.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And when 2@C shows 3 card support and 2@d is used for 4 card support it's 2-way Drury.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has the chance to ditch a diamond on the 4th club, so long as the defenders do not set up a diamond early.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Taking a trump finesse might allow a damaging diamond switch.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is no doubt what he is thinking about.|pg||
nt|idc: The 3@d showed 18-19 balanced & heart suport|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 9 tricks either spades or clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg:  in 4@s you would have to ruff high and play the J@S to create an entry to dummy with the 10@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|ady: this looks tough to make|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they did well to stop there|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  only worry of declarer here is to avoid losing 2 spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: with the knowledge of south's 4-cad spade, declarer can take deep finesse there to get 4S, 1H, 2C and 2D.|pg||
nt|ady: Duboin in with his jack   but partner had shown a good hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i am afraid that even is not enough hedy|pg||
nt|roswolf: my link does work if you get NO SEVICE press F5 on your computer:)|pg||
nt|fluffy: but regardless of what it was Hurd is going to compete|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2nt shows 6+@d|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lechcold: na drugim stole pad³o 2@H i jest grane|pg||
nt|ritong: yes trumps are cruel|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: awful board to defend this 1@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphznt: 5@h= 2 aces no @sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i see it is 14-16, so not an upgrade, and to me worth 4@D over 4@C since diamonds good for many discards|pg||
nt|hedyg:  extremely disciplined pass|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: instead of dbl direct 2@S is 6-4/5 less strong|pg||
nt|xenya: not an easy hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: Weinstein worried about a club ruff, so may play two top spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 37 IMP for China on 3 slams !|pg||
nt|gracelin: as there are only 2 entries to dummy, he could cash SA first to see what's north singleton, when the S7 shown, he know to double hook S10 and SQ|pg||
nt|fokal: he can evan afford to cash the @s As|pg||
nt|famus: this shud b a swing back to Italy if @s dont go to deep fin|pg||
nt|fokal: *even|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  E-w appear to have 4 losers and stopped just in time.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  on the other hand he also knows that with double fit Duboin is big enough to bid 4@s if it is there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: claim|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i think he will just claim|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: a bit late with time|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes keep refreshing the website, it'll work |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fluffy: in 4@s, 4 players made, 10 players went down|pg||
nt|fluffy: making 3NT is for sure a supperb score|pg||
nt|gracelin: the Italian declarer must be among the 4 that make|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer lacks the entries for finesse south for Q107x, so he must hope north hold one of the Q, 10, or 7.  So cas SA and take the double hook|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer can fleely cash @sA now right?|pg||
nt|famus: has to beware of entries to play @s twice- but also needs to check the hand---Declarer has his work cut out for him|pg||
nt|lechcold: po kierowym ataku konieczny by³by impas i damy i ósemki pik|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: alternatively, try http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|bobh1: does E know that all these @S cue-bids were "bluhmers"?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: looks 1 down|pg||
nt|ady: clubs being 4-1|pg||
nt|xenya: but now EW can score a @D ruff|pg||
nt|ady: ruffed with long trumps|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: we had trump AKQJ and 22 hcp and could not beat 1@S:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: If he plays trumps from the top and they break 3-2, he can set up the clubs, leeaving the master @SQ out. |pg||
nt|andyv:  and for current standings: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|idc: Fortunately for Brasil, @dK offside otherwise 4@h makeable|pg||
nt|hlortz: looks like 11|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: 2 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|bobh1: otherwise he might fear duplication|pg||
nt|ady: hand 27 was down 2 in 5@C X  5 back to Australia|pg||
nt|fluffy: what is wooldridge-hurd's NT rang?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see how hopeless it would have been for North to 'cover an honour with an honour'. |pg||
nt|santyclz: The bad news is the trump break.  The good news is that s didn't request a @d through.|pg||
nt|kamyk: pechowe rozdanie - N mia³ prawo liczyc na dubla karo u partnera|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this might be a fast board|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I think I can remember from previous boards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobh1: i guess he knew|pg||
nt|xenya: so declarer would have done better to play trumps at once|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: Diamond needed|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate sing. club is the 10|pg||
nt|bobh1: both slams depend on the @H Q and 32 @Hs|pg||
nt|ady: this could be a swing for Poland|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i even do not see DD how to beat 1@S|pg||
nt|fluffy: nice this explains why Hurd was not very optimistic on the bidding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: perhaps they were influenced by the need to do something|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, nicely done, now two entries to dummy for the double finesse.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: was not clear though|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it was australia playing the 5@c, so 5 imps to china|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: Now diamond shift and he is down.|pg||
nt|kit: Problem was he couldn't go up ace of hearts due to no entry to the club.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South may hope that North started with @CKQJ.|pg||
nt|bobh1: to get back in the match|pg||
nt|ady: well 13 imps wasted|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bidding 6@C didnt seem to be in the picture for a long time during the auction|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: If North had that in clubs, North would have cashed another club at least|pg||
nt|antoniz: dlatego wist karo jest niedobry,moim zdaniem|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's a good inference - one that South has missed.|pg||
nt|kit: But South failed to work it out, and a lost opportunity goes by|pg||
nt|lechcold: w kolor partnera na NT powinno siê chyba naturalnie wistowaæ, nie s¹dzicie?|pg||

pc|c5|nt|kareno: They are picking declarer clean.|pg||
nt|famus: this was a wrong move by Madala--now dec home|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: when a pair are looking for 3Nt a D often just help them - some players even have an agreament: D = dont lead my suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: asks for double squeeze or something|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: nothing|pg||
nt|ady: duck the first heart may set a problem?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it would david|pg||
pc|cT|nt|barnets: this will be a confidence building result for the young USA team- who have played well|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Holding mighty Italy to 9 IMPs is quite a feat.|pg||

nt|djneill:  also, East did not double 2@h or 3@h, so no reason to look for an honor in @h|pg||

nt|gracelin: EW can make 3H, so 2S -1 or -2 is no big deal|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 2NT   strong break of transfer|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: unexpected lead|pg||
nt|ady: good spot for n/s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|twcho: sure, not your fault. :)|pg||
nt|eggy:  Also as NZ are playing Sweden (1.5 behind) there shouldn't be a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: the lead guesses diamonds for declarer, and now defeating 2@s will require a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|twcho: wow, they bid it|pg||
nt|kit: Most natural play is to lead diamond to king at trick 2, and another diamond.|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3NT is non serious or serious 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  well stopped|pg||
nt|kareno: Clubs behave but not much else.  Good lead - actually Bridge World has an article this month about the benefits of major suit leads against notrumps - and their general success.|pg||

nt|kamyk: w sierpniu 80 Rosiewicz piewa³: "Bulgarija,Bulgarija, u Polijaka awarija"|pg||
nt|brolucius: One down will be fine, against a making 2@H. Madala was unlucky to find only two trumps in the dummy. His bid was fine.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction a variation on mexican 2@D, west showed 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: of course the legitimate plan was to rely on 3-3 @S -- the line adopted by declarer works if the defence err twice -- not sure how good that is  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: another chance.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, many thanks to Kit and Joe, my fellow commentators. We were awarded a fair bunch of boards - neither excellent, nor hopelessly boring - somewhere in between.|pg||

pc|c5|nt|bobh1: what did W show?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|twcho: and good effort by Gosney too|pg||
nt|hlortz: and @c 3-3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rensph:  should the throw-in fail (If S holds the 3rd spade) he can still finesse the hearts himself|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: This is a hand I would rather leave to partner to declare always - too many choices.  I agree that a club to the ten is tempting.  The diamonds have opened a path for the defense.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jaapfr vg: ok 9 tr and last board|pg||
nt|ady: not much scope for Austrialia on hands 29 to 31    so this looks a convincing win for China|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  yes, someday you will have to tell me about it|pg||
nt|twcho: this will be a serious blow for USA1|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|kit: He will still survive, but it seems so much more natural to set up at least 1 diamond trick first.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|twcho: the balancing double is absolutely normal by west|pg||
nt|twcho: but north had bid it much better than his counterpart in OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there is so otfen when it is wrong too|pg||
nt|oosmanb: denied 3@S I think|pg||

nt|jaapfr: was extremely fast|pg||
nt|jkotor: a jeszcze dodam (nie chc¹ mimo wszystko wyjæ na nadwornego krytyka naszych)|pg||
nt|ritong: that one took 17 seconds other room, play included|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: next match starts in 55 minutes from now|pg||
nt|ady: thx Natalia    thx specs|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer changes plan (somewhat incosistently perhaps), making contract |pg||
nt|rialc2: ciao a tutti|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|boedhy:  throwing imps like candy..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board, we start again at 13.45|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: that is in 1 hour|pg||
nt|rhelle:  this is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes do you know there agreements|pg||
nt|rhelle:  they play dstructive preempts this vul(doesn't everybody?)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  what is the range|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but the temptation to bid 6@c must be strong|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt overcall perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: would be interesting to see how lauria-versace handle such interference|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like a normal 4H hand on this last deal of the set.|pg||
nt|barnets: east overcalled one heart in open|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has preferred a double to 1@H (the modern choice) and may escape a penalty.|pg||
nt|ady: great result for USA here in OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course they opened 1@D at the other table.|pg||
nt|ady: thx Gerbrand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Gerbarand you were great as always|pg||
nt|hedyg:  our thanks to our outstanding operator in Eindhoven, Gerbrand Hop, well done! to my excellent fellow commentators David , Daniel , Gonzalo and Jaap as well as CK, William and Ralf on voice for donating their time to guide us through these boards|pg||
nt|jkotor: ¿e tylko jedna para z tej reprezentacji gra³a ostatnio wszystko razem i gra w lidze razem|pg||
nt|eggy:  I can't see too much potential for a disaster either way here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  getting to 6@d now is too hard, I think|pg||
nt|rensph:  Even if spades break 4-1 taking the ace and returning a spade works equally well|pg||
nt|antoniz: bardzo trudny po otwarcie przeciwnika|pg||
nt|fabsayc: about the time they finish in open room :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  That is extremely fast for 1N|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the senior bowl Poland moved to the win from behind on bd 32, making x'd games in both rooms.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: here even not enough though:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: So many thanks to Bob Drijver our excellent Operator.  To the specs for their wit and wisdom.  To Bill Frisby for his contributions and, of course, to WBF for allowing us to watch ...|pg||
nt|kareno: their marvelous production of the world championships.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Opened room started 10 minutes later than this room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are bidding 15 there|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: because the match is on VuGraph|pg||
nt|ady: slam to finish|pg||
nt|gulyas: ty all, it was an exciting match here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: bocchi pointing out 3H makes|pg||
nt|idc: Last board at this table (the Open room have 4 more though) so time for thanks:|pg||
nt|santyclz: True, only 16 imps....|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: Dennis tx for perfect job as usual and congrats to China|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rhelle:  4@d may be an artificial slam try in @c|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will bid 5@c now expecting @h points|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally, this double shows a desire to penalize opps, but my guess is EW just use it to show some values|pg||
nt|barnets: I prefer the unfortunate 1@H bid|pg||
nt|twcho: last board for this round|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a memorable victory for Australia|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: We will be back at 13.45 local time|pg||
nt|petergill: West is thinking about whether to convert to 4@H|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Peter, a good win for your country|pg||
nt|petergill: If W does bid 4@H, then @SA lead works well, but might not be South's choice after this auction. The 3@S raise at the other table worked well, by guiding S to @SA lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  David Bird would be pleased with that speed though|pg||
nt|ritong: talking about this slam:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: defence helped too:)|pg||
nt|ady: looks like n/s can make 5@C      |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: you're welcome :) thanks all for the commentating|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: ths Denis|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: tx David and kibs last session at 16.45|pg||
nt|ady: thx specks|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and then Icelands faith has been put into other hands|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Having a stiff spade and a good suit, bidding 2@H is clear and not close in my opinion|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I cant figure out if Iceland is safe in Top8 -- but I think not, yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1@D will be a transfer bid.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  as well as to the World Bridge Federation and to the World Bridge Federation with the Nederlandse Bridge Bond for sharing this important event  with us,especially to Jacob Hop who is instrumental in organising the broadcasts on behalf of BBO!|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: The next session starts in around 1 hours and 10 minutes. It will be the last session of the day.|pg||
nt|kit: This time it is right to play the 5-3 major-suit fit|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even promising spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board for the day, back tomorrow at 10.30 Paris time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: here at the playing site in Veldhoven|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our excellent operator Jan Nielsen|pg||

nt|garden2005: nast¹pi przebudzenie|pg||
nt|ady: another game for n/s|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|ritong: but north has a lot|pg||
nt|ritong: brutal bids of that sort must be precise|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes N will get to slam opp a positive response|pg||
nt|ritong: my guess would be 5332 9/10|pg||
nt|psyck:  1@c is 17+, so 8-9HCP 5332 for the 3N maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: anyway stefanov will drive on|pg||
nt|ritong: he is considering which way|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and return whilst last round RR is full of tension|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  still liking his hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: despite this loss of Italy they still do lead the Round Robin pack after round 5|pg||
nt|idc: to the WBF for allowing us to broadcast this event|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Martel doesn't particularly mind a @s contract by e-w.|pg||
nt|idc: and as always to Roland and BBO, without whose work none of this amazing stuff would happen|pg||
nt|hedyg:  special thanks to our specs for joining and the kind and helpful messages. we hope you enjoyed the show.|pg||
nt|ady: may take some bidding   4th heart and the jack  the key|pg||
nt|hlortz: thx David, Hasan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last board, thanks to our operator Felipe and to my co-commentators Peter and Henry|pg||
nt|ritong: sober|pg||
nt|ady: bad splits in the majors may beat any major suit game    but  5 clubs looks a make getting diamon d position right|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: tension here already. The Dutch all follow their ladies team|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: anyone any idea of ages N and S?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: currently 8th, but France in 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Ultima board del segmento|pg||
nt|fluffy: grue-lall got a very good result here|pg||
nt|fluffy: after EW found their 4-4 spade fit Grue on north doubled knowing his partner had 4@s and he had a big hand after opener|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rensph:  in this layout it all mattered very little, had north held the @HK it would've been a very effective @SQ|pg||
nt|famus: i rate them favourite to win|pg||
nt|gracelin: some care is needed here.  But I am confident Shi will also bring this home.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: LIAN already left the table|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a well educated quess Famus±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: the next match will start in 40 minutes from now.  Tks all for watching and hope you have enjoyed some great hands.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will also like to thank Felipe, our most capable operator who explained many bidding sequences to us.|pg||
nt|pelu: a way to play is @cA - @H to Q, @hA and then 4x@D discard @s, then @C AND MAKING 11|pg||
nt|jaapfr: looks tough for E )DD very easy'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but he is afraid for @H loss @C@C and @SA for down 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer want to cash HA first as a safety play(he could afford t lose one trump), but here the threat for club overruff made that play not totally safe.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and very afraid for ducking this IF S 6 card @C|pg||
nt|famus: playing @hA is sure wau to -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7 card|pg||
nt|famus: 6 cards he has so needs to duck|pg||
nt|gracelin: with a 7-card club suit at this Vul. south may have bid more.  so duck the first club then take trump finesse maybe a good way.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hope he does not go for the line @CA @HA x@S|pg||
nt|lechcold: dojd¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: chyba...|pg||
nt|jkotor: OBY!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fate -- not faith off course :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: and to the spectators for some alert analysis|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and to the commentator for an excellent job |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do you think 3@d is forcing or not here?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W seems to be in doubt|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|boedhy:  now pass finally|pg||
nt|rhelle:  good sequence - 5@c is again 50% at best|pg||
nt|boedhy:  slam again 50% or so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well the 6 card trump support is hardly clear|pg||
nt|antoniz: mnie jest po prostu smutno,ale wierzê w przebudzenie naszych reprezentantów:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: * nie chc¹c|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie by³y to ³atwe rozdania|pg||
nt|psyck:  whichever strain he chooses will work as cards lay|pg||
nt|psyck:  6@c the normal choice to protect @dK|pg||
nt|eggy:  on this score they are safe I think|pg||
nt|jfeld:  So, Iceland looks safe to me|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Even if Japan blitzed they can't catch them|pg||
nt|eggy:  japan cannot pick up enough more (they are on 21 already)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: If that is so I will congratulate both teams in this match|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play|pg||
nt|rhelle:  North: you guys have a bit of a @h fit|pg||
nt|kareno: Spectators, you'd better reserve your seats for the entire tournament - there is much wonderful bridge coming up!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W decides that 3@d was non forcing and passed|pg||
nt|petergill: At this vulnerability, I'm a big fan of Fleischer's decision to treat KQx as four spades |pg||
nt|petergill: Fleisher I mean|pg||
nt|twcho: if non-@s lead, declarer will go down at most one|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA lead ---> 300 when declarer has to try for 3-3 trumps to try to make his contract, but I think a @D lead might be more likely|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: Dennis?|pg||
nt|rialc2: siamo tutti scossi dalla scomparsa del "grande Sic"!|pg||
nt|fluffy: this double sometimes won't work obviously, but today it brings 500 that can't be beaten|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lechcold: :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i wonder if he has A10x in spades if things would have been different|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Li just left the room -- and now Liu is on his own -- will he manage that?|pg||
nt|ehsana: .....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile 5@D in open room going down undoubled|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi now has a decision to make. Pass, 2NT, 3@D? He has chosen 2NT.|pg||
nt|ady: request for a link to running scores please|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@SX would not have been much fun|pg||

nt|hlortz: thanks msrtin peter and our great kibs & operator.. it was a 2 board match for usa team...|pg||
nt|ritong: pard can hold @s KQJxx and an ace, perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: australia pulled back 5 on hand 29|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Shi seems rather old, Lian is younger (like 30s or 40s)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: ty|pg||
pc|s3|nt|twcho: now declarer is safe from being punched|pg||
nt|gulyas: S probably showing distribution here|pg||
nt|hlortz: /martin/|pg||
nt|ady: not many top losers in hears with J9 doubleton   but spade force may deadent the club suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Vladimir and Harold and all the specs, absorbing bridge.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s look out of the bidding at this stage|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: once i told Shi is old, he immediately took out his 5@c :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: what a bid 5@C:)|pg||
nt|ady: oh a different turn|pg||
nt|resurectin:  not sure after interference, but usually 2d shows normal opening hand|pg||
nt|eggy:  and sweden are playing New zealand who are the only others who can pvertake them|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|santyclz2:  Although the dummy's @c holding looks ominous.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I think south showed some @S now|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Gerbrand when is restart please?|pg||
nt|garden2005: dziêkujê za wspólne kibicowanie - dobranoc :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: I love 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: dont know where that came from|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: from SHI|pg||
nt|yuval10: if X over 2@c was for a lead, and showed good suit, then why not?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i think edgtton is writing that dbl shows interest in bidding 5@h|pg||
nt|ady: though not sure about the west double?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  This looks like an easy 9 tricks with Diamonds coming home|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rensph:  3N is made on a heart lead and continuation here, but if defenders set up a diamond trick early on declarer will still have to find the @SQ|pg||
nt|rensph:  I'm also informed that lauria made 4@S on this hand|pg||
nt|rensph:  3NT, sorry|pg||
nt|jacksond: if plays donde for spade queen he makes quite easily|pg||
nt|rensph:  sorry, 3N making with clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: been called worse|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: from N's double?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: yyy|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: hoi vlad|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: can't properly read the note, all writing are mixed together|pg||
nt|ritong: the line is interesting, though|pg||
nt|ritong: how would you proceed?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  duck 2 spades|pg||
nt|ritong: means two discards from dummy|pg||
nt|jfeld:  and try to duck a heart to the safe hand|pg||
nt|jfeld:  I would pitch a club|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: North realised that his partner must have had some purpose in bidding 2@C checkback. When it turned out that he was not looking for four hearts, he knew that he must have been ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: looking for a 5-3 spade fit.|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@C Krzysztof potraktowa³ jako normalny cue-bid|pg||
nt|famus: Thnks Henery--and i go along with the n key:)|pg||
nt|ady: clubs in fact blocked if the play 3NT    4 spades safer|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know it Italy in slam on hand 31?|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: wlc|pg||
nt|yuval10: S wanted to bid it anyway but wanted to hear more from opps|pg||
nt|xenya: hoi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: all pressure now on E|pg||
nt|ady: I agree 5@C  from Shi a good possibility   but seemed to be lrking in wings for a couple of rounds|pg||
nt|yuval10: he was affraid that the bidding will stall after 3@s so he bided what he wanted to bid at first place|pg||
nt|ady: this must confirm a good win for China|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: running scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: assuming this makes|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|boedhy:  and offcourse this one is down on @s lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  thinking about it, 6@c is down on a @s lead|pg||
nt|kit: 10 easy tricks with spades splitting, but only 8 in notrump|pg||
nt|brolucius: if you want to listen to Voice Commentary, you should go directly to website: http://www.bridgebase.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 16.45 1hr 20 from now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb they go for 6@D|pg||
nt|gulyas: next set starting at 16:45|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably 3NT is 5422, and now north has to think|pg||
nt|hedyg:  shame only the 1st page of the NS CC is loaded :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DQ so vital here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I try to read what South wrote down|pg||
nt|fluffy: against many 8 HCP hands 6@d has no play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Lauria did bid 4NT as East|pg||
nt|yuval10: it will|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: yes it will make|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: simple after this lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: pls kibs we are not responsible for the bids of the players:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i hear Lian 45 and SHI 47 (your bridge much better than yr agequessing Dennis:)|pg||
nt|eggy:  if he ducks enough spades East he might even end up with a squeeze of West for +1 I think|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|famus: yes--too tired--as pointed out by informed kibtz-- taking @H  A wud need to squeeze|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and Versace has bid 6@H|pg||
nt|ritong: now he has an avoidance play if east has three@hs including exactly one card superior to the 8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphznt: Bye for now|pg||
nt|kareno: So that's it and Italy will get most or all of the VPs for this match.  Well done!!|pg||
nt|rensph:  lets see how declarer handles 4@S here though|pg||
nt|gracelin: He play Hear to break 2-2 or a singleton honor drops.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pity|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy recovered 19 mps in last 2 boards for a tied match.  Bye all|pg||
nt|famus: so a well deserved 1 imp:) thnks all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still China wins    wddddddddd±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed.  They tied with both Sweden and Italy today|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ±' ±'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i try to smile but fail............±)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ty everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: see you soon|pg||
nt|lechcold: przyda³oby siê 4N jako cue-ogólny|pg||
nt|petergill: If @CJ to king at Trick 2, then on @DK N will play @D9 as suit pref for @SA underlead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@D plsssssss|pg||
nt|ady: may know shape   but needs KJ hearts as well as QD|pg||
nt|fluffy: he is also worried about clubs because he has @cQx and partner could have 2 low|pg||
nt|fluffy: wooldridge and hurd probably play a conventional 1NT-2NT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|antoniz: po kontrze w 3tr,chyba lepsze 4tr|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: jutrzejsze przekazy zaczynaja sie o 10.30|pg||

nt|yuval10: running scores:  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=881|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: declarer can not go wrong imo|pg||
nt|yuval10: the server is sometimes sluggish but that's the correct URL|pg||
nt|ady: hand 30    china fained 5 imps making +80 in 1 spade|pg||
nt|ady: gained|pg||
nt|ritong: giving up on that suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: this likely to make|pg||
nt|brolucius: (My spelling is better than my typing.)|pg||
nt|barnets: should the two teams meet later on in the KO stages|pg||
nt|barnets: a good match and especially fine performance by the young USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: East doubled 1@C, so not certain that declarer will score four diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will not hold a singleton diamond for his double, so declarer will start with the @DK.|pg||
nt|ady: maybe south will raise|pg||
nt|ady: no|pg||
nt|gulyas: no reason to, he told his story already|pg||
nt|fluffy: soth has told his story, he is not raising|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South going through the auction, and asks who is declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And told he has a good hand for N|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they are|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|idc: I should also thank the players - been a lot of good bridge to watch|pg||
nt|ady: has he shown the vital Q@D?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes but his hcp are so beautiful|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North could do a slam try|pg||
nt|ritong: i would do like you, jason|pg||
nt|ritong: keeping the @h option|pg||
nt|rialc2: interessante e simpatica la difesa di Ovest: sfortunatissima nella situazione|pg||
nt|rialc2: a più tardi. Ciao|pg||
nt|fluffy: so 2@c and then 2NT didn't promise any major|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: especially getting diamonds right|pg||
nt|barnets: this will still be a small swing to USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: With -500 on there partners' card, it was very much the right thing to do (as it happens) to bid game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..their..|pg||
nt|barnets: who will win this match and have a carry forward of some kind|pg||
nt|ady: may make even with 3 diamonds    as long as playing 1st club from north|pg||
nt|ady: thx Henry Hasan|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Lauria now thinking of bidding 6NT vs pass|pg||
pc|h4|nt|boedhy:  well good start for the Netherlands...and with all these difficult and lively boards fun to watch|pg||
nt|boedhy:  bye bye|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ok, thx all - see you in an hour|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bye|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d4|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ady: doubled paert score sing   China played 2@C making 10 tricks in OR on hand 30|pg||
nt|yuval10: also http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: China have put a very creditable performance this match  |pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: I think will get diamond right   as does not want west on lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could easily be 4-4-4-1 for his initial take-out double.|pg||
nt|ady: well thx all|pg||
nt|jbennet: wd NS |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|fluffy: his hcp are maximum yes jaap, but partner could have anything|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thx all cu in 1hr and 20 min|pg||

nt|gulyas: thnx all|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|jaapfr vg: b17 and b17 made up for the exact difference between China and Australia sofar|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: b17 and b26|pg||
nt|jbennet: at last a pair who ventured biddin in early stage. reaching their unbeatable 5 Clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i think official playing time was over 7 minutes ago, but no director yet|pg||
nt|yuval10: it looks like the first 5 teams are locked in the QF ( Italy, NET, USA2, Israel and USA1 ) , while many teams are struggling for the last 3 spots|pg||
nt|xenya: so China was 2.5VP ahead of Australia after board 30. With Sweden pressing closely behind the last round is going to be fascinating|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: When you Join a table that has voice commentary (there will always be two during the world championships), you can switch on each of the three commentators.|pg||
nt|famus: tx David|pg||
nt|pelu: the "slam" here need @S 3-2, K onside and @D 3-3|pg||
nt|ritong: which does not cancel the @c option|pg||
nt|jfeld:  well it does |pg||
nt|ritong: does it?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  because of entries|pg||
nt|eggy:  well no squeeze for +1 then as the heart threat has been thrown|pg||
nt|ritong: you have to play for QJ on, no?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|hlortz: bye|pg||
nt|famus: byee|pg||
nt|jfeld:  you can't try diamonds first then|pg||
pc|hT|nt|barnets: I am not sure of the exact carryovers but it usually depends on which team finishes higher in the round robin|pg||
nt|brolucius: West false-carded the @DQ, to mislead declarer as to the position of the @DJ.|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³yszenia,dziêki|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jaapfr: standings after this round : Neth 161 Italy 155 Israel 149 and usa2 137|pg||
nt|idc: including that last play - East realizes he can afford 2 trump losers but only if he starts on side suit immediately|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Karen great operating, thanks Henry and Tommy and all spectators for great feedback|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running scores  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl    bottom of page has links for other 2 championship events|pg||

pc|h9|nt|jfeld:  w can split|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|brolucius: But no doubt he was helped by East's switch to the @D7. |pg||
nt|barnets: tks all specs|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
nt|ady: kept the loss to 1 imp|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  19-11|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: next round in an hour|pg||
nt|petergill: A good win by the Aussies, aged 19 (Nabil Edgtton), about 26 or 27 (Paul Gosney) 33 (Nunn) and near 40 Sartaj Hans|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx all|pg||
nt|ritong: so the possible carryover between these two teams will not be huge|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||

nt|yuval10: 96 boards for both the QF and the SF, 128 for the final|pg||
nt|fluffy: things were going pretty badly for USA, but 3 swings in a row puts the match in good shape again, and still 64 boards to play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: on board 17 you go down if you start by drawing trumps, martel played what appears to me as the best line|pg||
