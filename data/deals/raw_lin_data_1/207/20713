nt|vugraphznx: in the running scores Sweden is leading by 333 imps to 0. So a lot of work to do by USA 2 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: clearly a mistake, as Sweden only had a carry-over of 3 imps|pg||
nt|hlortz: declarer exits @h k to make a trump shift harmless - no @H lead so he expects s to have the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: we are now playing the Quarter Finals. It's Knock-Out from now on|pg||
nt|hlortz: mine shows swe leading 4-0|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the carry-over is based on the result of their match in the round robin|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sweden won by 10 imps. Since USA 2 finished higher in the rankings 1/3 of the difference is the carry-over|pg||

nt|hlortz: that was a strange finesse might have lost + a @C ruff why ot just D throwing J@C for safe 10 tricks or did i miss something?|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: 11 in @h by guessing -this is more challencing|pg||
nt|rv: sry 3 card drury|pg||
nt|fluffy: nystrom's hand is good, but having the strong opening on his right is not particularilly appealing|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: well, bertheau had thought very long before taking @sQ, so he had last trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@S a save against 6 of a red suit|pg||

nt|fluffy: you want AQ10 and KJ9 when RHO opens, his hand would be wonderful if the strong hand was in his left|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psyck:  not likely to bid @h slam with two keycards missing|pg||

nt|psyck:  rite, once he found the 3@sx, they could not really go wrong|pg||

nt|runnerup: so who knew which player was thinking|pg||
nt|rv:  North's double is support showing 3@h|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: psychologically it is fine to overcome a -16 imp carryover and leading after 32 boards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as long as you are still leading after 96|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: or being close|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: also true|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 121-33 Dutch men|pg||
mb|2S!|an|!C|nt|ryskiel_: faktycznie trzeci trefelek czyma|pg||
nt|kamyk: na szczêcie atu 3-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: it was clear it was south, tray stayed long at SW side, and it was not a auction to think long for west|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: my site tells 45-109|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sheila a:  W delighted that partner didn't dbl again|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 3@C for the third board in succession|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 5-1 fit may do ok ... |pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the previous board - the jump to 4@S is fine, so maybe the 1@s overcall wasn't such a good idea|pg||
nt|barbyh: anyone know what 2 sp is?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: who I must believe?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lechcold: teoretycznie chyba @SA jest najbezpieczniejszy (o ile mo¿na mówiæ o bezpieczeñstwie)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|runnerup: ok -so no use for those anymore -bad |pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv:  for academic interest, Versace wouldn't have relished playing in 1@s double, he will struggle to make 5 tricks:)|pg||

nt|rv:  no one penalizes opponents at 1 level though:)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at Note 2 on the CC |pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphznx: South told west the wrong thing|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: but it didn't matter|pg||
nt|fluffy: best defence seems to me to force declarer with hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|fluffy: nystrom carefull won @hA to be able to return a low one had declarer got @hQ stiff|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: grue apologized when he saw the dummy, probably not happy with his own bidding|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the next set starts about an hour after this one finishes |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 20 kibs did inform me about score different but last were all 121-33 after correcting b27 (case closed pls)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is a large margin|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: pls stop informing me kibs sorry|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: on board 12 bathurst-zagorin missed the 4@h, so another 10 imps to sweden|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at least with 4@sx in the other room on the last board, Jaap doesn't need to go fetch the ketchup |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: why ketchup:)?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|rv:  I remember SA beating Italians in QFs of BB a few years back by playing unconventional bridge|pg||
nt|psyck:  the other room is even faster than here, thay are all eager to attack the lunch room|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: in the quarter finals they play 6x16 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: today and tomorrow 3 sessions of 16|pg||
nt|hlortz: so 2 full days then|pg||
nt|fluffy: it will be a long trip to the semi finals|pg||
nt|hlortz: as gonzalo said the heart tap is going to beat 3@S for sure|pg||
nt|fluffy: can't see what alternative is grue thinking about, if you don't ruff you get another heart for sure|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps thinking with @sQ to enter dummy?|pg||
nt|fluffy: in north is balanced as the bidding shows|pg||
nt|fluffy: the he probably has @sJ10 stiff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ryskiel_: a swoj¹ drog¹ - czy nie nale¿y wychodziæ asem pik?|pg||
nt|fluffy: you can still overtake @sQ if that's the case, why thinking on this trick is beyond me|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: play winners now till east ruffs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv:  sometimes you feel you can beat these guys by playing conventional bridge, they are far more accurate and better prepared than you|pg||
nt|hlortz: tired so rechecking his thinking to avoid silly mistake|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: he's saying it's an interesting hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: he had a plan, but no thinks again|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to help eat the cards - but they weren't in 3@H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rv:  can't beat|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphznx: S wants the overtrick|pg||
nt|ady: or just play 3rd round of black suit and smother east trumps|pg||
nt|panosk: somehow it feels that 3NT beter contract|pg||
nt|ady: 3rd round of spades|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fluffy: he must be seeing something I don't, well that's why he is in BB Qf and I'm comentating :)|pg||

nt|sheila a:  straightforward 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sheila a:  this is the last round of qualifying for the quarter-finals|pg||
nt|mdgraham: immediate transfer. One weakness with 2NT as transfer is that you might not know the fit if South raises North's suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: i miss 3nt bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: here East has seven diamonds, so that doesn't apply, but it might on other hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'd expect at least Axx in diamonds for 3NT|pg||
nt|barbyh: dont see how she can sit for this|pg||

nt|barbyh: right|pg||
