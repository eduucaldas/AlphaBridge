nt|mikael_w: Kevin ? Was the play worng and thats why you restarted ?|pg||

qx|c23|st||md|1SAQT86HAQ85DA6CAQ,SJ943HK96DQ85C432,S752HJ42DKT32CKJ9,SKHT73DJ974CT8765|sv|b|nt|rhelle:  Ns are playing very well; 6 plus scores on difficult hands|pg||
nt|santyclz: Other Table, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Presumably South did not want to show off, by making such an erudite play.|pg||
nt|ady: to Italy    sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: E: "@ss are always 5-0"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1 out of 100 will find he deadly @C lead imo|pg||
nt|gulyas: after the @DQ lead, he would play for the likely @DJ onside|pg||
nt|ady: long diamond can be set up before club is established for defence|pg||
nt|famus: that was odd|pg||
nt|ady: did not see the lay  but cant see how only  6 tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: its 2@S just made, so 8|pg||
nt|ady: did not see the play|pg||
nt|famus: did he go for @cs?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes -200 seems odd|pg||
nt|xenya: on 5, the Dutch NS alwso got to slam, 6@D, losing 2 imps  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 boards so far and close match.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: nice 4@H here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|idc: The other table is slow so we won't be getting comparisons for a while, Brazil will feel that slam is a potential gain|pg||
nt|antoniz: ciekawe rozdanie|pg||
nt|antoniz: 460|pg||
nt|jfeld:  For those of you interested in reading about BART: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/conventions/106-other-conventions/157-bart-modified|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  West 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  and then finding out he makes the contract|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 13 back looks like a match of big swings|pg||
nt|xenya: another slam for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C is excellent|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  think this last one will loose|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2h is supposedly 10-12, multi for weaker hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@h = 6@hs 10-12 hcp|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another interesting board. 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I can see the cards, too:) - but he may play for the @HA onside on, say, a trump lead|pg||
nt|pawel90: nam idzie 4@s - im 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: movie says plus 110 last hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: connection dropped out so maybe some data was wrong but the movie says 110|pg||
nt|famus: Hi Vincent --so it get made-good|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 4@SX-2 can be as well|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@c is strong 16+ (17 in balanced)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: Weinstein evaluates his hand too strong for 1NT opening due to good 5-card club suit and 2 aces.|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H call shows 5 spades, 4 hearts, invite values if I remember|pg||
nt|brolucius: The US South did enter on the @CK-Q-J-x-x-x hand and they then pushed E/W to 5@S for a 13-IMP swing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lost connection, up to speed now|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 4H with the right guess of S, but they lack the points to go that high|pg||
nt|lechcold: to nie bêdzie prze³omowe rozdanie chyba..|pg||
nt|psyck:  this looks like another mildly swingy board|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   can make 5@D     |pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a save for n/s|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: interesting fight here this board|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@S from west, 3@H from north, and south will bid 4@S on the basis of the sixth spade|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so will end up in 3@H now|pg||
nt|fluffy: You're back jan?|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is board 23|pg||
mc|11|nt|boedhy:  against 5@s doubled|pg||
nt|pelu: can make - but not bid 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so you were right Martin :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and this has stolen the board|pg||
nt|gulyas: SD, not DD|pg||
nt|ady: likely heart game    12 tricks maybe without diamond lead|pg||
nt|pelu: some would bid 2@S in W - but Es sk still stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: or 6 possibly|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 2nt showing a good heart raise; same thing|pg||
pg||
qx|c24|st||md|2SK965HT64DKT3CKT9,SQJT4HJ732DJ5CA63,SA732HAKQ9D96C754,S8H85DAQ8742CQJ82|sv|o|nt|santyclz: (may not)|pg||
nt|athene: so he has to have four hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: also west was more or less marked with spade ace since opponents points had to be divided|pg||
nt|ady: flat   only 1 club out   so heart finesse was safe|pg||
nt|barnets: in open room wst in 5@H on @D8 lead|pg||
nt|idc: I guess declarer could lead twice towards his clubs on a red suit lead, so can't stop him getting a 9th trick on any lead|pg||
nt|xenya: very low-scoring, yes|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@H was for me the impulse to bid 4S as S:)|pg||
nt|athene: if NS bounced to 4@S fast, east might bid on, with 5530 with spade void|pg||
nt|athene: for example 2@S 4@S and east might try 4NT or something|pg||
nt|ady: not much on here|pg||
nt|jfeld:  i stand corrected|pg||
nt|jfeld:  well done n-s|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Had to replay board 23 - and now a quick trip through the boards|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: We have a lot of difficulties in the open BBO - room --- and then we are not able to connect to that room -- so have to shut down and wait for the open room again -- SORRY AGAIN !!|pg||
nt|fluffy: the auctions you are seeing are not real auctions, since the play is at another board already vugraph operator is just palcing the contract and setting the score|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Good cash by Martel.|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie ba³ siê licytowaæ, rozgrywaæ te¿ umie...nie jest ³atwo o punkty w tych zawodach, prawda?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 12 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: aktualne wyniki: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|kamyk: ma³o estetyczne to 2@S:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@S nie lubiê..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if your afraid of partner get a new one|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: Good point. Some play that an immediate double shows values, some that it denies them.|pg||
nt|pelu: u are a chicken :):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now it is looking more likely he is short in spades - with 2-4-2-5 he might open 1nt?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Italy on the rampage 71 against hapless Brazil|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: but may just play game|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  ah, a good hand for EW|pg||
nt|ady: overcalls gettin lighter and lighter|pg||
nt|lechcold: w 22 Brazylijczycy w³adowali koñcówkê pikow¹|pg||
nt|pelu: even for Fredin this is a very light opening - 1@C could be balanced (11)12-14|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this so called opener scares me more than 2@S on previous hand|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 26 hcp   but 3NT does not look promising|pg||
nt|jcwla:  The semi-finals shall be played Tuesday and Wednesday 25 & 26 October as a knockout match of 96 boards, (3 portions, each portion comprising two 16-board sessions), with IMP scoring. Subject to the requirement that two teams from the same Countr|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brolucius: 1@S shows five and is 11-21 points. |pg||
nt|idc: On Bd 5, Levin in other room has led the same @s7 as in this room v 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: can Fallenius stop in time?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my crystal ball sees 3nt next|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3nt by E with x@H lead ok|pg||
mc|11|nt|boedhy:  yes no alert on 2@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT is not marked as forcing on their convention card.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy had an average of 24 VPs in the last 4 matches but they meet resistence here, at least until now.|pg||
nt|pelu: in Or N open and they are on rute to 4@s|pg||
nt|idc: so that seems likely to be a flat game|pg||
nt|famus: 3@Hs|pg||
nt|lechcold: rekontrê lubiê:)|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Country (if qualified) shall meet in the semi-finals, the first placed team shall also choose among the matches involving the second, third and fourth placed teams, which one will produce the semi-final opponent of the winner of its own quarter-|pg||
nt|jcwla:  match. This choice is to be made at the conclusion of the quarter final draw (before the quarter finals start). Hence the semi-final draw is decided by the first placed team prior to the quarter final stage and remains applicable even if the fir|pg||
nt|jcwla:  first place team then lose their quarter final match.|pg||
nt|fluffy: 450 looks like a HUGE score for NS|pg||
pg||
