nt|odysseus69: best lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: next|pg||
nt|josj: well, 3nt is definitely easier, with the @D behaving...|pg||
nt|sybarra: landed in better spot |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe |pg||
nt|meargent: 2@Hs is conventional|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 2@d was written on paper: limit raise, 4+|pg||
nt|meargent: 3@Ds shows limit raise|pg||
nt|timb: I',m not a fan of that 1NT opening; it fails to meet the "balanced" requirement of most people's idea of a 1NT opening|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: i do not think she has higher ambitions than 5d|pg||
nt|odysseus69: is it possible that South has jxx - North does not want to provide entry to dummy so withhods Q righly|pg||
nt|odysseus69: small diamond to 9 is the deep finesse play|pg||
pc|s5|nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
pc|s4|nt|famus: Barel has no idea--everything works for him--wud b pleasently surprised|pg||

nt|orentol: yea.. and might know they may miss major fit.|pg||
nt|dburn:  South may find the club ruff hard to believe, of course|pg||
nt|dburn:  and North ought to play the queen of hearts now, not the ace|pg||

nt|odysseus69: discarding is giving up|pg||
nt|eamongall: I would think that 2@S is rebid is on the low side given its precision but then 1@S only promises 3 card @Ss .. I better look for some convention cards |pg||

nt|sharkey: Nice switch from N|pg||
pc|dA|nt|starkist: natural way to guess the @d's at least|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: S has it difficult|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: EW big club  and many bids value "zz" points  [A=3 K=2 Q=1]  lots of relays|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  fairly vanilla 2/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: imps are converted to VPs [victory points]|pg||
nt|dburn:  since if she leads ace and another, South may try for a heart ruff and not a club ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: so England are in the game with a chance - but the problem is declarer cant get to dummy to take the finesse in @S|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and top 8 teams advance to Knockout Phase|pg||
nt|westjava: freak distribution, interesting play here|pg||
nt|blewah: @d or @h from hand is reasonable|pg||
nt|westjava: other room, Gaviard (S) not to overcall after 1@S|pg||
nt|copeyj: so i think it is down 1 regardless|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed - no real way to do that|pg||
nt|dburn:  but the defenders slightly fortunate that declarer's spades aren't solid|pg||
nt|dburn:  Rimstedt quite right to overtake the queen of hearts - North should have @hAQ doubleton to defend like that|pg||
nt|timb: It was good play to take @HA; otherwise declarer could have scrambled home|pg||
nt|timb: Interestingly at double dummy, the contract was lost at trick one; declarer had to play the @S10 or @SJ at trick one|pg||
pc|hK|nt|meargent: 6@Ds being played by italians in OR|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jbgood: looks as if the @d suit comes in in 4@h, so a normal contract turns into a good save|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: USA not X'd in the other room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: if you are bidding confidently enough, you have a good chance to push non-vulnerable opponents a bit higher |pg||
nt|yuval10: it's likely that @c's are 2-2 because both defenders were in their hand once and didn't play @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps the only possible case in which it won't apply is when South has A@c singelton, and that's what makes W thinks|pg||
nt|yuval10: if South has the A@c, and he wins and play @d, then declarer has to guess, which of course is not optimal|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps declarer could have done better if he had assured an entry to dummy  |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Barel now sighing and puffing|pg||
nt|alnanda: goedemiddag netherland.. :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: players that fail to qualify will probably play the Transnational Teams but maybe in different partnerships/teams|pg||
nt|blewah: but need a low @c from the table|pg||
nt|blewah: with 54 M she didn't consider it as balance|pg||
nt|westjava: yes she will, 2 entry on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: have to restart again, sry|pg||
nt|orentol: yea reasonable after J @s won and 9 @c ;)|pg||
nt|sharkey: West started the double finesse in @H - shud continue now and not top the suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ryskiel_: no 10 i zawsze sz³o|pg||
nt|starkist: phase 1 accomplished now make it|pg||
nt|meargent: has i said alot of noise ending in 6@Ds|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: S uncertain about bidding and if this is the right contract (6)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|barbyh: I think south is pinning his hopes on the club suit coming in|pg||
nt|alnanda: selamat malam Indonesia..|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: unblocing good idea|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|meargent: and limiting damage if she is wrong|pg||
nt|meargent: played that way after same lead in OR|pg||
nt|meargent: gordon DONT embaress me|pg||

nt|panosk: Hi Aramesh thx|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: the hand is much easier seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is the downside of using double dummy software like GIB or Deep Finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those tools cheat by looking at all the hands|pg||

pc|h9|nt|odysseus69: because 2S usually shows balanced weak hand with 4 spades South was not comfortable with that-- he  decided to blast 4S in the hope that partner had less and that oppo could make ...|pg||

nt|eamongall: some red suit work required to bring home 4@S here if they bid it |pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: i believe the other dutch pairs play Raptor NT overcalls  so North will bid 1N to show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doubt it will make any difference in final contract/result|pg||
nt|reisig: Not the toughest hand to play |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H or pass?|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@S block I think|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, must be weak|pg||
nt|panosk: 1NT not forcing?|pg||
nt|panosk: confirmed and handy in this hand :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|joanem:  better to show your 4 card suit and play the 5/2 |pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphznz: coffee hand ?|pg||
nt|josj: even better would be 1 top trumps and then @S|pg||
nt|fokal: this may make|pg||
nt|joanem: oops she has not |pg||
nt|mamos: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: The play might be interesting if they reach 3NT|pg||
nt|blewah: cue is used for limt raise+, usually in modern bridge|pg||
nt|starkist: did sharyn really get out the jack of @d?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: previous board, @h 6|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: was the lead|pg||
nt|alunand14: yes, standard and weak NT|pg||
nt|april7: interesting hand for a @S contract, depending how high they will go!without a @C lead might work for 12tricks, but not easy to find the 4th J of trumps!!|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lechcold: w 18 sorry:(|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: juz powinno byc dobrze|pg||
nt|josj: and it may go down|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: loose 1h,1d and 1c...|pg||
nt|fokal: and not start with @c|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: yes true|pg||
nt|fokal: tough board|pg||
nt|josj: hi Olivier, welcome to join into the commentary :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: my bet is on Willard... she will make this|pg||
nt|josj: I tend to agree...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the minor suit 10s and the weak hearts suggest a pass of 1NT|pg||
nt|joanem: now they will have a bad time in the 43 breaking 42 |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this can be a swing board|pg||
nt|meargent: and it aint 4th best|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: N is not sure|pg||
nt|meargent: well i am|pg||
nt|ritong: peut être ont elles une réponse pour les deux majeures|pg||
nt|eamongall: but stockdale is in there advertising her wares ...understandably |pg||
nt|eamongall: so declarer should be ok .. |pg||
nt|sharkey: As we see 3 NT makes - opportunity for the Americans next door|pg||
nt|sharkey: Vul games shud be bid if the chance of success is 37% according to the math gurus - this hand may fit in|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kiwibridge: Lall's fit showing jump shut out the @S in the other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here GeO remains silent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also 3N east  after 1@S open with Fredin passing 1st round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HT falling means 2nd stopper in the suit -- and natural attack of @C kills entry to long @H|pg||
nt|joanem: 2s much easier |pg||
nt|joanem: and jill lead |pg||
nt|odysseus69: but 2S also down|pg||
nt|ritong: et dans ce cas levin aurait opté pour 4@s, sûre d un doubleton en face|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D denies 3 hearts (else Support Dbl), hence alert (I think)|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Barbara and everyone|pg||
pc|c8|nt|joanem: the long suit with long trumps - same principle as last hand |pg||

nt|ritong: mais ces sophistications ne sont plus tellement d actualité|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: yes 2@D denied a 3 card @H|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Vincent|pg||
nt|odysseus69: assume he has shown heart shortage so West has nothing wasted although only 12 points|pg||
nt|april7: should W has opened 2 NT for the minors, its too weak though, if they even play that convention, then its easier|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbgood: only need to find the killing defense|pg||
nt|jbgood: i am told it is not difficult - but i would also say it is not difficult to bid something with GeO's hand - and he didnt:)|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi Barbara-wlc:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not so good if West had 642 of spades and J1065 of hearts- the toy worked but I am not convinced|pg||
nt|timb: I'll be away from the table for a short while; something has come up|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: nice shift|pg||
nt|alunand14: we watching the match between England (rank 1) with Indonesia (rank 4)....|pg||
nt|mamos: this might all depend on Spades|pg||
nt|copeyj: Rimstedt smelt this one out - and this is going to be uncomfortable for brock|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: just saw this one go down    Pakistan North got diamond lead   and played spade to the king and trick 2  and conceeded 2nd spade tricke and spade ruff and K@H|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: de nos jours, on dit 1SA 3SA dans les deux salles et on laisse les défenseurs se débrouiller|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D is easy , but 3NT on a @h lead looks hard-to-analyse - should make 3NT maybe?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|edou2704:  3@d is making so 3@h should be a good save if north can find the right @c play|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: ah the defence can get a Diamond ruff now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphznz: nice start|pg||
nt|josj: first hurdle surmounted|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: this looks safer   though a club is a little worry|pg||
nt|ady: if North plays the ace and draws last trump   and plays a spade  and plays the 9  and east has the queden  then a 2nd club would defeat the contract|pg||
nt|starkist: say it pepe|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: now they made up some time, easy board|pg||
nt|panosk: your comments are welcome as always|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: Inm 3NT - win @HA then spade to nine or ace - develop a 9th trick in spades while @DA is in dummy as access to long spade|pg||

nt|kjadams: west might be wondering if spade T was singleton, but unlikely to lead Q from space with Jxxx of trumps.   Best to attack with long suit with long trumps.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Nabil held too many @S to duck the Q    i think|pg||
nt|mamos: so a quietish start to the match with a few overtricks and a small partscore swing|pg||
nt|ritong: enfin, pas tout de suite|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=@S + @C/@D|pg||
nt|starkist: that would cheer up e/w if they were to guess 3n had happened other room|pg||
nt|eamongall: but 700 in total  is 12 imps to England |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ryskiel_: 4 pik? a mo¿e co innego od Piotra?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Leaping Michaels   4@D=@D and @H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H from North now standard |pg||
nt|sybarra: and an easy 3 nt here ++2|pg||
nt|meargent: the trick here is to avoid slam|pg||
nt|westjava: 10 or 11 tricks, aria?|pg||
nt|westjava: or to Felipe?|pg||
nt|blewah: i think it was 11|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will north join in?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: IF you agree to play the convention with your partner -- make sure you know if 4minor bid is forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: muller has a good hand now with 2 aces, 4 trumps and a singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: though he would prefer to have more high card points in the red suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in the other room  elAhmady running trump interesting squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and LOTS of pressure on defenders to discard properly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump to 6@D very reasonable here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know if there is any scientific way to investigate staying lower or getting higher|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: but with the hearts the way they are, even 5@d is a difficult contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4333 in N, not source of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think I remember n/s can open some wild nt bids |pg||
nt|panosk: 4th seat oppenings are guided by the rule of 15 , ot for some rule of 14, that is if the total of cards spades and points is 15 you open |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|meargent: hopefully for NS they wont find their @D fit|pg||

nt|petergill: Back on Bd 4 in 3NT - in the 6 card ending, S has to pitch something - @HJ looks like the only chance, now declarer exits in @C and the defence is awkwardly placed. Sp perhaps no ...|pg||
nt|petergill: need to guess @C10 in 3NT on Bd 4|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT weak |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C both majors|pg||

nt|drorp: other table bidding started with north opening and then rebidding clubs, so this result might be duplicated, but i didn't see how the bidding ended|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@S=slam interest @H  and 5@C=slam interest @D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the double pprobably was 4 or more spades where 1S would deny 4|pg||
nt|lechcold: eee co Ty, bilety powrotne i tak maj¹ pewnie zarezerwowane na 30-go|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT  F1|pg||
nt|alunand14: yes, this team has prepared a year ago in preparation for Sea Games on Nopember...|pg||

nt|copeyj: Sweden are in 3@D on b21 I am told|pg||
nt|copeyj: so that will be a few imps back to them|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@S i prefer from S here asking for stopper with strong hand |pg||
mb|5C|nt|kiwibridge: 14-17 and aggressive jump by Ware|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-4 zz  could have game force strength    [zz  A=3 K=2 Q=1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=a) 16-19 HCP, 5+@H  b) any 20+ HCP|pg||

nt|chmitty: encore 5imps qui vont partir|pg||
nt|ritong: car, avec trois @ss on contrerait " de soutien"|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S longer spades than hearts - else Mike Ware bids 2@D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2N T-minors |pg||
nt|timb: Well done by Simons, taking the pressure of partner|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: S thinking about 7@D...|pg||
nt|timb: This auction makes it harder for South to bid 7@D; it sounds like a guess|pg||
nt|april7: after this bidding only a partscore in @C is best|pg||

nt|ahollan1: my notes stop here :(|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: South asked about 3@S, West: let me think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe EW play the same 1@C structure as Bertheau-Nystrom  but  i don't have those 4th bids either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from one who KNOWS     3@S=it shows 3-4 zz, 5+H, 4S, void in C|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: is what west explained|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reliable source confirms my guess about 4@S/5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice stop!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump lead makes sense but probably @SK|pg||
nt|westjava: fast bid to 4@S|pg||
nt|chmitty: another chance for a small swing to France|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs asking about 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: if it's exactly 5@s an 4+ in a minor. South confirming this|pg||
nt|barbyh: prob shows a nf distributional hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
nt|meargent: from my point of view this is more than decent if NS bid it|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 sp squeaks home|pg||
nt|panosk: they wud have ended in 5@C also since no stopper|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphznz: 4h did not make at the other table....so another big chunk of imps for france|pg||
nt|josj: they were in 2nt...:)|pg||

nt|joanem: but having an 8 card beautiful diamond suit is sad to be raising clubs on 3 small  |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this link seems to work: http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live/scorebord-venice-cup|pg||
nt|mamos: not much to be said about this either|pg||
nt|petergill: Geo Tislevoll moved from Norway to Auckland New Zealand when he married Faith Mayer who lives in NZ but she sometimes play s bridge for her country of origin Philippines|pg||
nt|chmitty: not so easy to grab 9 tricks anyhow|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: 4@C=relay   4@S=3zz  4630|pg||
nt|odysseus69: many still play that 1S promises 5 and double is no more than 4 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly this pair is not afraid to bid 'em |pg||
nt|meargent: EW will have to try really hard to let this one through and i for one dont think they can do it|pg||
nt|chmitty: Bénédicte a chuté 4@c|pg||
nt|chmitty: sans doute sur le flanc AR de @h suivi de petit @s ... elle a mal deviné|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont like 3S bid|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like a gazilli auction to me...2@c=enq and 2@d is 8+  says Gad viren169 |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: so they're already doing better than the Canadian EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H played by West    so there is risk of @S ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ZZ   simply  A=3 K=2 Q=1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with trump lead can still make 12 tricks by guessing south singleton trump and ruffing finesses in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that reasonable play when contract is 5@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady still playing   21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rare situation having Muller table faster than other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D was pushed  so only imps from 1st board of the set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and potential swing here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened south hand 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: many pairs playing 4@h on this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a number of pairs play "leaping Michaels" over 3-level preempts too|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: probably not being able to show a 2-suiter over a 3@s-opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: including Sadek who alerted his 4@D overcall :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady bid 4@S and Brink 5@C!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Sweden bid the slam so 13 imps in the bag|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to wróc¹ p[iechot¹ wczeniej...i by³oby to jak najbardziej s³uszne|pg||
nt|chmitty: double dummy you do of course, but Bénédicte is not (yet) a magician|pg||
nt|chmitty: for instance is South plays another @s you must play @h to the 9, than the K from your hand ..etc..|pg||

nt|viren169: will be more careful over 2N...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|drorp: now only thought south has is weather we play 6 or 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D would show unbalanced hand  and 1N needs good 12   so deWijs had to PASS|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: running scores can be found here: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably the only pair playing a Big Club that does pass West hand|pg||
nt|joanem: a 2 over 1 sequence coming up |pg||
nt|meargent: EW play the weak NT  thus the 1@C opening|pg||
nt|blewah: multi 2@d|pg||
nt|starkist: you were one of the fledgling multi lovers pepe|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: now W asks what it means|pg||

nt|eamongall: and no entry to take @S hook |pg||
nt|april7: but on a @H continuation!|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|odysseus69: deep finesse has no problem with 5C - lesser mortals might not find it so easy|pg||

nt|westjava: the most popular bid|pg||
nt|blewah: weak2 in either M|pg||
nt|starkist: 3d must be for @s|pg||
nt|meargent: 4@Ss needs a little co operation from EW|pg||
nt|starkist: nat @h lead looks grim|pg||
nt|viren169: dble=t/out or penalties?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mamos: and B/wood should solve his problem then|pg||

nt|sybarra: or was that systemic?|pg||

nt|ritong: hi tim  hi all|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: and easy 3NT the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Meyers did not alert 3nt but Levin did|pg||
nt|joanem: jill l did not want to rebid the 6 card poor diamond suit - so 2n is better option |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and an unexpected (to me) alert|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i did not notice if she alerted 2nt bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT must be showing some extras but North sure to pass|pg||
nt|petergill: With @H 5-1, 6@H is doomed and 6@C looks best - hard to reach 6@C if S rebids 2@D and clubs becomes the 4th suit in the auction|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@S was enough I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Brown explained double as take-out|pg||
nt|viren169: still a few back to Sweden (I guess)|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like take out ...but when pard advertising 21 hcp approx can be penalty|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS playing mini-multi aka Wagner   i.e. always weak 2Major  no strong options|pg||
nt|alunand14: in OR, S opening 4@H|pg||

nt|chmitty: il faudra laminer Inde et Trinidad ... et serrer le jeu contre l'Indonésie|pg||
nt|chmitty: une équipe qui joue très très correctement et est en passe de se qualifier|pg||
nt|petergill: but fortunately South rebid 2@C so they are on their way to 6@C|pg||
nt|blewah: previous board. the same 4@s contract but Neve in N led @c5|pg||
nt|blewah: in the other room|pg||
nt|westjava: very nice lead|pg||
nt|meargent: yes she did|pg||
nt|starkist: can duck 1 @h|pg||
nt|edou2704:  in some matches the score is already significant, nederlans is leading by 80 against iceland in BB|pg||
nt|chmitty: I bet a certain % of pairs would play at the 5 or 6 level with these cards, even in a strong field|pg||
nt|viren169: 3 schools of thought here... some play it as t/out and some play it as penalties... and the rest haven't discussed it!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|drorp: yep, as much as a slam hand can be boring, this one is quite boring|pg||
nt|josj: but for us Bulletin Editors, coffee is like fuel|pg||

nt|barbyh: 9 tricks here in nt|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D to set up a GF |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: bidding tray is now removed because S needs more room for the @d length :)|pg||
nt|starkist: and the chutzpah|pg||
nt|chmitty: change the @c Jack into @s Jack to start with|pg||
nt|edou2704:  yes but what % ? slam is not good |pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - not "recipe" how to bid these hands...|pg||

nt|mamos: :(   |pg||
nt|petergill: then 3@C to show 4 clubs, GF|pg||
nt|barbyh: 6 clubs may have some difficulty|pg||
nt|copeyj: likely 3 tricks for declarer, but E/W could make 3N it hink if they could find it|pg||
nt|april7: everything works here, but still only 11 tricks available|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=a) BAL  1/2/3 NV v V 13-15 else 11-13  4th 11-14  b) 10-15 (4)5+@D  c) 10-16, any 4441|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: sry, was problem with loading this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that's the last time i'll mention that|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Muller asked for the low heart very fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek made 5@D on 22|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok Rich even for conservative like me its aiutomatic|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1S just showed balanced minimum with less than 4 spades (maybe 3 with some)|pg||
nt|dburn:  no, butit won't go six down, so if Sweden can bid 3NT at the other table...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kamyk: przegralimy 4 rozdania, ale to raptem tylko 17 imp - wystarczy jedna atomowa...|pg||

nt|meargent: carefull play will make this starting with quacking the @Hs|pg||

nt|odysseus69: I think North was talking to himself here making slam suggestions -needed a real perfecto|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lechcold: ale PAK zapakowa³ szlemika w 22|pg||
nt|petergill: The 23-0 scoreline looks like a typical All Blacks Rugby Union scoreline|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, they have a good chance at reaching 6@C if N doesn't discount his @S values too much.|pg||
nt|dburn:  whcih way?|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|timb: Neve needs to return a low diamond to hold East to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|timb: noy easy|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I was remembering Rolands instruction not to be too critical|pg||
nt|reisig: That's my job :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South must receive credit here  for 1Nt was indeed a horrid spot and 2@S  much better|pg||
nt|ritong: t as rien, ma fille|pg||
nt|ritong: dis 5@d paisiblement|pg||
nt|copeyj: can be down 6 now but they would have to defend well|pg||
nt|copeyj: would be a funny flat board - 3N tick and 1@D down 6|pg||
nt|dburn:  no way for Smith to tell who has the last diamond|pg||
nt|copeyj: they are in 2@D next door|pg||
nt|timb: not easy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: pleasant little hand with @H's 2/1  and @D ace on side etc |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant @H's 2/2 |pg||
nt|meargent: not to mention the 32 @C break|pg||
nt|westjava: to avoid dummy entry|pg||
nt|edou2704:  4NT seems to be the limit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: do we know what 2NT showed |pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like good bidding to me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: south opened 1@D showing @H and thus they dived over 4S, here NS silent|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|ritong: well, mate|pg||
nt|chmitty: le fait que Est n'ait pas dit 2@h ne leur facilité pas la séquence|pg||
nt|starkist: too much handling I thk|pg||
nt|meargent: sorry carefull defence will beat this|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ryskiel_: nie wiedzia³em ,¿e tylu specjalistów od japoñskiego zsaiada na balkonie - nie mogê siê ogoniæ od kolejnych wersji  |pg||

nt|ritong: i guess we re done for the frenglish emergency|pg||
nt|starkist: so far not unblock the @h king is good|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I just noticed that bidding has continued- well South has great controls - the problem is that North does not have enough  for his bidding|pg||
nt|eamongall: so a hesitation double is penalties :) |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bouncer: nice|pg||
nt|petergill: True, you need a 12th trick, so the play of 6@c will be interesting|pg||
nt|wstuart: They should be OK in 6@C; draw trumps, one @h goes on the @SA, and ruff teh 4th @D.|pg||
nt|petergill: Do you rely on @H 4-2 or do you ruff two spades in S hand, keeping @SA to control the suit? |pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I miscounted, there are 12 easy tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT 1430 |pg||
nt|panosk: needs some cautious tackling though|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphznz: yeah, ruffing 1@S is enough|pg||
pc|s2|nt|grebrof: N has no problems with Ss @h-sidesuit|pg||
pc|s7|nt|starkist: could have won jack of @d|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

pc|h4|nt|jbgood: and down GeO goes|pg||
nt|jbgood: i am toold that he can still make it - i dont agree|pg||
nt|reisig: Next|pg||
nt|copeyj: but not any more|pg||
nt|dburn:  perhaps not|pg||
nt|copeyj: England gained 8 on b22 when Sweden tried 3N next door which went down 2|pg||
nt|dburn:  declarer can guess hearts now for down three, but England will pick up 5 IMPs at least|pg||
nt|dburn:  unless declarer doesn't play anything at all, of course, which may restrict the loss to the 3 IMP slow play penalty|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: the American EW have overbid slightly there|pg||
nt|jbgood: *told|pg||
nt|starkist: ohhhhh|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North realised he had done too much and baled out in time|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: they never overbid, overbid was if they bid slam here :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's their style to push for a marginal games|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can ruff with A|pg||
nt|odysseus69: those who laugh at 4 card major systems should always watch where partner cant support clubs|pg||
nt|blewah: but Gaviard shifted to @h not @d after winning with @cK|pg||
nt|blewah: so, another push|pg||

pc|dT|nt|meargent: reus is finished screwing arround she wants to find out if she can make this contract|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: North explained 2@d as Majors. East asked 5-5, North said could be 5-4|pg||
nt|wstuart: I wonder if West will start with the @SJ instead of the @H5?|pg||
nt|petergill: 8 tricks in 2NT on NS cards = just right for NZ|pg||
mb|3N|nt|odysseus69: no just the hearts - 52.5%|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: they settled for game very quickly|pg||
nt|meargent: doesnt matter how many it promises shirley as long as south leads an honor|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: West is really going to like this splinter|pg||
nt|meargent: good news here was canada didnt miss the @S game in the OR|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D will work nicely, although E/W can make 11 in @D it hk|pg||
nt|ritong: can go down before declarer regains the lead|pg||
nt|timb: EW need the obvious (to us) two club ruffs|pg||
nt|ritong: will|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: upmark will continue with noises that get more info|pg||

nt|chmitty: au bridge tout peut aller très vite|pg||
nt|petergill: Mike Ware does not like (to put it mildly)  2NT as a contract - personally he would rather be in 3NT almost always - except for this hand :)  |pg||
nt|wstuart: EW are playing attitude leads vs NT.  However, I am suprised West didn't lead low from 3 since he hadn't raise.d|pg||
nt|petergill: If you guess @DJ after @HK, @H10 ducked, you can make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: same bidding as open room|pg||

nt|eok: see my email?|pg||
nt|barbyh: north has to decide whether west has 6 or 7 clubs|pg||
nt|barbyh: if 6  north has to duck the first club trick|pg||
nt|petergill: even if there is a spade switch at Trick 3|pg||
nt|petergill: as is likely with E being almost entryless|pg||
nt|dburn:  final contract unlikely to be three diamonds at the other table - and whatever it is instead may very well be doubled|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a great deal - scope for a double game swing is there for sure|pg||
nt|panosk: low required from W|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: can N somehow tell his partner to choose the longer major?|pg||

nt|drorp: 2 way CB action, planning to pass 2@D|pg||
nt|mamos: safe partscore|pg||
nt|drorp: once east bid 1NT he has guaranteed 4 diamonds because they only open 1@D with 3 when they have 44 in the majors, and with that east would support spades, so Gino chooses the safe ...|pg||
nt|drorp: 8 card minor fit as his partscore|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|ritong: ujn petit ballon d oxygene  il etait temps|pg||

nt|sharkey: This shud be 7 IMPs to US - North's artificial 2@C stole the suit in OR|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yuval10: W wins with the K and play J@C and another one, then declarer will know exactly where KQ@d and Q@s are|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer isnt down just yet|pg||
nt|eamongall: they said ... it was very efficiently organised |pg||
nt|viren169: oh dear... this is not good...|pg||
nt|eamongall: good for sweden |pg||
nt|april7: its a better contract thogh, but I think N should have bid 2 @S, although she makes 10 tricks in @H!!!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|davidstern: Club club ruff with @HA and spade towards jack what can the defece do now|pg||

nt|viren169: Good (safe) lead|pg||
nt|eamongall: I reckon another @H card is required in the North hand for GF natural|pg||
nt|eamongall: like the @HJ |pg||
nt|viren169: 1@H is enough with North's hand...|pg||
nt|eamongall: or the @HK|pg||

nt|garden2005: no ale w meczu gra siê na obk³ady|pg||
nt|lechcold: tak|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that East was too good for 3C whatever it showed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|davidstern: A diamond lead would have been much better for the defence|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or a heart continuation to prevent a dummy reversal also|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am prepared to bet a coke that declarer will prevail|pg||
nt|davidstern: A heart now is best though|pg||
nt|yuval10: can still make with an intra-finesse in @d ( @d to the 9, followed by the J@d that crush the T )|pg||
nt|blewah: 8 tricks so far|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: note for ZZ    downgrade singleton K  and Q(x)|pg||

nt|josj: it can be ruffed after 2 rounds of trumps but I am not sure that is the best line|pg||

pc|h6|nt|jkotor: dobry wist|pg||

nt|blewah: S could be endplayed for the 9th|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: sorry only 9 by good defence!!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|josj: declarer might as well go for both the finesses: low to the @SQ and low to the @DK and later the @DJ|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: you are right Jos..can be a danger|pg||
nt|josj: trump lead was excellent|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 5 hearts, 3 clubs and 1 spade obvious|pg||
nt|mamos: the Diamond switch has simplified matters |pg||
nt|petergill: S deduced from @H7 (choice of pip) lead that @HA was 100% for sure in East, so he could afford to play @HJ|pg||
nt|westjava: mb, to get a tenace @D|pg||

nt|timb: The Italian open team made 4@H played by SOUTH on the previous deal; West did not find the Pabis Ticci lead of @CA, though I like to think I might have|pg||
nt|ritong: this (obvious) lead solves one of declarer's problems|pg||
nt|ritong: although she is not aware about it yet|pg||
pc|c7|nt|davidstern: I am assured that Barel is not known for slow play|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK so closed room 1NT -1 and this room 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: with balanced hands they rebid 1NT even with 4@s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: live scores in all divisions can be seen here http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, 2 rounds of trumps and then @C is not bad at all; if anyone ruffs she will be on play...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very low scoring match   with netherlands picking up overtrick imp on last 2 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice fitting hands for EW|pg||
nt|joanem: so the US gals in other room did bid the slam on brd 8 viaa good 2 over 1 sequence with splinter in diamonds  |pg||
nt|mamos: The English NS played 1NT after a two way Club and a NT rebid on Board 7   and indeed the Indonesian defence took the foirst nine red tricks for a good swing and the match lead|pg||
nt|ritong: meyers va réveiller|pg||
nt|blewah: interesting choice of reopening|pg||
nt|westjava: fasten seat belt pls...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hurd and Wooldridge are certainly slower than average|pg||
nt|jkotor: przez trefle chyba najlepiej|pg||
nt|petergill: Good auction by Kamil - Fleisher to 6@C: 1@h - 2@C artificial GF allowed S to show his hand to North, leading to 6@C|pg||
nt|panosk: dont much like E douvle withouth 4 spades , but just my taste|pg||
nt|panosk: *double|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ryskiel_: lekko nie bêdzie|pg||

nt|wstuart: should make on the @C finesse now.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: am i seeing things or Did East really bid 3S|pg||
nt|chmitty: as we can see, EW have a good contract at @h mais none of the players cand bid this suit safely|pg||
nt|alunand14: yup !|pg||

nt|odysseus69: and good save by USA|pg||
nt|petergill: This lead gives the extra entry for the black suit finesses|pg||
pc|c8|nt|drorp: good pass by chagas on 2@S, soft 15 count no realy chance of making game, and here comes the trump lead which is often the right lead in those kind of partscore auctions, specially ...|pg||
nt|drorp: with good holding in opener's 2nd suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver opened weak 2@D North   that will make it tougher for the Egyptians|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nabil's heavy 2@D bid may give deWijs problems|pg||
nt|jkotor: na pocz¹tek oczywicie|pg||
nt|mamos: two flat hands - declarer has to work hard  for her three NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: really|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|reisig: OK ..talk to each other ..for a while :)|pg||
nt|petergill: An ultra-dynamic (Zia in his youth?) opening lead of @HJ might work wonders |pg||
nt|sharkey: West's 3@H shows a hand limit raise or better in @S - 3@S would have been more preemptive type|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: this should be a quick 1 down|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like no swing here|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, they stopped 2 levels lower -- but wrongsided|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes the CR had the joy of the @D10 lead from west|pg||
nt|ritong: et tout le monde aura fait son boulot|pg||
nt|meargent: i know that feragami and partner played that forcing|pg||
nt|sharkey: But US bid 4@H OR so looks like 6 IMPs to US and r\the lead narrows to 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|timb: She is now|pg||
nt|ritong: the total number of losers has brutally shrinked|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: Cullin won't go -3 now|pg||
nt|edou2704:  EW have a good @h fit, but not so easy to find when Willard bid 1@s, some would double 1@d|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: but N might continue with the @CQ now|pg||
nt|edou2704:  she could have reopen 2@h also|pg||

nt|timb: @DQ did not threaten declarer|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: note Fallenius 3rd seat "multi" 2@C opener which includes a weak 2@D hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H was reached in other room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East bid sensibly in OR - first showed clubs then splintered in diamonds|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: now ok |pg||
nt|westjava: 10 imps for 3nt = -1 other room, previous board|pg||

nt|drorp: diamond switch was necessary now though, but hard for east to know that dummy's clubs gonna be good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mcavoy did well to stay out of auction   cullin won't be able to read distribution|pg||
nt|meargent: thof course the 1@D opening lead to a very playable contract and a probable 1imp pickup for canada:)|pg||
nt|ritong: intraitable|pg||
nt|wstuart: I tihnk a low @H, cashing 3@H and then exiting a @D would also work.|pg||

nt|chmitty: @s and @h sry|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@h shows already 5 cards in the suit|pg||
nt|chmitty: I believe Sylvie will bid 4@s now|pg||
nt|edou2704:  in other VC matches : usa2 +40 vs indonesia ; england +35 vs sweden ; netherlands =13 vs usa1|pg||
pc|c2|nt|drorp: east decided to upgrade his hand to an 18-19 balanced hand, not sure it would be my choice, but rebidding 2@C isn't that appealing either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for me   south hand is either a 2@S or 2N rebid depending on partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is not good enough strength or shape for 3@C|pg||

nt|odysseus69: maybe 4C is natural - some play that 3S over 3H agrees hearts and 4C is just natural|pg||
nt|edou2704:  netherlands +13 vs usa1|pg||
nt|dburn:  not sure what any of this means, to be honest|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|meargent: it probably will make:(|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT superaccept, 3@H re-transfer|pg||

pc|d5|nt|vugraphznz: 3 clubs to loose..and 2 spades...anything else?|pg||

nt|odysseus69: easier to play NT - this will take longer|pg||
nt|joanem: but remember the gals are faster|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: lol|pg||
nt|joanem: i woudl expect hearts to be breaking 4/2 after the X and be less likely to raise hearts  to 2 - also like my 5 clubs for nts|pg||
nt|lechcold: znowu szlemowe rozdanie|pg||
nt|starkist: actually @d down on @c lead|pg||
nt|meargent: not that i would do so with that east hand too strong for me|pg||

nt|odysseus69: another hand where biddin too much costs- I dont think North hand qualifies for 2C|pg||

nt|lontoh 63: howdy|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think 4@h-4@S now perhaps|pg||
nt|copeyj: just 4@S and that should end matters|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: this will probably make -- foe 5 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|petergill: I guess the longest suit @H's has least to lose?|pg||
nt|wstuart: Many pairs will bid a doubleton as their preaccept - unless the doubleton is the suit just below their trump suit which would prevent pard from re-xfring|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S still looks doomed, even after this lead|pg||
nt|edou2704:  4@s is a reasonable contract|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: cover to encourage @C finesse??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and i think same @C/@H layouts |pg||

nt|vugraphznz: might lead a heart first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: difference in other room though   @S to Queen Ace, lose @C, then @SK @S|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: and if not take the @c finesse|pg||

nt|eamongall: a spec reckons Brown and Stockdale want to play every contract .. |pg||
nt|viren169: dont have 4 losers but dont have 10 tricks here either |pg||
nt|viren169: South will probably try and ruff a @C and pitch one on the @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: the delay in the 4D bid suggests a possible doubt about the meaning of 4C - maybe I am completely wrong|pg||
nt|wstuart: Leading from the K in the 4 card suit is a little safer than lead from the Kx or the Kxxxxx.|pg||
nt|april7: now E will make 8 tricks|pg||

nt|viren169: @c now?|pg||
nt|dburn:  these days, many play that 3@h shows three hearts whereas 3NT (or 3@s with five) does not|pg||
nt|eamongall: stockdale needs to ruff @Cs and draw trumps at the same time ... its a tough life as they don't let you play 2 cards at once |pg||

pc|dQ|nt|petergill: The doubleton bid helps the defence a lot - it can be better to bid in such a way that declarer's hand less "known" to the defenders. |pg||

nt|wstuart: that will get them to 6@S.  However, east is going to bid slam himself, and west will likely raise to 7 based on his likely source of tricks in @C.|pg||
nt|petergill: When playing against opponents who play a Forcing Pass over 5@D, maybe 4@d causes more problems for EW than 5@d does. I know it's normal to preempt to the max with a good fit, but ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D - 4@s makes East guess if West is stretching to bid 4@S or not. |pg||
nt|ritong: first being that introducing boss suit is often rewrded|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: 6@c looks like a decent contract which makes on a good day. not today, though|pg||
nt|xenya: but if they do, 6@C is clearly better -- looking at the NS hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: south was reaching for 3@c over 2@s, but put it back|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2nd negative perhaps?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: lool|pg||
nt|odysseus69: either major works|pg||
nt|westjava: when can not?|pg||
nt|blewah: if they play lebensohl or some sort, that 3@c is weak|pg||
nt|ritong: well, perhaps the @s lead will turn out good, if raise is not possible|pg||
nt|starkist: and a 4 card major on the side|pg||
nt|meargent: notice souths pass under 20 points is an automtic pass after partner makes a pre emptive minor raise|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: it is as N says; there is everything wrong with my bid|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is not the sort of deal sweden need i don't think|pg||

nt|barbyh: not a good result|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: looks like 1100 and 16 imps USA|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps EW were worried about bad breaks, given how high NS bid on so little|pg||
nt|odysseus69: here 3c is 1 down but it gives N/S a chance of a plus if E-W press on|pg||
nt|viren169: and West with a 4333 min wont go on|pg||
nt|eamongall: 52-3 in imps this set ... they gone into the lead by about 12 |pg||
nt|eamongall: think its time to fire up a 2nd laptop as I am staying here to watch Stockdale and Brown |pg||
nt|ritong: at first sight 3@s is a make, so this slightly offtrack opening seems to lead to a positive result|pg||

nt|joanem: hard to make the discards on the clubs that;s probably where the 10th trick came from in other room? |pg||
nt|blewah: E trusts the auction|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: players explained all bids were natural from 2@s|pg||

nt|drorp: east playing the safe way for 3 spade tricks, and gets rewarded|pg||
nt|mamos: THAT HAS WORKED WELL|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: Ware should have 4@h and 5@c for his bids, so GeO was right in passing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room contract much better than this|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there'll be a post mortem for sure|pg||
nt|timb: it rules out 3NT :(|pg||
nt|panosk: indeed @C 5 maybe indicate diamonds but bear in mind nothing is compulsory, just indicative|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wstuart: There's a whole class of conventions which haven't been fully explored by the laws.  For instance, some pairs (including EW at thsi table) play (3@D)-P-(5@D)-P as a forcing pass.|pg||
nt|kareno: In a BB match I was watching n/s got to 3nt under their own steam, not doubled and down one :)|pg||

nt|eamongall: 62-3 it is reported to China this set |pg||
nt|april7: N might bid 1 @S over1 @H|pg||
nt|panosk: @S lead  in open led to 4@H+1|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: brazil pulled back 2 overtrick imps on 25, defense done well to limit 2@S to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: what do you bid with N after 1@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i vote for that to be last room crash|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=(3)4+ unbal|pg||
nt|garden2005: kamyk*|pg||
nt|wstuart: The interesting thing is that if NS know ahead of time that a pass of 5@D is forcing, they could perhaps extract more out of a hand when they have a 6@D bid by just bidding 5@D.|pg||
nt|wstuart: However, you have to be aware of the opps methods ahead of time.|pg||
nt|starkist: or fold at poker|pg||
nt|edou2704:  should play @h or @s game|pg||
mb|1D|nt|meargent: 1@C 1D! 2NT 3NT ?|pg||
nt|edou2704:  5@hX -2 in other room, a good result for france|pg||
nt|chmitty: an agressive 1@s overcall by Feng pushed the French to the 5 level here|pg||
nt|eamongall: but Italy can do massive imps when the going gets tough |pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: 1NT in this vul, pass in opposite vul perhaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  3@D-DBL-P-4@H|pg||

nt|chmitty: Lu will be puzzled ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Don't think S will invite to game here so likely a push...|pg||
nt|ritong: downsides are you immediately cancel 3NT and lisome about defensive potential, upside is it could be opponent's hand and they have less room to move|pg||
nt|ritong: lie some*|pg||
mb|1S|nt|meargent: ahh a convention|pg||
nt|starkist: or let me merge|pg||
nt|viren169: Good result from the Open  Room here|pg||
nt|eamongall: Anyway back to Stockdale and Brown ... and their Swedish opponents |pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: i wonder if south will invite to game, i wouldn't on a vul 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: wow|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what now for North?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: splinter?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: well...she is thinking|pg||
nt|joanem: splinter |pg||
nt|ritong: alerte= garantit 4 cartes|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think with AKQxx in @C, that west was at least good enough for 6@H, if not 7@S directly.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and 1NT did work better putting me in my place|pg||
nt|odysseus69: again 2H = H + minor |pg||
nt|odysseus69: now because he bid ast time with a 7 count he will know that partner will not be doing same- |pg||
nt|odysseus69: he may bid 2NT to ask for minor then ??|pg||
nt|chmitty: quite usual defence against strong clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: X not alerted S (but by N)|pg||
nt|copeyj: England lead by 58 with 6 boards to compare - and b27 doesn;t look like swing potential|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: what about 6@c?|pg||
nt|meargent: on 2nd thought 6@Cs?|pg||
nt|mamos: this wont be a success though|pg||
nt|mamos: unless North does something odd|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: N asks now already for 2nd time to E if 3@c is really a 6+ card @c; YES|pg||
nt|kareno: The pass by Dianna Gordon could prove expensive on this deal.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no upgrade for those nice Clubs?:)|pg||
nt|drorp: i mean i would bid game directly|pg||
nt|mamos: ah :)  that I agree with :)|pg||
nt|drorp: 2@h slightly wild, but in this vul and with pretty solid trumps, it's not dangerous (although i dont see an upside to it aswell)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north hand not getting better|pg||
nt|mamos: nope:(|pg||
nt|ritong: les américains sont légèrement plus procéduriers que nous|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's easy looking at all 4 hands, I know, but surely he was worth at least a try with that @C suit.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South will bid on for sure|pg||
nt|panosk: i like 3@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pawel90: jak otwieraj¹ do 8 punktów blokiem to zdecydowanie mia³|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: puppet to 2@D useful tool|pg||

nt|kamyk: dzien dobry (dobry?)|pg||
nt|granguru:  started unblocking|pg||
nt|kareno: I said that before south (obviously naturally) passed.|pg||
nt|timb: Over the years I have found preemptive style is very much a personal style; I'm a very aggressive bidder but  a less agressive pre-empter|pg||
nt|ritong: there also are tactical considerations|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: Kalita ze wzglêdu na trefle nie powinien pytaæ o asy - po 4 kierach jak sugerowa³em chyba by stanê³i w 6 BA|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: hurd asked about the diamond length of 1@d before bidding 2@d. 1@d = 4 unless west has 4432|pg||

nt|lechcold: -5:(|pg||
nt|lokaty: tak czy siak, dok³ad przed parti¹ z tym to moim zdaniem gruba przesada.|pg||
nt|joanem: 4c?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: with a club more and a heart less slam would be good -South not interested -the spade suit was a dampener|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzieñ taki sobie Karolu:(|pg||
nt|jkotor: Danusia siê niczego nie boi!! kto jeszcze wszed³by z karty N?|pg||
nt|lechcold: szansa na 5 punkcików|pg||
nt|petergill: As is his usual style, Mike Ware goes for blood against the weak 1NT |pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont believe that- N orth did well and South could hardly have any more|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder what 1N showed|pg||
nt|ritong: when you are on a rush, for example, you may want to brutalize opponents more than usual|pg||
nt|ritong: even more, that is|pg||
pc|hA|nt|grebrof: not sure dbl at N is the right decision . but ok, I can understand|pg||
nt|mamos: just making sure partner knows your suit is Hearts ?:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Better to open that rag because it is 5/4 with good cards in your suits.|pg||
nt|meargent: and that tony is the argument for passing that north hand|pg||
nt|starkist: I open light and pass that hand|pg||
nt|viren169: need a @D shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: to have a chance to defeat this...|pg||
nt|panosk: as opposed to 4@C that some may prefer|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: not going to take long to play|pg||
nt|drorp: he has 5 and a half defensive tricks, he wants to play 2@H double if south has a hand that planned to pass either 2@s or 2@d|pg||
nt|mamos: quicker than I could type it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could be the worst lead for defense|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this match so far has been all about bidding - and thats where the points come from|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 3@H explained as 5+@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@S inferior to 1 NT so likely 1 or 2 IMPs to US here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Could go down with prefect defence |pg||
nt|sharkey: *perfect|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: @DQ 2nd worst|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Cullin will be punished for his DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was going to be hard for Upmark to find @C lead either way|pg||
nt|timb: I think 4@H is too much; 2@S engenders cooperation (and I a fan of the Bourke/Wolff/Landy game try method - bid a game and then try to make it :))|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will be only 3rd non-overtrick swing|pg||
nt|sharkey: West has to duck|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphznz: South looking at me, trying to see how it goes I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which puts declarer under most pressure now   @C or @S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: divine guidance or the other kind?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: they dont seem to agree|pg||
nt|petergill: If @S9 was played from dummy, Geo Tislevoll would have ducked  |pg||
nt|wstuart: The weak NT sort of force the action.|pg||
nt|wstuart: You can't sit back and pass with your own strong NT, so you have to get in and DBL and the IMPs can start flying in either direction.|pg||
nt|petergill: On paper, this is the strongest NZ team I've seen in ages. Last year there was a controversy when this NS pair were not selected in the NZ team after they came in the top three ...|pg||
nt|petergill: pairs in Pairs Trials. |pg||
nt|viren169: good effort!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kareno: I open light and open it.  Live by the sword, die by the sword.|pg||
nt|edou2704:  oh ! very good for china|pg||
pc|h5|nt|meargent: this is a good canadian slam @Cs and @Ds breaking with @DK onside|pg||
nt|jkotor: jakie 5 punkcików? w obronie 5@c?|pg||
nt|kamyk: po grze wielu obecnych bryd¿ystów sportowych widac, ¿e nie zaczynali od gry na pieniadze:)|pg||

nt|joanem: happy to run it to the Q in 4, but.....|pg||
nt|wstuart: Many DBLs at IMPs are actually more defensive in nature - you have to protect potential game scores in other contracts rather than trying to kill the opps.|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's really rather rare that you simply know that the opps have made a big mistake.|pg||

nt|ritong: when east is marked with @c AQ10|pg||

nt|ritong: so, he will pmake this effortless|pg||

nt|starkist: I would expect extreme distribution to jump in later|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: you may not have a second chance...|pg||

nt|sharkey: Previous board unfortunate for Indonesioa - systemically S had to bid 2@S - cudnt stop at 1 NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: my keyboard is off a little - sry :)|pg||
nt|alunand14: 1NT F1|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised EW didnt bid game OR - US will bid this I think|pg||
nt|barbyh: very lucky game to make|pg||
nt|barbyh: but not so likely with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR East bid 2 NT to describe NT shape and strength of her hand - cud perhaps also have bid 4@C - if this had shown Majors|pg||
nt|april7: another 4@H contract, this time from N and making 11 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: except on a @H lead|pg||
mb|1H|nt|drorp: and if partner has values, he sees the vul aswell, he pulls it out (like he did)|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: West doesn't know what 3@C is..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my note from CC says  ASK nt stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: I think I heard him say natural...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 3rd hand where only tarzan passes|pg||
nt|starkist: wish my pards could stay quiet in those situations|pg||
nt|alnanda: tueje have AJ@h 4 card, why worry to tak K@h with A then play J..:(|pg||
nt|mamos: i think many might bid 4@c with that|pg||

nt|copeyj: which is 4@H and 15+|pg||
nt|ritong: operator, do we confirm board 12 result?|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: 12 corrected 4 @H made|pg||
nt|ritong: merci|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: i bet this table will be the 1st one in the room finishing the set, they've played 12 boards in just about an hour so far|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think basically you should have a @h-stopper for the 1nt-bid anyway - the dbl mainly shows length and it is a suggestion only - S wasnt fooled to pass :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3major openings normally asks for aces in Ps hand - S has everything|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: now he writes down, aks for stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fallenius in 6@H South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D or 5@D?|pg||

nt|panosk: if 3@C preemptive ok, but if not prefer 3@H like in other room, 3@C bergen or whatever promises alittle help in defence which S doesnt have|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphznz: coffee hand ?  lol|pg||
nt|josj: good idea after all the excitement|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 4 loosers and thats it..this has to be a coffee hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now East chose not to bid 3NT|pg||

nt|petergill: Seniors: Australia back into 8th place with 62 imp lead over Argentina |pg||
nt|copeyj: and 3@S from Smith showing a singleton @S (void @S would have done something else)|pg||
nt|april7: @H ace lead is ofcourse not obvious!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm told 6@H probably going down|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what is range of 1NT?|pg||
nt|kareno: lol|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think they will play 6@H|pg||
nt|dburn:  this is an OK slam - when trumps are 3-2, the chance to avoid two diamond losers is good enough|pg||
nt|april7: but after the @H raise it becomes more possible than after 4 @C and 4@H by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and i was just trying to decide if 6@C has any problems|pg||
nt|lokaty: 7 impów - takiego swingu jeszcze nie mielimy:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: in the open room 4 sp was dbld and made|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: propably N's chewing gum helps|pg||
nt|copeyj: because 1@D opening is either 18-19 balanced or unbalanced for them, they don't need the 2N rebid as natural (they use 1N as a sort of gazilli after 1@D-1M)|pg||
nt|copeyj: time for Brock to wheel out her trusty friend|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: no comment :)|pg||
nt|meargent: this hand is not a triumph for transfers|pg||
nt|meargent: although 4@Ss should be beat no matter who plays it|pg||
nt|jkotor: uciekam, papa, powodzenia!|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Luckily problemed fixed now|pg||
nt|ritong: fine|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: but i couldnt follow the play, dummy with still A QT A8 Q9|pg||
nt|ritong: never mind|pg||
nt|kareno: Perhaps a few explanations of the private jokes would help the specs :)|pg||
nt|starkist: why should I be the only one with nightmares|pg||
nt|starkist: bo is in spec he can explain|pg||
nt|sharkey: BBO Kibs will make this easily....|pg||
nt|copeyj: old blackers|pg||
pc|hK|nt|starkist: yes good that west didn t get involved|pg||
nt|meargent: at least if north plays 4@Ss the  hand should go faster|pg||
nt|petergill: Seniors : Strong Poland team only 2 VPs from leading the event now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: East has 6 tricks already with 4 cards left Dummy - Q 8 Q9|pg||
nt|viren169: I assume 1@S denied spades?|pg||
nt|dburn:  1@s showed no major, usually balanced|pg||
nt|april7: @C to ace and @S J|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: first you have to reach 6@s, then you have to make|pg||
nt|yuval10: not easy indeed, was played well in the OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know how they play their passed hand sequences :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 2@D specifically asked   of trump|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: well, i gave the information the players were telling. They will probably know :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 2@d was more or less forced|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i think 13-15|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i do not know|pg||
nt|lechcold: na razie..|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziêku Kuba|pg||

nt|kareno: Great lead!|pg||
nt|copeyj: 5@C 0/3 and Brock will bid 5N and Smith will sign off I thk|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: if the play record is correct, S won 4@s in the other room - 2 down may be a wrong entry |pg||
nt|sharkey: no - wont make |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|grebrof: with the @hs 3-3 this would be an undebid with this lead|pg||
nt|meargent: en fin|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ...i poszed³:)|pg||
nt|dburn:  no real way to ask about Smith's diamond suit - but this is the percentage action on what she knows so far|pg||
nt|ritong: yes sure  been there  terrible|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: he has 6@s, he has a @d super stopper, but he elects a third possibility with @h xx  strange|pg||
nt|petergill: The 5-0 break stops only the overtrick, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|wstuart: I know he had already showed some type of stopper with 2NT, but after 3@H he could have said he was a little happier about his @S holding.|pg||
nt|starkist: down 2|pg||
nt|starkist: oh|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like new leaders again|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: Cullin's 4/5 approach good save against game but very lucky he didn't push them to a makeable slam|pg||
nt|copeyj: well she now knew Smith didn't have @DK|pg||
nt|copeyj: so knew grand could not be good|pg||
nt|dburn:  sure - this was a good, controlled auction|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: i had this auction in my notes but no others, so didn't know options/alternative replies|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in 3NT if declarer plays spade to 9 (unlikely) after ace of hearts then North has to switch to diamond|pg||
nt|chmitty: declarer will have to guess @c now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|drorp: running the diamond with 10 top tricks could've been seen a bit embarassing if it went K@D, @D ruff, @C to A and @D ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: Geo was worried about inducing a @D lead if he suggested very strong spades via 3NT - and what if partner has Kx in @D?|pg||
nt|wstuart: it's not clear he can't make an overtrick anyway?|pg||
nt|chmitty: and probably won't|pg||
nt|timb: I have a view on leading trumps and not leadin the suit partner has opened or overcalled; it must be "right"' - not that another choice didn't matter; the alternative had to be a ...|pg||
nt|timb: winner|pg||
nt|april7: it comes to late!!|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|copeyj: win in hand, 3 rounds of @H ending in dummy, @DA and claim I should think|pg||
pc|c9|nt|grebrof: well |pg||
pc|c2|nt|drorp: but the chances of that were very slim, and not all saftey plays are worth while, losing 1 imp every time is costly also|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it does look like he made 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek playing 3N West|pg||
nt|petergill: but Wayne still has a good point, though it's arguable|pg||
nt|edou2704:  it was better to not cover the !10 at 2nd trick|pg||
nt|edou2704:  @d 10|pg||
nt|ritong: so, in slam we are|pg||
nt|timb: that is the trump lead had to be a winner or not leading partner's suit had to be a winner|pg||

pc|s5|nt|jbgood: so am I|pg||
nt|starkist: this works also I guess|pg||
nt|ritong: jet pasman will quickly drive to the conclusion that @c A on is needed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: what do you think, yuval?|pg||
nt|wstuart: it's true, @D were scary, but S had to have something somewhere, and it wasn't in @H or @S.|pg||
nt|ritong: find it right, +13|pg||
nt|timb: Playing with my wife many years ago, I led trumps on two successive boards. Knowing my views the second trump lead distracted her. I said at the end of the second deal "What was ...|pg||
nt|timb: the trump lead?" She said "The winnning lead"|pg||

nt|dburn:  might have won the first club on the table, to keep the king as an entry to play diamonds rather than having to cross to the ace of spades|pg||
nt|panosk: counting in @C very important from S and she did |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: @D lead against 3N  for declarer's 9th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: has a lot of options now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: playing for @h 3-3, @cK onside or squeezes / endplays|pg||

pc|c8|nt|meargent: draw trumps and go down like a man|pg||

pc|dK|nt|yuval10: i think 3@c also caused some troubles|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing off the trumps stops any danger of E getting 2 ruffs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chmitty: two down now ... South will be squeezed|pg||
nt|dburn:  but the third heart will do as well|pg||
nt|ritong: ole|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @HQ smother jack  needs extra entry to dummy to pickup suit for no loss|pg||

nt|april7: nice trial bid, but with 3 losers in @D W will only bid 3 @H I suppose|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yuval10: here both N treated their hand has a 7-carded, quite natural when partner is passed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D could have game force strength but 0-4 zz|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: eas has 7 tricks...so coffee hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Bermuda Bowl  for Iceland   after  2@D [weak major]  Jonsson bid 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: ofc it's just a small chance - why not go for it?|pg||
nt|kareno: There's nothing more than a possible IMP on this board.|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: live results: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl|pg||
nt|starkist: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=882|pg||
nt|eamongall: 67-6 after 10 innings in Italy China match ....to China |pg||
nt|sharkey: Timid by the American ladies....?|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 hts seems a bit understated|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: again for ina ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@H minimum|pg||
nt|dburn:  so this is a minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: W took some view to leave 3@h X with 4-4 @s fit|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H puts real pressure on EW|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Newell and Reid have relayed to slam here|pg||
nt|pawel90: 4@s chyba nie idzie po kierowym|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not the ideal dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  hand 11 will be on defensive bridge books on 2012|pg||
nt|chmitty: ils ne sont pas partis pour en tout cas|pg||
nt|petergill: Japan in 11th, only 6 VP from 8th..... 8 teams qualify after 21 rounds|pg||
nt|blewah: 1nt is forcing so 2@d is 3+|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@c transfer to @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@h ? I don"t know :(|pg||
nt|edou2704:  2h may be transfer, and 3h fit in @s to play by partner ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S instead of DBL??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that clever ruse  let them buy the hand in 3@S|pg||
nt|meargent: EW need to find their @C ruff 2 beat this highly unlikely|pg||
nt|chmitty: elles pardon|pg||
nt|ritong: fine spot|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure what 2N was...|pg||
nt|dburn:  natural and optimistic|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like an obvious pass to me...|pg||
nt|dburn:  but West may have thought it was something else|pg||
nt|dburn:  and this is a so-so game missed - non-vulnerable, one tends not to push so hard|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lechcold: 4@S wygra lekko...chyba ¿e zostanie postraszony przebitk¹ karow¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: i zagra piki z góry|pg||
nt|brolucius: The same auction as on the other table, as you can see by moving your cursor over the Open Room result (top left).|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: board 29 +1 will correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Deas-Palmer play  "mini-multi"  aka Wagner   i wonder if either of them would have found the 3@H bid|pg||
nt|petergill: BB: Favoured teams from Poland and Bulgaria in 14th and 15th have very little hops of qualifying|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib points out 5@D also a make|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: but it's a double-edged sword for sure...|pg||
nt|antoniz: po karowym te¿ nie idzie|pg||
nt|lokaty: nie idze, ale na drugim stole dali karowy i odeszli w atu. Ju¿ sz³o, ale Jessi wzi¹³ asem i zagra³ asa trefl:(*|pg||
nt|meargent: good agressive biddings by NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west should have been worried about this happening|pg||
nt|granguru:  and in the newspapers tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i think they say 1d with 4-4? so that bid showed 5H|pg||
nt|ritong: jill levin aime son jeu|pg||
nt|chmitty: humm|pg||
nt|chmitty: ça doit pas être ça|pg||
nt|ritong: pour ma part je ne raffolle pas des as secs, mais bon|pg||
nt|ritong: ton?|pg||
nt|chmitty: sur la suivante, il y a aussi un chelem à 50% qui gagne ... demandé par les françaises|pg||
nt|ritong: ton please|pg||
nt|wstuart: This is gonna be hard to make!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he fancies NT rather than 4H - 2nt is too high|pg||
nt|panosk: dont know what 1@S is in open room from N but it sure isnt spades :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|grebrof: I mainly lead offensively and I cant say that I have lost on it - I think its the same with these players: its better to lead something you have than lead something you dont want ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: your P to lead back - it is also easier for your P when it comes to defending if your leads are offensive|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: ns was making 2s..|pg||
nt|pawel90: bêdzie bura w domu |pg||
nt|ritong: we are nervous:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: excuse moi|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|viren169: the dble of 3@C was a bit too early...|pg||
nt|dburn:  but Brock's @dQJ turned out to be useful cards, a fact she could not really appreciate|pg||
nt|timb: I hate opening 1NT on the East cards; but nothing else is better|pg||
nt|april7: E has no other choice than to bid 4@H!! and it works!!|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pawel90: albo go na ³awê posadzimy w najblizszym meczu w nogê|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: po co bura - do k¹ta na groch:)|pg||
nt|starkist: time for the queen to play her queen of @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did she have a non-forcing way to show @D? |pg||
nt|meargent: @D lead gives EW a chance|pg||
nt|blewah: should be made, i think. even with that bad break of trumps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: i don't see anything in CC to explain non-use of negative dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: maybe they play DBL denies 4@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the other room, I foolishly suggested that there was no scope for a disaster on one of the boards we have still to see. Of course, I was proved wrong. Learning nothing from my ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: mistakes, I will make the same prediction here.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: n will surely bid 2@s|pg||
nt|ritong: it seems so, yes  dummy is high, except trumps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kiwibridge: well cashed for an imp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  but since CC says neg => 4@S  i would expect entry to show it does not apply here|pg||
nt|ritong: phew|pg||
nt|chmitty: @h switch and one or two off|pg||
nt|eamongall: I guess Sweden don;t open 14-16 1Nt with any 5 major .. |pg||
nt|ritong: also, you know that it will be duplicated other room|pg||
nt|ritong: very likely|pg||
nt|timb: true|pg||
nt|april7: @H @D @H @H @D and finish111|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: privet vlad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H did go down    making Sweden on wrong side of FOUR slam swings this match|pg||
nt|mamos: and the defence should prevail|pg||
nt|wstuart: but it is possible|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think west will exiat a @C now|pg||
nt|petergill: Mike Ware follows the approved Mike Ware plays of "when in doubt, put the opponents on lead"  and "put them on lead so they can make the mistakes"|pg||
nt|chmitty: but still few Imp's to the French|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|xenya: bounjour Henri|pg||
nt|mamos: loads of tricks now|pg||
nt|drorp: weird choice to play 2nd @d, with clearly no entry to hand anymore, switching to heart would save a trick, 11 tricks will be made now|pg||
nt|starkist: oh the opportunities|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphznz: helpful lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Dk and switch showsed singleton - thank you Michael Rosenberg|pg||
nt|ritong: le mort est parfait pour jill|pg||
nt|copeyj: Notice Smith keeping the @H2 in her hand - not because she thinks she needs it but because it is good technique to keep it - you never know when you might need a low one :)|pg||
nt|april7: small @D first and then 10|pg||
nt|april7: does E have other ideas because it takes so long??|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lechcold: vugraf z PO co mówi³, ¿e chyba nie nad¹¿y³ za gr¹... mog³o wiêc nie byæ tak jak to wygl¹da w movie|pg||
nt|kareno: I see your point, Tony :(|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Baxter playing 3@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the defence not too difficult but only 50 but a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|viren169: this should go minus with a few more imps to England|pg||
nt|ritong: so, even if it hurts your feelinds, you more or less have to do it|pg||
nt|panosk: been told It's like Take out double and they play transfers and i think so too|pg||
nt|panosk: transfers very popular lately|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: should be OK if she gets diamonds right|pg||
nt|joanem: small to 9 u mean |pg||
nt|ritong: le contrat de chelem est au mieux sur l impasse @h, sans accident annexe|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yuval10: looks natural to play @s now|pg||
nt|ritong: pard asked for that, in a way|pg||
nt|ritong: finito|pg||
nt|timb: The equal best player I have ever seen, Tim Seres, would often open 1NT if the diamonds and hearts were swapped|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joanem: or 7 or 6 lol|pg||
nt|kareno: It always comes down to the mathematical chances on the last match, doesn't it?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: 2 to go|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so now Sweden on wrong side of 50% game|pg||
nt|granguru:  excellent play |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|joanem: or 6 |pg||
nt|meargent: BRAVO|pg||
nt|starkist: boyahkasha|pg||
nt|ritong: donc, plutôt bien jugé|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: zack is trying to reconstitute the hidden hands  he has no chance to get that right imo|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer is supposed to hold 7 @hs, for starters|pg||
nt|xenya: settling for 2 off is not a problem here -- just ruff a club, losing a club and a trump -- but if he tries for something better he mat regret it|pg||
nt|ritong: his pard contributed @h Q on the lead, so no trump trick for his side|pg||
nt|yuval10: he thinks what's the likelyhood that his partner has a singel @d and that the K@d in his hand will vanish if he doesn't cash it|pg||
nt|blewah: wow. notice the smooth 2x duck by W|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lokaty: bura jest zawsze zarezerwowana dla Buraka:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  take notice of the @D8 play|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: sometimes it's just not your day|pg||
nt|wstuart: Now Lew knows the hand.|pg||

pc|c4|nt|granguru:  how many of us would have just played @DA?|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: England is running out of time i think|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so i take back everything|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: they are speeding up a bit|pg||

nt|edou2704:  1NT or 1@c ?|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if NS ever open 1N with 5-card major|pg||

nt|meargent: in OR canada cleverly found out they were short 2 aces and stopped at 5 level|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie bêdziemy siê k³ociæ:) tak by by³o|pg||
nt|granguru:  @D8 asked for a @H return, as there was a great danger of losing that trick in the @C suit length|pg||

nt|wstuart: '|pg||
nt|wstuart: lol|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: players scored 110 when South claimed but i think it will be 90...|pg||
nt|ritong: obvious raise to 2@s, imo|pg||
mb|d|nt|drorp: some lazyness from Gino there, it's not like they're 20 mins late...|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess a fit jump to 4@h was unavailable...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: forcing or semi-forcing|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: 6 minutes playing time left|pg||
nt|meargent: in this room NS might even be more clever and stop in 4@Hs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: weak Nt getting extensive run|pg||
nt|april7: now a slam try is possible and if bid good guesses are very necessary|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D some sort of heart support |pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: that was a nice pass by N, if he X then his side might've run into some big troubles|pg||
nt|ritong: fine move by north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this mechanism means they'll have lots of room below game to learn no slam|pg||
nt|starkist: other room south must have got bergens mixed up to go slamming|pg||
nt|petergill: Lead now 36 imps after Newell and Reid beat the 4@S then bid the grand slam|pg||
nt|wstuart: The lead was from teh other side on 4@S - the @HA was lead and there was no inference to be drawn as to the location of the @SQ|pg||
nt|edou2704:  tea time already ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: needs guts to do that|pg||
nt|xenya: good decision by N not to compete further|pg||
nt|jbgood: GeO was not as tempted as Lall at the other table - and passed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a useful 8 to the Kiwi with 1 to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has 4 tricks in the side suits and needs to add six trump tricks.|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@d 4SA|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@d shows @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: interesting choice by Gino here, deciding to go slow so he can represent his shape, rather than making a wild preempt at a big level (like 5@D :))|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek's PASS looks much better to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs is known for his agressive bidding in competition, doesn't let the opps play at low level|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably forcing|pg||
nt|joanem: 4s is aggressive thought she woudl bid 3s after 1n|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no bad breaks so no problems|pg||
nt|starkist: splinter|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure about this|pg||
nt|ritong: rather a cue with @s fit|pg||
nt|copeyj: Sweden bid 6@H on 29 next door too - well done to (presumably) flatten the board|pg||
nt|copeyj: aggressive opening, but don't forget N/S play precision so openings limited|pg||
nt|ritong: simons applies " no way they play raised 2M quietly"|pg||
nt|panosk: that the reason why as i was told, they play 2@h = transfer for @s|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@d simple fit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: south must feel he hasn't shown his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: by at least a king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  1N-3N   makes more sense to me|pg||
nt|granguru:  and even if it werent so, it shows a great defensive hability by the E player|pg||
nt|ritong: ou 2SA mini maxi|pg||
nt|blewah: or @s raise, Henri?|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - S kept it open and launched EW into 4@H...|pg||
nt|panosk: in hearts|pg||
pc|h7|nt|starkist: sharyn and dianna were 4th in the butlers, some consolation, good try|pg||
nt|viren169: another flat bd... |pg||
nt|dburn:  maybe - a heart lead might have left declarer guessing a bit|pg||
nt|viren169: the trump lead wont do any harm to declarer|pg||
nt|viren169: Decarer will set up the diamonds for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|timb: I'd need to be on some severly mind altering drugs to double 2@s for takeout on the West cards|pg||
nt|timb: This is down two|pg||
nt|ritong: i m not scandalized|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: 2@C was forcing to game, so East could bid 3@H on the next round.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|drorp: Gino and Ronpa are both in early 30s, Gino ex junior for many years, i used to practice with him alot back in his junior days|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: what a lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: surprize lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H was 1 down but 130 better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice confident stop|pg||
nt|ritong: indonesia in the right contract again|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@S by Sjoberg a good bid - Rimstedt should bid 3N now I should think|pg||
nt|copeyj: and they have protected the @D tenace|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: needs to lead a trump to beat this, i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since the auction is forced to game, it can be difficult for the players to know if partner has extra values. 3NT is an important bid on the way to a major-suit game. The Serious ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT shows extra values during cue-bidding, the non-serious 3NT denies them. You can play it either way. |pg||
nt|starkist: not the dream dummy|pg||

nt|ritong: as a document|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yuval10: with what looks like a good result for Israel, when 4@h is cold|pg||
nt|ritong: that would tie the match  not sure 2 imps is worth 1 VP|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder how 4@H went down in the OR|pg||
nt|ritong: relatively naturally|pg||
nt|ritong: north led a @c, ducked|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i see|pg||
nt|yuval10: he didn't have an indication from the bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: then grue draw @h A in order to avoid a possible guess later|pg||
nt|ritong: then the roof fell on him|pg||
nt|yuval10: here it looks like South would bid|pg||

nt|ritong: 10|pg||
nt|sharkey: Janice upgraded her hand to 15-17|pg||
nt|timb: The "Law" is statistically rubbish. It is not supported by the data. It's benefit is only that you have a consistent basis for taking (wrong) decisions|pg||

nt|drorp: Gino's tactic didn't work out, personally i would just blast a big diamond bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: muller not opening strong club here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H actually could be 5@H 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: with 5-5 they rather open the Major first, before they are being preempted to 4@s|pg||
nt|pawel90: szlemik nie jest ³atwy|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziêki:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when they said  you can't preempt with 4 of other major or a void  they forgot to say it was no-no with BOTH|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: opposite passed hand   better to show suits|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this is the last board of the set.. |pg||
nt|josj: they will have two, I assume :)|pg||
nt|edou2704:  X from north now?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: so you have to mix the beer with coke?|pg||
nt|meargent: unless the rules are changed|pg||
nt|viren169: obvious re-opener?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|drorp: chagas may have found the bid that will get them to slam|pg||
nt|drorp: needs to find another bid now|pg||
nt|drorp: very tough slam to bid, based on the 10 card diamond fit|pg||
nt|grebrof: hardly Chagas "duty" to bid slam, but I guess S has one more bid if Chagas can dig up some @d-support|pg||
nt|mamos: Will EW pass if he bids 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: woow..the french team are looking for english blood at the 1 level|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: the next session will begin at 13.45CET (in about 1 hour)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Kevin was our great operator, apologies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  1@H with 5@S may just apply to 1st/2nd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs passing, probably expecting 2@s with Muller, since the opps didn't overcall 2@s or raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: that 5@C overcall is somewhat -- er -- exotic... |pg||
nt|drorp: great stuff from Chagas|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll never know|pg||
nt|drorp: passing the 4 level, impressive|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree - very good bid|pg||

nt|ritong: c est la vie|pg||

nt|edou2704:  cronier bid 3@s due to the double fit |pg||
nt|copeyj: but 4@S will not find a way home I don't think - at least down 2 on this lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: dziwny rebid Yokoi (2@S zamiast 1BA)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D forcing checkback|pg||
