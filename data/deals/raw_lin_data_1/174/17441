nt|Walddk2: Jo, de kan cykle hjem|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ligesom du gjorde i morges|pg||
nt|roswolf: we are off again|pg||
nt|sheila a: Hallo Beryl|pg||
nt|lark20: Sorry McGowan and Punch are playing weak no trump, 4 card majors and weak twos in 3 suits|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Welcome all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|galadriel: Afternoon all and welcome back to the second half of this match between Scotland and Northern Ireland|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good evening everyone!|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 4s look likely here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  hopefully we will get South's name corrected shortly|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy n/s to play in @S at some level|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: NS play weak notrump but north must have decided that is too good, with 14 and 5 good diamonds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: these good 14 counts are always difficult, do you upgrade to 15?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hej Chick!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  with bare spade honours and no tens?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Good morning.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Good Morning and welcome to the Lady Milne from Belfast|pg||
nt|sheila a: We seem to be summarising the auction|pg||
nt|galadriel: Match 2 - Scotland v Northern ireland|pg||
nt|sheila a: If Ns are playing weak NT it might have gone 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good 4@S for EW subject to @H play.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Scotland are EW but we don't have names yet|pg||
nt|sheila a: It's not always straightforward to cash all your @s in this situation|pg||
nt|galadriel: The event is taking place in Belfast|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as west|pg||
nt|chick: Hejjjj Ralf, Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Good morning all|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: The Law - 4@S |pg||
nt|jbgood: Roland vil gjerne (be)vise at også dansker har humoristisk sans - well done R:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes that's a good point|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kemperg: morning Michael|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Germ|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  those trump intermeiates are useful|pg||
nt|roswolf: south bid 4@S I suspect|pg||
nt|galadriel: This will be a few down|pg||
nt|roswolf: if real|pg||
nt|galadriel: By North, obviously|pg||
nt|sheila a: Was 4@h the opening bid or just the final contract?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3@D from North might have shut East out|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Should get there with west taking the bull by the horns|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to stay out of game anyway|pg||
nt|simonr: Fourth suit forcing to set up the force|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is never stopping in a partscore once East opens, misfit in @d or not|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT is also making|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wondering now whether to bid 3@S or 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt south is wondering what to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Må være skuffende for Vest ikke at kunne bete 4@S, og da har makker endda et trumfstik!|pg||
nt|sharkey: På en god dag slem ØV|pg||
nt|athene: well they opened 1nt in the other room - maybe that was 14-16|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S has some good fortune  J10@S doubleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I understand the vugraph operator often waits until the tray moves across|pg||
nt|simonr: 3@s would be forcing and East might have Q@s and some goodies for slam - but unlikely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy start with 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yorkbeach:  card says 2hx shows 6@h and 5-9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not wise to give them a push here mrs caplan|pg||
nt|athene: if west bids 3@S now and then 4@S later that definitely sounds like more hand than she has|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @sQ and singleton @h would ideal|pg||
nt|roswolf: operator are you sure east is playing it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Final contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: so if she wants to commit to spades she had better bid four right away|pg||
nt|sheila a: Nash-Connelly play strong NT, 5 card majors and 3 weak 2s|pg||
nt|kemperg: can make |pg||
nt|mikeirl: unusual not to dbl with N hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: Jeg syns S skal melde 4@S første gang|pg||
nt|baardolav: Dårlig bruk av svak løft|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S er helt ude i hampen. Hvad hedder det på norsk?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@s er ok... svak løft gjør du på 3kortstøtte|pg||
nt|jbgood: kan si det, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: helt på vidda   hører jeg|pg||
nt|sharkey: Om S har noen quacks i tillegge betyr omtrent ingen ting - styrken hans er i trumfen - svakhet ingen motspillstikk|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  surprised South bid not bid 3@h given her extra heart|pg||
nt|roswolf: what west played small !? - sacre bleu|pg||
nt|galadriel: Did West really duck?|pg||
nt|chick: NS are playing a 4 card major weak NT ACOL system|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: ignoring that seventh heart not a good idea|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's the strongest weak jump shift i have ever seen|pg||
nt|simonr: East is hating it!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with no @h stopper East was reluctant to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|galadriel: J from Jx would be a very unusual lead|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah, no|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: She didn't :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: but if north had bid a gentle 3@H right away over 2@H, even if that was not theoretically constructive, south might have given it a fourth|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  need @s guess to make 4@h|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  convention card for EW http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/kaye-youngs.pdf|pg||
nt|athene: of course a lot depends on what 1@D - 2@S would mean|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: !J is the entry|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: N tror S had 3@S også...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no guess now|pg||
nt|simonr: They play weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|kemperg: @HJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yorkbeach:  I was expecting South to high-low in trumps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: For resten, da skal man ikke grine af mig, når jeg foreslår, at bergenserne skal cykle hjem. et er vel en dejlig tur op ad kysten, ikke sandt?|pg||
nt|baardolav: Burde være greitt å ta en lav finesse i hjerter nå|pg||
nt|baardolav: Å sikre 4 hjerterstikk|pg||
nt|sharkey: blir litt vått etter hvert ellen laaaang omvei|pg||
nt|sheila a: a @c to the Q should bring this home|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: yes|pg||

nt|mikeirl: Hi Mike|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: a trump peter usually shows three trumps and a desire to ruff something|pg||
nt|chick: EW playing 5 card majors strong NT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|jbgood: jo da - litt under vann også hvis de skal sykle hele tiden - men det får ferjer|pg||
nt|jbgood: går|pg||
pc|s9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps i should say the ability to ruff something - defenders ALWAYS have the desire to ruff things|pg||

nt|athene: a very good hand for a 3@S opener, but maybe 2nd seat at adverse it's ok|pg||
nt|athene: usually with a sound 7-4 you open 4|pg||
nt|simonr: Depends on how weak they are!|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's sensible yes 1@D 1@S 2@C 3@S should be forcing if playing WJS but it's not standard for sure|pg||
nt|sheila a: I will flick back and forward and see what I can find out re scores in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: Results and other good info here:  http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|yorkbeach:  Kennewell would open 4@s |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@d-2@s = weak, 1@d-1@s-2someting-2@s = invitational?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West's name is spelt  Connolly, operator, and East has an Iceland flag|pg||
mb|3H|nt|baardolav: Skulle være mulig å unngå utgang på disse kortene?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: ja|pg||
nt|simonr: 15-17 NT here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well game is easy to bid for e/w|pg||
nt|sheila a: slam in @d possible for NS|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3c both minors|pg||
mb|4H|nt|baardolav: spesielt etter 1nt åpning|pg||
nt|jbgood: litt oppvurdering fra begge sider i lukket rom|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S should be good at adverse vulnerability|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is assuming that her partner has what she would have :(|pg||
nt|sheila a: We seem to have had some difficulties with the first board - hope to find out what happened later|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes i think most are raising 3@S there with three quick tricks and two trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks cold to us but the English south went 2 down |pg||
nt|athene: looks as though you should lose just the two trumps and @CQ, doesn't it|pg||
nt|sheila a: The rooms seem to be linked now - got an imp showing|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3nt good here ns|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@D is poss.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Mest af Øst|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes @h goes on the @dA|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H makable     but not guaranteed|pg||
nt|athene: i would expect just 4@D from west over a strong notrump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h suit combo to make 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H will come down to how you play the trumps - double finesse is normal isn't it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: This isn't the boards they are playing...|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: result to follow shortly :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: Interestingly, it seems 3NT made in both rooms on board 1?|pg||
nt|sheila a: The defence had 5 @s to cash if they did the right things|pg||
nt|galadriel: There seems to be some debate about whether the scores are accurate|pg||
nt|sheila a: Is it just this board (2) that's come out wrong?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: N hadde meldt @H forrige spill som kibs sier så 3 NT hadde gått hjem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does the encyclopedia say?|pg||
nt|lark20: That should encourage McGowan|pg||
nt|mikeirl: or d pre empt|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: Hi all ungagged now|pg||
nt|sheila a: N has some useful cards |pg||
nt|kemperg: no courage by S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: no no|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|sheila a: This isn't right - wrong board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: seems some boards are wrong...back with u shortly we hope :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Putting us to test:)|pg||
nt|galadriel: Thanks June - do we have names?|pg||
nt|sheila a: I have done the vugraph operation and it can be a nightmare if the set up isn't right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Agree, tricky assignment.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: Det er vel meget rimeligt at opvurdere Vests hånd til 18-19|pg||
nt|simonr: They play Texas transfers so this should show mild slam interest. Should have just bid 4@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not according to suitplay|pg||
nt|athene: especially since there might be issues of trying to lose a trick to north rather than south, to protect the @SK (you might set up clubs for a spade pitch)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suitplay says to lead the 10|pg||
nt|kemperg: but even on 3@D N had the problem|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: ofte greit med EN hardmelder i et par - med begge kan det gå litt for fort i svingene|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi germ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kemperg: Hi Geoffry|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoops|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: i looked at the play record and it seems declarer did all sensible things and then claimed|pg||
nt|athene: well leading the ten works ok if you guarantee to pick the position later, but double finesse makes your life easier? nothing to think about :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it surprises me too - but never known suitplay to be wrong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  running the 10 gains if North has 4@h|pg||
nt|simonr: Suitplay is a useful freeware program - http://home.planet.nl/ narcis45/SuitPlay/|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 404  play the ace  and lead small to Q  = 78%|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the fact that it is more convenient to start @h from East may tip the odds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, not so many entries to dummy, so i don't think running the ten is really an option here|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sheila a: I'm not sure whether 4@d was keycard|pg||
nt|chick: South might regret calling Jxxx a stopper|pg||
pc|d2|mc|10|nt|athene: maybe it was just some error in recording - she surely claimed 10, not 8|pg||

nt|yo_yo: what are they?   most players like screens|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe but they do not use them very often|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  for some it is twice a year, once in trials, once in event|pg||
nt|sheila a: Ah - this is the hand that goes with the previous auction|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S bid 2nt and has shown @sAK and @hK. If also @cA - not 2nt....|pg||
nt|chick: according to their CC, it should have been a count signal|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  the encylopedia does not have the 8, which perhaps tips the odds|pg||
nt|simonr: The weak NT (12-14) but they will open most 11 counts NV|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: har du ekskludert søta bror, Roland?|pg||
nt|athene: the english NPC should have laid down ground rules at the start:- revokes are ok, but keep them for the partscores :)|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20    but n/s have 4@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  especailly with three 10s|pg||
nt|roswolf: will n/s attempt game here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Han er i lukket rom|pg||
nt|sheila a: The natural weak 2 in @d has its uses but it won't put Nash off bidding here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: hehe|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: another good 14 gets upgraded|pg||
nt|athene: this one is better than the earlier hand, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the 5-card suit is way better and no ugly KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agree with the upgrade this time - decent intermediates as well as 14 HCp + 5 card suit |pg||
nt|yo_yo: revokes are common,  i  unfortunately do them quite often :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yo_yo: yes  agree with the upgrade this time|pg||
nt|athene: if north tries 3@S then south should go to game even with the 12 count i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: will n/s get into the bidding even:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Jeg er faktisk den søteste af dem alle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: nr. 7|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hva er det som forgår her... Skal du si 1nt på 16 hp i andre melderunde... så får du heller åpne 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: with AAK and a spade fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  very favourable lie of the cards for NS|pg||
nt|ady: north declined to go further  with good shape     maybe decided would need a transfer brake to consider game|pg||
nt|athene: north would have bid game after a super-accept but otherwise stop in 2; that is reasonable, so you play 2 or 4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no one has bid so the @S are likely to split|pg||
nt|simonr: Should be a routine 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dK lead expected|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is W asking questions?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: i would certainly open the south hand a 15-17 notrump|pg||
nt|simonr: Right suit - wrong card. Soft Q to ask for attitude?|pg||
nt|sheila a: 4@s has problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if West leads a @h, declarer wil be doing well to make this|pg||
nt|athene: she has to duck a heart lead in both hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Poor Lane is getting all the decisions so far|pg||
nt|athene: and play east for the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: or alternatively take the double spade finesse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in view of the bidding, West is probably favourite to hold the @dA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it her first appearance, i wonder?  If so, she will be nervous|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no played last year|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Lead out of turn TD called|pg||
nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|athene: if east was east leading a heart, declarer is just going to bar a heart lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's great,  she can forbid H lead :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what did the NPC say about leads out of turn? :)|pg||
nt|athene: he said, only against NV games, so this is fine|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now that I dont do , always face down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @d to Q and @h switch and similar position|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: card face up|pg||
nt|yo_yo: west on lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  of course|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @S lead probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: discussion about who opened screen|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could still go down even with @s lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  @D view |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but probably should take two @s finesses|pg||
nt|athene: there are ways it may still go down - if south plays it and forbids a heart lead, and rises ace on a spade lead and later misguesses diamonds...|pg||
nt|athene: but i think it is more likely to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Kennewell is now declarer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that mean they can lead @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: I will just have to give result|pg||
nt|athene: isn't there a theory that says you should always accept leads-out-of-turn, because a player who doesn't know whose lead it is is not likely to know what suit to lead? :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if so that's a bad decision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how does BBO cope with dummy being declarer?|pg||
nt|athene: it says "this would never happen if they were playing online!" and sulks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we might crash :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I have always assumed that revokes and leads out of turn are impossible in an online game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe I should try it sometime :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: They did:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: tricky for south now|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: as i understand the revoke rule, it's Lane's decision as to who is declare and the lead|pg||
nt|mikeirl: np here, 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: what would 2nt have been -lebensohl-ish?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Lead out of turn|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: the normal play in the club suit is to take a double finesse against the QJ, rather than just lead to the king, entries and control permitting|pg||
nt|sheila a: I'm not sure what an immediate 3@s from E would have shown|pg||
nt|sheila a: That would have been my choice|pg||
nt|lark20: It may have shown a weaker hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello all|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|yorkbeach:  do we think she asked for a @h lead?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sheila a: The hand isn't that good if you assume the values are sitting over you|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|yorkbeach:  EW card says the queen shows a queen high suit|pg||
nt|sheila a: hallo Henry|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|baardolav: Regner med ns spiller 15-17 nt som nesten alle i norge|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: 1NT-åpinng er 15-17, ja|pg||
nt|sheila a: now best to exit safely with a trump|pg||
nt|henryb:  In order to make 4@s declarer has to reject the @h finesse and play @hA, Q, later ruffing the hearts good|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|baardolav: 1nt gjenmelding? 12-17?|pg||
nt|athene: you have to lose two clubs even with the ace onside so no point leading to the king first off and losing three tricks to AHx with west|pg||
nt|sheila a: People who pre-empt in 3rd often have quite decent hands|pg||
nt|sheila a: so can't guarantee that @h K is wrong|pg||
pc|h6|nt|simonr: East is looking at the jack though so should suspect this is from KQx|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: Spørsmålet er hva S skal melde på 1@S - som det gikk nå|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yorkbeach:  on the previous deal that @d7 lead looked like a short suit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: will get son´me troubles here....|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: or Ax, etc|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@d må han melde... som kan inneholde bedre hender enn 11-14|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ja - det blir og 11-17 så ikke lett|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: jeg falt ut her, det blir mange stikk. Begge kasta sparene sine|pg||
nt|baardolav: så løfter nord til 3@d.... og syd avslutter med 3nt|pg||

nt|kemperg: for me Lebish|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  however, the four-twoitous club and heart positions mean that North could have been squeezed if declarer had taken the finesse immediately|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: EW play a 3-way multi|pg||

mb|1D|nt|sharkey: Høyland med en "heavy" 2@S LR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Men V åpnet|pg||
nt|kemperg: possible slam |pg||
mb|2C|nt|yorkbeach:  having the ace in your own suit is  a factor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh i see Pat , what was the lead?|pg||
nt|simonr: East play 2NT as 20-22 but will she upgrade?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  sorry South's name is still incorrect - should be Ingham, not Ingram|pg||
nt|simonr: No|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told that EW play 3@D - 3@H shows a fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with the @C10 she might have|pg||
nt|sheila a: Both pairs here are highly experienced|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks a simple 4@H but is it to bid!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS have had three hands so far where they could open 1nt playing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the weak notrump was suppose to come up lots, or something|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common these days to give up on stopping in 3major facing a 2nt opener to clarify the degree of fit right away|pg||
nt|sheila a: Grant-Macdonald play Weak NT, Multi-Lucas|pg||
nt|ralfwil: depending on what kind of multi - pass is an alternative|pg||
nt|mikeirl: no - at this stage ew are in 5@CX which is the normal save|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  normally it does|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  England South on board 3 opened 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult bid for North|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@C is a bit of an underbid|pg||
nt|sheila a: NIBU go into the lead |pg||
nt|sheila a: Yvonne Wiseman took an inferior line in 3NT on board 1, it seems|pg||
nt|sheila a: not sure why W didn't open 1NT on this|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure Millership isn't happy with herself|pg||
mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  3@d stopper ask?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  some pairs play that 2NT-3@d-3@h promises 3 @h|pg||
nt|simonr: Completing the transfer with 3 cards is becoming popular|pg||
nt|athene: i think it makes more sense to play that 3@H actually denies a fit though? then you only force to game with at least a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like they are doing that|pg||
nt|mikeirl: bid by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Burns and Greenwood play strong NT, 5card majors and Multi-Lucas|pg||
nt|galadriel: I'm sure Greenwood would have preferred to defend with that nice @D suit|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: or is it a @C raise?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a bit difficult here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  from South over 3@c|pg||
nt|athene: north would like to cue the diamonds to show a good raise in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but 3@D cue takes her past the level of 3@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North could bid 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt would get the job done|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@d stopper would be enough as the cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: you can use 2nt as a good raise also when the cue is too expensive just in general|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting idea|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT should be 1 down|pg||
nt|simonr: Once you have established a fit it avoids the two way new suit bid - is it a new suit or a cue problem?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@c + 2@s + 2@d = 8|pg||
nt|kemperg: they play 4crd major?|pg||
nt|roswolf: over a simple preference will east bid on|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes germ|pg||
nt|sheila a: wow|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharkey: Sjanse her for Kristiansand|pg||
nt|sheila a: 2@s from Burns is @s and a minor|pg||
nt|galadriel: But nowadays, everyone likes to compete over the opps 1NT|pg||
nt|galadriel: even a strong one|pg||
nt|sheila a: Nash obviously expecting more from the W hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry 5@C on board 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: ikke det...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Veldig hardt å komme i 4@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: Enig|pg||
nt|baardolav: Du har ikke anledning til å finne at 4@s er spillbart på så dårlig tilpasning som her|pg||
nt|sheila a: Greenwood can guess which minor :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes she will:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Ok otherwise 2@H was the proper bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Connolly added a point for good play, and Nash added three more|pg||
nt|henryb:  :)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes 10 tricks no game on|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sheila a: This may go 2 off|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah west not in the mood - may cost her side a bushel of imps|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sheila a: Can get the majors going but still a trick short?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: e.g. (1@S) 2@H (2@S) 2NT is a good raise to 3@H|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer's best hope i that whoever has 3@d throws one on the @c|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: south just has to hang on to her @DQxx when declarer runs the clubs|pg||
nt|sheila a: When it goes 1NT P P you know you have roughly half the points at least|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for results and standings after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|mikeirl: cards lie very favourably for N/S|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am sure 2NT would have been natrual for N|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes. she needs two of three finesses (50%) but something more in @s, so a less than even money slam|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kemperg: S has nothing to think about|pg||
nt|mikeirl: poor % slam|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|athene: oh yes|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
mc|10|nt|ady: North can signal a high heart|pg||

nt|vugraphzbj: Spillerne avtaler å ta 10 minutters pause. Det blir feil å vente på spill, fordi da skjønner de om det er et lett eller et vanskelig spill..|pg||
nt|sharkey: God stamp LR - 4@S står|pg||
nt|jbgood: lurer på hvorfor ikke Eide overførte og meldte kløver på det forrige - slem er ikke umulig å nå selv om øst åpner med 1 grand|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 ruter var en god stamp i ugunstig|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: 5 min igjen av pausen|pg||

nt|jbgood: gjør ingen ting Snorre |pg||
nt|baardolav: Par score fra lukket rom på spillet her... |pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: Vi er klare|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dAxx is good if you think partner is short|pg||
nt|athene: the play there was interesting|pg||
nt|simonr: Two flat boards so far - and there were only three in the first 16 boards!|pg||
nt|ady: which heart last hand?    could get blocked|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely no upgrade this time|pg||
nt|athene: objectively declarer should maybe try rising the @CK at trick 1?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  expecting Wales to gain an IMP on 21|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be a big gain for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, sure, there are lots of ways NS can get into 5@S, but at least that makes them work for their 650|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it was S who bid 5@s at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: she can see it's down if she ducks, on best defence|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  a weak 1NT for you :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: finis|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: Routine 3NT here for NS.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yuk i hate 2@D|pg||
nt|sheila a: 109 doubleton of @c is handy for declarer|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass by W correct, he'l get his chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes weak NV|pg||
nt|ady: n/s kept out of their heart fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  chance of getting @s right after East's opening|pg||
nt|athene: pim the jack offside not such good odds as drop the stiff king either side|pg||
nt|simonr: Not sure I like 4@S though especially when they overcall so aggressively|pg||
nt|athene: but the opening big changes things a bit|pg||
nt|athene: opening bid|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club lead  to beat 4@H     south can ruff 3rd round|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dQx @c 4-4 and @sA in front|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Actually, it was North that passed the raise - North opened 1@D and treated her hand as a minimum obviously|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yorkbeach:  how are you playing the @d?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the 9th trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: WHATEVER IT MEANS/SHOWS|pg||
nt|sheila a: and the natural @s lead takes out East's potential entry for @h tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl now|pg||
nt|mikeirl: no pass is missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  I doubt EW would bid 4@h even in an uncontested auction|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: low to J i assume|pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbj: samme som her|pg||
nt|jbgood: legg merke til at begge sydspillerne meldte sparfargen fremfor å doble opplysende |pg||
nt|athene: with this diamond suit you lead small to the jack then back and lead the queen|pg||
nt|thedoc: undo operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont thinkl east bid 2@s here|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kemperg: she, sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you lead the Q first time you lose to stiff king onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: East has a weak NT so will not get too excited|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard not to give  atrick on the lead here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|baardolav: Endel spiller ut konge for å få fordelingskast på 4trinnet og over, tieren viser bare flere enn to|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  that is what I thought|pg||
nt|henryb:  but even without the club position, declarer could win the heart, play a @c and take a @d finesse|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: if you lead to the jack then to the ten you lose to K9xx onside|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ady: low spade is best    could be sing king in either hand   where as playing the Queen  gains on against stiff jack with west|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even if declarer picked the trumps, it is hard to avoid 2@d losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: with the @cx providing 3 tricks this should not prove a difficult contract|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mikeirl: perhaps not easy to bid 5@D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  would give her 3@s, 2@d, 1@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: might get some sort of end play to only lose 1 diamond|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if East had actually opened a weak 1NT, leading the Q would be right|pg||
nt|lestergold: difference in hand evaluation has led to a swing|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|baardolav: Hvis du kan melde 2 ganger på hånden så melder du 1sp, svakere så er det vel mere popå doble|pg||
nt|baardolav: på essutspill|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a strong NT |pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 count with a couple of tens a lor of players would not split hairs and consider that good enuf to raise a strong no trump to game|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|sheila a: overtricks a-plenty|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: duck a heart now and ruff a heart   and should get out for 1 diamond loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: north's ultra conservatism here gaining a swing|pg||
nt|jferg: 2d from opener shows min and no 5 caed major|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: west did better to duck the club but she wasn't beating 3nt whatever she did|pg||

mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: 5/4 in the blacks,  i thought south might open|pg||

mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: support x ?|pg||
nt|athene: yes we are homing in steadily on Par Bridge :)|pg||
nt|ady: decent contract    but should bed down 1|pg||
mb|4D|nt|yorkbeach:  not this South|pg||
nt|sheila a: 4@h is a good spot|pg||
nt|sheila a: Liz will get pretty excited now|pg||
nt|sheila a: But a count of Aces should keep them under control|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  suspect X = strong NT with no @h stopper|pg||
nt|athene: support doubles are not that common in a weak notrump base|pg||
nt|mikeirl: are men more aggressive when a fit is found.........|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Woodruff might have opened the South cards|pg||
nt|simonr: Not playing with this North!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or Shea|pg||
nt|athene: east might just bash 3nt now for want of a better bid|pg||
nt|galadriel: Burns not pre-empting first in hand with a hand playable in a major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @DK is nicely placed.|pg||
nt|sheila a: trumps aren't behaving as well as you'd like|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h a considerably inferior contract to 5@c|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: you need the double to show a strong notrump in a lot of auctions|pg||
nt|ady: ceertain to get to game|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to bid 2@H as that sort of sounds like 5-4 majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: Sparutspill holdt NS nede på 9 stikk i lukket rom. Ellers så blir det 11|pg||
nt|ady: and should be in it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agricultural|pg||
nt|sheila a: issues with getting back to hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  4 top winners for NS barring accidents|pg||
nt|athene: interesting lead problem for south|pg||
nt|simonr: East now needs to invent a forcing bid|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to bid 3@C because that's not the suit she has stopped, apart from anything|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S and a @H only losers.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yorkbeach:  N may need to find a way to signal for @c|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to lead unsupported aces|pg||
nt|simonr: Too late - on the other side of the pond she could have raised to 3D forcing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ! don´t like @s2 fron 8752...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: and of course a singleton trump is a bad lead too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lucky for EW that the @hK is wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: today both make|pg||
pc|d7|nt|baardolav: 2 imp å slåss om|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is it true?|pg||
nt|sheila a: undo - 4@h by E|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: Fila claimer...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 3 aces I would have been doubling 4@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what now ?|pg||
nt|athene: i think passing it was ok|pg||
nt|athene: no-one forced opps to bid game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if @s4 is suit prefernce, is easy|pg||
nt|athene: so if you assume they sort of know what they are doing, making is more likely than -2, surely?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you are probably right|pg||
nt|athene: double might have a big upside if it caused declarer to play you for trump length and go down in a makeable contract i suppose|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  all I need is a singleton in either minor in partner's hand for 2 off|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  may be falt with 5@d - 1 in the other room|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzbj: ikke rart de tar igjen lukket rom|pg||
nt|ady: yes     |pg||
nt|galadriel: 5@C would be a good save - only one down , unless West finds an inspired @D lead|pg||
nt|chick: might tempt W to lead back the @SJ giving another uptrick|pg||
nt|mikeirl: needs to play Hq from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: not difficult|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yorkbeach:  no justice sometimes :(|pg||
pc|sT|nt|henryb:  I seem to remember an old saying "6-5 come alive". Connolly seems to have forgotten it|pg||
nt|mikeirl: they missed the 6@S on Board 4 in Open|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: you could bid 2@H and then if partner raises, you just bid 5@D and put the bidding boxes away to stop her going back to hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldwin this nin dummy and play @h immediately|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|ady: just down 1    so should be a push    unlucky for Wales  if they play in 5@D in OR|pg||
nt|simonr: Playing with screens she can't see that!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont blame her for bashing, why tell opps what to lead?|pg||
nt|chick: safety play in @Ds necessary mostly because declarer can't get to hand enough|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kemperg: @DK 9th trick|pg||
nt|kemperg: I had been in 3, not very good here|pg||
nt|lestergold: for some reason hasn't|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  + @c could yield several tricks without any ruffs|pg||
nt|sheila a: swings and roundabouts of disciplined pre-empting|pg||
nt|sheila a: Once Burns didn't open it was impossible to come back in|pg||
nt|galadriel: I agree with her pass|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: yes true, double could strike oil|pg||
nt|athene: yes 3nt was not a ridiculous bid, for sure|pg||
pc|h7|pc|dT|nt|chick: you were right, Ralf|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

nt|simonr: Sometimes it works and othertimes you are off in 3Nt with 6D! making!|pg||

pc|h9|nt|athene: one slight problem with bashing 3nt on that hand|pg||

nt|athene: i assumed NS bid 4@S over 4@H in the other room but they went there on their own|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@h is an artificial force|pg||
nt|athene: is that west might have four hearts but she will have four clubs less often|pg||
nt|ady: since you know from the bidding the opps have 9+ clubs  that is the likely lead evenif you dont tell them|pg||

nt|athene: one king, no aces|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and also help E with the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  EW are consistent|pg||
nt|galadriel: A coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4NT why the hurry?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3@D seemed automatic from east, followed by 3@H from partner|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
nt|mikeirl: you would like @Hs played to protect @S King, but doesn't actually matter on this layout|pg||
nt|kemperg: now she has no clue with @S Hx|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: It is a style thing - if partner expects you to routinely open bad 11 counts then it is not a problem - but you need to be consistent|pg||
nt|yo_yo: briony youngs hoping they dont win the first 5 @H tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if the @cK is offside, 5@c is not making either|pg||
nt|sheila a: Greenwood reluctant to underlead her K@c into the strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its a great small slam good enuf grand for Roland and the rabbi|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yorkbeach:  AQ109 well worth the upgrade|pg||
nt|mikeirl: lucky here to get plus score|pg||
nt|jferg: and lose 10 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: well playing a cold,grand in a dodgy 3N is not mtoo impressive|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yorkbeach:  laydown without the @d lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on @s finesse now|pg||
nt|ady: this time if 3NT fails   then so foes 5@C|pg||
nt|mikeirl: it'll b a sweat now on the Q@S lead :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  Scotland had a string of above average results in this room|pg||

pc|d9|nt|baardolav: spørs om svindahl legger liten spar når det blir spilt... og det gjorde han...|pg||
nt|athene: yes but 3nt might fail a lot more|pg||

nt|kemperg: well deserved sweat|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yorkbeach:  do not think I would want to play them at rubber bridge :)|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|galadriel: The local website for schedule and results :http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: draw trumps, cash hearts, play two rounds of clubs and hope for a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|athene: if you cashed the @CA early someone might have to get cute and throw their king from Kx|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: well done N/S in both rooms|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||

nt|sheila a: You couldn't totally disagree with someone who upgraded the N hand to a strong NT|pg||

nt|mikeirl: competitive par score @S & @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  discipline from Woodruff|pg||
nt|athene: 5431 usually you try to open at the 1 level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they play Lucas as 5-5|pg||
nt|athene: if it's close|pg||
nt|simonr: hate these South hands - they are what strong club systems were made for!|pg||
nt|athene: because these are complex hands so you need room to investigate|pg||
nt|athene: but if you have to just jump shift of course you might run out of room anyway|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT     no easy ride|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am a fan of 2@c openings|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too|pg||
nt|galadriel: 4@H for NS|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: Slemsonen her...|pg||
nt|athene: also you much prefer to open 1@C on a very strong hand than 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S can get passed out way too easily|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  prefer 1@s to 2NT if they are my only choices|pg||
nt|simonr: That just delays the problem to the rebid|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w hold the power on this hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@C here, but will end with 3NT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes automatic, good save if i down|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|sheila a: 3NT = a balanced raise to game|pg||
nt|galadriel: high card raise in @H|pg||
mb|3D|nt|baardolav: ingen dårlig slem dette her?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Presumably limited|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and then 4@h would be making so on all grounds it was right to bid it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jbgood: 12 sammenligninger gjenstår - og 30 imp skal hentes inn... |pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know, the Lady Milne is an annual competition, all female.|pg||
nt|athene: i would open that 2@C but close|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT rebid?|pg||
nt|lestergold: on thse hnads you bid to the 4 level and let the opps guess about the 5 level|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: not everyone's 1@H overcall at adverse|pg||
nt|athene: it wasn't east's in the other room anyway|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no 2@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  why say the hand is balanced when it is not?|pg||
nt|roswolf: wesy mighr regret opening|pg||
nt|mikeirl: my philosophy 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Play looks straightforward|pg||

mb|p|nt|galadriel: Do I have to get another coffee?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Careful, you'll end up wired|pg||

pc|hA|nt|yorkbeach:  North is going to end up as declarer but unlucky|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they can investigate for a 5 card major|pg||
nt|simonr: Hate showing a game force in spades with such a poor suit. i would show this as balanced and hope to show the 5@S via 5-card stayman|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open 4@s bid poorly judged aceless flat hand|pg||
nt|jferg: lead as expected|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  3@d is pushy, imo. this is either a dead minimum 3@d or a maximum 2@d rebid|pg||
nt|sheila a: Punch encouraged to go on by her Q@d|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: Hvis Sven Olai cuer nå er de i slem|pg||

nt|sheila a: East can easily be kept from enjoying her @h|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might have anyway if North bid 2NT over 2@s|pg||
nt|athene: with a different 5431 i might pretend i was balanced but that one it doesn't look like a necessary distortion|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: I slem er @CK kanskje utspillet?|pg||
nt|sharkey: LR spilt av V...|pg||
nt|jbgood: og de har fått den på rett hånd hvis syd forsøker et kløverutspill|pg||
nt|athene: slightly tricky now on the entries front|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lead resolves the @c suit nicely but declarer still a trick short|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Best for brYony not to cover|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might think the @cK is offside and try a @d to the king|pg||
nt|athene: declarer doesn't know the @CK is right so might not use her dummy entry to repeat the club hook|pg||
nt|athene: yes, there are lots of options, not trivial to play|pg||
pc|h4|nt|baardolav: Men vil vel gå bet... det er ingen vinnende variant enn å spille AK i hj to runder trumf og tre runder ruter, så innspill i kløver|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yorkbeach:  1@h would not have occured to me|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: you need a spade as entry to the diamonds but that means you can't untangle 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s + 2@h + 2@d + 2@c = 9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if E does not cash the @hK, time to set up @d|pg||
nt|athene: spade return now would be my guess|pg||
nt|athene: east has taken long enough now that she obviously hasn't got the @CA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is a first cap for West, Dinah Caplan, a rubber bridge player, i believe|pg||
nt|athene: with the @CA she would have cleared the hearts a long time ago|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  long pause is telling declarer who has the @cA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East would be playing @h if holding a sure entry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ahh  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  entries now to set up a @h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 2@H tricks now|pg||

nt|sheila a: wondering about a @c hook now|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|simonr: Double first and then bid NTs at the lowest level to show this hand|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  not this time|pg||
nt|ady: again 3NT   or 5of a minor|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@d seems obvious|pg||
nt|simonr: South thinking about 1NT or 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: south considering 1nt?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  once you subtract a king, the hand is definietly not worth 3@d|pg||

nt|athene: south decides she can't have that much as she didn't overcall 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: likely to be 3NT|pg||

nt|athene: declarer might put up the @SQ confidently on a small spade lead and lose all faith in human nature :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT might make if declarer picks the clubs, as she might given the opening bid|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ady: spade lead  holds to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here's the 9th trick assuming she ducks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  who is ducking and risking a @s switch?|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might rise ace, scared of a spade shift?|pg||
nt|ady: might go up with ace |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but if West has a @h honour, it will be tough for her to switch|pg||
nt|ady: would worry about a spade switch  beffore clubs are set up|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  remember North has made a TOD|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and E has shown 5+ @h|pg||
nt|athene: interesting though - if you think east would lead a spade from @SKQJ on this bidding, then she pretty much has to have both hearts for the opener|pg||

nt|pfbr: what would q@cs mean?|pg||

nt|sheila a: why the @c pitch?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: now has 9 for sure, and cashing out will pick up the @DQ for 2 more|pg||

mb|3N|nt|athene: can the defence come to a spade ruff to beat 4@H here?|pg||
nt|sheila a: EW will escape to @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H looks obvious for north|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This board suits my system. 2@s forcing with 4+@h support and no @s control, 2nt forcing with @s control|pg||
nt|mikeirl: hard to find @D fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  EW bid 5@d in the other room|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT looks a more likley resting place|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: one of my pet hates, that   - rebidding 1NT with a singleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes but it shwos the values, whereas 2@c does not|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4N quanti, paas?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: NIBI bid more aggressively to 3NT on board 6|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it could be a very awkward slam if the clubs were not dropping|pg||
nt|mikeirl: or D not breaking :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: i assume after 1nt rebid north is bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to beleive North is not bidding 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: that north hand doesn't say "3nt" to me, i must admit|pg||
nt|galadriel: Greenwood has a very minimum X - poor 15 and horrible lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may raise quantitatively|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass|pg||

nt|lark20: In the other room N/S were in 3NT on board 6|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  3NT will not be a success|pg||
nt|simonr: Undo again - 3NT by West!!!!!!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  whichever side plays it :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: this is no picknick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lack of entries to the @h is the main problem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: north must think she has entries|pg||
nt|athene: well this auction does have one advantage which is that west has no idea what to lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could be a big swing on this board|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H looks also to be down 1|pg||
nt|simonr: t dosen't matter though - off on any lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  why is 4@h down one?|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H would make surely played by north|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is 4@H down?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: look at the @S position|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|yorkbeach:  unclear why South played the K when dummy did not cover|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: if played by south then maybe the @SJ lead would give a spade ruff to beat 4@H|pg||

nt|yo_yo: no singleton kings this time|pg||

pc|h8|nt|athene: what?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West must have lost track of the spades|pg||
nt|athene: west decided that the north hand was getting a bit left out of proceedings|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  they cannot have played it - there would have been a long pause|pg||
nt|simonr: Another 11pt opening here?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not for me|pg||
nt|athene: if you open 24|pg||
nt|athene: then you open this one for sure|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Q1098 is worth more than 2 points I imagine|pg||
nt|athene: that west hand way better than board 24|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 24 has more shape|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with @d 2-2, 3NT is looking good|pg||

nt|roswolf: now west has a nice hand but east doesnt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s now on EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: looks like 450 here - is there some reason for avoiding the trump finesse?|pg||
nt|athene: ok i really don't understand that |pg||
nt|mikeirl: good game to have bid;  may be missed in Open|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: best is a diamond part score for e/w   |pg||
nt|simonr: You will quickly find if you have a major fit |pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 1@c = 2+ for EW|pg||
nt|sheila a: It doesn't feel reasonable to have to pass the West hand|pg||
nt|lark20: Will Connolly prefer to "come alive" with her 7/5 shape|pg||
nt|sheila a: As it happens, they have no good fit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  wonder whether EW have any system here|pg||
nt|ady: would not be surprise if the try 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if you cross with a @d and the finesse loses, you may suffer a ruff|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  unlikely to reach game now|pg||

nt|sheila a: no signs of life so far|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: she|pg||

mb|p|nt|mikeirl: now a good chance 4@H will b missed|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@D and then??|pg||
mb|4S|nt|simonr: No opening - not sure this is a consistent approach. QT98 looks more than 2 points|pg||
nt|athene: west can just bid 3nt now to catch up|pg||
nt|sheila a: Macdonald's dredged up 1@s bid has kept Burns out of hte auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if you cross by ruffing a @c, it promotes South's @s9|pg||
nt|sheila a: Playing 5 card majors it's easy to respond 2@h of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  + you cannot pick u the trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: caplan plays rubber bridge,  she wont finesse|pg||
nt|athene: aggressive 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: why open balanced 11 counts, not for me|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS can't really make anything|pg||
nt|chick: one keycard may give E pause|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  make all 13 double dummy unless N leads a @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it would be inconsistent to pass as dealer and then rebid 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: hang partner for a 3rd hand opening|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: do EW play multi?|pg||
nt|athene: i thought three weak-twos|pg||
nt|athene: if east has 2@D opener available then 1@D-2@D should be a hand, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS play a Multi but not EW|pg||
nt|simonr: You need to cut partner some slack if they open in third at this vulnerability - East must be the one to move on|pg||
nt|galadriel: Some Souths might overcall 1NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: Better was 2@H by N|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: this is not trivial|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a heart lead the diamond guess is needed|pg||
nt|kemperg: right|pg||

nt|kemperg: or @DJ:(|pg||

pc|c2|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  you cannot be serious|pg||
nt|ady: still thinks spade pips bad|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  operator, we do not believe North's bidding|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  or rather lack of it|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she has given up dubious competitive actions for Lent|pg||
nt|lark20: 4@H would have been safer|pg||
nt|sheila a: the @c position is a gift for declarer|pg||
nt|sheila a: You never know whether to lead your suit into declarer's known K so that it's set up|pg||
nt|sheila a: or to look for partner's entry|pg||
nt|mikeirl: message from Open that Patsy (South) has left the table feeling unwell|pg||
nt|kemperg: pity|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sheila a: She was maybe a bit too strong in points to open that at the one level|pg||
nt|sheila a: she's done well|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|yorkbeach:  time to switch even if East does not lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have a lot of aces|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what is 2@c?|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2-way checkback, forcing 2@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East does not appear to be worth a game try|pg||
nt|roswolf: no this will fizzle out assuming east leads @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: MIGHT WELL TRY A SPADE|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so they have time to get a third club trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: no this contract is doomed|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C hook is needed, but not normal play|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: and surely must double 2@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: checkback - 7 loser hand  ?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C forces 2@D|pg||
nt|simonr: Checkback? They play two-way checkback|pg||
nt|athene: either to play or to make an invitational bid|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is not optimal when you are a passed hand facing a weak notrump rebid and hence can't really game force|pg||
nt|sheila a: no value in overtaking - need partner to have 2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play @dK and N should follow with @d10|pg||
mb|6S|nt|yorkbeach:  totally out of character for North|pg||

pc|h3|nt|athene: decalrer's only chance is to duck a club and then hope the defence don't work out to cash the @HA after @SA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lizzie might switch now |pg||
nt|athene: then she might make 4 spades, 2 clubs and 3 diamonds|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  England gained 11 on 15 when Godfrey played Lane|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of 4@S you tend to wander into, i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: as expected NS found a 5-4 spade fit in the other room and bid what larry would want them to bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  correction 4 boards|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but still a tall order in 18 minutes|pg||
nt|simonr: Three more - 30 - 32|pg||
nt|ady: rngland now a useful lead  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 29 the England NS competed to 3@s|pg||
nt|galadriel: They did very well to stay so low|pg||
nt|sheila a: partner's @s values were useless without an entry|pg||
nt|kemperg: ???|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@H in OR much better:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: This is surely a hand in which north needs to pklay partner for a major suit trick probably heart 1a and help in @ds|pg||
nt|lestergold: what otyher hope can there be on the auction?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 5-4 spade fit and some hcp|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yorkbeach:  EW bid a very aggressive 4@s at the other table|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  standard law of total tricks stuff |pg||
nt|galadriel: They have scored board 10 as Scotland making 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: conservative pass|pg||
nt|kemperg: from East|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup suprising|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: 140 ser ut som en bra score for Bergen|pg||
nt|athene: they might stop out of it here though if west only makes a try|pg||
nt|ady: mis fit    wuill play 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Kennewell viewed not to open 1NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: It seemed the defence should have been able to defeat that|pg||
nt|sheila a: Punch may have been considering a 1NT opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if it is not making even with the @cKJ onside, it is a poor contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  allowd Brock an easy 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is the only board the other room has not played|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: now she wanders in|pg||
nt|lark20: with 1/4/4/4 hand they like to have 13+ points to open|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: 3NT   a struggle|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think the auction is wrong here, no?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: hmmm, looks like W thinks this is puppet?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not 3nt?|pg||
nt|chick: and their CC says puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: fall of the @C10 is nice|pg||
nt|chick: because if puppet, then 3@D shows a 4 card major and 4@D shows both|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2NT forcing   after 2 level response|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer reads the suit|pg||
nt|simonr: 2/1 FG style so 2NT is forcing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kaye might consider a slam now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there ought to be a law that all English players should play Acol :)|pg||
nt|ady: might get a diamond lead in 3NT     then better|pg||
nt|simonr: ...and still drive in the slow lane!|pg||
nt|simonr: West must be thinking about a slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3@H is a gross overbid by East - X would seem normal|pg||
nt|mikeirl: as partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is an example when p may have a yarboro|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yorkbeach:  I realise I am a bit of hypocrite|pg||
nt|roswolf: going boldly where angels fear to tread is a recipe for disaster|pg||
nt|roswolf: hnmmmm why didnt north double?|pg||
nt|kemperg: lady heard our former comment:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  a difference in system results in a different declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  easy for South to lead the @dQ|pg||
nt|athene: a cautious view from west but of course playing a strong notrump, this sequence typically shows a weak notrump from opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: caramba|pg||
nt|chick: I think they have a misunderstanding going here, where E forgot puppet :(|pg||
nt|mikeirl: lucky not to be doubled|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sheila a: 2@c checkback, so that Greenwood can invite |pg||
nt|sheila a: I'd rather be in @s than NT|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very wise|pg||
nt|simonr: Well judged by Kaye|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I have not played the defence to 1NT that my brother and I invented for a long time|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead  could be best    other  leads clould cost|pg||
nt|sheila a: has effectively shown this as  strong NT|pg||
nt|eamongall: I suspect this is doomed for several 50s |pg||
pc|hA|nt|simonr: You mean Cappaletti!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tough to find the @s lead unless South doubles|pg||
nt|yo_yo: landy?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes he has taken over the name :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 hearts and a spade should be easy enough i think|pg||
nt|chick: E now thinks they are cuebidding, and W thinks they are trying to choose a major :(|pg||
nt|chick: our operator can tell us afterward what happened :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: heart back and then J@S  |pg||
nt|athene: sure, but you just rise ace and play clubs to keep north out|pg||
nt|sheila a: bidding this way guarantees 5@s|pg||
nt|galadriel: North implying a 5th @S by going through checkback|pg||
nt|galadriel: otherwise she could bid a direct 2NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: Greenwood will probably ruff a @d in dummy and consequently get @s wrong.|pg||
nt|galadriel: This should make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: many times it´s better to bid 3nt as well as asking for majors|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: well jim this is bridge but not as we know it!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jbgood: sjelden rett å selge ut til 1 grand hvis du har en unnskyldning for å melde|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: kløver 6 er Lavinthal i avkast.. Jon tegner og forklarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North would probably have led a trump against 4@s too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this was not the moment for a count signal in @c|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sheila a: A@c onside means all well|pg||
nt|galadriel: Or - could make|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|d9|nt|kemperg: last board?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ady: maybe go up with A@S    and play the clubs to keep north off lerad|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|simonr: 18-12 to England in VPs at present|pg||
nt|ady: sorry William   you were first|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the other table has now finished|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: north can see the pitch coming on the long club so gets active|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think this can be made by careful play declarer can afford to lose two trump tricks but jmust arrnage to organise two ruffs somehow|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|thedoc: has this table actually played board 26 yet?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: now decalrer's problem is just keeping an entry to the @HJ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: tegningen er postlagt - forklaringen: Gjør hva du vil makker - jeg har alt du ikke har:)|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have done better to just lead hearts towards dummy for a club pitch|pg||
nt|athene: would make 9 that way|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  thanks everyone - see you a bit later|pg||
nt|athene: just rely on the @CK onside|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: is there another match tonight?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  second half of this match|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 9.55 the next  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is a 32 board match|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: see you then |pg||
nt|athene: "round 1 of 2" was a clue|pg||
nt|ady: yes   |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mikeirl: no 16|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: communications are a greatproblem but delcarer should try the @ds before playing trumps |pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: couldn't the @H109 be with the @CQ here?|pg||
nt|sheila a: seems to have found a way to go off|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|thedoc: what was result?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: was when the diamonds went 5-1 in 3NT    almost went down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes North made 3Nt despite blocking the clubs|pg||
nt|thedoc: ok thanks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: is this safe?|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT was made   not sure   10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok it does appear South bid 2@S|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lark20: should have taken some discards on her spades|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c3|pc|d3|nt|athene: and north could have ducked that trick, killing the entry to the @HJ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  squeeze|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: end play possible|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: simpler would have been to put the @CJ in on the second round of clubs|pg||
nt|ady: not nessaary|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the contract was safe anyway with what had been thrown already|pg||
nt|ady: might have been a squeeze   |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6 minutes for 2 boards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely a claim|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: what happened|pg||
nt|simonr: What happened here?|pg||

nt|athene: acol for NS, 5-card majors strong notrump, short club for EW|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  very mysterious|pg||
nt|athene: i thought declarer might have played that off but only if north ducked the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Misunderstanding in the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  1NT and transfer expected|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: standard leads and signals for both pairs|pg||
nt|sheila a: I see no reason for West not to show a 2-suiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: another way that difference in notrump range produces swings|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|athene: east maybe intending to bid 3@S over 3red|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sheila a: needed to make sure she got 5@h, 3@s and 2@c|pg||
nt|kemperg: for me too strong for 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: but works well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Macdonald seduced by the vulnerability into bidding one more|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  England made 90|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so this baord cannot be flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that typically shows a strong but flexible hand these days rather than just a really big one-suiter|pg||
nt|simonr: Should make 140 if you find the @SJ so a small swing here to Wales|pg||
pc|cK|nt|galadriel: perhaps EW have the agreement that Michaels is weak or strong|pg||
nt|sheila a: Never mind, next door NS have missed game on board 10 and chosen instead to play in a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|sheila a: I like 4@s much better than 3NT|pg||
nt|lark20: infinitely better|pg||
nt|lestergold: the defence will get tyhe first 6 tricks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbgood: vanskelig å vinne imp her og for vertene, er vel bare teori som kan hindre Bergen å reise hjem med seier|pg||
nt|athene: club to ace, trump to king, trump?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might pitch a @s on the @d an avoid the @s guess|pg||
nt|sheila a: It looks as if in the other room McQuaker was trying to re-transfer but Wiseman didn't take the hint|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sheila a: shortage of entries means Grant has to play for trumps behaving |pg||
nt|sheila a: defence can socre a ruff now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: this will be tricky - in big danger of losing three trumps and a heart|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: could lose 3@H, 2@S and 1@C on a bad day|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sheila a: difficult for declarer - if lead was a singleton, need to go up with A|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|simonr: Then where does the @C go?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|galadriel: so with intermediate hands like this one, just have to overcall|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: i think the only winning line was to get some sort of endplay on south in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but that would mean cashing the top diamonds without playing a second round of trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good evening everyone|pg||
nt|athene: and of course you might then run into a ruff just on normal breaks|pg||
nt|sheila a: are you sure?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: so i think no reason to get this one right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from manchester|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: sure, the pre-empt makes bad breaks more likely but you can't play for 4-1 trumps right from the start|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|athene: hi :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yorkbeach:  will need to guess @s for 140|pg||
nt|lestergold: nibu still gains on board|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sheila a: That should perhaps have warned E that partner might have defence?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Easy for us to say|pg||
nt|galadriel: So, a few much needed imps for Ireland|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: ouch|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: back to the endplay working now|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|athene: south had to keep that club as an exit card|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mikeirl: Interesting on last 4@H hand - play @CQ to make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: now diamond, diamond, spade|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: hand 30 a myster    not possible to be down if the play shown is correct|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: and south wishes she had exited with the diamond earlier and kept the club for now|pg||
nt|athene: she will lead to the @SK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|athene: no need to keep THREE hearts, south|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now the coup de grace|pg||
nt|athene: you have three trump tricks so if you ever made a trick with the @HK, that was a positive score|pg||
nt|athene: can't risk leading to the ten as you might then go down |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  mistake was throwing a @c on the @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should have thrown a @s|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: west could win jack and force with diamond and you never make any spade at all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only an overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: are they going back to  26 now?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h4|pc|dK|nt|athene: well done by declarer to recover|pg||

nt|athene: diamond lead through the queen makes life harder in 4@H now|pg||
nt|simonr: Support double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: support double|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they play in 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Shows three 1h|pg||
nt|athene: from east's side of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes scheduled re-start in approx 1hr and 5 mins from now|pg||
nt|chick: This event was brought to us by Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and the NIBU (Robin Burns),  and with the excellent support of Roland Wald, our coordinator :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i dont know how e/w managed to stay out of game on this board altho it doesnt happen to make|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: Takk også til BBO og uoppslitelige Roland Wald (som har holdt på siden 8 i dag tidlig - og som har tatt en pause), og kommentatorer Carl Mathiesen og Baard Olav Aasan!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at the other table North did not lead her partner's suit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i suggest because s bid in the open room|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: 1 off|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: it might be slightly tricky for declarer to reach dummy twice for this spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: assuming we get a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: she might just finesse once then cash the ace|pg||
nt|chick: I don't see any 23 IMP swing here, so Congratulations to Scotland for winning this match.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jbgood: Og takk til tilskuere for interessante innspill - og tålmodighet:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gratulerer til Bergen - og lykke til videre|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't really want to spend half an hour ducking hearts for a heart ruff to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: that might incur diamond ruffs and all sorts|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok|pg||
nt|athene: well that makes life easy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@h is trick on a @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: it does work well to put the overcaller on lead, which is why many pairs play a lot of transfers after overcalls|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. 1@C (1@D) X is hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  correction - South did not overcall at the other table|pg||
nt|sheila a: With a couple of careless efforts there, it's no bad thing that this is the last board of the set|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: well perhaps not the best game but it makes easily enough here|pg||
nt|sheila a: This should take it off|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: right - that's why north didn't lead her suit :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 11 tricks |pg||
nt|roswolf: 10|pg||
nt|chick: Full results can be found at   http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: a reasonable lead, to be fair - on this auction you expect declarer to have three trumps and quite possibly a ruff in hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 10 now|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|simonr: Spade laed here would not be a success. We are all taught to laed partrner's suit!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  poor lead here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: partner why dont you lead my  xxxx suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: east still held 3 buillets opposite an opening bid and made no try|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|athene: because it was an xxxxx suit last time!|pg||
nt|chick: Restart tomorrow at 9:00 GMT, 10:00 BST, 11:00 CET, 7:00 pm Sydney|pg||
nt|chick: Hope to see you all here! :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S will make and 4 IMPs to NIBU. Thanks all and good night from Sweden:)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: disastrous bidding by Irish on Board 10 in Open;  playin in 4@S instead of 4@H|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: yes but this time it's a KJ10xx suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  second chance to lead it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  players getting tired|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sheila a: Yvonne has scooshed home in 3NT on board 13|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: another swing for wales|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure it's wise to finesse again|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is why you should not overcall on xxxxx|pg||
nt|simonr: Got it right this time|pg||
nt|ady: will take the lead on last hand if the scores are correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: seems that south wants to let this thru|pg||
nt|lestergold: if thats at all possible|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|galadriel: On board 13 Scotland made another "unmakable" 3NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very unlike a young player i agree|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thanks Michael, Eamon, Sukalyan, specs and our operator, have to go now|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S looks like strange will have to go check it out |pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: scotland gain another imp|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eamongall: the weak 2@D bid drew out an error |pg||
nt|mikeirl: bye all for now|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jbgood: farvel|pg||
nt|sheila a: She appears to have made a number of 3NTs in this match that would have daunted lesser declarers|pg||
