nt|dburn: but if she had been playing a weak no trump, and opened one, she would probably be plus 600|pg||
nt|athene: well that might depend if east bid stayman allowing south to double|pg||
nt|dburn: one wonders what the Scots at the other table play|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I have to look up that heresy. Is she pretty?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: A double of Stayman after a weak 1NT is usually played as strong (rather than clubs).|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Grant/Macdonald play weak 1NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: then, England have some cause for trepidation|pg||
nt|brolucius: West may think she is worth a slam try below game.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Cue-bidding will show that there is no diamond control.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That will cost 2 IMPs, but ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south has a fair suit so might have considered a 2@D overcall - it also cuts out a lot of space|pg||
nt|athene: but three small in hearts is really bad|pg||
nt|brolucius: A text-book example of the value of cue-bidding, although they were also a bit light on values for a slam.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|paulg:  N/S are still experimenting with their overcalling style ... 2-level overcalls are supposed to be sound|pg||
nt|athene: well, or a text-book example of the cost of cue-bidding :) if west just bid 4@S she would probably make 13 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Sry...lost connection...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: np|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||

nt|roghog: Hi all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my partner bid something similar to the west hand recently |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Morning everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unfortunately they cashed the first 6 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kath, Beryl, Geoffrey and Roger|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West is  S Punch  operator|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has a nice choice dbl is recommended|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i approve|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mikeirl: Welcome all, Hi John|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR result ????|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch and McGowan play a weak no trump, 4 card majors and 3 weak twos|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch is one of Scotland's more aggressive players|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass and then bid 4@S/@H later|pg||
nt|roghog: South is worried partner may expect more, but she can't bid anything here|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but tanking like this is dangerous it may inhibit partner in later rounds of the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may feel her herself ubder ethical pressure|pg||
nt|roswolf: also there is the stamina fator|pg||
nt|roswolf: operator who are screenmatesa?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|eamongall: the old scores seem to be still there ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: McGowan/Youngs|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: the real score is about 78-15 |pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Germ|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Scotland lead overall but Ireland and England close behind 72 70 65|pg||
nt|roswolf: well an easy game for e/w - there shouldnt be any accidents|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: a diamond lead isnt obvious|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: well north has a choice i would bid slam since for me south has shown values|pg||
nt|lark20: exciting auction for the first board|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: lots of tricks on this lead though|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|chick: 4th best spade turns out to be the best lead|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 11 tricks |pg||
nt|capercliff: afternoon folks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: yes and a sound result for n/s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: but into declarer's bid, unlikely :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: anyway.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|paulg:  A more interesting hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Suppose the @C6 is led and as declarer, you suspect that it is a singleton and the defenders can take a ruff. By 'hiding' a lower spot-card, you may persuade your RHO that the lead ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: is from a doubleton.  |pg||
nt|paulg:  difficult for Youngs to get in on a slow auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another text-book hand. The 5-level belongs to the opponents|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How lucky we are we all those example hands|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  A good example too of knowing your opponent's signalling methods, without having to examine their CC|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|paulg:  so that you know how to false card|pg||
nt|paulg:  (or create doubt)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: must be corrected for the score|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be interesting|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: east will bid something|pg||
nt|mamos: even the ruff wont threaten 4@h here|pg||
nt|capercliff: E/W have a profitable 5@d|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chilloncan: when i said "from either side" i didnt mean EW|pg||
nt|roghog: not sure what happened, but it can be made|pg||
nt|lark20: Liz has been opening 1NT with 11 points quite often this weekend|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ralfwil: 6@de on N is a fine contract|pg||
nt|chick: 6@D makes easily|pg||
nt|lark20: But this is made clear on their CC|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now for the magical mystery tour|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S should imply a @D fit|pg||
nt|capercliff: I suspect West will bid 5@d over 4@h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: did declarer really go off on the previous board?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i love that 3@D bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 4h but tight verfy tight|pg||
nt|chilloncan: from either side|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: there we go :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: practical auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should teach her not to!|pg||
nt|mamos: I've heard of 6-4 come alive but East's pre-empt is not exactly textbook|pg||
nt|mamos: 6-5|pg||
nt|roswolf: depends which textbook mike|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|mamos: mis type  (mis-rhyme)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6/5 come alive|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: t/o obviously this second double|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I suppose 4nt was from N|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure this will get fixed quickly|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: lucky to find a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: at these colors south should probably go for the game now that opps have found a fit|pg||
nt|roghog: always lead a trump if this happens, but perhaps not so obvious with a bare K|pg||
nt|roswolf: east may well leave this|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: need to avoid Nt here|pg||
nt|capercliff: very hard decision this|pg||
nt|roswolf: sindeed but the 5 level belongs to the opps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: sally knows her partner has values for her double|pg||
nt|mamos: South probably knows she won't get rich from double   is 5@h worth the risk ?|pg||
nt|capercliff: perhaps a better start for North would have been to bid 4@d on the way|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she can also guess the singleton @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 4@S bid sounds a warning|pg||
mb|5H|nt|yo_yo: yes 4@D from north a good idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: that wont do much for defence|pg||
nt|chick: the Open Room will drop their jaws :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi ralf:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: difficult to lead from North hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: you can smell the ruff surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: unfortunately the ruff kills her|pg||
nt|capercliff: holding a stiff @d you know opponants will sacrifice in 5@d, best to set up the 5-level bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: Scotland put the pressure on here to good effect|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: west has to lead them|pg||
nt|roswolf: and does:(|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: s didn't open, optimistic 3NT by N|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mikeirl: very, passing 1h reasonable?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lark20: N/S do have 3NT on|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes hide that 4 sally|pg||
nt|capercliff: S falscards|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed will west work it out?|pg||
nt|capercliff: and now E can hold the 4@s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what other choice?|pg||
nt|roswolf: club?|pg||
nt|capercliff: holding the A@h she knows the @d trick is going anywhere|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@D yes  |pg||
mc|10|nt|yo_yo: @D|pg||

nt|brolucius: Sally Brock's 5@H might have turned out more luckily. The swing to Scotland was mainly down to the bold 3@D opening bid by East at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Defending 5@D doubled would have lost quite a few IMPs too.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  would have only saved an imp since 5@d only one down|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: you might beat 5@D two on trump leads?|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT often played as a relay for further information on this auction, since South might hold only three-card spade support.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT a relay, asking for strength and number of spades|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: At least invitational|pg||

nt|athene: showing four spades wouldn't guarantee five clubs would it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: i lost connection about 4 times...|pg||
nt|athene: playing a weak notrump though you are going to have some shape|pg||
nt|brolucius: Might be 4-1-4-4, even if they open 1@C when 4-4 in the blacks.|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, unless she is 4441|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know, best is to ask the closed room operator to shut down and reconnect to your room|pg||
nt|paulg:  if she is 4432 then she'd have opened 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That involves manual inputs afterwards|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: sure :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1NT is an alternative on the West cards, since South is likely to hold four hearts.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now South may wish she had overcalled 2@C.|pg||
nt|paulg:  McGowan will not find the @cJ lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: she might, if South doubles|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: but no one knows what that double means|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many claim that it would ask for a spade.|pg||
nt|dburn: and what should partner lead if you don't double?|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: what happens if you do that is south wins the @SK, cashes the clubs then north says "sorry, i forgot about these strong ten lead things"|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Confession is good for the soul.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I must go downstairs and compile a lunch tray. Back in a moment.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: south not willing to risk giving a trick away to get her long suit going immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Rehi...hopefully we'll be connected again soon|pg||
nt|athene: declarer probably will emerge with nine tricks here as north can never get in to lead a diamond through|pg||
nt|athene: on a diamond lead declarer might not want to use the @CA to reach dummy to take the spade finesse|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: because then if the finesse lost, the defenders would have both minor suits to run|pg||

pc|d9|nt|athene: this is definitely one of the worst parts of a weak notrump structure|pg||
nt|athene: opener is stuck with 16 or so - if you go 2nt you might get too high facing 5 or 6|pg||
nt|athene: but if you pass you can miss game|pg||

nt|brolucius: So, England bid and made 3NT on the last board.  |pg||
nt|athene: no other country i can think of has such a marked disparity between the methods commonly played and those played at the top level|pg||
nt|paulg:  although it is uncommon in the Open trials|pg||

nt|brolucius: Interesting bidding hand for E/W.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she is just mixing it up a little|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@C is playable, of course.|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h should be constructive|pg||
nt|paulg:  as they play weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|paulg:  i expect Kaye will pass, eventually|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East could be sure of 5 clubs with West, she might see the chance of a high club contract.|pg||
nt|athene: you might try 3@C i suppose|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: but probably pass is ok|pg||

nt|athene: 3@C should also be constructive of course - you don't bid 3@C there with a weak hand just to rescue partner from 2@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even 5@C from East is not unreasonable now.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|athene: this is a bit like climbing everest with no oxygen though|pg||
nt|athene: getting slower and slower and harder every bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps East did need to do more. West can visualize several losers. |pg||
nt|brolucius: East has only 1 diamonds and a wonderful @SK-Q-x. How can West know that?|pg||
nt|reisig: Perhaps???|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, partner almost certainly has a singleton heart too|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well bid!|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C was certainly ridiculous|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: i mean if she thought it was non forcing it was a massive underbid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sigh, we are not linked. 23 already played in the closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me find the result|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers suggest 4@D over 3@C. Yes, that would have been an accurate move.|pg||
nt|athene: east should splinter over 3@C perhaps yes|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe just bid a boring 5@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW 5@C  600|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North led a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unlucky|pg||
nt|athene: maybe east thought 4@C was forcing, but i really doubt they have this exact sequence set in stone in their notes|pg||
nt|athene: and unless it's set in stone you don't risk it|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it was lucky that declarer didn't make a few more tricks, if she had a trump lead|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason whatsoever for 4@C to be forcing after 2@H, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: even if they have the agreement that 4minor is forcing in constructive auctions|pg||
nt|athene: they have both limited their hands|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H non forcing and 3@C non forcing|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't see how you can suddenly decide 4@C is forcing|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

pc|d9|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: West may be facing something of a guess here|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|c2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|dburn: she has to do something with the fourth spade|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|dburn: but best is to ruff another heart, then play for spades 3-3 if the @hJ does not fall|pg||
nt|athene: ruffing hearts would be ok if the jack falls or spades are 3-3 or there is a major suit squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: so you surely don't bank all on a ruffing finesse against south's @HJ do you?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only if you play against the odds|pg||
nt|brolucius: Three chances are usually better than one in this game.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, this squeeze is something of an illusion|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ruffing now is significantly better. It's not even close|pg||
mc|10|nt|dburn: you have yet to concede a trump trick, and when you do that, they will play a spade|pg||
pg||

nt|paulg:  the second-placed Ireland team is losing heavily at the moment, so this match is very important for both teams|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if you want to set up the squeeze you had to concede the trump earlier - after the first heart ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: otherwise a spade back doesn't let you cash the remaining trumps first|pg||
nt|brolucius: After climbing a slippery staircase to bid 5@C it was a shame to go down.|pg||
nt|athene: they fell off a precipice :)|pg||
nt|athene: or down a precipice - whatever you do with them|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: I eat them|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: haha is that some danish word for a delicious pastry?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some sort of raw fish. I dare say. (Preserved in soap).|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s now will get them to slam|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: nonsense, danish pastries are the stuff of life|pg||
nt|athene: ok, another sort of interesting bidding issue here|pg||
nt|paulg:  the question is just the level that they stop|pg||
nt|athene: does east think that 3@C is like a normal jump shift?|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. does she think it's as strong as 1@D - @H; 3@C uncontested?|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D - 1@H; 3@C|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|athene: i see people often have misunderstandings here where responder passes these jumps in new suits|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C is game-forcing opposite 1@H, but just showing extra (surely) opposite a negative double.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West may bid 7@D you know|pg||
nt|athene: well, yes, maybe, but that "surely" is a hole that it's easy to fall down|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not if she thinks 3@C was NF.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not with any accuracy of course|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought opener has to cue to set up a game force|pg||
nt|athene: without any special agreements|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West cannot bid a grand. That would be absurd on this auction. East did not bid 5@H.|pg||
mb|7D|nt|Walddk2: what did I say?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Your bidding is as good as West's...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  so, as coach after the event, do you say 'well bid' or 'you were lucky'?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Scots were perhaps a bit lucky in the first half, but things even out in the long run|pg||

nt|yo_yo: silly only when you see the full hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: rerehi|pg||
nt|mamos: NIBU giving Ireland a rough time in their match so these two teams are probably the leading teams in the competition  with Scotland some way ahead |pg||

nt|roghog: 6@c for the imaginative now. yes, you'd make it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: 5@D would be a save if vulnerability level or reversed|pg||
nt|dburn: not all that imaginative - you have a lot of points and a lot of clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah that's how she showed it :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: and with the slam in the bag the scots are in the box seat|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mikeirl: nice bid 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: four hearts, on the other hand, is imaginative|pg||
nt|yo_yo: liz daren't bid 6 with those 4 small spades|pg||
nt|roghog: less imaginative|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 3@D is a bergen raise,  4+@H and 10-12 points (or thereabouts)|pg||
nt|lark20: The benefit of weak 2 openers|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it will make, so it may not be an excess of imagination|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with lebensohl there are ways of showing 4@H with a @S stop or without a @S stop|pg||
nt|dburn: just spoken to the England captain - or rather, I was speaking while he was chuntering|pg||
nt|dburn: so I hope he doesn't see 4@h make on this deal|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: another coffee hand |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Lizzie Godfrey probably safer to win this|pg||
nt|eamongall: True ... they want to make sure they arrive in plenty of time for the tea and biscuits|pg||
nt|kemperg: on pass W had a problem already, would u have bid?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: ace looks safest here; you don't want king - ruff - diamond to ace - club ruff|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: if that is a weak jump overcall then i think it is perverse|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in case it's a singleton|pg||
nt|roghog: has to avoid losing three trump tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm so your law isnt foolproof david?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, we shall see|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has to time this quite carefully to make i fancy|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer needs to draw two trumps, cash four diamonds, two clubs and a spade, then lead a spade towards @h10 en passant|pg||
nt|dburn: the trick is to begin by cashing the diamonds - then, you know that four of them will live|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wish i could work all that out as fast as you|pg||
nt|dburn: but if you decide not to believe North's @hQ on the second round, you may go astray|pg||
nt|dburn: that is, further astray than you have already gone|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: yes timing is the issue plus declarer must forsee the hoped for distribution and ending|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no   neither can i|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's the operator :)|pg||
nt|athene: she led a heart to the ace i am sure, on the basis that if anyone was void in trumps it would be west, given the (apparently) short-suit lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: also the possibility opposite a passed pard of going for a telephone number is very real|pg||

nt|mamos: by East I mean|pg||
nt|capercliff: by East yes, but W has to swallow it now I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: insurance comes into it here i think|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is indeed going off, so its not a double game swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: onishuk should manage a noise ...but this noise was unexpected |pg||
nt|chick: a noise like a very loud double :)|pg||
nt|eamongall: might make though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another way to find game:)|pg||
nt|mamos: still double figure imps|pg||
nt|mamos: or close|pg||
nt|capercliff: myu feeling is that West should bid to the 3-level right away|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: if the @C8 were the @C9 this would be a much better contract|pg||
nt|eamongall: there is 9 tricks by scoring the @Hk|pg||

nt|athene: no problems in the play here with trumps 3-2 and both black cards right|pg||
nt|mikeirl: duck will give problem to declarer, wd|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: this looks doomed with clubs 4-2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: there is a huge difference between having a singleton and a doubleton in partner's long suit - it's a reasonable decision to take a shot at 3nt with that north hand if you think ...|pg||
nt|athene: partner is balanced|pg||
nt|jcomyn: jeepers no excitement here at all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bryony did well to bid that awful suit|pg||
nt|capercliff: but her hand improves a lot after the 3@c bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: yesfinely judged may need to be a little careful to make the maax|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: declarer's only concern really is a 4-1 trump break|pg||

nt|athene: but if she can have a singleton club the odds start going down very quickly|pg||
nt|mikeirl: oh|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ooooh sneaky|pg||
nt|roswolf: really????///////|pg||
nt|roswolf: england made the grand on 24 = +11 imps|pg||

pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: are they playing 2/1 gf?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: auctions beginning 1@D - 2@C are very tricky without a lot of methods; many pairs have some special way to show 4-4-4-1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: their cc is the shortest one i have ever seen|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chilloncan: is this the actual auction?|pg||

nt|athene: 3@S asking for minors i assume|pg||
nt|mikeirl: off to a good start|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sensible as the 4-4 fit might well produce an extra trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2 of those 5 are partscores that could easily have been in game, so it's not clear they are pluses for the IMPs |pg||
nt|kemperg: trump start|pg||

nt|mikeirl: no but 2nt was & fit showing|pg||
nt|kemperg: of coarse|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but they are not in it|pg||
nt|capercliff: actually only 6@d|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: she will take the spade finesse early and then try to cash everything hoping for 3-3 clubs or a heart-club squeeze i imagine|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|athene: entries slightly tangled though|pg||
nt|chick: true :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: i am not a fan of competing when balanced |pg||
nt|athene: south probably decided it was love all and hence vigorous partscore competition was the order of the day|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzaz: Toilet break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who for :)|pg||
nt|ady: south got opps of the hook   no real fit  and not a lot of power    but has found a suitable dummy|pg||
nt|athene: one alternative plan was to pass, wait until opps bid spades, and then double for takeout - if partner passes, you are happy, but if she bids clubs you go to diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but with Kx you aren't expecting partner to be passing a t/o x very often i suppose|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: maybe give up on the spade finesse since no chances for 4 spade tricks anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is ok due to the lucky @H lie|pg||
nt|roghog: tempting to bid 4@h on such a good suit, but 3NT should be OK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: luckily for Punch the clubs are behaving|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she will have a few anxious moments though|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup actually a very fortunate hand - the scots cant complain too much about their good luck in this set so far|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am expecting 180 imps shared after 32 boards once Wales start scoring a few goals|pg||
nt|capercliff: but I think this is impossible to bid|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|athene: and of course this plan has the flaw that there is no "double (takeout)" card in the box - only a double card|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: so if you think partner might misunderstand double...|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dQ|nt|athene: east can see she has to keep that @C10xxx whatever else :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s2|pc|d8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mamos: East doesnt know if she's making this yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: she soon will|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: yes i am always nervous when making a take out double in these positions|pg||

nt|ralfwil: is this correct?|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s just have to grit their teeth and follow suit|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|athene: @S10, @HA, @CK, spades|pg||

nt|mikeirl: 6s here |pg||
nt|roghog: correctly playing a @D now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: all to no avail though|pg||

nt|athene: heart lead, ace and another diamond...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if W wont bid with that hand, i dont know where she thinks 36 IMPs are going to come from|pg||
nt|roswolf: a polish 1nt would have been useful here|pg||

nt|mamos: 3@s wow|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: what would double be?|pg||
nt|athene: @DQxx is bad though |pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's that?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4 of the other major + longer minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: and decent values|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kemperg: too good for that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: double again or 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog: I prefer to double again now, but 3@d is fine|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled @H may be lost now|pg||
nt|dburn: it is fine if it implies hearts, but that is not a universal treatment|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hate it when partner jumps in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you are very fearful of east leading a short diamond against your club contract and getting ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: also south is in the pre-balancing seat|pg||
nt|golfsquash: trump promotion|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7 loser hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: sensible spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: needs trump leads  and 3 too hiigh|pg||
nt|athene: now if you play the queen and opps carry on with hearts you are doomed - but if south attacks spades, declarer might get home with two spades, four clubs, two hearts, one diamond|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: worth noting that north leads a heart rather than a spade - that's pretty much routine|pg||
nt|athene: with only four card suits you lead the one NOT headed by the ace|pg||
nt|athene: but south might find it hard to take the deep finesse against dummy - i think she should, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont blame north for passing|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|athene: well done|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|eamongall: what do we suggest she bid and when |pg||
nt|chick: I think she is showing good discipline, knowing her partner is stacked in whatever trump they land in|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: WALDDK7 -WAS THAT REMRK SENT TO ME\/|pg||
nt|eamongall: a partner of mine always says ... "if you got a bidding issue , give me a suggested auction " |pg||
nt|dburn: nor I - this is usually just a strong jump overcall in diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: i feel Bryony should have bid on here|pg||

pc|h8|nt|jcomyn: stuck with this play|pg||

nt|roswolf: 12 more imps to england on 25 scotland in 51DX -3|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@DX|pg||
pc|sA|nt|capercliff: is she thinking to ruff this high?|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 26 england in 4@S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: play north for KJx not J10x|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ady: this  way also good enough|pg||
nt|chilloncan: passing at any and/or all turns MIGHT be right of course on any given deal....but if you dont bid at favorable  with 75 shape and approximately a 4 loser hand, you'll be fighting a ...|pg||

nt|mamos: disconcerted|pg||
nt|mamos: how likely weas West to have six Hearts?|pg||
nt|mamos: AKxxxx|pg||
nt|mamos: would have opened 4@h with that|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|dburn: there was not much risk to a second double - partner did pass over 2@s, so will probably not jump in clubs (or anything else)|pg||
nt|lark20: 4@H is on I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: ANOTHER 15 IMPS TO ENGLAND ON 26 82- 58 NOW|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: well done by south again not to be tempted by that spade singleton in dummy|pg||

nt|athene: north might well end up declaring the notrumps|pg||
nt|ady: can see 7 tricks    will be difficult with no communications|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead in 3nt you are going to have to get the clubs right|pg||
nt|athene: and no reason to do that|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm unusual|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C 2@D 2@H 2@S 3@D 3N if kokish for example|pg||
nt|golfsquash: I'm not sure what the good view is|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: and the english captain said that would be certifiable :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: hnn emaciated vu overcall by east|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|athene: there was a hand last night where someone had a 5431 with a 5-card major and it was suggested they might open 2@C and rebid 2NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could get murky|pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyone for 2NT with the east hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|roghog: a bit weak, but count me in|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a little stomach churning|pg||
nt|lark20: yes especially with such a poor heart suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@S shows 5+ spades and 4+ minor|pg||
nt|eamongall: that was a Tartan 2@S .. 5 @S and a minor 2-10 hcp |pg||
mb|4D|nt|chilloncan: I was expecting a 3D bid from S. |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: England NPC has taken some more heart and blood pressure pills|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 27 england in 3nt on a @H lead and likely to lose an imp|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: it would have to be an immediate club finesse, too, so you have entries to unblock them and then take the diamond finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i remember the quote yes :)|pg||
nt|athene: no way north will do that|pg||
nt|kemperg: unavoidable|pg||
nt|mikeirl: can they take treir 4 tricks?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lucky Bryony, the @H blocked|pg||
nt|roswolf: well teach them a sharp lesson - bid game when you can be passed out in partscore|pg||
nt|capercliff: this needs a @d lead, 6@s|pg||
mb|5C|nt|roghog: I'm told the beer card is the tia maria card in women's bridge. not sure if my source is authoritative|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: after this bidding? yes|pg||
nt|mikeirl: u sure:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont know their signals|pg||
nt|mikeirl: low encouraging|pg||
nt|kemperg: and all other cards nothing special?|pg||

mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: yep |pg||

nt|ady: east did well not to touch diamonds|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: the only way declarer might have got that one right is if she somehow knew the hearts were 6-3|pg||
nt|chick: NS CC clearly states 5+ spades, 4+ minor|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||

nt|jcomyn: sorry she didnt think at all|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer wondering, is this a Grosvenor i see before me?|pg||
nt|chick: whatever it is called :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chilloncan: for those unfamiliar with Tartan Twos -- or their popular cousin, Muiderberg -- the underlying philosophy is basically: "let's push the opps to a game they might well not bid ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: otherwise, and also tell them how to make it when they might well go down if we stayed silent"|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|capercliff: did 4@s go off as well?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: this is true|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer might go wrong and rise with the king on a small diamond return|pg||
nt|athene: if she tries the queen and it loses, the defence can take the spade ace out of dummy before the clubs are unblocked|pg||

mb|p|nt|mikeirl: routine 3nt Ew|pg||
nt|mikeirl: undo|pg||
nt|roswolf: lucky to escape the axe|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: west sort of has the values for 2@H but it's a very bad hand, with three small in spades, especially playing 4-card majors|pg||
nt|eamongall: not sure the 4 card major goes as far as opening with a 5 card on the side :)|pg||

nt|jcomyn: thats enough|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@h?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: double there tends to be takeout of spades - i.e. west couldn't double the first time because of short spades|pg||
nt|athene: well, north might feel she ought to get around to showing some spade support some time?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: PASS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she's brave that Bryony|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ady: 2@S  from south |pg||
nt|yo_yo: would it not show the other 2 suits?|pg||
nt|athene: it's fairly aggressive with only 11 hcp and 3 diamonds - one of the suits partner is going to be bidding a lot|pg||
nt|athene: but at love all west wants to bid i suppose|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 3NT can also make|pg||
nt|chick: apparently not (although the @D suit definitely stinks) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for results and standings after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|roswolf: if west bids the axe will fall|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ady: decent game |pg||
nt|athene: run the @S10 first time to cater for Qxxx with east?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: you aren't missing many points - if you think the double has to have 12+ then west has to have the @SQ|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but need to ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|ady: need to ruff a diamond    with A@C a good bet to be right  can make 10 tricks losing a spade|pg||
nt|athene: yes, unless hearts are 3-3, which they really shouldn't be|pg||
nt|golfsquash: seems best to win and play a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: maybe declarer is a bit worried about trump control - let's say diamonds are 4-4 and trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: if she ruffs a diamond then loses to the @SQ and gets forced again, she can't enjoy the @CK|pg||

nt|brolucius: It all goes to show how right Kaye was to let the bidding die in 2@D. She had already shown her hand.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|brolucius: Yes, that East hand is one where, even in Chandlers Ford, players would respond 1@S.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C is enterprising|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: very aggressive 3@C on a 6322 with defensive side honours; of course it might overcompete the hand but at favourable vulnerability people like to annoy the opponents|pg||
nt|paulg:  if Youngs knew Punch better then she might have doubled 3@c .. just in case her partner had clubs too|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  3NT looks the normal contract but they are a little short of tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: I can see how to make 1NT. I wonder if Youngs can see a path to 3NT.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: on the previous board north and south both had 4333 shape and had few tricks as a result|pg||
nt|paulg:  without the club lead there are chances of 9th trick|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|athene: south has no playing strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: neither has East...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Maybe East would have bid only 2NT on her hand, without the 3@C intervention.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|athene: east, sorry|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: I wouldn't say that - South will probably take more tricks than any other hand|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dT|pc|h7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: but with three aces facing an opening bid, East was going to bid a game of some sort|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h4|pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Partner's opening was vulnerable, it is true.|pg||
nt|dburn: it would be heresy nowadays to suggest, of course, that West doesn't have an opening bid|pg||

nt|capercliff: the last hand of this match now|pg||
nt|mamos: no tricks and no fit for Ew 12 + 12 can the  Scots stay out of trouble and gain |pg||
nt|roswolf: england went off in the slam on 29 and the unofficial score o 82-82|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mamos: frankly I doubt it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lark20: As you said there can be big swings on part-score hands|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: Thaks specs and our operator for a good job|pg||
nt|mikeirl: thanks all|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|athene: you would expect people to play 3nt or 4@H here rather than 5@D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why7 bid 2c vul opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: that is a mildly evil 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i know 2@C over 1@D has good pre-emptive effect, but you really do need either a club suit or a hand, or preferably both, at adverse vul|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she feels that as a passed hand it is ok|pg||
nt|athene: because at least her partner won't do anything rash, like taking her seriously|pg||
nt|jcomyn: grand especially when someopne whacks you for 800|pg||
nt|athene: south might well just pass this|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: not easy to reach game with 14 facing a passed hand and no great fit|pg||
nt|eamongall: I still expect Wales to come storming back in session 2 of this match ... they have won 1 and draw 1 so far |pg||
nt|roswolf: 84-82 to scotland is the semi- official score on the bridgemates|pg||
nt|mamos: better played from West than East  (no Club lead)|pg||
