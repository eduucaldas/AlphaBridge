mb|p|nt|pef: I believe we are now down to 12 teams in the main event, with 4 unbeatens and 8 who have lost once.  It's sort of a double elimination format (sort of because placement in the ...|pg||
nt|pef: round robin counted towards whether you went into the knockout stage with one or zero losses recorded)|pg||

nt|panja: Good Morning all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|pef: does anyone know sementa and duboins methods well enough to explain why sementa's hand didn't quality for a non-vul weak 2 bid?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Joe, yes the top 8 qualifiers got two lives|pg||
nt|fluffy: I am no expert on neither pair's system, I am surprised that Sementa didn't open with a preempt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here is the system card for the great Duboin-Sementa pairing http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome all to this prestigious Yeh Brothers toruniy |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not good enough I expect|pg||
nt|fluffy: It might be simply a suit quality problem given the position|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: good morning|pg||
nt|mrdct: need to be in 3NT rather than 5@d here|pg||
nt|jcwla: A singleton ask will get them there.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or not needed.|pg||
nt|kemperg: change the names please|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Germ, all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Germ and Gonzalo|pg||
nt|fluffy: Open room saw north open a weak NT, wich buried the diamond fit after the heart overcall, now south is poalying 6@c with the bad split|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Raija |pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|pef: east west rate to end up in 4 of one of the majors|pg||
nt|fluffy: second position is the worst position to preempt and you want the preempts to be pure suposedly. Third position, on the other hand is a different story as Mark Lair just showed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hold on we will get names in |pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: west showing his minor 2-suiter|pg||
nt|kareno: 5 of a minor will likely make e/w but n/s have a huge spade fit so they will likely not sell at that level.|pg||
nt|frankaus: $US 100,000 to winners !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d by east is best to minimise the chance of a @c ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx |pg||
nt|mrdct: welcome back to wuxi|pg||

nt|baldfriede: Hello. Nice to be not alone.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello and welcome to the 4th round of the qualification for the YEH Bros. Cup.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: welcome all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants online at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/Systems_Open.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: very pretigious event each year |pg||
nt|mrdct: east telling partner he has equal length in the minors|pg||
nt|kareno: West likely will bid clubs - then we'll see what north does.  Exciting from the get go!!|pg||

nt|kareno: Welcome Henry Bethe :)|pg||

nt|kemperg: has squeeze possibillyties|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|fluffy: in 6@c you have 2 ways of going down (@d-@s squeeze and the wrong finese)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I think 4NT is natural|pg||
nt|fluffy: showing a minimum hand with good hearts not willing to go to the 5 level|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|mrdct: this match is from the top half of the draw so the winner plays another undefeated team from the top half and the loser plays a winner from the bottom half of the draw|pg||

nt|mrdct: possibly that was just the contract not the auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  Greetings|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt by south works fine!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Gary.|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugrapha4: Not the real auction, but i got here too late|pg||
nt|frankaus: team members ay - http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/entries.aspx|pg||
nt|kareno: South's double doesn't make sense to me - he doesn't want to defend.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fine auction:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Gary and Jordan|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi G|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi G.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there is an aggresive start from N here to Dbl in balanced posision here|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if it was singlesuited  |pg||
nt|mikael_w: I guess RE DBL is best from N now|pg||
nt|sybarra: which barely qualifies for me as such|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mrdct: @HAQ protected now, although @s lead and @h through will put some presure on declarer|pg||
nt|benjy: Would you guys bid 1@S over a X? I wouldn't dream of it|pg||
nt|pef: they were going for 4 in 4c, but hard for sementa to do anything but bid 4 hearts there|pg||
nt|pef: this should be pretty dull in the play--making exactly 5 would seem completely normal|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this match very close at the half|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: but 6 of a minor still a good save|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine Precision e/w|pg||
nt|peachy: The USA Hampson team both pairs play Precision type system|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not exactly a predicted auction but they've gotten to the normal spot.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Prakash good to see you again|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|kemperg: and Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like -1 , -1 is good bridge some say|pg||
nt|frankaus: i play lots of good bridge  by that measure|pg||
nt|fluffy: Mark had just 1 shot to decide for a contract, and he settled for slam in clubs, the suit quality had a great impact|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3D = ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both of our pairs using transfer responses over 1@C  and as we see here -- in competition|pg||
nt|kareno: When you save over the five-level you have to be RIGHT.  If they cannot make 5 you are wrong and if they can make six and bid it, you are wrong.|pg||
nt|kareno: You need mirrors to defeat 5@c|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes its right to take out insurance enen if ur -1 in both directions|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: And actually if west ducks the improbable heart lead, it will make too.|pg||
nt|mrdct: it would be a bad start to the match to defend 5@cx making when you are cold for 5@s yourself|pg||
nt|frankaus: exciting hand to get us on the way|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@d - anyone know what that is?|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a limit raise of @s with no shortages|pg||
nt|frankaus: duessing  - good @S raise|pg||
nt|frankaus: guessing|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm hearing limit, no short suit ... and Bergen.|pg||
nt|kareno: In any event, Bocchi's sniffer is working hard!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: CC from 2010 Euro is  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is he bids one more....your guess?|pg||
nt|frankaus: bochhi's hand hast little defence|pg||
nt|kareno: The 4-1 split may make things rocky for declarer.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like some sort of lebensohl variant here with south probably showing 4@s and no @h stopper|pg||
nt|mrdct: 8 top tricks and 9th can come in either red suit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kareno: He's all offense and no defense!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Friederike, all|pg||
nt|kareno: But happily for declarer, that is quite unlikely - more likely with the auction, however.|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Xu|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes i play great bridge  ( i go -2) LOL|pg||
nt|mrdct: and there is the 9th trick - now looking for a 10th|pg||
nt|panja: this can go down on promotion|pg||
nt|mikael_w: lol. I agree Shirely :) But do we know is singlesuited or do we guess that ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guessed |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fluffy: some specs, better players than me said that having 3 spades, specially with a honnot is a negative factor for preempting in another suit, I don't agree, but they are better than ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: me so they should know! :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mrdct: easy make on the @s lead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: system aside, opening a hand with 8.5 losers and a 4333 11 count is swimming against the current|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyway, the idea is you want to have a singleton ask in place in case your @D's were say headed by Q instead of K.|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unable to enlighten you as to all these meaningsm sorry|pg||
nt|panja: thx Gary, Good evening...morning here, of course|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mrdct: @h lead less attractive now|pg||
nt|sybarra: you sound like an auctioneer Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i think joe will run for border|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Peter|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: Are e/w names surnames or first names, Operator?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: np Andrew welcome all|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not mad about his pass particularly if south's first bid showed as many as four spades with invitation.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North is  Hackett|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello and welcome to the 5th round of the qualification for the YEH Bros. Cup.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugrapha4: Hi Gary, I'll check when I can|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's customary in most parts of asia to use first names|pg||
nt|fluffy: he risks facing dummy with @c singleton and decent diamons (even 5 cards possible), but what he doesn't want in any way is to face @dQxxx or @dJxxx|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude    Klinger-Mullamphy odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: surnames only please|pg||
nt|peachy: I, too, think Jow ill take his nine and then see what is left|pg||
nt|peachy: *Joe|pg||
nt|panja: no more entry to Dummy to finesse trumps..if defenders don't help|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: late afternoon here and the 4 day break starts tomorrow|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this will not make, but e/w will make 1 nt so it will not be a big swing|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcarroll: Nice competitive bidding to push EW to the limit|pg||
nt|fluffy: and play in 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, 10 actually already|pg||
nt|wygbe1: well defended|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am guessing that the 3D was artificial allowing E to distinguish later between a supershapely hand with slam intrerest and same without slam interest|pg||
nt|chilloncan: we  dont know|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: these names are left over from previous match|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will go down 2 but give Netherlands an IMP.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing that EW  are Verhees - van Prooijen|pg||
nt|henryb:  You do not know whether declarer's @h are that robust. Coult easily be AJx|pg||
nt|chilloncan: my idea is that a direct 3H over 2N might have indicated slam interest|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kareno: Declarer relieved I'm sure.  And now diamond finesse for safety.|pg||
nt|kareno: It can be effective - it's perfectly normal for Meckwell, one of the world's premier pairs.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: also normal for a lopt of ineffective pairs. i have a strange hunch Meckwell would occasionally win even if they didnt open these:)|pg||
nt|pelu: hi spec's can u explain 1NT on 5 card @s by Cheek - bluff??|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mrdct: as first name is usually but not always the family name|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes need to hook or duck a @d to maintain communication to the entryless dummy|pg||
nt|kareno: I am told: first name. Hiroki Yokoi and  Kazuo Furuta.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and now we see 2 @s was played in OR as well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|frankaus: 12 is a nice start|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed, in a short match too.|pg||
nt|mrdct: running scores: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=1&tourid=902|pg||
nt|kareno: I assume this is a round robin phase.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 10 rounds of swiss|pg||
nt|panja: no, not 1@S for me, I would never...|pg||
nt|benjy: I think North should get this right|pg||
nt|benjy: the only time it is wrong to play a @C is when west is 4432 without the @DQ|pg||
nt|benjy: but if he held that hand then he prob wouldn't bid 2@H|pg||
nt|wygbe1: n may be concerned that s has spade king|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we are bemused by S's 1NT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk3: http://tinyurl.com/3dtwfd9  for standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Friederike|pg||
nt|kareno: I knew those were first names - but I have TWO first names so wasn't sure :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Well done!!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: such an agreement could be very useful, but it might more or less oblige opener to raise 2D on three fairly freely. thought they might have a way around that too|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|panja: South's @S7 should indicate he does not have @SK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: Hi Friedirike|pg||
nt|wygbe1: souths carding was pretty informative though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these bids are not even about winning IMPs on the immediate deal. they simply send a message "you are in for a fight at every turn"|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|mrdct: when i used to work in Indonesia I was always called Mr David by my staff|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kemperg: no problems left|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Well, declarer does not know that yet.|pg||
nt|kemperg: lookes like a double squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably need page 234 of system notes for them|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kemperg: @D not 31|pg||
nt|fluffy: the way it has gone, he now also has another way to make: score his trumps separatelly!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kareno: More information: both professional players. W:20's, E:early 30's.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|baldfriede: Going down three now. Commentator's curse.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only person who calls me 'Miss Karen' is my doctor's receptionist :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have pitched a @s from dummy, cashed one high club before running @d|pg||
nt|benjy: A chance missed|pg||
nt|chilloncan: my copy was stolen by nternational jewel thieves|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and there Bocchi for sure treated N hand as single suited :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pef: and now a quick claim|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: in Open, W  only bid 2@S and S is now in 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: just ruff down hearts and spades, and make his 6 trumps tricks with 3@s and @dAK +@hAfor a total or 12|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fluffy: in the last trick @dQ and @cJ will kill each other|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: marked finesse|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chilloncan: depending on trick target and entries, low to the ace may be better. it drops the stiff king when such obtains, and it  can make the second round decision easier|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kareno: No matter, I don't think a squeeze would operate.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think we'll see a @c finesse here|pg||
nt|kareno: Had south ducked this, west would have been in trouble.  |pg||
nt|dburn: well, maybe|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kareno: But that's more elegant :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: NS must be Burgess-Courtney   since they're playing 4-handed|pg||
nt|henryb:  Cheek and Grue do not like to pass partner's opening (limited) opening bids, and will respond 1N with very bad hands no matter what their shape|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

nt|bbramley: in 4@H, say you ruff the 2nd @S and lead a @D - they must fly and tap again - now duck a club|pg||

nt|chilloncan: maybe first time partnership that hasnt discussed NT range...maybe this event converted to Individual|pg||
nt|mcarroll: indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: WD|pg||
nt|mrdct: new leader!|pg||
nt|kareno: An IMP is an IMP!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: they all count|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have a good save in 4@s here vs 4@h for NS|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I wonder what Dbl on 2@c was ? If it shows cards I think E was a little to week not to Dbl. But if Dbl over 2@c just showed something in @c it was nothing to sat about it|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bocchi bid 2 @C for the majors  and ended in same spot |pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi there David :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Board 17 - contract and result confirmed|pg||
nt|kareno: Who here hasn't lost or won a match by an IMP?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i certainly have|pg||
nt|chilloncan: as so often, 3N had better chances|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suspect that is South's opening, not East's|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: mark has a bit of a problem here, values to overcall, but the 5 card suit is terrible|pg||
nt|santyclz: And the 4 isn't quite up to snuff for a 4 card overcall.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello Peter, Gary|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not think East opened|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: agree|pg||
nt|pelu: in a short time ww expt undo - S: 1@d|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|algraves:  hello|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Allan|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hello Alan|pg||
nt|kemperg: not the obvious bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: I overcall often with 4 card diamonds, so any 5 card suit would do the trick for me|pg||
nt|pef: especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome frank  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: that hand showed how impirtant it is to open the bidding when you have an opening bid|pg||
nt|panja: will NS make 3Nt on @D lead here?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I like the format of this tournament, the top 8 qualifiers get 2 lives in the finals, the next 8 get 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome David|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other tables visible using  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@c likely a diamond raise.|pg||
nt|mrdct: the top 15 teams plus Mr Yeh's team qualify for the KO stage with the top 8 (including Mr Yeh) getting a double KO advantage|pg||
nt|frankaus: is this correct or did we have a pass missed?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this a trap pass|pg||
nt|benjy: Do you guys rebid 2@S here?|pg||
nt|pef: 2 hearts may be weak with both 5 spades and 4+ hearts.  that's a fairly common treatment these days|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@h is a convention that shows 5@s, 4@h and 5-8 points I think, Duboin is lieing about his strenght|pg||
nt|pef: some play it as weak as duboin's hand, actually|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: round 1 results here http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResultKnockout.aspx?section=b6b714a8-e406-4ec7-bdb2-fd1c39596dce&round=1&tourid=902|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: convention cards for participants at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/Systems_Open.html|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 2@C alerted|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excellent|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c is a transfer to 2@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s on ice here|pg||
nt|henryb:  or tied and gone on to win in OT|pg||
nt|mrdct: i haven't had that good fortune|pg||
nt|algraves:  lilght overcall at favourable vulnerability opp passed partner looking to pre empt or find a profitable save|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how many spades do we play or how many hts?|pg||
nt|pef: the end result may be to prevent north/south from getting to a making vulnerable 3nt or 5 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Richman-Griffiths playing previous board in 5@C|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like eight tricks is the limit for both sides.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: curious 2H bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  or lost in OT|pg||
nt|panja: EW have Aces, NS, the middle cards..|pg||
nt|benjy: or 2@D?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|frankaus: red 2@D overcall would not be everybody's choice|pg||
nt|kareno: Mixed raise I imagine - 4 trumps and 6-9|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|kareno: Wrong vulnerability for n/s to compete further.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s the likely spot for EW now|pg||
nt|sybarra: some sort of drury |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: two easy boards to start|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3@d aSKS FOR STOPPERS IN 1D; i PRESUME:|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oops,sorry|pg||
nt|chilloncan: once more into the breach, my firends|pg||
nt|mrdct: no obvious source of tricks for declarer here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not a textbook double -- but often as here @C's will be long -- but in Geoff's hand too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ew have a @S partial|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6NT -1 in OR|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet JoAnn comes in now |pg||
nt|pef: 3 hearts will be down 2 or 3, but a great result for the Chang team, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: I would hate to X with 2-2 in major and 4 card @D - better 1NT would be my bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   1@S= either   bal 6-9 or 13+   OR   4+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this structure  1@C-1N = 10-12|pg||
nt|chilloncan: another 8.5 loser hand, but this time a viut of shape and favorable colors|pg||
nt|chilloncan: slam on 2 hooks|pg||
nt|panja: good....|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: stoppers in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: no fear for joe grue|pg||
nt|kareno: Big bid by Joe Grue|pg||
nt|kemperg: or dbl:(|pg||
nt|algraves:  east sees no reason the bid with such good defense|pg||
nt|mcarroll: same auction in OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Hampton made 4@S on1 for a 10 imp leap|pg||
nt|frankaus: last board east 27 had zars so a clear opening|pg||
nt|sybarra: Lavazza, by virtue of going undefeated thru the Top 8 of the Qualifiers  has a 6.5 imp carryover  [bbo doesn't do decimals]|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: EW had 3NT with the 2-2 @D break|pg||
nt|henryb:  and likely to give back the imp from board 1 with interest|pg||
nt|mrdct: best defence should get this for 500|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: awkward choice for south|pg||
nt|sybarra: some have suggested she should bid 4 right away|pg||
nt|fluffy: you mean for Lavazza team, Chang missed the cold 3NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a cc for Sementa-Duboin http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|pef: sorry, yes, I mean the lavazza team|pg||
nt|panja: should be cold now..|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Now stop, or else.|pg||
nt|kemperg: Not for the OR, NS in 4@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 1|pg||
nt|kemperg: not sure of the meaning of 3@C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: whatever it is it seems a bit pushy opposite a possible flat 15 count|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I was told 3@c is puppet; I thought it was a real suit.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: board 1 was flat, this won't be :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I would want to be there |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from (very temporarily) summer-like central Pennsylvania, USA.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi ed|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Ed |pg||
nt|sybarra: hence the score|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugrapha4: North is declarer - his favourite seat!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with stif spade opps probably have that suit so hearts and clubs are the same suit, so why emphasize hearts when u can show both>|pg||
nt|bg: S has no confidence in pards vul 2 H call|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah he hasn't conveyed his 2-suiter|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have bid 4@s with Hiroki's hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Good lead.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like he'll scramble for 2 tricks in each suit except @d where he's got one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not the idea contract or start|pg||
nt|henryb:  awfully strong for 1N|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: yep - a likely push|pg||
nt|benjy: the problem with rebidding 2@D is that if partner bids 2NT then 3@S would be forcing, if you start with 2@S then you can rebid 3@D over 2NT as non forcing, but you may lose the @D ...|pg||
nt|benjy: fit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kemperg: Xu did not mark it as conv.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only source of tricks will be the defense :)  Clubs work well for declarer.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s might actually make here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was thinking same |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: So looks like the first swing of the round|pg||
nt|kareno: Dave :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: a more passive lead may have worked better for the defence|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Brother Cavier lives !!|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer may need to guess clubs to make even 3@s|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: EW convention card from 2010 European Championship   http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/poland/buras-narkiewicz.pdf|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Xavier|pg||
nt|kareno: There's a very fine player in Canada, Irv Litvack who is known for his passive leads against 1nt -|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|benjy: Looks like 1 down, if south exits with the K@S which looks normal enough|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: in practice, it makes though |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mrdct: a chance to strip the hand and endplay west to go -1 if the defence isn't sharp|pg||
nt|panja: true, but the issue is also of expected fit|pg||
nt|mikael_w: it looks like 3 @s is maximum for e/w here. But 4 @h is an intresting contrakt for N/S. and after opening from W its makeble for sure|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kiwibridge: these are short matches only 10 boards|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|mcarroll: 10 tricks looks pretty standard|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: and board 1 flat|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you sure it makeable given the club spots?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Kit Woolsey is trying to convert the world from leading from 4 card suits.  [oversimplification]  IF you don't have a 5 card suit -- try to hit partner's length by leading from 3|pg||
nt|algraves:  accurate bidding by NS|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there was little point ducking that one|pg||
nt|panja: since so much part of bridge is stochastic in nature...second chance is a good thing....|pg||
pc|h9|nt|henryb:  I think W is being too subtle|pg||
nt|kareno: That heart seven very revealing.|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But singleton @D led so it went off as the N hand got a @D ruff|pg||
pc|s5|nt|baldfriede: That's why I thought it is real.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s failed in the other room|pg||
nt|chilloncan: to exportone;s reputation, the contracts at stake have to be games or slams:)  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|kemperg: was not nessesary|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to valerie westheimer |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi:-)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Valerie, thanks for joining here|pg||
nt|mrdct: lost my connection for a tick - so this looks like a very good sacrifice|pg||
nt|mrdct: so good that it can actually make|pg||
nt|peachy: hehm the best ones are the ones that make|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: hmm, looks to me like it's making, assuming he guesses spades|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hiya, Roland.|pg||
nt|frankaus: zar petkov  developed a sophisticated hand evaluation method  - link - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might make it if you played West for @cKx|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: the Open Semi-Final and Women's Final are 64 boards matches split into 4 16-board segments|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on this hand it's difficult to decide which if either @H/@S was better for defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 2nd  16-board set in the 64 board Semi-Final   Women are playing the same boards in their Final match|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: +10 for USA in board 1: 4@s bid and made by Hampson !|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: no sorry EW|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Roland|pg||
nt|mrdct: get @s right not a gimme here of course as the hook is kind of indicated on the auction|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kareno: So a fine result for Japan.|pg||
nt|henryb:  lots of interest|pg||
nt|mrdct: 7 or 12 imps for japan - probably 12|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, and there is not much els to play on|pg||
pc|d4|nt|baldfriede: That was not the right idea. Declarer had to discard a @d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|benjy: A spec points out that 2@D also gains when partner bids 2@H|pg||
nt|panja: if I had, say KJT9xx of Spades...I might prefer 2@S..but with Axxxxx, 2@D is ok, or perhaps a little more attractivve|pg||
nt|benjy: I agree, i think i would treat that suit a s a 5 bagger|pg||
nt|benjy: and bid 2@D|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kemperg: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|jcwla: Redouble not an impossibility here, then maybe a bigger hit.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mrdct: west will avoid getting endplayed now|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the closed room the defence cashed @dAK so no @d for declarer|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugrapha4: East is squeezed |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: those results as they come will be updated here http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResultKnockout.aspx?section=b6b714a8-e406-4ec7-bdb2-fd1c39596dce&round=3&tourid=902|pg||

nt|fluffy: Weichsel couldn't see all cards and was focused on gettin 1 off, but if he returned a club he could get many more tricks as Duboin wold lose the control and the diamonds would end ...|pg||

nt|santyclz: Nice defense in a losing cause.|pg||

nt|algraves:  3NT with 9 tricks minimum of course |pg||

nt|mrdct: big difference between +590 and -300|pg||

nt|chilloncan: well worth a look. though that E hand was an opening bid before petrov was born:)|pg||
nt|panja: a Grand now, on B3|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the event is to determine Australia Representatives or 2011 APBF [zone 6 championship] and accompanying Zone 7 playoff  then 2011 Bermuda Bowl/Venice Cup|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 4 card openings for Burgess-Courtney, strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Peter Gill was to opening the South hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S are Paul and Justin Hackett    EW  Adam and Nabil Edgtton (brothers)|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice hand here|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S will be the winner of the contest?|pg||
nt|panja: bidding should witness a @D bid from E sometime now|pg||
nt|panja: 3@H P 4@D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it did and takes up a lot of room|pg||
nt|panja: the most difficult thing for EW, on B3 is to find out about the third round of Clubs..|pg||
nt|panja: W will need to know @CQ, E, !AK...@D void description is the easier part after the opening|pg||
nt|panja: oh well..I didn't consider North's options..right...5@D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I have often wished I had a specific Queen asking bid :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: Burgess-Courtney playing  "4 Card Standard"|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a precision style 2@c|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Finally slam time.|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS could scape home in 3NT here - but partscore more likely i think|pg||
nt|kareno: North left with a winner and a loser.  That @h 7 was the bee's knees :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: A\\Just a bit:)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mrdct: just about make 7@d here|pg||

nt|algraves:  dble shows spades|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Am told Hampson is in 3@s in OR|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: West:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS might try 3NT here - but it has cardiac problems|pg||
nt|panja: 6@D now, surely...|pg||
nt|panja: but the @CQ will be very difficult to find out about|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D for majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Looks like 6@d will fetch here but hard to get there after opening bid by west.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes this is a handtype whee precision pats off|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pays the piper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW were on the winning team in (last month's?) NEC Cup|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@s pass or correct I guess|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s is pass/correct - i.e. interested to play in game opposite a weak 2 in @h|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@H is making|pg||
nt|kemperg: not so easy:(|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes:) ha/ha|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4+@D|pg||
nt|pef: well that was a bit more imps than we expected|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: GSF?|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, in 3@s Duboin, who knew that South had @hA and @dK, was not inclined to play him for @cA also|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mcarroll: Looks like a victory for the weak NT - @S partial on for EW|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Although 1NT no bed of roses|pg||
nt|kemperg: should end in 4@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: was not easy for E to find a dbl:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: White on red first seat making up for the lack of texture and EW really nothing to say.|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl modern style, 1@S = no @S's|pg||
nt|algraves:  presumably 1@S would deny 4+ spades|pg||
nt|mildredb: clever line :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Good one Dave|pg||
nt|sybarra: E likely to back in I think |pg||
nt|sybarra: although at 5 level one too high|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: it was a mere overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart lead would put paid to 7|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt looks normal here.|pg||
nt|fluffy: Huang made soem safety play in trumps to protect from @cA being offside, that wasn't succesful|pg||
nt|frankaus: we used to add length point and basically came to the same conclusions|pg||
nt|dburn: and at the other table the Swedes were not willing to see if the Italians would guess clubs in 4@h, so they sacrificed against it|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: east west at the other table "sacrificed" in 4 hearts doubled for down 6 and -1400|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a really silly sac then|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|baldfriede: I don't see a way to develop a 7th trick.|pg||
nt|kemperg: why duck|pg||
nt|mrdct: curtis needs slightly better @s pips for this to make|pg||
nt|mrdct: west's @HK in gold|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there;s no bee;s knees like slow bee's knees|pg||
nt|mrdct: need accurate defence to beat this|pg||
nt|algraves:  a good treatment for the system freaks out there in my opinion|pg||
nt|pef: it was sort of a forced sac.  east for some reason I don't understand doubled 3nt (west had made a rather|pg||
nt|pef: light negative double of a 1 diamond overcall)|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play|pg||
nt|pef: all roads would seem to lead to 3nt here|pg||
nt|chilloncan: many in this hemisphere would rebid 2D as S to save space|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Griffiths-Richman 2/1|pg||
nt|mrdct: does it? - they might not find their @d fit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that was my point|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@c will still make though i think|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT denies 3@S's|pg||
nt|kemperg: Ah:(|pg||
nt|panja: EW playing Prec, I guess|pg||
nt|panja: now what does each of EW know?|pg||
nt|panja: W knows @D void...and that E has a good hand with @H support|pg||
nt|panja: if E has @Cxxx...|pg||
nt|panja: where will W park the @C loser?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he must have outside values AQ of @S would do|pg||
nt|panja: well...can  you rule out @DA stiff?|pg||
nt|panja: say @SAJxxx,@HKJxx@DA @Cxxx|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the fact that he bid 5N first may be an inference|pg||
nt|panja: the trouble is...a GS needs good % to succeed..you cannot just bid it on a hunch|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we'll see what Duboin makes of it all|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: standard signals for NS     EW upside-down count/attitude  odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Courtney - "I  always wondered what you'd have if you passed throught Bobby, and know we know"|pg||
nt|mrdct: north needs to show a spade splinter and that might get south going|pg||
nt|chilloncan: y|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Can't believe North won't show the strength. Now probably 4@h.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver in 4H|pg||
nt|mrdct: and this|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i prefer 2D on E hand in this situation|pg||
nt|kareno: Huh?  Weak?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: did Fred really duck that|pg||
nt|pef: which isn't cold by any means on a club lead even with a good guess in clubs.  declarer will need to decide whether to go after hearts or spades for a ninth trick|pg||
nt|chilloncan: some danger in it, but its a risk reward judgment|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: the tapping defence in @h looks best double dummy|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there are double dummy lines to find a way to go down, but i would need massive odds to bet against declarer|pg||
nt|chilloncan: weak? red against white fdacing a passed partner|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c had a better chance of making here|pg||
nt|kareno: But could north pass it?  |pg||
nt|algraves:  you put overcaller on lead, and save bidding space on some tricky to bid hands|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fast and furious auction|pg||
nt|fluffy: vulnerability scared EW from competing any further|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this way 4@S North instead of South :)  with some extra info for declarer that won't affect the play|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm sure NS would be more than happy to reach 6@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: *is|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That's the limit here--|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that helps explain the choice of 2@D from last hand -- but in other room West Passed 2@D instead of the false preference with singleton @SQ|pg||
nt|panja: difficult for South now..|pg||
nt|benjy: 2nt scramble looks normal|pg||
nt|wygbe1: presumably n plans to correct clubs to diam, or bid diam over 2nt|pg||
nt|benjy: why would you correct 3@C? surely you would pass|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks for the kind invite but no thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  4@s needs a @c shift at trick 2 to beat|pg||
nt|kareno: Won't a spade shift work as well?|pg||
nt|algraves:  3NT is a make here|pg||
nt|panja: it is far better for North to bid 1@H first time..than to try and reopen at two level|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Sementa knows he's facing a very good 4@H|pg||
nt|panja: do we have the meaning of 5Nt from the table?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well bid and we see why these guys are one of the tops in the world|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: duh   of course Dyke rebid 2@H|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d only?  I wonder if their responses to takeout doubles are peculiar.|pg||
nt|algraves:  presumably 3@C did not promise great hand, as 2@Sfor that|pg||
nt|mrdct: so they've successfully diagnosed the lack of a @h stopper and stopped in 3@d|pg||
nt|mildredb: they must have heard you VW|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D without real @D or 3-card @H support?  Not sure many would do that.|pg||
nt|frankaus: others use loser count open with all 6 loser hands - lots of tracks all leading behind the same mulbarry bush|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes. LTC is a pretty powerful guideline|pg||
nt|othered1: Very lucky position for NS, allowing overbidding to slam in either rounded suit, or even NT.  |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well. looks to me that this is 1 trick to hi|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: E surely worth another bid?|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, maybe not :)|pg||
nt|algraves:  but the light overcall style hurts them here as east was afraid to bid past 3@C. picture the overcall on board 2|pg||
nt|algraves:  no free lunch|pg||
nt|frankaus: E has a good hand after pd opens - i would think is worth some form of game try |pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C ment also a good overcall|pg||
nt|algraves:  well partner did not open, they overcalled and on board 2 they overcalled with 6 HCP|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT makes from E but not W, and after the encouragement from W with 3@C it is reasonable I suppose for E to take a shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: then he would pass 2@C|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mrdct: south won't feel all that comfortable yet with a @d ruff looming|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will go down a lot now.|pg||
nt|mrdct: with south a passed hand it looks like a offer to play but north is not to know south has 6 of them|pg||
nt|pef: a lot will depend on whether sementa can figure out whether mark lair has four or five clubs|pg||
nt|fluffy: Sementa bids 3@c to see if prtner supports with 3@s to decide between 3NT and 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting that N didnt try nt |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: now*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: an anomaly :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: well on the way to 6@D now|pg||
nt|mrdct: a GF must have been established before 3@d also i think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugrapha4: Better :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: kind of unlucky|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: foul break of course|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, if diamonds are 41 the ocntract is at risk, so declarer will just bang trumps down|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not a lot of options for S|pg||
nt|bg: having started this way S should keep on drawing trump|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i think 5C is passable since S passed as dealer and N only raised to 2H|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Maybe 1S is a xfer to 1NT|pg||
nt|wygbe1: thats why you would correct, but east got greedy|pg||
nt|othered1: He thinks his hand is too good.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3C is attractive enough, but the problem is that it is not forcing and you could miss a game if pd is short of clubs and has marginal rebid values, eg with something like QJxxxx of ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: gearts|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: EW upside-down count & attitude    1st discard odd/even|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The only grand slam that makes is 7@C|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Try to bid that|pg||
nt|mrdct: -1 here will win 6 imps from USA|pg||
nt|pef: interesting choice of lines now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not many entries to the @D's but not many @C stops either|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if plays @S now can afford to hook @D|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all - see u later - I have to go :(|pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like a double board for sweden here and the first IMP for sweden in this match|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ianmcc: hi|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Ian|pg||
nt|kemperg: gm Ian|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: draws trump now and plays a @D|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|benjy: I wonder what 2NT would have meant, it is fairly mainstream to play it as 2 places in this position|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: by Peter|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: thanks Adam|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not sure what it all meant but nicely bid by the italians|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, I somehow thought west had opened - silly me :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we landed |pg||
nt|kareno: Well done. 7 depends on a finesse - sort of silly to bid that much.|pg||
nt|fluffy: also having stiff @hK wich is half a trick playing in hearts, but no trick playing in spades, is a negative factor towards bidding one more|pg||
nt|benjy: If you are playing 2Nt as scramble then 3@C is often a 5 card suit, you don't want to correct when partner is 4225 shape (quite likely on this auction)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pushy slam but you make your own luck, wd|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kareno: I would say he will make 7 now.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, hard to find.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|frankaus: Ino will hold his breath as he takes the @h finess|pg||
mc|10|nt|mrdct: he has @d blocked if they are 4-1|pg||
nt|frankaus: @C's likely to yield 6 tricks after the @C support|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT 2@S end in OR|pg||

nt|panja: I thought E could have bid 7@H on 6@C..but since we don't know the exact meaning, we cannot judge for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of bds to go here,  16x4 |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: think he claimed 1 up when @SK onside|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: interesting hand|pg||
nt|othered1: it would be 100 instead of maybe 150|pg||
nt|sybarra: makes sense to save what might have to|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mrdct: 6@s is on here|pg||
nt|peachy: This will be EW hand, I presume not even interference from NS|pg||
nt|benjy: In fact i think X of 2@S is so normal that i would consider it more of a risk to pass out 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: too much time Stephen -- now they probably won't let you bid 4@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: everything about this tournament is completely first class both for the players and the spectators - Mr Yeh puts on a great event|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh now that is truly motheaten for second seat red.|pg||
nt|algraves:  I assume the NS play transfer responses to 1@C |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@H: not recommended|pg||
nt|pef: this one shoujld be interesting.  north south have a bid double fit, east west have 12 hearts beween them|pg||
nt|sybarra: the "precision" type 2 @C |pg||

nt|mcarroll: I see Australia made 4@H on board 2|pg||

nt|fluffy: or @cQ looking for opening leader to have @cK. However if you have 2 suits to lead, and one is headed by Jack and the other from the King, experts will always pick the one from the ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: King, this makes playing the queen the percentage action|pg||
nt|pef: the 4 heart opening was a transfer to four spades for north south :)|pg||
nt|pef: both sides can make exactly 5 of a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Neills 3@S shuts them all out esp pard|pg||
nt|henryb:  The web site has no posted results|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its the standard though these days Jordan|pg||
nt|fluffy: how amny teams qualify?|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c lead will beat it|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C likely a form of Drury|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S W anyone|pg||
nt|fluffy: Dubion won't let 4@s play, he is deciding now how far will he competer|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well he could count 9 tricks for declarer on normal play so was desperately searching for something that could steer declarer off normal play.  |pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h is a constructive raise to 2@s|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mrdct: more 5-level action|pg||
nt|frankaus: dealer has provided interesting hands so fay|pg||
nt|mrdct: standby|pg||
nt|kareno: And that is not to mention the very sweet winners' pot of $100,000|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl negative, pass better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: x should be blood after a multi|pg||
nt|dburn: better to play 3NT from North|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Lot of bidding from both Courtney and Burgo on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: four -  not SIX|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Not liking the chance of this contract all too much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north's choice:   DBL vs 1@H vs [i guess] PASS   you choose|pg||
nt|kareno: All the action we could possible want :)|pg||
nt|bg: China lost 7 on strange  1nt board one where 1nt was passed out|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, @C start and good decision in @D|pg||
nt|kareno: Ok|pg||

nt|kareno: Here's a site http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=902   then click link for round|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, and he puts up the BBO commentators at 5 star hotels also|pg||
nt|mrdct: that's part of the "first class" bit for the players|pg||
nt|jcwla: No matter this time, on the way to 4@S EW.|pg||
nt|algraves:  3NT NS|pg||
nt|wygbe1: pretty close, but i think i would pass - if south decides to sit your defense will be disappointing|pg||
nt|pef: they are playing in 6 hearts doubled in the open room|pg||
nt|fluffy: 5@d is a "fit bid", obviously Duboin doesn't want to paly in diamonds when he couldn't open the bidding, he uses the bid to show lenght in both diamonds and hearts. Offering a good ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: lead to partner if he is on lead later, and suggesting a higher sacrifice if they have dobule fit|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch both vugraph rooms at the same time - one window per table|pg||
nt|fluffy: IMO Lair should double now, he is minimum for a 4 level double, has a @dK not looking good. His alternative is "pass" wich is foricng and encouraging|pg||
nt|pef: I think mark is going to double here, but he does have a problem|pg||
nt|pef: he might decide to bid 6 spades as a two way shot|pg||
nt|pef: or even pass if that is clearly forcing|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told that link is obsolete.  Current links are:   http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|fluffy: pass is also reasonable, as an invite, but 6@s is not reasonable, that would be a mistake|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I recall it can contain a 4 card major  |pg||
mb|2S!|nt|mrdct: no results for rd 6 as yet but i imagine they wont be far away|pg||
nt|mrdct: just the operators Marshall - the ones doing the real work|pg||
nt|chilloncan: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: undo please|pg||
nt|panja: 1@C..stealing South's suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's naturalish|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: plus the ruffs|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT on here|pg||
nt|mrdct: with this fortunitous @c layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP passed   it is NS doing the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East is just a tad shy of Strong 1@C opening|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S = @D i suppose|pg||
nt|mrdct: and a @c lead look pretty likely from south|pg||
nt|peachy: by elimination, leading their second suit no good (nor because it is doubleton), Jxx not appetizing and trump even less so|pg||
nt|mrdct: so 3@d non-minimum with a @d side suit i guess and now 4@d is a simple cue|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 1@S on north hand instead of strong NT, if available|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|kareno: and standings: Israel 99, Japan 97 USA 95 Australia 93|pg||
nt|pef: not clear to me that pass is forcing. yes weischel bid 5h, but he's a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: isnt it more than one down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes indeed|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: pretty conservative non-X by East|pg||
nt|mwigor: it is worth noting that 5@c makes EW - so in theory this is a good result for NS|pg||
nt|mwigor: i doubt many will find 5@c though|pg||
nt|kemperg: has chances |pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will not be easy.|pg||
nt|kemperg: first the start:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Passive defence may beat this - a @D lead gives declarer his 9th trick|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D J can also be the 9th|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h lead look normal to me.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I suppose 1@s means @h here.|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure |pg||
nt|kareno: I guess as of last night|pg||
nt|mrdct: yesterday they were updated about once every 10 minutes with live progressive scores from all matches|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S was -3 on 3 for 6 imps practically all square now|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice, a close match|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no trump finesse here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile Kaplan-Rubens evaluates the W hand at under 8: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=QJ6+Q76+QJ73+K92 |pg||
nt|kemperg: transfer Walsh i think|pg||
nt|algraves:  and that 1@C is balanced or clubs, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Allan   1@C=3+  and transfer responses   not sure if 1@S promises @D|pg||
nt|kemperg: not sure either, in my system it does|pg||
nt|algraves:  well, no major presumably and if balanced not very strong so usually unbalanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well by unpassed hand  1@C-1N is game force 5+@D  and 1@S just denies 4+@H/@S   not sure by passed hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, to cater for injudicious overcalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zhuang could RDBL to force Dai to complete the Texas Transfer|pg||
nt|benjy: Split panel then|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd Lair|pg||
nt|sybarra: those minor suits look a bit puny|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in the OR Bochhi leapt to 6@D|pg||
nt|panja: right, the world natural, does not of course  have a definition in Bridge...so things are naturalish...or not or whatever|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but Madala did not open 3@D|pg||
nt|panja: must redouble with @ST..|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: no choice is perfect, no choice is awful|pg||
nt|mrdct: this looks 2 off|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW have ti be carefull in @S|pg||
nt|kareno: Finesser's paradise :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: a nice direct auction by NS|pg||
nt|chilloncan: meanwhile, even playing 5 cxard majors i would have a tough time pulling out any bid but 1H|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence can only ever get 6 tricks here and with @SJ now set up they'll need a @d switch now to avoid -120|pg||
nt|pef: so we got to the par spot at both tables and will have a push|pg||
nt|panja: if 1@D is not forcing...then 1@S must have some meat....so 3Nt is almost a certain make..with @ST...it is even more certain|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: however   with 5@S 3@H  DBL isn't a good choice since weak advancer [partner of doubler] will bid 1@H with 3@H & 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't have Q1 result for  Hans-Brown   maybe Adam knows [his brother is member of Hans team]|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
nt|frankaus: on the other hand the rebid is quite a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: some people play that double means: pass if this is your suit, bid your suit otherwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like a puppet to 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: wd by N....far from obvious to bid over 1N, as S did not say double so suboar chance of 44 hearts, and long suit is weak. but this was the time for aggression|pg||
nt|chilloncan: oh wait, sorry i thought they were going to 3N after 2C|pg||
nt|kareno: Most unlikely, though |pg||
nt|mrdct: now RKCB and 5@h asking for the @sQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: opponents have preempt opposite passed hand, they are at the 6 level, if they make this, it will be doubled|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told the 2 @C denies any 4 cd major |pg||
nt|dburn: though I guess it doesn't matter - if West leads a heart, South has three spades, four diamonds and two hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: i'm told  Brown +2     [or Hans -2]|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Brown up 2 imps|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c may well be a puppet to 2@d to establish this sign-off in 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if N was not planning to invite 3N, which as i said was pushy, i dont really warm up to aiming at a final contract of 3C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: needs to avoid the ruff|pg||
pc|s8|nt|frankaus: nicely done to protect N's @s stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course my copy of the NS CC is from Beijing 2008|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Qx a good NT holding for declarer, and T9x often neutral as to position|pg||
nt|sybarra: NS 2@C & 2@D openers both deny 4M   either 54 in minors or 6+ in suit opened  (further info) |pg||
pc|s5|nt|kareno: Not enough compensation for their vulnerable game.  Of course 4@h can be beaten but will it?|pg||
nt|fluffy: I am not a multi expert, but I ahve seen this treatment at the table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I play X = I know what your suit is please pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that @D play never works for me|pg||
nt|wygbe1: the double of 4h allowed west to let east declare, where west has no lead advantage in hearts|pg||
nt|benjy: Just going back to the X of 4@H, does it merely ask partner to lead a @H or does it suggest that partner might support at the 5 level, if the latter then I would be concerned that ...|pg||
nt|benjy: with such a balanced hand it was risky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: single dummy -- it's hard to figure out what's best now|pg||
nt|henryb:  On board 3 the US again pushed to game where Japan stopped. |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: why not just pass 1N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd singleton King in 4 boards  |pg||
nt|frankaus: declarer will be holding his breath as he takes @h finess|pg||
nt|algraves:  ok regardless they have arrived at the best contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: most peaple do it that way|pg||
nt|kemperg: to late negative i mean|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but -6 that time|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: progress from all matches here http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResultKnockout.aspx?section=b6b714a8-e406-4ec7-bdb2-fd1c39596dce&round=2&tourid=902|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mrdct: but EW could easily be going down in 5@s or 5@h in the other room so might be good for the chinese/dutch combination|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he ran from his cold game into a part score, frighteneing|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mwigor: of course -800 would not have been a good score for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at KQ10 south llikely to switch to @DK anyway which blocks @d|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcarroll: lots of red suit discards coming|pg||
nt|mildredb: drum roll|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Now will Curtis lead a club? or a heart here?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Tight Mildred:)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Right*|pg||
nt|mrdct: lots of imps riding on this lead|pg||
nt|mildredb: it is taking longer to lead than it will take to play the whole hand|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's after 16 of 48 boards|pg||
nt|mrdct: chnace for an imp for USA|pg||
nt|kareno: 11 toppers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver in 3N North after East opened 2-suited 2@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: put me in open 1Nt camp - then some sort of 5 card stayman|pg||
pc|h6|nt|baldfriede: Gettin up with K@d gave a trick.|pg||
nt|mrdct: particularly against game in the open room - so 26 imp swings on the lead|pg||
nt|pef: four hearts vul. in third seat has a huge range.  He could easly have the best hand at the table.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont have a problem with 1N|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugrapha4: 64 is it not?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy -- i changed my mind about   with 48 to play versus  16 of 64 :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would be very confident that no table in the field will play this board at the 4-level|pg||
nt|kareno: So a quiet down two.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zhuang fears @C ruff -- and worried about 3rd round of @H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|baldfriede: E/W  have to stick to their @s.|pg||
nt|mrdct: and 3 working finesses = 14 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: whaty did Fred make of the start, @H looked normal|pg||
nt|mrdct: prob @sA and another now|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Curtis knows that Joanna has clubA|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C normal over a forcing 1N.  If partner's hep to your style nothing bad will happen all that often|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the tripleton heart is a plus for NT|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: you wanna jump in?|pg||
pg||

nt|gracelin: will be in 3NT in a while|pg||
nt|bbramley: agree, but most people upgrade these days on any excuse|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Madala probably doesn't have any science that fits|pg||
nt|woozle: HK lead?|pg||
nt|gracelin: or DQ|pg||
nt|ritong: he certainly has|pg||
nt|ritong: but opted for pedestrian way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Madala did have bid to show 6+@D and 0/1@C  but singleton King ....|pg||
nt|gracelin: HK beat it while DQ will let it make|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|woozle: Marginal decision at best whether to show the bare king as a shortage|pg||
nt|woozle: Fallenius seems to have found the fourth best lead|pg||
mc|9|nt|woozle: heart six looks like the lead most likely to beat it|pg||
pg||
qx|c5|st||md|3SAK4HJ83D987632CK,ST865HT9754D5CJ75,SQJ7HA2DAK4CT9864,S932HKQ6DQJTCAQ32|sv|n|nt|mrdct: and the indonesian doubled in 3@c making in the other room for a nice swing|pg||
nt|kareno: Accident in the OR that hand.|pg||
nt|kemperg: but a very good start from ops|pg||
nt|algraves:  and saved an imp or two|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great result Japan then|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
nt|benjy: Yes it looks like declarer played for 1 down|pg||
nt|wygbe1: nothing would work, so he just played for down one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all good 3/4 flat and 1 swing|pg||
nt|pef: another hand with swing potential.  will north south get to 4 spades and will they make it?|pg||
nt|frankaus: noon here so bar is open :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: raising the bar?|pg||
nt|othered1: The concentration of honor tricks in majors and trash in minors is what turns that last h and from 1N to 1S, at least here in the Pennsylvania hinterlands. |pg||
mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge: the good sac withered on the vine as it were|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was *dont you think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but why make it easy for the defense?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's wrong with trying @H at trick 3?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another 10 imps|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 3 imps lost vs possible huge gain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another eash hand for Burgess to bid :(|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no they threw 14 on board 1 :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: lead I ment|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wants N for weak 2 in @H w/ @SK and @CA |pg||
nt|kemperg: will W believe that:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That 2@H will surprise partner|pg||
nt|bg: looks like some one fed the computer a new deck and then dealt a goulash|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what this is about - how strong was 1NT?|pg||
nt|dburn: and if 1NT was strong, what is double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: no moths|pg||
nt|fluffy: 5@h from furuta would give weichsel some pressure|pg||
nt|pef: north's hand is considerably too good for a strong nt opening|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes if you consider it trash. Qx s a good NT holding for declarer and Y9x usually neutral|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mwigor: 4@d isnt great news - but avi does have a good hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: 6@h is an ok contract - and makes on this layout|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h EW the spot here|pg||
nt|kareno: This hand should get to a quiet 4@h but it is possible to overstretch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=limited  4+@H maybe longer 2nd suit  included 5@H & 5@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 4@S splinter|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2 unsupported Queens I'd do it|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, even if 1NT is 14-16, what is double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S transfer|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4 of either major for EW here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this looks like a mickey mouse 2@D I suppose its @S +@C weak |pg||
nt|pef: double here shows 3 spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: was just about to mention how weird is it to see NS pass a 12-count :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=0-2@S  forcing unless 5@H(332)|pg||
nt|mrdct: most likely @s of course|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think there was intent in the open room just not the desired outcome|pg||
nt|kareno: Dai with a very active double at favorable|pg||
nt|pef: a support double (invented by Eric Rodwell)|pg||
nt|henryb:  never happen|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: Stretchy Drury by east.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c looks like drury|pg||
nt|kareno: Fourth trump does it.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: fortunately N is not 4333 so the decision is easy|pg||
nt|othered1: normal auction by south, likely to iffy 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: I'm about to resatr the room.. this looks pretty easy. back in 2 minutes|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: *restart|pg||
nt|mrdct: north can get a @c ruff but there is no entry back to south for another one|pg||
nt|frankaus: 12 probable in @S|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 14-16 here|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt will not make if NS cash 5 tricks...|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure if he was going to that, bid NT or conventionally show @C support|pg||
nt|kemperg: then where did W find 3@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: precision 3 suiter short @D I amd told (yuk)|pg||
nt|kemperg: that explains|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I saw it in an earlier match. That must be the lot until 2015|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's truly horrible in my book, 2@C I could almost tolerate|pg||
nt|jcwla: Texture doesn't seem to matter until you have to play in one of those suits you bragged about.|pg||
nt|kemperg: that happened in OR, and S is in 2@S|pg||
nt|benjy: not easy for west to switch to a @D here|pg||
nt|benjy: if he ducks then declarer can prevail thanks to the favourable @H position|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT will be in trouble on a @s lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 5+@S|pg||
nt|algraves:  2@D presumably artificial game force|pg||
nt|benjy: I would be amazed if this didn't make|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb:  This play was 100%, but unless Kazuo had not led a @h from Q10xxx a heart play was also 100% and offered chances for the overtrick|pg||
nt|mrdct: plenty of trick on offer here if he gets @d right and contract still safe if he doesn't|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c ruff might beat this|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Club A lead not obv:-)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Can still beat this w/o ruff|pg||
nt|yuval10: the finalists of the last NABC are one of the most aggressive pair in the highest level|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 either major ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Courtney is well known for his prowess at Rubber Bridge|pg||
nt|mrdct: it wont be too hard for south to unblock|pg||
nt|mrdct: draw trumps and try to steal a @c trick|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the known diamond positioin gives him an extra entry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are 9 tricks but can het get them|pg||
nt|kemperg: par 6@H|pg||
nt|benjy: But we'll see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: halftime scores under http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=902    then click link for  appropriate KO round|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes a very handy bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: after 3@C -- will Klinger push to 3@H?|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR S played a second low @D for the K|pg||
nt|chilloncan: iffy didnt get to 4S he should be upset|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: now to make it wont be easy|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: How shld Joe play clubs?|pg||
nt|peachy: he might have trouble all by himself|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess East was treating 1NT as weak, so his double was penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: specs might factor that into some of the auctions we'll see|pg||
nt|kareno: The takeout double may pinpoint the diamond suit for declarer.|pg||
nt|panja: 4 of a Major would be a good contract..|pg||
nt|panja: it seems 3@C showed stiff or void...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Venky|pg||
nt|panja: so W can judge that 3N is shaky|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: and the optimal contract is reached|pg||
nt|kareno: I guess 100 percent pure is better :)|pg||
nt|benjy: Declarer followed with the @SJ was that correct?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: west found the right suit, but gave his pd a problem by not starting with the ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  4  Chung-Liu are playing 3@C|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: E has to discard 3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he can't really go wrong in trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: not a good hand for the total tricks theory it seem - NS has 9 trumps , EW 8, but i think they make more than 17 tricks in their respective contracts|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Panja, Roland and all specs, warm regards from Bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|panja: the dbl of @D confirms helps in staying away from 3Nt..|pg||
nt|mikael_w: look at the diferent auction at the other room :) Its hard to belive they are playing the same game (Bridge) :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mrdct: nowhere to dump all of the @d losers|pg||
nt|mrdct: yep|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mrdct: the defence will need to switch to a @d at some point but will get several chances|pg||
nt|algraves:  it looks like he is going to have to pick up both spades and diamonds to make it|pg||
nt|wygbe1: pd got it right though|pg||
nt|panja: hi Chhota Venky, Good afternoon from Sunny London|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kemperg: wd, W had to play the 10|pg||
nt|ianmcc: S should overtake @dK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Fred kindly located the high cards for him|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think @cJ is the only line|pg||
nt|ianmcc: specs say @s OK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its either +10 or -5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: cute  DBL followed by correct to 3@H  brings @S into the picture|pg||
nt|mrdct: tournament website: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx|pg||
nt|chilloncan: double looks so obvious...and yet...at favorable colors, E couldnt act over 1C....|pg||
nt|mrdct: odds favour the hook here considerably|pg||
nt|kareno: And so it proves.|pg||
nt|benjy: marking declarer with KQJ or KJ, surely a low card was correct, allowing the leader to have Q1098x?|pg||
nt|rv: winner of this match enters finals directly right?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|algraves:  he cannot ruff a diamond of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: S has more tricks than he knew about|pg||
nt|mrdct: still going to struggle for tricks here as playing on @c himself will yield 3 losers in that suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If it's afternoon in London now I must be somewhere else|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: Coffee hand|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Soi they play canapes?|pg||
nt|kareno: Doesn't look obvious to me with those shabby suits.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well then we agree|pg||
nt|mrdct: @s continuation by east now might see west squeezed a tad on the run of the @d|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer with plenty of ammunition, including a spade entry to dummy.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good play|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kemperg: he's not sure of E distribution, 4441 poss.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 8 of clubs giant card|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Yes Venky|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|algraves:  mis counted, doesnt need the diamonds|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@S 3@D 2@H 2@C and a rufff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this a Restricted Choice situation or is 10 meaningless looking at that dummy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now the trump situation is debatable, is the @S Ten singleton or from QT,|pg||
nt|pef: not when he is drawing them by playing high diamonds :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: NS prefer their auctions to last one bid, or two if they are feeling scientific|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bg: new style lead middle of three:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: still might have a guess in @d if W wins with the A and plays @c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W showed a lot of restraint in the auction|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kareno: An IMP back to Italy|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Will make 12 tricks now.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: So*|pg||
nt|rv: it is still 40 mins for afternoon even here:)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|mrdct: might be an imp for Lavazza here now to get them on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|kemperg: its an interesting hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 back halves the deficit|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at the other table South raised a strong no trump to three, as would anyone|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice bid by E, 7; 61/2 loser hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd good play now home singing ragtime|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chilloncan: N might have to decide whether S has Q of diamonds or T of hearts|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think west needs defence to play on @h for him to set up the QJ in dummy - which be a pretty poor defence not likely at this level|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont think that is clear|pg||
nt|kemperg: lookes restricted to me|pg||
nt|pef: I think he needs to pitch a club now to hold declarer to 4 spades|pg||
nt|panja: well Roland, it is afternoon at Venky's place...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: three bids make them uneasy|pg||
nt|sybarra: off the schneid |pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrdct: souith needs to unblock a @d honour|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if S had Jx of D then D switch would be disastrous|pg||
nt|kemperg: but a perfect @S fit:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: now joe can duck a @c on the way back and limit himslef to 2 @c losers|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yuval10: but i think he'll get it right|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep, they just took the long way at this table :)|pg||
nt|dburn: at this table there was some faffing about before South raised a strong no trump to three, as would anyone|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c7|nt|kemperg: screw is tightening|pg||
nt|frankaus: no way home now|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, Stansby "flashed"|pg||
nt|peachy: a bit of luck for Joe|pg||
nt|yuval10: W has 6 @c's and 3 @h's|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 to Hampson on 4, 2 failing part scores|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yuval10: and he played 8@s|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: quite a change for Burgess from his Forcing Pass/Moscito Relay days|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the system is called  Ultimate Canape   usually associated with Russ Ekeblad [but i'm told his brother did most of the work]|pg||
nt|algraves:  well done|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Too many points for Joe not to have gotten that right|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: my kingdom for a claim|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bbramley: bjorn can see he has almost no legitimate play, and no good deception either|pg||
nt|woozle: Madala gives nice, bold count that no partner can miss|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has entry problem himself.  Maybe force to play the guy to have Axx of D also to have CK, so will be endplayed if ducked twice|pg||
mc|9|nt|woozle: spade exits kill that plan|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes, that's the only chance|pg||

nt|ahollan1: one possible inference -- vP didn't lead @S from xxx   [was mentioned to me by   a. nonymous]|pg||
nt|algraves:  well it wasnt restricted choice as he had no option with either QT or singleton T |pg||
nt|peachy: Joe took the line he had to , he certainly knows which one to take|pg||
nt|mrdct: not being very kind to the event's sponsor|pg||
nt|benjy: I think that was a case of falsecarding back firing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ok another flat one|pg||
nt|yuval10: so either he's a singelton or a doubleton, , both cases Q@d is right|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Gary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hey Venky :)|pg||
nt|panja: 26 HCP holding with EW..but 3N looks difficult on B6|pg||
nt|rv: scores for 3 way matches in lower section of draw still not updated in site, not sure when and how frequently scoring is done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I've just been told Hampson is tied with Israel and a few imps down to China in one of the 3way matches|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcwla: JiangSu capturing 5 of every 7 imps so far.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats now 49 in 5 we are half way :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: EW make molto spads|pg||
nt|panja: seven certain tricks..some possibilities of endplaying/squeezing North so play should be interesting|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: no suit with 100 honors this hand -- the string ends at 2 in a row|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 14 to 17|pg||
nt|algraves:  just a straight guess/ probability for declarer|pg||
nt|kemperg: Jan Jansma tells spade would have been led from xxx|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could be passed out|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the web site hasn't been updated except for this match http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResultKnockout.aspx?section=b6b714a8-e406-4ec7-bdb2-fd1c39596dce&round=3&tourid=902|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 4+@S   approximately 13 cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is more complicated than just canape -- 2@C/@D/@H take care of certain 2-suiters so not all canape's possible after 1-suit opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0+|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This looks like another 3nt.|pg||
nt|mrdct: rd 6 live score now up: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=6&tourid=902|pg||
nt|kemperg: in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a pause for coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C = TRF @H|pg||
nt|wygbe1: maybe declarer had qj tight of spades and king of diamonds |pg||
nt|sybarra: dealer is having fun|pg||
nt|rv: I might have pre-empted 2@s with South hand|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|ahollan1: 2@C is only a 1-round force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scrambling stayman or transfer?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: splinter with no Aces sometimes dangerous|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: a trump lead will beat 6@h here i think|pg||
nt|kareno: Transfer by north.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could be 4@D & 5+@S/@C|pg||
nt|kareno: Do they play DONT?|pg||
nt|kareno: Meckwell, I'm told.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds and a major.|pg||
nt|mrdct: that will thrill south|pg||
nt|jcwla: This gives new meaning to having three cards in each side suit when opening light in a minor.|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like the "catch all" 1 @D |pg||
nt|peachy: NS play a form of Precision, so 1D not promising D necessarily|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a partscore battle here|pg||
nt|pef: north south here may push to a no-points four hearts, which can't be beaten even if east west find their diamond ruff given the very lucky heart lie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only 14 Pearson points (should have 15) but a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|yuval10: wonder what the X means|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: ??|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 1 spec ty[ed to me that the sponsor invited good players, not nec. kind ones:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: suit :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W is close to 2S in my view, but 1S is normal|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E i mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is their system |pg||
nt|frankaus: i agree with 21S|pg||
nt|chilloncan: N might have bid 2H|pg||
nt|frankaus: Duboin will have a v good idea what this 3NT is based on|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W will bid, only a question of what|pg||
nt|dburn: the only difference was that at this table East led a heart and beat the hand, while at the other table East led a diamond and didn't|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: in fact i don't think it promises a rebid over 2@S -- but don't quote me on that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is example -- 1@D can't be canape into @H|pg||
nt|mrdct: burns law violation|pg||
nt|kareno: West taking the low road.  Will north compete in spades?|pg||
nt|sybarra: its quite a field invited |pg||
nt|pef: and the working club finesse (if needed to pitch a spade|pg||
nt|henryb:  Clearly Grue and Cheek play this as save suggesting at this vulnerability, and not lead directing|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well if it is lehit he will, he may be worried that S is totally messing around|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and indeed, he is providing for possibility of slam|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@C is an excellent choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Mullamphy would be able to transfer to @H  -- guess not|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: XX probably a run from Peter, so he chooses to pass|pg||
nt|chilloncan: surprising but accurate choice by W|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The red suit splits mean 8 red tricks and the @SA|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed - Mr Yeh has assembled a very strong field for this event|pg||
nt|sybarra: stars from all over the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 2@H  TO PLAY      how retro|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: Gill's problem tough here   transfer responses not requiring any points, but not forbidding them either :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL and 2N seem the front runners   hard to imagine PASS, but that would work out fine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Richman in 2N North|pg||
nt|kareno: I doubt they'll get that high|pg||
nt|mrdct: need to get @d right here to make|pg||
nt|mrdct: and sometime one might play north for a @d shortage with the long @c suit so not a guarantee to make this|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No easy lead for South.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C was best:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: how does 3NT go for EW?|pg||
nt|algraves:  that is a good point , often overlooked|pg||
nt|kemperg: he is Dutch top, doesn't overlook much|pg||
nt|mcarroll: in NT of course not this contract|pg||
nt|benjy: i would X on the north cards|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H transfers to 4 sp?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Griffiths in South overcalled 1@C with 1@D  -- how did they stop in 2N???|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h the normal contract|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, indeed.  For those who don't know it, Burns' Law says you should not play a suit where the opponents have more cards than you do.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when --- and why?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably 1N=13-15|pg||
nt|benjy: in the pass out seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: (as usual)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4C was already a transfer to 4S|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes a cue|pg||
nt|othered1: Good illustration of the impeccable judgment of the great Italians  See  how it continues.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: With no convinient cue available Courtney bids a simple 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: playing 3@H in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: good news is they are only 50s|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx |pg||
nt|sybarra: you can find listings on that site|pg||
nt|peachy: if you'd like to see the teams invited, here is list  http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/entries.aspx|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: it's bridge Jim, but not as we know it|pg||
nt|benjy: for takeout :)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: they should go plus here, with 1c 1s 2d and 2h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if forced to balance, i think i'd try 2@S   but i'd complain about being forced|pg||
pc|s7|nt|panja: S hand is dead from this point onwards..E does not know that yet of course...but he need not feat with @S98x in W hand|pg||
nt|panja: fear even..|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: commentators in the other room are discussing Shakespeare  -  that won't happen here|pg||
nt|athene: actually Courtney is quite a drama fan, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: impossible to find the double dummy defense of  @H, @D ruff @C to King, @C ruff|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer has a problem:|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but may have 4 losers anyway|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, he can't reach dummy to get get the @d right.|pg||
nt|henryb:  violating "Burn's Law": It is a bad idea to play in a contract there the opponents have more trumps than you do :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and Vul vs Green even worse|pg||
nt|peachy: oops, sry Shirley|pg||
nt|pef: bocchi (north) in the open room did not make a game try after a single heart raise, so this board should|pg||
nt|pef: tighten up the match|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: agression pays a dividend|pg||
nt|othered1: since west can't get a trump on the track, south would go for less than the game in @C.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: np,  at least the specs have the site :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i was doing the vugraph at the last installment of this on the Gold Coast in Australia in 2009 and everywhere you turned there was another world champion|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I am told that on Brd 5, they are in 4@s as well in OR & looks like they are going down|pg||
nt|fluffy: but probably a 2@h raise for Bocchi-Madala has a different meaning for Weichsel-Lair|pg||
nt|frankaus: good pass - dont push them into making slam|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: N may have been contemplating a @C slam, but E doubling @S would probably stop that line of thought|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think south will find a @s lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Poorly by west with a spade lead.|pg||
nt|kemperg: lot of 9 pts opened nowadays|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
nt|frankaus: -2 now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kiwibridge: the OR are now on board 9 we are a bit behind|pg||
nt|rv: low @s lead might have been more challenging for declarer though South doesn't have an try to cash|pg||
nt|panja: now, one Club trick can be developed..so that makes it 8 top for E...|pg||
nt|rv: on this very reasonable lead, declarer is favorite to get home for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s+2@c+3@d+2@h|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugrapha4: Simple squeeze on Bobby in the endgame|pg||
nt|kareno: Henry you simply have to type faster :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: there was a burns law hand about this time yesterday where 4@h made 11 tricks in the 5-1 fit after a misunderstanding about splintering in partner's suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: Neat - at least one hand had a lot of trumps!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: badly with competent defense i think|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: @d continuation will disturb NS commincations|pg||
nt|kareno: East would never bid notrumps on that hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  5   Brink in 6@S South|pg||
nt|mrdct: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: She will eventually finesse spade thru opening bidder|pg||
nt|othered1: do you think west promised first round control?  Cue-bids of some in US are more ambiguous than that (I prefer true cues at high levels myself) |pg||
pc|h2|nt|baldfriede: South will switch to na @d now.|pg||
nt|mrdct: everything about this event is first class for both the players and the spectators|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, it looks like the importent thing on this board is that N hold up his @dA 2 times to beat this contrakt. And that shod not be any problems I think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|panja: easy now..|pg||
nt|panja: E has entry issues...we can see nine tricks now perhaps, E cannot be sure..|pg||
pc|h6|nt|baldfriede: a*|pg||
nt|mrdct: there is quite an advantage to finish in the top 7 from the swiss to get a double-chance in the KO stage|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct.  The bottom finishers get to play a single KO and the top ones play a double KO|pg||
nt|mrdct: but the top 15 plus Mr Yeh's team all qualify for the KO stage|pg||
nt|kareno: And I assume Mr. Yeh's team qualifies into the top group?|pg||
nt|mrdct: correct|pg||
nt|kareno: Only reasonable since he is sponsoring this great event!|pg||
nt|peachy: The prizes are spectacular as well, the winning team gets $100,000|pg||
nt|mrdct: and a lot of the teams get significant appearance money also|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Well done.|pg||
nt|kemperg: must have good brakes in their system|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Joe will probably duck heart Q|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panja: he can play @H to @HA8 catching North's QJ..but he doesn't know that keeps South away on the lie..|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: @S10 odd/even says   don't like @S  prefer @H over @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: can she duck?  (doubt it) |pg||
nt|sybarra: wow JoAnn!|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Now she is cold (assuming spade finesse)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Curtis' hand is dead|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mrdct: @D guess wont help him here|pg||
nt|mrdct: needed to read the @c position first!|pg||
nt|algraves:  good defense by NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CA lead from Barel --  not sure if similar inference about @S position    might think lead Ace implies trump trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is a 32 board match played in two segments of 16|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh sorry ,  she is playing 3 nt  (my bad) |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, all E did was bid 1S and W has tried for slam, so i dont see how he could do that without first round control of clubs, or at least second round control and an even m,ore ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: massive hand|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for me the real question is whether W pas over 4N had specific implications|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am guessing it was a strong call|pg||
nt|othered1: Meanwhile, east still has some playing to do|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|panja: N will now exit with a Club|pg||
nt|panja: and what will E discard?|pg||
nt|panja: from W hand?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Peter Lund|pg||
nt|panja: N should play a cunning @H7|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: now south retains the @DK as his entry to the long @c|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mrdct: @CAK, ruff @c high and draw last trump|pg||
nt|kareno: Or ace of diamonds ... etc.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: all those for drawing trumps say aye |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|baldfriede: That's it.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but will he read it?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wygbe1: south misread the spade ten i guess|pg||
pc|hT|nt|wygbe1: cant see why though, only the jack was missing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this match is from the "bottom 8"   i.e. loser is out of the event   the winner will play in a 3-way later today  with another winner from lower 8 and a loser from top 8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: nah -- that can't be right|pg||
nt|mrdct: this diagram shows how the KO stage works: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/results/results.aspx|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I'd back him|pg||
nt|athene: he's not going to take a club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: that would risk going down|pg||
nt|peachy: basically, the top 8 play double elimination, the bottom 8 teams single elimination|pg||
nt|sybarra: Raija, that is easier way to say it |pg||
nt|peachy: I looked at the diagram and couldn't decipher it, sorry to admit my ignorance... but there it is...|pg||
nt|othered1: that @S6 may be a stronger holding than it had appeared to be earlier|pg||
nt|chilloncan: surprised that E did not play S for diamond king on the auction|pg||
nt|frankaus: E bid a somewhat restrained 1@S - so that influenced the final contract|pg||
nt|othered1: in OR, EW sold to 5@CX, so 16 imps ride on east's play|pg||
nt|chilloncan: apparently played S to have been jacking arounf the whole time. that doesnt match my dossier on Japanese players|pg||
pc|h7|nt|baldfriede: Declarer avoided endplay for 4 down.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: so he can't fail to make 11|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: but Klinger just playing partner to follow suit when appropriate|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kareno: Ahh.. http://www.ccba.org.cn/Super/Tour/Bulletin/2011/902/Bul110418.PDF takes you to bulletin by the way.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s4|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||

pc|s9|pc|d8|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry i doubted you guys|pg||
pc|c4|mc|9|nt|ahollan1: might have been fun to watch play/defense in 2@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: EW have a huge fit here that they've missed completely|pg||

nt|ahollan1: can't believe @SQ really scored|pg||
nt|mcarroll: -2 at worst|pg||

nt|mcarroll: well read - for a 1 imp gain|pg||
nt|kareno: Nice 4@s e/w|pg||

nt|sybarra: start of the comeback?|pg||
nt|othered1: 5 to Japan rather than 11 to Italy|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D instead of 3 nt after transfer might work better here|pg||

nt|mrdct: this will be hotly contested|pg||
nt|kareno: n/s may compete in hearts but how high the moon?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Just another boring push :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps west opened after all|pg||

nt|fluffy: I would open south's hand by 1@s, but I know my style is not very standard :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: all cards well placed for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@c is on for EW|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|kareno: 5@c excellent e/w ... n/s can compete but it gets expensive.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: (were they Majors)|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps west's plan was to back in with an appropriate number of NTs at his next turn after the opps expectedly bid a major or two|pg||
nt|sybarra: you might be right Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: which doesn't seem such a bad plan|pg||
nt|mildredb: i'd bet he is|pg||
nt|mrdct: except if the opps don't bid before it comes back to him|pg||
nt|mrdct: and then it becomes hard to convey to partner how good he is for a passed hand|pg||
nt|mildredb: depends on what their PH bidding agreements are - but can at least spl|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: a good question asked by a kib: should inverted minors still be on by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: depends on agreements|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Depends on yr agreements|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :-)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, Mildred already said that--scroll up:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think they probably should be|pg||
nt|benjy: Sorry guys I have been asked to switch to the OR, enjoy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: whew all that for a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: this match isn't going well for one of the tournament favourites|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, 4@s appears to work well here.|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: 3@C  Bergen   [by passed hand??]|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Which actually works.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The horrible trump split kills it.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: is this the right auction?|pg||
nt|kareno: Operator, this cannot be right.|pg||
nt|mrdct: if EW are to reach game they will have to take a bid at some point|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@s by north maybe a psyche|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and here's another, bout time mind you|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Does everyone pass w/West hand here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no|pg||
nt|mrdct: surprised that neither west nor north found an opening bid here|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid I am enticed into bidding 5/5's|pg||
nt|mildredb: i would pass|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting. If the suits were majors, I'd open|pg||
nt|mildredb: if pard can't open, I haVE  no desire to open the auction for them to out bid me in Majors|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: well then I wld not have posed that question:)))))))))))))|pg||
nt|pef: not a very good result for north south here as four spades appears to be cold (at the other table, I mean)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'd open it 2@Ss, but that's not standard either.|pg||
nt|henryb:  14-16 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S or 3@S from Gill?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Oddly enough I think 6@S makes|pg||
nt|kemperg: works I think|pg||
nt|mrdct: the way thing sit - NS can only make 9 tricks in either major i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: or reality as we are seeing now|pg||
nt|chilloncan: while we wait for restoration, i recommend listening to Leo Kottke;s "It's So Cold in China, the birds don;t sing"|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here it would be 2@S 5 + a 5 minor 6-10|pg||
nt|chilloncan: predict heart lead|pg||
nt|othered1: almost all of a large field would get to 3N here, with various garden-variety auctions.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kareno: Not unexpected they would make if they bid it.  Italy in trouble in this match.|pg||
nt|kareno: East must bid now!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c seems a normal contract - but north will probably compete to 5@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: or 5@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6-5s are designed for defending|pg||
nt|mrdct: and nor are 7-4s|pg||
nt|kareno: There's a famous bridge adage - "6-5 come alive"|pg||
nt|kareno: Did you mean aren't designed for defending?|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sorts of hands you have in the back of your mind the risk of pushing the opps to a making slam|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed *aren't|pg||
nt|algraves:  3@S by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  @H & @S      2@D asks longer/better|pg||
nt|yuval10: not much about this one as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: And with the information provided in the auction, e/w can make six clubs by picking up diamonds - queen first.|pg||
nt|pef: that balance may let n/s back into four spades|pg||
nt|chilloncan: "almost"?|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d is good raise in @h, South's 3@c is help suit game try, East could have bid 3@s here for choice of games?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C obvious showing a heart fit, but i don't know whether he is just improvising|pg||
nt|ahollan1: showing a Limit Raise     i never remember if that is original or modified Bergen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some situations 1N is 14-16, but i think this 1N is supposed to be 15-17|pg||
nt|baldfriede: All they give off is a trump.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True indeed|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think they'll get to 4@s ok now|pg||
nt|rv: West's 3@c sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C limit is reverse bergen|pg||
nt|kareno: They need to get some IMPs on the board.  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: But declarer has nasty guesses in all suits|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south should bid 4nt instead of 5c, since n will bid clubs with equal holdings -  n came to the rescue though|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kemperg: first guess np|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This lead is helpful though.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: except @HS|pg||
nt|kemperg: even 6NT is "good":(|pg||
nt|sybarra: need the same drop of stiff K doesnt she?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will also require dropping the @DK|pg||
nt|pef: yes, a good hand for Polish style 2 bids, although I think I agree with opening 1 spade on the hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcarroll: who was it said  "Any slam that makes is a good slam"?|pg||
nt|kemperg: -1|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: of course Zhejiang Huamen are amongst the favourites also|pg||
nt|mrdct: joe feeling that he's pretty much fully described his hand with 3@h so no need to say any more|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes.  I guess 1@c starts with 15.  So the auction by west was natural.|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer could ruff here and overtake the spade jack to pull trumps.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: seems the indicated line|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c ruff looming in declarer's mind|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the delay here is puzzling,but declarer is probably worried about a dummy lock after the spade ace wins|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kemperg: cant do wrong in @C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and second, and therefore problems vanish :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Now this is a bit disappointing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink also got @S right in the slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which would probably get you to 4@S|pg||
nt|pef: four spades is not a particulary good contract, anyway.  even with diamonds 3-3 it has lots of difficulties if e/w tap declarer with hearts|pg||
nt|chilloncan: maybe only almost if there is livestock in the large field|pg||
nt|othered1: In a large enough field, you'll always find some outliers.|pg||
nt|frankaus: in the supervised session almost all would get to 3NT :(|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: all roads lead to 4@h though|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: he gets a lucky lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: if courtney thinks west has @CA and @DKQ he will get spades wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: It's pretty well impossible for the defense to get any traction on this hand.|pg||
nt|frankaus: not many bunnies in the "field"|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi all sorry i am late for work|pg||
nt|frankaus: running scores all mathes at - http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=1&tourid=902|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome|pg||
nt|mrdct: huub bertens in the closed room for Zhejiang was on the winning netherlands team at the last instalment of this event on the Gold Coast in 2009|pg||
nt|chilloncan: thx, plane was hijacked, close shave|pg||
nt|kemperg: N is very shy here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: previous hand suggests that NS don't have "scrambling" NT calls in their arsenal|pg||
nt|othered1: now it's a matter of overtricks|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kemperg: coffee break?|pg||
nt|kemperg: what does he need ti make? |pg||
nt|frankaus: @H to safe hand now|pg||
nt|othered1: with the winning @H hook, perhaps 5 is there|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i do understand how in context of 4-card majors it might make sense to forgoe Drury |pg||
nt|rv: old adage, lead partner's suit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: If south gives north a club ruff, then the diamond goes away.  Declarer will worry but north will be out of trumps.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: silence by S has a chance to play off|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S KQ stiff in E?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: This is a count situation and I believe the jack of hearts showed three.|pg||
nt|mrdct: south trying to figure out what hand partner can have to beat this|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|henryb:  This hand just became scary. but less scary now|pg||
nt|rv: now Duboin will play @c and should get home inspite of 4-1@h break|pg||
nt|rv: he can't misguess @cs with all of A,Q and T in South hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: and "dashing" home |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|mrdct: unremarkable hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: there are actual two teams from Zhejiang in the field so best to refer to this team as Huamen i guess|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Huamen Beings|pg||
nt|pef: it was better to duck the diamond, but hard for duboin to know|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to C why Duboin went for this line|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kiwibridge: the open room have lost board 6 hopefully it will turn up|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: (west is passed hand, so couldn't have the @SA too in that case)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: the great story of Philip Grosvenor can be read here http://www.bridgebum.com/grosvenor.php/|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you might play 6@H here if you really wanted to|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm - ok, scratch that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5@S 8-11 HCP|pg||
nt|frankaus: is a wagging tail unauthorised nformation :)|pg||

nt|kemperg: and a chance for 5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: mine was too cautious|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Many would open west hand with strong NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some not so good news. I have just been told that the organizers in China have decided that they won't show matches from Knockout 4. So the 2nd half of this match will be the last ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: today. Sorry about that but this is obviously beyond BBO's control|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a sad chilling tale|pg||
nt|rv: tough to work out percentages in last deal, matters what South will open with 4-4 in minors etc, on the balance I think Duboin took a very reasonable though unfortunate line|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: YUK|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: NS playing these ultra-undisciplined weak-two bids|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS employ a lot of transfers - good modern methods|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Good 3nt for E/W here.|pg||
nt|kemperg: Versace is playing @H AK, in trouble now|pg||
nt|kareno: Operator, I think north overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|kareno: n/s have 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Three-way matches not easy to show on vugraph|pg||
nt|panja: B8 3Nt will come down to @C guess..and @CA and small will do fine..|pg||

nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like an inviational raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: these are double edged in that if opps come in they might easily get too high|pg||
nt|athene: but of course they are also risky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Burgess sooo strong, maybe they'll be able to unravel|pg||
nt|athene: they pre-empt your side out of your own best contract too much, in my opinion|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe they get there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought i was having a flashback   just couldn't remember which decade|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1@D=4+@H's|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1@H=all hands with 3card hearts but not forcing, or some hands with 4@H's|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT is interesting|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am all for showing the @H.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me too|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like a GF variety|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: shorter auction same spot|pg||
nt|peachy: 3H might be generic game invite|pg||
nt|fluffy: if north had decided to double|pg||
nt|fluffy: wich for some shows a balanced hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: last night one of these bids at unfavourable ended in -1100 to save 430|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be a misunderstadning here for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=game force  in this case  8-11 or 15+ HCP and 3 places to play|pg||
nt|mrdct: west doesn't|pg||
nt|pef: curious.  normally double by north would show a hand that was a balanced strong nt of some variety.  I wonder why he didn't do that|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: burgess takes the low road|pg||
nt|chilloncan: one does open 1D when dictated by a draconian system, but the undfettered heart yearns to open the eponymous 1H|pg||
nt|mrdct: or not|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps vugraph mistake? the bidding might be a kokish 2@c-pass-2@d-pass-2@h-pass-2@s|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andy_h: Gosney would like to pass the 1@H but 18-19NT with 3 hearts would also bid 1@H so he's constrained to bid 1NT|pg||
nt|baldfriede: If you have both majors, show them, even if you have a fit in one.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2nt showed an invitational raise with 4 spades.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C= (54)/55  @C & @D  or  4@D & 6@C|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@h might help south diagnose the wasted values in @h and stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|pef: I wonder if it was actually south that bid 2d and this is a kokish auction|pg||
nt|chilloncan: interesting EW auction here|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps just a little bit cautious|pg||
nt|andy_h: I suspect that 2@C or 2@D by Gosney would be artificial (aka xyz)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C clarified short @C or @D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: he may suspect that|pg||
nt|pef: but north doesn't really have a kokish hand, only a 2nt rebid, so I am confused|pg||
nt|fluffy: :) though the same, but the 3@d is onconsistent with kokish, so the bidding must be right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the pass over 2@D was alerted|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: but he does have weak trumps |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@H shows 4  [support dbl situation??]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy 3@H bid seems to support that guess|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: grab a coffee everyone :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=1@D 3@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  One issue for everyone to think about is whether 2@s promises a six card suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: not in 2/1 i believe|pg||
nt|chilloncan: maybe 2C-2D-2N?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: but 2NT looks OK with everything stopped nicely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N = to play if 8-11 HCP|pg||
nt|mrdct: opportunity for a non-vul game swing for japan|pg||
nt|mrdct: this looks doomed for 2@d, 1@h and 1@c to lose|pg||
nt|pef: probably double by lair would have been a second negative so the pass was game forcing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if not it should|pg||
nt|henryb:  One school says yes. another says it is a catch-all for minumum unbalanced hands, and that a bid of 3 of a minor shows extra values (or extra distribution)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: and the @d7 is now going to come into play|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice system, W was not interested|pg||
nt|kemperg: East|pg||
nt|panja: operator, what does 2@H show, could you check please?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: still 6@H should have some play? especially with the lead coming up to those luscious minor suits|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@h apparently like Kokish, showing great extras.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT also promises 4@s curtis cheek tells me|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: In OR they wer ein 5@d, dropping stiff K|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to get the @D on the table|pg||
nt|pef: well they got to a safe spot|pg||
nt|rv: with East hand B-D used to play 3@s to show 4@h non-slammish hand and choice of game between 3n and 4@h|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: the auction didn't reveal whether 5@S & 4@H   or   5@H & 4@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: kokish style here it seems|pg||
nt|wygbe1: e took a flyer here = got lucky to find no club waste, got unlucky for 3 finesses to lose|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mrdct: well read|pg||
nt|kemperg: well bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is on board 6 -- but i bet they don't repeat our auction|pg||
nt|fluffy: sementa might decide to duck this|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: i think this will end in tears for EW with 3NT going down|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is bidding  7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: half our audience are commentators obviously enthralled by the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: anything happening Catherine?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ish is thinking... of dinner perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: his thoughts won't help him on this board|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: not a good advertisement|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, for all that fabulous east hand I think they are overboard already|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4D ok i thinl|pg||
nt|mrdct: although on a @d lead from south he might scramble a 9th trick in @s before NS wake up to their cashing @h tricks|pg||
nt|chilloncan: oh wait, W would be declarer sprry|pg||
nt|kareno: West looking for a potted palm to hide behind|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm afraid i can't give much insight here as to what either east or west has shown|pg||
nt|mrdct: i've got one right here for him|pg||
nt|kareno: I think east has shown a massive club hand with a spade side suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: What do 3@H mean from E now? Sr for interrupting|pg||
nt|chilloncan: was 1H a GF?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  3N a bit unexpected    1@H denies game force|pg||
nt|fluffy: to keep comunications open|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: our esteemed bulletin editor watching live confirms Sementa bid 2@D|pg||
nt|fluffy: wich results on 13 tricks|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry 12|pg||
nt|henryb:  all within the context of 2/1 game forcing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in some systems it's a good weak two|pg||
nt|rv: the idea is to not help defense in giving information about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Pat Anderson, USA|pg||
nt|fifee: ty Shirley :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: only 2 Aces to lose in this - or indeed almost any other - contract|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 10|pg||
nt|pef: strange duck lookng at that dummy,  I'm sure he claimed 12 tricks, not 10|pg||
nt|pef: I think this was really an imp to north/south, not east/west|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|baldfriede: Thiss should make 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even after P-2N  probably still won't get to slam, but may sniff at it|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: NS play Reverse Smith vs NT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: north won't like weak @S  and 5422    south won't like minor suit queens|pg||
nt|mrdct: i suspect it's a relay asking west to tell him more|pg||
nt|rv: I might have just bid 3n on 1n with 4333 though|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: well, of course you would rather have the @SQ, but the minor-suit queens aren't useless|pg||
nt|athene: they stop the defence setting up any trick in a minor on the lead|pg||
nt|athene: so you can afford to lose the lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: try singleton to protect @SQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right before the 4@H bid was posted, i was about to ask if East was going to PASS or invite with 3@H|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|kemperg: No Ron went for the possible 41, better|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Belive they had relay|pg||
nt|kareno: As I've seen it used here this week, 1@h creates a force to game.|pg||
nt|mrdct: west may have had a different idea|pg||
nt|yuval10: i love the catch-all thing, that's how i play it to be honest|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrdct: although i assume it's curtis' lovely wife phyllis signed in under his name :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: did Dyke do well not to mention @S   or was he lucky??|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am wondering whether E really has a GF|pg||
nt|mrdct: it looks like a GF to me|pg||
nt|chilloncan: his suit is a minor, he has only 2 aces and a big NT flawm etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or should say  "tends to deny"|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|panja: @C guess..it is going to be...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: may make only 10 tricks  @D @D|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|nt|mrdct: just a shame west didn't come to party with anything to help him|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, using losing trick count, he has two losers.  And 5 1/2 QT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some not so good news. We will not be showing the three-way matches in the KO 4, so this will be the last set today. No need to message me, organiser's call. Final to be broadcast ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow as scheduled|pg||
nt|rv: even misguess he will survive |pg||
nt|panja: he might play @SK and finesse|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Roland, a night off guys :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a shame none the less :(|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- i'm just saying it will slow down any mild attempt to get to slam|pg||
nt|chilloncan: of course, if he has no forcing sequence available to show a strong but not GF unbalanced hand, there may be no practical alternative|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I wonder why N did not try to cash @c K first ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi Pat :)|pg||
nt|fifee: hi Mikael :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mrdct: more imps likely for Huamen with partscore looking to make in both rooms|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute -- i didn't think about immediate duck|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: no |pg||
nt|henryb:  As I say, there is a difference of opinion. |pg||
pc|h9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is EW doing to NS what they did on board 4 - running long minor|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andy_h: North could have risen with the @CA to take the contract 2 off given the (un)lucky layout of the diamonds|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: either way -- a bit surprised that he sold out to 3@H when partner "freely" bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that was weakest way for Gill to bid  [other than PASS]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this is a great result for Morris Chang|pg||
pc|hT|nt|algraves:  a good play by east as it shut out the hearts if they were 5-3|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|andy_h: But nevertheless, one is always happy to take any contract off|pg||
pc|h3|nt|algraves:  giving some extra options in the end game|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kemperg: perhaps thats why he didn't dare to bid 2NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|algraves:  so he has to guess the end position here|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rv: 3 way matches played with turner movement (followed in BAM usually) and somehow organizers are loath to allow kibitzers or broadcast those matches|pg||
nt|panja: I wonder whether S exposed his side by playing a @D...|pg||
nt|fifee: Italians are having a very strong run|pg||

mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that is NOT the 1st, 2nd or 3rd  8 card suit to 100 honors we've seen this week|pg||
nt|woozle: is 450 right for the last hand?|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s9|mc|12|nt|ritong: depressing dummy for fredin  he is counting out how much 6@s costs|pg||
nt|gracelin: should Fredin jump to 6D or Fellenius find a raise? or maybe just damaged by the preemptive|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Ish gaine an imp bless him|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s makes here for N/S.|pg||
nt|kemperg: for them:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it this was back in college   we'd say   down 1 is good bridge|pg||
nt|panja: it always is, at least you tried a game...|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S here for NS|pg||
nt|panja: only 18 HCP..9-card fit..and @D stiff opposite no wasted values..30 HCP pack|pg||
nt|panja: no...on wrong @C guess..@HA would have got stranded too|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|athene: so i guess it would be going down in practice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 3+  but still transfer responses|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not many boards are left, time's running out for the Brown team. A 14imp was swung on board 19 where the failing grand (due to 4-1 break) was not bid in the other room|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: also a good lead by Gosney on 17 defeated a game for 12 more|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: good start for a final set for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d for NS here|pg||
nt|kemperg: fireworks here?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: We have a slam here, but it has to be played carefully to make.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s the limit for EW here|pg||
nt|kareno: China picked up 11 on the 4@s hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: precision 1@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats 41 unanswered imps Lavazza on a roll|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: precision style 2@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: obviously if E had a major it would be a GF. with a minor it is certainly close with 3 losers |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-22|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2NT now|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D doesn't inconvenience the opening side|pg||
nt|bg: maybe 6|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah could be|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be difficult for EW to get into the auction now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D  Forcing 1 round?|pg||
nt|rv: unless something miraculous happens in remaining 9 deals, Lavazza should be in finals tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south needs a raise to do that|pg||
nt|athene: but there we are :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This 2nt bid should be a help.|pg||
nt|kemperg: was my bid too, not yours?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: doesn't have a weak 2@H bid available|pg||
nt|peachy: 1@D again all-purpose|pg||
nt|henryb:  Over 2N I would play 3@d = forcing with @s, 3@h = strong raise to 4@c|pg||
mb|6D|nt|mrdct: with the @HA with the singleton @d, the defence can only lead trumps once|pg||
nt|baldfriede: My bid too, but it helps nevertheless.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C fit, invite+ ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: it certianly looks tempting now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: certainly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Raptor NT overcalls -- so DBL is needed to cover Strong NT |pg||
nt|panja: should be|pg||
nt|yuval10: Gitelman and Hampson went too high and that gave Japan 12 imps|pg||
nt|chilloncan: art GF i am guessing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@h is about the limit for NS here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h looks like a splinter agreeing @d|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@C now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @s is the better slam.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1S = no major?|pg||
nt|kareno: Double here would be takeout with primary diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: But it is always risky to balance into the opponents' misfit auction.|pg||
nt|algraves:  actually not for anybody|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h will be hard work here with this trump break|pg||
nt|yuval10: @@ board 6|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, On last board I think N has him self to blame. But I know him verry well and I am 100% sure he IS blaming him self right now. Maybe a toilet visit is a good ide now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@c - anyone know what this is?  Better than 1nt?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hods allow quasi-2N hands to peter out in playable spots|pg||
nt|mrdct: although the @d position is quite favourable|pg||
nt|kareno: Good screech to a stop!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay it shows 18-19 balanced, thanks.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm alway a bit nervous about splintering with a stiff king|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like OR may be in time trouble - only 6 boards played|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Another 3nt.|pg||
nt|kemperg: evereybodys choice 1@S?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes for me|pg||
nt|jcwla: And might not make it if did.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he has a choice in trumps, whether to lead the @DJ to pin the ten|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like 9 tricks i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry start of my message was deleted by gremlins:  flexible methods allow....|pg||
nt|mrdct: draw trumps finishing in dummy and take @d hook|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to get to this spot by many methods|pg||
nt|kareno: Note that with JTx of trumps, it is correct to lead small in case partner has queen or king.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds friendly!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: friendly but not passionate. if 8 and 7 interposed, then passionate|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if it is clear that it is a misfit, not sure that is so here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a steal for EW|pg||
nt|pef: a double partscore swing on this hand to the lavazza team.  n/s played and made 3c in the open room and 2h will most likely make 3 here unless north/south find their diamond ruff|pg||
nt|fluffy: Sementa had to pick between 2@h and 2@d rebid, he picked the best one in no time|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to get to 6 with preempt...oh well they did |pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: e.g. @SQ K A, diamond to queen|pg||
nt|mrdct: and even more nervous splintering in a suit shown by partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@S,   1N would show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and even if so, collect 50s with possible game your way if NS are really having u on|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mrdct: even if hiroki gets trumps right, might still lose 2@s, 1@c and 1@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence have 6 top tricks here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear|pg||
nt|kemperg: for me 5@H's + 4+ minor, |pg||
nt|kemperg: It is for my partner:(|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS did well not to go to 5@h, which goes down 4 on a singel @d lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks like a strong club going wrong|pg||
nt|sybarra: and  does he say "gin" when dummy comes down?  |pg||
pc|s3|nt|andy_h: 4@S looks to be the limit here, unless declarer takes a view on the clubs|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a very aggressive double of 3@D by Gosney|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: too true! Still, if he passed, West would X himself|pg||
nt|andy_h: Certainly a nice partner to provide him with four keycards!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In this vulnerability yes.|pg||
nt|jcwla: NT is a home not a refuge.|pg||
nt|mrdct: but the @H8 could turn out to be useful card to play trumps for one loser - let's see|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard to imagine Venky|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Ruff out a small @h in @s slam to make.|pg||
nt|kemperg: I dont play semiforcing 2 openings, but still I doubt on 1@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: -2 imps|pg||
nt|pef: normal to rebid a good 6 card major over a four card minor with a minimum hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Instead of KO4 we are contemplating a match between the we-are-so-clever-when-seeing-all-the-hands commentators|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then it's specs' turn to laugh|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm game Roland|pg||
nt|sybarra: might worry about qxx first |pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: can he find 8 tricks here?   my bet more likely down 2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice bidding as 4@H is destined to go down despite the 4-4 fit, at least 2@H, 1@S and a @C ruff|pg||
nt|kareno: Suit preference is my guess on the @c q|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: west may drop the @D8|pg||
nt|mrdct: as does declarer|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT had a play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that might balance NS into game|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: on 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: choosing between 3 nt and 4 hts no doubt|pg||
nt|sybarra: or has sementa described his shape? and is 5 @C an option?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont think W has given up on slam jut yet|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: can probably surmise exact suit distribution though|pg||
nt|athene: trying to look like a man with @D108 doubleton|pg||
nt|kemperg: contract or 1 up the same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope -- escaped THAT bullet|pg||
nt|yuval10: it turned out to be that West had only waisted values ( speaking of board 6 )|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bg: signals crossed here so much for fancy bids|pg||
nt|pef: I'm told by barry rigal, that Lair's scorecard does say 490 on board 8, so the score is really 16 to 7 here, not 17 to 6|pg||
mc|12|nt|ahollan1: the question being   is West  5332 or 5422|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he went wrong right away|pg||
nt|mrdct: and i assume 3@d showed a red 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HK for down 2   maybe duck = down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't really apply, but just made me think of     Lee Trevino: the more i practice, the luckier i get|pg||
nt|kemperg: he's on line now, but IN OR I hope|pg||
nt|algraves:  declarer now has nine tricks by building diamond|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think that was Gary Player Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd accept it from any of that group o' greats|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bbramley: and it might not be serious - what should he do with the same shape and say Q109xxxx and out?|pg||
nt|ritong: when preempted, keep low profile  esp at unfav, when scrifice can be cheaper than game bonus|pg||
pc|hT|nt|woozle: Somebody says that Fredin should have started from 4NT...I think that's an odd suggestion - sounds like another suit to play in|pg||
nt|woozle: As against that, if they sacrifice, it doesn't matter any more whether you were making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room did play 3N on 7   that's 3 12-imp pickups for Lavazza this set|pg||
nt|ritong: i tend to prfer +620 to +300|pg||
nt|woozle: Madala finds the good (but fairly obvious) trump lead, inspired by his spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: Unless you play Lebensohl at this level as suggestted by Martin Johnson|pg||
nt|woozle: 300 is a fairly pessimistic assessment of defensive prospects against a save|pg||
nt|bbramley: much prefer 4NT to show two places to play, especially at this level|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: conclusion for  9     sometimes preempts work|pg||
nt|woozle: Lebensohl gives up on any ability to consult on strain|pg||
nt|ritong: converting 5@c to 5@d would really sound like @ds and @hs|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure the other table will also see a 4S opening on  9, let see how the Italians cope with it.|pg||
nt|woozle: I'll hazard a guess - exactly the same|pg||

nt|mrdct: the winner of this match goes stright into the final and the loser goes into a 3-way match to decide the other finalist|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: but the opening bid was 2@H North|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: that's what i mean - once you know north will be playing it, i think that tips it against bidding it|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that's what I meant, Dave.|pg||
nt|frankaus: last now -  its a educational  to see that the best of teams can have a big loss - tu all for your company|pg||
nt|chilloncan: np shirley, sometimes the earth moves:)|pg||

nt|chilloncan: if you are going to produce an ungainly defence, let it be to a partscore....a sign you are in heat one  and a half:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: most matches scored through 6 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15, 4+@S   could be 4@S and any 5+suit   never 5@S & 5@H|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S should be cold..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: kibs say makes 3@H if plays A and another|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT should be interesting here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: just enough time to maake my breakfast|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Custer's Last Hand, thanks to all|pg||
nt|algraves:  good 3@C bid by south against Canape systems|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h is on here for EW|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: heavy 1nt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no excitement here either|pg||
nt|mrdct: @h partial for NS here - don't think game will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0+  maybe canape into @C/@S   1@S=3+@S  less than game force|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to our operator and to the specs for keeping us on our toes :)  Also to Dave Thompson who is soaking up the rays in Phuket, Thailand :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: good choice to open 1NT rather than 1@h to stop the opps from having an easy 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|mrdct: transfer to @d i presume|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS could get in trouble if they decide to compete|pg||
nt|henryb:  Looks like excessive duplication of values that were not discovered soon enouhg, and bad luck that both aces were off side|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: people often push the upper limit for 1nt overcall over 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: over 1@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s likely to fail here|pg||
nt|kareno: Almost certainly with any reasonable defense.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@D just makeble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep   lose 1@C 1@D and either  1@H or 1@S, but not both|pg||
nt|mrdct: serious Burns' Law violation here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a 6@H we'd bid easily without seeing all the cards, right Roland?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|baldfriede: And I am Friederike Greifswald-Tolleson.|pg||
nt|mrdct: west knows what to lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another hand with total trump = 20    who shuffled?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-8 HCP, @H or @S  --  no strong options|pg||
nt|mrdct: might collect a few hundreds in 3@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: or 500 in 3@sx|pg||
nt|mrdct: will south pass?|pg||
nt|frankaus: tough choice for V.P.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: the reason is they don't want to double and have to rebid 2nt facing a possible zero|pg||
nt|frankaus: can they stay pot of 4@S?|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@d maybe a general GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but you can easily miss games doing this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically 1N was 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: courtney might try 3nt now|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: why?   Burgess has only confirmed 13 cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: helpful lead still a lot of work for Ish hope his brain still aware after all that thinking earlier|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he is alert and focussed we are told :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we welcome Ian McCance |pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great to have you Ian|pg||
nt|andy_h: Nice 5@H bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: nef X by W perhas describable as...optional|pg||
nt|frankaus: out of 4@S|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Thanks to all who made this event possible: The organizers, our excellent operator, my co-commentators Martin Carrooll and Al Hollander and of course the indefatigable Roland Wald.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Martin Carroll*|pg||
nt|mrdct: good lead for declarer|pg||
nt|algraves:  jocleyed them into the third best game with a bad trump break|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec says 4@H in EW|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: progress on all matches here http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResultKnockout.aspx?section=b6b714a8-e406-4ec7-bdb2-fd1c39596dce&round=2&tourid=902|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from sleepy (sidewalks were rolled up hours ago) central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|fifee: serious 3nt|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: but that would be a bit wild since south can't have much to pass 2@H and will usually have a lot less than he has|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Bobby gave X a couple seconds of thought|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @d now and if he ducks the roof could fall in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes @C's are ominous|pg||
nt|mrdct: might need to guess @d right here to make so a chance for lavazza|pg||

nt|baldfriede: This will godown 1 no matter what.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: spec suggests 6N better no @D ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: or form of NMF|pg||
nt|panja: the only better spot than 1@S PPP for NS is 5@D dbl -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: finally  a long @C suit is running|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS turning a plus score into a minus score|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Thanks to all who made this event possible: The organizers, our excellent operator, my co-commentators Frank Budal, Martin Carroll and Germ Kemper and of course the indefatigable ...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Roland Wald.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h fast arrival with no extra values|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: do you think South is in lebensohl situation where 3@D showed some values?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if south happens to have nothing, 3nt is getting doubled and so is 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think 2N is scramble rather than lebensohl|pg||
nt|kemperg: they did:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: but bad news coming soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: Although declarer still has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|andy_h: If trumps are 3-1, provided that the defenders duck a round of clubs, there is no entry to dummy to enjoy the clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if Ginossar bids only 2@C -- wouldn't be surprised to see others in 4@H|pg||
nt|algraves:  needs 6 trump tricks to go with 4outside tricks|pg||
nt|algraves:  or finessse spade and take 5 trump tricks|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: you might argue that with some values, south must do something over 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: unless he has a penalty pass of course, but he hasn't got that|pg||
nt|athene: so when he passes and then pulls the double, he is showing a pretty weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: of course there will be times when you would like leb to be on in these situations|pg||
nt|athene: but i think in general it's better to play 2nt as scramble|pg||
nt|mrdct: @SJ here to show the @HK|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: However, given that West holds the singleton queen of trumps, a good guess in clubs would see the contract for one off. If Gosney ducks the first round of trumps, declarer will ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: then be able to ruff his two little spades. If Gosney takes it with the Ace and returns a trump, declarer then guess the clubs|pg||
nt|mrdct: @sJ might score a trick here|pg||
nt|kareno: Good idea to continue now :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: which one?|pg||
nt|kareno: Small for sure - suit preference.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at K108 in hand and Q9 in dummy - west may not think east likely to be able to beat the @S9|pg||
nt|kareno: As long as east has a trump that works.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might more important. 3@D=bergen raise? E a bit mad? Then S might got the signals needed.|pg||
nt|mrdct: oh - low @d at trick 2!|pg||
nt|kareno: eek!|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yuck|pg||
nt|mrdct: @DJ and extravagent card to play at trick one perhaps|pg||
nt|kareno: West had better duck the spade now.|pg||
nt|mrdct: but this looks a very high risk defence by west which surely has an easy beat just pumping out @d from the top|pg||
nt|ianmcc: do they play udc? or by ear?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: one rarely gets the defense right after an early debacle such as we have jut witnesed|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I agree.  But still the low diamond is risky in case of this holding.|pg||
nt|kareno: I hear e/w playing 5@h doubled in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|braunstar: Hey all|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told its an ask,  but I think it means the same|pg||
nt|fifee: definitely not to play :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, This Italian team is MUCH to strong to let them get this much adbantage from start. Sweden will have a HUGE problem taking this back. But we all know its posible in bridge. ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But maybe a break and some cold water after this segment is a good ide|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: disaster avoided|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hey Daniel|pg||
nt|braunstar: It seems Hans have built a nice lead into this last set|pg||
nt|braunstar: Does anyone know the results of the other match?|pg||
nt|mrdct: once north shows up with the @sA, the odds might favour south holding the other missing ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sometimes it DOESN'T??|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with 10 LTC and bad spades, W can pass... no game unless E can act  at almost any subgame level, in which case W wll have all values in reserve and can do the needful|pg||
nt|kareno: Still a vulnerable overcall ..|pg||
nt|mrdct: but when north turns up with the @sA, what has south got for his vul 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: gmta Dave|pg||
nt|frankaus: oh well -1 is good bridge (some say)|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps planning to take ruffs with the long @d|pg||
nt|algraves:  which I think he can just do|pg||
nt|pef: 2 hearts here was probably a two-way bid.  either balanced 11-12 or strong with hearts.  Fairly common usage.  We saw the other common usage of 2h being weakish with 5 spades and ...|pg||
nt|pef: 4+ hearts earlier|pg||
nt|mrdct: great @d pips for the defence so when north gets in a trump through will hurt declarer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: it was out of reach obviously with S in control|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice auction to get slam interest into it while stopping at game.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrdct: last board of the match here|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thanks all, see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks Gary and all.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kiwibridge: cheers again all see you in the next round|pg||
nt|ianmcc: txall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but a good win to JiangSu here well deserved in the end|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5th and final round of the day scheduled to begin at 10 past the hour --- approx 35 minutes|pg||
nt|kemperg: not anymore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if @H will split poorly in the other room|pg||
nt|algraves:  no 3-3 in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with King onside|pg||
nt|algraves:  so this line needed 4-2 hearts or 7=2 clubs|pg||
nt|algraves:  and was clearly best|pg||
nt|algraves:  bad luck|pg||
nt|frankaus: running scores all matches at  - http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=9&tourid=902|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The Great Shuffler strikes again|pg||
nt|algraves:  now he must lose two more hearts if North forces him in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Pachtmann contemplating non-@C shift?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bocchi down in 3N on 9 11 to Japan|pg||
pc|c4|nt|frankaus: the presire card found|pg||
nt|frankaus: presure|pg||
nt|algraves:  hmm|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: not that either hand is spectacular |pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: Ish taking his 6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, one of the seldom acknowledged -- at ;east by the busy bidders -- disadvantages of the busy-bid style, is that declarer can then all too often place all cards early, ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ESPECIALLY if the overcall is raised. and if it hurts your side to have your overcall raised, maybe it isnt the best idea |pg||
nt|kareno: Well done for the push|pg||
nt|mrdct: so making this may not be enough to win the board if 5@hx goes for 800|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: must be a lot of Fred fans in the other room 1500 there and 2 here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does Mullamphy EVER claim?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was 105-59 to Courtney|pg||
nt|mrdct: good @d play by south to put declarer to the guess before he has discovery of the @SA and @HQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: worrying that @C will allow Verhees to elope his small trumpm|pg||
nt|mrdct: new leader if this goes 3 down|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: it's easy to see they might reach 3n on this hand in the other room though|pg||
nt|athene: east must duck the second diamond to kill the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  West's 3rd seat opener is not automatic by any means|pg||
nt|rv: oflate Roland is very quite on commenting on dodgy slams|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrdct: as it happens - 6@h is cold here with @d 3-3 to pitch the losing @s before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i'd be surprised if many bid it|pg||
nt|mrdct: but those who do will make it|pg||
nt|mrdct: i believe lavazza's carry over is 6.5 imps (the half imp to avoid ties) so always add 0.5 to Lavazza's score if this match goes down to the wire|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kemperg: Thanks all see some of you in 20 mins|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tommorrow the real excitement starts with the KO rounds|pg||
nt|pef: hard to make 3nt at this point, I think that's his best shot other than completely double dummy|pg||
nt|pef: he'll have to read the card's well if duboin exits with a heart here.  he might take the diamond finesse and go down|pg||
nt|pef: but I think mark will get it right|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N&S both have winners|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: even if west does open, north might double then bid notrumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: W overtook the @c to break a possible squeeze|pg||
pc|d6|nt|frankaus: bye all|pg||
nt|chilloncan: incidentally, my comments are not critiques from the other side, i am a very bisy bidder and am acknowledging the downside of that policy|pg||
nt|ritong: BACK IN 15 MINUTES OR SO|pg||
nt|ritong: oops|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  the last 5 10-board matches in the Swiss Qualifying   top 15 and  1 seed Yeh Bros then advance to KO phase|pg||
nt|mrdct: declarer going well so far|pg||
nt|pef: now he has to decide whether sementa ducked the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer might go for the @h finesse now and will go down 3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: and now they are getting to game|pg||
nt|mrdct: about 1:50 until the next match with the lunch break now|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|kareno: But what a swing at trick 2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: Goodnight from Las Vegas :)  Much more bridge to come!!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @s were as required cold slam|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pef: which was going to be the same decision he was going to make later|pg||
nt|mrdct: north should've ruffed the @s high|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kemperg: 2 off now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: bye for now|pg||
nt|frankaus: tu all 4 ur company|pg||
nt|kemperg: see you in 10 min.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|yuval10: can safely discard the 8@d now|pg||
nt|yuval10: unless he's convinced that South has the K@s and no J@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: looking at East' discard - he discarded 4@h over the 3rd @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: or higher|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well. this gone be tough for dec now right ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly not easy|pg||
nt|mikael_w: or maybe he just play for trumf 1-1 now and then S must trow his @dJ on @c9|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult to ruff and pull trumps|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yuval10: not much of indication there i'm affraid... but W did well anyway|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: i don't think you can overcall a 15-17 NT with 19, vul, at imps|pg||
nt|athene: the risk of missing 3n is just too high|pg||
nt|athene: especially with a third seat opener which might be light|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  9 where Burgess misguessed trump in 3@D    NS never in the auction   1@S by West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 1@S East  [after transfer response]|pg||
nt|pef: since he's playing hearts here he already decided the ace of clubs is onside|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrdct: but didn't quite time the endplay in trumps on west - needed to cash the @DA earlier|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mrdct: or pitched a @c|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andy_h: Good play by Brown, holding his losses to one off|pg||
nt|andy_h: Certainly a possible pick up board, although I'm not sure if it will be enough|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be a push with 3N going down -- will be interesting to see what happens at other tables|pg||
mc|9|nt|sybarra: some imps for Sweden  (Much needed) |pg||

nt|woozle: Hmm...I don't think that this restrained raise to 3S is working for Fallenius - 4H is laydown|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=902   then click on appropriate link for Final|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|woozle: Walking the dog is less effective when you don't go through with it|pg||

pc|h3|nt|gracelin: in fact with Fredin's hand, I would have doubled the 1D opening|pg||
nt|woozle: Well, on 9, Patrick was right - this was the 99th table. Sementa raised 5D to 6|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if South bids than 1@H=@H & @S   if not, 1@H=@S|pg||
nt|panja: and interestingly, 4@H might be a good sac against 3Nt here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Gonzalo :)|pg||
nt|pef: east west got to the most hated expert imp contract in the open room--2 no trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  10 in Women's    1C +90     3@D +110|pg||
nt|andy_h: A problematic hand for Edgtton|pg||

mb|4H|nt|kiwibridge: np so he was -1 5 more to Neill|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the gap down to 18|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@c by north will probably make but by south a @s lead will beat it i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: talk about 3N & NS saves in 4@H   --  the only time i played against the great PO Sundelin was in matchpoint event -- and he realized 4N was better than doubling -- until then i'd ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only seen that happen in books|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Panja, down to the stayers Venky|pg||
nt|rv: 2@h is @h+minor possibly, many play woolsey or capp convention|pg||
nt|rv: combined hands, 4@h is a make, fitting cards|pg||
nt|rv: best lead for defense, Duboin should play 3 rounds of @s and hop with @hA and play 4th @s, still declarer can get home by ruffing high|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm rather peeved that this is the end for the day, as I'm sure the spectators are, it's a shame|pg||
nt|rv: nearly impossible to bid though, North can bid 2@d (if playing woolsey) as single suit major, still can't either North or South or bidding to 3 level, single dummy can't see a way ...|pg||
nt|rv: to bid game |pg||
mb|4S|nt|yuval10: hello Allen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: what's this double mean?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm sure security can be guaranteed in this day and age if that really was their concern|pg||
mb|d|nt|pef: and I bet duboin makes 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the women started with Board  8 so they've already played our remaining hands of the set|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think either 2@H or 2@S is fair enough|pg||
nt|andy_h: Partner's double doesn't promise 10+ points so 2NT may not be so good when a 5-3 spade fit is available|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: the penalty x has vanished from the game|pg||
nt|pef: he's going to take a diamond, 4 clubs, 3 hearts, and a spade I would think|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW sold out here a bit too quickly with their 9-cards @c fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: notice that the side with top 5 @S cards is the side that never bid the suit|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps DSIP, I'm max|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I have no idea, was guessing|pg||
nt|mrdct: only 3 losers, but declarer will need a few ruffs and the defence is on the right track with a trump lead|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 2C=Majors|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: X=extras|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: However, it still makes little sense to me|pg||
nt|panja: E bid 1Nt first time..because that was the normal thing to do..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=5+   Nystrom DBL=3@H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|athene: i suppose north felt he didn't have the playing strength for 1nt|pg||
nt|mrdct: where are the extras? and she doesn't have 5@h|pg||
nt|panja: BAL hand, 8+ HCP..and a H check...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vdoubleu: That's what I was thinking|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Cannot understand it|pg||
nt|peachy: Not yet time for 'state of the match' 4H|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 1@H=5+HCP 4+@H|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, this looks like 100 or 300 to me ?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pef: I may amend that to 2 spades and no diamonds :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: certainly it is a fairly poor 15|pg||
nt|yuval10: a 2NT good-bad from W looks sensible|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mrdct: another interesting point on this hand is should 2NT still be lebensohl over the 2@h bid?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think south with cash a @c honour and then play @HA and another|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: How many tricks will Lew take once Curtis gets on & plays A + another heart? |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 9?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: assuming he does here|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks like 9 to me, 4@H, 1@S, 4@D|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: there will a late @c loser in the wash i think and declarer can only ruff one|pg||
nt|mrdct: joe grue's original trump lead is now look pretty good|pg||
nt|mildredb: curtis doesn't know about @S situation - probably worrying about that|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: south know partner doesn't have much in @c so he's kind of marked with something in @s for the 3@c bid|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Curtis is thinking about whole hand here & what Mildred says is the reason he has not played a card yet--the spade suit|pg||
nt|mildredb: but could be @SK|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|mildredb: @CQJ|pg||
nt|mildredb: can't see what he can do about it if that is the case|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Right, so being IMPs, go for the beat|pg||
nt|panja: but the kind of @H check he has is not suitable for a Nt contract...|pg||
nt|fifee: 100 likely|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps he might be able to give north a @d ruff now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other matches, no trailing team has taken the lead  [but not sure how many hands scored]|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  not sure you ever get 300 after a @H lead |pg||
nt|woozle: What lead makes a difference?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, same thing no matter what the lead is|pg||
nt|sybarra: just looking,  nothing works  |pg||
nt|othered1: East, who hasn't seen the @S position, still has hopes of scoring this.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: looked more like 13 to me|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: hmmm|pg||
nt|mildredb: yep|pg||
nt|panja: that is why, after the dbl of 3@H...he had to go back to the drawing board...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps 2@S and a @d.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: but seems unlikely as joe might have lead a stiff @D|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s9|nt|kiwibridge: no matter how many he makes they bid the game|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: Kaplan Rubens evaluator doesn't even think 13     12.75   http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|mildredb: CAsh @C & lead @H|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in playoff for 3rd/4th  thru 9 boards     Hampson 36  Japan 9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugrapha4: Made 2 sorry**|pg||
pc|cK|nt|algraves:  declarer has created an interesting postion here for an overtrick|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, if he plays @s now to make this I think it can be more then 100|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrdct: this works as if declarer runs @D now south will get a ruff to beat it|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes|pg||
nt|woozle: Not Hampson v Japan again...I commentated that match two days ago|pg||
nt|othered1: hampson has lost to Japan twice in KO phase, so may be due revenge.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if specs don't know    they tied the match, but Japan won tie-break by total-points|pg||
nt|sybarra: after next hand (last in this set)  we are due to be back in 15 min |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, covered all bases|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and that will be a VERRY importent 15 min for the swedish team and for the swedish coach|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they lost in total points by very few as I remembr|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pef: he can make an overtrick now by cashing the spade and queen of hearts and throwing lair in with a diamond, but|pg||
nt|pef: he's deciding whether that is completely safe right now|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|mrdct: just doesn't have enough tricks to get to a high cross-ruff position|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|s7|nt|andy_h: Given that South is a passed hand and didn't act over the double, I think 2@H would have been a wiser choice for Edgtton since that's what he would bid with 2-5-3-3|pg||
nt|mrdct: so tries ruffing finese in @s?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: has to ruff in S |pg||
pc|d4|nt|braunstar: yes agreed, given this state of match also i would expect a double from south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 of the 4 teams that are playing today are 4-handed, the other [Japan] 5-handed|pg||
pc|hT|nt|woozle: cute..a coup d'agonie to keep trump control|pg||

nt|bbramley: i agree with patrick about doubling 1@D - clear to me, with 44 majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: going back to  9  --  do the panelists partnerships have definitions for what is needed to pull (4@S)-DBL   vs  hands that will PASS|pg||
nt|woozle: Tough hand, but EW would like to reach 6H|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  1@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1N=17-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Unfortunately, the general direction shot of 1NT might be an underbid for hearts|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=5+@S & 4+@H  a) weak  b) FG|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|woozle: I don't often have firm agreements. At this vul, 5D will be reasonable|pg||
nt|gracelin: they finish early at this table.  Next set will start in about 30 minutes from now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Fallenius has done well - I assume this is 5/5, FG. Fredin's 4H doesn't look like enough|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h , really  a bit surprising|pg||
nt|bbramley: agree|pg||
nt|gracelin: just 4H by Frdedin, no cue bid or something ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and specs were asking if Fredin had option other than 2@H   |pg||
nt|woozle: I know that the stiff spade is a mixed blessing, but the four good trumps and aces deserve some sort of effort|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was adamant in my answer --- i don't know|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gracelin: I am afraid this will be another 13 imps to Lavazza|pg||
nt|woozle: If 2d could be a 1-count, maybe he can't bid more (unless preferring spades)|pg||
mc|12|nt|woozle: no, only 11 imps|pg||
nt|ritong: guess EW need some refreshments|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks all.  See you again in 26 minutes|pg||
nt|ritong: they will have plenty of time to sip it|pg||
nt|woozle: I notice that this is the same Swedish team who were on the other end of a match like this against Australia two days ago|pg||
nt|bbramley: thx everyone|pg||
nt|woozle: Brutally efficient performance by the italians|pg||
pg||

nt|ahollan1: i was going to say extra overtrick gets all the matchpoints|pg||
nt|sybarra: guys I have a very early day tomorrow,  cu all tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: the italians are on fire in this set |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last hand,  of the set |pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: Burgess  3 hands in a row  3@D -1    [thanks Geo]|pg||
nt|mrdct: at least 4@h-1 was a good save vs 2NT in the open room!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just 4 to go now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: cya|pg||
nt|sybarra: gn all|pg||
nt|mildredb: gn Shirley|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and 7 more imps|pg||
nt|pef: this looks like a normal 3nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: we want thank Xu, our wonderful operator |pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think it impossible to bid slam here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: good situation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that start will slow down LIN|pg||
nt|rv: in OR, E-W got active enabling South to compete again with 3@h and North raised to game|pg||
nt|woozle: Another 11 imps on offer here, as Fredin missed a good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the cards are not generating, I saw in set one , one match had 0 imps diff after 16, the other had +2|pg||
nt|panja: he should just bid 3Nt|pg||
nt|pef: 2 hearts is limit raise or better in clubs|pg||
nt|woozle: I won't blame Fallenius, who appeared to do his bit to reach it.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = no 4+major|pg||
nt|athene: you need to discuss if x of these transfer responses = the suit bid or t/o of the suit shown|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = artificia  10-12 HCP, not 4+@H/@S|pg||
nt|andy_h: yes, after board 18 and 19 which could be potential minus scores I think Brown has to double. I mean, he has an Ace and 5 trumps and partner has overcalled 2@D!|pg||
nt|braunstar: 4s the spot here|pg||
nt|sybarra: no over call?|pg||
nt|rv: unless E-W get active it was tough to get to game in last deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: this will sac|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@D was xfer of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to all of the commentators |pg||
mb|3H|nt|algraves:  what system do the Japanese play ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3N needs more than 1 trick from partner -- that seems like too much to ask|pg||
nt|panja: this bidding got his suit out, but not his strength|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course to the Yeh Brothers who bring us this wonderful tourney every year |pg||
nt|woozle: No, not every year any more|pg||
nt|fifee: very gracious hosts|pg||
nt|woozle: Now biennial|pg||
nt|sybarra: at the rate of the prize level that makes sense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2009 was last of the "annual"|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|sybarra: with xxx in @D N probably feels its a bit shakey to come |pg||
nt|sybarra: *come in|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south didn't quite have a X even if it was t/o, though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can they cash 3 aces?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: can an ace go away?|pg||
nt|frankaus: red 4333  - 3 level  far too hard to come in|pg||
nt|rv: well judged by D-S to stop at safe level, too much wastage in @s|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't really know what Duboin's bids mean, so I don't know how well they're progressing toward slam|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: some pairs specifically say 1@S = 4+@D   which fits in with Griffiths-Richman use of 1@C-1N as natural 6-11|pg||
nt|athene: entry to the diamonds getting taken out so declarer will have to play on clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but a spade shift gives the defence far too many tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Spade switch from Burgo may make the hand easier for Nye|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL  2@D was any min -- doesn't seem that DBL affected the auction|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes|pg||
nt|braunstar: heart lead will help here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c might be the stayman convention|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: either round suit ace can go if the other is cashed|pg||
nt|andy_h: I guess 3@H is some sort of spade raise?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: we're all guessing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he does have 6 losers [assuming @S has 1 loser]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems like a very reasonable evaluation |pg||
nt|yuval10: looks rather naturalish first couple of boards|pg||
nt|rv: possibly Duboin would have made a game try with a pure 5422 14 hcp hand in which loser count would be lesser|pg||
nt|woozle: Apparently 2D was 16+ without spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was the Duboin-Bocchi System Book ever translated from Italian?|pg||
nt|woozle: I've seen system notes that needed to be translated into their own language|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: well the diamonds aren't enough tricks by themselves anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unless switch|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but not now|pg||
nt|mrdct: this seems to roll home comfortably looking at all 4 hands|pg||
nt|yuval10: E had a tough bid to make here and he decided to overbid his hand a bit but showing his shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: basically there is just no hope :)|pg||
nt|athene: south naturally wondering if he has to return a spade now|pg||
nt|panja: true..3N is crazy...but the actual bidding was meek|pg||
nt|sybarra: even with X,  can expect short @D in pard's hand but still...|pg||
nt|rv: here he had values in short suit and judged well as he often does|pg||
mb|6H|nt|peachy: perfect time to refresh your drinks and coffee |pg||
nt|mrdct: but joe doesn't yet know that the @HK and @SA are onside|pg||
nt|woozle: Duboin gives it one more try|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if his partner has the @SA and nothing else, it might be necessary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with my grumbling about claims -- we're 2 boards ahead of the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: but N had a great hand with the black suits, which pard said he had |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: women's match also low scoring  thru 9 boards   Bilski 12  Clark 3|pg||
nt|rv: in OR, Furuta upgraded his 14 hcp to open 1n, not right evaluation of hand|pg||
nt|woozle: And Sementa is there for him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now the real fun begins|pg||
nt|othered1: As usual, Duboin judges correctly|pg||
nt|fifee: @H lead, anyone?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: doesnt seem to be any losing line|pg||
nt|woozle: There's always a losing line..you just need to find someone with the talent to find it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mrdct: running scores: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResultKnockout.aspx?section=b6b714a8-e406-4ec7-bdb2-fd1c39596dce&round=1&tourid=902|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually Zhuang's stretch to bid 1@S may have kept NS out of trouble|pg||
nt|woozle: Nystrom finds a well-considered diamond lead, figuring that the club won't establish a trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: best ever story about compression plays is in the classic  Right Through the Pack|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: often in this situation you just have to ask yourself "would declarer, with plenty of tricks in the minors, duck the opening lead if the spades were wide open?"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: and then you can see he wouldn't|pg||
nt|athene: but here it wasn't that clearcut|pg||
nt|frankaus: + pd passed originally|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: because declarer doesn't know the @CK is right for him even if he has @CAJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sidebar -- i'm confident that Kit Woolsey would object to Courtney's original @H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the boys can make grand slam in any if not all suits/nt  but conspire to let the women take all 13|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: wd|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|sybarra: yes that is the problem I think |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: woolsey likes to try to find partner's 5-card suit if you don't have one of your own|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: so he prefers 3- over 4-card suit, right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly|pg||
nt|athene: that might well be correct|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mikael_w: well. It simply looks like Italy team is to good. At the same time as the swedish team has played much worse the normal the italy team has played verry verry well. So therefor this ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: huge IMP-diferent|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: it depends to an extent on how aggressively you expect partner to act with a decent 5-card suit of his own|pg||
nt|algraves:  declarer always had a road to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy overplaying the hand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panja: Zhuang has to bid 1@S I guess..not a bad hand..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of Precision   1@S isn't as automatic as in standard|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yuval10: he's going down here|pg||
nt|algraves:  double dummy he can still survive|pg||
nt|yuval10: if you switch N and S's hand there would be a nice show-up squeeze|pg||
nt|algraves:  3 roudns of clubs ruffing and a low heart exit|pg||
nt|algraves:  ns are winkled|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dK|pg||
