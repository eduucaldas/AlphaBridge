nt|iain sime: It looks like the Welsh East West have a good result here. 5@H will make.|pg||
nt|greerm: 5@H makes so -300 good for Wales|pg||
mb|d|nt|greerm: with a strong one suiter, West chooses to dbl then bid her suit|pg||
nt|greerm: how high then is the question :)|pg||
nt|iain sime: West comes to North's rescue. If your partner is going to pass 1@H with that South hand, you must open 2@C|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: North took the direct route to 4@H opposite a passed partner|pg||

pc|c8|pc|h8|pc|cJ|nt|greerm: and soome would bid 2@S weak, and some would pass, all might be right on the day|pg||

nt|jcomyn: who backs out first|pg||
nt|paulg:  unlike the first half, I guess NS will stay quiet and leave EW to themselves|pg||
nt|lark20: Could it be East/West's turn to have the points?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: grind to a halt in 4s i guess|pg||
nt|paulg:  Spades always win|pg||
nt|paulg:  and the likely heart lead will make it simple to play|pg||
nt|jcomyn: problem is round and round they go and where will it stop|pg||
nt|lark20: Should be a nice start for Yvonne|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d-1@s-2@c-4@s?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: hello from manchester|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good evening all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: Good afternoon Everyone|pg||
nt|odysseus69: delighted to see Dinah Caplan in action- a youthful 78 year old making her International debut with my good friend Lizzie Godfrey|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The Irish ladies got a bit of a shellacking in the first set. Let us see if they can recover |pg||
nt|petepunt: scotaln 58,  Ireland 57 Enf 49|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: 4s not a bad sacrifice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a small select group watching here :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: a strong 1H  but they dont paly strong 2s or Benji  so no choice|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4H is a good spot|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  hard for EW to get into the auction though |pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: mjkousy 2h|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless 2@h is getting passed out|pg||
nt|simonx:  For the English, they need to win by 59 IMPs to get a maximum 25 VPs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: indeed|pg||
nt|benjy: Hi Victor|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: ooips|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: mmm...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: LIZZZZZZZ|pg||
nt|paulg:  automatic for McGowan to balance|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but irish not there yet|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Victor and Ben|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 hearts is a lucky make but not one to bid|pg||
nt|petepunt: West has a ood hand but single @H & @S arent worth much  so 3@C  might hav ebeen enough|pg||
mb|d|nt|larrymori: hello all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any preferences for double rather than 3@h?|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s is trusting the opponents too much |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: surely have to bid 4s|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: almost...|pg||
nt|paulg:  a little more sophisticated but a sound auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so no chanc e of going wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Punch knows it is a 4-4 fit, so unlikely to sacrifice at this vul|pg||
nt|paulg:  the Irish stopped in 2@h, why sacrifice?|pg||
nt|paulg:  A small spade lead would be testing|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch must feel N/S are already pushed beyond their limits|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcomyn: yea s lead some guess|pg||
nt|benjy: Indeed, 4@H is not a game you really want to be in looking at the two hands|pg||
nt|benjy: But it would make|pg||
nt|petepunt: still par result 5@C minis 2 as not reasonable to pass 1H|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|yo_yo: hello|pg||
nt|larrymori: I would rather bid 4 than 3 so X allows 3@h after a minor|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: next hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: all ladies!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: men leave the room please :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: nah, letskeep a few of them :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree - even in these unenlightened days, 2@h over 1@s should show a decent hand |pg||
nt|simonx:  England's main loss in the first half was reopening the bidding when the oppo had stopped in 2@c.  They then got to 5@c and made it.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|benjy: Godfrey was heavy for 2@H but not close to a 3@H call in my opinion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and more of the same here - EW could have defended 3@h and now they are defending a making 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or a should-be-making 4@h, anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|paulg:  still on a spade guess, but West would probably lead from the queen|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2 hearts in a loud voice used to describe this - bidding boxes dont give the samr opportunity|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yo_yo: the welsh ladies playing acol with a weak NT (of course)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|greerm: do they play udca?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|iain sime: This is a good 3NT making an overtrick with the diamond position.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|greerm: a swing to NI when South in the other room found a @D try|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|iain sime: The ace was for attitude, so presumably the ten encouraged. It is usually better to get count v. suit contracts so the king is best from AK.|pg||

nt|paulg:  EW will be sacrificing on this hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but nthere is here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Of course Yvonne will have been on vugraph a few times before, as Scotland vs England is often shown from the Peggy Bayer (U20) match|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also from the Junior Europeans|pg||
nt|odysseus69: slam time|pg||
nt|kemperg: this is interesting|pg||
nt|simonx:  Known as  Biltcliffe Coup to some ... reopen a aprtscore and then they make game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, no, no - you have to double the game as well|pg||
nt|simonx:  ... and some say you have to double AND misdefend|pg||
nt|mamos: took me a while to find the right room|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbt: DHAMPUR SUGER 109 , R L KAJRIWAL 112, a BAGARIA 82|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well should nagainst vul opposition|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that was a good save against 4@H |pg||
nt|benjy: Looks like 6@D/@C is a make |pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 1c-1d-3d and they will bid it smoothly|pg||
nt|petepunt: its the one with the blue&red door :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbt: MMRMC 102,   BIMAL SIKKA 86|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hefty 3s|pg||
nt|paulg:  although that opening would put most off|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1c -1d-2d and???|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that board probably flat - a more, how can we put it, appreciative auction should get to 4@h anyway  |pg||
nt|mamos: ty|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: probably not biddable |pg||
nt|odysseus69: key moment|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: will see if the other room gets into the bidding (last hand) |pg||
nt|petepunt: many would open the East hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: I think south should bid 3@D and then north 3@H|pg||
nt|kemperg: now its on|pg||
nt|benjy: What is south going to do over that?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to get there now and I agree about 3D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: best she can do|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: W made of sterner stuff :)|pg||
nt|larrymori: it would be something to reach 4@s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbb: South thinking...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6 loser hand yes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzbt: BANEET 93,    MMSNEHA  86|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont be tested but ew will be in the open room|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@S to keep 3NT in the game? Remember South doesn't know that partner has a slam try yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Liz has a big hand opposite a 4@d overcall, but few tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: perhaps thinking she should have opened 4...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch did will to pave the way for a sacrifice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: irish pair very aggressive bidders in there|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@H could just be looking for 3NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: undo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c fourth suit. Not normally game-forcing by a passed hand|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@d now?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: so probably 2@h form North, and then South will have to take a view|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: NS fit very well|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|chick: anyone like the X of 2@C?  I'm not sure I'd want a club lead (even if S were on lead)|pg||
nt|benjy: Wow 3NT is a huge underbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S would be a good description |pg||
nt|petepunt: s has done well here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|odysseus69: 3nt is pusillanimous from North - confident that English pair will bid this|pg||
nt|kemperg: not good:((|pg||
nt|benjy: South has a minimum 3@D bid and slam is cold, 3NT is also a terrible spot, if the @SQ loses you go down in 3NT when you make 6@D|pg||
nt|larrymori: 2@s with the good @ss would have been worth a try|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but South has passed - not unreasonable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lark20: I thought Yvonne would have bid 3H here|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess that they don't play checkback, as you might invite with the West hand|pg||
nt|mamos: those Aces are worth a lot|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzbb: a rather stingy 9@C...|pg||
nt|petepunt: its 'the fit' that makes this good|pg||
pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: from Norths positon a grand was close than 3NT |pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: i dont mind it, sometimes keeps them out of 3NT ( which is sometimes good - or bad)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now dangerous to finesse trumps|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may make the play of hts different |pg||
nt|sybarra: like cashing of AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes bash them out and get a nice surprise|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petepunt: if S had long @C they would subside in 2@D so I like the auction|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|paulg:  again, it is non-vulnerable so the rewards are not so great|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Rory Timlin|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and patsy meehan is west in the open room and will be in 4h|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh dear now it's down|pg||
nt|kemperg: can't believe that 3NT from N|pg||
pc|dK|nt|benjy: North had a slam drive|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c2|pc|d3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: and not -2 |pg||
nt|mamos: easy game :)   well done|pg||
pc|s6|nt|benjy: Hopefully this will be a slam swing for England, time will tell|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: *now |pg||
nt|simonx:  For the non-English - Dinah Caplan is 78 years old.  She and Lizzie Godfrey were the surprise at the trials.  They led most of the way and won handsomely|pg||
pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: time to claim|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|greerm: inverted minor?|pg||
nt|greerm: might lead to the NT being played other way up|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|iain sime: With nine top tricks it won't matter. But how do you reach spade fits bidding this way?|pg||
nt|greerm: presumably South would show 4 in a Major if she had it|pg||
nt|greerm: many play that the 2@C denies a major|pg||
nt|vugraphzay: N thinking|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: worried now that there is a hole in the @H suit|pg||

nt|paulg:  Lindopp may upgrade to 1NT?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but makin it is another question|pg||
nt|lark20: if you can't make it don't bid it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petepunt: simple 3N here|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Hi JC and all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi rory|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not quite for 4S|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|paulg:  this is why I would have upgraded, it justs feel too good for a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|paulg:  I am told that EW play weak jump shifts and checkback, so 2@h was mildly invitational|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Will the Irish bid and make the tight game this time?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doubt it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too many holes in the side suits|pg||
nt|golfsquash: It is getting more thought this time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and hard to see how n can fill those holes|pg||
nt|lark20: With 8 points and albeit a 6-card suit, game does not seem likely opposite a 12-14  hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petepunt: We feature Wales and NI's top pairs at this table though N/S both have Camrose open experience too.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  of course 3NT is not cold|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bunch of taps in hts and this contract can get dicey |pg||
nt|benjy: Now this is a decent game|pg||
pc|s8|nt|odysseus69: easy double dummy but not a make in prctice- conservative choice and luckily avoiding good but failing game|pg||

mb|p|nt|greerm: a slam on the @C finesse and the trump kind|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|greerm: if 1@C can be 2, it's difficult to bid 3 east|pg||

nt|petepunt: playing 5 card majors with 15-18 and 4144 shape, i advise 1D rather than 1C|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think now you ask for a few undos and bid 1N on the first round |pg||

mb|5D|nt|jcomyn: surely must balasnce with s hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doesnt look sound to me|pg||
nt|greerm: i think 2, 3@C 1@H and 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Ferguson has a Nepal flag, operator; could be a mistake :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4 could easily go down, finessing in trumps|pg||
nt|kemperg: max with fit|pg||
nt|mamos: yes  South may be worried about D control now  knowes 4@h is second round|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  well, i think she does have a double negative, perhaps a triple negative|pg||
nt|lark20: 2@H is "less than a Q"|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I know Nepal and Northern Ireland are close to each other on the scroll bar|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont see any flag|pg||

pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: but surely 1nt by s on this auction is hardly balanced 16- hcp|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway i am not defending 1s|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will eventually play ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens this seems to be one of those times when partner does have eight tricks in notrump|pg||
nt|golfsquash: She will lose 4 trumps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and you end up in a very shaky contract - to put it mildly|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it is natural play to finesse the ht |pg||
pc|s3|nt|odysseus69: yes - having bid only 2S which limits the quality the West hand worth a cue which would be of no interest to East here|pg||
nt|larrymori: it was better leading from the honor|pg||

nt|greerm: not always obvious to draw trump with such poor holdings but,|pg||

nt|larrymori: south has to lead a @s twice now when in with the @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: defence got a little muddled...making 8 tricks|pg||
nt|petepunt: it is a very good 6 as you can lead uppto KQJ@D twice before trying @cQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  once she has finished trying to reconstruct NS hands that fit the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: not that she cares too much...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: but wendell had to signal spade not club |pg||

pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  i think South has to double 1@s|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: thats my view also|pg||
nt|baldfriede: The problem was that West was in the lead, and drawing trumps from Kx does not look too good.|pg||

nt|jcomyn: must say i dont like it|pg||
nt|simonx:  Thanks for the replay, Stephen ... it was like watching the film Memento|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|paulg:  the 4-card minor will prevent Punch from considering a save|pg||

nt|baldfriede: This will be a 1nt. Not much action so far yet.|pg||

nt|odysseus69: aces do tempt me|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|odysseus69: j of diamonds works well|pg||

nt|baldfriede: And it should go down 1, Cards sit wrong for declarer.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @H is the "relay" response  (pass or correct) |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  I agree, it is not a good opener at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes thats Y ciara tried 4N and sold out.  it is easy for us to oversimplyfy i agree|pg||
mb|4D|nt|benjy: But that wouldn't get a @C lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: best start:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: another difficult play hand for Sandie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as commented, good case for a club lead - you have an honour, and hopefully can set some tricks up - heart lead needs a good holding from partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Easy to say that this is not the best spot, but in practice I don't think there is a good spot|pg||
nt|golfsquash: unblock now|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: Would you bid 3@C guys?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  since 3@s will lead to 4@s|pg||

pc|hK|nt|jcomyn: well you know them these days if you are not in 3nt you are in 6d|pg||
pc|hA|nt|greerm: ah, no entry so will go off |pg||
nt|kemperg: but 3@C ???|pg||
nt|kemperg: hoping for X now?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: sort of wrong sided but ok with A@D onside|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@C is the kind of bid that deserves the auction to proceed all pass and hey presto game is cold|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice bid 5@D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it is often a mistake to support partners minor with nothing but 5 trumps - it often helps opponents|pg||
nt|benjy: Cheeky pass from Caplan over 4@C, hoping not to push the opponents into game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: friendly lie here|pg||
nt|simonx:  The result has just come in on the board where Caplan made 2@s doubled - 16 IMPs to England ...|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|sybarra: lucky the ace of @D on side  |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: u were right paul|pg||
nt|simonr: North will need to exit a trump|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, but to shut out opponents?|pg||
nt|simonr: Needs to overtake and continue @S|pg||
nt|greerm: or let south continue @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: you were faster Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hope i am on the tennis court in 30 mins|pg||
nt|benjy: North has a normal X of 5@D which will go two light|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: i x on the s hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont wait for p |pg||
nt|paulg:  1@h was not much of a space-consuming vulnerable overcall and, unsuprisingly, McGowan expected more|pg||
nt|paulg:  South will open in the other room, so they will not be in 3NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: want to bet|pg||

nt|paulg:  your sources are generally better than mine Stephen|pg||
nt|simonr: Whoops|pg||
nt|benjy: brb|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see that on board 20 the Englsih NS did collect 800 from 2@Sx |pg||
nt|simonx:  You were right with that 800 prediction in 2@sX, Mike, but at the wrong table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: twas ever thus|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly a game swing on 22 as well|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|kemperg: end result the best|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes par|pg||
nt|odysseus69: without te 3D bid my guess is that 3C would have been the end|pg||

pc|h9|nt|lark20: How lucky can Scotland be?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: A little gift.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that would be my cup of tea|pg||
nt|simonx:  The way the VP scale goes, England are capped when the score gets to 25-5, but the Northern Ireland score carries on down to 25-0, so they still have something to play for.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: they will probably come fast and furious soon|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: with the cards  so badly placed NS have done well to stay in 2@s here  I can imagine some pairs getting higher|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: I dont believe this its a mirage|pg||
nt|simonr: Although the @H look ominous if North has the corect count (which she does) she should realise there is no entry|pg||

nt|lark20: Agree. It is south who has the defence.|pg||
nt|paulg:  bit of a gift for the Irish|pg||
nt|jcomyn: my money is on irish to bid 4s|pg||
nt|paulg:  although Punch and McGowan are still settling into their partnership, they are both quite resilient and will not let bad results get them down|pg||
nt|paulg:  Scotland were apparently similarly afflicted in the other room on board 20 and let 3NT make|pg||
nt|simonr: South should be Ingham - they got her name wrong last night as well!|pg||
nt|greerm: Isn't it L Woodruff too Simon?|pg||

mb|p|nt|greerm: and Sandie Millersship while wer'e at it :)|pg||
nt|greerm: millership|pg||
nt|chick: by playing the way she did, she had to guess whether E's 3rd card was heart or diamond|pg||
nt|benjy: On the last hand North knew that West had 10 red cards from the bidding so after the two top @Ss the A@C was perfectly safe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual |pg||
nt|petepunt: 6N by East,  but any slam will do|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|simonx:  Right, weak on weak ... I thought that was a no-no |pg||
mb|4H|nt|lark20: It is a stronger hand than I would have expected from Punch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: terrible pass by s on thnis bidding what did she waznt|pg||
nt|paulg:  Onishuk missed a chance there .. partner must be quite strong when you hold the diamond singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: 2@D will nearly always be 5 first in hand...|pg||
nt|paulg:  somtimes 4 Stephen?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s can be defeated, but you would to be there|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: What do the initials stand for anyway? I am not that familiar with these players.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: ....would want to be there |pg||
mb|4N|nt|paulg:  a fairly easy hand as declarer has no real option except to finesse the club|pg||
nt|greerm: I always look for a way to make 12 tricks on these type of hands, can't see any here|pg||
nt|simonr: Neither can GIB!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but she did bid 3s and thats all s wanted to hear surely|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|benjy: and by north too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT is the spot and they should get there - 1D -1S -1NT and a move from South|pg||
nt|kemperg: but can end in 2@D|pg||
nt|larrymori: keeps them out altogether|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  maybe McGowan/Punch overcall any 5-card major?|pg||

mb|p|nt|greerm: ah, we got Laura's name corrected, South next?|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  naturally you run to your other major|pg||

nt|benjy: If you bid 1NT you will never get across your shape, or playing strength|pg||
nt|mamos: yep Im betting on 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: South should have signed in 4@H and denied a @D control - if that is the methods|pg||

nt|baldfriede: No inverted minors.|pg||
nt|greerm: nor a 5 card major, so not the same need to show the @H now|pg||

nt|benjy: On board 9 Sally Brock chose to rebid 2@C instead of 3NT/3@D a call that i quite like and we didn't even mention!|pg||

nt|jcomyn: looks like 3nt and a prayer|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course 3@h sounds like a 6-card suit|pg||

nt|petepunt: 3n also makes of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  perhaps being non-vulnerable was important |pg||
nt|paulg:  games need to be 50% to be worth bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: i think so...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you would be amazed at the number of players whon regard 2c as a WEAK bid and have to jumpm - crazy as it seems|pg||
nt|lark20: 2@C just may not be forcing in their system|pg||
nt|larrymori: for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@c is not forcing in my system, but I don't expect to miss game with a singleton heart if partner passes|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|greerm: Norma Franklin has now found her parters K 3 times in a row|pg||

nt|mamos: he'll probably tell them quietly where they went wrong :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|benjy: For me 4@C would show @S support|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2 key times to think in card play a) when dummy goes down b) when you first gain the lead as defender|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: East likes that:)|pg||

nt|paulg:  easy to pass 3@s with no controls to speak of|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg:  and only three points in partner's suits|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petepunt: lower2suit I suspect West expected more points|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: fun here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: late chance for ireland to reduce arrears|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  a club continuation will hold this to nine tricks, as spades are 4-2|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps a takeout double of 2@s by Yvonne is a better way to get her hand across|pg||
nt|paulg:  then she would not feel obliged to bid over 3@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i dont understand why they do not play in their 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  because they need 11 tricks for game in that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this major mania is killing our game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I didnt say anything a\bout a game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and in any case nobody is doubling 5d|pg||

nt|iain sime: So Wales have ten back. We think N Ireland score is nine more than it should be.|pg||
nt|greerm: and North!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|iain sime: Last board here. Thanks all.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: 4th seat and 2NT will be natural, so diffult bid for North|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  resumption at 12.20|pg||
nt|iain sime: Most play 2Nt as natural here so North must bid 2@D|pg||
nt|greerm: probably 2@D hope to bid @C later which is how it went closed room|pg||

mb|2N|mb|3H|nt|greerm: ah, not natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: dbl now ?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yorkbeach:  did not want to encourage West to bid 3@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if North doubles, South leaves it in|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: North must surely pass.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  she could double|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: south got quite a few tricks even if N no dbl|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if North had a singleton @s, defensive prospects would be far less good|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|greerm: true but North figures to have something for 2NT|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|iain sime: This is a missed opportunity for Wales. 3@S will be about three light but only in 50s.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||

nt|vugraphzbb: back at table|pg||
nt|petepunt: CBAI 24 imps own to NIBU|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  but the lack of values and misfit will probably steer them to 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless South wanders in?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 27,  the 6 nt played from the other side in OR,  -1 |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: tx paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  they might bid game here|pg||
nt|simonr: I suspect a weak NT from South and an invite from North via a transfer. South should accept with AJx support and two aces |pg||
nt|chick: yes, from the other side, but the play went similiarly, and East pitched 2 hearts and saved her 4 clubs!|pg||
nt|simonx:  Is Dianh, at 78, is the oldest ever English player in the Lady Milne?  Almost certainly the oldest debutante|pg||
nt|mamos: down?|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes|pg||
nt|petepunt: scot about 7 up v England|pg||
nt|mamos: I like 2@d here |pg||
mb|2D|nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|greerm: there's an acol type Fred?|pg||
nt|greerm: weak NT|pg||
nt|benjy: In fact if south is known to have 7@D and 2@H then the only time it is right to play the way she did was when south had Q10 doubleton of @Cs she definitely misplayed that in my ...|pg||
nt|benjy: opinion|pg||
mb|d|nt|lark20: Thank you Paul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: finn is thanking her lucky stars|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: yes  but might be easier on a @D lead? |pg||
mb|3C|nt|chick: don't see why, won the diamond, took the spade finesse, and cashed all spades and diamonds, essentially the same as here|pg||
nt|kemperg: but she was lucky|pg||
nt|benjy: what is a jump in the 4th suit fro you guys?|pg||
nt|benjy: for me it is 55 forcing|pg||
nt|kemperg: isn't that a 55?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think the clue is no ht lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and probably needs a club lead to let it through|pg||
nt|petepunt: Y,  most play 2N as 19-21 or so.  Balancing in 4th|pg||
nt|mamos: so you can bid 3@c next time :0|pg||
mb|p|nt|lark20: With such a poor suit it was a good disciplined pass by South|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest I'd have bid 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: the other room might see a 3@H overcall...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it was paul who thought she might i knew she wouldnt |pg||
nt|kemperg: you are faster than me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: for me its 5-5 at the 3 level - for others a splinter - but here just natural forcing|pg||
nt|benjy: I don't understand why south doesn't bid 3@H over 3@C why rebid that @D suit!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petepunt: will be forced into guesing @C right so 9 tricks (maybe10)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|jcomyn: her mixed partner would have her guts for garters, so she didnt|pg||
nt|lark20: I would probably have bid 2@H as well and then been disappointed when my partner led the suit:)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: count on the @D early |pg||
nt|sybarra: count on the hand actually |pg||
nt|benjy: A thourougly unconvincing auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: giving opportunity to bid 3@H with 6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: she has excellent diamonds - if she plays poker|pg||
nt|petepunt: AC best|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kemperg: royal flush?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|baldfriede: She will probably misguess Q@s.|pg||
nt|simonr: Might go down if declarer gets trumps wrong - should play to ruff a diamond so E/W might help with trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petepunt: :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|paulg:  the double club finesse is liz's only chance of making this|pg||

pc|d4|pc|h5|pc|c8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|petepunt: N just happy to see the @C break!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  in the other room Punch plays sound 2-level overcalls, so more likely to be 3@H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|nt|greerm: more awkward to get the trump finesse right now, probably no overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: thinking..|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|benjy: Caplan played her pd to hold AQJ10 of @Ds, the only holding to beat game, but she might have led from that holding|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lark20: It would seem the only way to play it|pg||

nt|larrymori: Mike|pg||
mb|1N|nt|greerm: west has what I call a middle 2 suiter hand, so some, who play minimax, would not bid the michaels because of that|pg||
nt|simonr: I think West is too good for Micheals at this vul - many play it as weak or strong (not intermediate)|pg||
nt|greerm: snap Simon :)|pg||
nt|simonr: 3@H is probably a good spade raise|pg||
nt|greerm: 3@H clearly a good raise and 4@S will come from S|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Will South bid 4 on a minimum? Proably not|pg||

nt|vugraphzbb: Hi all|pg||
nt|paulg:  Good evening everyone and welcome to the Lady Milne 2011|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this could be quite a match|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Showing @h support, but how strong can it be?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamond lead needed to beat 4S|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H 1 down on 13, declarer stripped opps to play from the @C Q, well played, 1 down|pg||
nt|petepunt: not the time to upgrade!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no and not easy for East to lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|benjy: The NI declarer was unlucky to go down in 4@H on Board 13, 12 more to ENG|pg||
nt|petepunt: Americans Lead KH, Europeans 7@H and the italians 'the right @H'|pg||
pc|h2|nt|greerm: Sandie shows her second suit, presuming the 3@H dbl requested that?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcomyn: a very experienced scottish pair against the irish playing only 2nd time, but anna has been having a greast season at home|pg||
nt|petepunt: which is a @C here|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  in the other matches, Northern Ireland are leading NIBU (NI  2) by 10 imps and England lead Wales by 19 imps|pg||
nt|greerm: tempting now for Laura|pg||
nt|simonr: The double may just have shown @hs|pg||
nt|greerm: and the 4@C showed the extars we discussed earlier|pg||
nt|greerm: with @C|pg||
nt|mamos: Wales will lose quite a few imps on this board without doing much wrong |pg||
pc|dK|nt|greerm: well done to pass|pg||
pc|d3|nt|greerm: can she make this with the friendly @D layout?|pg||
nt|greerm: every card right actually|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@S would have been a cheap save vul against non if you could avoid two diamond losers - which is unlikely|pg||
nt|greerm: right for declarer that is|pg||
nt|simonr: Not sure why Wales went 2 off in the other room?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  Although Punch and McGowan are very experienced players, this is their first major event together|pg||
nt|jcomyn: she has won two of the major pairs titles|pg||
nt|jcomyn: setting down an early marker by mary lindopp|pg||
nt|lark20: This is Punch and McGowans first Lady Milne playing together|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: some thought from Punch ...|pg||
nt|larrymori: 3@s would have been better then cue cue slam|pg||
nt|simonx:  I agree ... I think 4@s should be weaker|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mamos: getting this played by South in 2NT was very bada s it happened  cos West knew which Heart to lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|greerm: might disc 2@D on the @S|pg||
nt|greerm: yes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: declarer has to duck but ??? - well done|pg||
nt|kemperg: take 2nd @D and play @H to the king|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcomyn: 5-2 fits are popular around here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: state of the match i daresay|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg:  Punch probably wondering whether to redouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that helps a little|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|greerm: didn't realise that the @D so good|pg||
nt|simonr: Going down now - need to ruff the opening lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzbb: I don't think so :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: knowing s may have 3 spade tricks what do you do|pg||
nt|paulg:  there are lots of variables in the Lady Milne and trying to compute the 'state of the match' is never easy|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h5|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: multi 2d|pg||
nt|greerm: this the last hand here, thanks all, next round starts at 12.10 Norther Ireland time|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@S by North in the other room!!!! I think not. This will mess up the IMP scores|pg||
nt|larrymori: west might try 3@d instead but X is very popular to show cards when stuck and not have 4@h+|pg||
mb|2D|nt|odysseus69: thx all - got to leave now|pg||
nt|benjy: West did well here to pass 1NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|greerm: London follow us btw :)|pg||
nt|benjy: This will be more imps for ENG|pg||
nt|mamos: ty to our op|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs for giving us the helpful info,  also some funny comments :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: undo |pg||
nt|simonx:  ... so this is the last board of the match.  Engalnd are exactly on the 101 IMP boudary for a maximum maximum victory in VPs|pg||
nt|larrymori: west might X here|pg||
nt|mamos: Ive enjoyed Petewr :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: simple 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Strange dealing machines, with 32 boards yesterday and 16 today without a slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Saving them all to the last match tomorrow!|pg||
nt|larrymori: east would not like it|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: yes but we expected a bit more from a very experienced pair here weho made some unchraacteristic errorsd|pg||
nt|larrymori: but down 1|pg||
nt|petepunt: N off on @C lead @H switch|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3N that is|pg||
pc|cA|nt|larrymori: unless the @d is ducked|pg||
nt|simonx:  There is a trick in each suit for the defence ... what can go wrong?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzbb: oops...sry|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lark20: Should be the same in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  small heart lead and diamond switch would be inspired against 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  this probably needs a diamond switch too when North gets with the @hK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: K|pg||
nt|benjy: A spec thinks it's right to pass if you deduct a point for Jx, i take that point but yes, but a vul game, J109 look nice and Q10xx looks good, not so clear|pg||
nt|benjy: I wouldn't crime anyone for inviting, i think it's close|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: this hand plays nicely with esp. with hts 3/3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|chick: it may go badly if N has to ruff with a heart honor|pg||
nt|sybarra: only has to ruff if ace of clubs cashed|pg||
nt|chick: although with the diamonds behaving, will still make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: or tried to cash |pg||
nt|petepunt: Note many would double with East to show 3@H after 2@D but support X's work less well with a weak NT system.|pg||
nt|mamos: this has not worked out well for NS|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1 off prob,  |pg||
mc|8|nt|paulg:  just going to play for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but costs nothing to play k and finesse in s|pg||
nt|simonx:  How soon will South play a diamond?|pg||
nt|larrymori: might have tried a red suit first with the spade as an entry|pg||
nt|mamos: ty bye|pg||
nt|petepunt: bye tx mike|pg||
