nt|vugraphzbj: Spillerne avtaler å ta 10 minutters pause. Det blir feil å vente på spill, fordi da skjønner de om det er et lett eller et vanskelig spill..|pg||
nt|sharkey: God stamp LR - 4@S står|pg||
nt|jbgood: lurer på hvorfor ikke Eide overførte og meldte kløver på det forrige - slem er ikke umulig å nå selv om øst åpner med 1 grand|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 ruter var en god stamp i ugunstig|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: 5 min igjen av pausen|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: jeg skulle ikke tatt fram spillet, beklager det.|pg||
nt|jbgood: gjør ingen ting Snorre |pg||
nt|baardolav: Par score fra lukket rom på spillet her... |pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: Vi er klare|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dAxx is good if you think partner is short|pg||
nt|athene: the play there was interesting|pg||
nt|simonr: Two flat boards so far - and there were only three in the first 16 boards!|pg||
nt|ady: which heart last hand?    could get blocked|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely no upgrade this time|pg||
nt|athene: objectively declarer should maybe try rising the @CK at trick 1?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  expecting Wales to gain an IMP on 21|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, sure, there are lots of ways NS can get into 5@S, but at least that makes them work for their 650|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it was S who bid 5@s at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: she can see it's down if she ducks, on best defence|pg||
nt|simonr: Sorry - correct three|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzbj: Jeg tipper Nils meldte 5ru fordi han håpet det sto..   :)|pg||
nt|simonr: WJO here by South?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  a weak 1NT for you :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: Routine 3NT here for NS.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  yes weak NV|pg||
nt|ady: n/s kept out of their heart fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  chance of getting @s right after East's opening|pg||
nt|athene: pim the jack offside not such good odds as drop the stiff king either side|pg||
nt|simonr: Not sure I like 4@S though especially when they overcall so aggressively|pg||
nt|athene: but the opening big changes things a bit|pg||
nt|athene: opening bid|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club lead  to beat 4@H     south can ruff 3rd round|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yorkbeach:  how are you playing the @d?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the 9th trick|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I doubt EW would bid 4@h even in an uncontested auction|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: low to J i assume|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzbj: samme som her|pg||
nt|jbgood: legg merke til at begge sydspillerne meldte sparfargen fremfor å doble opplysende |pg||
nt|athene: with this diamond suit you lead small to the jack then back and lead the queen|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: if you lead the Q first time you lose to stiff king onside|pg||
pc|d8|nt|simonr: East has a weak NT so will not get too excited|pg||
pc|dT|nt|baardolav: Endel spiller ut konge for å få fordelingskast på 4trinnet og over, tieren viser bare flere enn to|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  that is what I thought|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: if you lead to the jack then to the ten you lose to K9xx onside|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|nt|ady: low spade is best    could be sing king in either hand   where as playing the Queen  gains on against stiff jack with west|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even if declarer picked the trumps, it is hard to avoid 2@d losers|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h8|nt|ady: might get some sort of end play to only lose 1 diamond|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if East had actually opened a weak 1NT, leading the Q would be right|pg||
pc|h3|nt|baardolav: Hvis du kan melde 2 ganger på hånden så melder du 1sp, svakere så er det vel mere popå doble|pg||
nt|baardolav: på essutspill|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s3|nt|yorkbeach:  a strong NT |pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s9|pc|c4|nt|ady: duck a heart now and ruff a heart   and should get out for 1 diamond loser|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  how did declarer get out for 1 down?|pg||
nt|simonr: 5@D here looks the spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  tough to make with the @hK offside|pg||
nt|galadriel: Are we back in real time?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|simonr: Need to avoid two @H loser though|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 5/4 in the blacks,  i thought south might open|pg||
nt|galadriel: Multi from Grant|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yo_yo: support x ?|pg||
nt|athene: yes we are homing in steadily on Par Bridge :)|pg||
nt|ady: decent contract    but should bed down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  not this South|pg||
nt|sheila a: 4@h is a good spot|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:  suspect X = strong NT with no @h stopper|pg||
nt|athene: support doubles are not that common in a weak notrump base|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Woodruff might have opened the South cards|pg||
nt|simonr: Not playing with this North!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or Shea|pg||
nt|athene: east might just bash 3nt now for want of a better bid|pg||
nt|galadriel: Burns not pre-empting first in hand with a hand playable in a major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @DK is nicely placed.|pg||
nt|sheila a: trumps aren't behaving as well as you'd like|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: you need the double to show a strong notrump in a lot of auctions|pg||
nt|ady: ceertain to get to game|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to bid 2@H as that sort of sounds like 5-4 majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: Sparutspill holdt NS nede på 9 stikk i lukket rom. Ellers så blir det 11|pg||
nt|ady: and should be in it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agricultural|pg||
nt|sheila a: issues with getting back to hand|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  4 top winners for NS barring accidents|pg||
nt|athene: interesting lead problem for south|pg||
nt|simonr: East now needs to invent a forcing bid|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to bid 3@C because that's not the suit she has stopped, apart from anything|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S and a @H only losers.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yorkbeach:  N may need to find a way to signal for @c|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to lead unsupported aces|pg||
nt|simonr: Too late - on the other side of the pond she could have raised to 3D forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and of course a singleton trump is a bad lead too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lucky for EW that the @hK is wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: 2 imp å slåss om|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is it true?|pg||
nt|sheila a: undo - 4@h by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbj: Fila claimer...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 3 aces I would have been doubling 4@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what now ?|pg||
nt|athene: i think passing it was ok|pg||
nt|athene: no-one forced opps to bid game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if @s4 is suit prefernce, is easy|pg||
nt|athene: so if you assume they sort of know what they are doing, making is more likely than -2, surely?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you are probably right|pg||
nt|athene: double might have a big upside if it caused declarer to play you for trump length and go down in a makeable contract i suppose|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  all I need is a singleton in either minor in partner's hand for 2 off|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  may be falt with 5@d - 1 in the other room|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzbj: ikke rart de tar igjen lukket rom|pg||
nt|ady: yes     |pg||
nt|galadriel: 5@C would be a good save - only one down , unless West finds an inspired @D lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yorkbeach:  no justice sometimes :(|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: you could bid 2@H and then if partner raises, you just bid 5@D and put the bidding boxes away to stop her going back to hearts|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|ady: just down 1    so should be a push    unlucky for Wales  if they play in 5@D in OR|pg||
nt|simonr: Playing with screens she can't see that!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont blame her for bashing, why tell opps what to lead?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  + @c could yield several tricks without any ruffs|pg||
nt|sheila a: swings and roundabouts of disciplined pre-empting|pg||
nt|sheila a: Once Burns didn't open it was impossible to come back in|pg||
nt|galadriel: I agree with her pass|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: yes true, double could strike oil|pg||
nt|athene: yes 3nt was not a ridiculous bid, for sure|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sheila a: Better to come back to hand by ruffing a @s, although N can over-ruff|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  never works when I try it|pg||
nt|simonr: Sometimes it works and othertimes you are off in 3Nt with 6D! making!|pg||
nt|sheila a: Now can draw 3 more trump and play @d|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: one slight problem with bashing 3nt on that hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with some partners I play the Bourke relay|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes it does, you just forget when it works :)|pg||

nt|athene: i assumed NS bid 4@S over 4@H in the other room but they went there on their own|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@h is an artificial force|pg||
nt|athene: is that west might have four hearts but she will have four clubs less often|pg||
nt|ady: since you know from the bidding the opps have 9+ clubs  that is the likely lead evenif you dont tell them|pg||
nt|athene: so the heart stopper and club weakness is more of a bother than the other way round|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good point|pg||
nt|galadriel: Good result for Scotland|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: so that last one was points to ingham for not opening |pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Two chances here to open 11 counts - West gets in first|pg||
nt|athene: wow, that is a bad hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  21 was the expected small swing to Wales when East opened 1@s|pg||
nt|athene: one king, no aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  but a couple of 10s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she's young!  let her|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: good score for NS in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: having just gone down in a pushy 4@S, they respond by bidding another one on a 22 count next board|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and still a junior|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  and 3NT both make|pg||
nt|athene: i am not saying you should not open it, just that it's a bad hand :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: Not sure how wide-ranging the 2NT rebid is|pg||
nt|sheila a: Probably 15-19; Macdonald will be wondering if slam is on|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think it's 15-17|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzbj: de stresser litt for å rekke fly...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would not open|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: 7 eller 8 stikk i 1nt etter alle solemerker|pg||
nt|sheila a: In that case should sign off in 3NT with so little distribution|pg||
nt|galadriel: So she shouldn't get too excited|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  EW are consistent|pg||
nt|galadriel: A coffee hand :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|simonr: It is a style thing - if partner expects you to routinely open bad 11 counts then it is not a problem - but you need to be consistent|pg||
nt|yo_yo: briony youngs hoping they dont win the first 5 @H tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if the @cK is offside, 5@c is not making either|pg||
nt|sheila a: Greenwood reluctant to underlead her K@c into the strong hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|yorkbeach:  AQ109 well worth the upgrade|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  laydown without the @d lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on @s finesse now|pg||
nt|ady: this time if 3NT fails   then so foes 5@C|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|yorkbeach:  Brock-Gross have bid game on 9 out of the first 10 boards|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|baardolav: spørs om svindahl legger liten spar når det blir spilt... og det gjorde han...|pg||
nt|athene: yes but 3nt might fail a lot more|pg||

pc|c3|nt|galadriel: The local website for schedule and results :http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: draw trumps, cash hearts, play two rounds of clubs and hope for a ruff and discard|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  discipline from Woodruff|pg||
nt|athene: 5431 usually you try to open at the 1 level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they play Lucas as 5-5|pg||
nt|athene: if it's close|pg||
nt|simonr: hate these South hands - they are what strong club systems were made for!|pg||
nt|athene: because these are complex hands so you need room to investigate|pg||
nt|athene: but if you have to just jump shift of course you might run out of room anyway|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT     no easy ride|pg||

mb|3N!|nt|sharkey: Slemsonen her...|pg||
nt|athene: also you much prefer to open 1@C on a very strong hand than 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S can get passed out way too easily|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  prefer 1@s to 2NT if they are my only choices|pg||
nt|simonr: That just delays the problem to the rebid|pg||

nt|galadriel: high card raise in @H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|baardolav: ingen dårlig slem dette her?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Presumably limited|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 12 sammenligninger gjenstår - og 30 imp skal hentes inn... |pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know, the Lady Milne is an annual competition, all female.|pg||
nt|athene: i would open that 2@C but close|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT rebid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not everyone's 1@H overcall at adverse|pg||
nt|athene: it wasn't east's in the other room anyway|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no 2@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  why say the hand is balanced when it is not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Play looks straightforward|pg||

nt|sheila a: Careful, you'll end up wired|pg||

pc|cA|nt|sheila a: In case it's a singelton|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yorkbeach:  North is going to end up as declarer but unlucky|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they can investigate for a 5 card major|pg||
nt|simonr: Hate showing a game force in spades with such a poor suit. i would show this as balanced and hope to show the 5@S via 5-card stayman|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: Hvis Sven Olai cuer nå er de i slem|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yorkbeach:  might have anyway if North bid 2NT over 2@s|pg||
nt|athene: with a different 5431 i might pretend i was balanced but that one it doesn't look like a necessary distortion|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: I slem er @CK kanskje utspillet?|pg||
nt|sharkey: LR spilt av V...|pg||
nt|jbgood: og de har fått den på rett hånd hvis syd forsøker et kløverutspill|pg||
nt|athene: slightly tricky now on the entries front|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lead resolves the @c suit nicely but declarer still a trick short|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Best for brYony not to cover|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might think the @cK is offside and try a @d to the king|pg||
nt|athene: declarer doesn't know the @CK is right so might not use her dummy entry to repeat the club hook|pg||
nt|athene: yes, there are lots of options, not trivial to play|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|baardolav: Men vil vel gå bet... det er ingen vinnende variant enn å spille AK i hj to runder trumf og tre runder ruter, så innspill i kløver|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yorkbeach:  1@h would not have occured to me|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: you need a spade as entry to the diamonds but that means you can't untangle 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s + 2@h + 2@d + 2@c = 9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if E does not cash the @hK, time to set up @d|pg||
nt|athene: spade return now would be my guess|pg||
nt|athene: east has taken long enough now that she obviously hasn't got the @CA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is a first cap for West, Dinah Caplan, a rubber bridge player, i believe|pg||
nt|athene: with the @CA she would have cleared the hearts a long time ago|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  long pause is telling declarer who has the @cA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East would be playing @h if holding a sure entry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ahh  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  entries now to set up a @h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 2@H tricks now|pg||

nt|sheila a: which has entry problems|pg||

mb|1N|nt|baardolav: Meget god 5ruter fra lukket... veldig lett å komme i 3nt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you would expect that|pg||
nt|sheila a: Scores sorted now - 6-0 looks right|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Double first and then bid NTs at the lowest level to show this hand|pg||
nt|athene: you double and hope partner has the common courtesy to bid 1@S so you can bid 1nt rather than having to bid 2nt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not this time|pg||
nt|ady: again 3NT   or 5of a minor|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@d seems obvious|pg||
nt|simonr: South thinking about 1NT or 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: south considering 1nt?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  once you subtract a king, the hand is definietly not worth 3@d|pg||
nt|galadriel: Scotland's intrepid young South found the pre-empt|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  lead directing overcall :)|pg||
nt|athene: East is a regular Overcalls R Us 24/7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  assume that West is the one thinking|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though not clear why|pg||
nt|simonr: Ax could result in wrong siding 1NT so 2@D is prefered|pg||
nt|athene: south decides she can't have that much as she didn't overcall 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: likely to be 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 3@H usually preemptive...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sheila a: Burns-Greenwood play that a 2 over 1 response is game forcing|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||

nt|yo_yo: obviously not for the welsh NS|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South has a tough call|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s is better but the hand has a lot of losers|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might put up the @SQ confidently on a small spade lead and lose all faith in human nature :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT might make if declarer picks the clubs, as she might given the opening bid|pg||
nt|sheila a: In the other room they may not be able to stop so low|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: spade lead  holds to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here's the 9th trick assuming she ducks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  who is ducking and risking a @s switch?|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might rise ace, scared of a spade shift?|pg||
nt|ady: might go up with ace |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but if West has a @h honour, it will be tough for her to switch|pg||
nt|ady: would worry about a spade switch  beffore clubs are set up|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  remember North has made a TOD|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and E has shown 5+ @h|pg||
nt|athene: interesting though - if you think east would lead a spade from @SKQJ on this bidding, then she pretty much has to have both hearts for the opener|pg||

nt|galadriel: I understand you have to bid 1NT in the system, but I'd feel uncomfortable about not bidding that nice @C suit|pg||
nt|sheila a: The defence blissfully unaware of N's 6 card suit|pg||
nt|sheila a: Although this sequence normally shows some @c length|pg||
nt|pfbr: what would q@cs mean?|pg||
nt|galadriel: Give partner Qx and 3NT could be rolling home|pg||
pc|sT|nt|simonr: Going down now. Wrong minor to play on|pg||

nt|sheila a: Q asks for attitude so might have been from KQ|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: even if you put in the @S10 and then set up the diamond for a spade pitch, you still have to negotiate the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: so 11 tricks is a very good result for sure|pg||

pc|c4|nt|ady: this is no picknick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lack of entries to the @h is the main problem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: north must think she has entries|pg||
nt|athene: well this auction does have one advantage which is that west has no idea what to lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could be a big swing on this board|pg||

nt|athene: wow, NS in the other room scored 170|pg||
nt|athene: what went wrong!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: I think North will open this - not my style though|pg||
nt|sheila a: On board 10 Wiseman-Mcquaker got to 3NT. Going quite a few off, I think.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  club forces needed to stop 10 tricks|pg||
mb|1H|nt|simonr: Wrong - good job I did not do the lottery this week|pg||
nt|ady: diamond partial |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  horrible spade intermediates|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  excpet spades outrank diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: NS will end up in 3@S i expect?|pg||
nt|simonr: Doesn't always stop Laura though|pg||
nt|galadriel: This is a tricky hand for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  E switched to a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this board will go in their memoires: "2011: a good year on the whole, but i missed a vul game in april"|pg||
nt|sheila a: was it S who opened 1@h?|pg||
nt|galadriel: That may not be the auction :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: wow, no overcall|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  out of character for Brock-Gross to stop in a partial|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no stopping this NS|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: is that 3@H a one-round force or GF?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would not bid 3@h but I would bid on after 1@s-1NT-2@h-2@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you cannot be serious|pg||
nt|ady: still thinks spade pips bad|pg||
nt|simonr: She needs a nicotine fix!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: undo|pg||
pc|c8|nt|simonr: .|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  operator, we do not believe North's bidding|pg||
nt|athene: and she didn't double 1nt for the black suits either|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or rather lack of it|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she has given up dubious competitive actions for Lent|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sheila a: She was maybe a bit too strong in points to open that at the one level|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|yorkbeach:  time to switch even if East does not lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have a lot of aces|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what is 2@c?|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2-way checkback, forcing 2@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East does not appear to be worth a game try|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: so they have time to get a third club trick|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: now north is in the pre-balancing seat|pg||
nt|sheila a: Obviously didn't want to call it a balanced hand and open some form of 2NT equivalent|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: and surely must double 2@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: checkback - 7 loser hand  ?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C forces 2@D|pg||
nt|simonr: Checkback? They play two-way checkback|pg||
nt|athene: either to play or to make an invitational bid|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is not optimal when you are a passed hand facing a weak notrump rebid and hence can't really game force|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  England gained 11 on 15 when Godfrey played Lane|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of 4@S you tend to wander into, i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: as expected NS found a 5-4 spade fit in the other room and bid what larry would want them to bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  correction 4 boards|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but still a tall order in 18 minutes|pg||
nt|simonr: Three more - 30 - 32|pg||
nt|ady: rngland now a useful lead  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 29 the England NS competed to 3@s|pg||
nt|galadriel: They did very well to stay so low|pg||
nt|sheila a: partner's @s values were useless without an entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 5-4 spade fit and some hcp|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|yorkbeach:  EW bid a very aggressive 4@s at the other table|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  standard law of total tricks stuff |pg||
nt|galadriel: They have scored board 10 as Scotland making 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: 140 ser ut som en bra score for Bergen|pg||
nt|athene: they might stop out of it here though if west only makes a try|pg||
nt|ady: mis fit    wuill play 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Kennewell viewed not to open 1NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: It seemed the defence should have been able to defeat that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yorkbeach:  if it is not making even with the @cKJ onside, it is a poor contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  allowd Brock an easy 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is the only board the other room has not played|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT   a struggle|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think the auction is wrong here, no?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: fall of the @C10 is nice|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: 2NT forcing   after 2 level response|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer reads the suit|pg||
nt|simonr: 2/1 FG style so 2NT is forcing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kaye might consider a slam now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there ought to be a law that all English players should play Acol :)|pg||
nt|ady: might get a diamond lead in 3NT     then better|pg||
nt|simonr: ...and still drive in the slow lane!|pg||
nt|simonr: West must be thinking about a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  I realise I am a bit of hypocrite|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yorkbeach:  a difference in system results in a different declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  easy for South to lead the @dQ|pg||
nt|athene: a cautious view from west but of course playing a strong notrump, this sequence typically shows a weak notrump from opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: 2@c checkback, so that Greenwood can invite |pg||
nt|sheila a: I'd rather be in @s than NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: very wise|pg||
nt|simonr: Well judged by Kaye|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I have not played the defence to 1NT that my brother and I invented for a long time|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead  could be best    other  leads clould cost|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: You mean Cappaletti!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tough to find the @s lead unless South doubles|pg||
nt|yo_yo: landy?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes he has taken over the name :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 hearts and a spade should be easy enough i think|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|ady: heart back and then J@S  |pg||
nt|athene: sure, but you just rise ace and play clubs to keep north out|pg||
nt|sheila a: bidding this way guarantees 5@s|pg||
nt|galadriel: North implying a 5th @S by going through checkback|pg||
nt|galadriel: otherwise she could bid a direct 2NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: Greenwood will probably ruff a @d in dummy and consequently get @s wrong.|pg||
nt|galadriel: This should make|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|jbgood: sjelden rett å selge ut til 1 grand hvis du har en unnskyldning for å melde|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: kløver 6 er Lavinthal i avkast.. Jon tegner og forklarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North would probably have led a trump against 4@s too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this was not the moment for a count signal in @c|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sheila a: A@c onside means all well|pg||
nt|galadriel: Or - could make|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jbgood: tegningen er postlagt - forklaringen: Gjør hva du vil makker - jeg har alt du ikke har:)|pg||

nt|athene: would make 9 that way|pg||

nt|athene: just rely on the @CK onside|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  this is a 32 board match|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes|pg||

nt|athene: couldn't the @H109 be with the @CQ here?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|thedoc: what was result?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: was when the diamonds went 5-1 in 3NT    almost went down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes North made 3Nt despite blocking the clubs|pg||
nt|thedoc: ok thanks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: is this safe?|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT was made   not sure   10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: and north could have ducked that trick, killing the entry to the @HJ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  squeeze|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|ady: end play possible|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: simpler would have been to put the @CJ in on the second round of clubs|pg||
nt|ady: not nessaary|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the contract was safe anyway with what had been thrown already|pg||
nt|ady: might have been a squeeze   |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6 minutes for 2 boards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely a claim|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: what happened|pg||

nt|athene: acol for NS, 5-card majors strong notrump, short club for EW|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  very mysterious|pg||
nt|athene: i thought declarer might have played that off but only if north ducked the club|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  1NT and transfer expected|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: standard leads and signals for both pairs|pg||
nt|sheila a: I see no reason for West not to show a 2-suiter|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|athene: another way that difference in notrump range produces swings|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: east maybe intending to bid 3@S over 3red|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|sheila a: Macdonald seduced by the vulnerability into bidding one more|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  England made 90|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so this baord cannot be flat|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: that typically shows a strong but flexible hand these days rather than just a really big one-suiter|pg||
nt|simonr: Should make 140 if you find the @SJ so a small swing here to Wales|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|galadriel: perhaps EW have the agreement that Michaels is weak or strong|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: vanskelig å vinne imp her og for vertene, er vel bare teori som kan hindre Bergen å reise hjem med seier|pg||
nt|athene: club to ace, trump to king, trump?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might pitch a @s on the @d an avoid the @s guess|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|sheila a: shortage of entries means Grant has to play for trumps behaving |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: this will be tricky - in big danger of losing three trumps and a heart|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: could lose 3@H, 2@S and 1@C on a bad day|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|simonr: Then where does the @C go?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|galadriel: so with intermediate hands like this one, just have to overcall|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: i think the only winning line was to get some sort of endplay on south in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but that would mean cashing the top diamonds without playing a second round of trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good evening everyone|pg||
nt|athene: and of course you might then run into a ruff just on normal breaks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: so i think no reason to get this one right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from manchester|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|athene: sure, the pre-empt makes bad breaks more likely but you can't play for 4-1 trumps right from the start|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|athene: hi :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  do you treat the four 5@s as 4?|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  at the other table North did not lead her partner's suit|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: it might be slightly tricky for declarer to reach dummy twice for this spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: assuming we get a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: she might just finesse once then cash the ace|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: Og takk til tilskuere for interessante innspill - og tålmodighet:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gratulerer til Bergen - og lykke til videre|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't really want to spend half an hour ducking hearts for a heart ruff to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: that might incur diamond ruffs and all sorts|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok|pg||
nt|athene: well that makes life easy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@h is trick on a @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: it does work well to put the overcaller on lead, which is why many pairs play a lot of transfers after overcalls|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. 1@C (1@D) X is hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  correction - South did not overcall at the other table|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: right - that's why north didn't lead her suit :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: a reasonable lead, to be fair - on this auction you expect declarer to have three trumps and quite possibly a ruff in hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|simonr: Spade laed here would not be a success. We are all taught to laed partrner's suit!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  poor lead here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: partner why dont you lead my  xxxx suit|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ady: another swing for wales|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: not sure it's wise to finesse again|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is why you should not overcall on xxxxx|pg||
