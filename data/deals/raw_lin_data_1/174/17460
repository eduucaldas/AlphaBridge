nt|larrymori: the Bulgarians?|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes that's what I was told, Larry|pg||
nt|kareno: Making 3 would be a nice pickup for Bulgaria and certainly the play at trick 2 set it up nicely.|pg||

nt|chilloncan: that was my point|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@c will still make though i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: standard signals for NS     EW upside-down count/attitude  odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Courtney - "I  always wondered what you'd have if you passed throught Bobby, and know we know"|pg||
nt|mrdct: north needs to show a spade splinter and that might get south going|pg||
nt|chilloncan: y|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mrdct: the tapping defence in @h looks best double dummy|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there are double dummy lines to find a way to go down, but i would need massive odds to bet against declarer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: this way 4@S North instead of South :)  with some extra info for declarer that won't affect the play|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||

nt|kareno: 2@d only?  I wonder if their responses to takeout doubles are peculiar.|pg||

nt|sybarra: and we landed |pg||

pc|cJ|nt|kareno: I would say he will make 7 now.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h2|nt|mrdct: he has @d blocked if they are 4-1|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS CC says 1N overcall = 15+ to 18+|pg||
nt|ritong: so|pg||
nt|larrymori: 2nt is more understandable, you bid with less with the points known to be in openers hand |pg||
nt|ritong: can we tackle @cs from dummy?|pg||
nt|ritong: think no|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well that makes it a little less of a vul stretch for north|pg||
nt|kareno: No.  Has to hope for club queen to come.|pg||
nt|ritong: so, declarer has to hope for good news in @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: and thus, attack @ds while he has sure entry|pg||
nt|kareno: Only one pure dummy entry.|pg||
nt|larrymori: I think he has to play for the drop because otherwise there are only 8|pg||
nt|larrymori: after knocking out the @d|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Are there any results we can post?  People asking.|pg||
nt|ritong: he can add up to 9 without @cs, potentially|pg||
nt|ritong: making 2@h tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: but is a tempo short|pg||
nt|larrymori: but the spades are set up then|pg||
nt|kareno: Can't make it without clubs.|pg||
nt|larrymori: so knock out the ace of @d and drop the @cQ is the only way and lucky it is there|pg||
nt|ritong: it is a bit more complicated than that, in fact|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ritong: duck this|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||

pc|dA|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|mwigor: isnt it more than one down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes indeed|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: pretty conservative non-X by East|pg||

nt|mwigor: i doubt many will find 5@c though|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: no choice is perfect, no choice is awful|pg||
nt|mrdct: this looks 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: however   with 5@S 3@H  DBL isn't a good choice since weak advancer [partner of doubler] will bid 1@H with 3@H & 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't have Q1 result for  Hans-Brown   maybe Adam knows [his brother is member of Hans team]|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like a puppet to 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: wd by N....far from obvious to bid over 1N, as S did not say double so suboar chance of 44 hearts, and long suit is weak. but this was the time for aggression|pg||
nt|chilloncan: oh wait, sorry i thought they were going to 3N after 2C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: i'm told  Brown +2     [or Hans -2]|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Brown up 2 imps|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c may well be a puppet to 2@d to establish this sign-off in 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if N was not planning to invite 3N, which as i said was pushy, i dont really warm up to aiming at a final contract of 3C|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|kareno: Not enough compensation for their vulnerable game.  Of course 4@h can be beaten but will it?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: why not just pass 1N?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: but EW could easily be going down in 5@s or 5@h in the other room so might be good for the chinese/dutch combination|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mwigor: of course -800 would not have been a good score for NS|pg||

nt|ritong: but i do not clearly get why they avoided twice 1NT opening w 15|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|larrymori: Polish 1C would be weak 1NT when rebidding it but he had 15|pg||

nt|ritong: and the @hs do not behave, sort of  he would prefer H98 somewhere|pg||
nt|ritong: still possible|pg||
nt|ritong: from south, a @d shift is awkward, so rumen is still hoping something good happens|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kareno: For those who watched the last round, just for the record. Board one of previous match was subect to an appeal. Hence China won 19-11 not blitz.|pg||

nt|mwigor: 6@h is an ok contract - and makes on this layout|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure if he was going to that, bid NT or conventionally show @C support|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: after 3@C -- will Klinger push to 3@H?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: specs might factor that into some of the auctions we'll see|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: and the optimal contract is reached|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|mrdct: nowhere to dump all of the @d losers|pg||

nt|chilloncan: N might have to decide whether S has Q of diamonds or T of hearts|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @CJ promises Q|pg||

nt|ritong: if south is to be trusted on the count|pg||
nt|kareno: But any little information changes that.|pg||
nt|larrymori: it favors the drop when another low comes too, half the 31s are gone|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 4+@S   approximately 13 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C is only a 1-round force|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrdct: a trump lead will beat 6@h here i think|pg||
nt|kareno: Transfer by north.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in fact i don't think it promises a rebid over 2@S -- but don't quote me on that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Mullamphy would be able to transfer to @H  -- guess not|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: XX probably a run from Peter, so he chooses to pass|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: Gill's problem tough here   transfer responses not requiring any points, but not forbidding them either :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL and 2N seem the front runners   hard to imagine PASS, but that would work out fine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Richman in 2N North|pg||
nt|kareno: I doubt they'll get that high|pg||
nt|mrdct: need to get @d right here to make|pg||
nt|mrdct: and sometime one might play north for a @d shortage with the long @c suit so not a guarantee to make this|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: Griffiths in South overcalled 1@C with 1@D  -- how did they stop in 2N???|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h the normal contract|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugrapha4: With no convinient cue available Courtney bids a simple 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: can we survive a non@c lead?|pg||
nt|kareno: Club lead called.|pg||
nt|ritong: don t think so|pg||
nt|kareno: No, it's a silly slam and will get what it deserves.|pg||
nt|kareno: North thinking south would not recue spades without a club control.|pg||
nt|ritong: duly so imho|pg||
nt|larrymori: he has to play the J@c from dummy early and get rho to pitch enough @ds, finesse and set up the @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless it makes -- then silly slam that DOESN'T get what it deserves|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: Now we'll see.|pg||
nt|kareno: He needs KJT tight of diamonds on his left.|pg||
nt|ritong: close|pg||
nt|larrymori: kj or k10 tight and hook rho|pg||
nt|ritong: but anyone claiming bad luck on that one gets fears and tar:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or KJ/KT then guess to take ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|kareno: Unnervingly close :)  East needs to cling to diamonds.|pg||
nt|ritong: feathers|pg||

nt|ritong: you need a miracle, try for it|pg||

pc|cK|nt|andy_h: Gosney would like to pass the 1@H but 18-19NT with 3 hearts would also bid 1@H so he's constrained to bid 1NT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: perhaps just a little bit cautious|pg||
nt|andy_h: I suspect that 2@C or 2@D by Gosney would be artificial (aka xyz)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS use 2@H opening as weak 4+@H & 4+@S  many Pacific/Asia pairs play it as 5+@H & 4+@C/@D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kareno: 6@d is very good.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H must be any 19+ hcp|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kareno: Kokishish|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ritong: now, even a natural system has a reasonable chance, assuming it starts pass 1@d 2@h  fitjump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they also use 1@C-1@D/2@H as Game Force with any 1-suit or 4441|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ritong: if so, south has a monster|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was ostensibly 19-20 balanced|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: seems weird that North didn't have a descriptive bid over the artificial 1@H |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|kareno: I think south dogged it with that 5@d bid |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Ish gaine an imp bless him|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|athene: so i guess it would be going down in practice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 3+  but still transfer responses|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not many boards are left, time's running out for the Brown team. A 14imp was swung on board 19 where the failing grand (due to 4-1 break) was not bid in the other room|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: also a good lead by Gosney on 17 defeated a game for 12 more|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: good start for a final set for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d for NS here|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D doesn't inconvenience the opening side|pg||
nt|bg: maybe 6|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah could be|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: south needs a raise to do that|pg||
nt|athene: but there we are :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: with the @HA with the singleton @d, the defence can only lead trumps once|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mrdct: 2@h is about the limit for NS here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h looks like a splinter agreeing @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@c - anyone know what this is?  Better than 1nt?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hods allow quasi-2N hands to peter out in playable spots|pg||
nt|mrdct: although the @d position is quite favourable|pg||
nt|kareno: Good screech to a stop!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay it shows 18-19 balanced, thanks.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm alway a bit nervous about splintering with a stiff king|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he has a choice in trumps, whether to lead the @DJ to pin the ten|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like 9 tricks i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry start of my message was deleted by gremlins:  flexible methods allow....|pg||
nt|mrdct: draw trumps finishing in dummy and take @d hook|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to get to this spot by many methods|pg||
nt|kareno: Note that with JTx of trumps, it is correct to lead small in case partner has queen or king.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds friendly!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: friendly but not passionate. if 8 and 7 interposed, then passionate|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: e.g. @SQ K A, diamond to queen|pg||
nt|mrdct: and even more nervous splintering in a suit shown by partner|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|andy_h: 4@S looks to be the limit here, unless declarer takes a view on the clubs|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a very aggressive double of 3@D by Gosney|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: too true! Still, if he passed, West would X himself|pg||
nt|andy_h: Certainly a nice partner to provide him with four keycards!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: west may drop the @D8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: can probably surmise exact suit distribution though|pg||
nt|athene: trying to look like a man with @D108 doubleton|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bg: signals crossed here so much for fancy bids|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the question being   is West  5332 or 5422|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he went wrong right away|pg||
nt|mrdct: and i assume 3@d showed a red 2-suiter|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|athene: perhaps he hoped for the added advantage that east might not cover with @DKx|pg||
nt|athene: he will put south with five diamonds at least for the overcall|pg||
nt|athene: so he won't think his partner could have @D10xx|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|mrdct: the general rule i have in most of my partnerships is that you can never splinter in a suit partner has shown|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|andy_h: Yeap had he passed then the same contract would be reached, although probably played by Gosney|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: could take the @D8 too on a trump promo now if they wanted|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 tricks will double Lavazza's imp total|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d might be difficult to bid - so making 4@h here might square the board|pg||
nt|bg: good place for the    ASBAF system  "All Strange Bids Are Forcing"|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mrdct: and 10 tricks will treble it!|pg||
nt|kareno: And that can be made.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: it wouldn't matter though; the club loser would go away|pg||
nt|athene: it's just one down whatever route you take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room   8 [where we wondered about Courtney's 2@S opener]    DeLivera opened 2@H showing weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|andy_h: So I guess in a way he was generous enough to let partner play|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: richman just better make sure he doesn't get himself endplayed|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: and arrive in 6@H|pg||
nt|athene: ah, but the other way up|pg||
nt|athene: now a club lead looks killing|pg||
nt|athene: through the @CAQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mrdct: and he can score the beer card now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrdct: no - blew it|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: I'll say goodnight after this hand - tomorrow's a work day for me... sigh.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the match-ups for round 3 would have been worked out during this match [i think always 1-off]  but i haven't checked and don't know who will be on vugraph either way|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|kareno: n/s seem to have had crossed wires about the double of 2@d.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well if we don't understand 2@D  why should NS?|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d seems to be some spade raise - was it Alerted?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: best guess   a [very light]  2-way Drury promising 4+@S|pg||
nt|kareno: WAY too light for any Drury.|pg||
nt|larrymori: maybe it was a bad mixed raise|pg||
nt|larrymori: meaning no distro|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so we're back to ... why should NS have a clue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for as inelegant as the auction/contract   North can win imps by finding ONLY 9 tricks|pg||
nt|larrymori: south did not want to bid a 3 card suit and then knew north had 5 hearts and mostly likely 55 so he went|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|larrymori: why? the double means a push with 9|pg||

nt|kareno: Now sluff-ruffs should beat it.|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|larrymori: he should have led the 10 to retain the lead to lead another I think|pg||
nt|kareno: Now he should have it with heart finesse and diamond entry to pull trumps|pg||
nt|larrymori: then A@c could have pushed another one|pg||
nt|larrymori: if east knew what he wanted to do, he should not let pard go wrong|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but the opening bid was 2@H North|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: that's what i mean - once you know north will be playing it, i think that tips it against bidding it|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that's what I meant, Dave.|pg||
nt|frankaus: last now -  its a educational  to see that the best of teams can have a big loss - tu all for your company|pg||
nt|chilloncan: np shirley, sometimes the earth moves:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: unusual to make a game with the minority of the trumps|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: thru 9 boards in Women's Final 2nd Quarter    Bilski 54  Clark 13|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|athene: heavy 1nt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no excitement here either|pg||
nt|mrdct: @h partial for NS here - don't think game will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: people often push the upper limit for 1nt overcall over 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: over 1@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-8 HCP, @H or @S  --  no strong options|pg||
nt|mrdct: might collect a few hundreds in 3@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: or 500 in 3@sx|pg||
nt|mrdct: will south pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the reason is they don't want to double and have to rebid 2nt facing a possible zero|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: but you can easily miss games doing this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically 1N was 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: courtney might try 3nt now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C weak  weak 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: why?   Burgess has only confirmed 13 cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: helpful lead still a lot of work for Ish hope his brain still aware after all that thinking earlier|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he is alert and focussed we are told :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we welcome Ian McCance |pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great to have you Ian|pg||
nt|andy_h: Nice 5@H bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: nef X by W perhas describable as...optional|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but that would be a bit wild since south can't have much to pass 2@H and will usually have a lot less than he has|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Bobby gave X a couple seconds of thought|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @d now and if he ducks the roof could fall in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes @C's are ominous|pg||
nt|mrdct: might need to guess @d right here to make so a chance for lavazza|pg||
nt|frankaus: running scores all matches at - http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=1&tourid=902|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: finally  a long @C suit is running|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS turning a plus score into a minus score|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: do you think South is in lebensohl situation where 3@D showed some values?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if south happens to have nothing, 3nt is getting doubled and so is 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think 2N is scramble rather than lebensohl|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andy_h: Although declarer still has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|andy_h: If trumps are 3-1, provided that the defenders duck a round of clubs, there is no entry to dummy to enjoy the clubs|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: you might argue that with some values, south must do something over 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: unless he has a penalty pass of course, but he hasn't got that|pg||
nt|athene: so when he passes and then pulls the double, he is showing a pretty weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: of course there will be times when you would like leb to be on in these situations|pg||
nt|athene: but i think in general it's better to play 2nt as scramble|pg||
nt|mrdct: @SJ here to show the @HK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andy_h: However, given that West holds the singleton queen of trumps, a good guess in clubs would see the contract for one off. If Gosney ducks the first round of trumps, declarer will ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: then be able to ruff his two little spades. If Gosney takes it with the Ace and returns a trump, declarer then guess the clubs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|braunstar: Hey all|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: disaster avoided|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hey Daniel|pg||
nt|braunstar: It seems Hans have built a nice lead into this last set|pg||
nt|braunstar: Does anyone know the results of the other match?|pg||
nt|mrdct: once north shows up with the @sA, the odds might favour south holding the other missing ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sometimes it DOESN'T??|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with 10 LTC and bad spades, W can pass... no game unless E can act  at almost any subgame level, in which case W wll have all values in reserve and can do the needful|pg||
nt|kareno: Still a vulnerable overcall ..|pg||
nt|mrdct: but when north turns up with the @sA, what has south got for his vul 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: gmta Dave|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: Ish taking his 6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, one of the seldom acknowledged -- at ;east by the busy bidders -- disadvantages of the busy-bid style, is that declarer can then all too often place all cards early, ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ESPECIALLY if the overcall is raised. and if it hurts your side to have your overcall raised, maybe it isnt the best idea |pg||
nt|kareno: Well done for the push|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: does Mullamphy EVER claim?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was 105-59 to Courtney|pg||
nt|mrdct: good @d play by south to put declarer to the guess before he has discovery of the @SA and @HQ|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to see they might reach 3n on this hand in the other room though|pg||
nt|athene: east must duck the second diamond to kill the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  West's 3rd seat opener is not automatic by any means|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: N&S both have winners|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: even if west does open, north might double then bid notrumps|pg||
