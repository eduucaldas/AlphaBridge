nt|jcomyn: a rarity - 26pts and no bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think now you ask for a few undos and bid 1N on the first round |pg||
nt|greerm: and there it will rest I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: what is 2h anyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h will be a double negative|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

pc|s4|nt|paulg:  well, i think she does have a double negative, perhaps a triple negative|pg||
nt|lark20: 2@H is "less than a Q"|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcomyn: hornswoggled|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: but surely 1nt by s on this auction is hardly balanced 16- hcp|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway i am not defending 1s|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will eventually play ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens this seems to be one of those times when partner does have eight tricks in notrump|pg||
nt|golfsquash: She will lose 4 trumps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and you end up in a very shaky contract - to put it mildly|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Uh-oh.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|baldfriede: This can go down 4 now with @d continuation.|pg||
nt|greerm: not always obvious to draw trump with such poor holdings but,|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|paulg:  once she has finished trying to reconstruct NS hands that fit the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: not that she cares too much...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lark20: Difficult for S to find a bid with such a flat hand and 3 suits bid by opponents|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and will go down|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|vugraphzbb: sry...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg:  i think South has to double 1@s|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats my view also|pg||
nt|baldfriede: The problem was that West was in the lead, and drawing trumps from Kx does not look too good.|pg||
nt|greerm: setting up a cross ruff for the defence|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|cJ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c3|nt|greerm: south knows where the @C Q is?|pg||

nt|greerm: if so, can ruff high now and another @S|pg||

nt|lark20: At last game points for East/West.|pg||
nt|paulg:  a chance for EW with some points ... of course a misfit|pg||
nt|greerm: you say 2 guarantees an honour Simon?|pg||
nt|simonr: Lucky make for Wales who are slowly accumilating IMPs|pg||
nt|greerm: which is common|pg||
nt|simonr: With XXX I assume they play top or MUD|pg||

nt|paulg:  of course 3@h sounds like a 6-card suit|pg||

nt|paulg:  then she would not feel obliged to bid over 3@s|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|greerm: Sandie shows her second suit, presuming the 3@H dbl requested that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: a very experienced scottish pair against the irish playing only 2nd time, but anna has been having a greast season at home|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  in the other matches, Northern Ireland are leading NIBU (NI  2) by 10 imps and England lead Wales by 19 imps|pg||
nt|greerm: tempting now for Laura|pg||
nt|simonr: The double may just have shown @hs|pg||
nt|greerm: and the 4@C showed the extars we discussed earlier|pg||
nt|greerm: with @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: well done to pass|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|greerm: can she make this with the friendly @D layout?|pg||
nt|greerm: every card right actually|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@S would have been a cheap save vul against non if you could avoid two diamond losers - which is unlikely|pg||
nt|greerm: right for declarer that is|pg||
nt|simonr: Not sure why Wales went 2 off in the other room?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|paulg:  Although Punch and McGowan are very experienced players, this is their first major event together|pg||
nt|jcomyn: she has won two of the major pairs titles|pg||
nt|jcomyn: setting down an early marker by mary lindopp|pg||
nt|lark20: This is Punch and McGowans first Lady Milne playing together|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: some thought from Punch ...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|greerm: might disc 2@D on the @S|pg||
nt|greerm: yes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: 5-2 fits are popular around here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: state of the match i daresay|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  Punch probably wondering whether to redouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that helps a little|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|greerm: didn't realise that the @D so good|pg||
nt|simonr: Going down now - need to ruff the opening lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzbb: I don't think so :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: knowing s may have 3 spade tricks what do you do|pg||
nt|paulg:  there are lots of variables in the Lady Milne and trying to compute the 'state of the match' is never easy|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  might be tempted to lead a small spade here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|paulg:  Hope that it is the same in the other room|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|simonr: Still 6 IMPs to NIBU|pg||
nt|greerm: always difficult to read that every card lies right|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c2|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  we can see that there are some winning lines, but likely to lead a spade to the queen|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
mc|9|nt|jcomyn: good job no spade honour in w hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: for ireland that is|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW a little unlucky, in that they have found a fair contract ... if you had jumped to 4@h as West it would be worse but escape the double|pg||
nt|jcomyn: fair - i think it a super contract but.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: last chance saloon and she blew it|pg||
nt|paulg:  but can still make this by finessing the spade on the way back|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|roswolf: west will break the transfer?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|iain sime: Yes, slam will make on a club lead, but you don't want to be bidding these.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: certainly not at the start of the event|pg||
nt|iain sime: Good discipline by East.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|iain sime: I assume West is playing 4@S and we cannot get the play as the bidding has north playing it. My guess is about 11 tricks.|pg||

nt|paulg:  she did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats not like liz|pg||
nt|paulg:  having played the @s10 I'm very surprised she did not make it|pg||
nt|paulg:  We are on the last board of this match. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Stephen Peterkin, for an excellent job.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, Rory Timlin, John Comyn and Beryl Campbell, for their peceptive comments and to all the kibitzers for the assistance.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Finally, our appreciation to Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and NIBU (Robin Burns) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|paulg:  We start again tomorrow at 10:00 Belfast (11:00 Paris, 04:00 New York, 10:00 Berwick-upon-Tweed).|pg||
nt|jcomyn: some very interesting hands. As we often say it is easy when u see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  actually it is 05:00 in New York, apologies for that|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Last chance for a slam now. Will we have it?|pg||
nt|greerm: nope|pg||
nt|greerm: though maybe |pg||
nt|baldfriede: Would be one with Q@c onside though.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|simonr: ...and teh @D behaving!|pg||
nt|greerm: or a @C lead from North :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  From a Scottish perspective, a very assured debut for Yvonne Wiseman|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  She'll really be looking forward to the rest of the weekend now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: multi 2d|pg||
nt|greerm: this the last hand here, thanks all, next round starts at 12.10 Norther Ireland time|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@S by North in the other room!!!! I think not. This will mess up the IMP scores|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|greerm: London follow us btw :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: simple 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Strange dealing machines, with 32 boards yesterday and 16 today without a slam.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|simonr: Saving them all to the last match tomorrow!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: yes but we expected a bit more from a very experienced pair here weho made some unchraacteristic errorsd|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|vugraphzbb: oops...sry|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lark20: Should be the same in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  small heart lead and diamond switch would be inspired against 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  this probably needs a diamond switch too when North gets with the @hK|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: K|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|paulg:  just going to play for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but costs nothing to play k and finesse in s|pg||
