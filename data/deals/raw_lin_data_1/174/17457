nt|bg: anyone for 3nt by west?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i can't see a lead to beat 5@D - am i missing something?|pg||
nt|larrymori: club|pg||
nt|bg: 5 dia makes so does 5 spades|pg||
nt|larrymori: but 5@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx |pg||
nt|pbundy: oh yes; ace and another.  very likely - but - absolutely correct, larry|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pbundy: yes; 6@D a great save :) - even with the ace of clubs lead|pg||
mb|4C|nt|larrymori: 5@c down 5@d makes but tough to beat, I would rather play the hand|pg||
nt|larrymori: now 4nt|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|bg: that cue should get the ruff to beat 5dia if they do not bid 5 spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|larrymori: although rkc was a consideration instead of 4@c but it was a 9 count opener|pg||
nt|pbundy: hard to imagine sementa passing at this stage|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: team rosters online at  http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/entries.aspx|pg||
nt|larrymori: 4nt first seemed indicative, now pard might be confused by the 4@h bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|bg: I wpould have bid 4 hearts on North hand show some shape too risky here to let opps play 5 in a minor|pg||
nt|larrymori: no votes for 4NT?|pg||
nt|pbundy: over 4@C, larry?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|larrymori: over 3nt|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes - i like that.  take up more of their room|pg||

nt|larrymori: yes over 4@c for sure|pg||
mb|6C|mb|d|nt|bg: 4nt by N then five dia or 5 clubs puts pressure on S they may get to 6 spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pbundy: jack is looking at virtually no defense :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: but - he passes anyway|pg||
nt|larrymori: the reason N did not go for 4nt is that he had a 9 count, with A@h instead of the queen it seems clear|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kareno: So... e/w can compete but how high?  |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mrdct: ew could quyite easily make 5 of a minor here|pg||

mb|3N!|mb|4S|nt|mrdct: west showing his minor 2-suiter|pg||
nt|kareno: 5 of a minor will likely make e/w but n/s have a huge spade fit so they will likely not sell at that level.|pg||
nt|frankaus: $US 100,000 to winners !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d by east is best to minimise the chance of a @c ruff|pg||

nt|sybarra: very pretigious event each year |pg||
nt|mrdct: east telling partner he has equal length in the minors|pg||
nt|kareno: West likely will bid clubs - then we'll see what north does.  Exciting from the get go!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: meanwhile NS are cold for 5@s|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kareno: And that he wants to compete :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugrapha4: Not the real auction, but i got here too late|pg||
nt|frankaus: team members ay - http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/entries.aspx|pg||
nt|kareno: South's double doesn't make sense to me - he doesn't want to defend.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: but 6 of a minor still a good save|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both of our pairs using transfer responses over 1@C  and as we see here -- in competition|pg||
nt|kareno: When you save over the five-level you have to be RIGHT.  If they cannot make 5 you are wrong and if they can make six and bid it, you are wrong.|pg||
nt|kareno: You need mirrors to defeat 5@c|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes its right to take out insurance enen if ur -1 in both directions|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: And actually if west ducks the improbable heart lead, it will make too.|pg||
nt|mrdct: it would be a bad start to the match to defend 5@cx making when you are cold for 5@s yourself|pg||
nt|frankaus: exciting hand to get us on the way|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@d - anyone know what that is?|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a limit raise of @s with no shortages|pg||
nt|frankaus: duessing  - good @S raise|pg||
nt|frankaus: guessing|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm hearing limit, no short suit ... and Bergen.|pg||
nt|kareno: In any event, Bocchi's sniffer is working hard!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: CC from 2010 Euro is  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is he bids one more....your guess?|pg||
nt|frankaus: bochhi's hand hast little defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: He's all offense and no defense!|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|mrdct: easy make on the @s lead|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: np Andrew welcome all|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not mad about his pass particularly if south's first bid showed as many as four spades with invitation.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugrapha4: Hi Gary, I'll check when I can|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude    Klinger-Mullamphy odd/even 1st discard|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||

nt|mrdct: 2@c is a transfer to 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Richman-Griffiths playing previous board in 5@C|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h6|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: the Open Semi-Final and Women's Final are 64 boards matches split into 4 16-board segments|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this is 2nd  16-board set in the 64 board Semi-Final   Women are playing the same boards in their Final match|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: 4 card openings for Burgess-Courtney, strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Peter Gill was to opening the South hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Burgess-Courtney playing  "4 Card Standard"|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: just about make 7@d here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Looks like 6@d will fetch here but hard to get there after opening bid by west.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mrdct: it was a mere overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart lead would put paid to 7|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: Griffiths-Richman 2/1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: standard signals for NS     EW upside-down count/attitude  odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Courtney - "I  always wondered what you'd have if you passed throught Bobby, and know we know"|pg||
nt|mrdct: north needs to show a spade splinter and that might get south going|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this way 4@S North instead of South :)  with some extra info for declarer that won't affect the play|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm sure NS would be more than happy to reach 6@d|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: duh   of course Dyke rebid 2@H|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d only?  I wonder if their responses to takeout doubles are peculiar.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|vugrapha4: now*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: an anomaly :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: well on the way to 6@D now|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Better :)|pg||

mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thanks Adam|pg||

nt|kareno: Oh, I somehow thought west had opened - silly me :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we landed |pg||
nt|kareno: Well done. 7 depends on a finesse - sort of silly to bid that much.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kareno: I would say he will make 7 now.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we got to see Adam as last minute substitute player yesterday in a pickup partnership|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|pbundy: right or wrong, i'm in for 4NT|pg||
nt|ritong: tactical considerations rule in this position|pg||
mb|4N|nt|larrymori: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: about 4@h opening with 4@s|pg||
nt|bg: diabolical hands|pg||
nt|pbundy: those hearts make it look like 8-4 :)|pg||
nt|ritong: and after all, if pard has @ss they ll be useful in @h contract as well|pg||
nt|larrymori: the hand is about @hs so bidding what he thinks he can make is to the point|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|pbundy: theoretically, 4@H can be beat - but - all moot as most would bid with south's hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bg: If South opens wrong ace 6 hearts makes|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so  the risk is too important to suffer a double game swing|pg||
nt|pbundy: yep|pg||
nt|larrymori: west might have doubled too|pg||
nt|pbundy: you are absolutely correct, bruce!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally  at 5-level lead King from AK  to get count  --  maybe Sementa led AK to hint at @D ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure why|pg||
nt|ritong: is he sure to beat 7@c?|pg||
nt|larrymori: not sure for sure|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would be fearful of doubling......  N does not have to have 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d2|pc|s8|nt|pbundy: could duboin be worried that north has AQJ??? of spades?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|larrymori: south does not have to open an ace too|pg||
nt|ritong: can perfectly be|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room West DBL 4N -- but not the final 5@C|pg||

mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: Neills 3@S shuts them all out esp pard|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mrdct: more 5-level action|pg||
nt|frankaus: dealer has provided interesting hands so fay|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Lot of bidding from both Courtney and Burgo on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: four -  not SIX|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Not liking the chance of this contract all too much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north's choice:   DBL vs 1@H vs [i guess] PASS   you choose|pg||
nt|kareno: All the action we could possible want :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: plus the ruffs|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|mwigor: isnt it more than one down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes indeed|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: pretty conservative non-X by East|pg||
nt|mwigor: it is worth noting that 5@c makes EW - so in theory this is a good result for NS|pg||
nt|mwigor: i doubt many will find 5@c though|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: no choice is perfect, no choice is awful|pg||
nt|mrdct: this looks 2 off|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: however   with 5@S 3@H  DBL isn't a good choice since weak advancer [partner of doubler] will bid 1@H with 3@H & 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't have Q1 result for  Hans-Brown   maybe Adam knows [his brother is member of Hans team]|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: i'm told  Brown +2     [or Hans -2]|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Brown up 2 imps|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: Not enough compensation for their vulnerable game.  Of course 4@h can be beaten but will it?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sK|nt|mrdct: but EW could easily be going down in 5@s or 5@h in the other room so might be good for the chinese/dutch combination|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mwigor: of course -800 would not have been a good score for NS|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: that's after 16 of 48 boards|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 64 is it not?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy -- i changed my mind about   with 48 to play versus  16 of 64 :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would be very confident that no table in the field will play this board at the 4-level|pg||
nt|kareno: So a quiet down two.|pg||

mb|2H|nt|athene: south needs a raise to do that|pg||
nt|athene: but there we are :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@h is about the limit for NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@c - anyone know what this is?  Better than 1nt?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hods allow quasi-2N hands to peter out in playable spots|pg||
nt|mrdct: although the @d position is quite favourable|pg||
nt|kareno: Good screech to a stop!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay it shows 18-19 balanced, thanks.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: he has a choice in trumps, whether to lead the @DJ to pin the ten|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like 9 tricks i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry start of my message was deleted by gremlins:  flexible methods allow....|pg||
nt|mrdct: draw trumps finishing in dummy and take @d hook|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to get to this spot by many methods|pg||
nt|kareno: Note that with JTx of trumps, it is correct to lead small in case partner has queen or king.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds friendly!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: friendly but not passionate. if 8 and 7 interposed, then passionate|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: e.g. @SQ K A, diamond to queen|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@S looks to be the limit here, unless declarer takes a view on the clubs|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a very aggressive double of 3@D by Gosney|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: too true! Still, if he passed, West would X himself|pg||
nt|andy_h: Certainly a nice partner to provide him with four keycards!|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|athene: west may drop the @D8|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can probably surmise exact suit distribution though|pg||
nt|athene: trying to look like a man with @D108 doubleton|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: the question being   is West  5332 or 5422|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he went wrong right away|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he hoped for the added advantage that east might not cover with @DKx|pg||
nt|athene: he will put south with five diamonds at least for the overcall|pg||
nt|athene: so he won't think his partner could have @D10xx|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|andy_h: Yeap had he passed then the same contract would be reached, although probably played by Gosney|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|athene: could take the @D8 too on a trump promo now if they wanted|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 tricks will double Lavazza's imp total|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mrdct: and 10 tricks will treble it!|pg||
nt|kareno: And that can be made.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|h8|nt|athene: it wouldn't matter though; the club loser would go away|pg||
nt|athene: it's just one down whatever route you take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room   8 [where we wondered about Courtney's 2@S opener]    DeLivera opened 2@H showing weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|andy_h: So I guess in a way he was generous enough to let partner play|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: richman just better make sure he doesn't get himself endplayed|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and arrive in 6@H|pg||
nt|athene: ah, but the other way up|pg||
nt|athene: now a club lead looks killing|pg||
nt|athene: through the @CAQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|kareno: Safe?|pg||
nt|mrdct: he wishes he drew that last trump earlier|pg||
nt|chilloncan: marathon man?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: GORGEOUSO!|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: definitely 6@H from south is better|pg||
nt|mrdct: now there is a slight risk of @d finesse losing and west getting a @d ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|pbundy: oh - he has something else up his sleeve|pg||
nt|pbundy: is that multi or-the-big-hand or just the big hand?|pg||

nt|pbundy: will he or won't he?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ritong: so, what kind of information can he obtain before guessing @ds?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|h2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|pbundy: he'll know about N having at least the spade ace and one heart honor........ obviously.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pbundy: of course, n could have a pretty decent hand and would not be in the auction|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: but the opening bid was 2@H North|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: that's what i mean - once you know north will be playing it, i think that tips it against bidding it|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that's what I meant, Dave.|pg||
nt|frankaus: last now -  its a educational  to see that the best of teams can have a big loss - tu all for your company|pg||
nt|chilloncan: np shirley, sometimes the earth moves:)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: thru 9 boards in Women's Final 2nd Quarter    Bilski 54  Clark 13|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|athene: heavy 1nt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no excitement here either|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: people often push the upper limit for 1nt overcall over 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: over 1@S|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-8 HCP, @H or @S  --  no strong options|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: the reason is they don't want to double and have to rebid 2nt facing a possible zero|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but you can easily miss games doing this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically 1N was 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: courtney might try 3nt now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C weak  weak 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: why?   Burgess has only confirmed 13 cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: helpful lead still a lot of work for Ish hope his brain still aware after all that thinking earlier|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he is alert and focussed we are told :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we welcome Ian McCance |pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great to have you Ian|pg||
nt|andy_h: Nice 5@H bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: nef X by W perhas describable as...optional|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: but that would be a bit wild since south can't have much to pass 2@H and will usually have a lot less than he has|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Bobby gave X a couple seconds of thought|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @d now and if he ducks the roof could fall in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes @C's are ominous|pg||
nt|mrdct: might need to guess @d right here to make so a chance for lavazza|pg||
nt|frankaus: running scores all matches at - http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=1&tourid=902|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: finally  a long @C suit is running|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: do you think South is in lebensohl situation where 3@D showed some values?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if south happens to have nothing, 3nt is getting doubled and so is 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think 2N is scramble rather than lebensohl|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|andy_h: Although declarer still has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|andy_h: If trumps are 3-1, provided that the defenders duck a round of clubs, there is no entry to dummy to enjoy the clubs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: you might argue that with some values, south must do something over 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: unless he has a penalty pass of course, but he hasn't got that|pg||
nt|athene: so when he passes and then pulls the double, he is showing a pretty weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: of course there will be times when you would like leb to be on in these situations|pg||
nt|athene: but i think in general it's better to play 2nt as scramble|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andy_h: However, given that West holds the singleton queen of trumps, a good guess in clubs would see the contract for one off. If Gosney ducks the first round of trumps, declarer will ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: then be able to ruff his two little spades. If Gosney takes it with the Ace and returns a trump, declarer then guess the clubs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|braunstar: Hey all|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: disaster avoided|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hey Daniel|pg||
nt|braunstar: It seems Hans have built a nice lead into this last set|pg||
nt|braunstar: Does anyone know the results of the other match?|pg||
nt|mrdct: once north shows up with the @sA, the odds might favour south holding the other missing ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sometimes it DOESN'T??|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with 10 LTC and bad spades, W can pass... no game unless E can act  at almost any subgame level, in which case W wll have all values in reserve and can do the needful|pg||
nt|kareno: Still a vulnerable overcall ..|pg||
nt|mrdct: but when north turns up with the @sA, what has south got for his vul 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: gmta Dave|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankaus: the presire card found|pg||
nt|frankaus: presure|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: Ish taking his 6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, one of the seldom acknowledged -- at ;east by the busy bidders -- disadvantages of the busy-bid style, is that declarer can then all too often place all cards early, ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ESPECIALLY if the overcall is raised. and if it hurts your side to have your overcall raised, maybe it isnt the best idea |pg||
nt|kareno: Well done for the push|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does Mullamphy EVER claim?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was 105-59 to Courtney|pg||
nt|mrdct: good @d play by south to put declarer to the guess before he has discovery of the @SA and @HQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: it's easy to see they might reach 3n on this hand in the other room though|pg||
nt|athene: east must duck the second diamond to kill the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  West's 3rd seat opener is not automatic by any means|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N&S both have winners|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: even if west does open, north might double then bid notrumps|pg||
mc|10|nt|frankaus: bye all|pg||
nt|chilloncan: incidentally, my comments are not critiques from the other side, i am a very bisy bidder and am acknowledging the downside of that policy|pg||
nt|ritong: BACK IN 15 MINUTES OR SO|pg||
nt|ritong: oops|pg||
