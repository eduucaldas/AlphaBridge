nt|athene: 3@S asking for minors i assume|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sensible as the 4-4 fit might well produce an extra trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2 of those 5 are partscores that could easily have been in game, so it's not clear they are pluses for the IMPs |pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: playing 4 card majors, I think I'd find a 1@S bid with S's hand|pg||

nt|eamongall: sure I accept that but plus scores mean you won't lose terribly on the board |pg||

nt|athene: entries slightly tangled though|pg||
nt|chick: true :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: i am not a fan of competing when balanced |pg||

pc|s3|nt|vugraphzaz: Toilet break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who for :)|pg||
nt|ady: south got opps of the hook   no real fit  and not a lot of power    but has found a suitable dummy|pg||
nt|athene: one alternative plan was to pass, wait until opps bid spades, and then double for takeout - if partner passes, you are happy, but if she bids clubs you go to diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but with Kx you aren't expecting partner to be passing a t/o x very often i suppose|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: maybe give up on the spade finesse since no chances for 4 spade tricks anyway|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eamongall: I am expecting 180 imps shared after 32 boards once Wales start scoring a few goals|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: and of course this plan has the flaw that there is no "double (takeout)" card in the box - only a double card|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|athene: so if you think partner might misunderstand double...|pg||

nt|athene: @DQxx is bad though |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: you are very fearful of east leading a short diamond against your club contract and getting ruffs|pg||

nt|golfsquash: trump promotion|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: needs trump leads  and 3 too hiigh|pg||
nt|athene: now if you play the queen and opps carry on with hearts you are doomed - but if south attacks spades, declarer might get home with two spades, four clubs, two hearts, one diamond|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: worth noting that north leads a heart rather than a spade - that's pretty much routine|pg||
nt|athene: with only four card suits you lead the one NOT headed by the ace|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|athene: @H10 should perhaps be suit pref for spades there|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: since north is known to have @H109 at that point|pg||
nt|jcomyn: one dowen|pg||
nt|athene: two down on @SQ now|pg||
nt|athene: south knows her side needs one more trick outside hearts anyway|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: well, they will be satisfied with one down|pg||
nt|eamongall: well if we want her to bid is it not only fair that we have a suggested action |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|athene: when defending your instinct is to force when declarer has a 2-suiter especially in only a 5-3 trump fit|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gosh just look at the scores  Irish ladies doing very well|pg||
nt|athene: but after north has ruffed from three trumps she knows a force isn't going to be so good|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am a little puzzled as to how she could KNOW that partner is stacked in both suits after just zero or one round of bidding....why couldnt each side have a massive fit?|pg||
nt|chick: the only action I could see was Unusual 2N after the 2@D bid|pg||
mc|11|nt|chick: but it's a 5-6 loser hand in practice, so the 3 level might be too high already|pg||

nt|athene: the only way declarer might have got that one right is if she somehow knew the hearts were 6-3|pg||
nt|chick: NS CC clearly states 5+ spades, 4+ minor|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yoiks|pg||
nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the @H9 lead deceived west|pg||
nt|jcomyn: your mother's granny would play a h|pg||

nt|athene: well, it's still one down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sorry she didnt think at all|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer wondering, is this a Grosvenor i see before me?|pg||
nt|chick: whatever it is called :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chilloncan: for those unfamiliar with Tartan Twos -- or their popular cousin, Muiderberg -- the underlying philosophy is basically: "let's push the opps to a game they might well not bid ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: otherwise, and also tell them how to make it when they might well go down if we stayed silent"|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|ady: this is true|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer might go wrong and rise with the king on a small diamond return|pg||
nt|athene: if she tries the queen and it loses, the defence can take the spade ace out of dummy before the clubs are unblocked|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: so she is going more down|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: maybe on restricted choice you should|pg||

nt|athene: some play lead of 9 against notrumps shows 0 or 2 higher|pg||
nt|athene: i must check the EW cc and see if they do that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: phew but bad for the irish hearts|pg||

nt|eamongall: So you are not a fan of the Tartan Lucas Muiderberg principle except in your opponents convention cards Marshall |pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is my favorite method in the world...for my opponents to play|pg||
nt|chick: and I love opponents who can't show each other those kinds of hands :)|pg||
nt|chick: or 1@S -- NS play 4 card majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: dont remind me I am too old for this|pg||
nt|eamongall: em ? operater|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe 1@D opening|pg||
nt|chilloncan: perfectly good structures if they show opening bid strength....but when they deny one they are treasonous|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: west sort of has the values for 2@H but it's a very bad hand, with three small in spades, especially playing 4-card majors|pg||
nt|eamongall: not sure the 4 card major goes as far as opening with a 5 card on the side :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S a make for n/s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats enough|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: double there tends to be takeout of spades - i.e. west couldn't double the first time because of short spades|pg||
nt|athene: well, north might feel she ought to get around to showing some spade support some time?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: PASS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S  from south |pg||
nt|yo_yo: would it not show the other 2 suits?|pg||
nt|athene: it's fairly aggressive with only 11 hcp and 3 diamonds - one of the suits partner is going to be bidding a lot|pg||
nt|athene: but at love all west wants to bid i suppose|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 3NT can also make|pg||
nt|chick: apparently not (although the @D suit definitely stinks) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for results and standings after 2 rounds|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|yo_yo: i wonder why , with a balanced hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: decent game |pg||
nt|athene: run the @S10 first time to cater for Qxxx with east?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: you aren't missing many points - if you think the double has to have 12+ then west has to have the @SQ|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but need to ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|ady: need to ruff a diamond    with A@C a good bet to be right  can make 10 tricks losing a spade|pg||
nt|athene: yes, unless hearts are 3-3, which they really shouldn't be|pg||
nt|golfsquash: seems best to win and play a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: maybe declarer is a bit worried about trump control - let's say diamonds are 4-4 and trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: if she ruffs a diamond then loses to the @SQ and gets forced again, she can't enjoy the @CK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems best to duck this|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

nt|athene: that is a mildly evil 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i know 2@C over 1@D has good pre-emptive effect, but you really do need either a club suit or a hand, or preferably both, at adverse vul|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she feels that as a passed hand it is ok|pg||
