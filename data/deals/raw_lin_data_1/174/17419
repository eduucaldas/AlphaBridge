mb|3D|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: what would double be?|pg||
nt|athene: @DQxx is bad though |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: you are very fearful of east leading a short diamond against your club contract and getting ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: also south is in the pre-balancing seat|pg||
nt|golfsquash: trump promotion|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: needs trump leads  and 3 too hiigh|pg||
nt|athene: now if you play the queen and opps carry on with hearts you are doomed - but if south attacks spades, declarer might get home with two spades, four clubs, two hearts, one diamond|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: worth noting that north leads a heart rather than a spade - that's pretty much routine|pg||
nt|athene: with only four card suits you lead the one NOT headed by the ace|pg||
nt|athene: but south might find it hard to take the deep finesse against dummy - i think she should, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: what do we suggest she bid and when |pg||

pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|athene: play north for KJx not J10x|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ady: this  way also good enough|pg||
nt|chilloncan: passing at any and/or all turns MIGHT be right of course on any given deal....but if you dont bid at favorable  with 75 shape and approximately a 4 loser hand, you'll be fighting a ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: seriously uphill long-term campaign|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c5|pc|d9|nt|athene: well done by south again not to be tempted by that spade singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if you are going to try for diamonds you better do it right|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: now trumps|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|athene: although @SQ K A, the defence would survive if north worked out to return a heart, as she probably would i think|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|athene: @H10 should perhaps be suit pref for spades there|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: since north is known to have @H109 at that point|pg||
nt|jcomyn: one dowen|pg||
nt|athene: two down on @SQ now|pg||
nt|athene: south knows her side needs one more trick outside hearts anyway|pg||
nt|athene: i think @SQ can't hurt can it? if partner has a club trick she will always come to it|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: well, they will be satisfied with one down|pg||
nt|eamongall: well if we want her to bid is it not only fair that we have a suggested action |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|athene: when defending your instinct is to force when declarer has a 2-suiter especially in only a 5-3 trump fit|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gosh just look at the scores  Irish ladies doing very well|pg||
nt|athene: but after north has ruffed from three trumps she knows a force isn't going to be so good|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am a little puzzled as to how she could KNOW that partner is stacked in both suits after just zero or one round of bidding....why couldnt each side have a massive fit?|pg||
nt|chick: the only action I could see was Unusual 2N after the 2@D bid|pg||
mc|11|nt|chick: but it's a 5-6 loser hand in practice, so the 3 level might be too high already|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, there are four ways to show the other 2 suits on the second round of bidding. perhaps EW have not assigned meanings to all four, but any one of them would seem a worthwhile ...|pg||

nt|athene: on a heart lead in 3nt you are going to have to get the clubs right|pg||

mb|3H|nt|athene: and the english captain said that would be certifiable :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: there was a hand last night where someone had a 5431 with a 5-card major and it was suggested they might open 2@C and rebid 2NT|pg||

pc|dT|nt|chilloncan: I was expecting a 3D bid from S. |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|athene: it would have to be an immediate club finesse, too, so you have entries to unblock them and then take the diamond finesse|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: the only way declarer might have got that one right is if she somehow knew the hearts were 6-3|pg||
nt|chick: NS CC clearly states 5+ spades, 4+ minor|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|athene: a small diamond endplays east in a moment|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yoiks|pg||

nt|athene: well, it's still one down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sorry she didnt think at all|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer wondering, is this a Grosvenor i see before me?|pg||
nt|chick: whatever it is called :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chilloncan: for those unfamiliar with Tartan Twos -- or their popular cousin, Muiderberg -- the underlying philosophy is basically: "let's push the opps to a game they might well not bid ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: otherwise, and also tell them how to make it when they might well go down if we stayed silent"|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|ady: this is true|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer might go wrong and rise with the king on a small diamond return|pg||
nt|athene: if she tries the queen and it loses, the defence can take the spade ace out of dummy before the clubs are unblocked|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||

nt|chilloncan: it is my favorite method in the world...for my opponents to play|pg||
nt|chick: and I love opponents who can't show each other those kinds of hands :)|pg||
nt|chick: or 1@S -- NS play 4 card majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: dont remind me I am too old for this|pg||
nt|eamongall: em ? operater|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe 1@D opening|pg||
nt|chilloncan: perfectly good structures if they show opening bid strength....but when they deny one they are treasonous|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: west sort of has the values for 2@H but it's a very bad hand, with three small in spades, especially playing 4-card majors|pg||
nt|eamongall: not sure the 4 card major goes as far as opening with a 5 card on the side :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S a make for n/s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats enough|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: double there tends to be takeout of spades - i.e. west couldn't double the first time because of short spades|pg||
nt|athene: well, north might feel she ought to get around to showing some spade support some time?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: PASS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S  from south |pg||
nt|yo_yo: would it not show the other 2 suits?|pg||
nt|athene: it's fairly aggressive with only 11 hcp and 3 diamonds - one of the suits partner is going to be bidding a lot|pg||
nt|athene: but at love all west wants to bid i suppose|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 3NT can also make|pg||

nt|athene: run the @S10 first time to cater for Qxxx with east?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: you aren't missing many points - if you think the double has to have 12+ then west has to have the @SQ|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but need to ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|ady: need to ruff a diamond    with A@C a good bet to be right  can make 10 tricks losing a spade|pg||
nt|athene: yes, unless hearts are 3-3, which they really shouldn't be|pg||
nt|golfsquash: seems best to win and play a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: maybe declarer is a bit worried about trump control - let's say diamonds are 4-4 and trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: if she ruffs a diamond then loses to the @SQ and gets forced again, she can't enjoy the @CK|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|athene: you would expect people to play 3nt or 4@H here rather than 5@D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why7 bid 2c vul opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: that is a mildly evil 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i know 2@C over 1@D has good pre-emptive effect, but you really do need either a club suit or a hand, or preferably both, at adverse vul|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she feels that as a passed hand it is ok|pg||
nt|athene: because at least her partner won't do anything rash, like taking her seriously|pg||
nt|jcomyn: grand especially when someopne whacks you for 800|pg||
nt|athene: south might well just pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not easy to reach game with 14 facing a passed hand and no great fit|pg||
nt|eamongall: I still expect Wales to come storming back in session 2 of this match ... they have won 1 and draw 1 so far |pg||

nt|chilloncan: when i said i advocate 3N by W, i meant in the context of needing IMPs. otehrwise inviting seems fine|pg||
nt|chick: I have to agree with Ralf.  Even with the vul game bonus, W doesn't have anything to warrant even inviting|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h8|mc|7|nt|chilloncan: perhaps should just pass 1D then?|pg||
