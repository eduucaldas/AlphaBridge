nt|pef: round robin counted towards whether you went into the knockout stage with one or zero losses recorded)|pg||

nt|panja: Good Morning all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|pef: does anyone know sementa and duboins methods well enough to explain why sementa's hand didn't quality for a non-vul weak 2 bid?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Joe, yes the top 8 qualifiers got two lives|pg||
nt|fluffy: I am no expert on neither pair's system, I am surprised that Sementa didn't open with a preempt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here is the system card for the great Duboin-Sementa pairing http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|mrdct: ew could quyite easily make 5 of a minor here|pg||

nt|peachy: These were the standings after the qualifying 10 rounds of Swiss http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=10&tourid=902|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome all to this prestigious Yeh Brothers toruniy |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not good enough I expect|pg||
nt|fluffy: It might be simply a suit quality problem given the position|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: good morning|pg||
nt|mrdct: need to be in 3NT rather than 5@d here|pg||
nt|jcwla: A singleton ask will get them there.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or not needed.|pg||
nt|kemperg: change the names please|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Germ, all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Germ and Gonzalo|pg||
nt|fluffy: Open room saw north open a weak NT, wich buried the diamond fit after the heart overcall, now south is poalying 6@c with the bad split|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Raija |pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|pef: east west rate to end up in 4 of one of the majors|pg||
nt|fluffy: second position is the worst position to preempt and you want the preempts to be pure suposedly. Third position, on the other hand is a different story as Mark Lair just showed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mrdct: west showing his minor 2-suiter|pg||
nt|kareno: 5 of a minor will likely make e/w but n/s have a huge spade fit so they will likely not sell at that level.|pg||
nt|frankaus: $US 100,000 to winners !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d by east is best to minimise the chance of a @c ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx |pg||
nt|mrdct: welcome back to wuxi|pg||
nt|bg: pass by W strange if 1nt =15-17|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello. Nice to be not alone.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello and welcome to the 4th round of the qualification for the YEH Bros. Cup.|pg||
nt|pef: I'm a bit surprised duboin doubled instead of bidding 3 spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants online at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/Systems_Open.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: very pretigious event each year |pg||
nt|mrdct: east telling partner he has equal length in the minors|pg||
nt|kareno: West likely will bid clubs - then we'll see what north does.  Exciting from the get go!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: meanwhile NS are cold for 5@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Friederieke|pg||
nt|kareno: Welcome Henry Bethe :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats ok if all else is well|pg||
nt|kemperg: has squeeze possibillyties|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|fluffy: in 6@c you have 2 ways of going down (@d-@s squeeze and the wrong finese)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I think 4NT is natural|pg||
nt|fluffy: showing a minimum hand with good hearts not willing to go to the 5 level|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|mrdct: this match is from the top half of the draw so the winner plays another undefeated team from the top half and the loser plays a winner from the bottom half of the draw|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kareno: And that he wants to compete :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: possibly that was just the contract not the auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  Greetings|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt by south works fine!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Gary.|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Not the real auction, but i got here too late|pg||
nt|frankaus: team members ay - http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/entries.aspx|pg||
nt|kareno: South's double doesn't make sense to me - he doesn't want to defend.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fine auction:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Gary and Jordan|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi G|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi G.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrdct: @HAQ protected now, although @s lead and @h through will put some presure on declarer|pg||
nt|benjy: Would you guys bid 1@S over a X? I wouldn't dream of it|pg||
nt|pef: they were going for 4 in 4c, but hard for sementa to do anything but bid 4 hearts there|pg||
nt|pef: this should be pretty dull in the play--making exactly 5 would seem completely normal|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this match very close at the half|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: but 6 of a minor still a good save|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine Precision e/w|pg||
nt|peachy: The USA Hampson team both pairs play Precision type system|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not exactly a predicted auction but they've gotten to the normal spot.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Prakash good to see you again|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|kemperg: and Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like -1 , -1 is good bridge some say|pg||
nt|frankaus: i play lots of good bridge  by that measure|pg||
nt|fluffy: Mark had just 1 shot to decide for a contract, and he settled for slam in clubs, the suit quality had a great impact|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3D = ?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both of our pairs using transfer responses over 1@C  and as we see here -- in competition|pg||
nt|kareno: When you save over the five-level you have to be RIGHT.  If they cannot make 5 you are wrong and if they can make six and bid it, you are wrong.|pg||
nt|kareno: You need mirrors to defeat 5@c|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes its right to take out insurance enen if ur -1 in both directions|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: And actually if west ducks the improbable heart lead, it will make too.|pg||
nt|mrdct: it would be a bad start to the match to defend 5@cx making when you are cold for 5@s yourself|pg||
nt|frankaus: exciting hand to get us on the way|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@d - anyone know what that is?|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a limit raise of @s with no shortages|pg||
nt|frankaus: duessing  - good @S raise|pg||
nt|frankaus: guessing|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm hearing limit, no short suit ... and Bergen.|pg||
nt|kareno: In any event, Bocchi's sniffer is working hard!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: CC from 2010 Euro is  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is he bids one more....your guess?|pg||
nt|frankaus: bochhi's hand hast little defence|pg||
nt|kareno: The 4-1 split may make things rocky for declarer.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like some sort of lebensohl variant here with south probably showing 4@s and no @h stopper|pg||
nt|mrdct: 8 top tricks and 9th can come in either red suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: He's all offense and no defense!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Friederike, all|pg||
nt|kareno: But happily for declarer, that is quite unlikely - more likely with the auction, however.|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Xu|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes i play great bridge  ( i go -2) LOL|pg||
nt|mrdct: and there is the 9th trick - now looking for a 10th|pg||
nt|panja: this can go down on promotion|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fluffy: some specs, better players than me said that having 3 spades, specially with a honnot is a negative factor for preempting in another suit, I don't agree, but they are better than ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: me so they should know! :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mrdct: easy make on the @s lead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: system aside, opening a hand with 8.5 losers and a 4333 11 count is swimming against the current|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyway, the idea is you want to have a singleton ask in place in case your @D's were say headed by Q instead of K.|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unable to enlighten you as to all these meaningsm sorry|pg||
nt|panja: thx Gary, Good evening...morning here, of course|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mrdct: @h lead less attractive now|pg||
nt|sybarra: you sound like an auctioneer Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i think joe will run for border|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Peter|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: Are e/w names surnames or first names, Operator?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kiwibridge: np Andrew welcome all|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not mad about his pass particularly if south's first bid showed as many as four spades with invitation.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North is  Hackett|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello and welcome to the 5th round of the qualification for the YEH Bros. Cup.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugrapha4: Hi Gary, I'll check when I can|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's customary in most parts of asia to use first names|pg||
nt|fluffy: he risks facing dummy with @c singleton and decent diamons (even 5 cards possible), but what he doesn't want in any way is to face @dQxxx or @dJxxx|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude    Klinger-Mullamphy odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: surnames only please|pg||
nt|peachy: I, too, think Jow ill take his nine and then see what is left|pg||
nt|peachy: *Joe|pg||
nt|panja: no more entry to Dummy to finesse trumps..if defenders don't help|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: late afternoon here and the 4 day break starts tomorrow|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcarroll: Nice competitive bidding to push EW to the limit|pg||
nt|fluffy: and play in 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, 10 actually already|pg||
nt|wygbe1: well defended|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am guessing that the 3D was artificial allowing E to distinguish later between a supershapely hand with slam intrerest and same without slam interest|pg||
nt|chilloncan: we  dont know|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: these names are left over from previous match|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will go down 2 but give Netherlands an IMP.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing that EW  are Verhees - van Prooijen|pg||
nt|henryb:  You do not know whether declarer's @h are that robust. Coult easily be AJx|pg||
nt|chilloncan: my idea is that a direct 3H over 2N might have indicated slam interest|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kareno: Declarer relieved I'm sure.  And now diamond finesse for safety.|pg||
nt|kareno: It can be effective - it's perfectly normal for Meckwell, one of the world's premier pairs.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: also normal for a lopt of ineffective pairs. i have a strange hunch Meckwell would occasionally win even if they didnt open these:)|pg||
nt|pelu: hi spec's can u explain 1NT on 5 card @s by Cheek - bluff??|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mrdct: as first name is usually but not always the family name|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes need to hook or duck a @d to maintain communication to the entryless dummy|pg||
nt|kareno: I am told: first name. Hiroki Yokoi and  Kazuo Furuta.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|frankaus: 12 is a nice start|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed, in a short match too.|pg||
nt|mrdct: running scores: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=1&tourid=902|pg||
nt|kareno: I assume this is a round robin phase.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 10 rounds of swiss|pg||
nt|panja: no, not 1@S for me, I would never...|pg||
nt|benjy: I think North should get this right|pg||
nt|benjy: the only time it is wrong to play a @C is when west is 4432 without the @DQ|pg||
nt|benjy: but if he held that hand then he prob wouldn't bid 2@H|pg||
nt|wygbe1: n may be concerned that s has spade king|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we are bemused by S's 1NT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|nt|Walddk3: http://tinyurl.com/3dtwfd9  for standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Friederike|pg||
nt|kareno: I knew those were first names - but I have TWO first names so wasn't sure :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Well done!!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: such an agreement could be very useful, but it might more or less oblige opener to raise 2D on three fairly freely. thought they might have a way around that too|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|panja: South's @S7 should indicate he does not have @SK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: Hi Friedirike|pg||
nt|wygbe1: souths carding was pretty informative though|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c7|nt|mrdct: when i used to work in Indonesia I was always called Mr David by my staff|pg||

pc|d6|nt|kemperg: no problems left|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Well, declarer does not know that yet.|pg||
nt|kemperg: lookes like a double squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably need page 234 of system notes for them|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kemperg: @D not 31|pg||
nt|fluffy: the way it has gone, he now also has another way to make: score his trumps separatelly!|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|baldfriede: Going down three now. Commentator's curse.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only person who calls me 'Miss Karen' is my doctor's receptionist :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have pitched a @s from dummy, cashed one high club before running @d|pg||
nt|benjy: A chance missed|pg||
nt|chilloncan: my copy was stolen by nternational jewel thieves|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pef: and now a quick claim|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mcarroll: in Open, W  only bid 2@S and S is now in 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: just ruff down hearts and spades, and make his 6 trumps tricks with 3@s and @dAK +@hAfor a total or 12|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

nt|mrdct: i certainly have|pg||
nt|chilloncan: as so often, 3N had better chances|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suspect that is South's opening, not East's|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pef: mark has a bit of a problem here, values to overcall, but the 5 card suit is terrible|pg||
nt|santyclz: And the 4 isn't quite up to snuff for a 4 card overcall.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|algraves:  hello|pg||

nt|kemperg: not the obvious bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: I overcall often with 4 card diamonds, so any 5 card suit would do the trick for me|pg||
nt|pef: especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome frank  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: that hand showed how impirtant it is to open the bidding when you have an opening bid|pg||
nt|panja: will NS make 3Nt on @D lead here?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I like the format of this tournament, the top 8 qualifiers get 2 lives in the finals, the next 8 get 1|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: other tables visible using  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@c likely a diamond raise.|pg||
nt|mrdct: the top 15 teams plus Mr Yeh's team qualify for the KO stage with the top 8 (including Mr Yeh) getting a double KO advantage|pg||
nt|frankaus: is this correct or did we have a pass missed?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this a trap pass|pg||

nt|pef: 2 hearts may be weak with both 5 spades and 4+ hearts.  that's a fairly common treatment these days|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@h is a convention that shows 5@s, 4@h and 5-8 points I think, Duboin is lieing about his strenght|pg||
nt|pef: some play it as weak as duboin's hand, actually|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: round 1 results here http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResultKnockout.aspx?section=b6b714a8-e406-4ec7-bdb2-fd1c39596dce&round=1&tourid=902|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: convention cards for participants at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/Systems_Open.html|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 2@C alerted|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excellent|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c is a transfer to 2@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s on ice here|pg||
nt|henryb:  or tied and gone on to win in OT|pg||
nt|mrdct: i haven't had that good fortune|pg||
nt|algraves:  lilght overcall at favourable vulnerability opp passed partner looking to pre empt or find a profitable save|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how many spades do we play or how many hts?|pg||
nt|pef: the end result may be to prevent north/south from getting to a making vulnerable 3nt or 5 diamonds|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: Richman-Griffiths playing previous board in 5@C|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like eight tricks is the limit for both sides.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: curious 2H bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  or lost in OT|pg||
nt|panja: EW have Aces, NS, the middle cards..|pg||
nt|benjy: or 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: red 2@D overcall would not be everybody's choice|pg||
nt|kareno: Mixed raise I imagine - 4 trumps and 6-9|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|kareno: Wrong vulnerability for n/s to compete further.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s the likely spot for EW now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: two easy boards to start|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3@d aSKS FOR STOPPERS IN 1D; i PRESUME:|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oops,sorry|pg||
nt|chilloncan: once more into the breach, my firends|pg||
nt|mrdct: no obvious source of tricks for declarer here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not a textbook double -- but often as here @C's will be long -- but in Geoff's hand too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ew have a @S partial|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6NT -1 in OR|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet JoAnn comes in now |pg||
nt|pef: 3 hearts will be down 2 or 3, but a great result for the Chang team, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: I would hate to X with 2-2 in major and 4 card @D - better 1NT would be my bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   1@S= either   bal 6-9 or 13+   OR   4+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this structure  1@C-1N = 10-12|pg||
nt|chilloncan: another 8.5 loser hand, but this time a viut of shape and favorable colors|pg||
nt|chilloncan: slam on 2 hooks|pg||
nt|panja: good....|pg||
pc|h4|nt|baldfriede: stoppers in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: no fear for joe grue|pg||
nt|kareno: Big bid by Joe Grue|pg||
nt|kemperg: or dbl:(|pg||
nt|algraves:  east sees no reason the bid with such good defense|pg||
nt|mcarroll: same auction in OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Hampton made 4@S on1 for a 10 imp leap|pg||
nt|frankaus: last board east 27 had zars so a clear opening|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcarroll: EW had 3NT with the 2-2 @D break|pg||
nt|henryb:  and likely to give back the imp from board 1 with interest|pg||
nt|mrdct: best defence should get this for 500|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: awkward choice for south|pg||
nt|sybarra: some have suggested she should bid 4 right away|pg||
nt|fluffy: you mean for Lavazza team, Chang missed the cold 3NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a cc for Sementa-Duboin http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|pef: sorry, yes, I mean the lavazza team|pg||
nt|panja: should be cold now..|pg||
pc|hK|nt|baldfriede: Now stop, or else.|pg||
nt|kemperg: Not for the OR, NS in 4@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 1|pg||
nt|kemperg: not sure of the meaning of 3@C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: whatever it is it seems a bit pushy opposite a possible flat 15 count|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I was told 3@c is puppet; I thought it was a real suit.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: board 1 was flat, this won't be :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I would want to be there |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from (very temporarily) summer-like central Pennsylvania, USA.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi ed|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Ed |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: North is declarer - his favourite seat!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with stif spade opps probably have that suit so hearts and clubs are the same suit, so why emphasize hearts when u can show both>|pg||
nt|bg: S has no confidence in pards vul 2 H call|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah he hasn't conveyed his 2-suiter|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have bid 4@s with Hiroki's hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Good lead.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like he'll scramble for 2 tricks in each suit except @d where he's got one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not the idea contract or start|pg||
nt|henryb:  awfully strong for 1N|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mrdct: yep - a likely push|pg||
nt|benjy: the problem with rebidding 2@D is that if partner bids 2NT then 3@S would be forcing, if you start with 2@S then you can rebid 3@D over 2NT as non forcing, but you may lose the @D ...|pg||
nt|benjy: fit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: Xu did not mark it as conv.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only source of tricks will be the defense :)  Clubs work well for declarer.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s might actually make here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was thinking same |pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: So looks like the first swing of the round|pg||
nt|kareno: Dave :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: a more passive lead may have worked better for the defence|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Brother Cavier lives !!|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW convention card from 2010 European Championship   http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/poland/buras-narkiewicz.pdf|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Xavier|pg||
nt|kareno: There's a very fine player in Canada, Irv Litvack who is known for his passive leads against 1nt -|pg||
pc|h2|nt|benjy: Looks like 1 down, if south exits with the K@S which looks normal enough|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: in practice, it makes though |pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrdct: a chance to strip the hand and endplay west to go -1 if the defence isn't sharp|pg||
nt|panja: true, but the issue is also of expected fit|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: these are short matches only 10 boards|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|mcarroll: 10 tricks looks pretty standard|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bg: 450 next|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=7&tourid=902  for standings after round 7 of 10|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and board 1 flat|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit Woolsey is trying to convert the world from leading from 4 card suits.  [oversimplification]  IF you don't have a 5 card suit -- try to hit partner's length by leading from 3|pg||
nt|algraves:  accurate bidding by NS|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there was little point ducking that one|pg||
nt|panja: since so much part of bridge is stochastic in nature...second chance is a good thing....|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb:  I think W is being too subtle|pg||
nt|kareno: That heart seven very revealing.|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But singleton @D led so it went off as the N hand got a @D ruff|pg||
pc|hA|nt|baldfriede: That's why I thought it is real.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s failed in the other room|pg||
nt|chilloncan: to exportone;s reputation, the contracts at stake have to be games or slams:)  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|kemperg: was not nessesary|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to valerie westheimer |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi:-)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Valerie, thanks for joining here|pg||
nt|mrdct: lost my connection for a tick - so this looks like a very good sacrifice|pg||
nt|mrdct: so good that it can actually make|pg||
nt|peachy: hehm the best ones are the ones that make|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: hmm, looks to me like it's making, assuming he guesses spades|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcwla: Hiya, Roland.|pg||
nt|frankaus: zar petkov  developed a sophisticated hand evaluation method  - link - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Semi-Final and Women's Final are 64 boards matches split into 4 16-board segments|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on this hand it's difficult to decide which if either @H/@S was better for defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 2nd  16-board set in the 64 board Semi-Final   Women are playing the same boards in their Final match|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: +10 for USA in board 1: 4@s bid and made by Hampson !|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kemperg: no sorry EW|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Roland|pg||
nt|mrdct: get @s right not a gimme here of course as the hook is kind of indicated on the auction|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kareno: So a fine result for Japan.|pg||
nt|henryb:  lots of interest|pg||
nt|mrdct: 7 or 12 imps for japan - probably 12|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|baldfriede: That was not the right idea. Declarer had to discard a @d|pg||
pc|c5|nt|benjy: A spec points out that 2@D also gains when partner bids 2@H|pg||
nt|panja: if I had, say KJT9xx of Spades...I might prefer 2@S..but with Axxxxx, 2@D is ok, or perhaps a little more attractivve|pg||
nt|benjy: I agree, i think i would treat that suit a s a 5 bagger|pg||
nt|benjy: and bid 2@D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kemperg: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|jcwla: Redouble not an impossibility here, then maybe a bigger hit.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: west will avoid getting endplayed now|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the closed room the defence cashed @dAK so no @d for declarer|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: East is squeezed |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: those results as they come will be updated here http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResultKnockout.aspx?section=b6b714a8-e406-4ec7-bdb2-fd1c39596dce&round=3&tourid=902|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|dK|nt|kareno: Well done.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcwla: Good defense.|pg||
nt|fluffy: Weichsel couldn't see all cards and was focused on gettin 1 off, but if he returned a club he could get many more tricks as Duboin wold lose the control and the diamonds would end ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: up running|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice defense in a losing cause.|pg||
nt|fluffy: after he won @hK I mean|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: welcome also to Mildred Breed |pg||
nt|mildredb: hi all :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: Hi Mildred :)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: this is the only head to head match, the others are playing 3-way matches|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|pelu: a grand - but how to bid after 3@D in S?|pg||
nt|woozle: An easy grand for EW here, but NS only go for 1700 if they bid up to 8 diamonds|pg||
nt|wygbe1: wonder why no diamond preempt by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Duboin-Sementa seem to be on their way|pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe this hand is much too strong at the vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room Imakura opened 3@D |pg||
nt|woozle: 1H:4D makes it hard to reach 7 unless east can show his void over blackwood|pg||
nt|pfbr: morning roland@h|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: in CR the bidding stated 3@D - 4@H - 5@D (why not 6@D?)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at these colors, 3@D opening must be close to automatic for majority|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hey Anita :)|pg||
nt|woozle: Not for everyone...for me, it's an ace too strong|pg||
mb|3D|nt|woozle: Madala backs in with 3D though...interesting to see how Bocchi deals with it|pg||
nt|woozle: Someone asked me about 2C. I don't know either.|pg||
nt|pelu: yes Kieran - and I still look forward to play rubber aganinst u :):)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: the CCs i have for Furuta and Teramoto [with other partners]  all describe 2@C as natural game force|pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe he thought it would get him useful information. Maybe it has.|pg||
mb|6D|nt|woozle: It had better be useful information, because he's at the six level and it's all he has to go on|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Bocchi had better not bid 7D now, permitting Teramoto to pass to show the void|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well at least Bocchi took Peter's adviced about bidding higher faster|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|mc|13|pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SJTH86DAKJ763CT63,SKHAQT972D94CAKJ9,SQ865H3DQT852C542,SA97432HKJ54DCQ87|sv|e|nt|Walddk4: In China, family names come first, that's why the operator thinks the 4 first names are family names|pg||
nt|kemperg: dobled in the OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 7+|pg||
nt|algraves:  3NT with 9 tricks minimum of course |pg||
nt|sybarra: that felt like it should have made :(|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Mildred@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: big difference between +590 and -300|pg||
nt|benjy: brb|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well worth a look. though that E hand was an opening bid before petrov was born:)|pg||
nt|panja: a Grand now, on B3|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: the event is to determine Australia Representatives or 2011 APBF [zone 6 championship] and accompanying Zone 7 playoff  then 2011 Bermuda Bowl/Venice Cup|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 4 card openings for Burgess-Courtney, strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Peter Gill was to opening the South hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S are Paul and Justin Hackett    EW  Adam and Nabil Edgtton (brothers)|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice hand here|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S will be the winner of the contest?|pg||
nt|panja: bidding should witness a @D bid from E sometime now|pg||
nt|panja: 3@H P 4@D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it did and takes up a lot of room|pg||
nt|panja: the most difficult thing for EW, on B3 is to find out about the third round of Clubs..|pg||
nt|panja: W will need to know @CQ, E, !AK...@D void description is the easier part after the opening|pg||
nt|panja: oh well..I didn't consider North's options..right...5@D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I have often wished I had a specific Queen asking bid :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: Burgess-Courtney playing  "4 Card Standard"|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a precision style 2@c|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Finally slam time.|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS could scape home in 3NT here - but partscore more likely i think|pg||
nt|kareno: North left with a winner and a loser.  That @h 7 was the bee's knees :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: A\\Just a bit:)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mrdct: just about make 7@d here|pg||
nt|kareno: Multi by west|pg||
nt|algraves:  dble shows spades|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Am told Hampson is in 3@s in OR|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: West:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS might try 3NT here - but it has cardiac problems|pg||
nt|panja: 6@D now, surely...|pg||
nt|panja: but the @CQ will be very difficult to find out about|pg||
mb|5N|nt|kareno: Looks like 6@d will fetch here but hard to get there after opening bid by west.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes this is a handtype whee precision pats off|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pays the piper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW were on the winning team in (last month's?) NEC Cup|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@s pass or correct I guess|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s is pass/correct - i.e. interested to play in game opposite a weak 2 in @h|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@H is making|pg||
nt|kemperg: not so easy:(|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes:) ha/ha|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4+@D|pg||
nt|pef: well that was a bit more imps than we expected|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: GSF?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Looks like a victory for the weak NT - @S partial on for EW|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Although 1NT no bed of roses|pg||
nt|kemperg: should end in 4@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: was not easy for E to find a dbl:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: White on red first seat making up for the lack of texture and EW really nothing to say.|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl modern style, 1@S = no @S's|pg||
nt|algraves:  presumably 1@S would deny 4+ spades|pg||
nt|mildredb: clever line :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Good one Dave|pg||
mb|6C|nt|mrdct: it was a mere overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart lead would put paid to 7|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt looks normal here.|pg||
nt|fluffy: Huang made soem safety play in trumps to protect from @cA being offside, that wasn't succesful|pg||
nt|frankaus: we used to add length point and basically came to the same conclusions|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: east west at the other table "sacrificed" in 4 hearts doubled for down 6 and -1400|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a really silly sac then|pg||
mb|6D|nt|baldfriede: I don't see a way to develop a 7th trick.|pg||
nt|kemperg: why duck|pg||
nt|mrdct: curtis needs slightly better @s pips for this to make|pg||
nt|mrdct: west's @HK in gold|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there;s no bee;s knees like slow bee's knees|pg||
nt|mrdct: need accurate defence to beat this|pg||
nt|algraves:  a good treatment for the system freaks out there in my opinion|pg||
nt|pef: it was sort of a forced sac.  east for some reason I don't understand doubled 3nt (west had made a rather|pg||
nt|pef: light negative double of a 1 diamond overcall)|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play|pg||
nt|pef: all roads would seem to lead to 3nt here|pg||
nt|chilloncan: many in this hemisphere would rebid 2D as S to save space|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Griffiths-Richman 2/1|pg||
nt|mrdct: does it? - they might not find their @d fit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that was my point|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@c will still make though i think|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT denies 3@S's|pg||
nt|kemperg: Ah:(|pg||
nt|panja: EW playing Prec, I guess|pg||
nt|panja: now what does each of EW know?|pg||
nt|panja: W knows @D void...and that E has a good hand with @H support|pg||
nt|panja: if E has @Cxxx...|pg||
nt|panja: where will W park the @C loser?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he must have outside values AQ of @S would do|pg||
nt|panja: well...can  you rule out @DA stiff?|pg||
nt|panja: say @SAJxxx,@HKJxx@DA @Cxxx|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the fact that he bid 5N first may be an inference|pg||
nt|panja: the trouble is...a GS needs good % to succeed..you cannot just bid it on a hunch|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we'll see what Duboin makes of it all|pg||
mb|7H|nt|ahollan1: standard signals for NS     EW upside-down count/attitude  odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Courtney - "I  always wondered what you'd have if you passed throught Bobby, and know we know"|pg||
nt|mrdct: north needs to show a spade splinter and that might get south going|pg||
nt|chilloncan: y|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Can't believe North won't show the strength. Now probably 4@h.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver in 4H|pg||
nt|mrdct: and this|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i prefer 2D on E hand in this situation|pg||
nt|kareno: Huh?  Weak?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: did Fred really duck that|pg||
nt|pef: which isn't cold by any means on a club lead even with a good guess in clubs.  declarer will need to decide whether to go after hearts or spades for a ninth trick|pg||
nt|chilloncan: some danger in it, but its a risk reward judgment|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: the tapping defence in @h looks best double dummy|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there are double dummy lines to find a way to go down, but i would need massive odds to bet against declarer|pg||
nt|chilloncan: weak? red against white fdacing a passed partner|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c had a better chance of making here|pg||
nt|kareno: But could north pass it?  |pg||
nt|algraves:  you put overcaller on lead, and save bidding space on some tricky to bid hands|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fast and furious auction|pg||
nt|fluffy: vulnerability scared EW from competing any further|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this way 4@S North instead of South :)  with some extra info for declarer that won't affect the play|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm sure NS would be more than happy to reach 6@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: *is|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That's the limit here--|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that helps explain the choice of 2@D from last hand -- but in other room West Passed 2@D instead of the false preference with singleton @SQ|pg||
nt|panja: difficult for South now..|pg||
nt|benjy: 2nt scramble looks normal|pg||
nt|wygbe1: presumably n plans to correct clubs to diam, or bid diam over 2nt|pg||
nt|benjy: why would you correct 3@C? surely you would pass|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks for the kind invite but no thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  4@s needs a @c shift at trick 2 to beat|pg||
nt|kareno: Won't a spade shift work as well?|pg||
nt|algraves:  3NT is a make here|pg||
nt|panja: it is far better for North to bid 1@H first time..than to try and reopen at two level|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Sementa knows he's facing a very good 4@H|pg||
nt|panja: do we have the meaning of 5Nt from the table?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well bid and we see why these guys are one of the tops in the world|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: duh   of course Dyke rebid 2@H|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d only?  I wonder if their responses to takeout doubles are peculiar.|pg||
nt|algraves:  presumably 3@C did not promise great hand, as 2@Sfor that|pg||
nt|mrdct: so they've successfully diagnosed the lack of a @h stopper and stopped in 3@d|pg||
nt|mildredb: they must have heard you VW|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D without real @D or 3-card @H support?  Not sure many would do that.|pg||
nt|frankaus: others use loser count open with all 6 loser hands - lots of tracks all leading behind the same mulbarry bush|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes. LTC is a pretty powerful guideline|pg||
nt|othered1: Very lucky position for NS, allowing overbidding to slam in either rounded suit, or even NT.  |pg||
mc|13|nt|mcarroll: E surely worth another bid?|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, maybe not :)|pg||
nt|algraves:  but the light overcall style hurts them here as east was afraid to bid past 3@C. picture the overcall on board 2|pg||
nt|algraves:  no free lunch|pg||
nt|frankaus: E has a good hand after pd opens - i would think is worth some form of game try |pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C ment also a good overcall|pg||
nt|algraves:  well partner did not open, they overcalled and on board 2 they overcalled with 6 HCP|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT makes from E but not W, and after the encouragement from W with 3@C it is reasonable I suppose for E to take a shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: then he would pass 2@C|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|woozle: An interesting idea from a spec...if Teramoto had passed over 6D, that might show the first round control, because his partner thinks clubs is trumps...then he can correct whatever ...|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@C and another     honest!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|woozle: It appears that Madala is making a genuine effort to show this hand, but I don't know how close he is to depicting this power|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|pelu: if u only see NS-card looks like 5@C could make - but the 6-1 @D will kill that game - 3NT by N making|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but i agree that 2N should be used as scramble|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i giess he was ensuring minus only 50|pg||
nt|panja: I thought E could have bid 7@H on 6@C..but since we don't know the exact meaning, we cannot judge for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: think he claimed 1 up when @SK onside|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Part score time.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: interesting hand|pg||
nt|othered1: it would be 100 instead of maybe 150|pg||
nt|sybarra: makes sense to save what might have to|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 6@s is on here|pg||
nt|peachy: This will be EW hand, I presume not even interference from NS|pg||
nt|benjy: In fact i think X of 2@S is so normal that i would consider it more of a risk to pass out 2@S|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: too much time Stephen -- now they probably won't let you bid 4@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: everything about this tournament is completely first class both for the players and the spectators - Mr Yeh puts on a great event|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh now that is truly motheaten for second seat red.|pg||
nt|algraves:  I assume the NS play transfer responses to 1@C |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@H: not recommended|pg||
nt|pef: this one shoujld be interesting.  north south have a bid double fit, east west have 12 hearts beween them|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kiwibridge: @H=@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I see Australia made 4@H on board 2|pg||

nt|fluffy: or @cQ looking for opening leader to have @cK. However if you have 2 suits to lead, and one is headed by Jack and the other from the King, experts will always pick the one from the ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: King, this makes playing the queen the percentage action|pg||
nt|pef: the 4 heart opening was a transfer to four spades for north south :)|pg||
nt|pef: both sides can make exactly 5 of a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Neills 3@S shuts them all out esp pard|pg||
nt|henryb:  The web site has no posted results|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its the standard though these days Jordan|pg||
nt|fluffy: how amny teams qualify?|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c lead will beat it|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C likely a form of Drury|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S W anyone|pg||
nt|fluffy: Dubion won't let 4@s play, he is deciding now how far will he competer|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well he could count 9 tricks for declarer on normal play so was desperately searching for something that could steer declarer off normal play.  |pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h is a constructive raise to 2@s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: more 5-level action|pg||
nt|frankaus: dealer has provided interesting hands so fay|pg||
nt|mrdct: standby|pg||
nt|kareno: And that is not to mention the very sweet winners' pot of $100,000|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl negative, pass better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: x should be blood after a multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Lot of bidding from both Courtney and Burgo on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: four -  not SIX|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Not liking the chance of this contract all too much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north's choice:   DBL vs 1@H vs [i guess] PASS   you choose|pg||
nt|kareno: All the action we could possible want :)|pg||
nt|bg: China lost 7 on strange  1nt board one where 1nt was passed out|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, @C start and good decision in @D|pg||
nt|kareno: Ok|pg||
nt|mrdct: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=6&tourid=902|pg||
nt|kareno: Here's a site http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=902   then click link for round|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, and he puts up the BBO commentators at 5 star hotels also|pg||
nt|mrdct: that's part of the "first class" bit for the players|pg||
nt|jcwla: No matter this time, on the way to 4@S EW.|pg||
nt|algraves:  3NT NS|pg||
nt|wygbe1: pretty close, but i think i would pass - if south decides to sit your defense will be disappointing|pg||
nt|pef: they are playing in 6 hearts doubled in the open room|pg||
nt|fluffy: 5@d is a "fit bid", obviously Duboin doesn't want to paly in diamonds when he couldn't open the bidding, he uses the bid to show lenght in both diamonds and hearts. Offering a good ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: lead to partner if he is on lead later, and suggesting a higher sacrifice if they have dobule fit|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch both vugraph rooms at the same time - one window per table|pg||
nt|fluffy: IMO Lair should double now, he is minimum for a 4 level double, has a @dK not looking good. His alternative is "pass" wich is foricng and encouraging|pg||
nt|pef: I think mark is going to double here, but he does have a problem|pg||
nt|pef: he might decide to bid 6 spades as a two way shot|pg||
nt|pef: or even pass if that is clearly forcing|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told that link is obsolete.  Current links are:   http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|fluffy: pass is also reasonable, as an invite, but 6@s is not reasonable, that would be a mistake|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrdct: no results for rd 6 as yet but i imagine they wont be far away|pg||
nt|mrdct: just the operators Marshall - the ones doing the real work|pg||
nt|chilloncan: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: undo please|pg||
nt|panja: 1@C..stealing South's suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's naturalish|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: plus the ruffs|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT on here|pg||
nt|mrdct: with this fortunitous @c layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP passed   it is NS doing the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East is just a tad shy of Strong 1@C opening|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S = @D i suppose|pg||
nt|mrdct: and a @c lead look pretty likely from south|pg||
nt|peachy: by elimination, leading their second suit no good (nor because it is doubleton), Jxx not appetizing and trump even less so|pg||
nt|mrdct: so 3@d non-minimum with a @d side suit i guess and now 4@d is a simple cue|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 1@S on north hand instead of strong NT, if available|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: and standings: Israel 99, Japan 97 USA 95 Australia 93|pg||
nt|pef: not clear to me that pass is forcing. yes weischel bid 5h, but he's a passed hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|mwigor: isnt it more than one down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes indeed|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: pretty conservative non-X by East|pg||
nt|mwigor: it is worth noting that 5@c makes EW - so in theory this is a good result for NS|pg||
nt|mwigor: i doubt many will find 5@c though|pg||
nt|kemperg: has chances |pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will not be easy.|pg||
nt|kemperg: first the start:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Passive defence may beat this - a @D lead gives declarer his 9th trick|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D J can also be the 9th|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h lead look normal to me.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I suppose 1@s means @h here.|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure |pg||
nt|kareno: I guess as of last night|pg||
nt|mrdct: yesterday they were updated about once every 10 minutes with live progressive scores from all matches|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S was -3 on 3 for 6 imps practically all square now|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice, a close match|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no trump finesse here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile Kaplan-Rubens evaluates the W hand at under 8: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=QJ6+Q76+QJ73+K92 |pg||
nt|kemperg: transfer Walsh i think|pg||
nt|algraves:  and that 1@C is balanced or clubs, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Allan   1@C=3+  and transfer responses   not sure if 1@S promises @D|pg||
nt|kemperg: not sure either, in my system it does|pg||
nt|algraves:  well, no major presumably and if balanced not very strong so usually unbalanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well by unpassed hand  1@C-1N is game force 5+@D  and 1@S just denies 4+@H/@S   not sure by passed hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, to cater for injudicious overcalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zhuang could RDBL to force Dai to complete the Texas Transfer|pg||
nt|benjy: Split panel then|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd Lair|pg||
nt|sybarra: those minor suits look a bit puny|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in the OR Bochhi leapt to 6@D|pg||
nt|panja: right, the world natural, does not of course  have a definition in Bridge...so things are naturalish...or not or whatever|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but Madala did not open 3@D|pg||
nt|panja: must redouble with @ST..|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: no choice is perfect, no choice is awful|pg||
nt|mrdct: this looks 2 off|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW have ti be carefull in @S|pg||
nt|kareno: Finesser's paradise :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: a nice direct auction by NS|pg||
nt|chilloncan: meanwhile, even playing 5 cxard majors i would have a tough time pulling out any bid but 1H|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence can only ever get 6 tricks here and with @SJ now set up they'll need a @d switch now to avoid -120|pg||
nt|pef: so we got to the par spot at both tables and will have a push|pg||
nt|panja: if 1@D is not forcing...then 1@S must have some meat....so 3Nt is almost a certain make..with @ST...it is even more certain|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: however   with 5@S 3@H  DBL isn't a good choice since weak advancer [partner of doubler] will bid 1@H with 3@H & 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't have Q1 result for  Hans-Brown   maybe Adam knows [his brother is member of Hans team]|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
nt|frankaus: on the other hand the rebid is quite a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: some people play that double means: pass if this is your suit, bid your suit otherwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like a puppet to 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: wd by N....far from obvious to bid over 1N, as S did not say double so suboar chance of 44 hearts, and long suit is weak. but this was the time for aggression|pg||
nt|chilloncan: oh wait, sorry i thought they were going to 3N after 2C|pg||
nt|kareno: Most unlikely, though |pg||
nt|mrdct: now RKCB and 5@h asking for the @sQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: opponents have preempt opposite passed hand, they are at the 6 level, if they make this, it will be doubled|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: i'm told  Brown +2     [or Hans -2]|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Brown up 2 imps|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c may well be a puppet to 2@d to establish this sign-off in 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if N was not planning to invite 3N, which as i said was pushy, i dont really warm up to aiming at a final contract of 3C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: needs to avoid the ruff|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankaus: nicely done to protect N's @s stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course my copy of the NS CC is from Beijing 2008|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Qx a good NT holding for declarer, and T9x often neutral as to position|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kareno: Not enough compensation for their vulnerable game.  Of course 4@h can be beaten but will it?|pg||
nt|fluffy: I am not a multi expert, but I ahve seen this treatment at the table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I play X = I know what your suit is please pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that @D play never works for me|pg||
nt|wygbe1: the double of 4h allowed west to let east declare, where west has no lead advantage in hearts|pg||
nt|benjy: Just going back to the X of 4@H, does it merely ask partner to lead a @H or does it suggest that partner might support at the 5 level, if the latter then I would be concerned that ...|pg||
nt|benjy: with such a balanced hand it was risky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: single dummy -- it's hard to figure out what's best now|pg||
nt|henryb:  On board 3 the US again pushed to game where Japan stopped. |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: why not just pass 1N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd singleton King in 4 boards  |pg||
nt|frankaus: declarer will be holding his breath as he takes @h finess|pg||
nt|algraves:  ok regardless they have arrived at the best contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: most peaple do it that way|pg||
nt|kemperg: to late negative i mean|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but -6 that time|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: progress from all matches here http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResultKnockout.aspx?section=b6b714a8-e406-4ec7-bdb2-fd1c39596dce&round=2&tourid=902|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: but EW could easily be going down in 5@s or 5@h in the other room so might be good for the chinese/dutch combination|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he ran from his cold game into a part score, frighteneing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mwigor: of course -800 would not have been a good score for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at KQ10 south llikely to switch to @DK anyway which blocks @d|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: lots of red suit discards coming|pg||
nt|mildredb: drum roll|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Now will Curtis lead a club? or a heart here?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Tight Mildred:)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Right*|pg||
nt|mrdct: lots of imps riding on this lead|pg||
nt|mildredb: it is taking longer to lead than it will take to play the whole hand|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's after 16 of 48 boards|pg||
nt|mrdct: chnace for an imp for USA|pg||
nt|kareno: 11 toppers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver in 3N North after East opened 2-suited 2@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: put me in open 1Nt camp - then some sort of 5 card stayman|pg||
pc|dA|nt|baldfriede: Gettin up with K@d gave a trick.|pg||
nt|mrdct: particularly against game in the open room - so 26 imp swings on the lead|pg||
nt|pef: four hearts vul. in third seat has a huge range.  He could easly have the best hand at the table.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont have a problem with 1N|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugrapha4: 64 is it not?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy -- i changed my mind about   with 48 to play versus  16 of 64 :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would be very confident that no table in the field will play this board at the 4-level|pg||
nt|kareno: So a quiet down two.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zhuang fears @C ruff -- and worried about 3rd round of @H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|baldfriede: E/W  have to stick to their @s.|pg||
nt|mrdct: and 3 working finesses = 14 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: whaty did Fred make of the start, @H looked normal|pg||
nt|mrdct: prob @sA and another now|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Curtis knows that Joanna has clubA|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C normal over a forcing 1N.  If partner's hep to your style nothing bad will happen all that often|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the tripleton heart is a plus for NT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: you wanna jump in?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mrdct: he wont be happy seeing the @cQ coming down|pg||
nt|mrdct: now north needs to cling to all his @cs|pg||
nt|algraves:  west really trusted his partners double as he can see nine tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kiwibridge: unusual not to take the safety play the ruff was staring in the face|pg||
nt|algraves:  and had to assume that they could not now take 4@D tricks|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Spade finesse?|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks like it|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think @s finesse is wrong play|pg||
nt|mildredb: i agree|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deLivera also opened 4@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like 10 tricks - but missed a possible vul game in 3NT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: 39 imps in 4 boards it's not good bridge|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mwigor: they've missed the second ruff so now only 2 down|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@C in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink playing 4@H South|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not necessarily, defence can still get 5|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: spade 8?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that seemed like it would never work|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real surprise there|pg||
nt|mwigor: perhaps gosney should have led back the jack?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Which should yield 2@S and 1@D to defence for 1 down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h discard would have given it.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not any more needed to play @C|pg||
nt|kareno: There should be some sort of squeeze on this hand.  Or an ending.  Very complex.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting trump position, W has to coup S by leading red winners from dummy to prevent the @S6 winning a trick|pg||
nt|bg: sry too early|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Bruce|pg||
nt|fluffy: yeah in the end he has to play small trump to the 8 from his hand if Mark Lair refuses to ruff anything|pg||
nt|mrdct: it is clear the south has the longer @c so you dont care if north wins @sK|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other room using  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|henryb:  If I were Joe I would play @hK ans a @h to the J before cashing the last @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: 8 tricks it is|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer still fears AQ@c offside.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bg: discard club ruff a heart dia to ace ruff another heart then low to the eight endplay|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit unlucky done you think?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Another big swing|pg||
nt|mrdct: didn't cost here though but would have big time if south had @sKxx|pg||
nt|mildredb: Curtis was a 1 man show on that hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi Yuval|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Yuval|pg||
pc|h9|nt|baldfriede: Here is the reason why @h discard would have given a trick.|pg||
nt|kareno: Nicely done with an endplay.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panja: clearly Imakurasan took out because of the reputation of the opponents..|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good cover with @HQ   but now we'll never know whether or not Matt was going to float the 10|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|s5|pc|c4|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so last 2 hands  23-0 to Lavazza|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|woozle: EW can make game in either major in their seven card fit, but 3NT can be defeated|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|woozle: At the other table, South (Imakura) went with my Luddite plan of 1D then 3NT, but he fell from grace and ran after East tried a lead-directing double|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|pelu: but the last +10 was close to -4/5 - S was in 3NTx - but run to 4@c?|pg||
nt|woozle: If Teramoto's 3C is shortness, Furuta will know to avoid 3NT|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if it is shortness or maybe a way to differentiate strength of 55 hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|woozle: perhaps not shortness then. Still, NS have to sort out their club tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C lead is ostensibly Attitude  [not count]|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|pelu: @D back and now N can play @CJ|pg||
nt|woozle: OK, fortunately for Madala, the issue was to not crash the clubs, not to not block the clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: that the easy way - @DA now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told   3@C= a) 55  b)  short @C      3@D=ask  3@H=55|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|woozle: Bocchi might not be completely sure about the club layout|pg||

nt|kareno: Accident in the OR that hand.|pg||
nt|kemperg: but a very good start from ops|pg||
nt|algraves:  and saved an imp or two|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great result Japan then|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
nt|benjy: Yes it looks like declarer played for 1 down|pg||
nt|wygbe1: nothing would work, so he just played for down one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all good 3/4 flat and 1 swing|pg||
nt|pef: another hand with swing potential.  will north south get to 4 spades and will they make it?|pg||
nt|frankaus: noon here so bar is open :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: raising the bar?|pg||
nt|othered1: The concentration of honor tricks in majors and trash in minors is what turns that last h and from 1N to 1S, at least here in the Pennsylvania hinterlands. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the good sac withered on the vine as it were|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was *dont you think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but why make it easy for the defense?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's wrong with trying @H at trick 3?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another 10 imps|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 3 imps lost vs possible huge gain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another eash hand for Burgess to bid :(|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no they threw 14 on board 1 :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: lead I ment|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wants N for weak 2 in @H w/ @SK and @CA |pg||
nt|kemperg: will W believe that:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That 2@H will surprise partner|pg||
nt|bg: looks like some one fed the computer a new deck and then dealt a goulash|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: no moths|pg||
nt|fluffy: 5@h from furuta would give weichsel some pressure|pg||
nt|pef: north's hand is considerably too good for a strong nt opening|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes if you consider it trash. Qx s a good NT holding for declarer and Y9x usually neutral|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mwigor: 4@d isnt great news - but avi does have a good hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: 6@h is an ok contract - and makes on this layout|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h EW the spot here|pg||
nt|kareno: This hand should get to a quiet 4@h but it is possible to overstretch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=limited  4+@H maybe longer 2nd suit  included 5@H & 5@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 4@S splinter|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2 unsupported Queens I'd do it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S transfer|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4 of either major for EW here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this looks like a mickey mouse 2@D I suppose its @S +@C weak |pg||
nt|pef: double here shows 3 spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: was just about to mention how weird is it to see NS pass a 12-count :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1N=0-2@S  forcing unless 5@H(332)|pg||
nt|mrdct: most likely @s of course|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think there was intent in the open room just not the desired outcome|pg||
nt|kareno: Dai with a very active double at favorable|pg||
nt|pef: a support double (invented by Eric Rodwell)|pg||
nt|henryb:  never happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Stretchy Drury by east.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c looks like drury|pg||
nt|kareno: Fourth trump does it.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: fortunately N is not 4333 so the decision is easy|pg||
nt|othered1: normal auction by south, likely to iffy 4@S|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugrapha4: I'm about to resatr the room.. this looks pretty easy. back in 2 minutes|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: *restart|pg||
nt|mrdct: north can get a @c ruff but there is no entry back to south for another one|pg||
nt|frankaus: 12 probable in @S|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 14-16 here|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt will not make if NS cash 5 tricks...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure if he was going to that, bid NT or conventionally show @C support|pg||
nt|kemperg: then where did W find 3@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: precision 3 suiter short @D I amd told (yuk)|pg||
nt|kemperg: that explains|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I saw it in an earlier match. That must be the lot until 2015|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's truly horrible in my book, 2@C I could almost tolerate|pg||
nt|jcwla: Texture doesn't seem to matter until you have to play in one of those suits you bragged about.|pg||
nt|kemperg: that happened in OR, and S is in 2@S|pg||
nt|benjy: not easy for west to switch to a @D here|pg||
nt|benjy: if he ducks then declarer can prevail thanks to the favourable @H position|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mrdct: 3NT will be in trouble on a @s lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 5+@S|pg||
nt|algraves:  2@D presumably artificial game force|pg||
nt|benjy: I would be amazed if this didn't make|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  This play was 100%, but unless Kazuo had not led a @h from Q10xxx a heart play was also 100% and offered chances for the overtrick|pg||
nt|mrdct: plenty of trick on offer here if he gets @d right and contract still safe if he doesn't|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c ruff might beat this|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Club A lead not obv:-)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Can still beat this w/o ruff|pg||
nt|yuval10: the finalists of the last NABC are one of the most aggressive pair in the highest level|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 either major ok|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: Courtney is well known for his prowess at Rubber Bridge|pg||
nt|mrdct: it wont be too hard for south to unblock|pg||
nt|mrdct: draw trumps and try to steal a @c trick|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the known diamond positioin gives him an extra entry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are 9 tricks but can het get them|pg||
nt|kemperg: par 6@H|pg||
nt|benjy: But we'll see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: halftime scores under http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=902    then click link for  appropriate KO round|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes a very handy bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: after 3@C -- will Klinger push to 3@H?|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR S played a second low @D for the K|pg||
nt|chilloncan: iffy didnt get to 4S he should be upset|pg||
mb|3H|nt|frankaus: now to make it wont be easy|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: How shld Joe play clubs?|pg||
nt|peachy: he might have trouble all by himself|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: specs might factor that into some of the auctions we'll see|pg||
nt|kareno: The takeout double may pinpoint the diamond suit for declarer.|pg||
nt|panja: 4 of a Major would be a good contract..|pg||
nt|panja: it seems 3@C showed stiff or void...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Venky|pg||
nt|panja: so W can judge that 3N is shaky|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: and the optimal contract is reached|pg||
nt|kareno: I guess 100 percent pure is better :)|pg||
nt|benjy: Declarer followed with the @SJ was that correct?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: west found the right suit, but gave his pd a problem by not starting with the ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  4  Chung-Liu are playing 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: E has to discard 3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he can't really go wrong in trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: not a good hand for the total tricks theory it seem - NS has 9 trumps , EW 8, but i think they make more than 17 tricks in their respective contracts|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Panja, Roland and all specs, warm regards from Bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|panja: the dbl of @D confirms helps in staying away from 3Nt..|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mrdct: nowhere to dump all of the @d losers|pg||
nt|mrdct: yep|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: the defence will need to switch to a @d at some point but will get several chances|pg||
nt|algraves:  it looks like he is going to have to pick up both spades and diamonds to make it|pg||
nt|wygbe1: pd got it right though|pg||
nt|panja: hi Chhota Venky, Good afternoon from Sunny London|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kemperg: wd, W had to play the 10|pg||
nt|ianmcc: S should overtake @dK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Fred kindly located the high cards for him|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think @cJ is the only line|pg||
nt|ianmcc: specs say @s OK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its either +10 or -5|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute  DBL followed by correct to 3@H  brings @S into the picture|pg||
nt|mrdct: tournament website: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx|pg||
nt|chilloncan: double looks so obvious...and yet...at favorable colors, E couldnt act over 1C....|pg||
nt|mrdct: odds favour the hook here considerably|pg||
nt|kareno: And so it proves.|pg||
nt|benjy: marking declarer with KQJ or KJ, surely a low card was correct, allowing the leader to have Q1098x?|pg||
nt|rv: winner of this match enters finals directly right?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|algraves:  he cannot ruff a diamond of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: S has more tricks than he knew about|pg||
nt|mrdct: still going to struggle for tricks here as playing on @c himself will yield 3 losers in that suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If it's afternoon in London now I must be somewhere else|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcarroll: Coffee hand|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Soi they play canapes?|pg||
nt|kareno: Doesn't look obvious to me with those shabby suits.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well then we agree|pg||
nt|mrdct: @s continuation by east now might see west squeezed a tad on the run of the @d|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer with plenty of ammunition, including a spade entry to dummy.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kemperg: he's not sure of E distribution, 4441 poss.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 8 of clubs giant card|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes Venky|pg||
pc|c4|nt|algraves:  mis counted, doesnt need the diamonds|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@S 3@D 2@H 2@C and a rufff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this a Restricted Choice situation or is 10 meaningless looking at that dummy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now the trump situation is debatable, is the @S Ten singleton or from QT,|pg||
nt|pef: not when he is drawing them by playing high diamonds :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: NS prefer their auctions to last one bid, or two if they are feeling scientific|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bg: new style lead middle of three:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: still might have a guess in @d if W wins with the A and plays @c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W showed a lot of restraint in the auction|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kareno: An IMP back to Italy|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Will make 12 tricks now.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: So*|pg||
nt|rv: it is still 40 mins for afternoon even here:)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|mrdct: might be an imp for Lavazza here now to get them on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|kemperg: its an interesting hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 back halves the deficit|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kemperg: nice bid by E, 7; 61/2 loser hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd good play now home singing ragtime|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: N might have to decide whether S has Q of diamonds or T of hearts|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think west needs defence to play on @h for him to set up the QJ in dummy - which be a pretty poor defence not likely at this level|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont think that is clear|pg||
nt|kemperg: lookes restricted to me|pg||
nt|pef: I think he needs to pitch a club now to hold declarer to 4 spades|pg||
nt|panja: well Roland, it is afternoon at Venky's place...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: three bids make them uneasy|pg||
nt|sybarra: off the schneid |pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: souith needs to unblock a @d honour|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chilloncan: if S had Jx of D then D switch would be disastrous|pg||
nt|kemperg: but a perfect @S fit:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: now joe can duck a @c on the way back and limit himslef to 2 @c losers|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i think he'll get it right|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|kemperg: screw is tightening|pg||
nt|frankaus: no way home now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vdoubleu: Yes, Stansby "flashed"|pg||
nt|peachy: a bit of luck for Joe|pg||
nt|yuval10: W has 6 @c's and 3 @h's|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 to Hampson on 4, 2 failing part scores|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he played 8@s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: quite a change for Burgess from his Forcing Pass/Moscito Relay days|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the system is called  Ultimate Canape   usually associated with Russ Ekeblad [but i'm told his brother did most of the work]|pg||
nt|algraves:  well done|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Too many points for Joe not to have gotten that right|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: my kingdom for a claim|pg||

nt|woozle: perhaps a second spade|pg||
nt|woozle: or a red squeeze|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh   another @S after the opening lead|pg||
nt|woozle: Madala is plenty good enough to have played the king from KTx, but it's moot|pg||

pc|c7|pc|s3|pc|c8|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the squeeze will work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and  now safe to strip red suit suit winners and exit @SQ|pg||
nt|woozle: or just cash all of his winners and lead a spade|pg||
nt|woozle: playing south for 6232|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: btw -- we 2  multi-acbl national winners  saw that happening 3 tricks ago|pg||
pc|c6|pc|sQ|nt|woozle: I saw it too, but it only just fitted into the conversation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i spent too much time forgetting @SJ was led at trick 1  that i never caught up|pg||
nt|woozle: Best here is to win and play the heart ten|pg||
nt|pelu: best to take @SA and play @h10 - that will break the squeeze|pg||
nt|woozle: but it doesn't beat the contract - heart ace, minor winners, heart king, spade|pg||
nt|pelu: but N in problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then we can endplay North instead to lead away from @DJ6, Peter|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|woozle: No, South still has DT|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pelu: here we go - decl cant duck @h10 (@s10 is there)|pg||
nt|woozle: Lots of people haven't noticed that if you win the heart ace, there's no further entry to the DQ|pg||
nt|pelu: but Now decl can take all his red winners again and endplay S|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: another way of saying what Peter said|pg||

nt|ahollan1: one possible inference -- vP didn't lead @S from xxx   [was mentioned to me by   a. nonymous]|pg||
nt|algraves:  well it wasnt restricted choice as he had no option with either QT or singleton T |pg||
nt|peachy: Joe took the line he had to , he certainly knows which one to take|pg||
nt|mrdct: not being very kind to the event's sponsor|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it is more complicated than just canape -- 2@C/@D/@H take care of certain 2-suiters so not all canape's possible after 1-suit opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0+|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This looks like another 3nt.|pg||
nt|mrdct: rd 6 live score now up: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=6&tourid=902|pg||
nt|kemperg: in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a pause for coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C = TRF @H|pg||
nt|wygbe1: maybe declarer had qj tight of spades and king of diamonds |pg||
nt|sybarra: dealer is having fun|pg||
nt|rv: I might have pre-empted 2@s with South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C is only a 1-round force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scrambling stayman or transfer?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: splinter with no Aces sometimes dangerous|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrdct: a trump lead will beat 6@h here i think|pg||
nt|kareno: Transfer by north.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could be 4@D & 5+@S/@C|pg||
nt|kareno: Do they play DONT?|pg||
nt|kareno: Meckwell, I'm told.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds and a major.|pg||
nt|mrdct: that will thrill south|pg||
nt|jcwla: This gives new meaning to having three cards in each side suit when opening light in a minor.|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like the "catch all" 1 @D |pg||
nt|peachy: NS play a form of Precision, so 1D not promising D necessarily|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a partscore battle here|pg||
nt|pef: north south here may push to a no-points four hearts, which can't be beaten even if east west find their diamond ruff given the very lucky heart lie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only 14 Pearson points (should have 15) but a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|yuval10: wonder what the X means|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: ??|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 1 spec ty[ed to me that the sponsor invited good players, not nec. kind ones:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: suit :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W is close to 2S in my view, but 1S is normal|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E i mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is their system |pg||
nt|frankaus: i agree with 21S|pg||
nt|chilloncan: N might have bid 2H|pg||
nt|frankaus: Duboin will have a v good idea what this 3NT is based on|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W will bid, only a question of what|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: in fact i don't think it promises a rebid over 2@S -- but don't quote me on that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is example -- 1@D can't be canape into @H|pg||
nt|mrdct: burns law violation|pg||
nt|kareno: West taking the low road.  Will north compete in spades?|pg||
nt|sybarra: its quite a field invited |pg||
nt|pef: and the working club finesse (if needed to pitch a spade|pg||
nt|henryb:  Clearly Grue and Cheek play this as save suggesting at this vulnerability, and not lead directing|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well if it is lehit he will, he may be worried that S is totally messing around|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and indeed, he is providing for possibility of slam|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@C is an excellent choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Mullamphy would be able to transfer to @H  -- guess not|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: XX probably a run from Peter, so he chooses to pass|pg||
nt|chilloncan: surprising but accurate choice by W|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The red suit splits mean 8 red tricks and the @SA|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed - Mr Yeh has assembled a very strong field for this event|pg||
nt|sybarra: stars from all over the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 2@H  TO PLAY      how retro|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gill's problem tough here   transfer responses not requiring any points, but not forbidding them either :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL and 2N seem the front runners   hard to imagine PASS, but that would work out fine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Richman in 2N North|pg||
nt|kareno: I doubt they'll get that high|pg||
nt|mrdct: need to get @d right here to make|pg||
nt|mrdct: and sometime one might play north for a @d shortage with the long @c suit so not a guarantee to make this|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No easy lead for South.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C was best:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: how does 3NT go for EW?|pg||
nt|algraves:  that is a good point , often overlooked|pg||
nt|kemperg: he is Dutch top, doesn't overlook much|pg||
nt|mcarroll: in NT of course not this contract|pg||
nt|benjy: i would X on the north cards|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H transfers to 4 sp?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Griffiths in South overcalled 1@C with 1@D  -- how did they stop in 2N???|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h the normal contract|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, indeed.  For those who don't know it, Burns' Law says you should not play a suit where the opponents have more cards than you do.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when --- and why?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably 1N=13-15|pg||
nt|benjy: in the pass out seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: (as usual)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4C was already a transfer to 4S|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes a cue|pg||
nt|othered1: Good illustration of the impeccable judgment of the great Italians  See  how it continues.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugrapha4: With no convinient cue available Courtney bids a simple 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: playing 3@H in OR|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrdct: good news is they are only 50s|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx |pg||
nt|sybarra: you can find listings on that site|pg||
nt|peachy: if you'd like to see the teams invited, here is list  http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/entries.aspx|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kiwibridge: it's bridge Jim, but not as we know it|pg||
nt|benjy: for takeout :)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: they should go plus here, with 1c 1s 2d and 2h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if forced to balance, i think i'd try 2@S   but i'd complain about being forced|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|panja: S hand is dead from this point onwards..E does not know that yet of course...but he need not feat with @S98x in W hand|pg||
nt|panja: fear even..|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: commentators in the other room are discussing Shakespeare  -  that won't happen here|pg||
nt|athene: actually Courtney is quite a drama fan, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: impossible to find the double dummy defense of  @H, @D ruff @C to King, @C ruff|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer has a problem:|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but may have 4 losers anyway|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, he can't reach dummy to get get the @d right.|pg||
nt|henryb:  violating "Burn's Law": It is a bad idea to play in a contract there the opponents have more trumps than you do :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and Vul vs Green even worse|pg||
nt|peachy: oops, sry Shirley|pg||
nt|pef: bocchi (north) in the open room did not make a game try after a single heart raise, so this board should|pg||
nt|pef: tighten up the match|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: agression pays a dividend|pg||
nt|othered1: since west can't get a trump on the track, south would go for less than the game in @C.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: np,  at least the specs have the site :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i was doing the vugraph at the last installment of this on the Gold Coast in Australia in 2009 and everywhere you turned there was another world champion|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I am told that on Brd 5, they are in 4@s as well in OR & looks like they are going down|pg||
nt|fluffy: but probably a 2@h raise for Bocchi-Madala has a different meaning for Weichsel-Lair|pg||
nt|frankaus: good pass - dont push them into making slam|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mcarroll: N may have been contemplating a @C slam, but E doubling @S would probably stop that line of thought|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think south will find a @s lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Poorly by west with a spade lead.|pg||
nt|kemperg: lot of 9 pts opened nowadays|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
nt|frankaus: -2 now|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the OR are now on board 9 we are a bit behind|pg||
nt|rv: low @s lead might have been more challenging for declarer though South doesn't have an try to cash|pg||
nt|panja: now, one Club trick can be developed..so that makes it 8 top for E...|pg||
nt|rv: on this very reasonable lead, declarer is favorite to get home for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s+2@c+3@d+2@h|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugrapha4: Simple squeeze on Bobby in the endgame|pg||
nt|kareno: Henry you simply have to type faster :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: there was a burns law hand about this time yesterday where 4@h made 11 tricks in the 5-1 fit after a misunderstanding about splintering in partner's suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: Neat - at least one hand had a lot of trumps!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: badly with competent defense i think|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: @d continuation will disturb NS commincations|pg||
nt|kareno: East would never bid notrumps on that hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  5   Brink in 6@S South|pg||
nt|mrdct: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: She will eventually finesse spade thru opening bidder|pg||
nt|othered1: do you think west promised first round control?  Cue-bids of some in US are more ambiguous than that (I prefer true cues at high levels myself) |pg||
pc|hT|nt|baldfriede: South will switch to na @d now.|pg||
nt|mrdct: everything about this event is first class for both the players and the spectators|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|panja: easy now..|pg||
nt|panja: E has entry issues...we can see nine tricks now perhaps, E cannot be sure..|pg||
pc|cA|nt|baldfriede: a*|pg||
nt|mrdct: there is quite an advantage to finish in the top 7 from the swiss to get a double-chance in the KO stage|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct.  The bottom finishers get to play a single KO and the top ones play a double KO|pg||
nt|mrdct: but the top 15 plus Mr Yeh's team all qualify for the KO stage|pg||
nt|kareno: And I assume Mr. Yeh's team qualifies into the top group?|pg||
nt|mrdct: correct|pg||
nt|kareno: Only reasonable since he is sponsoring this great event!|pg||
nt|peachy: The prizes are spectacular as well, the winning team gets $100,000|pg||
nt|mrdct: and a lot of the teams get significant appearance money also|pg||
pc|c3|nt|baldfriede: Well done.|pg||
nt|kemperg: must have good brakes in their system|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Joe will probably duck heart Q|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: he can play @H to @HA8 catching North's QJ..but he doesn't know that keeps South away on the lie..|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: @S10 odd/even says   don't like @S  prefer @H over @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: can she duck?  (doubt it) |pg||
nt|sybarra: wow JoAnn!|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Now she is cold (assuming spade finesse)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Curtis' hand is dead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: @D guess wont help him here|pg||
nt|mrdct: needed to read the @c position first!|pg||
nt|algraves:  good defense by NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CA lead from Barel --  not sure if similar inference about @S position    might think lead Ace implies trump trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is a 32 board match played in two segments of 16|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh sorry ,  she is playing 3 nt  (my bad) |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, all E did was bid 1S and W has tried for slam, so i dont see how he could do that without first round control of clubs, or at least second round control and an even m,ore ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: massive hand|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for me the real question is whether W pas over 4N had specific implications|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am guessing it was a strong call|pg||
nt|othered1: Meanwhile, east still has some playing to do|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|panja: N will now exit with a Club|pg||
nt|panja: and what will E discard?|pg||
nt|panja: from W hand?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Peter Lund|pg||
nt|panja: N should play a cunning @H7|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: now south retains the @DK as his entry to the long @c|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrdct: @CAK, ruff @c high and draw last trump|pg||
nt|kareno: Or ace of diamonds ... etc.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: all those for drawing trumps say aye |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|baldfriede: That's it.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: but will he read it?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wygbe1: south misread the spade ten i guess|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|wygbe1: cant see why though, only the jack was missing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this match is from the "bottom 8"   i.e. loser is out of the event   the winner will play in a 3-way later today  with another winner from lower 8 and a loser from top 8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: nah -- that can't be right|pg||
nt|mrdct: this diagram shows how the KO stage works: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/results/results.aspx|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I'd back him|pg||
nt|athene: he's not going to take a club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: that would risk going down|pg||
nt|peachy: basically, the top 8 play double elimination, the bottom 8 teams single elimination|pg||
nt|sybarra: Raija, that is easier way to say it |pg||
nt|peachy: I looked at the diagram and couldn't decipher it, sorry to admit my ignorance... but there it is...|pg||
nt|othered1: that @S6 may be a stronger holding than it had appeared to be earlier|pg||
nt|chilloncan: surprised that E did not play S for diamond king on the auction|pg||
nt|frankaus: E bid a somewhat restrained 1@S - so that influenced the final contract|pg||
nt|othered1: in OR, EW sold to 5@CX, so 16 imps ride on east's play|pg||
nt|chilloncan: apparently played S to have been jacking arounf the whole time. that doesnt match my dossier on Japanese players|pg||
pc|dA|nt|baldfriede: Declarer avoided endplay for 4 down.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: so he can't fail to make 11|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: but Klinger just playing partner to follow suit when appropriate|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kareno: Ahh.. http://www.ccba.org.cn/Super/Tour/Bulletin/2011/902/Bul110418.PDF takes you to bulletin by the way.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|woozle: This game might be easier to bid when opponents open|pg||
nt|woozle: I like 2NT from Teramoto now...he's already shown the heart fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if this can only earn you a push, it will be tough to beat these Italians|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|woozle: It is tough to beat these Italians..didn't you know?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The winner goes through to tomorrow's final. The loser gets another chance in a three-way match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Duboin bid 3@C over 2@D   fast route to 4@H|pg||
nt|woozle: 4H will probably fail, unless opponents forget to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 4h isnt a great contract but it has the virtue of making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S lead from north   there goes a @D loser|pg||
nt|woozle: spade lead less likely after 2S|pg||
nt|pelu: @S-lead in CR ??:(:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Teramoto's 2@S will prevent that from happening here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|wygbe1: oops h split will get him on diam lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|woozle: Teramoto seems to be deferring the decision at every turn|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: 3NT is OK, but with the hearts foul and diamonds 5-3, he won't make it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: very nice 3N|pg||
pc|d4|nt|woozle: unless Madala talks himself out of continuing diamonds|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well i'm not saying that 3N makes, but i like Teramoto's bid to enlist partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is once he decided to bid 2@S |pg||
nt|woozle: I like 2NT on the second round, which probably leads to 4H without giving away too much info|pg||

nt|ahollan1: can't believe @SQ really scored|pg||
nt|mcarroll: -2 at worst|pg||
nt|baldfriede: At least 1 round of trumpo was encessary to stay down 2 only. Would not have hurt at all.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well read - for a 1 imp gain|pg||
nt|kareno: Nice 4@s e/w|pg||
nt|mrdct: this one will be interesting|pg||

nt|mrdct: 5 of a minor can make here if you drop the stiff @DK|pg||
nt|peachy: keep refreshing the page|pg||
nt|sybarra: start of the comeback?|pg||
nt|othered1: 5 to Japan rather than 11 to Italy|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: this could go 2 @D-3 @D |pg||
mb|1H|nt|kemperg: OR in 6@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be hotly contested|pg||
nt|kareno: n/s may compete in hearts but how high the moon?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Just another boring push :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps west opened after all|pg||
nt|mrdct: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is not the first 8 semi-solid 8 card suit of the week|pg||
nt|fluffy: I would open south's hand by 1@s, but I know my style is not very standard :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: all cards well placed for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@c is on for EW|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W passed?|pg||
nt|mrdct: or a conventional response to a strong @c opening|pg||
nt|algraves:  2NT or 3@C by NS|pg||
nt|wygbe1: down one in 5d v 4h making|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kareno: 5@c excellent e/w ... n/s can compete but it gets expensive.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: (were they Majors)|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps west's plan was to back in with an appropriate number of NTs at his next turn after the opps expectedly bid a major or two|pg||
nt|sybarra: you might be right Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: which doesn't seem such a bad plan|pg||
nt|mildredb: i'd bet he is|pg||
nt|mrdct: except if the opps don't bid before it comes back to him|pg||
nt|mrdct: and then it becomes hard to convey to partner how good he is for a passed hand|pg||
nt|mildredb: depends on what their PH bidding agreements are - but can at least spl|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: a good question asked by a kib: should inverted minors still be on by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: depends on agreements|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Depends on yr agreements|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :-)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, Mildred already said that--scroll up:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think they probably should be|pg||
nt|benjy: Sorry guys I have been asked to switch to the OR, enjoy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: whew all that for a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: this match isn't going well for one of the tournament favourites|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, 4@s appears to work well here.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 3@C  Bergen   [by passed hand??]|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Which actually works.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The horrible trump split kills it.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: is this the right auction?|pg||
nt|kareno: Operator, this cannot be right.|pg||
nt|mrdct: if EW are to reach game they will have to take a bid at some point|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@s by north maybe a psyche|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and here's another, bout time mind you|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Does everyone pass w/West hand here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no|pg||
nt|mrdct: surprised that neither west nor north found an opening bid here|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid I am enticed into bidding 5/5's|pg||
nt|mildredb: i would pass|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting. If the suits were majors, I'd open|pg||
nt|mildredb: if pard can't open, I haVE  no desire to open the auction for them to out bid me in Majors|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: well then I wld not have posed that question:)))))))))))))|pg||
nt|pef: not a very good result for north south here as four spades appears to be cold (at the other table, I mean)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'd open it 2@Ss, but that's not standard either.|pg||
nt|henryb:  14-16 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S or 3@S from Gill?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Oddly enough I think 6@S makes|pg||
nt|kemperg: works I think|pg||
nt|mrdct: the way thing sit - NS can only make 9 tricks in either major i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: or reality as we are seeing now|pg||
nt|chilloncan: while we wait for restoration, i recommend listening to Leo Kottke;s "It's So Cold in China, the birds don;t sing"|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here it would be 2@S 5 + a 5 minor 6-10|pg||
nt|chilloncan: predict heart lead|pg||
nt|othered1: almost all of a large field would get to 3N here, with various garden-variety auctions.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kareno: Not unexpected they would make if they bid it.  Italy in trouble in this match.|pg||
nt|kareno: East must bid now!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c seems a normal contract - but north will probably compete to 5@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: or 5@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6-5s are designed for defending|pg||
nt|mrdct: and nor are 7-4s|pg||
nt|kareno: There's a famous bridge adage - "6-5 come alive"|pg||
nt|kareno: Did you mean aren't designed for defending?|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sorts of hands you have in the back of your mind the risk of pushing the opps to a making slam|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed *aren't|pg||
nt|algraves:  3@S by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  @H & @S      2@D asks longer/better|pg||
nt|yuval10: not much about this one as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: And with the information provided in the auction, e/w can make six clubs by picking up diamonds - queen first.|pg||
nt|pef: that balance may let n/s back into four spades|pg||
nt|chilloncan: "almost"?|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d is good raise in @h, South's 3@c is help suit game try, East could have bid 3@s here for choice of games?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: 3@C obvious showing a heart fit, but i don't know whether he is just improvising|pg||
nt|ahollan1: showing a Limit Raise     i never remember if that is original or modified Bergen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some situations 1N is 14-16, but i think this 1N is supposed to be 15-17|pg||
nt|baldfriede: All they give off is a trump.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True indeed|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think they'll get to 4@s ok now|pg||
nt|rv: West's 3@c sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C limit is reverse bergen|pg||
nt|kareno: They need to get some IMPs on the board.  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: But declarer has nasty guesses in all suits|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south should bid 4nt instead of 5c, since n will bid clubs with equal holdings -  n came to the rescue though|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kemperg: first guess np|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This lead is helpful though.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: except @HS|pg||
nt|kemperg: even 6NT is "good":(|pg||
nt|sybarra: need the same drop of stiff K doesnt she?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will also require dropping the @DK|pg||
nt|pef: yes, a good hand for Polish style 2 bids, although I think I agree with opening 1 spade on the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: who was it said  "Any slam that makes is a good slam"?|pg||
nt|kemperg: -1|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: of course Zhejiang Huamen are amongst the favourites also|pg||
nt|mrdct: joe feeling that he's pretty much fully described his hand with 3@h so no need to say any more|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes.  I guess 1@c starts with 15.  So the auction by west was natural.|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer could ruff here and overtake the spade jack to pull trumps.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: seems the indicated line|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c ruff looming in declarer's mind|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the delay here is puzzling,but declarer is probably worried about a dummy lock after the spade ace wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: cant do wrong in @C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and second, and therefore problems vanish :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Now this is a bit disappointing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink also got @S right in the slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which would probably get you to 4@S|pg||
nt|pef: four spades is not a particulary good contract, anyway.  even with diamonds 3-3 it has lots of difficulties if e/w tap declarer with hearts|pg||
nt|chilloncan: maybe only almost if there is livestock in the large field|pg||
nt|othered1: In a large enough field, you'll always find some outliers.|pg||
nt|frankaus: in the supervised session almost all would get to 3NT :(|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: all roads lead to 4@h though|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: he gets a lucky lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: if courtney thinks west has @CA and @DKQ he will get spades wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: It's pretty well impossible for the defense to get any traction on this hand.|pg||
nt|frankaus: not many bunnies in the "field"|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi all sorry i am late for work|pg||
nt|frankaus: running scores all mathes at - http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=1&tourid=902|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome|pg||
nt|mrdct: huub bertens in the closed room for Zhejiang was on the winning netherlands team at the last instalment of this event on the Gold Coast in 2009|pg||
nt|chilloncan: thx, plane was hijacked, close shave|pg||
nt|kemperg: N is very shy here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: previous hand suggests that NS don't have "scrambling" NT calls in their arsenal|pg||
nt|othered1: now it's a matter of overtricks|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kemperg: coffee break?|pg||
nt|kemperg: what does he need ti make? |pg||
nt|frankaus: @H to safe hand now|pg||
nt|othered1: with the winning @H hook, perhaps 5 is there|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: i do understand how in context of 4-card majors it might make sense to forgoe Drury |pg||
nt|rv: old adage, lead partner's suit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: If south gives north a club ruff, then the diamond goes away.  Declarer will worry but north will be out of trumps.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: silence by S has a chance to play off|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S KQ stiff in E?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kareno: This is a count situation and I believe the jack of hearts showed three.|pg||
nt|mrdct: south trying to figure out what hand partner can have to beat this|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb:  This hand just became scary. but less scary now|pg||
nt|rv: now Duboin will play @c and should get home inspite of 4-1@h break|pg||
nt|rv: he can't misguess @cs with all of A,Q and T in South hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|mrdct: unremarkable hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mrdct: there are actual two teams from Zhejiang in the field so best to refer to this team as Huamen i guess|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Huamen Beings|pg||
nt|pef: it was better to duck the diamond, but hard for duboin to know|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to C why Duboin went for this line|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kiwibridge: the open room have lost board 6 hopefully it will turn up|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: (west is passed hand, so couldn't have the @SA too in that case)|pg||
nt|mrdct: now declarer is in total control|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kemperg: 33 or 10 or Q 2nd, best % play in @C|pg||
pc|c6|nt|panja: down now?|pg||
nt|rv: didn't cater to this eventuality, now he is likely to do down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: there we are|pg||
nt|athene: but it cost east a trick to deceive in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so it doesn't really matter|pg||
nt|athene: still making|pg||
nt|mrdct: in bridge ability they are beyond mere mortal humans|pg||
nt|fluffy: I think there are important small nuances on this bidding, south might have though that since weichsel decided to pass 1@s, he had not opening values|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kemperg: small @S to 10 now|pg||
nt|kemperg: Brink played the restricted choice|pg||
nt|pef: he might play safe for 2 now by ruffing something back to his hand, ruffing a diamond high, and now making 5 if trumps were 3-2, |pg||
nt|chilloncan: if S wins the D and plays a spade, they dont have enough tricks to beat u right away, you still have time to play hearts|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|kareno: My cat Stella enjoying the view from my lap :)  She loves bridge!!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rv: Duboin was probably afraid of @C ruff instead of catering to 4-1 @h break|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: quite a different result to the other room, 7 imps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kareno: Now back to the dummy for the second diamond play.  Declarer ignores the spade jack :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kareno: There|pg||
nt|kareno: is the dummy entry south was mourning|pg||
nt|pef: which is what he's going to do.  however this holds himself to making only 2|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mrdct: my dog is the same, but it's hard for him to control his wagging tail when he gets a good hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Stella is more sedate|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or play safe - @S to Ace, club ruff with J and 10 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so in the end -1 imp|pg||
nt|rv: he really can't test @hs and still play @Cs twice from dummy, reasonable line adopted by him though wouldn't be my choice|pg||
nt|panja: he had to cash @SAK..and play @C at once..was in wrong hand so to say...before testing trumps|pg||
nt|panja: stil..I fail to understand why N did not lead a @D|pg||
nt|rv: as saying goes, Grosvenor works:)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|baldfriede: Sometimes you lose track of best way of losing a contract because you are disappointed to lose the contract at all.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: playing the spade to the king was actually a sort of safety play, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: the point being that if you get the spade wrong, the @CA has to be right anyway|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: it was hard to see at the table, but best defense needed Mullamphy to rise @HK on 1st round of the suit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: Someone asked why not 1D (2NT). Maybe they don't play it that way. Maybe he doesn't want to play the hand in 4H with his hand face-up. Maybe the hand isn't good enough vulnerable|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Practical 1NT opening from Furuta leads briskly to 3NT|pg||
nt|woozle: Today, it's better from East, who is more likely to get a favourable lead|pg||
nt|woozle: On a spade lead, this may come down to the club guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H going down on  7|pg||
nt|woozle: club to the king...lost two clubs, a diamond and a heart|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: another Attitude lead|pg||

nt|pelu: @h 7 3? Smits Peter or distribution?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if @H7 @H3 was Smith or  just enticing declarer to continue @H|pg||
pc|s9|nt|woozle: If he's choosing between playing north for J8 or 98, maybe restricted choice favours J8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Some not so good news. We will not be showing the three-way matches in the KO 4, so this will be the last set today. No need to message me, organiser's call. Final to be broadcast ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: tomorrow as scheduled|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: the round by round scores are here http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=902|pg||

nt|henryb:  after both follow to second @d|pg||
nt|frankaus: i am sure his line was excellent |pg||
mb|1N|nt|baldfriede: So it is possible Q@s was lost at board 6.|pg||
nt|mrdct: evidently she did not so 3 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing  16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|mrdct: east has a good hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0+  maybe 4@D and 5+@C/@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the great story of Philip Grosvenor can be read here http://www.bridgebum.com/grosvenor.php/|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|athene: you might play 6@H here if you really wanted to|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm - ok, scratch that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5@S 8-11 HCP|pg||
nt|frankaus: is a wagging tail unauthorised nformation :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: @s might win the partscore battle here|pg||
nt|kemperg: and a chance for 5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: mine was too cautious|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Many would open west hand with strong NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some not so good news. I have just been told that the organizers in China have decided that they won't show matches from Knockout 4. So the 2nd half of this match will be the last ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: today. Sorry about that but this is obviously beyond BBO's control|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a sad chilling tale|pg||
nt|rv: tough to work out percentages in last deal, matters what South will open with 4-4 in minors etc, on the balance I think Duboin took a very reasonable though unfortunate line|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: YUK|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: NS playing these ultra-undisciplined weak-two bids|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS employ a lot of transfers - good modern methods|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Good 3nt for E/W here.|pg||
nt|kemperg: Versace is playing @H AK, in trouble now|pg||
nt|kareno: Operator, I think north overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|kareno: n/s have 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Three-way matches not easy to show on vugraph|pg||
nt|panja: B8 3Nt will come down to @C guess..and @CA and small will do fine..|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mrdct: south will have a few options as to how to raise @s here|pg||
nt|fluffy: running scores in http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=10&tourid=902 Israel has taken the lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: EW are in ttrouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: there is one more set after this so the gap is not insumountable|pg||
nt|mrdct: running scores: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=2&tourid=902|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like an inviational raise|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|athene: these are double edged in that if opps come in they might easily get too high|pg||
nt|athene: but of course they are also risky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Burgess sooo strong, maybe they'll be able to unravel|pg||
nt|athene: they pre-empt your side out of your own best contract too much, in my opinion|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe they get there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought i was having a flashback   just couldn't remember which decade|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1@D=4+@H's|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1@H=all hands with 3card hearts but not forcing, or some hands with 4@H's|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT is interesting|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am all for showing the @H.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me too|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like a GF variety|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: shorter auction same spot|pg||
nt|peachy: 3H might be generic game invite|pg||
nt|fluffy: if north had decided to double|pg||
nt|fluffy: wich for some shows a balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: last night one of these bids at unfavourable ended in -1100 to save 430|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be a misunderstadning here for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=game force  in this case  8-11 or 15+ HCP and 3 places to play|pg||
nt|mrdct: west doesn't|pg||
nt|pef: curious.  normally double by north would show a hand that was a balanced strong nt of some variety.  I wonder why he didn't do that|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|athene: burgess takes the low road|pg||
nt|chilloncan: one does open 1D when dictated by a draconian system, but the undfettered heart yearns to open the eponymous 1H|pg||
nt|mrdct: or not|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps vugraph mistake? the bidding might be a kokish 2@c-pass-2@d-pass-2@h-pass-2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: Gosney would like to pass the 1@H but 18-19NT with 3 hearts would also bid 1@H so he's constrained to bid 1NT|pg||
nt|baldfriede: If you have both majors, show them, even if you have a fit in one.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2nt showed an invitational raise with 4 spades.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C= (54)/55  @C & @D  or  4@D & 6@C|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@h might help south diagnose the wasted values in @h and stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|pef: I wonder if it was actually south that bid 2d and this is a kokish auction|pg||
nt|chilloncan: interesting EW auction here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: perhaps just a little bit cautious|pg||
nt|andy_h: I suspect that 2@C or 2@D by Gosney would be artificial (aka xyz)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C clarified short @C or @D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: he may suspect that|pg||
nt|pef: but north doesn't really have a kokish hand, only a 2nt rebid, so I am confused|pg||
nt|fluffy: :) though the same, but the 3@d is onconsistent with kokish, so the bidding must be right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the pass over 2@D was alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but he does have weak trumps |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@H shows 4  [support dbl situation??]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy 3@H bid seems to support that guess|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: grab a coffee everyone :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=1@D 3@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  One issue for everyone to think about is whether 2@s promises a six card suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: not in 2/1 i believe|pg||
nt|chilloncan: maybe 2C-2D-2N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: but 2NT looks OK with everything stopped nicely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N = to play if 8-11 HCP|pg||
nt|mrdct: opportunity for a non-vul game swing for japan|pg||
nt|mrdct: this looks doomed for 2@d, 1@h and 1@c to lose|pg||
nt|pef: probably double by lair would have been a second negative so the pass was game forcing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if not it should|pg||
nt|henryb:  One school says yes. another says it is a catch-all for minumum unbalanced hands, and that a bid of 3 of a minor shows extra values (or extra distribution)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: and the @d7 is now going to come into play|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice system, W was not interested|pg||
nt|kemperg: East|pg||
nt|panja: operator, what does 2@H show, could you check please?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: still 6@H should have some play? especially with the lead coming up to those luscious minor suits|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@h apparently like Kokish, showing great extras.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT also promises 4@s curtis cheek tells me|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: In OR they wer ein 5@d, dropping stiff K|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to get the @D on the table|pg||
nt|pef: well they got to a safe spot|pg||
nt|rv: with East hand B-D used to play 3@s to show 4@h non-slammish hand and choice of game between 3n and 4@h|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: the auction didn't reveal whether 5@S & 4@H   or   5@H & 4@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: kokish style here it seems|pg||
nt|wygbe1: e took a flyer here = got lucky to find no club waste, got unlucky for 3 finesses to lose|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: well read|pg||
nt|kemperg: well bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is on board 6 -- but i bet they don't repeat our auction|pg||
nt|fluffy: sementa might decide to duck this|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think this will end in tears for EW with 3NT going down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: the other room is bidding  7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: half our audience are commentators obviously enthralled by the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: anything happening Catherine?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ish is thinking... of dinner perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: his thoughts won't help him on this board|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: not a good advertisement|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, for all that fabulous east hand I think they are overboard already|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4D ok i thinl|pg||
nt|mrdct: although on a @d lead from south he might scramble a 9th trick in @s before NS wake up to their cashing @h tricks|pg||
nt|chilloncan: oh wait, W would be declarer sprry|pg||
nt|kareno: West looking for a potted palm to hide behind|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm afraid i can't give much insight here as to what either east or west has shown|pg||
nt|mrdct: i've got one right here for him|pg||
nt|kareno: I think east has shown a massive club hand with a spade side suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: What do 3@H mean from E now? Sr for interrupting|pg||
nt|chilloncan: was 1H a GF?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  3N a bit unexpected    1@H denies game force|pg||
nt|fluffy: to keep comunications open|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: our esteemed bulletin editor watching live confirms Sementa bid 2@D|pg||
nt|fluffy: wich results on 13 tricks|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry 12|pg||
nt|henryb:  all within the context of 2/1 game forcing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in some systems it's a good weak two|pg||
nt|rv: the idea is to not help defense in giving information about declarer's hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mcarroll: only 2 Aces to lose in this - or indeed almost any other - contract|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 10|pg||
nt|pef: strange duck lookng at that dummy,  I'm sure he claimed 12 tricks, not 10|pg||
nt|pef: I think this was really an imp to north/south, not east/west|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Thiss should make 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: even after P-2N  probably still won't get to slam, but may sniff at it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: NS play Reverse Smith vs NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: north won't like weak @S  and 5422    south won't like minor suit queens|pg||
nt|mrdct: i suspect it's a relay asking west to tell him more|pg||
nt|rv: I might have just bid 3n on 1n with 4333 though|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: well, of course you would rather have the @SQ, but the minor-suit queens aren't useless|pg||
nt|athene: they stop the defence setting up any trick in a minor on the lead|pg||
nt|athene: so you can afford to lose the lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: try singleton to protect @SQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right before the 4@H bid was posted, i was about to ask if East was going to PASS or invite with 3@H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kemperg: No Ron went for the possible 41, better|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Belive they had relay|pg||
nt|kareno: As I've seen it used here this week, 1@h creates a force to game.|pg||
nt|mrdct: west may have had a different idea|pg||
nt|yuval10: i love the catch-all thing, that's how i play it to be honest|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: although i assume it's curtis' lovely wife phyllis signed in under his name :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did Dyke do well not to mention @S   or was he lucky??|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am wondering whether E really has a GF|pg||
nt|mrdct: it looks like a GF to me|pg||
nt|chilloncan: his suit is a minor, he has only 2 aces and a big NT flawm etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or should say  "tends to deny"|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panja: @C guess..it is going to be...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: may make only 10 tricks  @D @D|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mrdct: just a shame west didn't come to party with anything to help him|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, using losing trick count, he has two losers.  And 5 1/2 QT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some not so good news. We will not be showing the three-way matches in the KO 4, so this will be the last set today. No need to message me, organiser's call. Final to be broadcast ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow as scheduled|pg||
nt|rv: even misguess he will survive |pg||
nt|panja: he might play @SK and finesse|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Roland, a night off guys :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a shame none the less :(|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: yes -- i'm just saying it will slow down any mild attempt to get to slam|pg||
nt|chilloncan: of course, if he has no forcing sequence available to show a strong but not GF unbalanced hand, there may be no practical alternative|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: more imps likely for Huamen with partscore looking to make in both rooms|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute -- i didn't think about immediate duck|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: no |pg||
nt|henryb:  As I say, there is a difference of opinion. |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcarroll: This is EW doing to NS what they did on board 4 - running long minor|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andy_h: North could have risen with the @CA to take the contract 2 off given the (un)lucky layout of the diamonds|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: either way -- a bit surprised that he sold out to 3@H when partner "freely" bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that was weakest way for Gill to bid  [other than PASS]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this is a great result for Morris Chang|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|algraves:  a good play by east as it shut out the hearts if they were 5-3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andy_h: But nevertheless, one is always happy to take any contract off|pg||
pc|s7|nt|algraves:  giving some extra options in the end game|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kemperg: perhaps thats why he didn't dare to bid 2NT|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|algraves:  so he has to guess the end position here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rv: 3 way matches played with turner movement (followed in BAM usually) and somehow organizers are loath to allow kibitzers or broadcast those matches|pg||
nt|panja: I wonder whether S exposed his side by playing a @D...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h6|nt|panja: a @S might have worked much better|pg||

pc|c2|nt|woozle: nice obligatory falsecard from Teramoto with the HT, feigning AT doubleton|pg||
nt|woozle: quite a grand deception, really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Japan got through to this stage after winning against USA Hampson on total points. The match ended 54-54 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure I like a total point decision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Extra boards rather|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the conditions of contest actually talk about how to break the tie if total points still equal|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is the richest money tournament (prizewise) in the world. The prize pool exceeds US$200,000 with 100,000 to the winner + royalties such as expenses covered|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Ish gaine an imp bless him|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s makes here for N/S.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it this was back in college   we'd say   down 1 is good bridge|pg||
nt|panja: it always is, at least you tried a game...|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S here for NS|pg||
nt|panja: only 18 HCP..9-card fit..and @D stiff opposite no wasted values..30 HCP pack|pg||
nt|panja: no...on wrong @C guess..@HA would have got stranded too|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|athene: so i guess it would be going down in practice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 3+  but still transfer responses|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not many boards are left, time's running out for the Brown team. A 14imp was swung on board 19 where the failing grand (due to 4-1 break) was not bid in the other room|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: good start for a final set for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d for NS here|pg||
nt|kemperg: fireworks here?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: We have a slam here, but it has to be played carefully to make.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s the limit for EW here|pg||
nt|kareno: China picked up 11 on the 4@s hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: precision 1@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats 41 unanswered imps Lavazza on a roll|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mrdct: precision style 2@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: obviously if E had a major it would be a GF. with a minor it is certainly close with 3 losers |pg||

nt|yuval10: 2NT now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||

nt|mrdct: might be difficult for EW to get into the auction now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D  Forcing 1 round?|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|athene: south needs a raise to do that|pg||
nt|athene: but there we are :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This 2nt bid should be a help.|pg||
nt|kemperg: was my bid too, not yours?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: doesn't have a weak 2@H bid available|pg||
nt|peachy: 1@D again all-purpose|pg||
nt|henryb:  Over 2N I would play 3@d = forcing with @s, 3@h = strong raise to 4@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: with the @HA with the singleton @d, the defence can only lead trumps once|pg||
nt|baldfriede: My bid too, but it helps nevertheless.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C fit, invite+ ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: it certianly looks tempting now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: certainly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Raptor NT overcalls -- so DBL is needed to cover Strong NT |pg||
nt|panja: should be|pg||
nt|yuval10: Gitelman and Hampson went too high and that gave Japan 12 imps|pg||
nt|chilloncan: art GF i am guessing|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mrdct: 2@h is about the limit for NS here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h looks like a splinter agreeing @d|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@C now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @s is the better slam.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1S = no major?|pg||
nt|kareno: Double here would be takeout with primary diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: But it is always risky to balance into the opponents' misfit auction.|pg||
nt|algraves:  actually not for anybody|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h will be hard work here with this trump break|pg||
nt|yuval10: @@ board 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@c - anyone know what this is?  Better than 1nt?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hods allow quasi-2N hands to peter out in playable spots|pg||
nt|mrdct: although the @d position is quite favourable|pg||
nt|kareno: Good screech to a stop!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay it shows 18-19 balanced, thanks.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm alway a bit nervous about splintering with a stiff king|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like OR may be in time trouble - only 6 boards played|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Another 3nt.|pg||
nt|kemperg: evereybodys choice 1@S?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes for me|pg||
nt|jcwla: And might not make it if did.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: true|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: he has a choice in trumps, whether to lead the @DJ to pin the ten|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like 9 tricks i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry start of my message was deleted by gremlins:  flexible methods allow....|pg||
nt|mrdct: draw trumps finishing in dummy and take @d hook|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to get to this spot by many methods|pg||
nt|kareno: Note that with JTx of trumps, it is correct to lead small in case partner has queen or king.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds friendly!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: friendly but not passionate. if 8 and 7 interposed, then passionate|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if it is clear that it is a misfit, not sure that is so here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a steal for EW|pg||
nt|pef: a double partscore swing on this hand to the lavazza team.  n/s played and made 3c in the open room and 2h will most likely make 3 here unless north/south find their diamond ruff|pg||
nt|fluffy: Sementa had to pick between 2@h and 2@d rebid, he picked the best one in no time|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: e.g. @SQ K A, diamond to queen|pg||
nt|mrdct: and even more nervous splintering in a suit shown by partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@S,   1N would show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and even if so, collect 50s with possible game your way if NS are really having u on|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: even if hiroki gets trumps right, might still lose 2@s, 1@c and 1@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence have 6 top tricks here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear|pg||
nt|kemperg: for me 5@H's + 4+ minor, |pg||
nt|kemperg: It is for my partner:(|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS did well not to go to 5@h, which goes down 4 on a singel @d lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks like a strong club going wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: 4@S looks to be the limit here, unless declarer takes a view on the clubs|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a very aggressive double of 3@D by Gosney|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: too true! Still, if he passed, West would X himself|pg||
nt|andy_h: Certainly a nice partner to provide him with four keycards!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In this vulnerability yes.|pg||
nt|jcwla: NT is a home not a refuge.|pg||
nt|mrdct: but the @H8 could turn out to be useful card to play trumps for one loser - let's see|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard to imagine Venky|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|baldfriede: Ruff out a small @h in @s slam to make.|pg||
nt|kemperg: I dont play semiforcing 2 openings, but still I doubt on 1@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: -2 imps|pg||
nt|pef: normal to rebid a good 6 card major over a four card minor with a minimum hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Instead of KO4 we are contemplating a match between the we-are-so-clever-when-seeing-all-the-hands commentators|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then it's specs' turn to laugh|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm game Roland|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: can he find 8 tricks here?   my bet more likely down 2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice bidding as 4@H is destined to go down despite the 4-4 fit, at least 2@H, 1@S and a @C ruff|pg||
nt|kareno: Suit preference is my guess on the @c q|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: west may drop the @D8|pg||
nt|mrdct: as does declarer|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT had a play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that might balance NS into game|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: on 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: choosing between 3 nt and 4 hts no doubt|pg||
nt|sybarra: or has sementa described his shape? and is 5 @C an option?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont think W has given up on slam jut yet|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can probably surmise exact suit distribution though|pg||
nt|athene: trying to look like a man with @D108 doubleton|pg||
nt|kemperg: contract or 1 up the same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope -- escaped THAT bullet|pg||
nt|yuval10: it turned out to be that West had only waisted values ( speaking of board 6 )|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bg: signals crossed here so much for fancy bids|pg||
nt|pef: I'm told by barry rigal, that Lair's scorecard does say 490 on board 8, so the score is really 16 to 7 here, not 17 to 6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: the question being   is West  5332 or 5422|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he went wrong right away|pg||
nt|mrdct: and i assume 3@d showed a red 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HK for down 2   maybe duck = down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't really apply, but just made me think of     Lee Trevino: the more i practice, the luckier i get|pg||
nt|kemperg: he's on line now, but IN OR I hope|pg||
nt|algraves:  declarer now has nine tricks by building diamond|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think that was Gary Player Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd accept it from any of that group o' greats|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: singleton @c may have been a better lead for the defence, but often when holding trump length you aren't looking for ruffs|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he hoped for the added advantage that east might not cover with @DKx|pg||
nt|athene: he will put south with five diamonds at least for the overcall|pg||
nt|athene: so he won't think his partner could have @D10xx|pg||
nt|kemperg: happiness is a long walk with a putter, that was Trevino|pg||
nt|rv: in my opinion, Japan has performed way above expectations to get to finals of upper section of draw, they still have a chance in 3-way match this afternoon to have another bite at ...|pg||
nt|rv: Lavazza|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kemperg: @D start gives leader a lot to think about|pg||
nt|kareno: Unlikely to lose a diamond.|pg||
nt|kareno: Now he'll probably finesse the heart into the safe, north hand.|pg||
nt|mrdct: live scores http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=6&tourid=902|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1S worked well|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kemperg: not my happiness, i have to play without a caddy:(|pg||
nt|mrdct: but quite reasonably curtis takes the standard combination here and will slide one or two off now|pg||
nt|sybarra: E got into the "swing" of things|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|algraves:  west would be squeezed in majors even without the QJ dbt in clubs|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the general rule i have in most of my partnerships is that you can never splinter in a suit partner has shown|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was 1@S alerted? TD can come.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: has to play fot 2 singletons!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: *"O"|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panja: this is how HCP strength can misguide|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kemperg: gets the @D count, so 65 known|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe west should dbl 1@s - i wonder if they have an agreement for that|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1S maybe not conventional...maybe just a potshot|pg||
nt|kareno: If they have no agreement, south can bid what he likes.  If he OFTEN bids a major with three, then that constitutes an agreement.|pg||
nt|mrdct: a good thing to discuss with your partner as you will come across 1@c:1@s=no major more and more frequently these days and should have an agreement about the dbl|pg||
nt|ianmcc: asking to be raised?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: when NV vs vuk and a weak hand, sometimes a 3 card major short in the other one can be a good tactical move. dangerous of course but viable risk reward ratio at the colors|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|andy_h: Yeap had he passed then the same contract would be reached, although probably played by Gosney|pg||
pc|s2|nt|baldfriede: Not really; what else is there but to ruff? And after the first trump everything is clear.|pg||
nt|mrdct: west gets his cake and eats in too|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: one more after this and a restart in 30 mins from now, thanks Xu on Vugraph, Jordan, Ian, Germ, all specs for your greatfeedback, the CCBA and Roland and BBO and special thanks to ...|pg||

nt|kemperg: thanks all, time for me to get a breakfast|pg||
nt|rv: declarer is a trick short here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: could take the @D8 too on a trump promo now if they wanted|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 tricks will double Lavazza's imp total|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d might be difficult to bid - so making 4@h here might square the board|pg||
nt|bg: good place for the    ASBAF system  "All Strange Bids Are Forcing"|pg||
nt|kareno: ????|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: and 10 tricks will treble it!|pg||
nt|kareno: And that can be made.|pg||

nt|rv: partnership|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcarroll: mnow has to hope that trumps are not 5-1|pg||

nt|mcarroll: sorry, 5-0|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Dave, welcome|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chilloncan: welcome ian|pg||
nt|mrdct: well that didn't go well for the defence|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi. Not top defence|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Actually he had 9 tricks from the beginning with the @CQJ falling, |pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: it wouldn't matter though; the club loser would go away|pg||
nt|athene: it's just one down whatever route you take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room   8 [where we wondered about Courtney's 2@S opener]    DeLivera opened 2@H showing weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|andy_h: So I guess in a way he was generous enough to let partner play|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: richman just better make sure he doesn't get himself endplayed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS lead low from doubleton -- apparently that also applies in middle of hand|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: The Italians are super stars in the mould of their great predecessors Garozzo, Belladonna etc, true legends of the game|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: and he can score the beer card now|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes I meant single dummy from declarers point of veiw|pg||
nt|mrdct: problem with a cross-ruff is you shortern trumps in 2 hands and then run the risk of losing control if trumps 4-1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct: no - blew it|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rv: declarer could have scored if he had @s before playing @ds|pg||
pc|h6|nt|baldfriede: No slam so far.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: squeezing south down to all winners|pg||
nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kareno: Safe?|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: GORGEOUSO!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: definitely 6@H from south is better|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: i've heard that the list of competitors for the 2011 cavendish is already posted|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Close to 1 million?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i just know it has been down the last couple of years|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: the last 3-4 years +/- 1 mil $|pg||
nt|woozle: Madala chooses that this isn't the moment for a light 1NT overcall...I fear that he wouldn't have enjoyed the play|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last hand of the 9th round --  10th and final round of the Swiss Qualifying scheduled to begin in about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board of the session, thans to Martin, Frank, Allen ,Al and our operator XU|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@S or 5@D both good games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: matchups are already set -- but we don't know which match will be on vugraph|pg||
nt|kemperg: as expected with Brink Drijver OR will last a little longer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much chance for excitement here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: darn -- i was still trying to figure out if 4@S makes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now 22-7|pg||
nt|mrdct: the winner of this match goes stright into the final and the loser goes into a 3-way match to decide the other finalist|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: but the opening bid was 2@H North|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: that's what i mean - once you know north will be playing it, i think that tips it against bidding it|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that's what I meant, Dave.|pg||
nt|frankaus: last now -  its a educational  to see that the best of teams can have a big loss - tu all for your company|pg||
nt|chilloncan: np shirley, sometimes the earth moves:)|pg||

nt|chilloncan: if you are going to produce an ungainly defence, let it be to a partscore....a sign you are in heat one  and a half:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: most matches scored through 6 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15, 4+@S   could be 4@S and any 5+suit   never 5@S & 5@H|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S should be cold..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: kibs say makes 3@H if plays A and another|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT should be interesting here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: just enough time to maake my breakfast|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Custer's Last Hand, thanks to all|pg||
nt|algraves:  good 3@C bid by south against Canape systems|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h is on here for EW|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: heavy 1nt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no excitement here either|pg||
nt|mrdct: @h partial for NS here - don't think game will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0+  maybe canape into @C/@S   1@S=3+@S  less than game force|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to our operator and to the specs for keeping us on our toes :)  Also to Dave Thompson who is soaking up the rays in Phuket, Thailand :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: good choice to open 1NT rather than 1@h to stop the opps from having an easy 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|mrdct: transfer to @d i presume|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS could get in trouble if they decide to compete|pg||
nt|henryb:  Looks like excessive duplication of values that were not discovered soon enouhg, and bad luck that both aces were off side|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: people often push the upper limit for 1nt overcall over 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: over 1@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s likely to fail here|pg||
nt|kareno: Almost certainly with any reasonable defense.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@D just makeble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep   lose 1@C 1@D and either  1@H or 1@S, but not both|pg||
nt|mrdct: serious Burns' Law violation here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a 6@H we'd bid easily without seeing all the cards, right Roland?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|baldfriede: And I am Friederike Greifswald-Tolleson.|pg||
nt|mrdct: west knows what to lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another hand with total trump = 20    who shuffled?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-8 HCP, @H or @S  --  no strong options|pg||
nt|mrdct: might collect a few hundreds in 3@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: or 500 in 3@sx|pg||
nt|mrdct: will south pass?|pg||
nt|frankaus: tough choice for V.P.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the reason is they don't want to double and have to rebid 2nt facing a possible zero|pg||
nt|frankaus: can they stay pot of 4@S?|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@d maybe a general GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but you can easily miss games doing this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically 1N was 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: courtney might try 3nt now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: 3@C weak  weak 2@H|pg||
nt|kareno: West happy|pg||
nt|mrdct: west liking his prospects|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I can think of a lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@D i prefer instead of pass|pg||
nt|rv: 11 easy tricks in 4@h, flat board exactly what Lavazza wants at this stage|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: why?   Burgess has only confirmed 13 cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: helpful lead still a lot of work for Ish hope his brain still aware after all that thinking earlier|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he is alert and focussed we are told :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we welcome Ian McCance |pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great to have you Ian|pg||
nt|andy_h: Nice 5@H bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: nef X by W perhas describable as...optional|pg||
nt|frankaus: out of 4@S|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Thanks to all who made this event possible: The organizers, our excellent operator, my co-commentators Martin Carrooll and Al Hollander and of course the indefatigable Roland Wald.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Martin Carroll*|pg||
nt|mrdct: good lead for declarer|pg||
nt|algraves:  jocleyed them into the third best game with a bad trump break|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec says 4@H in EW|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: progress on all matches here http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResultKnockout.aspx?section=b6b714a8-e406-4ec7-bdb2-fd1c39596dce&round=2&tourid=902|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: but that would be a bit wild since south can't have much to pass 2@H and will usually have a lot less than he has|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Bobby gave X a couple seconds of thought|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @d now and if he ducks the roof could fall in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes @C's are ominous|pg||
nt|mrdct: might need to guess @d right here to make so a chance for lavazza|pg||

nt|baldfriede: This will godown 1 no matter what.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: spec suggests 6N better no @D ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: or form of NMF|pg||
nt|panja: the only better spot than 1@S PPP for NS is 5@D dbl -1|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finally  a long @C suit is running|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS turning a plus score into a minus score|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Thanks to all who made this event possible: The organizers, our excellent operator, my co-commentators Frank Budal, Martin Carroll and Germ Kemper and of course the indefatigable ...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Roland Wald.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h fast arrival with no extra values|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: do you think South is in lebensohl situation where 3@D showed some values?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if south happens to have nothing, 3nt is getting doubled and so is 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think 2N is scramble rather than lebensohl|pg||
nt|kemperg: they did:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: but bad news coming soon|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andy_h: Although declarer still has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|andy_h: If trumps are 3-1, provided that the defenders duck a round of clubs, there is no entry to dummy to enjoy the clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if Ginossar bids only 2@C -- wouldn't be surprised to see others in 4@H|pg||
nt|algraves:  needs 6 trump tricks to go with 4outside tricks|pg||
nt|algraves:  or finessse spade and take 5 trump tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: you might argue that with some values, south must do something over 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: unless he has a penalty pass of course, but he hasn't got that|pg||
nt|athene: so when he passes and then pulls the double, he is showing a pretty weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: of course there will be times when you would like leb to be on in these situations|pg||
nt|athene: but i think in general it's better to play 2nt as scramble|pg||
nt|mrdct: @SJ here to show the @HK|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|andy_h: However, given that West holds the singleton queen of trumps, a good guess in clubs would see the contract for one off. If Gosney ducks the first round of trumps, declarer will ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: then be able to ruff his two little spades. If Gosney takes it with the Ace and returns a trump, declarer then guess the clubs|pg||
nt|mrdct: @sJ might score a trick here|pg||
nt|kareno: Good idea to continue now :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: which one?|pg||
nt|kareno: Small for sure - suit preference.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at K108 in hand and Q9 in dummy - west may not think east likely to be able to beat the @S9|pg||
nt|kareno: As long as east has a trump that works.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might more important. 3@D=bergen raise? E a bit mad? Then S might got the signals needed.|pg||
nt|mrdct: oh - low @d at trick 2!|pg||
nt|kareno: eek!|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yuck|pg||
nt|mrdct: @DJ and extravagent card to play at trick one perhaps|pg||
nt|kareno: West had better duck the spade now.|pg||
nt|mrdct: but this looks a very high risk defence by west which surely has an easy beat just pumping out @d from the top|pg||
nt|ianmcc: do they play udc? or by ear?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: one rarely gets the defense right after an early debacle such as we have jut witnesed|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I agree.  But still the low diamond is risky in case of this holding.|pg||
nt|kareno: I hear e/w playing 5@h doubled in the OR|pg||
pc|h7|nt|braunstar: Hey all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: disaster avoided|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hey Daniel|pg||
nt|braunstar: It seems Hans have built a nice lead into this last set|pg||
nt|braunstar: Does anyone know the results of the other match?|pg||
nt|mrdct: once north shows up with the @sA, the odds might favour south holding the other missing ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sometimes it DOESN'T??|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with 10 LTC and bad spades, W can pass... no game unless E can act  at almost any subgame level, in which case W wll have all values in reserve and can do the needful|pg||
nt|kareno: Still a vulnerable overcall ..|pg||
nt|mrdct: but when north turns up with the @sA, what has south got for his vul 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: gmta Dave|pg||
nt|frankaus: oh well -1 is good bridge (some say)|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps planning to take ruffs with the long @d|pg||
nt|algraves:  which I think he can just do|pg||
nt|pef: 2 hearts here was probably a two-way bid.  either balanced 11-12 or strong with hearts.  Fairly common usage.  We saw the other common usage of 2h being weakish with 5 spades and ...|pg||
nt|pef: 4+ hearts earlier|pg||
nt|mrdct: great @d pips for the defence so when north gets in a trump through will hurt declarer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: it was out of reach obviously with S in control|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mrdct: last board of the match here|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thanks all, see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks Gary and all.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: cheers again all see you in the next round|pg||
nt|ianmcc: txall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but a good win to JiangSu here well deserved in the end|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: 5th and final round of the day scheduled to begin at 10 past the hour --- approx 35 minutes|pg||
nt|kemperg: not anymore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if @H will split poorly in the other room|pg||
nt|algraves:  no 3-3 in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with King onside|pg||
nt|algraves:  so this line needed 4-2 hearts or 7=2 clubs|pg||
nt|algraves:  and was clearly best|pg||
nt|algraves:  bad luck|pg||
nt|frankaus: running scores all matches at  - http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=9&tourid=902|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The Great Shuffler strikes again|pg||
nt|algraves:  now he must lose two more hearts if North forces him in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Pachtmann contemplating non-@C shift?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bocchi down in 3N on 9 11 to Japan|pg||
pc|c2|nt|frankaus: the presire card found|pg||
nt|frankaus: presure|pg||
nt|algraves:  hmm|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: Ish taking his 6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, one of the seldom acknowledged -- at ;east by the busy bidders -- disadvantages of the busy-bid style, is that declarer can then all too often place all cards early, ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ESPECIALLY if the overcall is raised. and if it hurts your side to have your overcall raised, maybe it isnt the best idea |pg||
nt|kareno: Well done for the push|pg||
nt|mrdct: so making this may not be enough to win the board if 5@hx goes for 800|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: must be a lot of Fred fans in the other room 1500 there and 2 here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: does Mullamphy EVER claim?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was 105-59 to Courtney|pg||
nt|mrdct: good @d play by south to put declarer to the guess before he has discovery of the @SA and @HQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: worrying that @C will allow Verhees to elope his small trumpm|pg||
nt|mrdct: new leader if this goes 3 down|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: it's easy to see they might reach 3n on this hand in the other room though|pg||
nt|athene: east must duck the second diamond to kill the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  West's 3rd seat opener is not automatic by any means|pg||
nt|rv: oflate Roland is very quite on commenting on dodgy slams|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mrdct: as it happens - 6@h is cold here with @d 3-3 to pitch the losing @s before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i'd be surprised if many bid it|pg||
nt|mrdct: but those who do will make it|pg||
nt|mrdct: i believe lavazza's carry over is 6.5 imps (the half imp to avoid ties) so always add 0.5 to Lavazza's score if this match goes down to the wire|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: Thanks all see some of you in 20 mins|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tommorrow the real excitement starts with the KO rounds|pg||
nt|pef: hard to make 3nt at this point, I think that's his best shot other than completely double dummy|pg||
nt|pef: he'll have to read the card's well if duboin exits with a heart here.  he might take the diamond finesse and go down|pg||
nt|pef: but I think mark will get it right|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: N&S both have winners|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: even if west does open, north might double then bid notrumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: W overtook the @c to break a possible squeeze|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|frankaus: bye all|pg||
nt|chilloncan: incidentally, my comments are not critiques from the other side, i am a very bisy bidder and am acknowledging the downside of that policy|pg||
nt|ritong: BACK IN 15 MINUTES OR SO|pg||
nt|ritong: oops|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  the last 5 10-board matches in the Swiss Qualifying   top 15 and  1 seed Yeh Bros then advance to KO phase|pg||
nt|mrdct: declarer going well so far|pg||
nt|pef: now he has to decide whether sementa ducked the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer might go for the @h finesse now and will go down 3|pg||

nt|andy_h: A problematic hand for Edgtton|pg||
nt|pef: I bet sementa just bids a game here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: np so he was -1 5 more to Neill|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the gap down to 18|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@c by north will probably make but by south a @s lead will beat it i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: talk about 3N & NS saves in 4@H   --  the only time i played against the great PO Sundelin was in matchpoint event -- and he realized 4N was better than doubling -- until then i'd ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only seen that happen in books|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Panja, down to the stayers Venky|pg||
nt|rv: 2@h is @h+minor possibly, many play woolsey or capp convention|pg||
nt|rv: combined hands, 4@h is a make, fitting cards|pg||
nt|rv: best lead for defense, Duboin should play 3 rounds of @s and hop with @hA and play 4th @s, still declarer can get home by ruffing high|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm rather peeved that this is the end for the day, as I'm sure the spectators are, it's a shame|pg||
nt|rv: nearly impossible to bid though, North can bid 2@d (if playing woolsey) as single suit major, still can't either North or South or bidding to 3 level, single dummy can't see a way ...|pg||
nt|rv: to bid game |pg||
pc|s8|nt|yuval10: hello Allen|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mrdct: what's this double mean?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm sure security can be guaranteed in this day and age if that really was their concern|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pef: and I bet duboin makes 3nt|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: the women started with Board  8 so they've already played our remaining hands of the set|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think either 2@H or 2@S is fair enough|pg||
nt|andy_h: Partner's double doesn't promise 10+ points so 2NT may not be so good when a 5-3 spade fit is available|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: the penalty x has vanished from the game|pg||
nt|pef: he's going to take a diamond, 4 clubs, 3 hearts, and a spade I would think|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW sold out here a bit too quickly with their 9-cards @c fit|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: notice that the side with top 5 @S cards is the side that never bid the suit|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps DSIP, I'm max|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|peachy: I have no idea, was guessing|pg||
nt|mrdct: only 3 losers, but declarer will need a few ruffs and the defence is on the right track with a trump lead|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 2C=Majors|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: X=extras|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: However, it still makes little sense to me|pg||
nt|panja: E bid 1Nt first time..because that was the normal thing to do..|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|athene: i suppose north felt he didn't have the playing strength for 1nt|pg||
nt|mrdct: where are the extras? and she doesn't have 5@h|pg||
nt|panja: BAL hand, 8+ HCP..and a H check...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vdoubleu: That's what I was thinking|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Cannot understand it|pg||
nt|peachy: Not yet time for 'state of the match' 4H|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pef: I may amend that to 2 spades and no diamonds :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: certainly it is a fairly poor 15|pg||
nt|yuval10: a 2NT good-bad from W looks sensible|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mrdct: another interesting point on this hand is should 2NT still be lebensohl over the 2@h bid?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think south with cash a @c honour and then play @HA and another|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: How many tricks will Lew take once Curtis gets on & plays A + another heart? |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 9?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: assuming he does here|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks like 9 to me, 4@H, 1@S, 4@D|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: there will a late @c loser in the wash i think and declarer can only ruff one|pg||
nt|mrdct: joe grue's original trump lead is now look pretty good|pg||
nt|mildredb: curtis doesn't know about @S situation - probably worrying about that|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: south know partner doesn't have much in @c so he's kind of marked with something in @s for the 3@c bid|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Curtis is thinking about whole hand here & what Mildred says is the reason he has not played a card yet--the spade suit|pg||
nt|mildredb: but could be @SK|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|mildredb: @CQJ|pg||
nt|mildredb: can't see what he can do about it if that is the case|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Right, so being IMPs, go for the beat|pg||
nt|panja: but the kind of @H check he has is not suitable for a Nt contract...|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps he might be able to give north a @d ruff now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other matches, no trailing team has taken the lead  [but not sure how many hands scored]|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: looked more like 13 to me|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: hmmm|pg||
nt|mildredb: yep|pg||
nt|panja: that is why, after the dbl of 3@H...he had to go back to the drawing board...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps 2@S and a @d.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|mrdct: but seems unlikely as joe might have lead a stiff @D|pg||

nt|pef: this looks like a normal 3nt|pg||
mb|2H|nt|panja: good situation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that start will slow down LIN|pg||
nt|rv: in OR, E-W got active enabling South to compete again with 3@h and North raised to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the cards are not generating, I saw in set one , one match had 0 imps diff after 16, the other had +2|pg||
nt|panja: he should just bid 3Nt|pg||
nt|pef: 2 hearts is limit raise or better in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = no 4+major|pg||
nt|athene: you need to discuss if x of these transfer responses = the suit bid or t/o of the suit shown|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = artificia  10-12 HCP, not 4+@H/@S|pg||
nt|andy_h: yes, after board 18 and 19 which could be potential minus scores I think Brown has to double. I mean, he has an Ace and 5 trumps and partner has overcalled 2@D!|pg||
nt|braunstar: 4s the spot here|pg||
nt|sybarra: no over call?|pg||
nt|rv: unless E-W get active it was tough to get to game in last deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: this will sac|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@D was xfer of course|pg||
pc|d8|nt|algraves:  what system do the Japanese play ?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: 3N needs more than 1 trick from partner -- that seems like too much to ask|pg||
nt|panja: this bidding got his suit out, but not his strength|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: with xxx in @D N probably feels its a bit shakey to come |pg||
nt|sybarra: *come in|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: south didn't quite have a X even if it was t/o, though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can they cash 3 aces?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: can an ace go away?|pg||
nt|frankaus: red 4333  - 3 level  far too hard to come in|pg||
nt|rv: well judged by D-S to stop at safe level, too much wastage in @s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: some pairs specifically say 1@S = 4+@D   which fits in with Griffiths-Richman use of 1@C-1N as natural 6-11|pg||
nt|athene: entry to the diamonds getting taken out so declarer will have to play on clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but a spade shift gives the defence far too many tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Spade switch from Burgo may make the hand easier for Nye|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL  2@D was any min -- doesn't seem that DBL affected the auction|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes|pg||
nt|braunstar: heart lead will help here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c might be the stayman convention|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mwigor: either round suit ace can go if the other is cashed|pg||
nt|andy_h: I guess 3@H is some sort of spade raise?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: we're all guessing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he does have 6 losers [assuming @S has 1 loser]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems like a very reasonable evaluation |pg||
nt|yuval10: looks rather naturalish first couple of boards|pg||
nt|rv: possibly Duboin would have made a game try with a pure 5422 14 hcp hand in which loser count would be lesser|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: well the diamonds aren't enough tricks by themselves anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unless switch|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but not now|pg||
nt|mrdct: this seems to roll home comfortably looking at all 4 hands|pg||
nt|yuval10: E had a tough bid to make here and he decided to overbid his hand a bit but showing his shape|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: basically there is just no hope :)|pg||
nt|athene: south naturally wondering if he has to return a spade now|pg||
nt|panja: true..3N is crazy...but the actual bidding was meek|pg||
nt|sybarra: even with X,  can expect short @D in pard's hand but still...|pg||
nt|rv: here he had values in short suit and judged well as he often does|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: perfect time to refresh your drinks and coffee |pg||
nt|mrdct: but joe doesn't yet know that the @HK and @SA are onside|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: if his partner has the @SA and nothing else, it might be necessary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with my grumbling about claims -- we're 2 boards ahead of the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: but N had a great hand with the black suits, which pard said he had |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: women's match also low scoring  thru 9 boards   Bilski 12  Clark 3|pg||
nt|rv: in OR, Furuta upgraded his 14 hcp to open 1n, not right evaluation of hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrdct: running scores: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResultKnockout.aspx?section=b6b714a8-e406-4ec7-bdb2-fd1c39596dce&round=1&tourid=902|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually Zhuang's stretch to bid 1@S may have kept NS out of trouble|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: often in this situation you just have to ask yourself "would declarer, with plenty of tricks in the minors, duck the opening lead if the spades were wide open?"|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: and then you can see he wouldn't|pg||
nt|athene: but here it wasn't that clearcut|pg||
nt|frankaus: + pd passed originally|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: because declarer doesn't know the @CK is right for him even if he has @CAJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sidebar -- i'm confident that Kit Woolsey would object to Courtney's original @H lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: wd|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|sybarra: yes that is the problem I think |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: woolsey likes to try to find partner's 5-card suit if you don't have one of your own|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: so he prefers 3- over 4-card suit, right?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: ...again :)|pg||
nt|braunstar: i wonder what 3@h here unpassed...|pg||
nt|andy_h: A good 4@H contract by E/W here. But presumably Brown will not be letting his opponents play in 4@H with his heart void|pg||
nt|ahollan1: immediate 2@S would have been reasonable too|pg||
nt|rv: for Japan asking rate of nearly 12 IMPs per brd equivalent to 16+ runs an over in cricket:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: from the 7@H down to that 2@H Duboin and Sementa have had a massive set, they would beat anyone in the world on this form|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mildredb: operator, you forgot a pass|pg||

nt|henryb:  Operator, I believe declarer went three down on board 12, 150 to N-S, not 50|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: ubiquitous drury here, 2@c possibly shows 4 card support as well (some play 2@c to show 4 cards and 2@d show 3 card support 10 hcp)|pg||

mb|4C|nt|panja: as for showing strong hand, P first and then bid 2@H on 2@D...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andy_h: Can 4@S be beaten? Against 4@S a trump lead would be the best start to the defence|pg||

nt|andy_h: It was a trump promotion. If Nabil had ruffed high he can finesse the heart but he would have been unable to ruff his diamond loser|pg||
nt|braunstar: 8 tricks for the defence here against 1nt|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|athene: ok - i malign him - he is going to show his hand :)|pg||
nt|braunstar: i must go, thanks all, good luck to both teams|pg||
nt|andy_h: Thanks Daniel|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@c = 16+|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|algraves:  and 13 an opening for Japan if they can stop in partscore and make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 1@H = @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: Looks like a small loss for a 1NT opening with a 5 card Major|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: stay out!|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not a great fan of 7-card weak twos - especially non-vul|pg||
nt|algraves:  2@C trnsfer or something weird we presume|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: i just wasn't sure if transfer or 2@C [if playing Smolen]|pg||
nt|mildredb: it is amazing how many 7 card suits I see opened w/ 2 - new trend?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this seems to play OK and will be fairly easy on this @s lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oops truncated the link|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Klinger would have bid 2@D with minimum -- i'm just not sure what 2@H said |pg||
nt|peachy: heh, also 5-carders|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mildredb: right!  :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: now 5-card weak twos i agree with|pg||
nt|mildredb: gn all - enjoy the matches |pg||
nt|mrdct: @h will be a source of tricks for declarer here|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks so much Mildred!|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think he should probably leave @d alone given that he only has one in hand and has limited entries to dummy|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mrdct: he can virtually count 9 tricks with 3@s, 2@h, 2@d and 2@c|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugrapha4: 2@S an artificial bid of some sort|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh found it   2@H = 14+ HCP, game force|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: strange bid Hugh|pg||
nt|algraves:  so this seems down 1 unless declarer can somehow nulify norths second trump trick|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|peachy: hearts look the obvious choice, or clubs, then hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: cards sit conveniently for declarer |pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: 3@C looking for 5-3 club fit or a genius 54-3 club fit maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and was either 6+@S or 5@S & 4@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S was Relay    3@D natural    [and now i see 2@H could also be 11-14 BAL]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 2 to score in the Women's    Bilski 56  Clark 13|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all matches have 32 boards to play after this set|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: 4-3 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 6-3 :)|pg||
nt|athene: you could claim this at trick 1 but probably worth playing a few tricks as if a diamond gets ducked you might have 33 spades or a spade-diamond squeeze for 13|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more likely -- just clarified that Burgess in charge of @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spies will get us an update on the Hans-Brown match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using Rule of 11 -- seems the only time it would be right to continue @HJ is when partner started with @HA10843  and event then   partner must duck and South must regain the lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: queen, diamond, is my guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who play Smolen -- did you know that after Opener rebids 3N you can/should show the @C fragment??|pg||
nt|frankaus: but no sign of 9 |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mrdct: and now 10 with 3@s, 2@h, 2@d and 3@c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: again we thank the great Xu on vugraph, well done|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: with A10943  lead might have been 10 or 9  [depending on agreements]|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|peachy: well done to preserve entry to hand, but of course automatic to a player of curtis' stature|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|vugrapha4: Mullamphys first claim|pg||
nt|algraves:  defense has to be careful here not to get endplayed in the trum suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suspwct that N-S will play in @s at the other table on 13, probably a partial making|pg||
nt|algraves:  so at the other table in the 4@S hand declarer did take 10 tricks but in a partscore for 8 imp gain|pg||
nt|algraves:  this is coming down to the wire as they say at the track|pg||
nt|henryb:  these imps should go back on board 13, at least some of them|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pef: sorry long link :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mrdct: he doesn't need to worry too much about west holding the @HA as that would give east 87xxxx|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: and people who open 7-card weak twos don't open 6 small|pg||
nt|algraves:  declarer here can play ace and ruff a club exit low spade and the south must get out with the J of trump|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Still on 13 in the other room|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A quote from Sinatra's "My Way" is appropriate regarding this match now. Which?|pg||
nt|woozle: moment of truth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and now ... the end is near ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Al has won the right to come back tomorrow|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: very memorable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and just in time - the other room had caught up|pg||
nt|panja: interesting 3@S bid..12 HCP solid suit..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: beautiful Sweden have the big score|pg||
nt|algraves:  NS have good play to make NT or club partscore|pg||
nt|sybarra: penultimate bd here|pg||
nt|rv: supported by BBO, Roland and commentators panel|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now other room half a board ahead|pg||
nt|andy_h: But regardless of which side you're on, just make sure you and your partner are on the same wavelength|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: It is always an endless debate on whether you should open 1NT with a 5-card major or not, there are big upsides and downsides to both styles|pg||
nt|algraves:  on 14 so a little edge to Japan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=18-19 HCP, BAL, no 5M|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: NS might be a little bit of bother now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C ==  creative just doesn't seem to describe that bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Classic aggressive style from Courtney|pg||
nt|athene: but might be hard for EW to get their hands on 3@C since neither has length or shortage in the suit :)|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4 more boards to compare and it seems almost impossible for the Brown team to catch up on|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: last set the memorable moment was when player caught Richman passing throughout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson has only picked up imps on 3 boards this set|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's been a pleasure having you Venky, and Prakash earlier, spectators I love your feedback even when I've gone wrong @H|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|4S|nt|athene: if west had doubled, east probably would not have passed, but i don't see how double can hurt|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: No doubt Nye will get a laugh when Bobbys club holding tracks along with the 10@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = 4+@H  nothing about @S|pg||
nt|mrdct: this would be a very pushy game for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: even 2NT may struggle|pg||
nt|pef: true, but they are in the one loss bracket, already|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll be here all day and night for the final tomorrow, hope you'll join me I wouldn't miss it|pg||
mb|5H|nt|peachy: 2NT not a popular contract at IMPS, but here South just does not have even an ounce of anything, to accept|pg||
nt|panja: B15, 3N will be good..4@H could go down on @S guess|pg||
nt|algraves:  in NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if partner bids 3red, you bid 3N anyway|pg||
nt|andy_h: E/W play a 9-12 1NT opening in 1st seat favourable, so it was a good thing Edgtton remembered that he was in second seat (was that your undo Andrew or Nabil's undo? lol)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we've seen that 1N-2@H is to play, so Stayman needed with East hand|pg||
nt|wygbe1: is 2c puppet or is he just looking for 54 hearts?|pg||
nt|pef: another 3nt almost certainly|pg||
nt|algraves:  9 tricks NS possible even with club lead, should be very interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: always double to cater for the penalty pass, if you can do it without cost|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe DBL risks  4@H/@S from Richman -- which exposes @CKJx on opening lead|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm well you have a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|athene: if partner jumps to 4major you expect to make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i was thinking before it was outlawed   some might downgrade West to a mere 1N opener|pg||
nt|athene: this isn't a trivial hand to play actually|pg||
nt|peachy: or a gram, for the rest of the world|pg||
nt|mrdct: east a bi worried about continuing @d if north has the 10|pg||
nt|mrdct: *bit|pg||
nt|algraves:  3@C a form of puppet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe transfer response?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and not 4+@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i would have expected 2-way stayman  [i.e. 1N-2@D here]|pg||
nt|wygbe1: must be looking for 54 hearts|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: other room got to 3N via   1@C-3@D//3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen that 3@D bid before|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a very short break in prospect as we are due to restart in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|pef: but without those of us on the West Coast of the US :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: been nice having you guys thanks|pg||
nt|algraves:  and 3@S shows hearts|pg||
nt|rv: declarer needs to guess @d and take @h finesse to score this contract|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mrdct: @c do set up nicely here for 4 tricks in that suit|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like puppet|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3@H = 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no  2@D denies 5M|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only 10pm here I'll last another|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: you need to get diamonds and spades going and opps might get the hearts before that|pg||
nt|panja: short minor lead....|pg||
nt|wygbe1: this is definitely a better contract than 4h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or if partner bid 2@D  then  explore 5-3@H  because worried about @S|pg||
nt|pef: time to thank my fellow commentators, the Yeh Brother tournament, and bbo, especially Roland Wald who|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: good approach in the bidding from East -- glad you brought it up Jim|pg||
nt|pef: arranges all the commentary for these matches|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: so one more after this then the final 16 starting in 17 minutes, thanks to Catherine on vugraph, Ian and all spectators for your great feedback....|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even on the east coast (or near it), it's 6am and time for bed.  Can't take the all-nighters any more.|pg||
nt|algraves:  @s is best|pg||
nt|algraves:  of course|pg||
nt|algraves:  declarer has real chances with a heart switch|pg||
nt|algraves:  as west can be thrown in on thrid diamond to lead spades later in the play|pg||
nt|algraves:  of course east can only see his hand and dummy|pg||
nt|algraves:  tough game bridge|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: so with 1@s, 2@H and 1@d on top he'll come to his 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tomorrow we start at 11;30 am Sydney time|pg||
nt|rv: Lavazza proved too strong for Japan in this match, but Japanese team can be proud of their performance in this world class event, it is still not over for them, they need to forget ...|pg||
nt|rv: this segment and come back fresh for 3 way match this afternoon|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: Rule:  NEVER lead from Jxx(x)      except when it's right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had partner who would chastise me/teammates even then|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|rv: winner of the 3 way match this afternoon will meet Lavazza over 4 segments in the finals tomorrow|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd Quarter scheduled to begin in about 30 minutes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|algraves:  the heart seems the normal passive exit|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: i guess there is not really any way south, as a passed hand, can have a threatening heart suit AND enough entries|pg||
nt|algraves:  double dummy declarer can get home|pg||
nt|algraves:  but see above comment about not seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm sure they will give a strong showing, well done to them|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panja: either E judged well, or their method kept them out of 4!@H..seems former is the case|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Gill was probably thinking about what to pitch on THIS trick|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|wygbe1: funny position, cant quite unravel all the minor suit tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: and both players have discarded well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy can gain 2 imps by taking @DA -- but doubt he'll do that|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Mullamphy shakes his head|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's a pretty good assessment Matt|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: he knows he needs @D hook but also knows its not working|pg||
nt|wygbe1: still has 9 though|pg||
nt|algraves:  that was not best he had to duck|pg||
nt|yuval10: now he's safe|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|panja: y, NS have their late tricks in minor suit, EW in majors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats 2.30 am London maybe too early for some|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: last board of the match    loser is out, winner advances to a 3-way match   |pg||
nt|panja: N helped by leading short suit..@C lead might have led to some problems|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ns need a miracle|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes if he judges to play @D 3-2 with west having diamond 3rd|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: after @C10 from South   MAYBE  Griffiths could unblock @CJ to generate interesting entry position|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|hT|nt|yuval10: he see XX @c and 3 @h's in W, then 5@c and 4@h E|pg||
pc|d8|nt|algraves:  if he is going for the diamond play he can afford the @SQ first to see if east has @S J singleton|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: right idea to catch partner's suit, but sadly giving a trick away just the same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd pick @C just to avoid leading from Jack|pg||
nt|ianmcc: possible swing here|pg||
nt|pef: huh?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not to N obviously :(|pg||
nt|pef: maybe diamonds and hearts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S may carry on to 4 hts |pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in about 85 minutes, Shirl|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: before everyone leaves    restart on the quarter hour     and thanks Adam!|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Thanks Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i knew agreements better --- 3@H just seems   overly agressive to me|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s makes 11 tricks here losing 1@s and 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx Al  |pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 hour 25 minutes 1:10am  on the East Coast |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer will be disappointed with events after ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|andy_h: I don't know the scores for the other match but before going into the last set Courtney was up 105:59 imps against Klinger|pg||
nt|mrdct: actually we are rightsided here to avoid the @c loser|pg||
nt|peachy: We thank the Yeh Bros for presenting this prestigious tournament and for the generous prizes to winners.  Thanks for all commentators, Mildred Breed, Valerie Westheimer, Shirley ...|pg||
nt|peachy: Ybarra, and Dave Thompson, nice job.  Second set of 16 board begins in about 1.5 hrs, not sure which match will be shown, this one or some other.|pg||
nt|pef: on that confusing note, I will bid adieu|pg||
nt|sybarra: of US |pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: correction   tonight is another round of Head-to-Head matches   3 way begin tomorrow      [thanks Barry]|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mrdct: i was playing 4@s by south|pg||
nt|santyclz: Night all.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cheers|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like board 15 will secure the win for USA |pg||
nt|algraves:  yes the japanese chance on board 13 did not materialize as they could not go plus in other roorm|pg||
nt|yuval10: even though you might win or lose 1 imp here over the lead. A@h lead means 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  The other table is playing a conservative 3@d|pg||
nt|algraves:  -100 NS a push|pg||
nt|henryb:  on board 15|pg||
nt|rv: I wouldn't rebid 3@h with that @h suit, much prefer 3n with stoppers in both unbid suits|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6NT perhaps the superior contract|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: he'll settle down to a long winter evening of setting up diamonds|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: Results, click on the appropriate line, this is Round 1-1 of KO http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=902|pg||
nt|sybarra: and sorry folks I do not have standings  |pg||
pc|cA|nt|mrdct: the good news for declarer here is that he can't go wrong in @d|pg||
nt|rv: 3n is hardly cold, but this contract has no hope|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  12 where we were wondering when South was supposed to bid @S  after (1@H)-P-(1@S)-?    Huub Bertens bid 2@S immediately    for a push|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|frankaus: lust enough @S pips to make 9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|athene: he is hoping for a major suit squeeze now|pg||
nt|athene: but two rounds of spades from north would break that up even if it were there at all|pg||
nt|athene: i mean he has 8 tricks with the spade finesse if he sets up the diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a way for defense to err?|pg||
nt|athene: so he needs one more and the only hope is that north gets squeezed|pg||
nt|athene: he might be thinking about possibilities such as keeping the long heart|pg||
nt|athene: and finessing spade then played three  rounds of hearts to endplay north and simultaneously set up his long heart|pg||
nt|athene: *then playing|pg||
nt|athene: but that can't really work because north would surely have a third spade to cash so would make spade, heart, and @DK|pg||
nt|athene: you have to pitch a heart here and then just play a diamond and hope something good happens|pg||
nt|athene: but it can't ever work legitimately, on best defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and griffiths still needs to pitch something here|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. spade shift|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he has to decide which line he is going ofr|pg||
nt|athene: for|pg||
nt|athene: he either throws a diamond (if going for the throw in) or a heart (if going for the diamond establishment and squeeze)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)   instead of ofr    off|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Needs to hope Stephen to have the @H5 and insert it probably, in which case he can retain communication to his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case, courtney may just place @SJ in south  and shift to @SK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would have been non-force  [is that so bad?]  2@C game force   so  i guess 2@S or the mysterious 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@H says EXACTLY 3@S  it is easier to stomach|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many telling me it DID show exactly 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and now i see that Adam had flagged it that way  --   sorry mate|pg||
pc|d4|nt|algraves:  well played set here by both teams|pg||
nt|yuval10: thanks all|pg||
nt|algraves:  loser of this match could find their way through the double KO|pg||
nt|algraves:  well the excellent 3NT by Cheek is a crucial pickup at the end|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|panja: thx all, bye|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: Round 2 starts in about 70 minutes   --    thanks everyone|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrdct: there is a lunch break now, so the next session will be in about 90 minutes by which time i'll be on the beach|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: now @SAQ, heart, heart, i guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx again all,   |pg||
nt|frankaus: cu soon|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: thanks all Lavazza signing off with another 11 IMPs swing to win match by 60 IMPs|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
