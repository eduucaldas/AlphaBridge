nt|idc: In the Open room, East led a @s around trick 4 to save declarer a guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening all |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|idc: Declarer claimed after @s switch - I expect operator thought all rest of tricks but was only claiming =|pg||
mb|1S|nt|007 joosth: i suppose NS play 15-17  if so N upgraded because of the nice diamonds|pg||

nt|007 joosth: nowadays the prempts are higher and higher  4S here or still 3S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|idc: Vul v not in 2nd seat should be very sound, so not 4@s for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I like 1@S :)|pg||
nt|idc: Maybe even 1@s but I like to open light|pg||

pc|h2|nt|chick: http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: opposite 15-17, the West hand might be worth an invite - West takes the (non-vul) conservative view |pg||
pc|h8|nt|chick: no they play it only nonvul|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, ty|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: Well, you were right that opening 4@S at the other table prevented the EW save, but it also cuts off a lot of slam possibilities|pg||

mb|3H!|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 3H rather unusual as long S does not know how many spades N has|pg||
nt|idc: I was coaching a pair recently about this treatment: you can't play Unassuming Cue-bids by opening bidder|pg||
nt|idc: e.g. 3@h here to show a full value raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a reasonable 4S missed now?|pg||

nt|idc: West has done well to put pressure on with the 4@h bid|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|chick: South certainly has a full value raise, but North has nothing more to offer, so I think 4S might be hard to find|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed   but the main problem is that S does not know how many spades are in N|pg||
nt|idc: and some work to be done - not sure you will make 4@s to be honest|pg||
nt|007 joosth: lucky for them is the 41 break in spades     4S will be almost impossible |pg||

nt|007 joosth: I suppose 3Nt again|pg||
nt|chick: bergin-hill play short 1@C|pg||
nt|chick: "may be only 2"|pg||
nt|chick: that's why the alert|pg||
mb|1D|nt|007 joosth: but not really cold|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chilloncan: right, and thus cannot take it seriously for lead purposes, which diminishes the attractiveness of opening...for some, anyway|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: very light 1H  but also very useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: another easy 3N, even with a heart lead, because diamond entry in wrong hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|007 joosth: yes but a club switch will cause difficulties maybe|pg||
nt|idc: Maybe defence can give South a @c guess later, when they have 2 hearts & a diamond in the bag|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe 2H 2C and 1D looser then|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i couldnt bring myself to open 1S with the S hand. it would go all pass and dummy would be:   x    xxxx   xx   Jxxxxx, making 5 or six|pg||
nt|chick: Nice 1@S bid.  I see so many people open 2@C with broken suits, just because they have the HCP|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|idc: perhaps declarer should forget about diamonds, play on clubs herself|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chilloncan: i would certainly open 2C, but it would have nothing to do with HCP. rather it is just to easy to visualize a game facing zilch|pg||
pc|h9|nt|007 joosth: I think S should have taken this trick|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|chick: Marshall and I played once ... I think we lasted all of 3 hands :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S has a 3 loser hand, so if there is a decent fit there should be game even facing a near-blizzrd|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: if W wins the diamond and switches to a club, S has no choice but to go up with the K.  East has the hearts, and there are two cards to lose to if play low, and only one if play ...|pg||
nt|chick: the K.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: six clubs to the king and out and you have a possibel slam|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|idc: If hearts were running that's true, but they aren't, so a guess|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|007 joosth: small spade will be lavinthal   asking 4 a small club|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the 4 is the wrong card|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: also 8 controls and two queens|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h6|nt|chick: what you say is true, but there are a lot more hands where game goes down.  Since most play that 2@C is game forcing, it's not a good bid when you don't have any stand-alone suit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|007 joosth: but still not 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s8|pc|cT|nt|idc: card says first priority on discard is suit preference, i guess @s2 clearer|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sT|pc|cJ|nt|chilloncan: opening 2C could certainly end up wrong. but when it is wrong you pay 50 or 100, and when 1S is wrong you pay double digit IMP swings|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some sort of squeeze possible when S oplays a spade now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: if partner is too broke to bid 1N over 1@S, you aren't going to miss many games|pg||
pc|c7|nt|007 joosth: to long thinking here?|pg||
nt|idc: indeed - a stepping stone variant?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|c3|nt|idc: all very obscure, but quite fun|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it depends how far 2@C is forcing. eg 2@c-2@D-2@s-2N-3@C - is that still forcing, or has opener simply shown a strong near-fg hand that partner can pass?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|007 joosth: nice|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|007 joosth: sure|pg||
nt|idc: now position is what Cornelia was describing, as declarer couldn't afford to let East in|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: of @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Hil played with 12 cards|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: W hand a lot more like an opening bid than the recent 1D pvercall was like an overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 2S is the underbid of the year?|pg||
nt|idc: That looks a little too good for 2@s to me|pg||
pc|c8|nt|idc: I think I'd rebid 2NT, playing a 5-card major system at least|pg||
nt|chick: well, 2 red doubletons is nothing to be pushy with|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|chick: 1N doesn't have to promise a red AK|pg||

nt|mdgraham: but it is rather fortuitous |pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2S can be 10 or 11 hcp|pg||
nt|idc: If you don't feel the spades are strong enough for that, 2@c is a possible alternative, then make a further try if partner doesn't pass|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed 2C will normally be passed only with 5 clubs and weak hand.   as Lawrence suggests|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s7|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||

nt|chick: I like 2@S and I think E should try 3S holding a doubleton and an outside 6 card suit to the AK|pg||
mc|10|nt|007 joosth: 3S means about 10/11 and 3 spades Cornelia|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1NT is not forcing opposite 11 balanced, no. You may also want to pass 11 balanced, depends on the texture|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|007 joosth: 1S i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it is very much the modern style to bid any game that has a sniff|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|chick: after opener shows a 6 card suit, 3@S only promises a doubleton, and she did have 9 playing points plus the long diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1Nt in N    when its forcing 2D  ending at 2S|pg||
nt|chick: and a doubleton 2 honors|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: Another hand on the same theme - here possible is 2@h, then 2NT over partner's 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: i think it best to stick by ur guns - if u bid them - bid them every time - if u dont the stay low everytime - at least ur pd will know ur style|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: agree, except for the suggestion that staying low every time counts as "guns" :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|007 joosth: yes  i wrote 2D  must be 2H ofcourse|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|007 joosth: 2S is weak with 3 spades or about 8 with doubleton|pg||
nt|idc: 8 hcp for North but good intermediates, particularly T9 @s look good|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2NT seems a bit to much to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: but it has good chances|pg||
nt|idc: 3@d as suggested to me is perfect on shape, but I'd expect a little more in the way of high cards|pg||

nt|007 joosth: agree|pg||
