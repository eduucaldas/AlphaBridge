mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: We have 1 zillion Davids in Europe|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Smirnov-Hung play in a bunch of tournaments in Australia / Asia|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bakhshi   pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  hi Al|pg||
nt|rv: nice easy deal to start off with in post lunch session:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I always overbid the S hand:)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: NS generally play 2/1 with gadgets  [1@C=2+, 1@D=4+]|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: in various combinations, this Aus 2 team has done very well over last 2 years in Australia NOT |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: on 2@c landy showing majors, 3M is played as Mixed raise and 3@c/3@d as good raise in @h/@s by many partnerships|pg||
nt|andyv:  W really loves his hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rv: looks like this E-W didn't have detailed understanding, Bakshi meant 3@s as Mixed, Nik gave him more values (Inv), otherwise this auction can't be justified|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  this is down 1 off the top and could get worse|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rv: Andy must have restrained himself a lot not to double, @s lead would have been very effective|pg||
nt|andyv:  I didn't restrain myself at all, Venky.. I dbld immediately after I passed:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with DBL  Smirnov's hand would morph so that @C & @S were switched|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rv: lol, David Bakshi could have gone for atleast 300 if Andy doubled and tracked @SQ on table|pg||
nt|andyv:  pulling trump can't be the right way to play this|pg||
nt|andyv:  might be the right way to defend|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The thing with East's name is (my guess) that the operator thinks David his his family name|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough choice for S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS carding upside-down count & attitude  primarily count|pg||
nt|rv: he might work it out to continue @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could you please change it to   Bakhshi|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: That is definitely the case, because in the closed room we have 4 first names|pg||

nt|baldfriede: I am Friederike Greifswald-Tolleson, your commentator for this match.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good Morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: good morning|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mrdct: west showing his minor 2-suiter|pg||
nt|kareno: 5 of a minor will likely make e/w but n/s have a huge spade fit so they will likely not sell at that level.|pg||
nt|frankaus: $US 100,000 to winners !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d by east is best to minimise the chance of a @c ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx |pg||
nt|mrdct: welcome back to wuxi|pg||
nt|bg: pass by W strange if 1nt =15-17|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants online at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/Systems_Open.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: very pretigious event each year |pg||
nt|mrdct: east telling partner he has equal length in the minors|pg||
nt|kareno: West likely will bid clubs - then we'll see what north does.  Exciting from the get go!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: meanwhile NS are cold for 5@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Friederieke|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kareno: And that he wants to compete :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: possibly that was just the contract not the auction|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Not the real auction, but i got here too late|pg||
nt|frankaus: team members ay - http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/entries.aspx|pg||
nt|kareno: South's double doesn't make sense to me - he doesn't want to defend.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|mrdct: but 6 of a minor still a good save|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both of our pairs using transfer responses over 1@C  and as we see here -- in competition|pg||
nt|kareno: When you save over the five-level you have to be RIGHT.  If they cannot make 5 you are wrong and if they can make six and bid it, you are wrong.|pg||
nt|kareno: You need mirrors to defeat 5@c|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes its right to take out insurance enen if ur -1 in both directions|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: And actually if west ducks the improbable heart lead, it will make too.|pg||
nt|mrdct: it would be a bad start to the match to defend 5@cx making when you are cold for 5@s yourself|pg||
nt|frankaus: exciting hand to get us on the way|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@d - anyone know what that is?|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a limit raise of @s with no shortages|pg||
nt|frankaus: duessing  - good @S raise|pg||
nt|frankaus: guessing|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm hearing limit, no short suit ... and Bergen.|pg||
nt|kareno: In any event, Bocchi's sniffer is working hard!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: CC from 2010 Euro is  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is he bids one more....your guess?|pg||
nt|frankaus: bochhi's hand hast little defence|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kareno: He's all offense and no defense!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|mrdct: easy make on the @s lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: np Andrew welcome all|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not mad about his pass particularly if south's first bid showed as many as four spades with invitation.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North is  Hackett|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugrapha4: Hi Gary, I'll check when I can|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude    Klinger-Mullamphy odd/even 1st discard|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this is Round 3 in the Qualifying Swiss  [10 rounds of 10 boards]|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  still a 2 imp pick up for England, although passing 3@s would have netted 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 15 and  1 Seed Yeh Bros advance to the KO phase|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  nope, 2@h spoiled that:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  low @d lead would give declarer some problems|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|rv: yes, North bid 2@c with intent to bid 3@h to shows 4@h+5@s GF hand if South bids 2@d, on 2@h response by South he has clear raise to game|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, thought N was  playing it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Justin Hackett opened South 1@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will need to be careful to keep transportation between the 2 hands as he will need to lead @ss twice to dummy|pg||
nt|rv: East can still give declarer problem by shifting to low @d when in with first @s, I favor declarer  to get it right though|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: Kaplan Rubens Hand Evaluator agrees with Justin that the hand is too good for 15-17 NT  [says South worth 17.95]|pg||
nt|rv: in CR declarer seems to have got it wrong on above defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi    cool tool|pg||
nt|andyv:  if @s to 9 loses to 10, then on @d back, probably will have to put in K and play @cs to pitch @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Hung get @D wrong?  thinking Demirev led from @CJ instead of @D  maybe it was @DAce|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  moment of truth|pg||

pc|dK|nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|andyv:  but they didn't in other room|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|rv: good defender will shift to @d from even QXX in this situation since he can see @s suit coming home for @d pitches, I think there was a guess and decl did well|pg||

nt|chilloncan: maybe first time partnership that hasnt discussed NT range...maybe this event converted to Individual|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Board 17 - contract and result confirmed|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|ahollan1: other tables visible using  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@c likely a diamond raise.|pg||
nt|mrdct: the top 15 teams plus Mr Yeh's team qualify for the KO stage with the top 8 (including Mr Yeh) getting a double KO advantage|pg||
nt|frankaus: is this correct or did we have a pass missed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: convention cards for participants at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/Systems_Open.html|pg||

nt|mrdct: 4@s on ice here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: Richman-Griffiths playing previous board in 5@C|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like eight tricks is the limit for both sides.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: curious 2H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: red 2@D overcall would not be everybody's choice|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kemperg: two easy boards to start|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   1@S= either   bal 6-9 or 13+   OR   4+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this structure  1@C-1N = 10-12|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|baldfriede: Now stop, or else.|pg||
nt|kemperg: Not for the OR, NS in 4@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: North is declarer - his favourite seat!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with stif spade opps probably have that suit so hearts and clubs are the same suit, so why emphasize hearts when u can show both>|pg||
nt|bg: S has no confidence in pards vul 2 H call|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah he hasn't conveyed his 2-suiter|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: the Open Semi-Final and Women's Final are 64 boards matches split into 4 16-board segments|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on this hand it's difficult to decide which if either @H/@S was better for defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 2nd  16-board set in the 64 board Semi-Final   Women are playing the same boards in their Final match|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kemperg: no sorry EW|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: the event is to determine Australia Representatives or 2011 APBF [zone 6 championship] and accompanying Zone 7 playoff  then 2011 Bermuda Bowl/Venice Cup|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 4 card openings for Burgess-Courtney, strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Peter Gill was to opening the South hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S are Paul and Justin Hackett    EW  Adam and Nabil Edgtton (brothers)|pg||

nt|mrdct: does it? - they might not find their @d fit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that was my point|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@c will still make though i think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: standard signals for NS     EW upside-down count/attitude  odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Courtney - "I  always wondered what you'd have if you passed throught Bobby, and know we know"|pg||
nt|mrdct: north needs to show a spade splinter and that might get south going|pg||
nt|chilloncan: y|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: the tapping defence in @h looks best double dummy|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there are double dummy lines to find a way to go down, but i would need massive odds to bet against declarer|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this way 4@S North instead of South :)  with some extra info for declarer that won't affect the play|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: duh   of course Dyke rebid 2@H|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d only?  I wonder if their responses to takeout doubles are peculiar.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: an anomaly :)|pg||

nt|chilloncan: well, if diamonds are 41 the ocntract is at risk, so declarer will just bang trumps down|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not a lot of options for S|pg||

mb|4C|nt|rv: last making spot?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Justin Hackett in 3N South|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|rv: 3n requires inspired defense of not giving decl his @d trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  5@c might have a play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the opening lead against 3N was @HJ  haven't checked since then|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: in practise with lie of @h suit and no entries, 3n may be impossible to defend double dummy|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: well done Hackett|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  now EW will have to fall asleep to allow this to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S suit is interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N's @ss were J8x, there could have been some strip and endplays|pg||
nt|ahollan1: isn't there possible problem if @SA cashed and Bahkshi [?sp?] doesn't unblock??|pg||
nt|andyv:  right now, it seems S's only hope is that one hand was dealt the QJ tight of @s|pg||
nt|rv: West should still do crocodile coup if declarer still attempts that line and Bakshi doesn't unblock|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h3|pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  if declarer comes off dummy with a @s after stripping hand down, E should rise with the Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right @SA needs to be played earlier|pg||
nt|andyv:  better might have been for declarer to ruff @d and the play @c to board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but then West should still get it right|pg||
nt|andyv:  and sorry about crossing up dummy and declarer... N is declarer:)|pg||
nt|rv: crocodile coup is a term used for swallowing partner's honor (West to play @SK if East doesn't unblock @SQ after decl eliminates other suits) to prevent end-plays|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|cT|pc|d2|pg||

mb|2H|nt|vugrapha4: Lot of bidding from both Courtney and Burgo on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: four -  not SIX|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Not liking the chance of this contract all too much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north's choice:   DBL vs 1@H vs [i guess] PASS   you choose|pg||
nt|kareno: All the action we could possible want :)|pg||
nt|bg: China lost 7 on strange  1nt board one where 1nt was passed out|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, @C start and good decision in @D|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: plus the ruffs|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT on here|pg||
nt|mrdct: with this fortunitous @c layout|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mwigor: isnt it more than one down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes indeed|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: pretty conservative non-X by East|pg||
nt|mwigor: it is worth noting that 5@c makes EW - so in theory this is a good result for NS|pg||
nt|mwigor: i doubt many will find 5@c though|pg||
nt|kemperg: has chances |pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will not be easy.|pg||
nt|kemperg: first the start:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Passive defence may beat this - a @D lead gives declarer his 9th trick|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D J can also be the 9th|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h lead look normal to me.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: no choice is perfect, no choice is awful|pg||
nt|mrdct: this looks 2 off|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW have ti be carefull in @S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: however   with 5@S 3@H  DBL isn't a good choice since weak advancer [partner of doubler] will bid 1@H with 3@H & 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't have Q1 result for  Hans-Brown   maybe Adam knows [his brother is member of Hans team]|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like a puppet to 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: wd by N....far from obvious to bid over 1N, as S did not say double so suboar chance of 44 hearts, and long suit is weak. but this was the time for aggression|pg||
nt|chilloncan: oh wait, sorry i thought they were going to 3N after 2C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: i'm told  Brown +2     [or Hans -2]|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Brown up 2 imps|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c may well be a puppet to 2@d to establish this sign-off in 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if N was not planning to invite 3N, which as i said was pushy, i dont really warm up to aiming at a final contract of 3C|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|kareno: Not enough compensation for their vulnerable game.  Of course 4@h can be beaten but will it?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|chilloncan: why not just pass 1N?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mrdct: but EW could easily be going down in 5@s or 5@h in the other room so might be good for the chinese/dutch combination|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mwigor: of course -800 would not have been a good score for NS|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: lots of red suit discards coming|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's after 16 of 48 boards|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h7|nt|vugrapha4: 64 is it not?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy -- i changed my mind about   with 48 to play versus  16 of 64 :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would be very confident that no table in the field will play this board at the 4-level|pg||
nt|kareno: So a quiet down two.|pg||

pc|c6|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deLivera also opened 4@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like 10 tricks - but missed a possible vul game in 3NT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d8|pc|cJ|nt|mwigor: they've missed the second ruff so now only 2 down|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@C in OR|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real surprise there|pg||
nt|mwigor: perhaps gosney should have led back the jack?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Which should yield 2@S and 1@D to defence for 1 down|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|dT|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  a 3@s splinter might have done the trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S or 3@S from Gill?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kareno: Not unexpected they would make if they bid it.  Italy in trouble in this match.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C obvious showing a heart fit, but i don't know whether he is just improvising|pg||
nt|ahollan1: showing a Limit Raise     i never remember if that is original or modified Bergen|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C limit is reverse bergen|pg||
nt|kareno: They need to get some IMPs on the board.  |pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: 1@h by David is possibly trf to @s |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: flip-flop @S & @H and must overcall, but since Advancer [doubler's partner] would bid 1@H when 3@H & 3@S, DBL becomes more reasonable|pg||

nt|frankaus: is a wagging tail unauthorised nformation :)|pg||

nt|kemperg: and a chance for 5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: mine was too cautious|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: YUK|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: NS playing these ultra-undisciplined weak-two bids|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS employ a lot of transfers - good modern methods|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Good 3nt for E/W here.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: there is one more set after this so the gap is not insumountable|pg||

mb|3H|nt|athene: these are double edged in that if opps come in they might easily get too high|pg||
nt|athene: but of course they are also risky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Burgess sooo strong, maybe they'll be able to unravel|pg||
nt|athene: they pre-empt your side out of your own best contract too much, in my opinion|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe they get there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought i was having a flashback   just couldn't remember which decade|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1@D=4+@H's|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1@H=all hands with 3card hearts but not forcing, or some hands with 4@H's|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: last night one of these bids at unfavourable ended in -1100 to save 430|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be a misunderstadning here for EW|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: burgess takes the low road|pg||
nt|chilloncan: one does open 1D when dictated by a draconian system, but the undfettered heart yearns to open the eponymous 1H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: Gosney would like to pass the 1@H but 18-19NT with 3 hearts would also bid 1@H so he's constrained to bid 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps just a little bit cautious|pg||
nt|andy_h: I suspect that 2@C or 2@D by Gosney would be artificial (aka xyz)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but he does have weak trumps |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@H shows 4  [support dbl situation??]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy 3@H bid seems to support that guess|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: grab a coffee everyone :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: but 2NT looks OK with everything stopped nicely|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mrdct: and the @d7 is now going to come into play|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: still 6@H should have some play? especially with the lead coming up to those luscious minor suits|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: well read|pg||
nt|kemperg: well bid|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: the other room is bidding  7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: half our audience are commentators obviously enthralled by the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: anything happening Catherine?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ish is thinking... of dinner perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: his thoughts won't help him on this board|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: not a good advertisement|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: even after P-2N  probably still won't get to slam, but may sniff at it|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: north won't like weak @S  and 5422    south won't like minor suit queens|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: well, of course you would rather have the @SQ, but the minor-suit queens aren't useless|pg||
nt|athene: they stop the defence setting up any trick in a minor on the lead|pg||
nt|athene: so you can afford to lose the lead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: did Dyke do well not to mention @S   or was he lucky??|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h7|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: yes -- i'm just saying it will slow down any mild attempt to get to slam|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mrdct: more imps likely for Huamen with partscore looking to make in both rooms|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s5|pc|c4|nt|mcarroll: This is EW doing to NS what they did on board 4 - running long minor|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|andy_h: North could have risen with the @CA to take the contract 2 off given the (un)lucky layout of the diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: either way -- a bit surprised that he sold out to 3@H when partner "freely" bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that was weakest way for Gill to bid  [other than PASS]|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wheels came off|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: must give some credit to NS for using up bidding space|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Ish gaine an imp bless him|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: so i guess it would be going down in practice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 3+  but still transfer responses|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not many boards are left, time's running out for the Brown team. A 14imp was swung on board 19 where the failing grand (due to 4-1 break) was not bid in the other room|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: also a good lead by Gosney on 17 defeated a game for 12 more|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: good start for a final set for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d for NS here|pg||
nt|kemperg: fireworks here?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: We have a slam here, but it has to be played carefully to make.|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D doesn't inconvenience the opening side|pg||
nt|bg: maybe 6|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah could be|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south needs a raise to do that|pg||
nt|athene: but there we are :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This 2nt bid should be a help.|pg||
nt|kemperg: was my bid too, not yours?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mrdct: with the @HA with the singleton @d, the defence can only lead trumps once|pg||
nt|baldfriede: My bid too, but it helps nevertheless.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C fit, invite+ ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: it certianly looks tempting now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: certainly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@h is about the limit for NS here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h looks like a splinter agreeing @d|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@C now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @s is the better slam.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kareno: 2@c - anyone know what this is?  Better than 1nt?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hods allow quasi-2N hands to peter out in playable spots|pg||
nt|mrdct: although the @d position is quite favourable|pg||
nt|kareno: Good screech to a stop!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay it shows 18-19 balanced, thanks.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm alway a bit nervous about splintering with a stiff king|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like OR may be in time trouble - only 6 boards played|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he has a choice in trumps, whether to lead the @DJ to pin the ten|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like 9 tricks i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry start of my message was deleted by gremlins:  flexible methods allow....|pg||
nt|mrdct: draw trumps finishing in dummy and take @d hook|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to get to this spot by many methods|pg||
nt|kareno: Note that with JTx of trumps, it is correct to lead small in case partner has queen or king.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds friendly!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: friendly but not passionate. if 8 and 7 interposed, then passionate|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: e.g. @SQ K A, diamond to queen|pg||
nt|mrdct: and even more nervous splintering in a suit shown by partner|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|andy_h: 4@S looks to be the limit here, unless declarer takes a view on the clubs|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a very aggressive double of 3@D by Gosney|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: too true! Still, if he passed, West would X himself|pg||
nt|andy_h: Certainly a nice partner to provide him with four keycards!|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Ruff out a small @h in @s slam to make.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: west may drop the @D8|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: can probably surmise exact suit distribution though|pg||
nt|athene: trying to look like a man with @D108 doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: signals crossed here so much for fancy bids|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ahollan1: the question being   is West  5332 or 5422|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he went wrong right away|pg||
nt|mrdct: and i assume 3@d showed a red 2-suiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps he hoped for the added advantage that east might not cover with @DKx|pg||
nt|athene: he will put south with five diamonds at least for the overcall|pg||
nt|athene: so he won't think his partner could have @D10xx|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: @D start gives leader a lot to think about|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|mrdct: the general rule i have in most of my partnerships is that you can never splinter in a suit partner has shown|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kemperg: has to play fot 2 singletons!!|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|kemperg: gets the @D count, so 65 known|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andy_h: Yeap had he passed then the same contract would be reached, although probably played by Gosney|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Not really; what else is there but to ruff? And after the first trump everything is clear.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|athene: could take the @D8 too on a trump promo now if they wanted|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 tricks will double Lavazza's imp total|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d might be difficult to bid - so making 4@h here might square the board|pg||
nt|bg: good place for the    ASBAF system  "All Strange Bids Are Forcing"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrdct: and 10 tricks will treble it!|pg||
nt|kareno: And that can be made.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: mnow has to hope that trumps are not 5-1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: sorry, 5-0|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d7|nt|athene: it wouldn't matter though; the club loser would go away|pg||
nt|athene: it's just one down whatever route you take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room   8 [where we wondered about Courtney's 2@S opener]    DeLivera opened 2@H showing weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|andy_h: So I guess in a way he was generous enough to let partner play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: richman just better make sure he doesn't get himself endplayed|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kemperg: no problems anymore|pg||
nt|mcarroll: in trouble now|pg||
nt|kemperg: for defens|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: and arrive in 6@H|pg||
nt|athene: ah, but the other way up|pg||
nt|athene: now a club lead looks killing|pg||

nt|kemperg: he should know there' a singleton in S|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: people often push the upper limit for 1nt overcall over 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: over 1@S|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-8 HCP, @H or @S  --  no strong options|pg||
nt|mrdct: might collect a few hundreds in 3@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: or 500 in 3@sx|pg||
nt|mrdct: will south pass?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: the reason is they don't want to double and have to rebid 2nt facing a possible zero|pg||
nt|frankaus: can they stay pot of 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but you can easily miss games doing this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically 1N was 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: courtney might try 3nt now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 3@C weak  weak 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: why?   Burgess has only confirmed 13 cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: helpful lead still a lot of work for Ish hope his brain still aware after all that thinking earlier|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he is alert and focussed we are told :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we welcome Ian McCance |pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great to have you Ian|pg||
nt|andy_h: Nice 5@H bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: nef X by W perhas describable as...optional|pg||
nt|frankaus: out of 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but that would be a bit wild since south can't have much to pass 2@H and will usually have a lot less than he has|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Bobby gave X a couple seconds of thought|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @d now and if he ducks the roof could fall in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes @C's are ominous|pg||
nt|mrdct: might need to guess @d right here to make so a chance for lavazza|pg||
nt|frankaus: running scores all matches at - http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=1&tourid=902|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: finally  a long @C suit is running|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS turning a plus score into a minus score|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Thanks to all who made this event possible: The organizers, our excellent operator, my co-commentators Frank Budal, Martin Carroll and Germ Kemper and of course the indefatigable ...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Roland Wald.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: do you think South is in lebensohl situation where 3@D showed some values?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if south happens to have nothing, 3nt is getting doubled and so is 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think 2N is scramble rather than lebensohl|pg||
nt|kemperg: they did:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andy_h: Although declarer still has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|andy_h: If trumps are 3-1, provided that the defenders duck a round of clubs, there is no entry to dummy to enjoy the clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: you might argue that with some values, south must do something over 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: unless he has a penalty pass of course, but he hasn't got that|pg||
nt|athene: so when he passes and then pulls the double, he is showing a pretty weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: of course there will be times when you would like leb to be on in these situations|pg||
nt|athene: but i think in general it's better to play 2nt as scramble|pg||
nt|mrdct: @SJ here to show the @HK|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andy_h: However, given that West holds the singleton queen of trumps, a good guess in clubs would see the contract for one off. If Gosney ducks the first round of trumps, declarer will ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: then be able to ruff his two little spades. If Gosney takes it with the Ace and returns a trump, declarer then guess the clubs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|braunstar: Hey all|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kiwibridge: disaster avoided|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hey Daniel|pg||
nt|braunstar: It seems Hans have built a nice lead into this last set|pg||
nt|braunstar: Does anyone know the results of the other match?|pg||
nt|mrdct: once north shows up with the @sA, the odds might favour south holding the other missing ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sometimes it DOESN'T??|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with 10 LTC and bad spades, W can pass... no game unless E can act  at almost any subgame level, in which case W wll have all values in reserve and can do the needful|pg||
nt|kareno: Still a vulnerable overcall ..|pg||
nt|mrdct: but when north turns up with the @sA, what has south got for his vul 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: gmta Dave|pg||
nt|frankaus: oh well -1 is good bridge (some say)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: last board of the match here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|frankaus: the presire card found|pg||
nt|frankaus: presure|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: Ish taking his 6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, one of the seldom acknowledged -- at ;east by the busy bidders -- disadvantages of the busy-bid style, is that declarer can then all too often place all cards early, ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ESPECIALLY if the overcall is raised. and if it hurts your side to have your overcall raised, maybe it isnt the best idea |pg||
nt|kareno: Well done for the push|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: does Mullamphy EVER claim?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was 105-59 to Courtney|pg||
nt|mrdct: good @d play by south to put declarer to the guess before he has discovery of the @SA and @HQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: it's easy to see they might reach 3n on this hand in the other room though|pg||
nt|athene: east must duck the second diamond to kill the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  West's 3rd seat opener is not automatic by any means|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
mc|9|nt|kemperg: Thanks all see some of you in 20 mins|pg||
