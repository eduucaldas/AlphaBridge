nt|jcomyn: who backs out first|pg||
nt|paulg:  unlike the first half, I guess NS will stay quiet and leave EW to themselves|pg||
nt|lark20: Could it be East/West's turn to have the points?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: grind to a halt in 4s i guess|pg||
nt|paulg:  Spades always win|pg||
nt|paulg:  and the likely heart lead will make it simple to play|pg||
nt|jcomyn: problem is round and round they go and where will it stop|pg||
nt|lark20: Should be a nice start for Yvonne|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hello from manchester|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: Good evening all.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|benjy: Good afternoon Everyone|pg||
nt|odysseus69: delighted to see Dinah Caplan in action- a youthful 78 year old making her International debut with my good friend Lizzie Godfrey|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The Irish ladies got a bit of a shellacking in the first set. Let us see if they can recover |pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: 4s not a bad sacrifice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a small select group watching here :)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  hard for EW to get into the auction though |pg||
mb|3S|nt|jcomyn: mjkousy 2h|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless 2@h is getting passed out|pg||
nt|simonx:  For the English, they need to win by 59 IMPs to get a maximum 25 VPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: indeed|pg||
nt|benjy: Hi Victor|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: ooips|pg||

nt|jcomyn: but irish not there yet|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Victor and Ben|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 hearts is a lucky make but not one to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: hello all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any preferences for double rather than 3@h?|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s is trusting the opponents too much |pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|jcomyn: surely have to bid 4s|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: almost...|pg||
nt|paulg:  a little more sophisticated but a sound auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so no chanc e of going wrong|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  Punch knows it is a 4-4 fit, so unlikely to sacrifice at this vul|pg||
nt|paulg:  the Irish stopped in 2@h, why sacrifice?|pg||
nt|paulg:  A small spade lead would be testing|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch must feel N/S are already pushed beyond their limits|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: yea s lead some guess|pg||
nt|benjy: Indeed, 4@H is not a game you really want to be in looking at the two hands|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||

nt|yo_yo: men leave the room please :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sybarra: nah, letskeep a few of them :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree - even in these unenlightened days, 2@h over 1@s should show a decent hand |pg||
nt|simonx:  England's main loss in the first half was reopening the bidding when the oppo had stopped in 2@c.  They then got to 5@c and made it.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|benjy: Godfrey was heavy for 2@H but not close to a 3@H call in my opinion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and more of the same here - EW could have defended 3@h and now they are defending a making 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or a should-be-making 4@h, anyway|pg||

nt|paulg:  EW will be sacrificing on this hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but nthere is here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Of course Yvonne will have been on vugraph a few times before, as Scotland vs England is often shown from the Peggy Bayer (U20) match|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also from the Junior Europeans|pg||
nt|odysseus69: slam time|pg||
nt|kemperg: this is interesting|pg||
nt|simonx:  Known as  Biltcliffe Coup to some ... reopen a aprtscore and then they make game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, no, no - you have to double the game as well|pg||
nt|simonx:  ... and some say you have to double AND misdefend|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbt: DHAMPUR SUGER 109 , R L KAJRIWAL 112, a BAGARIA 82|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well should nagainst vul opposition|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that was a good save against 4@H |pg||
nt|benjy: Looks like 6@D/@C is a make |pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 1c-1d-3d and they will bid it smoothly|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbt: MMRMC 102,   BIMAL SIKKA 86|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hefty 3s|pg||
nt|paulg:  although that opening would put most off|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1c -1d-2d and???|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that board probably flat - a more, how can we put it, appreciative auction should get to 4@h anyway  |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: probably not biddable |pg||
nt|odysseus69: key moment|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: will see if the other room gets into the bidding (last hand) |pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: I think south should bid 3@D and then north 3@H|pg||
nt|kemperg: now its on|pg||
nt|benjy: What is south going to do over that?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to get there now and I agree about 3D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: best she can do|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: W made of sterner stuff :)|pg||
nt|larrymori: it would be something to reach 4@s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbb: South thinking...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6 loser hand yes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzbt: BANEET 93,    MMSNEHA  86|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont be tested but ew will be in the open room|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@S to keep 3NT in the game? Remember South doesn't know that partner has a slam try yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Liz has a big hand opposite a 4@d overcall, but few tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: perhaps thinking she should have opened 4...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch did will to pave the way for a sacrifice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: irish pair very aggressive bidders in there|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@H could just be looking for 3NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: undo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c fourth suit. Not normally game-forcing by a passed hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: so probably 2@h form North, and then South will have to take a view|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: anyone like the X of 2@C?  I'm not sure I'd want a club lead (even if S were on lead)|pg||
nt|benjy: Wow 3NT is a huge underbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S would be a good description |pg||
pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: 3nt is pusillanimous from North - confident that English pair will bid this|pg||
nt|kemperg: not good:((|pg||
nt|benjy: South has a minimum 3@D bid and slam is cold, 3NT is also a terrible spot, if the @SQ loses you go down in 3NT when you make 6@D|pg||
nt|larrymori: 2@s with the good @ss would have been worth a try|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but South has passed - not unreasonable|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lark20: I thought Yvonne would have bid 3H here|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess that they don't play checkback, as you might invite with the West hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzbb: a rather stingy 9@C...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: from Norths positon a grand was close than 3NT |pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: i dont mind it, sometimes keeps them out of 3NT ( which is sometimes good - or bad)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now dangerous to finesse trumps|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may make the play of hts different |pg||
nt|sybarra: like cashing of AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes bash them out and get a nice surprise|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|paulg:  again, it is non-vulnerable so the rewards are not so great|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Rory Timlin|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and patsy meehan is west in the open room and will be in 4h|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh dear now it's down|pg||

nt|lark20: if you can't make it don't bid it|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|paulg:  this is why I would have upgraded, it justs feel too good for a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|paulg:  I am told that EW play weak jump shifts and checkback, so 2@h was mildly invitational|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Will the Irish bid and make the tight game this time?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doubt it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too many holes in the side suits|pg||
nt|golfsquash: It is getting more thought this time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and hard to see how n can fill those holes|pg||
nt|lark20: With 8 points and albeit a 6-card suit, game does not seem likely opposite a 12-14  hand|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  of course 3NT is not cold|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|greerm: if 1@C can be 2, it's difficult to bid 3 east|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure if the Irish captain  will allow a beer at the table. Afterwards, perhaps |pg||
nt|larrymori: at these colors and not such a good suit 2@s is suspect at best|pg||
nt|larrymori: the bid takes them out of their best suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: East does not like this double at all.|pg||
nt|greerm: West not about to defend 2@D|pg||
nt|greerm: Norma F will now bid 3@C |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Norht goes for it - might as well, at 60-odd down|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: now whast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a rarity - 26pts and no bids|pg||
nt|benjy: Normal 4@S here making 11|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and could  get 800 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: looks like 800 if they get their @C tricks in...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|paulg:  i think now you ask for a few undos and bid 1N on the first round |pg||
nt|greerm: and there it will rest I think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: what is 2h anyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h will be a double negative|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: kelly puts the ball back into Ferguson's court|pg||

pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: surely must balasnce with s hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doesnt look sound to me|pg||
nt|greerm: i think 2, 3@C 1@H and 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Ferguson has a Nepal flag, operator; could be a mistake :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4 could easily go down, finessing in trumps|pg||
nt|kemperg: max with fit|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  well, i think she does have a double negative, perhaps a triple negative|pg||
nt|lark20: 2@H is "less than a Q"|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I know Nepal and Northern Ireland are close to each other on the scroll bar|pg||

nt|kemperg: leads also to 4@S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: but surely 1nt by s on this auction is hardly balanced 16- hcp|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway i am not defending 1s|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will eventually play ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens this seems to be one of those times when partner does have eight tricks in notrump|pg||
nt|golfsquash: She will lose 4 trumps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and you end up in a very shaky contract - to put it mildly|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it is natural play to finesse the ht |pg||
pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: yes - having bid only 2S which limits the quality the West hand worth a cue which would be of no interest to East here|pg||
nt|larrymori: it was better leading from the honor|pg||
pc|s2|nt|baldfriede: Uh-oh.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|baldfriede: This can go down 4 now with @d continuation.|pg||
nt|greerm: not always obvious to draw trump with such poor holdings but,|pg||
nt|benjy: or perhaps 4@H as a source of tricks, depends on your methods|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kemperg: cue for me|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: sry...heart honour not played at trick one...|pg||
nt|simonx:  Well not 800 any more ... can she get away with -200?|pg||
nt|larrymori: south has to lead a @s twice now when in with the @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: defence got a little muddled...making 8 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  once she has finished trying to reconstruct NS hands that fit the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: not that she cares too much...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: but wendell had to signal spade not club |pg||
pc|c5|nt|lark20: Difficult for S to find a bid with such a flat hand and 3 suits bid by opponents|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and will go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: *wennell |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzbb: sry...|pg||
nt|benjy: Just going back to Board 3 for a moment, where a decent game was missed|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg:  i think South has to double 1@s|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: thats my view also|pg||
nt|baldfriede: The problem was that West was in the lead, and drawing trumps from Kx does not look too good.|pg||
nt|greerm: setting up a cross ruff for the defence|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: i like source of tricks but the main thing is agreement|pg||
pc|s3|nt|benjy: if a 2@S opener in 4th seat shows around 12-15|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|greerm: south knows where the @C Q is?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c7|nt|baldfriede: She should.|pg||
nt|greerm: if so, can ruff high now and another @S|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|paulg:  it must show something along these lines, and they'd probably play in 1NT|pg||
nt|greerm: wd|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|benjy: then 1@S followed by 2@S showsa better hand than that something like 15++-16 in which case i think west should bid on over that. Any thoughts guys?|pg||

nt|odysseus69: aces do tempt me|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|odysseus69: j of diamonds works well|pg||

nt|simonx:  the one that goes backwards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: what??? - with 5-3 s fit and 2h and 2h|pg||
nt|baldfriede: And it should go down 1, Cards sit wrong for declarer.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @H is the "relay" response  (pass or correct) |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  I agree, it is not a good opener at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: But that wouldn't get a @C lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: best start:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|greerm: another difficult play hand for Sandie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as commented, good case for a club lead - you have an honour, and hopefully can set some tricks up - heart lead needs a good holding from partner|pg||

nt|jcomyn: dont wait for p |pg||
nt|paulg:  1@h was not much of a space-consuming vulnerable overcall and, unsuprisingly, McGowan expected more|pg||

pc|dT|nt|lark20: How lucky can Scotland be?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: A little gift.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that would be my cup of tea|pg||
nt|simonx:  The way the VP scale goes, England are capped when the score gets to 25-5, but the Northern Ireland score carries on down to 25-0, so they still have something to play for.|pg||

nt|jcomyn: my money is on irish to bid 4s|pg||
nt|paulg:  although Punch and McGowan are still settling into their partnership, they are both quite resilient and will not let bad results get them down|pg||

nt|chick: by playing the way she did, she had to guess whether E's 3rd card was heart or diamond|pg||
nt|benjy: On the last hand North knew that West had 10 red cards from the bidding so after the two top @Ss the A@C was perfectly safe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|simonx:  Right, weak on weak ... I thought that was a no-no |pg||

mb|4S|nt|benjy: and by north too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT is the spot and they should get there - 1D -1S -1NT and a move from South|pg||

nt|larrymori: keeps them out altogether|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  maybe McGowan/Punch overcall any 5-card major?|pg||

nt|simonr: Confusing the operator with the name changes - sorry!|pg||

pc|c2|nt|paulg:  naturally you run to your other major|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i mean the s hand is big enough to look fo a chance, but not opposite thast hand|pg||
nt|benjy: If you bid 1NT you will never get across your shape, or playing strength|pg||
pc|c6|nt|simonr: South should have signed in 4@H and denied a @D control - if that is the methods|pg||
nt|benjy: Could easily miss a slam in my opinion|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|paulg:  if the South hand is interested in slam then it should be bidding suits and not notrumps|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|benjy: Yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: What was W thinking?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the problem with 3D is that South faces some difficult problems - usually 2C is available as an enquiry which allows a 3D rebid|pg||
nt|benjy: The 10 was right on all layouts, declarer could not have 3 small @Hs as they would have called for the Q|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  perhaps being non-vulnerable was important |pg||
nt|paulg:  games need to be 50% to be worth bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: i think so...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you would be amazed at the number of players whon regard 2c as a WEAK bid and have to jumpm - crazy as it seems|pg||
nt|lark20: 2@C just may not be forcing in their system|pg||
nt|larrymori: for sure|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  2@c is not forcing in my system, but I don't expect to miss game with a singleton heart if partner passes|pg||

nt|paulg:  another pretty tough hand for EW to deal with|pg||
nt|kemperg: clubs 33 worked both ways|pg||
nt|odysseus69: you are  right Ben- /i was talking rubbish - the danger of seeing all 4 hands|pg||
mb|2N|nt|paulg:  but the lack of values and misfit will probably steer them to 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless South wanders in?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 27,  the 6 nt played from the other side in OR,  -1 |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|jcomyn: tx paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  they might bid game here|pg||
nt|simonr: I suspect a weak NT from South and an invite from North via a transfer. South should accept with AJx support and two aces |pg||
nt|chick: yes, from the other side, but the play went similiarly, and East pitched 2 hearts and saved her 4 clubs!|pg||
nt|simonx:  Is Dianh, at 78, is the oldest ever English player in the Lady Milne?  Almost certainly the oldest debutante|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|greerm: there's an acol type Fred?|pg||
nt|greerm: weak NT|pg||
nt|benjy: In fact if south is known to have 7@D and 2@H then the only time it is right to play the way she did was when south had Q10 doubleton of @Cs she definitely misplayed that in my ...|pg||
nt|benjy: opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|lark20: Thank you Paul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: finn is thanking her lucky stars|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: yes  but might be easier on a @D lead? |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: don't see why, won the diamond, took the spade finesse, and cashed all spades and diamonds, essentially the same as here|pg||
nt|kemperg: but she was lucky|pg||
nt|benjy: what is a jump in the 4th suit fro you guys?|pg||
nt|benjy: for me it is 55 forcing|pg||
nt|kemperg: isn't that a 55?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think the clue is no ht lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and probably needs a club lead to let it through|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lark20: With such a poor suit it was a good disciplined pass by South|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest I'd have bid 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: the other room might see a 3@H overcall...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it was paul who thought she might i knew she wouldnt |pg||
nt|kemperg: you are faster than me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: for me its 5-5 at the 3 level - for others a splinter - but here just natural forcing|pg||
nt|benjy: I don't understand why south doesn't bid 3@H over 3@C why rebid that @D suit!|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: her mixed partner would have her guts for garters, so she didnt|pg||
nt|lark20: I would probably have bid 2@H as well and then been disappointed when my partner led the suit:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: count on the @D early |pg||
nt|sybarra: count on the hand actually |pg||
nt|benjy: A thourougly unconvincing auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: giving opportunity to bid 3@H with 6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: she has excellent diamonds - if she plays poker|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kemperg: royal flush?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|baldfriede: She will probably misguess Q@s.|pg||

nt|jcomyn: this could be quite a match|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Showing @h support, but how strong can it be?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamond lead needed to beat 4S|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H 1 down on 13, declarer stripped opps to play from the @C Q, well played, 1 down|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|benjy: The NI declarer was unlucky to go down in 4@H on Board 13, 12 more to ENG|pg||
mb|2S|nt|greerm: Sandie shows her second suit, presuming the 3@H dbl requested that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: a very experienced scottish pair against the irish playing only 2nd time, but anna has been having a greast season at home|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  in the other matches, Northern Ireland are leading NIBU (NI  2) by 10 imps and England lead Wales by 19 imps|pg||
nt|greerm: tempting now for Laura|pg||
nt|simonr: The double may just have shown @hs|pg||
nt|greerm: and the 4@C showed the extars we discussed earlier|pg||
nt|greerm: with @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: well done to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: can she make this with the friendly @D layout?|pg||
nt|greerm: every card right actually|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@S would have been a cheap save vul against non if you could avoid two diamond losers - which is unlikely|pg||
nt|greerm: right for declarer that is|pg||
nt|simonr: Not sure why Wales went 2 off in the other room?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Although Punch and McGowan are very experienced players, this is their first major event together|pg||

nt|larrymori: ok thx|pg||
nt|simonx:  So they are playing a deal that we don't have on the computer? |pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: no...sry...NS playing 3NT if you're interested :)|pg||
nt|simonx:  That's fine, Larry has a great set of jokes he can share with us.  Take it away, Larry|pg||
nt|larrymori: lol, I will do it in Japanese|pg||
nt|larrymori: everybody speaks Japanese right?|pg||
nt|simonx:  I have always been confused by lol.  It meant Little Old Lady when I was learning to play bridge.|pg||
nt|larrymori: it sure did|pg||
nt|larrymori: a bridge term for sure|pg||
nt|simonx:  Now little old ladies play bridge for England and I am accused of being sexist.|pg||
nt|larrymori: cuz not many young people are playing unfortunately|pg||
nt|larrymori: people should laugh, it is a healthful thing |pg||
nt|larrymori: reduces stress|pg||
nt|simonx:  There are strict rules about sexist language in Europe, but they don't apply to England.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: ok...on to board 32 now|pg||
nt|larrymori: too much political correctness stuff in the US|pg||

nt|paulg:  she did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats not like liz|pg||
nt|paulg:  having played the @s10 I'm very surprised she did not make it|pg||
nt|paulg:  We are on the last board of this match. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Stephen Peterkin, for an excellent job.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, Rory Timlin, John Comyn and Beryl Campbell, for their peceptive comments and to all the kibitzers for the assistance.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Finally, our appreciation to Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and NIBU (Robin Burns) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|paulg:  We start again tomorrow at 10:00 Belfast (11:00 Paris, 04:00 New York, 10:00 Berwick-upon-Tweed).|pg||
nt|jcomyn: some very interesting hands. As we often say it is easy when u see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  actually it is 05:00 in New York, apologies for that|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Last chance for a slam now. Will we have it?|pg||
nt|greerm: nope|pg||
nt|greerm: though maybe |pg||
nt|baldfriede: Would be one with Q@c onside though.|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand for this set |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our brilliant operator  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Cornelia for your time and assistance |pg||
nt|simonx:  Here we have Ladies Trials, but when the team plays outside Britain they are called Women|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: ...and teh @D behaving!|pg||
nt|greerm: or a @C lead from North :)|pg||
nt|chick: and to you, Shirley :)|pg||
nt|simonx:  OK ... how did we do on the mystery board?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  From a Scottish perspective, a very assured debut for Yvonne Wiseman|pg||
nt|benjy: Another 11 to ENG making this a whitewash|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2S|nt|paulg:  She'll really be looking forward to the rest of the weekend now|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, nice to work with you Victor and Ben|pg||
nt|benjy: As declarer went down at the other table when on the same lead they rose ace|pg||
nt|benjy: You too Germ|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks to kibs nice comments|pg||
nt|larrymori: generic instead of trying to qualify people |pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: 3NT+1|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: multi 2d|pg||
nt|greerm: this the last hand here, thanks all, next round starts at 12.10 Norther Ireland time|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@S by North in the other room!!!! I think not. This will mess up the IMP scores|pg||
nt|larrymori: west might try 3@d instead but X is very popular to show cards when stuck and not have 4@h+|pg||
mb|4S|nt|odysseus69: thx all - got to leave now|pg||
nt|benjy: West did well here to pass 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: London follow us btw :)|pg||
nt|benjy: This will be more imps for ENG|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs for giving us the helpful info,  also some funny comments :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: undo |pg||
nt|simonx:  ... so this is the last board of the match.  Engalnd are exactly on the 101 IMP boudary for a maximum maximum victory in VPs|pg||
nt|larrymori: west might X here|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: simple 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Strange dealing machines, with 32 boards yesterday and 16 today without a slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Saving them all to the last match tomorrow!|pg||
nt|larrymori: east would not like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yes but we expected a bit more from a very experienced pair here weho made some unchraacteristic errorsd|pg||
nt|larrymori: but down 1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|larrymori: unless the @d is ducked|pg||
nt|simonx:  There is a trick in each suit for the defence ... what can go wrong?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: oops...sry|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lark20: Should be the same in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  small heart lead and diamond switch would be inspired against 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  this probably needs a diamond switch too when North gets with the @hK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: K|pg||
nt|benjy: A spec thinks it's right to pass if you deduct a point for Jx, i take that point but yes, but a vul game, J109 look nice and Q10xx looks good, not so clear|pg||
nt|benjy: I wouldn't crime anyone for inviting, i think it's close|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand plays nicely with esp. with hts 3/3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|chick: it may go badly if N has to ruff with a heart honor|pg||
nt|sybarra: only has to ruff if ace of clubs cashed|pg||
nt|chick: although with the diamonds behaving, will still make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: or tried to cash |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|paulg:  just going to play for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but costs nothing to play k and finesse in s|pg||
nt|simonx:  How soon will South play a diamond?|pg||
nt|larrymori: might have tried a red suit first with the spade as an entry|pg||
pc|cT|nt|baldfriede: Thank yxou to all who made this vugraph possible, the organizers of the tournament, our excellent operator and of course the indefatigable Roland Wald|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|larrymori: trick 3 was the time|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|benjy: Thanks everyone, particularly to Victor and Germ, but also to our Vugraph operator and to the helpful specs!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: still probably right to take no chances|pg||
nt|benjy: Well played to the English Ladies|pg||

pc|s4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: took deep breath and hoped no ruff on @D |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
