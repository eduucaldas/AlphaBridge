nt|athene: entries slightly tangled though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: i am not a fan of competing when balanced |pg||

pc|d7|nt|vugraphzaz: Toilet break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who for :)|pg||
nt|ady: south got opps of the hook   no real fit  and not a lot of power    but has found a suitable dummy|pg||
nt|athene: one alternative plan was to pass, wait until opps bid spades, and then double for takeout - if partner passes, you are happy, but if she bids clubs you go to diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but with Kx you aren't expecting partner to be passing a t/o x very often i suppose|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: maybe give up on the spade finesse since no chances for 4 spade tricks anyway|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: and of course this plan has the flaw that there is no "double (takeout)" card in the box - only a double card|pg||

nt|jcomyn: phew but bad for the irish hearts|pg||
nt|athene: when irish hearts are cashing, as the song goes|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: dont remind me I am too old for this|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: west sort of has the values for 2@H but it's a very bad hand, with three small in spades, especially playing 4-card majors|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S a make for n/s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats enough|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: double there tends to be takeout of spades - i.e. west couldn't double the first time because of short spades|pg||
nt|athene: well, north might feel she ought to get around to showing some spade support some time?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: PASS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S  from south |pg||
nt|yo_yo: would it not show the other 2 suits?|pg||
nt|athene: it's fairly aggressive with only 11 hcp and 3 diamonds - one of the suits partner is going to be bidding a lot|pg||
nt|athene: but at love all west wants to bid i suppose|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 3NT can also make|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: i wonder why , with a balanced hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: decent game |pg||
nt|athene: run the @S10 first time to cater for Qxxx with east?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: you aren't missing many points - if you think the double has to have 12+ then west has to have the @SQ|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but need to ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|ady: need to ruff a diamond    with A@C a good bet to be right  can make 10 tricks losing a spade|pg||
nt|athene: yes, unless hearts are 3-3, which they really shouldn't be|pg||
nt|golfsquash: seems best to win and play a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: maybe declarer is a bit worried about trump control - let's say diamonds are 4-4 and trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: if she ruffs a diamond then loses to the @SQ and gets forced again, she can't enjoy the @CK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems best to duck this|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||

pc|c9|nt|athene: if you like the hand that much why not open it?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|simonx:  We will play two baords here before we see results form the closed room|pg||

nt|dburn: not all that clear for South to bid it, though|pg||
nt|henryb:  and even 5@d or 4@h make|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|henryb:   would have tried 2N rather than 3@d as N. David?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dburn: good effort, that - was thinking she might well pass|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: something to be said for 2NT rather than 3@d, yes - but that spade holding would worry me a little|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|henryb:  me too, but someone has to bid NT, and partner with @d and @s is unlikely to be able to do so|pg||
nt|dburn: 5@d is a pretty horrible contract, so this is perhaps a case of fortune favouring the undeserving|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I think South's name is spelt Cleary, operator, with an  a  instead of an  e|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Please correct|pg||
nt|henryb:  where as 3N is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|dburn: though I suppose it might improve if West cashes another club|pg||

nt|vugraphzaw: so famous down as Ena only!!|pg||
nt|dburn: was maybe expecting a fourth diamond with North|pg||
nt|simonx:  Is this just a matter of playing for the hearts to come in?|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h intended only as an offer of 3NT, not of 4@h|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you could try to ruff three spades on ther dummy if you like, but rather you than me|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|henryb:  can't do that anymore|pg||
nt|dburn: no - just need 3-2 diamonds and 3-3 hearts|pg||
nt|simonx:  yes, Alice could have tempted her with a spade return|pg||
nt|dburn: the defence might have tried three rounds of clubs, East ruffing with @d9 also|pg||

nt|athene: that is a mildly evil 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i know 2@C over 1@D has good pre-emptive effect, but you really do need either a club suit or a hand, or preferably both, at adverse vul|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she feels that as a passed hand it is ok|pg||
nt|athene: because at least her partner won't do anything rash, like taking her seriously|pg||
nt|jcomyn: grand especially when someopne whacks you for 800|pg||
