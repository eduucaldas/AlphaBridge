nt|marlowepi: N has a bit better than 6 LTC (Losing Trick Count), and thus has extras. N has 7 LTC and knows of an 8 card fit, enough to commit to game|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the safety issue is not even the biggest disadvantage of 2D. the most serious flaw is the more general point that it is poor tactics to announce a weak hand --when you have one, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is -- after partner has passed. it transfers opponents to a game they can probably make|pg||

nt|marlowepi: better off to open 1D and leave opponents in the dark about your strength while still attracting the lead you want. partner is a passed hand and is unlike to bury you. meanwhile, ...|pg||

nt|rodal f: Might a swing. 3NT?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but in england i would pre-alert:)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: case, W has so many low cards that no matter which one he played he would be concealing at least two hearts lower than the 7:)|pg||

mc|10|nt|rodal f: And wrong I was:)|pg||
nt|chick: We have played all 7 boards, just waiting now for the scores from the Closed Room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think N gave the defense enough thought. if whole S hand is AK of hearts, prospects poor. diamond king with S is best shot to beat the contract|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps S should overtake the @HQ|pg||
nt|chick: then W can't duck, or if he does, S can switch to @D|pg||
nt|rodal f: An ok side to bookmark is:http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php then u can follow a lot rooms.|pg||
nt|chick: heh, I have enough trouble following one :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i was wondering that too. but i think it is significantly easier for N to place S with the other diamond honor than it is for S to place N with that ace|pg||
nt|rodal f: New try:) http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|chick: North opened the bidding.  With the @CA in dummy, what can he have for his opening?|pg||
nt|rodal f: There we are the same Cornelia. The reason I've not opend it:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree that S could take the risk. but N can have an opener with something good in spades, whereas N can see more easily the need for a D switch|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W could have:   K98xx   ATxxx    Axx  --   |pg||
nt|chick: Is this a VP match?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcm: yes, it's VP|pg||
nt|chick: thanks .... so not so much hinges on the last board|pg||
nt|chick: so En bridgespiller wins by 1 IMP|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W has that hand, overtake by S for D switch lets the contract through|pg||
nt|chick: The next match will start in about 10 minutes, so stretch, get your coffee/tea and come back to join us again then :)|pg||
