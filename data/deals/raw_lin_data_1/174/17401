nt|vugraphzaz: Internet went down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: new board new chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: I expect an easy 3NT here 1NT-3NT maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: A good time to thank our Operator for all the work - must be frustrating|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: but we appreciate it|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but its dangerous to say what these players will do:)|pg||
nt|chick: We all know that Operator is the most difficult job of all here :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: not many players can bid 2D here because of disturbing conventions|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: I used to do the job but in the days when Vugraph onsite was done with overhead projectors & acetates|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well at last I guessed the bidding|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|idc: Declarer can make 9 now, but must keep entries to dummy to finesse @h twice|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|007 joosth: not if he starts with the K of hearts  then he needs 1 more|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i think the play and defence is really bad|pg||
nt|idc: But if West had Tx of hearts, would be different - should have kept a @c entry to North hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|007 joosth: Here 4S maybe after a Bergen raise|pg||
mb|2C|nt|007 joosth: well 3C then |pg||
nt|idc: 5@d a good sac v 4@s - a theme we had on an earlier hand as well|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: difficult to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: true, I doubt any E-W will find it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|007 joosth: 4S practical bid, but you might miss a slam|pg||
