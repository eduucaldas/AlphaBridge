mb|4H|nt|panja: and with @CQx here....it is almost certain he devalued 1 HCP|pg||

nt|vugraphzby: here everybpreempts with trash a 1@c opener|pg||
nt|psyck: rare to see precision players devaluing 1@c hands as 1@c opening allows more gadgets & relays|pg||
nt|panja: y, if they allowed that against Std...I would device different ways to do it against std..but then it is the holy system|pg||
