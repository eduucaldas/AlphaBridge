nt|yo_yo: my partner bid something similar to the west hand recently |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Morning everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unfortunately they cashed the first 6 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kath, Beryl, Geoffrey and Roger|pg||

nt|Walddk4: West is  S Punch  operator|pg||

mb|4H|nt|roswolf: i approve|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: Welcome all, Hi John|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR result ????|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch and McGowan play a weak no trump, 4 card majors and 3 weak twos|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch is one of Scotland's more aggressive players|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass and then bid 4@S/@H later|pg||
nt|roghog: South is worried partner may expect more, but she can't bid anything here|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but tanking like this is dangerous it may inhibit partner in later rounds of the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may feel her herself ubder ethical pressure|pg||
nt|roswolf: also there is the stamina fator|pg||
nt|roswolf: operator who are screenmatesa?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|eamongall: the old scores seem to be still there ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: McGowan/Youngs|pg||
nt|highshore: I think that with the singleton HK even a trump lead doesn't beat six clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not op|pg||
mb|6C|nt|kemperg: Hi Michael|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: the real score is about 78-15 |pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Germ|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Scotland lead overall but Ireland and England close behind 72 70 65|pg||
nt|roswolf: well an easy game for e/w - there shouldnt be any accidents|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems better from N :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a diamond lead isnt obvious|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: well north has a choice i would bid slam since for me south has shown values|pg||
nt|lark20: exciting auction for the first board|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  best I have at moment|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: lots of tricks on this lead though|pg||
nt|highshore: Lizzie Godfrey showing fine appreciation of her hand|pg||

nt|mikeirl: 11 tricks |pg||
nt|capercliff: afternoon folks|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and a sound result for n/s|pg||
nt|mamos: i could be wrong shirley but I think thats ok for Matches 1-3 but half time for Round 4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: but into declarer's bid, unlikely :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: We have a few typos in the N-S names|pg||

nt|dburn: and that part is easy enough, but...|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: isnt west endplayed in the blacks?|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure why declarer did that - why not run the heart lead?|pg||
nt|dburn: now, she doesn't have three certain heart tricks any more|pg||
nt|jpes: South cannot tell what works and needs help in sorting it out, but the 9th trick?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||

nt|ralfwil: must be corrected for the score|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east will bid something|pg||
nt|mamos: even the ruff wont threaten 4@h here|pg||
nt|capercliff: E/W have a profitable 5@d|pg||
nt|highshore: Looks normal to get to 3NT - preferably by S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chilloncan: when i said "from either side" i didnt mean EW|pg||
nt|roghog: not sure what happened, but it can be made|pg||
nt|lark20: Liz has been opening 1NT with 11 points quite often this weekend|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 6@de on N is a fine contract|pg||
nt|chick: 6@D makes easily|pg||
nt|lark20: But this is made clear on their CC|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now for the magical mystery tour|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S should imply a @D fit|pg||
nt|capercliff: I suspect West will bid 5@d over 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: that starts it out right |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|roswolf: did declarer really go off on the previous board?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i love that 3@D bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 4h but tight verfy tight|pg||
nt|chilloncan: from either side|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: there we go :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: practical auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should teach her not to!|pg||
nt|mamos: I've heard of 6-4 come alive but East's pre-empt is not exactly textbook|pg||
nt|mamos: 6-5|pg||
nt|roswolf: depends which textbook mike|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mamos: mis type  (mis-rhyme)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6/5 come alive|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: t/o obviously this second double|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I suppose 4nt was from N|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure this will get fixed quickly|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: lucky to find a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: at these colors south should probably go for the game now that opps have found a fit|pg||
nt|roghog: always lead a trump if this happens, but perhaps not so obvious with a bare K|pg||
nt|roswolf: east may well leave this|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mikeirl: need to avoid Nt here|pg||
nt|capercliff: very hard decision this|pg||
nt|roswolf: sindeed but the 5 level belongs to the opps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: sally knows her partner has values for her double|pg||
nt|mamos: South probably knows she won't get rich from double   is 5@h worth the risk ?|pg||
nt|capercliff: perhaps a better start for North would have been to bid 4@d on the way|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she can also guess the singleton @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 4@S bid sounds a warning|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: yes 4@D from north a good idea|pg||
nt|highshore: nice passive lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that wont do much for defence|pg||
nt|chick: the Open Room will drop their jaws :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi ralf:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mikeirl: difficult to lead from North hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: you can smell the ruff surely|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: unfortunately the ruff kills her|pg||
nt|capercliff: holding a stiff @d you know opponants will sacrifice in 5@d, best to set up the 5-level bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: Scotland put the pressure on here to good effect|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: west has to lead them|pg||
nt|roswolf: and does:(|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kemperg: s didn't open, optimistic 3NT by N|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mikeirl: very, passing 1h reasonable?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lark20: N/S do have 3NT on|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes hide that 4 sally|pg||
nt|capercliff: S falscards|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed will west work it out?|pg||
nt|capercliff: and now E can hold the 4@s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what other choice?|pg||
nt|roswolf: club?|pg||
nt|capercliff: holding the A@h she knows the @d trick is going anywhere|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@D yes  |pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: @D|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: there is a danger of south crashing the trump king here|pg||
nt|roghog: I wonder how many ruffs the defence will get?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: very easy now|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done looks like -2 only|pg||
nt|lark20: North doesn't want to have to lead|pg||
nt|roghog: @SJ, perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup |pg||
pc|h5|nt|kemperg: No|pg||
nt|highshore: this could go either way|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: sdpade|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@H was|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c6|pc|d3|nt|mamos: im afraid she will hook Spade|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mamos: shouldnt I think |pg||
nt|highshore: now a club to the ace and a diamond|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|lark20: @SJ correct but it gives away quite a bit of information |pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: hmm another trick to the defence|pg||
nt|lark20: trick 8 a bit strange. If North had had 5 spades, she may well have bid them|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kemperg: and 3@H after 2NT|pg||

nt|sybarra: and where does this end (at the 6 level) |pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: anyway 5 imps to england a triflr unexpectedly|pg||

nt|mamos: beyond|pg||
nt|copeyj: but not that likely I suppose :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Simon |pg||

nt|copeyj: 5@S now from Lizzie|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the heart suit even get into the auction |pg||
nt|copeyj: or perhaps 5@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @H might be good now|pg||
mb|5S|nt|chick: or perhaps even an inspired play of the club suit|pg||
mb|6C|nt|jcomyn: thats that with NS 4-4 h fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: that hardly excites South|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i prefer to bid 4@C to show a splinter and 4@S to show no shortage|pg||
nt|roswolf: a straightforward 3nt now|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @H??? |pg||
mb|6S|nt|kemperg: Lebensohl i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: a mild slam try by way of a splinter - a little forward that|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: hobsons choice|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With a careful play ew can make 4@s. Defence cannot attack @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and @h can be set up|pg||
nt|yo_yo: sally Brock, many times champion , see her biography: http://www.ebu.co.uk/general/biographies/players/sallybrock.htm|pg||

pc|dT|nt|jcomyn: the old 3-3 fit|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|ady: looks like only 10 tricks  if playing safely even with club finesse right|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice end position coming|pg||
nt|lark20: This should be fairly flat|pg||
nt|roghog: A quick claim after the @S finesse fails|pg||

nt|yo_yo: She  now lives a lot of the time in France (lucky thing)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please insert scores for boards already played|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You don't have to replay them|pg||
nt|Walddk4: on 19, 20 and 21|pg||
nt|copeyj: amazingly, NI played in 4@h on the deal Caplan went down in 6@C on next door|pg||
nt|copeyj: they are about to go one down in that 4-3 fit it seems|pg||
nt|sybarra: dealing machine went into high gear!   we had some interesting part scores before |pg||
nt|highshore: a stroke of luck for England|pg||
nt|copeyj: just another flat board :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: slam on EW but very lucky|pg||
nt|ralfwil: west could have bid 3@s in my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is not necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and it will take way too long|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Give me the contracts, declarer and number of tricks and I will give you the codes for MOVIE|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: pass by E??|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: The Irish pair are often to be seen in international events|pg||
nt|kemperg: would be good gamble|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: where will this end up|pg||
nt|highshore: does anybody else share my experience that supposedly random hands often become very wild at the end of a tournament|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: asptro?  @S and other  i assume|pg||
nt|lark20: On the lie of the cards 6@S is a possibility|pg||
nt|capercliff: will do well to stay low here|pg||
nt|mamos: too high I think|pg||
nt|mamos: North probably bid 1@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: or when you are tired they just seem wild?  (agree is my point) |pg||
mb|4H|nt|mikeirl: wouldn't favour 1NT opening with that hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: why not 2@S?|pg||
nt|capercliff: the @c suit will be hidden, and E/W have stoppers in the majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: naturrellement|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mikeirl: very concentrated points - 1@H would seem more superior|pg||
nt|roghog: 4441s open the suit below the singleton usually|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably - 3nt is a possible spot i fancy which SHOULDgo off|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@d rteally?|pg||
nt|capercliff: undu operator|pg||
nt|capercliff: E bid 3@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north will have passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: it could well be bid imo|pg||
nt|mamos: this is an excellent start to this half for Scotland|pg||
nt|highshore: a club lead beats 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Lizzie Godfrey happy to pass that with her 6 card suit|pg||
nt|chick: they will never look for slam on this auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H always "transfers" to 4 @S |pg||
nt|mamos: lol couldnt believe Pass by East  she doesnt use Pass cards much :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: well done:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: not necessarily with the odds but it does make|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass has been missed out|pg||
nt|roghog: thanks, operator. N bid 4@D|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mikeirl: tho it actually works here :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoops another there goes another rubber tree plant|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have no idea how N should find a club lead |pg||
pc|hT|nt|mikeirl: the 2@d bid works well here|pg||
nt|kemperg: she wants 3@D therefore not 2@S, good thinking|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: i still think 3@h looks wrong|pg||
nt|copeyj: nor I|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|highshore: quite - heart normal|pg||
nt|sybarra: if lucky wins K and unleads ace of hts, etc.  but wow,  I would ask where the mirrors are in the room|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|roswolf: claim|pg||
nt|yo_yo: wise |pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: surprise south entered    looks like landed ok   2 diamonds down 1  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: E has a lovely D piece and controls and source of tricks. i did not expect them to bid slam but thought E might look|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzaz: Sorry, yes you're right|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a little hard to follow but a wimp out at the end|pg||
nt|roghog: Don't worry, as long as we've got the right final contract, operator. Oh, that's fine!!! Many thanks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yo_yo: why not make oppos suffer :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|kemperg: in my system this would not work|pg||
nt|roswolf: play will be quick|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont really blame north except a spade was the expected lead by opp and therefore is likely to be well covered|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s8|pc|c2|nt|capercliff: you could almost see this coming, S wishes she didnt X now|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: it's a bit risky at that vulnerability yes|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: To take 12 tricks E must play @sJ to pick up @sQ765 on S|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|roswolf: wouldnt be suprised if this was a push|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|steshome:  Just checking the Wales vs Scotland match, which is low scoring currently and Scotland ahead by 2 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jpes: E doesn't have a 3N bid over 2N in any situation even way behind|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: raising looks normal assuming a nominal 20-22 2NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 10's|pg||

nt|mamos: not so exciting a hand :)|pg||
nt|highshore: 2@d or 2NT the limit here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: strong nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: "too high" turned out to be "not too high" :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: E/W play a weak nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: they may well struggle   especially if north finds a neutral lead such as J@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: liz enters the fray with the colors in her favour|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty for info|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roghog: 3NT for the super-optimist rolls home NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 3@C?|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: 3@H 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: 2NT 20-22  |pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: now everyone finds some extra values|pg||
nt|mamos: Easts's £nT fair enough imho|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks normal spot |pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: thats 6 tricks    |pg||
nt|kemperg: surly checkback i think|pg||
nt|mamos: op how maNY TRICKS ON LAST BOARD?|pg||
nt|highshore: agree with the upgrade. If, for example, East had a different K it may weel just need a finesse|pg||
nt|highshore: well|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lark20: N/S will lose 4 spades and probably 2 Diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: oops sorry|pg||
nt|capercliff: this E/W pair have never seen a game or slam they didnt like|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: i dont believe that lead|pg||
nt|lark20: you were right|pg||
nt|roswolf: that one i do|pg||
nt|roswolf: assuming a club switch this wont play well|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mikeirl: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roghog: Even if the defence miss their ruff, declarer has no real chance|pg||
nt|roswolf: the scots have bid the slam on the previous bd|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 suites to lead from, both give tricks  but ......damned if you do and it doesnt work, damned if you dont and it would have, you cant win :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|capercliff: and both have a lot of experience, Sheila MacDonald has been playing Lady Milne's for about 30 years|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: if the defence is tighjt   could take this down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont like the trump switch - where are south's values?|pg||

nt|lark20: Ah!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: we are connectd at the moment to the open room|pg||
nt|mamos: no sniff of an extra trick|pg||
pc|d3|nt|highshore: S will have to discard carefully and not throw two spades otherwise W may winle a trick with @s10|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|highshore: winkle|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: we are not connected|pg||
nt|roswolf: therefore the operator should shut down and restart|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yo_yo: Patsy Meehan trying for an endplay |pg||

pc|s2|pg||

nt|sybarra: not my sort of dbl in teams|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: misunderstanding     but 5@D makes   |pg||
nt|roghog: Not everyone' style to bid a 4-card major vulnerable opposite a passed partner - perhaps I am getting old...|pg||
nt|lark20: E/W have missed their 6/4 diamond fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H CAMOULFAGED THE POSITION E/W CAN MAKE LOTS OF @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: ah lizzie has retreated |pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does mr director think of that auction i wonder|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hi Eamon :)|pg||

nt|yo_yo: declarer can set up 9@S for @C discard|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe I am not adventurous enough|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: Quite easy to have these sort of misunderstandings after opposing multi|pg||
nt|lark20: a T/O double from Punch would have been better in this instance|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you just have to ask, what would north do over 2@H with a monter with hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: monster|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 5D 2H & C|pg||
nt|sybarra: or the reason I am a commentator |pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|athene: if you are agreed you always pass, then 3@H isn't natural|pg||
nt|eamongall: Gilligans Island ... that was some kind of killing movie I think |pg||
nt|copeyj: on the 6-6 and 7-5 hand here, next door England have bought it in 6@C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mikeirl: would you not balance with 2NT with the west hand John|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: at this vulnerability that is fair enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: on another day north might have rued re-opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: so that should be 15 imps to England|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3NT would make taking the only chance, 2NT moor difficult:)|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: I would have chosen 3 diamonds after souths 2NT   south might have been weaker     south  shouldd then go to 3NT with her values|pg||
nt|athene: ah, 2@D both majors - ok, so it was a different sort of misunderstanding, sorry|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eamongall: I did not like the 1S bid by South but no harm done here .. Is 1@D not normal|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: now she gets the discard|pg||

pc|d9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: not sure though what souths 4@H meant|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: when opps have shown both suits, do you cue to show a stop in that suit or ask for a stop in that suit? but of course south had a stop in both majors :)|pg||

pc|s5|nt|athene: the standard meaning of 4@C is certainly that it isn't inviting partner to do anything on her own|pg||
nt|ady: spec 3@H  aggressive  low point count    |pg||
nt|kemperg: a|pg||
nt|roswolf: quite correctly|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they got there|pg||
nt|capercliff: not a single wasted value, other than the Q@h:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: probably one down,  i cant see why she would finesse in trumps|pg||
nt|capercliff: bidding this slam would require the hand records|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: why not 3@s from S on 3@d?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1 down? @h are 3-3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah she can ruff the 4th @S|pg||

nt|yo_yo: kibs are saying that West should have doubled|pg||
nt|mamos: hopefully :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|ady: likely to go wrong   and try 3 rounds of spades|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: it's that horrible 9 count that creates difficulties|pg||
nt|yo_yo: sometimes you're damned if you do and it goes off, and damned if you dont and 4 is cold|pg||
nt|roswolf: a sober scottish kib states n/s are lucky that on these breaks 3@S is not making - i agree|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|highshore: I like the idea of scaring the opponents|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: in my opinion already denied a 4-card @s|pg||

nt|capercliff: should we reconnect to the Open room?|pg||
nt|highshore: quite a few now play that 3NT denies 3 cards in @s|pg||
nt|copeyj: should not apply over 2N overcall|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: coffe time for this hand|pg||

nt|roghog: 6@c for the imaginative now. yes, you'd make it|pg||
nt|highshore: 3NT succeeds as @cK onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@D would be a save if vulnerability level or reversed|pg||
nt|dburn: not all that imaginative - you have a lot of points and a lot of clubs|pg||

nt|roswolf: and with the slam in the bag the scots are in the box seat|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|mikeirl: nice bid 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: four hearts, on the other hand, is imaginative|pg||
nt|yo_yo: liz daren't bid 6 with those 4 small spades|pg||
nt|roghog: less imaginative|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 3@D is a bergen raise,  4+@H and 10-12 points (or thereabouts)|pg||
nt|lark20: The benefit of weak 2 openers|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it will make, so it may not be an excess of imagination|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with lebensohl there are ways of showing 4@H with a @S stop or without a @S stop|pg||
nt|dburn: just spoken to the England captain - or rather, I was speaking while he was chuntering|pg||
nt|dburn: so I hope he doesn't see 4@h make on this deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: another coffee hand |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Lizzie Godfrey probably safer to win this|pg||
nt|eamongall: True ... they want to make sure they arrive in plenty of time for the tea and biscuits|pg||
nt|kemperg: on pass W had a problem already, would u have bid?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: ace looks safest here; you don't want king - ruff - diamond to ace - club ruff|pg||
nt|highshore: looks like 500|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: if that is a weak jump overcall then i think it is perverse|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yo_yo: in case it's a singleton|pg||
nt|roghog: has to avoid losing three trump tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm so your law isnt foolproof david?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, we shall see|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has to time this quite carefully to make i fancy|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer needs to draw two trumps, cash four diamonds, two clubs and a spade, then lead a spade towards @h10 en passant|pg||
nt|dburn: the trick is to begin by cashing the diamonds - then, you know that four of them will live|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wish i could work all that out as fast as you|pg||
nt|dburn: but if you decide not to believe North's @hQ on the second round, you may go astray|pg||
nt|dburn: that is, further astray than you have already gone|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes timing is the issue plus declarer must forsee the hoped for distribution and ending|pg||

nt|yo_yo: it's the operator :)|pg||

nt|capercliff: by East yes, but W has to swallow it now I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: insurance comes into it here i think|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is indeed going off, so its not a double game swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: onishuk should manage a noise ...but this noise was unexpected |pg||
nt|chick: a noise like a very loud double :)|pg||
nt|eamongall: might make though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another way to find game:)|pg||
nt|mamos: still double figure imps|pg||
nt|mamos: or close|pg||
nt|capercliff: myu feeling is that West should bid to the 3-level right away|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if the @C8 were the @C9 this would be a much better contract|pg||
nt|eamongall: there is 9 tricks by scoring the @Hk|pg||
nt|roghog: did well not to lose the @h, but N has too much to pass 3@c|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: hioya bill|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|athene: no problems in the play here with trumps 3-2 and both black cards right|pg||
nt|mikeirl: duck will give problem to declarer, wd|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: this looks doomed with clubs 4-2|pg||
nt|mamos: dont understand Heart lead  was it 1@d opening?|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am sure it was 1@D opener|pg||
nt|highshore: Looks like S actually opned 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: possibly?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: there is a huge difference between having a singleton and a doubleton in partner's long suit - it's a reasonable decision to take a shot at 3nt with that north hand if you think ...|pg||
nt|athene: partner is balanced|pg||
nt|jcomyn: jeepers no excitement here at all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bryony did well to bid that awful suit|pg||
nt|capercliff: but her hand improves a lot after the 3@c bid|pg||
nt|highshore: this lead make life very simple. Leading fromJxxx is not often succesful|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yesfinely judged may need to be a little careful to make the maax|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: declarer's only concern really is a 4-1 trump break|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: but if she can have a singleton club the odds start going down very quickly|pg||
nt|mikeirl: oh|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ooooh sneaky|pg||
nt|roswolf: really????///////|pg||
nt|roswolf: england made the grand on 24 = +11 imps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|capercliff: South overcalled a @s(as you would) and that helped E/W|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kemperg: wow|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how nice :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yo_yo: are they playing 2/1 gf?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: auctions beginning 1@D - 2@C are very tricky without a lot of methods; many pairs have some special way to show 4-4-4-1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: their cc is the shortest one i have ever seen|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chilloncan: is this the actual auction?|pg||
nt|eamongall: she may even score 10 with @HAQ positioned well|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kemperg: is this possible?|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/caplan-godfrey.pdf|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: i am surprised the captain passed it, in fact|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

pc|sT|nt|athene: you don't want to cash the @HK and have someone show out, and then lose to the @CQ and see the defender draw two more rounds of trumps|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm e/w missed game in the other room - odd|pg||

nt|athene: playing three rounds of clubs might run into a club ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for round 1 results|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too flat to get excited|pg||
nt|eamongall: Wales need to stem this flow of imps as Ireland have another 5 pluses to score up in this room |pg||
nt|roswolf: egg all over scottish faces|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: (i am sure she wont mind me saying that)|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s putting on the pressure|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: might try 6nt here|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 6h but difficult to bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S now|pg||
nt|highshore: 3NT on top, 5@d by virtue of the lucky spade situation|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ady: have known Dianna for many years   good steady and reliable|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S asking for minors i assume|pg||
nt|mikeirl: off to a good start|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sensible as the 4-4 fit might well produce an extra trick|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chick: 2 of those 5 are partscores that could easily have been in game, so it's not clear they are pluses for the IMPs |pg||
nt|kemperg: trump start|pg||
nt|mikeirl: excellant so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: playing 4 card majors, I think I'd find a 1@S bid with S's hand|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 4s will get them there|pg||
nt|roswolf: well an easy make|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably 12 tricks even|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2@C presumable shows majors    a little flat|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6@c/@d also an easy make|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 4@H not positive|pg||
nt|highshore: Is E holding the same hand that we can see? Some action was surely appropriate|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mikeirl: ok  nv|pg||
nt|jcomyn: have A SKITE|pg||
nt|eamongall: sure I accept that but plus scores mean you won't lose terribly on the board |pg||
nt|kemperg: didn't like the splinter|pg||
nt|mikeirl: no but 2nt was & fit showing|pg||
nt|kemperg: of coarse|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but they are not in it|pg||
nt|capercliff: actually only 6@d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: she will take the spade finesse early and then try to cash everything hoping for 3-3 clubs or a heart-club squeeze i imagine|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|athene: entries slightly tangled though|pg||
nt|chick: true :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: i am not a fan of competing when balanced |pg||
nt|athene: south probably decided it was love all and hence vigorous partscore competition was the order of the day|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: Toilet break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who for :)|pg||
nt|ady: south got opps of the hook   no real fit  and not a lot of power    but has found a suitable dummy|pg||
nt|athene: one alternative plan was to pass, wait until opps bid spades, and then double for takeout - if partner passes, you are happy, but if she bids clubs you go to diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but with Kx you aren't expecting partner to be passing a t/o x very often i suppose|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: maybe give up on the spade finesse since no chances for 4 spade tricks anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is ok due to the lucky @H lie|pg||
nt|roghog: tempting to bid 4@h on such a good suit, but 3NT should be OK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: luckily for Punch the clubs are behaving|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she will have a few anxious moments though|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup actually a very fortunate hand - the scots cant complain too much about their good luck in this set so far|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|eamongall: I am expecting 180 imps shared after 32 boards once Wales start scoring a few goals|pg||
nt|capercliff: but I think this is impossible to bid|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: and of course this plan has the flaw that there is no "double (takeout)" card in the box - only a double card|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d7|nt|athene: so if you think partner might misunderstand double...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: east can see she has to keep that @C10xxx whatever else :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|mamos: East doesnt know if she's making this yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: she soon will|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: yes i am always nervous when making a take out double in these positions|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats the trouble with the system it gives the club game away|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe safer for Caplan to double 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: GIVE UP!!!|pg||
nt|eamongall: It is reported to me that the Irish pair in the open room are playing and bidding very well ... |pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzaz: ACTUALLY PLUS 2|pg||

nt|roswolf: a polish 1nt would have been useful here|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@s ?|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@s wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes danger of getting too high|pg||
nt|capercliff: she is worth 2 1/2 @s's|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: no|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: what would double be?|pg||
nt|athene: @DQxx is bad though |pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's that?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4 of the other major + longer minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: and decent values|pg||
nt|highshore: What would double by S have meant?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: too good for that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: double again or 3@D?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roghog: I prefer to double again now, but 3@d is fine|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled @H may be lost now|pg||
nt|dburn: it is fine if it implies hearts, but that is not a universal treatment|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hate it when partner jumps in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you are very fearful of east leading a short diamond against your club contract and getting ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: also south is in the pre-balancing seat|pg||
nt|golfsquash: trump promotion|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7 loser hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: sensible spot|pg||
nt|mamos: whats this 4@D ?  psychic cue?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ady: needs trump leads  and 3 too hiigh|pg||
nt|athene: now if you play the queen and opps carry on with hearts you are doomed - but if south attacks spades, declarer might get home with two spades, four clubs, two hearts, one diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: worth noting that north leads a heart rather than a spade - that's pretty much routine|pg||
nt|athene: with only four card suits you lead the one NOT headed by the ace|pg||
nt|athene: but south might find it hard to take the deep finesse against dummy - i think she should, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont blame north for passing|pg||
nt|mamos: Ah EW have agreed @ds|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: what do we suggest she bid and when |pg||
nt|chick: I think she is showing good discipline, knowing her partner is stacked in whatever trump they land in|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: WALDDK7 -WAS THAT REMRK SENT TO ME\/|pg||
nt|eamongall: a partner of mine always says ... "if you got a bidding issue , give me a suggested auction " |pg||
nt|dburn: nor I - this is usually just a strong jump overcall in diamonds|pg||
nt|highshore: West thinks @d's are agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i feel Bryony should have bid on here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|highshore: a heart lead will beat this|pg||
nt|eggy: Maybe west thinks that because they have|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|athene: now is it restricted choice on the diamonds?|pg||

pc|d5|nt|capercliff: is she thinking to ruff this high?|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 26 england in 4@S|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: play north for KJx not J10x|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: this  way also good enough|pg||
nt|chilloncan: passing at any and/or all turns MIGHT be right of course on any given deal....but if you dont bid at favorable  with 75 shape and approximately a 4 loser hand, you'll be fighting a ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: seriously uphill long-term campaign|pg||
nt|capercliff: are we disconnected again?|pg||

nt|mamos: would have opened 4@h with that|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: there was not much risk to a second double - partner did pass over 2@s, so will probably not jump in clubs (or anything else)|pg||

nt|yo_yo: lucky Bryony, the @H blocked|pg||
nt|roswolf: well teach them a sharp lesson - bid game when you can be passed out in partscore|pg||

nt|kemperg: and all other cards nothing special?|pg||

nt|roswolf: a diamond lead will be necessary to beat the slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: hard lead to find|pg||
nt|highshore: Does anybody agree with me that there should be a mandatory penalty of 3 imps for a mistaken explanation regardless of any other adjustment?|pg||

pc|c7|nt|golfsquash: great defence|pg||
nt|ady: east did well not to touch diamonds|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: the only way declarer might have got that one right is if she somehow knew the hearts were 6-3|pg||

nt|jcomyn: sorry she didnt think at all|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer wondering, is this a Grosvenor i see before me?|pg||
nt|chick: whatever it is called :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chilloncan: for those unfamiliar with Tartan Twos -- or their popular cousin, Muiderberg -- the underlying philosophy is basically: "let's push the opps to a game they might well not bid ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: otherwise, and also tell them how to make it when they might well go down if we stayed silent"|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|capercliff: did 4@s go off as well?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: this is true|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer might go wrong and rise with the king on a small diamond return|pg||
nt|athene: if she tries the queen and it loses, the defence can take the spade ace out of dummy before the clubs are unblocked|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|athene: so she is going more down|pg||

nt|athene: some play lead of 9 against notrumps shows 0 or 2 higher|pg||

nt|chick: or 1@S -- NS play 4 card majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: huge result for the english|pg||
nt|capercliff: brd 28 is waiting for 10 or 11 tricks in 4@s|pg||
nt|capercliff: 10 I am told|pg||

nt|eamongall: em ? operater|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe 1@D opening|pg||

mb|p|nt|mikeirl: routine 3nt Ew|pg||
nt|mikeirl: undo|pg||
nt|roswolf: lucky to escape the axe|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: west sort of has the values for 2@H but it's a very bad hand, with three small in spades, especially playing 4-card majors|pg||
nt|eamongall: not sure the 4 card major goes as far as opening with a 5 card on the side :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ady: 4@S a make for n/s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats enough|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@h?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: double there tends to be takeout of spades - i.e. west couldn't double the first time because of short spades|pg||
nt|athene: well, north might feel she ought to get around to showing some spade support some time?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: PASS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she's brave that Bryony|pg||
nt|roswolf: FINIS?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: finis yes|pg||
nt|highshore: looks a flat 3NT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: 2@S  from south |pg||
nt|yo_yo: would it not show the other 2 suits?|pg||
nt|athene: it's fairly aggressive with only 11 hcp and 3 diamonds - one of the suits partner is going to be bidding a lot|pg||
nt|athene: but at love all west wants to bid i suppose|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 3NT can also make|pg||
nt|chick: apparently not (although the @D suit definitely stinks) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for results and standings after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|roswolf: if west bids the axe will fall|pg||

nt|mamos: I think everyone needs lunch|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: decent game |pg||
nt|athene: run the @S10 first time to cater for Qxxx with east?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: you aren't missing many points - if you think the double has to have 12+ then west has to have the @SQ|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but need to ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|ady: need to ruff a diamond    with A@C a good bet to be right  can make 10 tricks losing a spade|pg||
nt|athene: yes, unless hearts are 3-3, which they really shouldn't be|pg||
nt|golfsquash: seems best to win and play a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: maybe declarer is a bit worried about trump control - let's say diamonds are 4-4 and trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: if she ruffs a diamond then loses to the @SQ and gets forced again, she can't enjoy the @CK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems best to duck this|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|athene: i mean you can open it 1@D in first with a clear conscience, so in third there is no question|pg||

nt|capercliff: the South hand protected in the other room, not sure that was a good idea|pg||
