nt|idc: In the Open room, East led a @s around trick 4 to save declarer a guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening all |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|idc: Declarer claimed after @s switch - I expect operator thought all rest of tricks but was only claiming =|pg||
mb|1S|nt|007 joosth: i suppose NS play 15-17  if so N upgraded because of the nice diamonds|pg||

mb|1D|nt|idc: Maybe the play was just going too quickly for operator to keep up, can't be helped|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nowadays the prempts are higher and higher  4S here or still 3S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|idc: Vul v not in 2nd seat should be very sound, so not 4@s for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I like 1@S :)|pg||
nt|idc: Maybe even 1@s but I like to open light|pg||
nt|007 joosth: disadvantage of 1S is that opps now found their save with 5D|pg||

pc|h2|nt|chick: http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: opposite 15-17, the West hand might be worth an invite - West takes the (non-vul) conservative view |pg||
pc|h8|nt|chick: no they play it only nonvul|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, ty|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: Well, you were right that opening 4@S at the other table prevented the EW save, but it also cuts off a lot of slam possibilities|pg||
nt|007 joosth: club ace will do no harm here, but I cant understand it|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Cornelia has done her research - I confess I haven't |pg||
pc|d7|nt|007 joosth: maybe he hopes for a doubleton in S|pg||
nt|chick: she* |pg||
nt|007 joosth: EW can try for a Mortons fork by playing a small H from E|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|007 joosth: again only 14|pg||
nt|007 joosth: reasonable but the risk is that NT is in the wrong hand now, without spade stopper|pg||
nt|idc: The other table of this match having a few hiccups, that's why we don't have comparisons after Bd 2|pg||
mb|1D|nt|idc: But they have just closed the table & reopened, so maybe all will soon be well|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|idc: 2@c showed any single suited hand|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I suppose something like stayman|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2C will have been majors,  but when 1 suit is much better then the other it seems not the best idea to me:)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4S on trump guess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|007 joosth: better = longer ofcourse|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: North hoped 3@c was Staymanic, South thinks natural perhaps|pg||
nt|007 joosth: NS getting in trouble here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: if natural N can start with a double maybe?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|007 joosth: maybe negative|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: If North had begun with a dbl, strength showing, that may have cleared things up|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 5C needs some good guesswork|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the lead may help|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a theory that if your six-card major is raised, Just Bid Game|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and likely to go wrong as on the auction W will seem like having 9 red cards. declarer could -- maybe should -- play clubs early to get the count there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has heard of this theory|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chilloncan: apart from theory, there is a principle that an opening bid (7 LTC) facing another one (7 LTC) is an automatic game bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|007 joosth: well S normally needs a heart ruff which will not be succesfull|pg||
pc|d3|nt|idc: May need to finesse against @sQJ, will be tough.   East did well to avoid @s lead|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe a double spade finesse?  she will wish to be in 3NT|pg||
nt|chick: on the other hand, there is holding for a heart sac, and no one bid them, so shortnesses less likely|pg||
nt|chilloncan: N actually better than 7 LTC|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|007 joosth: this J is really .....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|007 joosth: thats better:)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the concealing 2C bid will work now I think.  S will ruff a heart|pg||
nt|idc: heh|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is because nobody bid them that they rate to be 54 thus W has nine red cards. opps are red on green and thus very unlikely to sac. but the linference about no shortages also ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: holds for clubs, making it safer to  learn about that suti as suggested above|pg||
pc|d2|nt|007 joosth: wow|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|007 joosth: still the diamond problem|pg||
nt|chick: pretty nice play to cope with the bad trump split|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: nooo|pg||
nt|idc: and ruffing the 3rd round of @h won't work well either - too much to do I think|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|idc: East must have pleyed @cQ on 2nd round I guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no problems now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|007 joosth: looks like a squeeze in the majors but no communication|pg||

nt|vugraphzaz: Internet went down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: new board new chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: I expect an easy 3NT here 1NT-3NT maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: A good time to thank our Operator for all the work - must be frustrating|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|idc: but we appreciate it|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but its dangerous to say what these players will do:)|pg||
nt|chick: We all know that Operator is the most difficult job of all here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I think the inferences of relatively balanced means you should go ahead and play for 2-2 spades.  no need to risk a club ruff and go down |pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: not many players can bid 2D here because of disturbing conventions|pg||
nt|chilloncan: diamnd partial EW will probably outbid NS 2S|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|chilloncan: but is you expect balanced, where is the risk of a ruff?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|idc: I used to do the job but in the days when Vugraph onsite was done with overhead projectors & acetates|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well at last I guessed the bidding|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|007 joosth: thanks to the T S can cover|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|007 joosth: i think the play and defence is really bad|pg||

nt|chilloncan: = "how many passes before the club opening?"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: Here 4S maybe after a Bergen raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: well 3C then |pg||
nt|idc: 5@d a good sac v 4@s - a theme we had on an earlier hand as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: on a bridge trip a couple of weeks ago there was the following - pass, pass, pas, pass. One of the players said, "Is that four passes? That's a nuisance, I've got quite a good hand ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: here"|pg||
nt|chilloncan: LOL|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unauthorized information:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|007 joosth: difficult to bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the 1C contract could lead to a useful swing, 3H a likely final contract using standard methods|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|idc: true, I doubt any E-W will find it|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 4S practical bid, but you might miss a slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South close to a double of 1@s, but takes the conservative approach vul vs a passed partner |pg||

nt|007 joosth: supportdouble?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|007 joosth: 3H rather unusual as long S does not know how many spades N has|pg||
nt|idc: I was coaching a pair recently about this treatment: you can't play Unassuming Cue-bids by opening bidder|pg||
nt|idc: e.g. 3@h here to show a full value raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a reasonable 4S missed now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: well at least 4H will be 1 off|pg||
nt|idc: West has done well to put pressure on with the 4@h bid|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|chick: South certainly has a full value raise, but North has nothing more to offer, so I think 4S might be hard to find|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed   but the main problem is that S does not know how many spades are in N|pg||
nt|idc: and some work to be done - not sure you will make 4@s to be honest|pg||
nt|007 joosth: lucky for them is the 41 break in spades     4S will be almost impossible |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: S hand looks like an opener to me, but eye of beholder etc.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT has a slight flaw|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|chilloncan: was 3N conventional?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chilloncan: from E point of view there could be a slam|pg||

nt|mdgraham: on the lie of the cards there 5@d isn't exactly laydown - but you'd rather play that than 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|idc: not unlike last hand - SOuth strongish, North min, this time 4@s is on|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: interesting that West sees an opening bid in that hand |pg||

nt|007 joosth: I suppose 3Nt again|pg||
nt|chick: bergin-hill play short 1@C|pg||
nt|chick: "may be only 2"|pg||
nt|chick: that's why the alert|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: but not really cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: right, and thus cannot take it seriously for lead purposes, which diminishes the attractiveness of opening...for some, anyway|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: very light 1H  but also very useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: another easy 3N, even with a heart lead, because diamond entry in wrong hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|007 joosth: yes but a club switch will cause difficulties maybe|pg||
nt|idc: Maybe defence can give South a @c guess later, when they have 2 hearts & a diamond in the bag|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe 2H 2C and 1D looser then|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i couldnt bring myself to open 1S with the S hand. it would go all pass and dummy would be:   x    xxxx   xx   Jxxxxx, making 5 or six|pg||
nt|chick: Nice 1@S bid.  I see so many people open 2@C with broken suits, just because they have the HCP|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|idc: perhaps declarer should forget about diamonds, play on clubs herself|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chilloncan: i would certainly open 2C, but it would have nothing to do with HCP. rather it is just to easy to visualize a game facing zilch|pg||
pc|d4|nt|007 joosth: I think S should have taken this trick|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|chick: Marshall and I played once ... I think we lasted all of 3 hands :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S has a 3 loser hand, so if there is a decent fit there should be game even facing a near-blizzrd|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chick: if W wins the diamond and switches to a club, S has no choice but to go up with the K.  East has the hearts, and there are two cards to lose to if play low, and only one if play ...|pg||
nt|chick: the K.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: six clubs to the king and out and you have a possibel slam|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: If hearts were running that's true, but they aren't, so a guess|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|007 joosth: small spade will be lavinthal   asking 4 a small club|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the 4 is the wrong card|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|h2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: also 8 controls and two queens|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|chick: what you say is true, but there are a lot more hands where game goes down.  Since most play that 2@C is game forcing, it's not a good bid when you don't have any stand-alone suit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|007 joosth: but still not 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|idc: card says first priority on discard is suit preference, i guess @s2 clearer|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|chilloncan: opening 2C could certainly end up wrong. but when it is wrong you pay 50 or 100, and when 1S is wrong you pay double digit IMP swings|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some sort of squeeze possible when S oplays a spade now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chick: if partner is too broke to bid 1N over 1@S, you aren't going to miss many games|pg||
pc|hK|nt|007 joosth: to long thinking here?|pg||
nt|idc: indeed - a stepping stone variant?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|hJ|nt|idc: all very obscure, but quite fun|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it depends how far 2@C is forcing. eg 2@c-2@D-2@s-2N-3@C - is that still forcing, or has opener simply shown a strong near-fg hand that partner can pass?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: of @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Hil played with 12 cards|pg||

nt|jtr: Why win the K then?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@h needs some playing|pg||

nt|idc: If you don't feel the spades are strong enough for that, 2@c is a possible alternative, then make a further try if partner doesn't pass|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed 2C will normally be passed only with 5 clubs and weak hand.   as Lawrence suggests|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s2|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3S means about 10/11 and 3 spades Cornelia|pg||
nt|idc: If you were playing 5-card majors Cornelia, would you consider a 2NT rebid?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|mc|10|nt|chilloncan: righto. and when u bid them and they make, you win easily . if you stay conservative you lose by 3|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1NT is not forcing opposite 11 balanced, no. You may also want to pass 11 balanced, depends on the texture|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jtr: That is the flaw in the system IMO But it does have great advantages to outwiegh it|pg||

mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: it is very much the modern style to bid any game that has a sniff|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3D!|nt|chick: after opener shows a 6 card suit, 3@S only promises a doubleton, and she did have 9 playing points plus the long diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1Nt in N    when its forcing 2D  ending at 2S|pg||
nt|chick: and a doubleton 2 honors|pg||
mb|3S|nt|idc: Another hand on the same theme - here possible is 2@h, then 2NT over partner's 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: i think it best to stick by ur guns - if u bid them - bid them every time - if u dont the stay low everytime - at least ur pd will know ur style|pg||

pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: We should be back in Belfast 5 minutes to the hour|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Hopefully with an updated score in this match|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|idc: and that was even if declarer started trumps from hand - here things are even less promising for her|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|c4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|idc: On these first two boards, we won't have comparisons from the other table|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|d6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|idc: next board we go back to Bd 17 and (with luck) we will have scores from other table|pg||

nt|007 joosth: 2nT maybe in N|pg||
nt|007 joosth: so 4S seems normal|pg||
nt|idc: This Closed room starts with Bds 15 & 16, then we go to Bd 1 where we should see comparisons with the other table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. Well dne operator |pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: Thank you|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: anybody support 1@S overcall by S  - not saying i do|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|007 joosth: in fact a rather dull board now|pg||
nt|007 joosth: unless they miss 4S  :)|pg||
nt|chick: unless they manage to get into 3N :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|007 joosth: 3H will have been in S|pg||
nt|idc: I expect that is SOuth bidding 3@h operator?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: 3H ... not clearcut|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: 3@h should deliver a fourth trump imho|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: mind you, more exciting had it been East :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3NT now promisses 5 card but no 6 card spades|pg||
nt|007 joosth: this really is a fault of N|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I guess North was swayed by her source of tricks for 3NT in diamonds|pg||
nt|idc: but really best just to go for the known 8 card trump fit in spades|pg||
nt|chick: and now of East for not leading hearts|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y buy Ax  and Jxx + 3 spades are 3 good reasons for 4S|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the spade lead is a miracle to me|pg||
nt|chilloncan: final acronym omissible:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: don't really see anything wring with 1@S|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1S OK but 2N seems clear enough to me|pg||
nt|frankaus: what about 21D |pg||
pc|d5|nt|frankaus: 2@D|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 2D fine if it has that useful meaning|pg||
nt|frankaus: check if pd has 5@H  or 41S|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|007 joosth: maybe nice in pairs but not in team of 4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT is fine as long as you have some kind of checkback mechanism available|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|chilloncan: forgot to add :) after my 2N remark...it was an allusion to 3N off whole club suit a while ago|pg||
pc|dK|nt|idc: East didn't want to lead away from AQ up to a 2NT opener, but something to be said for just leading longest suit v 3NT|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chick: so North escapes a potential big disaster|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|007 joosth: haerd lead may present declarer with an extra trick, but it is by far the best chance to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|007 joosth: heart:)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: Other table just finished: I've been trying to manually score and think it is 18 IMPs to N.I. with this one to score|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c7|pc|hJ|nt|idc: NIBU went -4 in 4@h by West here, misguessing trumps and losing control|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|chilloncan: my feeling is that when you contract for game you should at least end up with more tricks than they do|pg||
nt|idc: heh, a sort of 'law of total tricks' ?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: good point....|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chilloncan: of course if you don;t, you can always high five partner because it was their hand and you stole it:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h8|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d3|mc|9|nt|chilloncan: corollary of burns' first law of thermopylaedynamics|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all, bye for now|pg||
nt|idc: so (possibly) a 25 IMP win for N.I.|pg||
nt|frankaus: tkx all|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ciao all|pg||
