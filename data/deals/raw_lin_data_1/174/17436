nt|copeyj: Good result for Scotland here from the closed room|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|copeyj: Looks like you can make 5@H if defence leads @C then @D switch, you cash AK@H and play A and another @S, clearing @S while u still have @H entry|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sheila a: N will be hoping for something big|pg||
nt|sheila a: Not really wanting to defend|pg||
nt|copeyj: N has a monster :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you play double here?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Will be wondering whether slam is on - partner unlimited|pg||
nt|simonx:  West bid 3NT over 1@h-1@s in the other room ...|pg||
nt|sheila a: It depends on whether this is a forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like double to be "I want to bid on but I have no clear direction"|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sheila a: Every partnership has different rules|pg||
pc|dA|nt|copeyj: If double is that then that's great|pg||
pc|d2|nt|copeyj: if double is not that, then pass should be forcing|pg||

nt|lark20: Punch and McGowan play a weak no trump, 4 card majors and 3 weak twos|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch is one of Scotland's more aggressive players|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass and then bid 4@S/@H later|pg||
nt|roghog: South is worried partner may expect more, but she can't bid anything here|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but tanking like this is dangerous it may inhibit partner in later rounds of the auction|pg||

mb|p|pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: lucky to find a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: at these colors south should probably go for the game now that opps have found a fit|pg||
nt|roghog: always lead a trump if this happens, but perhaps not so obvious with a bare K|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mikeirl: need to avoid Nt here|pg||

nt|dburn: declarer needs to draw two trumps, cash four diamonds, two clubs and a spade, then lead a spade towards @h10 en passant|pg||
nt|dburn: the trick is to begin by cashing the diamonds - then, you know that four of them will live|pg||

nt|mikeirl: off to a good start|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sensible as the 4-4 fit might well produce an extra trick|pg||

nt|chick: true :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i am not a fan of competing when balanced |pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzaz: Toilet break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who for :)|pg||
nt|ady: south got opps of the hook   no real fit  and not a lot of power    but has found a suitable dummy|pg||
nt|athene: one alternative plan was to pass, wait until opps bid spades, and then double for takeout - if partner passes, you are happy, but if she bids clubs you go to diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but with Kx you aren't expecting partner to be passing a t/o x very often i suppose|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: maybe give up on the spade finesse since no chances for 4 spade tricks anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is ok due to the lucky @H lie|pg||
nt|roghog: tempting to bid 4@h on such a good suit, but 3NT should be OK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: luckily for Punch the clubs are behaving|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup actually a very fortunate hand - the scots cant complain too much about their good luck in this set so far|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: and of course this plan has the flaw that there is no "double (takeout)" card in the box - only a double card|pg||

nt|eamongall: a 7-5 hand non-vul should be allowed a few bids |pg||
nt|mikeirl: 6s here |pg||
nt|roghog: correctly playing a @D now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: all to no avail though|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt here might depend on getting the diamonds right|pg||
nt|roghog: ...rather than running all the @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kemperg: 1@S $@C|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: 4@C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: e/w  may get to 4@H    should be down 1|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C or not 4@C?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: too much to pass|pg||
nt|athene: heart lead, ace and another diamond...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if W wont bid with that hand, i dont know where she thinks 36 IMPs are going to come from|pg||
nt|roswolf: a polish 1nt would have been useful here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: what would double be?|pg||
nt|athene: @DQxx is bad though |pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's that?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4 of the other major + longer minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: and decent values|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kemperg: too good for that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: double again or 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog: I prefer to double again now, but 3@d is fine|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled @H may be lost now|pg||
nt|dburn: it is fine if it implies hearts, but that is not a universal treatment|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hate it when partner jumps in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you are very fearful of east leading a short diamond against your club contract and getting ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: also south is in the pre-balancing seat|pg||
nt|golfsquash: trump promotion|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7 loser hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: needs trump leads  and 3 too hiigh|pg||
nt|athene: now if you play the queen and opps carry on with hearts you are doomed - but if south attacks spades, declarer might get home with two spades, four clubs, two hearts, one diamond|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: worth noting that north leads a heart rather than a spade - that's pretty much routine|pg||
nt|athene: with only four card suits you lead the one NOT headed by the ace|pg||
nt|athene: but south might find it hard to take the deep finesse against dummy - i think she should, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont blame north for passing|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|athene: well done|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|eamongall: what do we suggest she bid and when |pg||
nt|chick: I think she is showing good discipline, knowing her partner is stacked in whatever trump they land in|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: WALDDK7 -WAS THAT REMRK SENT TO ME\/|pg||
nt|eamongall: a partner of mine always says ... "if you got a bidding issue , give me a suggested auction " |pg||
nt|dburn: nor I - this is usually just a strong jump overcall in diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: i feel Bryony should have bid on here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: now is it restricted choice on the diamonds?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: stuck with this play|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8-1 for super trump fit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|athene: play north for KJx not J10x|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: this  way also good enough|pg||
nt|chilloncan: passing at any and/or all turns MIGHT be right of course on any given deal....but if you dont bid at favorable  with 75 shape and approximately a 4 loser hand, you'll be fighting a ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: seriously uphill long-term campaign|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|dburn: there was not much risk to a second double - partner did pass over 2@s, so will probably not jump in clubs (or anything else)|pg||
nt|lark20: 4@H is on I think|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: well done by south again not to be tempted by that spade singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if you are going to try for diamonds you better do it right|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: now trumps|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|athene: although @SQ K A, the defence would survive if north worked out to return a heart, as she probably would i think|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|roghog: yes, just ruff a @D|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d7|nt|athene: @H10 should perhaps be suit pref for spades there|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: since north is known to have @H109 at that point|pg||
nt|jcomyn: one dowen|pg||
nt|athene: two down on @SQ now|pg||
nt|athene: south knows her side needs one more trick outside hearts anyway|pg||
nt|athene: i think @SQ can't hurt can it? if partner has a club trick she will always come to it|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

nt|sheila a: good grief|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|ady: if hearts not blocked  3NT best game|pg||
nt|copeyj: Punch's 3@D bid persuaded Youngs that Kaye held a doubleton @H|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|copeyj: 3@h now?|pg||
nt|sheila a: it always hurts to re-open the opponents into game|pg||

nt|mikeirl: 3nt but not routine :)|pg||
nt|ady: likely south will play 3NT on a club lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: south, if she declares, can never get to dummy|pg||
nt|eamongall: Lets see what Irish Patsy Meehan makes of the 7-5 hand in the Open Room ...a lady who found a suit overcall of 1NT on a 4 count last night |pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: AGREED|pg||
nt|yo_yo: kibs pointing out that Kaye missed the Beer card|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: we woment dont think of such things!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mikeirl: need good view in @h suit|pg||
nt|athene: north might well end up declaring the notrumps|pg||
nt|ady: can see 7 tricks    will be difficult with no communications|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead in 3nt you are going to have to get the clubs right|pg||
nt|athene: and no reason to do that|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm unusual|pg||
nt|dburn: doesn't count when diamonds are trump|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: 2@C 2@D 2@H 2@S 3@D 3N if kokish for example|pg||
nt|golfsquash: I'm not sure what the good view is|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: and the english captain said that would be certifiable :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: hnn emaciated vu overcall by east|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: there was a hand last night where someone had a 5431 with a 5-card major and it was suggested they might open 2@C and rebid 2NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could get murky|pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyone for 2NT with the east hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|roghog: a bit weak, but count me in|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a little stomach churning|pg||
nt|lark20: yes especially with such a poor heart suit|pg||
mb|5D|nt|chick: 2@S shows 5+ spades and 4+ minor|pg||
nt|eamongall: that was a Tartan 2@S .. 5 @S and a minor 2-10 hcp |pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: I was expecting a 3D bid from S. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it would have to be an immediate club finesse, too, so you have entries to unblock them and then take the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yo_yo: i remember the quote yes :)|pg||
nt|athene: no way north will do that|pg||
nt|kemperg: unavoidable|pg||
nt|mikeirl: can they take treir 4 tricks?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lucky Bryony, the @H blocked|pg||
nt|roswolf: well teach them a sharp lesson - bid game when you can be passed out in partscore|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roghog: I'm told the beer card is the tia maria card in women's bridge. not sure if my source is authoritative|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I am a doubler|pg||

mb|2S|nt|copeyj: most ppl dont have unusual 2N available here as it is needed to show a powerhouse balanced hand|pg||
nt|ady: some play 2NT in north seat natural  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The other options are 2@D and 2NT if you play that as unusual (I don't)|pg||

mb|d|nt|sheila a: I think most people play this as @h and another - obviously Grant-Macdonald don't|pg||
nt|sheila a: I hope|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S would normally include hearts but not for this pair apparently|pg||
nt|ady: I tht 2@S would suggest hearts   and a minor?|pg||
nt|copeyj: Depending on what 2@S shows|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: any 2-suiter I think|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wld have tried 3@H with E i think|pg||
mb|3C|nt|copeyj: MacDonald fairly sure it is the minors looking at her hand|pg||
nt|sheila a: Frustrating for E to get no support with such a nice hand|pg||
nt|simonx:  South didn't bid 3@h - so they are on the same wavelength!|pg||
nt|ady: in light of south bidding 3@C   2@S  does not promise hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-E should have been partners. No great fit but lots of high cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sheila a: Macdonald must be tempted to double that|pg||
nt|sheila a: But not clear how strong partner is |pg||
nt|copeyj: partner shouldnt be weak|pg||
nt|ady: seems south should show the red card|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Not sure, maybe they want to play there. Double can sometimes get them to 3@S which they would otherwise not have bid|pg||
nt|copeyj: would be funny if south doubled 3@S having passed 3@H :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: although not funny for Sally Brock|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ady: 4@S a make for n/s|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: double there tends to be takeout of spades - i.e. west couldn't double the first time because of short spades|pg||

pc|cA|nt|athene: you aren't missing many points - if you think the double has to have 12+ then west has to have the @SQ|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but need to ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|ady: need to ruff a diamond    with A@C a good bet to be right  can make 10 tricks losing a spade|pg||
nt|athene: yes, unless hearts are 3-3, which they really shouldn't be|pg||
nt|golfsquash: seems best to win and play a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: maybe declarer is a bit worried about trump control - let's say diamonds are 4-4 and trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: if she ruffs a diamond then loses to the @SQ and gets forced again, she can't enjoy the @CK|pg||

nt|kemperg: now then|pg||
nt|kemperg: will not reach slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north will surely open 1@D in third|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i mean you can open it 1@D in first with a clear conscience, so in third there is no question|pg||
nt|kemperg: without @H 10 its sure:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 12 the identical auction happened in the other room for a push|pg||
nt|roghog: tempting to upgrade that 17-count|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: yes and staying low should gain imps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|athene: 4@S a bit exuberant maybe|pg||
nt|mikeirl: your right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: leading from Jxxx is banned in some circles|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: if you like the hand that much why not open it?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S was enough i think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: didnt expect that on 11+11|pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps 3@H instead of 4@D had a chance|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|jcomyn: but then against ropey defence|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: in my system thats 10 crda in @S +@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: as it should be|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but there wasnt an attractive lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kemperg: and slamtry|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|eamongall: Seems the vugraph operator is having a discussion with a high being|pg||
nt|roghog: I quite like to lead from Js - people never believe you've got it|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|athene: well, suppose the @S9 got covered by east|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: still not enough really|pg||

nt|copeyj: They sure have a shot this year, Simon|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Borderline 3NT that may make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West will likely lead a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and that is the 9th trick|pg||
mb|1C|nt|simonx:  If Ireland win, it would make 2011 a year for the record books, with Wales having won the Camrose for the first time after 75 years of trying.|pg||
nt|sheila a: Grant and Macdonald have bid a few borderline games already and usually brought them home|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have the balance of high cards   but e/w can make around 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: I don't think they will get to 3NT though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Full stop.|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gross has done well to bid 3@h|pg||
nt|copeyj: she doesn't have much and she is unfavourable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone for 2NT rather than 3@D?|pg||
nt|copeyj: but given that they dont play support X, she doesnt know if Brock has 3 or 4 card support|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Alone again|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think 3@d is a natural enough bid for people who can't see all 4 hands|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sheila a: good shot|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Well, 2NT does not exclude a contract of 3@D, does it?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|simonx:  Susanna will be refreshed for the play.  She has two young children (Joseph & Milly) and is normally woken early|pg||
nt|copeyj: I like 2N Roland|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sheila a: Against NT, on this auction, W would surely lead @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Surely is a strong word|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|copeyj: if south had KJX@H and E had A@C instead of KQ then @H lead would be right|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|copeyj: i don't think it is all that clear|pg||
nt|sheila a: But luckily it's all hypothetical|pg||
nt|sheila a: Declarer a bit short of entries to do everything she wants to|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, even a first round spade finesse is not enough|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|copeyj: Grant will surely play @h now and that is down 1|pg||

nt|yo_yo: last hand of the set|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator. Great Job! Our appreciation to the organisers, the NIBU and BGB for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Roger, Beryl and Kath for their company and perceptive comments. Also to our specs whose contributions keep us on our ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: toes.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lark20: As you said there can be big swings on part-score hands|pg||

mb|1H|nt|kemperg: Thaks specs and our operator for a good job|pg||
nt|mikeirl: thanks all|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: you would expect people to play 3nt or 4@H here rather than 5@D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why7 bid 2c vul opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: that is a mildly evil 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i know 2@C over 1@D has good pre-emptive effect, but you really do need either a club suit or a hand, or preferably both, at adverse vul|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she feels that as a passed hand it is ok|pg||
nt|athene: because at least her partner won't do anything rash, like taking her seriously|pg||
nt|jcomyn: grand especially when someopne whacks you for 800|pg||
nt|athene: south might well just pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not easy to reach game with 14 facing a passed hand and no great fit|pg||
nt|eamongall: I still expect Wales to come storming back in session 2 of this match ... they have won 1 and draw 1 so far |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: great website for the results etc   well done NI  http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: ok, well the pre-emptive effect of the overcall strikes again|pg||
nt|kemperg: can't blame E for that|pg||
nt|roghog: just the 8 tricks|pg||
