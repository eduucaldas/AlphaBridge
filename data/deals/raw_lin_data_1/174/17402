mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: NS play weak notrump but north must have decided that is too good, with 14 and 5 good diamonds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: these good 14 counts are always difficult, do you upgrade to 15?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  with bare spade honours and no tens?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharkey: The Law - 4@S |pg||
nt|jbgood: Roland vil gjerne (be)vise at også dansker har humoristisk sans - well done R:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes that's a good point|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Må være skuffende for Vest ikke at kunne bete 4@S, og da har makker endda et trumfstik!|pg||
nt|sharkey: På en god dag slem ØV|pg||
nt|athene: well they opened 1nt in the other room - maybe that was 14-16|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yorkbeach:  card says 2hx shows 6@h and 5-9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not wise to give them a push here mrs caplan|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Jeg syns S skal melde 4@S første gang|pg||
nt|baardolav: Dårlig bruk av svak løft|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S er helt ude i hampen. Hvad hedder det på norsk?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@s er ok... svak løft gjør du på 3kortstøtte|pg||
nt|jbgood: kan si det, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: helt på vidda   hører jeg|pg||
nt|sharkey: Om S har noen quacks i tillegge betyr omtrent ingen ting - styrken hans er i trumfen - svakhet ingen motspillstikk|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  surprised South bid not bid 3@h given her extra heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ignoring that seventh heart not a good idea|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's the strongest weak jump shift i have ever seen|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: but if north had bid a gentle 3@H right away over 2@H, even if that was not theoretically constructive, south might have given it a fourth|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yorkbeach:  need @s guess to make 4@h|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|sharkey: N tror S had 3@S også...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no guess now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  I was expecting South to high-low in trumps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: For resten, da skal man ikke grine af mig, når jeg foreslår, at bergenserne skal cykle hjem. et er vel en dejlig tur op ad kysten, ikke sandt?|pg||
nt|baardolav: Burde være greitt å ta en lav finesse i hjerter nå|pg||

nt|athene: a very good hand for a 3@S opener, but maybe 2nd seat at adverse it's ok|pg||
nt|athene: usually with a sound 7-4 you open 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Kennewell would open 4@s |pg||
mb|3S|nt|baardolav: Skulle være mulig å unngå utgang på disse kortene?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: ja|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: spesielt etter 1nt åpning|pg||
nt|jbgood: litt oppvurdering fra begge sider i lukket rom|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S should be good at adverse vulnerability|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is assuming that her partner has what she would have :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes i think most are raising 3@S there with three quick tricks and two trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks cold to us but the English south went 2 down |pg||
nt|athene: looks as though you should lose just the two trumps and @CQ, doesn't it|pg||

pc|c9|nt|sharkey: For kibs looking for commentaries in English go to Closed Room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did declarer really throw a @C on the @DA?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|petepunt: looks like 3n prob 1off for n/s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one for the deensive agreements - is North's pass forcing after the redouble.... |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: on a @H-lead there are 8 tricks for NS (after finess of @CQ) but E has entry on @DA - West has to find 5 discards so..?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: what are they?   most players like screens|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe but they do not use them very often|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  for some it is twice a year, once in trials, once in event|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|jbgood: har du ekskludert søta bror, Roland?|pg||
nt|athene: the english NPC should have laid down ground rules at the start:- revokes are ok, but keep them for the partscores :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Han er i lukket rom|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jbgood: hehe|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: another good 14 gets upgraded|pg||
nt|athene: this one is better than the earlier hand, though|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: the 5-card suit is way better and no ugly KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agree with the upgrade this time - decent intermediates as well as 14 HCp + 5 card suit |pg||
nt|yo_yo: revokes are common,  i  unfortunately do them quite often :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: yes  agree with the upgrade this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Jeg er faktisk den søteste af dem alle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: nr. 7|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hva er det som forgår her... Skal du si 1nt på 16 hp i andre melderunde... så får du heller åpne 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would certainly open the south hand a 15-17 notrump|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if West leads a @h, declarer wil be doing well to make this|pg||
nt|athene: she has to duck a heart lead in both hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Poor Lane is getting all the decisions so far|pg||
nt|athene: and play east for the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: or alternatively take the double spade finesse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in view of the bidding, West is probably favourite to hold the @dA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it her first appearance, i wonder?  If so, she will be nervous|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no played last year|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Lead out of turn TD called|pg||
nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|athene: if east was east leading a heart, declarer is just going to bar a heart lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's great,  she can forbid H lead :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what did the NPC say about leads out of turn? :)|pg||
nt|athene: he said, only against NV games, so this is fine|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now that I dont do , always face down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @d to Q and @h switch and similar position|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: card face up|pg||
nt|yo_yo: west on lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  of course|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @S lead probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: discussion about who opened screen|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could still go down even with @s lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  @D view |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but probably should take two @s finesses|pg||
nt|athene: there are ways it may still go down - if south plays it and forbids a heart lead, and rises ace on a spade lead and later misguesses diamonds...|pg||
nt|athene: but i think it is more likely to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Kennewell is now declarer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that mean they can lead @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: I will just have to give result|pg||
nt|athene: isn't there a theory that says you should always accept leads-out-of-turn, because a player who doesn't know whose lead it is is not likely to know what suit to lead? :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if so that's a bad decision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how does BBO cope with dummy being declarer?|pg||
nt|athene: it says "this would never happen if they were playing online!" and sulks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we might crash :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I have always assumed that revokes and leads out of turn are impossible in an online game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe I should try it sometime :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: as i understand the revoke rule, it's Lane's decision as to who is declare and the lead|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
mc|10|nt|yorkbeach:  do we think she asked for a @h lead?|pg||

nt|petepunt: another 3n -1 opportunity for n/s,  or can she pick up the Hs?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|highshore: There are alwys 9 tricks becaus of the favourable heart layout|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: also the ace of spades in the hand where it might not be expected to be|pg||
nt|pelu: in B1 NS missed the fine 4@H and sold out to 3@s|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR|pg||
pc|d8|nt|highshore: it would do no good for W to falsecard from Q10 doubleton because declarer can play a second high honour before finessing H9|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|pelu: if N duck this trick she will even make 3NT on @S-tricks - if she miss 4 @H-tricks|pg||

pc|d7|pg||

mb|1C|nt|yorkbeach:  having the ace in your own suit is  a factor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh i see Pat , what was the lead?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: NS have had three hands so far where they could open 1nt playing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the weak notrump was suppose to come up lots, or something|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:  normally it does|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  England South on board 3 opened 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult bid for North|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@C is a bit of an underbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  3@d stopper ask?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: or is it a @C raise?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: a bit difficult here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  from South over 3@c|pg||
nt|athene: north would like to cue the diamonds to show a good raise in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but 3@D cue takes her past the level of 3@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North could bid 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt would get the job done|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@d stopper would be enough as the cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: you can use 2nt as a good raise also when the cue is too expensive just in general|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: Sjanse her for Kristiansand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: ikke det...|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  not going to be very exciting|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT or 4@s with overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: Siste spill nå ved dette bordet, takk til Snorre for fin jobb som organisator, videoprodusent og operatør!  |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S+1, flat board, yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do you treat the four 5@s as 4?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 4@s better - just testing :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: Takk også til BBO og uoppslitelige Roland Wald (som har holdt på siden 8 i dag tidlig - og som har tatt en pause), og kommentatorer Carl Mathiesen og Baard Olav Aasan!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it might be slightly tricky for declarer to reach dummy twice for this spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: assuming we get a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: she might just finesse once then cash the ace|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: Og takk til tilskuere for interessante innspill - og tålmodighet:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gratulerer til Bergen - og lykke til videre|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't really want to spend half an hour ducking hearts for a heart ruff to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: that might incur diamond ruffs and all sorts|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok|pg||
nt|athene: well that makes life easy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: a reasonable lead, to be fair - on this auction you expect declarer to have three trumps and quite possibly a ruff in hand|pg||
