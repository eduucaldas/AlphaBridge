nt|ahollan1: NS convention card from 2010 European Championships   http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2/1 with gadgets for N-S, Precision for E-W|pg||
nt|woozle: We might get an early look at philosophies here - let's check out how Chang and Madala handle these|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Al|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: nice easy deal to start off with|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|woozle: Chang is there with a weak two in hearts - he's perfectly strong enough, but the ace-empty suit and spade holding are flaws which suggest there might be other spots|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|woozle: Huang has little interest in niceties like 3H making 3 opposite a minimum - he bids a practical 4H|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS reverse count & attitude    odd/even 1st discard|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: 8 card fir in @H work fine - 4@S - also 8 card - not so easy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: Patrick Huang played in a Bermuda Bowl in late 60s, veteran's veteran:)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c3|pc|d6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|woozle: played the far east in the 50s, and won it (among many other times) last year|pg||

nt|chilloncan: welcome back folks |pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: I believe we are now down to 12 teams in the main event, with 4 unbeatens and 8 who have lost once.  It's sort of a double elimination format (sort of because placement in the ...|pg||
nt|pef: round robin counted towards whether you went into the knockout stage with one or zero losses recorded)|pg||

nt|panja: Good Morning all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|pef: does anyone know sementa and duboins methods well enough to explain why sementa's hand didn't quality for a non-vul weak 2 bid?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Joe, yes the top 8 qualifiers got two lives|pg||
nt|fluffy: I am no expert on neither pair's system, I am surprised that Sementa didn't open with a preempt|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mrdct: ew could quyite easily make 5 of a minor here|pg||
nt|frankaus: link to tourney webb site  - http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome all to this prestigious Yeh Brothers toruniy |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not good enough I expect|pg||
nt|fluffy: It might be simply a suit quality problem given the position|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: good morning|pg||
nt|mrdct: need to be in 3NT rather than 5@d here|pg||
nt|jcwla: A singleton ask will get them there.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or not needed.|pg||
nt|kemperg: change the names please|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Germ, all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Germ and Gonzalo|pg||
nt|fluffy: Open room saw north open a weak NT, wich buried the diamond fit after the heart overcall, now south is poalying 6@c with the bad split|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Raija |pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|pef: east west rate to end up in 4 of one of the majors|pg||
nt|fluffy: second position is the worst position to preempt and you want the preempts to be pure suposedly. Third position, on the other hand is a different story as Mark Lair just showed|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mrdct: west showing his minor 2-suiter|pg||
nt|kareno: 5 of a minor will likely make e/w but n/s have a huge spade fit so they will likely not sell at that level.|pg||
nt|frankaus: $US 100,000 to winners !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d by east is best to minimise the chance of a @c ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx |pg||
nt|mrdct: welcome back to wuxi|pg||
nt|bg: pass by W strange if 1nt =15-17|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello. Nice to be not alone.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello and welcome to the 4th round of the qualification for the YEH Bros. Cup.|pg||
nt|pef: I'm a bit surprised duboin doubled instead of bidding 3 spades|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants online at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/Systems_Open.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: very pretigious event each year |pg||
nt|mrdct: east telling partner he has equal length in the minors|pg||
nt|kareno: West likely will bid clubs - then we'll see what north does.  Exciting from the get go!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: meanwhile NS are cold for 5@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Friederieke|pg||
nt|kareno: Welcome Henry Bethe :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats ok if all else is well|pg||
nt|kemperg: has squeeze possibillyties|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|fluffy: in 6@c you have 2 ways of going down (@d-@s squeeze and the wrong finese)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I think 4NT is natural|pg||
nt|fluffy: showing a minimum hand with good hearts not willing to go to the 5 level|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|mrdct: this match is from the top half of the draw so the winner plays another undefeated team from the top half and the loser plays a winner from the bottom half of the draw|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kareno: And that he wants to compete :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: possibly that was just the contract not the auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  Greetings|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt by south works fine!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Gary.|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Not the real auction, but i got here too late|pg||
nt|frankaus: team members ay - http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/entries.aspx|pg||
nt|kareno: South's double doesn't make sense to me - he doesn't want to defend.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fine auction:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Gary and Jordan|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi G|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi G.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: @HAQ protected now, although @s lead and @h through will put some presure on declarer|pg||
nt|benjy: Would you guys bid 1@S over a X? I wouldn't dream of it|pg||
nt|pef: they were going for 4 in 4c, but hard for sementa to do anything but bid 4 hearts there|pg||
nt|pef: this should be pretty dull in the play--making exactly 5 would seem completely normal|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mrdct: but 6 of a minor still a good save|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine Precision e/w|pg||
nt|peachy: The USA Hampson team both pairs play Precision type system|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not exactly a predicted auction but they've gotten to the normal spot.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|kemperg: and Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like -1 , -1 is good bridge some say|pg||
nt|frankaus: i play lots of good bridge  by that measure|pg||
nt|fluffy: Mark had just 1 shot to decide for a contract, and he settled for slam in clubs, the suit quality had a great impact|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: both of our pairs using transfer responses over 1@C  and as we see here -- in competition|pg||
nt|kareno: When you save over the five-level you have to be RIGHT.  If they cannot make 5 you are wrong and if they can make six and bid it, you are wrong.|pg||
nt|kareno: You need mirrors to defeat 5@c|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes its right to take out insurance enen if ur -1 in both directions|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: And actually if west ducks the improbable heart lead, it will make too.|pg||
nt|mrdct: it would be a bad start to the match to defend 5@cx making when you are cold for 5@s yourself|pg||
nt|frankaus: exciting hand to get us on the way|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@d - anyone know what that is?|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a limit raise of @s with no shortages|pg||
nt|frankaus: duessing  - good @S raise|pg||
nt|frankaus: guessing|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm hearing limit, no short suit ... and Bergen.|pg||
nt|kareno: In any event, Bocchi's sniffer is working hard!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: CC from 2010 Euro is  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is he bids one more....your guess?|pg||
nt|frankaus: bochhi's hand hast little defence|pg||
nt|kareno: The 4-1 split may make things rocky for declarer.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like some sort of lebensohl variant here with south probably showing 4@s and no @h stopper|pg||
nt|mrdct: 8 top tricks and 9th can come in either red suit|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|kareno: He's all offense and no defense!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Friederike, all|pg||
nt|kareno: But happily for declarer, that is quite unlikely - more likely with the auction, however.|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Xu|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes i play great bridge  ( i go -2) LOL|pg||
nt|mrdct: and there is the 9th trick - now looking for a 10th|pg||
nt|panja: this can go down on promotion|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fluffy: some specs, better players than me said that having 3 spades, specially with a honnot is a negative factor for preempting in another suit, I don't agree, but they are better than ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: me so they should know! :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: easy make on the @s lead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: system aside, opening a hand with 8.5 losers and a 4333 11 count is swimming against the current|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyway, the idea is you want to have a singleton ask in place in case your @D's were say headed by Q instead of K.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mrdct: @h lead less attractive now|pg||
nt|sybarra: you sound like an auctioneer Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i think joe will run for border|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: Are e/w names surnames or first names, Operator?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: np Andrew welcome all|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not mad about his pass particularly if south's first bid showed as many as four spades with invitation.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North is  Hackett|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello and welcome to the 5th round of the qualification for the YEH Bros. Cup.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugrapha4: Hi Gary, I'll check when I can|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's customary in most parts of asia to use first names|pg||
nt|fluffy: he risks facing dummy with @c singleton and decent diamons (even 5 cards possible), but what he doesn't want in any way is to face @dQxxx or @dJxxx|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude    Klinger-Mullamphy odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: surnames only please|pg||
nt|peachy: I, too, think Jow ill take his nine and then see what is left|pg||
nt|peachy: *Joe|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice competitive bidding to push EW to the limit|pg||
nt|fluffy: and play in 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, 10 actually already|pg||
nt|wygbe1: well defended|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: these names are left over from previous match|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will go down 2 but give Netherlands an IMP.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing that EW  are Verhees - van Prooijen|pg||
nt|henryb:  You do not know whether declarer's @h are that robust. Coult easily be AJx|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: Declarer relieved I'm sure.  And now diamond finesse for safety.|pg||
nt|kareno: It can be effective - it's perfectly normal for Meckwell, one of the world's premier pairs.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: also normal for a lopt of ineffective pairs. i have a strange hunch Meckwell would occasionally win even if they didnt open these:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mrdct: as first name is usually but not always the family name|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes need to hook or duck a @d to maintain communication to the entryless dummy|pg||
nt|kareno: I am told: first name. Hiroki Yokoi and  Kazuo Furuta.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|frankaus: 12 is a nice start|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed, in a short match too.|pg||
nt|mrdct: running scores: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=1&tourid=902|pg||
nt|kareno: I assume this is a round robin phase.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 10 rounds of swiss|pg||
nt|panja: no, not 1@S for me, I would never...|pg||
nt|benjy: I think North should get this right|pg||
nt|benjy: the only time it is wrong to play a @C is when west is 4432 without the @DQ|pg||
nt|benjy: but if he held that hand then he prob wouldn't bid 2@H|pg||
nt|wygbe1: n may be concerned that s has spade king|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|Walddk3: http://tinyurl.com/3dtwfd9  for standings|pg||

nt|kareno: I knew those were first names - but I have TWO first names so wasn't sure :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Well done!!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: South's @S7 should indicate he does not have @SK|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Friedirike|pg||
nt|wygbe1: souths carding was pretty informative though|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c3|nt|mrdct: when i used to work in Indonesia I was always called Mr David by my staff|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kemperg: no problems left|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Well, declarer does not know that yet.|pg||
nt|kemperg: lookes like a double squeeze|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kemperg: @D not 31|pg||
nt|fluffy: the way it has gone, he now also has another way to make: score his trumps separatelly!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kareno: More information: both professional players. W:20's, E:early 30's.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Going down three now. Commentator's curse.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only person who calls me 'Miss Karen' is my doctor's receptionist :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have pitched a @s from dummy, cashed one high club before running @d|pg||
nt|benjy: A chance missed|pg||
mc|11|nt|pef: and now a quick claim|pg||

mb|d|nt|woozle: and age hasn't dulled his abilities - last year he practically anchored the team, playing with several different partners|pg||
nt|pelu: would u overcall 1@D on 10 high?|pg||
nt|woozle: I might, with some other hand. For me, this hand would be 1H or pass|pg||
nt|rv: I am told by knowledgable specs that Morris Chang is chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is visible via   http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php    or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
mb|r|mb|1H|nt|rv: Patrick's X is ultra aggressive as well|pg||
mb|1N|nt|woozle: More likely to bid with a hand resembling this one if the long suit were a major, but it's farfetched to suggest that South will need to compete in diamonds|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT and 5@D making - and NS will bid game - I exp :)|pg||
nt|pelu: this time I agree with u Kieran - if I have to bid - then 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: bold from Patrick, or a typo?|pg||
nt|rv: I wouldn't have O/Ced 1@d, either 1@h or pass for me (preferred choice) with Madala's hand|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure an undo|pg||
mb|3N|nt|woozle: If so, the double won't cost much if EW are already well beaten on the board...maybe North will reconsider|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: with a bit of a time delay  scores from all matches will show up under  http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=902   [just click on link for appropriate Knockout ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Round]|pg||
nt|woozle: maybe an eccentric psyche|pg||
nt|rv: Vu-graph operators do have a tough job especially with fast players|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW stole the hand in 3@H - 1@C - Pass - 2@h (alert) - P - 3@H |pg||
nt|woozle: Well stolen sirs|pg||
nt|rv: maybe Patrick thinks he has to unsettle opponents or play a bit randomly against superior and much well prepared opponents|pg||
nt|rv: I remember SA used similar tactic and with some luck defeated Italian team in World champs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't quite understand this auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that 2@H bid is sometimes called "Reverse Flannery"  showing 5@S & 4/5@H with less than invitational strength|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Duboin certainly was less than invitational|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Patrick can't have bid like that with those cards|pg||
nt|woozle: That's never struck me as a major problem hand|pg||
nt|rv: Dennius are we playing right board and is auction fine?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think we need some undos|pg||
nt|rv: Dennius is our Vu graph operator for this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: it could be Pass from West, 3Nt by N and D by East|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: mark has a bit of a problem here, values to overcall, but the 5 card suit is terrible|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other tables visible using  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@c likely a diamond raise.|pg||
nt|mrdct: the top 15 teams plus Mr Yeh's team qualify for the KO stage with the top 8 (including Mr Yeh) getting a double KO advantage|pg||
nt|frankaus: is this correct or did we have a pass missed?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this a trap pass|pg||
nt|benjy: Do you guys rebid 2@S here?|pg||
nt|pef: 2 hearts may be weak with both 5 spades and 4+ hearts.  that's a fairly common treatment these days|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@h is a convention that shows 5@s, 4@h and 5-8 points I think, Duboin is lieing about his strenght|pg||
nt|pef: some play it as weak as duboin's hand, actually|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: excellent|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c is a transfer to 2@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s on ice here|pg||
nt|henryb:  or tied and gone on to win in OT|pg||
nt|mrdct: i haven't had that good fortune|pg||
nt|algraves:  lilght overcall at favourable vulnerability opp passed partner looking to pre empt or find a profitable save|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how many spades do we play or how many hts?|pg||
nt|pef: the end result may be to prevent north/south from getting to a making vulnerable 3nt or 5 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Richman-Griffiths playing previous board in 5@C|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like eight tricks is the limit for both sides.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: curious 2H bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  or lost in OT|pg||
nt|panja: EW have Aces, NS, the middle cards..|pg||
nt|benjy: or 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: red 2@D overcall would not be everybody's choice|pg||
nt|kareno: Mixed raise I imagine - 4 trumps and 6-9|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|kareno: Wrong vulnerability for n/s to compete further.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s the likely spot for EW now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: two easy boards to start|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3@d aSKS FOR STOPPERS IN 1D; i PRESUME:|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oops,sorry|pg||
nt|chilloncan: once more into the breach, my firends|pg||
nt|mrdct: no obvious source of tricks for declarer here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not a textbook double -- but often as here @C's will be long -- but in Geoff's hand too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ew have a @S partial|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6NT -1 in OR|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet JoAnn comes in now |pg||
nt|pef: 3 hearts will be down 2 or 3, but a great result for the Chang team, I think|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   1@S= either   bal 6-9 or 13+   OR   4+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this structure  1@C-1N = 10-12|pg||
nt|chilloncan: another 8.5 loser hand, but this time a viut of shape and favorable colors|pg||
pc|d6|nt|baldfriede: stoppers in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: no fear for joe grue|pg||
nt|kareno: Big bid by Joe Grue|pg||
nt|kemperg: or dbl:(|pg||
nt|algraves:  east sees no reason the bid with such good defense|pg||
nt|mcarroll: same auction in OR|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcarroll: EW had 3NT with the 2-2 @D break|pg||
nt|henryb:  and likely to give back the imp from board 1 with interest|pg||
nt|mrdct: best defence should get this for 500|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: awkward choice for south|pg||
nt|sybarra: some have suggested she should bid 4 right away|pg||
nt|fluffy: you mean for Lavazza team, Chang missed the cold 3NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a cc for Sementa-Duboin http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|pef: sorry, yes, I mean the lavazza team|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Now stop, or else.|pg||
nt|kemperg: Not for the OR, NS in 4@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 1|pg||
nt|kemperg: not sure of the meaning of 3@C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: whatever it is it seems a bit pushy opposite a possible flat 15 count|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I was told 3@c is puppet; I thought it was a real suit.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: board 1 was flat, this won't be :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugrapha4: North is declarer - his favourite seat!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with stif spade opps probably have that suit so hearts and clubs are the same suit, so why emphasize hearts when u can show both>|pg||
nt|bg: S has no confidence in pards vul 2 H call|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah he hasn't conveyed his 2-suiter|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have bid 4@s with Hiroki's hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Good lead.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like he'll scramble for 2 tricks in each suit except @d where he's got one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not the idea contract or start|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mrdct: yep - a likely push|pg||
nt|benjy: the problem with rebidding 2@D is that if partner bids 2NT then 3@S would be forcing, if you start with 2@S then you can rebid 3@D over 2NT as non forcing, but you may lose the @D ...|pg||
nt|benjy: fit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kemperg: Xu did not mark it as conv.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only source of tricks will be the defense :)  Clubs work well for declarer.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s might actually make here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was thinking same |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: So looks like the first swing of the round|pg||
nt|kareno: Dave :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: a more passive lead may have worked better for the defence|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Brother Cavier lives !!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: EW convention card from 2010 European Championship   http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/poland/buras-narkiewicz.pdf|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Xavier|pg||
nt|kareno: There's a very fine player in Canada, Irv Litvack who is known for his passive leads against 1nt -|pg||
pc|s9|nt|benjy: Looks like 1 down, if south exits with the K@S which looks normal enough|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: in practice, it makes though |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mrdct: a chance to strip the hand and endplay west to go -1 if the defence isn't sharp|pg||
nt|panja: true, but the issue is also of expected fit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: these are short matches only 10 boards|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|mcarroll: 10 tricks looks pretty standard|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bg: 450 next|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=7&tourid=902  for standings after round 7 of 10|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: Kit Woolsey is trying to convert the world from leading from 4 card suits.  [oversimplification]  IF you don't have a 5 card suit -- try to hit partner's length by leading from 3|pg||
nt|algraves:  accurate bidding by NS|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  I think W is being too subtle|pg||
nt|kareno: That heart seven very revealing.|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But singleton @D led so it went off as the N hand got a @D ruff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|baldfriede: That's why I thought it is real.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s failed in the other room|pg||
nt|chilloncan: to exportone;s reputation, the contracts at stake have to be games or slams:)  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|kemperg: was not nessesary|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to valerie westheimer |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi:-)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Valerie, thanks for joining here|pg||
nt|mrdct: lost my connection for a tick - so this looks like a very good sacrifice|pg||
nt|mrdct: so good that it can actually make|pg||
nt|peachy: hehm the best ones are the ones that make|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: hmm, looks to me like it's making, assuming he guesses spades|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hiya, Roland.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: the Open Semi-Final and Women's Final are 64 boards matches split into 4 16-board segments|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on this hand it's difficult to decide which if either @H/@S was better for defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 2nd  16-board set in the 64 board Semi-Final   Women are playing the same boards in their Final match|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h5|nt|kemperg: no sorry EW|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Roland|pg||
nt|mrdct: get @s right not a gimme here of course as the hook is kind of indicated on the auction|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kareno: So a fine result for Japan.|pg||
nt|henryb:  lots of interest|pg||
nt|mrdct: 7 or 12 imps for japan - probably 12|pg||
pc|hA|nt|baldfriede: That was not the right idea. Declarer had to discard a @d|pg||
pc|h8|nt|benjy: A spec points out that 2@D also gains when partner bids 2@H|pg||
nt|panja: if I had, say KJT9xx of Spades...I might prefer 2@S..but with Axxxxx, 2@D is ok, or perhaps a little more attractivve|pg||
nt|benjy: I agree, i think i would treat that suit a s a 5 bagger|pg||
nt|benjy: and bid 2@D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kemperg: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|jcwla: Redouble not an impossibility here, then maybe a bigger hit.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mrdct: west will avoid getting endplayed now|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the closed room the defence cashed @dAK so no @d for declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugrapha4: East is squeezed |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hT|pc|dA|nt|kareno: Well done.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good defense.|pg||
nt|fluffy: Weichsel couldn't see all cards and was focused on gettin 1 off, but if he returned a club he could get many more tricks as Duboin wold lose the control and the diamonds would end ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: up running|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice defense in a losing cause.|pg||
nt|fluffy: after he won @hK I mean|pg||
mc|6|pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1S964HA8DT72CK8643,SJ3HK63DAKJ943CQT,SKT5HJT942DQ8CJ95,SAQ872HQ75D65CA72|sv|e|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|woozle: Some people have suggested that Huang shouldn't have doubled...thank you all - I never knew that entering the auction voluntarily with a balanced 2-count wouldn't always work out ...|pg||
nt|woozle: well|pg||
nt|woozle: I rather fancy a strong notrump with the West hand...fair description of values, and good to play from the honour-x side|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: On a club lead, I'd rather be playing this one from west|pg||
nt|rv: winner of this match just 1 match away from finals, loser will get another chance to progress by playing in lower section of k/o|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: some would bid 3@C in East and then 3Nt by West - in my book 2NT is nor forcing, but 1@D - 2@D could be very weak|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't think that the east hand is strong enough to bid fake suits, particularly with every suit stopped anyway|pg||
nt|rv: both East and West underbid slightly in second round of bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  the lower bracket plays 3-way matches   upper bracket is head-to-head|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|woozle: good guess from Chang - the normal guess - Madala is more likely to lead from a king than a jack|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C is not fake = 5 card @S and ask for best game - when East has denied 4 card @C the 3@C bid is free|pg||
nt|woozle: now jack of spades, covered and won...and a diamond finesse - nine top tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: decl cant take @D from top if Q dont fall then no entry|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|woozle: and it's grossly antipercentage...and if you have a second spade trick, you only need five diamonds anyway|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|pelu: in CR East did bid 3@C, but 3@H from West and 3Nt also on "wrong" hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rv: he can't go wrong whatever he does now though he is surely going to finesse|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|woozle: wow...West in the other room was desperate to be dummy|pg||
nt|woozle: Duboin...maybe he doesn't play them so well|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: same play : @C to Q, @S to Q and @D to J|pg||
nt|woozle: phew...a diamond pitch looked spectacularly poorly chosen|pg||
mc|9|nt|rv: Agustin Madala used to play for Argentina juniors and national team before he emigrated to Italy|pg||
pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1S964HA8DT72CK8643,SJ3HK63DAKJ943CQT,SKT5HJT942DQ8CJ95,SAQ872HQ75D65CA72|sv|e|nt|Walddk4: In China, family names come first, that's why the operator thinks the 4 first names are family names|pg||
nt|kemperg: dobled in the OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 7+|pg||
nt|algraves:  3NT with 9 tricks minimum of course |pg||
nt|sybarra: that felt like it should have made :(|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Mildred@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: big difference between +590 and -300|pg||
nt|benjy: brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the event is to determine Australia Representatives or 2011 APBF [zone 6 championship] and accompanying Zone 7 playoff  then 2011 Bermuda Bowl/Venice Cup|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 4 card openings for Burgess-Courtney, strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Peter Gill was to opening the South hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S are Paul and Justin Hackett    EW  Adam and Nabil Edgtton (brothers)|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice hand here|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S will be the winner of the contest?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: Burgess-Courtney playing  "4 Card Standard"|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a precision style 2@c|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Finally slam time.|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS could scape home in 3NT here - but partscore more likely i think|pg||
nt|kareno: North left with a winner and a loser.  That @h 7 was the bee's knees :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: A\\Just a bit:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: just about make 7@d here|pg||
nt|kareno: Multi by west|pg||
nt|algraves:  dble shows spades|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Am told Hampson is in 3@s in OR|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: West:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS might try 3NT here - but it has cardiac problems|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: Looks like 6@d will fetch here but hard to get there after opening bid by west.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes this is a handtype whee precision pats off|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pays the piper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW were on the winning team in (last month's?) NEC Cup|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@s pass or correct I guess|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s is pass/correct - i.e. interested to play in game opposite a weak 2 in @h|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@H is making|pg||
nt|kemperg: not so easy:(|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes:) ha/ha|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4+@D|pg||
nt|pef: well that was a bit more imps than we expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Looks like a victory for the weak NT - @S partial on for EW|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Although 1NT no bed of roses|pg||
nt|kemperg: should end in 4@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: was not easy for E to find a dbl:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: White on red first seat making up for the lack of texture and EW really nothing to say.|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl modern style, 1@S = no @S's|pg||
nt|algraves:  presumably 1@S would deny 4+ spades|pg||
nt|mildredb: clever line :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Good one Dave|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mrdct: it was a mere overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart lead would put paid to 7|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt looks normal here.|pg||
nt|fluffy: Huang made soem safety play in trumps to protect from @cA being offside, that wasn't succesful|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: east west at the other table "sacrificed" in 4 hearts doubled for down 6 and -1400|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a really silly sac then|pg||
mb|3C|nt|baldfriede: I don't see a way to develop a 7th trick.|pg||
nt|kemperg: why duck|pg||
nt|mrdct: curtis needs slightly better @s pips for this to make|pg||
nt|mrdct: west's @HK in gold|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there;s no bee;s knees like slow bee's knees|pg||
nt|mrdct: need accurate defence to beat this|pg||
nt|algraves:  a good treatment for the system freaks out there in my opinion|pg||
nt|pef: it was sort of a forced sac.  east for some reason I don't understand doubled 3nt (west had made a rather|pg||
nt|pef: light negative double of a 1 diamond overcall)|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play|pg||
nt|pef: all roads would seem to lead to 3nt here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Griffiths-Richman 2/1|pg||
nt|mrdct: does it? - they might not find their @d fit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that was my point|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@c will still make though i think|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT denies 3@S's|pg||
nt|kemperg: Ah:(|pg||
nt|panja: EW playing Prec, I guess|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: standard signals for NS     EW upside-down count/attitude  odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Courtney - "I  always wondered what you'd have if you passed throught Bobby, and know we know"|pg||
nt|mrdct: north needs to show a spade splinter and that might get south going|pg||
nt|chilloncan: y|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Can't believe North won't show the strength. Now probably 4@h.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver in 4H|pg||
nt|mrdct: and this|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i prefer 2D on E hand in this situation|pg||
nt|kareno: Huh?  Weak?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: did Fred really duck that|pg||
nt|pef: which isn't cold by any means on a club lead even with a good guess in clubs.  declarer will need to decide whether to go after hearts or spades for a ninth trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: the tapping defence in @h looks best double dummy|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there are double dummy lines to find a way to go down, but i would need massive odds to bet against declarer|pg||
nt|chilloncan: weak? red against white fdacing a passed partner|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c had a better chance of making here|pg||
nt|kareno: But could north pass it?  |pg||
nt|algraves:  you put overcaller on lead, and save bidding space on some tricky to bid hands|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fast and furious auction|pg||
nt|fluffy: vulnerability scared EW from competing any further|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: this way 4@S North instead of South :)  with some extra info for declarer that won't affect the play|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm sure NS would be more than happy to reach 6@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: *is|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That's the limit here--|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that helps explain the choice of 2@D from last hand -- but in other room West Passed 2@D instead of the false preference with singleton @SQ|pg||
nt|panja: difficult for South now..|pg||
nt|benjy: 2nt scramble looks normal|pg||
nt|wygbe1: presumably n plans to correct clubs to diam, or bid diam over 2nt|pg||
nt|benjy: why would you correct 3@C? surely you would pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  4@s needs a @c shift at trick 2 to beat|pg||
nt|kareno: Won't a spade shift work as well?|pg||
nt|algraves:  3NT is a make here|pg||
nt|panja: it is far better for North to bid 1@H first time..than to try and reopen at two level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: duh   of course Dyke rebid 2@H|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d only?  I wonder if their responses to takeout doubles are peculiar.|pg||
nt|algraves:  presumably 3@C did not promise great hand, as 2@Sfor that|pg||
nt|mrdct: so they've successfully diagnosed the lack of a @h stopper and stopped in 3@d|pg||
nt|mildredb: they must have heard you VW|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: E surely worth another bid?|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, maybe not :)|pg||
nt|algraves:  but the light overcall style hurts them here as east was afraid to bid past 3@C. picture the overcall on board 2|pg||
nt|algraves:  no free lunch|pg||
nt|frankaus: E has a good hand after pd opens - i would think is worth some form of game try |pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C ment also a good overcall|pg||
nt|algraves:  well partner did not open, they overcalled and on board 2 they overcalled with 6 HCP|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT makes from E but not W, and after the encouragement from W with 3@C it is reasonable I suppose for E to take a shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: then he would pass 2@C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: south won't feel all that comfortable yet with a @d ruff looming|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will go down a lot now.|pg||
nt|mrdct: with south a passed hand it looks like a offer to play but north is not to know south has 6 of them|pg||
nt|pef: a lot will depend on whether sementa can figure out whether mark lair has four or five clubs|pg||
nt|fluffy: Sementa bids 3@c to see if prtner supports with 3@s to decide between 3NT and 4@s|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugrapha4: now*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: an anomaly :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: well on the way to 6@D now|pg||
nt|mrdct: a GF must have been established before 3@d also i think|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugrapha4: Better :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: kind of unlucky|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: foul break of course|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, if diamonds are 41 the ocntract is at risk, so declarer will just bang trumps down|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not a lot of options for S|pg||
nt|bg: having started this way S should keep on drawing trump|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i think 5C is passable since S passed as dealer and N only raised to 2H|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Maybe 1S is a xfer to 1NT|pg||
nt|wygbe1: thats why you would correct, but east got greedy|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW upside-down count & attitude    1st discard odd/even|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The only grand slam that makes is 7@C|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Try to bid that|pg||
nt|mrdct: -1 here will win 6 imps from USA|pg||
nt|pef: interesting choice of lines now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not many entries to the @D's but not many @C stops either|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if plays @S now can afford to hook @D|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ianmcc: hi|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Ian|pg||
nt|kemperg: gm Ian|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: draws trump now and plays a @D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|benjy: I wonder what 2NT would have meant, it is fairly mainstream to play it as 2 places in this position|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: thanks Adam|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not sure what it all meant but nicely bid by the italians|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, I somehow thought west had opened - silly me :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we landed |pg||
nt|kareno: Well done. 7 depends on a finesse - sort of silly to bid that much.|pg||
nt|fluffy: also having stiff @hK wich is half a trick playing in hearts, but no trick playing in spades, is a negative factor towards bidding one more|pg||
nt|benjy: If you are playing 2Nt as scramble then 3@C is often a 5 card suit, you don't want to correct when partner is 4225 shape (quite likely on this auction)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kareno: I would say he will make 7 now.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, hard to find.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|mrdct: he has @d blocked if they are 4-1|pg||
nt|frankaus: @C's likely to yield 6 tricks after the @C support|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT 2@S end in OR|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: we got to see Adam as last minute substitute player yesterday in a pickup partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: brutal event for that scenario|pg||
nt|mrdct: good lead|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|chilloncan: my point exactly|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence would need to be asleep to let NS make 5@c wiht the @dAKQ on lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|baldfriede: @s switch now for 3 down.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on a lowm @H now, E is endplayued|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR NS in 4@S, EW were quiet|pg||
nt|ianmcc: who shut me out?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: home james|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bg: not blocked any more:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: and west has evidently been to the "Lead Partner's Suit" school of bridge and finds the killing @d lead vs 5@hx|pg||
nt|algraves:  well sure but my point is that you cant have your cake and eat it also, There is a downside to the aggressive overcall style in that constructive bidding when it is your hand is more difficult|pg||
nt|frankaus: there would be some agreement about pass after X and a bid later  - could have influenced the auction|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mrdct: ruffing @s wont do the job so he'll go for setting up @c now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ?|pg||
nt|fluffy: Weichsel  is setting a dummy reversal, even when he has more trumps, he prefers to set clubs and make dummy high forgetting about diamonds|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think it's something like no 4@s and either 8-10bal or 11+ w/o a clear bid|pg||
nt|benjy: I am afraid i don't agree about overcalling 1@H, i think their bidding was normal|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mrdct: live scores for this round: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=7&tourid=902|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This could be a very fast set|pg||
nt|pef: similar line in the same contract in the open room, except declarer led the j of spades at trick 2 which was covered|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ianmcc: got the go away message|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kemperg: who let you in:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: funny|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that was a long thought for no reward|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: oops|pg||
nt|panja: of course there bidding was 'normal'...|pg||
nt|panja: but doubling 2@S is a huge risk|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: ok   unblock recovers the position|pg||
nt|kemperg: escape for E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW never got in the auction at other table  after offshape Weak 1N - 2@S North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East's only option was 2@D to show @C    2@C in this sequence is @H raise|pg||
pc|dK|nt|frankaus: Mandala will be pleased to see @C 3-3|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dyke is in 3@S West|pg||
nt|mrdct: he can cope with 4-2 @c as he's got 3 entries to dummy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrdct: EW go to bed with a @h trick|pg||
nt|panja: it worked here because S had no wasted values in Spades..|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mrdct: i wonder if he'll draw trumps at some point|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrdct: this event has 10 rounds of swiss over two days and then moves into a complex double-knockout stage|pg||
nt|kareno: Careful defense needed right here|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|benjy: I would X 2@S everytime|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mrdct: west needs to not bare his @HK|pg||
mc|9|pg||

mb|4H|nt|rv: double fit for both sides here|pg||
nt|woozle: featherweight 6S won't make here without help in diamonds from the opponents...EW can make 5H in comfort, NS 5S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|woozle: If he's on lead, Huang needs to keep his mitts off the diamond ace|pg||
mb|5H|nt|rv: bidding will surely go on till 5@s, possibly Patrick may even bid 6@h|pg||
nt|woozle: He wouldn't want to push them to 5S|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: I think that declarer will get the clubs right in 5S - say, a heart lead...ruff, draw trumps, king of clubs, club to jack, claim whether it wins or loses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 21 total trump    21 total tricks [i think]   last set we saw 2 hands with 20/20   i thought LTT was supposed to break down with this many trump|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: ahh   actually 22 total tricks here|pg||
nt|woozle: 22 total trumps also|pg||
nt|woozle: Huang plays chicken with the opponents...will he judge to defend 6S?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well  01:40 here     that's my excuse and i'm sticking to it|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Al, thanks and good nite|pg||
nt|woozle: Is this some peculiar double arrangement like Meckwell, saying he'd like to bid?|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm told that it is. That makes more sense than a penalty double with that hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: Patrick's decision clearly right at IMPs, he has to take insurance even if 5@s might go down|pg||
nt|woozle: If Huang leads the diamond ace against 6S, Madala will eventually have to guess the clubs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: well judged and bid by all around|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: Lair sitting South in other room started with DBL   Sementa in 6@H but bidding isn't over|pg||
nt|woozle: Interestingly, and oddly, the diamond ace lead is necessary against 5S to give declarer a chance to go down (else the club hook-endplay) but against six it's the only lead to give ...|pg||
nt|woozle: him a chance|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|woozle: 6H doubled will probably be down one - cheap insurange|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|woozle: alas, if it's -200, -200, that's 9 imps - maybe insurance isn't so cheap nowadays|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but i agree that 2N should be used as scramble|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: think he claimed 1 up when @SK onside|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Part score time.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=10&tourid=902|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: interesting hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 6@s is on here|pg||
nt|peachy: This will be EW hand, I presume not even interference from NS|pg||
nt|benjy: In fact i think X of 2@S is so normal that i would consider it more of a risk to pass out 2@S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: too much time Stephen -- now they probably won't let you bid 4@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: everything about this tournament is completely first class both for the players and the spectators - Mr Yeh puts on a great event|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh now that is truly motheaten for second seat red.|pg||
nt|algraves:  I assume the NS play transfer responses to 1@C |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@H: not recommended|pg||
nt|pef: this one shoujld be interesting.  north south have a bid double fit, east west have 12 hearts beween them|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: @H=@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I see Australia made 4@H on board 2|pg||
nt|fluffy: if someone is wondering, the paly on trick one in clubs is nearly automatic. with Q10 a priori its the same percentage to play the @c10 looking for the opening leader to have @cJ ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: or @cQ looking for opening leader to have @cK. However if you have 2 suits to lead, and one is headed by Jack and the other from the King, experts will always pick the one from the ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: King, this makes playing the queen the percentage action|pg||
nt|pef: the 4 heart opening was a transfer to four spades for north south :)|pg||
nt|pef: both sides can make exactly 5 of a major|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kiwibridge: Neills 3@S shuts them all out esp pard|pg||
nt|henryb:  The web site has no posted results|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its the standard though these days Jordan|pg||
nt|fluffy: how amny teams qualify?|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c lead will beat it|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C likely a form of Drury|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S W anyone|pg||
nt|fluffy: Dubion won't let 4@s play, he is deciding now how far will he competer|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well he could count 9 tricks for declarer on normal play so was desperately searching for something that could steer declarer off normal play.  |pg||
mb|5H!|nt|mrdct: more 5-level action|pg||
nt|frankaus: dealer has provided interesting hands so fay|pg||
nt|mrdct: standby|pg||
nt|kareno: And that is not to mention the very sweet winners' pot of $100,000|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl negative, pass better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: x should be blood after a multi|pg||
mb|6H|nt|vugrapha4: Lot of bidding from both Courtney and Burgo on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: four -  not SIX|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Not liking the chance of this contract all too much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north's choice:   DBL vs 1@H vs [i guess] PASS   you choose|pg||
nt|kareno: All the action we could possible want :)|pg||
nt|bg: China lost 7 on strange  1nt board one where 1nt was passed out|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, @C start and good decision in @D|pg||
nt|kareno: Ok|pg||
nt|mrdct: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=6&tourid=902|pg||
nt|kareno: Here's a site http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=902   then click link for round|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, and he puts up the BBO commentators at 5 star hotels also|pg||
nt|mrdct: that's part of the "first class" bit for the players|pg||
nt|jcwla: No matter this time, on the way to 4@S EW.|pg||
nt|algraves:  3NT NS|pg||
nt|wygbe1: pretty close, but i think i would pass - if south decides to sit your defense will be disappointing|pg||
nt|pef: they are playing in 6 hearts doubled in the open room|pg||
nt|fluffy: 5@d is a "fit bid", obviously Duboin doesn't want to paly in diamonds when he couldn't open the bidding, he uses the bid to show lenght in both diamonds and hearts. Offering a good ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: lead to partner if he is on lead later, and suggesting a higher sacrifice if they have dobule fit|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch both vugraph rooms at the same time - one window per table|pg||
nt|fluffy: IMO Lair should double now, he is minimum for a 4 level double, has a @dK not looking good. His alternative is "pass" wich is foricng and encouraging|pg||
nt|pef: I think mark is going to double here, but he does have a problem|pg||
nt|pef: he might decide to bid 6 spades as a two way shot|pg||
nt|pef: or even pass if that is clearly forcing|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told that link is obsolete.  Current links are:   http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|fluffy: pass is also reasonable, as an invite, but 6@s is not reasonable, that would be a mistake|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: no results for rd 6 as yet but i imagine they wont be far away|pg||
nt|mrdct: just the operators Marshall - the ones doing the real work|pg||
nt|chilloncan: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: undo please|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: plus the ruffs|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT on here|pg||
nt|mrdct: with this fortunitous @c layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP passed   it is NS doing the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East is just a tad shy of Strong 1@C opening|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S = @D i suppose|pg||
nt|mrdct: and a @c lead look pretty likely from south|pg||
nt|peachy: by elimination, leading their second suit no good (nor because it is doubleton), Jxx not appetizing and trump even less so|pg||
nt|mrdct: so 3@d non-minimum with a @d side suit i guess and now 4@d is a simple cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: and standings: Israel 99, Japan 97 USA 95 Australia 93|pg||
nt|pef: not clear to me that pass is forcing. yes weischel bid 5h, but he's a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: isnt it more than one down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes indeed|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: pretty conservative non-X by East|pg||
nt|mwigor: it is worth noting that 5@c makes EW - so in theory this is a good result for NS|pg||
nt|mwigor: i doubt many will find 5@c though|pg||
nt|kemperg: has chances |pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will not be easy.|pg||
nt|kemperg: first the start:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Passive defence may beat this - a @D lead gives declarer his 9th trick|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D J can also be the 9th|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h lead look normal to me.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I suppose 1@s means @h here.|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure |pg||
nt|kareno: I guess as of last night|pg||
nt|mrdct: yesterday they were updated about once every 10 minutes with live progressive scores from all matches|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S was -3 on 3 for 6 imps practically all square now|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice, a close match|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no trump finesse here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile Kaplan-Rubens evaluates the W hand at under 8: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=QJ6+Q76+QJ73+K92 |pg||
nt|kemperg: transfer Walsh i think|pg||
nt|algraves:  and that 1@C is balanced or clubs, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Allan   1@C=3+  and transfer responses   not sure if 1@S promises @D|pg||
nt|kemperg: not sure either, in my system it does|pg||
nt|algraves:  well, no major presumably and if balanced not very strong so usually unbalanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well by unpassed hand  1@C-1N is game force 5+@D  and 1@S just denies 4+@H/@S   not sure by passed hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, to cater for injudicious overcalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zhuang could RDBL to force Dai to complete the Texas Transfer|pg||
nt|benjy: Split panel then|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd Lair|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: no choice is perfect, no choice is awful|pg||
nt|mrdct: this looks 2 off|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW have ti be carefull in @S|pg||
nt|kareno: Finesser's paradise :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: a nice direct auction by NS|pg||
nt|chilloncan: meanwhile, even playing 5 cxard majors i would have a tough time pulling out any bid but 1H|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence can only ever get 6 tricks here and with @SJ now set up they'll need a @d switch now to avoid -120|pg||
nt|pef: so we got to the par spot at both tables and will have a push|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: however   with 5@S 3@H  DBL isn't a good choice since weak advancer [partner of doubler] will bid 1@H with 3@H & 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't have Q1 result for  Hans-Brown   maybe Adam knows [his brother is member of Hans team]|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fluffy: some people play that double means: pass if this is your suit, bid your suit otherwise|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like a puppet to 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: wd by N....far from obvious to bid over 1N, as S did not say double so suboar chance of 44 hearts, and long suit is weak. but this was the time for aggression|pg||
nt|chilloncan: oh wait, sorry i thought they were going to 3N after 2C|pg||
nt|kareno: Most unlikely, though |pg||
nt|mrdct: now RKCB and 5@h asking for the @sQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: opponents have preempt opposite passed hand, they are at the 6 level, if they make this, it will be doubled|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: i'm told  Brown +2     [or Hans -2]|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Brown up 2 imps|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c may well be a puppet to 2@d to establish this sign-off in 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if N was not planning to invite 3N, which as i said was pushy, i dont really warm up to aiming at a final contract of 3C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: needs to avoid the ruff|pg||
pc|s2|nt|frankaus: nicely done to protect N's @s stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course my copy of the NS CC is from Beijing 2008|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kareno: Not enough compensation for their vulnerable game.  Of course 4@h can be beaten but will it?|pg||
nt|fluffy: I am not a multi expert, but I ahve seen this treatment at the table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I play X = I know what your suit is please pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that @D play never works for me|pg||
nt|wygbe1: the double of 4h allowed west to let east declare, where west has no lead advantage in hearts|pg||
nt|benjy: Just going back to the X of 4@H, does it merely ask partner to lead a @H or does it suggest that partner might support at the 5 level, if the latter then I would be concerned that ...|pg||
nt|benjy: with such a balanced hand it was risky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: single dummy -- it's hard to figure out what's best now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|chilloncan: why not just pass 1N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd singleton King in 4 boards  |pg||
nt|frankaus: declarer will be holding his breath as he takes @h finess|pg||
nt|algraves:  ok regardless they have arrived at the best contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: most peaple do it that way|pg||
nt|kemperg: to late negative i mean|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct: but EW could easily be going down in 5@s or 5@h in the other room so might be good for the chinese/dutch combination|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mwigor: of course -800 would not have been a good score for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at KQ10 south llikely to switch to @DK anyway which blocks @d|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: lots of red suit discards coming|pg||
nt|mildredb: drum roll|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Now will Curtis lead a club? or a heart here?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Tight Mildred:)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Right*|pg||
nt|mrdct: lots of imps riding on this lead|pg||
nt|mildredb: it is taking longer to lead than it will take to play the whole hand|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's after 16 of 48 boards|pg||
nt|mrdct: chnace for an imp for USA|pg||
nt|kareno: 11 toppers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver in 3N North after East opened 2-suited 2@S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|baldfriede: Gettin up with K@d gave a trick.|pg||
nt|mrdct: particularly against game in the open room - so 26 imp swings on the lead|pg||
nt|pef: four hearts vul. in third seat has a huge range.  He could easly have the best hand at the table.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugrapha4: 64 is it not?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy -- i changed my mind about   with 48 to play versus  16 of 64 :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would be very confident that no table in the field will play this board at the 4-level|pg||
nt|kareno: So a quiet down two.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zhuang fears @C ruff -- and worried about 3rd round of @H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|baldfriede: E/W  have to stick to their @s.|pg||
nt|mrdct: and 3 working finesses = 14 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: whaty did Fred make of the start, @H looked normal|pg||
nt|mrdct: prob @sA and another now|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Curtis knows that Joanna has clubA|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: you wanna jump in?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrdct: he wont be happy seeing the @cQ coming down|pg||
nt|mrdct: now north needs to cling to all his @cs|pg||
nt|algraves:  west really trusted his partners double as he can see nine tricks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kiwibridge: unusual not to take the safety play the ruff was staring in the face|pg||
nt|algraves:  and had to assume that they could not now take 4@D tricks|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Spade finesse?|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks like it|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think @s finesse is wrong play|pg||
nt|mildredb: i agree|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deLivera also opened 4@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like 10 tricks - but missed a possible vul game in 3NT|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|kiwibridge: 39 imps in 4 boards it's not good bridge|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mwigor: they've missed the second ruff so now only 2 down|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@C in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink playing 4@H South|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not necessarily, defence can still get 5|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: spade 8?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that seemed like it would never work|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real surprise there|pg||
nt|mwigor: perhaps gosney should have led back the jack?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Which should yield 2@S and 1@D to defence for 1 down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h discard would have given it.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not any more needed to play @C|pg||
nt|kareno: There should be some sort of squeeze on this hand.  Or an ending.  Very complex.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting trump position, W has to coup S by leading red winners from dummy to prevent the @S6 winning a trick|pg||
nt|bg: sry too early|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Bruce|pg||
nt|fluffy: yeah in the end he has to play small trump to the 8 from his hand if Mark Lair refuses to ruff anything|pg||
nt|mrdct: it is clear the south has the longer @c so you dont care if north wins @sK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other room using  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|henryb:  If I were Joe I would play @hK ans a @h to the J before cashing the last @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: 8 tricks it is|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer still fears AQ@c offside.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bg: discard club ruff a heart dia to ace ruff another heart then low to the eight endplay|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit unlucky done you think?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Another big swing|pg||
nt|mrdct: didn't cost here though but would have big time if south had @sKxx|pg||
nt|mildredb: Curtis was a 1 man show on that hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|baldfriede: Here is the reason why @h discard would have given a trick.|pg||
nt|kareno: Nicely done with an endplay.|pg||
pc|dA|mc|11|nt|ahollan1: good cover with @HQ   but now we'll never know whether or not Matt was going to float the 10|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=18-19 HCP, BAL|pg||
nt|woozle: If chang had led clubs earlier, he might have been able to start diamonds with both black suits eliminated, guaranteeing down only one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|woozle: I remain unconvinced by these methods, but some good players seem to play them|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: 4S will probably make, but a heart lead forces declarer to guess spades|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: their teammates use 2@D opening for this hand|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|pelu: also 6@hX in CR|pg||
nt|rv: yes odds on to make 4@S here, 3-1 trump break might have given more problem on this deal|pg||
nt|woozle: It certainly saves the opponents the trouble of preempting|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the 2@C opener has slight advantage in that you can sometimes play 2@H/@S from correct side  [actually some who open 2@D can't play 2M at all]|pg||
nt|rv: since trumps are 4-0, declarer likely to play low @s to queen to cater to 4 trumps in east hand since he can't cater to 4-0 other way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: downside is strong hands start at 2@D instead of 2@C  --  who knows what the tradeoff is|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|woozle: I think I'll stick to my trick of opening these hands 1D|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: I am not a big fan of this method, I can see a lot of merit in starting with 1@c like Polish club for 18-19 bal instead of 2@C|pg||
nt|pelu: defense has to start with 2x@H|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||

nt|kareno: Accident in the OR that hand.|pg||
nt|kemperg: but a very good start from ops|pg||
nt|algraves:  and saved an imp or two|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great result Japan then|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
nt|benjy: Yes it looks like declarer played for 1 down|pg||
nt|wygbe1: nothing would work, so he just played for down one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all good 3/4 flat and 1 swing|pg||
nt|pef: another hand with swing potential.  will north south get to 4 spades and will they make it?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kiwibridge: the good sac withered on the vine as it were|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was *dont you think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but why make it easy for the defense?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's wrong with trying @H at trick 3?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 3 imps lost vs possible huge gain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another eash hand for Burgess to bid :(|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no they threw 14 on board 1 :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: lead I ment|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wants N for weak 2 in @H w/ @SK and @CA |pg||
nt|kemperg: will W believe that:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That 2@H will surprise partner|pg||
nt|bg: looks like some one fed the computer a new deck and then dealt a goulash|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ianmcc: no moths|pg||
nt|fluffy: 5@h from furuta would give weichsel some pressure|pg||
nt|pef: north's hand is considerably too good for a strong nt opening|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mwigor: 4@d isnt great news - but avi does have a good hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: 6@h is an ok contract - and makes on this layout|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h EW the spot here|pg||
nt|kareno: This hand should get to a quiet 4@h but it is possible to overstretch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=limited  4+@H maybe longer 2nd suit  included 5@H & 5@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 4@S splinter|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2 unsupported Queens I'd do it|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: 1@S transfer|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4 of either major for EW here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this looks like a mickey mouse 2@D I suppose its @S +@C weak |pg||
nt|pef: double here shows 3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=0-2@S  forcing unless 5@H(332)|pg||
nt|mrdct: most likely @s of course|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think there was intent in the open room just not the desired outcome|pg||
nt|kareno: Dai with a very active double at favorable|pg||
nt|pef: a support double (invented by Eric Rodwell)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kareno: Stretchy Drury by east.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c looks like drury|pg||
nt|kareno: Fourth trump does it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: I'm about to resatr the room.. this looks pretty easy. back in 2 minutes|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: *restart|pg||
nt|mrdct: north can get a @c ruff but there is no entry back to south for another one|pg||
nt|frankaus: 12 probable in @S|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 14-16 here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure if he was going to that, bid NT or conventionally show @C support|pg||
nt|kemperg: then where did W find 3@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: precision 3 suiter short @D I amd told (yuk)|pg||
nt|kemperg: that explains|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I saw it in an earlier match. That must be the lot until 2015|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's truly horrible in my book, 2@C I could almost tolerate|pg||
nt|jcwla: Texture doesn't seem to matter until you have to play in one of those suits you bragged about.|pg||
nt|kemperg: that happened in OR, and S is in 2@S|pg||
nt|benjy: not easy for west to switch to a @D here|pg||
nt|benjy: if he ducks then declarer can prevail thanks to the favourable @H position|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT will be in trouble on a @s lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 5+@S|pg||
nt|algraves:  2@D presumably artificial game force|pg||
nt|benjy: I would be amazed if this didn't make|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  This play was 100%, but unless Kazuo had not led a @h from Q10xxx a heart play was also 100% and offered chances for the overtrick|pg||
nt|mrdct: plenty of trick on offer here if he gets @d right and contract still safe if he doesn't|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c ruff might beat this|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Club A lead not obv:-)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Can still beat this w/o ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Courtney is well known for his prowess at Rubber Bridge|pg||
nt|mrdct: it wont be too hard for south to unblock|pg||
nt|mrdct: draw trumps and try to steal a @c trick|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the known diamond positioin gives him an extra entry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are 9 tricks but can het get them|pg||
nt|kemperg: par 6@H|pg||
nt|benjy: But we'll see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: halftime scores under http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=902    then click link for  appropriate KO round|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes a very handy bid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: after 3@C -- will Klinger push to 3@H?|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR S played a second low @D for the K|pg||
pc|cT|nt|frankaus: now to make it wont be easy|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: How shld Joe play clubs?|pg||
nt|peachy: he might have trouble all by himself|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: specs might factor that into some of the auctions we'll see|pg||
nt|kareno: The takeout double may pinpoint the diamond suit for declarer.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mrdct: and the optimal contract is reached|pg||
nt|kareno: I guess 100 percent pure is better :)|pg||
nt|benjy: Declarer followed with the @SJ was that correct?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: west found the right suit, but gave his pd a problem by not starting with the ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  4  Chung-Liu are playing 3@C|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kiwibridge: E has to discard 3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he can't really go wrong in trumps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: nowhere to dump all of the @d losers|pg||
nt|mrdct: yep|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrdct: the defence will need to switch to a @d at some point but will get several chances|pg||
nt|algraves:  it looks like he is going to have to pick up both spades and diamonds to make it|pg||
nt|wygbe1: pd got it right though|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kemperg: wd, W had to play the 10|pg||
nt|ianmcc: S should overtake @dK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Fred kindly located the high cards for him|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think @cJ is the only line|pg||
nt|ianmcc: specs say @s OK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its either +10 or -5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: cute  DBL followed by correct to 3@H  brings @S into the picture|pg||
nt|mrdct: tournament website: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx|pg||
nt|chilloncan: double looks so obvious...and yet...at favorable colors, E couldnt act over 1C....|pg||
nt|mrdct: odds favour the hook here considerably|pg||
nt|kareno: And so it proves.|pg||
nt|benjy: marking declarer with KQJ or KJ, surely a low card was correct, allowing the leader to have Q1098x?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|algraves:  he cannot ruff a diamond of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: S has more tricks than he knew about|pg||
nt|mrdct: still going to struggle for tricks here as playing on @c himself will yield 3 losers in that suit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: Coffee hand|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Soi they play canapes?|pg||
nt|kareno: Doesn't look obvious to me with those shabby suits.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well then we agree|pg||
nt|mrdct: @s continuation by east now might see west squeezed a tad on the run of the @d|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer with plenty of ammunition, including a spade entry to dummy.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good play|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kemperg: he's not sure of E distribution, 4441 poss.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s2|nt|algraves:  mis counted, doesnt need the diamonds|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@S 3@D 2@H 2@C and a rufff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this a Restricted Choice situation or is 10 meaningless looking at that dummy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now the trump situation is debatable, is the @S Ten singleton or from QT,|pg||
nt|pef: not when he is drawing them by playing high diamonds :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: NS prefer their auctions to last one bid, or two if they are feeling scientific|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bg: new style lead middle of three:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kareno: An IMP back to Italy|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Will make 12 tricks now.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: So*|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|mrdct: might be an imp for Lavazza here now to get them on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|kemperg: its an interesting hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 back halves the deficit|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice bid by E, 7; 61/2 loser hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd good play now home singing ragtime|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chilloncan: N might have to decide whether S has Q of diamonds or T of hearts|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think west needs defence to play on @h for him to set up the QJ in dummy - which be a pretty poor defence not likely at this level|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i dont think that is clear|pg||
nt|kemperg: lookes restricted to me|pg||
nt|pef: I think he needs to pitch a club now to hold declarer to 4 spades|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: three bids make them uneasy|pg||
nt|sybarra: off the schneid |pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrdct: souith needs to unblock a @d honour|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if S had Jx of D then D switch would be disastrous|pg||
nt|kemperg: but a perfect @S fit:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: now joe can duck a @c on the way back and limit himslef to 2 @c losers|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|s4|nt|kemperg: screw is tightening|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, Stansby "flashed"|pg||
nt|peachy: a bit of luck for Joe|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: quite a change for Burgess from his Forcing Pass/Moscito Relay days|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 4+@S   approximately 13 cards|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 2@C is only a 1-round force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scrambling stayman or transfer?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: a trump lead will beat 6@h here i think|pg||
nt|kareno: Transfer by north.|pg||

nt|kareno: Meckwell, I'm told.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds and a major.|pg||

nt|jcwla: This gives new meaning to having three cards in each side suit when opening light in a minor.|pg||

nt|peachy: NS play a form of Precision, so 1D not promising D necessarily|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a partscore battle here|pg||
nt|pef: north south here may push to a no-points four hearts, which can't be beaten even if east west find their diamond ruff given the very lucky heart lie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only 14 Pearson points (should have 15) but a 2 suiter|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kemperg: ??|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 1 spec ty[ed to me that the sponsor invited good players, not nec. kind ones:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in fact i don't think it promises a rebid over 2@S -- but don't quote me on that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is example -- 1@D can't be canape into @H|pg||
nt|mrdct: burns law violation|pg||
nt|kareno: West taking the low road.  Will north compete in spades?|pg||

nt|pef: and the working club finesse (if needed to pitch a spade|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Mullamphy would be able to transfer to @H  -- guess not|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: XX probably a run from Peter, so he chooses to pass|pg||

nt|sybarra: stars from all over the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 2@H  TO PLAY      how retro|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gill's problem tough here   transfer responses not requiring any points, but not forbidding them either :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL and 2N seem the front runners   hard to imagine PASS, but that would work out fine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Richman in 2N North|pg||
nt|kareno: I doubt they'll get that high|pg||
nt|mrdct: need to get @d right here to make|pg||
nt|mrdct: and sometime one might play north for a @d shortage with the long @c suit so not a guarantee to make this|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No easy lead for South.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C was best:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: how does 3NT go for EW?|pg||
nt|algraves:  that is a good point , often overlooked|pg||
nt|kemperg: he is Dutch top, doesn't overlook much|pg||
nt|mcarroll: in NT of course not this contract|pg||
nt|benjy: i would X on the north cards|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: Griffiths in South overcalled 1@C with 1@D  -- how did they stop in 2N???|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h the normal contract|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, indeed.  For those who don't know it, Burns' Law says you should not play a suit where the opponents have more cards than you do.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when --- and why?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably 1N=13-15|pg||
nt|benjy: in the pass out seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: With no convinient cue available Courtney bids a simple 4@S|pg||

nt|wygbe1: they should go plus here, with 1c 1s 2d and 2h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if forced to balance, i think i'd try 2@S   but i'd complain about being forced|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: commentators in the other room are discussing Shakespeare  -  that won't happen here|pg||
nt|athene: actually Courtney is quite a drama fan, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: impossible to find the double dummy defense of  @H, @D ruff @C to King, @C ruff|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer has a problem:|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but may have 4 losers anyway|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, he can't reach dummy to get get the @d right.|pg||
nt|henryb:  violating "Burn's Law": It is a bad idea to play in a contract there the opponents have more trumps than you do :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and Vul vs Green even worse|pg||
nt|peachy: oops, sry Shirley|pg||
nt|pef: bocchi (north) in the open room did not make a game try after a single heart raise, so this board should|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: agression pays a dividend|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: np,  at least the specs have the site :)|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: I am told that on Brd 5, they are in 4@s as well in OR & looks like they are going down|pg||
nt|fluffy: but probably a 2@h raise for Bocchi-Madala has a different meaning for Weichsel-Lair|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N may have been contemplating a @C slam, but E doubling @S would probably stop that line of thought|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think south will find a @s lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Poorly by west with a spade lead.|pg||
nt|kemperg: lot of 9 pts opened nowadays|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
nt|frankaus: -2 now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: the OR are now on board 9 we are a bit behind|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugrapha4: Simple squeeze on Bobby in the endgame|pg||
nt|kareno: Henry you simply have to type faster :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: there was a burns law hand about this time yesterday where 4@h made 11 tricks in the 5-1 fit after a misunderstanding about splintering in partner's suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: Neat - at least one hand had a lot of trumps!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: badly with competent defense i think|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrdct: @d continuation will disturb NS commincations|pg||
nt|kareno: East would never bid notrumps on that hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  5   Brink in 6@S South|pg||
nt|mrdct: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: She will eventually finesse spade thru opening bidder|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|baldfriede: South will switch to na @d now.|pg||
nt|mrdct: everything about this event is first class for both the players and the spectators|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|baldfriede: a*|pg||
nt|mrdct: there is quite an advantage to finish in the top 7 from the swiss to get a double-chance in the KO stage|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct.  The bottom finishers get to play a single KO and the top ones play a double KO|pg||
nt|mrdct: but the top 15 plus Mr Yeh's team all qualify for the KO stage|pg||
nt|kareno: And I assume Mr. Yeh's team qualifies into the top group?|pg||
nt|mrdct: correct|pg||
nt|kareno: Only reasonable since he is sponsoring this great event!|pg||
nt|peachy: The prizes are spectacular as well, the winning team gets $100,000|pg||
nt|mrdct: and a lot of the teams get significant appearance money also|pg||
pc|dA|nt|baldfriede: Well done.|pg||
nt|kemperg: must have good brakes in their system|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Joe will probably duck heart Q|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: @S10 odd/even says   don't like @S  prefer @H over @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: can she duck?  (doubt it) |pg||
nt|sybarra: wow JoAnn!|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Now she is cold (assuming spade finesse)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Curtis' hand is dead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: @D guess wont help him here|pg||
nt|mrdct: needed to read the @c position first!|pg||
nt|algraves:  good defense by NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CA lead from Barel --  not sure if similar inference about @S position    might think lead Ace implies trump trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is a 32 board match played in two segments of 16|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh sorry ,  she is playing 3 nt  (my bad) |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|mrdct: now south retains the @DK as his entry to the long @c|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mrdct: @CAK, ruff @c high and draw last trump|pg||
nt|kareno: Or ace of diamonds ... etc.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all those for drawing trumps say aye |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|baldfriede: That's it.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: but will he read it?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south misread the spade ten i guess|pg||
pc|hT|nt|wygbe1: cant see why though, only the jack was missing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this match is from the "bottom 8"   i.e. loser is out of the event   the winner will play in a 3-way later today  with another winner from lower 8 and a loser from top 8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: nah -- that can't be right|pg||
nt|mrdct: this diagram shows how the KO stage works: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/results/results.aspx|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I'd back him|pg||
nt|athene: he's not going to take a club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: that would risk going down|pg||
nt|peachy: basically, the top 8 play double elimination, the bottom 8 teams single elimination|pg||
nt|sybarra: Raija, that is easier way to say it |pg||
nt|peachy: I looked at the diagram and couldn't decipher it, sorry to admit my ignorance... but there it is...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer avoided endplay for 4 down.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: so he can't fail to make 11|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: but Klinger just playing partner to follow suit when appropriate|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: Ahh.. http://www.ccba.org.cn/Super/Tour/Bulletin/2011/902/Bul110418.PDF takes you to bulletin by the way.|pg||

nt|sybarra: start of the comeback?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this could go 2 @D-3 @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: OR in 6@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be hotly contested|pg||
nt|kareno: n/s may compete in hearts but how high the moon?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Just another boring push :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps west opened after all|pg||
nt|mrdct: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is not the first 8 semi-solid 8 card suit of the week|pg||
nt|fluffy: I would open south's hand by 1@s, but I know my style is not very standard :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kemperg: all cards well placed for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@c is on for EW|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W passed?|pg||
nt|mrdct: or a conventional response to a strong @c opening|pg||
nt|algraves:  2NT or 3@C by NS|pg||
nt|wygbe1: down one in 5d v 4h making|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 5@c excellent e/w ... n/s can compete but it gets expensive.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: (were they Majors)|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps west's plan was to back in with an appropriate number of NTs at his next turn after the opps expectedly bid a major or two|pg||
nt|sybarra: you might be right Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: which doesn't seem such a bad plan|pg||
nt|mildredb: i'd bet he is|pg||
nt|mrdct: except if the opps don't bid before it comes back to him|pg||
nt|mrdct: and then it becomes hard to convey to partner how good he is for a passed hand|pg||
nt|mildredb: depends on what their PH bidding agreements are - but can at least spl|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: a good question asked by a kib: should inverted minors still be on by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: depends on agreements|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Depends on yr agreements|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :-)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, Mildred already said that--scroll up:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think they probably should be|pg||
nt|benjy: Sorry guys I have been asked to switch to the OR, enjoy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: this match isn't going well for one of the tournament favourites|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, 4@s appears to work well here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C  Bergen   [by passed hand??]|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Which actually works.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The horrible trump split kills it.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: is this the right auction?|pg||
nt|kareno: Operator, this cannot be right.|pg||
nt|mrdct: if EW are to reach game they will have to take a bid at some point|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@s by north maybe a psyche|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and here's another, bout time mind you|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Does everyone pass w/West hand here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no|pg||
nt|mrdct: surprised that neither west nor north found an opening bid here|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid I am enticed into bidding 5/5's|pg||
nt|mildredb: i would pass|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting. If the suits were majors, I'd open|pg||
nt|mildredb: if pard can't open, I haVE  no desire to open the auction for them to out bid me in Majors|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: well then I wld not have posed that question:)))))))))))))|pg||
nt|pef: not a very good result for north south here as four spades appears to be cold (at the other table, I mean)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'd open it 2@Ss, but that's not standard either.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S or 3@S from Gill?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Oddly enough I think 6@S makes|pg||
nt|kemperg: works I think|pg||
nt|mrdct: the way thing sit - NS can only make 9 tricks in either major i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: or reality as we are seeing now|pg||
nt|chilloncan: while we wait for restoration, i recommend listening to Leo Kottke;s "It's So Cold in China, the birds don;t sing"|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here it would be 2@S 5 + a 5 minor 6-10|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kareno: Not unexpected they would make if they bid it.  Italy in trouble in this match.|pg||
nt|kareno: East must bid now!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c seems a normal contract - but north will probably compete to 5@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: or 5@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6-5s are designed for defending|pg||
nt|mrdct: and nor are 7-4s|pg||
nt|kareno: There's a famous bridge adage - "6-5 come alive"|pg||
nt|kareno: Did you mean aren't designed for defending?|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sorts of hands you have in the back of your mind the risk of pushing the opps to a making slam|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed *aren't|pg||
nt|algraves:  3@S by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  @H & @S      2@D asks longer/better|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kareno: And with the information provided in the auction, e/w can make six clubs by picking up diamonds - queen first.|pg||
nt|pef: that balance may let n/s back into four spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C obvious showing a heart fit, but i don't know whether he is just improvising|pg||
nt|ahollan1: showing a Limit Raise     i never remember if that is original or modified Bergen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some situations 1N is 14-16, but i think this 1N is supposed to be 15-17|pg||
nt|baldfriede: All they give off is a trump.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True indeed|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think they'll get to 4@s ok now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 3@C limit is reverse bergen|pg||
nt|kareno: They need to get some IMPs on the board.  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: But declarer has nasty guesses in all suits|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south should bid 4nt instead of 5c, since n will bid clubs with equal holdings -  n came to the rescue though|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: first guess np|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This lead is helpful though.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: except @HS|pg||
nt|kemperg: even 6NT is "good":(|pg||
nt|sybarra: need the same drop of stiff K doesnt she?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will also require dropping the @DK|pg||
nt|pef: yes, a good hand for Polish style 2 bids, although I think I agree with opening 1 spade on the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: who was it said  "Any slam that makes is a good slam"?|pg||
nt|kemperg: -1|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: of course Zhejiang Huamen are amongst the favourites also|pg||
nt|mrdct: joe feeling that he's pretty much fully described his hand with 3@h so no need to say any more|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes.  I guess 1@c starts with 15.  So the auction by west was natural.|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer could ruff here and overtake the spade jack to pull trumps.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: seems the indicated line|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c ruff looming in declarer's mind|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the delay here is puzzling,but declarer is probably worried about a dummy lock after the spade ace wins|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kemperg: cant do wrong in @C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and second, and therefore problems vanish :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Now this is a bit disappointing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink also got @S right in the slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which would probably get you to 4@S|pg||
nt|pef: four spades is not a particulary good contract, anyway.  even with diamonds 3-3 it has lots of difficulties if e/w tap declarer with hearts|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|kiwibridge: he gets a lucky lead|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: if courtney thinks west has @CA and @DKQ he will get spades wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: It's pretty well impossible for the defense to get any traction on this hand.|pg||
nt|frankaus: not many bunnies in the "field"|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi all sorry i am late for work|pg||

nt|frankaus: welcome|pg||
nt|mrdct: huub bertens in the closed room for Zhejiang was on the winning netherlands team at the last instalment of this event on the Gold Coast in 2009|pg||
nt|chilloncan: thx, plane was hijacked, close shave|pg||
nt|kemperg: N is very shy here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: previous hand suggests that NS don't have "scrambling" NT calls in their arsenal|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kemperg: coffee break?|pg||
nt|kemperg: what does he need ti make? |pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: i do understand how in context of 4-card majors it might make sense to forgoe Drury |pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: If south gives north a club ruff, then the diamond goes away.  Declarer will worry but north will be out of trumps.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: silence by S has a chance to play off|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S KQ stiff in E?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kareno: This is a count situation and I believe the jack of hearts showed three.|pg||
nt|mrdct: south trying to figure out what hand partner can have to beat this|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|mrdct: unremarkable hand|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mrdct: there are actual two teams from Zhejiang in the field so best to refer to this team as Huamen i guess|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Huamen Beings|pg||
nt|pef: it was better to duck the diamond, but hard for duboin to know|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: the open room have lost board 6 hopefully it will turn up|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: (west is passed hand, so couldn't have the @SA too in that case)|pg||
nt|mrdct: now declarer is in total control|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|kemperg: 33 or 10 or Q 2nd, best % play in @C|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: there we are|pg||
nt|athene: but it cost east a trick to deceive in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so it doesn't really matter|pg||
nt|athene: still making|pg||
nt|mrdct: in bridge ability they are beyond mere mortal humans|pg||
nt|fluffy: I think there are important small nuances on this bidding, south might have though that since weichsel decided to pass 1@s, he had not opening values|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kemperg: small @S to 10 now|pg||
nt|kemperg: Brink played the restricted choice|pg||
nt|pef: he might play safe for 2 now by ruffing something back to his hand, ruffing a diamond high, and now making 5 if trumps were 3-2, |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|sT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kareno: My cat Stella enjoying the view from my lap :)  She loves bridge!!|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: quite a different result to the other room, 7 imps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: Now back to the dummy for the second diamond play.  Declarer ignores the spade jack :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kareno: There|pg||
nt|kareno: is the dummy entry south was mourning|pg||
nt|pef: which is what he's going to do.  however this holds himself to making only 2|pg||
mc|8|nt|mrdct: my dog is the same, but it's hard for him to control his wagging tail when he gets a good hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Stella is more sedate|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or play safe - @S to Ace, club ruff with J and 10 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so in the end -1 imp|pg||

nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like an inviational raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: these are double edged in that if opps come in they might easily get too high|pg||
nt|athene: but of course they are also risky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Burgess sooo strong, maybe they'll be able to unravel|pg||
nt|athene: they pre-empt your side out of your own best contract too much, in my opinion|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe they get there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought i was having a flashback   just couldn't remember which decade|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1@D=4+@H's|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1@H=all hands with 3card hearts but not forcing, or some hands with 4@H's|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT is interesting|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am all for showing the @H.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me too|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like a GF variety|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: shorter auction same spot|pg||
nt|peachy: 3H might be generic game invite|pg||
nt|fluffy: if north had decided to double|pg||
nt|fluffy: wich for some shows a balanced hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: last night one of these bids at unfavourable ended in -1100 to save 430|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be a misunderstadning here for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=game force  in this case  8-11 or 15+ HCP and 3 places to play|pg||
nt|mrdct: west doesn't|pg||
nt|pef: curious.  normally double by north would show a hand that was a balanced strong nt of some variety.  I wonder why he didn't do that|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: burgess takes the low road|pg||
nt|chilloncan: one does open 1D when dictated by a draconian system, but the undfettered heart yearns to open the eponymous 1H|pg||
nt|mrdct: or not|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps vugraph mistake? the bidding might be a kokish 2@c-pass-2@d-pass-2@h-pass-2@s|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andy_h: Gosney would like to pass the 1@H but 18-19NT with 3 hearts would also bid 1@H so he's constrained to bid 1NT|pg||
nt|baldfriede: If you have both majors, show them, even if you have a fit in one.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2nt showed an invitational raise with 4 spades.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C= (54)/55  @C & @D  or  4@D & 6@C|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@h might help south diagnose the wasted values in @h and stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|pef: I wonder if it was actually south that bid 2d and this is a kokish auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps just a little bit cautious|pg||
nt|andy_h: I suspect that 2@C or 2@D by Gosney would be artificial (aka xyz)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C clarified short @C or @D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: he may suspect that|pg||
nt|pef: but north doesn't really have a kokish hand, only a 2nt rebid, so I am confused|pg||
nt|fluffy: :) though the same, but the 3@d is onconsistent with kokish, so the bidding must be right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the pass over 2@D was alerted|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: but he does have weak trumps |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@H shows 4  [support dbl situation??]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy 3@H bid seems to support that guess|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: grab a coffee everyone :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=1@D 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: but 2NT looks OK with everything stopped nicely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N = to play if 8-11 HCP|pg||
nt|mrdct: opportunity for a non-vul game swing for japan|pg||
nt|mrdct: this looks doomed for 2@d, 1@h and 1@c to lose|pg||
nt|pef: probably double by lair would have been a second negative so the pass was game forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: and the @d7 is now going to come into play|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice system, W was not interested|pg||
nt|kemperg: East|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: still 6@H should have some play? especially with the lead coming up to those luscious minor suits|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@h apparently like Kokish, showing great extras.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT also promises 4@s curtis cheek tells me|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: In OR they wer ein 5@d, dropping stiff K|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to get the @D on the table|pg||
nt|pef: well they got to a safe spot|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: the auction didn't reveal whether 5@S & 4@H   or   5@H & 4@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: kokish style here it seems|pg||
nt|wygbe1: e took a flyer here = got lucky to find no club waste, got unlucky for 3 finesses to lose|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: well read|pg||
nt|kemperg: well bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is on board 6 -- but i bet they don't repeat our auction|pg||
nt|fluffy: sementa might decide to duck this|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrdct: i think this will end in tears for EW with 3NT going down|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is bidding  7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: half our audience are commentators obviously enthralled by the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: anything happening Catherine?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ish is thinking... of dinner perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: his thoughts won't help him on this board|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: not a good advertisement|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, for all that fabulous east hand I think they are overboard already|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4D ok i thinl|pg||
nt|mrdct: although on a @d lead from south he might scramble a 9th trick in @s before NS wake up to their cashing @h tricks|pg||
nt|chilloncan: oh wait, W would be declarer sprry|pg||
nt|kareno: West looking for a potted palm to hide behind|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm afraid i can't give much insight here as to what either east or west has shown|pg||
nt|mrdct: i've got one right here for him|pg||
nt|kareno: I think east has shown a massive club hand with a spade side suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: What do 3@H mean from E now? Sr for interrupting|pg||
nt|chilloncan: was 1H a GF?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  3N a bit unexpected    1@H denies game force|pg||
nt|fluffy: to keep comunications open|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: our esteemed bulletin editor watching live confirms Sementa bid 2@D|pg||
nt|fluffy: wich results on 13 tricks|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry 12|pg||
mc|10|nt|mcarroll: only 2 Aces to lose in this - or indeed almost any other - contract|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 10|pg||
nt|pef: strange duck lookng at that dummy,  I'm sure he claimed 12 tricks, not 10|pg||
nt|pef: I think this was really an imp to north/south, not east/west|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|woozle: Apparently Lair also passed the South hand on 7, and also reached a partscore. This isn't persuading me that passing that hand is a good move|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i believe 2@H shows specifically @S & @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [ghestem]|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|woozle: Madala's bold 2H appears to have earned him a plus score in 3C when 3H is on the other way...he'll probably earn six imps for his enterprise|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Ish gaine an imp bless him|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s makes here for N/S.|pg||
nt|kemperg: for them:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it this was back in college   we'd say   down 1 is good bridge|pg||
nt|panja: it always is, at least you tried a game...|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S here for NS|pg||
nt|panja: only 18 HCP..9-card fit..and @D stiff opposite no wasted values..30 HCP pack|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: so i guess it would be going down in practice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 3+  but still transfer responses|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not many boards are left, time's running out for the Brown team. A 14imp was swung on board 19 where the failing grand (due to 4-1 break) was not bid in the other room|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: also a good lead by Gosney on 17 defeated a game for 12 more|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: good start for a final set for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d for NS here|pg||
nt|kemperg: fireworks here?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: We have a slam here, but it has to be played carefully to make.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s the limit for EW here|pg||
nt|kareno: China picked up 11 on the 4@s hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: precision 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: precision style 2@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: obviously if E had a major it would be a GF. with a minor it is certainly close with 3 losers |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-22|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D doesn't inconvenience the opening side|pg||
nt|bg: maybe 6|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah could be|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be difficult for EW to get into the auction now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D  Forcing 1 round?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south needs a raise to do that|pg||
nt|athene: but there we are :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This 2nt bid should be a help.|pg||
nt|kemperg: was my bid too, not yours?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: doesn't have a weak 2@H bid available|pg||
nt|peachy: 1@D again all-purpose|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mrdct: with the @HA with the singleton @d, the defence can only lead trumps once|pg||
nt|baldfriede: My bid too, but it helps nevertheless.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C fit, invite+ ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: it certianly looks tempting now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: certainly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Raptor NT overcalls -- so DBL is needed to cover Strong NT |pg||
nt|panja: should be|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@h is about the limit for NS here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h looks like a splinter agreeing @d|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@C now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @s is the better slam.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1S = no major?|pg||
nt|kareno: Double here would be takeout with primary diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: But it is always risky to balance into the opponents' misfit auction.|pg||
nt|algraves:  actually not for anybody|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h will be hard work here with this trump break|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@c - anyone know what this is?  Better than 1nt?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hods allow quasi-2N hands to peter out in playable spots|pg||
nt|mrdct: although the @d position is quite favourable|pg||
nt|kareno: Good screech to a stop!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay it shows 18-19 balanced, thanks.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm alway a bit nervous about splintering with a stiff king|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like OR may be in time trouble - only 6 boards played|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Another 3nt.|pg||
nt|kemperg: evereybodys choice 1@S?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes for me|pg||
nt|jcwla: And might not make it if did.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he has a choice in trumps, whether to lead the @DJ to pin the ten|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like 9 tricks i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry start of my message was deleted by gremlins:  flexible methods allow....|pg||
nt|mrdct: draw trumps finishing in dummy and take @d hook|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to get to this spot by many methods|pg||
nt|kareno: Note that with JTx of trumps, it is correct to lead small in case partner has queen or king.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds friendly!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: friendly but not passionate. if 8 and 7 interposed, then passionate|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if it is clear that it is a misfit, not sure that is so here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a steal for EW|pg||
nt|pef: a double partscore swing on this hand to the lavazza team.  n/s played and made 3c in the open room and 2h will most likely make 3 here unless north/south find their diamond ruff|pg||
nt|fluffy: Sementa had to pick between 2@h and 2@d rebid, he picked the best one in no time|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: e.g. @SQ K A, diamond to queen|pg||
nt|mrdct: and even more nervous splintering in a suit shown by partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@S,   1N would show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and even if so, collect 50s with possible game your way if NS are really having u on|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: even if hiroki gets trumps right, might still lose 2@s, 1@c and 1@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence have 6 top tricks here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear|pg||
nt|kemperg: for me 5@H's + 4+ minor, |pg||
nt|kemperg: It is for my partner:(|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andy_h: 4@S looks to be the limit here, unless declarer takes a view on the clubs|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a very aggressive double of 3@D by Gosney|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: too true! Still, if he passed, West would X himself|pg||
nt|andy_h: Certainly a nice partner to provide him with four keycards!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In this vulnerability yes.|pg||
nt|jcwla: NT is a home not a refuge.|pg||
nt|mrdct: but the @H8 could turn out to be useful card to play trumps for one loser - let's see|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Ruff out a small @h in @s slam to make.|pg||
nt|kemperg: I dont play semiforcing 2 openings, but still I doubt on 1@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: -2 imps|pg||
nt|pef: normal to rebid a good 6 card major over a four card minor with a minimum hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: can he find 8 tricks here?   my bet more likely down 2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice bidding as 4@H is destined to go down despite the 4-4 fit, at least 2@H, 1@S and a @C ruff|pg||
nt|kareno: Suit preference is my guess on the @c q|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: west may drop the @D8|pg||
nt|mrdct: as does declarer|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT had a play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that might balance NS into game|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: can probably surmise exact suit distribution though|pg||
nt|athene: trying to look like a man with @D108 doubleton|pg||
nt|kemperg: contract or 1 up the same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope -- escaped THAT bullet|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bg: signals crossed here so much for fancy bids|pg||
nt|pef: I'm told by barry rigal, that Lair's scorecard does say 490 on board 8, so the score is really 16 to 7 here, not 17 to 6|pg||
mc|8|nt|ahollan1: the question being   is West  5332 or 5422|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he went wrong right away|pg||
nt|mrdct: and i assume 3@d showed a red 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HK for down 2   maybe duck = down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't really apply, but just made me think of     Lee Trevino: the more i practice, the luckier i get|pg||
nt|kemperg: he's on line now, but IN OR I hope|pg||
nt|algraves:  declarer now has nine tricks by building diamond|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think that was Gary Player Al|pg||

nt|kareno: Thanks to our operator and to the specs for keeping us on our toes :)  Also to Dave Thompson who is soaking up the rays in Phuket, Thailand :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: good choice to open 1NT rather than 1@h to stop the opps from having an easy 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|mrdct: transfer to @d i presume|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS could get in trouble if they decide to compete|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: people often push the upper limit for 1nt overcall over 1@H|pg||

nt|kemperg: 1@D just makeble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep   lose 1@C 1@D and either  1@H or 1@S, but not both|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: And I am Friederike Greifswald-Tolleson.|pg||
nt|mrdct: west knows what to lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another hand with total trump = 20    who shuffled?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-8 HCP, @H or @S  --  no strong options|pg||
nt|mrdct: might collect a few hundreds in 3@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: or 500 in 3@sx|pg||
nt|mrdct: will south pass?|pg||
nt|frankaus: tough choice for V.P.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the reason is they don't want to double and have to rebid 2nt facing a possible zero|pg||
nt|frankaus: can they stay pot of 4@S?|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@d maybe a general GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but you can easily miss games doing this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically 1N was 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: courtney might try 3nt now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C weak  weak 2@H|pg||
nt|kareno: West happy|pg||
nt|mrdct: west liking his prospects|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I can think of a lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@D i prefer instead of pass|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: why?   Burgess has only confirmed 13 cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: helpful lead still a lot of work for Ish hope his brain still aware after all that thinking earlier|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he is alert and focussed we are told :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we welcome Ian McCance |pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great to have you Ian|pg||
nt|andy_h: Nice 5@H bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: nef X by W perhas describable as...optional|pg||
nt|frankaus: out of 4@S|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Thanks to all who made this event possible: The organizers, our excellent operator, my co-commentators Martin Carrooll and Al Hollander and of course the indefatigable Roland Wald.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Martin Carroll*|pg||
nt|mrdct: good lead for declarer|pg||
nt|algraves:  jocleyed them into the third best game with a bad trump break|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec says 4@H in EW|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: but that would be a bit wild since south can't have much to pass 2@H and will usually have a lot less than he has|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Bobby gave X a couple seconds of thought|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @d now and if he ducks the roof could fall in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes @C's are ominous|pg||

nt|baldfriede: Thanks to all who made this event possible: The organizers, our excellent operator, my co-commentators Frank Budal, Martin Carroll and Germ Kemper and of course the indefatigable ...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Roland Wald.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h fast arrival with no extra values|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you think South is in lebensohl situation where 3@D showed some values?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if south happens to have nothing, 3nt is getting doubled and so is 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think 2N is scramble rather than lebensohl|pg||
nt|kemperg: they did:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: but bad news coming soon|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andy_h: Although declarer still has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|andy_h: If trumps are 3-1, provided that the defenders duck a round of clubs, there is no entry to dummy to enjoy the clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if Ginossar bids only 2@C -- wouldn't be surprised to see others in 4@H|pg||
nt|algraves:  needs 6 trump tricks to go with 4outside tricks|pg||
nt|algraves:  or finessse spade and take 5 trump tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: you might argue that with some values, south must do something over 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: unless he has a penalty pass of course, but he hasn't got that|pg||
nt|athene: so when he passes and then pulls the double, he is showing a pretty weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: of course there will be times when you would like leb to be on in these situations|pg||
nt|athene: but i think in general it's better to play 2nt as scramble|pg||
nt|mrdct: @SJ here to show the @HK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andy_h: However, given that West holds the singleton queen of trumps, a good guess in clubs would see the contract for one off. If Gosney ducks the first round of trumps, declarer will ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: then be able to ruff his two little spades. If Gosney takes it with the Ace and returns a trump, declarer then guess the clubs|pg||
nt|mrdct: @sJ might score a trick here|pg||
nt|kareno: Good idea to continue now :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: which one?|pg||
nt|kareno: Small for sure - suit preference.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at K108 in hand and Q9 in dummy - west may not think east likely to be able to beat the @S9|pg||
nt|kareno: As long as east has a trump that works.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might more important. 3@D=bergen raise? E a bit mad? Then S might got the signals needed.|pg||
nt|mrdct: oh - low @d at trick 2!|pg||
nt|kareno: eek!|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yuck|pg||
nt|mrdct: @DJ and extravagent card to play at trick one perhaps|pg||
nt|kareno: West had better duck the spade now.|pg||
nt|mrdct: but this looks a very high risk defence by west which surely has an easy beat just pumping out @d from the top|pg||
nt|ianmcc: do they play udc? or by ear?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: one rarely gets the defense right after an early debacle such as we have jut witnesed|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I agree.  But still the low diamond is risky in case of this holding.|pg||
nt|kareno: I hear e/w playing 5@h doubled in the OR|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|braunstar: Hey all|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: disaster avoided|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hey Daniel|pg||
nt|braunstar: It seems Hans have built a nice lead into this last set|pg||
nt|braunstar: Does anyone know the results of the other match?|pg||
nt|mrdct: once north shows up with the @sA, the odds might favour south holding the other missing ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sometimes it DOESN'T??|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with 10 LTC and bad spades, W can pass... no game unless E can act  at almost any subgame level, in which case W wll have all values in reserve and can do the needful|pg||
nt|kareno: Still a vulnerable overcall ..|pg||
nt|mrdct: but when north turns up with the @sA, what has south got for his vul 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: gmta Dave|pg||
nt|frankaus: oh well -1 is good bridge (some say)|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps planning to take ruffs with the long @d|pg||
nt|algraves:  which I think he can just do|pg||
nt|pef: 2 hearts here was probably a two-way bid.  either balanced 11-12 or strong with hearts.  Fairly common usage.  We saw the other common usage of 2h being weakish with 5 spades and ...|pg||
nt|pef: 4+ hearts earlier|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: it was out of reach obviously with S in control|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrdct: last board of the match here|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thanks all, see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks Gary and all.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cheers again all see you in the next round|pg||
nt|ianmcc: txall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but a good win to JiangSu here well deserved in the end|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: 5th and final round of the day scheduled to begin at 10 past the hour --- approx 35 minutes|pg||
nt|kemperg: not anymore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if @H will split poorly in the other room|pg||
nt|algraves:  no 3-3 in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with King onside|pg||
nt|algraves:  so this line needed 4-2 hearts or 7=2 clubs|pg||
nt|algraves:  and was clearly best|pg||
nt|algraves:  bad luck|pg||
nt|frankaus: running scores all matches at  - http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=9&tourid=902|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The Great Shuffler strikes again|pg||
nt|algraves:  now he must lose two more hearts if North forces him in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Pachtmann contemplating non-@C shift?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|frankaus: the presire card found|pg||
nt|frankaus: presure|pg||
nt|algraves:  hmm|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ish taking his 6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, one of the seldom acknowledged -- at ;east by the busy bidders -- disadvantages of the busy-bid style, is that declarer can then all too often place all cards early, ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ESPECIALLY if the overcall is raised. and if it hurts your side to have your overcall raised, maybe it isnt the best idea |pg||
nt|kareno: Well done for the push|pg||
nt|mrdct: so making this may not be enough to win the board if 5@hx goes for 800|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: does Mullamphy EVER claim?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was 105-59 to Courtney|pg||
nt|mrdct: good @d play by south to put declarer to the guess before he has discovery of the @SA and @HQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: worrying that @C will allow Verhees to elope his small trumpm|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: it's easy to see they might reach 3n on this hand in the other room though|pg||
nt|athene: east must duck the second diamond to kill the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  West's 3rd seat opener is not automatic by any means|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrdct: as it happens - 6@h is cold here with @d 3-3 to pitch the losing @s before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i'd be surprised if many bid it|pg||
nt|mrdct: but those who do will make it|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thanks all see some of you in 20 mins|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tommorrow the real excitement starts with the KO rounds|pg||
nt|pef: hard to make 3nt at this point, I think that's his best shot other than completely double dummy|pg||
nt|pef: he'll have to read the card's well if duboin exits with a heart here.  he might take the diamond finesse and go down|pg||
nt|pef: but I think mark will get it right|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kiwibridge: N&S both have winners|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: even if west does open, north might double then bid notrumps|pg||
pc|c3|nt|frankaus: bye all|pg||
nt|chilloncan: incidentally, my comments are not critiques from the other side, i am a very bisy bidder and am acknowledging the downside of that policy|pg||
nt|ritong: BACK IN 15 MINUTES OR SO|pg||
nt|ritong: oops|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  the last 5 10-board matches in the Swiss Qualifying   top 15 and  1 seed Yeh Bros then advance to KO phase|pg||
nt|mrdct: declarer going well so far|pg||
nt|pef: now he has to decide whether sementa ducked the ace of clubs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: and now they are getting to game|pg||
nt|mrdct: about 1:50 until the next match with the lunch break now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|kareno: But what a swing at trick 2|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|kareno: Goodnight from Las Vegas :)  Much more bridge to come!!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|pef: which was going to be the same decision he was going to make later|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kemperg: 2 off now|pg||

nt|frankaus: tu all 4 ur company|pg||
nt|kemperg: see you in 10 min.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|cT|pc|d8|nt|athene: i don't think you can overcall a 15-17 NT with 19, vul, at imps|pg||
nt|athene: the risk of missing 3n is just too high|pg||
nt|athene: especially with a third seat opener which might be light|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  9 where Burgess misguessed trump in 3@D    NS never in the auction   1@S by West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 1@S East  [after transfer response]|pg||
nt|pef: since he's playing hearts here he already decided the ace of clubs is onside|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mrdct: but didn't quite time the endplay in trumps on west - needed to cash the @DA earlier|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|andy_h: Good play by Brown, holding his losses to one off|pg||
nt|andy_h: Certainly a possible pick up board, although I'm not sure if it will be enough|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: this could be a push with 3N going down -- will be interesting to see what happens at other tables|pg||

nt|panja: and interestingly, 4@H might be a good sac against 3Nt here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Gonzalo :)|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ahollan1:  10 in Women's    1C +90     3@D +110|pg||
nt|andy_h: A problematic hand for Edgtton|pg||
nt|pef: I bet sementa just bids a game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: np so he was -1 5 more to Neill|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the gap down to 18|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@c by north will probably make but by south a @s lead will beat it i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: talk about 3N & NS saves in 4@H   --  the only time i played against the great PO Sundelin was in matchpoint event -- and he realized 4N was better than doubling -- until then i'd ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only seen that happen in books|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: what's this double mean?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: and I bet duboin makes 3nt|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: the women started with Board  8 so they've already played our remaining hands of the set|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think either 2@H or 2@S is fair enough|pg||
nt|andy_h: Partner's double doesn't promise 10+ points so 2NT may not be so good when a 5-3 spade fit is available|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: the penalty x has vanished from the game|pg||
nt|pef: he's going to take a diamond, 4 clubs, 3 hearts, and a spade I would think|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: notice that the side with top 5 @S cards is the side that never bid the suit|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps DSIP, I'm max|pg||
pc|dA|nt|peachy: I have no idea, was guessing|pg||
nt|mrdct: only 3 losers, but declarer will need a few ruffs and the defence is on the right track with a trump lead|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 2C=Majors|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: X=extras|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: However, it still makes little sense to me|pg||
nt|panja: E bid 1Nt first time..because that was the normal thing to do..|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: i suppose north felt he didn't have the playing strength for 1nt|pg||
nt|mrdct: where are the extras? and she doesn't have 5@h|pg||
nt|panja: BAL hand, 8+ HCP..and a H check...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vdoubleu: That's what I was thinking|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Cannot understand it|pg||
nt|peachy: Not yet time for 'state of the match' 4H|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|pef: I may amend that to 2 spades and no diamonds :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: certainly it is a fairly poor 15|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: another interesting point on this hand is should 2NT still be lebensohl over the 2@h bid?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think south with cash a @c honour and then play @HA and another|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: How many tricks will Lew take once Curtis gets on & plays A + another heart? |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 9?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: assuming he does here|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks like 9 to me, 4@H, 1@S, 4@D|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: there will a late @c loser in the wash i think and declarer can only ruff one|pg||
nt|mrdct: joe grue's original trump lead is now look pretty good|pg||
nt|mildredb: curtis doesn't know about @S situation - probably worrying about that|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: south know partner doesn't have much in @c so he's kind of marked with something in @s for the 3@c bid|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Curtis is thinking about whole hand here & what Mildred says is the reason he has not played a card yet--the spade suit|pg||
nt|mildredb: but could be @SK|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|mildredb: @CQJ|pg||
nt|mildredb: can't see what he can do about it if that is the case|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Right, so being IMPs, go for the beat|pg||
nt|panja: but the kind of @H check he has is not suitable for a Nt contract...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrdct: perhaps he might be able to give north a @d ruff now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other matches, no trailing team has taken the lead  [but not sure how many hands scored]|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: looked more like 13 to me|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: hmmm|pg||
nt|mildredb: yep|pg||
nt|panja: that is why, after the dbl of 3@H...he had to go back to the drawing board...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps 2@S and a @d.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = no 4+major|pg||
nt|athene: you need to discuss if x of these transfer responses = the suit bid or t/o of the suit shown|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = artificia  10-12 HCP, not 4+@H/@S|pg||
nt|andy_h: yes, after board 18 and 19 which could be potential minus scores I think Brown has to double. I mean, he has an Ace and 5 trumps and partner has overcalled 2@D!|pg||
nt|braunstar: 4s the spot here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ianmcc: this will sac|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@D was xfer of course|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 3N needs more than 1 trick from partner -- that seems like too much to ask|pg||
nt|panja: this bidding got his suit out, but not his strength|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south didn't quite have a X even if it was t/o, though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can they cash 3 aces?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: can an ace go away?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some pairs specifically say 1@S = 4+@D   which fits in with Griffiths-Richman use of 1@C-1N as natural 6-11|pg||
nt|athene: entry to the diamonds getting taken out so declarer will have to play on clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but a spade shift gives the defence far too many tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Spade switch from Burgo may make the hand easier for Nye|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL  2@D was any min -- doesn't seem that DBL affected the auction|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes|pg||
nt|braunstar: heart lead will help here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c might be the stayman convention|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mwigor: either round suit ace can go if the other is cashed|pg||
nt|andy_h: I guess 3@H is some sort of spade raise?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: we're all guessing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he does have 6 losers [assuming @S has 1 loser]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems like a very reasonable evaluation |pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: well the diamonds aren't enough tricks by themselves anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unless switch|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but not now|pg||
nt|mrdct: this seems to roll home comfortably looking at all 4 hands|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: basically there is just no hope :)|pg||
nt|athene: south naturally wondering if he has to return a spade now|pg||
nt|panja: true..3N is crazy...but the actual bidding was meek|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|peachy: perfect time to refresh your drinks and coffee |pg||
nt|mrdct: but joe doesn't yet know that the @HK and @SA are onside|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: if his partner has the @SA and nothing else, it might be necessary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with my grumbling about claims -- we're 2 boards ahead of the other room|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: women's match also low scoring  thru 9 boards   Bilski 12  Clark 3|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: actually Zhuang's stretch to bid 1@S may have kept NS out of trouble|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: often in this situation you just have to ask yourself "would declarer, with plenty of tricks in the minors, duck the opening lead if the spades were wide open?"|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: and then you can see he wouldn't|pg||
nt|athene: but here it wasn't that clearcut|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: because declarer doesn't know the @CK is right for him even if he has @CAJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sidebar -- i'm confident that Kit Woolsey would object to Courtney's original @H lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|athene: woolsey likes to try to find partner's 5-card suit if you don't have one of your own|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: so he prefers 3- over 4-card suit, right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly|pg||
nt|athene: that might well be correct|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|athene: it depends to an extent on how aggressively you expect partner to act with a decent 5-card suit of his own|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: they lost an undertrick  or  2   but still a decent result|pg||

mb|1S|nt|vugrapha4: ...again :)|pg||
nt|braunstar: i wonder what 3@h here unpassed...|pg||
nt|andy_h: A good 4@H contract by E/W here. But presumably Brown will not be letting his opponents play in 4@H with his heart void|pg||
nt|ahollan1: immediate 2@S would have been reasonable too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: operator, you forgot a pass|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i assum so looking at Gill's hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: that's part of 2-Way Checkback  [aka 2-Way NMF,  also part of XYZ]|pg||
nt|ianmcc: better|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|panja: as for showing strong hand, P first and then bid 2@H on 2@D...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|braunstar: no squeeze available here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: another hand that's more interesting at a different form of scoring|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrdct: maybe not as north has 3 trumps|pg||
nt|mildredb: right, no difference|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andy_h: Can 4@S be beaten? Against 4@S a trump lead would be the best start to the defence|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: i meant relative strength of    1@H-P-1@S-?   2@S vs delayed 2@S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Gill will assume trump 22 since Mullamphy unlikely to lead from @D singleton or @DQxx|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spades come in?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mrdct: cash @HQ, @s to !Q and cash @HAK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: on  10 where we questioned Courtney's action with strong hand   Dyke started with 1@C in 3rd seat,  DeLivera bid and made 3NX fo 750|pg||
nt|panja: y, that is what I was thinking about...immediate 2@S best played as weak|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course if immediate 2@S isn't natural  ignore the question|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: east will duck the first club so there is a guess second time, if declarer needed 2 tricks from clubs|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they can if can persuade S to overruff|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: the artificial invite again|pg||
nt|andy_h: It was a trump promotion. If Nabil had ruffed high he can finesse the heart but he would have been unable to ruff his diamond loser|pg||

pc|cT|nt|athene: 4-3 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 6-3 :)|pg||
nt|athene: you could claim this at trick 1 but probably worth playing a few tricks as if a diamond gets ducked you might have 33 spades or a spade-diamond squeeze for 13|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more likely -- just clarified that Burgess in charge of @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spies will get us an update on the Hans-Brown match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using Rule of 11 -- seems the only time it would be right to continue @HJ is when partner started with @HA10843  and event then   partner must duck and South must regain the lead|pg||

nt|andy_h: But regardless of which side you're on, just make sure you and your partner are on the same wavelength|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: It is always an endless debate on whether you should open 1NT with a 5-card major or not, there are big upsides and downsides to both styles|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: NS might be a little bit of bother now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C ==  creative just doesn't seem to describe that bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Classic aggressive style from Courtney|pg||
nt|athene: but might be hard for EW to get their hands on 3@C since neither has length or shortage in the suit :)|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4 more boards to compare and it seems almost impossible for the Brown team to catch up on|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: last set the memorable moment was when player caught Richman passing throughout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson has only picked up imps on 3 boards this set|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: if partner bids 3red, you bid 3N anyway|pg||
nt|andy_h: E/W play a 9-12 1NT opening in 1st seat favourable, so it was a good thing Edgtton remembered that he was in second seat (was that your undo Andrew or Nabil's undo? lol)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we've seen that 1N-2@H is to play, so Stayman needed with East hand|pg||
nt|wygbe1: is 2c puppet or is he just looking for 54 hearts?|pg||
nt|pef: another 3nt almost certainly|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: always double to cater for the penalty pass, if you can do it without cost|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe DBL risks  4@H/@S from Richman -- which exposes @CKJx on opening lead|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm well you have a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|athene: if partner jumps to 4major you expect to make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i was thinking before it was outlawed   some might downgrade West to a mere 1N opener|pg||

nt|pef: time to thank my fellow commentators, the Yeh Brother tournament, and bbo, especially Roland Wald who|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: good approach in the bidding from East -- glad you brought it up Jim|pg||
nt|pef: arranges all the commentary for these matches|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so one more after this then the final 16 starting in 17 minutes, thanks to Catherine on vugraph, Ian and all spectators for your great feedback....|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even on the east coast (or near it), it's 6am and time for bed.  Can't take the all-nighters any more.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: so with 1@s, 2@H and 1@d on top he'll come to his 8 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: Rule:  NEVER lead from Jxx(x)      except when it's right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had partner who would chastise me/teammates even then|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: 3rd Quarter scheduled to begin in about 30 minutes|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: i guess there is not really any way south, as a passed hand, can have a threatening heart suit AND enough entries|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|panja: either E judged well, or their method kept them out of 4!@H..seems former is the case|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gill was probably thinking about what to pitch on THIS trick|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|wygbe1: funny position, cant quite unravel all the minor suit tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: and both players have discarded well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy can gain 2 imps by taking @DA -- but doubt he'll do that|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Mullamphy shakes his head|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's a pretty good assessment Matt|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: he knows he needs @D hook but also knows its not working|pg||
nt|wygbe1: still has 9 though|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last board of the set    restart after long break    about 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||

nt|andy_h: Ok we are now down to the last board|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: a mildly horrible double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 4 to score in the women's final    Bilski 24  Clark 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially since 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|andy_h: Thanks to the vugraph operator Andrew for a wonderful job, and the ABF for providing us the coverage of this event|pg||

mb|p|nt|wygbe1: though it seems 13 thru 15 havent been compared yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: might have missed a pass by west here|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 3@H Limit?|pg||
nt|andy_h: A very good effort by the Brown team and congratulations to the Hans team to be moving on towards the finals tomorrow|pg||
nt|pef: transfer balancing overcalls?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north might lead a club on the basis that south didn't double 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: right idea to catch partner's suit, but sadly giving a trick away just the same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd pick @C just to avoid leading from Jack|pg||
nt|ianmcc: possible swing here|pg||
nt|pef: huh?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not to N obviously :(|pg||
nt|pef: maybe diamonds and hearts?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: before everyone leaves    restart on the quarter hour     and thanks Adam!|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Thanks Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i knew agreements better --- 3@H just seems   overly agressive to me|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s makes 11 tricks here losing 1@s and 1@C|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will be disappointed with events after ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|andy_h: I don't know the scores for the other match but before going into the last set Courtney was up 105:59 imps against Klinger|pg||
nt|mrdct: actually we are rightsided here to avoid the @c loser|pg||
nt|peachy: We thank the Yeh Bros for presenting this prestigious tournament and for the generous prizes to winners.  Thanks for all commentators, Mildred Breed, Valerie Westheimer, Shirley ...|pg||

nt|mrdct: 6NT perhaps the superior contract|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: he'll settle down to a long winter evening of setting up diamonds|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: Results, click on the appropriate line, this is Round 1-1 of KO http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=902|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: the good news for declarer here is that he can't go wrong in @d|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  12 where we were wondering when South was supposed to bid @S  after (1@H)-P-(1@S)-?    Huub Bertens bid 2@S immediately    for a push|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|athene: he is hoping for a major suit squeeze now|pg||
nt|athene: but two rounds of spades from north would break that up even if it were there at all|pg||
nt|athene: i mean he has 8 tricks with the spade finesse if he sets up the diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a way for defense to err?|pg||
nt|athene: so he needs one more and the only hope is that north gets squeezed|pg||
nt|athene: he might be thinking about possibilities such as keeping the long heart|pg||
nt|athene: and finessing spade then played three  rounds of hearts to endplay north and simultaneously set up his long heart|pg||
nt|athene: *then playing|pg||
nt|athene: but that can't really work because north would surely have a third spade to cash so would make spade, heart, and @DK|pg||
nt|athene: you have to pitch a heart here and then just play a diamond and hope something good happens|pg||
nt|athene: but it can't ever work legitimately, on best defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and griffiths still needs to pitch something here|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. spade shift|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he has to decide which line he is going ofr|pg||
nt|athene: for|pg||
nt|athene: he either throws a diamond (if going for the throw in) or a heart (if going for the diamond establishment and squeeze)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)   instead of ofr    off|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Needs to hope Stephen to have the @H5 and insert it probably, in which case he can retain communication to his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case, courtney may just place @SJ in south  and shift to @SK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would have been non-force  [is that so bad?]  2@C game force   so  i guess 2@S or the mysterious 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@H says EXACTLY 3@S  it is easier to stomach|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many telling me it DID show exactly 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and now i see that Adam had flagged it that way  --   sorry mate|pg||
