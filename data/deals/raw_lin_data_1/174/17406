nt|Walddk2: Jo, de kan cykle hjem|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ligesom du gjorde i morges|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  hopefully we will get South's name corrected shortly|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: NS play weak notrump but north must have decided that is too good, with 14 and 5 good diamonds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: these good 14 counts are always difficult, do you upgrade to 15?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  with bare spade honours and no tens?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sharkey: The Law - 4@S |pg||
nt|jbgood: Roland vil gjerne (be)vise at også dansker har humoristisk sans - well done R:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes that's a good point|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  those trump intermeiates are useful|pg||
mb|3D|nt|simonr: Should get there with west taking the bull by the horns|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to stay out of game anyway|pg||
nt|simonr: Fourth suit forcing to set up the force|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is never stopping in a partscore once East opens, misfit in @d or not|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT is also making|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wondering now whether to bid 3@S or 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt south is wondering what to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Må være skuffende for Vest ikke at kunne bete 4@S, og da har makker endda et trumfstik!|pg||
nt|sharkey: På en god dag slem ØV|pg||
nt|athene: well they opened 1nt in the other room - maybe that was 14-16|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S has some good fortune  J10@S doubleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I understand the vugraph operator often waits until the tray moves across|pg||
nt|simonr: 3@s would be forcing and East might have Q@s and some goodies for slam - but unlikely|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yorkbeach:  card says 2hx shows 6@h and 5-9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not wise to give them a push here mrs caplan|pg||
nt|athene: if west bids 3@S now and then 4@S later that definitely sounds like more hand than she has|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @sQ and singleton @h would ideal|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so if she wants to commit to spades she had better bid four right away|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sharkey: Jeg syns S skal melde 4@S første gang|pg||
nt|baardolav: Dårlig bruk av svak løft|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S er helt ude i hampen. Hvad hedder det på norsk?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@s er ok... svak løft gjør du på 3kortstøtte|pg||
nt|jbgood: kan si det, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: helt på vidda   hører jeg|pg||
nt|sharkey: Om S har noen quacks i tillegge betyr omtrent ingen ting - styrken hans er i trumfen - svakhet ingen motspillstikk|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  surprised South bid not bid 3@h given her extra heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ignoring that seventh heart not a good idea|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's the strongest weak jump shift i have ever seen|pg||
nt|simonr: East is hating it!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with no @h stopper East was reluctant to bid 3NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: but if north had bid a gentle 3@H right away over 2@H, even if that was not theoretically constructive, south might have given it a fourth|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  need @s guess to make 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  convention card for EW http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/kaye-youngs.pdf|pg||
nt|athene: of course a lot depends on what 1@D - 2@S would mean|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|sharkey: N tror S had 3@S også...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no guess now|pg||
nt|simonr: They play weak jump shifts|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  I was expecting South to high-low in trumps|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: For resten, da skal man ikke grine af mig, når jeg foreslår, at bergenserne skal cykle hjem. et er vel en dejlig tur op ad kysten, ikke sandt?|pg||
nt|baardolav: Burde være greitt å ta en lav finesse i hjerter nå|pg||
nt|baardolav: Å sikre 4 hjerterstikk|pg||
nt|sharkey: blir litt vått etter hvert ellen laaaang omvei|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: a trump peter usually shows three trumps and a desire to ruff something|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|nt|jbgood: jo da - litt under vann også hvis de skal sykle hele tiden - men det får ferjer|pg||
nt|jbgood: går|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps i should say the ability to ruff something - defenders ALWAYS have the desire to ruff things|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  if you are playing weak jump shifts, is it usual to play that responder can rebid 3! forcing?|pg||
mc|10|nt|yorkbeach:  3@s|pg||
pg||

mb|p|nt|highshore: 4H can be made. It depends on the play of the trump suit|pg||
nt|cliveo:  Unless I'm missing something, provided E-W reach 4H one would expect a gain for the Welsh unless they misguess the hearts|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|cliveo:  The difference in systems means that E played in 4H in the closed room after opening a strong NT and W transferring to hearts|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you play with the odds, you go down here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: cashing @HA is slightly better than any other line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But not much in it|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cashing ace first is 78%|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's a familiar combination|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have all see it at the table|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk2: Same goes for a 5-4 fit actually missing KJxx|pg||
nt|highshore: i'm impressed. What is the % fro the other line|pg||
nt|petepunt: Is QH to A@H possible though in cse S covers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double finesse is 76%|pg||
pg||

nt|athene: a very good hand for a 3@S opener, but maybe 2nd seat at adverse it's ok|pg||
nt|athene: usually with a sound 7-4 you open 4|pg||
nt|simonr: Depends on how weak they are!|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's sensible yes 1@D 1@S 2@C 3@S should be forcing if playing WJS but it's not standard for sure|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yorkbeach:  Kennewell would open 4@s |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@d-2@s = weak, 1@d-1@s-2someting-2@s = invitational?|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: Skulle være mulig å unngå utgang på disse kortene?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: ja|pg||
nt|simonr: 15-17 NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: spesielt etter 1nt åpning|pg||
nt|jbgood: litt oppvurdering fra begge sider i lukket rom|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S should be good at adverse vulnerability|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is assuming that her partner has what she would have :(|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: yes i think most are raising 3@S there with three quick tricks and two trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks cold to us but the English south went 2 down |pg||
nt|athene: looks as though you should lose just the two trumps and @CQ, doesn't it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Mest af Øst|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes @h goes on the @dA|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H makable     but not guaranteed|pg||
nt|athene: i would expect just 4@D from west over a strong notrump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h suit combo to make 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H will come down to how you play the trumps - double finesse is normal isn't it?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: N hadde meldt @H forrige spill som kibs sier så 3 NT hadde gått hjem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does the encyclopedia say?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: no no|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Det er vel meget rimeligt at opvurdere Vests hånd til 18-19|pg||
nt|simonr: They play Texas transfers so this should show mild slam interest. Should have just bid 4@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not according to suitplay|pg||
nt|athene: especially since there might be issues of trying to lose a trick to north rather than south, to protect the @SK (you might set up clubs for a spade pitch)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yorkbeach:  suitplay says to lead the 10|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jbgood: ofte greit med EN hardmelder i et par - med begge kan det gå litt for fort i svingene|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: i looked at the play record and it seems declarer did all sensible things and then claimed|pg||
nt|athene: well leading the ten works ok if you guarantee to pick the position later, but double finesse makes your life easier? nothing to think about :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it surprises me too - but never known suitplay to be wrong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  running the 10 gains if North has 4@h|pg||
nt|simonr: Suitplay is a useful freeware program - http://home.planet.nl/ narcis45/SuitPlay/|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 404  play the ace  and lead small to Q  = 78%|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the fact that it is more convenient to start @h from East may tip the odds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, not so many entries to dummy, so i don't think running the ten is really an option here|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|athene: maybe it was just some error in recording - she surely claimed 10, not 8|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dT|nt|athene: ah, a spec tells me that declarer revoked|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|sharkey: For kibs looking for commentaries in English go to Closed Room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did declarer really throw a @C on the @DA?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the pressures of playing with screens|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: This is Nordanian, horrible language|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yorkbeach:  do any of us think cashing the ace is right?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbgood: glad dette er skriftlig - så vi alle skjønner Roland:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the encylopedia does|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: there are other issues in the hand - you might run short of entries to east in some situations|pg||
mc|9|nt|simonr: Should start to get comparisons now|pg||
pg||

mb|1D|nt|highshore: so close that table presence becomes very important|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|highshore: a reasonable 4 spades for  NS|pg||

nt|yo_yo: what are they?   most players like screens|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe but they do not use them very often|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  for some it is twice a year, once in trials, once in event|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  the encylopedia does not have the 8, which perhaps tips the odds|pg||
nt|simonr: The weak NT (12-14) but they will open most 11 counts NV|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jbgood: har du ekskludert søta bror, Roland?|pg||
nt|athene: the english NPC should have laid down ground rules at the start:- revokes are ok, but keep them for the partscores :)|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20    but n/s have 4@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  especailly with three 10s|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Han er i lukket rom|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: hehe|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: another good 14 gets upgraded|pg||
nt|athene: this one is better than the earlier hand, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the 5-card suit is way better and no ugly KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agree with the upgrade this time - decent intermediates as well as 14 HCp + 5 card suit |pg||
nt|yo_yo: revokes are common,  i  unfortunately do them quite often :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes  agree with the upgrade this time|pg||
nt|athene: if north tries 3@S then south should go to game even with the 12 count i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Jeg er faktisk den søteste af dem alle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: nr. 7|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hva er det som forgår her... Skal du si 1nt på 16 hp i andre melderunde... så får du heller åpne 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: with AAK and a spade fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  very favourable lie of the cards for NS|pg||
nt|ady: north declined to go further  with good shape     maybe decided would need a transfer brake to consider game|pg||
nt|athene: north would have bid game after a super-accept but otherwise stop in 2; that is reasonable, so you play 2 or 4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no one has bid so the @S are likely to split|pg||
nt|simonr: Should be a routine 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dK lead expected|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is W asking questions?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: i would certainly open the south hand a 15-17 notrump|pg||
nt|simonr: Right suit - wrong card. Soft Q to ask for attitude?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yorkbeach:  if West leads a @h, declarer wil be doing well to make this|pg||
nt|athene: she has to duck a heart lead in both hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Poor Lane is getting all the decisions so far|pg||
nt|athene: and play east for the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: or alternatively take the double spade finesse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in view of the bidding, West is probably favourite to hold the @dA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it her first appearance, i wonder?  If so, she will be nervous|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no played last year|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Lead out of turn TD called|pg||
nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|athene: if east was east leading a heart, declarer is just going to bar a heart lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's great,  she can forbid H lead :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what did the NPC say about leads out of turn? :)|pg||
nt|athene: he said, only against NV games, so this is fine|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now that I dont do , always face down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @d to Q and @h switch and similar position|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: card face up|pg||
nt|yo_yo: west on lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  of course|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @S lead probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: discussion about who opened screen|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could still go down even with @s lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  @D view |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but probably should take two @s finesses|pg||
nt|athene: there are ways it may still go down - if south plays it and forbids a heart lead, and rises ace on a spade lead and later misguesses diamonds...|pg||
nt|athene: but i think it is more likely to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Kennewell is now declarer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that mean they can lead @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: I will just have to give result|pg||
nt|athene: isn't there a theory that says you should always accept leads-out-of-turn, because a player who doesn't know whose lead it is is not likely to know what suit to lead? :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if so that's a bad decision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how does BBO cope with dummy being declarer?|pg||
nt|athene: it says "this would never happen if they were playing online!" and sulks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we might crash :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I have always assumed that revokes and leads out of turn are impossible in an online game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe I should try it sometime :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: as i understand the revoke rule, it's Lane's decision as to who is declare and the lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: the normal play in the club suit is to take a double finesse against the QJ, rather than just lead to the king, entries and control permitting|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  do we think she asked for a @h lead?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  EW card says the queen shows a queen high suit|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|baardolav: Regner med ns spiller 15-17 nt som nesten alle i norge|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: 1NT-åpinng er 15-17, ja|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|baardolav: 1nt gjenmelding? 12-17?|pg||
nt|athene: you have to lose two clubs even with the ace onside so no point leading to the king first off and losing three tricks to AHx with west|pg||
pc|hA|nt|simonr: East is looking at the jack though so should suspect this is from KQx|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: Spørsmålet er hva S skal melde på 1@S - som det gikk nå|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yorkbeach:  on the previous deal that @d7 lead looked like a short suit|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|athene: or Ax, etc|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@d må han melde... som kan inneholde bedre hender enn 11-14|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ja - det blir og 11-17 så ikke lett|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: jeg falt ut her, det blir mange stikk. Begge kasta sparene sine|pg||
nt|baardolav: så løfter nord til 3@d.... og syd avslutter med 3nt|pg||
mc|10|nt|jbgood: var vel ikke noe å spare på|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cliveo:  In the closed room, E bid 3NT over the 3D bid|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: this could survive, with just 4 trump losers|pg||
pc|s6|nt|thedoc: they only complete with 3 trumps I believe - not my prefered method|pg||

nt|simonr: East play 2NT as 20-22 but will she upgrade?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  sorry South's name is still incorrect - should be Ingham, not Ingram|pg||
nt|simonr: No|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told that EW play 3@D - 3@H shows a fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with the @C10 she might have|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: NS have had three hands so far where they could open 1nt playing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the weak notrump was suppose to come up lots, or something|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common these days to give up on stopping in 3major facing a 2nt opener to clarify the degree of fit right away|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  normally it does|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  England South on board 3 opened 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult bid for North|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@C is a bit of an underbid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  3@d stopper ask?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  some pairs play that 2NT-3@d-3@h promises 3 @h|pg||
nt|simonr: Completing the transfer with 3 cards is becoming popular|pg||
nt|athene: i think it makes more sense to play that 3@H actually denies a fit though? then you only force to game with at least a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like they are doing that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: or is it a @C raise?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a bit difficult here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  from South over 3@c|pg||
nt|athene: north would like to cue the diamonds to show a good raise in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but 3@D cue takes her past the level of 3@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North could bid 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt would get the job done|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@d stopper would be enough as the cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: you can use 2nt as a good raise also when the cue is too expensive just in general|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting idea|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT should be 1 down|pg||
nt|simonr: Once you have established a fit it avoids the two way new suit bid - is it a new suit or a cue problem?|pg||

nt|athene: declarer might have considered ducking that trick just to tighten the position up a little, but perhaps she wants to keep the option of exiting in spades|pg||

nt|athene: now there are diamond endplays|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  3@h went on the @cKQ9|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she decided to trust her opponents as they are vul against not|pg||

nt|highshore: Not 4 spades Neil|pg||

nt|athene: yes we are homing in steadily on Par Bridge :)|pg||
nt|ady: decent contract    but should bed down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  not this South|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  suspect X = strong NT with no @h stopper|pg||
nt|athene: support doubles are not that common in a weak notrump base|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Woodruff might have opened the South cards|pg||
nt|simonr: Not playing with this North!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or Shea|pg||
nt|athene: east might just bash 3nt now for want of a better bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: you need the double to show a strong notrump in a lot of auctions|pg||
nt|ady: ceertain to get to game|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to bid 2@H as that sort of sounds like 5-4 majors|pg||

pc|c5|nt|yorkbeach:  N may need to find a way to signal for @c|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to lead unsupported aces|pg||
nt|simonr: Too late - on the other side of the pond she could have raised to 3D forcing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: and of course a singleton trump is a bad lead too|pg||

nt|athene: i think passing it was ok|pg||
nt|athene: no-one forced opps to bid game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if @s4 is suit prefernce, is easy|pg||
nt|athene: so if you assume they sort of know what they are doing, making is more likely than -2, surely?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you are probably right|pg||
nt|athene: double might have a big upside if it caused declarer to play you for trump length and go down in a makeable contract i suppose|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  all I need is a singleton in either minor in partner's hand for 2 off|pg||

pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  no justice sometimes :(|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: you could bid 2@H and then if partner raises, you just bid 5@D and put the bidding boxes away to stop her going back to hearts|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h5|nt|ady: just down 1    so should be a push    unlucky for Wales  if they play in 5@D in OR|pg||

nt|athene: i assumed NS bid 4@S over 4@H in the other room but they went there on their own|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@h is an artificial force|pg||
nt|athene: is that west might have four hearts but she will have four clubs less often|pg||
nt|ady: since you know from the bidding the opps have 9+ clubs  that is the likely lead evenif you dont tell them|pg||
nt|athene: so the heart stopper and club weakness is more of a bother than the other way round|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good point|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: so that last one was points to ingham for not opening |pg||
mb|1S|nt|simonr: Two chances here to open 11 counts - West gets in first|pg||

mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  21 was the expected small swing to Wales when East opened 1@s|pg||

nt|athene: if it's close|pg||
nt|simonr: hate these South hands - they are what strong club systems were made for!|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|highshore: A useful method is to play an immediate 2 heart response as weak so that this becomes more constructive|pg||
nt|thedoc: do they play 1@D - 2@H as weak?|pg||
nt|kit: So South basically drove it to game -- seems like a bit much, but North had her covered.|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  England gained 11 on 15 when Godfrey played Lane|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of 4@S you tend to wander into, i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: as expected NS found a 5-4 spade fit in the other room and bid what larry would want them to bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  correction 4 boards|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but still a tall order in 18 minutes|pg||
nt|simonr: Three more - 30 - 32|pg||
nt|ady: rngland now a useful lead  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 29 the England NS competed to 3@s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: 5-4 spade fit and some hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  EW bid a very aggressive 4@s at the other table|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  standard law of total tricks stuff |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jbgood: 140 ser ut som en bra score for Bergen|pg||
nt|athene: they might stop out of it here though if west only makes a try|pg||
nt|ady: mis fit    wuill play 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Kennewell viewed not to open 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if it is not making even with the @cKJ onside, it is a poor contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  allowd Brock an easy 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is the only board the other room has not played|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: 3NT   a struggle|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: fall of the @C10 is nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2NT forcing   after 2 level response|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer reads the suit|pg||
nt|simonr: 2/1 FG style so 2NT is forcing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kaye might consider a slam now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there ought to be a law that all English players should play Acol :)|pg||
nt|ady: might get a diamond lead in 3NT     then better|pg||
nt|simonr: ...and still drive in the slow lane!|pg||
nt|simonr: West must be thinking about a slam|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  I realise I am a bit of hypocrite|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  a difference in system results in a different declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  easy for South to lead the @dQ|pg||
nt|athene: a cautious view from west but of course playing a strong notrump, this sequence typically shows a weak notrump from opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: very wise|pg||
nt|simonr: Well judged by Kaye|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I have not played the defence to 1NT that my brother and I invented for a long time|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead  could be best    other  leads clould cost|pg||
pc|d4|nt|simonr: You mean Cappaletti!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tough to find the @s lead unless South doubles|pg||
nt|yo_yo: landy?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes he has taken over the name :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 hearts and a spade should be easy enough i think|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ady: heart back and then J@S  |pg||
nt|athene: sure, but you just rise ace and play clubs to keep north out|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|jbgood: sjelden rett å selge ut til 1 grand hvis du har en unnskyldning for å melde|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: kløver 6 er Lavinthal i avkast.. Jon tegner og forklarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North would probably have led a trump against 4@s too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this was not the moment for a count signal in @c|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|s2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: maybe go up with A@S    and play the clubs to keep north off lerad|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|simonr: 18-12 to England in VPs at present|pg||
nt|ady: sorry William   you were first|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the other table has now finished|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: north can see the pitch coming on the long club so gets active|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|h5|nt|thedoc: has this table actually played board 26 yet?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: now decalrer's problem is just keeping an entry to the @HJ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|jbgood: tegningen er postlagt - forklaringen: Gjør hva du vil makker - jeg har alt du ikke har:)|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have done better to just lead hearts towards dummy for a club pitch|pg||
nt|athene: would make 9 that way|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  thanks everyone - see you a bit later|pg||
nt|athene: just rely on the @CK onside|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: is there another match tonight?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  second half of this match|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 9.55 the next  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is a 32 board match|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: see you then |pg||
nt|athene: "round 1 of 2" was a clue|pg||
nt|ady: yes   |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s8|pc|cK|nt|athene: couldn't the @H109 be with the @CQ here?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|thedoc: what was result?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: was when the diamonds went 5-1 in 3NT    almost went down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes North made 3Nt despite blocking the clubs|pg||
nt|thedoc: ok thanks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: is this safe?|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT was made   not sure   10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|h9|nt|athene: and north could have ducked that trick, killing the entry to the @HJ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  squeeze|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: end play possible|pg||
pc|hT|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: simpler would have been to put the @CJ in on the second round of clubs|pg||
nt|ady: not nessaary|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the contract was safe anyway with what had been thrown already|pg||
nt|ady: might have been a squeeze   |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6 minutes for 2 boards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely a claim|pg||
mc|8|nt|ady: what happened|pg||
nt|simonr: What happened here?|pg||

nt|cliveo:  The two teams play different styles - the Welsh play weak NT and 4-card majors whilst the English play strong NT and 5-card majors at both tables|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Patrick Shields|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: Hi all - looks like we start here with boards 31 and 32|pg||
nt|cliveo:  This should mean we usually get different auctions at both tables|pg||
nt|highshore: 1NT looks like a very sensible contract|pg||
nt|thedoc: difficult lead on this auction!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|thedoc: that gives 3 @C tricks and a tempo|pg||
nt|petepunt: evn all|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|cliveo:  Even with a 1 diamond opener some Wests would have led the suit|pg||

nt|athene: acol for NS, 5-card majors strong notrump, short club for EW|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  very mysterious|pg||
nt|athene: i thought declarer might have played that off but only if north ducked the club|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yorkbeach:  1NT and transfer expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: standard leads and signals for both pairs|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: another way that difference in notrump range produces swings|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: east maybe intending to bid 3@S over 3red|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|yorkbeach:  England made 90|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so this baord cannot be flat|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: that typically shows a strong but flexible hand these days rather than just a really big one-suiter|pg||
nt|simonr: Should make 140 if you find the @SJ so a small swing here to Wales|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|jbgood: vanskelig å vinne imp her og for vertene, er vel bare teori som kan hindre Bergen å reise hjem med seier|pg||
nt|athene: club to ace, trump to king, trump?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might pitch a @s on the @d an avoid the @s guess|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: this will be tricky - in big danger of losing three trumps and a heart|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: could lose 3@H, 2@S and 1@C on a bad day|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|simonr: Then where does the @C go?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|athene: i think the only winning line was to get some sort of endplay on south in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but that would mean cashing the top diamonds without playing a second round of trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good evening everyone|pg||
nt|athene: and of course you might then run into a ruff just on normal breaks|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: so i think no reason to get this one right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from manchester|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|athene: sure, the pre-empt makes bad breaks more likely but you can't play for 4-1 trumps right from the start|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: hi :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|s2|nt|yorkbeach:  will need to guess @s for 140|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: ouch|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: back to the endplay working now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: south had to keep that club as an exit card|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: now diamond, diamond, spade|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: hand 30 a myster    not possible to be down if the play shown is correct|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|athene: and south wishes she had exited with the diamond earlier and kept the club for now|pg||
nt|athene: she will lead to the @SK|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: no need to keep THREE hearts, south|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now the coup de grace|pg||
nt|athene: you have three trump tricks so if you ever made a trick with the @HK, that was a positive score|pg||
nt|athene: can't risk leading to the ten as you might then go down |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  mistake was throwing a @c on the @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should have thrown a @s|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: west could win jack and force with diamond and you never make any spade at all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only an overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: are they going back to  26 now?|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|cliveo:  So would I|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|pjs_ch: I too would overcall; perhaps partner has diamonds and if not she might have a major|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: 3N might have had an easy run on a diamond lead to the DQ but 4H is harder|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|thedoc: tough hand|pg||
nt|highshore: apart from any other considerations 1D makes it more difficult for them to get to 3NT|pg||
nt|cliveo:  a tough contract with the bad heart break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West's full name is Kennewell, but to get that in our operators needs to delete V.|pg||

nt|petepunt: Now W ok|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pjs_ch: part of the case for overcalling on the first round ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: Siste spill nå ved dette bordet, takk til Snorre for fin jobb som organisator, videoprodusent og operatør!  |pg||
nt|simonr: Operator - can you check the players card for the correct score on 30?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|athene: 4@S+1, flat board, yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do you treat the four 5@s as 4?|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  Wales have bid and made 4@h in the other room|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 4@s better - just testing :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: support double|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jbgood: Takk også til BBO og uoppslitelige Roland Wald (som har holdt på siden 8 i dag tidlig - og som har tatt en pause), og kommentatorer Carl Mathiesen og Baard Olav Aasan!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at the other table North did not lead her partner's suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it might be slightly tricky for declarer to reach dummy twice for this spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: assuming we get a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: she might just finesse once then cash the ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: Og takk til tilskuere for interessante innspill - og tålmodighet:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gratulerer til Bergen - og lykke til videre|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't really want to spend half an hour ducking hearts for a heart ruff to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: that might incur diamond ruffs and all sorts|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok|pg||
nt|athene: well that makes life easy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@h is trick on a @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: it does work well to put the overcaller on lead, which is why many pairs play a lot of transfers after overcalls|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. 1@C (1@D) X is hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  correction - South did not overcall at the other table|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|athene: right - that's why north didn't lead her suit :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: a reasonable lead, to be fair - on this auction you expect declarer to have three trumps and quite possibly a ruff in hand|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|simonr: Spade laed here would not be a success. We are all taught to laed partrner's suit!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  poor lead here|pg||
