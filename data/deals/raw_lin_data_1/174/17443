nt|dburn: but if she had been playing a weak no trump, and opened one, she would probably be plus 600|pg||
nt|athene: well that might depend if east bid stayman allowing south to double|pg||
nt|dburn: one wonders what the Scots at the other table play|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I have to look up that heresy. Is she pretty?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: A double of Stayman after a weak 1NT is usually played as strong (rather than clubs).|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Grant/Macdonald play weak 1NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: then, England have some cause for trepidation|pg||
nt|brolucius: West may think she is worth a slam try below game.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Cue-bidding will show that there is no diamond control.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That will cost 2 IMPs, but ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south has a fair suit so might have considered a 2@D overcall - it also cuts out a lot of space|pg||
nt|athene: but three small in hearts is really bad|pg||
nt|brolucius: A text-book example of the value of cue-bidding, although they were also a bit light on values for a slam.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|paulg:  N/S are still experimenting with their overcalling style ... 2-level overcalls are supposed to be sound|pg||
nt|athene: well, or a text-book example of the cost of cue-bidding :) if west just bid 4@S she would probably make 13 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Sry...lost connection...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: np|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||

mb|1S|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi ,welcome back|pg||
nt|roghog: Hi all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my partner bid something similar to the west hand recently |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Morning everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unfortunately they cashed the first 6 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kath, Beryl, Geoffrey and Roger|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West is  S Punch  operator|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has a nice choice dbl is recommended|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i approve|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mikeirl: Welcome all, Hi John|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR result ????|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch and McGowan play a weak no trump, 4 card majors and 3 weak twos|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch is one of Scotland's more aggressive players|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass and then bid 4@S/@H later|pg||
nt|roghog: South is worried partner may expect more, but she can't bid anything here|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but tanking like this is dangerous it may inhibit partner in later rounds of the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may feel her herself ubder ethical pressure|pg||
nt|roswolf: also there is the stamina fator|pg||
nt|roswolf: operator who are screenmatesa?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|eamongall: the old scores seem to be still there ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzaz: McGowan/Youngs|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: the real score is about 78-15 |pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Germ|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Scotland lead overall but Ireland and England close behind 72 70 65|pg||
nt|roswolf: well an easy game for e/w - there shouldnt be any accidents|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: a diamond lead isnt obvious|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: well north has a choice i would bid slam since for me south has shown values|pg||
nt|lark20: exciting auction for the first board|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: lots of tricks on this lead though|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|chick: 4th best spade turns out to be the best lead|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 11 tricks |pg||
nt|capercliff: afternoon folks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: yes and a sound result for n/s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: but into declarer's bid, unlikely :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: anyway.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|paulg:  A more interesting hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Suppose the @C6 is led and as declarer, you suspect that it is a singleton and the defenders can take a ruff. By 'hiding' a lower spot-card, you may persuade your RHO that the lead ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: is from a doubleton.  |pg||
nt|paulg:  difficult for Youngs to get in on a slow auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another text-book hand. The 5-level belongs to the opponents|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How lucky we are we all those example hands|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  A good example too of knowing your opponent's signalling methods, without having to examine their CC|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|paulg:  so that you know how to false card|pg||
nt|paulg:  (or create doubt)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: must be corrected for the score|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be interesting|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: east will bid something|pg||
nt|mamos: even the ruff wont threaten 4@h here|pg||
nt|capercliff: E/W have a profitable 5@d|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chilloncan: when i said "from either side" i didnt mean EW|pg||
nt|roghog: not sure what happened, but it can be made|pg||
nt|lark20: Liz has been opening 1NT with 11 points quite often this weekend|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ralfwil: 6@de on N is a fine contract|pg||
nt|chick: 6@D makes easily|pg||
nt|lark20: But this is made clear on their CC|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now for the magical mystery tour|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S should imply a @D fit|pg||
nt|capercliff: I suspect West will bid 5@d over 4@h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: did declarer really go off on the previous board?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i love that 3@D bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 4h but tight verfy tight|pg||
nt|chilloncan: from either side|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: there we go :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: practical auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should teach her not to!|pg||
nt|mamos: I've heard of 6-4 come alive but East's pre-empt is not exactly textbook|pg||
nt|mamos: 6-5|pg||
nt|roswolf: depends which textbook mike|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|mamos: mis type  (mis-rhyme)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6/5 come alive|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: t/o obviously this second double|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I suppose 4nt was from N|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure this will get fixed quickly|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: lucky to find a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: at these colors south should probably go for the game now that opps have found a fit|pg||
nt|roghog: always lead a trump if this happens, but perhaps not so obvious with a bare K|pg||
nt|roswolf: east may well leave this|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: need to avoid Nt here|pg||
nt|capercliff: very hard decision this|pg||
nt|roswolf: sindeed but the 5 level belongs to the opps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: sally knows her partner has values for her double|pg||
nt|mamos: South probably knows she won't get rich from double   is 5@h worth the risk ?|pg||
nt|capercliff: perhaps a better start for North would have been to bid 4@d on the way|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she can also guess the singleton @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 4@S bid sounds a warning|pg||
mb|5H|nt|yo_yo: yes 4@D from north a good idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: that wont do much for defence|pg||
nt|chick: the Open Room will drop their jaws :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi ralf:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: difficult to lead from North hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: you can smell the ruff surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: unfortunately the ruff kills her|pg||
nt|capercliff: holding a stiff @d you know opponants will sacrifice in 5@d, best to set up the 5-level bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: Scotland put the pressure on here to good effect|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: west has to lead them|pg||
nt|roswolf: and does:(|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: s didn't open, optimistic 3NT by N|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mikeirl: very, passing 1h reasonable?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lark20: N/S do have 3NT on|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes hide that 4 sally|pg||
nt|capercliff: S falscards|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed will west work it out?|pg||
nt|capercliff: and now E can hold the 4@s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what other choice?|pg||
nt|roswolf: club?|pg||
nt|capercliff: holding the A@h she knows the @d trick is going anywhere|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@D yes  |pg||
mc|10|nt|yo_yo: @D|pg||

nt|brolucius: Sally Brock's 5@H might have turned out more luckily. The swing to Scotland was mainly down to the bold 3@D opening bid by East at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Defending 5@D doubled would have lost quite a few IMPs too.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  would have only saved an imp since 5@d only one down|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: you might beat 5@D two on trump leads?|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT often played as a relay for further information on this auction, since South might hold only three-card spade support.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT a relay, asking for strength and number of spades|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: At least invitational|pg||

nt|athene: showing four spades wouldn't guarantee five clubs would it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: i lost connection about 4 times...|pg||
nt|athene: playing a weak notrump though you are going to have some shape|pg||
nt|brolucius: Might be 4-1-4-4, even if they open 1@C when 4-4 in the blacks.|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, unless she is 4441|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know, best is to ask the closed room operator to shut down and reconnect to your room|pg||
nt|paulg:  if she is 4432 then she'd have opened 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That involves manual inputs afterwards|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: sure :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1NT is an alternative on the West cards, since South is likely to hold four hearts.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now South may wish she had overcalled 2@C.|pg||
nt|paulg:  McGowan will not find the @cJ lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: she might, if South doubles|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: but no one knows what that double means|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many claim that it would ask for a spade.|pg||
nt|dburn: and what should partner lead if you don't double?|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: what happens if you do that is south wins the @SK, cashes the clubs then north says "sorry, i forgot about these strong ten lead things"|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Confession is good for the soul.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I must go downstairs and compile a lunch tray. Back in a moment.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: south not willing to risk giving a trick away to get her long suit going immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Rehi...hopefully we'll be connected again soon|pg||
nt|athene: declarer probably will emerge with nine tricks here as north can never get in to lead a diamond through|pg||
nt|athene: on a diamond lead declarer might not want to use the @CA to reach dummy to take the spade finesse|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: because then if the finesse lost, the defenders would have both minor suits to run|pg||

pc|d9|nt|athene: this is definitely one of the worst parts of a weak notrump structure|pg||
nt|athene: opener is stuck with 16 or so - if you go 2nt you might get too high facing 5 or 6|pg||
nt|athene: but if you pass you can miss game|pg||

nt|brolucius: So, England bid and made 3NT on the last board.  |pg||
nt|athene: no other country i can think of has such a marked disparity between the methods commonly played and those played at the top level|pg||
nt|paulg:  although it is uncommon in the Open trials|pg||

nt|athene: i remember she overcalled 1@H over 1@D yesterday, vul, with a terrible hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Interesting bidding hand for E/W.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she is just mixing it up a little|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@C is playable, of course.|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h should be constructive|pg||
nt|paulg:  as they play weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|paulg:  i expect Kaye will pass, eventually|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East could be sure of 5 clubs with West, she might see the chance of a high club contract.|pg||
nt|athene: you might try 3@C i suppose|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: but probably pass is ok|pg||

nt|athene: 3@C should also be constructive of course - you don't bid 3@C there with a weak hand just to rescue partner from 2@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even 5@C from East is not unreasonable now.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|athene: this is a bit like climbing everest with no oxygen though|pg||
nt|athene: getting slower and slower and harder every bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps East did need to do more. West can visualize several losers. |pg||
nt|brolucius: East has only 1 diamonds and a wonderful @SK-Q-x. How can West know that?|pg||
nt|reisig: Perhaps???|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, partner almost certainly has a singleton heart too|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well bid!|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C was certainly ridiculous|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: i mean if she thought it was non forcing it was a massive underbid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sigh, we are not linked. 23 already played in the closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me find the result|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers suggest 4@D over 3@C. Yes, that would have been an accurate move.|pg||
nt|athene: east should splinter over 3@C perhaps yes|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe just bid a boring 5@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW 5@C  600|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North led a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unlucky|pg||
nt|athene: maybe east thought 4@C was forcing, but i really doubt they have this exact sequence set in stone in their notes|pg||
nt|athene: and unless it's set in stone you don't risk it|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it was lucky that declarer didn't make a few more tricks, if she had a trump lead|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason whatsoever for 4@C to be forcing after 2@H, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: even if they have the agreement that 4minor is forcing in constructive auctions|pg||
nt|athene: they have both limited their hands|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H non forcing and 3@C non forcing|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't see how you can suddenly decide 4@C is forcing|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|dburn: she has to do something with the fourth spade|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|dburn: but best is to ruff another heart, then play for spades 3-3 if the @hJ does not fall|pg||
nt|athene: ruffing hearts would be ok if the jack falls or spades are 3-3 or there is a major suit squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: so you surely don't bank all on a ruffing finesse against south's @HJ do you?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only if you play against the odds|pg||
nt|brolucius: Three chances are usually better than one in this game.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, this squeeze is something of an illusion|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ruffing now is significantly better. It's not even close|pg||
mc|10|nt|dburn: you have yet to concede a trump trick, and when you do that, they will play a spade|pg||

nt|paulg:  the second-placed Ireland team is losing heavily at the moment, so this match is very important for both teams|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if you want to set up the squeeze you had to concede the trump earlier - after the first heart ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: otherwise a spade back doesn't let you cash the remaining trumps first|pg||

nt|athene: or down a precipice - whatever you do with them|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: I eat them|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some sort of raw fish. I dare say. (Preserved in soap).|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s now will get them to slam|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: nonsense, danish pastries are the stuff of life|pg||
nt|athene: ok, another sort of interesting bidding issue here|pg||
nt|paulg:  the question is just the level that they stop|pg||
nt|athene: does east think that 3@C is like a normal jump shift?|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. does she think it's as strong as 1@D - @H; 3@C uncontested?|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D - 1@H; 3@C|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|athene: i see people often have misunderstandings here where responder passes these jumps in new suits|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C is game-forcing opposite 1@H, but just showing extra (surely) opposite a negative double.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West may bid 7@D you know|pg||
nt|athene: well, yes, maybe, but that "surely" is a hole that it's easy to fall down|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not if she thinks 3@C was NF.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not with any accuracy of course|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought opener has to cue to set up a game force|pg||
nt|athene: without any special agreements|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West cannot bid a grand. That would be absurd on this auction. East did not bid 5@H.|pg||
mb|7D|nt|Walddk2: what did I say?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Your bidding is as good as West's...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  so, as coach after the event, do you say 'well bid' or 'you were lucky'?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Another good result for England one would think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW can make quite a few spades|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: But they can't get in now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is wide-ranging in 3rd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I don't like at with that hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, South expects to be outbid if she starts with 1@D. |pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d is wide ranging for Punch, neither to do with 3rd seat|pg||
nt|athene: "a pre-empt that is known to be weak is a blunt sword" as terence said one night after a heavy session in the bar|pg||
nt|brolucius: He used to be tipsy after one small glass.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Zia would open 1NT and I am serious|pg||
nt|athene: now kaye is pulled by two opposing forces|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kaye does well.|pg||
nt|athene: a) overcalls over a pre-empt should be decent hands|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: b) the person short in the opponents' suit is the one who should try to act|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The heart lead will work admirably.|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D not giving partner any slack for the third seat opener|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: you pretty much force opps to just double you in this position if you jump to five like this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well Bill, I do not expect a hand like that for 3@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Much too much outside|pg||
nt|brolucius: North was expecting a raise to 4@S and made an advance sacrifice to create pressure on East. Not a bad move.|pg||
nt|athene: south can have a lot less defence than she has and 4@S still be going down, though|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why is that. North cannot be sure of a diamond trick, so has only one trick in defence. Why should South hold three more?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How many diamond tricks do you expect to make against 4@S when you hold North's cards?|pg||
nt|athene: one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when you are lucky, yes|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should lead 'King for count' against a suit contract at this level. An ace lead is usually asking for an attitude signal on the basis that you hold the ace without the king.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stephen is stuck I fear|pg||
nt|brolucius: Or Kaye is stuck...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Punch asked him to pull the plug|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She who must be obeyed, you know|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: yes...I know :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: More likely she would want us to get to the next deal as soon as possible.|pg||

nt|athene: well if west thinks double is not pure penalty she might feel she has to pull, with a void|pg||

nt|roswolf: rerehi|pg||
nt|mamos: NIBU giving Ireland a rough time in their match so these two teams are probably the leading teams in the competition  with Scotland some way ahead |pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mikeirl: nice bid 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: four hearts, on the other hand, is imaginative|pg||
nt|yo_yo: liz daren't bid 6 with those 4 small spades|pg||
nt|roghog: less imaginative|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 3@D is a bergen raise,  4+@H and 10-12 points (or thereabouts)|pg||
nt|lark20: The benefit of weak 2 openers|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it will make, so it may not be an excess of imagination|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with lebensohl there are ways of showing 4@H with a @S stop or without a @S stop|pg||
nt|dburn: just spoken to the England captain - or rather, I was speaking while he was chuntering|pg||
nt|dburn: so I hope he doesn't see 4@h make on this deal|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: another coffee hand |pg||

nt|kemperg: on pass W had a problem already, would u have bid?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: ace looks safest here; you don't want king - ruff - diamond to ace - club ruff|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in case it's a singleton|pg||
nt|roghog: has to avoid losing three trump tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm so your law isnt foolproof david?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, we shall see|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has to time this quite carefully to make i fancy|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer needs to draw two trumps, cash four diamonds, two clubs and a spade, then lead a spade towards @h10 en passant|pg||
nt|dburn: the trick is to begin by cashing the diamonds - then, you know that four of them will live|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wish i could work all that out as fast as you|pg||
nt|dburn: but if you decide not to believe North's @hQ on the second round, you may go astray|pg||
nt|dburn: that is, further astray than you have already gone|pg||

nt|athene: gamble|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough position for Punch straight after a very poor board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you bid with the South cards, double is the most flexible bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: 'Gamgle' could prove to be a useful word, Bill. Perhaps you should remember it. |pg||
nt|athene: yes it's a pass/double decision, no third choice|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Let me see if I can find the play|pg||

nt|paulg:  On a heart lead East threatened a ruff and Brock ruffed high|pg||
nt|brolucius: We need a program that is the opposite of Deep Finesse, seeking out ways how you can go down in a cold contract.|pg||
nt|athene: defence had better hurry up and cash their three tricks or it's 13 tricks not just 10|pg||
nt|dburn: then, you might ruff a third round of hearts with a high trump and later misguess spades|pg||

nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly appears so|pg||
nt|paulg:  if East splinters then it will be easier for McGowan to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: which it got against 5, but that's perhaps easier|pg||
nt|brolucius: Text-book advice is to lead aggressively against a suit slam and passively against 6NT. Here North will do well to follow that advice.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would have responded 2@S for most of bridge's history.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, a good hand for a strong jump shift|pg||

mb|6S|nt|dburn: good decision by South not to double 5@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: might help North with the lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: South might double a club cue-bid but not a club RKCB response, since she does not know where the @CA is.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: good shot|pg||
nt|paulg:  probably best to duck|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|brolucius: I am not a fan of making a game-try (3@C) on a slam-try hand. Nor was 4NT classical with two diamond losers.  |pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: would probably pass the double if NS at unfavourabole|pg||
nt|athene: unfavourable|pg||
nt|paulg:  board 31 was no swing, EW making 2@h in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: formerly it was considered silly to redouble with a one-suiter instead of just bidding the suit, since it gave the opponents more room|pg||
nt|brolucius: This may be a close affair.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but now that they all play takeout doubles and forcing passes, this just means that they have more room to cock up the auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can escape for one trump loser.|pg||
nt|athene: you can commit horrible auctions using penalty doubles and non-forcing passes too|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i think next x should be takeout after x 1nt|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|brolucius: A good start.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Three trumps, three clubs, one diamond, two spades and a diamond ruff are enough.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 31 was flat, 32 may also be, perhaps 3 to Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1 or 2 down in 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: But East needs some entries. South may need to duck the @DQ if that is led.|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that there is no quick entry to run the queen of hearts, unless you decide to ruff the queen of clubs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  Punch needs to be passive first of all|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff now|pg||
nt|dburn: so if South exits with a spade now...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but she didn't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, isn't she home now as long as hearts are 3-2|pg||
nt|dburn: and now there is no pressing need to get the hearts right - just knock out @dA, cash @hA and cross-ruff|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch failing to appreciate that declarer probably has entry problems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't need the fancy heart play any more|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|athene: when declarer is very strong and dummy very weak, it's common in defence to play passively and lock declarer in hand|pg||

pc|cT|nt|athene: very aggressive 3@C on a 6322 with defensive side honours; of course it might overcompete the hand but at favourable vulnerability people like to annoy the opponents|pg||
