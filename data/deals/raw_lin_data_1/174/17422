nt|mikeirl: no but 2nt was & fit showing|pg||
nt|kemperg: of coarse|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: she will take the spade finesse early and then try to cash everything hoping for 3-3 clubs or a heart-club squeeze i imagine|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|athene: entries slightly tangled though|pg||
nt|chick: true :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: i am not a fan of competing when balanced |pg||
nt|athene: south probably decided it was love all and hence vigorous partscore competition was the order of the day|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzaz: Toilet break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who for :)|pg||
nt|ady: south got opps of the hook   no real fit  and not a lot of power    but has found a suitable dummy|pg||
nt|athene: one alternative plan was to pass, wait until opps bid spades, and then double for takeout - if partner passes, you are happy, but if she bids clubs you go to diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but with Kx you aren't expecting partner to be passing a t/o x very often i suppose|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: maybe give up on the spade finesse since no chances for 4 spade tricks anyway|pg||
pc|hK|nt|eamongall: I am expecting 180 imps shared after 32 boards once Wales start scoring a few goals|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: and of course this plan has the flaw that there is no "double (takeout)" card in the box - only a double card|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|nt|athene: so if you think partner might misunderstand double...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||

pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: maybe safer for Caplan to double 2@D|pg||

nt|kemperg: 7 loser hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: needs trump leads  and 3 too hiigh|pg||
nt|athene: now if you play the queen and opps carry on with hearts you are doomed - but if south attacks spades, declarer might get home with two spades, four clubs, two hearts, one diamond|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: worth noting that north leads a heart rather than a spade - that's pretty much routine|pg||

mb|p|nt|chilloncan: I was expecting a 3D bid from S. |pg||

mb|p|nt|mikeirl: routine 3nt Ew|pg||
nt|mikeirl: undo|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: west sort of has the values for 2@H but it's a very bad hand, with three small in spades, especially playing 4-card majors|pg||
nt|eamongall: not sure the 4 card major goes as far as opening with a 5 card on the side :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ady: 4@S a make for n/s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats enough|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: double there tends to be takeout of spades - i.e. west couldn't double the first time because of short spades|pg||
nt|athene: well, north might feel she ought to get around to showing some spade support some time?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: PASS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S  from south |pg||
nt|yo_yo: would it not show the other 2 suits?|pg||
nt|athene: it's fairly aggressive with only 11 hcp and 3 diamonds - one of the suits partner is going to be bidding a lot|pg||
nt|athene: but at love all west wants to bid i suppose|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 3NT can also make|pg||

nt|Walddk7: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for results and standings after 2 rounds|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: i wonder why , with a balanced hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|ady: decent game |pg||
nt|athene: run the @S10 first time to cater for Qxxx with east?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't missing many points - if you think the double has to have 12+ then west has to have the @SQ|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but need to ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|ady: need to ruff a diamond    with A@C a good bet to be right  can make 10 tricks losing a spade|pg||
nt|athene: yes, unless hearts are 3-3, which they really shouldn't be|pg||
nt|golfsquash: seems best to win and play a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: maybe declarer is a bit worried about trump control - let's say diamonds are 4-4 and trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: if she ruffs a diamond then loses to the @SQ and gets forced again, she can't enjoy the @CK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems best to duck this|pg||

mb|3D|nt|kemperg: Thaks specs and our operator for a good job|pg||
nt|mikeirl: thanks all|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|nt|athene: you would expect people to play 3nt or 4@H here rather than 5@D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why7 bid 2c vul opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: that is a mildly evil 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i know 2@C over 1@D has good pre-emptive effect, but you really do need either a club suit or a hand, or preferably both, at adverse vul|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she feels that as a passed hand it is ok|pg||
nt|athene: because at least her partner won't do anything rash, like taking her seriously|pg||
nt|jcomyn: grand especially when someopne whacks you for 800|pg||
nt|athene: south might well just pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not easy to reach game with 14 facing a passed hand and no great fit|pg||
nt|eamongall: I still expect Wales to come storming back in session 2 of this match ... they have won 1 and draw 1 so far |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, well the pre-emptive effect of the overcall strikes again|pg||
nt|kemperg: can't blame E for that|pg||
