nt|jcomyn: w has the hand i always pick up opposite a strong bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: hook on @H|pg||
nt|benjy: @H finesse or @h 3-3 on a @H lead|pg||
nt|benjy: but there are lots of other chances too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm - last trick with the @d7|pg||
nt|larrymori: hand was good too|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1st potential slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: Current rankings -- based on first three matches and half-time scores in current matches at  http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Oh, ok.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|odysseus69: a second trump takes out the entry|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|greerm: if 1@C can be 2, it's difficult to bid 3 east|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure if the Irish captain  will allow a beer at the table. Afterwards, perhaps |pg||
nt|larrymori: at these colors and not such a good suit 2@s is suspect at best|pg||
nt|larrymori: the bid takes them out of their best suit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|baldfriede: East does not like this double at all.|pg||
nt|greerm: West not about to defend 2@D|pg||
nt|greerm: Norma F will now bid 3@C |pg||
nt|petepunt: Opening bid is intersting|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: Norht goes for it - might as well, at 60-odd down|pg||
nt|petepunt: playing 5 card majors with 15-18 and 4144 shape, i advise 1D rather than 1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: now whast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a rarity - 26pts and no bids|pg||
nt|benjy: Normal 4@S here making 11|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and could  get 800 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: looks like 800 if they get their @C tricks in...|pg||
mb|5S|nt|paulg:  i think now you ask for a few undos and bid 1N on the first round |pg||
nt|greerm: and there it will rest I think|pg||
nt|petepunt: simplifies your rebid |pg||
nt|mamos: looks like ns  will bid this|pg||
nt|petepunt: on their way|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: what is 2h anyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h will be a double negative|pg||
nt|lark20: 2@H is neg|pg||
nt|baldfriede: And it will probably go down 1.|pg||
mb|6N|nt|petepunt: prefe 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: kelly puts the ball back into Ferguson's court|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a routine spade game and a chance for a cuppa- brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 4@C in W better, |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: surely must balasnce with s hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doesnt look sound to me|pg||
nt|greerm: i think 2, 3@C 1@H and 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Ferguson has a Nepal flag, operator; could be a mistake :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4 could easily go down, finessing in trumps|pg||
nt|kemperg: max with fit|pg||
nt|mamos: yes  South may be worried about D control now  knowes 4@h is second round|pg||
pc|h8|nt|paulg:  well, i think she does have a double negative, perhaps a triple negative|pg||
nt|lark20: 2@H is "less than a Q"|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I know Nepal and Northern Ireland are close to each other on the scroll bar|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont see any flag|pg||
nt|petepunt: After 3@S South is minimum for a "serious 3N"  showing slam interest and demanding lowes cue bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|greerm: 2 off that is|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh yes  on a different tab|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|baldfriede: This will have the same result.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk7: People who use the old Win version can|pg||
nt|sybarra: click on the little cards on the bottom|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kjadams: club lead would have beat 4S.   I dislike 500 point saves with those odds.|pg||
nt|mikeirl: do not favour 3@D rebid with a poor quality suit;  partner has indicated holding the blacks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulg:  whatever you do I think you have missed game|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos: :(|pg||
nt|petepunt: not the first time wie will predict wong 2day :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: hornswoggled|pg||
nt|kemperg: leads also to 4@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcomyn: but surely 1nt by s on this auction is hardly balanced 16- hcp|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway i am not defending 1s|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will eventually play ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens this seems to be one of those times when partner does have eight tricks in notrump|pg||
nt|golfsquash: She will lose 4 trumps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and you end up in a very shaky contract - to put it mildly|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it is natural play to finesse the ht |pg||
nt|sybarra: claim coming up |pg||
pc|h3|nt|odysseus69: yes - having bid only 2S which limits the quality the West hand worth a cue which would be of no interest to East here|pg||
nt|larrymori: it was better leading from the honor|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Uh-oh.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: N's failure to bid 4@d looks the culprit to me |pg||
pc|s5|nt|baldfriede: This can go down 4 now with @d continuation.|pg||
nt|greerm: not always obvious to draw trump with such poor holdings but,|pg||
nt|benjy: or perhaps 4@H as a source of tricks, depends on your methods|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: cue for me|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzbb: sry...heart honour not played at trick one...|pg||
nt|simonx:  Well not 800 any more ... can she get away with -200?|pg||
nt|larrymori: south has to lead a @s twice now when in with the @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: defence got a little muddled...making 8 tricks|pg||
nt|petepunt: it is a very good 6 as you can lead uppto KQJ@D twice before trying @cQ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|paulg:  once she has finished trying to reconstruct NS hands that fit the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: not that she cares too much...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: but wendell had to signal spade not club |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lark20: Difficult for S to find a bid with such a flat hand and 3 suits bid by opponents|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and will go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: *wennell |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzbb: sry...|pg||
nt|benjy: Just going back to Board 3 for a moment, where a decent game was missed|pg||
nt|petepunt: main error,  but S did go on|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Claim.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg:  i think South has to double 1@s|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats my view also|pg||
nt|baldfriede: The problem was that West was in the lead, and drawing trumps from Kx does not look too good.|pg||
nt|greerm: setting up a cross ruff for the defence|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: you have to woory about @sQ too Peter|pg||
pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: i like source of tricks but the main thing is agreement|pg||
pc|c3|nt|benjy: if a 2@S opener in 4th seat shows around 12-15|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|1N|nt|eamongall: I am some what confused as in first half Finn held a 16 count with a decent 6 card @C suit and it was 2@Cs responce and this time its a broken 7 card suit and a 13 count which leps ...|pg||

nt|lark20: East and South have had some tought decisions|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still tame bidding by ns|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW still not written a score in their column yet|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: i am well aware of it|pg||
nt|benjy: I don't know what a 4th hand 2@S opener would show for them so it is hypothetical|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: another part score |pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: 5s-4card minor|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must say i dont like it|pg||
nt|simonx:  Thanks for the replay, Stephen ... it was like watching the film Memento|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  the 4-card minor will prevent Punch from considering a save|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this 1st in hand could be crucified|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will be a 1nt. Not much action so far yet.|pg||
nt|chick: it really hurts to bid 2@H with the S hand, knowing you are probably in a bad spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 18 they played 4 @H from the other side in OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi,  and Wennell is positive which suit it is  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: aces do tempt me|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|odysseus69: j of diamonds works well|pg||
nt|benjy: Some might bid 3@C with the south cards|pg||
nt|simonx:  the one that goes backwards|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: what??? - with 5-3 s fit and 2h and 2h|pg||
nt|baldfriede: And it should go down 1, Cards sit wrong for declarer.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @H is the "relay" response  (pass or correct) |pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg:  I agree, it is not a good opener at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes thats Y ciara tried 4N and sold out.  it is easy for us to oversimplyfy i agree|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|benjy: But that wouldn't get a @C lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: best start:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|greerm: another difficult play hand for Sandie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as commented, good case for a club lead - you have an honour, and hopefully can set some tricks up - heart lead needs a good holding from partner|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2N = 19-20 balanced,  3C puppet stayman.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  Easy to say that this is not the best spot, but in practice I don't think there is a good spot|pg||
nt|golfsquash: unblock now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|benjy: Would you bid 3@C guys?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes 9 top tricks|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|paulg:  since 3@s will lead to 4@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  and they are playing 4-card majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: S making it less than easy for partner...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: it is awful|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|petepunt: this will need great care to  go 1 off.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|simonx:  East will be very happy to see the 2 led ... unless they are playing 3rd & 5th|pg||
nt|kjadams: struggling to see  9 without def error.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5 diamonds, and 3 other aces.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|golfsquash: even 2@s can be beaten|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you don't have a guaranteed 5-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|kemperg: no not as invite and not as slamtry|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: this hand will not go well for declarer...(might be an understatement) |pg||
nt|odysseus69: definitely not - cant fancy 5c as a spot and dont want to help opening leader|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|benjy: Personally I wouldn't either|pg||
pc|h9|nt|odysseus69: stop teasing me Ben-I have enough problems|pg||
nt|kemperg: on 2 in OR 6@D after a raise to only 2|pg||

nt|yo_yo: ah Hilary is officially Irish now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: begorrah|pg||
nt|paulg:  in fact all three scottish pairs are 4-card majorites with a weak 1NT|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but opponents are vul and can go down some|pg||
nt|petepunt: like the wek 2@H|pg||
nt|kjadams: 1D promises 4 or more diamonds in their methods   (1C could be 2).|pg||
mb|3D|nt|baldfriede: Yes, it should make. But I doubt South will bid it now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: Another 7 imps to ENG when NI played the wrong game on board 3, choosing 3NT instead of 4@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: and begobs|pg||
nt|paulg:  no John, especially when you have a 6-4 spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: NI seem to have conceded a gratuitous 800 penalty on board 3 - 9 more imp to England |pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: a conservative 2NT foud partner with A GOOD HAND|pg||
nt|benjy: 3NT had the first 5@D tricks off the top|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: West likely to hve @C on this auction too, so East may have done more - agree bidding game is tough|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: 3NT? Obviously West never opens light in third seat..... |pg||
nt|simonx:  How will she play the diamonds?  A-K and she will make her 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: selecting the J@D...put it back|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: having a wee think...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcomyn: cleary is normally an aggressive bidder|pg||
nt|paulg:  there has been a debate on the BBO Forums about balancing after a weak 1NT|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: i will with 2 majors|pg||
nt|benjy: all roads seem to lead to 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kjadams: Potential to pick up entire spade suit for no losers|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: time to run fast|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 10@h is a golden card here.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|baldfriede: I think it is better to take the trick with dummy. You will need entry points.|pg||
nt|sybarra: safety play in case @S do not break |pg||
pc|c4|nt|kjadams: must be careful to double finesse and cross back in hearts.|pg||
nt|kjadams: or if no split, no need cross back...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|golfsquash: I would have prebalanced with the south hand.|pg||
nt|paulg:  the Brits say keep your doubles up to strength, those less used to it want to double with any 12 points|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well i also agree with that not-vul|pg||
nt|mamos: The bidding makes it likely that the @SK will be right for EW |pg||

nt|odysseus69: sorry - not paying attention|pg||
pc|s3|nt|baldfriede: Though it does not make a difference here.|pg||

nt|jcomyn: the one certainty is they wont be defending 1nt|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can they stay out of 6d|pg||
nt|greerm: a better hand for the specs|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Still no slam in the air.|pg||
nt|greerm: 5@D for EW and should/will NS save?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: uptrick  :)  that's a new word for me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly a big swoing there as well - not looking good for NI|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: fancy ew to play 4h|pg||

nt|greerm: 4 or 5 as North?|pg||
nt|benjy: 1@H X P 2@C 2@D 2@H 3@D ?|pg||
nt|benjy: Then what would south bid? 4@C?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jcomyn: indeed can theyb stay out of 5|pg||
nt|greerm: i prefer 5 but not everybody|pg||
nt|simonx:  A misfit 3NT - but it should make in comfort with all the suits behaving.|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 19  was worth 9 as they played 4 @S making in the other room |pg||
mb|d|nt|petepunt: figures|pg||
nt|kjadams: 1C could be short.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3-card s support i assume|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: aka overtrick |pg||
nt|petepunt: a very lucky 4@H for e/w here - they wont get anywhere near it though|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think it's easy - dont want to punish partner for contesting part score  but we do have six card suit and Aces  - Im surprised she didnt compete to 4@d at least after 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: slam? Can you make game?|pg||
nt|simonr: Hi Greer|pg||
nt|greerm: makes if declarer uses the only entry to finesse @D, lets see :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 5 has good chances; it probably does not need much more than A@d right-sided.|pg||
nt|greerm: hi Simon|pg||
nt|baldfriede: So I would go for 5 too.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @C on the finesse here |pg||
nt|sybarra: real question is do you want to be there?|pg||
nt|petepunt: unlikely to get that high |pg||
nt|petepunt: what about 4th @S|pg||
nt|kjadams: 9 tricks in 3N even if they wrong side the hand.   (6clubs, 2 spades, 1 heart off the top, more with help).|pg||
mb|1S|nt|benjy: 3@C!|pg||
nt|benjy: Am i seeing things?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 2@S  must show a good raise to 2@s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|benjy: 3@C is a monster underbid.|pg||
nt|kemperg: don't have to be paranormal for this one|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north has some to spare now|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes 3@D showed a fair hand else 2N,  agree 4@D might punish partner sometimes|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: declarer cannot expect the perfect @D layout, may go off|pg||
nt|sybarra: true not sure they can handle 6 |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: well you know them these days if you are not in 3nt you are in 6d|pg||
nt|petepunt: work to do to make 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: ah, no entry so will go off |pg||
nt|kemperg: but 3@C ???|pg||
nt|kemperg: hoping for X now?|pg||
nt|petepunt: west will pass|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: sort of wrong sided but ok with A@D onside|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@C is the kind of bid that deserves the auction to proceed all pass and hey presto game is cold|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice bid 5@D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it is often a mistake to support partners minor with nothing but 5 trumps - it often helps opponents|pg||
nt|benjy: Cheeky pass from Caplan over 4@C, hoping not to push the opponents into game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: friendly lie here|pg||
nt|simonx:  The result has just come in on the board where Caplan made 2@s doubled - 16 IMPs to England ...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: I thought she would bid it given they are behind |pg||
pc|cA|nt|diumraid: Does anyone remember the scores for boards 18 & 19 in this room. I am doing Live scores but need this to be up to date :) -  Help appreciated|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky the ace of @D on side  |pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: u were right paul|pg||
nt|simonr: North will need to exit a trump|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, but to shut out opponents?|pg||
nt|simonr: Needs to overtake and continue @S|pg||
nt|greerm: or let south continue @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: you were faster Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hope i am on the tennis court in 30 mins|pg||
nt|benjy: North has a normal X of 5@D which will go two light|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: i x on the s hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont wait for p |pg||
nt|paulg:  1@h was not much of a space-consuming vulnerable overcall and, unsuprisingly, McGowan expected more|pg||
nt|paulg:  South will open in the other room, so they will not be in 3NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: want to bet|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: South will not open :)|pg||

nt|benjy: brb|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see that on board 20 the Englsih NS did collect 800 from 2@Sx |pg||
nt|simonx:  You were right with that 800 prediction in 2@sX, Mike, but at the wrong table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: twas ever thus|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly a game swing on 22 as well|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|kemperg: end result the best|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kemperg: yes par|pg||
nt|odysseus69: without te 3D bid my guess is that 3C would have been the end|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yo_yo: someone commented that there had been so slams yet|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lark20: How lucky can Scotland be?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: A little gift.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that would be my cup of tea|pg||
nt|simonx:  The way the VP scale goes, England are capped when the score gets to 25-5, but the Northern Ireland score carries on down to 25-0, so they still have something to play for.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they will probably come fast and furious soon|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|mamos: with the cards  so badly placed NS have done well to stay in 2@s here  I can imagine some pairs getting higher|pg||
nt|petepunt: shoul play on @S next|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: I dont believe this its a mirage|pg||
nt|simonr: Although the @H look ominous if North has the corect count (which she does) she should realise there is no entry|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|paulg:  I don't understand how North can double and South cannot|pg||

nt|vugraphzbb: will do it  after this board|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|paulg:  just goes to show, it is not what you hold in your hand that  matters, it is what your opponent thinks you  hold|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|greerm: claim soon?|pg||

nt|lark20: What contract?|pg||
nt|paulg:  In the other matches, Northern Ireland are beating NIBU by 8 imps and England lead Wales by 7 imps|pg||
nt|simonr: A thin 4@S here |pg||
nt|sybarra: NI bringing this back to a good fight|pg||
nt|benjy: 3NT by south looks cold|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3NT here|pg||

nt|larrymori: but favorable usually not this good|pg||
nt|larrymori: does have the death shape though|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3nt|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@H rather|pg||

nt|larrymori: south might raise here|pg||
nt|petepunt: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: and by north too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT is the spot and they should get there - 1D -1S -1NT and a move from South|pg||

nt|petepunt: 3@D weak probably |pg||
pc|h3|nt|greerm: ah, we got Laura's name corrected, South next?|pg||
nt|simonr: Confusing the operator with the name changes - sorry!|pg||
nt|greerm: operator was changing the spelling for us :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|paulg:  naturally you run to your other major|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i mean the s hand is big enough to look fo a chance, but not opposite thast hand|pg||
nt|benjy: If you bid 1NT you will never get across your shape, or playing strength|pg||
nt|mamos: yep Im betting on 3NT|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2N = 19-20|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|simonr: South should have signed in 4@H and denied a @D control - if that is the methods|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  if the South hand is interested in slam then it should be bidding suits and not notrumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I prefer 2NT to 3D - maybe they play a wide ranging 1NT rebid- used to be popular 20 years ago|pg||
nt|benjy: Declarer has to rise with the Q@H then duck the @H continuation, pretty normal stuff|pg||

pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s6|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|benjy: Yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: What was W thinking?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the problem with 3D is that South faces some difficult problems - usually 2C is available as an enquiry which allows a 3D rebid|pg||
nt|benjy: The 10 was right on all layouts, declarer could not have 3 small @Hs as they would have called for the Q|pg||
nt|kemperg: evidently|pg||
pc|dT|nt|benjy: She still could have recovered by not playing the K@H on the 10@H|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|paulg:  small club now|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|paulg:  however, a spade exit guarantees one down as many are telling me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this loooks an awful contract|pg||
nt|mamos: tempo is rapid at this table nine boards already and some way to go to the hour |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|petepunt: may have been prudent for S to pass with most points utside her suit|pg||

pc|d8|nt|greerm: duck and claim|pg||
pc|d7|nt|odysseus69: trying to go down|pg||
nt|simonx:  ... and with high level doubles being so ambiguous they will get away with 2 down undoubled|pg||

mb|3H|nt|simonr: South is horrible if you play 5 card majors - fortunately they play 4 |pg||
nt|benjy: 1NT looks normal but what do i know|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H by S?|pg||
nt|petepunt: or 4s by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Not sure why Sue opend 1@d though plyaing Acol style|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: wont try 4h now|pg||

nt|petepunt: suspected 2N was the pragmatic bid South done well again|pg||
nt|mamos: but with one leap they are free :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: surprisingly South chose 2C when most including me would be bidding hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  a spade lead may not seem so obvious to McQuaker|pg||

nt|mamos: North thinking about Slam ?|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: oh well should have known what onishuk would do|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still has to be beaten|pg||
nt|paulg:  it has been suggested that the EW pairs are struggling with this bombardment of games from NS|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 2S not recommended|pg||
nt|kemperg: S expects a second chance|pg||
nt|benjy: How on earth can north pass 2@C?|pg||

mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: on the way to whewre|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@h now?|pg||
nt|paulg:  and then 3NT|pg||
nt|lark20: Bad diamond break too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks like 3nt and a prayer|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course 3@h sounds like a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|paulg:  but you are close and you have the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|simonr: Staying low - should make nine tricks here unless East leads a @C|pg||
nt|kjadams: this one too hard.   e/w actions very understandable.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: fight back under way|pg||

nt|jferg: well i think flat 12 bid 4nt|pg||
nt|chick: Now E just has to manage not to pitch a club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surely North is FAR too good for a direct 4@h|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3n also makes of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  perhaps being non-vulnerable was important |pg||
nt|paulg:  games need to be 50% to be worth bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: i think so...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you would be amazed at the number of players whon regard 2c as a WEAK bid and have to jumpm - crazy as it seems|pg||
nt|lark20: 2@C just may not be forcing in their system|pg||
nt|larrymori: for sure|pg||
nt|petepunt: although 6D maybe better than 3N as both need @C right|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I don't like going on with this weak suit.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  2@c is not forcing in my system, but I don't expect to miss game with a singleton heart if partner passes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: then play new minor forcing|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|greerm: Norma Franklin has now found her parters K 3 times in a row|pg||
nt|jferg: yes|pg||
nt|petepunt: needs to take care not to cash too many @H too soon|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  less happy after that lead of course, but it will improve/get worse depending on how you look at it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder what n would have led against 3nt|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|simonr: If their style with amjor/minor is to open the minor as Laura has done I am surprised that Sue did not bid 1@H|pg||
nt|greerm: on opening lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|larrymori: it was 2 or 3 @s|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|sybarra: and lucky lie of cards as we see |pg||
pc|c6|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: amazing entry with S8|pg||
nt|paulg:  Yvonne did well to rise with the ace of diamonds, given the late spade entry|pg||
nt|greerm: John Collings once told me that the great Cansino said he knew when Collings lead away from Ace|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Some people are mind readers at the table. It is an amazing knack.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|greerm: Cansino was said to be a brilliant defender|pg||
nt|sybarra: E may be challenged for pitches on the diamonds however |pg||
nt|petepunt: cant fault East 3N was automatic really.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: agree Peter |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|odysseus69: on board 9 I still prefer a NT rebid - |pg||
nt|mamos: ducking Spade was wrong I think|pg||
nt|petepunt: we simply point these things out so specs can ponder on what might have been :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: exactly.   pitching a club will look a lot more attractive than a heart from the Jxx|pg||

nt|larrymori: another slam here|pg||
nt|simonx:  Let us see if England can bid their slam ... it should be straightforward|pg||
nt|simonx:  I am at my best when I can see all four hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: aren't we all|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: this isn't the jand they are playing...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: *hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: ...although E is on 4@S :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW might get there if it starts 1@s-3@d  |pg||
nt|simonx:  I am geographically dyslexic - I can only commentate on the board if I am South - and not very well even then|pg||
nt|mdgraham: too modest|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: it had 4 top losers but they only cashed 2 of them and now the other 2 have gone...|pg||
nt|mamos: It's easy to look at one suit in isolation and make the "automatic play" -- duck and not think of the whole hand till it's too late  -  |pg||
nt|petepunt: Aid Thomas(NPC) wont be happy as they had done the hard bit of biddng the 'poor game'.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and in 6 @D you will worry if @D's break right |pg||
nt|baldfriede: -1 only?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Should have been -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: yes|pg||
mb|1C|nt|baldfriede: And again no slam. 12 boards without a slam is rare.|pg||

nt|simonr: No slam last night either in 32 boards|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Let's keep our fingers crossed.|pg||
nt|benjy: 9 imps to NI when  ENG stayed out of game on board 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: (and clubs behave as Peter said) etc etc|pg||
mb|1S|nt|greerm: west will bid @D now|pg||
nt|benjy: Frisky 2@S from Godfrey!|pg||
nt|benjy: That should shut west up|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Double by South - too strong for 1NT in the balancing position|pg||
nt|benjy: wrong again|pg||
nt|mamos: he'll probably tell them quietly where they went wrong :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: N will be interested in more than game|pg||
nt|sybarra: qx of hts might slow her down |pg||
mb|3S|nt|benjy: For me 4@C would show @S support|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2 key times to think in card play a) when dummy goes down b) when you first gain the lead as defender|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@C stands out for now|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: East likes that:)|pg||
nt|simonr: North might try 3@C - showing values if they have a Lebensohl option|pg||
nt|petepunt: ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: skinny but 2 majorsd makes it decent ernough|pg||
nt|benjy: how can you pass and introduce your own suit in a competitive auction at the 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: but Sandie may go again|pg||
nt|greerm: nope|pg||
nt|sybarra: in tempo raise to 3 nt or the sham of stayman?|pg||
nt|benjy: and why did north pass 4@C instead of Xbling?|pg||
nt|sybarra: was that a help suit try? |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|greerm: leading from shortage not always recommended with long trump|pg||
nt|chick: but you know what ... unless W has a heart honor, 6N is cold, so baring the @HJ can't hurt|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: 13 tricks maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  10 is my bet|pg||
nt|sybarra: or sort of a zia cue?|pg||
nt|petepunt: prefer 4@C from S then 4@D from N and job done|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petepunt: Wales gained 8imps on a part-score where Burns in 2@S-2 so all sq.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|petepunt: Zia would follow thrue with 4N :) after psychic trial bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: lol:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: puppet stayman is not a sham when you have a 3 card major and a singleton|pg||
pc|sA|nt|benjy: If east wins and plays a low @H then declarer has to guess the suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: true cornelia |pg||
nt|odysseus69: the double may be a clue|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|petepunt: we see this is easy but Ciara will have many worries here :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: a rare winning red vs white 1 trick save, but if partner had singleton heart, 5C would be a make.|pg||

pc|s6|nt|paulg:  haha Stephen|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petepunt: any way well stopped N/S|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||

nt|paulg:  and, as most Scots will know, Ms Punch is not the fastest player in the country|pg||
nt|paulg:  sometimes you look at your scorecard and just see a small -3 imps and not worry, but I guess the Scotland captain may wonder how his pair bid freely to their 5-1 fit on board 25|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Desmond Deery a great Irish player of the past did not like to claim- he said that then when he was not claiming the defence would believe they stil had a chance|pg||
nt|mdgraham: do you know which board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: ah.... this was the board :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: playing board 30 now|pg||

nt|petepunt: e/w has some great hands this set|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petepunt: 1NT 15-17 for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: There was a similar hand to South's last night - lots of debate as to what to open|pg||
nt|greerm: I love these big hands with no obvious bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: and he was the fastest player ever?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|greerm: for those of us who don't play strong @C that is|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT cold as cards lie  who says you need stops|pg||
nt|petepunt: thats Y I open 1N with nrth Di has a tough bid now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and bd 19 will stand out in their mind :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  if I were npc I might suggest that they slow down a little|pg||
nt|petepunt: then thts Y I'm called PetethePunt:)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|simonr: Treating it as a GF in @H or 23+ balanced|pg||
nt|chick: NS playing Weak NT, so 1N now shows 15-17|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S might prefer to play in clubs |pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: but she doesnt know N clubs are as good as they are|pg||
nt|mamos: oops 3@s  looks like an accident happening|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go again close to slam |pg||
nt|petepunt: @D lead look nasty|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: thats enough|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@H or X guys?|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5D makes too though!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos: do we know 2NT?|pg||
nt|petepunt: expect @C lead though|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: GF in @H - partner will exepct a better suit! But if you bid 2NT partner is not expecting a singleton|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H for me|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H or a coward pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ENOUGH ena|pg||
nt|greerm: not everybody's choice the 4@H but a difficult hand to bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|greerm: @C leads best |pg||
nt|simonr: No entry to table for the spades so will drift a couple off|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Communication problems for declarer.|pg||
nt|sybarra: that would be nice :) |pg||
pc|c6|nt|paulg:  Surprised South did not continue with 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: seems better than 3@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a very good game missed|pg||
nt|lark20: 3@D would have been more helpful|pg||
nt|paulg:  over 3@d North would have a tough decision|pg||
nt|paulg:  easy to pass 3@s with no controls to speak of|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg:  and only three points in partner's suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: the brakes are screeching |pg||
nt|petepunt: this WAS a hand for a Zia 4@D cue by West |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petepunt: lower2suit I suspect West expected more points|pg||
nt|mikeirl: need good card reading here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcomyn: fun here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: late chance for ireland to reduce arrears|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  a club continuation will hold this to nine tricks, as spades are 4-2|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps a takeout double of 2@s by Yvonne is a better way to get her hand across|pg||
nt|paulg:  then she would not feel obliged to bid over 3@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i dont understand why they do not play in their 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  because they need 11 tricks for game in that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this major mania is killing our game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I didnt say anything a\bout a game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and in any case nobody is doubling 5d|pg||
nt|petepunt: same lead N would find aginst 6|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lark20: Teams means Games|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, but would have had more chances. I was a bit durprised N did not name the @s.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|simonr: A 27 point part score hand!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this may take a little time but eventually that Q of clubs will bring a smile to Dinah Caplan|pg||
nt|benjy: Was this lie obvious?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: maybe i am anold fuddy duddy wanting to play in a 5-4 fit|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Even if it is obvious for her that South does not have 4@s showing @s control would be important for a 3nt.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  so declarer never lost control of trumps|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But I doubt it.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|greerm: 2 off |pg||
pc|s8|nt|kemperg: small to the jack was an option|pg||

nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, John Comyn and Beryl Campbell, for their peceptive comments and to all the kibitzers for the assistance.|pg||
nt|paulg:  We will be back in about 35 minutes for the second half of this match.|pg||
nt|paulg:  another pretty tough hand for EW to deal with|pg||
nt|kemperg: clubs 33 worked both ways|pg||
nt|odysseus69: you are  right Ben- /i was talking rubbish - the danger of seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: back at table|pg||
nt|petepunt: CBAI 24 imps own to NIBU|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but the lack of values and misfit will probably steer them to 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless South wanders in?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 27,  the 6 nt played from the other side in OR,  -1 |pg||
nt|kjadams: weak NT in this position.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 4@H needs care here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: tx paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  they might bid game here|pg||
nt|simonr: I suspect a weak NT from South and an invite from North via a transfer. South should accept with AJx support and two aces |pg||
nt|chick: yes, from the other side, but the play went similiarly, and East pitched 2 hearts and saved her 4 clubs!|pg||
nt|simonx:  Is Dianh, at 78, is the oldest ever English player in the Lady Milne?  Almost certainly the oldest debutante|pg||
nt|mamos: down?|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes|pg||
nt|petepunt: scot about 7 up v England|pg||
nt|mamos: I like 2@d here |pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: there's an acol type Fred?|pg||
nt|greerm: weak NT|pg||
nt|benjy: In fact if south is known to have 7@D and 2@H then the only time it is right to play the way she did was when south had Q10 doubleton of @Cs she definitely misplayed that in my ...|pg||
nt|benjy: opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|lark20: Thank you Paul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: finn is thanking her lucky stars|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@H may be a 33 card suit sometimes on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes  but might be easier on a @D lead? |pg||
nt|sybarra: is 3 nt better?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: don't see why, won the diamond, took the spade finesse, and cashed all spades and diamonds, essentially the same as here|pg||
nt|kemperg: but she was lucky|pg||
nt|benjy: what is a jump in the 4th suit fro you guys?|pg||
nt|benjy: for me it is 55 forcing|pg||
nt|kemperg: isn't that a 55?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: I think the clue is no ht lead |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  and probably needs a club lead to let it through|pg||
nt|petepunt: Y,  most play 2N as 19-21 or so.  Balancing in 4th|pg||
nt|mamos: so you can bid 3@c next time :0|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lark20: With such a poor suit it was a good disciplined pass by South|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest I'd have bid 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: the other room might see a 3@H overcall...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it was paul who thought she might i knew she wouldnt |pg||
nt|kemperg: you are faster than me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: for me its 5-5 at the 3 level - for others a splinter - but here just natural forcing|pg||
nt|benjy: I don't understand why south doesn't bid 3@H over 3@C why rebid that @D suit!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petepunt: will be forced into guesing @C right so 9 tricks (maybe10)|pg||
nt|petepunt: both can make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kjadams: 3N should make with no difficulty. |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcomyn: her mixed partner would have her guts for garters, so she didnt|pg||
nt|lark20: I would probably have bid 2@H as well and then been disappointed when my partner led the suit:)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: count on the @D early |pg||
nt|sybarra: count on the hand actually |pg||
nt|benjy: A thourougly unconvincing auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: giving opportunity to bid 3@H with 6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: she has excellent diamonds - if she plays poker|pg||
nt|petepunt: AC best|pg||
nt|petepunt: just a lot to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: "can" is the operative word |pg||
nt|petepunt: need to intra finesse @H|pg||
nt|petepunt: and get to dummy ?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: royal flush?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|baldfriede: She will probably misguess Q@s.|pg||
nt|simonr: Might go down if declarer gets trumps wrong - should play to ruff a diamond so E/W might help with trumps|pg||
nt|petepunt: great lead by the way|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: what if she ducked that spade?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petepunt: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not saying that is easy to do |pg||
pc|s4|pc|h3|nt|paulg:  the double club finesse is liz's only chance of making this|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|benjy: ANother 11 imps to ENG when NI went for 1100 against a making game on board 12|pg||
nt|petepunt: then they continue @S|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|hJ|nt|petepunt: glad i am up here :) and not at table|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petepunt: hope she has seen 8@H|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|petepunt: :(|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|petepunt: N just happy to see the @C break!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg:  in the other room Punch plays sound 2-level overcalls, so more likely to be 3@H|pg||
nt|baldfriede: That lost 3nt was costly for Ireland.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|greerm: more awkward to get the trump finesse right now, probably no overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: thinking..|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|benjy: Caplan played her pd to hold AQJ10 of @Ds, the only holding to beat game, but she might have led from that holding|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lark20: It would seem the only way to play it|pg||
nt|paulg:  but needed to do it immediately and not draw both trumps|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|benjy: Strange defence, surely she knew the @S count?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|greerm: keep it simple s.... :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yep.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h9|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulg:  thanks all, back in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|lark20: As you so rightly  say|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: thnx all...|pg||
mc|9|nt|petepunt: i think she needed to play a @S rather than A@H and then ruff a winning !G at some stage,  will be writing hand up|pg||
nt|petepunt: winning @C|pg||

nt|larrymori: slam on a @h guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sorry all, I must go. Enjoy the last couple of hands  |pg||
nt|mamos: NS got too high in OR|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petepunt: good hand for the strong NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: i don't think it will be replicated here|pg||
nt|greerm: same start though|pg||
nt|simonr: On track so far!|pg||
nt|larrymori: thx Mikw  c u|pg||
nt|larrymori: Mike|pg||
mb|2C|nt|greerm: west has what I call a middle 2 suiter hand, so some, who play minimax, would not bid the michaels because of that|pg||
nt|simonr: I think West is too good for Micheals at this vul - many play it as weak or strong (not intermediate)|pg||
nt|greerm: snap Simon :)|pg||
nt|simonr: 3@H is probably a good spade raise|pg||
nt|greerm: 3@H clearly a good raise and 4@S will come from S|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 25 ,  they tried 5 @D at the other table,  dbld |pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Will South bid 4 on a minimum? Proably not|pg||
nt|sybarra: -3 |pg||
nt|kjadams: Good result for Ireland in the Open room.   Pushed into 5C, doubled,  Overtrick.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: Hi all|pg||
nt|paulg:  Good evening everyone and welcome to the Lady Milne 2011|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this could be quite a match|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Showing @h support, but how strong can it be?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamond lead needed to beat 4S|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H 1 down on 13, declarer stripped opps to play from the @C Q, well played, 1 down|pg||
nt|petepunt: not the time to upgrade!|pg||
nt|sybarra: W is serverly disappointed |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no and not easy for East to lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: but wait till she sees her pard's hand  |pg||
nt|kjadams: Declarer ran the diamond Q with happy results.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: North will probably press on.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I doubt she will be satisfied with 3nt.|pg||
nt|highshore: and NI are beating Ireland with 2 boards to go!|pg||
mb|4N|nt|benjy: The NI declarer was unlucky to go down in 4@H on Board 13, 12 more to ENG|pg||
nt|petepunt: Americans Lead KH, Europeans 7@H and the italians 'the right @H'|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: Sandie shows her second suit, presuming the 3@H dbl requested that?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jcomyn: a very experienced scottish pair against the irish playing only 2nd time, but anna has been having a greast season at home|pg||
nt|petepunt: which is a @C here|pg||
nt|petepunt: need to leave now thx shirly and specs.  hope 2b  back for final stanza|pg||
nt|eamongall: Looks like Lady Milne heading back to England|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  in the other matches, Northern Ireland are leading NIBU (NI  2) by 10 imps and England lead Wales by 19 imps|pg||
nt|greerm: tempting now for Laura|pg||
nt|simonr: The double may just have shown @hs|pg||
nt|greerm: and the 4@C showed the extars we discussed earlier|pg||
nt|greerm: with @C|pg||
nt|mamos: Wales will lose quite a few imps on this board without doing much wrong |pg||
mb|5H|nt|greerm: well done to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: can she make this with the friendly @D layout?|pg||
nt|greerm: every card right actually|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@S would have been a cheap save vul against non if you could avoid two diamond losers - which is unlikely|pg||
nt|greerm: right for declarer that is|pg||
nt|simonr: Not sure why Wales went 2 off in the other room?|pg||
mb|5N|nt|paulg:  Although Punch and McGowan are very experienced players, this is their first major event together|pg||
nt|jcomyn: she has won two of the major pairs titles|pg||
nt|jcomyn: setting down an early marker by mary lindopp|pg||
nt|lark20: This is Punch and McGowans first Lady Milne playing together|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: some thought from Punch ...|pg||
nt|larrymori: 3@s would have been better then cue cue slam|pg||
nt|simonx:  I agree ... I think 4@s should be weaker|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: getting this played by South in 2NT was very bada s it happened  cos West knew which Heart to lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: might disc 2@D on the @S|pg||
nt|greerm: yes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: declarer has to duck but ??? - well done|pg||
nt|kemperg: take 2nd @D and play @H to the king|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 5-2 fits are popular around here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: state of the match i daresay|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good spot|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will need some gueessing to make.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  Punch probably wondering whether to redouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that helps a little|pg||
nt|kjadams: undo|pg||
nt|kjadams: guessing S bid 3H.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|greerm: didn't realise that the @D so good|pg||
nt|simonr: Going down now - need to ruff the opening lead|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: I don't think so :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: knowing s may have 3 spade tricks what do you do|pg||
nt|paulg:  there are lots of variables in the Lady Milne and trying to compute the 'state of the match' is never easy|pg||
nt|kjadams: NS will be sad when they see they spades come in for 1 loser but happy with comparison.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|odysseus69: may have been a clue by the tempo of the opening lead|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eamongall: one good and unlikely @SK guess|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|paulg:  might be tempted to lead a small spade here|pg||
nt|benjy: Declarer has done well to get this right, but is the correct line clear?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  Hope that it is the same in the other room|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|simonr: Still 6 IMPs to NIBU|pg||
nt|greerm: always difficult to read that every card lies right|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: thx Peter |pg||
nt|eamongall: one advantage of being 6 feet 9 inches tall|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|paulg:  we can see that there are some winning lines, but likely to lead a spade to the queen|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|baldfriede: Who is that tall?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good job no spade honour in w hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: for ireland that is|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW a little unlucky, in that they have found a fair contract ... if you had jumped to 4@h as West it would be worse but escape the double|pg||
nt|jcomyn: fair - i think it a super contract but.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: last chance saloon and she blew it|pg||
nt|paulg:  but can still make this by finessing the spade on the way back|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: playing for hts 3/3 |pg||
pc|s2|pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  but no longer|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|vugraphzbb: they're playing board 29 now...a new 29 as the hands from 29 appeared as board 28...|pg||
nt|simonx:  Two more boards to go?  Number 32 and the slam that we skipped over?|pg||
nt|larrymori: ok thx|pg||
nt|simonx:  So they are playing a deal that we don't have on the computer? |pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: no...sry...NS playing 3NT if you're interested :)|pg||
nt|simonx:  That's fine, Larry has a great set of jokes he can share with us.  Take it away, Larry|pg||
nt|larrymori: lol, I will do it in Japanese|pg||
nt|larrymori: everybody speaks Japanese right?|pg||
nt|simonx:  I have always been confused by lol.  It meant Little Old Lady when I was learning to play bridge.|pg||
nt|larrymori: it sure did|pg||
nt|larrymori: a bridge term for sure|pg||
nt|simonx:  Now little old ladies play bridge for England and I am accused of being sexist.|pg||
nt|larrymori: cuz not many young people are playing unfortunately|pg||
nt|larrymori: people should laugh, it is a healthful thing |pg||
nt|larrymori: reduces stress|pg||
nt|simonx:  There are strict rules about sexist language in Europe, but they don't apply to England.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: ok...on to board 32 now|pg||

nt|simonx:  ... so this is the last board of the match.  Engalnd are exactly on the 101 IMP boudary for a maximum maximum victory in VPs|pg||
nt|larrymori: west might X here|pg||
nt|mamos: Ive enjoyed Petewr :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am Friederike Greifswald-Tolleson. Have a nice day.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: simple 4s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|baldfriede: Strange dealing machines, with 32 boards yesterday and 16 today without a slam.|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need to play this for all its worth |pg||
pc|h6|nt|simonr: Saving them all to the last match tomorrow!|pg||
nt|larrymori: east would not like it|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but we expected a bit more from a very experienced pair here weho made some unchraacteristic errorsd|pg||
nt|larrymori: but down 1|pg||
nt|petepunt: N off on @C lead @H switch|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3N that is|pg||
pc|c2|nt|larrymori: unless the @d is ducked|pg||
nt|simonx:  There is a trick in each suit for the defence ... what can go wrong?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: oops...sry|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lark20: Should be the same in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  small heart lead and diamond switch would be inspired against 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  this probably needs a diamond switch too when North gets with the @hK|pg||
nt|kjadams: good lead.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcomyn: K|pg||
nt|benjy: A spec thinks it's right to pass if you deduct a point for Jx, i take that point but yes, but a vul game, J109 look nice and Q10xx looks good, not so clear|pg||
nt|benjy: I wouldn't crime anyone for inviting, i think it's close|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand plays nicely with esp. with hts 3/3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|chick: it may go badly if N has to ruff with a heart honor|pg||
nt|sybarra: only has to ruff if ace of clubs cashed|pg||
nt|chick: although with the diamonds behaving, will still make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: or tried to cash |pg||
nt|petepunt: Note many would double with East to show 3@H after 2@D but support X's work less well with a weak NT system.|pg||
nt|mamos: this has not worked out well for NS|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1 off prob,  |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|paulg:  just going to play for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but costs nothing to play k and finesse in s|pg||
nt|simonx:  How soon will South play a diamond?|pg||
nt|larrymori: might have tried a red suit first with the spade as an entry|pg||
nt|mamos: ty bye|pg||
nt|petepunt: bye tx mike|pg||
nt|baldfriede: And it looks as if Northern Ireland beat Ireland by 1 IMP indeed, to the great dismay of my wife.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Who is Irish on her mother's side.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|baldfriede: Thank yxou to all who made this vugraph possible, the organizers of the tournament, our excellent operator and of course the indefatigable Roland Wald|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|larrymori: trick 3 was the time|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|benjy: Thanks everyone, particularly to Victor and Germ, but also to our Vugraph operator and to the helpful specs!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: still probably right to take no chances|pg||
nt|benjy: Well played to the English Ladies|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: this was sort of an "all in" bid (as in poker) |pg||
nt|eamongall: no no ... there is 20 imps more to ireland in real score from boards 17-20 |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D back best defense|pg||
mc|11|nt|baldfriede: Oh, ok.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I take back what I said then.|pg||
