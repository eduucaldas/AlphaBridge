mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|greerm: I think that is 19-20/21 2NT opening|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|greerm: very difficult, but not impossible, to bid a @C slam now|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|greerm: anyone know these bids?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|greerm: 3@C clearly puppet, but 3@H then usually shows 4@S so I'm not sure|pg||

nt|jcomyn: yoops|pg||

nt|paulg:  EW will be sacrificing on this hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but nthere is here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Of course Yvonne will have been on vugraph a few times before, as Scotland vs England is often shown from the Peggy Bayer (U20) match|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also from the Junior Europeans|pg||
nt|odysseus69: slam time|pg||
nt|kemperg: this is interesting|pg||
nt|simonx:  Known as  Biltcliffe Coup to some ... reopen a aprtscore and then they make game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, no, no - you have to double the game as well|pg||
nt|simonx:  ... and some say you have to double AND misdefend|pg||
nt|mamos: took me a while to find the right room|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbt: DHAMPUR SUGER 109 , R L KAJRIWAL 112, a BAGARIA 82|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well should nagainst vul opposition|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that was a good save against 4@H |pg||
nt|benjy: Looks like 6@D/@C is a make |pg||
mb|1N|nt|odysseus69: 1c-1d-3d and they will bid it smoothly|pg||
nt|petepunt: its the one with the blue&red door :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbt: MMRMC 102,   BIMAL SIKKA 86|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hefty 3s|pg||
nt|paulg:  although that opening would put most off|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1c -1d-2d and???|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that board probably flat - a more, how can we put it, appreciative auction should get to 4@h anyway  |pg||
nt|mamos: ty|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@D save is tough to reach|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: probably not biddable |pg||
nt|odysseus69: key moment|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: will see if the other room gets into the bidding (last hand) |pg||
nt|petepunt: many would open the East hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: I think south should bid 3@D and then north 3@H|pg||
nt|kemperg: now its on|pg||
nt|benjy: What is south going to do over that?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to get there now and I agree about 3D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: best she can do|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: W made of sterner stuff :)|pg||
nt|larrymori: it would be something to reach 4@s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbb: South thinking...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6 loser hand yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: when goes 4 @H  E might bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: guess not|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbt: BANEET 93,    MMSNEHA  86|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont be tested but ew will be in the open room|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@S to keep 3NT in the game? Remember South doesn't know that partner has a slam try yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Liz has a big hand opposite a 4@d overcall, but few tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: perhaps thinking she should have opened 4...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch did will to pave the way for a sacrifice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: irish pair very aggressive bidders in there|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@H could just be looking for 3NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: undo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c fourth suit. Not normally game-forcing by a passed hand|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@d now?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: so probably 2@h form North, and then South will have to take a view|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: NS fit very well|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|chick: anyone like the X of 2@C?  I'm not sure I'd want a club lead (even if S were on lead)|pg||
nt|benjy: Wow 3NT is a huge underbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S would be a good description |pg||
nt|petepunt: s has done well here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: 3nt is pusillanimous from North - confident that English pair will bid this|pg||
nt|kemperg: not good:((|pg||
nt|benjy: South has a minimum 3@D bid and slam is cold, 3NT is also a terrible spot, if the @SQ loses you go down in 3NT when you make 6@D|pg||
nt|larrymori: 2@s with the good @ss would have been worth a try|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but South has passed - not unreasonable|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 nt was an option also |pg||
nt|sybarra: (for minors) |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lark20: I thought Yvonne would have bid 3H here|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess that they don't play checkback, as you might invite with the West hand|pg||
nt|mamos: those Aces are worth a lot|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzbb: a rather stingy 9@C...|pg||
nt|petepunt: its 'the fit' that makes this good|pg||
pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: from Norths positon a grand was close than 3NT |pg||
pc|c8|nt|yo_yo: i dont mind it, sometimes keeps them out of 3NT ( which is sometimes good - or bad)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now dangerous to finesse trumps|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may make the play of hts different |pg||
nt|sybarra: like cashing of AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes bash them out and get a nice surprise|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petepunt: if S had long @C they would subside in 2@D so I like the auction|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|paulg:  again, it is non-vulnerable so the rewards are not so great|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Rory Timlin|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and patsy meehan is west in the open room and will be in 4h|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh dear now it's down|pg||
nt|kemperg: can't believe that 3NT from N|pg||
pc|h9|nt|benjy: North had a slam drive|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to John Adams|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d2|nt|kjadams: Hello|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: and not -2 |pg||
nt|mamos: easy game :)   well done|pg||
pc|s7|nt|benjy: Hopefully this will be a slam swing for England, time will tell|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: *now |pg||
nt|simonx:  For the non-English - Dinah Caplan is 78 years old.  She and Lizzie Godfrey were the surprise at the trials.  They led most of the way and won handsomely|pg||

nt|paulg:  Lindopp may upgrade to 1NT?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but makin it is another question|pg||
nt|lark20: if you can't make it don't bid it|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe E was afraid she would push them to slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: simple 3N here|pg||
nt|mikeirl: save in 6h here?|pg||
nt|kjadams: wild hand here.  e/w have slm in two strains  (clubs from west) and NS have very cheap save|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|jcomyn: not like our open pair to sell out|pg||
nt|lark20: very disciplined|pg||
nt|petepunt: never easy to bid with queen high suits when partner overcalls your singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: right |pg||
nt|sybarra: it was more like I was talking to myself, not criticizing certainly |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N!|nt|golfsquash: Hi JC and all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi rory|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not quite for 4S|pg||
nt|petepunt: after a short @C common to !X without 4@S and bid with 4_@S.  although...|pg||
nt|mikeirl: ghestem or michaels would make save easier to find|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kjadams: with 6-6, I have a rule...  either I play it, or I play it doubled.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|paulg:  this is why I would have upgraded, it justs feel too good for a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|paulg:  I am told that EW play weak jump shifts and checkback, so 2@h was mildly invitational|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Will the Irish bid and make the tight game this time?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doubt it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too many holes in the side suits|pg||
nt|golfsquash: It is getting more thought this time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and hard to see how n can fill those holes|pg||
nt|lark20: With 8 points and albeit a 6-card suit, game does not seem likely opposite a 12-14  hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: some now play 1@S is less than 4 and X is 4+  |pg||
nt|kjadams: hearts might not even get mentioned at this rate.   6S could go down 2 on heart ruff, but will not be found.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: west "saving?"|pg||
mb|d|nt|petepunt: We feature Wales and NI's top pairs at this table though N/S both have Camrose open experience too.|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4H is a bit of a bid!|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  of course 3NT is not cold|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bunch of taps in hts and this contract can get dicey |pg||
nt|benjy: Now this is a decent game|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not see how this makes |pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: easy double dummy but not a make in prctice- conservative choice and luckily avoiding good but failing game|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: looks like a simple one, losing 2@H only|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very passive lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzbb: sry...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: A  coffee board; +1.|pg||
nt|petepunt: good save against 4@S here :)|pg||

pc|c2|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: yes indeed |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  West will have to find a number of discards here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: or more that one tap that is |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|golfsquash: trying to induce a trump switch|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petepunt: surprised Greenwood didn't show her @S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lark20: @H10 is not a standard lead in their system|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s never got the spade suit into auction |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|paulg:  @h10 is their standard lead from AJ10 in notrump|pg||

nt|jcomyn: w has the hand i always pick up opposite a strong bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: hook on @H|pg||
nt|benjy: @H finesse or @h 3-3 on a @H lead|pg||
nt|benjy: but there are lots of other chances too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm - last trick with the @d7|pg||
nt|larrymori: hand was good too|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1st potential slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: Current rankings -- based on first three matches and half-time scores in current matches at  http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: a second trump takes out the entry|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|greerm: if 1@C can be 2, it's difficult to bid 3 east|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure if the Irish captain  will allow a beer at the table. Afterwards, perhaps |pg||
nt|larrymori: at these colors and not such a good suit 2@s is suspect at best|pg||
nt|larrymori: the bid takes them out of their best suit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|baldfriede: East does not like this double at all.|pg||
nt|greerm: West not about to defend 2@D|pg||
nt|greerm: Norma F will now bid 3@C |pg||
nt|petepunt: Opening bid is intersting|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: Norht goes for it - might as well, at 60-odd down|pg||
nt|petepunt: playing 5 card majors with 15-18 and 4144 shape, i advise 1D rather than 1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: now whast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a rarity - 26pts and no bids|pg||
nt|benjy: Normal 4@S here making 11|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and could  get 800 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: looks like 800 if they get their @C tricks in...|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think now you ask for a few undos and bid 1N on the first round |pg||
nt|greerm: and there it will rest I think|pg||
nt|petepunt: simplifies your rebid |pg||
nt|mamos: looks like ns  will bid this|pg||
nt|petepunt: on their way|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jcomyn: what is 2h anyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h will be a double negative|pg||
nt|lark20: 2@H is neg|pg||
nt|baldfriede: And it will probably go down 1.|pg||
mb|d|nt|petepunt: prefe 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: kelly puts the ball back into Ferguson's court|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a routine spade game and a chance for a cuppa- brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 4@C in W better, |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: surely must balasnce with s hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doesnt look sound to me|pg||
nt|greerm: i think 2, 3@C 1@H and 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Ferguson has a Nepal flag, operator; could be a mistake :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4 could easily go down, finessing in trumps|pg||
nt|kemperg: max with fit|pg||
nt|mamos: yes  South may be worried about D control now  knowes 4@h is second round|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg:  well, i think she does have a double negative, perhaps a triple negative|pg||
nt|lark20: 2@H is "less than a Q"|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I know Nepal and Northern Ireland are close to each other on the scroll bar|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont see any flag|pg||
nt|petepunt: After 3@S South is minimum for a "serious 3N"  showing slam interest and demanding lowes cue bid|pg||
pc|d7|nt|greerm: 2 off that is|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh yes  on a different tab|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk7: People who use the old Win version can|pg||
nt|sybarra: click on the little cards on the bottom|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kjadams: club lead would have beat 4S.   I dislike 500 point saves with those odds.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  whatever you do I think you have missed game|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: :(|pg||
nt|petepunt: not the first time wie will predict wong 2day :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: hornswoggled|pg||
nt|kemperg: leads also to 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: but surely 1nt by s on this auction is hardly balanced 16- hcp|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway i am not defending 1s|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will eventually play ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens this seems to be one of those times when partner does have eight tricks in notrump|pg||
nt|golfsquash: She will lose 4 trumps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and you end up in a very shaky contract - to put it mildly|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it is natural play to finesse the ht |pg||
nt|sybarra: claim coming up |pg||
pc|c3|nt|odysseus69: yes - having bid only 2S which limits the quality the West hand worth a cue which would be of no interest to East here|pg||
nt|larrymori: it was better leading from the honor|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Uh-oh.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: N's failure to bid 4@d looks the culprit to me |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: i am well aware of it|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: another part score |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|jcomyn: 5s-4card minor|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must say i dont like it|pg||
nt|simonx:  Thanks for the replay, Stephen ... it was like watching the film Memento|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|paulg:  the 4-card minor will prevent Punch from considering a save|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this 1st in hand could be crucified|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will be a 1nt. Not much action so far yet.|pg||
nt|chick: it really hurts to bid 2@H with the S hand, knowing you are probably in a bad spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 18 they played 4 @H from the other side in OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi,  and Wennell is positive which suit it is  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: aces do tempt me|pg||
mb|d|mb|3N|nt|odysseus69: j of diamonds works well|pg||
nt|benjy: Some might bid 3@C with the south cards|pg||
nt|simonx:  the one that goes backwards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: what??? - with 5-3 s fit and 2h and 2h|pg||
nt|baldfriede: And it should go down 1, Cards sit wrong for declarer.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @H is the "relay" response  (pass or correct) |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  I agree, it is not a good opener at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes thats Y ciara tried 4N and sold out.  it is easy for us to oversimplyfy i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: But that wouldn't get a @C lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: best start:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|greerm: another difficult play hand for Sandie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as commented, good case for a club lead - you have an honour, and hopefully can set some tricks up - heart lead needs a good holding from partner|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2N = 19-20 balanced,  3C puppet stayman.|pg||

pc|c9|nt|benjy: Would you bid 3@C guys?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes 9 top tricks|pg||

nt|kjadams: struggling to see  9 without def error.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5 diamonds, and 3 other aces.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|golfsquash: even 2@s can be beaten|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you don't have a guaranteed 5-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|kemperg: no not as invite and not as slamtry|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|sybarra: this hand will not go well for declarer...(might be an understatement) |pg||

nt|sybarra: real question is do you want to be there?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: that would be my cup of tea|pg||
nt|simonx:  The way the VP scale goes, England are capped when the score gets to 25-5, but the Northern Ireland score carries on down to 25-0, so they still have something to play for.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|jcomyn: my money is on irish to bid 4s|pg||
nt|paulg:  although Punch and McGowan are still settling into their partnership, they are both quite resilient and will not let bad results get them down|pg||

nt|greerm: millership|pg||
nt|chick: by playing the way she did, she had to guess whether E's 3rd card was heart or diamond|pg||
nt|benjy: On the last hand North knew that West had 10 red cards from the bidding so after the two top @Ss the A@C was perfectly safe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual |pg||
nt|petepunt: 6N by East,  but any slam will do|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|simonx:  Right, weak on weak ... I thought that was a no-no |pg||
mb|p|nt|lark20: It is a stronger hand than I would have expected from Punch|pg||

mb|4H|nt|baldfriede: What do the initials stand for anyway? I am not that familiar with these players.|pg||
nt|simonr: Not enough characters in BBO to put the full name and initials!|pg||
nt|simonr: Sue and Laura for Wales|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ....would want to be there |pg||
nt|kjadams: board 1, their teammates navigated a tough 6N, and board 4 did not take phantom 500 point save.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  a fairly easy hand as declarer has no real option except to finesse the club|pg||
nt|greerm: I always look for a way to make 12 tricks on these type of hands, can't see any here|pg||
nt|simonr: Neither can GIB!|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 3NT is the spot and they should get there - 1D -1S -1NT and a move from South|pg||

nt|larrymori: keeps them out altogether|pg||
mb|3N|nt|paulg:  maybe McGowan/Punch overcall any 5-card major?|pg||

mb|p|nt|greerm: ah, we got Laura's name corrected, South next?|pg||

nt|greerm: operator was changing the spelling for us :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  naturally you run to your other major|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|paulg:  if the South hand is interested in slam then it should be bidding suits and not notrumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I prefer 2NT to 3D - maybe they play a wide ranging 1NT rebid- used to be popular 20 years ago|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|benjy: Yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: What was W thinking?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the problem with 3D is that South faces some difficult problems - usually 2C is available as an enquiry which allows a 3D rebid|pg||
nt|benjy: The 10 was right on all layouts, declarer could not have 3 small @Hs as they would have called for the Q|pg||
nt|kemperg: evidently|pg||
pc|c4|nt|benjy: She still could have recovered by not playing the K@H on the 10@H|pg||

nt|mamos: but with one leap they are free :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|odysseus69: surprisingly South chose 2C when most including me would be bidding hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  a spade lead may not seem so obvious to McQuaker|pg||

nt|benjy: Am i seeing this right?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It's pretty close to QPR's goal difference this season though :)|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinking about Slam ?|pg||

nt|paulg:  and you only have three spades and a club anyhow|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: oh well should have known what onishuk would do|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: actually looking,  doesnt seem to matter which side|pg||

mb|p|nt|lark20: Still no score for East West|pg||

mb|3D|nt|paulg:  i expect the same auction in the other room to this point, now a question of evaluating the East hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think South should rebid 2@c|pg||
nt|paulg:  and make the tough decision on the next round|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No inverted minors.|pg||
nt|greerm: nor a 5 card major, so not the same need to show the @H now|pg||
nt|jferg: hi greer|pg||
nt|benjy: On board 9 Sally Brock chose to rebid 2@C instead of 3NT/3@D a call that i quite like and we didn't even mention!|pg||
nt|larrymori: except that if pard has @c cards it is still good, as it is, 6@h can make|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 2@S looked like a aingleton in E|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D was multi (weak in one major) |pg||
nt|petepunt: another 6@D , not great tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for results and standings after 2 rounds|pg||

nt|lark20: Bad diamond break too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks like 3nt and a prayer|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course 3@h sounds like a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|paulg:  but you are close and you have the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|simonr: Staying low - should make nine tricks here unless East leads a @C|pg||
nt|kjadams: this one too hard.   e/w actions very understandable.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jferg: fight back under way|pg||

nt|chick: Now E just has to manage not to pitch a club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surely North is FAR too good for a direct 4@h|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3n also makes of course|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  perhaps being non-vulnerable was important |pg||
nt|paulg:  games need to be 50% to be worth bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: i think so...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you would be amazed at the number of players whon regard 2c as a WEAK bid and have to jumpm - crazy as it seems|pg||
nt|lark20: 2@C just may not be forcing in their system|pg||
nt|larrymori: for sure|pg||
nt|petepunt: although 6D maybe better than 3N as both need @C right|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c is not forcing in my system, but I don't expect to miss game with a singleton heart if partner passes|pg||

pc|s9|nt|greerm: Norma Franklin has now found her parters K 3 times in a row|pg||

pc|sK|nt|paulg:  less happy after that lead of course, but it will improve/get worse depending on how you look at it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder what n would have led against 3nt|pg||
pc|s5|nt|simonr: If their style with amjor/minor is to open the minor as Laura has done I am surprised that Sue did not bid 1@H|pg||
nt|greerm: on opening lead|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|larrymori: it was 2 or 3 @s|pg||

nt|sybarra: qx of hts might slow her down |pg||
mb|4C|nt|benjy: For me 4@C would show @S support|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2 key times to think in card play a) when dummy goes down b) when you first gain the lead as defender|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@C stands out for now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|greerm: East likes that:)|pg||
nt|simonr: North might try 3@C - showing values if they have a Lebensohl option|pg||
nt|petepunt: ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: skinny but 2 majorsd makes it decent ernough|pg||
nt|benjy: how can you pass and introduce your own suit in a competitive auction at the 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: but Sandie may go again|pg||
nt|greerm: nope|pg||
nt|sybarra: in tempo raise to 3 nt or the sham of stayman?|pg||
nt|benjy: and why did north pass 4@C instead of Xbling?|pg||
nt|sybarra: was that a help suit try? |pg||
mb|5C|nt|greerm: leading from shortage not always recommended with long trump|pg||
nt|chick: but you know what ... unless W has a heart honor, 6N is cold, so baring the @HJ can't hurt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 13 tricks maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  10 is my bet|pg||
nt|sybarra: or sort of a zia cue?|pg||

mb|d|nt|petepunt: Zia would follow thrue with 4N :) after psychic trial bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: lol:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: puppet stayman is not a sham when you have a 3 card major and a singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: If east wins and plays a low @H then declarer has to guess the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: true cornelia |pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|petepunt: we see this is easy but Ciara will have many worries here :)|pg||

nt|greerm: I love these big hands with no obvious bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: and he was the fastest player ever?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|greerm: for those of us who don't play strong @C that is|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT cold as cards lie  who says you need stops|pg||
nt|petepunt: thats Y I open 1N with nrth Di has a tough bid now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and bd 19 will stand out in their mind :(|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulg:  if I were npc I might suggest that they slow down a little|pg||
nt|petepunt: then thts Y I'm called PetethePunt:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|simonr: Treating it as a GF in @H or 23+ balanced|pg||
nt|chick: NS playing Weak NT, so 1N now shows 15-17|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S might prefer to play in clubs |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but she doesnt know N clubs are as good as they are|pg||
nt|mamos: oops 3@s  looks like an accident happening|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go again close to slam |pg||
nt|petepunt: @D lead look nasty|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: thats enough|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@H or X guys?|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5D makes too though!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: do we know 2NT?|pg||
nt|petepunt: expect @C lead though|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: GF in @H - partner will exepct a better suit! But if you bid 2NT partner is not expecting a singleton|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H for me|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H or a coward pass|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: ENOUGH ena|pg||
nt|greerm: not everybody's choice the 4@H but a difficult hand to bid|pg||
pc|dT|nt|greerm: @C leads best |pg||
nt|simonr: No entry to table for the spades so will drift a couple off|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Communication problems for declarer.|pg||
nt|sybarra: that would be nice :) |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  Surprised South did not continue with 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: seems better than 3@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a very good game missed|pg||
nt|lark20: 3@D would have been more helpful|pg||
nt|paulg:  over 3@d North would have a tough decision|pg||
nt|paulg:  easy to pass 3@s with no controls to speak of|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|paulg:  and only three points in partner's suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: the brakes are screeching |pg||
nt|petepunt: this WAS a hand for a Zia 4@D cue by West |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|petepunt: lower2suit I suspect West expected more points|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcomyn: fun here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: late chance for ireland to reduce arrears|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  a club continuation will hold this to nine tricks, as spades are 4-2|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps a takeout double of 2@s by Yvonne is a better way to get her hand across|pg||
nt|paulg:  then she would not feel obliged to bid over 3@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i dont understand why they do not play in their 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  because they need 11 tricks for game in that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this major mania is killing our game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I didnt say anything a\bout a game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and in any case nobody is doubling 5d|pg||
nt|petepunt: same lead N would find aginst 6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|lark20: Teams means Games|pg||
nt|greerm: I think 3NT would go off too on careful defence|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|vugraphzbb: short break....|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg:  Maida and Sheila, playing NS in the other room, just continue on their merry way bidding game after game|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|simonr: Fortunately @D are 3-3 but still no way of making|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|paulg:  the club was indeed led but not returned in the other room|pg||
pc|s9|nt|baldfriede: Yes, but would have had more chances. I was a bit durprised N did not name the @s.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|simonr: A 27 point part score hand!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this may take a little time but eventually that Q of clubs will bring a smile to Dinah Caplan|pg||
nt|benjy: Was this lie obvious?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe i am anold fuddy duddy wanting to play in a 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|greerm: no T?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|baldfriede: Even if it is obvious for her that South does not have 4@s showing @s control would be important for a 3nt.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg:  so declarer never lost control of trumps|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  i think so John :)|pg||
nt|greerm: 2 off |pg||
pc|d6|nt|kemperg: small to the jack was an option|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can be elegant now - discarding a spade on the diamond king|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg:  the Irish here have minimised the loss by staying out of it|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|benjy: if you thought north had the Q of @C and the A@S then wouldn't you have to lead up to the @CJ?|pg||

nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, John Comyn and Beryl Campbell, for their peceptive comments and to all the kibitzers for the assistance.|pg||
nt|paulg:  We will be back in about 35 minutes for the second half of this match.|pg||
nt|paulg:  another pretty tough hand for EW to deal with|pg||
nt|kemperg: clubs 33 worked both ways|pg||
nt|odysseus69: you are  right Ben- /i was talking rubbish - the danger of seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: back at table|pg||
nt|petepunt: CBAI 24 imps own to NIBU|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg:  but the lack of values and misfit will probably steer them to 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless South wanders in?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 27,  the 6 nt played from the other side in OR,  -1 |pg||
nt|kjadams: weak NT in this position.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 4@H needs care here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: tx paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  they might bid game here|pg||
nt|simonr: I suspect a weak NT from South and an invite from North via a transfer. South should accept with AJx support and two aces |pg||
nt|chick: yes, from the other side, but the play went similiarly, and East pitched 2 hearts and saved her 4 clubs!|pg||
nt|simonx:  Is Dianh, at 78, is the oldest ever English player in the Lady Milne?  Almost certainly the oldest debutante|pg||
nt|mamos: down?|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes|pg||
nt|petepunt: scot about 7 up v England|pg||
nt|mamos: I like 2@d here |pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|greerm: there's an acol type Fred?|pg||
nt|greerm: weak NT|pg||
nt|benjy: In fact if south is known to have 7@D and 2@H then the only time it is right to play the way she did was when south had Q10 doubleton of @Cs she definitely misplayed that in my ...|pg||
nt|benjy: opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|lark20: Thank you Paul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: finn is thanking her lucky stars|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@H may be a 33 card suit sometimes on this auction|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: yes  but might be easier on a @D lead? |pg||
nt|sybarra: is 3 nt better?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: don't see why, won the diamond, took the spade finesse, and cashed all spades and diamonds, essentially the same as here|pg||
nt|kemperg: but she was lucky|pg||
nt|benjy: what is a jump in the 4th suit fro you guys?|pg||
nt|benjy: for me it is 55 forcing|pg||
nt|kemperg: isn't that a 55?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think the clue is no ht lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and probably needs a club lead to let it through|pg||
nt|petepunt: Y,  most play 2N as 19-21 or so.  Balancing in 4th|pg||
nt|mamos: so you can bid 3@c next time :0|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lark20: With such a poor suit it was a good disciplined pass by South|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest I'd have bid 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: the other room might see a 3@H overcall...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it was paul who thought she might i knew she wouldnt |pg||
nt|kemperg: you are faster than me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: for me its 5-5 at the 3 level - for others a splinter - but here just natural forcing|pg||
nt|benjy: I don't understand why south doesn't bid 3@H over 3@C why rebid that @D suit!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petepunt: will be forced into guesing @C right so 9 tricks (maybe10)|pg||
nt|petepunt: both can make|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kjadams: 3N should make with no difficulty. |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: her mixed partner would have her guts for garters, so she didnt|pg||
nt|lark20: I would probably have bid 2@H as well and then been disappointed when my partner led the suit:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: count on the @D early |pg||
nt|sybarra: count on the hand actually |pg||
nt|benjy: A thourougly unconvincing auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: giving opportunity to bid 3@H with 6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: she has excellent diamonds - if she plays poker|pg||
nt|petepunt: AC best|pg||
nt|petepunt: just a lot to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: "can" is the operative word |pg||
nt|petepunt: need to intra finesse @H|pg||
nt|petepunt: and get to dummy ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kemperg: royal flush?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|baldfriede: She will probably misguess Q@s.|pg||
nt|simonr: Might go down if declarer gets trumps wrong - should play to ruff a diamond so E/W might help with trumps|pg||
nt|petepunt: great lead by the way|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: what if she ducked that spade?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|petepunt: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not saying that is easy to do |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  the double club finesse is liz's only chance of making this|pg||
pc|s5|nt|benjy: ANother 11 imps to ENG when NI went for 1100 against a making game on board 12|pg||
nt|petepunt: then they continue @S|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|petepunt: glad i am up here :) and not at table|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d7|nt|petepunt: hope she has seen 8@H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|petepunt: :(|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petepunt: N just happy to see the @C break!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulg:  in the other room Punch plays sound 2-level overcalls, so more likely to be 3@H|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|greerm: more awkward to get the trump finesse right now, probably no overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: thinking..|pg||
pc|h3|nt|benjy: Caplan played her pd to hold AQJ10 of @Ds, the only holding to beat game, but she might have led from that holding|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lark20: It would seem the only way to play it|pg||
nt|paulg:  but needed to do it immediately and not draw both trumps|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|benjy: Strange defence, surely she knew the @S count?|pg||

nt|larrymori: thx Mikw  c u|pg||
nt|larrymori: Mike|pg||
mb|1H|nt|greerm: west has what I call a middle 2 suiter hand, so some, who play minimax, would not bid the michaels because of that|pg||
nt|simonr: I think West is too good for Micheals at this vul - many play it as weak or strong (not intermediate)|pg||
nt|greerm: snap Simon :)|pg||
nt|simonr: 3@H is probably a good spade raise|pg||
nt|greerm: 3@H clearly a good raise and 4@S will come from S|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 25 ,  they tried 5 @D at the other table,  dbld |pg||
mb|d|nt|simonr: Will South bid 4 on a minimum? Proably not|pg||

nt|vugraphzbb: Hi all|pg||
nt|paulg:  Good evening everyone and welcome to the Lady Milne 2011|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this could be quite a match|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Showing @h support, but how strong can it be?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamond lead needed to beat 4S|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H 1 down on 13, declarer stripped opps to play from the @C Q, well played, 1 down|pg||
nt|petepunt: not the time to upgrade!|pg||
nt|sybarra: W is serverly disappointed |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no and not easy for East to lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: but wait till she sees her pard's hand  |pg||
nt|kjadams: Declarer ran the diamond Q with happy results.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|benjy: The NI declarer was unlucky to go down in 4@H on Board 13, 12 more to ENG|pg||
nt|petepunt: Americans Lead KH, Europeans 7@H and the italians 'the right @H'|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: Sandie shows her second suit, presuming the 3@H dbl requested that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: a very experienced scottish pair against the irish playing only 2nd time, but anna has been having a greast season at home|pg||
nt|petepunt: which is a @C here|pg||
nt|petepunt: need to leave now thx shirly and specs.  hope 2b  back for final stanza|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  in the other matches, Northern Ireland are leading NIBU (NI  2) by 10 imps and England lead Wales by 19 imps|pg||
nt|greerm: tempting now for Laura|pg||
nt|simonr: The double may just have shown @hs|pg||
nt|greerm: and the 4@C showed the extars we discussed earlier|pg||
nt|greerm: with @C|pg||
nt|mamos: Wales will lose quite a few imps on this board without doing much wrong |pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: well done to pass|pg||
mb|3C|nt|greerm: can she make this with the friendly @D layout?|pg||
nt|greerm: every card right actually|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@S would have been a cheap save vul against non if you could avoid two diamond losers - which is unlikely|pg||
nt|greerm: right for declarer that is|pg||
nt|simonr: Not sure why Wales went 2 off in the other room?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|paulg:  Although Punch and McGowan are very experienced players, this is their first major event together|pg||
nt|jcomyn: she has won two of the major pairs titles|pg||
nt|jcomyn: setting down an early marker by mary lindopp|pg||
nt|lark20: This is Punch and McGowans first Lady Milne playing together|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: some thought from Punch ...|pg||
nt|larrymori: 3@s would have been better then cue cue slam|pg||
nt|simonx:  I agree ... I think 4@s should be weaker|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: getting this played by South in 2NT was very bada s it happened  cos West knew which Heart to lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: might disc 2@D on the @S|pg||
nt|greerm: yes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: declarer has to duck but ??? - well done|pg||
nt|kemperg: take 2nd @D and play @H to the king|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 5-2 fits are popular around here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: state of the match i daresay|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good spot|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  Punch probably wondering whether to redouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that helps a little|pg||
nt|kjadams: undo|pg||
nt|kjadams: guessing S bid 3H.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|greerm: didn't realise that the @D so good|pg||
nt|simonr: Going down now - need to ruff the opening lead|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: I don't think so :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: knowing s may have 3 spade tricks what do you do|pg||
nt|paulg:  there are lots of variables in the Lady Milne and trying to compute the 'state of the match' is never easy|pg||
nt|kjadams: NS will be sad when they see they spades come in for 1 loser but happy with comparison.|pg||

nt|paulg:  EW a little unlucky, in that they have found a fair contract ... if you had jumped to 4@h as West it would be worse but escape the double|pg||
nt|jcomyn: fair - i think it a super contract but.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: last chance saloon and she blew it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: Ciara Burns and Mary Finn are partners in other competitions, so this will be keenly contested|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: 4s will be very awkward|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|greerm: looks like 4@S coming up here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|greerm: will require careful management|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: thast blasted 4-1 break rears its ugly head for the millionth time|pg||
nt|greerm: I think going off when declarer starts with the @S A|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: not to mention two finesses wrong|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|greerm: then losing a trick in each suit|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|greerm: now the @C force kills the contract|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but survived the attack|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so far|pg||
nt|greerm: makes double dummy now by getting the trump right, but unlikely|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont think so when 10 asppears|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|greerm: I think @S7 to A now and one down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|greerm: nope|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: diane is canny as u know|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|s7|pc|hT|pg||

nt|paulg:  she did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats not like liz|pg||
nt|paulg:  having played the @s10 I'm very surprised she did not make it|pg||
nt|paulg:  We are on the last board of this match. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Stephen Peterkin, for an excellent job.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, Rory Timlin, John Comyn and Beryl Campbell, for their peceptive comments and to all the kibitzers for the assistance.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Finally, our appreciation to Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and NIBU (Robin Burns) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|paulg:  We start again tomorrow at 10:00 Belfast (11:00 Paris, 04:00 New York, 10:00 Berwick-upon-Tweed).|pg||
nt|jcomyn: some very interesting hands. As we often say it is easy when u see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  actually it is 05:00 in New York, apologies for that|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Last chance for a slam now. Will we have it?|pg||
nt|greerm: nope|pg||
nt|greerm: though maybe |pg||
nt|baldfriede: Would be one with Q@c onside though.|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand for this set |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our brilliant operator  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Cornelia for your time and assistance |pg||
nt|simonx:  Here we have Ladies Trials, but when the team plays outside Britain they are called Women|pg||
nt|petepunt: last hand - see you all at 12:10|pg||
nt|sybarra: nicely done |pg||
nt|sybarra: last bd of this set |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our terrific operator, a job well done |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Peter who had to dash |pg||
nt|sybarra: especially thanks to the specs who offer comments and thoughts. we appreciate them |pg||
nt|kjadams: last board of the set.|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: ...and teh @D behaving!|pg||
nt|greerm: or a @C lead from North :)|pg||
nt|chick: and to you, Shirley :)|pg||
nt|simonx:  OK ... how did we do on the mystery board?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  From a Scottish perspective, a very assured debut for Yvonne Wiseman|pg||
nt|benjy: Another 11 to ENG making this a whitewash|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|paulg:  She'll really be looking forward to the rest of the weekend now|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, nice to work with you Victor and Ben|pg||
nt|benjy: As declarer went down at the other table when on the same lead they rose ace|pg||
nt|benjy: You too Germ|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks to kibs nice comments|pg||
nt|larrymori: generic instead of trying to qualify people |pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: 3NT+1|pg||
nt|mamos: sudden 20 imps to NI  for the last board and the Welsh West error in ducking Spade at Trick 1 in 3\NT|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4S looks like the right spot on the N/S cards, until you see the unfavorable finesses and trump split.|pg||
nt|mikeirl: big comeback|pg||
nt|kjadams: Indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: multi 2d|pg||
nt|greerm: this the last hand here, thanks all, next round starts at 12.10 Norther Ireland time|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@S by North in the other room!!!! I think not. This will mess up the IMP scores|pg||
nt|larrymori: west might try 3@d instead but X is very popular to show cards when stuck and not have 4@h+|pg||
mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: thx all - got to leave now|pg||
nt|benjy: West did well here to pass 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: London follow us btw :)|pg||
nt|benjy: This will be more imps for ENG|pg||
nt|mamos: ty to our op|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs for giving us the helpful info,  also some funny comments :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: undo |pg||
nt|simonx:  ... so this is the last board of the match.  Engalnd are exactly on the 101 IMP boudary for a maximum maximum victory in VPs|pg||
nt|larrymori: west might X here|pg||
nt|mamos: Ive enjoyed Petewr :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: simple 4s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|baldfriede: Strange dealing machines, with 32 boards yesterday and 16 today without a slam.|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need to play this for all its worth |pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Saving them all to the last match tomorrow!|pg||
nt|larrymori: east would not like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yes but we expected a bit more from a very experienced pair here weho made some unchraacteristic errorsd|pg||
nt|larrymori: but down 1|pg||
nt|petepunt: N off on @C lead @H switch|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3N that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: unless the @d is ducked|pg||
nt|simonx:  There is a trick in each suit for the defence ... what can go wrong?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|vugraphzbb: oops...sry|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lark20: Should be the same in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  small heart lead and diamond switch would be inspired against 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  this probably needs a diamond switch too when North gets with the @hK|pg||
nt|kjadams: good lead.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: K|pg||
nt|benjy: A spec thinks it's right to pass if you deduct a point for Jx, i take that point but yes, but a vul game, J109 look nice and Q10xx looks good, not so clear|pg||
nt|benjy: I wouldn't crime anyone for inviting, i think it's close|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|sybarra: this hand plays nicely with esp. with hts 3/3|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|chick: it may go badly if N has to ruff with a heart honor|pg||
nt|sybarra: only has to ruff if ace of clubs cashed|pg||
nt|chick: although with the diamonds behaving, will still make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: or tried to cash |pg||
nt|petepunt: Note many would double with East to show 3@H after 2@D but support X's work less well with a weak NT system.|pg||
nt|mamos: this has not worked out well for NS|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1 off prob,  |pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  just going to play for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but costs nothing to play k and finesse in s|pg||
nt|simonx:  How soon will South play a diamond?|pg||
nt|larrymori: might have tried a red suit first with the spade as an entry|pg||
nt|mamos: ty bye|pg||
nt|petepunt: bye tx mike|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Thank yxou to all who made this vugraph possible, the organizers of the tournament, our excellent operator and of course the indefatigable Roland Wald|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still probably right to take no chances|pg||
nt|benjy: Well played to the English Ladies|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: this was sort of an "all in" bid (as in poker) |pg||
pc|sK|nt|kemperg: @D back best defense|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
