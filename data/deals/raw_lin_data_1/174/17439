nt|cicus: unless E takes this with the ace|pg||

nt|cicus: shall he play @CA small @C?|pg||
nt|ady: how would he play on clubs   ace and another?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: I like A and @C more so that S has Kx and you want him on lead ;) |pg||

nt|patricck: Yes, very true|pg||
pc|hT|nt|shevek: entries might be a problem for declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|patricck: In the other room they failed because they never led a club to the 19 while they were in hand|pg||
nt|patricck: a club to the 10 :)|pg||
nt|shevek: clear cut :)|pg||
nt|patricck: I just made the game a whole lot harder.... 19 cards per suit :)|pg||

nt|cicus: on a major suit lead 4 tricks difference|pg||
nt|roswolf: the die seems cast|pg||
nt|cicus: simply incredible, that 1NT - it would not occur to me even after thinking a week|pg||
nt|roswolf: cometh the hour cometh the man|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 6@h has no play|pg||
nt|andyv:  flannery people (Roland's favorite opening), would have to problem getting to 6@s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kemperg: NS in OR will be pleased with the result|pg||

nt|psyck: rare to see precision players devaluing 1@c hands as 1@c opening allows more gadgets & relays|pg||

nt|patricck: run the 9@H to begin with and then finesse the Q@H the second time|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT bound to be bid e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Second segment is scheduled to start about now, so we are running 20-25 mins late|pg||
nt|shevek: still...|pg||
nt|shevek: doesn't look like a good one to me|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|roswolf: time is running out for G-DKR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2 boards to go and then they have to score up|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, still less than 50%..... but quite a bit better than 34% which is K@H and the 3-2|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  pretty decent slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade lead  might have a chance for defence|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: 20-25 minutes almost as being on time in India where time is not much of an issue|pg||
nt|kemperg: :))|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|cicus: it may be a @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: well might be found|pg||
nt|ady: not a clear cut make|pg||
nt|cicus: @H lead requires less support from partner|pg||
nt|ady: still not a definate make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|cicus: he might as well lead his suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tell them that they are off two keycards for spades and that they should stop in 4, then give them 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead only thing that makes it difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: now Nanev already knows there are no 5-carders against him|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|Walddk4: This is excruciatingly slow|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ady: even on this lead  might try spade finesse for 9th trick   still not home|pg||
nt|cicus: might duck @H10 first|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: @H ducks seems safe enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|ady: well if defence wins heart   and cash clubs and play spade from south   then what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: In bd 3, 4 & 5 Shrikant got 37 imps|pg||
mb|5S|nt|cicus: if I-VVU wins, who is going to be the 3rd pair?|pg||
nt|cicus: a valid point, David|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: how do you cash clubs? no it is safety again to raise with the A|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: sorry   since south has won heart needs spade now|pg||

nt|andyv:  optomistic raise by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2NT IS PRECISELY?|pg||
nt|cicus: precision players often assign this type of hand to 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|cicus: strong 6-card suit, balanced maximum|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kaubash in the other room was 99% certain that he could beat 5@H because partner had shown diamonds, so he doubled and did indeed defeat it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzku: without 3 cards in spade |pg||
nt|ady: problem is if 3T the contract  may be wrong sided|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: will east compete as happened in the other room?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|cicus: some pair play that it evenpromises 3-card support as well|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and when in with @HA he underled diamonds to the king and got a spade ruff|pg||

mb|4D!|nt|shevek: 1@s Xfer to @h ? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  5@h by W|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|patricck: perhaps East, knowing that hos side has 31 Imps to recover threw in an early psyche to make things happen?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ritong: west intended to invite|pg||
nt|cicus: yes I often feel it already at board 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is ok with the heart finesse right|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cards lay well for e/w in both games|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT a bit heavy, isn't it?|pg||
nt|ady: some entry problems   not knowing where spade honors are|pg||
nt|patricck: I fso it wouldn't have been clever to psche above your real suit|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|shevek: Shrikant had a 27imp lead after 1st session which they have maintained after the 2nd sesion|pg||
nt|patricck: If N/S bid 3NT it will need a @H lead to beat it|pg||
nt|patricck: 6NT i mean|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm..... on 2nd thoughts my maths there is fairly bad :(|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|andyv:  claim should be made at trick one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|patricck: 6@D does indeed have a chance, and a very lucky lie of the cards|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: he has nine on top|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: but has to play for the hearts to come in|pg||
nt|patricck: AK@C and ruff followed by KQ@D and a spade to the Ace to draw the last trump|pg||
nt|patricck: then can just concede 1@S|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|ritong: as long as @h are not 5/0, is a claimer|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|patricck: both 2@D and 2@S are fairly straightforward|pg||
nt|shevek: respect for partner here?|pg||
nt|patricck: the only real partscore accident comes in 1NT which can be beaten with K@S A@D and 5 club tricks|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kemperg: 1@S normal in precision?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  not really|pg||
