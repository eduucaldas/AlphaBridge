mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|woozle: Chang's overcall might work poorly if it warns Tadashi against excess|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Kieran Dyke|pg||
nt|woozle: Tadashi, apparently, has a plane to catch at the end of this match|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not wasting any time with science|pg||
nt|loganrun: No science but a practical approach|pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe he just figured that he'd never get the information to bid seven with confidence, but it could easily be cold|pg||
nt|loganrun: Now he must make 6|pg||
nt|woozle: Tadashi will need to guess something right to make this - either the diamond hook, or the spade third round restricted choice position, or the red suit squeeze on east, or perhaps ...|pg||
nt|woozle: a double squeeze|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Once west has the spade guard and east the diamond guard, a double squeeze must work|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East heart guard sorry|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|woozle: an alternative line has been mentioned - eloping with two heart ruffs and a spade ruff, specifically requiring West to be 4324|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|woozle: also kind of works when west has three spades, since you can switch line|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It is 100% when West has more than 2 spades|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Good Morning all|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: good morning|pg||
nt|mrdct: need to be in 3NT rather than 5@d here|pg||
nt|jcwla: A singleton ask will get them there.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or not needed.|pg||
nt|kemperg: change the names please|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Germ, all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Germ and Gonzalo|pg||
nt|fluffy: Open room saw north open a weak NT, wich buried the diamond fit after the heart overcall, now south is poalying 6@c with the bad split|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mrdct: west showing his minor 2-suiter|pg||
nt|kareno: 5 of a minor will likely make e/w but n/s have a huge spade fit so they will likely not sell at that level.|pg||
nt|frankaus: $US 100,000 to winners !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d by east is best to minimise the chance of a @c ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx |pg||
nt|mrdct: welcome back to wuxi|pg||
nt|bg: pass by W strange if 1nt =15-17|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello. Nice to be not alone.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants online at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/Systems_Open.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: very pretigious event each year |pg||
nt|mrdct: east telling partner he has equal length in the minors|pg||
nt|kareno: West likely will bid clubs - then we'll see what north does.  Exciting from the get go!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: meanwhile NS are cold for 5@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Friederieke|pg||
nt|kareno: Welcome Henry Bethe :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats ok if all else is well|pg||
nt|kemperg: has squeeze possibillyties|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/index.aspx  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|fluffy: in 6@c you have 2 ways of going down (@d-@s squeeze and the wrong finese)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I think 4NT is natural|pg||
nt|fluffy: showing a minimum hand with good hearts not willing to go to the 5 level|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kareno: And that he wants to compete :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: possibly that was just the contract not the auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  Greetings|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt by south works fine!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Gary.|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Not the real auction, but i got here too late|pg||
nt|frankaus: team members ay - http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/entries.aspx|pg||
nt|kareno: South's double doesn't make sense to me - he doesn't want to defend.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fine auction:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Gary and Jordan|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi G|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi G.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: @HAQ protected now, although @s lead and @h through will put some presure on declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: but 6 of a minor still a good save|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine Precision e/w|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|kemperg: and Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like -1 , -1 is good bridge some say|pg||
nt|frankaus: i play lots of good bridge  by that measure|pg||
nt|fluffy: Mark had just 1 shot to decide for a contract, and he settled for slam in clubs, the suit quality had a great impact|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: both of our pairs using transfer responses over 1@C  and as we see here -- in competition|pg||
nt|kareno: When you save over the five-level you have to be RIGHT.  If they cannot make 5 you are wrong and if they can make six and bid it, you are wrong.|pg||
nt|kareno: You need mirrors to defeat 5@c|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes its right to take out insurance enen if ur -1 in both directions|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: And actually if west ducks the improbable heart lead, it will make too.|pg||
nt|mrdct: it would be a bad start to the match to defend 5@cx making when you are cold for 5@s yourself|pg||
nt|frankaus: exciting hand to get us on the way|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@d - anyone know what that is?|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a limit raise of @s with no shortages|pg||
nt|frankaus: duessing  - good @S raise|pg||
nt|frankaus: guessing|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm hearing limit, no short suit ... and Bergen.|pg||
nt|kareno: In any event, Bocchi's sniffer is working hard!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: CC from 2010 Euro is  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is he bids one more....your guess?|pg||
nt|frankaus: bochhi's hand hast little defence|pg||
nt|kareno: The 4-1 split may make things rocky for declarer.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: He's all offense and no defense!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Friederike, all|pg||
nt|kareno: But happily for declarer, that is quite unlikely - more likely with the auction, however.|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Xu|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes i play great bridge  ( i go -2) LOL|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mrdct: easy make on the @s lead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: system aside, opening a hand with 8.5 losers and a 4333 11 count is swimming against the current|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyway, the idea is you want to have a singleton ask in place in case your @D's were say headed by Q instead of K.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mrdct: @h lead less attractive now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kareno: Are e/w names surnames or first names, Operator?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: np Andrew welcome all|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not mad about his pass particularly if south's first bid showed as many as four spades with invitation.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North is  Hackett|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello and welcome to the 5th round of the qualification for the YEH Bros. Cup.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugrapha4: Hi Gary, I'll check when I can|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's customary in most parts of asia to use first names|pg||
nt|fluffy: he risks facing dummy with @c singleton and decent diamons (even 5 cards possible), but what he doesn't want in any way is to face @dQxxx or @dJxxx|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude    Klinger-Mullamphy odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: surnames only please|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcarroll: Nice competitive bidding to push EW to the limit|pg||
nt|fluffy: and play in 6@d|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: these names are left over from previous match|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will go down 2 but give Netherlands an IMP.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing that EW  are Verhees - van Prooijen|pg||
nt|henryb:  You do not know whether declarer's @h are that robust. Coult easily be AJx|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kareno: Declarer relieved I'm sure.  And now diamond finesse for safety.|pg||
nt|kareno: It can be effective - it's perfectly normal for Meckwell, one of the world's premier pairs.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: also normal for a lopt of ineffective pairs. i have a strange hunch Meckwell would occasionally win even if they didnt open these:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: as first name is usually but not always the family name|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes need to hook or duck a @d to maintain communication to the entryless dummy|pg||
nt|kareno: I am told: first name. Hiroki Yokoi and  Kazuo Furuta.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|frankaus: 12 is a nice start|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed, in a short match too.|pg||
nt|mrdct: running scores: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=1&tourid=902|pg||
nt|kareno: I assume this is a round robin phase.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 10 rounds of swiss|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk3: http://tinyurl.com/3dtwfd9  for standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Friederike|pg||
nt|kareno: I knew those were first names - but I have TWO first names so wasn't sure :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Well done!!|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|mcarroll: Hi Friedirike|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrdct: when i used to work in Indonesia I was always called Mr David by my staff|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: no problems left|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Well, declarer does not know that yet.|pg||
nt|kemperg: lookes like a double squeeze|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D not 31|pg||
nt|fluffy: the way it has gone, he now also has another way to make: score his trumps separatelly!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kareno: More information: both professional players. W:20's, E:early 30's.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c4|nt|baldfriede: Going down three now. Commentator's curse.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only person who calls me 'Miss Karen' is my doctor's receptionist :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have pitched a @s from dummy, cashed one high club before running @d|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: in Open, W  only bid 2@S and S is now in 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: just ruff down hearts and spades, and make his 6 trumps tricks with 3@s and @dAK +@hAfor a total or 12|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|fluffy: in the last trick @dQ and @cJ will kill each other|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: depending on trick target and entries, low to the ace may be better. it drops the stiff king when such obtains, and it  can make the second round decision easier|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: No matter, I don't think a squeeze would operate.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: i don't think we'll see a @c finesse here|pg||
nt|kareno: Had south ducked this, west would have been in trouble.  |pg||
pc|d5|nt|kareno: But that's more elegant :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: NS must be Burgess-Courtney   since they're playing 4-handed|pg||
pc|hK|pc|cT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kareno: @s ace?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: talking in islation, not in context of any particular layout, as circymstances alter cases|pg||
nt|kareno: Can't get back to dummy.  Transportation was just too tough on this hand.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  tightens up the position, lets me see one more card before deciding how to play clubs -- and I would already have 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|kareno: spade now would tell the whole story|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cJ|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kemperg: well done|pg||
nt|fluffy: IMO he made a small technicall mistake, he should had played @cQ before, so that if east has 8@hs and Furuta overruffs the third heart trick, Furuta gets endplayed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd an exciting flat board :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: but Furuta has led @h2, he cannot have 2 cards anyway|pg||
pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Depending on how they lead from small cards it is possible the spade position was clear anyway|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: from trick 1 he was almost sure of the @s-position|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|loganrun: Suffice to say, he trusted the opening lead showed the Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  But sometimes people don't lead honestly against slams ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or at all ...|pg||
nt|woozle: 3NT West looks best here, but 4S is OK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|woozle: Apparently Huang was confident that dummy would have four spades|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would tend to be skeptical that someone would lead from Jxxx instead of their partner's suit, but Patrick Huang is a better player than I am|pg||
nt|pelu: normal the first lead gives correct Number of card - that was all S need|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|woozle: Huang apparently figured that South was prepared for a heart lead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|woozle: Now, Huang needs to draw trumps as fast as possible|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|sT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|woozle: now, Huang's delicate approach in trumps will lead to down one|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: well defended - and the play not optimal, but Patrick didnt like @CA in N|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other tables visible using  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@c likely a diamond raise.|pg||
nt|mrdct: the top 15 teams plus Mr Yeh's team qualify for the KO stage with the top 8 (including Mr Yeh) getting a double KO advantage|pg||
nt|frankaus: is this correct or did we have a pass missed?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this a trap pass|pg||

nt|henryb:  or tied and gone on to win in OT|pg||
nt|mrdct: i haven't had that good fortune|pg||
nt|algraves:  lilght overcall at favourable vulnerability opp passed partner looking to pre empt or find a profitable save|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Richman-Griffiths playing previous board in 5@C|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like eight tricks is the limit for both sides.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: curious 2H bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  or lost in OT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|frankaus: red 2@D overcall would not be everybody's choice|pg||
nt|kareno: Mixed raise I imagine - 4 trumps and 6-9|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|kareno: Wrong vulnerability for n/s to compete further.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s the likely spot for EW now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: two easy boards to start|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3@d aSKS FOR STOPPERS IN 1D; i PRESUME:|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oops,sorry|pg||
nt|chilloncan: once more into the breach, my firends|pg||
nt|mrdct: no obvious source of tricks for declarer here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not a textbook double -- but often as here @C's will be long -- but in Geoff's hand too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ew have a @S partial|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6NT -1 in OR|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   1@S= either   bal 6-9 or 13+   OR   4+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this structure  1@C-1N = 10-12|pg||
nt|chilloncan: another 8.5 loser hand, but this time a viut of shape and favorable colors|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: stoppers in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: no fear for joe grue|pg||
nt|kareno: Big bid by Joe Grue|pg||
nt|kemperg: or dbl:(|pg||
nt|algraves:  east sees no reason the bid with such good defense|pg||
nt|mcarroll: same auction in OR|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcarroll: EW had 3NT with the 2-2 @D break|pg||
nt|henryb:  and likely to give back the imp from board 1 with interest|pg||
nt|mrdct: best defence should get this for 500|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hi dave|pg||
pc|c6|nt|baldfriede: Now stop, or else.|pg||
nt|kemperg: Not for the OR, NS in 4@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 1|pg||
nt|kemperg: not sure of the meaning of 3@C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: whatever it is it seems a bit pushy opposite a possible flat 15 count|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I was told 3@c is puppet; I thought it was a real suit.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugrapha4: North is declarer - his favourite seat!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with stif spade opps probably have that suit so hearts and clubs are the same suit, so why emphasize hearts when u can show both>|pg||
nt|bg: S has no confidence in pards vul 2 H call|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah he hasn't conveyed his 2-suiter|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have bid 4@s with Hiroki's hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Good lead.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like he'll scramble for 2 tricks in each suit except @d where he's got one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not the idea contract or start|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mrdct: yep - a likely push|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kemperg: Xu did not mark it as conv.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only source of tricks will be the defense :)  Clubs work well for declarer.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: So looks like the first swing of the round|pg||
nt|kareno: Dave :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: a more passive lead may have worked better for the defence|pg||

nt|woozle: Depends whether you consider the diamond lead suspicious...might be a singleton, or might be suggestive of CA|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A bit unlucky that the short trumps were with the singleton |pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|pelu: 4@S down 1 again? - look normal|pg||

mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|pelu: -110 fine against 4@H - or even 5@h|pg||
nt|woozle: I like to play the jump-cue (3C here) to show this range and more trumps than a single raise|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East is a bit heavy for a preemptive raise|pg||
nt|woozle: Huang doesn't let his aceless muck or the horrible vulnerability stop him from taking the usual approach of bidding 4S over 4H|pg||
nt|woozle: Masayuki might take the push here|pg||
nt|loganrun: Might?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|pelu: what is 5@D? a slam try?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes 7+|pg||
nt|algraves:  3NT with 9 tricks minimum of course |pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: the event is to determine Australia Representatives or 2011 APBF [zone 6 championship] and accompanying Zone 7 playoff  then 2011 Bermuda Bowl/Venice Cup|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 4 card openings for Burgess-Courtney, strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Peter Gill was to opening the South hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S are Paul and Justin Hackett    EW  Adam and Nabil Edgtton (brothers)|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice hand here|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S will be the winner of the contest?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Burgess-Courtney playing  "4 Card Standard"|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a precision style 2@c|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Finally slam time.|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS could scape home in 3NT here - but partscore more likely i think|pg||
nt|kareno: North left with a winner and a loser.  That @h 7 was the bee's knees :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mrdct: just about make 7@d here|pg||
nt|kareno: Multi by west|pg||
nt|algraves:  dble shows spades|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kareno: Looks like 6@d will fetch here but hard to get there after opening bid by west.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes this is a handtype whee precision pats off|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pays the piper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW were on the winning team in (last month's?) NEC Cup|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@s pass or correct I guess|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s is pass/correct - i.e. interested to play in game opposite a weak 2 in @h|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@H is making|pg||
nt|kemperg: not so easy:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Looks like a victory for the weak NT - @S partial on for EW|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Although 1NT no bed of roses|pg||
nt|kemperg: should end in 4@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: was not easy for E to find a dbl:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: White on red first seat making up for the lack of texture and EW really nothing to say.|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl modern style, 1@S = no @S's|pg||
nt|algraves:  presumably 1@S would deny 4+ spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: it was a mere overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart lead would put paid to 7|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt looks normal here.|pg||
nt|fluffy: Huang made soem safety play in trumps to protect from @cA being offside, that wasn't succesful|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|baldfriede: I don't see a way to develop a 7th trick.|pg||
nt|kemperg: why duck|pg||
nt|mrdct: curtis needs slightly better @s pips for this to make|pg||
nt|mrdct: west's @HK in gold|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there;s no bee;s knees like slow bee's knees|pg||
nt|mrdct: need accurate defence to beat this|pg||
nt|algraves:  a good treatment for the system freaks out there in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Griffiths-Richman 2/1|pg||
nt|mrdct: does it? - they might not find their @d fit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that was my point|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@c will still make though i think|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT denies 3@S's|pg||
nt|kemperg: Ah:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: standard signals for NS     EW upside-down count/attitude  odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Courtney - "I  always wondered what you'd have if you passed throught Bobby, and know we know"|pg||
nt|mrdct: north needs to show a spade splinter and that might get south going|pg||
nt|chilloncan: y|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Can't believe North won't show the strength. Now probably 4@h.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver in 4H|pg||
nt|mrdct: and this|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i prefer 2D on E hand in this situation|pg||
nt|kareno: Huh?  Weak?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: did Fred really duck that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mrdct: the tapping defence in @h looks best double dummy|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there are double dummy lines to find a way to go down, but i would need massive odds to bet against declarer|pg||
nt|chilloncan: weak? red against white fdacing a passed partner|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c had a better chance of making here|pg||
nt|kareno: But could north pass it?  |pg||
nt|algraves:  you put overcaller on lead, and save bidding space on some tricky to bid hands|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fast and furious auction|pg||
nt|fluffy: vulnerability scared EW from competing any further|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: this way 4@S North instead of South :)  with some extra info for declarer that won't affect the play|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm sure NS would be more than happy to reach 6@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: *is|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  4@s needs a @c shift at trick 2 to beat|pg||
nt|kareno: Won't a spade shift work as well?|pg||
nt|algraves:  3NT is a make here|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh   of course Dyke rebid 2@H|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d only?  I wonder if their responses to takeout doubles are peculiar.|pg||
nt|algraves:  presumably 3@C did not promise great hand, as 2@Sfor that|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: E surely worth another bid?|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, maybe not :)|pg||
nt|algraves:  but the light overcall style hurts them here as east was afraid to bid past 3@C. picture the overcall on board 2|pg||
nt|algraves:  no free lunch|pg||
nt|frankaus: E has a good hand after pd opens - i would think is worth some form of game try |pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C ment also a good overcall|pg||
nt|algraves:  well partner did not open, they overcalled and on board 2 they overcalled with 6 HCP|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT makes from E but not W, and after the encouragement from W with 3@C it is reasonable I suppose for E to take a shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: then he would pass 2@C|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mrdct: south won't feel all that comfortable yet with a @d ruff looming|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will go down a lot now.|pg||
nt|mrdct: with south a passed hand it looks like a offer to play but north is not to know south has 6 of them|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugrapha4: now*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: an anomaly :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: well on the way to 6@D now|pg||
nt|mrdct: a GF must have been established before 3@d also i think|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Better :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: kind of unlucky|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: foul break of course|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, if diamonds are 41 the ocntract is at risk, so declarer will just bang trumps down|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not a lot of options for S|pg||
nt|bg: having started this way S should keep on drawing trump|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i think 5C is passable since S passed as dealer and N only raised to 2H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: EW upside-down count & attitude    1st discard odd/even|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The only grand slam that makes is 7@C|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Try to bid that|pg||
nt|mrdct: -1 here will win 6 imps from USA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ianmcc: hi|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Ian|pg||
nt|kemperg: gm Ian|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: draws trump now and plays a @D|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Adam|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not sure what it all meant but nicely bid by the italians|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, I somehow thought west had opened - silly me :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we landed |pg||
nt|kareno: Well done. 7 depends on a finesse - sort of silly to bid that much.|pg||
nt|fluffy: also having stiff @hK wich is half a trick playing in hearts, but no trick playing in spades, is a negative factor towards bidding one more|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: I would say he will make 7 now.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, hard to find.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s4|nt|mrdct: he has @d blocked if they are 4-1|pg||
nt|frankaus: @C's likely to yield 6 tricks after the @C support|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT 2@S end in OR|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we got to see Adam as last minute substitute player yesterday in a pickup partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: brutal event for that scenario|pg||
nt|mrdct: good lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chilloncan: my point exactly|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence would need to be asleep to let NS make 5@c wiht the @dAKQ on lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|baldfriede: @s switch now for 3 down.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on a lowm @H now, E is endplayued|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR NS in 4@S, EW were quiet|pg||
nt|ianmcc: who shut me out?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bg: not blocked any more:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: and west has evidently been to the "Lead Partner's Suit" school of bridge and finds the killing @d lead vs 5@hx|pg||
nt|algraves:  well sure but my point is that you cant have your cake and eat it also, There is a downside to the aggressive overcall style in that constructive bidding when it is your hand is more difficult|pg||
nt|frankaus: there would be some agreement about pass after X and a bid later  - could have influenced the auction|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mrdct: ruffing @s wont do the job so he'll go for setting up @c now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ?|pg||
nt|fluffy: Weichsel  is setting a dummy reversal, even when he has more trumps, he prefers to set clubs and make dummy high forgetting about diamonds|pg||

pc|cK|nt|mwigor: isnt it more than one down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes indeed|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: pretty conservative non-X by East|pg||
nt|mwigor: it is worth noting that 5@c makes EW - so in theory this is a good result for NS|pg||
nt|mwigor: i doubt many will find 5@c though|pg||
nt|kemperg: has chances |pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will not be easy.|pg||
nt|kemperg: first the start:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Passive defence may beat this - a @D lead gives declarer his 9th trick|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D J can also be the 9th|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h lead look normal to me.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I suppose 1@s means @h here.|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure |pg||
nt|kareno: I guess as of last night|pg||
nt|mrdct: yesterday they were updated about once every 10 minutes with live progressive scores from all matches|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S was -3 on 3 for 6 imps practically all square now|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice, a close match|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no trump finesse here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile Kaplan-Rubens evaluates the W hand at under 8: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=QJ6+Q76+QJ73+K92 |pg||
nt|kemperg: transfer Walsh i think|pg||
nt|algraves:  and that 1@C is balanced or clubs, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Allan   1@C=3+  and transfer responses   not sure if 1@S promises @D|pg||
nt|kemperg: not sure either, in my system it does|pg||
nt|algraves:  well, no major presumably and if balanced not very strong so usually unbalanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well by unpassed hand  1@C-1N is game force 5+@D  and 1@S just denies 4+@H/@S   not sure by passed hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, to cater for injudicious overcalls|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: no choice is perfect, no choice is awful|pg||
nt|mrdct: this looks 2 off|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW have ti be carefull in @S|pg||
nt|kareno: Finesser's paradise :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: a nice direct auction by NS|pg||
nt|chilloncan: meanwhile, even playing 5 cxard majors i would have a tough time pulling out any bid but 1H|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence can only ever get 6 tricks here and with @SJ now set up they'll need a @d switch now to avoid -120|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: however   with 5@S 3@H  DBL isn't a good choice since weak advancer [partner of doubler] will bid 1@H with 3@H & 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't have Q1 result for  Hans-Brown   maybe Adam knows [his brother is member of Hans team]|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|fluffy: some people play that double means: pass if this is your suit, bid your suit otherwise|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like a puppet to 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: wd by N....far from obvious to bid over 1N, as S did not say double so suboar chance of 44 hearts, and long suit is weak. but this was the time for aggression|pg||
nt|chilloncan: oh wait, sorry i thought they were going to 3N after 2C|pg||
nt|kareno: Most unlikely, though |pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: i'm told  Brown +2     [or Hans -2]|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Brown up 2 imps|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c may well be a puppet to 2@d to establish this sign-off in 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if N was not planning to invite 3N, which as i said was pushy, i dont really warm up to aiming at a final contract of 3C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: needs to avoid the ruff|pg||
pc|c5|nt|frankaus: nicely done to protect N's @s stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course my copy of the NS CC is from Beijing 2008|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kareno: Not enough compensation for their vulnerable game.  Of course 4@h can be beaten but will it?|pg||
nt|fluffy: I am not a multi expert, but I ahve seen this treatment at the table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I play X = I know what your suit is please pass|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chilloncan: why not just pass 1N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd singleton King in 4 boards  |pg||
nt|frankaus: declarer will be holding his breath as he takes @h finess|pg||
nt|algraves:  ok regardless they have arrived at the best contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: most peaple do it that way|pg||
nt|kemperg: to late negative i mean|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: but EW could easily be going down in 5@s or 5@h in the other room so might be good for the chinese/dutch combination|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mwigor: of course -800 would not have been a good score for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at KQ10 south llikely to switch to @DK anyway which blocks @d|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lots of red suit discards coming|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: that's after 16 of 48 boards|pg||

nt|kareno: 11 toppers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver in 3N North after East opened 2-suited 2@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|baldfriede: Gettin up with K@d gave a trick.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugrapha4: 64 is it not?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy -- i changed my mind about   with 48 to play versus  16 of 64 :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would be very confident that no table in the field will play this board at the 4-level|pg||
nt|kareno: So a quiet down two.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|baldfriede: E/W  have to stick to their @s.|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: you wanna jump in?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrdct: he wont be happy seeing the @cQ coming down|pg||
nt|mrdct: now north needs to cling to all his @cs|pg||
nt|algraves:  west really trusted his partners double as he can see nine tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unusual not to take the safety play the ruff was staring in the face|pg||
nt|algraves:  and had to assume that they could not now take 4@D tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: deLivera also opened 4@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like 10 tricks - but missed a possible vul game in 3NT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c9|nt|kiwibridge: 39 imps in 4 boards it's not good bridge|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mwigor: they've missed the second ruff so now only 2 down|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@C in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink playing 4@H South|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not necessarily, defence can still get 5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: no real surprise there|pg||
nt|mwigor: perhaps gosney should have led back the jack?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Which should yield 2@S and 1@D to defence for 1 down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h discard would have given it.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not any more needed to play @C|pg||
nt|kareno: There should be some sort of squeeze on this hand.  Or an ending.  Very complex.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting trump position, W has to coup S by leading red winners from dummy to prevent the @S6 winning a trick|pg||
nt|bg: sry too early|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Bruce|pg||
nt|fluffy: yeah in the end he has to play small trump to the 8 from his hand if Mark Lair refuses to ruff anything|pg||

nt|henryb:  If I were Joe I would play @hK ans a @h to the J before cashing the last @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: 8 tricks it is|pg||
pc|d7|nt|baldfriede: Declarer still fears AQ@c offside.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bg: discard club ruff a heart dia to ace ruff another heart then low to the eight endplay|pg||
pc|dA|nt|baldfriede: Here is the reason why @h discard would have given a trick.|pg||
nt|kareno: Nicely done with an endplay.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: good cover with @HQ   but now we'll never know whether or not Matt was going to float the 10|pg||

pc|d5|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||

nt|woozle: Huang will be surprised at the auction...checks the backs of the cards?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Probably five for me|pg||
nt|woozle: How about 2S from Huang..hard to imagine a better position for psyching|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't teach our poor spectators to psyche|pg||
nt|loganrun: West knows the opps have spades so bidding them at the 2 or 4 level is not a bad idea|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If I was going to psyche it would be 4@s not 2@s, more preemptive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: WSe have 700 beginners and intermediates among them|pg||
nt|pelu: max contract 5@s|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pelu: nice try|pg||
nt|woozle: Huang chooses Blackwood as his smokescreen|pg||
mb|5D|nt|pelu: W know that opp has a 9 card fit in @S - can he steal the contract in 5@H?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Masayuki surely can't pass with this beast, but the secondary spade fit is lost|pg||

mb|4H|nt|mwigor: 4@d isnt great news - but avi does have a good hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: 6@h is an ok contract - and makes on this layout|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h EW the spot here|pg||
nt|kareno: This hand should get to a quiet 4@h but it is possible to overstretch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=limited  4+@H maybe longer 2nd suit  included 5@H & 5@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=0-2@S  forcing unless 5@H(332)|pg||
nt|mrdct: most likely @s of course|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think there was intent in the open room just not the desired outcome|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: Stretchy Drury by east.|pg||

mb|5H|nt|vugrapha4: I'm about to resatr the room.. this looks pretty easy. back in 2 minutes|pg||

nt|mrdct: north can get a @c ruff but there is no entry back to south for another one|pg||
nt|frankaus: 12 probable in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure if he was going to that, bid NT or conventionally show @C support|pg||
nt|kemperg: then where did W find 3@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: precision 3 suiter short @D I amd told (yuk)|pg||
nt|kemperg: that explains|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I saw it in an earlier match. That must be the lot until 2015|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's truly horrible in my book, 2@C I could almost tolerate|pg||
nt|jcwla: Texture doesn't seem to matter until you have to play in one of those suits you bragged about.|pg||
nt|kemperg: that happened in OR, and S is in 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT will be in trouble on a @s lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 5+@S|pg||
nt|algraves:  2@D presumably artificial game force|pg||
mb|5S|nt|henryb:  This play was 100%, but unless Kazuo had not led a @h from Q10xxx a heart play was also 100% and offered chances for the overtrick|pg||
nt|mrdct: plenty of trick on offer here if he gets @d right and contract still safe if he doesn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Courtney is well known for his prowess at Rubber Bridge|pg||
nt|mrdct: it wont be too hard for south to unblock|pg||
nt|mrdct: draw trumps and try to steal a @c trick|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the known diamond positioin gives him an extra entry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are 9 tricks but can het get them|pg||
nt|kemperg: par 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: after 3@C -- will Klinger push to 3@H?|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR S played a second low @D for the K|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: now to make it wont be easy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: specs might factor that into some of the auctions we'll see|pg||

pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: E has to discard 3|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mrdct: nowhere to dump all of the @d losers|pg||
nt|mrdct: yep|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrdct: the defence will need to switch to a @d at some point but will get several chances|pg||
nt|algraves:  it looks like he is going to have to pick up both spades and diamonds to make it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kemperg: wd, W had to play the 10|pg||
nt|ianmcc: S should overtake @dK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Fred kindly located the high cards for him|pg||

nt|chilloncan: well then we agree|pg||
nt|mrdct: @s continuation by east now might see west squeezed a tad on the run of the @d|pg||

nt|ahollan1: is this a Restricted Choice situation or is 10 meaningless looking at that dummy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now the trump situation is debatable, is the @S Ten singleton or from QT,|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gill's problem tough here   transfer responses not requiring any points, but not forbidding them either :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL and 2N seem the front runners   hard to imagine PASS, but that would work out fine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Richman in 2N North|pg||

nt|henryb:  violating "Burn's Law": It is a bad idea to play in a contract there the opponents have more trumps than you do :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and Vul vs Green even worse|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N may have been contemplating a @C slam, but E doubling @S would probably stop that line of thought|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think south will find a @s lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Poorly by west with a spade lead.|pg||
nt|kemperg: lot of 9 pts opened nowadays|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
nt|frankaus: -2 now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: the OR are now on board 9 we are a bit behind|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugrapha4: Simple squeeze on Bobby in the endgame|pg||
nt|kareno: Henry you simply have to type faster :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: there was a burns law hand about this time yesterday where 4@h made 11 tricks in the 5-1 fit after a misunderstanding about splintering in partner's suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: Neat - at least one hand had a lot of trumps!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: badly with competent defense i think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrdct: @d continuation will disturb NS commincations|pg||
nt|kareno: East would never bid notrumps on that hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  5   Brink in 6@S South|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|baldfriede: South will switch to na @d now.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c3|nt|baldfriede: a*|pg||
nt|mrdct: there is quite an advantage to finish in the top 7 from the swiss to get a double-chance in the KO stage|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct.  The bottom finishers get to play a single KO and the top ones play a double KO|pg||
nt|mrdct: but the top 15 plus Mr Yeh's team all qualify for the KO stage|pg||
nt|kareno: And I assume Mr. Yeh's team qualifies into the top group?|pg||
nt|mrdct: correct|pg||
nt|kareno: Only reasonable since he is sponsoring this great event!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|baldfriede: Well done.|pg||
nt|kemperg: must have good brakes in their system|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: @S10 odd/even says   don't like @S  prefer @H over @D|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrdct: @D guess wont help him here|pg||
nt|mrdct: needed to read the @c position first!|pg||
nt|algraves:  good defense by NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CA lead from Barel --  not sure if similar inference about @S position    might think lead Ace implies trump trick|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|mrdct: now south retains the @DK as his entry to the long @c|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mrdct: @CAK, ruff @c high and draw last trump|pg||
nt|kareno: Or ace of diamonds ... etc.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|kemperg: all cards well placed for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@c is on for EW|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W passed?|pg||
nt|mrdct: or a conventional response to a strong @c opening|pg||
nt|algraves:  2NT or 3@C by NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 5@c excellent e/w ... n/s can compete but it gets expensive.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mrdct: this match isn't going well for one of the tournament favourites|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, 4@s appears to work well here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C  Bergen   [by passed hand??]|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Which actually works.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The horrible trump split kills it.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: is this the right auction?|pg||
nt|kareno: Operator, this cannot be right.|pg||
nt|mrdct: if EW are to reach game they will have to take a bid at some point|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@s by north maybe a psyche|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and here's another, bout time mind you|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 2@S or 3@S from Gill?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Oddly enough I think 6@S makes|pg||
nt|kemperg: works I think|pg||
nt|mrdct: the way thing sit - NS can only make 9 tricks in either major i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: or reality as we are seeing now|pg||
nt|chilloncan: while we wait for restoration, i recommend listening to Leo Kottke;s "It's So Cold in China, the birds don;t sing"|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Not unexpected they would make if they bid it.  Italy in trouble in this match.|pg||
nt|kareno: East must bid now!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c seems a normal contract - but north will probably compete to 5@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: or 5@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6-5s are designed for defending|pg||
nt|mrdct: and nor are 7-4s|pg||
nt|kareno: There's a famous bridge adage - "6-5 come alive"|pg||
nt|kareno: Did you mean aren't designed for defending?|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sorts of hands you have in the back of your mind the risk of pushing the opps to a making slam|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed *aren't|pg||
nt|algraves:  3@S by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  @H & @S      2@D asks longer/better|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kareno: And with the information provided in the auction, e/w can make six clubs by picking up diamonds - queen first.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C obvious showing a heart fit, but i don't know whether he is just improvising|pg||
nt|ahollan1: showing a Limit Raise     i never remember if that is original or modified Bergen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some situations 1N is 14-16, but i think this 1N is supposed to be 15-17|pg||
nt|baldfriede: All they give off is a trump.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True indeed|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think they'll get to 4@s ok now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C limit is reverse bergen|pg||
nt|kareno: They need to get some IMPs on the board.  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: But declarer has nasty guesses in all suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: first guess np|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This lead is helpful though.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: except @HS|pg||
nt|kemperg: even 6NT is "good":(|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcarroll: who was it said  "Any slam that makes is a good slam"?|pg||
nt|kemperg: -1|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: of course Zhejiang Huamen are amongst the favourites also|pg||
nt|mrdct: joe feeling that he's pretty much fully described his hand with 3@h so no need to say any more|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes.  I guess 1@c starts with 15.  So the auction by west was natural.|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer could ruff here and overtake the spade jack to pull trumps.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: seems the indicated line|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c ruff looming in declarer's mind|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the delay here is puzzling,but declarer is probably worried about a dummy lock after the spade ace wins|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kemperg: cant do wrong in @C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and second, and therefore problems vanish :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Now this is a bit disappointing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink also got @S right in the slam|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: he gets a lucky lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: if courtney thinks west has @CA and @DKQ he will get spades wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: It's pretty well impossible for the defense to get any traction on this hand.|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i do understand how in context of 4-card majors it might make sense to forgoe Drury |pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno: If south gives north a club ruff, then the diamond goes away.  Declarer will worry but north will be out of trumps.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: silence by S has a chance to play off|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S KQ stiff in E?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kareno: This is a count situation and I believe the jack of hearts showed three.|pg||

nt|athene: but of course they are also risky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Burgess sooo strong, maybe they'll be able to unravel|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i thought i was having a flashback   just couldn't remember which decade|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1@D=4+@H's|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1@H=all hands with 3card hearts but not forcing, or some hands with 4@H's|pg||

nt|mcarroll: me too|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like a GF variety|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: shorter auction same spot|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: last night one of these bids at unfavourable ended in -1100 to save 430|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be a misunderstadning here for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=game force  in this case  8-11 or 15+ HCP and 3 places to play|pg||
nt|mrdct: west doesn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: burgess takes the low road|pg||
nt|chilloncan: one does open 1D when dictated by a draconian system, but the undfettered heart yearns to open the eponymous 1H|pg||
nt|mrdct: or not|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andy_h: Gosney would like to pass the 1@H but 18-19NT with 3 hearts would also bid 1@H so he's constrained to bid 1NT|pg||
nt|baldfriede: If you have both majors, show them, even if you have a fit in one.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2nt showed an invitational raise with 4 spades.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C= (54)/55  @C & @D  or  4@D & 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps just a little bit cautious|pg||
nt|andy_h: I suspect that 2@C or 2@D by Gosney would be artificial (aka xyz)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C clarified short @C or @D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: he may suspect that|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but he does have weak trumps |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@H shows 4  [support dbl situation??]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy 3@H bid seems to support that guess|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: grab a coffee everyone :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=1@D 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: but 2NT looks OK with everything stopped nicely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N = to play if 8-11 HCP|pg||
nt|mrdct: opportunity for a non-vul game swing for japan|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mrdct: and the @d7 is now going to come into play|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice system, W was not interested|pg||
nt|kemperg: East|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: still 6@H should have some play? especially with the lead coming up to those luscious minor suits|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@h apparently like Kokish, showing great extras.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: the auction didn't reveal whether 5@S & 4@H   or   5@H & 4@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: kokish style here it seems|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mrdct: well read|pg||
nt|kemperg: well bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is on board 6 -- but i bet they don't repeat our auction|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrdct: i think this will end in tears for EW with 3NT going down|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: the other room is bidding  7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: half our audience are commentators obviously enthralled by the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: anything happening Catherine?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ish is thinking... of dinner perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: his thoughts won't help him on this board|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: not a good advertisement|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, for all that fabulous east hand I think they are overboard already|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4D ok i thinl|pg||
nt|mrdct: although on a @d lead from south he might scramble a 9th trick in @s before NS wake up to their cashing @h tricks|pg||
nt|chilloncan: oh wait, W would be declarer sprry|pg||
nt|kareno: West looking for a potted palm to hide behind|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm afraid i can't give much insight here as to what either east or west has shown|pg||
nt|mrdct: i've got one right here for him|pg||
nt|kareno: I think east has shown a massive club hand with a spade side suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: What do 3@H mean from E now? Sr for interrupting|pg||
nt|chilloncan: was 1H a GF?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  3N a bit unexpected    1@H denies game force|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcarroll: only 2 Aces to lose in this - or indeed almost any other - contract|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|baldfriede: Thiss should make 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: even after P-2N  probably still won't get to slam, but may sniff at it|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: NS play Reverse Smith vs NT|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north won't like weak @S  and 5422    south won't like minor suit queens|pg||
nt|mrdct: i suspect it's a relay asking west to tell him more|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: well, of course you would rather have the @SQ, but the minor-suit queens aren't useless|pg||
nt|athene: they stop the defence setting up any trick in a minor on the lead|pg||
nt|athene: so you can afford to lose the lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: try singleton to protect @SQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: No Ron went for the possible 41, better|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: Belive they had relay|pg||
nt|kareno: As I've seen it used here this week, 1@h creates a force to game.|pg||
nt|mrdct: west may have had a different idea|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: did Dyke do well not to mention @S   or was he lucky??|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am wondering whether E really has a GF|pg||
nt|mrdct: it looks like a GF to me|pg||
nt|chilloncan: his suit is a minor, he has only 2 aces and a big NT flawm etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or should say  "tends to deny"|pg||

pc|c7|nt|mrdct: just a shame west didn't come to party with anything to help him|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, using losing trick count, he has two losers.  And 5 1/2 QT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: yes -- i'm just saying it will slow down any mild attempt to get to slam|pg||
nt|chilloncan: of course, if he has no forcing sequence available to show a strong but not GF unbalanced hand, there may be no practical alternative|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: more imps likely for Huamen with partscore looking to make in both rooms|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute -- i didn't think about immediate duck|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: This is EW doing to NS what they did on board 4 - running long minor|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andy_h: North could have risen with the @CA to take the contract 2 off given the (un)lucky layout of the diamonds|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way -- a bit surprised that he sold out to 3@H when partner "freely" bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that was weakest way for Gill to bid  [other than PASS]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this is a great result for Morris Chang|pg||
mc|10|nt|algraves:  a good play by east as it shut out the hearts if they were 5-3|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: Huang bids a post-emptive 4S...Tadashi has no difficulty doubling|pg||
nt|loganrun: I would have thought that Patrick would bid 3S over 4S if he was going to bid it (give the opps less space)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nigel_k:  With respect to Patrick Huang, I think West has to bid 4@s immediately or not at all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|loganrun: 4S over 3S sorry|pg||

nt|woozle: Looking over earlier boards, Furuta appears to have played board 4 exceptionally well|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Ish gaine an imp bless him|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s makes here for N/S.|pg||
nt|kemperg: for them:)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: so i guess it would be going down in practice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 3+  but still transfer responses|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not many boards are left, time's running out for the Brown team. A 14imp was swung on board 19 where the failing grand (due to 4-1 break) was not bid in the other room|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: also a good lead by Gosney on 17 defeated a game for 12 more|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: good start for a final set for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d for NS here|pg||
nt|kemperg: fireworks here?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: We have a slam here, but it has to be played carefully to make.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s the limit for EW here|pg||
nt|kareno: China picked up 11 on the 4@s hand|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|mrdct: precision style 2@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: obviously if E had a major it would be a GF. with a minor it is certainly close with 3 losers |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-22|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D doesn't inconvenience the opening side|pg||
nt|bg: maybe 6|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah could be|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be difficult for EW to get into the auction now|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: south needs a raise to do that|pg||
nt|athene: but there we are :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This 2nt bid should be a help.|pg||
nt|kemperg: was my bid too, not yours?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: doesn't have a weak 2@H bid available|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: with the @HA with the singleton @d, the defence can only lead trumps once|pg||
nt|baldfriede: My bid too, but it helps nevertheless.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C fit, invite+ ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: it certianly looks tempting now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: certainly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Raptor NT overcalls -- so DBL is needed to cover Strong NT |pg||
mb|3H|nt|mrdct: 2@h is about the limit for NS here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h looks like a splinter agreeing @d|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@C now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @s is the better slam.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1S = no major?|pg||
nt|kareno: Double here would be takeout with primary diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: But it is always risky to balance into the opponents' misfit auction.|pg||
nt|algraves:  actually not for anybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@c - anyone know what this is?  Better than 1nt?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hods allow quasi-2N hands to peter out in playable spots|pg||
nt|mrdct: although the @d position is quite favourable|pg||
nt|kareno: Good screech to a stop!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay it shows 18-19 balanced, thanks.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm alway a bit nervous about splintering with a stiff king|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like OR may be in time trouble - only 6 boards played|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Another 3nt.|pg||
nt|kemperg: evereybodys choice 1@S?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes for me|pg||
nt|jcwla: And might not make it if did.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: true|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: he has a choice in trumps, whether to lead the @DJ to pin the ten|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like 9 tricks i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry start of my message was deleted by gremlins:  flexible methods allow....|pg||
nt|mrdct: draw trumps finishing in dummy and take @d hook|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to get to this spot by many methods|pg||
nt|kareno: Note that with JTx of trumps, it is correct to lead small in case partner has queen or king.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds friendly!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: friendly but not passionate. if 8 and 7 interposed, then passionate|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if it is clear that it is a misfit, not sure that is so here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: e.g. @SQ K A, diamond to queen|pg||
nt|mrdct: and even more nervous splintering in a suit shown by partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@S,   1N would show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and even if so, collect 50s with possible game your way if NS are really having u on|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: even if hiroki gets trumps right, might still lose 2@s, 1@c and 1@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence have 6 top tricks here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear|pg||
nt|kemperg: for me 5@H's + 4+ minor, |pg||
nt|kemperg: It is for my partner:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: 4@S looks to be the limit here, unless declarer takes a view on the clubs|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a very aggressive double of 3@D by Gosney|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: too true! Still, if he passed, West would X himself|pg||
nt|andy_h: Certainly a nice partner to provide him with four keycards!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In this vulnerability yes.|pg||
nt|jcwla: NT is a home not a refuge.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|baldfriede: Ruff out a small @h in @s slam to make.|pg||
nt|kemperg: I dont play semiforcing 2 openings, but still I doubt on 1@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: -2 imps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: can he find 8 tricks here?   my bet more likely down 2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice bidding as 4@H is destined to go down despite the 4-4 fit, at least 2@H, 1@S and a @C ruff|pg||
nt|kareno: Suit preference is my guess on the @c q|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: west may drop the @D8|pg||
nt|mrdct: as does declarer|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT had a play|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can probably surmise exact suit distribution though|pg||
nt|athene: trying to look like a man with @D108 doubleton|pg||
nt|kemperg: contract or 1 up the same|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bg: signals crossed here so much for fancy bids|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: the question being   is West  5332 or 5422|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he went wrong right away|pg||
nt|mrdct: and i assume 3@d showed a red 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HK for down 2   maybe duck = down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't really apply, but just made me think of     Lee Trevino: the more i practice, the luckier i get|pg||
nt|kemperg: he's on line now, but IN OR I hope|pg||
nt|algraves:  declarer now has nine tricks by building diamond|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think that was Gary Player Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd accept it from any of that group o' greats|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he hoped for the added advantage that east might not cover with @DKx|pg||
nt|athene: he will put south with five diamonds at least for the overcall|pg||
nt|athene: so he won't think his partner could have @D10xx|pg||
nt|kemperg: happiness is a long walk with a putter, that was Trevino|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kemperg: @D start gives leader a lot to think about|pg||
nt|kareno: Unlikely to lose a diamond.|pg||
nt|kareno: Now he'll probably finesse the heart into the safe, north hand.|pg||
nt|mrdct: live scores http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=6&tourid=902|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1S worked well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kemperg: not my happiness, i have to play without a caddy:(|pg||
pc|h6|nt|algraves:  west would be squeezed in majors even without the QJ dbt in clubs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the general rule i have in most of my partnerships is that you can never splinter in a suit partner has shown|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was 1@S alerted? TD can come.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kemperg: has to play fot 2 singletons!!|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|kemperg: gets the @D count, so 65 known|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe west should dbl 1@s - i wonder if they have an agreement for that|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1S maybe not conventional...maybe just a potshot|pg||
nt|kareno: If they have no agreement, south can bid what he likes.  If he OFTEN bids a major with three, then that constitutes an agreement.|pg||
nt|mrdct: a good thing to discuss with your partner as you will come across 1@c:1@s=no major more and more frequently these days and should have an agreement about the dbl|pg||
nt|ianmcc: asking to be raised?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: when NV vs vuk and a weak hand, sometimes a 3 card major short in the other one can be a good tactical move. dangerous of course but viable risk reward ratio at the colors|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andy_h: Yeap had he passed then the same contract would be reached, although probably played by Gosney|pg||
pc|s8|nt|baldfriede: Not really; what else is there but to ruff? And after the first trump everything is clear.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: one more after this and a restart in 30 mins from now, thanks Xu on Vugraph, Jordan, Ian, Germ, all specs for your greatfeedback, the CCBA and Roland and BBO and special thanks to ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Mr Yeh for this marvellous event|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks all, time for me to get a breakfast|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: could take the @D8 too on a trump promo now if they wanted|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 tricks will double Lavazza's imp total|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d might be difficult to bid - so making 4@h here might square the board|pg||
nt|bg: good place for the    ASBAF system  "All Strange Bids Are Forcing"|pg||
nt|kareno: ????|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mrdct: and 10 tricks will treble it!|pg||
nt|kareno: And that can be made.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: mnow has to hope that trumps are not 5-1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: sorry, 5-0|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chilloncan: welcome ian|pg||
nt|mrdct: well that didn't go well for the defence|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi. Not top defence|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Actually he had 9 tricks from the beginning with the @CQJ falling, |pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: it wouldn't matter though; the club loser would go away|pg||
nt|athene: it's just one down whatever route you take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room   8 [where we wondered about Courtney's 2@S opener]    DeLivera opened 2@H showing weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|andy_h: So I guess in a way he was generous enough to let partner play|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: richman just better make sure he doesn't get himself endplayed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS lead low from doubleton -- apparently that also applies in middle of hand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kemperg: no problems anymore|pg||
nt|mcarroll: in trouble now|pg||
nt|kemperg: for defens|pg||
nt|frankaus: play restricted choice when @Hj pops|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
nt|mcarroll: anyway he has the count |pg||
nt|kareno: Good result for USA|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and arrive in 6@H|pg||
nt|athene: ah, but the other way up|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: A mild oversave from Huang, but had he bid it earlier, he might have been defending 5H|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|nigel_k:  I agree. It's no big deal losing 500, but you want the upside of making them guess whether to go to 5@h|pg||
nt|woozle: Masayuki goes for a shapeless double, but he can't pass with this rock|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Once they have exchanged more information they will probably decide correctly when you bid 4@s later|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but the opening bid was 2@H North|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: that's what i mean - once you know north will be playing it, i think that tips it against bidding it|pg||

nt|chilloncan: if you are going to produce an ungainly defence, let it be to a partscore....a sign you are in heat one  and a half:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: most matches scored through 6 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15, 4+@S   could be 4@S and any 5+suit   never 5@S & 5@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: just enough time to maake my breakfast|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Custer's Last Hand, thanks to all|pg||
nt|algraves:  good 3@C bid by south against Canape systems|pg||
mb|r!|nt|athene: heavy 1nt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no excitement here either|pg||
nt|mrdct: @h partial for NS here - don't think game will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0+  maybe canape into @C/@S   1@S=3+@S  less than game force|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to our operator and to the specs for keeping us on our toes :)  Also to Dave Thompson who is soaking up the rays in Phuket, Thailand :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: good choice to open 1NT rather than 1@h to stop the opps from having an easy 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|mrdct: transfer to @d i presume|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: people often push the upper limit for 1nt overcall over 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: over 1@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s likely to fail here|pg||
nt|kareno: Almost certainly with any reasonable defense.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@D just makeble|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: And I am Friederike Greifswald-Tolleson.|pg||
nt|mrdct: west knows what to lead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-8 HCP, @H or @S  --  no strong options|pg||
nt|mrdct: might collect a few hundreds in 3@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: or 500 in 3@sx|pg||
nt|mrdct: will south pass?|pg||
nt|frankaus: tough choice for V.P.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the reason is they don't want to double and have to rebid 2nt facing a possible zero|pg||
nt|frankaus: can they stay pot of 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but you can easily miss games doing this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically 1N was 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: courtney might try 3nt now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C weak  weak 2@H|pg||
nt|kareno: West happy|pg||
nt|mrdct: west liking his prospects|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I can think of a lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@D i prefer instead of pass|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: why?   Burgess has only confirmed 13 cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: helpful lead still a lot of work for Ish hope his brain still aware after all that thinking earlier|pg||

nt|baldfriede: Martin Carroll*|pg||
nt|mrdct: good lead for declarer|pg||
nt|algraves:  jocleyed them into the third best game with a bad trump break|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec says 4@H in EW|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: but that would be a bit wild since south can't have much to pass 2@H and will usually have a lot less than he has|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Bobby gave X a couple seconds of thought|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @d now and if he ducks the roof could fall in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes @C's are ominous|pg||

nt|baldfriede: This will godown 1 no matter what.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: spec suggests 6N better no @D ruff|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: finally  a long @C suit is running|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS turning a plus score into a minus score|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Thanks to all who made this event possible: The organizers, our excellent operator, my co-commentators Frank Budal, Martin Carroll and Germ Kemper and of course the indefatigable ...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Roland Wald.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you think South is in lebensohl situation where 3@D showed some values?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if south happens to have nothing, 3nt is getting doubled and so is 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think 2N is scramble rather than lebensohl|pg||
nt|kemperg: they did:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: but bad news coming soon|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andy_h: Although declarer still has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|andy_h: If trumps are 3-1, provided that the defenders duck a round of clubs, there is no entry to dummy to enjoy the clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if Ginossar bids only 2@C -- wouldn't be surprised to see others in 4@H|pg||
nt|algraves:  needs 6 trump tricks to go with 4outside tricks|pg||
nt|algraves:  or finessse spade and take 5 trump tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: you might argue that with some values, south must do something over 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: unless he has a penalty pass of course, but he hasn't got that|pg||
nt|athene: so when he passes and then pulls the double, he is showing a pretty weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: of course there will be times when you would like leb to be on in these situations|pg||
nt|athene: but i think in general it's better to play 2nt as scramble|pg||
nt|mrdct: @SJ here to show the @HK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andy_h: However, given that West holds the singleton queen of trumps, a good guess in clubs would see the contract for one off. If Gosney ducks the first round of trumps, declarer will ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: then be able to ruff his two little spades. If Gosney takes it with the Ace and returns a trump, declarer then guess the clubs|pg||
nt|mrdct: @sJ might score a trick here|pg||
nt|kareno: Good idea to continue now :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: which one?|pg||
nt|kareno: Small for sure - suit preference.|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at K108 in hand and Q9 in dummy - west may not think east likely to be able to beat the @S9|pg||
nt|kareno: As long as east has a trump that works.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might more important. 3@D=bergen raise? E a bit mad? Then S might got the signals needed.|pg||
nt|mrdct: oh - low @d at trick 2!|pg||
nt|kareno: eek!|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yuck|pg||
nt|mrdct: @DJ and extravagent card to play at trick one perhaps|pg||
nt|kareno: West had better duck the spade now.|pg||
nt|mrdct: but this looks a very high risk defence by west which surely has an easy beat just pumping out @d from the top|pg||
nt|ianmcc: do they play udc? or by ear?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: one rarely gets the defense right after an early debacle such as we have jut witnesed|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I agree.  But still the low diamond is risky in case of this holding.|pg||
nt|kareno: I hear e/w playing 5@h doubled in the OR|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|braunstar: Hey all|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: disaster avoided|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hey Daniel|pg||
nt|braunstar: It seems Hans have built a nice lead into this last set|pg||
nt|braunstar: Does anyone know the results of the other match?|pg||
nt|mrdct: once north shows up with the @sA, the odds might favour south holding the other missing ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sometimes it DOESN'T??|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with 10 LTC and bad spades, W can pass... no game unless E can act  at almost any subgame level, in which case W wll have all values in reserve and can do the needful|pg||
nt|kareno: Still a vulnerable overcall ..|pg||
nt|mrdct: but when north turns up with the @sA, what has south got for his vul 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: gmta Dave|pg||
nt|frankaus: oh well -1 is good bridge (some say)|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps planning to take ruffs with the long @d|pg||
nt|algraves:  which I think he can just do|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: it was out of reach obviously with S in control|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mrdct: last board of the match here|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thanks all, see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks Gary and all.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cheers again all see you in the next round|pg||
nt|ianmcc: txall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but a good win to JiangSu here well deserved in the end|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: 5th and final round of the day scheduled to begin at 10 past the hour --- approx 35 minutes|pg||
nt|kemperg: not anymore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if @H will split poorly in the other room|pg||
nt|algraves:  no 3-3 in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with King onside|pg||
nt|algraves:  so this line needed 4-2 hearts or 7=2 clubs|pg||
nt|algraves:  and was clearly best|pg||
nt|algraves:  bad luck|pg||
nt|frankaus: running scores all matches at  - http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=9&tourid=902|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The Great Shuffler strikes again|pg||
nt|algraves:  now he must lose two more hearts if North forces him in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Pachtmann contemplating non-@C shift?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|frankaus: the presire card found|pg||
nt|frankaus: presure|pg||
nt|algraves:  hmm|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ish taking his 6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes, one of the seldom acknowledged -- at ;east by the busy bidders -- disadvantages of the busy-bid style, is that declarer can then all too often place all cards early, ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ESPECIALLY if the overcall is raised. and if it hurts your side to have your overcall raised, maybe it isnt the best idea |pg||
nt|kareno: Well done for the push|pg||
nt|mrdct: so making this may not be enough to win the board if 5@hx goes for 800|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: does Mullamphy EVER claim?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was 105-59 to Courtney|pg||
nt|mrdct: good @d play by south to put declarer to the guess before he has discovery of the @SA and @HQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: worrying that @C will allow Verhees to elope his small trumpm|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: it's easy to see they might reach 3n on this hand in the other room though|pg||
nt|athene: east must duck the second diamond to kill the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  West's 3rd seat opener is not automatic by any means|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thanks all see some of you in 20 mins|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tommorrow the real excitement starts with the KO rounds|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: N&S both have winners|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: even if west does open, north might double then bid notrumps|pg||
pc|c8|nt|frankaus: bye all|pg||
nt|chilloncan: incidentally, my comments are not critiques from the other side, i am a very bisy bidder and am acknowledging the downside of that policy|pg||
nt|ritong: BACK IN 15 MINUTES OR SO|pg||
nt|ritong: oops|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  the last 5 10-board matches in the Swiss Qualifying   top 15 and  1 seed Yeh Bros then advance to KO phase|pg||
nt|mrdct: declarer going well so far|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: and now they are getting to game|pg||
nt|mrdct: about 1:50 until the next match with the lunch break now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|kareno: But what a swing at trick 2|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kareno: Goodnight from Las Vegas :)  Much more bridge to come!!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: 2 off now|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mrdct: bye for now|pg||
nt|frankaus: tu all 4 ur company|pg||
nt|kemperg: see you in 10 min.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|athene: i don't think you can overcall a 15-17 NT with 19, vul, at imps|pg||
nt|athene: the risk of missing 3n is just too high|pg||
nt|athene: especially with a third seat opener which might be light|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  9 where Burgess misguessed trump in 3@D    NS never in the auction   1@S by West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 1@S East  [after transfer response]|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mrdct: but didn't quite time the endplay in trumps on west - needed to cash the @DA earlier|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s5|nt|andy_h: Good play by Brown, holding his losses to one off|pg||
nt|andy_h: Certainly a possible pick up board, although I'm not sure if it will be enough|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: this could be a push with 3N going down -- will be interesting to see what happens at other tables|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mrdct: west claiming|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrdct: about 25 minutes till the next match i think|pg||
nt|kareno: Next match in about fifteen minutes - spectators, don't give up your seats!!|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|kemperg: Thanks Martin, Gonzalo, Gary, Bruce and specs|pg||
