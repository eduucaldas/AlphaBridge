mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: that´s ok, but will probably give some indication|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: E shd show a bit of slam potential here|pg||
mb|3D|an|GF|mb|p|nt|jwit: Seems as if 4H has a play without a diamond lead|pg||
mb|3S|an|cue|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: having red 2-suiter makes the hand ven more slam-friendly as W would declare in either strain, so possible protection of tenace in W hand|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: wd|pg||
nt|chick: East would declare in @Ds|pg||
nt|jwit: Not so great.  Club lead should defeat this contract|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: LOL yes i am cross-eyed today, ty cornelia !! LOL|pg||
nt|jwit: But 4H is down as well with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this contract fell on a transfer.....|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why is 4@h down? 1 @c and 2@h|pg||
nt|jwit: Diamond lead would beat 4H on a ruff|pg||
nt|jwit: Spade also|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry missed @sA:)|pg||
nt|jwit: That was a strange play ducking the club to the 10|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: are we sure a @d ruff beats 4@h?|pg||
nt|ritong: say @d lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if D is led against 4H, cant declarer just play both red aces and lead a spade toward king?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: On a @d lead win on hand and play a @s. Isn´t this enough?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: ruff comes in the long hand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jwit: Yes you are right. West should have passed 4H, since partner most probably is 6-4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|c3|pg||

nt|ritong: anyways, 3@s does not look correct|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: not sure i agree. E could have same hand and no jack of hearts, hearts go 4-1|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ritong: and, about these situations, there is an interesting gadget|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|nt|jwit: Partner rates to have decent hearts, and one trick less to take in 4H than 5D|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h4|pc|s5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ritong: "the other minor" to show double fit|pg||
mc|9|nt|marlowepi: it seems to me E is more or less obliged to bid 4H over 3S if 64|pg||

nt|jwit: Even with that holding, all you need is 3-2 trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: he could have worse hearts than that even|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: but pt well taken|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but one trick lower|pg||
nt|jwit: Now you are really being pessimistic lol|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|jwit: With worse hearts than that, he probably would have just used Texas and not introduced diamond suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: with a balanced hand, north just has to let this go|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: and hope for the best|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nice gadget henri...maybe works best if the "double-fit" bid is always 4C though....i.e. if second suit is clubs then 4D by opener shows club raise without a double fit. that way ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: responder has the most room when  there is the most scope for slam|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ritong: it is an invention from dano de falco|pg||

nt|ritong: south does not belong to the active tribe|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: by my lights, E has just enough for drury, esp if he can show 3 cards only|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i half agree with S, in that i would not open 1H or 1S:)|pg||
nt|jwit: I would have opened South hand nonvulnerable, even with 4-3-3-3 distribution.  Cards are pretty prime.|pg||
nt|ritong: meanwhile, ellingsen has taken an excellent decision|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec says 2S was -11 so essentially he has bid drury|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: sorry, 8-11, my keyboard failed me|pg||
nt|jwit: Good start for declarer.  Club lead might have made things a little more difficult|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once E shows druryish values, well on way to game. but having bid drury equivalent, E might well have passed 3D with no help there and only 3 trumps and minimum values|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: isn´t a trumph lead best for the defence?|pg||

mb|p|nt|jwit: Yes, should be another push|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes N will be disappointed to hear 2C|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even 4th best D beats 3N:)|pg||

nt|ritong: declarer can see that all OK with both important suits 3/2, so he should look for a counterplay if it is not the case|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: will probably take 2 hearts then cash one top club to see if anything interesting happens|pg||

nt|marlowepi: after 2 hearts, might play both club tops. if all follow, plain sailing. if S discards, also no poblem. if N discards, draw trumps forcing a discard from S|pg||

nt|ralfwil: makeable if declarer can find @dJ, but I don´t think so|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Fun to come?|pg||
mb|d!|mb|4S|nt|chick: this will be a real bidding war, spades will probably win|pg||
nt|jwit: North will double|pg||
nt|jwit: What will South do?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|chick: he'd better bid 5@H if he wants to keep this partner :)|pg||
nt|jwit: Tough to do on that suit|pg||
nt|chick: I think it would be tougher if he had any defensive values|pg||
nt|rodal f: P? But a bid wrong disrtibution|pg||
nt|jwit: 5H only a fair contract, and partner couldn't have a better hand for him|pg||
mb|5C|nt|marlowepi: presumably S is deciding between 4N and 5H|pg||
mb|5S|nt|chick: now the N X will be solid and S can pass|pg||
nt|jwit: Dbl again now, and this time South will pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont see what 5C achieves that 4N would not...maybe S worried that 4N would suggest only 3 clubs?|pg||

nt|jwit: These kids like to bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: w telling the whole story and N has to play @c for a drop|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Declarer will have to drop doubleton queen of clubs.  |pg||
pc|sK|nt|jwit: Once again not likely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: normally N would double 5S with 2 losers there, but he may be counting on S to have a spade control since S didnt pass 4SX...all highly speculative|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Play a @d in trick 2 and N can see  everything|pg||
nt|jwit: Very speculative with such a balanced hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but i meant my own conclusions about N thought processes are highly speculative:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Will E bid 5@s against 5@c with @sA, @dA and @cQ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a diamond to the king, winning, will not really reveal whereabouts of D ace|pg||
