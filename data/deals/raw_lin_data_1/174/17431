nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Last segment of 20 boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|viren169: Thks Roland|pg||
nt|kemperg: good morning all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Friede and Tomi|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: welcome back|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Actually a @c slam will work here, but will they get there?|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome Rashed|pg||
mb|d|nt|tomi2: transfers over transfers here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|tomi2: I dislike transfers over opps strong 1@C, it gives them extra room. a 2@H overcall would take away this room|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphb1: welcome for last match today|pg||
nt|xenya: just 2 of us here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back to Sofia |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are catching up, will get names in shortly etc |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|tomi2: Aronov was now able to shhow his clubs and a heart stopper while his partner showed his spades before 3@C|pg||
nt|baldfriede: They are on a good road for finding the slam.|pg||
nt|tomi2: if he had overvalled 2@H they would maybe bid 3@C and have only one of this information|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: This will be 1-off as the cards lie poorly for declarer.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome David|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphb1: welcome all|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sfoxa:  Hello Silvia and kibs|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: the downside of the 1@D overcall was, that they can plan on the @H finesse working now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand, 5@D would be a good contract for EW.|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||

nt|cicus: good lead, one entry taken away|pg||
nt|cicus: unless E takes this with the ace|pg||
nt|cicus: which also has its problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: he can play on clubs and still make it ..|pg||
nt|roswolf: if he plays on clubs he has an easy 9 tricks but he has alternatives|pg||
nt|ady: can certainly make knowing the hands    but no clear cut line|pg||
nt|cicus: shall he play @CA small @C?|pg||
nt|ady: how would he play on clubs   ace and another?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: I like A and @C more so that S has Kx and you want him on lead ;) |pg||
nt|cicus: what if S throws @CK under the A?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no small club ducked all round is better i think -he has no entry worries to his hand|pg||

mb|5D|nt|xenya: operator just catching up i guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is wrong with a 1N overcall by W?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Would you interfere with West now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: going to be much harder to get into auction later|pg||
mb|5S|nt|sybarra: was 1 nt raptor?  seems so |pg||
mb|6D|nt|viren169: a quick seq to 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: But funny also|pg||

nt|lestergold: Hi Friederike|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: hopefully we will have the players' names soon|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|kemperg: S has to decide iff @Cs are good |pg||
nt|xenya: slam is not easy to bid -- from S's perspective, N has to have at least @CKQxxxx for slam to be good|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have got in the first round|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: I would have expected 1nt too, but West might think it may be more fruitful to play against 1nt with his hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Max spot |pg||
nt|rodal f: Deer a @S more and? |pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: can he be sure of that -- yes he can|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, but he did:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: more important to tell partner whaty uve got as early as possible|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chilloncan: hi all, sorry i am a bit late, login problems|pg||
nt|viren169: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as low as possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this 2n bid by South?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @c8 is a big card here|pg||
nt|lestergold: what was wrong with 2@d doubled?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: nicely done|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Marshall:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kemperg: @H10 is usefull|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|baldfriede: That is overboard, in my opinion; W saw the reluctance of E to bid, so he can hardly expect 3nt to work.|pg||
nt|lestergold: grossly overbid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: The lead is helpful though.|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 2@d is not going down it is not likely that 2N isd making never mind 3 |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: another good slam missed here -- the first was on board 1|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: welcome all|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: note the low from doubleton |pg||

nt|rnmalik: partial max.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  as far as I know, Precision is popular in Bulgaria, so we'll see a lot of such 1@d opening|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: you are typing too fast for me|pg||

pc|sT|nt|rodal f: But it is a partnership deal. Would 2@D been stronger? I use to RD with a single @H or ...|pg||

nt|rodal f: Still end will be 4@H I belive|pg||

nt|tomi2: 2NT showing 6-4 here? I prefer this method to good-bad|pg||

nt|rado: 2NT inv only with 3+ fit 3@D = want to bid game but affraid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good switch.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E is quite minimum for a game invite and W also has a mere 7 LTC, so this is not the sort of auction one would want engraved on one's tombstone|pg||

nt|tomi2: I think south needed to shift to a club at trick 3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: not even a trump|pg||

nt|chilloncan: as expected, since if W had honor-jack in damonds doubleton, the hand is cold on the elimination despite 3 diamond losers|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find a @D lead...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sad to be in last chair with W hand|pg||
nt|xenya: @H9 was probably suit preference |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes that A@c neeeds to be knocked out quickly|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the basic idea is that a supporting hand is better if it contains primary cards OUTSIDE the trump suit and secondary honors IN the trump suit, rather than vice versa|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo E hand was good for 2@S only.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, it is an invitation by LTC standards, but i would certainly agree with 2S initially before i would approve the final raise to game|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kemperg: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@h looks makeable here as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: problem is that south may well play east for a singlweton @h in a @h contract|pg||

mb|2D|nt|chilloncan: although it seems W showed more than a minimum as well, which was not an accurate description|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Made as good as she could|pg||
nt|viren169: Great pressure bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: bad distribution, I would pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: 1@D nebuloues 1+card at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kemperg: so did he|pg||
nt|lestergold: both slams can make if the Q@h is picked |pg||
nt|lestergold: but I doubt if it will|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are 12 tricks available in either denomination with the A@d onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: 2@D art FG|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Not the best bid in the world...  but 12 tricks available here|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there is a lot less to be gained from this full-blooded pre-empt  once S has already shown her hearts. better to bid 3S and let partner judged whether or not to sacrifice. the one ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: thing that 4S does achieve, though, is to  make it harder for NS to find their diamond fit if that is where they belong|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the hand has potential for a swing for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1@D mean Silvia?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: on the actual hand S was always going to bid a slam, so the level of the preempt had no bearing on the outcome|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if W now bids 3S, E shd call 4S, not 3N|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: 1 @D looks like any 11 |pg||
nt|rodal f: Ok:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: being a coward, i also would have passed as S|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and I'm with E for his brave bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: his hand is very primey, and there may be commu niocation issues in NT, and there is a club weakness|pg||
nt|rado: at 3@S E may cue since he denyed @S supp earlier|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: so it looks a club sytem, probably a lot like polish club|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 1@D is 11-15p, 1+@D, no 5 cards @H/@S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|chilloncan: and it is likely that W has a club holding worth protecting, which is in fact the case. since E has a third heart, his tenace in that suit is not as vulnerable|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chilloncan: this contract will however also make|pg||
nt|chilloncan: thanks to spade 9 in dummy which prevents N from double-unblocking|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  his distribution allows it|pg||
nt|xenya: EW lead small from doubleton|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: yes, but he does have a good hand opposite pd's double|pg||
nt|chilloncan: oops|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  W's hand could have been better|pg||
nt|chilloncan: avoidance play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks with !K@H favourable.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if S continues clubs E has another stop, and if he switches there is time to knock out heart king even if S has it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: so either way 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if S pounds out clubs then club ten is ninth trick, no need to work on hearts|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4S also an easy make as cards lie|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S trying to decide who has club ten. on the auction it is surely Txxx with E|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: maybe he had a spade in with his club |pg||
nt|lestergold: well i got a prediction right|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Safe line for 11 tricks.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|rado: singl @s might be surprise for S and he might try quick entry in @H|pg||
nt|chilloncan: though S undoubtedly knows E better than i do|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: can "we" figure out the @D shift |pg||

nt|baldfriede: emergency*|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 amjor is cold as both majors behave very nicely|pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: 2@S is probably a 2-suiter, and N "knows" the other suit is @Ds? |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, NS reached 5@c|pg||

nt|lestergold: West with 9 points must feel that they should be in a gmae but where?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n ignoring the little matter of sourth'slead directing x|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont know but I think south would ahve been on lead vs any contract that could ever be reached|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho south is on lead if theyc play here|pg||

nt|tomi2: if they play pass= no stopper, they will reach 4@H now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  so, no @d cue, that should be the end of bidding|pg||
nt|viren169: this wont be pretty... |pg||

nt|chilloncan: long club suit with holes in it and E has a fittinmg hand|pg||
nt|chilloncan: or else responder just has to guess and bid game with 6-7 HCP and long clubs after opener rebids 3C|pg||

nt|baldfriede: Yes, but with the precision both play it will be interesting to see the bidding.|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  +1 after @c start and return|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant see a real;istiv play for 3N|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: 4@D came by the control she had after pard showing a very strong hand.|pg||
nt|viren169: West bidding the spots of the cards!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: EW close to 4S |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: this should beat it?|pg||

nt|isp: Good try , 5@c  would be much wiser here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Now 9 tricks for declarer.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and obviouly unclear about what the 8¬@d meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: I should have added will go off on all switches after a @d lead but not on a @d continuation!!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well done.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: quite a recovery|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|cicus: if played by S W would have found @S lead for down 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: 9HP but nice cards at E|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: and forcing raise is? |pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 made 14IMP for DBI 3NT-here 4@S-3OR|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec tells me 4 players won bronze at last Bermuda:)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: A spec suggested that @d6 was the wrong signal from Sotuh.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: may bid one spade "on the way" |pg||
nt|chilloncan: W did brilliantly to play seven of spades on the trump lead from S, clearly seeing his only remaining chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: hi all, I thought I might as well join until Poland gets to play|pg||
nt|xenya: welcome Gabor|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Gabor|pg||
mb|4H|nt|baldfriede: South*|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well there was either a wrong card by south or a wrong interpretation of it by north that is logically indisputable|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  seesm, NS have well developed system|pg||
nt|chilloncan: tremendously lucky to ctach 1-1 in N hand, but he was ready to take dvantage of his luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: nicely done... by E/W again|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: If end 4@H,    will W duck @S from S?|pg||
nt|viren169: 2N by West a possibility|pg||
nt|xenya: slam on a non-spade lead here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but also the bidding said suirely have u got a @d guard if so please bid 3n yes ui have|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: we shall see |pg||
nt|sybarra: hts break makes more intereting |pg||
nt|rodal f: Liked Pancheva's pass if pard re opened.|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe it is conventional for E/W|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|viren169: yes... 4333 is not a good shape for trick taking|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: should believe oppos on occasions ...indeed on most occasions in my experience|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: hmm, I would have inserted a @H bid as West|pg||
nt|xenya: E's double probably shows a minor 2-suiter |pg||
nt|cicus: to aid E with the lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so am I - now E has to lead being blind|pg||
nt|xenya: oh just clubs it says|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh dear |pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  actually, @d start creates a lot of problem for declarer as well|pg||
nt|cicus: of course the mainproblem is the very limited number of tricks available|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  right time to play @h Q|pg||
nt|xenya: the cards are very unfriendly here |pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: the range of 1NT probably did not allow S to pass it and N is probably not minimum|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: anything will do at this point|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting @Cs also. 10X at W|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sfoxa:  after this bidding, W is sure partner has 2 hearts at least|pg||
nt|xenya: even a spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: he ducked ok, but N did not put the K up |pg||
nt|rodal f: I understand him.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and understandable, since E was the bidder|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even if E didn't bid it's normaly free to duck|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D ruff will come a time so need to find the @C.|pg||
nt|po-s: not necessarily|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HQ?|pg||
nt|po-s: he can ruff three spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Blind chicken find food sometime:)|pg||

pc|h3|nt|po-s: now it will be easy|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cicus: time for a @H swith to ensure 2 down|pg||
nt|xenya: however NS do have game-going values, so the unhappy result will probably be duplicated|pg||
nt|cicus: @H7 does not seem to help|pg||
nt|cicus: unless theencourage with odd cards of course|pg||
nt|cicus: E can see all odd cards below the 7|pg||
nt|xenya: also E can cash a diamond and exit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hard point for E - cashing @d he provides declarer with a trick, bearing @d he provides himself with throw-in|pg||
nt|po-s: ruff spade,heart to nine, spade ruff, club ace, diamond ruff, high spade ruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: B12 4@S= at OR and 12IMP for I-VVU|pg||
nt|po-s: this was more dangerous|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Well done by E/W here.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rado: criss-cross @H@C now:)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: making declarer solve his problems on his own|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Still. If E is 0-5HP even more often. Pass is correct. N was by that time unlimited.|pg||
