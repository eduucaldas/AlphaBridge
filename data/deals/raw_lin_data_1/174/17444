mb|p|nt|kemperg: has to find Hx|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|cicus: probably key.card response so no slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: mighty simple bidding if it stays here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: tht it might have ended up overboard the way the auction was going|pg||
nt|patricck: If partner wasn't going to raise to 4@S (which they should with 2) then hard to see how 4@S won't have at least 4 losers, whereas 4@D might be making.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|patricck: well this should be a small gain for PD....  they all help|pg||
pc|c5|nt|shevek: as the cards lie, 4@h can be made, but hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|patricck: singleton Q@S is of course an unusual exception|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|patricck: the difference between 7 and 8 tricks is nothing, both are 4 Imps.....need 9 tricks to get an extra Imp|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|patricck: If Partner has KQ@D and a small singleton spade then 4@D would be making and 4@S would have no chance, far more likely than the actual hand|pg||

mb|p|pc|cA|nt|cicus: I'm sure W is bidding  out his distribution|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like there should be no trouble making 6 on this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  all declarer will have to do is time the @c ruff correctly|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  @h to Q, @d to A and @h to J, then play 3 rounds of @cs and ruff|pg||
nt|patricck: 10 Imps to PD from Board 22, the difference is now 34|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: i wouldnt fancy this as declarer|pg||
nt|cicus: good lead, one entry taken away|pg||
nt|cicus: unless E takes this with the ace|pg||
nt|cicus: which also has its problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: he can play on clubs and still make it ..|pg||
nt|roswolf: if he plays on clubs he has an easy 9 tricks but he has alternatives|pg||
nt|ady: can certainly make knowing the hands    but no clear cut line|pg||
nt|cicus: shall he play @CA small @C?|pg||
nt|ady: how would he play on clubs   ace and another?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: I like A and @C more so that S has Kx and you want him on lead ;) |pg||
nt|cicus: what if S throws @CK under the A?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no small club ducked all round is better i think -he has no entry worries to his hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kemperg: will do that, they play well|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: absolutely correct line andy :)|pg||

nt|cicus: to create a problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: very interesting hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: very difficult for the declarer for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: most hands are interesting - getting them right is difficult but instructive|pg||
nt|andyv:  but not done:)|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|ady: 10@S lead in CR   won by east  and a heart  south wone with ace and continued spades   east won and played a low diamond   and from there could not be beaten|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer will be relieved|pg||
nt|cicus: I think S must know partner has @HQ - why id declarer not play on @Hs?|pg||

nt|roswolf: this wont help their cause|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm sure South won't like his quacks, but hard not to bid with that shape|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  I wonder in what system|pg||
nt|patricck: if you can throw a @H after setting up a @D, then the fortunate @C position might be enough|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  here, they may find 6@s|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, very true|pg||
nt|r_tibre: right.. and can be reasonably sure the contract will be duplicated|pg||
pc|dK|nt|shevek: entries might be a problem for declarer|pg||
pc|d8|nt|patricck: In the other room they failed because they never led a club to the 19 while they were in hand|pg||
nt|patricck: a club to the 10 :)|pg||
nt|shevek: clear cut :)|pg||
nt|patricck: I just made the game a whole lot harder.... 19 cards per suit :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  the 4-1 break should doom it|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzku: brave 1NT overcall |pg||
nt|vugraphzku: W has only 13 points|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 14 sry|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT vul with 14 HCP - and what a success!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes earnt a swing for his team|pg||
nt|ady: can really fault the lead    unforunate|pg||
nt|cicus: on a major suit lead 4 tricks difference|pg||
nt|roswolf: the die seems cast|pg||
nt|cicus: simply incredible, that 1NT - it would not occur to me even after thinking a week|pg||
nt|roswolf: cometh the hour cometh the man|pg||
nt|patricck: North's values being KQ@C and one other card are the worst possible from declarer's point of view|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  and 6@h has no play|pg||
nt|andyv:  flannery people (Roland's favorite opening), would have to problem getting to 6@s|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kemperg: NS in OR will be pleased with the result|pg||
nt|andyv:  so despite missing game and slam, Poddar will get imps out of this|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|shevek: I think he'll make it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: to bid that at this time takes a lot of courage|pg||

nt|shevek: very poor slam|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm....that is one way of looking at....I'd prefer to say that they were lucky to make an anti-percentage slam|pg||
nt|shevek: on the @h finesse and 3-2|pg||
nt|patricck: no, it isn't quite as bad as that because the @H pips give you extra chances|pg||
nt|patricck: K@H onside, or J10@H onside|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: time is running out for G-DKR|pg||

nt|patricck: I don't think there is any way back for PD now, even if they bid the grand here|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|patricck: yes, still less than 50%..... but quite a bit better than 34% which is K@H and the 3-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  pretty decent slam here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: spade lead  might have a chance for defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 20-25 minutes almost as being on time in India where time is not much of an issue|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|cicus: it may be a @H|pg||

nt|cicus: @H lead requires less support from partner|pg||
nt|ady: still not a definate make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|cicus: he might as well lead his suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tell them that they are off two keycards for spades and that they should stop in 4, then give them 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead only thing that makes it difficult|pg||
mb|5H|nt|cicus: now Nanev already knows there are no 5-carders against him|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: This is excruciatingly slow|pg||
nt|patricck: 57 to recover now|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|ady: even on this lead  might try spade finesse for 9th trick   still not home|pg||
nt|cicus: might duck @H10 first|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: @H ducks seems safe enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|ady: well if defence wins heart   and cash clubs and play spade from south   then what?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|shevek: In bd 3, 4 & 5 Shrikant got 37 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: if I-VVU wins, who is going to be the 3rd pair?|pg||
nt|cicus: a valid point, David|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: how do you cash clubs? no it is safety again to raise with the A|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|ady: sorry   since south has won heart needs spade now|pg||
nt|patricck: There are vacant spaces issues which complicate the maths, but I'll take a stab at 43%|pg||
pc|s8|nt|shevek: ok, patrick I go with that :)|pg||
nt|shevek: so much for our analysis|pg||
pc|s6|nt|patricck: after finding that South has only 1 spade and 2 hearts it should be easy to guess to finesse the Q@D that way|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|patricck: South will be known to have 10 minor suit cards to North's 5 which essentially gives you 2 to 1 odds|pg||

pc|c4|nt|patricck: ah, finally|pg||

pc|c2|nt|r_tibre: @C discards by N putting additional pressure on S?|pg||

nt|psyck: 3@c 1st too aggresive, others a possibility|pg||
mc|10|nt|panja: true..a good partnership should have assigned meaning to each one of them|pg||
nt|vicky888:  well usually on tranfer bids, X shows stolen bid .. in this case balanced hand with 15-18 range and bid of the transfered suit is takeout for that suit|pg||
nt|vicky888:  so i would bid 3@c|pg||
nt|psyck: i afree about the x, but i prefer actual seq to 3@c 1st time which i thing should be a stronger t/o|pg||
nt|psyck: tough to incorporate defenses against most of opps sequences, so as vicky points out, a generic understanding like that is invluable|pg||
nt|vicky888:  now from the next board onwards we would have the result from other room and it would be more interesting :)|pg||
nt|vicky888:  no... he isnt even related to him|pg||

nt|psyck: ya, toiletgate was quite famoud :)|pg||
nt|psyck: people still joke about it whenever Topalov plays|pg||
nt|panja: Chess players are pretty unfortunate in that respect, 'ethics' does not give them much chance......|pg||
nt|panja: in Bridge you can blame your loss on pauses, lie of cards, so many excuses...|pg||
nt|vicky888:  true... we r fortunate on that front ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: Chess is a game of complete information...in Bridge , in addition to skill, there are luck, psychology & other factors involved|pg||
nt|psyck: Edgar Alan Poe compared Chess & Bridge in the 1st few pages of 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue"...an interesting read|pg||

nt|cicus: strong 6-card suit, balanced maximum|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kaubash in the other room was 99% certain that he could beat 5@H because partner had shown diamonds, so he doubled and did indeed defeat it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|patricck: taking the money in 4@C doubled was the best option, 4@H may lose 2@S, 1@D and 1@C, not to mention the @H situation|pg||
nt|patricck: An easy decision for Choti really.... he would feel sure that the chasing team will be bound to try 3NT on his hand, so he wants to do the same thing|pg||
