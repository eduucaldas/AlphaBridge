nt|jcomyn: who backs out first|pg||
nt|paulg:  unlike the first half, I guess NS will stay quiet and leave EW to themselves|pg||
nt|lark20: Could it be East/West's turn to have the points?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: grind to a halt in 4s i guess|pg||
nt|paulg:  Spades always win|pg||
nt|paulg:  and the likely heart lead will make it simple to play|pg||
nt|jcomyn: problem is round and round they go and where will it stop|pg||
nt|lark20: Should be a nice start for Yvonne|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d-1@s-2@c-4@s?|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hello from manchester|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi all & welcome|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: Good evening all.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator, if you take initials away we could get full surnames in|pg||
mb|d|nt|benjy: Good afternoon Everyone|pg||
nt|odysseus69: delighted to see Dinah Caplan in action- a youthful 78 year old making her International debut with my good friend Lizzie Godfrey|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The Irish ladies got a bit of a shellacking in the first set. Let us see if they can recover |pg||
nt|petepunt: scotaln 58,  Ireland 57 Enf 49|pg||
nt|Walddk5: That is certainly better|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hello all |pg||
nt|baldfriede: Convention cards can be viewed here:|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: 4s not a bad sacrifice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a small select group watching here :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: a strong 1H  but they dont paly strong 2s or Benji  so no choice|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4H is a good spot|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It applies to North and West|pg||
nt|baldfriede: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/ladymilneteams.html|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk5: Hello Shirley and Peter|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am Friederike Greifswald-Tolleson, your commentator for this match.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|petepunt: Good aftenoon Shirly and all|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  hard for EW to get into the auction though |pg||
nt|petepunt: any scores roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: mjkousy 2h|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless 2@h is getting passed out|pg||
nt|simonx:  For the English, they need to win by 59 IMPs to get a maximum 25 VPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @c is a splinter |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Peter |pg||
nt|Walddk5: England +9 against Scotland|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jcomyn: indeed|pg||
nt|benjy: Hi Victor|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @H a cue bid |pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcomyn: ooips|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: mmm...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: LIZZZZZZZ|pg||
nt|paulg:  automatic for McGowan to balance|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but irish not there yet|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Victor and Ben|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 hearts is a lucky make but not one to bid|pg||
nt|petepunt: West has a ood hand but single @H & @S arent worth much  so 3@C  might hav ebeen enough|pg||
nt|petepunt: i like the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk5: NIBU +14 against Ireland|pg||
nt|sybarra: good auction indeed  |pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: hello all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any preferences for double rather than 3@h?|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s is trusting the opponents too much |pg||
nt|sybarra: a @D cue and off to the races |pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: bidding screeemd aout for a @D lead though :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may be case of cash'em of dont get'em|pg||
nt|baldfriede: One level too high.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: surely have to bid 4s|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: almost...|pg||
nt|paulg:  a little more sophisticated but a sound auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so no chanc e of going wrong|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But understandable.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg:  Punch knows it is a 4-4 fit, so unlikely to sacrifice at this vul|pg||
nt|paulg:  the Irish stopped in 2@h, why sacrifice?|pg||
nt|paulg:  A small spade lead would be testing|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch must feel N/S are already pushed beyond their limits|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: yea s lead some guess|pg||
nt|benjy: Indeed, 4@H is not a game you really want to be in looking at the two hands|pg||
nt|benjy: But it would make|pg||
nt|petepunt: still par result 5@C minis 2 as not reasonable to pass 1H|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Current rankings -- based on first three matches and half-time scores in current matches at  http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|petepunt: in fairenss these 2 pairs have played in nearly all the sets so far so expect tiredness ot creep in during the last match|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello|pg||
nt|larrymori: I would rather bid 4 than 3 so X allows 3@h after a minor|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|jcomyn: next hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: all ladies!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: men leave the room please :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: nah, letskeep a few of them :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree - even in these unenlightened days, 2@h over 1@s should show a decent hand |pg||
nt|simonx:  England's main loss in the first half was reopening the bidding when the oppo had stopped in 2@c.  They then got to 5@c and made it.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mikeirl: 3nt was the spot, not easy|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|benjy: Godfrey was heavy for 2@H but not close to a 3@H call in my opinion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and more of the same here - EW could have defended 3@h and now they are defending a making 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or a should-be-making 4@h, anyway|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hard to find with  %-$ 1S FIT:|pg||
nt|baldfriede: %-$|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 5-4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|mamos: sorry good morning|pg||
nt|petepunt: morning Mike|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|petepunt: not so long ago we played only 90 boards over 2 days now it is much more over 3 days.  |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|paulg:  still on a spade guess, but West would probably lead from the queen|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2 hearts in a loud voice used to describe this - bidding boxes dont give the samr opportunity|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: the welsh ladies playing acol with a weak NT (of course)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|paulg:  although she can pin the @dJ|pg||
nt|petepunt: just gave scores scot first CBAI 2nd|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: indeed|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg:  back to guess|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|paulg:  but Liz would have overcalled with the ace of spades|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Trying for a squeeze which will not work.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good guesser|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
mc|9|pg||

nt|paulg:  EW will be sacrificing on this hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but nthere is here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Of course Yvonne will have been on vugraph a few times before, as Scotland vs England is often shown from the Peggy Bayer (U20) match|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also from the Junior Europeans|pg||
nt|odysseus69: slam time|pg||
nt|kemperg: this is interesting|pg||
nt|simonx:  Known as  Biltcliffe Coup to some ... reopen a aprtscore and then they make game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, no, no - you have to double the game as well|pg||
nt|simonx:  ... and some say you have to double AND misdefend|pg||
nt|mamos: took me a while to find the right room|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzbt: DHAMPUR SUGER 109 , R L KAJRIWAL 112, a BAGARIA 82|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well should nagainst vul opposition|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that was a good save against 4@H |pg||
nt|benjy: Looks like 6@D/@C is a make |pg||
mb|4S|nt|odysseus69: 1c-1d-3d and they will bid it smoothly|pg||
nt|petepunt: its the one with the blue&red door :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzbt: MMRMC 102,   BIMAL SIKKA 86|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hefty 3s|pg||
nt|paulg:  although that opening would put most off|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1c -1d-2d and???|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that board probably flat - a more, how can we put it, appreciative auction should get to 4@h anyway  |pg||
nt|mamos: ty|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@D save is tough to reach|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: probably not biddable |pg||
nt|odysseus69: key moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: will see if the other room gets into the bidding (last hand) |pg||
nt|petepunt: many would open the East hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|benjy: I think south should bid 3@D and then north 3@H|pg||
nt|kemperg: now its on|pg||
nt|benjy: What is south going to do over that?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to get there now and I agree about 3D|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: best she can do|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: W made of sterner stuff :)|pg||
nt|larrymori: it would be something to reach 4@s here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzbb: South thinking...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6 loser hand yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: when goes 4 @H  E might bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: guess not|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Giood sac against the 4@h.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: BANEET 93,    MMSNEHA  86|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont be tested but ew will be in the open room|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@S to keep 3NT in the game? Remember South doesn't know that partner has a slam try yet|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg:  Liz has a big hand opposite a 4@d overcall, but few tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: perhaps thinking she should have opened 4...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch did will to pave the way for a sacrifice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: irish pair very aggressive bidders in there|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@H could just be looking for 3NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: undo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c fourth suit. Not normally game-forcing by a passed hand|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@d now?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: so probably 2@h form North, and then South will have to take a view|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: NS fit very well|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: anyone like the X of 2@C?  I'm not sure I'd want a club lead (even if S were on lead)|pg||
nt|benjy: Wow 3NT is a huge underbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S would be a good description |pg||
nt|petepunt: s has done well here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: 3nt is pusillanimous from North - confident that English pair will bid this|pg||
nt|kemperg: not good:((|pg||
nt|benjy: South has a minimum 3@D bid and slam is cold, 3NT is also a terrible spot, if the @SQ loses you go down in 3NT when you make 6@D|pg||
nt|larrymori: 2@s with the good @ss would have been worth a try|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but South has passed - not unreasonable|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 nt was an option also |pg||
nt|sybarra: (for minors) |pg||
nt|baldfriede: But no longer.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lark20: I thought Yvonne would have bid 3H here|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess that they don't play checkback, as you might invite with the West hand|pg||
nt|mamos: those Aces are worth a lot|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzbb: a rather stingy 9@C...|pg||
nt|petepunt: its 'the fit' that makes this good|pg||
pc|d5|nt|odysseus69: from Norths positon a grand was close than 3NT |pg||
nt|baldfriede: Since opponents found the best defense.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont mind it, sometimes keeps them out of 3NT ( which is sometimes good - or bad)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now dangerous to finesse trumps|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may make the play of hts different |pg||
nt|sybarra: like cashing of AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes bash them out and get a nice surprise|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|baldfriede: Oops.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petepunt: if S had long @C they would subside in 2@D so I like the auction|pg||
nt|mikeirl: lucly Maty|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|paulg:  again, it is non-vulnerable so the rewards are not so great|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Rory Timlin|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and patsy meehan is west in the open room and will be in 4h|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Mary|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: oh dear now it's down|pg||
nt|kemperg: can't believe that 3NT from N|pg||
pc|cK|nt|benjy: North had a slam drive|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d6|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to John Adams|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hello|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and Michael MacDonagh|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|sybarra: and not -2 |pg||
nt|mamos: easy game :)   well done|pg||
pc|s5|nt|benjy: Hopefully this will be a slam swing for England, time will tell|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
mc|10|nt|sybarra: *now |pg||
nt|simonx:  For the non-English - Dinah Caplan is 78 years old.  She and Lizzie Godfrey were the surprise at the trials.  They led most of the way and won handsomely|pg||
nt|kjadams: Thanks Roland,  Hi Michael|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi & welcome all|pg||
