nt|sybarra: 4 @h looks like normal spot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then I don't want to know what an abnormal 4@H is|pg||
nt|mdgraham: are they playing with special cards? ace=6, king=5, and so on?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we can see the auction at the other table |pg||
nt|sybarra: *can not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, we are lucky|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@h doesn't look too bad. Needs a couple of breaks and finesses|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: what about the 4 top tricks EW have|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Hardly a surprise that @CK is rubbish|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe e/w were not in the auction in the other room, (or only the overcall maybe) |pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  Unless they also play with verve and flair, I would guess it went three passes to 1@s, and either East overcalled 2@c which got doubled or S responded 1N and raised 2@h to 3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East overcalled 2@C in the other room, it might be about time to sell @CK for 25 øre|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If anyone is stupid enough to buy it at that price|pg||
nt|henryb:  I bid 2 ore|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent|pg||
nt|Walddk2: that coin went out of business in the 60's|pg||
nt|mdgraham: how much is an ore?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: 1/100th of 1 krone|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 1 krone is 10p|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|henryb:  What is the smallest modern coin? 5 or 10?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In Denmark it's 50 øre, not sure about Norway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: In England, one penny - 1/100 of a pound|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: nice result in the other room |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 25 øre coin left us in 2009|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Also 50 øre in Norway I am told|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  there is constant talk here about doing away with the penny|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: two rounds of diamonds would be awkward against 6@h|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: with out @D cue, N hand looking better |pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  South has to figure out at some point that all his cards are working|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s is presumably a cuebid in support of clubs|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe deciding hts v club slam|pg||
nt|henryb:  Mike, since Declarer would have no reason to suspect 6-1 diamonds he would ruff low, and be pleasantly surprised when East could not over ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has to find the @DQ to give North a problem|pg||
