mb|2S|mb|d|mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|april7: 4 @S will go down on a @C lead ofcourse 2but 4 @H will make for EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: At the othe table South responded 2@c. North got a bit enthusiastic after that |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: here, of course, it is a bit of a different story - EW have got into the act|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||

nt|jcomyn: who backs out first|pg||
nt|paulg:  unlike the first half, I guess NS will stay quiet and leave EW to themselves|pg||
nt|lark20: Could it be East/West's turn to have the points?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: grind to a halt in 4s i guess|pg||
nt|paulg:  Spades always win|pg||
nt|paulg:  and the likely heart lead will make it simple to play|pg||
nt|jcomyn: problem is round and round they go and where will it stop|pg||
nt|lark20: Should be a nice start for Yvonne|pg||

nt|jcomyn: so no chanc e of going wrong|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg:  Punch knows it is a 4-4 fit, so unlikely to sacrifice at this vul|pg||
nt|paulg:  the Irish stopped in 2@h, why sacrifice?|pg||
nt|paulg:  A small spade lead would be testing|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont mind it, sometimes keeps them out of 3NT ( which is sometimes good - or bad)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now dangerous to finesse trumps|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|paulg:  this is why I would have upgraded, it justs feel too good for a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|paulg:  I am told that EW play weak jump shifts and checkback, so 2@h was mildly invitational|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|golfsquash: Will the Irish bid and make the tight game this time?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doubt it|pg||

nt|paulg:  as it happens this seems to be one of those times when partner does have eight tricks in notrump|pg||

nt|paulg:  In the other matches, Northern Ireland are beating NIBU by 8 imps and England lead Wales by 7 imps|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3nt|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@H rather|pg||
nt|simonr: I suspect 2@C and then a delayed game raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|paulg:  maybe McGowan/Punch overcall any 5-card major?|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  naturally you run to your other major|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i mean the s hand is big enough to look fo a chance, but not opposite thast hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: South should have signed in 4@H and denied a @D control - if that is the methods|pg||

nt|paulg:  West was squeezed I think, in a strange way|pg||

nt|paulg:  -2 was possible, but non-vulnerable in a long competition it is often not worth the mental effort|pg||
nt|paulg:  save it for something important|pg||
nt|paulg:  Another hand where North will have 16 points and might see both opponents bid first|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes and with 16+9 where do they go|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: short break here...restarting in a moment|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Scotland getting their game swing back on 23 as they managed to cash the first five clubs|pg||
nt|chick: looks like a relatively easy 4@H|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: sure they did so would my cat|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes especially from the W side |pg||
mb|2C|nt|simonr: South is horrible if you play 5 card majors - fortunately they play 4 |pg||

mb|2N!|nt|jcomyn: wont try 4h now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|paulg:  a spade lead may not seem so obvious to McQuaker|pg||

nt|baldfriede: I saw no sign so far that they play ACOL style.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: too true|pg||

nt|jcomyn: also true|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: oh well should have known what onishuk would do|pg||

nt|paulg:  it has been suggested that the EW pairs are struggling with this bombardment of games from NS|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Maybe they changed that.|pg||
nt|simonr: This is the only clue you might have - http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/ingham-woodruff.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but I don't think you'll find that EW could beat that last game if declarer gets the ending right|pg||
nt|greerm: re|pg||
nt|simonr: If North is going to bid on they 3@C is surely more descriptive|pg||
nt|greerm: rest of systems here http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/ladymilneteams.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: actually looking,  doesnt seem to matter which side|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|lark20: Still no score for East West|pg||

nt|mdgraham: somehow that doesn't look like a 20-count |pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  i expect the same auction in the other room to this point, now a question of evaluating the East hand|pg||

nt|baldfriede: No inverted minors.|pg||

nt|paulg:  games need to be 50% to be worth bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: i think so...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you would be amazed at the number of players whon regard 2c as a WEAK bid and have to jumpm - crazy as it seems|pg||
nt|lark20: 2@C just may not be forcing in their system|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  2@c is not forcing in my system, but I don't expect to miss game with a singleton heart if partner passes|pg||

nt|mdgraham: two spades and a diamond|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  firts round finesse|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not so attractive to finesse of course when you cannot afford to cash one top card first|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, but why would you do that - unless you take the view that East has long hearts, therefore shorter clubs|pg||
nt|april7: N has actually 9 tricks but the @C finesse a big question!!!women intuition again???|pg||

nt|paulg:  and, as most Scots will know, Ms Punch is not the fastest player in the country|pg||
nt|paulg:  sometimes you look at your scorecard and just see a small -3 imps and not worry, but I guess the Scotland captain may wonder how his pair bid freely to their 5-1 fit on board 25|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|simonr: There was a similar hand to South's last night - lots of debate as to what to open|pg||
nt|greerm: I love these big hands with no obvious bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|greerm: for those of us who don't play strong @C that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  if I were npc I might suggest that they slow down a little|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|simonr: Treating it as a GF in @H or 23+ balanced|pg||
nt|chick: NS playing Weak NT, so 1N now shows 15-17|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S might prefer to play in clubs |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but she doesnt know N clubs are as good as they are|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: thats enough|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|simonr: GF in @H - partner will exepct a better suit! But if you bid 2NT partner is not expecting a singleton|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ENOUGH ena|pg||
nt|greerm: not everybody's choice the 4@H but a difficult hand to bid|pg||
pc|h6|nt|greerm: @C leads best |pg||
nt|simonr: No entry to table for the spades so will drift a couple off|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Communication problems for declarer.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|paulg:  Surprised South did not continue with 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: seems better than 3@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a very good game missed|pg||
nt|lark20: 3@D would have been more helpful|pg||
nt|paulg:  over 3@d North would have a tough decision|pg||
nt|paulg:  easy to pass 3@s with no controls to speak of|pg||
pc|h8|nt|paulg:  and only three points in partner's suits|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: fun here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: late chance for ireland to reduce arrears|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  a club continuation will hold this to nine tricks, as spades are 4-2|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps a takeout double of 2@s by Yvonne is a better way to get her hand across|pg||
nt|paulg:  then she would not feel obliged to bid over 3@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i dont understand why they do not play in their 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  because they need 11 tricks for game in that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this major mania is killing our game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I didnt say anything a\bout a game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and in any case nobody is doubling 5d|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lark20: Teams means Games|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  given East's initial pass|pg||

nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, John Comyn and Beryl Campbell, for their peceptive comments and to all the kibitzers for the assistance.|pg||
nt|paulg:  We will be back in about 35 minutes for the second half of this match.|pg||
nt|paulg:  another pretty tough hand for EW to deal with|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg:  but the lack of values and misfit will probably steer them to 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless South wanders in?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 27,  the 6 nt played from the other side in OR,  -1 |pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|jcomyn: tx paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  they might bid game here|pg||
nt|simonr: I suspect a weak NT from South and an invite from North via a transfer. South should accept with AJx support and two aces |pg||
nt|chick: yes, from the other side, but the play went similiarly, and East pitched 2 hearts and saved her 4 clubs!|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|greerm: there's an acol type Fred?|pg||
nt|greerm: weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lark20: Thank you Paul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: finn is thanking her lucky stars|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes  but might be easier on a @D lead? |pg||
pc|d4|nt|chick: don't see why, won the diamond, took the spade finesse, and cashed all spades and diamonds, essentially the same as here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: I think the clue is no ht lead |pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg:  and probably needs a club lead to let it through|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lark20: With such a poor suit it was a good disciplined pass by South|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest I'd have bid 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: the other room might see a 3@H overcall...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it was paul who thought she might i knew she wouldnt |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: her mixed partner would have her guts for garters, so she didnt|pg||
nt|lark20: I would probably have bid 2@H as well and then been disappointed when my partner led the suit:)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: count on the @D early |pg||
nt|sybarra: count on the hand actually |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|baldfriede: She will probably misguess Q@s.|pg||
nt|simonr: Might go down if declarer gets trumps wrong - should play to ruff a diamond so E/W might help with trumps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|paulg:  the double club finesse is liz's only chance of making this|pg||

pc|s9|pc|h5|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h2|nt|greerm: more awkward to get the trump finesse right now, probably no overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: thinking..|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|d9|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
