mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|idc: Remember the table motto: we're not at home to Mr Give-Up|pg||
nt|007 joosth: supportdouble?|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 3H rather unusual as long S does not know how many spades N has|pg||
nt|idc: I was coaching a pair recently about this treatment: you can't play Unassuming Cue-bids by opening bidder|pg||
nt|idc: e.g. 3@h here to show a full value raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a reasonable 4S missed now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: well at least 4H will be 1 off|pg||
nt|idc: West has done well to put pressure on with the 4@h bid|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|chick: South certainly has a full value raise, but North has nothing more to offer, so I think 4S might be hard to find|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed   but the main problem is that S does not know how many spades are in N|pg||
nt|idc: and some work to be done - not sure you will make 4@s to be honest|pg||
nt|007 joosth: lucky for them is the 41 break in spades     4S will be almost impossible |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|idc: but they would have missed it opposite some better North hands|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|007 joosth: or  spades 3-2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d5|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|idc: not unlike last hand - SOuth strongish, North min, this time 4@s is on|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|idc: May need a transfer break to get there|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|eggy: Quite a few loyalists in east Belfast :)|pg||

nt|007 joosth: I suppose 3Nt again|pg||
mb|1D|nt|007 joosth: but not really cold|pg||
mb|1H|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: very light 1H  but also very useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: another easy 3N, even with a heart lead, because diamond entry in wrong hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|007 joosth: yes but a club switch will cause difficulties maybe|pg||
nt|idc: Maybe defence can give South a @c guess later, when they have 2 hearts & a diamond in the bag|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe 2H 2C and 1D looser then|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|idc: perhaps declarer should forget about diamonds, play on clubs herself|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|007 joosth: I think S should have taken this trick|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: if W wins the diamond and switches to a club, S has no choice but to go up with the K.  East has the hearts, and there are two cards to lose to if play low, and only one if play ...|pg||
nt|chick: the K.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|idc: If hearts were running that's true, but they aren't, so a guess|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|007 joosth: small spade will be lavinthal   asking 4 a small club|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the 4 is the wrong card|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h6|pc|c8|nt|007 joosth: but still not 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s8|pc|cT|nt|idc: card says first priority on discard is suit preference, i guess @s2 clearer|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sT|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some sort of squeeze possible when S oplays a spade now|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c7|nt|007 joosth: to long thinking here?|pg||
nt|idc: indeed - a stepping stone variant?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||

pc|h8|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|007 joosth: sure|pg||
nt|idc: now position is what Cornelia was describing, as declarer couldn't afford to let East in|pg||

nt|Walddk2: One can always hope|pg||
nt|jtr: Lucky it is late night shopping|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: its nerve racking for operator:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@h needs some playing|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|eggy: It's a shame, but when your computer is flaky, it's hard for the operator to find time to make corrections|pg||
nt|jtr: Drury|pg||
nt|jtr: 4 cards support 7-10|pg||
nt|jtr: Just bid game|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jtr: Max but bad @cs for south|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jtr: Needs too much for slam|pg||
nt|jtr: If she was thinking of that 4@d was a better try|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: @s lead would help a lot|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jtr: Trump looks normal though|pg||

nt|eggy: unfortunately I think the leimnation needs a 3rd round of trumps so may have to play the first club towards dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: yes it does now|pg||
nt|eggy: but the spade position will show up, |pg||

nt|idc: but unless we have a misclick, declarer failed at the last hurdle, pity|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well in fact the wrong guessing was silly now  for E only had 2 cards|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the only chance that the 2d was not the ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|007 joosth: S played for the chance that East had only 1 card left instead of 2|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: though some work will have to be done|pg||

nt|chick: well, 2 red doubletons is nothing to be pushy with|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|chick: 1N doesn't have to promise a red AK|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2S can be 10 or 11 hcp|pg||
nt|idc: If you don't feel the spades are strong enough for that, 2@c is a possible alternative, then make a further try if partner doesn't pass|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed 2C will normally be passed only with 5 clubs and weak hand.   as Lawrence suggests|pg||

nt|chick: I like 2@S and I think E should try 3S holding a doubleton and an outside 6 card suit to the AK|pg||
mc|10|nt|007 joosth: 3S means about 10/11 and 3 spades Cornelia|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1NT is not forcing opposite 11 balanced, no. You may also want to pass 11 balanced, depends on the texture|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You don't want to be in game on a combined 22 count and no fit|pg||

nt|eggy: unless they are right :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jtr: That is the flaw in the system IMO But it does have great advantages to outwiegh it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|007 joosth: 1S i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|chick: after opener shows a 6 card suit, 3@S only promises a doubleton, and she did have 9 playing points plus the long diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1Nt in N    when its forcing 2D  ending at 2S|pg||
nt|chick: and a doubleton 2 honors|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: Another hand on the same theme - here possible is 2@h, then 2NT over partner's 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|007 joosth: yes  i wrote 2D  must be 2H ofcourse|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|007 joosth: 2S is weak with 3 spades or about 8 with doubleton|pg||
nt|idc: 8 hcp for North but good intermediates, particularly T9 @s look good|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2NT seems a bit to much to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: but it has good chances|pg||
nt|idc: 3@d as suggested to me is perfect on shape, but I'd expect a little more in the way of high cards|pg||

nt|007 joosth: agree|pg||
