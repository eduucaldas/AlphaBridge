mb|2S|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Will the Irish bid and make the tight game this time?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dburn: West ought to bid 3NT, but people sometimes look for the 5-3 major-suit fit|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: not this West - good shot|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sheila a: From West's point of view, the @s might be dodgy - but she trusts partner to take care of that|pg||
nt|dburn: two diamonds, four clubs, three spades - easy game, bridge|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jferg: probably try hearts first|pg||
nt|dburn: might play a heart just for drill, of course|pg||

nt|vugraphzay: The screen is down while n & e discuss the play|pg||
nt|dburn: just a question of technique - ace of clubs, club to the king, etc|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|dburn: sure, if the club position was not marked, declarer would have to choose between cashing the third club and playing for 4-4 hearts|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sheila a: Or for A@h in safe hand|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry, diamonds|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s8|nt|dburn: or that, indeed|pg||

nt|paulg:  she did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats not like liz|pg||
nt|paulg:  having played the @s10 I'm very surprised she did not make it|pg||
nt|paulg:  We are on the last board of this match. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Stephen Peterkin, for an excellent job.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, Rory Timlin, John Comyn and Beryl Campbell, for their peceptive comments and to all the kibitzers for the assistance.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Finally, our appreciation to Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and NIBU (Robin Burns) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|paulg:  We start again tomorrow at 10:00 Belfast (11:00 Paris, 04:00 New York, 10:00 Berwick-upon-Tweed).|pg||
nt|jcomyn: some very interesting hands. As we often say it is easy when u see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  actually it is 05:00 in New York, apologies for that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  From a Scottish perspective, a very assured debut for Yvonne Wiseman|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  She'll really be looking forward to the rest of the weekend now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: multi 2d|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|jcomyn: simple 4s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yes but we expected a bit more from a very experienced pair here weho made some unchraacteristic errorsd|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbb: oops...sry|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lark20: Should be the same in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  small heart lead and diamond switch would be inspired against 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  this probably needs a diamond switch too when North gets with the @hK|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
