nt|jcomyn: who backs out first|pg||
nt|paulg:  unlike the first half, I guess NS will stay quiet and leave EW to themselves|pg||
nt|lark20: Could it be East/West's turn to have the points?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: grind to a halt in 4s i guess|pg||
nt|paulg:  Spades always win|pg||
nt|paulg:  and the likely heart lead will make it simple to play|pg||
nt|jcomyn: problem is round and round they go and where will it stop|pg||
nt|lark20: Should be a nice start for Yvonne|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hello from manchester|pg||

nt|kemperg: Hi Victor and Ben|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 hearts is a lucky make but not one to bid|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: surely have to bid 4s|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: almost...|pg||
nt|paulg:  a little more sophisticated but a sound auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so no chanc e of going wrong|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  Punch knows it is a 4-4 fit, so unlikely to sacrifice at this vul|pg||
nt|paulg:  the Irish stopped in 2@h, why sacrifice?|pg||
nt|paulg:  A small spade lead would be testing|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch must feel N/S are already pushed beyond their limits|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yea s lead some guess|pg||
nt|benjy: Indeed, 4@H is not a game you really want to be in looking at the two hands|pg||

nt|greerm: first slam hand i've seen today|pg||
nt|copeyj: In the closed room, after S opened 1@C N bid 1@D and S b id 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: for me the N hand is basically a slam drive over that|pg||
nt|copeyj: subject to keycard presence|pg||
nt|copeyj: I mean the N hand is a moose|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|copeyj: AA 5 trumps and KX in partner;s first suit|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|copeyj: let's see if Sally agrees (if Susanna bids 3@D that is :))|pg||
nt|greerm: both tables wales ireland 3NT so maybe Ron Klinger more popular than we think|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: minor slam looks good here but unlikely to be bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|greerm: anyone for 6 now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: geoffrey after 1@C-1@D-3@D north can bid keycard pretty much in my view|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the singleton @HK is gold-dust|pg||
nt|copeyj: different kettle of fish after only 2@D from south|pg||
nt|copeyj: QX X AKXX QJXXXX is not really a 3@D bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 64221 shape looks more like 3@D, but you would,prefer better clubs than queen-high  |pg||
nt|greerm: south has tricks, North has controls, so a test of the partnership |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@S FSF and then they maight power there|pg||
nt|greerm: I think they get there now|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it may be tricky|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@C a good bid - now Sally knows her hand is pretty enormous - let's see|pg||
nt|greerm: North has great controls and Kx@C might be very valuable|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: whatever they do, they mustn't end in 3NT by South|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: THE PHOPHET OF DOOM|pg||
mb|4D|nt|roswolf: but that trap avoided|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: still think they are going to bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@D = rkcb?|pg||
nt|copeyj: Susanna must like her hand a lot here |pg||
nt|greerm: Susanna likes her hand for sure, but is worried about the @S suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: someone as to show controls preferably in @S|pg||
nt|greerm: or Sally Brock might go rkcb now|pg||
nt|roswolf: I NEVER LIKE THESE TANKS|pg||
nt|greerm: do they play kickback?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still using the old keyboard, Geoffrey?|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup -nervously - ah le punt!!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|greerm: well done if expected|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: funny - one South jumps to 3@d and gets to 3NT, and the other just bids 2@D and gets to 6@d |pg||

nt|paulg:  EW will be sacrificing on this hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but nthere is here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Of course Yvonne will have been on vugraph a few times before, as Scotland vs England is often shown from the Peggy Bayer (U20) match|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also from the Junior Europeans|pg||
nt|odysseus69: slam time|pg||
nt|kemperg: this is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbt: DHAMPUR SUGER 109 , R L KAJRIWAL 112, a BAGARIA 82|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well should nagainst vul opposition|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that was a good save against 4@H |pg||

mb|1C|nt|odysseus69: 1c-1d-3d and they will bid it smoothly|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbt: MMRMC 102,   BIMAL SIKKA 86|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hefty 3s|pg||
nt|paulg:  although that opening would put most off|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1c -1d-2d and???|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: probably not biddable |pg||
nt|odysseus69: key moment|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: will see if the other room gets into the bidding (last hand) |pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: I think south should bid 3@D and then north 3@H|pg||
nt|kemperg: now its on|pg||
nt|benjy: What is south going to do over that?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to get there now and I agree about 3D|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzbb: South thinking...|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|vugraphzbt: BANEET 93,    MMSNEHA  86|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont be tested but ew will be in the open room|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@S to keep 3NT in the game? Remember South doesn't know that partner has a slam try yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Liz has a big hand opposite a 4@d overcall, but few tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: perhaps thinking she should have opened 4...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch did will to pave the way for a sacrifice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: irish pair very aggressive bidders in there|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@H could just be looking for 3NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: undo|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: anyone like the X of 2@C?  I'm not sure I'd want a club lead (even if S were on lead)|pg||
nt|benjy: Wow 3NT is a huge underbid|pg||
pc|sT|nt|odysseus69: 3nt is pusillanimous from North - confident that English pair will bid this|pg||
nt|kemperg: not good:((|pg||
nt|benjy: South has a minimum 3@D bid and slam is cold, 3NT is also a terrible spot, if the @SQ loses you go down in 3NT when you make 6@D|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lark20: I thought Yvonne would have bid 3H here|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess that they don't play checkback, as you might invite with the West hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzbb: a rather stingy 9@C...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|odysseus69: from Norths positon a grand was close than 3NT |pg||
pc|cK|nt|yo_yo: i dont mind it, sometimes keeps them out of 3NT ( which is sometimes good - or bad)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now dangerous to finesse trumps|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may make the play of hts different |pg||
nt|sybarra: like cashing of AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes bash them out and get a nice surprise|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|paulg:  again, it is non-vulnerable so the rewards are not so great|pg||

nt|paulg:  Lindopp may upgrade to 1NT?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but makin it is another question|pg||
nt|lark20: if you can't make it don't bid it|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|paulg:  this is why I would have upgraded, it justs feel too good for a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|paulg:  I am told that EW play weak jump shifts and checkback, so 2@h was mildly invitational|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|golfsquash: Will the Irish bid and make the tight game this time?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doubt it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too many holes in the side suits|pg||
nt|golfsquash: It is getting more thought this time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and hard to see how n can fill those holes|pg||
nt|lark20: With 8 points and albeit a 6-card suit, game does not seem likely opposite a 12-14  hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  of course 3NT is not cold|pg||

nt|jcomyn: but surely 1nt by s on this auction is hardly balanced 16- hcp|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway i am not defending 1s|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will eventually play ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens this seems to be one of those times when partner does have eight tricks in notrump|pg||
nt|golfsquash: She will lose 4 trumps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and you end up in a very shaky contract - to put it mildly|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it is natural play to finesse the ht |pg||
pc|dT|nt|odysseus69: yes - having bid only 2S which limits the quality the West hand worth a cue which would be of no interest to East here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|baldfriede: Uh-oh.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This can go down 4 now with @d continuation.|pg||
nt|greerm: not always obvious to draw trump with such poor holdings but,|pg||
nt|benjy: or perhaps 4@H as a source of tricks, depends on your methods|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: cue for me|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|paulg:  once she has finished trying to reconstruct NS hands that fit the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: not that she cares too much...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: but wendell had to signal spade not club |pg||
pc|s7|nt|lark20: Difficult for S to find a bid with such a flat hand and 3 suits bid by opponents|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||

pc|hT|nt|paulg:  i think South has to double 1@s|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: thats my view also|pg||
nt|baldfriede: The problem was that West was in the lead, and drawing trumps from Kx does not look too good.|pg||
nt|greerm: setting up a cross ruff for the defence|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i like source of tricks but the main thing is agreement|pg||
pc|h9|nt|benjy: if a 2@S opener in 4th seat shows around 12-15|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|greerm: south knows where the @C Q is?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|baldfriede: She should.|pg||
nt|greerm: if so, can ruff high now and another @S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  it must show something along these lines, and they'd probably play in 1NT|pg||
nt|greerm: wd|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|benjy: then 1@S followed by 2@S showsa better hand than that something like 15++-16 in which case i think west should bid on over that. Any thoughts guys?|pg||

nt|copeyj: it didn't promise a @H stop I am sure|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 5s-4card minor|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must say i dont like it|pg||

nt|chick: it really hurts to bid 2@H with the S hand, knowing you are probably in a bad spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 18 they played 4 @H from the other side in OR|pg||

nt|baldfriede: And it should go down 1, Cards sit wrong for declarer.|pg||

nt|chick: by playing the way she did, she had to guess whether E's 3rd card was heart or diamond|pg||

mb|1S|nt|benjy: and by north too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT is the spot and they should get there - 1D -1S -1NT and a move from South|pg||
nt|kemperg: but can end in 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  maybe McGowan/Punch overcall any 5-card major?|pg||
nt|greerm: 3NT shows some sort of raise to 4@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  naturally you run to your other major|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i mean the s hand is big enough to look fo a chance, but not opposite thast hand|pg||
nt|benjy: If you bid 1NT you will never get across your shape, or playing strength|pg||
mb|3N|nt|simonr: South should have signed in 4@H and denied a @D control - if that is the methods|pg||
nt|benjy: Could easily miss a slam in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Operator, please correct.|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: South S Ingham|pg||
nt|greerm: iprobably, definitely 4@H was North|pg||
nt|simonr: Undo - 4@H by North|pg||
nt|greerm: ty operator|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|paulg:  if the South hand is interested in slam then it should be bidding suits and not notrumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I prefer 2NT to 3D - maybe they play a wide ranging 1NT rebid- used to be popular 20 years ago|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|benjy: Yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: What was W thinking?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the problem with 3D is that South faces some difficult problems - usually 2C is available as an enquiry which allows a 3D rebid|pg||
nt|benjy: The 10 was right on all layouts, declarer could not have 3 small @Hs as they would have called for the Q|pg||
nt|kemperg: evidently|pg||
pc|s2|nt|benjy: She still could have recovered by not playing the K@H on the 10@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@c is not forcing in my system, but I don't expect to miss game with a singleton heart if partner passes|pg||

nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, John Comyn and Beryl Campbell, for their peceptive comments and to all the kibitzers for the assistance.|pg||
nt|paulg:  We will be back in about 35 minutes for the second half of this match.|pg||
nt|paulg:  another pretty tough hand for EW to deal with|pg||
nt|kemperg: clubs 33 worked both ways|pg||
nt|odysseus69: you are  right Ben- /i was talking rubbish - the danger of seeing all 4 hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but the lack of values and misfit will probably steer them to 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless South wanders in?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 27,  the 6 nt played from the other side in OR,  -1 |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: tx paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  they might bid game here|pg||
nt|simonr: I suspect a weak NT from South and an invite from North via a transfer. South should accept with AJx support and two aces |pg||
nt|chick: yes, from the other side, but the play went similiarly, and East pitched 2 hearts and saved her 4 clubs!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|greerm: there's an acol type Fred?|pg||
nt|greerm: weak NT|pg||
nt|benjy: In fact if south is known to have 7@D and 2@H then the only time it is right to play the way she did was when south had Q10 doubleton of @Cs she definitely misplayed that in my ...|pg||
nt|benjy: opinion|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lark20: Thank you Paul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: finn is thanking her lucky stars|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes  but might be easier on a @D lead? |pg||
mb|3C|nt|chick: don't see why, won the diamond, took the spade finesse, and cashed all spades and diamonds, essentially the same as here|pg||
nt|kemperg: but she was lucky|pg||
nt|benjy: what is a jump in the 4th suit fro you guys?|pg||
nt|benjy: for me it is 55 forcing|pg||
nt|kemperg: isn't that a 55?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think the clue is no ht lead |pg||
mb|3D|nt|paulg:  and probably needs a club lead to let it through|pg||
mb|p|nt|lark20: With such a poor suit it was a good disciplined pass by South|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest I'd have bid 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: the other room might see a 3@H overcall...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it was paul who thought she might i knew she wouldnt |pg||
nt|kemperg: you are faster than me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: for me its 5-5 at the 3 level - for others a splinter - but here just natural forcing|pg||
nt|benjy: I don't understand why south doesn't bid 3@H over 3@C why rebid that @D suit!|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: her mixed partner would have her guts for garters, so she didnt|pg||
nt|lark20: I would probably have bid 2@H as well and then been disappointed when my partner led the suit:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: count on the @D early |pg||
nt|sybarra: count on the hand actually |pg||
nt|benjy: A thourougly unconvincing auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: giving opportunity to bid 3@H with 6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: she has excellent diamonds - if she plays poker|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kemperg: royal flush?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|baldfriede: She will probably misguess Q@s.|pg||
nt|simonr: Might go down if declarer gets trumps wrong - should play to ruff a diamond so E/W might help with trumps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|paulg:  the double club finesse is liz's only chance of making this|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg:  in the other room Punch plays sound 2-level overcalls, so more likely to be 3@H|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|greerm: more awkward to get the trump finesse right now, probably no overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: thinking..|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|benjy: Caplan played her pd to hold AQJ10 of @Ds, the only holding to beat game, but she might have led from that holding|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lark20: It would seem the only way to play it|pg||
nt|paulg:  but needed to do it immediately and not draw both trumps|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|c4|nt|benjy: Strange defence, surely she knew the @S count?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|greerm: i don't think it will be replicated here|pg||
nt|greerm: same start though|pg||
nt|simonr: On track so far!|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: west has what I call a middle 2 suiter hand, so some, who play minimax, would not bid the michaels because of that|pg||
nt|simonr: I think West is too good for Micheals at this vul - many play it as weak or strong (not intermediate)|pg||
nt|greerm: snap Simon :)|pg||
nt|simonr: 3@H is probably a good spade raise|pg||
nt|greerm: 3@H clearly a good raise and 4@S will come from S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|simonr: Will South bid 4 on a minimum? Proably not|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: Hi all|pg||
nt|paulg:  Good evening everyone and welcome to the Lady Milne 2011|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this could be quite a match|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Showing @h support, but how strong can it be?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamond lead needed to beat 4S|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H 1 down on 13, declarer stripped opps to play from the @C Q, well played, 1 down|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|benjy: The NI declarer was unlucky to go down in 4@H on Board 13, 12 more to ENG|pg||
mb|4S|nt|greerm: Sandie shows her second suit, presuming the 3@H dbl requested that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: a very experienced scottish pair against the irish playing only 2nd time, but anna has been having a greast season at home|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  in the other matches, Northern Ireland are leading NIBU (NI  2) by 10 imps and England lead Wales by 19 imps|pg||
nt|greerm: tempting now for Laura|pg||
nt|simonr: The double may just have shown @hs|pg||
nt|greerm: and the 4@C showed the extars we discussed earlier|pg||
nt|greerm: with @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: well done to pass|pg||
pc|dT|nt|greerm: can she make this with the friendly @D layout?|pg||
nt|greerm: every card right actually|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@S would have been a cheap save vul against non if you could avoid two diamond losers - which is unlikely|pg||
nt|greerm: right for declarer that is|pg||
nt|simonr: Not sure why Wales went 2 off in the other room?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  Although Punch and McGowan are very experienced players, this is their first major event together|pg||
nt|jcomyn: she has won two of the major pairs titles|pg||
nt|jcomyn: setting down an early marker by mary lindopp|pg||
nt|lark20: This is Punch and McGowans first Lady Milne playing together|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: some thought from Punch ...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|greerm: might disc 2@D on the @S|pg||
nt|greerm: yes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: declarer has to duck but ??? - well done|pg||
nt|kemperg: take 2nd @D and play @H to the king|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: 5-2 fits are popular around here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: state of the match i daresay|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  Punch probably wondering whether to redouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that helps a little|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|greerm: didn't realise that the @D so good|pg||
nt|simonr: Going down now - need to ruff the opening lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzbb: I don't think so :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: knowing s may have 3 spade tricks what do you do|pg||
nt|paulg:  there are lots of variables in the Lady Milne and trying to compute the 'state of the match' is never easy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: may have been a clue by the tempo of the opening lead|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulg:  might be tempted to lead a small spade here|pg||
nt|benjy: Declarer has done well to get this right, but is the correct line clear?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  Hope that it is the same in the other room|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|simonr: Still 6 IMPs to NIBU|pg||
nt|greerm: always difficult to read that every card lies right|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|h4|mc|11|nt|paulg:  we can see that there are some winning lines, but likely to lead a spade to the queen|pg||

nt|greerm: boohs from N Ireland, and me here in Portugal :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||

nt|paulg:  Finally, our appreciation to Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and NIBU (Robin Burns) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|paulg:  We start again tomorrow at 10:00 Belfast (11:00 Paris, 04:00 New York, 10:00 Berwick-upon-Tweed).|pg||
nt|jcomyn: some very interesting hands. As we often say it is easy when u see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  actually it is 05:00 in New York, apologies for that|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Last chance for a slam now. Will we have it?|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  From a Scottish perspective, a very assured debut for Yvonne Wiseman|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|vugraphzbb: oops...sry|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lark20: Should be the same in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  small heart lead and diamond switch would be inspired against 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  this probably needs a diamond switch too when North gets with the @hK|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: K|pg||
nt|benjy: A spec thinks it's right to pass if you deduct a point for Jx, i take that point but yes, but a vul game, J109 look nice and Q10xx looks good, not so clear|pg||
nt|benjy: I wouldn't crime anyone for inviting, i think it's close|pg||
