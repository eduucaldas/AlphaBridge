nt|jcomyn: who backs out first|pg||
nt|paulg:  unlike the first half, I guess NS will stay quiet and leave EW to themselves|pg||
nt|lark20: Could it be East/West's turn to have the points?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: grind to a halt in 4s i guess|pg||
nt|paulg:  Spades always win|pg||
nt|paulg:  and the likely heart lead will make it simple to play|pg||
nt|jcomyn: problem is round and round they go and where will it stop|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Operator, if you take initials away we could get full surnames in|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: Good afternoon Everyone|pg||
nt|odysseus69: delighted to see Dinah Caplan in action- a youthful 78 year old making her International debut with my good friend Lizzie Godfrey|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The Irish ladies got a bit of a shellacking in the first set. Let us see if they can recover |pg||
nt|petepunt: scotaln 58,  Ireland 57 Enf 49|pg||
nt|Walddk5: That is certainly better|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hello all |pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: 4s not a bad sacrifice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a small select group watching here :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: a strong 1H  but they dont paly strong 2s or Benji  so no choice|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4H is a good spot|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It applies to North and West|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Hello Shirley and Peter|pg||
mb|4C|nt|petepunt: Good aftenoon Shirly and all|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  hard for EW to get into the auction though |pg||
nt|petepunt: any scores roland|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: mjkousy 2h|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless 2@h is getting passed out|pg||
nt|simonx:  For the English, they need to win by 59 IMPs to get a maximum 25 VPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @c is a splinter |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Peter |pg||
nt|Walddk5: England +9 against Scotland|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: indeed|pg||
nt|benjy: Hi Victor|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: 4 @H a cue bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ooips|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: mmm...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: LIZZZZZZZ|pg||
nt|paulg:  automatic for McGowan to balance|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but irish not there yet|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Victor and Ben|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 hearts is a lucky make but not one to bid|pg||
nt|petepunt: West has a ood hand but single @H & @S arent worth much  so 3@C  might hav ebeen enough|pg||
nt|petepunt: i like the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk5: NIBU +14 against Ireland|pg||
nt|sybarra: good auction indeed  |pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: hello all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any preferences for double rather than 3@h?|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s is trusting the opponents too much |pg||
nt|sybarra: a @D cue and off to the races |pg||
pc|sT|nt|petepunt: bidding screeemd aout for a @D lead though :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may be case of cash'em of dont get'em|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: surely have to bid 4s|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: almost...|pg||
nt|paulg:  a little more sophisticated but a sound auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so no chanc e of going wrong|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg:  Punch knows it is a 4-4 fit, so unlikely to sacrifice at this vul|pg||
nt|paulg:  the Irish stopped in 2@h, why sacrifice?|pg||
nt|paulg:  A small spade lead would be testing|pg||
nt|lark20: Punch must feel N/S are already pushed beyond their limits|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yea s lead some guess|pg||
nt|benjy: Indeed, 4@H is not a game you really want to be in looking at the two hands|pg||
nt|benjy: But it would make|pg||
nt|petepunt: still par result 5@C minis 2 as not reasonable to pass 1H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk5: Current rankings -- based on first three matches and half-time scores in current matches at  http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|petepunt: in fairenss these 2 pairs have played in nearly all the sets so far so expect tiredness ot creep in during the last match|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: hello|pg||
nt|larrymori: I would rather bid 4 than 3 so X allows 3@h after a minor|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|jcomyn: next hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: all ladies!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: men leave the room please :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: nah, letskeep a few of them :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree - even in these unenlightened days, 2@h over 1@s should show a decent hand |pg||
nt|simonx:  England's main loss in the first half was reopening the bidding when the oppo had stopped in 2@c.  They then got to 5@c and made it.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|benjy: Godfrey was heavy for 2@H but not close to a 3@H call in my opinion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and more of the same here - EW could have defended 3@h and now they are defending a making 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or a should-be-making 4@h, anyway|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|s5|nt|mamos: sorry good morning|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|petepunt: not so long ago we played only 90 boards over 2 days now it is much more over 3 days.  |pg||
mc|12|nt|paulg:  still on a spade guess, but West would probably lead from the queen|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2 hearts in a loud voice used to describe this - bidding boxes dont give the samr opportunity|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|greerm: EW can get a @S ruff to hold 4@H to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@d doubled looks profitable|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  ruff crucial if NS pushed to 5@h|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|greerm: I think East must bid now to get to the sac|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard for East to show her suits|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  X of 2@s might show the minors but it suggests more values and less shape|pg||
nt|greerm: 4Nt over 4@H would be a bit arbitrary|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer should signal|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if EW play reverse, play the 4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if standard, drop the 8|pg||

nt|paulg:  EW will be sacrificing on this hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but nthere is here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Of course Yvonne will have been on vugraph a few times before, as Scotland vs England is often shown from the Peggy Bayer (U20) match|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also from the Junior Europeans|pg||
nt|odysseus69: slam time|pg||
nt|kemperg: this is interesting|pg||
nt|simonx:  Known as  Biltcliffe Coup to some ... reopen a aprtscore and then they make game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, no, no - you have to double the game as well|pg||
nt|simonx:  ... and some say you have to double AND misdefend|pg||
nt|mamos: took me a while to find the right room|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbt: DHAMPUR SUGER 109 , R L KAJRIWAL 112, a BAGARIA 82|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well should nagainst vul opposition|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that was a good save against 4@H |pg||
nt|benjy: Looks like 6@D/@C is a make |pg||
mb|1H|nt|odysseus69: 1c-1d-3d and they will bid it smoothly|pg||
nt|petepunt: its the one with the blue&red door :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzbt: MMRMC 102,   BIMAL SIKKA 86|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hefty 3s|pg||
nt|paulg:  although that opening would put most off|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1c -1d-2d and???|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that board probably flat - a more, how can we put it, appreciative auction should get to 4@h anyway  |pg||
nt|mamos: ty|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@D save is tough to reach|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: probably not biddable |pg||
nt|odysseus69: key moment|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: will see if the other room gets into the bidding (last hand) |pg||
nt|petepunt: many would open the East hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: I think south should bid 3@D and then north 3@H|pg||
nt|kemperg: now its on|pg||
nt|benjy: What is south going to do over that?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to get there now and I agree about 3D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: best she can do|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: W made of sterner stuff :)|pg||
nt|larrymori: it would be something to reach 4@s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbb: South thinking...|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6 loser hand yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: when goes 4 @H  E might bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: guess not|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzbt: BANEET 93,    MMSNEHA  86|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont be tested but ew will be in the open room|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@S to keep 3NT in the game? Remember South doesn't know that partner has a slam try yet|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg:  Liz has a big hand opposite a 4@d overcall, but few tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: perhaps thinking she should have opened 4...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch did will to pave the way for a sacrifice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: irish pair very aggressive bidders in there|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@H could just be looking for 3NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: undo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c fourth suit. Not normally game-forcing by a passed hand|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@d now?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: so probably 2@h form North, and then South will have to take a view|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mamos: NS fit very well|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|chick: anyone like the X of 2@C?  I'm not sure I'd want a club lead (even if S were on lead)|pg||
nt|benjy: Wow 3NT is a huge underbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S would be a good description |pg||
nt|petepunt: s has done well here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: 3nt is pusillanimous from North - confident that English pair will bid this|pg||
nt|kemperg: not good:((|pg||
nt|benjy: South has a minimum 3@D bid and slam is cold, 3NT is also a terrible spot, if the @SQ loses you go down in 3NT when you make 6@D|pg||
nt|larrymori: 2@s with the good @ss would have been worth a try|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but South has passed - not unreasonable|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 nt was an option also |pg||
nt|sybarra: (for minors) |pg||

nt|paulg:  Lindopp may upgrade to 1NT?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but makin it is another question|pg||
nt|lark20: if you can't make it don't bid it|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|4H|nt|golfsquash: Hi JC and all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi rory|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not quite for 4S|pg||
nt|petepunt: after a short @C common to !X without 4@S and bid with 4_@S.  although...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  this is why I would have upgraded, it justs feel too good for a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|paulg:  I am told that EW play weak jump shifts and checkback, so 2@h was mildly invitational|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Will the Irish bid and make the tight game this time?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doubt it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too many holes in the side suits|pg||
nt|golfsquash: It is getting more thought this time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and hard to see how n can fill those holes|pg||
nt|lark20: With 8 points and albeit a 6-card suit, game does not seem likely opposite a 12-14  hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: some now play 1@S is less than 4 and X is 4+  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petepunt: We feature Wales and NI's top pairs at this table though N/S both have Camrose open experience too.|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4H is a bit of a bid!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  of course 3NT is not cold|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bunch of taps in hts and this contract can get dicey |pg||
nt|benjy: Now this is a decent game|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not see how this makes |pg||
pc|s3|nt|odysseus69: easy double dummy but not a make in prctice- conservative choice and luckily avoiding good but failing game|pg||
pc|s5|nt|greerm: looks like a simple one, losing 2@H only|pg||

nt|golfsquash: trying to induce a trump switch|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petepunt: surprised Greenwood didn't show her @S|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  @h10 is their standard lead from AJ10 in notrump|pg||

mb|1S|mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: Norht goes for it - might as well, at 60-odd down|pg||
nt|petepunt: playing 5 card majors with 15-18 and 4144 shape, i advise 1D rather than 1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: now whast|pg||

nt|sybarra: multi,  and Wennell is positive which suit it is  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: aces do tempt me|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|odysseus69: j of diamonds works well|pg||

nt|simonx:  the one that goes backwards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: what??? - with 5-3 s fit and 2h and 2h|pg||
nt|baldfriede: And it should go down 1, Cards sit wrong for declarer.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @H is the "relay" response  (pass or correct) |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  I agree, it is not a good opener at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes thats Y ciara tried 4N and sold out.  it is easy for us to oversimplyfy i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: But that wouldn't get a @C lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: best start:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|greerm: another difficult play hand for Sandie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as commented, good case for a club lead - you have an honour, and hopefully can set some tricks up - heart lead needs a good holding from partner|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  Easy to say that this is not the best spot, but in practice I don't think there is a good spot|pg||
nt|golfsquash: unblock now|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|petepunt: this will need great care to  go 1 off.|pg||

pc|sK|nt|golfsquash: even 2@s can be beaten|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you don't have a guaranteed 5-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|kemperg: no not as invite and not as slamtry|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|sybarra: this hand will not go well for declarer...(might be an understatement) |pg||

nt|petepunt: waht would you bid after the x with East Mike?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: fancy ew to play 4h|pg||
nt|benjy: More action here|pg||
nt|kemperg: waking up on this board|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lark20: yes!|pg||
nt|paulg:  maybe more!|pg||
nt|greerm: 4 or 5 as North?|pg||
nt|benjy: 1@H X P 2@C 2@D 2@H 3@D ?|pg||
nt|benjy: Then what would south bid? 4@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: indeed can theyb stay out of 5|pg||
nt|greerm: i prefer 5 but not everybody|pg||
nt|simonx:  A misfit 3NT - but it should make in comfort with all the suits behaving.|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 19  was worth 9 as they played 4 @S making in the other room |pg||
mb|1H|nt|petepunt: figures|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3-card s support i assume|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: aka overtrick |pg||
nt|petepunt: a very lucky 4@H for e/w here - they wont get anywhere near it though|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think it's easy - dont want to punish partner for contesting part score  but we do have six card suit and Aces  - Im surprised she didnt compete to 4@d at least after 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: slam? Can you make game?|pg||
nt|simonr: Hi Greer|pg||
nt|greerm: makes if declarer uses the only entry to finesse @D, lets see :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 5 has good chances; it probably does not need much more than A@d right-sided.|pg||
nt|greerm: hi Simon|pg||
nt|baldfriede: So I would go for 5 too.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @C on the finesse here |pg||
nt|sybarra: real question is do you want to be there?|pg||
nt|petepunt: unlikely to get that high |pg||
nt|petepunt: what about 4th @S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|benjy: 3@C!|pg||
nt|benjy: Am i seeing things?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 2@S  must show a good raise to 2@s|pg||
mb|3C|nt|benjy: 3@C is a monster underbid.|pg||
nt|kemperg: don't have to be paranormal for this one|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north has some to spare now|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes 3@D showed a fair hand else 2N,  agree 4@D might punish partner sometimes|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: declarer cannot expect the perfect @D layout, may go off|pg||
nt|sybarra: true not sure they can handle 6 |pg||
mb|4C|nt|jcomyn: well you know them these days if you are not in 3nt you are in 6d|pg||
nt|petepunt: work to do to make 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: ah, no entry so will go off |pg||
nt|kemperg: but 3@C ???|pg||
nt|kemperg: hoping for X now?|pg||
nt|petepunt: west will pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: sort of wrong sided but ok with A@D onside|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@C is the kind of bid that deserves the auction to proceed all pass and hey presto game is cold|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice bid 5@D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it is often a mistake to support partners minor with nothing but 5 trumps - it often helps opponents|pg||
nt|benjy: Cheeky pass from Caplan over 4@C, hoping not to push the opponents into game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: friendly lie here|pg||
nt|simonx:  The result has just come in on the board where Caplan made 2@s doubled - 16 IMPs to England ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I thought she would bid it given they are behind |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: lucky the ace of @D on side  |pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: u were right paul|pg||
nt|simonr: North will need to exit a trump|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, but to shut out opponents?|pg||
nt|simonr: Needs to overtake and continue @S|pg||
nt|greerm: or let south continue @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: you were faster Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hope i am on the tennis court in 30 mins|pg||
nt|benjy: North has a normal X of 5@D which will go two light|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i x on the s hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont wait for p |pg||
nt|paulg:  1@h was not much of a space-consuming vulnerable overcall and, unsuprisingly, McGowan expected more|pg||
nt|paulg:  South will open in the other room, so they will not be in 3NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: want to bet|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: South will not open :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: my prediction...|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: S thinking here...|pg||
nt|sybarra: too many hands left,  we will have to excuse you early for you to make it |pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: suffering ducks|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: sometimes a mistake to think|pg||
pc|cA|nt|greerm: oops|pg||
nt|benjy: Dare i say the par contract has been reached?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  your sources are generally better than mine Stephen|pg||
nt|simonr: Whoops|pg||
nt|benjy: brb|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see that on board 20 the Englsih NS did collect 800 from 2@Sx |pg||
nt|simonx:  You were right with that 800 prediction in 2@sX, Mike, but at the wrong table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: twas ever thus|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly a game swing on 22 as well|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|kemperg: end result the best|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kemperg: yes par|pg||
nt|odysseus69: without te 3D bid my guess is that 3C would have been the end|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: someone commented that there had been so slams yet|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lark20: How lucky can Scotland be?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: A little gift.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that would be my cup of tea|pg||
nt|simonx:  The way the VP scale goes, England are capped when the score gets to 25-5, but the Northern Ireland score carries on down to 25-0, so they still have something to play for.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yo_yo: they will probably come fast and furious soon|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mamos: with the cards  so badly placed NS have done well to stay in 2@s here  I can imagine some pairs getting higher|pg||
nt|petepunt: shoul play on @S next|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: I dont believe this its a mirage|pg||
nt|simonr: Although the @H look ominous if North has the corect count (which she does) she should realise there is no entry|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|paulg:  I don't understand how North can double and South cannot|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: albeit not very much :(|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|paulg:  just goes to show, it is not what you hold in your hand that  matters, it is what your opponent thinks you  hold|pg||
nt|petepunt: this works to as @H 3-3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|greerm: claim soon?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: I have heard tell of a world class pair that went a full year bidding no slams.  They claimed their results were not significantly affected.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's interesting|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|simonx:  ... and pride|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  can go back to @d at the same level|pg||
nt|greerm: and now 4@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  mistake I think for West in the other room not to bid 4@s|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  East should expect her partner to have a high spade|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so slam just depends on finding West with the @dK|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|yorkbeach:  or, as here, with two fast spade winners|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|greerm: the 5@C bid here was maybe thought to show extra values, whereas better to assume 4@C is a slam try|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|s2|pc|h7|pc|c6|pg||

nt|lark20: Agree. It is south who has the defence.|pg||
nt|paulg:  bit of a gift for the Irish|pg||
nt|jcomyn: my money is on irish to bid 4s|pg||
nt|paulg:  although Punch and McGowan are still settling into their partnership, they are both quite resilient and will not let bad results get them down|pg||
nt|paulg:  Scotland were apparently similarly afflicted in the other room on board 20 and let 3NT make|pg||
nt|simonr: South should be Ingham - they got her name wrong last night as well!|pg||
nt|greerm: Isn't it L Woodruff too Simon?|pg||
nt|simonr: North is also L Woodruff - not I|pg||
nt|benjy: Q@D switch. did that really just happen?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant take my eyes off the screen for a minute- it was 2 down when I left and it looked cast iron|pg||
nt|mamos: OUCH|pg||

nt|mamos: EW should do this :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: Can we double check operator?|pg||
nt|benjy: It just seems so unlikely|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  so i am not surprised by 2@d opener|pg||
nt|odysseus69: easy 1NTs  recurring |pg||
nt|mdgraham: classic weak two in the North hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petepunt: welcome John,  its early for u ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: E certainly had better suits this time in the minors|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: i have observed that the welsh ladies dont lose heart too easily, a good trait|pg||

nt|petepunt: another 6@D  |pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: and Sandie Millersship while wer'e at it :)|pg||
nt|greerm: millership|pg||
nt|chick: by playing the way she did, she had to guess whether E's 3rd card was heart or diamond|pg||
nt|benjy: On the last hand North knew that West had 10 red cards from the bidding so after the two top @Ss the A@C was perfectly safe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual |pg||
nt|petepunt: 6N by East,  but any slam will do|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|simonx:  Right, weak on weak ... I thought that was a no-no |pg||
mb|3N|nt|lark20: It is a stronger hand than I would have expected from Punch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: terrible pass by s on thnis bidding what did she waznt|pg||
nt|paulg:  Onishuk missed a chance there .. partner must be quite strong when you hold the diamond singleton|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 4@s can be defeated, but you would to be there|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: What do the initials stand for anyway? I am not that familiar with these players.|pg||
nt|simonr: Not enough characters in BBO to put the full name and initials!|pg||
nt|simonr: Sue and Laura for Wales|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ....would want to be there |pg||
mb|4C|nt|paulg:  a fairly easy hand as declarer has no real option except to finesse the club|pg||
nt|greerm: I always look for a way to make 12 tricks on these type of hands, can't see any here|pg||
nt|simonr: Neither can GIB!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but she did bid 3s and thats all s wanted to hear surely|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, this should get a plus score|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...on a spade switch....|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||

nt|odysseus69: the problem with 3D is that South faces some difficult problems - usually 2C is available as an enquiry which allows a 3D rebid|pg||

nt|mamos: but with one leap they are free :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: surprisingly South chose 2C when most including me would be bidding hearts|pg||

pc|s9|nt|jcomyn: oh well should have known what onishuk would do|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: actually looking,  doesnt seem to matter which side|pg||

nt|jferg: 2c is puppet|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lark20: Still no score for East West|pg||

pc|hT|nt|paulg:  perhaps being non-vulnerable was important |pg||
nt|paulg:  games need to be 50% to be worth bidding|pg||

nt|larrymori: for sure|pg||

nt|benjy: Frisky 2@S from Godfrey!|pg||
nt|benjy: That should shut west up|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Double by South - too strong for 1NT in the balancing position|pg||
nt|benjy: wrong again|pg||
nt|mamos: he'll probably tell them quietly where they went wrong :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: N will be interested in more than game|pg||
nt|sybarra: qx of hts might slow her down |pg||
mb|3H!|nt|benjy: For me 4@C would show @S support|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2 key times to think in card play a) when dummy goes down b) when you first gain the lead as defender|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@C stands out for now|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: East likes that:)|pg||
nt|simonr: North might try 3@C - showing values if they have a Lebensohl option|pg||
nt|petepunt: ;)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcomyn: skinny but 2 majorsd makes it decent ernough|pg||
nt|benjy: how can you pass and introduce your own suit in a competitive auction at the 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: but Sandie may go again|pg||
nt|greerm: nope|pg||
nt|sybarra: in tempo raise to 3 nt or the sham of stayman?|pg||
nt|benjy: and why did north pass 4@C instead of Xbling?|pg||
nt|sybarra: was that a help suit try? |pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: leading from shortage not always recommended with long trump|pg||
nt|chick: but you know what ... unless W has a heart honor, 6N is cold, so baring the @HJ can't hurt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 13 tricks maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  10 is my bet|pg||
nt|sybarra: or sort of a zia cue?|pg||
nt|petepunt: prefer 4@C from S then 4@D from N and job done|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petepunt: Wales gained 8imps on a part-score where Burns in 2@S-2 so all sq.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petepunt: Zia would follow thrue with 4N :) after psychic trial bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: lol:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chick: puppet stayman is not a sham when you have a 3 card major and a singleton|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|greerm: 2@D set up for declarer to let east ruff with East's long trump|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||

nt|mamos: forces might have been even more of a worry but  as it gooes contract looks ok  |pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  and given South the chance to bid/not bid 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: on the other hand, south might have bid 2@S instead of 2@D at first chance|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yorkbeach:  yes I might have done that|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|yorkbeach:  but definitely should not have shown any slam interest |pg||

mb|p|nt|greerm: yes|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|greerm: North will have to lead away from @D K to beat 6, so hopeful for NI|pg||

nt|greerm: no dbl by south obviously, making it even more difficult for N|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  West is going to like the fact that South did not X 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  all on the lead|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  short strong diamond suit is the attacking option|pg||

pc|dT|nt|greerm: well done :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South still has to win the first @h and return a @d|pg||

pc|s3|pc|d8|nt|greerm: chance of a discard this way|pg||

nt|paulg:  and, as most Scots will know, Ms Punch is not the fastest player in the country|pg||
nt|paulg:  sometimes you look at your scorecard and just see a small -3 imps and not worry, but I guess the Scotland captain may wonder how his pair bid freely to their 5-1 fit on board 25|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Desmond Deery a great Irish player of the past did not like to claim- he said that then when he was not claiming the defence would believe they stil had a chance|pg||

nt|petepunt: e/w has some great hands this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 1NT 15-17 for me|pg||
mb|1H|nt|simonr: There was a similar hand to South's last night - lots of debate as to what to open|pg||
nt|greerm: I love these big hands with no obvious bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: and he was the fastest player ever?|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: for those of us who don't play strong @C that is|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT cold as cards lie  who says you need stops|pg||
nt|petepunt: thats Y I open 1N with nrth Di has a tough bid now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and bd 19 will stand out in their mind :(|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  if I were npc I might suggest that they slow down a little|pg||
nt|petepunt: then thts Y I'm called PetethePunt:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|simonr: Treating it as a GF in @H or 23+ balanced|pg||
nt|chick: NS playing Weak NT, so 1N now shows 15-17|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S might prefer to play in clubs |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but she doesnt know N clubs are as good as they are|pg||
nt|mamos: oops 3@s  looks like an accident happening|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go again close to slam |pg||
nt|petepunt: @D lead look nasty|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jcomyn: thats enough|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@H or X guys?|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5D makes too though!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: do we know 2NT?|pg||
nt|petepunt: expect @C lead though|pg||
mb|5D|nt|simonr: GF in @H - partner will exepct a better suit! But if you bid 2NT partner is not expecting a singleton|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H for me|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H or a coward pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|jcomyn: ENOUGH ena|pg||
nt|greerm: not everybody's choice the 4@H but a difficult hand to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: @C leads best |pg||
nt|simonr: No entry to table for the spades so will drift a couple off|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Communication problems for declarer.|pg||
nt|sybarra: that would be nice :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Surprised South did not continue with 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: seems better than 3@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a very good game missed|pg||
nt|lark20: 3@D would have been more helpful|pg||
nt|paulg:  over 3@d North would have a tough decision|pg||
nt|paulg:  easy to pass 3@s with no controls to speak of|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and only three points in partner's suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: the brakes are screeching |pg||
nt|petepunt: this WAS a hand for a Zia 4@D cue by West |pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|petepunt: lower2suit I suspect West expected more points|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: fun here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: late chance for ireland to reduce arrears|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulg:  a club continuation will hold this to nine tricks, as spades are 4-2|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps a takeout double of 2@s by Yvonne is a better way to get her hand across|pg||
nt|paulg:  then she would not feel obliged to bid over 3@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i dont understand why they do not play in their 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  because they need 11 tricks for game in that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this major mania is killing our game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I didnt say anything a\bout a game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and in any case nobody is doubling 5d|pg||
nt|petepunt: same lead N would find aginst 6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|lark20: Teams means Games|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||

pc|hK|nt|paulg:  Maida and Sheila, playing NS in the other room, just continue on their merry way bidding game after game|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|baldfriede: Yes, but would have had more chances. I was a bit durprised N did not name the @s.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|simonr: A 27 point part score hand!|pg||

nt|vugraphzbb: back at table|pg||
nt|petepunt: CBAI 24 imps own to NIBU|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but the lack of values and misfit will probably steer them to 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless South wanders in?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 27,  the 6 nt played from the other side in OR,  -1 |pg||
mb|1D|nt|petepunt: 4@H needs care here|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: tx paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  they might bid game here|pg||
nt|simonr: I suspect a weak NT from South and an invite from North via a transfer. South should accept with AJx support and two aces |pg||
nt|chick: yes, from the other side, but the play went similiarly, and East pitched 2 hearts and saved her 4 clubs!|pg||
nt|simonx:  Is Dianh, at 78, is the oldest ever English player in the Lady Milne?  Almost certainly the oldest debutante|pg||
nt|mamos: down?|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes|pg||
nt|petepunt: scot about 7 up v England|pg||
nt|mamos: I like 2@d here |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|greerm: there's an acol type Fred?|pg||
nt|greerm: weak NT|pg||
nt|benjy: In fact if south is known to have 7@D and 2@H then the only time it is right to play the way she did was when south had Q10 doubleton of @Cs she definitely misplayed that in my ...|pg||
nt|benjy: opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|lark20: Thank you Paul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: finn is thanking her lucky stars|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@H may be a 33 card suit sometimes on this auction|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: yes  but might be easier on a @D lead? |pg||
nt|sybarra: is 3 nt better?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: don't see why, won the diamond, took the spade finesse, and cashed all spades and diamonds, essentially the same as here|pg||
nt|kemperg: but she was lucky|pg||
nt|benjy: what is a jump in the 4th suit fro you guys?|pg||
nt|benjy: for me it is 55 forcing|pg||
nt|kemperg: isn't that a 55?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: I think the clue is no ht lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and probably needs a club lead to let it through|pg||
nt|petepunt: Y,  most play 2N as 19-21 or so.  Balancing in 4th|pg||
nt|mamos: so you can bid 3@c next time :0|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lark20: With such a poor suit it was a good disciplined pass by South|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest I'd have bid 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: the other room might see a 3@H overcall...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it was paul who thought she might i knew she wouldnt |pg||
nt|kemperg: you are faster than me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: for me its 5-5 at the 3 level - for others a splinter - but here just natural forcing|pg||
nt|benjy: I don't understand why south doesn't bid 3@H over 3@C why rebid that @D suit!|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: will be forced into guesing @C right so 9 tricks (maybe10)|pg||
nt|petepunt: both can make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: her mixed partner would have her guts for garters, so she didnt|pg||
nt|lark20: I would probably have bid 2@H as well and then been disappointed when my partner led the suit:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: count on the @D early |pg||
nt|sybarra: count on the hand actually |pg||
nt|benjy: A thourougly unconvincing auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: giving opportunity to bid 3@H with 6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: she has excellent diamonds - if she plays poker|pg||
nt|petepunt: AC best|pg||
nt|petepunt: just a lot to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: "can" is the operative word |pg||
nt|petepunt: need to intra finesse @H|pg||
nt|petepunt: and get to dummy ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: royal flush?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|baldfriede: She will probably misguess Q@s.|pg||
nt|simonr: Might go down if declarer gets trumps wrong - should play to ruff a diamond so E/W might help with trumps|pg||
nt|petepunt: great lead by the way|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: what if she ducked that spade?|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|petepunt: N just happy to see the @C break!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  in the other room Punch plays sound 2-level overcalls, so more likely to be 3@H|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|greerm: more awkward to get the trump finesse right now, probably no overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: thinking..|pg||
pc|hK|nt|benjy: Caplan played her pd to hold AQJ10 of @Ds, the only holding to beat game, but she might have led from that holding|pg||

nt|larrymori: slam on a @h guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sorry all, I must go. Enjoy the last couple of hands  |pg||
nt|mamos: NS got too high in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: good hand for the strong NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|greerm: i don't think it will be replicated here|pg||
nt|greerm: same start though|pg||
nt|simonr: On track so far!|pg||
nt|larrymori: thx Mikw  c u|pg||
nt|larrymori: Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: west has what I call a middle 2 suiter hand, so some, who play minimax, would not bid the michaels because of that|pg||
nt|simonr: I think West is too good for Micheals at this vul - many play it as weak or strong (not intermediate)|pg||
nt|greerm: snap Simon :)|pg||
nt|simonr: 3@H is probably a good spade raise|pg||
nt|greerm: 3@H clearly a good raise and 4@S will come from S|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 25 ,  they tried 5 @D at the other table,  dbld |pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Will South bid 4 on a minimum? Proably not|pg||
nt|sybarra: -3 |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: Hi all|pg||
nt|paulg:  Good evening everyone and welcome to the Lady Milne 2011|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this could be quite a match|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Showing @h support, but how strong can it be?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamond lead needed to beat 4S|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H 1 down on 13, declarer stripped opps to play from the @C Q, well played, 1 down|pg||
nt|petepunt: not the time to upgrade!|pg||
nt|sybarra: W is serverly disappointed |pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: no and not easy for East to lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: but wait till she sees her pard's hand  |pg||
pc|d2|nt|benjy: The NI declarer was unlucky to go down in 4@H on Board 13, 12 more to ENG|pg||
nt|petepunt: Americans Lead KH, Europeans 7@H and the italians 'the right @H'|pg||
pc|d6|nt|greerm: Sandie shows her second suit, presuming the 3@H dbl requested that?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a very experienced scottish pair against the irish playing only 2nd time, but anna has been having a greast season at home|pg||
nt|petepunt: which is a @C here|pg||
nt|petepunt: need to leave now thx shirly and specs.  hope 2b  back for final stanza|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  in the other matches, Northern Ireland are leading NIBU (NI  2) by 10 imps and England lead Wales by 19 imps|pg||
nt|greerm: tempting now for Laura|pg||
nt|simonr: The double may just have shown @hs|pg||
nt|greerm: and the 4@C showed the extars we discussed earlier|pg||
nt|greerm: with @C|pg||
nt|mamos: Wales will lose quite a few imps on this board without doing much wrong |pg||
pc|h7|nt|greerm: well done to pass|pg||
pc|h2|nt|greerm: can she make this with the friendly @D layout?|pg||
nt|greerm: every card right actually|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@S would have been a cheap save vul against non if you could avoid two diamond losers - which is unlikely|pg||
nt|greerm: right for declarer that is|pg||
nt|simonr: Not sure why Wales went 2 off in the other room?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  Although Punch and McGowan are very experienced players, this is their first major event together|pg||
nt|jcomyn: she has won two of the major pairs titles|pg||
nt|jcomyn: setting down an early marker by mary lindopp|pg||
nt|lark20: This is Punch and McGowans first Lady Milne playing together|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: some thought from Punch ...|pg||
nt|larrymori: 3@s would have been better then cue cue slam|pg||
nt|simonx:  I agree ... I think 4@s should be weaker|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: getting this played by South in 2NT was very bada s it happened  cos West knew which Heart to lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|greerm: might disc 2@D on the @S|pg||
nt|greerm: yes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: declarer has to duck but ??? - well done|pg||
nt|kemperg: take 2nd @D and play @H to the king|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: 5-2 fits are popular around here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: state of the match i daresay|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch probably wondering whether to redouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that helps a little|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|greerm: didn't realise that the @D so good|pg||
nt|simonr: Going down now - need to ruff the opening lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzbb: I don't think so :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: knowing s may have 3 spade tricks what do you do|pg||
nt|paulg:  there are lots of variables in the Lady Milne and trying to compute the 'state of the match' is never easy|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|odysseus69: may have been a clue by the tempo of the opening lead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|paulg:  might be tempted to lead a small spade here|pg||
nt|benjy: Declarer has done well to get this right, but is the correct line clear?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hope that it is the same in the other room|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|simonr: Still 6 IMPs to NIBU|pg||
nt|greerm: always difficult to read that every card lies right|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Peter |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|paulg:  we can see that there are some winning lines, but likely to lead a spade to the queen|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: good job no spade honour in w hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: for ireland that is|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW a little unlucky, in that they have found a fair contract ... if you had jumped to 4@h as West it would be worse but escape the double|pg||
nt|jcomyn: fair - i think it a super contract but.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: last chance saloon and she blew it|pg||
nt|paulg:  but can still make this by finessing the spade on the way back|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: playing for hts 3/3 |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|paulg:  but no longer|pg||

nt|paulg:  We are on the last board of this match. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Stephen Peterkin, for an excellent job.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, Rory Timlin, John Comyn and Beryl Campbell, for their peceptive comments and to all the kibitzers for the assistance.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Finally, our appreciation to Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and NIBU (Robin Burns) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. |pg||
nt|paulg:  We start again tomorrow at 10:00 Belfast (11:00 Paris, 04:00 New York, 10:00 Berwick-upon-Tweed).|pg||
nt|jcomyn: some very interesting hands. As we often say it is easy when u see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  actually it is 05:00 in New York, apologies for that|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Last chance for a slam now. Will we have it?|pg||
nt|greerm: nope|pg||
nt|greerm: though maybe |pg||
nt|baldfriede: Would be one with Q@c onside though.|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand for this set |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our brilliant operator  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Cornelia for your time and assistance |pg||
nt|simonx:  Here we have Ladies Trials, but when the team plays outside Britain they are called Women|pg||
nt|petepunt: last hand - see you all at 12:10|pg||
nt|sybarra: nicely done |pg||
nt|sybarra: last bd of this set |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our terrific operator, a job well done |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Peter who had to dash |pg||
nt|sybarra: especially thanks to the specs who offer comments and thoughts. we appreciate them |pg||
mb|1N|nt|simonr: ...and teh @D behaving!|pg||
nt|greerm: or a @C lead from North :)|pg||
nt|chick: and to you, Shirley :)|pg||
nt|simonx:  OK ... how did we do on the mystery board?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  From a Scottish perspective, a very assured debut for Yvonne Wiseman|pg||
nt|benjy: Another 11 to ENG making this a whitewash|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|d|nt|paulg:  She'll really be looking forward to the rest of the weekend now|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, nice to work with you Victor and Ben|pg||
nt|benjy: As declarer went down at the other table when on the same lead they rose ace|pg||
nt|benjy: You too Germ|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks to kibs nice comments|pg||
nt|larrymori: generic instead of trying to qualify people |pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: 3NT+1|pg||
nt|mamos: sudden 20 imps to NI  for the last board and the Welsh West error in ducking Spade at Trick 1 in 3\NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: multi 2d|pg||
nt|greerm: this the last hand here, thanks all, next round starts at 12.10 Norther Ireland time|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@S by North in the other room!!!! I think not. This will mess up the IMP scores|pg||
nt|larrymori: west might try 3@d instead but X is very popular to show cards when stuck and not have 4@h+|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: thx all - got to leave now|pg||
nt|benjy: West did well here to pass 1NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|greerm: London follow us btw :)|pg||
nt|benjy: This will be more imps for ENG|pg||
nt|mamos: ty to our op|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs for giving us the helpful info,  also some funny comments :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: undo |pg||
nt|simonx:  ... so this is the last board of the match.  Engalnd are exactly on the 101 IMP boudary for a maximum maximum victory in VPs|pg||
nt|larrymori: west might X here|pg||
nt|mamos: Ive enjoyed Petewr :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: simple 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Strange dealing machines, with 32 boards yesterday and 16 today without a slam.|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need to play this for all its worth |pg||
pc|cK|nt|simonr: Saving them all to the last match tomorrow!|pg||
nt|larrymori: east would not like it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: yes but we expected a bit more from a very experienced pair here weho made some unchraacteristic errorsd|pg||
nt|larrymori: but down 1|pg||
nt|petepunt: N off on @C lead @H switch|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3N that is|pg||
pc|cT|nt|larrymori: unless the @d is ducked|pg||
nt|simonx:  There is a trick in each suit for the defence ... what can go wrong?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|vugraphzbb: oops...sry|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lark20: Should be the same in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  small heart lead and diamond switch would be inspired against 3NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  this probably needs a diamond switch too when North gets with the @hK|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: K|pg||
nt|benjy: A spec thinks it's right to pass if you deduct a point for Jx, i take that point but yes, but a vul game, J109 look nice and Q10xx looks good, not so clear|pg||
nt|benjy: I wouldn't crime anyone for inviting, i think it's close|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h3|nt|sybarra: this hand plays nicely with esp. with hts 3/3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: it may go badly if N has to ruff with a heart honor|pg||
nt|sybarra: only has to ruff if ace of clubs cashed|pg||
nt|chick: although with the diamonds behaving, will still make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: or tried to cash |pg||
nt|petepunt: Note many would double with East to show 3@H after 2@D but support X's work less well with a weak NT system.|pg||
nt|mamos: this has not worked out well for NS|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1 off prob,  |pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  just going to play for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but costs nothing to play k and finesse in s|pg||
nt|simonx:  How soon will South play a diamond?|pg||
nt|larrymori: might have tried a red suit first with the spade as an entry|pg||
nt|mamos: ty bye|pg||
nt|petepunt: bye tx mike|pg||
