nt|Walddk2: Very aggressive bidder as you have seen by now|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: I suppose 2 @S is forcing|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But sometimes an opener has an opening hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not one of them|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Personally I think the E hand lack a 10 in spade to be an opening hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It seems to me that if 1@s is an acceptable opening bid for the EW partnership on that East hand, then West cannot afford to bid 2@s as forcing on his hand |pg||
