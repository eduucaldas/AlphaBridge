mb|1S|mb|p|nt|galadriel: Afternoon all and welcome back to the second half of this match between Scotland and Northern Ireland|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|yorkbeach:  hopefully we will get South's name corrected shortly|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy n/s to play in @S at some level|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS play weak notrump but north must have decided that is too good, with 14 and 5 good diamonds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: these good 14 counts are always difficult, do you upgrade to 15?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 4@S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:  with bare spade honours and no tens?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Good morning.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Good Morning and welcome to the Lady Milne from Belfast|pg||
nt|sheila a: We seem to be summarising the auction|pg||
nt|galadriel: Match 2 - Scotland v Northern ireland|pg||
nt|sheila a: If Ns are playing weak NT it might have gone 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good 4@S for EW subject to @H play.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Scotland are EW but we don't have names yet|pg||
nt|sheila a: It's not always straightforward to cash all your @s in this situation|pg||
nt|galadriel: The event is taking place in Belfast|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as west|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sharkey: The Law - 4@S |pg||
nt|jbgood: Roland vil gjerne (be)vise at også dansker har humoristisk sans - well done R:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes that's a good point|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  those trump intermeiates are useful|pg||
nt|roswolf: south bid 4@S I suspect|pg||
nt|galadriel: This will be a few down|pg||
nt|roswolf: if real|pg||
nt|galadriel: By North, obviously|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Should get there with west taking the bull by the horns|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to stay out of game anyway|pg||
nt|simonr: Fourth suit forcing to set up the force|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is never stopping in a partscore once East opens, misfit in @d or not|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT is also making|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wondering now whether to bid 3@S or 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt south is wondering what to do|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Må være skuffende for Vest ikke at kunne bete 4@S, og da har makker endda et trumfstik!|pg||
nt|sharkey: På en god dag slem ØV|pg||
nt|athene: well they opened 1nt in the other room - maybe that was 14-16|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S has some good fortune  J10@S doubleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I understand the vugraph operator often waits until the tray moves across|pg||
nt|simonr: 3@s would be forcing and East might have Q@s and some goodies for slam - but unlikely|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  card says 2hx shows 6@h and 5-9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not wise to give them a push here mrs caplan|pg||
nt|athene: if west bids 3@S now and then 4@S later that definitely sounds like more hand than she has|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @sQ and singleton @h would ideal|pg||
nt|roswolf: operator are you sure east is playing it?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: so if she wants to commit to spades she had better bid four right away|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: Jeg syns S skal melde 4@S første gang|pg||
nt|baardolav: Dårlig bruk av svak løft|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S er helt ude i hampen. Hvad hedder det på norsk?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@s er ok... svak løft gjør du på 3kortstøtte|pg||
nt|jbgood: kan si det, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: helt på vidda   hører jeg|pg||
nt|sharkey: Om S har noen quacks i tillegge betyr omtrent ingen ting - styrken hans er i trumfen - svakhet ingen motspillstikk|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  surprised South bid not bid 3@h given her extra heart|pg||
nt|roswolf: what west played small !? - sacre bleu|pg||
nt|galadriel: Did West really duck?|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: ignoring that seventh heart not a good idea|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's the strongest weak jump shift i have ever seen|pg||
nt|simonr: East is hating it!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with no @h stopper East was reluctant to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|galadriel: J from Jx would be a very unusual lead|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah, no|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: She didn't :)|pg||

nt|athene: a very good hand for a 3@S opener, but maybe 2nd seat at adverse it's ok|pg||
nt|athene: usually with a sound 7-4 you open 4|pg||
nt|simonr: Depends on how weak they are!|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's sensible yes 1@D 1@S 2@C 3@S should be forcing if playing WJS but it's not standard for sure|pg||
nt|sheila a: I will flick back and forward and see what I can find out re scores in the other room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yorkbeach:  Kennewell would open 4@s |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@d-2@s = weak, 1@d-1@s-2someting-2@s = invitational?|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: Skulle være mulig å unngå utgang på disse kortene?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Walddk2: ja|pg||
nt|simonr: 15-17 NT here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well game is easy to bid for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: spesielt etter 1nt åpning|pg||
nt|jbgood: litt oppvurdering fra begge sider i lukket rom|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S should be good at adverse vulnerability|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is assuming that her partner has what she would have :(|pg||
nt|sheila a: We seem to have had some difficulties with the first board - hope to find out what happened later|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: yes i think most are raising 3@S there with three quick tricks and two trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks cold to us but the English south went 2 down |pg||
nt|athene: looks as though you should lose just the two trumps and @CQ, doesn't it|pg||
nt|sheila a: The rooms seem to be linked now - got an imp showing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Mest af Øst|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes @h goes on the @dA|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H makable     but not guaranteed|pg||
nt|athene: i would expect just 4@D from west over a strong notrump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h suit combo to make 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H will come down to how you play the trumps - double finesse is normal isn't it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: This isn't the boards they are playing...|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: result to follow shortly :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: Interestingly, it seems 3NT made in both rooms on board 1?|pg||
nt|sheila a: The defence had 5 @s to cash if they did the right things|pg||
nt|galadriel: There seems to be some debate about whether the scores are accurate|pg||
nt|sheila a: Is it just this board (2) that's come out wrong?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: N hadde meldt @H forrige spill som kibs sier så 3 NT hadde gått hjem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does the encyclopedia say?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: Hi all ungagged now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: no no|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|sheila a: This isn't right - wrong board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: seems some boards are wrong...back with u shortly we hope :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Putting us to test:)|pg||
nt|galadriel: Thanks June - do we have names?|pg||
nt|sheila a: I have done the vugraph operation and it can be a nightmare if the set up isn't right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Agree, tricky assignment.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Det er vel meget rimeligt at opvurdere Vests hånd til 18-19|pg||
nt|simonr: They play Texas transfers so this should show mild slam interest. Should have just bid 4@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not according to suitplay|pg||
nt|athene: especially since there might be issues of trying to lose a trick to north rather than south, to protect the @SK (you might set up clubs for a spade pitch)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  suitplay says to lead the 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: ofte greit med EN hardmelder i et par - med begge kan det gå litt for fort i svingene|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi germ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kemperg: Hi Geoffry|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoops|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: i looked at the play record and it seems declarer did all sensible things and then claimed|pg||
nt|athene: well leading the ten works ok if you guarantee to pick the position later, but double finesse makes your life easier? nothing to think about :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it surprises me too - but never known suitplay to be wrong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  running the 10 gains if North has 4@h|pg||
nt|simonr: Suitplay is a useful freeware program - http://home.planet.nl/ narcis45/SuitPlay/|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 404  play the ace  and lead small to Q  = 78%|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the fact that it is more convenient to start @h from East may tip the odds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, not so many entries to dummy, so i don't think running the ten is really an option here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: maybe it was just some error in recording - she surely claimed 10, not 8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: ah, a spec tells me that declarer revoked|pg||
nt|roswolf: small club was a practical shot|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|sharkey: For kibs looking for commentaries in English go to Closed Room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did declarer really throw a @C on the @DA?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the pressures of playing with screens|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: This is Nordanian, horrible language|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do any of us think cashing the ace is right?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: what are they?   most players like screens|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe but they do not use them very often|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  for some it is twice a year, once in trials, once in event|pg||
nt|sheila a: Ah - this is the hand that goes with the previous auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|yorkbeach:  the encylopedia does not have the 8, which perhaps tips the odds|pg||
nt|simonr: The weak NT (12-14) but they will open most 11 counts NV|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: har du ekskludert søta bror, Roland?|pg||
nt|athene: the english NPC should have laid down ground rules at the start:- revokes are ok, but keep them for the partscores :)|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20    but n/s have 4@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  especailly with three 10s|pg||
nt|roswolf: will n/s attempt game here?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|Walddk2: Han er i lukket rom|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hehe|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: another good 14 gets upgraded|pg||
nt|athene: this one is better than the earlier hand, though|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: the 5-card suit is way better and no ugly KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agree with the upgrade this time - decent intermediates as well as 14 HCp + 5 card suit |pg||
nt|yo_yo: revokes are common,  i  unfortunately do them quite often :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: yes  agree with the upgrade this time|pg||
nt|athene: if north tries 3@S then south should go to game even with the 12 count i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: will n/s get into the bidding even:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Jeg er faktisk den søteste af dem alle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: nr. 7|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hva er det som forgår her... Skal du si 1nt på 16 hp i andre melderunde... så får du heller åpne 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: with AAK and a spade fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  very favourable lie of the cards for NS|pg||
nt|ady: north declined to go further  with good shape     maybe decided would need a transfer brake to consider game|pg||
nt|athene: north would have bid game after a super-accept but otherwise stop in 2; that is reasonable, so you play 2 or 4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no one has bid so the @S are likely to split|pg||
nt|simonr: Should be a routine 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dK lead expected|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is W asking questions?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: i would certainly open the south hand a 15-17 notrump|pg||
nt|simonr: Right suit - wrong card. Soft Q to ask for attitude?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if West leads a @h, declarer wil be doing well to make this|pg||
nt|athene: she has to duck a heart lead in both hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Poor Lane is getting all the decisions so far|pg||
nt|athene: and play east for the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: or alternatively take the double spade finesse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in view of the bidding, West is probably favourite to hold the @dA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it her first appearance, i wonder?  If so, she will be nervous|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no played last year|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Lead out of turn TD called|pg||
nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|athene: if east was east leading a heart, declarer is just going to bar a heart lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's great,  she can forbid H lead :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what did the NPC say about leads out of turn? :)|pg||
nt|athene: he said, only against NV games, so this is fine|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now that I dont do , always face down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @d to Q and @h switch and similar position|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: card face up|pg||
nt|yo_yo: west on lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  of course|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @S lead probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: discussion about who opened screen|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could still go down even with @s lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  @D view |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but probably should take two @s finesses|pg||
nt|athene: there are ways it may still go down - if south plays it and forbids a heart lead, and rises ace on a spade lead and later misguesses diamonds...|pg||
nt|athene: but i think it is more likely to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Kennewell is now declarer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that mean they can lead @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: I will just have to give result|pg||
nt|athene: isn't there a theory that says you should always accept leads-out-of-turn, because a player who doesn't know whose lead it is is not likely to know what suit to lead? :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if so that's a bad decision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how does BBO cope with dummy being declarer?|pg||
nt|athene: it says "this would never happen if they were playing online!" and sulks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we might crash :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I have always assumed that revokes and leads out of turn are impossible in an online game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe I should try it sometime :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: They did:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: tricky for south now|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: as i understand the revoke rule, it's Lane's decision as to who is declare and the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: what would 2nt have been -lebensohl-ish?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: the normal play in the club suit is to take a double finesse against the QJ, rather than just lead to the king, entries and control permitting|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|yorkbeach:  do we think she asked for a @h lead?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

nt|yo_yo: oh i see Pat , what was the lead?|pg||
nt|simonr: East play 2NT as 20-22 but will she upgrade?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  sorry South's name is still incorrect - should be Ingham, not Ingram|pg||
nt|simonr: No|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told that EW play 3@D - 3@H shows a fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with the @C10 she might have|pg||
nt|sheila a: Both pairs here are highly experienced|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks a simple 4@H but is it to bid!?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: NS have had three hands so far where they could open 1nt playing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the weak notrump was suppose to come up lots, or something|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common these days to give up on stopping in 3major facing a 2nt opener to clarify the degree of fit right away|pg||
nt|sheila a: Grant-Macdonald play Weak NT, Multi-Lucas|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  normally it does|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  England South on board 3 opened 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult bid for North|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@C is a bit of an underbid|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yorkbeach:  3@d stopper ask?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  some pairs play that 2NT-3@d-3@h promises 3 @h|pg||
nt|simonr: Completing the transfer with 3 cards is becoming popular|pg||
nt|athene: i think it makes more sense to play that 3@H actually denies a fit though? then you only force to game with at least a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like they are doing that|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Burns and Greenwood play strong NT, 5card majors and Multi-Lucas|pg||
nt|galadriel: I'm sure Greenwood would have preferred to defend with that nice @D suit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: or is it a @C raise?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a bit difficult here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  from South over 3@c|pg||
nt|athene: north would like to cue the diamonds to show a good raise in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but 3@D cue takes her past the level of 3@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North could bid 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt would get the job done|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@d stopper would be enough as the cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: you can use 2nt as a good raise also when the cue is too expensive just in general|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting idea|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT should be 1 down|pg||
nt|simonr: Once you have established a fit it avoids the two way new suit bid - is it a new suit or a cue problem?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@c + 2@s + 2@d = 8|pg||
nt|kemperg: they play 4crd major?|pg||
nt|roswolf: over a simple preference will east bid on|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes germ|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: Sjanse her for Kristiansand|pg||
nt|sheila a: 2@s from Burns is @s and a minor|pg||
nt|galadriel: But nowadays, everyone likes to compete over the opps 1NT|pg||
nt|galadriel: even a strong one|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: ikke det...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Veldig hardt å komme i 4@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: Enig|pg||
nt|baardolav: Du har ikke anledning til å finne at 4@s er spillbart på så dårlig tilpasning som her|pg||
nt|sheila a: Greenwood can guess which minor :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes she will:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Ok otherwise 2@H was the proper bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|sheila a: This may go 2 off|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah west not in the mood - may cost her side a bushel of imps|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: e.g. (1@S) 2@H (2@S) 2NT is a good raise to 3@H|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer's best hope i that whoever has 3@d throws one on the @c|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: south just has to hang on to her @DQxx when declarer runs the clubs|pg||
nt|sheila a: When it goes 1NT P P you know you have roughly half the points at least|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am sure 2NT would have been natrual for N|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|c6|nt|athene: oh yes|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: North can signal a high heart|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have considered ducking that trick just to tighten the position up a little, but perhaps she wants to keep the option of exiting in spades|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|ady: also the hearts are wide open and could go 2 down ducking|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North should throw a @d|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jbgood: men selv med minimum hos nord er det spillbart så lange han har kløver ess|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yorkbeach:  tells South to keep them|pg||
nt|sheila a: but vulnerable you risk going for 200 opposite nothing in particular|pg||
nt|roswolf: in 3@H to take the first round trump finesse is reasonable play i think|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yorkbeach:  England NS bid 3NT in the other room after West opened 1@d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not a good contract after a 1@d opening as West likley to hold the @sA|pg||
nt|athene: now there are diamond endplays|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: east should definitely not have passed 1@D, in my view|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room|pg||

nt|athene: but the opening big changes things a bit|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzbj: samme som her|pg||
nt|jbgood: legg merke til at begge sydspillerne meldte sparfargen fremfor å doble opplysende |pg||
nt|athene: with this diamond suit you lead small to the jack then back and lead the queen|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|athene: if you lead the Q first time you lose to stiff king onside|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: low spade is best    could be sing king in either hand   where as playing the Queen  gains on against stiff jack with west|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

nt|sheila a: 4@h is a good spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  suspect X = strong NT with no @h stopper|pg||
nt|athene: support doubles are not that common in a weak notrump base|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  Woodruff might have opened the South cards|pg||
nt|simonr: Not playing with this North!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or Shea|pg||
nt|athene: east might just bash 3nt now for want of a better bid|pg||
nt|galadriel: Burns not pre-empting first in hand with a hand playable in a major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @DK is nicely placed.|pg||
nt|sheila a: trumps aren't behaving as well as you'd like|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you need the double to show a strong notrump in a lot of auctions|pg||
nt|ady: ceertain to get to game|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to bid 2@H as that sort of sounds like 5-4 majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: Sparutspill holdt NS nede på 9 stikk i lukket rom. Ellers så blir det 11|pg||

mb|p|pc|h5|nt|yorkbeach:  4 top winners for NS barring accidents|pg||
nt|athene: interesting lead problem for south|pg||
nt|simonr: East now needs to invent a forcing bid|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to bid 3@C because that's not the suit she has stopped, apart from anything|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S and a @H only losers.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yorkbeach:  N may need to find a way to signal for @c|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to lead unsupported aces|pg||
nt|simonr: Too late - on the other side of the pond she could have raised to 3D forcing|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: and of course a singleton trump is a bad lead too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lucky for EW that the @hK is wrong|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2 imp å slåss om|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is it true?|pg||
nt|sheila a: undo - 4@h by E|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzbj: Fila claimer...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 3 aces I would have been doubling 4@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what now ?|pg||
nt|athene: i think passing it was ok|pg||
nt|athene: no-one forced opps to bid game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if @s4 is suit prefernce, is easy|pg||
nt|athene: so if you assume they sort of know what they are doing, making is more likely than -2, surely?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you are probably right|pg||
nt|athene: double might have a big upside if it caused declarer to play you for trump length and go down in a makeable contract i suppose|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  all I need is a singleton in either minor in partner's hand for 2 off|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  may be falt with 5@d - 1 in the other room|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzbj: ikke rart de tar igjen lukket rom|pg||
nt|ady: yes     |pg||
nt|galadriel: 5@C would be a good save - only one down , unless West finds an inspired @D lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yorkbeach:  no justice sometimes :(|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: you could bid 2@H and then if partner raises, you just bid 5@D and put the bidding boxes away to stop her going back to hearts|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|ady: just down 1    so should be a push    unlucky for Wales  if they play in 5@D in OR|pg||
nt|simonr: Playing with screens she can't see that!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont blame her for bashing, why tell opps what to lead?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kemperg: @DK 9th trick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  + @c could yield several tricks without any ruffs|pg||
nt|sheila a: swings and roundabouts of disciplined pre-empting|pg||
nt|sheila a: Once Burns didn't open it was impossible to come back in|pg||
nt|galadriel: I agree with her pass|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: yes true, double could strike oil|pg||
nt|athene: yes 3nt was not a ridiculous bid, for sure|pg||

nt|athene: i assumed NS bid 4@S over 4@H in the other room but they went there on their own|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@h is an artificial force|pg||
nt|athene: is that west might have four hearts but she will have four clubs less often|pg||
nt|ady: since you know from the bidding the opps have 9+ clubs  that is the likely lead evenif you dont tell them|pg||
nt|athene: so the heart stopper and club weakness is more of a bother than the other way round|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good point|pg||
nt|galadriel: Good result for Scotland|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: so that last one was points to ingham for not opening |pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Two chances here to open 11 counts - West gets in first|pg||
nt|athene: wow, that is a bad hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  21 was the expected small swing to Wales when East opened 1@s|pg||
nt|athene: one king, no aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  but a couple of 10s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she's young!  let her|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: good score for NS in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: having just gone down in a pushy 4@S, they respond by bidding another one on a 22 count next board|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and still a junior|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  and 3NT both make|pg||
nt|athene: i am not saying you should not open it, just that it's a bad hand :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: Not sure how wide-ranging the 2NT rebid is|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  I would not open|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: 7 eller 8 stikk i 1nt etter alle solemerker|pg||
nt|sheila a: In that case should sign off in 3NT with so little distribution|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|yorkbeach:  EW are consistent|pg||

pc|h6|nt|simonr: It is a style thing - if partner expects you to routinely open bad 11 counts then it is not a problem - but you need to be consistent|pg||
nt|yo_yo: briony youngs hoping they dont win the first 5 @H tricks|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  2@d seems obvious|pg||
nt|simonr: South thinking about 1NT or 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: south considering 1nt?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  once you subtract a king, the hand is definietly not worth 3@d|pg||

nt|simonr: Ax could result in wrong siding 1NT so 2@D is prefered|pg||
nt|athene: south decides she can't have that much as she didn't overcall 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: likely to be 3NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yo_yo: 3@H usually preemptive...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Burns-Greenwood play that a 2 over 1 response is game forcing|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  South has a tough call|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s is better but the hand has a lot of losers|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might put up the @SQ confidently on a small spade lead and lose all faith in human nature :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT might make if declarer picks the clubs, as she might given the opening bid|pg||
nt|sheila a: In the other room they may not be able to stop so low|pg||
nt|roswolf: no 41H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade lead  holds to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here's the 9th trick assuming she ducks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  who is ducking and risking a @s switch?|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might rise ace, scared of a spade shift?|pg||
nt|ady: might go up with ace |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but if West has a @h honour, it will be tough for her to switch|pg||
nt|ady: would worry about a spade switch  beffore clubs are set up|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  remember North has made a TOD|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and E has shown 5+ @h|pg||

nt|simonr: Going down now. Wrong minor to play on|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|yorkbeach:  do not understand this line of play|pg||
nt|sheila a: Q asks for attitude so might have been from KQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: even if you put in the @S10 and then set up the diamond for a spade pitch, you still have to negotiate the clubs for one loser|pg||

mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  make all 13 double dummy unless N leads a @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it would be inconsistent to pass as dealer and then rebid 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: hang partner for a 3rd hand opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: do EW play multi?|pg||
nt|athene: i thought three weak-twos|pg||
nt|athene: if east has 2@D opener available then 1@D-2@D should be a hand, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS play a Multi but not EW|pg||
nt|simonr: You need to cut partner some slack if they open in third at this vulnerability - East must be the one to move on|pg||
nt|galadriel: Some Souths might overcall 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is not trivial|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a heart lead the diamond guess is needed|pg||
nt|kemperg: right|pg||

mb|2N|nt|yorkbeach:  out of character for Brock-Gross to stop in a partial|pg||

nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: is that 3@H a one-round force or GF?|pg||

mb|3N|nt|simonr: .|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  operator, we do not believe North's bidding|pg||
nt|athene: and she didn't double 1nt for the black suits either|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or rather lack of it|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she has given up dubious competitive actions for Lent|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: She was maybe a bit too strong in points to open that at the one level|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  time to switch even if East does not lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have a lot of aces|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what is 2@c?|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2-way checkback, forcing 2@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East does not appear to be worth a game try|pg||
nt|roswolf: no this will fizzle out assuming east leads @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: MIGHT WELL TRY A SPADE|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: so they have time to get a third club trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: no this contract is doomed|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C hook is needed, but not normal play|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: now north is in the pre-balancing seat|pg||
nt|sheila a: Obviously didn't want to call it a balanced hand and open some form of 2NT equivalent|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: and surely must double 2@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: checkback - 7 loser hand  ?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C forces 2@D|pg||
nt|simonr: Checkback? They play two-way checkback|pg||
nt|athene: either to play or to make an invitational bid|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is not optimal when you are a passed hand facing a weak notrump rebid and hence can't really game force|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  totally out of character for North|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess it's easiest to just keep the same methods throughout|pg||
nt|ady: should make 9 tricks   so might be a part score swing for england|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|simonr: We have had a 6 IMP swing on the previosu board but Wales went off in 3NT|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: decalrer's only chance is to duck a club and then hope the defence don't work out to cash the @HA after @SA|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  no point ducking with 3 tricks lost already|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c6|nt|yo_yo: North will be feeling gloomy at this point|pg||
nt|athene: she has to decide now whether to play the legitimate line (win and hope the @HA is not with the club)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

nt|roswolf: going boldly where angels fear to tread is a recipe for disaster|pg||

pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  a difference in system results in a different declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  easy for South to lead the @dQ|pg||

nt|roswolf: caramba|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sheila a: 2@c checkback, so that Greenwood can invite |pg||

pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|ady: heart back and then J@S  |pg||
nt|athene: sure, but you just rise ace and play clubs to keep north out|pg||
nt|sheila a: bidding this way guarantees 5@s|pg||
nt|galadriel: North implying a 5th @S by going through checkback|pg||
nt|galadriel: otherwise she could bid a direct 2NT|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  not going to be very exciting|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT or 4@s with overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: Siste spill nå ved dette bordet, takk til Snorre for fin jobb som organisator, videoprodusent og operatør!  |pg||
nt|simonr: Operator - can you check the players card for the correct score on 30?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: EW got a little over-excited in the other room but managed to stop in time|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S+1, flat board, yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do you treat the four 5@s as 4?|pg||
nt|simonr: Played 26 in 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Wales have bid and made 4@h in the other room|pg||
nt|galadriel: @H and a minor|pg||
nt|sheila a: 3@s is GF playing lebensohl|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator. Great Job! Our appreciation to the organisers, the NIBU and BGB for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Germ and Anne for their company and perceptive comments. Also to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: give him a chance, he's doing this board :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: ths geoffry and others, back in 1 hour|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 4@s better - just testing :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead through the queen makes life harder in 4@H now|pg||
nt|simonr: Support double?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: support double|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they play in 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Shows three 1h|pg||
nt|athene: from east's side of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes scheduled re-start in approx 1hr and 5 mins from now|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jbgood: Takk også til BBO og uoppslitelige Roland Wald (som har holdt på siden 8 i dag tidlig - og som har tatt en pause), og kommentatorer Carl Mathiesen og Baard Olav Aasan!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at the other table North did not lead her partner's suit|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: it might be slightly tricky for declarer to reach dummy twice for this spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: assuming we get a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: she might just finesse once then cash the ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: Og takk til tilskuere for interessante innspill - og tålmodighet:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gratulerer til Bergen - og lykke til videre|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't really want to spend half an hour ducking hearts for a heart ruff to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: that might incur diamond ruffs and all sorts|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok|pg||
nt|athene: well that makes life easy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@h is trick on a @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: it does work well to put the overcaller on lead, which is why many pairs play a lot of transfers after overcalls|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. 1@C (1@D) X is hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  correction - South did not overcall at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well perhaps not the best game but it makes easily enough here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: right - that's why north didn't lead her suit :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 11 tricks |pg||
nt|roswolf: 10|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: a reasonable lead, to be fair - on this auction you expect declarer to have three trumps and quite possibly a ruff in hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 10 now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|simonr: Spade laed here would not be a success. We are all taught to laed partrner's suit!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  poor lead here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: partner why dont you lead my  xxxx suit|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|athene: because it was an xxxxx suit last time!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: yes but this time it's a KJ10xx suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  second chance to lead it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  players getting tired|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sheila a: Yvonne has scooshed home in 3NT on board 13|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: another swing for wales|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: not sure it's wise to finesse again|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is why you should not overcall on xxxxx|pg||
nt|simonr: Got it right this time|pg||
nt|ady: will take the lead on last hand if the scores are correct|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|galadriel: On board 13 Scotland made another "unmakable" 3NT|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: scotland gain another imp|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jbgood: farvel|pg||
nt|sheila a: She appears to have made a number of 3NTs in this match that would have daunted lesser declarers|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should be 2 off|pg||
mc|10|nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
