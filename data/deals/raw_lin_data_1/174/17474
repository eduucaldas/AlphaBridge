mb|p|nt|kemperg: good morning|pg||
nt|mrdct: need to be in 3NT rather than 5@d here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mrdct: west showing his minor 2-suiter|pg||
nt|kareno: 5 of a minor will likely make e/w but n/s have a huge spade fit so they will likely not sell at that level.|pg||
nt|frankaus: $US 100,000 to winners !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d by east is best to minimise the chance of a @c ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all participants online at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/Systems_Open.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: very pretigious event each year |pg||
nt|mrdct: east telling partner he has equal length in the minors|pg||
nt|kareno: West likely will bid clubs - then we'll see what north does.  Exciting from the get go!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: meanwhile NS are cold for 5@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Friederieke|pg||
nt|kareno: Welcome Henry Bethe :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|kareno: And that he wants to compete :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: possibly that was just the contract not the auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  Greetings|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt by south works fine!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Not the real auction, but i got here too late|pg||
nt|frankaus: team members ay - http://yehcup2011.wuxi.cn/entries.aspx|pg||
nt|kareno: South's double doesn't make sense to me - he doesn't want to defend.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mrdct: @HAQ protected now, although @s lead and @h through will put some presure on declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: but 6 of a minor still a good save|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both of our pairs using transfer responses over 1@C  and as we see here -- in competition|pg||
nt|kareno: When you save over the five-level you have to be RIGHT.  If they cannot make 5 you are wrong and if they can make six and bid it, you are wrong.|pg||
nt|kareno: You need mirrors to defeat 5@c|pg||
nt|frankaus: sometimes its right to take out insurance enen if ur -1 in both directions|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: And actually if west ducks the improbable heart lead, it will make too.|pg||
nt|mrdct: it would be a bad start to the match to defend 5@cx making when you are cold for 5@s yourself|pg||
nt|frankaus: exciting hand to get us on the way|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@d - anyone know what that is?|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like a limit raise of @s with no shortages|pg||
nt|frankaus: duessing  - good @S raise|pg||
nt|frankaus: guessing|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm hearing limit, no short suit ... and Bergen.|pg||
nt|kareno: In any event, Bocchi's sniffer is working hard!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: CC from 2010 Euro is  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is he bids one more....your guess?|pg||
nt|frankaus: bochhi's hand hast little defence|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kareno: He's all offense and no defense!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Friederike, all|pg||
nt|kareno: But happily for declarer, that is quite unlikely - more likely with the auction, however.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: easy make on the @s lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: @h lead less attractive now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kareno: Are e/w names surnames or first names, Operator?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kiwibridge: np Andrew welcome all|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not mad about his pass particularly if south's first bid showed as many as four spades with invitation.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North is  Hackett|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello and welcome to the 5th round of the qualification for the YEH Bros. Cup.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugrapha4: Hi Gary, I'll check when I can|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's customary in most parts of asia to use first names|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude    Klinger-Mullamphy odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: surnames only please|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcarroll: Nice competitive bidding to push EW to the limit|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: these names are left over from previous match|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will go down 2 but give Netherlands an IMP.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing that EW  are Verhees - van Prooijen|pg||
nt|henryb:  You do not know whether declarer's @h are that robust. Coult easily be AJx|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kareno: Declarer relieved I'm sure.  And now diamond finesse for safety.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: as first name is usually but not always the family name|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes need to hook or duck a @d to maintain communication to the entryless dummy|pg||
nt|kareno: I am told: first name. Hiroki Yokoi and  Kazuo Furuta.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|frankaus: 12 is a nice start|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed, in a short match too.|pg||

pc|d5|nt|kareno: But that's more elegant :)|pg||

pc|d2|pc|s7|nt|kareno: @s ace?|pg||

nt|henryb:  or lost in OT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|frankaus: red 2@D overcall would not be everybody's choice|pg||
nt|kareno: Mixed raise I imagine - 4 trumps and 6-9|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|kareno: Wrong vulnerability for n/s to compete further.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s the likely spot for EW now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kemperg: two easy boards to start|pg||

nt|baldfriede: oops,sorry|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   1@S= either   bal 6-9 or 13+   OR   4+@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|baldfriede: stoppers in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: no fear for joe grue|pg||
nt|kareno: Big bid by Joe Grue|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: EW had 3NT with the 2-2 @D break|pg||
nt|henryb:  and likely to give back the imp from board 1 with interest|pg||
nt|mrdct: best defence should get this for 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Now stop, or else.|pg||
nt|kemperg: Not for the OR, NS in 4@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 1|pg||
nt|kemperg: not sure of the meaning of 3@C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: whatever it is it seems a bit pushy opposite a possible flat 15 count|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I was told 3@c is puppet; I thought it was a real suit.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugrapha4: North is declarer - his favourite seat!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with stif spade opps probably have that suit so hearts and clubs are the same suit, so why emphasize hearts when u can show both>|pg||
nt|bg: S has no confidence in pards vul 2 H call|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  I think W is being too subtle|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|baldfriede: That's why I thought it is real.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s failed in the other room|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: the Open Semi-Final and Women's Final are 64 boards matches split into 4 16-board segments|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on this hand it's difficult to decide which if either @H/@S was better for defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 2nd  16-board set in the 64 board Semi-Final   Women are playing the same boards in their Final match|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|kemperg: no sorry EW|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|henryb:  lots of interest|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the event is to determine Australia Representatives or 2011 APBF [zone 6 championship] and accompanying Zone 7 playoff  then 2011 Bermuda Bowl/Venice Cup|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW were on the winning team in (last month's?) NEC Cup|pg||

mb|p|nt|mwigor: isnt it more than one down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes indeed|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: pretty conservative non-X by East|pg||
nt|mwigor: it is worth noting that 5@c makes EW - so in theory this is a good result for NS|pg||
nt|mwigor: i doubt many will find 5@c though|pg||
nt|kemperg: has chances |pg||
nt|baldfriede: This will not be easy.|pg||
nt|kemperg: first the start:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Passive defence may beat this - a @D lead gives declarer his 9th trick|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D J can also be the 9th|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h lead look normal to me.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I suppose 1@s means @h here.|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure |pg||

nt|mrdct: a nice direct auction by NS|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: however   with 5@S 3@H  DBL isn't a good choice since weak advancer [partner of doubler] will bid 1@H with 3@H & 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't have Q1 result for  Hans-Brown   maybe Adam knows [his brother is member of Hans team]|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT looks like a puppet to 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: wd by N....far from obvious to bid over 1N, as S did not say double so suboar chance of 44 hearts, and long suit is weak. but this was the time for aggression|pg||
nt|chilloncan: oh wait, sorry i thought they were going to 3N after 2C|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: i'm told  Brown +2     [or Hans -2]|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Brown up 2 imps|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c may well be a puppet to 2@d to establish this sign-off in 3@c|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if N was not planning to invite 3N, which as i said was pushy, i dont really warm up to aiming at a final contract of 3C|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|kareno: Not enough compensation for their vulnerable game.  Of course 4@h can be beaten but will it?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|chilloncan: why not just pass 1N?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: but EW could easily be going down in 5@s or 5@h in the other room so might be good for the chinese/dutch combination|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mwigor: of course -800 would not have been a good score for NS|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: lots of red suit discards coming|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oy -- i changed my mind about   with 48 to play versus  16 of 64 :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would be very confident that no table in the field will play this board at the 4-level|pg||

pc|d5|pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|mwigor: they've missed the second ruff so now only 2 down|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@C in OR|pg||

nt|mcarroll: not necessarily, defence can still get 5|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real surprise there|pg||
nt|mwigor: perhaps gosney should have led back the jack?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Which should yield 2@S and 1@D to defence for 1 down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h discard would have given it.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not any more needed to play @C|pg||
nt|kareno: There should be some sort of squeeze on this hand.  Or an ending.  Very complex.|pg||

nt|kit: 2@H won't do so well, but wouldn't have done so well defending 1NT so nothing will be lost by the overcall.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: and with this lead, maybe 2@H will do well after all|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if 2H did show hearts and a minor, good case for a trump.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I have copy of NS convention card from 2010 PABF [renamed to APBF]  but the web site is no longer available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue's conventional overcall of 1N was 2@D  [@D + major]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he's in 2@D   even less elegant than 2@H|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|chilloncan: such methods are very popular, but when a 2-suited call fails to clarify the relative lengths of the 2 suits even a little, its value is compromised|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: if Grue-Cheek play 1N-DBL as 4M & 5+ minor   seems south should correct to 2@H|pg||
nt|kit: I couldn't agree with you more Marshall|pg||
nt|mwigor: i'm a fan of asptro|pg||
nt|mwigor: 2@c = @h+another, 2@d = @s+another|pg||
nt|mwigor: then the step asks for the 5 card suit|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: and if the 5-card suit is a minor, you get to play on the 3-level|pg||
nt|chilloncan: MP-oriented methods somehow occasionally manage to wander into the IMP system of even top-notch pairs|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it is more complicated than just canape -- 2@C/@D/@H take care of certain 2-suiters so not all canape's possible after 1-suit opening|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: a trump lead will beat 6@h here i think|pg||
nt|kareno: Transfer by north.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could be 4@D & 5+@S/@C|pg||
nt|kareno: Do they play DONT?|pg||
nt|kareno: Meckwell, I'm told.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds and a major.|pg||
nt|mrdct: that will thrill south|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in fact i don't think it promises a rebid over 2@S -- but don't quote me on that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is example -- 1@D can't be canape into @H|pg||
nt|mrdct: burns law violation|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Mullamphy would be able to transfer to @H  -- guess not|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: XX probably a run from Peter, so he chooses to pass|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: Gill's problem tough here   transfer responses not requiring any points, but not forbidding them either :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL and 2N seem the front runners   hard to imagine PASS, but that would work out fine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Richman in 2N North|pg||
nt|kareno: I doubt they'll get that high|pg||
nt|mrdct: need to get @d right here to make|pg||
nt|mrdct: and sometime one might play north for a @d shortage with the long @c suit so not a guarantee to make this|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No easy lead for South.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C was best:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: Griffiths in South overcalled 1@C with 1@D  -- how did they stop in 2N???|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h the normal contract|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, indeed.  For those who don't know it, Burns' Law says you should not play a suit where the opponents have more cards than you do.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: With no convinient cue available Courtney bids a simple 4@S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrdct: good news is they are only 50s|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: commentators in the other room are discussing Shakespeare  -  that won't happen here|pg||
nt|athene: actually Courtney is quite a drama fan, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: impossible to find the double dummy defense of  @H, @D ruff @C to King, @C ruff|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer has a problem:|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but may have 4 losers anyway|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, he can't reach dummy to get get the @d right.|pg||
nt|henryb:  violating "Burn's Law": It is a bad idea to play in a contract there the opponents have more trumps than you do :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|mcarroll: N may have been contemplating a @C slam, but E doubling @S would probably stop that line of thought|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Simple squeeze on Bobby in the endgame|pg||
nt|kareno: Henry you simply have to type faster :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: there was a burns law hand about this time yesterday where 4@h made 11 tricks in the 5-1 fit after a misunderstanding about splintering in partner's suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: Neat - at least one hand had a lot of trumps!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: @d continuation will disturb NS commincations|pg||
pc|dA|nt|baldfriede: South will switch to na @d now.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|baldfriede: a*|pg||
nt|mrdct: there is quite an advantage to finish in the top 7 from the swiss to get a double-chance in the KO stage|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct.  The bottom finishers get to play a single KO and the top ones play a double KO|pg||
nt|mrdct: but the top 15 plus Mr Yeh's team all qualify for the KO stage|pg||
nt|kareno: And I assume Mr. Yeh's team qualifies into the top group?|pg||
nt|mrdct: correct|pg||
nt|kareno: Only reasonable since he is sponsoring this great event!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|baldfriede: Well done.|pg||

nt|mrdct: needed to read the @c position first!|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nah -- that can't be right|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I'd back him|pg||
nt|athene: he's not going to take a club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: that would risk going down|pg||
pc|c6|nt|baldfriede: Declarer avoided endplay for 4 down.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: so he can't fail to make 11|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|chilloncan: sorry private, though it applies here too:)|pg||

mb|4C|nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 6C fetches with normnal play|pg||
nt|chilloncan: bonsoir, lafayette:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not with normal bidding|pg||
nt|mwigor: double dummy EW can make 6@c - NS have a good save at any level|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: in a sense, though the phrase :double dummy" suffests declarer has to do something special. here he just needs to play it normally|pg||
nt|ritong: with north two suited, becomes less double dummy|pg||
nt|kit: North will certainly go to 5@H on his own|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: 5@C in the other room|pg||
nt|kit: at least I think he should|pg||
nt|chilloncan: on values N could surely bid 5H, but he may be afraid to push opps to making slam|pg||
nt|chilloncan: though admittedly after pass by S over 4C that is less of a concern. still, N hand is too pure for comfort|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: slower auction in the other room after 1@C [nat] - 2@D [michaels]|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: when void in opponents suit, decide how high you think you should compete and compete 1 level higher|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|mwigor: i like 4@d|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h7|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@d has the merit to express the full value of the hand and the demerit to place hurdle less high for north|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: but 4@D leaves NS more room to maneuver|pg||
nt|mwigor: but i'm going to bid 5@c anyway|pg||
pc|h5|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mwigor: now hopefully we make the right decision over their 5M|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|cT|nt|chilloncan: true but as against that, it creayes more bidding room for EW since N may bid 4M and then EW have many more options|pg||

nt|ahollan1: can't believe @SQ really scored|pg||

nt|baldfriede: Yes, 4@s appears to work well here.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 3@C  Bergen   [by passed hand??]|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Which actually works.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The horrible trump split kills it.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 2@S or 3@S from Gill?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Oddly enough I think 6@S makes|pg||
nt|kemperg: works I think|pg||
nt|mrdct: the way thing sit - NS can only make 9 tricks in either major i think|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kareno: Not unexpected they would make if they bid it.  Italy in trouble in this match.|pg||
nt|kareno: East must bid now!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c seems a normal contract - but north will probably compete to 5@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: or 5@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6-5s are designed for defending|pg||
nt|mrdct: and nor are 7-4s|pg||
nt|kareno: There's a famous bridge adage - "6-5 come alive"|pg||
nt|kareno: Did you mean aren't designed for defending?|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sorts of hands you have in the back of your mind the risk of pushing the opps to a making slam|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed *aren't|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kareno: And with the information provided in the auction, e/w can make six clubs by picking up diamonds - queen first.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: 3@C obvious showing a heart fit, but i don't know whether he is just improvising|pg||
nt|ahollan1: showing a Limit Raise     i never remember if that is original or modified Bergen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some situations 1N is 14-16, but i think this 1N is supposed to be 15-17|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C limit is reverse bergen|pg||

nt|chilloncan: of 1M. opps are going to outbid you in spades, so the raise risks telling opps  about how many hearts each other is likely to have, and if they reach game it will be all th eeasier ...|pg||

nt|baldfriede: If you have both majors, show them, even if you have a fit in one.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2nt showed an invitational raise with 4 spades.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: perhaps just a little bit cautious|pg||
nt|andy_h: I suspect that 2@C or 2@D by Gosney would be artificial (aka xyz)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C clarified short @C or @D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: but he does have weak trumps |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@H shows 4  [support dbl situation??]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy 3@H bid seems to support that guess|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: grab a coffee everyone :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=1@D 3@C|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mrdct: but 2NT looks OK with everything stopped nicely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N = to play if 8-11 HCP|pg||
nt|mrdct: opportunity for a non-vul game swing for japan|pg||
mc|10|nt|mrdct: and the @d7 is now going to come into play|pg||

mb|1C|mb|d|mb|1S|nt|chilloncan: true enough, but finding a double fit may help them. and as mentioned abovem it simply roadmaps the ditribution of EW assets for them. of they have a spade fit and nearly a game , ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 2H probably wont do much to cross their wires. but i do admire your 3H suggestion, esp at equal white where any potentia big pirce is less likely to be paid:)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|ritong: geoff has to find a tenth trick|pg||
nt|ritong: since he has to find a no-loser @d position|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: which is on|pg||
nt|chilloncan: he will certainly play N for Kx of Ds|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: he will try to ruff two @cs, likely|pg||
nt|chilloncan: N probably has 7 clubs for 3C with a clearly broken suit (though at these colors not totally clear), and needs 32 hearts if he wants to get the hand over before  Labor Day|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not sure why he won ace...if stiff king of spades N probably can do no harm, and also that would make Kx of Ds somewhat less likely to obtain|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Ish gaine an imp bless him|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s makes here for N/S.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|athene: so i guess it would be going down in practice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 3+  but still transfer responses|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not many boards are left, time's running out for the Brown team. A 14imp was swung on board 19 where the failing grand (due to 4-1 break) was not bid in the other room|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: also a good lead by Gosney on 17 defeated a game for 12 more|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: good start for a final set for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d for NS here|pg||
nt|kemperg: fireworks here?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: We have a slam here, but it has to be played carefully to make.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mrdct: precision style 2@c|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D doesn't inconvenience the opening side|pg||
nt|bg: maybe 6|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah could be|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south needs a raise to do that|pg||
nt|athene: but there we are :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: This 2nt bid should be a help.|pg||
nt|kemperg: was my bid too, not yours?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mrdct: with the @HA with the singleton @d, the defence can only lead trumps once|pg||
nt|baldfriede: My bid too, but it helps nevertheless.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C fit, invite+ ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: it certianly looks tempting now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: certainly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Raptor NT overcalls -- so DBL is needed to cover Strong NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@h is about the limit for NS here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h looks like a splinter agreeing @d|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@C now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @s is the better slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@c - anyone know what this is?  Better than 1nt?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hods allow quasi-2N hands to peter out in playable spots|pg||
nt|mrdct: although the @d position is quite favourable|pg||
nt|kareno: Good screech to a stop!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay it shows 18-19 balanced, thanks.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm alway a bit nervous about splintering with a stiff king|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like OR may be in time trouble - only 6 boards played|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Another 3nt.|pg||
nt|kemperg: evereybodys choice 1@S?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he has a choice in trumps, whether to lead the @DJ to pin the ten|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like 9 tricks i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry start of my message was deleted by gremlins:  flexible methods allow....|pg||
nt|mrdct: draw trumps finishing in dummy and take @d hook|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to get to this spot by many methods|pg||
nt|kareno: Note that with JTx of trumps, it is correct to lead small in case partner has queen or king.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamonds friendly!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: friendly but not passionate. if 8 and 7 interposed, then passionate|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: e.g. @SQ K A, diamond to queen|pg||
nt|mrdct: and even more nervous splintering in a suit shown by partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 1@S,   1N would show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: even if hiroki gets trumps right, might still lose 2@s, 1@c and 1@d|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andy_h: 4@S looks to be the limit here, unless declarer takes a view on the clubs|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a very aggressive double of 3@D by Gosney|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: too true! Still, if he passed, West would X himself|pg||
nt|andy_h: Certainly a nice partner to provide him with four keycards!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In this vulnerability yes.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Ruff out a small @h in @s slam to make.|pg||
nt|kemperg: I dont play semiforcing 2 openings, but still I doubt on 1@S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: can he find 8 tricks here?   my bet more likely down 2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice bidding as 4@H is destined to go down despite the 4-4 fit, at least 2@H, 1@S and a @C ruff|pg||
nt|kareno: Suit preference is my guess on the @c q|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: west may drop the @D8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: can probably surmise exact suit distribution though|pg||
nt|athene: trying to look like a man with @D108 doubleton|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bg: signals crossed here so much for fancy bids|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: the question being   is West  5332 or 5422|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he went wrong right away|pg||
nt|mrdct: and i assume 3@d showed a red 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HK for down 2   maybe duck = down 1|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|athene: perhaps he hoped for the added advantage that east might not cover with @DKx|pg||
nt|athene: he will put south with five diamonds at least for the overcall|pg||
nt|athene: so he won't think his partner could have @D10xx|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D start gives leader a lot to think about|pg||
nt|kareno: Unlikely to lose a diamond.|pg||
nt|kareno: Now he'll probably finesse the heart into the safe, north hand.|pg||
nt|mrdct: live scores http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=6c11ed3b-cd03-483e-b88f-06d33f65d300&round=6&tourid=902|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|mrdct: the general rule i have in most of my partnerships is that you can never splinter in a suit partner has shown|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kemperg: has to play fot 2 singletons!!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|kemperg: gets the @D count, so 65 known|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andy_h: Yeap had he passed then the same contract would be reached, although probably played by Gosney|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Not really; what else is there but to ruff? And after the first trump everything is clear.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|athene: could take the @D8 too on a trump promo now if they wanted|pg||
nt|mrdct: 9 tricks will double Lavazza's imp total|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d might be difficult to bid - so making 4@h here might square the board|pg||
nt|bg: good place for the    ASBAF system  "All Strange Bids Are Forcing"|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mrdct: and 10 tricks will treble it!|pg||
nt|kareno: And that can be made.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: mnow has to hope that trumps are not 5-1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: sorry, 5-0|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|athene: it wouldn't matter though; the club loser would go away|pg||
nt|athene: it's just one down whatever route you take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room   8 [where we wondered about Courtney's 2@S opener]    DeLivera opened 2@H showing weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|andy_h: So I guess in a way he was generous enough to let partner play|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: richman just better make sure he doesn't get himself endplayed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS lead low from doubleton -- apparently that also applies in middle of hand|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kemperg: no problems anymore|pg||
nt|mcarroll: in trouble now|pg||
nt|kemperg: for defens|pg||
nt|frankaus: play restricted choice when @Hj pops|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
nt|mcarroll: anyway he has the count |pg||
nt|kareno: Good result for USA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|mc|9|nt|ahollan1: and arrive in 6@H|pg||
nt|athene: ah, but the other way up|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but the opening bid was 2@H North|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: that's what i mean - once you know north will be playing it, i think that tips it against bidding it|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that's what I meant, Dave.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: no excitement here either|pg||
nt|mrdct: @h partial for NS here - don't think game will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0+  maybe canape into @C/@S   1@S=3+@S  less than game force|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to our operator and to the specs for keeping us on our toes :)  Also to Dave Thompson who is soaking up the rays in Phuket, Thailand :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: good choice to open 1NT rather than 1@h to stop the opps from having an easy 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|mrdct: transfer to @d i presume|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|athene: people often push the upper limit for 1nt overcall over 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: over 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: And I am Friederike Greifswald-Tolleson.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-8 HCP, @H or @S  --  no strong options|pg||
nt|mrdct: might collect a few hundreds in 3@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: or 500 in 3@sx|pg||
nt|mrdct: will south pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the reason is they don't want to double and have to rebid 2nt facing a possible zero|pg||
nt|frankaus: can they stay pot of 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but you can easily miss games doing this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically 1N was 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: courtney might try 3nt now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C weak  weak 2@H|pg||

pc|c7|nt|athene: but that would be a bit wild since south can't have much to pass 2@H and will usually have a lot less than he has|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you think South is in lebensohl situation where 3@D showed some values?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if south happens to have nothing, 3nt is getting doubled and so is 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think 2N is scramble rather than lebensohl|pg||
nt|kemperg: they did:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: but bad news coming soon|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andy_h: Although declarer still has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|andy_h: If trumps are 3-1, provided that the defenders duck a round of clubs, there is no entry to dummy to enjoy the clubs|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: you might argue that with some values, south must do something over 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: unless he has a penalty pass of course, but he hasn't got that|pg||
nt|athene: so when he passes and then pulls the double, he is showing a pretty weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: of course there will be times when you would like leb to be on in these situations|pg||
nt|athene: but i think in general it's better to play 2nt as scramble|pg||
nt|mrdct: @SJ here to show the @HK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andy_h: However, given that West holds the singleton queen of trumps, a good guess in clubs would see the contract for one off. If Gosney ducks the first round of trumps, declarer will ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: then be able to ruff his two little spades. If Gosney takes it with the Ace and returns a trump, declarer then guess the clubs|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|braunstar: Hey all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: disaster avoided|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hey Daniel|pg||
nt|braunstar: It seems Hans have built a nice lead into this last set|pg||
nt|braunstar: Does anyone know the results of the other match?|pg||
nt|mrdct: once north shows up with the @sA, the odds might favour south holding the other missing ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sometimes it DOESN'T??|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with 10 LTC and bad spades, W can pass... no game unless E can act  at almost any subgame level, in which case W wll have all values in reserve and can do the needful|pg||
nt|kareno: Still a vulnerable overcall ..|pg||
nt|mrdct: but when north turns up with the @sA, what has south got for his vul 1@h overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: gmta Dave|pg||
nt|frankaus: oh well -1 is good bridge (some say)|pg||

nt|chilloncan: yes, one of the seldom acknowledged -- at ;east by the busy bidders -- disadvantages of the busy-bid style, is that declarer can then all too often place all cards early, ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ESPECIALLY if the overcall is raised. and if it hurts your side to have your overcall raised, maybe it isnt the best idea |pg||
nt|kareno: Well done for the push|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: does Mullamphy EVER claim?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was 105-59 to Courtney|pg||
nt|mrdct: good @d play by south to put declarer to the guess before he has discovery of the @SA and @HQ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: it's easy to see they might reach 3n on this hand in the other room though|pg||
nt|athene: east must duck the second diamond to kill the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  West's 3rd seat opener is not automatic by any means|pg||

nt|athene: the risk of missing 3n is just too high|pg||
nt|athene: especially with a third seat opener which might be light|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  9 where Burgess misguessed trump in 3@D    NS never in the auction   1@S by West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 1@S East  [after transfer response]|pg||
