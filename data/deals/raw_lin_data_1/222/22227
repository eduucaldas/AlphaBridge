pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: they didnt find 4s in the OR on 1 |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: both teams in the same silly contract, just another flat board|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: there won't be much to the play in this good slam|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Hing finished the last set on a high, and have a great start here|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: nabil just thinking about a bad trump break|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but same 12 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pre-alerted in kiwiland|pg||
pc|cA|nt|frankaus: Yule won semi this morning by a couple of imps - originally seeded 16 so seeding committee  was of couse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW use Rusinow leads against both suit and NT   i.e.  2nd of touching honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: along with upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that @cJ was risky|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I can't see a path now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec suggests duck a club|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: a path for the defence?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: husband and wife pairings Merle & Bruce Marr and Ian & Cynthia Clayton have won the seniors title with a good victory over the Smee team|pg||

nt|bjacobs: And they are on the positive side of this deal, in the CR|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: please note Bill I upgraded from kiddies to juniors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: such progress|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: loool|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|allysophia: I'm not entirely sure its fair to call them the juniors.. when you look at  Fiona Brown who must be all of 26 on team Hanlon|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: here we go...another one loool|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6NT is ponly a fair contract, but 6@D is excellent|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|allysophia: and noone would ever accuse Mike Ware of being anything resembling |pg||
nt|allysophia: "mature"|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bjacobs: you do know Ally that these comments are recorded ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lool..stop it Bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: What you really meant was:  "Michael Ware has wonderfully youthful looks"|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Anyone know what N/S are doing?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: may be slam now?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|allysophia: that goes without saying (Ware's youthful good looks)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think North has 1430'd in clubs and now asked for @CQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think maybe they have set the wrong suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and perhaps Smirnov wouold have been better off bidding 3@D over 3@C ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this will be a VERY important board|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but of course I am just guessing|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|vugrapha3: Alex alerted the 5h bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so it must mean something for him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The good thing is that diamonds is the "boss" suit, at least of the minors.  Smirnov knows about the 8-card fit there|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: But no, I was right with my analysis, and here they are in a truly dreadful contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's up to Geo to find the deadly spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's certainly plausible to lead the spade ... it's the "unbid" suit, and he has a little something in it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My post-mortem of this auction is that the 4@C bid was wrong.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 3@C was fine ... he had no spade stopper, so the mark-time bid of 3@C was indicated|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it is clear now...missunderstanding in bidding|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: Great work Geo!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and a spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was clearly the indicated lead ... but that's easy to type.  It's not easy to do in the heat of battle|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d7|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: Specs don't like 3@C, and I understand that, but I think 3@C was ok ...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: 4@C, however ...|pg||
