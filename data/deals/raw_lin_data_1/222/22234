nt|rick3son:  Roland are a Man U fan?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary for both tables in the final quarter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has absolute max of 13 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is a [reluctant] 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but move @CQ to @DQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe 3N isn't right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans opened the North hand with 2@S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table  4@D East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last time i checked there were 13 tricks :)|pg||
nt|rick3son:  5 or 6 rounds of bidding later the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm uncertain about 4N   i think it is part of denial cue bidding, but always get confused there without being able to peek at my toes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last chance for plus|pg||
nt|xenya: most will bid slam with these cards|pg||
nt|rick3son:  spade lead yields 10th trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news   4@D went down|pg||
nt|xenya: i retract :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok here's a guess   4N = top card in @D [longest suit]  NO top card in @S [2nd longest]|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: REVOKE WAS THERE SO @HK WAS PENALTY CARD|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: much better to go down in 6@D than down in 4@D  :)|pg||
nt|rick3son:  the 4@d bid that Peter was referring to I believe was the final contract in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzwr: 4NT - one of three top honor in diamonds.|pg||
nt|psridhar: Arun invited ; his pd said no game, but he still discovered more in his hand to bid game !|pg||

nt|psridhar: FIRST requirement for ANY recovery match is "do Not lose more imps"-making your task harder|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: giving only 1 @h trick to opps|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Looks like it was corrected to 2@s=|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a push the gremlins have had their fun|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: record will show    board 29   push|pg||
nt|p dalvi: here we are watching another QF |pg||
nt|psridhar: i  have seen many players believe that to recover you have to take chances and hence risking losing more is unavaoidable|pg||
mb|p|nt|p dalvi: enterprise got 1 st swing on board 13.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: EW are playing precision|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psridhar: not logical|pg||
nt|roswolf: south being disciplined |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(14)15-17|pg||
nt|p dalvi: Hanif ever smiling guy from Mumbai playing with poona guy.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: you have to take marginal decisions alright not wild ones|pg||
nt|psridhar: you do neeed luck but cannot let go accuracy in a wild manner|pg||
nt|psridhar: making close penalty doubles is a good idea but one must wait for his chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we won't see same auction from other room   Hans-Nunn play weak NT in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psridhar: bidding thin slams is another avenue for recovery-if your luck is in slam may roll if it is marginal |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a fishy smell wafts over the ether - the english have been outbid i think|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: wow  Nunn did not upgrade  his 1N 12-14|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|p dalvi: sry Mulund |pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: playing king and a spade is not so clear since it indicates a sure entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that has to be diamond king|pg||
nt|xenya: W under pressure on the run of @Cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  odd/even carding    @C6 discourages @C and shows Reverse Suit preference -- if you can read it as high or low even|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i always found this type of hand brutal|pg||
nt|xenya: he needs to read the position now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even on run of @C  [foregoing @H toward Q]   must read the end position|pg||
nt|rick3son:  the early @h discard was excellent play|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H to Ace and if @HK doesn't fall, try to pin @DJ in west???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but perhaps diamond jack discard would have been better than low|pg||
nt|rick3son:  playing toward Q@d is a give up position|pg||
nt|rick3son:  only right in thinks KJ on his right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid did well to follow basic tenet   bare king early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe Kovachev will read THAT|pg||
nt|xenya: if W discards @DJ, S may be tempted to cross to dummy with @HA to finesse @DK -- obviously making|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jack instead of 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double-reverse psychology|pg||
nt|rick3son:  much to think about|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd like to call a friend       can someone dial  Michael Rosenberg or Bart Bramley?|pg||

nt|psridhar: one bids over the 2N )|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3rd/4th  1@D=9-15 hcp, unbal, 4+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top range is higher opposite passed hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but north can rise with club king to beat 3nt no matter who plays 3nt|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brink -the dutch player once did that to me - Xed a cue 4@C by my pd- i had King of @c , assumed it had grown in status and bid the slam -Drijver shrewdly realised it and did not ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: lead his @C ace -slam was dependant on me getting a trick for @c king|pg||

nt|roswolf: 6@D might well make on a sunny day - today its raining|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rick3son:  as partner is passed hand raising 3 4 th seat points makes sense since mostly less than 9 points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly right Leon|pg||
nt|p dalvi: good mrg subhash |pg||
nt|offthebend: this looks like a final between two evenly matched teams from Mumbai |pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: see this unfamiliarity in dealing with the X of 2@d-N thinks his pd has @d |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|offthebend: I think NS must be playing a Semi Forcing or Non forcing NT over major opening |pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe you are right michael - testing as i said|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@S seems practical|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|nt|psridhar: good opportunity for Mahchcar to pick up 11 if raju can read the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Of course, you can pick up the clubs if you're psychic|pg||
nt|roswolf: actually it seems to me to be the best play|pg||
nt|roswolf: much better than the club finesse -but then i can see all the cards|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: however....|pg||
nt|offthebend: Anal therfore chose to be aggressive with his 3-card trump support and made a limit raise |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: fairly average sequence to 5@D by the irish in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this needs some flairand/or divine inspiration|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzxs: On that lead it should be easy|pg||
nt|roswolf: as the english npc says "not any more"!|pg||

nt|rick3son:  even in the push boards there have been things to talk about|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Scanian structure over 1N   after the tournament, i'm going to find out what that means|pg||
nt|p dalvi: still lost 2 |pg||
nt|offthebend: Poddar still not on the score board |pg||
nt|p dalvi: hope they open their account now |pg||

nt|p dalvi: F nt  i suppose |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: 3@D?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2 slams and a game misplay - Machchar shd hv been withing single digit deficit by now|pg||
nt|offthebend: Sandip is getting excited with that collection :) I would be passing with his hand |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in other room  Nunn opened 1@C because they play Weak NT in 1st/2nd|pg||
nt|xenya: mystic|pg||
nt|p dalvi: some sp meaning 1S ?|pg||
nt|dburn: good hand for penalty doubles, but I don't imagine East is playing them|pg||

mb|p|nt|p dalvi: hanif will have rebid probs here |pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: it means no 4 cards in @s|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: surely one doesnt expect to recover 24 in 10 bds without breathing hard !|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: Anal is being very conservative - he should have tried 2@D at least |pg||

nt|xenya: finesse spades through W? |pg||
nt|rick3son:  double finnesse in @s may be inspired to create entries to dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter teaching us the lesson that was first written about in 1950s   1N-2@C//2@D-PASS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: entries to do what|pg||
nt|xenya: if he reads the @D position (and he should), no other line makes sense |pg||
nt|super nova: Well this hand could see the lead change for the first time in a while|pg||
