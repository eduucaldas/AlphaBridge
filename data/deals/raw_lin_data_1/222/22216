nt|arobson:  Would you open North hand Peter? Bet you would with majors reversed|pg||
nt|pitiful:  what would you do with west andrew / david|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would open 1@s regardless|pg||
nt|arobson:  In truth I'd bid 3NT with W|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i agree much happier if Majors reversed|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|pitiful:  now i would bid 3@d as north|pg||
nt|arobson:  N should get involved. |pg||
nt|arobson:  4@S at worst down one|pg||
nt|ady: hi Peter     might try a diamond transfer if available  to see if any liking for diamonds|pg||
mb|3D|an|`|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  well done north|pg||
mb|3S|nt|arobson:  I think South shd bid 4@S not 3@S|pg||
nt|pitiful:  if as andrew you had bid 3n over 1N north will probably pass|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT would have worked better in this case|pg||
mb|d|nt|arobson:  Although 1NT-P-3NT-4@C shd be majors|pg||
nt|pitiful:  personally i would have shown @d and short @s |pg||
nt|pitiful:  that would not have worked as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|arobson:  S may lead @HJ|pg||

mb|3D|nt|roswolf: a simple 3nt!?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|trotto: These cards would prevent declarer from taking 10 tricks on an endplay, of course if the declarer would play for it.  |pg||

nt|trotto: artificial, kind of cuebid...|pg||
mb|p|nt|trotto: oops, sry, priv|pg||
mb|2C|nt|trotto: so declarer played twice wrong: first he didn't play a low @d towards dummy's Ax and then he didn't duck the Q@d... very poor performance as for such experienced player!|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer to spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|trotto: in America everybody has the second chance, same as in Elblag. |pg||

nt|roswolf: e/w heading to disaster|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 2NT might be ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: might just lose 3 clubs, a spade and a diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is not known for putting the green card|pg||

nt|arobson:  Think S should lead low @H after @HA in case N has @HQxx but perhaps he can't have @HQ|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ady: n/s  likely to play 4 hearts|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: said 4 clubs 6+ clubs    does that also imply 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|arobson:  I like 4@C here as "I have the best hand for hearts" rather than the traditional 4@H-6@C|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|pitiful:  so do i andrew, basically a 2@c playing strength hand|pg||
nt|arobson:  Decl might overtake to shed the @S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|arobson:  But (at Pairs) I like letting @DJ win then @CAK and third @C ruff with @H10|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|arobson:  2@D or 3@D?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  an old fashioned 1@h opener appeals a little|pg||
nt|pitiful:  as north|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|pitiful:  2@c for me as east|pg||
mb|p|nt|arobson:  E will bid 3@D and W might chance 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|arobson:  Interesting lead for N|pg||
nt|arobson:  He could play for one quick trick with partner and lead @HQ|pg||
nt|arobson:  Or a more passive @C|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|arobson:  No other choice really|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: have to re-bid the hearts  if  there is a 2@D response  if opening with North|pg||
nt|arobson:  Declarer can now choose between club hook and spade view|pg||

nt|ady: what if north duckes the spade?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|arobson:  May decide to run diamonds on the grounds that if N has @CK, he'll have to keep two clubs anyway and endplay may work|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: 9 tricks     sorry|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|arobson:  I'm guessing six diamonds|pg||

pc|dK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s2|nt|arobson:  The only thing is North's initial pass; if he places N with @HAQJ10, he will be inclined to place @SA with S|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: could surely have afforded another club|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: if firstlead W put j@H|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|trotto: I can see him on the balcony. Greetings, rychoo! :)))))))))|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@d both majors? (Sorry, we don't know :()|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzxs: 2D is Ekrens - weak with both majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may make it hard to reach 5@d, but 3NT is playable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|roswolf: 2@C = inverted and 2!=@H|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: 2@D|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dburn: been in worse slams than this - GIB would make it, of course, but a human declarer would not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT by East not much chance on a heart lead though  |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: one of those boards where you would quite like to know the other room result  |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah sowing a weak nt - nifty piece of kit|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|trotto: 2@d in 1@c-1M-2@d is an artificial relay, forcing to game. The opener usually promises 3+M with such bid.  |pg||
nt|trotto: 2@s response promises a better hand (10+points) and exactly 4@h here. |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s9|nt|trotto: 3@h sounds encouraging, rest of bids are cuebids. I only don't know why E bypassed the @d cuebid. Slam is a very good contract here. |pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Would you upgrade West to a strong NT?|pg||
nt|dburn: but that was a weak no trump by Glynn, so Keaveney not tempted to look for a slam|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: and now we do|pg||
nt|kemperg: why start your singleton ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: against 3NT, North led the @HQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to get a ruff or two?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: no particular reason to - it isn't a crime to have a maximum every now and again|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Would you open it a 15-17 NT?|pg||
nt|dburn: no|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: the moment of truth|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|dburn: besides not having enough points, I also have two suits that I would rather the opponents did not lead|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although it has worked ok, you sort of feel that North's double is a bit dangerous against a "majors" opening  |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|kemperg: entitled to 2 or 3 trumptricks without ruffing|pg||
pc|sK|mc|6|nt|dburn: or if they did lead them, maybe partner should be declarer and not I|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT showed spades|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c was at least semi-natural|pg||
nt|dburn: and 2@d is fourth suit forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont fancy this|pg||
nt|justin c: not easy for NS to get involved here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: and 2@s shows a doubleton and denies very much in diamonds, so they actually have a pretty good chance of getting to 4@s here|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may help though|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|dburn: 5@c will also make if they bid that|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|dburn: well done - not that 5@c is a wonderful contract, but this was a good battlefield auction|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzxs: Just heard snatches of system disclosure, but I think 4@c was RKCB|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT normal 15-17 I suppose|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: probably should mean that as a passed hand, but you can understand why North didn't - passed partner, so you are unlikely to buy the hand, and you tell declarer the distribution |pg||
nt|justin c: even if 1NT by N is minors, they are the wrong way around |pg||

nt|mdgraham: N may bid 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dburn: England collected another IMP when a trump was led against 4@h on 20 and declarer decided that O'Gorman was not the sort to try that from Qxx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should play the same methods here as after an opening 2NT|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 15-17 v minors, 15-18 v majors|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: but Scotland and Wales are both powering away in their respective matches, so this looks as though it could be a pretty close Camrose series|pg||

nt|vugraphzxs: Your minor stops are quite good. 3NT seems pretty normal.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|justin c: the logic of that is (i think) that over 1m by the oppo, pard will often reply at the 1 level, and you can rebid a comfortable 1NT|pg||
nt|justin c: over 1M, he will more often reply at the 2 level, forcong you to bid 2NT, so you need to be a bit stronger|pg||
