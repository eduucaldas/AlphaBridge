mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|arobson:  N-S can make 5@C, E-W 4@H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|arobson:  (or 4@S)|pg||
nt|phil352:  opposite a passed partner is there a case for bidding a lot faster than just 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|arobson:  Slow start as neither side finds their nine-card fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|arobson:  North will raise with juge minors|pg||
nt|arobson:  huge|pg||
mb|3H|nt|arobson:  Wow great shpt from Walker. Now East will bid 5@H over 5@C (think N should bid 5@C now)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4H|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|arobson:  Good shot - 4NT implying this 7-4 shape (not Bwood)|pg||

nt|dagold: hi Phil|pg||
nt|arobson:  North's 4@C underbid worked well for it tempoed East into 4@H then pass. A 5@C bid would have got 5@H. Perhaps East should have bid 5@H over 5@C the way it went but wasn't so easy.|pg||

Good tactic against ordinary opp. I tried it once in the World Pairs final (they ducked from Kx - oops).|pg||

nt|dagold: likely|pg||
nt|phil352:  interesting methods david - how do they deal with regular 5 card invites?|pg||
nt|arobson:  No mention of @Ds - except to show @Hs|pg||
nt|dagold: these are my methods, they are pretty good but dont deal with the double fit so well|pg||
nt|dagold: 1n-2@d-2@h-2@s= art inv|pg||
nt|dagold: 5@s inv goes through stayman|pg||
nt|phil352:  i use the spade invite that way, very useful|pg||
nt|arobson:  N will want to bid 5NT pick a s;am soon and S may bid 6@D|pg||
nt|dagold: very good on the 5332 quant hands and also locating 5 card suits in openers hand but opener needs Qjxxx as a minimum to show it as 5. Toms alternative was to bid 3! showing a 5 ...|pg||
nt|dagold: card minor or both minors but that would deny 3@h if both minors...|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|dagold: bid 3@c|pg||

nt|arobson:  England miss game on 21, S did well to respond|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|dagold: I have been asked to explain 1N. It is not the only way to go but 1@d-1@s-2@c then 15 points hard to show after say 2@d since not enough for 2N but quite heavy to pass. Also it ...|pg||
nt|dagold: shuts the opponents out|pg||
nt|arobson:  Unlucky for England that 6@H fails, but you have to say the problem begun with the opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzxt: East's collection of passes getting more and more disorganised|pg||
nt|vugraphzxt: Live score updates for all matches here - http://www.camrosebridge.com/matches.php|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxt: South had long think before passing|pg||
nt|dagold: yes it is not really 1N but I have a feeling that my current partner as well as my X partner would do it!|pg||
nt|arobson:  At the POrtland Club (no conventions) the bidding would go 1@D-6@D.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dagold: not unreasonable Andy|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|arobson:  Alex Allfrey and I play secondary transfers so that 1NT-2@D-2@H-3@C shows diamonds; over which 4@C shows a double fit and 4@D is six-ace BW.|pg||
