pc|h4|nt|trotto: i have to admit this 1@s is very strange. Many players would bid 2@s here which is more encouraging as this enigmatic 1@s. |pg||
nt|ady: wonder if this could make if declarer crosses to A@H playes diamond finesse  which north might not cover  and then run the rest of the hearts     north might be in trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|dburn: good thinking :)|pg||

nt|ady: spades and a diamond|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cicus: not that game is good|pg||
nt|cicus: but this time makes with all those pleasant lies in @Cs and @Hs|pg||
nt|cicus: and @Ds as well, J10 coming down|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|trotto: need a @c now to open|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: essentially, with eight tricks on top (including the diamond finesse) declarer just runs his suit, and North cannot hold the position|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm seems declarer on the right track|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Geoffrey|pg||
nt|dburn: South might have dropped the ten of diamonds, to give declarer the option of playing him for @d109 doubleton|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: england need to pull their socks up early|pg||
nt|dburn: now, declarer can play North for @dKx, but in that case he might just as well cash the hearts anyway|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d4|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tgricks in OR|pg||
nt|dburn: North didn't bid in the strong club auction at the other table, so South didn't lead a spade and East didn't have a problem|pg||
nt|dburn: North can throw his spade now, effectively giving up on beating the contract, but he will probably throw another club in the hope that South can stop the suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: if declarer had any doubts about the layout north's trance now will have given it away|pg||
pc|h5|nt|trotto: Pawlowska shoud have concerns with this misfit hands after 1@s, anyway 4@s is easy to let out. |pg||
nt|ady: east could still make though without J@C   cash the ace  and exit with a spade|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|trotto: if Mlynarczuk wouldn't switch towards @cs, his partner would be endplayed and forced to play from under then K@c|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|odysseus69: 3 laydown games on 3 boards|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: settled for just 2 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 1@c - 2@s would have been weak, so this shows something slightly better.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: and probably shows exactly 5 spades|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|odysseus69: East hoping for Kxxx hearts and D Ace|pg||

nt|csabi: but he cannot do anything else|pg||
nt|csabi: he can play for the drop|pg||

pc|dT|nt|cicus: small @H here then @SJ back will give headache to declarer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|karesz: a tipical play by szilagyi, baut now it is not enough|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: hands 14 and 15   expensive  for England|pg||
nt|cicus: this is for the gallery|pg||
nt|cicus: wile, at the same time, creates horror in declarer's hearts|pg||
nt|karesz: but perhaps Dombi ii afraid of the @c j in West's hand....|pg||
nt|cicus: exactly, declarer might abandon the @C finesse for fear of letting W in but what else can he do|pg||
nt|cicus: he might try to drop the @CJ as some extra chance|pg||
nt|karesz: 3 @c 4 @d and 2 majors are enough for him, so playing @c K @c 10|pg||
nt|cicus: he can do nothing if E has A-middle honour-8 left|pg||
nt|vugraphzzv: or he can play @C K and after a small the if west has only double clubs..|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|odysseus69: first good news AX diamond|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|odysseus69: aand all over|pg||
nt|brolucius:  We assumed at the other table that the England West had mis-sorted his hand, since it is nothing like the 15-17 balanced that 1NT showed in his system.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: hmm this bd wont score well for the english either|pg||
pc|c9|nt|trotto: but as we can see WE are old fashioned :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|odysseus69: might as well try hearts|pg||
nt|karesz: and the next board seems to get some more, so interesting rounds can be come!|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|s6|nt|karesz: ing|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sundiszno: two more sessions of 16 boards each coming, starting 16.00 CET|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: ouch|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s8|pc|cJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|trotto: playing a small @d is a good idea. |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|mc|8|nt|trotto: this may result in a squeeze against one of the opponents who hold both red suits. |pg||

nt|vugraphzxs: I'm now wondering if I missed a bid. They seemed to pass that one out very quickly... Could be an adjustment.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 2@s does  seem unlikely, but I didn't see a 4@s card!|pg||
nt|ady: 2 big hands for Pownall|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of thesession     thx all  thx specs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thats all- thanks all|pg||
mb|p|nt|trotto: it worked well, but only because N felt himself like in squeeze. Some call it a "memory squeeze" some banana-strawberry squeeze.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm you have given us some hope michael!?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|odysseus69: sorry - my screen suggested finished - clearly plenty more|pg||
nt|karesz: a hard double by kemény in the open room!|pg||
mb|p|nt|trotto: sorry: well done Ramot ofc|pg||
nt|ady: Q@D   well placed    3NT should make|pg||
nt|roswolf: will n/s attemppt game!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: this is the last board|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|cicus: 3@S lead director|pg||
nt|karesz: double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may stop in 2NT?|pg||
nt|karesz: for foreingner: kemény means hard in English|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: surely 1@S was misguide|pg||
nt|csabi: clever bid by south|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: well thank heavens for small mercies|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on a spade lead would be very lucky to make    but unlikely to get a spade lead on the auction|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant understand this -QX looks like good support on this auction|pg||
nt|csabi: worth at least 5 IMP, maybe 12|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|trotto: a very good lead by Banach leaving declarer with only 9 tricks. |pg||
nt|roswolf: this is the last bd of the segment -restart in 15-20 mins approx|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 2@h promised @d support|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see why N bid 3@S, does he really want to play 4 with those valueless @Hs?|pg||
nt|cicus: he could have passed and later reopened with 3@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|odysseus69: I suppose that if pd did not open 2H then 2H is only 5 and promises 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: well only 23 hcp    reasonable not to push the boat out|pg||
pc|s5|nt|trotto: however WE have to be careful in the further defence. |pg||
pc|c4|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however it must be 5 good hearts since 2C available as a diamond raise|pg||

nt|vugraphzzv: we will continue about 12:35|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cicus: ruff-sluff is coming, if only for the sake of the audience|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|trotto: Anyway, declarer choosed to give up the @d, which is very strange, he lost the chance for an overtrick. |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|karesz: why?|pg||
nt|karesz: ha could make!|pg||
nt|karesz: he|pg||
nt|csabi: 3 tricks earlier perhaps|pg||
nt|sundiszno: not now, I think|pg||
nt|karesz: and a small heart to the 8?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: they have a @d and a @s trick more|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: well this is a success!|pg||
