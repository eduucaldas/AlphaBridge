nt|fabsayc: and NT|pg||
nt|xenya: it's astounding how they can manage this system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will slow down Reid|pg||
nt|rick3son:  Roland are a Man U fan?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary for both tables in the final quarter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has absolute max of 13 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is a [reluctant] 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but move @CQ to @DQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe 3N isn't right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans opened the North hand with 2@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psridhar: hi buddy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: 3@H asks controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this takes them past 3N|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think step 1 = 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D = 5 controls  |pg||
nt|rick3son:  we are haeding to a likely minus for east west now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table  4@D East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last time i checked there were 13 tricks :)|pg||
nt|rick3son:  5 or 6 rounds of bidding later the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm uncertain about 4N   i think it is part of denial cue bidding, but always get confused there without being able to peek at my toes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last chance for plus|pg||
nt|xenya: most will bid slam with these cards|pg||
nt|rick3son:  spade lead yields 10th trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news   4@D went down|pg||
nt|xenya: i retract :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok here's a guess   4N = top card in @D [longest suit]  NO top card in @S [2nd longest]|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzxz: REVOKE WAS THERE SO @HK WAS PENALTY CARD|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: much better to go down in 6@D than down in 4@D  :)|pg||
nt|rick3son:  the 4@d bid that Peter was referring to I believe was the final contract in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzwr: 4NT - one of three top honor in diamonds.|pg||
nt|psridhar: Arun invited ; his pd said no game, but he still discovered more in his hand to bid game !|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  so if Wales score 18 or more, they guarantee 2nd place|pg||

nt|psridhar: FIRST requirement for ANY recovery match is "do Not lose more imps"-making your task harder|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: giving only 1 @h trick to opps|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Looks like it was corrected to 2@s=|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a push the gremlins have had their fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: record will show    board 29   push|pg||
nt|p dalvi: here we are watching another QF |pg||
nt|psridhar: i  have seen many players believe that to recover you have to take chances and hence risking losing more is unavaoidable|pg||
mb|p|nt|p dalvi: enterprise got 1 st swing on board 13.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: EW are playing precision|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psridhar: not logical|pg||
nt|roswolf: south being disciplined |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(14)15-17|pg||
nt|p dalvi: Hanif ever smiling guy from Mumbai playing with poona guy.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|psridhar: you have to take marginal decisions alright not wild ones|pg||
nt|psridhar: you do neeed luck but cannot let go accuracy in a wild manner|pg||
nt|psridhar: making close penalty doubles is a good idea but one must wait for his chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we won't see same auction from other room   Hans-Nunn play weak NT in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: bidding thin slams is another avenue for recovery-if your luck is in slam may roll if it is marginal |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a fishy smell wafts over the ether - the english have been outbid i think|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: wow  Nunn did not upgrade  his 1N 12-14|pg||
nt|psridhar: not wild slams that need too much|pg||
nt|buddyshah: always  a learning  experience  ,  reading  your comments  PS. :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|p dalvi: this tournamnet is taking place at Mulung Gymkhana in Mumbai.|pg||
nt|roswolf: combined 24 count and no bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: but still reached 3N|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|p dalvi: sry Mulund |pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: playing king and a spade is not so clear since it indicates a sure entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that has to be diamond king|pg||
nt|xenya: W under pressure on the run of @Cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  odd/even carding    @C6 discourages @C and shows Reverse Suit preference -- if you can read it as high or low even|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|p dalvi: could have uses that entry to play D |pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d5|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i always found this type of hand brutal|pg||
nt|xenya: he needs to read the position now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even on run of @C  [foregoing @H toward Q]   must read the end position|pg||
nt|rick3son:  the early @h discard was excellent play|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H to Ace and if @HK doesn't fall, try to pin @DJ in west???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but perhaps diamond jack discard would have been better than low|pg||
nt|rick3son:  playing toward Q@d is a give up position|pg||
nt|rick3son:  only right in thinks KJ on his right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid did well to follow basic tenet   bare king early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe Kovachev will read THAT|pg||
nt|xenya: if W discards @DJ, S may be tempted to cross to dummy with @HA to finesse @DK -- obviously making|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jack instead of 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double-reverse psychology|pg||
nt|rick3son:  much to think about|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd like to call a friend       can someone dial  Michael Rosenberg or Bart Bramley?|pg||

mb|p|nt|p dalvi: 4s by N or 3nt by E|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: 1/2 imp carryover|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ostensibly  positive response needs 10+ hcp and 3+ controls|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for finishing higher in qualifying stage|pg||
nt|rick3son:  BBO presents some quality vugraphs and this one surely does not disappoint|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if south bids, i'm lost |pg||
nt|psridhar: another point in recovery matches is ' try to put opponents in unfamiliar situations" -these may be otherwsie not attempted by you for  the risk it entails|pg||
nt|roswolf: shows spades|pg||

nt|xenya: they have wrongsided a club contract -- what about no-trumps?|pg||
nt|roswolf: somebody pulled the plug|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all again|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1 step up is a meaningless relay that says  tell me more|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: that also...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@S=7@C 1@S (32), can't resolve|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now we know the problem with relays|pg||
nt|psridhar: for eg players are prepared to handle intervention over their 1N-but when you chip in over their 2N opg they may be unprepared ( these are less discussed situations usually as no ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: one bids over the 2N )|pg||
nt|psridhar: another unfamiliar territory is when u bid in the second round of their 1N opg -eg (1N)-P-(2@h)-P-(2@s)- 3@h |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: all contracts now wrong sided|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i was taught   lead the 3-card suit   of course we don't know if that is @H or @D|pg||

nt|p dalvi: puria  normally would have bid 2S with his hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxs: 6@d but not 6@c, by the looks of it|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D might well make on a sunny day - today its raining|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rick3son:  as partner is passed hand raising 3 4 th seat points makes sense since mostly less than 9 points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly right Leon|pg||
nt|p dalvi: good mrg subhash |pg||
nt|offthebend: this looks like a final between two evenly matched teams from Mumbai |pg||
nt|offthebend: Hi prakash |pg||
pc|d2|nt|psridhar: see this unfamiliarity in dealing with the X of 2@d-N thinks his pd has @d |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|offthebend: I think NS must be playing a Semi Forcing or Non forcing NT over major opening |pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe you are right michael - testing as i said|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|psridhar: good opportunity for Mahchcar to pick up 11 if raju can read the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Of course, you can pick up the clubs if you're psychic|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psridhar: however....|pg||
nt|offthebend: Anal therfore chose to be aggressive with his 3-card trump support and made a limit raise |pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: fairly average sequence to 5@D by the irish in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this needs some flairand/or divine inspiration|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzxs: On that lead it should be easy|pg||
nt|roswolf: as the english npc says "not any more"!|pg||
nt|dburn: on this lead, declarer can cash two clubs, then spades to pitch her heart, then pick up diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: whether or not she will do this remains to be seen - probably as good a chance as any other|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing the @HA is not a lead against a slam experts like to make|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this RDBL = SOS|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and a number of specs getting that one right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to me this is 100% penalty but we have visited this ambiguity before|pg||
