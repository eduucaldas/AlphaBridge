mb|p|mb|1N|nt|fluffy: 1NT response from Lantaron will show spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|fluffy: just your usual 1@s response|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 2@s is a raise with 4cards|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|fluffy: lantaron goes straight with @hQ10 assuming they will work|pg||
nt|fluffy: 5@c shows 1 keycard|pg||
nt|fluffy: and 5@d asks for @sQ|pg||
mb|d|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 5@h will show @sQ+@hK|pg||
nt|fluffy: now lantaron knows about @hAK and @sQ|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|fluffy: he only needs @hJ and a king (or a singleton for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|fluffy: 5NT asks for something more|pg||
nt|fluffy: and 6@c denies|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|fluffy: I am surprised by the 4Nt jump because Lantaron-Goded play 2NT as a strong enquiry looking for singleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 6@d is a last train|pg||
