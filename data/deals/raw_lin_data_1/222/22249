mb|p|nt|sundiszno: according to gyorgy szalay, it is much easier to upgrade the east hand to 1NT, than 1NT-3NT|pg||

nt|trotto: i have to admit this 1@s is very strange. Many players would bid 2@s here which is more encouraging as this enigmatic 1@s. |pg||
nt|ady: wonder if this could make if declarer crosses to A@H playes diamond finesse  which north might not cover  and then run the rest of the hearts     north might be in trouble|pg||

pc|s2|nt|trotto: need a @c now to open|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm seems declarer on the right track|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Geoffrey|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 20-20     |pg||

nt|odysseus69: SBU off to a lucky start- missing a game and gaining imps|pg||
nt|cicus: the match is practically over with this game let be made|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: however this wont be bid to game like so many seem to be:)|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether the Robson School of Risky Overcalls would recommend 2@h with those East cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Károly and Gábor|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks like another game attempt for england -4@S is just about decent at these colors|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Osborne fingering the pass card...|pg||
nt|roswolf: well so would i|pg||
nt|karesz: down, but 5 @d would down, too|pg||
nt|csabi: with those 10s W's overcall is acceptable|pg||
nt|vugraphzzv: W said: table of your dream..|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, borderline but all of us would make the bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 3 laydown games on 3 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: settled for just 2 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 1@c - 2@s would have been weak, so this shows something slightly better.|pg||
nt|cicus: yes I know there is 30 more boards to play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: and probably shows exactly 5 spades|pg||
nt|zoro40: I think 4spades would be better contract|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|odysseus69: East hoping for Kxxx hearts and D Ace|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: key card keeps pairs out of many bad slams|pg||
pc|s6|nt|csabi: now the @D finesse has no chance|pg||
nt|karesz: not at all, East always bid 4 @s|pg||
nt|csabi: but he cannot do anything else|pg||
nt|csabi: he can play for the drop|pg||
nt|csabi: I think he will too|pg||
nt|cicus: he may play for the drop in @Ds - and (on another day) find that S has led the Q from @CKQJ :)|pg||

nt|zoro40: Leading spades is verx dangerous in the situation when you do not know how many spades the declerar has|pg||
nt|cicus: I think this game always makes if declarer cashes 2 @Ds then shoots back the club and waits|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cicus: discovered for sure that @DK is behind him - well played|pg||
nt|csabi: can try an endplay|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: passing 2@S would have been my choice|pg||
nt|csabi: south must kepp club|pg||
nt|csabi: keep|pg||
pc|s4|nt|karesz: and if @c is 4-4....|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: get diamond right for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: but awkward   as 3 rounds would give west a ruff|pg||
nt|ady: would need to play a diamond to the 8 to get 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: I think likely 8 tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: however, why not make him do the hard work|pg||
nt|zoro40: I think Lakatos  should play the King of clubs instead of spades. Szilagyi should have DB or DBx. From DBxx he should drop small|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|vugraphzzv: yes, it was a good chance, but not now..|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: now 9|pg||
nt|kuttner: will S make the @S finesse?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d4|nt|csabi: @H count is unknown for S|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|zoro40: No other chance|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, and if the spade switch comes from East then it does not harm|pg||
nt|cicus: but destroys the entry position for the double squeeze|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|roswolf: and the transfer system would have gained for once|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|odysseus69: aand all over|pg||
nt|brolucius:  We assumed at the other table that the England West had mis-sorted his hand, since it is nothing like the 15-17 balanced that 1NT showed in his system.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this bd wont score well for the english either|pg||
pc|hA|nt|trotto: but as we can see WE are old fashioned :)|pg||

nt|karesz: but wuol have been @d ruff, heart back, red ruff for 4 down|pg||

pc|c9|nt|zoro40: 2 diamonds ruff first|pg||
pc|d5|pc|sT|pg||

mb|p|nt|karesz: for dumbo, is'nt?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|karesz:  hard bid, i think|pg||

nt|karesz: 5 @d probably 2 down (3 clubs and the @h Q|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if the clubs are not taken early, NS can be eliminated, but still if north is on lead at the end, there is only the finnesse|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sundiszno: in 5@d|pg||

nt|vugraphzxs: I'm now wondering if I missed a bid. They seemed to pass that one out very quickly... Could be an adjustment.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 2@s does  seem unlikely, but I didn't see a 4@s card!|pg||
nt|ady: 2 big hands for Pownall|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of thesession     thx all  thx specs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thats all- thanks all|pg||
nt|cicus: please count |pg||
nt|zoro40: After overruffing by 10 of clubs I meant|pg||
nt|karesz: so i think this is Gamax's day|pg||
mb|2D|nt|trotto: it worked well, but only because N felt himself like in squeeze. Some call it a "memory squeeze" some banana-strawberry squeeze.|pg||
mb|p|nt|karesz: 3 NT?|pg||
nt|zoro40: But it is only 2off (1spade, 3 hearts, 3 diamonds)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|roswolf: hmm you have given us some hope michael!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: sorry - my screen suggested finished - clearly plenty more|pg||
nt|karesz: a hard double by kemény in the open room!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|trotto: sorry: well done Ramot ofc|pg||
nt|ady: Q@D   well placed    3NT should make|pg||
nt|roswolf: will n/s attemppt game!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: this is the last board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: 3@S lead director|pg||
nt|karesz: double?|pg||
nt|karesz: wow!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: may stop in 2NT?|pg||
nt|karesz: for foreingner: kemény means hard in English|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|roswolf: surely 1@S was misguide|pg||
nt|csabi: clever bid by south|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: well thank heavens for small mercies|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on a spade lead would be very lucky to make    but unlikely to get a spade lead on the auction|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant understand this -QX looks like good support on this auction|pg||
nt|csabi: worth at least 5 IMP, maybe 12|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|trotto: a very good lead by Banach leaving declarer with only 9 tricks. |pg||
nt|roswolf: this is the last bd of the segment -restart in 15-20 mins approx|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 2@h promised @d support|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see why N bid 3@S, does he really want to play 4 with those valueless @Hs?|pg||
nt|cicus: he could have passed and later reopened with 3@S|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suppose that if pd did not open 2H then 2H is only 5 and promises 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|ady: well only 23 hcp    reasonable not to push the boat out|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|trotto: however WE have to be careful in the further defence. |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: however it must be 5 good hearts since 2C available as a diamond raise|pg||
