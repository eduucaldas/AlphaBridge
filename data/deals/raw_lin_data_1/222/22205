nt|vugraphzan: 3rd hand is not multi in the previews hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: hand is worth nearly 9 tricks. Still I prefer 1@s|pg||
nt|xenya: left to their own devices, they would have reached 4@S in no time|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: What is double I wonder|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  1@d transfer; supposedly, I would think, 3@c xhould deny 3 card heart support |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: they should . Fisher took a hugely conservative view in the other room|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|udo: same auction , as in open room|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb:  I mean 2@c should deny 3+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think they will have time to light the shabat candles|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think normal is to play 1@h = 3, 2@h = 4 card support|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|henryb:  other bids show 2 or fewer @h|pg||
