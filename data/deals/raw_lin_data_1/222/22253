pc|sK|nt|trotto: East, Sylwester Mlynarczuk, a very experienced matchpoints player, in  the past we won everything what was to win with Artur Rutkowski. Maybe that's why they splitted up.|pg||

nt|henryb:  If you aren't listening, and are not on the web server|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|cicus: hand too good for weak 2 in their methods|pg||
mb|4S|mb|4N|nt|cicus: could have bid 4@S straight away|pg||
mb|p|nt|trotto: a very dynamic hand here, but I expect it will end up in a typical 4@s here. |pg||

pc|d5|nt|trotto: i have to admit this 1@s is very strange. Many players would bid 2@s here which is more encouraging as this enigmatic 1@s. |pg||
nt|ady: wonder if this could make if declarer crosses to A@H playes diamond finesse  which north might not cover  and then run the rest of the hearts     north might be in trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|dburn: good thinking :)|pg||

pc|d6|nt|cicus: the preempt had a nice effect - the opponents kept silence|pg||
nt|cicus: unfortunately, partner kept silence as well|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: if north covers the diamond   again in trouble with the hearts   has all the vital cards   if north lets go a spade  declarer can then give up a diamond  and the defence only has 3 ...|pg||
nt|ady: spades and a diamond|pg||
nt|cicus: oh|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cicus: not that game is good|pg||
nt|cicus: but this time makes with all those pleasant lies in @Cs and @Hs|pg||
nt|cicus: and @Ds as well, J10 coming down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|trotto: need a @c now to open|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: essentially, with eight tricks on top (including the diamond finesse) declarer just runs his suit, and North cannot hold the position|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm seems declarer on the right track|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Geoffrey|pg||
nt|dburn: South might have dropped the ten of diamonds, to give declarer the option of playing him for @d109 doubleton|pg||

nt|zoro40: Hi all|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ady: 20-20     |pg||
nt|ady: north might suggest a partial in spades or diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: SBU off to a lucky start- missing a game and gaining imps|pg||
nt|cicus: the match is practically over with this game let be made|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: however this wont be bid to game like so many seem to be:)|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether the Robson School of Risky Overcalls would recommend 2@h with those East cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Károly and Gábor|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: this looks like another game attempt for england -4@S is just about decent at these colors|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Osborne fingering the pass card...|pg||
nt|roswolf: well so would i|pg||
nt|karesz: down, but 5 @d would down, too|pg||
nt|csabi: with those 10s W's overcall is acceptable|pg||
nt|vugraphzzv: W said: table of your dream..|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, borderline but all of us would make the bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|odysseus69: 3 laydown games on 3 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: settled for just 2 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 1@c - 2@s would have been weak, so this shows something slightly better.|pg||
nt|cicus: yes I know there is 30 more boards to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and probably shows exactly 5 spades|pg||
nt|zoro40: I think 4spades would be better contract|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: East hoping for Kxxx hearts and D Ace|pg||
pc|sK|nt|odysseus69: key card keeps pairs out of many bad slams|pg||
pc|sA|nt|csabi: now the @D finesse has no chance|pg||
nt|karesz: not at all, East always bid 4 @s|pg||
nt|csabi: but he cannot do anything else|pg||
nt|csabi: he can play for the drop|pg||
nt|csabi: I think he will too|pg||
nt|cicus: he may play for the drop in @Ds - and (on another day) find that S has led the Q from @CKQJ :)|pg||

pc|cA|nt|kuttner: no squeeze needed now|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s6|nt|lechcold: chyba nie ma jak tego wygraæ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East and West are both former partners of mine- Bill Whyte retired from Scottish bridge over 30 years ago to pursue a career with IBM- he has retired again I think from IBM and ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: taken up International duty for Scotland|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|h4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|zoro40: Leading spades is verx dangerous in the situation when you do not know how many spades the declerar has|pg||
nt|cicus: I think this game always makes if declarer cashes 2 @Ds then shoots back the club and waits|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cicus: discovered for sure that @DK is behind him - well played|pg||
nt|csabi: can try an endplay|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: passing 2@S would have been my choice|pg||
nt|csabi: south must kepp club|pg||
nt|csabi: keep|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|karesz: and if @c is 4-4....|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: get diamond right for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: but awkward   as 3 rounds would give west a ruff|pg||
nt|ady: would need to play a diamond to the 8 to get 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: I think likely 8 tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: however, why not make him do the hard work|pg||
nt|zoro40: I think Lakatos  should play the King of clubs instead of spades. Szilagyi should have DB or DBx. From DBxx he should drop small|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzzv: yes, it was a good chance, but not now..|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|ady: now 9|pg||
nt|kuttner: will S make the @S finesse?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|csabi: @H count is unknown for S|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|zoro40: No other chance|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, and if the spade switch comes from East then it does not harm|pg||
nt|cicus: but destroys the entry position for the double squeeze|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: I suppose North might balance, but that would be a pretty brave thing to do|pg||

nt|cicus: it is the doubler's partner who shall bid aggressively|pg||

pc|c4|nt|vugraphpl2: sorry|pg||

nt|zoro40: 3spades was serious?|pg||
nt|cicus: serious=I definitely see good slam prospects|pg||
nt|zoro40: Sorry it was not serious beacuse Szilagyi would have bid 3NT by having the ace of spades|pg||
nt|kuttner: in this case why 4@C?|pg||
nt|cicus: but this situation is unclear as @Hs have not been agreed|pg||
nt|kuttner: 3@S just a cue|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't think East's distribution has been discovered|pg||
nt|kuttner: some unwaited IMP-s to the leader (+63)|pg||
nt|zoro40: I wonder what E would have bid if W started his bidding by 2diamonds|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D surely because E would have thought West had 5 of them|pg||
nt|zoro40: It sounds well if 2diamonds always promises 5card at least|pg||
nt|zoro40: 5cards|pg||
nt|cicus: I think that is the case with them, 2@C shows only 2|pg||
nt|zoro40: Gabor! What would you think about 4NT bid at this moment?|pg||
nt|kuttner: W has not all the info needed, but with these cards the trial to slam is realistic|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe AK of spades?|pg||
nt|kuttner: p has 6+@H...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|odysseus69: looks like an imp for England|pg||

pc|h7|pc|cQ|nt|cicus: but would it be passable?|pg||
nt|csabi: and the more tricks the opps can take the more chance that they err :)|pg||
nt|zoro40: I think Dumbo will not be happy again. It usually destroy the partnership if somebody does not lead in the agreed 9fit suit|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|karesz: or a heart-club squezze against E|pg||

pc|d5|nt|cicus: I don't think so and in that case what does 5@H mean?|pg||
nt|zoro40: I do not think. After cues the heart fixed as trump|pg||

mb|p|nt|trotto: sorry: well done Ramot ofc|pg||
nt|ady: Q@D   well placed    3NT should make|pg||
nt|roswolf: will n/s attemppt game!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: this is the last board|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|cicus: 3@S lead director|pg||

nt|karesz: wow!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: may stop in 2NT?|pg||
nt|karesz: for foreingner: kemény means hard in English|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sundiszno: so this is the last boarsd|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: surely 1@S was misguide|pg||
nt|csabi: clever bid by south|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: well thank heavens for small mercies|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on a spade lead would be very lucky to make    but unlikely to get a spade lead on the auction|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant understand this -QX looks like good support on this auction|pg||
nt|csabi: worth at least 5 IMP, maybe 12|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|trotto: a very good lead by Banach leaving declarer with only 9 tricks. |pg||
nt|roswolf: this is the last bd of the segment -restart in 15-20 mins approx|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 2@h promised @d support|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see why N bid 3@S, does he really want to play 4 with those valueless @Hs?|pg||
nt|cicus: he could have passed and later reopened with 3@S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|odysseus69: I suppose that if pd did not open 2H then 2H is only 5 and promises 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kuttner: ty all:)|pg||
nt|sundiszno: thx all for watching, and gongatulations to GAMAX team, they will represent Hungary in the EC|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|sundiszno: and I also want to thanks my splendid operators, Bence Bozzai, Daniel Tubak, Krisztina Ormay, Csaba Konkoly and Andrea Fischer|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|odysseus69: however it must be 5 good hearts since 2C available as a diamond raise|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|trotto: Anyway, declarer choosed to give up the @d, which is very strange, he lost the chance for an overtrick. |pg||
pc|cK|nt|karesz: why?|pg||
nt|karesz: ha could make!|pg||
nt|karesz: he|pg||
nt|csabi: 3 tricks earlier perhaps|pg||

nt|karesz: and a small heart to the 8?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: they have a @d and a @s trick more|pg||
