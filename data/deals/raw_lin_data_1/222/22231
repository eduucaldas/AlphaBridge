pc|s8|pg||
pc|h7|nt|trotto: East, Sylwester Mlynarczuk, a very experienced matchpoints player, in  the past we won everything what was to win with Artur Rutkowski. Maybe that's why they splitted up.|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed michael|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: 71% for NS|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: e/w may get to 3NT    which should fail on a spade lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  If you aren't listening, and are not on the web server|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: hand too good for weak 2 in their methods|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|trotto: a very dynamic hand here, but I expect it will end up in a typical 4@s here. |pg||
nt|roswolf: south is tempted to make a game try but discretion is the better part of valour here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|dburn: Patrick Jourdain won't be missing this one|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lechcold: po celnym wicie Mirka|pg||
pc|sT|nt|trotto: i have to admit this 1@s is very strange. Many players would bid 2@s here which is more encouraging as this enigmatic 1@s. |pg||
nt|ady: wonder if this could make if declarer crosses to A@H playes diamond finesse  which north might not cover  and then run the rest of the hearts     north might be in trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|dburn: good thinking :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|cicus: the preempt had a nice effect - the opponents kept silence|pg||
nt|cicus: unfortunately, partner kept silence as well|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: more imps dribble away to the Irish|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|ady: if north covers the diamond   again in trouble with the hearts   has all the vital cards   if north lets go a spade  declarer can then give up a diamond  and the defence only has 3 ...|pg||
nt|ady: spades and a diamond|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|cicus: not that game is good|pg||
nt|cicus: but this time makes with all those pleasant lies in @Cs and @Hs|pg||
nt|cicus: and @Ds as well, J10 coming down|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|trotto: need a @c now to open|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: essentially, with eight tricks on top (including the diamond finesse) declarer just runs his suit, and North cannot hold the position|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm seems declarer on the right track|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Geoffrey|pg||
nt|dburn: South might have dropped the ten of diamonds, to give declarer the option of playing him for @d109 doubleton|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: england need to pull their socks up early|pg||
nt|dburn: now, declarer can play North for @dKx, but in that case he might just as well cash the hearts anyway|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: 11 tgricks in OR|pg||
nt|dburn: North didn't bid in the strong club auction at the other table, so South didn't lead a spade and East didn't have a problem|pg||
nt|dburn: North can throw his spade now, effectively giving up on beating the contract, but he will probably throw another club in the hope that South can stop the suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: if declarer had any doubts about the layout north's trance now will have given it away|pg||
pc|cT|nt|trotto: Pawlowska shoud have concerns with this misfit hands after 1@s, anyway 4@s is easy to let out. |pg||
nt|ady: east could still make though without J@C   cash the ace  and exit with a spade|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|trotto: if Mlynarczuk wouldn't switch towards @cs, his partner would be endplayed and forced to play from under then K@c|pg||
nt|trotto: so well done for Mlynarczuk aka "Old Miller"|pg||
nt|trotto: :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||

nt|psyck: there goes the dummy entry|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sunit: @C lead expected since south does not have any other lead|pg||
nt|sundiszno: but what if macskásy passes, and honti reopens with a dbl?|pg||
nt|csabi: after the lead declarer has not much chance, the @DK is known to be wrong and guarded|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 20-20     |pg||
nt|ady: north might suggest a partial in spades or diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: SBU off to a lucky start- missing a game and gaining imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: however this wont be bid to game like so many seem to be:)|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether the Robson School of Risky Overcalls would recommend 2@h with those East cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Károly and Gábor|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: this looks like another game attempt for england -4@S is just about decent at these colors|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Osborne fingering the pass card...|pg||
nt|roswolf: well so would i|pg||
nt|karesz: down, but 5 @d would down, too|pg||
nt|csabi: with those 10s W's overcall is acceptable|pg||
nt|vugraphzzv: W said: table of your dream..|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, borderline but all of us would make the bid|pg||
pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: 3 laydown games on 3 boards|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: settled for just 2 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 1@c - 2@s would have been weak, so this shows something slightly better.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: and probably shows exactly 5 spades|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: East hoping for Kxxx hearts and D Ace|pg||
pc|cT|nt|odysseus69: key card keeps pairs out of many bad slams|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|csabi: now the @D finesse has no chance|pg||
nt|karesz: not at all, East always bid 4 @s|pg||
nt|csabi: but he cannot do anything else|pg||
nt|csabi: he can play for the drop|pg||
nt|csabi: I think he will too|pg||
nt|cicus: he may play for the drop in @Ds - and (on another day) find that S has led the Q from @CKQJ :)|pg||

pc|d9|nt|ady: get diamond right for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: but awkward   as 3 rounds would give west a ruff|pg||

nt|roswolf: the hands running quiet|pg||
nt|roswolf: byt maybe this has more scope|pg||
nt|roghog:  http://www.masterofmalt.com/distilleries/whyte-and-mackay-branded-whisky/  might tell you why Irving Gordon's new nickname is Mackay|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: a 4@S for n/s now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s may push to 4@S      may fail   |pg||
mb|2H|an|3 cards or 3433|nt|trotto: But like I wrote before it didn't matter if he was going to win it or not... NS were in a bad spot. |pg||
nt|golfsquash: FNT|pg||
nt|ady: only J@D lead gives 4@S a real chance|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4@S looks normal at this level|pg||
nt|ady: the ruffing club finesse does not help|pg||
nt|cicus: but it was righ, losing only against singleton !K offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|csabi: KJx in north is 2 cases, singl K or J behind is another 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes  I am sure they will play in game|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vugraphzxs: The N/S card is here: http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/Osborne%20%20Hinden.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|trotto: 14+11 on NS may result in a 3NT, but this 1st seat preempt may bring something on here. |pg||
nt|roswolf: couragrous bid by north|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Did you mean west? :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: west needs to keep away from diamonds|pg||
nt|csabi: this one is brave bid|pg||

nt|csabi: I would've bid 3@C in North on 2@H :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzv: everybody has points and gond cards..:)|pg||
nt|karesz: Dumbo knows, S has singleton (void) in @H, so his ace is a very good card|pg||

pc|dA|nt|roswolf: very wise|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this set has had a lot of flat hands and 1 horrendous misadventure in the Open Room|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: but defence spoil the plan|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: declarer needs to play a diamond to the 9     and later enter dummy and play Q@D|pg||

nt|ady: difficult line to get right|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: yup but nice to find|pg||
nt|ady: you playing for jack or 10 doubleton rather than just the K@D with west|pg||

nt|roswolf: now another hand pregnant with possibilities|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|trotto: Because while playing 3NT is always better to finesse the J@c, because it seems like East has no entry to his @s|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: looks like 2NT here|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|ady: now can make    9@H good|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup i agree|pg||

pc|s2|nt|karesz: a tipical play by szilagyi, baut now it is not enough|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: hands 14 and 15   expensive  for England|pg||
nt|cicus: this is for the gallery|pg||
nt|cicus: wile, at the same time, creates horror in declarer's hearts|pg||
nt|karesz: but perhaps Dombi ii afraid of the @c j in West's hand....|pg||
nt|cicus: exactly, declarer might abandon the @C finesse for fear of letting W in but what else can he do|pg||
nt|cicus: he might try to drop the @CJ as some extra chance|pg||
nt|karesz: 3 @c 4 @d and 2 majors are enough for him, so playing @c K @c 10|pg||
nt|cicus: he can do nothing if E has A-middle honour-8 left|pg||
nt|vugraphzzv: or he can play @C K and after a small the if west has only double clubs..|pg||

nt|psyck: & that would promote the 4th trump in W|pg||
nt|sunit: he might try a dia hook twice|pg||
