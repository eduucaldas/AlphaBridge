nt|vugraphzxz: welcome Buddy Sir |pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: 13th round|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still ok in @H & @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: a gentle start|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: sorry @H & NT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psridhar: note that NS cd hv gone + defending 4@c|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 3@D 3163|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and NT|pg||
nt|xenya: it's astounding how they can manage this system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will slow down Reid|pg||
nt|rick3son:  Roland are a Man U fan?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary for both tables in the final quarter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has absolute max of 13 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is a [reluctant] 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but move @CQ to @DQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe 3N isn't right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans opened the North hand with 2@S|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi buddy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: 3@H asks controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this takes them past 3N|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: i think step 1 = 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D = 5 controls  |pg||
nt|rick3son:  we are haeding to a likely minus for east west now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: total of 12 tricks in the deck  AAAA=8  KKKK=4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 12 controls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table  4@D East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last time i checked there were 13 tricks :)|pg||
nt|rick3son:  5 or 6 rounds of bidding later the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm uncertain about 4N   i think it is part of denial cue bidding, but always get confused there without being able to peek at my toes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last chance for plus|pg||
nt|xenya: most will bid slam with these cards|pg||
nt|rick3son:  spade lead yields 10th trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news   4@D went down|pg||
nt|xenya: i retract :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok here's a guess   4N = top card in @D [longest suit]  NO top card in @S [2nd longest]|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: REVOKE WAS THERE SO @HK WAS PENALTY CARD|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: much better to go down in 6@D than down in 4@D  :)|pg||
nt|rick3son:  the 4@d bid that Peter was referring to I believe was the final contract in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzwr: 4NT - one of three top honor in diamonds.|pg||
nt|psridhar: Arun invited ; his pd said no game, but he still discovered more in his hand to bid game !|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzwr: the rest is what al says.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s3|pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: double dummy can he make|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: looks like a push on this lead|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: E claimed 6 |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|psridhar: not convincing, certainly not the ideal start to recovering 24-losing 3 more|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|s7|pc|c9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: declare should make this but 2 overtricks in the other room is a little difficult to believe|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: funny|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: not now but had he left diamonds intact he could have|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rick3son:  if trumps were behaving the @c lead would have given it away|pg||

nt|psridhar: FIRST requirement for ANY recovery match is "do Not lose more imps"-making your task harder|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: giving only 1 @h trick to opps|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Looks like it was corrected to 2@s=|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a push the gremlins have had their fun|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: record will show    board 29   push|pg||
nt|p dalvi: here we are watching another QF |pg||
nt|psridhar: i  have seen many players believe that to recover you have to take chances and hence risking losing more is unavaoidable|pg||
mb|p|nt|p dalvi: enterprise got 1 st swing on board 13.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: EW are playing precision|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psridhar: not logical|pg||
nt|roswolf: south being disciplined |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(14)15-17|pg||
nt|p dalvi: Hanif ever smiling guy from Mumbai playing with poona guy.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: you have to take marginal decisions alright not wild ones|pg||
nt|psridhar: you do neeed luck but cannot let go accuracy in a wild manner|pg||
nt|psridhar: making close penalty doubles is a good idea but one must wait for his chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we won't see same auction from other room   Hans-Nunn play weak NT in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psridhar: bidding thin slams is another avenue for recovery-if your luck is in slam may roll if it is marginal |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a fishy smell wafts over the ether - the english have been outbid i think|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: wow  Nunn did not upgrade  his 1N 12-14|pg||
nt|psridhar: not wild slams that need too much|pg||
nt|buddyshah: always  a learning  experience  ,  reading  your comments  PS. :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|p dalvi: this tournamnet is taking place at Mulung Gymkhana in Mumbai.|pg||
nt|roswolf: combined 24 count and no bid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: but still reached 3N|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|p dalvi: sry Mulund |pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: playing king and a spade is not so clear since it indicates a sure entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that has to be diamond king|pg||
nt|xenya: W under pressure on the run of @Cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  odd/even carding    @C6 discourages @C and shows Reverse Suit preference -- if you can read it as high or low even|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|p dalvi: could have uses that entry to play D |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: might well end up a push|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|rick3son:  west will be squeezed on the run of the clubs|pg||
nt|psridhar: +130 and a push|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|p dalvi: declarer might get sqzed now|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i always found this type of hand brutal|pg||
nt|xenya: he needs to read the position now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even on run of @C  [foregoing @H toward Q]   must read the end position|pg||
nt|rick3son:  the early @h discard was excellent play|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H to Ace and if @HK doesn't fall, try to pin @DJ in west???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but perhaps diamond jack discard would have been better than low|pg||
nt|rick3son:  playing toward Q@d is a give up position|pg||
nt|rick3son:  only right in thinks KJ on his right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid did well to follow basic tenet   bare king early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe Kovachev will read THAT|pg||
nt|xenya: if W discards @DJ, S may be tempted to cross to dummy with @HA to finesse @DK -- obviously making|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jack instead of 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double-reverse psychology|pg||
nt|rick3son:  much to think about|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd like to call a friend       can someone dial  Michael Rosenberg or Bart Bramley?|pg||
nt|rick3son:  phone a friend life line|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h9|mc|6|nt|fabsayc: xx Kx K is what you are projecting as ending with diamond jack pitch|pg||
