nt|ady: spades and a diamond|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|trotto: need a @c now to open|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: essentially, with eight tricks on top (including the diamond finesse) declarer just runs his suit, and North cannot hold the position|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm seems declarer on the right track|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Geoffrey|pg||
nt|dburn: South might have dropped the ten of diamonds, to give declarer the option of playing him for @d109 doubleton|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ady: 20-20     |pg||
nt|ady: north might suggest a partial in spades or diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: SBU off to a lucky start- missing a game and gaining imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: however this wont be bid to game like so many seem to be:)|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether the Robson School of Risky Overcalls would recommend 2@h with those East cards|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: this looks like another game attempt for england -4@S is just about decent at these colors|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Osborne fingering the pass card...|pg||
nt|roswolf: well so would i|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 3 laydown games on 3 boards|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ady: settled for just 2 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 1@c - 2@s would have been weak, so this shows something slightly better.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and probably shows exactly 5 spades|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: East hoping for Kxxx hearts and D Ace|pg||

nt|ady: south in fact not in the balancing position|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Scotlands ladies fizzled out- 3D over 2NT was singleton|pg||

nt|dburn: but I don't think Goodman believes that is what it meants|pg||
