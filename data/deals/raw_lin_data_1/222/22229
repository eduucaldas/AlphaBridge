nt|bjacobs: 6NT is ponly a fair contract, but 6@D is excellent|pg||

pc|h3|nt|allysophia: that goes without saying (Ware's youthful good looks)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think North has 1430'd in clubs and now asked for @CQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think maybe they have set the wrong suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and perhaps Smirnov wouold have been better off bidding 3@D over 3@C ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this will be a VERY important board|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but of course I am just guessing|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|vugrapha3: Alex alerted the 5h bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so it must mean something for him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The good thing is that diamonds is the "boss" suit, at least of the minors.  Smirnov knows about the 8-card fit there|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: But no, I was right with my analysis, and here they are in a truly dreadful contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's up to Geo to find the deadly spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's certainly plausible to lead the spade ... it's the "unbid" suit, and he has a little something in it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My post-mortem of this auction is that the 4@C bid was wrong.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 3@C was fine ... he had no spade stopper, so the mark-time bid of 3@C was indicated|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it is clear now...missunderstanding in bidding|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: Great work Geo!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and a spade lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was clearly the indicated lead ... but that's easy to type.  It's not easy to do in the heat of battle|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Played by South, 6@C is a make|pg||
nt|serhat: so they might bid it the other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer will be able to discard his two diamond losers on a spade and a heart, and the defence cannot attack the diamonds|pg||

pc|hK|nt|serhat: Nye is sorry for 2d bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He spent the rest of the auction backtracking.  Surely he owed partner a 4@H bid over 4@C|pg||
nt|serhat: because he didnt have real 2d bid. may be 3c better there|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so the match is getting closer|pg||

nt|bjacobs: One of the problems with this auction is that E/W don't know South's suit.  Hence they have no easy cue-bids|pg||
