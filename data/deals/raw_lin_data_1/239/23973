mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 5@d on EW if W can find @cQ|pg||

nt|tomi2: if double would not be something artifical (e.g. don't lead my suit), this hand looks fine for a double to invite partner to bid 4@H|pg||

nt|tomi2: his play. That would be a great help here - it replaces "long" and "not long" by real facts, but it is probably a bit too expensive to have such cameras on each table|pg||

nt|fabsayc: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekren_convention|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for the 2@D bid on last hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: balicki :: tells zmud to play a card so he throws the Ace Diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vasmar: here Romanian E-W bid and made 3NT|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vasmar: 600|pg||
mb|p|nt|monde9: this board now for the prize of the match|pg||
nt|pisoy: good result for Romania|pg||
nt|arvidsson: NS makes 3@S|pg||
nt|arvidsson: and EW makes 3@D |pg||
mb|1S|nt|arvidsson: but doubt this action will end in 3@S|pg||
nt|frajerzyna: dwa ostatnie rozdania nie powinny zmieniæ wyniku, oba wygl¹daj¹ na ca³kowicie p³askie|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: seriously for me is 1 of 2 thoughest tournaments in the world |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 3+fit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|monde9: 6 @D can be made here with some guessing|pg||
nt|vasmar: 5@D is safer|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: Mr. Ekren gave up his own convention, draw your own conclusions|pg||
mb|3N|nt|arvidsson: a Kibitzer informed me that @C is the suit to play for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|monde9: but not a good contract|pg||
nt|vasmar: than 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: just in @D is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: gd guessing|pg||
pc|s7|nt|arvidsson: 5@C looks like it is close to make for EW, but now we play 4@S x|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|monde9: that lead helped a little bit but doesn't change much|pg||
nt|monde9: now 10 of @C |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vasmar: spade is better for the defense i think|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|pisoy: now is a small problem..he played for double finess and the @C is 4/2|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|tomi2: let's have a quick look at the other results, Israel winning against Monaco but not very high, England has beaten Italy. Netherlands took 24... atm Italy is out of the Medals... ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: Germany 7th with some 3VP to the 6th Poland, France, Sweden and Russia follow but they are all 8VP behind Germany|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzgq: asking about leads|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|arvidsson: not much to hope for will be 1 off if EW cash ther @D |pg||
nt|tomi2: two or three VP are hanging on the TD decision|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|vasmar: he can still make it fi he finds hearts|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s3|pc|h5|nt|pisoy: he can play for 3/3@C|pg||
nt|monde9: the dec will not try the finesse in @H maybe ; he's counting & counting |pg||
nt|pisoy: or @H to the 9|pg||
nt|monde9: now every trick is for one down |pg||
nt|pisoy: or @H to the J|pg||
nt|monde9: & pressure is higher : last board :)|pg||
nt|pisoy: which is normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's something happening here -- what it is ain't exactly clear|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|arvidsson: West was uncertain of the lenght and N will make 4@S|pg||

nt|vugraphzgj: this is the last board of the set|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  so Barnet's congratulations are probably safe|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with a maxium swing of 24 per board|pg||
nt|barnets: dec won the @H lead with the ace|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|barnets: played the @CJ which was allowed to score|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: and that was his last trick for down 5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders have 4@h 5@d and 2 aces if they find them|pg||
nt|barnets: @CK looks better to me|pg||
nt|ritong: making it more difficult to duck|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: thus restricting signals|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|barnets: now down 2 only|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ritong: i got it right, barnet?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|barnets: yes |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d2|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|barnets: maye south should duck the @CK and get a signal from partner on second club|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|barnets: it could be very important|pg||

mc|5|nt|yorkbeach:  France has a comfortable lead over Scotland at the moment http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=915&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|vasmar: so 41-59 1 board to play|pg||
nt|vasmar: 3NT is a better spot than 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lets just say ekren is a risky convention|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: noisy EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either @SK wasn't played on 1st round  or @SA was played on 2nd round|pg||
nt|ritong: ça va fibnir avec une donne sans aspérités|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|arvidsson: length of s partners @C (not that easy to think he has 6@C)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pisoy: true|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|monde9: in the other room my friend Briciu stopped in 3 @S but his optimistic partner bidded 4 :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok I have heard it is a natural bid and E decided to gamble with a good @D suit|pg||
nt|arvidsson: S having some problems figuring out what has happend|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 2nt lookes lika a psyc in S perspective might try 4@S here|pg||
