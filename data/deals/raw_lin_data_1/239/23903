nt|roswolf: looks like the 5-1 fit will play quite well|pg||
nt|patricck: The 3 card diamond opening effectively stopped NS competing to 3@D|pg||

pc|c7|pg||

pc|h4|nt|mamos:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm for running scores|pg||
nt|patricck: well, I have a 3rd way to play the heart suit :)|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|mamos:  3 way Club|pg||

nt|runnerup:  @c lead and south in in troubles|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: now should go down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Murat|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So - now we can think about, why E/F play 3 @C instead of only 2...|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have passed 2@S and the 3 level may be uncomfortable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not really imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @C8 a weapon|pg||
nt|runnerup:  guessing @d makes the day of course|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
nt|jaapfr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has to make the best oof his Diamonds though defence has a lot of work to do to make 5 tricks as well|pg||
nt|runnerup:  for some reason ns never bid in board 1 -in other room -and so nice 4 counter as south had -4 @s +1 a push :) |pg||
nt|jaapfr: but if @DQ in tr 3 he is down|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@C is 98% forcing for most players|pg||
nt|murat e: with the diamond queen dropping all kinds of games possible here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|runnerup:  north had sorry|pg||
nt|patricck: technically it loses on this layout, but only if North can duck smoothly wen a low heart is led from dummy|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @d tap may minimize declarer's options|pg||
nt|jbgood: ...and pushed Israel to the down-level|pg||
nt|tweety1: hi|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|mamos: both these teams in qualifyiong positions at this stage|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, that is true|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|oosmanb: lucky he hit solid @H|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ady: n/s need to defeat this to prevent a possible 6 or 7 imp loss  may still lose 2 or 3|pg||

nt|ady: sorry     still making   3 trump tricks 1 heart and 1 spade|pg||
nt|murat e: finland selling out easily here might have competed with both majors|pg||
nt|skaftij: Well, he could|pg||
nt|barnets: yes it is|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: did north really duck!?omg|pg||
nt|patricck: potentially a part score swing for Israel, if NS can buy 3@D on the replay, but quite likely a flat board|pg||
pc|d6|nt|murat e: hi sunil|pg||
nt|mamos: defenders have their chance now  -- no clues for declarer I think|pg||
nt|runnerup:  what are the odds -about 50-50 I assume|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzgq: sry lost play here |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|tweety1: must guess @h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|oosmanb: can cash winners and exit @S for +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: gromov explains to opps ..its a russian finesse @H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: agree but @DT looks a tad more logic|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: see other room|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|runnerup:  now defnce can beat -needs @c now |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|skaftij: As specs point out, @c King will be favourably placed if @sK onside|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mamos: only eight tricks for declarer now |pg||
nt|jaapfr: must play @C now|pg||
nt|murat e: there is a heart guess but declarer can arrange timing and even if he guesses wrong can drop the heart king|pg||
nt|tweety1: now @c|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: Scotland lost their last macth to Italy|pg||
mc|10|nt|jbgood: as the cards lie I guess even 3 hearts would make - but you are happy to have pushed them|pg||

nt|mamos:  although declarer surely likely to play South for @dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N thinking|pg||
nt|mamos:  i dont understand why  South didnt discard Spade to give count|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Would 4 diamonds to the Queen really be your first discard-choice?|pg||
nt|mamos:  no I agree but surely more @d length in South might even imagine 5 wirth @c 4-0|pg||
nt|mamos: this wont make|pg||
pc|h4|nt|blum1956: In fact, it is hard to bid 3NT, but it makes as EW cannot take both a club and an extra diamond trick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but who will lead a @H small in dummy against 6@C?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm |pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes indeed IF 6@C @H2 lead and @H4 in dummy one can make 6@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but very DD story imo|pg||
nt|mamos: i agree jaap|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @c looked making -and this -no chance so strange 6nt |pg||
nt|andyv:  that play takes a lot of nerve|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer has to play well to make 5 dia after heart lead|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I lost play ù|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Its been suggested the 1@S shows 0-3@S and no @H stop, can someone confirm|pg||
nt|skaftij: In OR, 1NT showed 14-16, so impossible for Jonsson-Baldursson to stop short of game|pg||
nt|barnets: if dec leads clubs nort should win the ace and clear hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: dec should of course then test spades first|pg||

nt|andyv:  what would you lead, Patrick?|pg||
nt|patricck: I would probably make it hard for partner by leading small, but there is a lot to be said for the Q@S|pg||
nt|patricck: on a small spade lead West will want to play AK when East has Jxxx and declarer Qx|pg||
nt|andyv:  on opening lead, small @s (some would play the 10@s to start the unblock) is fine.  Here where you are pretty sure you need to collect 4@s tricks, the Q@s is best|pg||

nt|400 volt: 8-17 hcp in general|pg||
nt|400 volt: obviously east upgraded because he had 6@C and @C 1098 and @S 10|pg||
nt|roswolf: the norsemen in the other room did well for team Monaco|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c finesse was forced.  Declarer needed K@c to be in N hand...otherwise S would get in and push a @h thru before the @d pitch|pg||

nt|400 volt: it's even 2 down on a @D lead|pg||

nt|barnets: dec now had entries to cash a top spade then get to dummyw ith club ruff|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos:  low scoring in most matches over these first few boards - these two teams lead in Group A  but scores are very closely bunched as we  would expect|pg||
nt|patricck: The Hungarian East switched to a small @S on board 5 just the same as this room. I fear that I would have failed the test as well, but I agree leading the Q@S is better|pg||

nt|mamos:  ah   wont East have Spade trick or Spade exit|pg||
nt|ady: as said still only 8 tricks with an end play|pg||
nt|skaftij: 2@s, sry pard for bidding a 4 card suit :-)|pg||
nt|patricck: While declarer can still make on a @C switch it doesn't seem likely he would play for exactly this layout and spurn the 50% chance of a club finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  now it's more difficult...he needed to lead a @h at trick 2 so that his timing would be better (he could ruff a 3rd @h after only one round of @cs were played to see if suit broke)|pg||
nt|patricck: Still just 1-0 after 6 comparisons, but I think there could be a swing on board 7|pg||
nt|barnets: In 3N duck a hear win the heart lose a diamond to East then cash clubs and run the @S8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos:  oor|pg||
nt|mamos:  Germany picking up imps regularly|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|tomi2: a bit lucky that this -4 is a) not doubled and b) 4@S is not making, but it will still be expensive|pg||

nt|mamos:  play is very slow NS especially it seems|pg||

nt|roswolf: this should be flat|pg||
nt|petergill: Flat board - 4@H and 4@S both are good contracts - I'm not sure which contract is superior, perhaps 4@H.  |pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: when I was on board 8 I accidently clicked redeal and this blocks the scoring system|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think when you do not cash @DA one could make 4@H (which bright kib wants o review in detail?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: comfort break|pg||

pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  3 NT must be played by West - otherwise a @C-lead might defeat it|pg||

nt|andyv:  I agree...one of Bob Hamman's great strength is he can completely forget the previous board and focus on the board in front of him.  We all try to do that...sometimes we fall short.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Norway is now 11th - 12 VPs behind Greece in 9th - Greece demolishing Turkey - a big surprice|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Even if Norway qualify to the next step they will not be able to achieve a decent result at the end after three heavy losses against Israel, Germany and Hungary|pg||

mb|2C|nt|farrukh: but uncluckily going down on @h ruff|pg||
nt|mamos:  21-19 points here so i muiight sneak another coffee in|pg||
nt|patricck: Slanm can be made if you play spades the right way, but should you really do that even if you know you have no club loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: I think 2@H is @S + any minor, so Rehder expects @D but it might be some great fit, if partner really has clubs|pg||
nt|djneill:  2@h waiting, denies @s|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jkotor: czy mi siê zdaje, czy mo¿na przewidzieæ po takim pocz¹tku, ¿e N ma co w pikach i mo¿e 2@s powiedzieæ po 2@h|pg||
nt|400 volt: on this very very friendly layout north/south can make 6@D, but it's even hard to bid 5@D|pg||
nt|mamos:  chance for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  2@d shows good @h raise|pg||
nt|barnets: who get into 8th presently|pg||
nt|murat e: nex is ukraine but with this score they are too much behind so race will go on between greece and norway it seems..|pg||
nt|murat e: 8 is hungary|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  North's hand  worth a second bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls kibs appreciate : being operator is one of the toughest jobs on earth imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sorry West, trying to keep up with bidding next hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i am very serious about that|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@D a limit raise|pg||
nt|pelu:  130 and 150 both = flat board|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|tomi2: he has some values he wants to show but he can't find a neutral bid. double would pretty sure be penalty for them|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@S TOO|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sunsamvar: @ha was led against 4@S on bd 11 and decl got the @Cs wrong|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jkotor: niby to powinno byæ 19+, a tutaj 19tym jest singlowa Dama, ale z drugiej strony 8 lew do BA...|pg||
nt|arderi:  Looks like a relay sequence|pg||
nt|patricck: cashing the Ace first only caters for sinleton Q, J or 9 in the North hand. Cashing the King first is best when South ahs Singleton (, 5 or 2|pg||
nt|patricck: 9, 5 or 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: west is on lead if they get to 6d and should make|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mamos:  alas not|pg||
nt|arderi:  Jonsson is asking for something and Baldursson has something and the plane lands in 6@s :)|pg||
nt|barnets: yes a close match|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mlodygda83: szlemik taki sobie - albo podzia³ trefli 3-3, albo 4 trefle razem z D10 w kierach|pg||
nt|garden2005: widzi kto szansê wygrania szlemika?|pg||
nt|kamyk: no ale wist w @CW:(|pg||
nt|lechcold: niby oczywist wist waletem trefl wypuszcza|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ewentualnie 4 trefle i 10@h u W, wtedy mo¿na na niego przerzucic zatrzymanie kierowe|pg||
nt|lechcold: ciekawe co znaczy³o 3@D? pewnie jaki silny Stayman|pg||
nt|garden2005: waletem bez dziewi¹tki nie wistuje siê! :)|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ale na oko nie da siê szans po³¹czyc|pg||
nt|antoniz: po przebiciu kara,jest prosty przymus kierowo-treflowy przeciwko E|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: wist treflowy wygl¹da naturalnie na koñcówkê|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: nie ma przymusu, bo wyrzucasz jako pierwszy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lechcold: 1@C gumowy:) ale nasi tak graj¹ systemowo. Tak czy owak tylko drugi król trefl pod impasem robi grê. Inaczej le¿ymy|pg||
nt|garden2005: to ci sie Antku tak tylko wydaje|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@s cue, 3N = minimum hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  4@h no slam opposite minimum hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  East never showed the short @d|pg||
nt|oliverc: chance for 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|oliverc: but unlikely to take it|pg||
nt|barnets: both teams had opportunities to do better,|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jkotor: 2@d pewnie dowolne 11-13 w równym|pg||
nt|antoniz: s³usznie,masz racjê|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: na szlemika chyba jednak w atu|pg||
nt|lechcold: oby, oby|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: zreszt¹ Thomas najpierw musi do³o¿yc|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: a kartê ma tak¹ sobie|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: za wist w waleta trefl wieszaæ nie nada|pg||
nt|lechcold: on zawsze dok³ada|pg||
nt|garden2005: ale nie z ojcem, dlatego mysli czy siê op³aca|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: fakt, namys³ bardziej s³u¿y mu za czas na znalezienie argumentów za do³o¿eniem|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ¿eby siê obronic w dyskusji porozdaniowej|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: przed chwil¹ nie do³ozy³|pg||
nt|garden2005: do³ozy?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Might be 24-23 in favor of Suisse after this board...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Will need to get the  @d right, delicate play needed wrt entries|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: deep fantoni again thinking|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't think it is makeable with best defense. |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now it is if he finesses|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: flat 11 opening does well again    9 tricks in diamonds |pg||
pc|d2|nt|arderi:  We have a new leader in the match|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It will...|pg||
nt|roswolf: exuberant bidding by e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: the east hand is too flat for slam adventures|pg||
pc|dA|nt|400 volt: more than half of the tables reached a game by N/S, mostly 3NT|pg||
nt|400 volt: this seems to be the only match (at least in group a) where both teams didn't reach the game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes he did his duty with 4 @C|pg||
nt|skaftij:  ruff @s and @d 10|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Or @h to Ace and @d|pg||
nt|barnets: this should be down 2|pg||
nt|murat e: they are also critical only 2 vp in front of greece so actually 3 teams competing|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|tomi2: Israel bid 6@D on board 14, that will increase their lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: long think for rehder|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak to wygfra to powiêkszy nasz¹ dziurê bud¿etow¹ w strefie szlemowej w kontekcie historycznym|pg||
nt|lechcold: brawo Bal|pg||
nt|garden2005: czy po wicie @c4 wk³adamy dziewi¹tkê?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: raczej nie szkodzi spróbowaæ|pg||
nt|garden2005: dosta³em informacjê ¿e GIB mówi 12 lew|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ciekawe, bo gib pokazuje, ¿e idzie, wiêc co nam wyranie umknê³o w analizie|pg||
nt|garden2005: co to za sztuczka?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ja z GIBem nie rozmawiam...nawet nie podajê mu rêki:)P|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: actually withthe West hand i wouln't encourage much|pg||
nt|arderi:  Iceland played 1NT - 3 in both tables board 13|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but Jonsson just needs some help in @Cs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: has he found that out i wonder|pg||
nt|arderi:  After west opened I think Jonsson cant stay out of slam|pg||
nt|murat e: is this suggesting a stop|pg||
nt|arderi:  Im still guessing also 4@c was some kind of asking bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|murat e: finland takes the lead by the way|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hawe45:  Hard game - change the position of @C K - and you are the hero...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: spade lead stops 6@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  no that will not do|pg||
nt|skaftij:  now communication is established, so that will do|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wow. great comeback by the flying Finns|pg||
