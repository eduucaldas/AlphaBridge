mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 5@d on EW if W can find @cQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here since 1nt is usually based on clubs, it makes sense to use 2@C by south for majors|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on 30-vp scale   maximum win is 25 vp|pg||

mb|p|nt|andersk: I think Helgo has a case in that discussion|pg||
mb|4D|an| |nt|sharkey: Helgemo's 5@D really put the pressure on NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: always a challenge playing on 4-3|pg||
nt|tomi2: if double would not be something artifical (e.g. don't lead my suit), this hand looks fine for a double to invite partner to bid 4@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i have no idea how Smirnov found 5@H|pg||
nt|bernix: 4n is last makeable contract|pg||
nt|yke:  I don't, 1@D -p 1@S -p 1NT Dbl would be takeout for sure. Wh should this be different?|pg||
nt|bernix: trap pass lurking|pg||
nt|andersk: North have to underlead @H A to set 5 @C, or @H A and South unblock @H K to get a ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: declarer only have 4 certain tricks and needs to get 4 more, 1 can easily come from ruffing a @H|pg||
nt|tomi2: their doubles on seriously bid contracts are not 100% penalty. Piekareks would not double on 5 bad hearts and just three potential tricks|pg||

nt|tomi2: his play. That would be a great help here - it replaces "long" and "not long" by real facts, but it is probably a bit too expensive to have such cameras on each table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i didn't realize that also captured timing of  bid/play|pg||

nt|bernix: i play 1n-3@h as singleton with 5/4 in minors and 3 @ss. perfect on this hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: Karakolev has called TD...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Karakolev sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  not sure of the merits of playing 1NT-3@c as a weak hand with 54 in the minors|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: If S has @hA he will have 5@h, 3@s and 1@d trick|pg||
nt|bernix: so their system is to blame|pg||
nt|bernix: that they reach a making slam :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|arvidsson: I assume E showed a weak 6 card @H with minimum values|pg||
nt|arvidsson: W asked and deecided that he wanted to play 4@H|pg||
nt|tomi2: that seems very odd, first of all there must be some break in tempo to have ANY ruling|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: TD also informed NS that they have right to appeal decision...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: but meanwhile defense gets 3 diamonds, 1 club and a spade|pg||
nt|xenya: pretty high it seems...|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|arvidsson: N found a cood lead with @C|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|tomi2: of yourse you will find MANY other players who will not take Smirnovs risc to bid 5@H|pg||

nt|yke:  poland is 27-1 in front, so this will not be enough for bulgaria|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|arvidsson: (easiest would be for N to jump up with @D A and continue with @D) |pg||

nt|monde9: 2 imp's for Romania on this board|pg||
nt|monde9: as you saw 3 @H plus 2 in TOR |pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: south is squeezed here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: and very few who treat the hand the way Piekarek bid|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|tomi2: but it might have been totaly wrong and 5@D might have been 500 while 5@H was not making. He took the same shot as everybody who bid a grand on hand two missing the @CA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|arvidsson: as he did not S thought the lead was from a 2card suit and hoped to give his partner a ruff|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: out of his exit card in clubs|pg||

nt|bernix: imo the run for the bb places is decided|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: ok thx|pg||
nt|arvidsson: a good result for EW again (but as I said the @C lead was very good, many players might consider a @S lead and then 4@H makes easy|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: Thank you vasmar..|pg||

nt|vasmar: Declarer found @HQ after South's overcall|pg||
nt|monde9: 1 more point for Greece|pg||
nt|arvidsson: defence can not glitch since then this contract might make |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: currently 4 or 5 matches 21 to 9|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ther is 2@S tricks 1@D @H and 1@C +either an extra @S or @C trick to take for the defence |pg||
nt|arvidsson: the question is wther the will find it, declarer might have some guessing to do aswell (in @D and so on)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Rombaut thinking...|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile, Bulgaria gained 10 imps on 16, when they stopped short of slam in the OR|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|chick: this hand has all kinds of possibilities|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: indeed!|pg||
nt|chick: 5@S might actually make|pg||
nt|chick: 5@D needed a spade lead and club switch to set it|pg||
nt|xenya: looks laydown?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I understand the result of the head to head match between Italy and Netherlands would determine it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panosk: @H more likely|pg||
