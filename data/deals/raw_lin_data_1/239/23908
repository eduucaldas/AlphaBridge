nt|vugraphzgp: Good morning|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzgp: this not the correct bidding|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in Open room|pg||
nt|barnets: np|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: but contract is written 3@H on bocchis record|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if e-w are limited to 2@hs if the defense gets all its tricks.|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure you can even make 1@H its close|pg||
mb|d!|nt|desinka: now 2@S|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: hello everybody|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tez: merhaba:)|pg||
nt|desinka: Hi Momchil|pg||

nt|funtay: slm Yusuf|pg||
nt|yusufb: slmmm Tayfun|pg||
nt|psyck: exciting board to start|pg||
nt|baldjean: I doubt this Irish match will be as lopsided towards Ireland as their last one|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: merhabaa:) takýmýza bolþans|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|james_h: 1@h could be 11-13 bal or big both with 4+ support|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt ye gelince @d atak en iyisi..ama zor çýkmak|pg||
nt|yusufb: 13 maç oynuyoruz milli takýmýmýz italya ile 2ligi paylaþmakta|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, a little stronger opponents this time :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|star6ija: hello everybody|pg||
nt|star6ija: we have Bulgarian pair, playing precision here|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h e 2 sanzatuyu davet oynuyorlar..fit 4 lü|pg||
nt|ady: east has balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: hi all|pg||
nt|star6ija: sems like a good board for Bulgarians to start with|pg||
nt|star6ija: seems|pg||
mb|3N|nt|desinka: Hello, Barry:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: ilk 9 girmeyi garantiledik bundan sonra final grubuna cýkacak takýmlardan alýnacak puanlar onemli isvec maçý bu acýdan onemli|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: hi, Barry :)|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, Momchil.. seems like 1st blood to Bulgaria |pg||
nt|poohbear: The bidding is typical of modern stds. No one passes a 6 card major when their partner opens the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: request for link to running scores please|pg||
nt|tez: @h atak edebilir zorlu|pg||
nt|tez: yerde tek ya da þigan @h var..konuþmalardan biliniyor|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  NS play a 2/1 style with lots of gadgets and 12-14NT |pg||
nt|funtay: ataðýda batýrmasý da zor bir 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly not easy but I think 2 can be made.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|geot: Hi Jon, and kibs. Welcome.|pg||
nt|baardolav: hello all, Hei Geir and Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: at the other table N passed and E opened 1 @h:)|pg||
nt|geot: Some hand to start with for South|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi David|pg||
nt|ady: hi Martin|pg||
pc|sA|nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have judged well to defend  as 3@H  would almost certainly go down  and 3@D is down 1|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tez: iddialý atak ediyorlar..eðer en küçüðüyse|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|geot: Versace hot the diamond lead, and 5@D will quickly go one down|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barnets: may be able to beat 2@H now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|star6ija: yes...this way avoiding trump queen guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: N asking about Ws alternative bids|pg||
nt|psyck: @s would have been better for defense, but difficult with that holding|pg||
nt|baldjean: hard to find that lead. it might as well have given a trump trick away|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: 2@H made in OR so Bulgaria should gain 2 imps|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|santyclz: Yes, needed to avoid leading a @d from hand.|pg||
nt|ady: looks like defence should play trumps at every opportunity  even west give up a trump trick to stop any cross ruff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|yusufb: bcok iyi dondü nafiz abi|pg||
nt|funtay: asý girerse batar|pg||
nt|tez: en iyi defansý yaptý|pg||
nt|yusufb: batabilir|pg||
nt|tez: oynayanda @h uzun..@s i ele çekti valesi var..@c saðlamaya çalýþýyor..@c i de uzun|pg||
nt|funtay: öbür oda da yapmýþ bizimkiler|pg||
nt|tez: bil bakalým elinde ne kýsa:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: i was thinking they are doing fine with this neutral defense|pg||
pc|d4|nt|poohbear: Didnt see that North dbled the final contract. This is somethign that modern bidding has frowned upon|pg||
nt|barnets: down 1|pg||
nt|psyck: same contract other room|pg||
nt|baldjean: since S could easily hold AKJ in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: sure @s lead by W unlikely but @h to E & @s back was a possibility|pg||
nt|psyck: & another @s after @cA...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|star6ija: 690 is the most probable result here|pg||
nt|poohbear: No reason to dbl opps who voluntarily bid game. ESPECIALLY nv|pg||
nt|star6ija: right...|pg||
nt|poohbear: imp odds terrible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Back to -1 again...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|geot: Note that even on a spade lead there is no chance in this contract|pg||
mc|12|nt|poohbear: if they make 5 imps against. If they go down 1,  2 imps for . If they go down 2 then 5 imps|pg||
nt|desinka: why both tables starts from 1st board?|pg||

nt|tez: 3 ya da 4lü imiþ|pg||
nt|ady: well played    |pg||
nt|barnets: down 1 only in open|pg||
nt|ady: yes   down 1    3 imps for Norway|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 6 imps for Bulgaria for the dbl|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  the play would have been interesting|pg||
nt|geot: to take 2 down I mean|pg||
nt|santyclz: So 1st blood to Italy for going down 1 fewer trick.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yusufb: selammm herkese|pg||
nt|ady: so in fact 6 imps to Bulgaria   Hanlon played 10@S  in the end game  ttrying to give impresion of Q10 left I would think|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@d alsaydý oynayan entresan sekilde oluyordu @c lere nafiz abi kart tutamýyordu@h @s atamazdý @d atsada @d tahsil edilemiyordu|pg||
nt|tez: operator yanlýþ klikledi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing  a) 11-13 BAL  b) any 17+ HCP|pg||
mb|2H|nt|star6ija: and another Bulgarian pair in the OR, whose agressive style misleaded Swedes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  one overtrick in the OR for 1 imp to Monaco|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4H is very aggressive|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mihov has taken good decision in the OR|pg||
nt|desinka: this one looks like flat to me...|pg||
nt|james_h: tough position for NS here|pg||
nt|funtay: 12 ile açmadý Nafiz abi|pg||
nt|tez: 10 imp bize|pg||
nt|funtay: 4-4 major ile açardým, siz?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tez: diðer masada 3@d oynanýyordu bu el|pg||
nt|tez: @h ataðýna batacak burda|pg||
nt|yusufb: 4-3 e 4@s iyi kontrat ama bulmak zor|pg||
nt|tez: nafiz abi diyor ki @h asýyla al küçük @d yý oyna..batýr bakalým:)|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be a flat board probably in all matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I like Fantunes defence to Multi ... X shows @h|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   have 3NT   with their 28 hcp   not in the bidding yest|pg||
nt|james_h: it counters this situation here|pg||
nt|ady: there is a lucky lay to make 6@D    but will surely play an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: aah good, i don't need to look at their cc's anymore now that we have Al here :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|star6ija: as Shwartz did here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Can never tell with these big distribution hands|pg||
nt|tez: oynayanlar skoru görmüyor..masada oynuyorlar..yanlarýnda bilgisayar operatörü var..genelde isimleri kenan oluyor..onlar masada ne olduysa bize iletiyor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=8+, non-force  [obviously]|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: 2@d tek renkli major eli|pg||
nt|ady: south should certainly have taken some action first round|pg||
nt|james_h: Hanlon did well to recover|pg||
nt|ady: North has taken a gamble balancing at that level|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 top tricks playing their 5-5 fit in 3nt, but  it's not likely...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eamongall: hi ..eamon galligan here ..I reconstructed play on board 1 here .. fairly close ..bidding I made up also |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|star6ija: these 4 @h are little tricky|pg||
nt|jbgood: and at the other table a heart was lead - since E opened 1 @h|pg||
nt|geot: N/S got into the bidding now, and will possibly end in a spade partscore|pg||
nt|ady: e/w in trouble now if south re-doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: S asked about 3NT  and shrugged|pg||
nt|yusufb: bende kesin acardým 3 pozisyona gerek yok 1dende herkes acar nafiz abi ilk elin keyfini sürüyo olacak:)|pg||
nt|tez: operatör 2 battý yazýnca 2 battý demek deðil|pg||

nt|star6ija: as our friend from Pakistan Oosman Bashir pointed out...both Souths did also well not trying slam over 4th level overcall|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S  shows 4 hearts|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: and they play in the predictable 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually, i thought Hanlon would respond 1N  [8-11]|pg||
pc|sT|nt|baardolav: 2@s perfect for NS, should make... |pg||
nt|ady: west is aware of 4 spades with south    the 3@D response to puppet said no 5 card major  but promised at least 1 4 card major|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|geot: and Norway can't really complain about bad luck on board 1, because East's @H opening was on a 10 count with 10 to five hearts. He got punished hard.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|barnets: in the unlikely event e/w reach the 5 level South needs to unblock his @HK under the Ace later in hand to avoid endplay|pg||
pc|h9|nt|tez: el dikkatli oynamayý gerektiriyor|pg||

pc|s5|nt|andyv:  sorry, mistyped..1@h denied 4@h and has 4@s|pg||
nt|james_h: + 1 I expect|pg||
nt|ady: should make an overtrick end playing east|pg||

nt|arigun:  nerden bilecekki o zaman bir tek @sA atagina yaptiriyor olabilir|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next round robin  drops results from teams that do NOT advance|pg||
nt|barnets: so perhaps north passed as south could open light at this vul |pg||
nt|barnets: but still seems very conservative|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  at this vul, EW will stretch as much as possible to get to 4@h|pg||
nt|james_h: I think the double will weaken Easts case(assuming he has one) on the last hand|pg||
nt|james_h: 2@c is a Tx to @d|pg||
nt|ady: this can be defeated with a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|psyck: The matches played by qualified teams against each other are important as they are carried forward|pg||
nt|barnets: not to X|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: I appreciate Mihov's overcall in the OR|pg||

nt|barnets: east must allow wet to win the second heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C2 lead = attitude|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: this pass requires trump lead...otherwise declarer can prevail|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jbgood: so even transfer bids have their disadvantages - opps can cue in the suit transferred to:)|pg||
nt|geot: Declarer can finesse clubs to get rid of the diamond loser, so only four top losers in 3@H, but....|pg||

nt|nevaio   _: never|pg||
nt|barnets: the answer is not likely at all|pg||
nt|barnets: so east must duck|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps if dec had one less @D and 1 more club|pg||

mb|p|nt|baardolav: 10 trick was not right though|pg||
nt|baardolav: max 140|pg||
nt|jbgood: 10 tricks? No way - unless there was a revoke|pg||
nt|geot: Not 10, and N/S could have set declarer as the play went|pg||
nt|jbgood: revokes are not permitted on BBO:) (and therefore cannot be recorded)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: east|pg||

pc|d5|nt|poohbear: very aggressive bidding|pg||

nt|star6ija: some misbalanced auction|pg||
nt|star6ija: and the penalty will be as severe as possible|pg||
nt|star6ija: with both red suits broken unevenly|pg||
nt|poohbear: not much hope for this contract. Even with 3-3 @hs only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: but no guarantee that the other room goes plus. Cards dont lay well for EW|pg||
nt|yusufb: dolayýsýyla nafiz abi tokaydaki en az 3@s bildigi için 4@s dedi 3nt batardý|pg||

nt|jbgood: S should have made it easier by discarding a spade - agree|pg||
nt|barnets: now he is more relaxed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might be ok if both hands were known balanced, but with dummy holding long diamonds attacking lead needed|pg||

nt|fabsayc: diamond ace may disappear for defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: not clear what South should do. 4-4-4-1 with partner's suit your singleton is not a good recipe for NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fisher agrees|pg||
nt|james_h: We appreciate your at the table comments Dermot, keep up please|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the NT can be 5-3-3-2, 5-4-2-2 (but not in the majors) and 4-4-4-1 besides three run  of the mill 4-3-3-3 and 4-3-4-2|pg||

nt|star6ija: this one looks like a chance for Bulgarians to shorten the gap|pg||
nt|panosk: what do you think 3@C means?|pg||
nt|jbennet: he has passed initallly, showed both monors, and then all of u sudden a double comes.|pg||

nt|yusufb: @h 10 suit preferans olabilir @d için|pg||
pc|h4|nt|star6ija: another chance for Sweden here as far as 3 NT can be made|pg||
nt|geot: N/S in a quite standard 3NT here. Only eight top tricks from start, but nine already if he had tried the spade 8 in trick one|pg||
nt|geot: on a low spade lead which is pretty normal|pg||
nt|jbgood: some might even lead the 10|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: good idea if prd has 5 of them|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double dummy, you need to play 2round of club AK and 4 round of diamond and then a heart for input... |pg||
nt|geot: but declarer did not try the eight and is now looking for his ninth trick. |pg||
nt|geot: he can just set up a heart trick? Lose three hearts|pg||
nt|tez: @s  ataðýna hemen karar vermek zorunda kalacak|pg||
nt|tez: yerde rua vale varsa küçük çýkmak lazým deðil mi hocam?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: If 3@C still could be 5-5 S have a very good hand|pg||
nt|ady: declarer not running the club as wants to set up discards of spades on diamonds  before east can switchto a spade|pg||
nt|barnets: I am told as i suggested may happen england are playing 2@CXX|pg||
nt|ritong: en meme temps faut pas se gourer de majeure|pg||
nt|authau: Bonsoir, merci Henri pour votre confiance|pg||
pc|h5|nt|oleberg:  Five discards will take it toll on North|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: king may take the trick|pg||
nt|geot: may get problems getting to his hand to play more hearts and later collect the heart trick|pg||
nt|geot: Best defence would be (seeing all the cards) to win the ace and switch to a club|pg||
nt|baardolav: @h Ace and club give a big problem?|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: then 2 clubs, spade ace , three diamonds and then a club :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: (dd of course)|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive he need some sort of endplay if defence is correct|pg||
nt|ritong: affaire suivante|pg||

nt|barnets: good pass by south|pg||
nt|tez: seftesi burdan|pg||
pc|c4|nt|geot: If he goes down, which not at all is unlikely now, he will really regret not trying the spade 8 in the first trick.|pg||
nt|geot: Oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: chatting 0 the old rule of eleven|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this is the safest line to avoid a spade loser|pg||

nt|tez: @h vale vermesi iyi olmadý..ama defans zor deðil|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oleberg:  But if he keeps 3 diamonds, two hearts and two spades, it will be down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@dX was played in OR for -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  N opened 1@h and E was able to bid @s and then double @ds for further takeout.  W was only too happy to leave it in.|pg||
nt|geot: On a club switch from West instead of that 1H10, declarer can still win|pg||
nt|baardolav: everything solved... with a @c can win with ace, spade to ace and jack of @h|pg||

nt|barnets: in the closed room perhaps n/s were lucky to avoid a X|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but now the club king disappears, i knew somehow one or the other would|pg||

nt|barnets: at the 4 level|pg||
nt|santyclz: Is there any possibility this is a cue in support of @Ss?|pg||
nt|barnets: is this a natural bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: west made a clever move; 4 clubs then removing 4 sp should tell his p "I have a massive red-suiter and think that the 5 level is safe"|pg||
nt|barnets: why do I have this problem ?|pg||
nt|barnets: he thinks it should be obvious to his partner but I assure you it is not|pg||

nt|barnets: or he would have bid already|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: east has hands on head thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: east is wondering what is going on and probably should bid 6@D to cover all possiblities|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many are telling me (all for different reasons) that this "Can't" show @s support.  I agree, if you're looking at the w hand it's obvious it can't.|pg||
nt|barnets: you , I and west know that bit does east ?|pg||
nt|jbennet: so east have to work this out, but if he thinks that west is showing a red 2-suiter good enough to go to the 5 level. East just might raise to 6 d.|pg||

nt|geot: sorry, was asked about what is the best chance, ruff or the double squeeze|pg||
nt|rodvenn: apity not to have a penalty double any more|pg||
nt|arvidsson: will east pass on 2@S?|pg||
nt|yusufb: kritik bir 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: east discarded a diamond     seemed should really have broached clubs earlier|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east is in a very bad spiral|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: presumably this shows 4/5 @S/@H?|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  their version of Smolen|pg||
nt|jbgood: shouldnt Boye pass 2@c?|pg||
nt|geot: yes, right...so...well think in 7@S the best chance is to play for the diamond ruff also without a heart lead. But it is probably close|pg||
nt|baardolav: Yes... need a calculator...|pg||
nt|2celik1: iceride @C 2 li atagi ile batirildi 3nt board 8|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C looks like a michaels bid showing both majors    though north showed diamonds rather than spades|pg||
nt|psyck: The top 6 will then go to the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 6 COUNTRIES -- not necessarily the team that plays in Dublin|pg||

nt|star6ija: Karakolev has to lead ONLY @d|pg||
nt|star6ija: ...or trump|pg||
nt|barnets: two round hearts would promote trump trick so only 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: this may look like a Grosvenor Coup to declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on his own -- he only had one play in @S    here  defender gives him an option he woudn't have had|pg||

nt|jbennet: east now has two chances of going wrong , if he passes now he will be facing a nasty problem when the sledge comes back with an x from his p.|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think they are delayed because of a director call about the last board.  (They weren't slow enough before...)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: they are having an arguement about a revoke on the last hand....director has taken board away|pg||
nt|arigun:  belki ince bi yapari vardir 6@h un|pg||
nt|tez: 6@d 6@h 6 nt oluyor|pg||
nt|arigun:  @s atak gelemiyor gelirse isimize yarar|pg||
nt|ady: must of used transfer to spades in OR|pg||
mb|2H|nt|tez: ama @h rua atak edilecek ve olacak|pg||
nt|james_h: he also objects to major tournaments being played in the summer when he wants holidays|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: 3@C mixed raise in @D|pg||
nt|james_h: its tough when your a bridge professional|pg||
nt|arigun:  gelmezse yerin antresi gitmedigi icin ince bir squeeze olurmu acaba|pg||
nt|barnets: need @SJ to come sing or doubleton|pg||
nt|barnets: or tripleton|pg||
nt|psyck: they cannot find the 13th trick in bidding for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: @c cýkýlmasý imkansýz gibi naturel @h atagýda klasik hiç oynamazlar claim gelir:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: NS close to game in Hearts or NT. Depends on lead|pg||
nt|tez: 6@d olmuyor..o olmayýnca 6 nt de olmuyor|pg||
nt|arigun:  bu arada ezbere yorum yapayor olabilirim pardon|pg||
nt|ady: non promisary stayman works better on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: yes only spade|pg||
nt|jbennet: so far so good.|pg||
nt|barnets: the specs asking about ethical issues - there are none as west has a clear X|pg||
nt|barnets: what is 3N ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|yusufb: herkese merhaba|pg||
nt|jbennet: 2nd move. east might bid 4NT as a "pick a suit" |pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: live scores here http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|geot: This looks costly|pg||
nt|tez: 3@d demeyi düþünüyordu sanýrým..lauria..atak için|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT is preparing for weak raise|pg||
nt|barnets: I think east bid 5@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: Undo|pg||
nt|ady: but now e/w will be in with clubs|pg||
nt|authau: donc 3@s montre une main de manche (9+H) 5/4 en mineures avec un résidu de 3@h|pg||
nt|ritong: "pour ce qui est des @ss, j assure"|pg||
nt|ritong: "pour le reste, on verra plus tard"|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: but only @s is the suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: slight raise of eyebrow from McGann on seeing dummy|pg||
nt|ady: did not expect the Irish to miss this one|pg||
nt|barnets: not north|pg||
nt|tez: el görerek herkes yorum yapar ben iki elimle kapatýyorum ekraný:)|pg||
nt|yusufb: nt dogru tarafa aldýk|pg||
nt|arigun:  @d dagilimini gormeden masada cok rahat batilabilecek bir 6@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices from West|pg||
nt|geot: Normal overcall. Normal decision by North.|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks like|pg||
nt|arvidsson: as we can see all cards we see that EW will not make 4@H, but guess the whole field will play game on this hands|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yusufb: bugün kaç maç yapýldý bilen varmý sanýyorum 5 maç|pg||
nt|kbitzer: 6. cý el ilginç.  6 da  oluyor  4 de gitmekte  zor.  d.bakýr  zona bile gidemedi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if he had a way to differentiate 4@H as guess vs  "it's our hand - this will make"|pg||
nt|tez: Diðer odada 7. board 1@h 2@d    2@h 3@d    3NT  4@d       4 NT  6 NT  South oynuyor|pg||
pc|s3|nt|star6ija: 6@h will go down with @s lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: small??|pg||
nt|geot: But not all will re-open with a double as South on that hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: ok play gone ahead at this stage|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: boye is on lead and NS have 3 tricks|pg||
nt|tez: @c ataðýna 6 oluyor|pg||
nt|2celik1: iceride 5@C dendi,tam|pg||
nt|poohbear: kind of like Lebensohl|pg||
nt|ritong: entame rassurante|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: 3N is best here of course as the cards lie -- 4@S is a bit trickier...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Lots of thinking at this table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who knows :(|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sengulerz: 2 imp olsun bizim olsun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would ask about 4@D too|pg||
pc|c9|nt|poohbear: Ahhhh another way to beat 4 . kill the entry to the @d|pg||
nt|barnets: lucky for e/w no X|pg||
nt|jbennet: it was reasonable to remove 4 sp x, but 4NT as a "pick a suit" would involve p in the process. |pg||
nt|barnets: but swing earned by east for Italy in open by opening 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: a better bid in my opinion|pg||
nt|arigun:  love yok yanlismi sayiyorum yani dekleran el tutunca 6@d+5@h+@sA dusunmezmi|pg||
nt|arigun:  kabak oluyor diyemlere sordum|pg||
nt|ritong: pour le reste, on assure aussi|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzgp: one round of hearts have been played so far|pg||
nt|jbgood: so maybe Norway will get off the schneid now|pg||
nt|geot: N/S can win 6@D on this hand, but only double dummy. Has to drop the @DK|pg||
nt|geot: Madala did not re-open with a double at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: second trick won by EW so logic tells me a diamond queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: from there on it is quessswork sorry|pg||
nt|jbgood: just wait for the final result and give us that, Tos|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: 10 diamond lead from south on 5th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: club discarded West and east|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: west and north|pg||
nt|geot: N/S still bidding this hand in the OR, on their way to a possible slam that normally will fail. But they are lacking 2 Key Cards in a diamond contract, so I suspect 5@D will be the ...|pg||
nt|geot: contract.|pg||
nt|jbennet: 5h can even be set -3. |pg||
nt|barnets: Italy now in fron by 4|pg||
nt|barnets: south could have risked a x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and even 4N  -  is that RKC or Turbo|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe asks for @CQ |pg||
nt|barnets: if asking about clubs south will bid 7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|star6ija: actually it would have been more interesting to see wheter Aronov would have found the lead against 3 N played by South|pg||
nt|tez: 6@h e gelince as ve rua kozu çek..@d çak..kozla yere..@d larý çek..yetmediyse @c ruayý uçur|pg||
nt|ady: still n/s will get around 2 imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is non promissary stayman like "the cheque is in the mail"|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|geot: there they stopped in 5@D, will make 600 or 620|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  J@s played hoping to give declarer the illusion a bad split|pg||
nt|jbgood: well done to take the 800|pg||
nt|geot: Norway's first IMPs in this match will come here, 5 of them|pg||
nt|tez: açýk kart analiz benimki..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Turbo is a convention where 4N bidder shows a particular number of keycards rather than asking|pg||
nt|barnets: choice of contracts|pg||
nt|barnets: either spades or Nt|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panosk: if you go a 20 hcp game and 5 are useless its not gd news, but i also think many will venture 4@H|pg||
nt|rodvenn: yes hard to stop, but west may see that his 2 queens do not carry much weight|pg||
nt|arvidsson: normally when you realise your hand is not as good as you thought it is to late :)|pg||
nt|tez: zaten 6@d ya gelince |pg||
nt|arigun:  siz olsaniz mesela @s atatgina 6@h u bu @d kesikdri diye mi oynarsiniz yoksa ben su kozlari cekeyim ardindan @d lari saydiririm diye mi dusunursunuz|pg||

nt|xenya: what about @S8?|pg||
nt|andyv:  as you noticed, I didn't say anything about the 8 because the less said the better|pg||
nt|2celik1: kesinlikle Zafer Hocam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done   look for the translation of bids in the daily bulletin???|pg||
nt|barnets: if east was 4-3-4-2 with @HK and 4 spades could still make|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Comfort break|pg||
nt|barnets: @SJXXX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told  7@S push in Monaco-Croatia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Open Room just starting to bid the hand now|pg||

nt|baldjean: Yes, but does he have the Q too?|pg||

nt|santyclz: As with many relatively new conventions, there are many variations so it's important to discuss exact sequences.  Saying "Gazilli" isn't enough.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: eamongall here for a few boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room still not done bidding the slam hand -- but they're getting close|pg||
nt|barnets: but without the @DA he would almost certainly have the @SA or K|pg||
nt|barnets: to have his 3@S bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they do bid 7@S in other room|pg||
nt|ritong: cette affaire la pourrait bien se solder a 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Good contract, game on few HCPs and nice fit, but you can not expect to win such a board in an international championship, and especially playing against Italy|pg||
nt|arvidsson: lookes strange, might be some operating glitch?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south got what he deserved for opening 3@S with bad suit and defense|pg||
nt|psyck: so it reamins a fairly low scoring match so far|pg||
nt|ritong: plus maintenant|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: asým var ya daha yusufum:)|pg||

nt|barnets: south bid 6@D in other room|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe 5N would work better|pg||
nt|barnets: then over 6@C|pg||
nt|barnets: south could bid 6@D|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C   natural|pg||
nt|authau: :( un coup de 10 quand les Suédois gagnent 5@c à la 9 en salle ouverte|pg||

nt|barnets: giving north some choice|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tez: 3@c oynanýr bu|pg||
nt|ady: last hand a continuation of a 2nd trump  might have been down 2    but Hanlon can bring in the spades so defence cant risk that|pg||
nt|tez: ortak keser sorduðunda sizde QX varken ne diyorsunuz?|pg||
nt|remo: grande 5nt!|pg||
nt|psyck: upgrade for that @d suit i guess , but the side cards are not so great|pg||

nt|yusufb: @h Q koyarsa batar|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in europe many pairs use 2@C natural and 2@D for majors, that may have had something to do with the first norwegian disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so  -4 rather than -2|pg||
nt|tez: 6@d da sorun yok|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2D showed 5 @ds and 8+ points|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok then I guess W raised with a @S H or S finessed with T of @S|pg||
nt|barnets: needs a spade lead or switch to beat it|pg||

nt|barnets: for spade switch|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Brink-Drijver will play this hand in 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we see that perfect defense defeats 3N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if defense does NOT take first 5 -- then declarer takes first 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver did rebid 3N with east hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: if partner was unpassed and unlimited East would bid 2NT and give partner room to describe|pg||
nt|panosk: this might get expensive|pg||
nt|ritong: soit le @sR, soit l as de @h|pg||
nt|ritong: bien mis|pg||

nt|yusufb: rakip 1nt dedikten sonra 3nt ye ulaþmak ve yapmak cok nadir olan bi durum|pg||
nt|arvidsson: a very good double by E and this might be whats needed for norway to get back in the lead |pg||

nt|yusufb: bravo salvo|pg||
nt|arigun:  @h de dogru oyun 8'e dogru oynamak ama yanlis yapar dam koyarsa ve pisman olursa @d da yuksek ihtimal cift pass (masada kaybettiriyor)|pg||

nt|ady: south cant be blamed for entering |pg||

mb|4C|nt|yusufb: zpas pas makul|pg||

nt|psyck: lucky @dJ single|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and the match is tied|pg||
nt|tez: @h dam al @s oyna|pg||
nt|poohbear: If he plays AK of @s then he might lose to 4-1 spades. |pg||
nt|barnets: south won the points here by bidding 3@H and tking away a constructive move from west|pg||
nt|jbennet: will he make it?|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 sp+|pg||
nt|santyclz: While any team could win any match, you're not going to get rich betting against Italy...|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room south passed 1@S|pg||

mb|4D|nt|jbgood: Norwegian ladies way ahead against Germany! (without Auken - von Arnim on the team though)  |pg||

nt|james_h: unfortunately there is no minor suit squeeze as north has to discard before east|pg||
nt|ady: now looking further     5@C seems ok    but 6 should fail    although only 1 top loser|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 6 will make actually|pg||
nt|ady: might make 12 tricks in clubs as A@D   comes down in 3   so can play diamond to king   and ruff the ace out   also ruff finesse k@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: their 1@D usually 12-14 when balanced|pg||

nt|andyv:  as to prior board, EW do play 2@c puppet|pg||
nt|yusufb: x majorler yada 1 minor overcalu|pg||
nt|barnets: that was 12 imps to Israel when dec finesed hearts in open|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm.  Weak 2?|pg||
nt|barnets: It is not clear to me if the def could beat it the way he played it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H limited to 16 HCP, so some safety for Hanlon|pg||
nt|psyck: they must have overextended themselfs in a must win final match|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, they was no defense once declarer read the cards on that deal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hungary just picked up 11   but still 8.5 VP behind 9th place Norway|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y less impossible but brilliant line 4@S interesting to see how many will make 4@S b11|pg||
nt|barnets: he played the hand as if could see all the cards !|pg||
nt|authau: Il y aura 6 qualifiés pour la suite|pg||
mb|1S|nt|geot: Can not see any way 4@S making on 14, so that should be a 6 IMP pick up for Norway|pg||
nt|arigun:  nigde'de bu eli 6 oynamayani istasyon'a kadar kovalarlar valla :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yusufb: oynuyor olabilirler salvo oynuyor biliyorumda|pg||

nt|panosk: ah to be young and hopefull :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: :)|pg||
nt|ady: this hand can relax   4 hearts + 1  should be flat|pg||

nt|tez: senyörler|pg||
nt|jbennet: i wonder whether 2 d was a bid to show 4sp+longer minor?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in 3rd/4th seat -- can have longer @C but not longer @H or @S in 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C can be 5-4 either way|pg||

mb|p|nt|yusufb: bencede|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4-3-3-3 still not slam force|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 3@S is by the look of it a minimum hand|pg||
nt|funtay: 6@s için @si dogru yerden çekmeli|pg||
nt|tez: þleme gelmek kolay yapmak zor|pg||
nt|barnets: nothing e/w can do now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Others are saying it's even more specific, 4@s and 5@d.|pg||
nt|barnets: to have a chance  2@S they had to lead a @D and dec woud need to win the A and fin hearts to make it|pg||
nt|jbennet: board 12 both players had to decide what to do after 5 cl and x from p.|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 1@s 3-4 @s's might only show 4, havent stydied their system, 1NT telling that he only have 4@s's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Naber opened north hand  1N = 10.5-13|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he's playing 2N|pg||
