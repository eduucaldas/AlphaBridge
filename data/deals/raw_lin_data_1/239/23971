mb|1H|nt|james_h: Welcome All|pg||
nt|mcphee: decent slam on the way|pg||
nt|clinch: Looking at this board, NS will probably bid to 3NT, but the duplication in spades will make that an uphill struggle.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hi - looks like a quiet 450/420 for the start|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, top9 teams advance to the second RR, and these teams are currently 7th and 8th, so a big loss may cause either to drop out|pg||

nt|barnets: how will Italy do with 1 Italian pair playing for them?|pg||
nt|geot: yes:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 1@h shows @h and a longer suit|pg||

nt|james_h: e/w ignoring and bidding natural|pg||
nt|james_h: .... maybe :)|pg||
nt|james_h: 1@d is 2+, 3@d still shows the Majora for E/W|pg||
nt|james_h: Majors|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the screen, bids are entered by the operator after both on one side have bid|pg||
nt|james_h: might make|pg||
nt|gulyas: S and W are on the same side|pg||
nt|gulyas: this lead certainly helps|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he lets it run|pg||
nt|james_h: East unlikely to have 5 @s|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@c is obviously forcing|pg||
nt|baldjean: S is probably pondering whether to bid 4@h or 4@s. I would choose 4@h|pg||
mb|d|nt|baardolav: good morning all|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North's 4@D usually implies some sort of spade fit|pg||
nt|barnets: and the defense are helpless|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: Sorry everyone for the delay. We are halfway through board 2. Return to normal service at board 3|pg||

nt|geot: Here it depends on what agreements you have over Precision 1@D opening|pg||
nt|geot: West has a very strong hand opposite the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|barnets: here a diamond lead will set 6@S north getting a ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: a club lead works also as dec cant disc his loser in time|pg||
nt|barnets: north will ruff|pg||
nt|baldjean: this time a @h slam for E/W|pg||
nt|sastro: teures falsches Rückspiel - kann man vielleicht auch sehen. Worauf hat Partner kontriert nachdem er auf 2 @d gepasst hat|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: Bocchi is in 4@h on board 1. 1 off on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|oleberg:  1@H = spades or various balanced hands|pg||
nt|oleberg:  1@S = relay|pg||

nt|james_h: routine stuff on this hand|pg||
nt|geot: Some Lebensohl thing here? West will probably make a slam try|pg||
nt|roswolf: i believe 2@c is gf|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 1 the english played in 3nt losing an imp|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: hi|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4@S will be too expensive without entries to W hand|pg||
nt|solex333: easy 4 @s|pg||
nt|jbennet: 6 clubs slightly odds-against after the spade overcall. |pg||
nt|geot: yes, bad diamond break|pg||
nt|geot: makes it hard|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but with non spade lead d 4-2 is enough.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|venedik: selamlar|pg||
nt|ken__: Birben 5@c derse durumu kurtarabilirler|pg||
nt|geot: Normal to get to 4@S here|pg||

nt|begse: gruptan çýkmamýz kesinleþti sadece ilk 9 a giren takýmlardan aldýgýmýz neticeler taþýnýyor|pg||
nt|yusufb: artýk bundan sonra finale cýkacak diger 8 takýmdan yuksek puan almaya bakacaz cunki o puanlar taþýnacak|pg||
nt|MolvaM: aslý hedef olan ilk 6 ya girilmesi açýsýndan bu maç önemli|pg||
nt|baardolav: will madala make balancing double? ns make 3@d|pg||
nt|geot: I think Duboin has made a slam try now, and East will pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hope south knows that is exclusion blackwood|pg||
mb|d|nt|clinch: I'm asked which Bessis is in each seat - operator?|pg||
nt|barnets: well judged|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mcphee: lost the @S fit with the @D pre-empt|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Fredin will start with the 9 easy tricks and get another in the end|pg||
nt|MolvaM: çünkü almanya da muhtemelen finale kalacak|pg||
nt|begse: bu yüzden bu maçlar çok önemli iyi taþýma ile son 9 a girersek avantaj yakalýyoruz|pg||
nt|begse: þu anda ciddi bir 9 culuk yarýþý var bizim için en iyisi latvianýn çýkmasý|pg||
nt|geot: but Bocchi has not exactly for a overcall at the two-level anyway (?). Would have been easier lets say over a 1@C (+2) opening|pg||
nt|geot: to overcall 1@D|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@H = 8-11, and any 5-3-3-2 or side-suit in hearts|pg||
nt|jbennet: however against spade lead 6 clubs requires either D 3-3 or D 4-2 + 10x in clubs somewhere. |pg||
nt|baldjean: S has a perfect yarborough|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@C great contract tough to bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: west's double doesn't look very standard to me|pg||
nt|geot: sure|pg||
nt|geot: but Helness will at least bid now|pg||
nt|fluffy: do they play that ELC thing?, or just allow for a bit offshape?|pg||
nt|barnets: x is fine can bid diamonds over clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: modern style|pg||
nt|chick: I have no idea what 2@C means here, must be some special agreement|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wijs-muller play Tarzan Precision  but they open fewer hands at 1-level than most big clubbers|pg||
nt|pauleger: defending 3@c X you have to switch to a trump early|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@S = relay|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2NT = Any 5-3-3-2|pg||
mb|2N|nt|james_h: This match is likely to count as both teams likely to qualify for the 2nd week of action|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu arada yuksek skor aldýgýmýz takýmlarýn ilk 9 girmesini istiyoruz tabii|pg||
nt|tomi2: am anderen Tisch fand man das Trumpfnachspiel (ohne Rekontra) warf auf Nord jedoch ein Karo ab, was 4@S erfüllen lies|pg||
nt|chick: EW have 9 tricks right away with the diamond finesse working|pg||
nt|murat e: probably transfer sequence continue.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: 3NT would maybe better this time|pg||
nt|james_h: y|pg||
nt|geot: same contract at the other table|pg||
nt|james_h: prob both -1, lets see|pg||
nt|geot: Hard to win this one, have to solve both the clubs and the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: NS tell me the names are in wrong - Berg playing South, Svendsen North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most other rooms NS playing 2@S|pg||
nt|psyck: dec could make his low trump last deal to survive the trump split|pg||
nt|pauleger: presumably 8 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|tomi2: Piekarek did so|pg||
nt|clinch: I don't know myself|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3@C = Where is the doubleton?|pg||
nt|barnets: 6 is not realy a great contract with no spade entries to east|pg||
nt|barnets: so even had the diamonds split dec|pg||
nt|barnets: has a lot of work to do|pg||
mb|3N|nt|8252:  the daddy is the less agressive :)|pg||
nt|baldjean: E will probably not continue after this 4@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: nicely done that will settle any english nerves|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: iyi akþamlar:)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3@H = Diamonds|pg||
nt|oleberg:  If he cannot use a red doubleton for anything, he probably shouldnt have asked :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards lie quite well for EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: they should be looking at BBO right now Martin :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: they need good 12 to 15 to open balanced hands|pg||
nt|yusufb: mesela latvia 24 aldýk þu anda 10-11 durumdalar beklentimiz ilk 9 girmeleri|pg||
nt|riccho:  seems like khokhlov from the other table misplayed the hand. He should have played the 2nd round of hearts from dummy and only after that go to the hand to play a 3rd round of hearts|pg||
nt|riccho:  1st trick here is somewhat strange. looks quite natural to put in the king here|pg||
nt|barnets: good stop|pg||
nt|baldjean: well, commentator's curse. nolw they may find the slam|pg||

nt|star6ija: yes...but the position is dangerous for both Italians...Bocchi's suit is not solid enough and Madala's hand is not the best option for balancing with partner not overcalled|pg||

nt|gulyas: now he has the 10th, a probable push|pg||
pc|dK|nt|geot: Will make nine tricks here as well for a push|pg||
nt|riccho:  declarer may ruff two small clubs in dummy anyway, but he has his 2nd trick in @c from scratch|pg||

nt|star6ija: yes with clubs 3-3 and 5th @h easy to be established (E have all the entrien necessary)|pg||

nt|star6ija: @h ruff should be started immediately for the 12th trick|pg||

nt|baardolav: Aronov look for 11 tricks... and maybe he just play two round of clubs, and then make crossruffes.|pg||
nt|star6ija: but what I think is that Victor will waste a little bit more time to find sure way for taking 11 tricks|pg||

nt|fabsayc: if willard had the diamond king and golin the queen, golin should have overtaken heart queen, so i am pretty sure oliveri should know to underlead diamond ace|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4-1 @S just enough to stop 13 tricks for N/S|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: a pleasure to be with you watching one of my favourite pairs|pg||

nt|dburn: not sure what 3@c meant, or even what 3NT meant|pg||

nt|roswolf: i did mean NOT worked out well - honest:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 3N not alerted|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@c may just be a sound diamond raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: he will be endplayed eventually (and we also know the 4th @S will be good, so no need for the @HA)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decent explanation of the leads on their submitted convention card|pg||

nt|MolvaM: seyirciler kör as ataða raðmen oluyor diyor. evet @h9 düþüyor|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|clinch: Presumably a Michaels style overcall here, with S making a pass or correct response|pg||
nt|geot: 1@C = 2+ clubs |pg||
nt|barnets: sorry the 3-1 trump split spoiled the 100 percent line|pg||
nt|jbennet: again agresive on low levels ahd gained the pot.  |pg||

nt|fabsayc: so in reality madala should have come down to singleton heart keeping extra spade|pg||
nt|barnets: as he became short an entry to south hand|pg||
nt|barnets: not what east wanted to hear|pg||
nt|geot: H/H playing strong NT also in balancing position|pg||
nt|fluffy: some players would bid with Lauria's cards I think, I think I wouldn't|pg||
nt|dburn: or a fit-showing effort, but if that is so 3NT is not easy to understand - though Versace may be hoping for @cAK with East and 4-4 hearts|pg||

pc|h8|nt|clinch: Good lead, but still 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: S showed his @Ds, and N decided 3nt will be just fine|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S wanted to find out abt @Hs, he could have started with 2nt, so no need to bid 3@H now|pg||

nt|gulyas: if he did, declarer can win the @H and put him in with @Ss - its a matter of figuring out the distributions really|pg||
nt|geot: Better trump suit in 4@S, but maybe not an easier contract?|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks easier now|pg||
nt|geot: should win it even though trumps are 4-1 and the diamond Q can not be cashed|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, bd3, 3@S ended up down 4 in the OR, 10imps to IRL, leading by 13|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice lead|pg||
nt|james_h: pop the ace and play @d|pg||
nt|gulyas: this may beat the contract, unless EW block the @C suit|pg||
nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, but still, 2@Cs and 2@Hs to give, and a @D|pg||
nt|james_h: then EW know the @s Q is an entry and def is easy|pg||
nt|james_h: so declarer must be more cunning|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you play a low @D, they may not know|pg||
nt|james_h: looking at the N/S hands its still a good games ...|pg||
nt|james_h: if the @d 3-2 and the Q with East|pg||
nt|james_h: or if the @h ace with West|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sastro: ich wollte grade schreiben, dass das eine Hand ist , wo der gesammte Raum 4 @H +1 spielt- und so irrt man|pg||

nt|fabsayc: so 4 should make|pg||
nt|mathat: ?|pg||
nt|solex333: han 3nt - which actually makes...|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Good call by west. 5@C is a much better contract, even though 3NT is a winner here|pg||
nt|solex333: better than 3nt...|pg||
nt|barnets: reached slam in other room|pg||
pc|c6|nt|barnets: not much hope here for south|pg||

nt|fabsayc: if QJ95x you could lose to K10 onside after a cover by finessing on the way back|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: on 3 the english e/w bid to 5@D -2 a nice reward for the italian auction here|pg||

nt|baardolav: Aronov|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there was no need to play diamonds first since you basically need clubs to break and heart king onside to have any chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this line has complicated matter, she is aiming to pitch a club on diamond jack, but to gain a trick that way she needs four spade ruffs in hand|pg||

nt|baardolav: 3nt can be made with a misdefence here|pg||
nt|geot: Italy might bid game. North has only 15HCPs but the fifth diamond is good so he may accept an invite.|pg||
nt|star6ija: leading from some of his long suits East will be immediately thrown in with @d Jack...now he has to find @s switch|pg||

nt|star6ija: yes...and if declarer plays Jack and @d to 9...East must be as fast as a shark switching in @s|pg||
nt|riccho:  advantage is that you have the possibility to bid with the weak AND the strong hands at the same time. |pg||
nt|barnets: a low diamond lead|pg||
nt|barnets: will give dec a 9th trick in nt|pg||
pc|h7|nt|geot: Hm.......|pg||

nt|gulyas: on very little values|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I like that meaning of the 2@s bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the range applies to all opening 2-bids  that is why 1N is their 12-14 catchall that includes some odd shapes  [4441, 5422 not @H & @S, etc]|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Muller thinking again|pg||

nt|james_h: Holy High cards Batman|pg||
nt|tez: 5 ÝMP|pg||
nt|mdgraham: spade lead to the ace and a spade back - hard to play the K. Doesn't matter here, though, with clubs 4-1|pg||
nt|geot: I agree. But I would imagine Duboin also knows what he is doing. He has proved so over the years:)|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N is very lucky|pg||
nt|geot: so on this one 3NT will make because the hearts are 4-4|pg||
nt|murat e: Arnolds underbid this one she has too much as a passed hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|geot: South is now making them play 4@S|pg||
nt|geot: If declarer plays the diamonds from top it will be West who gets  and he should find the spade switch|pg||
nt|barnets: both 4@S and 5@C would make but @D is down|pg||
nt|geot: note that 5@D will go down|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D|pg||
nt|sastro: @s 7 sieht eher nach @C aus als nach @d|pg||
nt|dburn: which isn't so bad - 3-3 spades or @dKQ onside|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzeq: onor varsa göm yoksa pas de , demekmiþ|pg||
nt|ken__: :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW makes 4 @H but would East have bid again over 2@H??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with no competition east's 3@D would be forcing, here the alert was probably that bid is not forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on last board west in open room doubled 2@C and then rebid 2nt only|pg||
nt|nilsland:  maybe 2NT was for minors even?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this hand in open room north passed and ew are playing 2@H|pg||
nt|clinch: 2@c may have been artificial (it usually is these days), though seems not alerted|pg||
nt|clinch: 3@c then being invitational|pg||
nt|mdgraham: time to look at opps CC - what do they lead with Hxx/xxx in partner's suit.....|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|barnets: only a low @D lead gives contract|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well, it "just" requires the lead of a small diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: after all, East did open the bidding and West has a decent 19 points|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lechcold: 4@H w  3 mo¿na by³o chyba wygraæ po ataku @SA|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Fredin made a balancing bid in advance - which was wrong this time|pg||
nt|baldjean: well, N should know about @c switch now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|james_h: When U have the machinery, U got to let the neighbours see it |pg||
nt|geot: I think a lot of players will raise 2NT to 3 on that South hand|pg||
nt|clinch: This won't be difficult to make|pg||
nt|baardolav: for spade |pg||
nt|barnets: and who can really blame south ?|pg||

nt|geot: I am sure Mc Gann does, I am suprised Berg does not|pg||
nt|james_h: East must have seen West lead directing Dbls on previous oceasions|pg||
nt|geot: What I think is that South was aiming for a 5-4 fit in spades, or else 3NT, but then the double of 3@C came|pg||
nt|geot: and he changed his mind and tried for a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see if they find the lead to beat it (as they should, pd must have short @Ds for running)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think much of a stretch to double here|pg||
nt|dburn: well done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as they do so often|pg||

nt|barnets: ever|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Probably West thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: As the lay-out is N/S can not hurt declarer much in the spade suit|pg||
nt|baardolav: true... and the natural heart lead, give declarer an easy way for 9 tricks|pg||

nt|oleberg:  Double-dummy this can make, by playing two rounds of clubs, and then a spade to the ace|pg||
nt|geot: GF sequence|pg||
nt|geot: by West, and an ok final contract|pg||
nt|jbennet: a bit tricky on spade lead. |pg||
nt|barnets: this contract is fine|pg||
nt|geot: right opponent has the diamond ace, the one with three hearts|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@S verspricht eine unausgeglichene Hand, Nord weiß also von dem Treff Fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: after the overcall oliveri might have tried 2@S rather than 2NT, assuming that asks for help in spades|pg||
nt|clinch: with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|james_h: agreed|pg||
nt|barnets: not best lead |pg||
nt|geot: the clubs are splitting badly|pg||
nt|barnets: with north ducking 2 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: There is a lesson on that last hand for pundits like me ...|pg||
nt|james_h: never count your chickens (or imps) before they hatch|pg||

pc|sA|nt|geot: I am sure we will see more exciting matches, and to be fair, this match has just started as well:)|pg||
nt|geot: I mean, what can the players do with these boards|pg||
nt|gulyas: N encouraged in @H, so S may continue @Hs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this contract is off the radar |pg||
nt|geot: but the diamond lead was fine for declarer. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|tez: @h çaka verecek|pg||
nt|tez: @h oynrsa þimdi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Oliveri may have missed the 1s overcall|pg||
nt|fabsayc: blame seems to be with golin, whatever 3@D meant it looks wrong|pg||
nt|baardolav: there is no way for Aronov bid 2nt on ten? |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gulyas: then declarer can duck and test the suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bye Bob|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Fantoni thinking this time, not Muller |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: screen down briefly, F asks M a question|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe Muller's PASS was a RELAY  but Nunes 3@C ended the artificial bidding|pg||
nt|clinch: Can actually make 6 by ducking a @h to S, but unlikely with the whole @d suit exposed|pg||
nt|baardolav: instead of 2d|pg||
nt|geot: his partner is limited to 15|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes i knoww|pg||
nt|geot: I guess 2NT was an option to try reaching a vul game, but...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Yes, you end up in 2NT on 11+10 hp too|pg||
nt|geot: South did not have a real good lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: 3@h would have shown 4 or 5 @h, 3@s would have shown 5@s, & 3N both majors|pg||

nt|mdgraham: on the last hand - if the defence ducks the first club, it may get tricky|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may be able to endplay dummy to concede heart tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S much better|pg||
nt|barnets: well a spade would have worked better|pg||
pc|d6|nt|oleberg:  Here West has the safe exit of a club|pg||
nt|tomi2: Joerg hat 8 Punkte in Partners Kürze|pg||

pc|c5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seyircilerimiz bu tür teknik ve püf noktasý bilgiler vermenizden memnun oluyorlar teþekkürler|pg||
nt|chick: 3N is the far better contract anyway.  9 tricks on any lead as long as diamonds break no worse than 3-1|pg||
mc|9|nt|pauleger: should S have taken the 1st @s, to play a @h up and then a @d? propably E will rise thinking S could have stiff @s A?|pg||
nt|geot: Lauria - Versace (in the OR) has not missed much so far in this set, but I think Bulgaria has got a chance on the next board|pg||
nt|baardolav: In 2@d they will end up with minus one now|pg||
nt|baardolav: need to ruff with K|pg||

nt|star6ija: about 10-15 years ago, returning from one European Championships, Ivan Nanev, one of the topBulgarian international players shared with me the following|pg||
nt|fluffy: hi all|pg||
nt|star6ija: Italian style is not to play scores with 24-25 points|pg||
nt|star6ija: they never compare +150 with -600 and +480 with -980|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And a club-switch instead ogf the diamond would have tangled declarers communication|pg||
nt|monde9: W helped with the @H second time|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Quite a bad defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 4@s x /1 is correct|pg||
nt|mcphee: might have been better to run more @C there|pg||
nt|gulyas: so back to 9 tricks, playing it safe|pg||

nt|geot: East in OR, Brogeland, went from playing 1@H on board 6 to playing 1@S on this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4441 is systemically opened 1N when 12-14|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea has a good fame as dec in Romania|pg||
nt|monde9: I think the 6th board can bring another points to Romania|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not that he did anything wrong at all, but there was only the straightforward way to play it|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It was EW who "made" the contract|pg||
nt|barnets: west bid 3@C and north tried 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: after 5 boards poland lead finland 25 5 |pg||

nt|geot: if South gets two heart ruffs|pg||
nt|mcphee: may have been worried about @S 5/3|pg||

nt|baldjean: N did certainly not take the best line. 1 round of trumps was ok, but then he needed to try to play up a side suit|pg||

nt|gulyas: his major honors are really too soft, so this is enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N is the catchall that doesn't fit  1-suit [usually 14+ HCP] or 2-suit [10-13, 5+ suit, unbal]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: whereas 6d is dependent on spade favourable since played by north|pg||

nt|geot: 4@S played by West at the other table|pg||
nt|star6ija: as we are 12 behind I am jealoused for every IMP Italians won|pg||
nt|geot: but he must guess the hearts if he gets the clubs established, which he will|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Muller will show control in @C but not @D  [don't quote me]|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Wijs writing lots of explanations for Nunes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs may have enough information now to try 7@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: knows @HA @CK  and 2326 distribution|pg||
nt|geot: 11 tops tricks|pg||
nt|geot: now four heart tricks|pg||
nt|geot: has to guess whether to take the heart finesse or the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: how does h finesse help|pg||
nt|jbennet: so east can (a) win in dummy spade king and play clubs (that requires 3-3 spade break.)|pg||
nt|barnets: he is blocked from his long clubs|pg||
nt|geot: not much communications between the hands here|pg||
nt|geot: if they duck the first club|pg||
nt|jbennet: or b) win in hand, but more less requires d 3-3 + queen onside. |pg||
nt|jbennet: so sp 3-3 looks like the best chance.|pg||
nt|geot: What if he takes the first heart, finesses the heart 9, cash the two last hearts and the spade king and play a club|pg||
nt|geot: I mean if North plays the jack|pg||
nt|geot: and he should not?|pg||
nt|geot: everything blocked|pg||
nt|jbennet: hseems like best play is to win in dummy  and then immdiately play a club to the king (hpoing that south will win).|pg||
nt|geot: if North plays low in hearts (or the 7)|pg||
nt|barnets: def just duck a club|pg||
nt|barnets: that does not work|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: WHOOPS THEY DIDNT CASH THE SPADE|pg||
nt|dburn: no matter|pg||
nt|dburn: if South pitches a spade East plays a fourth diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: which naturally South will ruff high, then run the ten of hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: and then the director will take his copy of the hand records away|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||

nt|mdgraham: S may feel he has a bit to spare and go on - perhaps with 4NT - no, he has passed|pg||
nt|chick: once W gets in, she has 5 clubs, 3 diamonds (although she doesn't know it yet), and the heart.  |pg||

nt|barnets: thats why south neede hold only 2 |pg||
pc|sT|nt|fluffy: but with north as declarer this is probably going down|pg||
nt|star6ija: now second relay 3@d and the major is revealed reversed way @ss shows @hs, @hs shows @ss...this method is created to allow strong hand to be declarer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I reckon even I could make this (on a good day)|pg||
nt|barnets: when east gets in can play @SJ|pg||
nt|geot: wd|pg||
nt|fluffy: opposite a limited hand you can use 3NT as no short slam try, since 3@s is limited you don't need serious or non serious for anything|pg||

nt|barnets: and bids at 4 level show sings|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|james_h: now, where to?|pg||
nt|gulyas: note that the lead did not give much away - defenders could not play @Ss effectively anyway, and 2@Ss can be discarded on the @Ds anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can make this improbable contract now|pg||
nt|gulyas: how?|pg||
nt|barnets: this will eventually pick 4 spade tricks for def|pg||
nt|dburn: Versace giving Lauria quite a lot of rope as usual - but this time he missed a game|pg||
nt|chick: now N can cash @SA and the @HK and she's done|pg||
pc|hK|nt|geot: This will be a pick up for Norway, a nice pick up actually|pg||
nt|james_h: I expect so|pg||
nt|psyck: yes 3@h probably just showed @h|pg||
nt|clinch: Just to be clear, I wasn't criticising any bid, just noting E's aggressive style|pg||

nt|baardolav: Both 4@s and 4@h makes... +1 I believe |pg||
nt|geot: Game can be played in either major, np. |pg||
nt|oleberg:  3NT = Preempt in a major|pg||
nt|monde9: when N playing 1 NT made 3 on king of @H lead|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Cannot remember the diference betweem this and a direct 4@H|pg||
nt|oleberg:  West tempted to pass? :)|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea thinking or BBO is slow ? :)|pg||
nt|monde9: They can read "The Dubliners" during that :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Hagen thinking. I enter the bidding two at a time so players on other side of screen dont know who is taking their time to bid..|pg||
nt|monde9: ok Ty :)|pg||
nt|barnets: and no good fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well it does work if not covered|pg||

mb|1H|nt|geot: This is a great result for Ireland|pg||

nt|gulyas: 5@C only down 1, but 5@H is close to making, too|pg||
nt|james_h: Its not often that N/S are 1 board ahead of the other room|pg||

nt|dburn: I have to go to a press conference - enjoy the match, people|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam went off - the azurri jump ahead|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: obviously both majors now :)|pg||
nt|barnets: have sing to make slam after 1-3 start|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx David|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tez: 3 sanzatu super|pg||
nt|tez: du bakali nolcek|pg||
nt|geot: 4@S is a super contract|pg||
nt|geot: and here we go|pg||
nt|james_h: snap|pg||
nt|geot: 4C! is showing a big hand with 5@C+5@S|pg||
nt|james_h: I doubt that will be the case come board 20|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT N/S on a possible @D lead may make.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even making four required major help from defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fredin deems his hand not worth a constructive direct raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@S can make from south hand, with some luck and a spade guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: briçte senyör = 60+ yaþ demektir|pg||
nt|star6ija: sacrifice is good here|pg||
nt|geot: Great fit both directions|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: face psiakrew na le¿¹xo licho siê pisze:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: but Madala gave up|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Looks like 2@D vulnerable it a week two|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like def slipped up also on last hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=F1, (good 12/13)14+ HCP, 5+@D 4@D441   this is first time i've seen  the good 12 apply|pg||
nt|blum1956: the vulnerability may prevent EW from the 5th level save|pg||
nt|geot: Looks like declarer must have taken the double finesse in hearts at the other table|pg||
nt|geot: for running scores all series: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: NS in 5@Cx on 9, the double will make it easier to win (make overtrick)|pg||
nt|monde9: now that's the time for Konow to hesitate ? |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: they can tell by the mouse clicks. This is standard procedure for vu graph operators. |pg||
nt|gulyas: EW has 3@Cs making, maybe even 4|pg||
nt|gulyas: so NS stealing the contract in both rooms|pg||
nt|baldjean: no dilly-dallying here; I would directl< go for 3nt if I were N. why give opponents information?|pg||
nt|geot: I guess the pair holding the spades will "win" the bidding, but how high|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ken__: ama bu kadar önde olduklarýný tahmin etmiyorlardýr bence|pg||
nt|geot: If declarer does nothing funny there will be 2 spade losers and a diamond loser|pg||
nt|blum1956: Do Bakshi-Townsend have an agreement against the popular "redouble=bid your auit" convention?|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d ya pas geçmesinin sebebi..2@d kontrlu oynamak istemesindendi assaelin|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorulara cevap vereyim|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a lot of tricks for NS here - looks like 13 - 6+1+2+4|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: line up yazýlýrken  tahmin etmeleri lkazým:)|pg||
nt|geot: He will probably cross to hand with the @HA and take a spade finesse followed by the ace, then play on clubs for +620|pg||
nt|clinch: Pass looks normal here|pg||
nt|clinch: Yep|pg||
nt|baardolav: Aronov will earn one imp on this hand... if NS play diamond and diamond all the time|pg||
nt|baardolav: you need the double finesse for the entry|pg||
nt|geot: not really|pg||
nt|star6ija: the coach Vladislav Ispoeski helped me with explanation of the openning: 54+ in majors (NonVul maybe 4441), VUL usually 55+ 6-10|pg||
nt|oleberg:  5@H is even wrongsided|pg||
nt|solex333: lead directing bid ?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW did not came close to 6@D/@H but suits does not break|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: will they investigate @D slam?|pg||
nt|blum1956: "your suit"|pg||
nt|blum1956: Karpov is accurate|pg||
nt|clinch: Cards don't lie that well even for declarer to make 3|pg||
nt|clinch: Seemed to my (lesser than these guys) eyes to be between a 2 and 3 @h rebid|pg||
nt|monde9: same story as in Open|pg||
nt|oleberg:  In West it takes the lead of a diamond-singleton to defeat|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Virtually impossible to find :)|pg||
nt|monde9: 4 @D was alerted :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: both majors are makable, lets see how 2@S fares here|pg||
nt|baldjean: since this contract will not make it does not matter much|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, not certain about NS system - not sure whether 2@c is GF or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if 4NT is quantitative|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: on hand 8 down three is that ok we just waiting for the |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sorry priv|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 2@d ya pas geçeyim..ortak kontr der belki..ben de pas geçerim..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bir oyuncu 60+ yaþýnda ise hem senyör hem açýk takýma katýlma hakkýna sahiptir|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Probably a re-transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: whatever it is, it's taken up quite a lot of room|pg||
nt|murat e: hands fitting well despite zero trump fit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|geot: but other lines will work as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea what inferences are available from Fantoni's sequence  [2@H then 3N  vs  immediate 3N ...]|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably the agreement is that 4th hand passes first with good hand|pg||
nt|chick: well, they did well to avoid the heart game, since ruffs are possible|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tez: ters taraftan oynuyorlar ama @c atak edilmez heralde|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise Townsend's first pass looks strange|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no doubt 2@C was some form of gazilli|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: 5@H needs 3 rnds of @Ds to beat it|pg||
nt|kamyk: uparty ten W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess -- Fantoni was showing hand that hoped for reopening DBL|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good lead so long as they collect the 2@c b4 S gets rid of one|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N only chance of making game|pg||
nt|fluffy: lower that I though at first, @sQ doesn't look very offensive, but 7@h is 7@h|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|blum1956: His hand deserves a 3@h bid if it is nonforcing. Still it could force according to their agreement|pg||
nt|geot: some problems here...when trying to ruff clubs West can ruff over|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ken__: 2tur boþlayacak körü|pg||
nt|lechcold: E te¿:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: Smirnov's actions in this match are not very successfull|pg||
nt|clinch: @s suit won't fetch, @c finesse wrog, but may have to be taken for -2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yani Açýk takýmlarda yaþ ve cinsiyet sýnýrlamasý yok|pg||
nt|baldjean: at the other table N directlly bid 3nt|pg||
pc|h6|nt|james_h: Wrang was not born yesterday|pg||
nt|star6ija: Isporski *|pg||
nt|barnets: so 4@H down in other room with 4 inescapable losers|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ken__: karo atmasý lazýmdý yerden|pg||
nt|ken__: 1@d 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: evet |pg||
nt|clinch: May have to be attempted, in order to make contract|pg||
nt|geot: Italy went down in 4@H where Helness played 5@D +1|pg||
nt|geot: 2 down, so 13 IMPs to Monaco|pg||
nt|geot: Not easy this contract. May lose a heart, a club and two overruffs if he goes for the club ruffs|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe best line is one trump, then two round of diamonds?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|geot: 3NT will most likely go down as well|pg||
nt|geot: 4@H was an ok contract?  3-3 hearts or club finesse|pg||
pc|h8|nt|james_h: He use to play in the High/medium skates rubber bridge game in TGR in London for many years|pg||
nt|fluffy: you cn affrord to leave north with one trump|pg||
nt|riccho:  obv you managed to feed computer with results|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: got there in the end|pg||
pc|c4|nt|geot: oops|pg||
nt|geot: if he runs this one it might be some trouble here|pg||
nt|geot: or...then he will go down to put it another way|pg||
nt|james_h: he will play the Q|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|geot: that is why the first suggested line is better, I think|pg||
nt|geot: just to cross to the heart ace and finesse spades|pg||
nt|james_h: lol|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: If S played a spade back at trick 2 its much harder to find the @D switch by west.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: He's keeping the trick up... giving this plenty thought|pg||
nt|baldjean: it may even be down 2|pg||
nt|baldjean: if W continues @h now E gets a ruff|pg||
nt|sastro: alles was man machen muss ist die @h-Dame zu finden - ich persönlich hasse das, wenn das so ist|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kamyk: straszny pesymista - 5@H móg³ chyba wyksztusiæ - okazja dla naszej pary w otwartym |pg||

nt|gulyas: yes, going down for sure now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mcphee: if the redble is a the 10 mark his simple raise seems to get across what he holds|pg||
nt|baardolav: You need will make the double finesse now|pg||

nt|tez: büyük abi 5@c olur diyor|pg||
nt|geot: the defence must be careful now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: not sure about 3@H, presumably it showed his junk, not standard gazilli but everyone seems to have their own version|pg||
nt|begse: 2@d 6 tane körle pas dermi salvo sadece pik þikanla neg free bid oynamadýklarý için tercihini pastan yana kullandý|pg||

nt|barnets: @DQ|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|blum1956: Thanks to the spectator I realised that Karpov is PH. Then I suppose 3@h was most correct|pg||

nt|riccho:  but 4@c is more difficult than 3@c|pg||
nt|geot: wd Drijver. He new the hand in a way now, but still a good defence. Also the switch to the 7 of @D was important (not a low) |pg||

nt|baldjean: though we have of course seen matches where the trailing team still won|pg||
nt|gulyas: so maybe a swing for Hungary, as EW can make game (4@H or even 3nt probably)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3 down is also possible if they play a trump in time|pg||
nt|riccho:  the strngth of 3@c depends on the strength of intervention bids. |pg||

nt|barnets: scotland bid it|pg||

nt|fabsayc: wow, this late to decide to bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s needs a correct club guess after the heart lead, being laydown after the diamond one|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Greece - Turkey 25-5 at the moment|pg||

nt|ken__: ve demiþler gerçekten|pg||
nt|ken__: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C = South African Texas     standard Texas transfers with 4@D/@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is right of course, but unusual|pg||
nt|geot: If Shouth held diamond ace instead of the spade K this bid would have been fine|pg||
nt|roswolf: cant see where 10 tricks come from|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looked like 9 ok in @H ew|pg||
nt|roswolf: but may/should be a fair result for the english cause|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gulyas: why?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: not sure. play continues, but he has left the table. may only be looking for some1 to turn the cards|pg||
nt|blum1956: If the declarer uses the diamond suit correctly he will sooner or later win|pg||
nt|blum1956: But he does not know the advere distribution. The only thing he may be sure after the lead - 3rs spade trick|pg||
nt|tez: @h as @h as diye tezahurat yapmayýn..@s atak edecek|pg||
nt|baldjean: probably down 2, siknce Q@d won't be guessed|pg||
nt|baldjean: since*|pg||
nt|roswolf: quick play|pg||
pc|d8|nt|monde9: South is playing in Open it was N|pg||
nt|geot: hard declarer problem again. Maybe he must finesse the club then to win|pg||
nt|fluffy: how to play this?, maybe try to stablish some hearts before club entry is gone, or perhaps draw trumps and play your best in clubs (low to 10)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sastro: ich sag besser nix zu dem Ausspiel- kann man denn nicht einmal neutral @h ausspielen >?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually 3s is beatable|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice def|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some players have a rule to always bid game after 1M-3M if they have a singleton or void|pg||
nt|fluffy: we can see that drawing trumps works, because he cannot be tap with diamonds|pg||
nt|geot: if he don't finesse the ten he is in danger of losing three clubs and a spade|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzgn: he is back now explaining his absence - but in italian!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart ace and ruff and second ruff when in with spade ace|pg||
nt|james_h: The difference on board 9 was Fitzgibbon deciding to upgrade his 13 count to a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 7 tricks on top.  Possible overtrick in H, or long spade - but i doubt declarer will risk anything|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kötü deðil aslýnda. kör ruanýn uçmasýna baðlý |pg||
nt|gulyas: did not notice the trump spots, it could be down 4 now|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|clinch: This works well|pg||
nt|barnets: can pressure be put on north who isholding the pointed suits ?|pg||
nt|geot: establish heart was an option, but he don't even know the club king is an entry|pg||
nt|barnets: cards lay well for dec|pg||
nt|geot: Nothing can hurt him now, can it?|pg||
nt|fluffy: I think no, he is in control, what about 3NT? lack of comunication can make it hard to make, but defence really only has 1 trick in each suit|pg||
nt|barnets: hard to beat also|pg||
nt|geot: I think finessing clubs was by far the best line|pg||
nt|geot: going for the hearts needs a guess there, and later guess in clubs to get an entry etc etc|pg||
nt|fluffy: I think you are right Geo, but when I see all cards I never trust my judgement to be precise :)|pg||
nt|murat e: club finesse not working:)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|blum1956: good start, now he will succeed |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Khokhlov still thinking|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably  the best for Khokhlov is to discard a club and then try to create a loosing option for the declarer by leading a small heart (when in the lead)|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, looks like 4 down indeed|pg||
nt|gulyas: ouch, Hungary down in 5@H in the OR|pg||
nt|barnets: the nice play was to finesse clubs bfoe playing trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: before trumps|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: bu günün son eli|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west hand automatic opener for most big clubbers -- not sure if deWijs will open 1N [good 12-15]|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@d is 4+ diamonds unbalanced|pg||
nt|begse: tek karo|pg||
nt|monde9: a lightner here for -1 X in N in TOR|pg||
nt|gulyas: -6 instead of +6|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@S  seems too high|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: X=majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: it was the lucky 1nt opening - if it went 1@C-1@H overcall, they would never have gotten to this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe Fantoni's DBL = same HCP as opener|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like a fairly routine 3NT E/W ..|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2@d 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|fabsayc: score on board 7 is still wrong|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4@H is down on a diamond lead - as 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can make double dummy perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: low club towards the jack|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South would like to X here - but it may show a hand with 4+@S|pg||
nt|monde9: 6 @S is the normal & good contract|pg||
nt|monde9: for N-S|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not really, when 3@H is a winner|pg||

nt|nilsland:  and welcome!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: but Muller treating the DBL as artificial rather than Penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs Strong NT   NS DBL = 4@H/@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe always that shape, but vs weak NT  also shows HCP|pg||
nt|blum1956: The Rudakov-Khokhlov CC does not contain the meaning of the 2@h  bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess it guarantees at least 3-card support, thus Rudakov is able to splinter|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel putting a storming performance so far ... I'm looking forward to reviewing their results|pg||
nt|oleberg:  This might end with 6@S in south|pg||
nt|ritong: if you did so, id a free shot for me:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|eyamut: sabah mý?|pg||
nt|blum1956: the rest is simple|pg||

nt|nilsland:  surprisingly - but RD showed a good hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And Lauria is hoping for a club lead|pg||
nt|monde9: :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Where an underlead of clubs is needed|pg||
nt|baldjean: Hungary now need 6 IMPs per board to still win this|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w may not get in bidding now|pg||
nt|geot: but it depends on methods|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s I meant|pg||
nt|barnets: with 5 losers but the scottish west bid 4@S over 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he expects the contract to be cold|pg||
nt|clinch: Well it's obviously preemptive... I mean by agreement|pg||
nt|monde9: same 200 but different contracts :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: the formula is 3sn+1|pg||
nt|ritong: 2sn+1*|pg||
nt|ritong: ty ty|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helgemos double is a little aggressive but makes life easy|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C invitational stayman|pg||
nt|gulyas: or just showing 4@H now with a minimum GF|pg||
nt|geot: this looks strange|pg||
nt|barnets: par looks like 5@SX down 1|pg||
nt|barnets: which again seems a lot|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzgn: These lads don't make it easy for me :) All conversation at this table is in Russian, including explanations and claims|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is not obvious to double a partscore knowing that you have a 9-card heart fit|pg||
nt|ritong: south visibly having the rest of the high cards|pg||
nt|ritong: now, the @d five bagger is a bad surprise|pg||
nt|nilsland:  BjÃ¶rn knows that Lauria is prepared for a club lead|pg||
nt|nilsland:  so he will not lead a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so sure he wont|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In this situation Fredin could not pass over the RD because that would probably show values - so 3@C is not a free bid|pg||
nt|ritong: also, who understands redouble?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would translate " my @hs are fine"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble=max hand probably|pg||
nt|ritong: has he?|pg||
nt|geot: this will not be any swing, standard 4@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible to go down|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody|pg||
nt|riccho:  hi!|pg||
nt|barnets: he has come to bid this set it appears|pg||
nt|geot: Need to guess the diamonds to win this 3NT|pg||
nt|osvaill83: board 7, Fantoni is playing 5! x|pg||
nt|roswolf: no risk of getting too high here|pg||

nt|monde9: Bogdan Marina in N seems more cool to me :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|james_h: 2@c is probably a version of Drury showing 3 card fir|pg||
nt|geot: I think on board 10, the 3@S, it was something to be said for playing the Ace of trumps first. That is if East had KJ doubleton. So playing the ace and later play as he did was ...|pg||
nt|geot: acdtually ok|pg||
nt|james_h: fit|pg||
nt|james_h: 2s = min|pg||
nt|pauleger: 3@d = 4+ @c I am told|pg||
nt|psyck: so E shows his suits by not bidding them|pg||
nt|clinch: Might have been clobbered if N only had 4 @s|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer just needs to guess the @SJ to make, which should be a normal play to finesse|pg||
nt|gulyas: I mean, normal to play it to W after E shows up with the long @Cs|pg||
nt|baldjean: N/S can develop a @H trick here for 9 tricks, but it needs careful play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good 2NT rebid - 2NT usually stronger in a balanced hand, but here W has a good source of tricks in diamonds  |pg||
nt|barnets: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|barnets: for running scores|pg||
nt|osvaill83: 5@H|pg||
nt|barnets: needs to get 4@D tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: interesting use of 4C as a kind of leaping michaels, kibitzers will no doubt say standard in France but new to me|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 1S shows @D i assume - 2@s anyone know what that means ?|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@d pretty comfortable losing 3 red tricks in all likelihood|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: i blame it on the defenseless 3@S bid :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: when did that bid promise any defenses?:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: I first played against Tiit Laanemae in... probably 1979. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs a spade switch sharpish-like|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not obvious for either North or South, that this is a cashout-situation|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: defenseless bids cause opponents to overbid|pg||
nt|gulyas: well bid, this may make|pg||
nt|geot: Some will maybe consider 3NT as South. Bad contract, but would make |pg||
nt|monde9: Rotaru X the 6 @S for @D leading in TOR|pg||
nt|geot: South did not bid at the 2 level, but 3@S. He knows that North has got a singleton heart because of the fact that East superaccepted the transfer|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|sastro: merkwürdig- denke mal, dass 2 D als Transfer gedacht war|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzeq: akþam pardon|pg||
nt|gulyas: that would not work with E having 2 aces|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after an A/K lead vs NT, the defenders carding is usually either count/attitude, not suit pref - so if N finds a spade switch we can be seriously impressed |pg||
nt|barnets: e/w have only 1 obvious loser|pg||
nt|barnets: in hearts|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no bonus points for being in 5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: N needs to cash his @HQ to beat it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not obvious|pg||
nt|gulyas: its true that his black suit holdings are not very promising|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: after 2@h 3@H by w|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: if pd has a @C honor, and only one @H honor, @HQ could be fatal|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: i speak about led|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: he has closed the screen and asked if 3@c was forcing|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@C is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: now sketching sample hands and asking Hegedus how he would have bid them|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: if 3 @c is forcing Bocchi probably plays @hQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: I cannot tell exactly what the @D8 is, but says on the card, that hi-x is even, low-x is odd|pg||
nt|gulyas: but its attitude as well|pg||
nt|gulyas: so he cannot have Axxx|pg||
nt|gulyas: for convention cards: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=Italy&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5C2012Dubli...|pg||

pc|cK|nt|geot: the 4@S I mean, reached and won by both teams|pg||
nt|baardolav: and here same number of tricks all over|pg||
nt|oleberg:  6@D is an ok spot|pg||
nt|ritong: he has the entries for the standard trump handling|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helness looks like a man that makes it|pg||
nt|barnets: if 4@D was a natural bid why did East not go to 5 level ?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|james_h: well denies a major anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 2@D explained as 18-19 bal - hard to overhear, but I think 2@s was explained as denying major|pg||
nt|tez: güney dengeli 16 puanla 1 saniye düþünmedi pas geçmek için|pg||

nt|blum1956: And if I am not mistaken, Eugeni Rudakov who is playing the OR now was born just in 1979|pg||
nt|nilsland:  correction 8 imps on the strange multi|pg||
nt|monde9: 4 @S was not that easy here ; |pg||
nt|nilsland:  never in much danger however|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, E thought he was just trying to steal a trick and went up with the @SA, no harm done, a likely push|pg||
nt|riccho:  bidding in bd 12 was not very convincing|pg||
nt|barnets: and they could just about make 6@H|pg||
nt|barnets: he should have tossed the coin |pg||
nt|tomi2: 1SA zeigte 4er Pik mit 11-17 Punkten |pg||
nt|sastro: bei @h - Rückspiel hätte Fritsche die Kontrolle verloren. Die erste Unsicherheit der Russen|pg||
nt|chick: hmmm, looked to me like she should have made that|pg||
nt|murat e: probably lost one trick to dia7|pg||

nt|monde9: ducking @S & playng @C |pg||
nt|nilsland:  As they say on Viasat Golf: These guys are good :)|pg||
nt|ritong: the problem with tor helness is you have to type like a rocket, otherwise he takes you in speed|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D versprach bereits eine unausgeglichene Hand, mit 5332 eröffnen sie 1@C oder die ensprechende SA Stufe|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another 10 England on board 9|pg||
mb|1C|nt|geot: or gives them a real lead, to put it that way. |pg||
nt|james_h: the 11-13 1@c gave Hanlon-McGann the opportunity to locate a double fitting hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|nilsland:  BjÃ¶rn found the good lead and 8 came back|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helgemo is hoping for much more bidding|pg||
nt|mcphee: risky to try 3@H?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|geot: Yes, and it was good judgement by North with KJx of spades in partners side suit, to accept the game invite|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, ok, 3nt is easy:)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 12 imps for sweden - stayed low in 3@h bd 10 and Ireland pushed to 3NT on bd 11|pg||

nt|barnets: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|barnets: for running scores|pg||
nt|geot: Many matches have opened up since i said there were all tight matches. Ireland has no a lead worth 25VPs ag Iceland|pg||
nt|geot: 52-7 after nine boards|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=918&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|fluffy: this 12 imp 50-50 swings on a match that costs twice can be very costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  the 1@h opening was at least misleading partner in evaluating slam chances|pg||
nt|geot: sorry 57-2|pg||
nt|barnets: Italy are 19vps behind Monaco as results stand|pg||
nt|geot: Both leaders  Monaco and no. 2 England are behind in their matches|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nilsland:  as I expected :)|pg||
nt|clinch: Looks like a meek NT partial here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bizimkiler de 7 karo demeyebilirdi diye itiraz ettiler|pg||
nt|geot: Another "boring" hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: and now the 3N|pg||
nt|gulyas: I hear NS is in 3@D on bd12, so this a 10 imp pickup for Hungary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very quiet set so far - biggest swing 8 imps|pg||
nt|riccho:  in mypersonal opinion: you sould not open 1@h in a astrong club system with a hand with game-forcing values|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@s is a take out double I think double would show 4+@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes england bid the vul game - allez les blancs|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H can be set on @D lead with ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: good judgement on the 3@h by NS in the open room|pg||
nt|fluffy: after board 9, Bulgaria had regained the lead on group A, just 1 VP ahead of Italy|pg||
nt|mcphee: helgemo, no fear pard we have em now|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t think daddy bessis loves it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  They certainly has to improve their declarer play - or go to the bank|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@H makes |pg||
mb|2S|nt|geot: Tough 3@S bid from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at other table nystrom doubled 2@H, a move i think should show a better overall hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was time we started the comeback :)|pg||
nt|april7: its a nice pass by S, but a game try was appropriate imo|pg||
nt|barnets: 6N appears a trick short|pg||
nt|barnets: unless lead @CA|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: and North bids 3NT on the stiff king over his partner's t/o double|pg||
nt|ritong: notice that versace does not wander in doubling 2@h|pg||
nt|monde9: better lead : @H |pg||
nt|mcphee: oh my|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We go for crossruff|pg||
nt|mcphee: this isn't over yet:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: we are not sure which side will go for the cross ruff yet|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Geir know that Tor will lead a trump if he has one.|pg||
nt|geot: so a Michaels Cuebid here, and a tough 4@C bid by Duboin|pg||
mb|3H|nt|geot: All fine about the spades, but 3NT does not work very well anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C artificial game force, not sure about the rest|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No slam possible here.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and whats the TD verdict pls operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: still no ruling on board 3|pg||
nt|monde9: like that S can take the hand on the Jack of @C to give the ruff in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: it maybe helped by the EW action|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: declarer will want to draw trumps may just cash the K+A and then play on D which works on all 3/2 splits.  If the trumps 4/1 though ...|pg||
nt|ritong: ouah|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now he worries about the long pause|pg||
nt|gulyas: with everything friendly, 5 or even 6@C is a decent contract|pg||
nt|fluffy: now with @hQJx and @cA Versace doesn;t want to har 6@c|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gulyas: no lebensohl? strange|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 5@c? co to mia³o byæ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: It was probably Khokhlov who bid 3NT|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Were he thinking about 5@D??|pg||
nt|mcphee: hehehe|pg||
nt|april7: but successfulaccording to the layout|pg||
nt|barnets: unlucky trump break for n/s|pg||
nt|tomi2: hier haben die Russen offenbar ein Misverständnis, 2SA war mit Sicherheit nicht als natürlich gemeint|pg||
mb|p|nt|nevaio   _: maybe inverted on @H|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, they play inverted lebensohl style|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: 3@H weak|pg||
nt|lechcold: licytacja dla mnie troszkê dziwna.. no ale po 3@S by³o ciê¿ko stan¹æ w czêciówce|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 5@c? co to mia³o byæ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: This should be quick 1 down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hard for S to pass this!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: welcome, and thanks everybody, i have to leave in a few minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Sorry!|pg||
nt|pauleger: I just wanted to write "brave Versace"|pg||
nt|pauleger: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: great minds drink alike, martin|pg||
nt|monde9: can always go this defense, let see|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly better than 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: as usual i would rather be in 3nt|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Ok, played by N 6@s works|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, must be around 25% or 100% on actual layout|pg||
nt|ritong: confirmed, operator?|pg||
nt|sastro: da ist auch was schief gelaufen- |pg||
nt|murat e: Netherlands may get the lead if 2 sp down other table which is likely|pg||
pc|sK|nt|riccho:  yes. looks a bit overpessimistic to pass 2@h (NS playing 1NT 15-17)|pg||
nt|barnets: while this is a qualifying for the Brmuda Bowl the European Championships themselves  is one of the toughest tournaments to win and very prestiguous|pg||
nt|fluffy: that was quick|pg||
nt|geot: Italy won 7 imps on board 10, the 4@S that went down here as Fantunes played in 5@Hx minus 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: fast claim from helgemo without playing any more tricks|pg||
nt|geot: I am not saying declarer played wrong here, but think he could have won it if he went for the clubs ruffs....even though West will ruff over|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: but helness having a break...back soon no doubt |pg||
nt|geot: bd 10 that is....one club gets over ruffed, then East will later be squeezed in the minors. Double dummy though|pg||
nt|fluffy: the action is now on board  11 at the other table, what is the contract?|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@h|pg||
nt|barnets: Monaco s gain came when Bocchi misguessed the play in 4@H|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@h requires a non trump lead or switch to make due to lucky @dK third and no promotion|pg||
nt|barnets: losing to the @DK singlton|pg||
nt|barnets: when other lines would hav made the contract|pg||
nt|murat e: previous board|pg||
nt|chick: 3N can make only because the clubs split|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gulyas: 2nt shows a good hand, any other bid is just a wk hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak siê pytam dwa razy to znaczy by³em podwójnie zdziwiony|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3@c from Townsend first suggested by the viewgraph could have created a problem for EW |pg||
nt|clinch: Cards lie pretty well so may make 9, though would need a different NT range to bid game|pg||
nt|baldjean: this may make 12 tricks even|pg||
nt|barnets: dec will cash @SAK then throw all three cubs on hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: making 5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|james_h: exactly Karel|pg||
nt|tez: hala karar yokmuþ|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not obvious to make this, though double-dummy it is easy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kdr_fm: may also finesse into the east hand on the basis a @d switch will be hard to find.  S8 looks ominous|pg||
nt|baldjean: A @c can be played up here for making|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: i always thought lebensohl was backwards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you drinking sparkling grapfruit?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  seems operator have enough to do :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: Gromöler Reher hatten eine ähnliche Reizung und haben 620 geschrieben, 2SA war bei ihnen Lebensohl, Rehder konnte somit eine konstruktive Hand mit 4er Pik zeigen|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nilsland:  You may regret not double if S bids 3NT - but I agree :)|pg||
nt|clinch: Opposite 14-16 NT E might just have a go|pg||
nt|geot: or "@S was Chestem I am told|pg||
nt|geot: anyway, two suiter|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|monde9: not more now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: nah  sparkles suck:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hakem belki de oyuncuya birþeyler soruyordur ne düþündün diye|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oleberg:  Well, I guess it will be easy after all|pg||
nt|april7: and in bd 12, E  could have also bid an invitational 3@H or simmilar action, a 4@H bid looks a nbit different|pg||
nt|tomi2: im Vergleich zu einem Sprung nach 3 Pik, der vermutlich 5er zeigen würde|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kdr_fm: happy declarer now|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lechcold: Splinter bardzo ostry i st¹d przelicytowanie|pg||
nt|james_h: declarer is happy now|pg||
nt|nilsland:  But we may see TD at the table if Helgemo feels that its needed|pg||
nt|ritong: i doubt that|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I am not sure - East has a good hand and west may have 5-5|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Have lost play. Will claim with result when they are finished.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kamyk: dobrze, ¿e W to skontrowa³;|pg||
pc|hT|nt|geot: The bidding started the same way in the OR, but North chose to bid 4@C where he played|pg||
nt|monde9: is not yet in|pg||
nt|oleberg:  No, you are right|pg||
nt|oleberg:  He shouls have taken one high heart before the diamonds|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tez: @d rua ile alsa iyiydi|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: Nunes sequence of @S5 @S2  shows even number of cards with at least 1 honor|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oleberg:  The heart-lead in the other room made that task easy|pg||
nt|baldjean: puling 1 round of trump first would have given the 12th trick. now 11 only|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|clinch: Still, not making 9 anyway so likely to be nothing significant|pg||
mc|10|nt|oleberg:  Now a high spade from hand|pg||

nt|oleberg:  Yeah,:(|pg||
nt|oleberg:  :( as a dane|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Konow thinking...|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Had he taken one high heart earlier, he could have played a heart from dummy, when North was void, thus making it|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A harsh penalty for a marginal error|pg||
nt|solex333: monaco blitz poland 72-0 !|pg||
nt|monde9: I don't know how hot is the weather in Dublin but I can imahine very high teperatures in some brains of bridge players :)|pg||

nt|april7: another negative X? or would it be a penalty X? |pg||

nt|MolvaM: drury konvansiyonu|pg||

nt|monde9: & has an easier match with Austria this evening (on the paper & the classement Denmark is stronger)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Nine-card major-fits are overrated. Flat board.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  board 13 is always unlucky for somebody|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect 2@c=diamonds|pg||
nt|geot: On board 11 it looks like Madala is going down in 4@H (where Helness took the club hook on the 10 and won 4@S)|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: it works out ok here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In the other room Fabtoni went 2 down in 3@C|pg||

nt|blum1956: The diamond lead will help the declarer |pg||

nt|baldjean: 4@s looks makeable E/W, so another chance for Hungary to close the gap|pg||

nt|april7: also makable double dummy ofcourse|pg||
nt|geot: Ghestem that is, sorry|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: 2@D ask longer major|pg||

nt|nilsland:  BjÃ¶rns 3N denies support|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a feeling it shows 8 tricks, nothing to do with hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, a lot of players open flat 11's these days|pg||
nt|tomi2: das Board wird nicht gut Enden für Deutschland|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: i guess that is route for Nunes to invite|pg||
nt|pauleger: this will lead to 8 tricks |pg||
nt|sastro: with 1C lead|pg||
nt|ritong: an other possibility is " i don t like @ss" when 3@s would promise fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer will need to discard dummy's clubs to avoid a ruff|pg||

pc|cK|nt|nilsland:  I know Johan Bennet proposes 3N = I like NT better with a trick-taking hand|pg||
nt|clinch: 2@d to play opposite a bal hand with 3@d; 2@h showing precise shape|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks to Simon Cope for that|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: TD just informed us that this table is about one board late...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a spy tells me NS reached 6@S on board 10 - so it will be flat|pg||
nt|barnets: a spec said better than second last in the open|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sastro: west musste sich vom @D trennen|pg||
mb|d|nt|geot: What do you suggest James, with the West hand?|pg||
nt|james_h: Berg had 9 hcp, I'm sure he would draw the line with 8 :)|pg||

nt|tomi2: dann könnte Joerg ein weiteres Coeur spielen|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: down 3 2 hands in a row not encouraging|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|geot: I guess 2@D shows a major, possibly weak?|pg||

nt|baardolav: 30 HP ns... no 8card fits... 4nt |pg||
nt|baardolav: make an undo... operator|pg||
nt|geot: Operator?|pg||
nt|baardolav: North is opening|pg||
nt|monde9: except major accident, 4 @H is so easy to bid & make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite handy here to have double available as the weakest bid, and for pass to show a few bits and pieces|pg||
nt|geot: 9 tricks in 9 seconds:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: dann muss west eine schwarze Karte abwerfen und hat keinen Übergang mehr zu Partners Karostich|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|james_h: I'd make the cheapest action, 3@s too rich for me|pg||
nt|geot: North did not bother to listen to this, and the standard 3NT was reached|pg||
nt|mcphee: that is a heavy 3@S|pg||
nt|barnets: Netherlands defeated Italy in the semi fina of the last World Championships before ging on to win it|pg||
nt|pelu:  only N know the 1@h bid by East|pg||
nt|fluffy: if double was just take out I think Helgemo would bid 3@c, but on the modern style that shows hearts his hand is not worth it|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: I kinda like 3S in these vuls, although it is for younger people than me, really......|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Yes this did happen...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Rudakov thought a long time before passing|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Scotland doing well in the Seniors aye|pg||

pc|d3|nt|gulyas: but they find the good 3nt|pg||
nt|ritong: which they would have bid left to themselves|pg||

nt|baardolav: if aronov ducks I believe Bocchi play club for the ten|pg||
pc|s4|nt|clinch: Guess that was known then|pg||
nt|pelu:  and @s10 in trick 1 was a mistake by E|pg||
pc|sK|nt|blum1956: 1@c could be everything, still 3@s is a  dangerous bid (@s xx and @h Kx with South is enough for the game)|pg||

nt|sastro: but missing the communication for the squeeze   |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Lauria thinking...|pg||
nt|psyck: One would bet on him figuring it out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's more like it :)|pg||
nt|barnets: Bocchi guessed 3N|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kdr_fm: has on real option now but the @C finesse, when E will show out in @s|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: could play east for @HQxx precisely but I dont think thats as good odds as the @C position|pg||
nt|fluffy: going to cross ruff as much as they let him|pg||
nt|barnets: where Helness did not|pg||
pc|c2|nt|clinch: So, looking at convention card it seems that double may just have meant "don't lead a @d"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: for NS  that works up through 9x|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Nunes didn't open with 4-Qs  so deWijs can't with only 4-Js|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- let's play this again|pg||
nt|tomi2: other room as well in 3nt E, also medium club lead and 8 from north|pg||
nt|tomi2: let's see how Piekarek plays this|pg||
nt|psyck: should be interesting, a chance for Germany to catch up|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, versace is a superactive bidder|pg||
nt|star6ija: yup|pg||
nt|baardolav: but then aronov could have played clubs|pg||
nt|monde9: more than 20 IMP's than France :)|pg||
nt|solex333: vp's|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea did it :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Half time just announced in playing area|pg||
nt|barnets: good result for scotland in open|pg||
nt|barnets: see if denmark can duplicate it|pg||
nt|pelu:  4@s prob down on @s-lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they may well tie that board|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: They are the best team in my opinon|pg||
nt|james_h: I seriously doubt that Monaci will win, while wishing them well at the same time|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Gromov is an extremely fast player, Dubinin being no faster then average |pg||
nt|monde9: & I said he's a very good dec :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|james_h: Monaco|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|geot: Italy favourites of course, then the World Champs the Netherlands|pg||
nt|james_h: y, throw Poland into the mix also|pg||
nt|geot: But I think Monaco has a chance|pg||
nt|geot: Polan is always in such a mix|pg||
nt|james_h: only 17 imps on that hand|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ohh big swing - played from the other hand and teh S lead gave declarer more options, went -2|pg||
nt|clinch: That's a pretty dire opening bid|pg||
nt|tez: 4@h oluyor 5@d oluyor|pg||
nt|tez: bizde 4@s e yakýnýz|pg||
nt|MolvaM: internet kopmasýndan önce bu masada bulunan yaklaþýk 700 seyircinin hayatlarýndan endiþe ediyoruz|pg||
nt|tez: oyuna ve savunmaya baðlý|pg||
nt|baldjean: 51 IMPs are too much to gain in only 5 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well if sweden wins the europeans, maybe you get bragging rights for a year|pg||
nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
mb|1S|nt|geot: Will be interesting to see how Israel goes|pg||
nt|james_h: They have shown no form dispite bursting with talent|pg||
nt|lechcold: równy podzia³ pików oznacza, ¿e na WE wychodzi zarówno 4@S, jak i 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N 12-14   could include any 5422 except @H & @S  [so 5-card major is common]|pg||
nt|mcphee: so the bar is open?|pg||
nt|gulyas: luckily, this is not a knock out match|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  I am not sure they can bid either :P|pg||
nt|ritong: making friends is your strong points, true?|pg||
nt|ritong: -s|pg||
nt|clinch: Taking vulnerability into account|pg||
nt|baardolav: A new 4nt from OR|pg||
nt|baardolav: where 6@s can be made...|pg||
nt|barnets: a club lead defeats an e/w slam|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = TRF, not necessarily @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible 6|pg||
nt|gulyas: gain half of it back, and I would be happy:)|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3@c looks like a Bergen raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 10 the english taught the italians a shap lesson in 2@hx -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: in his room south did not overcall since he bid 1@H himself, so he does not know the @H layout|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not really hehe|pg||
nt|baardolav: both black small slams and 6nt is makeable|pg||
nt|geot: Friendly clubs makes both 6@S and 6NT makeable. Have to solve the spades though|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6 @s needs very unusual treatment of trumps|pg||
nt|geot: You have to bring in the spades in NT as well|pg||
nt|monde9: the finesse in @H was protecting the @C in the same time|pg||
nt|tisserand: good bid 4nt|pg||
nt|barnets: at present Monaco 21 a head of england in 2nd and 32 head of Italy|pg||
nt|roswolf: sharp|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: They are good players, but I do not expect them to win this time. They are young, very good, but ......maybe in a few years|pg||
nt|james_h: Fitzgibbon is not lacking courage|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s not easy to reach|pg||
nt|james_h: 3@h is a balanced slam try (I think)|pg||
nt|ritong: oohh|pg||
nt|baardolav: it is no help making the @c tricks in 6nt... before you play spade|pg||
nt|april7: nothing special here, easy 4@H, but a 3@C opener might have made NS task more difficult|pg||
nt|barnets: in diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: can they get to hearts ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: now looks like on the way|pg||
nt|clinch: Forrester must know that Gold is weak, and one assumes that must mean he has 5 @d at least. I'm just guessing this, but it's logical to me|pg||
nt|tez: 5@d @h ataðýndan sonra batýyor(muþ)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1SA zeigt 4+@C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|baardolav: double club have single spade...|pg||
nt|mcphee: make a lot of @S here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  That why they are playing so quick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 9 imps to France on board 11 - 4@sx= next door |pg||
nt|mdgraham: N has an awkward hand-type|pg||
nt|april7: the vulnerability held W back from opening 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu:  in OR East bid 3@D and now S sh know that he has to protect his @d-trivk by leading @S in trick 1 or trick 2|pg||
nt|barnets: in third|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes another 7 imps|pg||
nt|murat e: these 10 hcp hands are always problem west did well not to invite this time|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: 2@C game force, 3@C relay, not sure about 3@D|pg||
nt|clinch: Ah apparently 1@d showed 5@d; thanks|pg||
nt|gulyas: S reopening yet again, N is happy to pass that|pg||
nt|gulyas: but it needed some @S plays to beat this 2 tricks I think|pg||
nt|fluffy: Monaco is going very well, but I wonder if they can keep this pace, at some point they will either be more tired than others, or make Pierre Zimmerman play a  bit more|pg||
nt|fluffy: maybe for this 2 pairs getting tired doesn't even enter their vocabulary :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|james_h: nice lead|pg||
nt|james_h: dont know if it will make any difference tho|pg||
nt|geot: Unusual to let E/W play 3@C I think|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel are a tough outfit, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Monitor gone, Muller thinking again! Players joking about the situation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 4@c perhaps|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|blum1956: Not enough from Karpov's point of view, needs some extra values (few)|pg||
nt|tez: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|barnets: we |pg||
nt|barnets: yes even trump switch is too late now|pg||
nt|barnets: dec can duck a diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: ruff a diamond |pg||
nt|barnets: and lose a heart to north|pg||
nt|barnets: who has no more diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: he can then pitch his diamond loser on long heart|pg||
nt|pelu:  can he make on @S in trick 1?|pg||
nt|barnets: i am not sure he can make it on a trump lead no|pg||
nt|pelu:  u are the expert Barnet :)|pg||
nt|barnets: as south can get in with a club to cash the long diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: perforce @S @D @S @DA @D ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: now cant duck heart to north|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: actually only 1 board behind other room|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S was afraid of @h, it appears|pg||
nt|gulyas: the defense has to be careful not to try any trump promotion|pg||
nt|baldjean: still ok with @H switch, I think|pg||
nt|barnets: we can see diamonds are well placed|pg||
nt|barnets: but it would be a poor slam|pg||
nt|jbennet: a winning view taken by west wd. Not clearcut.|pg||
nt|barnets: going down |pg||
nt|barnets: when diamonds bad|pg||
pc|s3|nt|geot: In my opinion I think South should bid 3@S. I know I am seeing all the hands, but.....|pg||
nt|baardolav: true|pg||
nt|baardolav: sorry private|pg||
nt|monde9: it was not a big risk of ruff in @S with the lead of @D|pg||
nt|barnets: Wests 4N showed two places to play|pg||
nt|barnets: who can put south in with @CA|pg||
nt|roswolf: a controlled auc5tion here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|baldfriede: so no 3nt|pg||
nt|baardolav: Even if you miss the spade play in 4@s here... I think Bulgaria make +1 imp|pg||
nt|fluffy: this lead ensures the 2 spade tricks fron south :)|pg||
nt|geot: At this moment Israel leads the group. But it is 237 237 236 236|pg||
nt|nilsland:  1NT would have been better this time|pg||
nt|mcphee: difficult to pass|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe some S hands will act over 1N|pg||
nt|mcphee: no fun defending NT with S hand|pg||
nt|barnets: thats what I see anyway for what its worth|pg||
nt|geot: Nice lead:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: these two are excellent in the part scores usually|pg||
nt|roswolf: tricky lead may have to finesse to make the contract - tough|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|blum1956: As everyone may see, in the OR Khiouppenen doubled 1NT, then Forrester (East) bid 2@d (which probably was "diamonds or majors"?) and was buried there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now cue bids (this partnership's favorite action)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In many systems East will be able to show short diamonds which would cool off West|pg||
nt|ritong: @s lead looks very possible after this auction|pg||
nt|ritong: so they better stop lower than 6|pg||
nt|tez: þu direktör onlarýn aleyhine olcaksa.kararý bildirseydi..iyi olacaktý|pg||
nt|gulyas: ouch|pg||
nt|pelu:  tx :)|pg||
nt|barnets: for setting trick|pg||
nt|pelu:  ok 1 out of 3 - try a @s now|pg||
nt|barnets: needs tump lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nilsland:  At the other table it started 1N-3@D showing 4441 with a singleton minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like that a whole lot better|pg||
nt|clinch: This looks to be on the @h guess; won't be much of a guess after Forrester turns up with AQ of trumps and a @d honour|pg||
nt|murat e: may pairs play nt 14-16 for that reason|pg||
pc|h3|nt|james_h: 3s initially, makes life easy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Yes - west will ask for which minor and then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@d might be turbo-ish|pg||
nt|ritong: showing odd number of keys and something interesting in @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: a priori interesting, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: 4NT would show even number of keys|pg||
nt|nilsland:  at least we know that they probably know what they are doing :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think they play turbo on this auction|pg||
nt|gulyas: now down 1 only|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: good lead by south|pg||
pc|h9|nt|geot: South showed a good raise of spades with 2@D|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|barnets: anyway making now for sure so|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kdr_fm: if east had the @HT - 6@S could make - as it is the @HT with west will beat it.|pg||
nt|april7: 2imps to Ireland|pg||
nt|barnets: good match|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcphee: perhaps E was a bit conservative|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or not|pg||
nt|ritong: i t would match  now, i m told they do play turbo, but restricted to minor fits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a straightforward hand to play - may try a cross-ruff|pg||
nt|jbennet: many X instead; for 300 ; now they get 680 instead. (4NT was of course primarily 2 places to play. |pg||
nt|geot: should have been a stiff Q somewhere|pg||
nt|barnets: north may have problem on run of diamonds|pg||
nt|geot: Helness will come under pressure here|pg||
nt|fluffy: but versace would have to reject @c finese to run diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: he has to throw his hearts|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: as expected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  easy lead from the sequence :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|clinch: Will have to play a @h early now|pg||
nt|baldjean: still a little swing for Hungary, since it was not doubled at the other table. but not enough|pg||
nt|barnets: both teams still in contention|pg||
nt|pelu:  difficult for S not to play @C A - but in OR where East maded at trial-bid in 3@D u could find the @s-lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|geot: Italy, Bulgaria and Turkey|pg||
nt|barnets: so all specs should be happy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|geot: Myself I do not like 3@S the first time unless it is agreed to show some cards|pg||
nt|geot: I think it is too strong for 3@S initially|pg||
nt|geot: he must keep two spades two clubs and onlyone heart to set it|pg||
nt|fluffy: as long as helness keeps a low spade I think he is safe|pg||
nt|barnets: the south can win @SK and lead a club|pg||
nt|geot: so he can let Helgemo in to shoot a club through|pg||
nt|geot: oops Stereo, Barnet|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: he has to keep 2 spades|pg||
nt|fluffy: club finese risjs going down a lot|pg||
nt|barnets: @SA and another|pg||
nt|fluffy: board  13 big swing for Italy when the hearts were doubled too sonn|pg||
nt|barnets: I think west almost knows the layout of the hand|pg||
nt|geot: But Versace will probably take the club finesse? Isn't that by far the best chance anyway?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: very nice play from Fantoni|pg||
nt|psyck: Sementa will return @h after winning @d, maybe Piekarek will have an idea then|pg||
nt|april7: 8 of @D to makje sure:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: accurate defence|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was busy thinking maybe deWijs does better to play @DJ at trick 1|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe it will be too late then, he is still thinking how to play the @D|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, too difficult a hand, even when looking at all cards :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yapmak içen @cQ yerini bilmesi gerekiyordu|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama daha ilk turdan empas atmasý için bir sebep yoktu. normal oyun|pg||
nt|barnets: still a swing to Italy|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes, best chance, but risks -400|pg||
nt|barnets: if north had @SAK he may have led 1|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ferlema: http://csbnews.org/my-way-iv-by-norberto-bocchi/?lang=en|pg||
pc|sK|nt|james_h: I have to go now, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|clinch: As otherwise Forrester will get a @c ruff|pg||
nt|monde9: -1|pg||
nt|monde9: for 6 IMP's|pg||
nt|solex333: ok if k of h offside, a of @c onside and spades 4-1 or spades to dummy return spade and east ruff with 2 @s. but|pg||
pc|d2|nt|geot: but I dont think it can be right to let opps play 3@C on Souths hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: they move to the next board I guess|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller will think again -- but it is too late|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Nunes as dummy takes out a magazine to read|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from Italy, Monaco or Ireland??|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, lost play|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running score linkleri þu adreste|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I do not say that 1N is always making - but passing may still be good in the long run|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: no worries Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Magazine was Italian!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: lose a @D ruff one - if @c's 3/3 or JT drop it makes or if one defender has to guard hearts and clubs - so odds wise maybe low 40's slam - which is poor|pg||
nt|eyamut: battý|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: that was  said, lemme see....21 lines ago|pg||
nt|ritong: but great minds drink alike:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Good defence, and would have been supernatural to find the counter-play|pg||
nt|clinch: Before knowing the @s position|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcphee: it sure can|pg||

nt|barnets: tx to Tos oour operator and Peter and all specs bye to all and regards to scottidsh friends|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|james_h: My bridge suffers from real life and vice versa|pg||
nt|gulyas: no, its a push|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blum1956: Certainly he could try some 5th level invitation (the 5@d cue probably being the best) but the 5th level was not safe from Maxim Karpov's point of view|pg||

mb|2S|nt|baldfriede: yes, but as I said, S was afraid of @H, so he did not bid on|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks like a possibility for Bulgarians to shorten the gap|pg||

nt|barnets: 2@H good spade raise|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: no way lauria sits here|pg||

nt|nilsland:  1NT?|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double for takeout... East have for 3  maybe 4spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Ireland got a grip on this now, and fully deserved. they have not done anything wrong, and Norway has got a few hands where I do not really recognise my good friends to be honest|pg||
nt|geot: It is the first match only, do not worry Norwegian fans:)|pg||

nt|ritong: no, i naively thought fredin would keep quiet|pg||
nt|tez: assael köksoyun eliyle girmezdi araya|pg||

nt|april7: a double dummy 7@H but 6@H  very possible to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 1 lvl higher here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink was definitely operating on this hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes only a couple of hands had some potential, maybe we will end with a bang with some fancy hands|pg||

nt|star6ija: now 4 @ss|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@s might make ona non diamond lead, not very likelly o this table|pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@s makes with diamond too?|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry, on diamond pushes you can discard all hearts from dummy, so 4@s still makes|pg||
nt|star6ija: Aronov knows Stefanov has singleton @d|pg||
nt|geot: right|pg||
nt|sastro: endlich lassen auch die Russen ein paar Imps fallen|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: This might be a pick up for Norway|pg||
nt|gulyas: no dbl, no trouble:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: but there are still matches with more imps exchanged. some suprise is that pland is down 40 imps against Croatia|pg||
nt|clinch: Again, lots of bidding from NS|pg||
nt|monde9: -2 here another bad board for Romania|pg||
nt|jbennet: again this board shows that passivity so often creates double partscore swings.  |pg||
nt|barnets: e/w do well in hearts|pg||
nt|murat e: turkey trailing against austria and netherlands may take over third place seems thats all this match matters|pg||
pc|s9|nt|blum1956: 2NT is more challenging than 2@d in the OR and will probably fail|pg||
nt|clinch: Dbl presumably support; not sure what rdbl was|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: Poland has been doing surprisingly poor all rounds|pg||
nt|MolvaM: assael puanlý pik fiti gösteriyor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzey çabuk pes etti|pg||
nt|tez: kuzeyin 20 puanla pas geçmesi |pg||
nt|yusufb: kuzey 4@s olunca iþin pesini býraktý|pg||
nt|baardolav: He feel his cards is strong. If 3@s is defined as fight... then more difficult|pg||
nt|star6ija: correct|pg||
nt|baardolav: double can be invite from east|pg||
nt|murat e: threemore boards after this one|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcphee: very true|pg||
nt|geot: that was a tough double by Helgemo|pg||
nt|barnets: 14 more imps for Italy on bd 14|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm this looks good for italy|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@S a good save|pg||
nt|tomi2: except of their win against France|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Fredin may even make this with a club finess|pg||
nt|barnets: when fantunes X 4@H|pg||
nt|fluffy: on the last board of round 17 I decided against running my diamonds for something like this, jst to find out they had led from KJ985 with the 5, and now they had no comunication ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: when his partner had to play the queen from Q7632|pg||
nt|barnets: instead of taking the save we saw here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: yes Bessis probably wrote that up in BBO news|pg||
nt|tomi2: if they get kicked out a new discussion will start about the way the team gets selected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or without|pg||
nt|ritong: bar is open:)|pg||
nt|jbennet: they sold out to 2 sp and inflicted a well deserved part score swing. East of course will led high d follewd by a trump switch. |pg||
nt|barnets: still another swing for Italy coming here|pg||
nt|baldjean: declarer will try to set up @d|pg||
nt|geot: Another good one for Italy here. Not the right time to play on the 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|barnets: so 31 the lead now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|geot: At the other table Boye Brogeland made this hand simple when he overcalled 4@H over Hanlon's 1@C|pg||
nt|clinch: Good work from NS to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like this move from helness|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs to be on the ball to defeat this |pg||
nt|april7: 6@S is in danger, of losing 1 @S and 1 @H, but the @H losers could be discarded on long @D except on @C leads in lacking of entries to the @D suit, but as we see NS are on the way ...|pg||
nt|april7: to 6 @H|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|nilsland:  CocaCola someone?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes please|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, rum and a tiwst of lemon|pg||
nt|mcphee: E knows this one is a make|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has 6 losers|pg||
nt|barnets: east switched a heart at trick 2|pg||
nt|barnets: in open|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tomi2: Germany has made trials first time for 10 years, this team won earlier this year|pg||
nt|clinch: England has played very well against a strong French team (so far)|pg||
nt|fluffy: another line pointed by an spec is to pitch the heart on second/third diamond|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea's temperament ? 14 PH 1 NT opening ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cross to dummy, H finesse - not so easy for North |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: other room on their final board  [ 20]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does anybody know Kaplans rule for opening leads|pg||

nt|yusufb: bizimkilerde býrakmýþ iþin pesini 4 batýrmýþ iyi skor|pg||

nt|barnets: and that was a trick lost|pg||
nt|sastro: der kontrakt ist nicht zu schlagen|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: best shot is the @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: he would  have 9 tricks now, but the defense has 5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yusufb: 2 yada 3 imp alýrýz|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Stuck for a discard|pg||
nt|monde9: W squeezing his partner |pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: playing same boards  France v Iceland   score is 53-30    our match only 21 imps|pg||
nt|ritong: ok i bite  no?|pg||
nt|baldjean: if E takes his @c now it is down|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tez: 2 imp daha alýrýz|pg||
nt|fluffy: well guys I gotta go to the venue here and hopefully congratulate my team mates fo beating Ireland|pg||
nt|fluffy: see you|pg||
nt|geot: At the other table South doubled the 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks for being with us|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And the next heart vill hurt|pg||
nt|barnets: the tournament needs aresult like this to make it more exciting for the specs|pg||
nt|fluffy: even bigger would make it funnier I'd say|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|barnets: link for running scores|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: scores have Monaco making 2@H both ways on 11 for 9 imps so that must be wrong|pg||
nt|mcphee: Bakhshi not grabbing the A of trumps was a good move|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they fixed that quickly :)so Israel maintain a healthy lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: now poor Lauria is awakwardly placed|pg||
nt|murat e: England sittting comfortably at first place|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: adding spotcards?|pg||
nt|star6ija: precision... he doesn't know how many @d his partner has|pg||
nt|barnets: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oleberg:  But a club it must be|pg||
nt|mcphee: ducking?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is also a possible ethical problem for North, although it depends on how long S took to pass the double - we can't always tell the correct speed of the bids |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as the hesitation could only imply (given the srong dummy and the jump to 3NT) that South was thinking of bidding 2@s, and therefore has three spades   |pg||
nt|april7: on a trump lead 13 tricks coming in|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tomi2: while Poland has nominated a team consisting of two "strongest" pairs and a playing sponsor and his pd|pg||
nt|mcphee: nope|pg||
nt|april7: on a trmp lead though S could make the safety play in @S,protecting against a 1-4 split in @S, but with this lead has to rely ona 2-3 split|pg||
nt|april7: and ofcourse on a 3-2 split in @H|pg||
nt|april7: ace, then 2 trumps and 2 @S and claim|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOT REALLY|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzgn: Khokhlov thinking|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Lead your queens?|pg||
nt|geot: Yes, but X is an alternative with those cards anyway imo|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pauleger: talking about sponsors... :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: in Germany we had no trials but that was like in Italy, it was because there was no real doubt that the team playing is the strongest one|pg||
nt|geot: may easily be be some more imps on this one|pg||
pc|c5|nt|clinch: Despite the @h misguess, Gold can't put Forrester in to lead a trump without establishing a @d winner for declarer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in these auctions, it's not a bad idea to rasie with Q10x support |pg||
nt|mcphee: good recovery from E|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|geot: interesting lead, trying to find a stiff Q somewhere|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on vugraph he would say God gave you a long sequence so you knew what to lead|pg||
nt|clinch: So still 10 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: HE HAS THE ENTRY TO TAKE THE FINESSE|pg||
nt|roswolf: very good play|pg||
nt|mcphee: it was the J@S that was the concern|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5th place Israel are doing 2-4th every favour as the gap to Monaco closes|pg||
nt|mcphee: here i was thinking we had more Monaco supporters|pg||
nt|mcphee: they are my pick to win|pg||
pc|h3|nt|geot: Gave declarer a stopper|pg||
nt|blum1956: Rudakov-Khokhlov use standard leads against NT so it is not easy for Khokhlov to decode the sequence @c5 -@c4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|tez: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|geot: what a contract, phew|pg||
nt|roswolf: azurri v the anglos explains a lot:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes probably they are a great two pairs but not really Monacon's are they :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tomi2: Italy have a sponsor (Maria Lavazza) but she acts as a non playing captian|pg||
nt|star6ija: 1 IMP Italy|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Even though the spade was "into the jaw", it guarantees a two-trick set|pg||
nt|monde9: & now East ? :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Unless...|pg||
nt|gulyas: another one of those +6 turns to -5 hands|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes but don't expect to pick many on  16|pg||
nt|roswolf: should get this right in sleep|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d9|nt|monde9: good def & S could be more inspired |pg||
nt|monde9: Denmark is now very close|pg||

nt|april7: ace and then finess the J|pg||

nt|mcphee: 5@C only 1 off|pg||
nt|ritong: don t think tor can pass|pg||
nt|baldjean: the scoring is VP, right?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So a possible game swing for France if they can reach 4@h|pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 sp was a goos save. as it happned ew had 11 tricks possible in a heart partial. |pg||
nt|mcphee: well passing 1@H strikes me as timid|pg||
nt|roswolf: horror suit quality|pg||
nt|mcphee: options were basically 2@H or a t/o dble|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tomi2: in Lille the team will already have a sponsor playing instead of Lauria|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden is in 6NT here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@h got through on  14 - 12 imps to Denmark |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S is presuambly a Device |pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@S would have been my "warped"choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: As my fellow commentater disappeared i am alone here and supposed to be neutral. Difficult, and I am afraid my NZ flag will not help me hiding. Go Norway:)|pg||
nt|geot: N/S can win 12 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|gulyas: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|gulyas: for results and running scores|pg||
nt|blum1956: A paradox is that 4@s over Dubinin's possible immediate 4@h is more attractive than 3@s over 3@h|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@S the place to be|pg||
nt|tez: sanzatuyu kim oynayacak|pg||

nt|oleberg:  1NT = Gameforcing relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: And here we go!|pg||
nt|geot: At least they are in game now|pg||
nt|geot: Looks like Brogeland (East in the other room) have had a good time on the few last boards.|pg||
nt|geot: But mind you, Ireland is still leading this match:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C a game inv stayman|pg||
nt|blum1956: nothing may stop North from making 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think alfredo will invite|pg||
nt|geot: 12+12 HCPs N/S|pg||
nt|baardolav: this was a weak opening even for prec players|pg||
nt|monde9: Romania has now many regrets. The winning line of that 4 @H stuff was for me clear. But as usual, it is so easy when you see all the cards :)  |pg||
nt|mcphee: reasonable spot|pg||
nt|ritong: bessis senior likes his two aces|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, before bd17 was scored|pg||
mb|2C|nt|geot: or to be honest :(|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helness is lucky here|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: North has a nice hand here, but this time the opposition bidding should rightly dissuade him from overbidding|pg||
nt|MolvaM: almanya 7 karoya geldiði elde|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 6nt deklaresi çok uzun düþünce sonucu verildi|pg||
nt|mcphee: go to the back of the room geoffry|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tomi2: 15 has been finished in the OR, Piekarek made 8 tricks, 2 imps for Germany|pg||
nt|nilsland:  needs one trick extra - the hearts will provide it if you play careful|pg||
nt|ritong: although garozzo advocates 6Nt with 34 and no fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@D = 10-12 (13) and a minor-side-suit|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@H = relay|pg||
nt|oleberg:  (It was obviously East, not South, that bid 2@D|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3@D = 5-card diamonds|pg||
nt|monde9: 3 NT making in TOR is a good performance|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he's out of trouble now it's worked a treat|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this is optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: xx probably lacks a @C stop? not sure|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, so xx shows @Ds I am told|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, another help says no stop, no 4M|pg||
nt|gulyas: so maybe no @Ds shown yet|pg||

nt|ritong: not sure why?|pg||
nt|gulyas: make that 25-4, Hungary on the brink of elimination|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW play precision, so 2NT some sort of a maximum with long @Hs|pg||
nt|gulyas: maximum being 15hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: in this match it seems that the english have cause for cautious optimism|pg||
nt|mcphee: 5/0 trumps is going to sink this one|pg||
mb|3N|nt|geot: This will be 10 IMPs if South is not ....|pg||
nt|geot: and he is of course not|pg||
nt|psyck: wrong vul for NS to get into the auction at a high level to provide excitement|pg||
nt|geot: Amazing|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 2 kor pass or correct|pg||

nt|monde9: now the problems here on 4 @H|pg||
nt|gulyas: W likes his @HJ, so he is cuebidding I assume|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the best diamond stopper ever |pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: when there is no fit, i meant|pg||
nt|baardolav: And it steals the contract I belive. |pg||
nt|baardolav: very well...|pg||
nt|famus: k|pg||
nt|star6ija: 10-11 IMPs for Bulgarians|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: all right, so @Ds found after all|pg||
nt|gulyas: slam is decent, needs to catch an honor from N|pg||
nt|gulyas: but both are with S, so its doomed|pg||
nt|april7: not the worst lead for the defence, dec should try to ruff a @C in dummy|pg||
nt|baldjean: probably a small gain for France here|pg||
nt|geot:  E/W did well to avoid the 5-3 fit in spades on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: 6@D is of course a terrible slam, 5@D is a good game|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: dummy: I think you may need these...:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: dubinin too many primes to pass|pg||
nt|monde9: @S lead ?|pg||

pc|dT|nt|lechcold: w 16 kolejna strata|pg||
nt|lechcold: troszkê nam siê smutno robi, no ale to pierwsze koty...|pg||
nt|blum1956: Dubinin has a choice of 3NT and 4@s, but his hand is not of NT nature|pg||
nt|ritong: drumroll|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hakem kararý = 7@d tam. skor geçerli|pg||
nt|tez: 9 hazýr var..birde ataktan|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The double gives the trumf-stack away, but probaly not enough for the contract to make|pg||
nt|monde9: always -1 |pg||
nt|gulyas: now he wants to ask for the @HQ, but cannot|pg||
nt|fluffy: don't you love it when you see the 5-0 break and you are playing NT?|pg||
nt|chick: with the club finesse working, this will be easy, probably an overtrick|pg||
pc|d3|nt|geot: that is how it is, and it will be 10 IMPs whether he gets 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|clinch: On that leadd, though....|pg||
nt|clinch: Might still make...going to be tight|pg||
nt|gulyas: below 5@H, that is|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pauleger: lauria will take his 10 tricks I guess|pg||
nt|ritong: sigh|pg||

nt|fabsayc: now lauria will bid 6 based on those clubs, i think|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: losing 2@h, one @C ruff and the @SA, no guess unless N underleads the @S now|pg||
nt|monde9: maybe -2 some days :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm, so they end up in 6@S after all|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|nilsland:  It has come down to Lauria vs Upmark. Make you bets!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he only has 10 top tricks, so play is very complicated|pg||
nt|clinch: Needs to strip E of his @d s  then throw him in|pg||
nt|clinch: Also needed to play two trumps as now W can trump third @c|pg||
nt|clinch: Perhaps too double-dummy|pg||
nt|clinch: Of course E may think his partner has J @c|pg||
nt|clinch: So defence is not clear|pg||
nt|clinch: If W has QJ10 of @cs|pg||
nt|clinch: will not be right to play a third one|pg||

nt|gulyas: after a passive @C lead, he can set up @Hs easily|pg||
nt|geot: yes:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|baldfriede: percentage play in @s wrong this time, but that's why it is percentage only|pg||
nt|geot: Bulgaria in 3NT at the other table and win 600, and this table N/S do not take a bid at all. Very unusal against Italy|pg||
nt|geot: The opening was creating it, because who of N or S should bid?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 10 I belive  if Aronov maake -3 11 if -2|pg||
nt|tax456: ok. ma su 60 mani il carry over conta il 10%|pg||
nt|star6ija: Stefanov did it well here|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see how he plays it - running it gives the contract immediately|pg||
nt|sastro: der AS weiss noch nicht, dass er den Kontrakt nicht verlieren kann|pg||
pc|h3|nt|clinch: or, indeed, he may think Forrester has 4 @s|pg||

nt|nilsland:  not sure why I said that either - was distracted :P|pg||

nt|barnets: n/s for italy in open bid 3N|pg||
nt|murat e: gold and silver to england and france bronze swinging in the air netherlands and turkey try catching....|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: 2N was a strong hearts raise|pg||

nt|barnets: that is without hope|pg||
nt|barnets: and ill be 6 imps for Monaco|pg||
nt|fluffy: so 5 back to monaco|pg||
nt|fluffy: and board 16 they might pick up some back as well|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: went down in open room by not testing clubs immediately|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i expect lauria will figure this out|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think testing clubs first is better. keeps entries fluid and tells you how many extra tricks you beed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but is still not clear|pg||
nt|nilsland:  now its the time to play hearts - you "know" spades is offside|pg||
nt|oleberg:  -2 easily possible|pg||
nt|chick: declarer doesn't know the @SA is onside, so will worry about losing to the @SA in E and another diamond through|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||

nt|nilsland:  N can pitch after dummy so 1 down|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming south has not underled a jack vs 6NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am betting we see this hand in tomorrow's bulletin|pg||

nt|ritong: i guess lauria is already thinking something gross in italian:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or a double squeeze, but of course nothing works on actual hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so laurias line may not have been wrong, just unsuccesful|pg||
nt|clinch: Terribly tough to defend... sometimes double-dummy declrer play not necessary|pg||
nt|monde9: 2 boards|pg||
nt|gulyas: the good news is, Norway has overtaken Greece by half a VP|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two possible game swings there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, NS in the other room may reach 6@H, which doesn't quite fetch, I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|geot: some kind of come back for Norway in this match, and there are still 2 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: min NT again|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: they reversed this board in their haste - Mesbur is actually N for this hand|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2 chances left for some more action|pg||
nt|henryb:  except playing a heart to the ten after two rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bbo ile anlaþmamýza göre türkiyenin vugraf maçlarýnda kapalý oda yorumu türkçe yapýlacak þekilde|pg||
nt|monde9: 4 @S seems so cool but I saw that "major accident" happens sometimes|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes, it could be missed on a (very) bad day|pg||
nt|gulyas: the bad news is, we may end up behind both, and be eliminated|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kdr_fm: the @D lead on the previous board tempted declarer into playing the @C's 3/3 for a @d discard in which case the contract could be made so -2|pg||
nt|psyck: this is not easy|pg||
nt|pauleger: lauria will pass I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: straightforward game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: Very tight and nice match... |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not what West wanted to hear|pg||
nt|baldjean: this board was passed out at the other table|pg||
mb|1S|nt|geot: I said the previous won was mini mini as it on a bad day was 12 losers|pg||
nt|geot: but this one is even weaker in terms of HCPs|pg||
nt|psyck: pass may work as 4@h may go down|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden in 7 here - without success|pg||
nt|baardolav: 33 33... 3@h non vul preemtive style|pg||
nt|geot: I wonder how the weak 3@H bid is defined, if he may have something like KQ or AQ to six|pg||
nt|geot: or if that is too strong|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double ask if Bocchi have max|pg||
nt|oleberg:  My guess is, it would be bid 95% of the time (more or less)|pg||
nt|roswolf: rev drury i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, computer died for a while!|pg||
nt|clinch: Gold finally has a hand we'd all open|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iþte hizmet :) |pg||
nt|barnets: so e/w need come in at high level|pg||
mb|2H|nt|blum1956: With maximal hand they open 2@c instead of 1@d|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would have guessed @D wrong:(|pg||
nt|barnets: after the barrage|pg||
nt|barnets: can make game in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I hope we will not be playing that nice fit...|pg||
nt|gulyas: if Madala tries 3@D now, it would be the Italians for a change who declare the same contract in both rooms:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, we'd have opened his 21-count of course|pg||
nt|geot: Madala can not see many losers, but he will pass 4@H i think|pg||
nt|monde9: & the finishing match sometimes are tough :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: east nows for sure that west is void.|pg||
nt|fluffy: north can go contructive or preemptive, he went for constructive|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass missed out|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oops|pg||
nt|mcphee: 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|psyck: well 4@h can make too i suppose, esp as bidding marks cards|pg||
nt|psyck: making some endplay on North possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant nothing works after the heart pitch, we could all see how to make it|pg||
nt|baardolav: Madala scans the records... and try to estimate if Bocchi can have 2 hounours in @h now...|pg||
nt|geot: He goes on in the hope that the heart suit is stronger|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S is some form of a wk2, but S thinks this has play, and he is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: 6@c works fine here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitching anything but a heart on the third club gives up on various other chances|pg||
nt|clinch: on last hand|pg||
nt|sastro: möchte mal wissen, was der Partner mit seiner gepassten Hand alles haben soll damit mehr als 4 <<<<pik gehen- vielleicht noch 5, aber wo sollen denn 6 herkommen|pg||
mb|3S|nt|henryb:  But maybe playing a heart before playing the third club preserves some chances|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe 5@H could have been an alternative?|pg||
nt|monde9: now plus 1 costs some points |pg||
nt|jbennet: so 3NT cant work. |pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like 10 to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Not an easy job for Khokhlov who may see only the EW hands|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: again 3NT by E/W could come hope if the defence not careful - 4@H has no chance off 2|pg||
nt|nilsland:  running scores for this group http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=917&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|ritong: this type of auction will not exist anymore soon|pg||
nt|ritong: with gazzilli, etc|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcphee: @D lead best|pg||
nt|psyck: best would be to set up a @d ruff here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  At the other table South opened 1@C and thus was favourite to hold the @DK - so a little bit unlucky for sweden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room south opened so the grand odds were different than at this table, ie a bit unlucky the diamond king offside|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh maybe with this lead he is up to 11 without the trump guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Since trumps are 3-2 and clubs 3-3 the contract makes automatically|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not an unreasonable double. The opponents hands fit miracolously|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, may survive - depends on the way E plays the diamonds|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S by S, but an unaccessable dummy, now going even 2 down|pg||
nt|barnets: very nicely done e/w|pg||
nt|jbennet: wd east..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Open Room just finished play|pg||
nt|fluffy: wonder what redouble showed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: y, but not exactly a claimer:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: with @sA wellplaced|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps easts 4N suggested a slam try i diamonds  in case west was much stronger|pg||
nt|barnets: west about minimum for bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: so what about the 3spade bid (many uses that to show "i have 4 suoort plus minimum"|pg||
nt|barnets: the xx is a psychic manouver by north|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: well we covered that :)|pg||
nt|polpkeeper: dì a wald di mandare anche a te programma dirette bbo su tua mail|pg||
nt|polpkeeper: sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: there is an hallucinant bid, other room|pg||
nt|ritong: bocchi's double of 4@h|pg||
nt|clinch: I think 2@d confirmed a 17-19 balanced hand in N|pg||
nt|geot: On a diamond lead declarer must fly ace and cash three rounds of clubs to win|pg||
nt|geot: 3-3 clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|geot: South opened in this room with 8HCP, mini NT. In the other room North opened the bidding in third seat with 9HCPs :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: coming up on final board of the match|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is tricky even now|pg||
nt|monde9: if Coldea doesn't try a finesse in @S|pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps behaving, this is 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|sastro: soll mal vorsichtig spielen, damit er 4 erfüllt|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gulyas: if left to his own devices, declarer will go down|pg||
nt|jbennet: theory says that t is effective to use 3sp as a "preempt" (4 support but minimum."|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|clinch: As 1@c could have been a number of weaker hands|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|baldfriede: well done to find 6@c|pg||
nt|psyck: duly done|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bbodaki en yüksek nüfusa sahip ülkelerden biri olmamýzýn avantajý olsa gerek bu|pg||
nt|baldjean: this will be a quick claim|pg||

pc|cA|nt|gulyas: well, he was not|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well actually on that lead it maybe possible to set up the 4th @D (duck the @S entry to the N hand)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  He wont|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We expect 2 down - or more?|pg||

nt|geot: East must switch to a diamond now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|gulyas: he may still go down if S, upon winning the @HK, plays the @DQ for N to discard his @H|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs to play 2 rnds of @Hs eventually to ruff the 3rd|pg||
nt|gulyas: so either @HA-Q, or just Q, S wins and plays the @DQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: is no duck N has a certain @s entry ...|pg||
nt|star6ija: now @d switch will make it very tough|pg||
nt|oleberg:  That would make his handling of heart-losers to troublesome|pg||
nt|geot: Nunes in 3NT bd 16 and got a spade lead! where Helness led the @HK|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s8|nt|oleberg:  Taking the @SK and running clubs virtually guarantees ten tricks|pg||
nt|fluffy: did East really bid 4NT with 5 high?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|baardolav: three round of cllubs and crossruff|pg||

nt|oleberg:  The double gained a trick :)|pg||
nt|monde9: Players are tired after all that boards |pg||
nt|mcphee: e/w hold the record for 3 down in one set:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, and a push|pg||
nt|gulyas: final board of the match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board here - thanks to our operator - excellent job |pg||
nt|pelu:  oh a 50-50 bet Barnet :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice surprise for dutch fans :)|pg||
nt|barnets: are you sure down 1 ?|pg||
nt|fluffy: must be pick a minor then|pg||
nt|roswolf: last bd coming up|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Bob and Geoffrey for your great commentary|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh no Geoffrey|pg||
nt|mcphee: I just got a flash fro a spec|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great effort this by England :)|pg||
nt|chick: last board, with 3 to compare, so this isn't over yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: last hand now, thanks everybody, restart in about 1 hour and 15 minutes|pg||
nt|baardolav: 140 ew par score... |pg||
nt|gulyas: Ireland making a partscore, this may be duplicated here|pg||
nt|barnets: he can make it on spade lead but will he ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: letztes Board, morgen warten Frankreich, Polen und Monaco, wieder drei dicke Brocken, dafür können davon ausgehen, dass die Jungs wieder im Vugraph gezeigt werden|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: england gains lead in B I think if they push this one|pg||
nt|oleberg:  They virtually had a day off yesterday|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@C forcing  14+ hcp, 4+@C or 15+ bal, 2+@C|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt works here for E/W, but if N interferes it may not be found|pg||
nt|blum1956: This probably ends with 4@h N|pg||
nt|tomi2: cards could not be friendlier, I think 6@H could make if they bid it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden EW stopped in 3@S |pg||
nt|MolvaM: yorumlarýyla bizi aydýnlatan nafiz zorlu, tezcan þen, yusuf sohtorik e çok teþekkürler|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bizi izleyen siz sevgili seyircilerimize de çok teþekkürler|pg||
nt|oleberg:  1nt = 12-15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it will be interesting to see what the other table does with 17, 18, and 19|pg||
nt|fluffy: the incredible club lay out makes 5@c the making contract|pg||
nt|geot: Nunes went one down on bd 16 (3NT), 7 IMPs to Monaco|pg||
nt|sastro: letzte Hand - ich danke allen Zuschauern und insbesondere unserem Operator. Der russischen Mannschaft herzlichen Glückwunsch zum Sieg|pg||
nt|mcphee: bidding misunderstand this hand for England|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1100 was result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: which bd???|pg||
nt|mcphee: this one:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: just kidding|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanie|pg||
nt|roswolf: aaaaahhhhhhhhh not good for my nerves when england are playing:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could end up in a bloodbath|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: selamm levent bolþanss|pg||
nt|star6ija: non-forcing|pg||
nt|monde9: 3 NT on South ? :)|pg||
nt|april7: a trial bid by N and then 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: OK, Hungary scored up the normal 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as score reflects -- this has been a very tight battle|pg||
nt|tomi2: @SK doubleton onside, clubs 4-4, hearts 2-2|pg||
nt|psyck: see, i told you cards will slowly get exciting towards the end :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S = any shortnes, weak or strong|pg||
nt|ozgull: önemli maçlarýmýzdan biri üstgruba skorumuz taþýnacaðý için kazanmak önemli umarýmson bord birþey olmaz 18 çok iyi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iyi oynayan millilerimize de|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks to our excellent operator MArtin|pg||
nt|mcphee: not overly fond of this t/o dble frankly|pg||
nt|roswolf: what was 1@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@s=any spl 5-8 or 12-14|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmmmmmm|pg||
nt|tomi2: their notes say 4m = minor void|pg||
nt|tomi2: so I would think this bid would show @C void and no @D void in north|pg||
nt|pauleger: S won´t believe the @c void :)|pg||
nt|clinch: It's been good bridge, I think - not obviously swingy hands, but England have handled them very well|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@d is some form of multi?|pg||
nt|fluffy: ahh 18-19 balanced mexican |pg||
pc|h7|nt|gulyas: 4@S is not a good save|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that was somewhat keen by E, considering he has no @h stoppers|pg||
nt|clinch: To hold France to less than 2 IMPs per board is very well done|pg||
nt|tez: 2d yý 18 19 dengeli oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet cýkacak olan takýmlardan alýnan puanlar onemli 18 iyi skor|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Fitting reply from partner|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3-3-2-5 not so fitting|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not doubled any of those occasions|pg||
nt|murat e: on 17 austria went down on dia slam turkey back to third place|pg||
pc|h3|nt|geot: Good result by E/W in the OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: but they have sequences where "first step = high shortnes, 2nd step = lowest shortnes" could apply. Hope they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|nemeo: sorry sorry private :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The only way not to be in a 8-card fit|pg||
nt|monde9: a X from Coldea ? |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes confirmed|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: confirmed down one|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm serendipity!?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|geot: But fairly normal as long as West get heart support |pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D means @Hs I assume, so why no supp x? interesting|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so NS play no supp x-s|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2 dwn is likely here |pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@c X is -200|pg||
nt|nemeo: a me questa foto piace molto di più, l'altra molto meno (diciamo che qui mi riconosco mentre nell'altra ho la solita faccia di quando devo sorridere per forza), mi chiedevo solo ...|pg||
nt|nemeo: quale può andare meglio per lo scopo che interessa...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Par score is 140 EW|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@s|pg||
nt|baardolav: The result from OR|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Still, getting out of 1nt is going to be fine|pg||
nt|monde9: His temperament was calm than :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  X would probably have been take-out|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: low from worthless doubleton is the system lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Gromov must be most accurate to make this|pg||
nt|mcphee: all on the @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: thank you|pg||
nt|ozgull: herkese iyi günler iyidilekleriniz  bizle olsun|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gulyas: I wonder how they will find this fit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bugün baþka maç yok|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt oluyor|pg||
nt|gulyas: E 'nevergiveup' Fitzgibbon bids one more|pg||
nt|mcphee: here was Lauria trying to help them avoid @H and no one beleived him except Versace:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks very odd|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the double was awful really|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psyck: yes, this is what the notes say: If OPENER bids 2M over 2M-1, RESP can continue with 2NT asking, showing a side suit or  a splinter.|pg||
nt|april7: W hsould have already opened 3@H, and now NS were kept out of 4@S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: the answer is: they don't|pg||
nt|2celik1: .|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots of chatter over this hand from the specs|pg||
nt|mcphee: play on @D which cuold lead to going down|pg||
nt|blum1956: if there is a trump loser then the diamond guess is inevitable, from Gromov's point of view... Also, he does not know that the diamond ruff is possible...|pg||
nt|mcphee: or trump a @S on dummy to take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: i prefer the @S ruff to try trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: we can see from up here he could just bang down A@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: but I think that is unlikely|pg||
nt|blum1956: playing a diamond to the King creates one more problem - the 4th diamond in dummy...|pg||
nt|2celik1: @d atagina oyuncu dogru koyup koz empasi yapmazsa dahi olabiliyor|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even Gromov will not be quick in declaring this|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Thanks to his fast play earlier he has nearly an hour to decide on his line|pg||
nt|mcphee: one @D can go on J@C|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not many pairs would copy that bidding|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4 card @S invite|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|geot: So most likely a push, and this ends as a small win for Ireland|pg||
nt|kamyk: tu siê nic wielkiego nie stanie; dziekujê i dobranoc|pg||
nt|lechcold: do zobaczenia:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: This should go down in the 6th trick|pg||
nt|blum1956: Suppose he plays a diamond to the Queen now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 4@S is plain and simple an overbid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yarýnki 3 maçtan hangisinin yayýnlanacaðý akþam belli oluyor|pg||
nt|tez: @c dam 3lü|pg||
nt|geot: Noone will double 4@C here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: E has taken a bit of a view here, not supporting spades|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: Nunes would also lead @C3 from  @CQ73|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 9 tricks may come from 4@S, 3@C 1@D & 1@H.  But N/S at that point should be able to cash 1C 2@d + 2@H - I don't see this making|pg||
nt|baardolav: Now probably Italy will win with 1 imp...|pg||
nt|star6ija: or with 7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|clinch: Good lead; makes 4 on a @s lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bana iletiliyor ve ben de TBF web sayfasýnda yayýnlanmasý için bildiriyorum|pg||
nt|gulyas: this can be beaten by playing trumps|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tomi2: 3NT is defined as @S void, so 4@C could be @D void and 4@D club void|pg||
nt|psyck: guess they knew what they were doing anyway|pg||
nt|pauleger: everybody knows the situation holding 2 aces against a bid slam :)|pg||
nt|pauleger: most of the time it is bad to lead one of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: N and E are sitting on the same screen side, so if N thinks his bidding shows @D void he will tell this to Lauria|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|gulyas: just like that, yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 18 the english are in 3@H - GO ENGLAND:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|clinch: Less than 1 IMP per board of course|pg||
nt|tez: diðer masada 1 nt oynanýyor|pg||
nt|baardolav: Can be 2 down... |pg||
nt|geot: He is more likely to go 2 down than winning this|pg||
nt|mcphee: or weakish?|pg||
nt|baldjean: I like that Irish spirit. too bad it did not help in the European soccer championships|pg||
nt|mcphee: S had the problem of dble likely having a meaning other than we belong in @H not them|pg||
nt|mcphee: but this should handle ok really|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this seems to be cold|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Iceland lead Bulgaria 62-ZERO|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: it may be that east bid 1@d (transfer) and not 1@h a spec suggests|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: versace has the worst possible diamond holding after the double|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and 3@S prob making in other room will be 8 imps to sweden|pg||
nt|star6ija: right|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Declarer doesn't really want to play any suits|pg||
nt|monde9: it's depending on agreements|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like  swing for netherlands on last board|pg||
nt|barnets: with Italy too high|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gulyas: as long as the director lets the OR score stand, this is a huge gain for Hungary|pg||
nt|mcphee: so down he goesa|pg||
nt|tomi2: this would be a problem if the opening lead was on the other side and south would explain "i dont know what this shows"|pg||
nt|nilsland:  thanks for watching|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room defended very well but 1 down for "sure"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: on first card by dummy it was overturned too quickly to be sure but wont by ew|pg||
nt|barnets: good shot by west|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: this hand so far ok|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|geot: I expect both these teams to be in the fight in this Championship, for top 6, but maybe also possibly for medals if they are at their best. Good luck!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: been informed the other room result is incorrect - 3NT -1 whch given Tom + Hugh's record of bdding vul games would be more consistent|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yani www.tbricfed.org.tr adresini takip ediniz|pg||
pc|h2|nt|geot: so this will decide the match. 9 tricks = Italy wins, 8 tricks= BUL wins|pg||
nt|star6ija: but this is still 15-15|pg||
nt|geot: I put my money on Bulgaria here|pg||
nt|baardolav: If Bocchi start with AK heart... and heart for ruff... it is easy for stefanov to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|geot: it will likely be 15-15 anyway, but the imps:)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @D jack shows @d ratherthan @h|pg||
nt|szeryf: Muller spasowa³ z rêk¹ S na otwarciu! graj¹ 1 kiera|pg||
nt|star6ija: @S Jack|pg||
nt|baardolav: I think bocchi start with @d 8|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well, if we could bet, I'd bet you a beer their agreement is take-out|pg||
nt|april7: experiments|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that makes sense|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fluffy: well was a very good match to watch, thx everybody and hope you didn't criticize much the nonsense I said|pg||
nt|fluffy: cheers|pg||
nt|geot: Monaco will most likely lose bd 18, so Italy seems to win this match in the 19-11 or 20-10 area|pg||
nt|geot: Tks for watching, and tks to kibs for many good comments:) See you later|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: thats what I like to use,|pg||
nt|mcphee: it works well|pg||
nt|fluffy: @hJ endplays east I think|pg||
nt|barnets: in 3n i am told south had the @H9 left so north was able to reach him with tat card|pg||
nt|barnets: hd he ducked the heart switch he would have made it for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks specs for the info|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: most of us like our partners to support with 5-card support :) |pg||
pc|s7|nt|yusufb: cok sanslý 3nt @h AKQ sýrtta J kurtuluyor @c dede QXX empasta|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all. A quiet start, but it got swingy towards the end. |pg||
nt|barnets: now just down 1|pg||
nt|bobholl: i hope my sure comes true :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcphee: i had a few specs suggest @D was best|pg||
nt|mcphee: by golly he is going to make 3 I think|pg||
nt|nilsland:  @H to J and @D now?|pg||
nt|gulyas: so this only a 1imp loss|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|geot: I do not think the defence should take the diamond ruff, then nine tricks|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: for all specs who were asking -- this is why Fantoni didn't need to continue @C immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- if Nunes original trump was @D9xx  then    oops|pg||
nt|jkotor: ruff high, play low @d, and makes|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this is making now I think - the defence dont have the 2nd @d trick|pg||
nt|tez: son bord kazasýz|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|gulyas: 1@D showed @Hs, was not alerted by the operator|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hepinize çok çok teþekkür|pg||
nt|begse: çok iyi bu sonuçta elinize saglýk arkadaslar|pg||
nt|tez: bakarsýn @c empas atar imp kazanýrýz|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Vigorous discussion between Madala and Bocchi during and after that hand.|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so Italy wins by 2 imps, thats 16-14? maybe 15-15|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, 15-15 I am told - now we just need the declarer's decision on this bd from the OR to get the final result|pg||
nt|gulyas: next round starts in abt 25mins (17:40 CET)|pg||
nt|gulyas: the format is a double round robin: first, 2 groups play a RR for abt a week (17 rnds)|pg||
nt|gulyas: then the top 9 teams from both groups advance to RR2|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they play each other, but taking the results from the advancing teams along, only playing the other 9 teams|pg||
nt|gulyas: final result is determined by total VPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, the result shows online as here, so I assume that means the director let the score stand, Italy may appeal|pg||
nt|gulyas: small correction from Roland: 18 rnds, including a bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the final result is 15-15, appeal pending (maybe)|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly an entertaining match, come see us again in 20 mins for rnd3|pg||
nt|gulyas: made the 4@H call easy after the reopen|pg||
nt|clinch: So this looks to be a flat board... thanks everyone for bearing with me - see you tomorrow!|pg||
nt|geot: easy way is to take the diamond ruff for one down|pg||
nt|geot: He must NOT take the ace and switch to a heart|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psyck: anything that could work, works, @s Kx, @h22, @c44, etc.|pg||
nt|gulyas: 8-10th place very close, but Hungary having the easiest opps, Portugal, have a chance|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 imps for 3@H geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|blum1956: That was the last board of the set. Thanks all, the spectators and the vugraph operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Thank you Michael|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well either way thats a swing to sweden|pg||
nt|psyck: bye folks|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: thx all|pg||
nt|april7: now Ireland have a chnace to win the match|pg||
pc|s4|nt|blum1956: unfortunately this misguess ended up his chances|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Looks like declarer will get two more tricks, for a 3 imp gain|pg||
nt|monde9: not now|pg||
nt|monde9: no gain here|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right -- no extra @C for trump promotion|pg||
nt|mcphee: y|pg||
nt|mcphee: a good set from Estonia|pg||
nt|mcphee: thanks for watching|pg||
nt|blum1956: Well, this was the last board of the set. Thank you, Bob. Thanks to the spectators as well.|pg||
