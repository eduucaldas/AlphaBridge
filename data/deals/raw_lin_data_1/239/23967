nt|tomi2: Smirnov could have rebid 2@S if he had 4 cards even with no extra strength, so 2@S in their methods is value-showing, first of all looking for a @D stopper for NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sharkey: Monaco bid the slam on Bd 1 - 11 IMPs|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 5@d on EW if W can find @cQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here since 1nt is usually based on clubs, it makes sense to use 2@C by south for majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good thing i guessed instead of bet|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ralfwil: an easy way to find it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 5@h is too expensive -3|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to pick a lead - @H it A makes - otherwise may finesse N for @CQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: but a nice point by a spec, if Lorenzini tried a @D to the ten and north returned a @D his partner with all high hearts and the guard in @C would be squeezed on the last round of ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: wow west must re-open imo|pg||
mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: upmark has a tough decision here, his partners 2@C vulnerable very light|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2: klick on "open final" or the competition you are interested for the running scores|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: even with the disaster on the slam hand   Monaco still leads the field by over 1 match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 30-vp scale   maximum win is 25 vp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Tomi -- what do you think about Piekarek's action of  just 1@H and PASS over 3@H?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Helgemo's 5@D really put the pressure on NS|pg||
mb|5H|nt|arvidsson: always a challenge playing on 4-3|pg||
nt|tomi2: if double would not be something artifical (e.g. don't lead my suit), this hand looks fine for a double to invite partner to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|tomi2: now they had to make the decsion two levels higher|pg||
nt|tomi2: but it looks like two losers only|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: sure,  Hirst was very suitable,|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i have no idea how Smirnov found 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: declarer only have 4 certain tricks and needs to get 4 more, 1 can easily come from ruffing a @H|pg||
nt|tomi2: their doubles on seriously bid contracts are not 100% penalty. Piekareks would not double on 5 bad hearts and just three potential tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|vasmar: Here 4@H + 1 for E-W in Open room|pg||
nt|panosk: i was going to say only matter here how many overtricks|pg||
nt|panosk: in 4@H too|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Thank you vasmar..|pg||
nt|arvidsson: N makes a takout double and A might transfer it to penelty|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: 2@S= is @S + a minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzgq: 20 minutes remaining..|pg||
nt|monde9: with that lead 4 @H plus 2|pg||
nt|vasmar: Declarer found @HQ after South's overcall|pg||
nt|monde9: 1 more point for Greece|pg||
nt|arvidsson: defence can not glitch since then this contract might make |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: currently 4 or 5 matches 21 to 9|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ther is 2@S tricks 1@D @H and 1@C +either an extra @S or @C trick to take for the defence |pg||
nt|arvidsson: the question is wther the will find it, declarer might have some guessing to do aswell (in @D and so on)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panosk: if he finds trumps :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||

nt|vasmar: now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Lost play. Contract just made, Doxiadis apologised to partner...|pg||
nt|arvidsson: declarer must be pretty certain @S behaves badly|pg||
nt|arvidsson: and might go for @HA !@H ruff and @C to A @D J @C discard|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||

mb|d|nt|panosk: seriously for me is 1 of 2 thoughest tournaments in the world |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 3+fit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|monde9: 6 @D can be made here with some guessing|pg||
nt|vasmar: 5@D is safer|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: Mr. Ekren gave up his own convention, draw your own conclusions|pg||
mb|3S|nt|arvidsson: a Kibitzer informed me that @C is the suit to play for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|monde9: but not a good contract|pg||
nt|vasmar: than 3NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|panosk: just in @D is enough|pg||

nt|tomi2: let's have a quick look at the other results, Israel winning against Monaco but not very high, England has beaten Italy. Netherlands took 24... atm Italy is out of the Medals... ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: Germany 7th with some 3VP to the 6th Poland, France, Sweden and Russia follow but they are all 8VP behind Germany|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzgq: asking about leads|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s9|nt|arvidsson: not much to hope for will be 1 off if EW cash ther @D |pg||

nt|pisoy: or @H to the 9|pg||
nt|monde9: now every trick is for one down |pg||
nt|pisoy: or @H to the J|pg||
