pc|h2|nt|ady: west has done well as it goes   3 diamonds down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: gromov asks lavinthal or count and discussion ensues|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Helness tried 3NT in the other room, but the @C lead meant defence gets 4@C 1@S before you can get 9th|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ryskiel_: teraz dopiero 3@c?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: slam depends on bringing in the @Cs for the loss of 1 trick... not there|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: actually if East had bid 6@H on a transfer seq then South might have led a nat @CK|pg||
nt|murat e: maybe he can try for elimination clubs were not led|pg||

nt|hawe45:  DidÂ´nt @S 8 show an even number?|pg||
nt|murat e: left 3nt behind now 5 dia maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: or a small @H by N?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes if you don't use ligthner now|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: unless S take first heart with ace as one of the specs poitned out|pg||
nt|runnerup:  reverse ligthner|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i bet 6@C made|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how can he find @H lead|pg||
nt|patricck: On a spade switch declarer has to lead the right way in hearts|pg||
nt|patricck: or guess to finesse after the spade ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s switch now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: if he plays the @S as ak (no finesse) he makes but he won't i fear|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No hurry, North|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: North is O.Herbst |pg||
nt|mamos:  i think 8 showed even yes|pg||

nt|murat e: things mixed up it seems|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  If North had ducked, 9 tricks wer possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and still possible. Maybe South will regret his @d-discard|pg||
nt|mamos:  although declarer surely likely to play South for @dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N thinking|pg||
nt|mamos:  i dont understand why  South didnt discard Spade to give count|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Would 4 diamonds to the Queen really be your first discard-choice?|pg||
nt|mamos:  no I agree but surely more @d length in South might even imagine 5 wirth @c 4-0|pg||
nt|mamos: this wont make|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|blum1956: In fact, it is hard to bid 3NT, but it makes as EW cannot take both a club and an extra diamond trick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but who will lead a @H small in dummy against 6@C?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm |pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes indeed IF 6@C @H2 lead and @H4 in dummy one can make 6@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but very DD story imo|pg||
nt|mamos: i agree jaap|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @c looked making -and this -no chance so strange 6nt |pg||
nt|andyv:  that play takes a lot of nerve|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer has to play well to make 5 dia after heart lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzgq: I lost play ù|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Its been suggested the 1@S shows 0-3@S and no @H stop, can someone confirm|pg||
nt|skaftij: In OR, 1NT showed 14-16, so impossible for Jonsson-Baldursson to stop short of game|pg||
nt|barnets: if dec leads clubs nort should win the ace and clear hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: dec should of course then test spades first|pg||
nt|barnets: @CJ low low @CA|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spade switch is more likely|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jaapfr: pls check other tables if 6@C was made or down (imo 50% will make it)|pg||
nt|jbgood: if I remember correctly the rebid of 2@h in the CR shows a 18-20 balanced (or so)|pg||

nt|murat e: west following all the way|pg||
nt|murat e: birmans double must have shown him the way|pg||
nt|tweety1: thinking to play @s or @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: also checking his score card while thinking|pg||
nt|murat e: if birman switches to spades now one of dummys entries have taken away so declarer has to follow another line with club ace still in hand but that defence is unlikely|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|murat e: EW bidding kept NS low here|pg||
nt|murat e: hi arttu|pg||
nt|arderi:  About the previous board. KoistinenÂ´s first discard was @s 2 which telling about club values. So Nyberg thought he can throw away a club|pg||
nt|panosk: anyway it will be a push most probably|pg||

nt|patricck: on a small spade lead West will want to play AK when East has Jxxx and declarer Qx|pg||
nt|andyv:  on opening lead, small @s (some would play the 10@s to start the unblock) is fine.  Here where you are pretty sure you need to collect 4@s tricks, the Q@s is best|pg||

nt|jbgood: Hoftaniska went wrong in 3 NT on   6 and lost to the heart queen for the downer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rosencranz DBL = A, K or Q in partner's suit    most play with Hx  [otherwise raise]  but that varies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the idea is to help overcaller with opening lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: others would play this RDBL as Snapdragon - showing the 4th suit [assume RHO has @H] and tolerance for the overcalled suit|pg||

pc|sA|nt|mamos:  Spade lead makes 4-1 trumps less likely I suppose|pg||
nt|arderi:  Now need to guess clubs after @h continuation|pg||
nt|arderi:  Maybe only reasonable play is @c 10|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Ca marked with West... so he can ruff with King|pg||

nt|jkotor: o, mam g³os...|pg||
nt|400 volt: that was not the best idea ever|pg||
nt|400 volt: This 1NT overcalls shows a 4card major and a 5+ card minor|pg||
nt|400 volt: 8-17 hcp in general|pg||
nt|400 volt: obviously east upgraded because he had 6@C and @C 1098 and @S 10|pg||
nt|roswolf: the norsemen in the other room did well for team Monaco|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c finesse was forced.  Declarer needed K@c to be in N hand...otherwise S would get in and push a @h thru before the @d pitch|pg||
nt|tweety1: 5 @c good save|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice game but not for the netherlands :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he upgraded that???   1@C=any 16+ hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 @H - ???|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@h looks like a fit jump|pg||
nt|barnets: but n/s cant make game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: back|pg||
nt|400 volt: 6@H is 1 down, @H A and @C K to lose, even after @S j lead by east |pg||
nt|mamos:  and because he was breathing ?:)|pg||
nt|400 volt: it's even 2 down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|400 volt: west will soon be surprised that his partner has the @S-suit, 2@D probably asks for the major |pg||
nt|arderi:  1@c is special bid: 12-16 any unbal hand or 15-17NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  5+ @H and 4+ @C - IÂ´m told|pg||
nt|roswolf: north mustnt try for a penalty at a low level - 5@C is about right imo|pg||
nt|skaftij: 14+ (good 12/13) 4+ clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|barnets: def lead 2 top clubs|pg||

nt|mathat: den mporei|pg||
nt|zlatan: anyway @s could be 3-3, not a good probability, but ssome days everything is right for you|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos:  low scoring in most matches over these first few boards - these two teams lead in Group A  but scores are very closely bunched as we  would expect|pg||
nt|patricck: The Hungarian East switched to a small @S on board 5 just the same as this room. I fear that I would have failed the test as well, but I agree leading the Q@S is better|pg||
nt|barnets: to finesse the spade|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tomi2: did Fisher play the 13th @D to promote a trump trick?|pg||

nt|ady: west can overtake club with the ace   defence may be tested|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact, with this dummy, if North has the @C Ace, he can do nothing but play it. |pg||
nt|mamos:  ah   wont East have Spade trick or Spade exit|pg||
nt|ady: as said still only 8 tricks with an end play|pg||
nt|skaftij: 2@s, sry pard for bidding a 4 card suit :-)|pg||
nt|patricck: While declarer can still make on a @C switch it doesn't seem likely he would play for exactly this layout and spurn the 50% chance of a club finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  now it's more difficult...he needed to lead a @h at trick 2 so that his timing would be better (he could ruff a 3rd @h after only one round of @cs were played to see if suit broke)|pg||
nt|patricck: Still just 1-0 after 6 comparisons, but I think there could be a swing on board 7|pg||
nt|barnets: In 3N duck a hear win the heart lose a diamond to East then cash clubs and run the @S8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is coolest part of KnR tool -- let's you see how small changes to a hand can have huge impact on value|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos:  oor|pg||
nt|mamos:  Germany picking up imps regularly|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer isn't aware that, with E holding only 2 @cs and the A of @d, his contract is safe if he simply attacks the @h suit.|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tomi2: a bit lucky that this -4 is a) not doubled and b) 4@S is not making, but it will still be expensive|pg||

nt|yanivz: hi|pg||
nt|400 volt: otherwise if east holds @S 10983 he could have played the @S 9, too|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C was the second|pg||

nt|roswolf: this should be flat|pg||

nt|petergill: on Bd 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: when I was on board 8 I accidently clicked redeal and this blocks the scoring system|pg||

nt|ahollan1: PASS denies @C control??    but didn't 4N imply one???    can we please go back and bid 5@D instead of 4N|pg||

nt|petergill: We know as much as you about the bidding after 3@S = not much. Not sure why Dubinin bid 4@H instead of 3NT. an untidy auction on a difficult hand to bid?|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps South took 3@S as minors, and bid 4@H natural, then 4NT was "pick a minor" |pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: after 1@C  Brink overcalled 1@S and that was end of NS involvement|pg||

nt|barnets: playing south for the @DQ loses one of these chances|pg||
nt|barnets: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C is less intersting than 4@S|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|jaapfr: the one S has @CQ9x|pg||
nt|andyv:  S really doesn't have enough to make a slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: afraid I am all out of chocolate and water |pg||
nt|pelu:  playing 2@S in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Next board, pls|pg||
nt|arderi:  3@s now.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true. now punt 3nt|pg||
nt|djneill:  X = Colors, 1@d = Rank, 1N = shape(d) suits|pg||
nt|petergill: 800 on best defence (trump lead) in 4@SX I think|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Finally a small gain for Iceland|pg||
nt|mamos: oooh undo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N passes|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, it is close though isn't it, and he probably wants to generate a swing after just going for 1100 and this being such an important match for them|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 NT forcing - but Broge may go low since prd surely have something wasted in hearts|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: will surely invite slam|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I  think Nybo is showing 3-6 in majors. Now there is probably one invitation for @H and one for @S|pg||
nt|pelu:  RD + Pass = F1|pg||
nt|barnets: that seems undercooked|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lechcold: 2BA mocne (naci¹gniête troszkê)...3@S = powiedz 3N|pg||
nt|ady: likely 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos:  5@c much better than  3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - only 26 HCP...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S tranfers from Stayman to game force RELAY|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   2@S=5@S 4@H, INV, can be light|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H would have been the relay|pg||
nt|bobholl: probably 1nt is also kind of psych :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|arderi:  ok|pg||
nt|arderi:  Can NS pass this one :)|pg||
nt|mamos: @cK looks normal|pg||
nt|andyv:  he may be feeling some pressure due to the result on board 13 although that should not have an influence|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: This is for spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|arderi:  Nyberg is thinking he has promised much more than he has|pg||
nt|barnets: I think 4@S would make also on 3 rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: dec can ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: cash @SK|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: the israeli security man turned up to check |pg||
nt|barnets: play a club and give south his trump trick|pg||
nt|pelu:  some has to help our hard working operator: send help to Eamon :)|pg||
nt|barnets: returning with the @HA to draw trumps|pg||
nt|panosk: you can see thewhole bidding in Open Room (OR) by putting your mouse over the result announce, just below West's cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: I'm sure it doesn't have an influence.... in the Vulcan championships...... but here on Earth sometimes our emotions get the better of us|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...one of Bob Hamman's great strength is he can completely forget the previous board and focus on the board in front of him.  We all try to do that...sometimes we fall short.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Norway is now 11th - 12 VPs behind Greece in 9th - Greece demolishing Turkey - a big surprice|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Even if Norway qualify to the next step they will not be able to achieve a decent result at the end after three heavy losses against Israel, Germany and Hungary|pg||
nt|jbgood: hope Brogeland will pass - even th as you say Peter, a very good slam|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I think he will because he relies on his partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: my granny always said you must play the Ace when there is a singleton K offside|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lechcold: 3@S mog³o zawieraæ te¿ silne rêce (zwykle na m³odszych) z którymi Grzegorz by kontynuowa³ po 3N |pg||
nt|ady: could be 12 if taking club finesse at some stage|pg||
nt|400 volt: this will be -1|pg||
nt|arderi:  Club lead!|pg||
nt|arderi:  and quick claim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@C?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|400 volt: as some kibs point out, it's down 2, yes|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: strata mo¿e byæ 17 impowa|pg||
nt|antoniz: tylko -13IMP|pg||
nt|skaftij:  IIn OR, West was tempted to seek slam after South had doubled 2@c|pg||
nt|jbgood: the recent matches against Sweden and Bulgaria will help though, but first goal is to be among the 9 qualifying for the final rounds|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I think Nybo should have bid something more forward-going|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why do you say that Bob?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mamos:  THIS has been an excellent German  performance |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na szczesie tylko 13|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 more imps to Israel as they made 1NT in OR on board 14 |pg||
nt|barnets: you see how aggresive e/w are with wests x with only 7 hcp|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mamos:  very onesided match|pg||
nt|400 volt: north will not take his 8 tricks. He will try to make a @S finesse - the only chance to make 3 NT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nicely predicted|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Maybe because the state of the match he is bidding 5 @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: now they will surely bid it|pg||
nt|panosk: maybe this doesnt apply in wed BBO |pg||
nt|mathat: x@d to J @d|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos:  Israel have a bit of a lead now  19-11vps  they lead group A  by six vps frpom Italy Latvia and Sweden|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: there are some security detail from israel here |pg||
nt|pelu:  for sure - after the RD I exp West to do more, but both W-players gave up - even when they Know that EW has 26+ HPC|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mathat: @d 3-3 or |pg||
nt|panosk: as I'm told "in web u can check right where it says other table and see both bidding and play" thx |pg||
nt|pisoy: probably he will put the A@S|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|bobholl: i don't call it a good 12 :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|djneill:  now he will go for that squeeze this time|pg||
nt|petergill: In Group A, every NS has a plus score on Bd 14 ref |pg||
nt|pisoy: and try finess in @C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|400 volt: then smirnov/piekarek will get 1@S, 4@D and 1@H trick|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ryskiel_: koncepcja rozgrywki 6 BA na drugim stole nie budzi mojej euforii|pg||

nt|bobholl: but you could doubt that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: KnR says  13.90|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: as kib mentioned south opened   so club finesse a good proposition|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West having shown 14-16. @sQ in stead of jack, and the slam is a good one after the double|pg||
nt|mamos: i think West shoul;d be grabbing any trick in sight|pg||
nt|jaapfr: playing 2@C and playe @CT and ducked by S???|pg||
nt|mamos: play and defence look haywire|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AKJxx  worth a lot more than 8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  You cannot bid it, but with an opening in South, slam is with odds|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)  goode call |pg||

nt|jaapfr: biding and play looks from another planet|pg||
