nt|ahollan1: Bompis in 6@C North|pg||
nt|tomi2: Smirnov could have rebid 2@S if he had 4 cards even with no extra strength, so 2@S in their methods is value-showing, first of all looking for a @D stopper for NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3 suiter short in @H|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes michael but that is why opps bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah the auction still in progress east may "wake up"|pg||

nt|roswolf: 5 or 6 is the question|pg||
nt|blum1956: Kholomeev has extraordinary "table feel"|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that was why 4@H was basically wrong|pg||
nt|blum1956: Pass is also possible - just exchange West's spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4nt is a very clever call i an not sure i would have made it|pg||

nt|roswolf: a hand worthy of writing up in the bulletin and more!!!|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|blum1956: I do not think the 4@h bid was a huge mistake. $1h doubled brings from -300 to -500. 4NT is down. 6@c looks not that dangerous (you have an Ace).|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|3C|nt|sharkey: Monaco bid the slam on Bd 1 - 11 IMPs|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Forrester bid 3@S showing @C & @D|pg||
nt|tomi2: but it seems to be a popular contract among the stars, Wladow-Elinescu, who are famous for making slams without all needed cashin aces, tried as well|pg||

mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: @S7 = attitude|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in attitude leads vs NT   the lower the card led, the more leader likes the suit [and dislikes shift]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sort of cute that Rehder-Gromeller get a plus score - playing in the shortest fit of 5 cards|pg||

pc|s9|nt|tomi2: and swiss pair was so sure to win it, so they redoubled their 7NT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|tomi2: norwegian seniors did not trust their ace of trumps and did not double 7@C, both not doubling and redoubling costs one imp (only)|pg||

nt|blum1956: 9 tricks in 3NT look easy (either West gets two heart tricks or has enough time to establish clubs)|pg||

nt|tomi2: but a nice point by a spec, if Lorenzini tried a @D to the ten and north returned a @D his partner with all high hearts and the guard in @C would be squeezed on the last round of ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2: klick on "open final" or the competition you are interested for the running scores|pg||
nt|ritong: but what about down 2?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even with the disaster on the slam hand   Monaco still leads the field by over 1 match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 30-vp scale   maximum win is 25 vp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Tomi -- what do you think about Piekarek's action of  just 1@H and PASS over 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|sharkey: Helgemo's 5@D really put the pressure on NS|pg||
pc|h9|nt|arvidsson: always a challenge playing on 4-3|pg||
nt|tomi2: if double would not be something artifical (e.g. don't lead my suit), this hand looks fine for a double to invite partner to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|tomi2: now they had to make the decsion two levels higher|pg||

nt|tomi2: their doubles on seriously bid contracts are not 100% penalty. Piekareks would not double on 5 bad hearts and just three potential tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|arvidsson: 3nt is a reasonble choice but will have problems since there is only one 1@H stopper|pg||

nt|tomi2: the total rankings. so if one of the 5-8 teams had lost high instead of winning high against the 10-13 teams, iceland would have 10 VP more in the final stage without playing one ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: TD has ruled that the 5@d stands on b7|pg||

nt|tomi2: judge, so I respect the TDs decison here|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Piekarek did not take long to double on B4|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|xenya: N's double is almost manadatory for them, with @C shortage, i think -- the question how high it will get them |pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: then why was it adjusted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: TD said he made his  decision on consulting other players..|pg||
nt|xenya: undo|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Karakolev has called TD...|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: If S has @hA he will have 5@h, 3@s and 1@d trick|pg||

nt|arvidsson: W asked and deecided that he wanted to play 4@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|arvidsson: a Kibitzer informed me that @C is the suit to play for EW|pg||
nt|xenya: we can't complain about the hands being boring|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|monde9: but not a good contract|pg||
nt|vasmar: than 3NT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|panosk: just in @D is enough|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panosk: gd guessing|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 5@C looks like it is close to make for EW, but now we play 4@S x|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|monde9: that lead helped a little bit but doesn't change much|pg||
nt|monde9: now 10 of @C |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|vasmar: spade is better for the defense i think|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|pisoy: now is a small problem..he played for double finess and the @C is 4/2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tomi2: let's have a quick look at the other results, Israel winning against Monaco but not very high, England has beaten Italy. Netherlands took 24... atm Italy is out of the Medals... ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: Germany 7th with some 3VP to the 6th Poland, France, Sweden and Russia follow but they are all 8VP behind Germany|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzgq: asking about leads|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|arvidsson: not much to hope for will be 1 off if EW cash ther @D |pg||
nt|tomi2: two or three VP are hanging on the TD decision|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|h8|nt|vasmar: he can still make it fi he finds hearts|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|pisoy: he can play for 3/3@C|pg||
nt|monde9: the dec will not try the finesse in @H maybe ; he's counting & counting |pg||
nt|pisoy: or @H to the 9|pg||
nt|monde9: now every trick is for one down |pg||
nt|pisoy: or @H to the J|pg||
nt|monde9: & pressure is higher : last board :)|pg||
nt|pisoy: which is normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's something happening here -- what it is ain't exactly clear|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|arvidsson: West was uncertain of the lenght and N will make 4@S|pg||
