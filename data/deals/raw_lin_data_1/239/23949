mb|p|nt|arvidsson: a Kibitzer informed me that @C is the suit to play for EW|pg||
pc|h7|nt|monde9: but not a good contract|pg||
nt|vasmar: than 3NT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|panosk: just in @D is enough|pg||
pc|hK|nt|panosk: gd guessing|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 5@C looks like it is close to make for EW, but now we play 4@S x|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|monde9: that lead helped a little bit but doesn't change much|pg||
nt|monde9: now 10 of @C |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vasmar: spade is better for the defense i think|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|d6|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s4|nt|pisoy: he can play for 3/3@C|pg||
nt|monde9: the dec will not try the finesse in @H maybe ; he's counting & counting |pg||
nt|pisoy: or @H to the 9|pg||
nt|monde9: now every trick is for one down |pg||
nt|pisoy: or @H to the J|pg||
nt|monde9: & pressure is higher : last board :)|pg||
nt|pisoy: which is normal|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||

nt|arvidsson: S having some problems figuring out what has happend|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 2nt lookes lika a psyc in S perspective might try 4@S here|pg||
