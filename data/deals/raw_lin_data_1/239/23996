nt|prasun1966: ..|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he might solve it. |pg||
nt|henryb:  Or rather, perhaps he should. He knows declarer has at least three spades, two clubs, and four diamonds.|pg||
nt|henryb:  as winners. So the only hope is that declarer has the stiff @hK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was counting tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|mackulky:  easy 9 tricks for Raju |pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d7|pc|h3|nt|prasun1966: difficult for S to take @SA and Play @HA|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|henryb:  And if declarer has only the stiff @hK. he will have five diamonds, therefore ...|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|dJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|henryb:  And partner, who did not preempt in first seat has to have a reason|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
mc|11|nt|prasun1966: After this bidding auction, it was not very clear to S  the exact distribution of E|pg||

nt|prasun1966: N will have to believe the @S10 to make this contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  He needs three more tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  one of these can come from the fourth spade, but he still needs two tricks from somewhere|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mackulky:  both play and defense will be interesting|pg||
nt|mackulky:  but I believe Declerer should prevail in the end|pg||
