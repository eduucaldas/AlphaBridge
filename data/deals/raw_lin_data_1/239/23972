nt|geot: Some hand to start with for South|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi David|pg||
nt|ady: hi Martin|pg||
nt|roswolf: a few 50's probably|pg||
nt|ady: can hardly blame east for no protection   and west a bit fixed     west might have overcalled 1@H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have judged well to defend  as 3@H  would almost certainly go down  and 3@D is down 1|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tez: iddialý atak ediyorlar..eðer en küçüðüyse|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: N asking about Ws alternative bids|pg||
nt|psyck: @s would have been better for defense, but difficult with that holding|pg||
nt|baldjean: hard to find that lead. it might as well have given a trump trick away|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: 2@H made in OR so Bulgaria should gain 2 imps|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, needed to avoid leading a @d from hand.|pg||
nt|ady: looks like defence should play trumps at every opportunity  even west give up a trump trick to stop any cross ruff|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: przypominam ¿e 6 miejsce jest graniczne w premiowaniu - daje uprawnienia do gryw Bermuda Bowl|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i was thinking they are doing fine with this neutral defense|pg||
pc|c4|nt|poohbear: Didnt see that North dbled the final contract. This is somethign that modern bidding has frowned upon|pg||
nt|barnets: down 1|pg||
nt|psyck: same contract other room|pg||
nt|baldjean: since S could easily hold AKJ in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: sure @s lead by W unlikely but @h to E & @s back was a possibility|pg||
nt|psyck: & another @s after @cA...|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer trying to ruff a @H in dummy, but it will not work|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cT|nt|star6ija: 690 is the most probable result here|pg||
nt|poohbear: No reason to dbl opps who voluntarily bid game. ESPECIALLY nv|pg||
nt|star6ija: right...|pg||
nt|poohbear: imp odds terrible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Back to -1 again...|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|geot: Note that even on a spade lead there is no chance in this contract|pg||
pc|s7|nt|poohbear: if they make 5 imps against. If they go down 1,  2 imps for . If they go down 2 then 5 imps|pg||
nt|desinka: why both tables starts from 1st board?|pg||
nt|sastro: Roland sollte @h zurückspielen- hat Jörg mit @D Dame gezeigt|pg||
nt|gulyas: now S will exit with a trump|pg||
nt|poohbear: need to cash the @c ace to avoid the endplay |pg||
nt|gulyas: but even a @D would do|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: only a heart lead gives it|pg||
nt|geot: In fact it is in theory possible to go 2 down bye endplaying declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: If they make overtricks..........|pg||
nt|desinka: h tables starts from 1st board..|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||

nt|fabsayc: does not really matter, west gets two trump tricks for down 1|pg||

nt|psyck: as we see, Versace did indeed lead @s other room|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, but the bidding there made it less likely S holds AKJ in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: true, easier on other room bidding|pg||

nt|ady: again 3 top losers   this time in spades    but 4 spades looks good   I am sure they will be in it this time|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think declarer failed to realize why the defense allowed him a @h ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the play would have been interesting|pg||
nt|geot: to take 2 down I mean|pg||
nt|santyclz: So 1st blood to Italy for going down 1 fewer trick.|pg||
nt|gulyas: with 3nt laydown, this may be costly|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yusufb: selammm herkese|pg||

pc|d8|nt|baardolav: 2@s perfect for NS, should make... |pg||
nt|ady: west is aware of 4 spades with south    the 3@D response to puppet said no 5 card major  but promised at least 1 4 card major|pg||
nt|roswolf: although it is basically the same whatever he plays|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks possible now|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@C probably a natural slam try|pg||
nt|gulyas: cue bids follow|pg||
pc|s5|nt|geot: and Norway can't really complain about bad luck on board 1, because East's @H opening was on a 10 count with 10 to five hearts. He got punished hard.|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||

nt|ady: 5@H   carrys risk this hand   cannot afford the safety play in trumps   does not want north on lead for a spade switch|pg||
nt|gulyas: its always hard to find slam when you have a void, unless you plan on using exclusion|pg||
nt|gulyas: oops, a wheel fell off|pg||
nt|gulyas: S thought his @Hs are worth something|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ace of trumps is the hardest one to Q bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: N is hoping someone x-ed with the @HA|pg||
nt|gulyas: E certainly surprised his pd doubled while HE is holding an ace|pg||
nt|poohbear: now he doesnt know what to lead. Had easy lead before :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I don't see what beauty S found in his hand - N did not invite him to a grand|pg||

nt|barnets: trouble for east now|pg||
nt|ady: east transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  at this vul, EW will stretch as much as possible to get to 4@h|pg||
nt|james_h: I think the double will weaken Easts case(assuming he has one) on the last hand|pg||
nt|james_h: 2@c is a Tx to @d|pg||
nt|ady: this can be defeated with a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|psyck: The matches played by qualified teams against each other are important as they are carried forward|pg||

nt|roswolf: on bd1 the icemen played in 4@H west doubling the opening 1@d|pg||
nt|ady: again Italy fixed by Iceland opening    but managed to come in 2nd round|pg||
nt|ady: 2 hearts goes at least 2 down|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1nt ist 15-17 ausser in NG erste und zweite Hand, da 14-16|pg||

mb|4H|nt|star6ija: this pass requires trump lead...otherwise declarer can prevail|pg||
nt|sastro: naja- Polet könnte 4er @H halten !|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: so even transfer bids have their disadvantages - opps can cue in the suit transferred to:)|pg||

nt|roswolf: perhaps not a lebensohl sequence|pg||

nt|andyv:  declarer has a @h and @s loser (if finesse is off) and trying to make sure there are no uppercuts |pg||
nt|panosk: hi all|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer might cross to Jack of @hs and play a small @c from dummy. Hoping to lose to North|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, he may even have the !KQ onside|pg||
nt|ritong: two purposes 1) finding KQ onside|pg||
nt|poohbear: only in his dreams :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: *@DKQ |pg||
nt|ritong: 2) rectifying count just in case|pg||
nt|poohbear: doesnt work for dbl squeeze tho|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, if declarer plays the @DJ, N may not return it (in case declarer has AJT, and needs to guess whether to take another finesse or find a different route)|pg||
nt|ritong: it is extremely difficult to continue the suit for north, yes  totally antiintuitive|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he plays a @D to the J, and N does not return it, he can make DD with the triple squeeze|pg||

nt|gulyas: ok, I cheated and asked gib just to confirm it - he says only a @D return beats it now|pg||
nt|ritong: and as said, counterintuitive|pg||
nt|gulyas: he can cash his @Hs, then his @Ss in case they run|pg||

nt|ahollan1: vanProoijen can ask [1@S] or start to describe his hand via 1N|pg||

nt|james_h: The Bulgarians were quite agressive at both tables on the last hand and paid the price|pg||

nt|barnets: really ?|pg||
nt|ritong: mon espionne me dit que l autre salle est plus haut|pg||
nt|ritong: possible, however this a bit overhuman|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  2@h = p/c|pg||

nt|mugsmate:  He'll win hand to keep the entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: needs A@H as entry fir diamonds|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: Sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  heavy 2N bid|pg||
nt|xenya: could be a problem for NS here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5@C/@D (332)|pg||

nt|barnets: nothing in this hand except to point out looking at all 4 hands 12 tricks|pg||
nt|authau: il faut dire que ça vient bien|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like 3@C inv with 6 clubs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sengulerz: 2@c gazilli mi?|pg||
nt|barnets: now east is wondering what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|barnets: why didnt he bid diamonds before himself|pg||
nt|barnets: at the 4 level|pg||
nt|santyclz: Is there any possibility this is a cue in support of @Ss?|pg||
nt|barnets: is this a natural bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: west made a clever move; 4 clubs then removing 4 sp should tell his p "I have a massive red-suiter and think that the 5 level is safe"|pg||
nt|barnets: why do I have this problem ?|pg||
nt|barnets: he thinks it should be obvious to his partner but I assure you it is not|pg||
nt|jbennet: cue for spades?? 5 clubs would be cue for spades. |pg||
nt|barnets: or he would have bid already|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: east has hands on head thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: east is wondering what is going on and probably should bid 6@D to cover all possiblities|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many are telling me (all for different reasons) that this "Can't" show @s support.  I agree, if you're looking at the w hand it's obvious it can't.|pg||
nt|barnets: you , I and west know that bit does east ?|pg||
nt|jbennet: so east have to work this out, but if he thinks that west is showing a red 2-suiter good enough to go to the 5 level. East just might raise to 6 d.|pg||
nt|barnets: the club can be pitched on a long diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: after a backward fineese|pg||
nt|ritong: je suis très vieux jeu, j ai des informateurs  je déteste le double écran|pg||
nt|ady: could be right to trust diamonds 3-2  and play ace and king  to gauard against QX with west for a damaging spade switch    if east wins Q@D   no problem|pg||
nt|eggy:  Presumably the x shows a singleton D?|pg||
nt|gulyas: as N could only have returned a small one to Q-A, and then he is squeezed on @D-@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: or play back the K, and then S is squeezed in @D-@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H = 12-14 HCP  and exact shape|pg||

nt|ady: now 10 tricks|pg||

nt|authau: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  pour celles et ceux moins "vieux jeu"  lol|pg||
nt|barnets: then after winning 2 heart tricks|pg||
nt|ady: 9@S    then should go down  if heart switch after K@C|pg||
nt|barnets: south culd retrn  a spade|pg||
nt|ady: if ducking twice back to spades  |pg||
nt|barnets: so def have 1@C 2@H 1@S and @DAce|pg||
nt|barnets: 5 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: spade return would have been no good   play a diamond for 9th trick|pg||
nt|barnets: he had to play @S9 at trick 1|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tez: bizimkiler alýþtý artýk|pg||
nt|eggy:  so this will need a heart guess|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  @d lead was best for defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D = strong slam interest in @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Running scores (I think):  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|james_h: y|pg||
nt|jbennet: in other room west hade a more difficult view to take because he had to act over 4 clubs.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C = maximum [in context]  3 keycards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in response to 4@D  'slave' can also describe  bad or medium hand for @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Verhees held same hand with @DQ instead of @CQ   i wonder if he bids the same way or treats the hand as 15+ HCP|pg||
nt|barnets: then dc only has 2@S 5@C and ! one heart trick|pg||
nt|barnets: he does not make the @DK in time|pg||
nt|barnets: def have 5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oleberg:  Or else, there will simply not be enough tricks|pg||
nt|star6ija: last spade can cause damage to swedish pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: silly i had the righ ìt cards|pg||
nt|tez: @d ya hakim olduðu için panik yapacak biþey yok|pg||

nt|tez: 23 puanla genelde 3nt oynarlardý..durdular|pg||
nt|jbennet: but he too could have x.ed first and remove 4 spade to 5 d. |pg||
pc|s8|nt|arigun:  bu levent'in kaderi olsa gerek 10 sene once tenerifde yine yunanistan karsi oynuyoruz|pg||
nt|ady: as it happens A@S right   but declarer does not know that|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  yes - well spotted|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  so now we can take back what we thought of E's pass on board 7 as it appears he did double for a push board.|pg||
nt|star6ija: still they haven't chance to avoid the trouble|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|tez: 2 fazla oldu|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 round of @d, even with @c swith will put E in @H-@c squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so he hopes that club ruffs will make Souths trumps good. To no avail.|pg||
nt|ady: in OR   same lead   declarer decided on diamond finesse    but was ok with A@S onside|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about 5@H :(|pg||
nt|star6ija: switch*|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s cn in fact make 5@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with bust hand north bids 2@H as first bid and can stop in 3@S|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: possibly Ask Specific Kings  with 5@S denying  [the keycard response already identified @SK]|pg||
nt|geot: then back to hand and run the winners and there is a double squeeze for 13|pg||
nt|baardolav: the 13th trich on... 3 of heart|pg||
nt|baardolav: trick*|pg||
nt|ady: yes   as long as heart played after K@C   not spade|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|geot: Here an eventual NT contract will be played by East|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|geot: And South knows what to lead:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Stefanov gonna try for crossruff?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|arigun:  ilk 10 board sonunda 49 ondeyiz kalan 10 board mac berabere bitti|pg||
nt|eggy:  it would have been better, given the heart position, if the clubs hadn;t provided a discard :)|pg||
nt|eggy:  although as West doesn;t know that yet!|pg||
nt|eggy:  Tom is likely to take his time over this decision|pg||
nt|eggy:  I'd advise you all to put the kettle on|pg||
nt|barnets: so s cards lie that was a mistake by south|pg||
pc|h3|nt|oleberg:  A club-finesse at trick two would have made it as well, but thats a tough stand to take|pg||
nt|eggy:  well done|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|xenya: i don't think @D lead would beat  4@H -- declarer has time to pitch @D loser on a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened west hand 2@H  then   2@S-4@H-4@S-end|pg||

nt|arvidsson: will east pass on 2@S?|pg||
nt|yusufb: kritik bir 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: east discarded a diamond     seemed should really have broached clubs earlier|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east is in a very bad spiral|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a decent contract n/s    but likely to fail|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spade partscore likely|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    battle between the najors|pg||

nt|yusufb: ama zordu karsýda minumum 8 oldunu bilse versace 16 da kendinde var|pg||
nt|roswolf: this auction is a bit of a magical mystery tour|pg||
nt|roswolf: it hasnt stopped yet|pg||
nt|sastro: @c - as Angriff ist nicht ungewöhnlich|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Forrester makes the practical pressure bid.  Might miss a slam sometimes, but also forces the opponents to guess at a very high level|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S  presume   after n/s bid to 5@C     so good decision in OR   good score for England|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  just needs the h10 onside|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  He's thinking about how to make it with hKQ offside. There are elimination chances.|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  If he ruffs a spade, crosses in trumps twice to ruff his spades, and exits with the third diamond, he just needs the d10 onside.|pg||
nt|ady: play does not make sense otherwise|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: presumably this shows 4/5 @S/@H?|pg||
nt|baardolav: there where no squeeze with the heart lead... |pg||
nt|jbennet: where as in the other room west decied to take the unilateral decision of bidding 4h over 4 cl,|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  h10 onside|pg||
nt|ady: was down|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe you are right|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS played the safer-looking 4@H on bd8, but that was also down on a trump promotion, so only a loss of 3 imps for going down a few extra in 3nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  their version of Smolen|pg||
nt|jbgood: shouldnt Boye pass 2@c?|pg||
nt|geot: yes, right...so...well think in 7@S the best chance is to play for the diamond ruff also without a heart lead. But it is probably close|pg||
nt|baardolav: Yes... need a calculator...|pg||
nt|2celik1: iceride @C 2 li atagi ile batirildi 3nt board 8|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C looks like a michaels bid showing both majors    though north showed diamonds rather than spades|pg||
nt|psyck: The top 6 will then go to the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 6 COUNTRIES -- not necessarily the team that plays in Dublin|pg||

nt|star6ija: Karakolev has to lead ONLY @d|pg||
nt|star6ija: ...or trump|pg||
nt|barnets: two round hearts would promote trump trick so only 10 tricks in clubs|pg||

nt|santyclz: I think they are delayed because of a director call about the last board.  (They weren't slow enough before...)|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: 3N is best here of course as the cards lie -- 4@S is a bit trickier...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Lots of thinking at this table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who knows :(|pg||
nt|ritong: when south was forced to bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sengulerz: 2 imp olsun bizim olsun|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: Ahhhh another way to beat 4 . kill the entry to the @d|pg||
nt|barnets: lucky for e/w no X|pg||
nt|jbennet: it was reasonable to remove 4 sp x, but 4NT as a "pick a suit" would involve p in the process. |pg||
nt|barnets: but swing earned by east for Italy in open by opening 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: a better bid in my opinion|pg||
nt|arigun:  love yok yanlismi sayiyorum yani dekleran el tutunca 6@d+5@h+@sA dusunmezmi|pg||
nt|arigun:  kabak oluyor diyemlere sordum|pg||
nt|ritong: pour le reste, on assure aussi|pg||
nt|ady: if hearts are led and continued after losing diamond finesse then may have to take the same 9 tricks  unable to finesse spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgp: one round of hearts have been played so far|pg||
nt|jbgood: so maybe Norway will get off the schneid now|pg||
nt|geot: N/S can win 6@D on this hand, but only double dummy. Has to drop the @DK|pg||
nt|geot: Madala did not re-open with a double at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: second trick won by EW so logic tells me a diamond queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: from there on it is quessswork sorry|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: 10 diamond lead from south on 5th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: club discarded West and east|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: west and north|pg||
nt|geot: N/S still bidding this hand in the OR, on their way to a possible slam that normally will fail. But they are lacking 2 Key Cards in a diamond contract, so I suspect 5@D will be the ...|pg||
nt|geot: contract.|pg||
nt|jbennet: 5h can even be set -3. |pg||
nt|barnets: Italy now in fron by 4|pg||
nt|barnets: south could have risked a x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and even 4N  -  is that RKC or Turbo|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe asks for @CQ |pg||

nt|tez: açýk kart analiz benimki..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Turbo is a convention where 4N bidder shows a particular number of keycards rather than asking|pg||
nt|barnets: choice of contracts|pg||
nt|barnets: either spades or Nt|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed :)|pg||
nt|eggy:  There isn;t a chance in the world that N will get the spades right|pg||
nt|barnets: normaly it is right to duck spade|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|panosk: if you go a 20 hcp game and 5 are useless its not gd news, but i also think many will venture 4@H|pg||
nt|rodvenn: yes hard to stop, but west may see that his 2 queens do not carry much weight|pg||

nt|barnets: no imagination :)|pg||

nt|gulyas: ok, its all down to Fantoni now to find a safe lead|pg||
nt|barnets: he may make on squeeze as was suggseted on north|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|gulyas: ok, a safe lead found|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see how declarer handles it|pg||

nt|ady: south cant be blamed for entering |pg||
nt|santyclz: Once again, showing 2 suits and allowing your partner to show his hand wins over the solo bidding.|pg||
nt|barnets: north will be squeezed in end|pg||
nt|ritong: but, if he tries to discover about @cs, this might induce him to play north for @d shortage|pg||

nt|psyck: lucky @dJ single|pg||

pc|hA|nt|andyv:  and the match is tied|pg||
nt|tez: @h dam al @s oyna|pg||
nt|poohbear: If he plays AK of @s then he might lose to 4-1 spades. |pg||
nt|barnets: south won the points here by bidding 3@H and tking away a constructive move from west|pg||
nt|jbennet: will he make it?|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 sp+|pg||
nt|santyclz: While any team could win any match, you're not going to get rich betting against Italy...|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room south passed 1@S|pg||
nt|ady: likely spade lead    then easy|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is not a pure example, ofc|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@h is very good, defence lacks the comunication to put it down on a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jbgood: Norwegian ladies way ahead against Germany! (without Auken - von Arnim on the team though)  |pg||
nt|psyck: & trump 22|pg||

nt|james_h: unfortunately there is no minor suit squeeze as north has to discard before east|pg||
nt|ady: now looking further     5@C seems ok    but 6 should fail    although only 1 top loser|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 6 will make actually|pg||
nt|ady: might make 12 tricks in clubs as A@D   comes down in 3   so can play diamond to king   and ruff the ace out   also ruff finesse k@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, N has no reentry to give S a @D ruff|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|geot: Blind guess what to lead of H or S, and spade lead seems more appealing I guess|pg||
nt|james_h: so a likely -1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yusufb: heralde salonun egale bordu olur|pg||
nt|poohbear: might not be able to do anything about that anyway|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: good cardsence from Odin Svendsen here, 4@c is a good bid, know his hand is of little value in NT, short on entrance, only one top trick, @c game looks more tempting, even 5@c ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: should make from South point of view|pg||
nt|gulyas: but 3@S makes, too|pg||

nt|fluffy: 3@s will be at least faster|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|james_h: oh right its automatic sry|pg||
nt|ady: but west has found the switch to break the squeeze|pg||
nt|ritong: et l enchère de 3SA est un peu sauvage, je trouve  3@s pour solliciter un arrêt complémentaire aurait été plus soigneux|pg||
nt|ritong: cakewalk, even|pg||
pc|hT|nt|star6ija: I do not believe Fredin switched in @cs in board 10|pg||
nt|star6ija: 9|pg||
nt|ady: not the greatest contract    but lets see|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 5NT showing void in higher ranking suit then @c and 1 or 3 keycards|pg||
nt|ady: good stop    4 hearts needs club finesse and 3-3 split    plus 3=3 heart split|pg||

mb|p|nt|baardolav: can be 2 down if make the heart ace as entry for @d finesse|pg||
nt|geot: So how should he play it? Play AK diamonds, or close his eyes and enter the @H ace and take the diamond hook|pg||
nt|2celik1: 6 sayi daha Turkiye'ye|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: Director adjudicating no information yet|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: and Nybo knows he gives away a spade trick - but is not afraid of the diamonds running|pg||
nt|geot: A club lead would have been awful for declarer, no entry to his diamonds at all....but that is of course just double dummy stuff for the defender|pg||
