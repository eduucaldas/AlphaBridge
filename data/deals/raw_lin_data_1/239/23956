nt|sastro: die 1 @s Eröffnung ist auf 10-14 HCP limitiert|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzgp: this not the correct bidding|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in Open room|pg||
nt|barnets: np|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: but contract is written 3@H on bocchis record|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if e-w are limited to 2@hs if the defense gets all its tricks.|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure you can even make 1@H its close|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|desinka: now 2@S|pg||

nt|roswolf: whoops italy silent|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 1@h could be 11-13 bal or big both with 4+ support|pg||

pc|s5|nt|star6ija: hi, Barry :)|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, Momchil.. seems like 1st blood to Bulgaria |pg||
nt|poohbear: The bidding is typical of modern stds. No one passes a 6 card major when their partner opens the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: request for link to running scores please|pg||
nt|tez: @h atak edebilir zorlu|pg||
nt|tez: yerde tek ya da þigan @h var..konuþmalardan biliniyor|pg||

nt|geot: Hi Jon, and kibs. Welcome.|pg||
nt|baardolav: hello all, Hei Geir and Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: at the other table N passed and E opened 1 @h:)|pg||
nt|geot: Some hand to start with for South|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi David|pg||
nt|ady: hi Martin|pg||
nt|roswolf: a few 50's probably|pg||
nt|ady: can hardly blame east for no protection   and west a bit fixed     west might have overcalled 1@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|star6ija: actually this double might have been misunderstood from S...I really doubt they play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @d trick and try for a crossruff|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have judged well to defend  as 3@H  would almost certainly go down  and 3@D is down 1|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tez: iddialý atak ediyorlar..eðer en küçüðüyse|pg||
pc|c4|nt|geot: Versace hot the diamond lead, and 5@D will quickly go one down|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|barnets: may be able to beat 2@H now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|star6ija: yes...this way avoiding trump queen guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: N asking about Ws alternative bids|pg||
nt|psyck: @s would have been better for defense, but difficult with that holding|pg||
nt|baldjean: hard to find that lead. it might as well have given a trump trick away|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: 2@H made in OR so Bulgaria should gain 2 imps|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, needed to avoid leading a @d from hand.|pg||
nt|ady: looks like defence should play trumps at every opportunity  even west give up a trump trick to stop any cross ruff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: also the ubiquitous italian double possilbe over a strong club loose 1@D?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yusufb: bcok iyi dondü nafiz abi|pg||
nt|funtay: asý girerse batar|pg||

nt|funtay: öbür oda da yapmýþ bizimkiler|pg||
nt|tez: bil bakalým elinde ne kýsa:)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was thinking they are doing fine with this neutral defense|pg||
pc|cA|nt|poohbear: Didnt see that North dbled the final contract. This is somethign that modern bidding has frowned upon|pg||
nt|barnets: down 1|pg||
nt|psyck: same contract other room|pg||
nt|baldjean: since S could easily hold AKJ in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: sure @s lead by W unlikely but @h to E & @s back was a possibility|pg||
nt|psyck: & another @s after @cA...|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|nt|star6ija: 690 is the most probable result here|pg||
nt|poohbear: No reason to dbl opps who voluntarily bid game. ESPECIALLY nv|pg||
nt|star6ija: right...|pg||
nt|poohbear: imp odds terrible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Back to -1 again...|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|geot: Note that even on a spade lead there is no chance in this contract|pg||
pc|c9|nt|poohbear: if they make 5 imps against. If they go down 1,  2 imps for . If they go down 2 then 5 imps|pg||
nt|desinka: why both tables starts from 1st board?|pg||
nt|sastro: Roland sollte @h zurückspielen- hat Jörg mit @D Dame gezeigt|pg||
mc|9|nt|jbgood: only a heart lead gives it|pg||
nt|geot: In fact it is in theory possible to go 2 down bye endplaying declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: If they make overtricks..........|pg||

nt|ady: yes   down 1    3 imps for Norway|pg||
nt|roswolf: ANOTHER THIN GAME FOR E/W?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|poohbear: 6 imps for Bulgaria for the dbl|pg||
nt|ady: again 3 top losers   this time in spades    but 4 spades looks good   I am sure they will be in it this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the play would have been interesting|pg||
nt|geot: to take 2 down I mean|pg||
nt|santyclz: So 1st blood to Italy for going down 1 fewer trick.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|yusufb: selammm herkese|pg||
nt|ady: so in fact 6 imps to Bulgaria   Hanlon played 10@S  in the end game  ttrying to give impresion of Q10 left I would think|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm precision style 2@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w might be fixed here too|pg||
nt|ady: afain  west in difficulties|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: and another Bulgarian pair in the OR, whose agressive style misleaded Swedes|pg||
nt|ady: again|pg||
nt|sastro: ein möglicher 6 @s Kontrakt|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  one overtrick in the OR for 1 imp to Monaco|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4H is very aggressive|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mihov has taken good decision in the OR|pg||
nt|desinka: this one looks like flat to me...|pg||
nt|james_h: tough position for NS here|pg||
nt|funtay: 12 ile açmadý Nafiz abi|pg||
nt|tez: 10 imp bize|pg||
nt|funtay: 4-4 major ile açardým, siz?|pg||
nt|ady: double?|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has the right shape to double though|pg||
nt|roswolf: the italians appear sleepy today|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: diðer masada 3@d oynanýyordu bu el|pg||
nt|tez: @h ataðýna batacak burda|pg||
nt|yusufb: 4-3 e 4@s iyi kontrat ama bulmak zor|pg||
nt|tez: nafiz abi diyor ki @h asýyla al küçük @d yý oyna..batýr bakalým:)|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be a flat board probably in all matches|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|james_h: I like Fantunes defence to Multi ... X shows @h|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   have 3NT   with their 28 hcp   not in the bidding yest|pg||
nt|james_h: it counters this situation here|pg||
nt|ady: there is a lucky lay to make 6@D    but will surely play an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: aah good, i don't need to look at their cc's anymore now that we have Al here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: as Shwartz did here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Can never tell with these big distribution hands|pg||
nt|tez: oynayanlar skoru görmüyor..masada oynuyorlar..yanlarýnda bilgisayar operatörü var..genelde isimleri kenan oluyor..onlar masada ne olduysa bize iletiyor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=8+, non-force  [obviously]|pg||
nt|roswolf: again probably a couple off but the italians wont be pleased i think|pg||
nt|ady: at least 200 for e/w    but still good result for Iceland if 4@S reached in OR|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yusufb: 2@d tek renkli major eli|pg||
nt|ady: south should certainly have taken some action first round|pg||
nt|james_h: Hanlon did well to recover|pg||
nt|ady: North has taken a gamble balancing at that level|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 top tricks playing their 5-5 fit in 3nt, but  it's not likely...|pg||
nt|sastro: bei Treffangriff kaum zu gewinnen|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: hi ..eamon galligan here ..I reconstructed play on board 1 here .. fairly close ..bidding I made up also |pg||
mb|4D|nt|andyv:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|star6ija: these 4 @h are little tricky|pg||
nt|jbgood: and at the other table a heart was lead - since E opened 1 @h|pg||
nt|geot: N/S got into the bidding now, and will possibly end in a spade partscore|pg||
nt|ady: e/w in trouble now if south re-doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: S asked about 3NT  and shrugged|pg||
nt|yusufb: bende kesin acardým 3 pozisyona gerek yok 1dende herkes acar nafiz abi ilk elin keyfini sürüyo olacak:)|pg||

nt|star6ija: as our friend from Pakistan Oosman Bashir pointed out...both Souths did also well not trying slam over 4th level overcall|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S  shows 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: and they play in the predictable 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually, i thought Hanlon would respond 1N  [8-11]|pg||
nt|eggy:  Good afternoon everyone|pg||
pc|c7|nt|baardolav: 2@s perfect for NS, should make... |pg||
nt|ady: west is aware of 4 spades with south    the 3@D response to puppet said no 5 card major  but promised at least 1 4 card major|pg||
nt|roswolf: although it is basically the same whatever he plays|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks possible now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|geot: and Norway can't really complain about bad luck on board 1, because East's @H opening was on a 10 count with 10 to five hearts. He got punished hard.|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|barnets: in the unlikely event e/w reach the 5 level South needs to unblock his @HK under the Ace later in hand to avoid endplay|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|tez: el dikkatli oynamayý gerektiriyor|pg||

pc|h2|nt|andyv:  1@h = 0-11hcp w 4@h or 4@s|pg||
nt|geot: Second seat opening. Nice hand though.|pg||
nt|larsarthur: Who would open with norths hand at board 1?|pg||
nt|tez: kontr ile baþlamasý avantaj kazandýrdý|pg||
nt|ady: if 3@C by north is obstructive I am surprised Lauria took no action with sutable shape and a passed hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  sorry, mistyped..1@h denied 4@h and has 4@s|pg||
nt|james_h: + 1 I expect|pg||
nt|ady: should make an overtrick end playing east|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes normally the italians are very aggressive|pg||
nt|ady: 1st hand  France 4@S doubled  could have been down 2  with nothing on for Italy   got out down 1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|geot: i wonder if Boye would have doubled if West had rebid 2@D on this hand? Probably.|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ady: as it tutns out 5 diamond tricks available|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H   carrys risk this hand   cannot afford the safety play in trumps   does not want north on lead for a spade switch|pg||

nt|poohbear: gives South a HUGE headache :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess he has to dbl |pg||
nt|poohbear: or pass|pg||

nt|ady: now west may get too high|pg||
nt|ady: potentially 8 imps for England|pg||
nt|eggy:  so imps on every board so far - wonder why East doubled on board 3 in the closed - perhaps it showed an unspecified 4M-5m|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: I have never been a fan of 4m bids that show an undisclosed 5 card major. Too hard to find it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|oleberg:  Kibz are more than welcome send messages to me about the meaning of bids, Im not familiar with the systems|pg||

nt|desinka: no|pg||

nt|barnets: but better contract |pg||
nt|ady: kibs saying club ruff   is right    only said a playable spot    sspade lead also has problems|pg||
nt|ady: Ace and another heart   also  with clubs 4-1  would have no chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  But this was not the board for it|pg||
nt|ady: needs 3 diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D poor odds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 4@S was ace asking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if so south should stop thinking and just bid slam|pg||
nt|ady: wrong way up on spade lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the natural spade lead kills this stone dead|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Versace has called Director re bidding on this |pg||
nt|roswolf: still leading from Jxxx is not attractive|pg||
nt|ady: might lead heart|pg||
nt|sastro: erstaunlich- O-W sollten wohl 4 @s spielen|pg||
nt|eggy:  Mind you, I'm sure any other other action would get to the same spot, or perhaps the better (on the aucon) 5D|pg||
nt|eggy:  auction|pg||
nt|ady: looks as though needs 2 diamond ruffs in north hand|pg||

nt|tomi2: ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob eines der Gebote von West limitiert war|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|panosk: 3nt was a bit optimistic from S, though his gd clubs led him to beleive that pard might have somerthing more outside this suit|pg||
nt|barnets: north has to hold his trump losers to 2|pg||
nt|jbennet: perhaps possible, |pg||
nt|jbennet: south might play west for 1552 |pg||
nt|santyclz: With the short @cs and @ss in the same hand it looks possible.|pg||
nt|barnets: dont think he will make it|pg||
nt|barnets: will lose 3 trumps and diamond likely|pg||
nt|nevaio: if he plays 2 round of cl and spade...|pg||
nt|barnets: he needs to start !K and a cub then @S9 to have any chance|pg||
nt|nevaio: not easy to read|pg||
nt|barnets: then west is endplayed|pg||
nt|santyclz: He has to play @cs and if/when w ruffs what does he exit with?|pg||
nt|barnets: I think a spade lead is worst for dec|pg||
nt|ady: even on a trump lead Barnet  looks plain sailing |pg||
nt|ady: still no problem|pg||
nt|barnets: on trump lead he is able to ruff 2 diamonds in dummy thats no problem|pg||
nt|ady: seems ok on a spade lead as well|pg||

nt|baardolav: transfer for @h and 3@h, show 5-4 in majors|pg||

nt|barnets: as a spec suggested|pg||
nt|ritong: un coup délicat|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Very tricky to evaluate David Gold's hand. So much depends on partner's heart pips when you may need to ruff diamonds with the big cards|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed but are they locked into spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: not clear what South should do. 4-4-4-1 with partner's suit your singleton is not a good recipe for NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fisher agrees|pg||
nt|james_h: We appreciate your at the table comments Dermot, keep up please|pg||
nt|ady: presume 3NT  a systm bid with spades agreed?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  the NT can be 5-3-3-2, 5-4-2-2 (but not in the majors) and 4-4-4-1 besides three run  of the mill 4-3-3-3 and 4-3-4-2|pg||

nt|panosk: what do you think 3@C means?|pg||
nt|jbennet: he has passed initallly, showed both monors, and then all of u sudden a double comes.|pg||

nt|yusufb: @h 10 suit preferans olabilir @d için|pg||
pc|d5|nt|star6ija: another chance for Sweden here as far as 3 NT can be made|pg||
nt|geot: N/S in a quite standard 3NT here. Only eight top tricks from start, but nine already if he had tried the spade 8 in trick one|pg||
nt|geot: on a low spade lead which is pretty normal|pg||
nt|jbgood: some might even lead the 10|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: good idea if prd has 5 of them|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double dummy, you need to play 2round of club AK and 4 round of diamond and then a heart for input... |pg||
nt|geot: but declarer did not try the eight and is now looking for his ninth trick. |pg||
nt|geot: he can just set up a heart trick? Lose three hearts|pg||

nt|tez: yerde rua vale varsa küçük çýkmak lazým deðil mi hocam?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: If 3@C still could be 5-5 S have a very good hand|pg||
nt|ady: declarer not running the club as wants to set up discards of spades on diamonds  before east can switchto a spade|pg||
nt|barnets: I am told as i suggested may happen england are playing 2@CXX|pg||
nt|ritong: en meme temps faut pas se gourer de majeure|pg||

nt|ady: this could well be a swing for Italy|pg||
nt|ady: feel this will end in 6@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oleberg:  Five discards will take it toll on North|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: king may take the trick|pg||
nt|geot: may get problems getting to his hand to play more hearts and later collect the heart trick|pg||
nt|geot: Best defence would be (seeing all the cards) to win the ace and switch to a club|pg||
nt|baardolav: @h Ace and club give a big problem?|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: then 2 clubs, spade ace , three diamonds and then a club :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: chatting 0 the old rule of eleven|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this is the safest line to avoid a spade loser|pg||

nt|tez: @h vale vermesi iyi olmadý..ama defans zor deðil|pg||
nt|ady: this wont stretch declarers engeries too much|pg||

nt|andyv:  N opened 1@h and E was able to bid @s and then double @ds for further takeout.  W was only too happy to leave it in.|pg||
nt|geot: On a club switch from West instead of that 1H10, declarer can still win|pg||
nt|baardolav: everything solved... with a @c can win with ace, spade to ace and jack of @h|pg||
nt|yusufb: gelme denince @d doner|pg||

nt|ritong: très sérieusement, même|pg||
nt|sastro: habe mit den beiden ja noch vor wenigen Wochen im Team gespielt. Kann mir kaum vorstellen, dass sie zwischenzeitlich ihr System restlos umgestellt haben|pg||

nt|arvidsson: (the easiest way was to raise with the K@H and be in control taking out the J of @S|pg||
nt|barnets: north overcalled 4@C in open and perhaps surprisingly south did not raid to 5|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the open room w treated his 7-5 as a 1 suiter and this time it didn't work out.|pg||
nt|barnets: 6! D a good spot|pg||

nt|roswolf: italy now putting on the imps|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Hard to comment without knowing what everything meant, but it looked like North was worth a 4H cooperation if they were just cueing|pg||

mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force -- a couple of different hand types |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vanProoijen can ask [1@S] or start to describe his hand via 1N|pg||
nt|baardolav: first grandslam today|pg||
nt|james_h: The Bulgarians were quite agressive at both tables on the last hand and paid the price|pg||
nt|jbennet: bridge an easy game sometimes, Bid longest suit first and nest time the 2nd longest suit. |pg||
nt|barnets: really ?|pg||
nt|ritong: mon espionne me dit que l autre salle est plus haut|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@h = p/c|pg||
nt|arvidsson: rdbl is just for strengt and the pass by west is probbebly forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@C more likely by south than west in my opinion :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3SA im open sind leider, wie erwartet, gefallen, also wurde Osts Experiment nicht bestraft|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 2nt+2 lik eli bizimkiler 2@s oynuyor|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2C is checkback |pg||
nt|poohbear: looking for partner's majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  S will not pass|pg||
nt|tez: batacak ta kaç batacak|pg||
nt|barnets: thats why I would not bid 4@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: italy stay low with good reason|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  He'll win hand to keep the entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: needs A@H as entry fir diamonds|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Then he needs to play for the dQ onside, or failling that, the sA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Sorry|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  heavy 2N bid|pg||
nt|xenya: could be a problem for NS here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think N will xfer to @hs and then bid 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5@C/@D (332)|pg||
nt|tez: du bakali|pg||
nt|barnets: nothing in this hand except to point out looking at all 4 hands 12 tricks|pg||
nt|authau: il faut dire que ça vient bien|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like 3@C inv with 6 clubs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sengulerz: 2@c gazilli mi?|pg||
nt|barnets: now east is wondering what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|barnets: why didnt he bid diamonds before himself|pg||
nt|barnets: at the 4 level|pg||
nt|santyclz: Is there any possibility this is a cue in support of @Ss?|pg||
nt|barnets: is this a natural bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: west made a clever move; 4 clubs then removing 4 sp should tell his p "I have a massive red-suiter and think that the 5 level is safe"|pg||
nt|barnets: why do I have this problem ?|pg||
nt|barnets: he thinks it should be obvious to his partner but I assure you it is not|pg||
nt|jbennet: cue for spades?? 5 clubs would be cue for spades. |pg||
nt|barnets: or he would have bid already|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: east has hands on head thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: east is wondering what is going on and probably should bid 6@D to cover all possiblities|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many are telling me (all for different reasons) that this "Can't" show @s support.  I agree, if you're looking at the w hand it's obvious it can't.|pg||
nt|barnets: you , I and west know that bit does east ?|pg||
nt|jbennet: so east have to work this out, but if he thinks that west is showing a red 2-suiter good enough to go to the 5 level. East just might raise to 6 d.|pg||
nt|barnets: the club can be pitched on a long diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: after a backward fineese|pg||
nt|ritong: je suis très vieux jeu, j ai des informateurs  je déteste le double écran|pg||
nt|ady: could be right to trust diamonds 3-2  and play ace and king  to gauard against QX with west for a damaging spade switch    if east wins Q@D   no problem|pg||
nt|eggy:  Presumably the x shows a singleton D?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: 3@H = 12-14 HCP  and exact shape|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet yorgunluk var belli bide vugrafta cok oynuyoruz oda bi etken|pg||

nt|fabsayc: or he can super accept as he did|pg||
nt|ady: south could cu now to show good spade fit and slam possibilities|pg||

nt|panosk: the simplifies decl task|pg||
nt|rodvenn: how is N going to set this?|pg||
nt|panosk: *the lead|pg||
nt|arvidsson: this will not be any trouble for EW they reached a good contract, and will take 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: now 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jbennet: this time north did well to ldraw conclusions from the bidding , ew were favourites at have at most 9 spades between them , ergo p har at most 1 heart.  and duly led one.|pg||
nt|tez: @h as atak eder belki kuzey|pg||
nt|yusufb: kritik 3@d ye @h atýlýyor ama @c cýkýlmazsa ele geliþ yok|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A little timing is needed, but he should get it right|pg||
nt|bobholl: but with 52 cards seen much easier|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Declarer will have to fall back on the diamonf-finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H wrongsided|pg||
nt|xenya: still making i think|pg||

nt|barnets: had he playe dthe @S9|pg||
nt|barnets: the def were in with a chance |pg||
nt|barnets: south could shift aheart|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: 3@S forces 3N|pg||
nt|baardolav: If I count right geot?|pg||
nt|yusufb: en fazla 1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: big advantage here for 2@D response as a postive bid rather than waiting|pg||
nt|authau: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  pour celles et ceux moins "vieux jeu"  lol|pg||
nt|barnets: then after winning 2 heart tricks|pg||
nt|ady: 9@S    then should go down  if heart switch after K@C|pg||
nt|barnets: south culd retrn  a spade|pg||
nt|ady: if ducking twice back to spades  |pg||
nt|barnets: so def have 1@C 2@H 1@S and @DAce|pg||
nt|barnets: 5 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: spade return would have been no good   play a diamond for 9th trick|pg||
nt|barnets: he had to play @S9 at trick 1|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tez: bizimkiler alýþtý artýk|pg||
nt|eggy:  so this will need a heart guess|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  @d lead was best for defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D = strong slam interest in @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Running scores (I think):  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|poohbear: South was virtually endplayed on the lead|pg||
nt|ady: 6 imps for bulgaria|pg||
nt|james_h: y|pg||
nt|jbennet: in other room west hade a more difficult view to take because he had to act over 4 clubs.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: 5@C = maximum [in context]  3 keycards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in response to 4@D  'slave' can also describe  bad or medium hand for @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Verhees held same hand with @DQ instead of @CQ   i wonder if he bids the same way or treats the hand as 15+ HCP|pg||
nt|barnets: then dc only has 2@S 5@C and ! one heart trick|pg||
nt|barnets: he does not make the @DK in time|pg||
nt|barnets: def have 5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oleberg:  Or else, there will simply not be enough tricks|pg||
nt|star6ija: last spade can cause damage to swedish pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: silly i had the righ ìt cards|pg||
nt|tez: @d ya hakim olduðu için panik yapacak biþey yok|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: right|pg||
nt|tez: yere doðru oynanan @d ya 10 girmeyecek salvo |pg||
nt|tez: 23 puanla genelde 3nt oynarlardý..durdular|pg||
nt|jbennet: but he too could have x.ed first and remove 4 spade to 5 d. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|arigun:  bu levent'in kaderi olsa gerek 10 sene once tenerifde yine yunanistan karsi oynuyoruz|pg||
nt|ady: as it happens A@S right   but declarer does not know that|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  yes - well spotted|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  so now we can take back what we thought of E's pass on board 7 as it appears he did double for a push board.|pg||
nt|star6ija: still they haven't chance to avoid the trouble|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tez: 2 fazla oldu|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 round of @d, even with @c swith will put E in @H-@c squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so he hopes that club ruffs will make Souths trumps good. To no avail.|pg||
nt|ady: in OR   same lead   declarer decided on diamond finesse    but was ok with A@S onside|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about 5@H :(|pg||
nt|star6ija: switch*|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s cn in fact make 5@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with bust hand north bids 2@H as first bid and can stop in 3@S|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: possibly Ask Specific Kings  with 5@S denying  [the keycard response already identified @SK]|pg||
nt|geot: then back to hand and run the winners and there is a double squeeze for 13|pg||
nt|baardolav: the 13th trich on... 3 of heart|pg||
nt|baardolav: trick*|pg||
nt|ady: yes   as long as heart played after K@C   not spade|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|geot: Here an eventual NT contract will be played by East|pg||
pc|c8|nt|geot: And South knows what to lead:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Stefanov gonna try for crossruff?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|arigun:  ilk 10 board sonunda 49 ondeyiz kalan 10 board mac berabere bitti|pg||
nt|eggy:  it would have been better, given the heart position, if the clubs hadn;t provided a discard :)|pg||
nt|eggy:  although as West doesn;t know that yet!|pg||
nt|eggy:  Tom is likely to take his time over this decision|pg||
nt|eggy:  I'd advise you all to put the kettle on|pg||
nt|barnets: so s cards lie that was a mistake by south|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|oleberg:  A club-finesse at trick two would have made it as well, but thats a tough stand to take|pg||
nt|eggy:  well done|pg||
pc|cT|nt|eggy:  and in double quick time :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: i don't think @D lead would beat  4@H -- declarer has time to pitch @D loser on a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened west hand 2@H  then   2@S-4@H-4@S-end|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes... a heart seem safe even for me... but 7@s it is|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|star6ija: how many @ss Nystrom will bid|pg||

nt|roswolf: this auction is a bit of a magical mystery tour|pg||
nt|roswolf: it hasnt stopped yet|pg||
nt|sastro: @c - as Angriff ist nicht ungewöhnlich|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Forrester makes the practical pressure bid.  Might miss a slam sometimes, but also forces the opponents to guess at a very high level|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S  presume   after n/s bid to 5@C     so good decision in OR   good score for England|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  just needs the h10 onside|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  He's thinking about how to make it with hKQ offside. There are elimination chances.|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  If he ruffs a spade, crosses in trumps twice to ruff his spades, and exits with the third diamond, he just needs the d10 onside.|pg||
nt|ady: play does not make sense otherwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: presumably this shows 4/5 @S/@H?|pg||
nt|baardolav: there where no squeeze with the heart lead... |pg||
nt|jbennet: where as in the other room west decied to take the unilateral decision of bidding 4h over 4 cl,|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  h10 onside|pg||

nt|geot: yes, right...so...well think in 7@S the best chance is to play for the diamond ruff also without a heart lead. But it is probably close|pg||
nt|baardolav: Yes... need a calculator...|pg||
nt|2celik1: iceride @C 2 li atagi ile batirildi 3nt board 8|pg||

nt|star6ija: Karakolev has to lead ONLY @d|pg||
nt|star6ija: ...or trump|pg||
nt|barnets: two round hearts would promote trump trick so only 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|eggy:  if N can identify that there is a real source of tricks|pg||
nt|ady: Liz   was 9@S played by Madala trick1 last hand do you know?|pg||

nt|santyclz: We can only assume that this was *not* the auction at the table, so I can't tell you what n was showing with 2@c.|pg||

nt|barnets: which was not successful on this layout|pg||
nt|barnets: it looks down 1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps the board is reversed so n has the "s" hand and vice versa.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: sure seems NS had 9 tricks on defense that last hand|pg||
nt|tez: keser var mý yok mu?|pg||
nt|arigun:  hersey bilinirse 4@h oluyor ama batma olasiligi var|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: 7-3 fit in hearts again (N/S)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: 11 tricks agreed by teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: E did ask his partner why the panic to cash|pg||
nt|ady: with a free run n/s might have played 3NT    but now may settle for a diamond part score|pg||
nt|barnets: :) well put|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will now revalue his hand skywards|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H-3@D= any shortness 8singleton, not void)-3@H= ask,3@S= short @C|pg||
nt|ady: 7 level save  800   |pg||

nt|ady: Irish lukcy to be undoubled here|pg||
nt|remo: srry|pg||
nt|roswolf: so  iam informed by some specs|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Unlikely to lead a heart, so another pick up for England|pg||
nt|ady: another bid result for England    avoiding the heart lead  can take their 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: bu eldede dogu eliyle tercihim 1nt degilde X olurdu|pg||
nt|tez: 4 te kaldýlar þlem elini..|pg||

nt|tez: yok en fazla 3 el|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: bence 4@h batacak|pg||
nt|arigun:  @h 2 kaptirirsa @d yu bilmesi lazim|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h Q koyarsa batar|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in europe many pairs use 2@C natural and 2@D for majors, that may have had something to do with the first norwegian disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so  -4 rather than -2|pg||
nt|tez: 6@d da sorun yok|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2D showed 5 @ds and 8+ points|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok then I guess W raised with a @S H or S finessed with T of @S|pg||
nt|barnets: needs a spade lead or switch to beat it|pg||
nt|tomi2: does anybody know what 2@D was?|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  west opened a multi in the other room|pg||
nt|barnets: Sementa misguessed heat in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: since partner is passed hand East just bids 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: nast queeze coming up on declarer|pg||
nt|tez: @s dam uçuyor|pg||

nt|ritong: il me semble que le déclarant aura un choix|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D|pg||
nt|sastro: Polewt denkt sicher, dass die anderen 4 @h drin haben- geht aber nicht|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vahaboglu: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H alert because may have longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|barnets: moment of truth is now|pg||
nt|barnets: for spade switch|pg||
nt|tomi2: "weak Multi" also ein schwacher schwacher Einfärber in einer Oberfarbe|pg||
nt|tomi2: das erklärt, warum Ost keine Ambitionen Richtung Vollspiel hatte|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Brink-Drijver will play this hand in 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we see that perfect defense defeats 3N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if defense does NOT take first 5 -- then declarer takes first 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver did rebid 3N with east hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: if partner was unpassed and unlimited East would bid 2NT and give partner room to describe|pg||
nt|panosk: this might get expensive|pg||
nt|ritong: soit le @sR, soit l as de @h|pg||
nt|ritong: bien mis|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kbitzer: 600  cepte görmek  dbl ý tutmak..|pg||
nt|yusufb: rakip 1nt dedikten sonra 3nt ye ulaþmak ve yapmak cok nadir olan bi durum|pg||
nt|arvidsson: a very good double by E and this might be whats needed for norway to get back in the lead |pg||
nt|arvidsson: declarer need to cash out for -800 otherwise this could go for 1100|pg||
nt|yusufb: @c cýk|pg||
nt|tez: çýk @c i|pg||
nt|tez: çýkar bence|pg||
nt|yusufb: cýkabilir @c|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: anladýlar batacaðýný belki 3NT olur dediler|pg||
nt|ady: CR   settled for diamond part score   so lleaders may go further ahead|pg||
nt|barnets: he took an early wrong position in hearts rather than delaying it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|barnets: now a low club lead|pg||
nt|yusufb: bravo salvo|pg||
nt|arigun:  @h de dogru oyun 8'e dogru oynamak ama yanlis yapar dam koyarsa ve pisman olursa @d da yuksek ihtimal cift pass (masada kaybettiriyor)|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: @c atak batýrma þansýný artýrýr|pg||

nt|vahaboglu: en azýndan ümit vaadediyor|pg||
nt|tez: burda @c i çýkarttýk..öbür odada da 4@h ü yaptýralým|pg||
nt|arigun:  iste haldun farki|pg||
nt|yusufb: bunada yapabilir ama kolay degil|pg||

nt|arigun:  gelir gelmez bi 5 bi 12 aliyoru,|pg||
nt|tisserand: good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: efficiently done|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: so the off-the-wall preempt by E has worked...|pg||
nt|tisserand: molto bravi|pg||
nt|eggy:  I hadn;t forgotten|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: what do YOU lead from south hand against 3N  [without peeking at north hand]?|pg||
nt|star6ija: this one looks like overbid|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|baardolav: well done Nybo... +1|pg||
nt|barnets: and west makes a ruff|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   open room|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s didnt bid - unsurprisingly|pg||
nt|barnets: looks easy to us|pg||
pc|s3|nt|2celik1: kotu oldu bu board|pg||
nt|sengulerz: çok güzel konuþtular (maalesef)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: but I would see the player that do not take the @C finesse|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is traditional double: I have something in your suit pd. |pg||
nt|tez: büyük abi 1 fazla olur diyor ama o @d valeyi oturtuyor|pg||
nt|kareno: He needs three tricks from spades.|pg||
nt|barnets: we would finesse the spade|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: avec l entame @d, le choix se restreint|pg||
nt|8252:  en tirant les @c il aura une idÃ©e|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodvenn: some play some of these situations as Lightner. But probably not this combination|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: iyi yolda|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the % is to play west for jack of spades but now irrelevant|pg||
nt|eggy:  sorry - private|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yusufb: bu salonun egale bordu olur|pg||
nt|barnets: no imagination :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: Luks ....  @H3|pg||

nt|vahaboglu: hala demiyordur herhalde|pg||

pc|s2|nt|baardolav: +2... now...|pg||
nt|geot: Running scores: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm   and chose group A/B or Womens|pg||
nt|james_h: Score is: Bul 39 - Ire 19 after 11 boards (19-11 in VPs)|pg||
nt|ady: south cant be blamed for entering |pg||
nt|santyclz: Once again, showing 2 suits and allowing your partner to show his hand wins over the solo bidding.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psyck: was easy on bidding & the discouraging @c8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|star6ija: but I think declarer has his 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Spade now since @h position clear|pg||
nt|arvidsson: no is my prediction 5 off|pg||
nt|arvidsson: now|pg||
nt|panosk: i think so too he has to take the @C finess |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: a very poor openign even non vul against vul   but very effective in this case|pg||

nt|psyck: lucky @dJ single|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  and the match is tied|pg||
nt|tez: @h dam al @s oyna|pg||
nt|poohbear: If he plays AK of @s then he might lose to 4-1 spades. |pg||
nt|barnets: south won the points here by bidding 3@H and tking away a constructive move from west|pg||
nt|jbennet: will he make it?|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 sp+|pg||
nt|santyclz: While any team could win any match, you're not going to get rich betting against Italy...|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room south passed 1@S|pg||
nt|ady: likely spade lead    then easy|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||

nt|ady: now looking further     5@C seems ok    but 6 should fail    although only 1 top loser|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 6 will make actually|pg||

nt|barnets: It is not clear to me if the def could beat it the way he played it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H limited to 16 HCP, so some safety for Hanlon|pg||

nt|james_h: McGann also might have had this available to him but maybe his 2@c has to be more shapely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what they do from here |pg||
pc|h7|nt|tez: herhangi kuvvetli el var|pg||

nt|ady: 3NT   for me is trying master mind |pg||

nt|barnets: and 5 card minor|pg||
nt|2celik1: istanbul da,aslinda kapanmis durumda fakat e postalar genelde isime de yardimci oldugu icin kullaniliyor|pg||
nt|ady: I tht 2 @D was big balanced hand  18-19   or around 22 plus balanced|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  told that is 2@C   so you must be right Barnet|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D shows 4+ spades and a minor   weakish|pg||
nt|barnets: I made a good guess then|pg||
nt|barnets: meanwhile bck at the ranch|pg||
nt|ady: yes   I got the 2@C and 2@D openings mixed up|pg||
nt|kareno: North trying to avoid the trump shift.|pg||
